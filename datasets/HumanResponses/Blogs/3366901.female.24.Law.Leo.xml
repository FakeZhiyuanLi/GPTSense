      Well not exactly 2 years, 51 weeks I know.  I didn't want to do the math.  Anyway.  Yep, I'm alive.  I have almost survived my first week of law school.  It seems like a blur already.  I feel like I've been here for at least a month.  Things that just happened yesterday seem like they were days ago.  Here's what my week has been like:  Monday, 8:00 a.m.   Begin reading for first day of class.  Start with Torts.  Do not finish Torts until 6:00 p.m.  Eat dinner.  Start with Criminal Law.  55 pages of Criminal Law.  Go to bed at 2:00 a.m.  Do not sleep well.  Tuesday, 6:45 a.m.    Wake up, which isn't hard since I wasn't really asleep.  Feel sick.  Try to finish reading Crim.  Force self to eat breakfast.  Feel sick again.  Get dressed.  Leave house early.  Drive to campus, walk to class.  Wait for friend.  Feel really sick.  Panic about being called on.  Almost head to the bathroom to get sick.  Decide to get bottle of water instead.  Sit down in first ever law school class.  See little prof run around class talking about how important this first day is.  We are beginning our legal career.  How important our first class is!  He doesn't feel up to the pressure.  Cool guy.  Break for lunch.  Head back for Crim.  Feel sick again.  Crim teacher is rumored to be awesome though, so not as sick as earlier.  Crim teacher is awesome.  Feel lucky.  Make mental note to visit her office.  Survived first day.  Feel pretty damn good.  Think, "hey, I can do this."  Go home.  Begin reading for class next day (3 hours of Torts).  Eat gourmet dinner of PB&J and Kraft macaroni.  Go to bed at 2:45.  Sucks again.  Wednesday, 7:00 a.m.   Wake up, finish reading.  Worry about being called on.  Do not get called on.  Relief, although realizing it would have been better in the beginning when no one knows what's going on.  Although some people think they do.  They really think they do.  Be annoyed at this.  Very annoyed.  Worry that everyone is smarter, more organized, how on earth will I stay in top 1/3????  Call friend who just graduated.  Get reassurance.  Gossip.  Feel better. Try to start Crim reading.  Can't concentrate.  Try out library.  Can't concentrate.  Spend 3 hours on two cases.  Go home to watch American Idol.  And the Bachelor.  Feel guilty.  Read again, until 2:00.  Try to sleep.  Thursday, 7:30 a.m.   Wake up, finish reading.  Meet upperclassman to discuss Crim.  Get some real help.  Get his old outline.  Awesome.  Feel good.  Go to pointless Academic Skills class.  Get annoyed.  Regret signing up.  Hope it gets more relevant.  Read more for Crim.  Do not get called on.  Return phone calls during drive home.  Inform friends that car time now equals phone time because I can't be studying.  Decide to take power nap.  Phone rings 10 min later.  Return to library at 5.  Do Torts reading until 9:45.  Answer questions for friend.  Feel smart again.  Feel like it is getting easier.  Worry that I am missing something.  Go home, do some Crim reading.  Think about weekend.  Thank goodness.  Friday, 7:00 a.m.   Wake up, turn alarm off (it was set for 8:45).  Decide to clean kitchen.  Sit outside with dogs.  Finally post to blog.  Feel guilty.  Must return to reading.  I am too tired to think of anything funny.  After class today I'm taking a break.  No more law school tonight.  I'll resume that tomorrow morning.  There is a big SBA party tonight.  Should be interesting.  Hopefully I'll write more interesting stuff this weekend.  Just wanted to assure you I'm still alive.  And I don't feel like proof reading this, so if there are error please let me know.

      I've had this blog for only a week now and I'm already slacking with my posts.  This weekend was nuts though, so I think I have an excuse.  It began on Thursday night, in Fort Myers for a wedding rehearsal.  Thursday night I came back up to St. Pete for orientation the next day.  I was at Orientation from 8-5:30, and then again Saturday morning from 9-12:30.  I then rushed back to Fort Myers to the church to get my hair done for the wedding at 4.  Sunday I came back to St. Pete.  Wow.  I'm still tired.  So here are my thoughts on orientation:  "Holy &*&^, how am I going to survive this"?!  It was very intimidating to me.  I have something like 80 or so pages to read before the first day of class (tomorrow).  Our syllabus for Criminal Law says "The reading assignments in this class are relatively short:  You should plan to cover approximately 40-50 pages of readings for each of our class meetings."  Since when is 40-50 pages considered short??  I guess I'm really in for a shock.  Especially at the rate of 10 pages per hour, which is an estimate I read in some law school prep book.  Also, the whole idea of being called on in class terrifies me.  They did a sort of mock class session at orientation and I would have have sat there dumbfounded if I'd been asked some of those questions.  It definitely wasn't a confidence booster.  On a better note, I met some really cool people.  We have 76 in our summer class, more women than men.  I'm not sure yet who the "gunners" will be, but I'm sure they will be revealed soon.  (In law school, people who always raise their hand and try to impress the professor are usually referred to ask gunners).  On a side note, one of the Ambassadors is actually named Gunner.  I found that quite funny.  One thing that really struck me was how attractive people are.  While there are some good looking guys, we have a large number of really pretty girls.  I'm not sure why, but that really came as a surprise to me.  Also, I must wonder what some people think when they got dressed for this occasion.  I don't want to post specifics just in case someone from Stetson actually reads this, but wow.  That's all I can say.   The wedding went very well, minus one little catastrophe right at the beginning.  Our bridesmaid dresses were two pieces, and one of the girls discovered (at about 3:45) that she was missing her top.  I suppose it wouldn't have been proper for her to stroll out into the church wearing only the bottom, so it had to be rushed from her home in LaBelle.  Since LaBelle is 25 minutes away, you can imagine that may cause a problem for a wedding that was supposed to begin at 4.  The poor girl was so upset she wouldn't come out of the bathroom the entire time.  She was afraid the bride was going to freak out, which she didn't actually.  It worked out great for me because it gave me more time to get ready.  After the ceremony started we had two funny incidents:  1) the bride lost her shoe going up the steps to the altar, and 2) the groom dropped her ring.  Number two was so funny because he had been worried about it so much that he wouldn't hold both her engagement ring and her wedding ring because he was afraid he wouldn't be able to get both on her finger without dropping them.  Oops.  We had so much fun at the reception the entire wedding party and many of the guests decided to head to the local bar afterwards.  We stayed and partied there, in complete wedding attire until it closed.  That basically rendered yesterday useless for me in terms of preparing for my first day of school.  Thank goodness it is tomorrow, not today.  Speaking of that law school thing, I guess I better get started on my million pages of reading.  I'll post a link to some pictures of the wedding later.

      Recently I came across a mix CD that somehow got thrown in a box of my desk stuff.  The date says I compiled it on 9/18/03.  I had completely forgotten I'd missed it, but was so excited to find it!  I tossed it into the CD player on my way to the beach yesterday and began to remember the songs.  Since most of my other mix CDs have long worn out their welcomes this discovery was especially important.  So I sang along (and danced a bit) to its various tracks, still happily surprised I'd found it.  On the way home from the beach after scanning through its entirety I realized that while this strangely eclectic mix of songs was normal to me, it may strike others as odd.  Here are the tracks:  1.  Outkast, I Like the Way You Move 2.  Outkast, Hey Ya 3.  Unknown, Unknown--but the hook goes something like, "What you talking bout...Shawty?  Now get (?) out ya mouth.  You say you want some cash...before I hit that..."  You get the point. 4.  Bubba Sparxxx, Deliverance 5.  DMX, Where the Hood At? 6.  Tom Petty, Won't Back Down 7.  Tom Petty, Free Fallin' 8.  Tom Petty, Last Dance with Mary Jane  9.  Bon Jovi, You Give Love a Bad Name 10.  Guns N Roses, Welcome to the Jungle 11.  The Ataris, Boys of Summer 12.  Leonard Skynard, Simple Man 13.  Syrai, Ladies 14.  JLo, Waiting For Tonight 15.  Creedance Clearwater Revival, Proud Mary 16.  Tina Turner, Proud Mary 17.  Bob Segar, Old Time Rock N Roll 18.  Tito Nieves, I Like it Like That  You'd think I'd at least put all of the new songs together and the old ones...nah.  Instead the natural progression to me was DMX to Tom Petty; JLo to Creedance Clearwater; Bob Segar to a song from Jock Jams.  Is this normal?

      So, as I said in one of my posts before I am a first time home owner.  I now have a lawn that needs to be mowed.  I am on a law student budget, so no, I will not be hiring someone to do it.  I must purchase a lawnmower.  After three weeks of growth the grass is now so high that my Shih Tzu will not walk on it to use the bathroom.  She instead prefers the concrete sidewalk.  This is my advice on what not to do if you need to get a lawnmower.  1.  Do not buy a lawnmower that comes unassembled, in a big cardboard box.  2.  Do not buy a $99 mower and expect it to be easy to assemble.  3.  Do not buy a lawnmower that will, after two different attempts to assemble, have your boyfriend throwing a rake across the yard and/or screaming obscenities out of frustration/rage at said mower.  4.  Do not buy a lawnmower that requires you to return to the store (Wal-mart) to look at a fully assembled version to discern the correct way to attach the starter pull.  5.  Do not buy a lawnmower that requires you to return a second time to the store digital camera in tow, with which you must take pictures of fully assembled version's starter pull in order to finally figure out that beast you have a home.  Bonus:  After an entire weekend of attempts to assemble this mower, do not mow the lawn for the first time and tell your girlfriends about it, only to have them laugh and exclaim "I'd  love  to have seen that"!

      So here's my dilemma tonight.  Should I continue to publish this blog with my full name attached?  Do I really want any of my fellow classmates to read this and know exactly who I am?  What about anyone else for that matter?  Should I be worried?  Will it alter anything I want to write?  Am I putting myself in a potentially detrimental situation by publicly posting my honest thoughts about what goes on in law school and at my school specifically?  I don't suppose any of the other bloggers who keep their names available on their sites have had major problems, and hey--they probably have readers.  I guess this dilemma is contingent on my assumption that I'll actually have readers other than those I personally direct to this page (who of course, will know my identity anyway).  Maybe I won't have readers, who knows?  Actually I'll know, since I now have a handy little counter at the bottom to keep track of how many people aren't reading this (thanks Natalie).  I guess for now I won't change the name.  I can't think of anything incredibly unusual or funny anyway, so it's probably better.    On another note, I had dinner tonight with a girl who will also start school with me next week.  It was very much a reality check--I actually met someone new, someone who is directly connected to that whole law school thing I've known I had to start soon but have been in denial about.  Other than that it went very well, and I am glad to know I at least have someone with whom I can walk to orientation.  Bonus:  I even get to park in her yard, which is about 25 steps from the law school!    Why do I keep thinking dilemma is spelled dilemna?  Great, on the cusp of beginning a legal education in which my success will depend heavily on my writing skills and I can't even spell a simple word.  What a dilemma.  OK, not funny.  Time to retire.  Goodnight!

      I ended the previous post thinking I was going to run some errands and then come back to finish later.  However, I just realized I cannot leave my house until after 2:00 or when the UPS guy returns, whichever comes first.  Apparently they are holding a package hostage until it can be delivered with signature confirmation.  Actually, I guess I really can't leave until he comes, right?  So I'll begin to impart to you how I ended up here at Stetson Law School.  I don't really know why I'm typing this as if people other than my friends (who already know the story) will read it...But hey, who knows right?  A girl can only hope.  Alrighty.  I came from a ridiculously small redneck town in SW Florida.  I'm not sure if "ridiculously" should go before small or redneck, probably both.  Anyway, I'll get into a more thorough description of LaBelle later.  I attended college at the University of Florida, from where I graduated in December 2002.  My senior year included the typical law school application preparations--LSAT class, recommendation requests, personal statement procrastination, etc.  I sent them all (10) around Christmas.    Fast forward to April 2003.  I received my final response, and my only rejection--from my wonderful alma mater on April 15.  I remember the exact date because they actually sent the rejection letter to my parent's address and my dad, who is a CPA, called me on the worst day of the year for an accountant to inform me of its receipt.  He is a Gator, and he was disappointed.  I was just pissed, because I attribute at least part of that rejection to a screw up on UF's part.  In February, I received a letter from the school claiming that they couldn't classify me as a Florida resident for admission purposes until they verified where I would be living from the time I graduate (12/02) until the time I'd matriculate into law school (8/03).  Considering that 90% of the entering class must be from Florida you can imagine how important that fact would be.  So,what I was so pissed about?  Well you see, they drafted and sent this letter to me at my GAINESVILLE address.  The current address I sent in on my application--where I was still living and working.  How the hell could they not classify me as a resident??  Didn't they send this letter intending to get a response?  How did they expect to get a response if I wasn't actually living at this Gainesville address?? Who knows.  But nah, I'm not bitter.  Anyway, I decided I wanted to attend Tulane Law School in New Orleans. Their admissions office (and everyone else I encountered) was amazing and incredibly helpful.  New Orleans was new and exciting, not to mention beautiful (Uptown especially, where I'd live).  I found an apartment, sent in a deposit, set a moving date, and decided to take a year off.  Oops.    So here I am, one year later on the verge of beginning law school at Stetson in Gulfport, FL.  This decision was a long and ardous one, partly because the only uniform advice you get about law school is to attend the best school to which you are accepted.  I guess that means I should actually be at Emory, ranked 22.  So why did I choose third tier (schools 101-150) Stetson over other higher ranked schools?  I sent in the application because of the school's proximity to my boyfriend, who lives in Tampa; my family, who lives in LaBelle/Boca Grande; and the beach.  I decided to attend after visiting the campus and meeting with several people--including the Career Services Director, who was awesome, seemed accessible, and basically told me that if I did well she would have absolutely no problem placing me in my desired location; and a former Editor-in-Chief of the Law Review (who also is a friend) who told me I'd be a dumbass not to come here with a scholarship offer.  She raved on about the school and said that even coming out with a mountain of debt she wouldn't change a thing.  I feel confident that I will be taught how to be a lawyer here more than at a lot of schools that tend to be heavily based on theory.  So far every student I've met seems extremely happy.  The law school is separate (in different cities) from the Stetson undergrad--which to some may make it seem more like a high school, I however think is pretty great.  Also, I knew I wanted to buy a house and the market is great here (more on first time homeowning later).  Oh yeah, and have you ever seen the campus?  Check out some of these  urlLink pictures .    So here I am.  If I do well in school (top 1/3 of class) I will graduate with very little debt and three years worth of appreciation on my house (more on first time home owning later).  If I don't, I'll still have less debt than I would have undertaken at Emory, and I will have spent my three years of law school 5 minutes away from the beach.  Life isn't so bad here after all, I don't think.  :)  So that is my road to Stetson in a nutshell, albeit a rather long nutshell.  Since I'm at least as tired of typing as you are of reading I'm going to end this--even though it's almost 2:00 and I still can't run my errands.  Damn, UPS cuts it close!

      So, my first attempt to link to something failed.  Great.  I hope that's not an indication of how well this site will work.  I'm going to try again, in two different ways, to see if I can get it right.   urlLink Jeremy Blachman    urlLink Jeremy Blachman   Geez, those still look scary.  I guess if they don't work, I'll have to read the help directions.  Wonderful.  EDIT:  I just discovered that I can edit posts after I publish them.  I also figured out that you have to include the "http://" to successfully link.  Two new things and no help directions!

      I'm not quite sure how this whole weblog thing works, so bear with me.  I was inspired to start this after regular reading of other law student blogs (is that a word?), especially Harvard 2L  urlLink Jeremy Blachman's .  (I hope that link works...it looks pretty scary on here).  Unfortunately mine will not be as amusing as his, as I am not capable of making up the absurdly funny song parodies, lists, etc he routinely has on his blog.  If you have never looked at it, I highly suggest it.  I do hope, however, to chronicle (in my own sarcastic and cynical way) my thoughts and experiences throughout this law school journey (sorry, couldn't think of a better word).  The main purpose of this will be for my pleasure and benefit.  Ha.  Basically I'm hoping it will be a bit therapeutic at the time I write it, and a bit humorous for me to look back on someday.  I would also like to give my *non-law school* friends (actually,  all   my friends at this time) some insight into what is going on in my life.  I can post it once here, instead of explaining it 578 times.  How great is that?!  Anyway, enough for now.  I'll be back later to post more about myself and how I ended up here at Stetson.

      I think I jinxed myself when I made the comment about getting better about posting more often.  Oops.  We've got two weeks and one day until finals begin--I have a TON of stuff to do in the meantime, so I may be slacking a bit.  Keep checking back though, I'll try to post some short little thoughts whenever I can.    On another note, I saw "The Notebook" this weekend with two of my girlfriends.  It was definitely a tear-jerker!  I wasn't as bad as the other girls though (one had a pile of tissues; the other needed a tissue but was sobbing so profusely she couldn't ask for one).  The acting was decent, though I much preferred the flashbacks with the young actors to the older version of the main characters.  The last scene was quite poignant though--I doubt it could ever happen like that in real life, but it was one heck of a way to end that movie.  I wonder if love like that ever really happens in real life...  If you like love stories it's a good one and I would definitely recommend it.  It's got some funny moments as well, so if you drag your man along he won't be completely miserable.   I would write more, but I'm in the library...duty calls.  :)

      I'm getting good at this posting every other day thing.  Maybe someday I'll graduate to every day.  Probably not.  We took a practice exam today in our Academic Skills Workshop.  It was a Criminal Law Hypo (from our actual professor) that had a ton of issues in it.  Rape, murder/manslaughter/negligent homicide, transferred intent, larceny/burglary/robbery, conspiracy, and more.  All in one hypo.  The difference between this exam and the real one is that we got to use our notes--the real exam is closed book.    Listening to everyone's reactions afterwards was quite entertaining.  Some people looked like they wanted to cry.  Others were comparing their answers to their neigbors.  One guy said he wanted to go get hammered.  Personally, I wanted to go to the library and not leave for the next three weeks.  Just put the dogs in a kennel, forward my mail, and bring a blanket--live, eat, sleep, and study in the library.  And this is coming from someone who spends hours a day studying.  I can't imagine how the people who don't feel.  I think that the general consensus is that we have a LOT to learn in not a lot of time.  It was definitely an eye-opener.  It also made me realize that I spend too much time worrying about being prepared for class.  What was important for this exam was not the holding of the Brown case or the facts of the Sherry case, but the substantive law--the rules, elements, etc.  Sure, it's nice to throw in a case reference, but you don't have to memorize every line from every case.  I need to get over this fear of being called on so I can get on with my exam preparation.  We'll see if that happens.

      (That "Argh!" is my lame attempt at a pirate sound)  Yesterday we had an "optional" event in Criminal Law.  The professor invited us to come to school and watch the movie "Pirates of the Carribean."  Yes, the new popular one with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom.  She brought food and everything, it was pretty awesome of her.  The relevance to studying Criminal Law was that our job was to try to pick out all of the common law felonies that occurred throughout the movie.    There were a ton of course--mostly larceny, robbery, and murder.  But were they really murders?  Can undead pirate be morally culpable?  Is it wrong for a human to kill an undead pirate?  Gosh I hope this isn't the stuff that's going to show up on law school exams.  I must admit it was more fun than talking about rape, which we've been doing for the last week or so.  It was pretty actually pretty uncomfortable.  Yeah, we are all adults (and most act like it), but there's something unsettling about hearing the guy down the row recite the much-too-detailed facts about three doctors engaging in group sex with an unwilling nurse.  Yuck.  I'm glad that's over.  I've got to finish reading about Wrongful Death and Pure Economic Loss for Torts tomorrow.  A group of us are having a cookout tonight--I never expected to hang out this much.  That's three times in the last six days.  You'd think we had enough to keep us busy.  I suppose we do, we are all just in denial about our looming exams (21 days away).  Let's just hope tonight is just dinner only.  It seems like every time we plan on just hanging out for a little while it turns into an all night ordeal with lots of beer and hangovers.  We should be ok if we stay away from the beer.

      Here I am, 8-something a.m. on Sunday, wishing I was still asleep.  If my wonderful, sweetheart of a non-sleeping dog would've shut up instead of insisting I got up to take him out I would still be sleeping.  But anyway, I don't really feel like starting on my reading yet (even though I spent all day yesterday reading and still have a ridiculous amount left), so I thought this would be a good time to reflect on my first month of law school.  This will probably be another marathon post, so buckle up.  We are two days shy of it being one month since we started Orientation.  In a way it's gone by really quickly, like a blur.  But on the other hand, I feel like I've been in law school for much longer, which probably has a lot to do with the fact it's a summer session and we've covered almost 3/4 of a 14 week regular semester's worth of material in 4. What I can say for sure though is I definitely feel like I've known my classmates for more than a month.  I flipped open my cell phone yesterday afternoon and noticed that the last four people I'd talked to were people I didn't even know before this thing started.  If I feel like I know them all so well now I can't even imagine what it will be like after the spring.  The way law school (generally) works is that you are with your section of classmates your entire 1L year.  That means not only do we have every class together now, but we will this fall and next spring as well.  Actually, we will be split up into smaller groups for Research & Writing, but they will still be groups of only our class.  It's a lot like going back to elementary school.  We don't get to choose our classes, our professors, or even our class times.  We just log on to the computer (not-so-much like elementary I guess), view whatever schedule the registrar decided to give us, and show up to class.     Now this has the potential to be either really good or really bad--I actually think in some ways it will be both.  For the most part, I am quite happy with the people I've met.  They are smart, interesting, and fun.  However, being stuck in a class every day for an entire year with a handful of them will be just about as fun as cleaning a toilet or putting together a lawnmower (see the May archives).  I just can't see myself growing to like people who snicker when someone says the wrong thing or immediately begin flailing their arm in hopes the prof will let them correct their classmate or talk just to hear themselves talk.  It's great that you know the answer, but at least wait until the prof asks for someone else's opinion.  We are all in the same boat--get over yourselves!  You don't make yourself look cooler or smarter than that person you felt the need to belittle with your snickers or hand flailing.  I'm really hoping the rumors about the quiet people in the back row ending up with 3.75+ are true; and that the know-it-alls will see that their incessant ramblings amounted to a 2.0.  Actually, hopefully the quiet people (person) in the center of the third row will be the ones with 3.75s.  :)  The day grades come out will probably pretty shocking for a lot of people, myself included.  I'm not sure how often anything over a 3.5 happens in law school--not too much here at Stetson I don't think.  One person graduated summa cum laude last spring, and I've been told she was the first in almost 10 years or something outrageous like that.  Now receiving something less than a 3.5 certainly won't be shocking to me because I've never received a low GPA (there's always that 1.75 my first semester at UF), but I've definitely never put in this much work and received a low GPA.  Actually, I've never put in this much work period.  I've gotten plenty of 3.5+ semester GPAs and not put in a fraction of the work I do now.  To make matters worse, we aren't even ranked this summer so that 2.5, 2.75, whatever I get will mean virtually nothing since I won't know if that puts me in the bottom or the top of the class.  They've made some new change to the grading scale that the classes before us are pissed about (they moved the class average to a minimum 2.9 I think), so I guess that will be some kind of guideline.  Who knows.  Another thing I want to mention is how often my feelings about school seem to fluctuate.  I know that coming in here, and right after Orientation I was scared to death I wasn't going to be able to cut it.  It all seemed so intimidating and everyone seemed so smart.  Then my second week I was more confident about myself and my potential.  Now, pretty regularly, I seem to either feel really good about the way things are going, or really bad.  The added pressure of staying in the top third for scholarship purposes doesn't help much either.  The workload is crazy.  Even when you keep up with all of the reading (which is a task in itself) there is always something else I could be doing (and feel like everyone else is doing).  I could be outlining, or reading study guides, or making flashcards, or meeting with a Deans Fellow--always something.  I suppose it won't stop until 2 p.m. on July 15 when I turn in my 48-hour take home Torts exam.    I'm not sure that this post accomplished what I intended, but I know I wrote an awful lot so hopefully there's must be something useful in here.  I hope so.  Gotta run for now...the dog is calling again.

      I took this "Which Reality Show's Right for You" test on  urlLink tickle.com .  Here are my results:   American Idol   Stars aren't born they're created — just ask the Monkees. All you need is the big break and American Idol is it. Whether it was an impromptu serenade in the school cafeteria or the business presentation-turned-standup routine, you've always been a performer at heart.   Yeah, right!  The thought of performing anything (much less singing) on stage terrifies me.  It's strange though, in high school/middle school I loved being in front of a crowd.  Who knows what happened to that.  I dread going to school everyday because I hate the thought of a professor calling on me.  American Idol?  Come on.  The only singing I do is in the car, and even then I make sure the music is loud enough I don't have to hear myself.  :)  Check out that website--they've got some pretty funny tests.  I'll post another one later.  I've got to catch up on some sleep tonight.  We had our first big outing as a group last night--getting enough sleep was apparently not part of the agenda. We had a pretty damn good time.  Let's just say I was counting down the minutes in Crim Law today because I wasn't sure I was going to make it.  Hopefully I'll feel like a normal person again tomorrow.  Good night!

      I came up with this idea last night around 1 am while reading an article about rape laws.  While I won't bore you with the outrageous details of how a man can't really be prosecuted for rape unless he uses physically force during the commission of the act, I will tell you that I found a word in the article that I find really interesting.  It's not a new word to me--and I don't really know what I find so amusing about it--but for some odd reason I felt inclined to post about it.  (Maybe I should be concerned)  I thought it might be kind of cool to post a word once a week (or so).  It could be a new legal term I've learned, a funny word, a useless word, or just some random word, like this week, that I like for whatever strange and unexplainable reason.  So here you go:   Accost :  to approach and speak to often in a challenging or aggressive way.  Here's the sentence from the article, "Men today are free, as in the Illinois case, to take advantage of strangers the  accost  in isolated settings."  I don't really know why I find that word so cool, and I'm disappointed because I thought I was going to be able to do something funny with it but it's just not coming to me.  I'm beginning to realize this was a pretty pointless post, and I've now put off my Crim reading for an additional 20 minutes.  This may be the first and final word of the week!    Hopefully I'll think of something more fun to post about later.  Probably not though, since in the interim all I will be doing is reading about rape.  Not exactly hot comedy club material.  Of course, this isn't a comedy club either...

      This is probably a little premature, but I've been thinking lately about my plans for next summer.  For a law student, summers typically involve clerking at a law firm or taking additional classes.  The summer after your first year is the most flexible, but it's still good to add some work experience to your resume for the fall, which is when the On Campus Interview chaos begins.  Your 2L (second year) summer is of the ultimate importance because the goal is to have a summer associate position that leads to a permanent offer.  Then it's smooth sailing your third year.  Lucky for me, that's a way off.  I've got to decide what to do next summer.  I've always been interested in studying abroad, and I really wish I would have done it in undergrad.  This next summer is pretty much my last chance if I'm ever going to do it.  The study abroad programs at Tulane were one of the main reasons I decided to go there, so as you can see I've been thinking about this for awhile.  Stetson has a few programs--Tallinn, Estonia; Granada, Spain; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.  I'm sure they are great programs, but for some reason I can't get extremely excited about any one of them.  The good thing about study abroad programs (at least in law school, I don't know about undergrad) is that you can go with any law school.  That means I can still go to one of the Tulane programs, or any other for that matter.  I've narrowed down the list of countries in which I'm interested--England, Ireland, Greece, Germany, or Italy.  Some other countries like Switzerland or Norway would be cool but I can't find any programs there.  The University of Miami has an awesome "Mediterranean Experience" program that goes to Greece, Italy, and Spain.  Check it out  urlLink here .  That might be a little tiring though, moving around and having to study at the same time.  Florida State has a program at Oxford in England--just taking any courses at a college at Oxford would be awesome to put on a resume.  Here's the link to that  urlLink program .  The real jewel though has to be the program at  urlLink Tulane .  They offer 7 or 8 different locations, two of which I like very much.  First, a Greek Isles program; second, a program at Cambridge.  The second program has the prestigious name like FSU's Oxford program.  But one thing these programs have that the others don't?  Oh, they are just being taught by a couple of justices from that Court in Washington, D.C. called the United States Supreme Court.  Justice Scalia will be teaching a session in Rhodos, Greece; Chief Justice Rehnquist will be teaching at Cambridge.  I can't even begin to tell you how much that excites me.  While they aren't the only professors teaching, they do come in for a large chunk of the program.  I can't even fathom sitting in a classroom learning from a Supreme Court Justice on a daily basis.  They say you need to do something interesting your first summer so you can talk about it during your 2L fall interviews...  "So a, Ms. Boy is it?   (Yeah, it's Boy.  No, not Boyd, Boy.  As in boy/girl.  Yeah.)  What did you do over the summer?"  "Well, Mr. Interviewer, I learned Constitutional History at Cambridge from this guy named William Rehnquist, you may have heard of him..."  It's not guaranteed that they will be teaching next summer, but Tulane has a good history of Supreme Court Justices in their programs.  Generally you can find out before you sign up.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think that is an awesome opportunity.  I guess it kind of sounds like I've already made up my mind, doesn't it?  Well, then I've got to consider the money issue.  These programs run several thousand dollars I believe.  Plus, I have a mortgage payment that won't go away, and my dogs, and my family, friends, and boyfriend, etc.  However, I'm not borrowing very much in loans anyway because of my scholarship and familial support--I could borrow it in loans then pay it back when I (hopefully) get a good job.  You can't beat the student loan interest rate.  I'm sure someone could take care of paying my bills while I'm gone if I forward the mail somewhere.  What do people do with their houses if they leave for a long time?  I'm not really sure.  I guess I'd have someone come check on it every now and then.  I'm sure my mom would keep the dogs.  My friends and boyfriend could live without me for 6 weeks.  Actually, they are now (not the boyfriend, the friends) since I do nothing but school anyway.  One thing I really worry about is the possibility of something happening here and me being across the ocean and unable to get home quickly.  Accidents happen, my grandparents are getting older--I would never forgive myself if something happened and I couldn't be here.  That's the major downside to all of it.  At least if something happens now I'm only two hours away.  In Europe I'm probably a day away at best.    Then the other problem is not having any work experience.  In the ideal situation these programs would take place either at the very beginning or the very end of summer so I could work the other half.  Nope, most of them are smack dab in the middle.  I doubt I could get anyone to hire me (it's hard enough as a 1L anyway I'm told) if I said, "Yeah, I'll work for 3-4 weeks in June, then I'll be gone for 5-6, then back sometime in August."  Right.  So that's my other big concern.  I plan on talking with the career services director sometime this week about it.    Well, those are my (rather long, sorry) thoughts about studying abroad.  I should be thinking about Torts, but this is much more fun.  If anyone reading this has studied abroad (or knows someone who has) during law school I'd love to hear about it.  I've got several months to figure it out, but in the meantime it's a nice distraction.    Now that I've spent 30 minutes on this post, I better start outlining.  Yippee.

      Someone sent me a link to this website that, after a series of questions, proposes your "best place to live, work, and retire."  Here's my top three:  1.  Norfolk, VA " Heart of the Hampton Roads " 2.  Charlotte, NC " The Queen City " 3.  Richmond, VA " Rising Star of the South "  I found that odd for a lifelong Floridian who loves the beach.  Florida doesn't show up on the list until number 5, and it's Orlando " Florida's Entertainment Capital ".  I would NEVER want to live there permanently.  Florida's Tourist Capital is more appropriate--no thanks!  The only reason I want to stay in Florida is to be close to the beach, and Orlando certainly doesn't qualify.  Plus, the closest beach to Orlando is on the east coast, which I don't like either.  I prefer the west coast of Florida.  I guess I've been spoiled by Boca Grande.    Louisville, KY " Home of the Kentucky Derby " was in the top 10, as was Nashville, TN " Music City USA .  Tampa " Paradise on the Bay " came in at number 11.  That's good news, since I just bought a house in St Pete.  Charleston, SC " Cosmopolitan Southern City " was up there, which is a city I've heard wonderful things about but never visited.  I've heard it's like Savannah but prettier.  Maybe I'll try to go up there after school is out.  Then Miami " The Gold Coast " shows up.  You couldn't pay me enough money to live down there!  There's no way in hell I'm going to live in a place where the billboards say "We Speak English."  You're damn right you better speak English--last time I checked Miami was still in AMERICA!  I guess I'm being a little harsh, I do have some friends who are from Miami and love it, but it's just not for me.  Greenville, SC is also on there, and is called "Rising Star of the South."  See Richmond, above.  Guess there's two stars.  A few Texas cities are on there, but it's mostly North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.  And then Oklahoma City.  Yeah, I'll pack up and move there...it's SO close to the beach.  Anyway, if you want to do this test yourself click  urlLink here .  It's a pretty good way to waste a few minutes!

      All of that time spent on Res Ipsa Loquitor for nothing.  Apparently they didn't get to it in class the day I missed, so we covered it today.  Actually, we pretty much only talked about how we weren't going to cover it.  The prof says it's pretty useless and almost never comes around in real life--so glad I studied it, and understood it.  He even went as far as to say that if we used it more than once every 10 years in our career it would be malpractice.  This came after the first 15 minutes of class we spend watching a movie on Billy Joel.  Yep, Billy Joel.  The prof had been doing "a lot of thinking" about how to impart to us his feelings about the passing of both President Reagan and Ray Charles, and this video was his way of doing it.  The first part was a video of Joel and Charles recording the song Baby Grand.  The second part was his commentary on a song inspired by a Russian clown during the Cold War (can't remember the name unfortunately).  I really wish I could remember (that seems to be a recurring theme) what the prof said at the beginning, but he was asking our permission to devote the first part of our class to a humanity lesson or something like that.  It was touching, and definitely better than learning about limitations on duty.    Now it's almost 9 and I haven't done any studying.  I watched Oprah, took a nap, then went to the mall to meet a friend for Chic-fil-a.  Then of course I had to buy a shirt (it was only $7.00 though--I might go back and buy one in every color!).  My plan on this lovely Friday evening is to do all of my reading for Tuesday, then watch the Reagan funeral I recorded from earlier today.  Doesn't that sound like a wonderful way to kick off the weekend??

      I was going to completely remove the comments section since anyone can go on and post anonymously, which can be pretty dangerous I think, but now that I figured out I can go back and delete them if I want I'm going to leave it up.  Now you can say whatever you want without me knowing who you are...but I can delete it too!  If you really have something to say just send me an email.

      Have you ever actually paid attention to the word suggestions in Spell Check?  Since I have nothing to do this morning (I love to tell myself that), I actually paid attention.  Here's what it suggested for the first paragraph of my last post:  Torts should be replaced with "trots" Ybarra should be replaced with "eyebrow" Spangard should be replaced with "sponges" Appendectomy should be replaced with "appendicitis"  This is what it would read:  I'm sitting at my desk at home, waiting for my breakfast to finish cooking.  This is a problem.  I'm supposed to be sitting at my desk in "Trots" right now... An example (from "Eyebrow v Sponges") is a patient who is injured during surgery, while anesthetized.  The injury produced (to his shoulder) had nothing to do with the actual surgery ("appendicitis"), so someone was definitely negligent...There's your lesson in "Trots" for the day.   OK, so I thought it would be funnier than that.  Oh well.  I wonder why spell check has appendicitis and not appendectomy.    Time to be productive.

      I'm sitting at my desk at home, waiting for my breakfast to finish cooking.  This is a problem.  I'm supposed to be sitting at my desk in Torts right now, learning about Res Ipsa Loquitor.  Oops.  I've missed my first class now.  I'm ok with that though, I actually don't feel guilty.  I did all of the reading, and I can tell you that Res Ipsa Loquitor means "the thing speaks for itself."  It basically allows a jury to infer from circumstantial evidence that a defendant was negligent even when the plaintiff doesn't have specific allegations as to how the defendant was negligent.  An example (from  Ybarra v Spangard ) is a patient who is injured during surgery, while anesthetized.  The injury produced (to his shoulder) had nothing to do with the actual surgery (appendectomy), so someone was definitely negligent.  As you can imagine, it may be a little difficult for someone who was unconscious at the time of an injury to point out specifically who injured him and how.  In this case Res Ipsa Loquitor allowed him to bring each person in the operating room to court and force them to explain their conduct.  Isn't that wonderful?  There's your lesson in Torts for the day.   I had my first study group meeting last night.  It went ok.  I forgot to take my folder, my computer, and all of my notes.  Well, I didn't forget the computer, I intentionally left that.  The other things I accidentally left, which rendered me fairly useless to the process.  Hopefully it will be better on Monday, our next meeting.  We are going to do it at my house and order pizza, Chinese, or something.  Hopefully not pizza.  As 1Ls we have several mandatory meetings to attend throughout the semester, and each one attempts to be more enticing by advertising, "Lunch provided".  It's been pizza every time.  And not good pizza like Papa John's or Pizza Hut.  I'm pretty convinced it's something along the lines of Five Star.  Don't get me wrong--Five Star was great in undergrad at 4 a.m. after a  long night of partying.  Not so much anymore.  You'd think at a school where the tuition is close to 30k/year the food would be better.  I have been slacking on this blog also, I know.  I have all of these grand plans that just never seem to materialize.  I still have lots of posts planned, and several half-finished ones hanging out in my inbox.  Someday I'll get to them.  Until then, these random, pointless posts will have to do.  ;)

      I'm working on a post about the Myers-Briggs personality types, but I haven't had a chance to finish yet.  In the meantime, I thought I'd post a little test I came across in the process.  Does anyone remember the old spark.com?  Well, it has changed now but it still has some of the funny little quizzes on there (although the best one is gone).  I'm going to do a couple of them and post the results.  The first one is the "Death Test."  Yeah, that's really uplifting, right?  It's purpose is to ask a series of random questions like:   *When is your birthday?   *Do you smoke?   *Do you have a tattoo?   *Do you have any of the following illnesses--cancer, heart disease, head lice, hairy nipples, etc?   *Does your family suffer from the following--alcholism, cancer, mafia connections, insomnia, poor penmanship?   *How often do you--go hunting, talk to strangers, sky dive, drive a car, swallow knives, play drinking games, watch South Park, ride a mechanical bull?   *Are you good at math?   *Do you speed?   *Are you in the adult entertainment business?   *Are you paranoid?   *Do you cross when it says "Don't Walk?"  It then calculates the exact day on which you'll bite the dust.  As you can see, this is a wonderfully scientific examination I took.  My results?  I am going to die on October 20, 2039 at the tender age of 59.  I will most likely die from cancer.  They should put something a little funnier/less likely I think.  Even though it's a stupid test no one wants to hear that!  Random facts:   *The average life expectancy is 66.   *71% have hairy nipples.   *4040 people claim to have leprosy.  Wow, I thought I was relatively healthy and I don't even make it to retirement!  I'd hate to see the life expectancy of someone who checks mafia connections or that they swallow knives.  I guess I need to spend my Pfizer DRIP now, while I can!  No sense in letting it compound anymore if I won't be around to spend it.  If you want to determine your own date of death, go  urlLink here .  Please let me know so I can plan to send a card.  ;)  There's one more death countdown site  urlLink here .  This one gives me a little longer, until October 18, 2059.  At least then I'll be 79.  This one actually shows a countdown of your seconds left to live.  See how long you can watch it without feeling weird to know that your life (even though this is joke website) is ticking away.  Well, that's all for my little upbeat inspirational post this morning.  I've wasted about 480 seconds of my life typing this, so I'll get going now.   I'm going to do the wench test this afternoon.  Hehe.

      I've been reminded more than once that I haven't been very diligent about posting here, which to me means three very important things:   1.  People are reading this   2.  I'm not posting because I've been doing so much work   3.  People are reading this So I figured I'd get up early this morning and jot some thoughts down.  I've got a couple of different posts planned, including one about Myers Briggs Personality Types, that I hope to do this weekend.  Hope.    Anyway, so I'm now almost done with two weeks of law school.  Which, as I'm reminded every night when I look how far we've gotten in the books, is the equivalent of a month during a regular semester.  The bad thing is, I don't really feel like I've learned a month's worth of material.  It's very different, this law school thing.  It's definitely not like undergrad where you sit in a lecture for a few hours a week and then just regurgitate information on a few tests throughout the semester.    I suppose that once I actually have a chance to go back and look over the topics we've covered this feeling may be somewhat alleviated.  Now I barely have time throughout the week to keep up with all of the reading for class, much less time to go back and try to learn the stuff we've covered.  I'm pretty far ahead in the reading now so I plan to do a lot of that this weekend.  The two weeks has definitely not been a complete waste though.  I definitely feel like I've learned how to be a law student even if I haven't learned much substantive law.  I am getting more efficient with my reading and briefing.  I go to every class, every day.  I have figured out what kind of outlining works best for me.  I've gone to a professor's office hours.  I'm about to register for a bar prep course (you get major discounts for registering early--several hundreds off).  I've thought about my plans for next summer, graduation, and the future.  After many years of school (college included) I actually feel like I'm doing something useful, something that will hopefully have a big payoff in the end.  And the crazy thing is I'm actually enjoying it.  Don't get me wrong--it is unbelievably time consuming, by far the most I've ever worked in my life.  But I'm happy.  I wasn't sure if I would be able to say that.  I suppose that is more important (for now at least) than learning the elements of a tortious assault or a trespassory taking of property.  I enjoy law school.  I will post more soon, I promise.

      I went to Tire Kingdom today get an alignment, an&nbsp;oil change,&nbsp;and&nbsp;new tires put on my car (Poppie will be happy!).&nbsp; Of course I didn't get out of there without being offered a million other things (I actually didn't intend on having the alignment done either, but of course I  really  needed it, what with those expensive tires I had to get).&nbsp; I now have some kind of special warranty on my tires, free rotation/balancing for a year, and who knows what else.&nbsp; I hate dealing with car issues on my own -- it seems like they always try to take advantage of women.&nbsp; It seems like every time I get the oil changed I need a new air filter or transmission fluid or fuel injection something-or-other.&nbsp; Yuck.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; Anyway, a solid two and a half hours and $404 later I was on my way.&nbsp;   I knew it would take forever, so I began reading  The Lovely Bones .&nbsp; I didn't get through enough to give a complete&nbsp;review, but so far so good.&nbsp; It's about a young girl who is murdered and her experiences in heaven.&nbsp; It's very well written (it has some great vocabulary!) and easy to read.&nbsp; I'll report back when I finish (assuming I finish--I doubt I'll be doing a lot of reading in Key West this weekend).&nbsp;   Speaking of Key West, this Thursday I embark on a girls' trip to the Keys.&nbsp; We are staying on Duval Street (the heart of the party zone).&nbsp; It should be quite interesting, and I'm extremely excited.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll have some good stories to tell when I return.&nbsp;   Only three weeks to go until fall semester begins...

      As you know, I've recently completed my first summer semester of law school.&nbsp; Now I know it's not a  real  semester that entails juggling 4 classes *and* research & writing -- but it was definitely a start, and I think I have some useful advice for people who haven't been through any type of law school semester.&nbsp; Here we go...   1.&nbsp;  Buy a good,  light &nbsp;laptop .&nbsp; Even if you don't think you'll lug it around a lot, chances are you will.&nbsp; I took class notes on mine about half of the time, but I  always  carried it to class and the library.&nbsp; I can't explain how many times I heard someone complain that their laptop was too heavy.&nbsp; The most common type at my school is the new Dell Inspiron.&nbsp; Mine is a Fujitsu Lifebook, and I absolutely love it.&nbsp; It's quite small, has a great keyboard and weighs less than five pounds.&nbsp; If you haven't purchased a laptop yet, check it out.&nbsp;   2.&nbsp;  AIM has big pros and cons .&nbsp; Midway through the semester my friends and I began using AIM during class and while we were studying in the library.&nbsp; The cons are probably obvious -- it's very easy to get distracted, both in class and in the library.&nbsp; If your professor calls on people at random I wouldn't recommend it, because sometimes I got so caught up in my IMs I had no clue as to what was going on in class.&nbsp; Similarly, in the library I would have multiple IMs going with my classmates (who were usually also in the library), and I would waste an hour or more at a time.&nbsp; The pros of AIM -- well, if you do happen to get called on in class you will often be bombarded by answers via&nbsp;IM in case you are totally lost.&nbsp; One of my good friends got called on in Torts one day and soon several of our friends' IM screens popped up with "Help!" to which people obliged, of course.&nbsp; In the library, it's good to have IM if you have a question for someone or want to take a break or go to lunch, etc.&nbsp; You don't have to get up and search for someone...you have them right there on your buddy list.&nbsp; Or if you are like me and skip class every once in awhile (and it's not like I skip to go to the beach or sleep or something fun like that -- I was usually in the library when I skipped), you can IM people who are actually  in  class that day.&nbsp; A friend and I were in a study room during Criminal Law one day and the professor called on me.&nbsp; Immediately I received three IMs (he received a couple as well) from various people telling me all about it.&nbsp; How great is that?   3.&nbsp;  Get into a routine .&nbsp;&nbsp;What works for you will&nbsp;certainly differ from what works for me, but definitely try to get your studying down to a routine.&nbsp; For class preparation, I would read about the topic for the next class in a study guide and take some notes (on my computer).&nbsp; Then, I would read  and &nbsp;brief each case (also on the computer), and&nbsp;print out my notes and briefs so I could have them in my folder for the next class. &nbsp;I would often handwrite my class notes directly on my briefs, unless we were going so quickly I had to type them.&nbsp; On the weekends I would go back through the week's cases/notes and put them in my outline.&nbsp; Of course I slacked a bit from time to time, but generally this is what I did.&nbsp; I know some people who never briefed a case (or book briefed) and some who didn't make outlines.&nbsp; Don't feel pressured to do what someone else is doing, and don't feel silly if they make fun of you for continuing to brief cases (yep, it happens).&nbsp; Do what works for you.   4.&nbsp;  Supplemental materials .&nbsp; This is a big issue -- some people love them, some don't.&nbsp; I was one of the people who had  way  too many of them.&nbsp; DO NOT do this.&nbsp; With the exception of case brief guides that are keyed to your book,  do not  buy any study guide before you begin school.&nbsp; They are all so different it will be impossible to gauge which one will be useful in your class.&nbsp; As for the case brief guides/outlines (like High Court Case Summaries, Legalines, etc), if you can find one that is keyed to your textbook I think they are useful.&nbsp; I would absolutely  not recommend  slacking off so much that you do not read the cases and only read these condensed versions (as some of my friends did), but they can really aid you in seeing what is important from a case and what you should have gotten from it, especially in the beginning when you really have no idea.&nbsp; You have endless other opportunities for study guides -- wait and see which will be helpful for your particular course before buying them all.&nbsp; I have (for both Torts and Crim) Gilberts, Examples & Explanations, and the Understanding series.&nbsp; After the first week I never cracked Gilberts, and hardly used the E&E Torts.&nbsp; The Understanding series was quite good (better for Torts than Crim) and the E&E Criminal Law was great.&nbsp; Check out your library before you go off on a spending spree, they will often have copies in there (if you can look at them before your classmates confiscate them).&nbsp; Finally, I  really &nbsp;liked the Sum & Substance Criminal Law CDs.&nbsp; They are read by Joshua Dressler, who authored my book.&nbsp; It's great to have them for a car ride or while you are working out so you don't feel guilty for wasting time.&nbsp; You can find these CDs for most (if not all) of your first year courses.&nbsp; Check for all of this supplemental material on eBay or half.com, you can almost always find what you need and save a lot of money.   5.&nbsp;  Be prepared for high school all over again .&nbsp; I didn't believe it when people told me it would be like high school, but it really is.&nbsp; Think about it...you are in the  same  classes every day with the  same  people (which I guess makes it kind of like elementary school actually--at least you change classes in high school).&nbsp; You study with them.&nbsp; You have lunch with them.&nbsp; You party with them.&nbsp; You worry about exams with them.&nbsp; You experience something with them that your friends/family outside of law school cannot understand.&nbsp; I've known my classmates for less than three months, yet I can tell you something interesting (or maybe not interesting, but something at least) about almost every single one of them.&nbsp; I could tell you  really &nbsp;interesting things about a lot of them.&nbsp; Countless long-term relationships have broken up.&nbsp; Many people have hooked up.&nbsp; Lots of people have gotten really drunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those last two are probably in the wrong order.&nbsp; You get the point.&nbsp; Don't make the mistake of doing something you don't want your classmates (and future colleagues) to know about because they will.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like high school, the rumor mill&nbsp;thrives.&nbsp;    **Bonus .&nbsp; Enjoy it!&nbsp; Let yourself have fun.&nbsp; Go to the school sponsored parties.&nbsp; Go out when people go, as much as you can without getting behind.&nbsp; Actually, it's ok if you get behind once or twice.&nbsp; You have to remember to enjoy it.&nbsp; I worked much harder than I ever did in college, but I think I had more fun too.&nbsp; That's saying a lot coming from a party school like the University of Florida.&nbsp; It's a different kind of party than undergrad, but it can be so much fun.&nbsp;  Meet people! &nbsp; I can't stress this enough.&nbsp; Please make friends with your classmates.&nbsp; You will be stuck with them every day for at least your first year, and often after that I'd imagine.&nbsp; I already feel like I've made good friends just in this short summer semester.&nbsp; Don't neglect your old friends though.&nbsp; I wasn't particularly good at this one, but don't allow yourself to get so caught up in your new law school life that you forget about your friends and family.&nbsp; Return their calls, and call them sometimes.&nbsp; You may have to explain the same things about law school a million times, but do it (or make them read your blog!).&nbsp;   Ultimately, be prepared to work harder than you probably ever thought you would, but be open to the fun side of law school as well.&nbsp; It's a great experience, it really is.&nbsp; Work hard, play hard.&nbsp; Mostly work though.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I have a completely different perspective than I did when I entered, thank goodness.&nbsp; I thought it would be hell, which it can be sometimes, but is not overall.&nbsp;   There are certainly many other things I'd like to post about, but this is already ridiculously long so I'll stop.&nbsp; Good luck to everyone who begins in the fall!

      It took me almost five days to get motivated enough to post my thoughts about ending my first week of exams.  I think my previous post "Panic" pretty well sums up my feelings on my Criminal Law exam, so I guess now I need to reflect on my Torts exam.    As you know, my Torts final was a 48-hour take-home essay exam.  At my last post I was 18 hours into the exam, and hadn't done much with it except write down page numbers of various cases I wanted to use.  Big mistake.  I didn't really even get started until around 1:30 that day, giving me about 24 hours in which to complete 10 questions.  Big mistake.  Big mistake!!  I slept for about 2 hours that day, but I finished.  I turned it in (13.5 pages) with 10 minutes to spare.  I think my printer worked slower than ever that day -- I was worried that I wouldn't make it on time.    You'd think that most normal people would immediately go home and take a nap.  Nope, not me.  My group of friends already had a party going across the street from school (it started around noon, for the non-slackers who turned their papers in early).  We consumed lots of beer and played some silly games.  Some of the guys swam in a little kiddie pool.  We then went to a bar on St. Pete Beach for the remainder of the night.  I haven't been posting because pretty much all I've done since that night is sleep.  Off and on at least, intermingled with some driving, shopping, and eating.  But I've slept more since Friday than I had in probably three weeks.  It's been great.  Really great.  I'm still not feeling motivated to do much of anything...but luckily I don't have to feel guilty about it anymore.  All I have to do now is sit and wait for my grades.  The professors have until Aug 9 -- the waiting is going to be just-so-much-freaking-fun, I-love-having-to-check-every-single-day-for-three-weeks.  Vomit.    When I get so inspired (hopefully tomorrow), I'll post some general thoughts about my first semester.  I promise it won't be another five days -- I have no more excuses!  :)

      Is that what everyone does after taking their first law school exam?  I would like to think so, since that is certainly how I felt yesterday.  After spending over 12 hours in the library Monday, I was sure I knew my criminal material at least as well if not better than the rest of my classmates (which is the standard I've come to desire here at law school--no more wishing to be top of the class...average-plus will do just fine).  We took the three-hour closed book exam yesterday morning.  It has 60 multiple choice questions and a two hour essay.  I felt really confident about the multiple choice questions until the exam was over and we all began discussing questions (not recommended, by the way, for benefit to your sanity).  I learned that I had missed at least two ridiculously easy questions like:      How many jurors were on jury at common-law?      What theory of punishment would support FL's 3 strikes rule? I wanted to kick myself (or worse).  That doesn't even include my panic about the essay exam.  Eight of us went to lunch after the test was over (also a big mistake) and of course we had the "did you see this issue, or that issue?  Oh shit, I missed that!" discussion.  I missed a big defense issue--a limitation on the felony-murder rule called Res Gestae.  It's pretty disappointing considering the fact that I knew those rules incredibly well.  It may have something to do with the fact that it took me about 15 minutes to figure out that one of the deaths fell under the F-M rule.  I thought (and even wrote) for 14 too many minutes trying to figure out with what kind of homicide to charge one of the felons--it wasn't an intentional killing so I tried to say it was a 2nd-degree intent to inflict serious bodily harm homicide.  Several sentences in I realized it was glaringly obvious that it was a felony murder.  I also confused fraud-in-the-factum and fraud-in-the-inducement (dealing with rape).  It was a case of mistaken spousal identity that in early CL was dealt with as inducement but is now considered by most courts to be factum.  I missed that on the multiple choice as well.  It's so discouraging when you really know something and then still do it wrong.  OK, I don't want to talk about it anymore...that whole panic feeling is starting to return.  I chose to use the subject line "Panic" for this post because that is the most appropriate word I could think of to describe how I felt about my first ever law school exam.  Panic--before, during, and after.  I'm now almost 18 hours into my 48-hour take home Torts exam.  I thought I would fair better on this exam since I like to write and have ample time in which to do it--but we were informed that the professor did not care about our opinion, we were to answer directly from case law.  I can definitely understand his reasoning for that, but it kind of takes the fun out of it.  Oh well, I suppose I better get to work.  Fun, fun.

      We received an email a few days ago from one of the deans here on campus.  Here's an excerpt:   Dear students:  I hope that no one needs to use this policy, but it is there if the worst occurs.  Policy: Any request, or other relief regarding examinations, that may involve retaking an examination based upon a claim of physical, mental or emotional illness or  distress  at the time of taking the original examination (from which relief is sought) must be made before the commencement of such examination or at such other time as may be permitted under extraordinary circumstances, but in no event later than the date the examination grade is posted.   I found this to be interesting--the fact that law school exams can be so stressful that a school has a policy set in case someone becomes so out of their mind they cannot take the exam.  Now, I realize how much we have riding on these tests--the entire grade is based upon one test; our first year grades are the most important in finding our second year summer associate posistion (and ultimately a permanent position); selection for Law Review is based upon first year grades--you get the point...but does anyone ever really freak out so much it becomes physically impossible for them to take an exam?    Maybe there is something wrong with me (and the majority of my friends).  I haven't encountered anyone (yet) who is incredibly stressed out.  Here I am, in Boca Grande at the beach--yeah, I'm studying but I'm not holed up in the library 24/7 (which is impossible since it's only open until 12).  I justified my driving time by listening to the  Sum & Substance Criminal Law CDs , which are read by the author of my book (Dressler) and are pretty damn good.  Granted I get a little distracted at times by scenery, other cars, or my own random thoughts, but I still feel like I'm being productive.  I went to bed around midnight last night and slept for 8 hours.  Maybe I'm too relaxed, I don't know.  I guess I'll find out when I get my grades.  Luckily, if I learn that I need to be a little more uptight to get better grades I can change my outlook while I only have two grades riding on an exam week instead of five.  I suppose now I should quit musing about my lack of stress in studying for exams and start actually studying, as to prevent the possibility of an impending freak out.  :)  I'll post more later.

      You would think that with my first final exam week approaching so very rapidly I would have lots and lots of things about which I'd be motivated to write.  Nope.  I just don't.  In fact, I don't feel motivated to do very much of anything.  It's almost 10 a.m., I have class at 2, and I don't feel motivated to do the reading.  I've found it quite hard lately do make myself do new reading when all I really want to do (school-wise at least) is study for exams.  I have two next week.  My first is a three hour closed book Criminal Law exam at 9 on Tuesday.  I pick up the second, a 48-hour take home Torts exam, at noon after the Crim exam.  The torts exam is due Thursday at 2.  I suppose that really gives us 50 hours.  I wonder how many of my classmates will sleep during that time.  We are going to be given 7-8 hypotheticals, each of which we are limited to 2 pages of discussion.  It certainly sounds like a lot--14 to 16 pages in two days, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a difficult time condensing everything to 2 pages per hypo.  If I don't answer my phone or return calls during that period, please don't be alarmed--not only am I not on the phone, I'm probably not eating, sleeping, or showering.  Well, I'm sure I'll eat and shower at least...not so sure about the sleeping though.  I guess we'll see.    I'm going to Boca Grande this weekend (my favorite place on the planet).  I just feel like I need to get away from here.  At home it's impossible not to get distracted, and even at the library everyone is around so it's difficult not to stop and chat.  I studied for the LSAT in Boca Grande, so at least I know I can do it.  You can't beat sitting at a table looking out at the ocean.  It's distracting, yes, but in a very calming way.  Plus, I have 7.25 hours of Criminal Law CDs to which I can listen during the drive and during any laying out I decide to do.  I won't feel guilty for wasting the time driving since I'll have those.  I'm pretty darn excited about it actually, and if we weren't having a review in Crim (and if I hadn't missed the max in Torts) I'd leave today instead of tomorrow.  But I suppose I can suffer through 3 more classes--how crazy, only three classes until my first semester is finished.  I know it's not a real semester--but hey, it's a start.  OK, enough procrastinating for now.  I've got to learn about solicitation.

      Yes, I am still alive.  I have been living at the library--I spent 12 hours there three times last week.  Isn't that sad?  Of course the entire time was not spent studying--I get distracted rather easily be email or IM or random things I decide I just  have  to look up online (like study guides for next semester or new songs to download or directions on how to grill a steak {even though I don't have a grill!}).  But anyway, the point is that I have been busy preparing for finals.  I have 8 days until my first, so I will probably be MIA a lot this week.  I will try to post a longer message tomorrow.  I hope everyone has a good 4th of July!

      What on earth is going on with my counter?  Last week I checked (yes, even though I didn't post...shame on me) and the counter said around 1100 hits.  Now it says over  93,000 .  I don't understand -- and I'm relatively sure it's impossible.  I can't imagine having that many hits in just a week even if multiple people linked to me.   On another note, I just haven't been doing much of anything and therefore haven't been motivated to post anything.  I will get my second grade tomorrow though (I got the first about two weeks ago) so I will post about that tomorrow evening.  Grades in law school suck.  I'm definitely not looking forward to going back now...but I'll post more about that later.  If anyone has any ideas about the counter, please let me know.
