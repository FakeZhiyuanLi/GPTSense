      I find it disheartening that McCain-Feingold ever saw the light of day.  That is did raises questions of our ability as a nation to protect speech, liberty and freedoms.  George Will's Column today is mindful that if you run a business and your name is associated with it, then when running for public office, any ads run to advertise it constitute a violation of McCain-Feingold.  So were John Deere still with us, he could not run for Senate and then also advertise his tractors and mowers 30 days prior to the election.  Effectively shutting down his business and making strong candidates think twice about putting their hat into the public arena.  Those are just the people Conservatives laud since they worked hard to make a living and become successes.  Liberalism has succeeded at that point and stupid Conservatives want McCain to replace Cheney on the ticket. Spare the thought.  In other news, now the WaPost seems to be admitting two things: it is for Kerry and makes a case against Kerry.  urlLink Swift VET ARTICLE   Christmas in Cambodia  December 1968  What Kerry has said:  Over the years, he has repeatedly said he was illegally ordered into Cambodia during Christmas 1968. Last week, his campaign issued a statement saying he was in Cambodia but did not specify a date.  What his challengers say:  At the time, Kerry was stationed in an area about 50 miles from the Cambodian border, and he never entered that country then or at any other time during his service in Vietnam.  What available military records say:  Kerry’s boat at the time, PCF-44, was 40 to 50 miles south of the Cambodian border at 7 a.m. on Christmas Eve. With a cruising speed of 23 knots, the boat could have reached the border in about two hours, but there is no archival evidence it did so.   No evidence he did.  Then there is this:  An investigation by The Washington Post into what happened that day suggests that both sides have withheld information from the public record and provided an incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate, picture of what took place. But although Kerry's accusers have succeeding in raising doubts about his war record, they have failed to come up with sufficient evidence to prove him a liar.  I think the above does that efficiently enough that they don't have to "prove" him a liar.  He did that himself.  Right Bomb?  Update:  This adds new meaning to the phrase "vote early and often".  One way to steal an election is to have many of your voters vote in NY AND Fla.  Wow, did the DNC authorize this as common practice?  urlLink Exposed: the Scandal of Double Voters  I guess liberals realize they lose at the ballot box more often than not so they have to practice stealing them and evidently have it down to perfection.  What Elections official checks the roster in Broward County and then double checks it in say...north NY State?  They don't.  So the Democrats have unmitigated license to cheat.  They will.  It IS in the playbook.

      Venezuela's ruler, Hugo Chávez, apparently survived a recall vote on Sunday, but widespread allegations of fraud are casting serious doubt on the results. This didn't stop Jimmy Carter, who was in Venezuela as an election observer, from endorsing Chávez's "victory." Of course, this is the same Jimmy Carter who once said to Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu: "Our goals are the same, to have a just system of economics and politics. . . . We believe in enhancing human rights . . . [and] the freedom of our own people." (Hat tip: Joshua Muravchik, who includes the quote in his devastating "Presidential Leadership" chapter on Carter.)  Yesterday  urlLink Gail Collins's New York Times editorial board  declared not only that Chávez was the legitimate winner but that it will brook no dissent on the question:    It is time for President Hugo Chávez's opponents to stop pretending that they speak for most Venezuelans. They do not, as the failure of a recall referendum, promoted by the opposition, decisively demonstrated on Sunday. . . . The opposition . . . needs to stop shouting foul.    This editorial ran three days after the Venezuela vote. Meanwhile, after more than three years, the Times is still shouting foul over America's 2000 election. Today, 1,381 days after George W. Bush's victory, the Times begins its lead editorial this way:    One of the scandals of the last presidential election was the large number of voters who were denied the right to vote because of foul-ups in the election system, like errors in the voting rolls or problems in directing voters to their correct polling places.    The editors of the Times' Paris edition, known as the International Herald Tribune, dutifully published the  urlLink Venezuela editorial yesterday . At the same time, they defied New York's no-dissent diktat, publishing an op-ed piece by  urlLink Enrique ter Horst , a Venezuelan lawyer and political analyst, who writes from Caracas that "the perception that a massive electronic fraud led to President Hugo Chávez's mandate not being cut short in the recall referendum on Sunday is rapidly gaining ground in Venezuela":    All exit polls carried out on the day had given the opposition an advantage of between 12 percent and 19 percent. But preliminary results announced by the government-controlled National Electoral Council at 3:30 a.m. gave Chávez 58.2 percent of the vote, against 41.7 percent for the opposition. . . .  Two days after the referendum, . . . evidence is growing that the software of the touch-screen voting machines had been tampered with. The opposition has requested that the votes be recounted manually and that the boxes holding the voting papers, currently stored in army garrisons, be put under the custody of international observers. . . .  This is not just another election in a country where political actors abide by democratic rules and civilized behavior. It is an election where a choice of society is being made, and where one side is prepared to use any method to remain in power, even elections if it is assured of "winning" them.    In today's Wall Street Journal,  urlLink Thor Halvorssen  gives a chilling account of some of the Chávez regime's methods:    On Monday afternoon, dozens of people assembled in the Altamira Plaza, a public square in a residential neighborhood here that has come to symbolize nonviolent dissent in Venezuela. The crowd was there to question the accuracy of the results that announced a triumph for President Hugo Chávez in Sunday's recall referendum.   Within one hour of the gathering, just over 100 of Lt. Col. Chávez's supporters, many of them brandishing his trademark army parachutist beret, began moving down the main avenue towards the crowd in the square. Encouraged by their leader's victory, this bully-boy group had been marching through opposition neighborhoods all day. From afar they began to taunt the crowd in the square, chanting, "We own this country now," and ordering the people in the opposition crowd to return to their homes. . . . The Chávez group threw bottles and rocks at the crowd. Moments later a young woman in the square screamed for the crowd to get down as three of the men with walkie-talkies, wearing red T-shirts with the insignia of the government-funded "Bolivarian Circle," revealed their firearms. They began shooting indiscriminately into the multitude.  A 61-year-old grandmother was shot in the back as she ran for cover. The bullet ripped through her aorta, kidney and stomach. She later bled to death in the emergency room. An opposition congressman was shot in the shoulder and remains in critical care. Eight others suffered severe gunshot wounds. Hilda Mendoza Denham, a British subject visiting Caracas for her mother's 80th birthday, was shot at close range with hollow-point bullets from a high-caliber pistol. She now lies sedated in a hospital bed after a long and complicated operation. She is my mother.    Chávez's goons clearly agree with the Times that "the opposition . . . needs to stop shouting foul," though in fairness Collins & Co. do not expressly endorse shooting people in order to make it so.  One of the Times' complaints about U.S. elections is that many states disfranchise would-be voters who've been convicted of a felony. "Denying the vote to ex-offenders is antidemocratic," the paper announced in a  urlLink July editorial . In Venezuela, it seems criminals are so empowered that they actually run the country. By the Times' standards, we guess that makes Venezuela more democratic than America. And if you don't agree, Gail Collins would like to invite you to kindly shut up.   Today's Electoral College update:  urlLink MIT saves EC  Great article.  Bookmark it.  And today's Blood boiler:  urlLink MSNBC Transcript of Chris Matthew's Campaign for Kerry   urlLink Malkin Slams back   I used to respect Chris Matthew's, but the closer we get to election day, the more partisan and abrasive he seems to become.  He has become a shill for the sKerry Campaign and that is not good journalism.  He is also becoming sloppy, narrow-minded, and increasingly bitter that a Democrat does not Rule the Country the way he wants it.  The man needs a sedative. Doc

      Yes, Kerry has been nailed on Cambodia, but the medals were going to be tough to question for many reasons. But, it seems as if Kerry might have inadvertantly questioned one of his Purple Hearts. Captain Ed  urlLink has a post on this , and he concludes:     So now Kerry not only won commendations at a rate which threatened to outstrip Audie Murphy (literally) but also managed to win a combat award a week before he saw combat. Now we can understand the reluctance of his superiors to award the first Purple Heart; even John Kerry admitted in his own writing that he didn't deserve it. It takes a gross stupidity or an unbelievable egomania for Kerry to think that no one would cross-reference dates between his journal and the service record he had posted on his site in order to boost his credentials for the presidency! Not to mention a fecklessness bordering on incompetence for his biographer, Douglas Brinkley, who at last report was busy trying to rescue the Cambodian Christmas myth for the New Yorker.    Do the lies ever end for Kerry?     They don't, but the left is not concerned about lies. That's why you know they are being dishonest when they accuse Bush of lying. Lies are their least concern. Go see Captain Ed's post. Very interesting.  UPDATE:  urlLink Neal Boortz  is on to this as well.

      Just what do most veterans think of Kerry? Well, we can only guess at that. But the media has assumed that his war exploits would play well with the veteran crowd. I don't think they are. His speech today at a VFW provides a damning image that many aren't buying his BS.     Are these guys, with their backs to Kerry, just more Republican operatives, like those swiftboat vets? These guys possess the credentials that Kerry has been running on. Yet the left will be quick to smear these guys, questioning their honor. Well, I think they've been through a lot more than the Dem hacks can hand to them. Still, it is sad to see people who fought for our freedom attacked for their political beliefs, or even their personal beliefs (assuming a lot of these vets are Democrats, which happens to be true).  urlLink   urlLink

      Doc pointed us to an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune from the authors of Powerline Blog.  That sent me to check their blog, and they have a posting up on Tom Harkin's charge against Dick Cheney.  I have a lot to say on this one, and I'll address it when I have a chance.  This one makes me very angry, and I will explain that in detail.  Until then,  urlLink check them out  as the quote from ubberblogger Glenn Reynolds.

      The Cambodia saga continues, and Hugh Hewitt keeps the focus where it belongs. It seems that just a short while ago, Kerry was claiming to be a  urlLink gun runner . The mainstream media continues to let Kerry write his own history, despite the fact that a short search of history shows him to be a liar. With the hundreds of thousands of people who are employed by the American media, they all are getting scooped by free-lancers with an internet connection.  Now that Kerry is caught in an obvious lie, we hear the lament that this campaign is not about the issues. Kerry's entire campaign was never about issues. Where has that lament been throughout Kerry's run? Nowhere until now. Very telling.  UPDATE: Doc just put a great article in the comments section.  It's an opinion piece in my hometown liberal fish wrap.  Here's the  urlLink link .  Enjoy!

      Once in awhile you run across things that just make you believe that you are right about things.  So I give you today's Federalist Notes.  What I find funny is that the deconstruction of Kerry is slowly unfolding and I think so is his last chance to move up 2 seats to President.  THE FOUNDATION  "Were we directed from Washington when to sow, and when to reap, we should soon want bread." --Thomas Jefferson  ______----********O********----______ INSIGHT  "That which seems to be the height of absurdity in one generation often becomes the height of wisdom in the next." --John Stuart Mill  ______----********O********----______ IChThUS IMPRIMIS  "The Christian faith has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult and left untried." --G.K. Chesterton  ______----********O********----______ FAMILY  "[Thursday] the California Supreme Court fulfilled their duty by enforcing the law and nullifying the illegitimate marriage licenses handed out to thousands of same-sex couples exactly six months ago in San Francisco.  Today's ruling reinforces once again that when one rogue mayor or any other elected official ignores the rule of law, they will be held accountable.  Over sixty percent of Californians voted to define marriage as the union between one man and one woman.  Today the Court upheld the law as it is written and has set a shining example for courts across the nation." --Tony Perkins (note: great thought that a judiciary actually FOLLOWED what the people of a state made into law and not rewritten it in their own image) ______----********O********----______ CULTURE  "What MTV is selling, besides music, movies, and soft drinks, is a socially liberal worldview in which personal autonomy, especially in sexual matters, is the highest good.  And it's in a unique position to succeed in its mission because, as Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone has written, MTV has been 'handed endless generations of young people who are blank slates.'  Of course, kids are not supposed to be 'blank slates.'  Parents, communities, and churches are supposed to teach them what they need to know and believe. MTV's success is proof of how the Church...has failed in its most basic mission.  It's also a challenge to all of us as Christian parents.  We need to know who we're up against.  We need to know what our kids are being taught during school and after school. The lessons go far beyond how to spend their disposable income; they go all the way to 'how now shall we live?'" --Chuck Colson (note: Isn't that why they are called young skulls full of mush?) ______----********O********----______ LIBERTY  "Every decent American ought to be thoroughly outraged by what has transpired in response to the ads being run by those Swift Boat veterans contesting John Kerry's accounts of his heroics during Vietnam.  Rather than merely refute their claims, dark forces are working to suppress their efforts to speak out on this subject.  Unfortunately, with too few Americans understanding the threat posed by those who would forcibly subdue others with whom they disagree, the reaction to this infuriating episode has been minimal. ... When was the notion established that free speech must pass some government test for accuracy in order to be permissible?  Is it John McCain alone who should have the final say as to who can speak in public and who cannot, based solely on his arrogant assessment of the worthiness or accuracy of their statements?  McCain's vindictiveness towards the veterans, based not on their real credibility but instead on their previous association with others who had worked to thwart his political ambitions, is indicative of the very seed of tyranny that the founders most feared.  Clearly, the framers of the First Amendment crafted it in such a manner as to ensure that individuals such as John McCain would never have the prerogative to use the laws of an out-of-control government to subdue their opposition." --Christopher Adamo (note: But I thought McCain-Feingold was supposed to help us?  Errr, maybe it was the incumbents it was supposed to help...) ______----********O********----______ THE GIPPER  "One thing our Founding Fathers could not foresee...was a nation governed by professional politicians who had a vested interest in getting reelected.  They probably envisioned a fellow serving a couple of hitches and then looking...forward to getting back to the farm." --Ronald Reagan  ______----********O********----______ OPINION IN BRIEF  "How many times have we been told that George W. Bush 'squandered' the good will of the world 'community' after 9/11?  The assumption behind all of this seemed to be that anything which cost America the support of allies like France or Germany was, in effect, too costly.  In other words, the means -- 'strong alliances' -- are more important than the ends -- winning the war on terror, toppling Saddam, and so forth.  Listening to these folks, one gets the sense that America's greatest foreign policy triumph was to get sucker-punched on 9/11 because it resulted in sympathetic newspaper headlines in Paris and Berlin. ... Now, there is one caveat to the Kerry Doctrine of international hand-holding. If America is attacked, he says he wouldn't hesitate to respond with force.  That's nice, I guess.  But what else is he going to say?  'If America is attacked, I promise to play Boggle in the Oval Office!'  He makes it sound like he's the first President to have the courage to commit to a policy of retaliation to attacks. Has any president actually rejected such a policy?  Kerry promises 'I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.'  Again, great.  But no major candidate has ever promised to do otherwise.  More importantly, the UN wouldn't need to have a veto over our national security with a President Kerry in office, since no situation obviously meets his standards for force except a direct attack. ... [F]or Kerry, no goal is worth losing allies, because keeping allies is Kerry's only goal." --Jonah Goldberg (note: Kerry promises to not attack Rocky Road ice cream.  It's still safe to eat at Hagen Daaz.) ______----********O********----______ GOVERNMENT  "The federal government owns nearly 33 percent of all the land in the United States.... Socialists, progressives...and environmental organizations have no problem with federal ownership of land. In fact, in recent years, they have sponsored legislation and programs to buy more and more private property to expand the federal inventory.  These people forgot, or choose to reject, a fundamental principle recognized by America's founders: prosperity arises from private enterprise, and private enterprise arises from private property.  This nation's prosperity is tied directly to private enterprise.  As the misguided policy of government ownership and control of land expands, prosperity, inevitably, must diminish.  Even more important is the loss of individual freedom, as government expands the scope of its control. ... There is nothing the federal government does with its land that could not be done better by the states, or by private owners within the states.  It's time for Uncle Sam to get out of the real estate business, and return its land to the states, and to the private owners who hold the key to our nation's future." --Henry Lamb  ______----********O********----______ BUSH CAMPAIGN JOURNAL  "There are times when, given the political climate in the country, President Bush must wonder why anyone would want the job as President.  When things go wrong on his watch, of course he gets the blame and that is to be expected.  Yet, when things go right, he hardly ever gets the credit.  The mainstream media looks for any reason to discredit Bush and his capable administration. It is little wonder that half the country now gets much of their news from the Internet, talk radio and the Fox News Channel. At least the President gets a fair shake in these outlets. One can only wonder what the President's numbers would be like if the other half of the nation got information from media which was fair to the President.  Maybe we would not be such a closely divided nation after all." --Paul M. Weyrich  ______----********O********----______ JFK DEMO-LITION DERBY  "After listening to John Kerry's acceptance address...I did a little experiment. ... I edited out phony religiosity and pointless political platitudes of the sort that could be used by any politician in any situation, including Hitler (i.e., "We're the optimists").  I also chopped out all gratuitous flag-waving all forced and hollow tough-talking, and all draping of the clearly unworthy self in the ill-fitting cloak of the great figures of history.  Further down the line were the intellectual crimes. Lies went out right away, but I also cut out things that were not lies exactly, but mere words.  Also banished were the many species of literary fraud -- from facile generalizations to redundancies to such crass, hypersentimental, factory-generated cliches as 'trees [are] the cathedrals of nature.'  There were also many shades of disingenuousness to deal with, most of which came into play when Kerry levied attacks against George Bush. ... When I was done cutting, there were only two lines left.  'I was born in Colorado.  America can do better.  Amen'. " --Matt Taibbi (note: Laugh out loul lines of the day)

      I read in the WaTimes that Kerry comes off a rather forgettable 2 week  Save America from the American's Tour  that things are not going so well.  Contrast this with W all over the place looking sharp and lean and full of energy.  He does take a while to get cranked up, but even after visiting Scotland for 4 days, I can see who looks the worse for wear.  Look at recent shots of both men.  One looks ready for a face lift and the other looks like he just ran the marathon and is ready for more.  Could it be that come debate time, W will win merely because he does not look ready for the coffin?  Could it be that with Flippy's lame attempts at explanations for everything he has done in his life to set up this moment, that Terry McAweful will ask him to step down so someone else, Breck Girl or Broom Hilda, can step in to try and seal the deal?  Just some questions mind you, and I know a few seem fetched, but frankly...Kerry looks like he is on Chemo, not on a Campaign.

      Kerry brags that he can fight a war and win the peace just like Bush can, only much smarter, more successful, and with an extra dose of sensitivity.   urlLink Mitch Berg  shares his thoughts.     The notion that one can fight a war - any kind of war, especially the ephemeral, intelligence-heavy war against stateless terrorists - is absurd.  And yet a substantial part of the electorate can listen to statements like Kerry's with a straight, even a hopeful, face.     Further proof that liberals should be required to pass a test before being allowed to comment on foreign policy and defense.     I may write this test up for distribution soon...     Might I suggest one simple question?  Ask them if Sa Dec is in Cambodia.

       urlLink Tony Snow  counts six different versions of the Kerry in Cambodia story. BTW - he quotes another "grass roots" Kerry supporter that just happens to have the same talking points as the other "grass roots" Kerry supporters. If the SwiftVets are just a political hit group, they deserved to get smeared. But so far, their stories stand up and force Kerry's campaign to retreat to the basement for two days to fix their story. SwiftVet critics, on the other hand, offer nothing but ad hominem hits. I'm almost to the point of embracing everything in  urlLink  Unfit for Command   sight unseen. If it turns out that they have produced an honest work, those veterans will deserve even more decorations for telling the truth and facing the fire.  (Hat tip to  urlLink Hugh Hewitt , who has the transcript of an interview today with Dick Cheney.)

      The fact-challenged, detail-challenged left is laughable in their attempts to debunk the Swiftvet. It's been nearly a week since the Christmas in Cambodia story came out. Now we see  urlLink this .   This is beautiful. The only thing left to debunk is the Cambodia story.    That's like John Cooper saying that  the only thing left to do is beat Michigan . I'm reminded of Charlie Brown speeding toward that football. No matter how many times Lucy pulled the placement, Charles had faith that the ball would be there. Confidence with no reason, producing comedy without intention. So powerful, so irrational is the hatred of Bush that they have yet to figure out what a real lie is.  Nice try, guys.  Update: You guys have to be reading Lileks. I know The Eye isn't, but don't let that stop you. He's got  urlLink something to say  about Kerry's prized CIA hat:      Again, I’m just speculating. Who knows.      But the talismans of life are usually the items we’re dealt by chance or choice, items which gather significance by their banality, ordinary nature, and the fact that they were ours during a time that seared – seared! Itself into our memory. I’ve saved some keys. A T-shirt or two. My press badges, of course. If I’d served four harrowing months in Vietnam I surely would have kept my hat. Having just spent weeks sorting the detritus of my own banal existence, and finding myself gobsmacked over an item squirreled away 20 years ago, I can testify to the power of ordinary objects. I can even see why one would keep the hat close. I think it would be rather odd to carry it around all the time; I mean, my dad was in a war for four years, not four months, and his medals and memorabilia sat undisturbed in a drawer, because that was then and this was Fargo. But there’s nowt as queer as folk.      But. But. How did this work, exactly? Did the CIA agent take off his hat as he was hopping off the boat to wade into the jungle?  Here, take this, think of me. Or here you go, pal, you lost your hat back there, take mine, I have another . Square this with the narrative: Kerry was bitter as he bobbed in Cambodia, shot at from all sides – so he takes this hat, this extra hat, this spook lid back to barracks, and now it replaces his  own  hat as the object that spells luck. That sums up his experience. That brings it all back. Not the hat he wore on the boat in combat, but the hat he got from a spook on an illegal mission – that’s the good luck object, that’s the prized possession.       Work for you?      Maybe; again, I'm just running fiction-writer debugging scripts. If I wrote a novel with a Vietnam vet, I'd use the CIA-hat detail as a sign the character probably spent the war filing reports in San Diego.

[T]here has always been a tension between liberty and security  -- whether it was John Adams's Alien and Sedition Act or FDR's  Japanese internment catches or John Ashcroft's Patriot Act,  Americans have always debated how to balance the right to live  freely with the right to live in peace. &nbsp;So where do we seek  guidance in these troubled days? &nbsp;I look at Benjamin Franklin,  the Renaissance man of the American Revolution, who warned his  fellow Founding Fathers that those who would sacrifice liberty  for security deserve neither. &nbsp;That's something to remember when  standing in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty.&quot; --Joe Scarborough    Taken from the Federalist Report...
