      Today I helped a friend move in the morning, went food shopping in the afternoon, cleaned the house in preparation for a visit from friends tommorow, and helped my wife deal with a sick infant. (nothing serious, just a slight cold with major poopies) Needless to say, I was pretty beat durning the evening's practice session.  I had both a major breakthrough and a minor discovery. The major breakthrough was deciphering that I was, for a fact, letting my lower jaw slide back while playing. I don not beleve it is the "floating jaw" symptom as noted in the Roy Roman video, in part because once I start to play, my jaw stays in place. What I was inadvertantly doing was letting my jaw slip back, just as I was about to play. This was giving me what appaers to be a Walt Johnson labelled: "High Gear" embrouchure, or what S/C/R calls, "letting the lip follow the airstream".   From here out I will beging to make the correction of keeping my jaw out. Already, I have lost much in teh way of my current progress, but at least I know that I am doing this system 100% correctly, as far as my knowledge goes. I'm sure that I will re-gain the lost ground in no time, and then proceed on...  I must now make a concious effort to think about what it feels to keep my jaw out. I have been doing teh pencil excersizes for months now, and do not believe that it is a muscular thing that is working against me. I think I was just honestly unaware that I was doing this action, and now must work to undo my bad habit. I have focused on this feeling and belive that I knwo what it is that I have to do. Here's hoping!  The minor discovery that I made was that I am placeing the mounthpiece slightly offcenter, towards the right. I deduced that this is because I have a slightly out of align tooth in the same area, making the high spot. According to the book, what I have instinctively corrected for is exactly what I should have done!

      Today during my lunchtime reharsal, things started out slow, but eventually came back up to speed.  I have noticed though, that my top lip tends to stick out beyond my bottom lip, reminescent of the Walt Johnson "High Gear" embrouchure. I'm sure that this is due to my bottom jaw receeding to the point where my teeth are parallel to or slightly BEHIND my top teeth. Is this a no-no? I am getting results this way, and Walt Johnson plays that way, so I wonder if I should stay with it or make the effort to go "textbook"?

      The following are a list of questions for my upcoming phone lesson with Roy Roman.  1.) At what rate should I be progressing?  I have been at this since the end of February, and have started to make some real progress in th epast 6 weeks. However, I still would rate my pratice session at about 65/35. 65% effective, and 35% treading water or worse.  2.) How can I open up my sound and get some real volume?  3.) What are my next steps?  4.) I just got over a long period of double-tones. The book says this is due to flabby chops? Please expand on this...  5.) I do the bulldog excersizes 10 minutes a day. I do the pencil trick for about 15 minutes a day. I practice 1/2 hr + every day. Some days I am doing everything correctly, yet it just seems to be a chops problem. Will this be surpassed in time on it's own, or is there something I should be doing? (Note: most of the time when I am having an off night, the culprit is a receeding jaw. Some nights this is not the case. Suggestions?  6.) Explain what is noted on page 18: "The bottom lip should hug the bottom teeth edges" Does that mean that the lip is covering th etp of the bottom teeth?  7.) Explain the desired result of the two excersizes, "Air-to-nose" and "Air-to-chin"  8.) I set my embrouchure away from the mouthpice with my mouth open and then close the lips together. The day I started to do that, I got the system to work. Before then, when setting my embrouchure as described in the video and book (close lips, curl in, etc...) I could not get it to work. Explain.  9.) Explain lips straight across between teeth, and how I came about that. Any pulling down of the corners, ie: "locking the corners", and my lips get an upward curvature, putting the bottom lip too close to the top teeth.

      Got an email from Kathryn Roman at lunch. Hopefully I'll be getting a follow-up phone lesson sometime soon. Note to Self: start making a list of questions for the lesson.  Practice went well today at lunch. One of those amazing days where everything worked perfectly for no reason at all. I didn't observe anything different, in fact, it seemed like my jaw was even a little too far back, yet I had "it" the entire time with little effort.  This morning I started using carpenter pencils instead on regular pencils. I did notice that my teeth aperature at lunch was enourmous, so perhaps this is why practicing was near effortless. I could have played above C2 all day, with little or no recovery time....

      Went home to practice at lunch. Pretty good results, probably because I did the bulldog and pencil trick this morning. Started searching for melodies to play instead of just arpeggios, etc.. Hey Jude is always a good one. Long, drawn out head that goes fairly high. Think I hit a G above C2 (possible higher)   Still kind of hit-or-miss...need to be able to focus in and hit it from the start. I'm sure that will come in time. Decided to move to carpenter pencils: regular pencils are not too much of an effort for me anymore, and carpenters are wider and offer a flatter surface area.

      Went home today and did 45 minutes during lunch. Things are picking up, but I still have a tendancy to put my head back and to let my jaw receed a little bit. Also, my big problem lately is that I have been pushing in MUCH too hard. You should only be balancing the outward force of your brath, NOT adding any additional pressure! Once I realized this and backed off, I freed up my sound and allowed the top lip to vibrate more freely.  "And they proceeded onward...."

      Today I began re-reading the SCR book front-to-back. This will be my third complete reading. I've divided the book up into ten page segments, marked with small post-it notes, so that I can keep up a reasonable pace. It's an easy enough book to read, which is surprising, given it's age. Books from the 30's and 40's tend to be very difficult reads.   Although easy to read, this book must be read slowly. Every sentence weighs about three pounds: it's packed with valuable information and they did not waste words. I've found myself on several occasions re-reading the same paragraph over and over again trying to wrap my mind around the concepts.  Once you read the book the first time (and watch the accompanying (sp?) video), you tend to go out for a week or two thinking you know what to do. I know that's how I approached it. The problem is, there is so much to understand (note: it's not difficult once you finally get it, but there is a lot to know) that you can't possibly do it right the first time, especially if you're on your own. The first time I read the book, I used a blue highlighter. The second time I read it, I used a green one, and discovered so much "new" information that there is now just as many green highlights as there are blue!  As for last night's practice, I would rank myself at 75%. I just didn't try hard enough this weekend, and now I have a bit of muscle re-building to do, which is always the case when I slack off. Had some notes, but I still am letting my jaw receed too much. I did my excersizes today, but my 9:30 pm practice time is really a little too late in the day to have a lot of energy. I need to keep motivated.  Today I printed out a picture of Roger Ingraham that I found on the net. It's a great example of the perfect embrouchure, so now it's posted in my area in the garage. Also, I got my Thad Jones/Mel Lewis cd's in th email from Amazon. Central Park North and Consumation. Hopefully this will give me a much needed kick in the pants to develop!

      Tonight's practice was....just practice. I generally have to motivate myself to go out into the garage when it comes time to practice, but weekends are especially tough. Saturday's and Sunday's are generally spent with the family, so there is a lot more action and resultant tiredness by the end of the day. That said, weekend practices are just this side of drudgery, but all too important.  About a month ago, I blew off both days of the weekend, and boy did I ever pay for that bout of lazyness. It took me almost ten straight days to return to my former level. Of course, at that time I had not yet had Major Breakthrough #2, so my practices tended to be a lot more hit or miss than they are now. Anyway, the moral of this story is just do it. Go out and squeak notes in front  of a mirror every day, rain or shine, in sickness or in health.  Back to tonight. Really beat, and probably still getting over that bout of whatever that I had yesterday. Chops felt good, but results were so-so, probably because I just didn't want to go through the effort to support the diaphramatic compression. I was ready some old Desert Aria newpapers I had from 94-95 (the Las Vegas Musicians Union newletter) so that at least kept me out there, but like I said, at least I did my time and deduced what the problem was. Although I don't feel it progressed me any physically I feel it was worth the effort to diagnose another random symptom.  Tommorow is another day. Besides, I got an email from Kathrny Roman tonight. It's the day after their bog two day seminar, so hopefully Roy will have time to schedule me for a phone interview sometime soon. I really need to check in to see if I'm on th eright track, and also to find out what my next steps will be.

      Major Breakthough #2 (MB2) took place about two weeks ago.  My practices had been hit-or-miss as of late, and I just could not seem to pinpoint or analyze what the problem was.  In the SCR book, there are described three excersizes: Air-To-Chin, Air-to-nose, and what is reffered to as the "Bulldog' excersize. I never couls d fihure out the importace of the first two, since I never could manage to make my cheeks ache, whish would have been a result of proper muscle development. I just assumed that I was a "natural" and because of this, did not need the excersizes. The "Bulldog" I found to be extremely i,portant, and have worked this every day since day one, along with the pencil excersize.  Through out th etext and video, Roy says that you must aim the air up into the cup of the mouthpiece. I couls not physically figure this one out, and assumed that just having my jaw out would be enough. One day, while studying my setup in a mirror, I treid to blow air up, since this is something I knew I was supposed to do. Low-and-behold, I saw that when doing this, I looked just like the examples seen in the air-to-nose excersize! When applied to the trumpet, my range and volume increased ten fold!   When encountering problems while practicing now, I stop playing the horn, and get infront of the mirror to step back and re-evaluate what's going on. I start with air-to-nose, and then ensure that my jaw is actually staying in position when I bring the horn up to be played. 9 timnes out of 10, my jaw has receeded, despite the fact that I "think" I'm set up correctly.  The moral of this story is: every single friggin line of that book is Gospel. There is not one word of filler in it. If you think you are exemopt from something, you aren't. We are all beginners in this thing, and must humble ourselves to take baby steps, and be prepared to take a step or two backwards in order to solidify the correct techniques.

      This Major Breakthrough (MB1) took place about six weeks ago. I kept setting my chops per the prescribed order in the book, but by doing it in this order, I was inadvertantly pully the corners of my mouth down ever so slightly. By doing this, I would naturally create a position in which my chops formed aa slight "frown" reminescent of the position used in the bulldog positon. The result of this frown was that my bottom lip was being pushed up towards the top teeth, therby leaving not much of an aperature for air to pass through.  One day while at work, I was practiceing in front of a mirror in the shop outside my office. I was not using a mouthpiece, but I was only setting my cops and blowing. I noticed that by setting my chops with my mouth open, then closing my chops, the formation was more lateral and did not have the resultant curvature. As a result, my embrouchure was centered between my teeth aperature, and playing was improved substatially.  Care must be taken when doing this, because the tendancy is to smile after closing. The correct set up resembles what I would call a "smirk" but it must be noted that this is NOT a "snear" or a "smile" A concious effort must be maintained that there is isometric compression between the chops, and NOT a pulling away from any other facial muscle.

      Yesterday, I was a bit under the weather all day. I had a headache and was a little nauseaus (sp?) and tired all day. I headed to the garage at my regular time in the evening (about 9 or 9:30, after the kids are in bed)  Practice was a little off. My tone was really quiet, and my range wasn't quite there. After some examination I realized that it was because my jaw kept receeding after the initial setup. I imagine this was due to lack of excersize. I was out with the family all day and didn't get any pencil or bulldog excersizes in all day. (It really shows when you lay off one day!)   I was also not supporting with my diaphram (or not able to support due to being sick) so my endurance was pretty much non-existant. All in all, I should have considered this my off night for the week and not have practiced at all, but I at least I got to use my diagnostic skills and realized the importance of the daily excersizes.

      I started playing trumpet in seventh grade I believe, which would have been back in '78. I had started playing clarinet in my grade school concert band, but I didn't like the woman who was teaching it, so I instead switched to trumpet. My Mom made any instrument I wanted to play available to me, and once I decided to make one permananet, she took me to the local music shop and bought me my first hown: a laquered Holton Collegiate, with a NEMC 7C mouthpiece. It came in a navy blue case, and I can remember driving home almost in slow motion, because I was so excited to have it.   At the time, I would take lessons through the summer, and I can remember at one point, my teacher asked me if I had ever studied something called the "pivot system" because he noticed that I was tilting my horn up and down when I would play higher or lower. I was 12 years old and didn't have a clue as to what he was talking about, but it made me feel good to think that I might have been onto something.  I played all though high school, and was plopped into the 1st trumpet after we graduated 18 seniors out of the band my freshman year. We were a really small band: 40 kids which included the flag girls, so I always had to compensate by blowing my brains out. From th eget go I was a downstream player, and people were constantly telling me to hold my horn up. I had no idea how to correct any of this, because as any trumpet player knows, it is no simple act just to "hold your horn up" How many times have I heard "get your bell out of the stand!" and any variation to that effect.   I went through a succession of teachers, the first of which in grade school who, unfortunately his name has been forgotten. My brothers took saxaphone lessons from a shop on Fleet Avenue in Cleveland Ohio called Modern Music. It was owned by a man by the name of Rudy Sindell. he was a great sax player, who had this amazing facial tick that somehow went away when he played. Anyway, my first teacher there was an older man by the name of Bill Tress. He had me start on his old Claude Gordon method book, and also playing songs out of old "stock" books. I eventuall stopped going to him one summer, and did not take lessons again until one of my high school band directors by the name of Fred Ziwich suggested that I start taking lessons from a guy who owned a shop where he taught clarinet and accordian after school. The shop was called Memphis-Ridge Music, and it was owned by John Trush. He was an old-school big band player who got off the road when the bands fell apart in the 60's. He was now an enginer at a Ford plant working on their conveyor lines. Joh was a good guy, but he didn't do a lot in the way of guiding me in any direction. It was simply play this Arban study and this tune from a songbook every week. He was the sort of guy who went through a differenet mouthpiece every month, which started me in a bad habit, because, he would get me to buy them fom him.   Eventually, I graduated high school and started playing with several bands around town. I saw an article in the Friday magazine about a German brass band, the "German Music Shule" so I joined up with them. I also played with an Italian wedding band, who I think were called "The Blue Knights" and then made my big leap to stardowm playing with Eddie Potoniaks "Stik's And Tones" (no shit) I got the refereaal to this band through John Trush, and his last words to me were, "Now don't stop taking lessons now that you are playing in a band" Of course I did.  Stik's And Tones was a fiasco worthy of it's own weblog, but I did meet a great trumpet player by the name of Mike Mcgreen. (more on him later) Along the way, I also started playing shows for the East Cleveland Community Theatre and also the Cuyohoga Community Colleg big bands. From here I gradually climbed my way up through the Cleveland big band scene, starting with a rehearsal band called the Townsmen, then to subbing with Nite Coach, Willy Smith, and some other bands which I can't remember the name of. I also played with a community band based in Mentor Ohio, and then got on a great college band out in Mentor I eventually got on the Dan Zola Band, which, although not the most technically accurate band in town, had the best book by far (mostly Woody Hernman / Buddy Rich charts, and had a monster lead player by the name of Jerry Loveland.   I stayed on the Zola band all the while I was in Cleveland. During this time, I started to take lessons from Al Pavlovich, who played lead with Nite Coach, and also played split lead in the Mentor band. He was a student of Doc Reinhardt, as was a mutual friend of our's, a guy by the name of Mike Hazlett. I stayed with Al until I moved to Las Vegas in the fall of '92. When I got to Vegas, I started the climb all over again by playing in community colleges, etc...  While hopping around the college bands, I managed to get a few great gigs around Vegas. One New Years' Eve gig was with the Walt Boenig Big Band, which was full of top vegas talent, and another New Years was spent playing for Si Zentner. I was amazed at this one, because most of the guys on th eband drove in from LA and were the regulars on th eTosjiko-Akiyoshi Big Band. I was slated to play fourth, when I was told that th elead player for th enight would be Walt Johnson. THE Walt Johnson. I must have come close to pooping my pants aboyt ten times that night. I sat on his left, and just was dumbfounded the entire night...  I then helped form a Morphine-esque band with a bass player by the name of Rob Spinzo. We called ourselves Bianco Trasho (white trash in Italian) and were together for about two years, and played a total of three gigs. Our biggest gig was a night at some club in Henderson. (Also on the bill that night was a band called Linus, which would somehow morph into Expert On October, whose drummer had been in Attaboy Skip, and would go onto play in the Killers.) This night was a landmark because the next day the following happend:   1.) I broke up with my girlfriend Julia (see wife)  2.) The band broke up 3.) The girl I was going out with before Julia got married.  It was a triple header weekend!   At that point I just about hundg up playing and buried myself in creating a not-for-profit literary magazine called "Vegas Undiscovered". While I was hard at work on VU, I had decided to put up some flyers at the local music stores to see if I could hook up with a band.   About a year had gone by since I had done any real playing, and I had just come to the realiziation that I was not going to be a trumpet player anymore. Just then....the phone rang. On the other end was a guy by the name of Ronnie vannucci who was the drummer for one of Vegas's biggest bands, Attaboy Skip. (www.attaboyskip.com) We hooked up, hit it off, and I went on to have one of the most fullfilling musical expieriences of my life! Imagine, playing without sheet music in front of you! Imagine, playing music that you had a hand in writing! Imagine, playing in front of five thousand kids who, not only are glad to see you, but know all of your songs by heart! It was simply amazing.  more to come....

      Thought I'd officially roll out the welcome mat to anyone who attendend the two day weekend seminar that Roy held two weeks ago. I would love to hear from anyone who was there.   While we're at it, we can make this weblog an open forum to anyone who has tips to offer or needs help themselves.   All are welcome and feel free to post!

      FInally caught the cold that has been making it's way through my family. Saturday's practice was weak at best, and Sunday was a crapout.   Got back on the horse today at lunch and had some good progress. Still on the fence about whether or not I should stick with keeping my jaw as far out as I am. I started this a week or so ago, and still have not come back up to my old mark. I was getting some very impressive results with my old setup (I'll call it CSR1) which was basically my bottow teeth just behind my top teeth. With CSR2, It feels very strange, and I wonder about my bottom lip being so far in front of my top.   I really need to get a phone lesson set up, but I still haven't been contacted by Katheryn Roman. Here's hoping...

      There are so many methods...  The Stevens/Costello/Roman Method Double High C in 37 Weeks, by Roger Spaulding Double High C in 10 Minutes, by Walt Johnson Exploring The Trumpet's Upper Register, by Jay Zorn The Cat Anderson Method, by Cat Anderson For The Sake Of Lead Trumpet Playing, by Patrick Hession The Art Of Lead Trumpet Playing, by (unknown) Top Tones For The Trumpeter, by Smith The Encyclopedia Of The Pivot System, by Dr. Reinhardt The Maggio System, by Louis Maggio  So who is right? This hot-button topic is EXACTLY the same as asking and particular group of people:  Christianity Hinduism Buddhism Judaism Agnosticism and on and on....  Which one of THOSE is right?  They all basically say the same thing: obey simple laws, and end up in heaven.  Isn't that the same as trumpet playing?  I have been making a study of all the methods that I have know of through the years. (quite an expensive undertaking, let me tell you. most method books start at $65 and go up from there). My old teacher back in Cleveland was a student of Doc Reinhardt (the Pivot System) and he gave me the basic principle of this method years ago. However, I remained an open embrochure player throughout my entire carreer.   One day, years ago, I was a student assistant at a community college in Cleveland. One day my task was to clean up the professors old office. i was told to throw everything away, and if there was anything I wanted, to feel free to keep it. Well, the only thing of interest I saw was a copy of the Roy Roman "Ultimate Position" videotape. I watched it years ago (this must have been in the late 80's) but never did anything about it. I am a naturally downstream player, an my first attempt with the Costello system was a total mess because I was unaware of how to keep my chin up. For years I was told to simply hold up my horn, but this action is an impossibility unless you are unstructed as to how to begin to stretch the masseter muscle of you jaw. I was simply labelled as "lazy" by everyone.   My embrochure did not hinder me from becoming a decent player, however. As Roy Roman put it in my first phone lesson, "I got good at playing bad". My range was a passable F above high C on a great night, and I had a dependable D above C almost all the time. I was most proud of my massive, bright tone, which I must say, was Maynard like and better than most other players.  But back to the quest....  I put the SCR method aside, moved to Vegas, played there and moved to the Bay Area in '98. I haven't done much playing at all since I've moved here, apart from one reunion gig that Attaboy put on last March. I've kept my music jones satisfied by teaching myself guitar in the years that I have ben here, and now play kid's songs at my children's day care on occasion.  So now that I am official unencumbered with the responsibilitie sof playing trumpet with any group whatso ever, the time has come to get serious about my embrouchure. This is where the SCR method comes in.  Like I stated above, I have collected and studied all of the methods that I listed. I can say with authority that none of them would work for me as well as SCR, with the possible exception of the Pivot System.   DISCLAIMER: This is NOT to say that the other methods are usuless. I just have made an educated choice based on my own personal phisiognomy (sp?) and expierience. The only actual system I WOULD say was usuless would be the Cat Anderson method. Now, I absolutely LOVE Cat and his playing, and I do agree 100% that he is a historic figure and that his role with Duke's band was of major importance. What I am saying is that his book is a farce. It is simply trumpet excersizes written an octave (or two) up, with the advice of: "just stick with it and practice every day" or the amazing: "for inspiration, think of a cartoon while you play". ...You decide.  Now like I said, I play downstream with an open embrouchure. I can say with absolute certainty that there is no amount of practice and no magic series of etudes that would ever give me unlimited range. I know this for a fact. For years and years, through high school and beyond, I spent incalcuable hours in the basement, playing with an almost religious fervor, and could only bring my range up to what I described above. I played in every rehearsal band I could find, 4 hours a night 6 nights a week or more for a decade, and nothing ever developed. It was not until I went back to Roy's tape, and heard for the first time (although I had watched the tape already ten times) what the secret really was: You must obey the physical laws of the trumpet. (These are simple laws, yet too complex to describe here. To find out more, you umust get a copy of Roy's book and video)    Yet the method does not come without a price. (physical, emotional and economic) First you must pay Roy for his time and effort to create the materials. (at last word, I think it was $300) Second, you must read, read, and re-read the book. And I mean read it with a friggin' MAGNIFYING GLASS! There is so much information in every line of the book that I am on my third DETAILED reading of it and I'm still finding out secrets that I didn't catch the first time! And lastly, emotional. You WILL NOT succeed with this overnight. It will take MONTHS of daily practice, playing nonsense sounds to develop your facial muscles into doing what you ned them to do. It is a LOT OF WORK, but let me tell you it will pay off in the end. You may go fine for weeks, and then one day, your squeky little sounds will be no more. When that happens, you'll have to hit the books again, and stick your face in a mirror to find out what nearly imperceptable change happened to throw you off track (nine times out of ten, it's because you got lazy and started to let your jaw slack).  more to come.....

      Been hard at work keeping my jaw further forward. Not an easy task, seeing as I've spent th epast several months playing with my bottom teeth slightly behind my fron. (just the thickness of the teeth behind. Not much, but makes all the difference) My progress had been seriously hindered, but not my sound is coming back.  Got my first email from a guy by the name of Drew. He just bought a copy of the method from Roy, and has started work on it. After nine days, he has already seen some great progress. Keep it up!  By the way, anyone should feel free to contact me on their path to the Stevens Costello Roman method. Although I am BY NO MEANS an expert, I have been at it for awile, and have had to self-diagnose many, many problems along the way. In that area, I'm sure I can be of some help. To get real help, I would suggest you contact Roy Roman himself.

      I'm still making a major change in my playing setup. Decided that my jaw has been set back, (or floating back?) in order for me to play. MUST concentrate on keeping it out! Sunday night was a maintenance night, and I took Monday night off, because we were out at Big Basin (or the Hundred Acre Woods, as Sarah called it) all day.

      Yes I know...I've taken quite a bit of time off from the blog. When last we spoke, I was getting ready to have a phone lesson with Roy. I had quite a long and informative session with him.  &nbsp;  I haven't touched my horn since then, and have just begun to play again this week. I have a new determination to become the best representative of the Stevens / Costello method that there is. Just give me time!  &nbsp;  I've learned that family is the most important thing in the world, and that obsessing over anything: music,&nbsp;work, religion, a trumpet method, etc...is a very bad thing. I am going to learn this method on my own terms, second only the needs of my family.  &nbsp;  Praise god.  &nbsp;
