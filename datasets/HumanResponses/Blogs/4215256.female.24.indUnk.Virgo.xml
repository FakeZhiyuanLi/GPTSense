       urlLink  Hey all just wanted to give a heads up to the future.  Currently, I am looking for camps either out west, along the east coast or gulf area or down south.  I my hope is that many of you will consider working with Tim or myself again.  Please check back

       urlLink  Some may call it a "Ghost in the Machine", others "an explainable malfunction".  I call it, a digital legacy.  This morning, I sat down at my desk like so many other mornings, and began composing an email.  The email however, did not respond as I expected.  Everytime I wrote the word "the" it was immediately replaced with "Greenjello Lives".  No matter how many times I tried to replace it, the mantra would persist.  It is comforting to know that it does not matter where you go, the spirit of Greenjello will be there.

       urlLink  It is with a heavy heart that I announce to you the Kiwanis Camp Wyman program has been cut, and supplanted with camp coca cola.  It is with an even heavier heart that I announce Wyman has laid off Dominic.  More details to follow...

       urlLink  Well things are pretty strange here at the site of KCW. His Kids have taken over with an entourage of golf carts. Shaggy and I are trying to score one just to cruise around a bit, but I don't think its gonna happen. So for now I'll have to test my luck with being an innocent bystander on foot. Being supplemental staff is quite a bit more relaxing than the 22hr days that I'm used to. Frequent naps after off-site meals.  Nice! Looking forward to meeting some of the crazies from summer (Okami and Bubba) out in Colorado. Only a week away! Well I guess I'll go enjoy the company of...me for a bit before I hit the sack. Good night all.

      Hello all.  Just thought I would let you know that in the coming weeks, I will be posting all of my pics that I have taken throughout the summer online.  I'm not sure how it will be done yet, but it will be something to look forward to in the coming weeks.  First, though, I'm going to go off and spend some time in Colorado.  Priorities first :)

       urlLink    It's official.  The 2004 summer camp season is over.  The staff banquet was a touching way to wrap things up and Swing Around Fun Town ended it all on a positive note.  Lots of goodbyes and hugs upon the return to camp.  Bubba didn't get his package in the mail (thanks Bubba).  Birdman is going to get a fly fishing lesson from me this week and Sol ran out of gas.    I hope everyone likes their gifts.  Dom and I worked on trying to make them relevant to your experiences at camp.  Have fun with the music and the powerpoint photos.  Thanks everyone for signing our plaques.  They were a very classy gift and made even more special by your signatures.    I think my fried Paul is lost in the woods with Dan's dog Savannah right now.  Wyman Search and Rescue to the rescue.

      The easiest way I've found to make a post (not a comment, you can simply click on "comment" to do that) is, after you register, click on your profile, then click on "Dashboard".  From here you can make a new post.  Spend some time playing with the site to figure it out.  I downloaded "Hello" to upload the campfire picture.  There's a link for that in the help section.  No parking, deliveries only.

      Camp is quiet.  Too quiet.  The campers have all gone home, the floors have all been mopped and we are alone.  Camp has come full circle.  Rayray has wussed out on our Halo tourney and messed everything up.  Yeah Eureka hotel bar!

      Okay, I know there are people that I missed in the invite.  Please help me avert their anger by sending me their new email address.  Some of the addresses I have are really old.  There was dust on one of them.  If you are reading this, you're either just about to leave camp, or have already returned home/current residence.  Life is crazy, therefore crazy things happen.  Feel free to use this forum to keep your connections connected, your group grouped, your friends ahem, friended.
