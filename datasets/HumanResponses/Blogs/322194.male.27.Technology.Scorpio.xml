       Week of: &nbsp; July 25th       urlLink Wanderjive    mister_meh    urlLink      This is a great dark pulp-noir comic that has such style and sophistication, it's hard to believe it's actually free. It's not just the art itself that creates this excellent comic, it's also the juxtaposition of music (via truncated downloadable MP3s) that combined together with the visual comic style create an almost movie-like experience. It's unique, all-encompassing, and fantastic. And it can only be done on the internet.  It's made the Evil Network Comics listing now! Great stuff!

      Feel free to offer up suggestions for comics you'd like to see added to the big list. We're going to be a bit more selective this time around, but we're still open to the possiblity. In any case, each suggestion will at the very least be investigated for quality.  Suggestions can be  urlLink emailed , or you can leave a  urlLink comment on the list .

      Just added a new 'Evil Network Site' to my Blogger collection on the right -hand navigation menu.  urlLink Evil Network Games  is now open with all sorts of links to sites of infinite gaming goodness. Much like  urlLink Evil Network Comics , the  urlLink Games  blog will be updated periodically with new links as more become available that I've missed. As always, please feel free to post comments to the lists with new links and corrections.

      Can anyone please explain  urlLink this  to me?  "OK, so yeah, we're Interplay, and we have no money, nothing but bad press, and we'll be non-existent by July 2004, but would you please invest in our new MMORPG game? I know the current market is saturated with the genre, but we have a  really good feeling  about this one."  I doubt Herve Caen could count to 10 without cheating somehow. He just seems like he has something to hide. I hate to say it, but I can't wait for them to tank. Then maybe investors will grow wise to the fact that you just don't put Caen in charge of  anything .  Gaming news is a bit dry right now, with E3 excitement over and everyone being extraordinarily tight-lipped regarding new games and next-generation technology. Although I was able to dig up  urlLink this nugget of goodness . A  Golden Sun  game for the Cube is supposedly in development. I was a big fan of the first GBA game, but never had the time for  Lost Age . It's good to see all these excellent GBA games get their turn on the Cube. I hope Nintendo keeps encouraging that of its developers and partners.  Well, the time has come. After almost a solid month of no gaming, I'm going to attempt to play  Halo  this weekend. My friend invited a new couple from our church over to his house this weekend, and he's getting a bunch of us together for another  Halo  team deathmatch session. Evidently, the lady is quite the  Halo  player. Actually, I believe the term my friend said she used was  Halo Queen . We'll see. Last time I gamed  Halo   (about 2 days prior to crushing my hand) , I played very well. Better than I ever had previously. Let's see if I've lost any of that ability.  Note that I've added links on the right hand side to a couple other blogs I shall attempt to maintain, including a resurrection of my old  urlLink online comics listing . This one will be much more sparse, as I will be very seletive this go-round, and I won't just be adding everything to the list. Only the good stuff gets in this time. People will be able to leave comments on items in the list. Feel free to suggest some more comics, and I'm happy to check them out. Hopefully this list will be much easier to maintain. We'll see.  That's all for now. Later, kids...

      Thanks for waiting around. I've been on hiatus for a couple of reasons. One: I got sick of Tripod throwing worthless crap on their free sites and referring to them oh so cleverly as 'added features'. Two: I broke my hand. My  right  hand, to be precise. And  yes , I am indeed  right-handed . All of my typing for the time being is being done completely with my left hand, which, as you might imagine, makes things rather difficult. It also makes me want to type less often. Unfortunately, when I  do  get the urge to type something, I'm every bit as wordy as before I lost the use of my most valued appendage. Needless to say, I'm also cranky. Not necessarily due to the loss of use of my right hand, but more due to one of its nastier side effects.  I can't play any video games.  For the past month, I've been sans GameCube. Well, actually, the Cube is still here, it's just collecting dust. This is in addition to the gaming drought I was already in within the two weeks prior to the hand crushing incident. We were so busy around the house, I just never gave myself the opportunity to play. Of course, I had no idea that lurking just around the corner was an angry and furious  event  that would take away any and all opportunities to play games for the at least the next month. Ugh. But hey, at least I can still  talk  about games.  Topics around here will stay pretty much the same as always. Games, online comics, technology, scifi, etc. Stick around. So far, I can already tell I'm going to like Blogger a lot more than Tripod.  And no, I'm not going to tell you how I broke my hand. It's already bad enough that my  family  knows.  Later...

      But not feeling overly talkative right now. Very tired. I'll post more later. Just thought you'd all like to know I'm around again and that I wasn't killed by a group of teenagers during a 7-1/2 hour van ride through Missouri. Though they were almost slaughtered. It came close. Very close.  Later...

      And I'm feeling fine! Hand is doing much better now, thank you very much. My physical therapist gave me this big ball of silly putty like substance called--appropriately--"Theraputty." Wonderful.&nbsp; I have to use it every day to squeeze some life into this tired, aching hand that has seen little use in the past two months. Putty- rific!   I'm hoping to get at least one more post in before I leave Sunday morning for Missourah, but there's no guarantee. I'd like to get next week's  Online Comic Weekly Spotlight  posted Saturday, but I've got so much left to do before I leave, there's really no telling if I'll be able to get it posted or not. In any case, everyone can simply enjoy  urlLink the one that's currently there  a little while longer. I have a bunch more comics I need to start getting into the  Spotlights , so the more weeks I can cover, the better! I'll see what I can do.  At the very least, now that the pins are out, typing is a bit easier  (it honestly wasn't all that hard with the pins, but it's just a bit more comfortable now) , so there's the potential for a more frequent blog from now on. Not that two to three times a week is anything to complain about! But I try to give everyone their money's worth. =)  If I don't post again, then I'll talk at you all the first week of August!

      I know I said I wasn't going to start this until the first week of August. That was mainly due to the fact that I wasn't going to be around the last week of July. I thought I would hold it off. But I have so many Spotlights I wish to get posted, I had to start early. I figure I can post each one on the weekend, which means I can post next week's the weekend before, so I shouldn't miss a week at all.   Bonus!   The start to the  Online Comic Weekly Spotlight  is a personal favorite of mine, and I've been waiting for the opportunity to let it shine!  So, don't delay:  urlLink go over to the Evil Network Comics site and check it out!   Go now!

      I just realized today that I haven't shown off my  urlLink broken hand  yet. How could I be so  selfish ? I can't keep this masterpiece to myself. Here's some quick shots.     Here's the brace I have to wear most of the time. Keeps my fingers bending.      Another shot of the brace.   And this one is  not for the squeemish!      This would be a shot with my brace  off , where you can easily see the pins sticking out of the side of my hand, and the nasty scar where the doctor went in to set the bone back into place and secure the pins. Neat, huh? I certainly think so.   The doctor says he wants to keep the pins in another couple of weeks. I have a follow-up appointment on the 21st, and he's taking them out then. After that, my physical therapy should move much faster, since I'll have my full range of motion back. Here's hoping, at least! I want to be able to draw again!

       urlLink More on this later.   Obviously, I've been tinkering around with  urlLink 1up's newly redesigned website , and it's actually a lot of fun, if you can get around the gut-wrenching load times, which I usually can't stomach. They've set up an interesting "friend invitation" system, where you ask strangers to be your friend. Part of the fun is seeing who will actually respond when you invite people to be your friend. I've probably invited at least 10 people to be my friend just in the past 2 days alone. So far, only one has replied.  Who is this wonderful stranger?  you ask. Well, not to be  completely  ironic, he appears to be a fellow Iowan. That could say a lot about both the internet and Iowans in general. We're a friendly bunch, we Iowans. The rest were from such God-forsaken areas as "San Francisco" and "Phoenix." I'll never hear from  them .  This nice guy who actually wants to attempt to be my friend  (bless his heart - he has no idea what he's getting himself into)  showed me a really cool site for wallpapers that absolutely blew me away. This means that most of my adoring audience has probably known about this site for years:  urlLink DigitalBlasphemy.com . All wallpapers in this site are at 1600 x 1280 resolution, rendered in spectacular 3D, and look absolutely amazing. I would download one or two, but my measly computer probably wouldn't boot up after placing one of these monsters on my desktop. These wallpapers are designed only for those few who actually  make  these kinds of wallpapers. Sort of how the Japanese language is designed specifically for the Japanese people, and when you see a dorky white guy speaking Japanese, it just makes you want to laugh out loud. Yeah. It's sorta like that.  Still playing. I'll keep you posted. Don't worry - I'm not going anywhere. Oh, wait - yes I am. The last week of July I'll be gone for the whole week. I'm taking our church youth on a youth conference outing in southern Missouri  (shudder) . I'll be back the last weekend in July.  Actually, I'll be back  before  then, that's just when I'm getting back from the trip itself. OK, nevermind. Later...

       urlLink 1up.com  has been redesigned, and I'm experiencing mixed emotions. For one thing, it's covered in Flash. Absolutely caked with the stuff. It's so Flash-intensive, that even my massively-overpowered work computer can't load the site at a reasonable speed. It's horrendous. Match that with an overwhelming amount of crap  (read: advertising)  on the front page, completely distorting the landing page information and effectively hiding that intrusive 'game content' from nosy readers. It's enough to make you sick. Of course, on the other hand, they're attempting to do something really cool with their  urlLink user-created gaming blogs and robust friend connection and club systems . This style of community resonates with the current blogging generation of internet users who wish to share every aspect of their personal lives with a wider audience. And which group is more in tune with this style of community? Well, the gaming demographic, silly! It's really a perfect combination, and I'm looking forward to seeing this occur more frequently as forums and bulletin boards slowly get phased out, and get replaced with more blogs, chat, and online awareness programs. It will take a while to get the perfect blend together, though.  urlLink 1up  gets a  'Valiant Effort'  award, but they aren't there yet. Since it's only recently launched, I'll give them some time to streamline and figure out why it isn't God's gift to gamers just yet. They definitely get the  'Pioneer'  award, though, and I truly hope this catches on. We'll have to wait and see.  In the meantime, check out  urlLink my member area . I doubt I'll start a blog there, too. I can't physically maintain that many blog systems at once. But it'll be fun to see how this system works out and grows over time. I'll keep you updated as to whether or not I think it's a success. Or, you can  urlLink try it out with me .  More later...

      Wow - now  urlLink this is a very fast router .  How fast?   10,967,254.6 MB/s  fast. And yeah, I  urlLink did the math . Being an IT person working for a company that strives to be at the cutting edge of technology, this is excellent news. Now, if only hardware companies can get the systems to actually  transmit data  at those kinds of speeds, we'd be doing pretty good.   Tales of Symphonia  is getting some  urlLink excellent review scores , as most of  urlLink Namco's  products do. I don't really care one way or the other. If it had received nothing but 1's and 2's as scores, I'd still be getting it. I've been aching to play a good RPG on my Cube, and nothing so far has been able to get me there. Here's hoping  Baten Kaitos  fairs just as well. These two games alone could keep me busy until the next generation begins.  Just prior to posting this, I received a new message from Microsoft's  urlLink Hotmail staff . Looks like the spector of  urlLink Google's gMail  is scaring Microsoft into providing more service for free. Check this out:  We're rolling out email antivirus protection as well as enhanced storage to help meet your growing needs. This will make MSN Hotmail, a world class email service that both scans and cleans ingoing and outgoing email for viruses and worms before they enter your inbox.      In addition to delivering world-class antivirus protection, you can also look forward to an upgrade in your storage capacity. In fact, you'll receive 125 times your current email storage with the introduction of a 250 MB inbox as well as the ability to send attachments up to 10 MB.     250 MB?!   While that's a far cry from Google's 1 GB gMail offering, it's plenty more than the paltry 2 MB they provide now. I'm looking forward to it. As it is now, I delete far too much email. I've been looking for an opportunity to keep my junk mail for just a few days longer.  In comic news, I've decided to honor the occasion of the return of the  urlLink Evil Network Comics Listing  with a combined return of the Online Comic Weekly Spotlight  (formerly known as the  urlLink Pick of the Week ) . Now, while  Arshraam  isn't around here anymore  (actually, come to think of it, I have no idea where he might be) , I'll be taking care of the Weekly Spotlight myself. I'll probably call in some favors with friends to help with choosing the right comics to be Spotlighted upon, and I'll warn you when things are coming around. The Spotlight will be posted on the  urlLink comics site , but as with all things Evil Network, it will be mentioned here, first. Consider this to be the "homepage" for the network, with every other sites merely connecting dots.  I went to the doctor today hoping I might get my pins out of my hand, but no luck. At least another two weeks, he says. In any case, I'm typing this two-handed, and it's getting much easier to do. I may just have to go full-bore and throw in  Viewtiful Joe , just to really see if my hand is useable.  Maybe not.  Later kids...

      I played about six hours' worth of  Halo  this weekend, and did very well, if I do say so myself. We beat the reigning " Halo Queen "--several times--and I was even able to team up with my friend and beat a couple of the others who have--until this weekend--been relatively unbeatable. So, I felt good. I went home, went to bed, and dreamt of sniping rocket whores.  The rest of my weekend was spent reassembling our office. My wife got me a new computer desk for father's day, and it took us all of the 3-day weekend (when we weren't at friends' houses for barbeques) to put it all together and get everything moved back in. It was quite a chore, especially with only limited use of one appendage.  Gaming news is pretty weak right now, but I did find  urlLink this  interesting, inasmuch as the ongoing debate on video game violence can continue to be "interesting". My thoughts are the same regardless of who is pushing the buttons of justice in this issue: it just comes down to   family  . Parents need to know what games their kids are playing and teach them that they shouldn't play games their tiny minds can't handle. My son will be entrenched in a fine diet of  Mario ,  Kirby , and other mildly entertaining, if not mildly digestible gaming staples for quite a while.   My   more gruesome  Splinter Cell  and  Halo  adventures will be done afterhours, when he is asleep, or out of the house. And when he's over playing games at a friend's house, I shall grill him on his game playing.  What did you play? Nothing you're not supposed to, right?  It's the same drill he'll have to tolerate regarding drugs and alcohol. It isn't going to happen during my watch, and I'm going to love him to death so he understands. Until I deem him mature enough to handle more acidic titles. That's my responsibility as a parent, and it's one I do not take lightly.  It's even my responsibility as an uncle. My 10-year-old nephew talks about all the R-rated movies his mom and dad let him watch. Then he comes over to my house, and I won't even let him play something as tame as  Metroid Prime .  Why?  Because it's rated T. He balks, but I just tell him that in my house, I control the game playing. It's E-rated games only--and not just until you become a teenager--as though that's some  magical  indicator of "maturity level". But when I say so. And no, it's not some power trip. It's just being a responsibile caretaker.  In other news, I find it amusing that  urlLink Acclaim is going bankrupt , but that's not really as funny as Acclaim losing their "claim" (pun intended) on  urlLink some of their major licenses . It's actually pretty sad and pathetic that losing the rights to  Turok  and  All-Star Baseball  counts as some kind of "loss" to the company. Failing licenses should not figure into your net worth. In fact, that should be a part of most business and economic courses.  Well, I've spouted off enough today. Later, kids...
