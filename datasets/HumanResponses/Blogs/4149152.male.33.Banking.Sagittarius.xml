      I was late getting to the office this morning because  urlLink Arthur  smells too good. It’s the same reason I was late yesterday and the day before. Arthur needs to keep his good smells to himself in the morning. In particular, his back which always smells like baking cookies. But only in the morning. And only his back. What a lucky combination of sleep smells to wake up smelling like cookies. Also, he’s very warm. That, mixed with the smell of clean sheets is exactly what I need to fall back to sleep after the alarm goes off.  That’s why I married him. But, if I’m going to get up in time for work, I’ve got to start feeding him garlic the night before.

      Watching  urlLink this feature  on CBC last night about how Tibetan Buddists aare generally happier, calmer, and less stressed than most people in the Western World got me on to my traditional rant, which I will share with you. It is this: we in Western society do not lead meaningful lives. We have more than everything we need, and we’re just not happy.  Basically my argument is that we’ve completed 1 to 4 in  urlLink Maslow’s hierarchy of needs , but instead of pursuing self-actualization, we’ve embraced consumerism. It’s all we have left, if you believe the media. The Western world has long focused it’s attention on material gain, but for much of it, we had religion, which at least gave us some sense of our place in the world. In recent times, many of us have shrugged off the confines of religious belief, and this has left something of a gaping whole in our understanding of ourselves, out priorities, and the world around us.  Now, we’ve become obsessed with the acquisition of material goods as a way of filling that void. It’s become ridiculous. We work outrageously stressful jobs so that we can make money so that we can acquire more “things” that we are told will make us happy. Of course, they don’t. So, we work even harder so we can buy better “things” only to find that those don’t really make us happier either. We consume and consume and are completely defined by our work. What’s one of the first things you ask someone when you meet them? “So, what do you do?” I mean, it’s even one of the main profile questions in Blogger, for Christ sake! Go to other parts of the world where people aren’t as stressed, and no one asks you “what do you do?” It’s immaterial.  Now, everyone’s on Prozac or Ritalin or Valium to control depression, anxiousness, malaise, etc. You just don’t see a lot of Buddhist monks on Prozac. Why? Because they know what’s important. And having the latest PDA, Audi, or trip to Mexico just isn’t it. I’m not saying we should all quit our jobs or go back to believing in a God that, quite frankly is as plausible as Santa Claus. I’m saying the Buddhists have it right. We need to become more introspective, more aware of the “real” world around us, more self-aware, more kind, more tolerant of others, and most importantly, more willing to create meaningful contact with other human beings.  How often have you walked down the street and avoided making eye contact with someone walking 2 feet away from you? How weird is that? It’s part of our whole culture of isolating ourselves and our stuff from each other. We interact at superficial levels now – customer service calls, PTA meetings, speed dating, mass seminars. Real human interaction has come to a standstill. Ironically, through the anonymity of the Internet, many of us (myself included) are reaching out and making “real” contact with complete strangers while foregoing the intimacy of actual human contact. These are strange times we’re living in. Pass me the Prozac.

      I don't normally post jokes, and certainly not ones about someone else's countrymen. But, I thought this one was pretty good. It's from my Mom. Thanks, Mom!    The last 4 ex-U.S. Presidents are caught in a tornado, and off they whirl to OZ.           They finally make it to the Emerald City and came before the Great Wizard. "WHAT BRINGS YOU BEFORE THE GREAT WIZARD OF OZ?"           Jimmy Carter steps forward timidly:" I've come for some courage."           "NO PROBLEM!" says the Wizard. "WHO IS NEXT?"           Reagan steps forward, "Well........., I.......I think I need a brain."           "DONE" says the Wizard. "WHO COMES NEXT BEFORE THE GREAT AND POWERFUL OZ?"           Up steps George Bush Sr., sadly, "I'm told by the American people that I need a heart."           "I'VE HEARD IT'S TRUE!" says the Wizard. "CONSIDER IT DONE."           There is a great silence in the hall. Bill Clinton is just standing there, looking around, but doesn't say a word.           Irritated, the Wizard finally asks, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?"           "Is Dorothy here?"

      Heh Heh. Some guy in the line at  urlLink Tim Horton's  asked me if I was a nurse today. He thought I looked familiar. I thought it was some kind of strange pickup and gave him the shrug off.  It's only several hours later as I sit here at my desk that I realize he likely works in the same hospital as my older sister (we look disturbingly similar, all three of us). She's not a nurse, she's a pharmacy something-or-other, but it all makes sense now....

      I can't help but notice how disgusting my keyboard is right now. Did you know that your keyboard likely has more germs living on it than a public toilet?  urlLink Nice .

      He arrived late to the party. I'd already been heavily into the punch by then. His skin looked very tan against his white T-shirt. He was fit and beautiful and he knew it. He owned the room.  I was drawn to him immediately. We all were. And when he talked, it was like there wasn't anyone else in the room. He was so sure of himself. He knew who he was, and he didn't care if you liked him (but he knew you would). I melted. I was his. We talked most of the night.  And then he said those magical words. "My girlfriend..." As soon as he said it, he knew he'd blown it. The magic was over. Too bad. The vodka made it easier to recover, thankfully.  Having recognized his blunder, he made a quick exit and I went home alone.  I didn't know it then, but we would meet again. And eventually, against my better judegement, I'd marry him.

      "Mommy, you look different today. I like your hair up like that," says little Benjy.  "Thank you! I thought I'd dress up today," replies Mom.  "Well, you look different. You look..." Benjy hesitates  "Pretty?" Mommy supplies.  "No, that's not it." she answers.

      Here’s something I just dug out of the archives of my brain. It was stored under high school mysteries.  There was this girl, well  woman  now, really, who’s shadowed me all of my high school dating existence. I don’t know why and probably never will.  We went to the same school from the ages 10 to 19. I wasn’t great friends with her, but we shared some mutual friends, so I hung out with her off and on quite a bit for 10 grades (high school went to Grade 13 in Ontario until 2 years ago). I even visited her in the hospital in the 11th grade when she tried to kill herself. Apparently, she was also bulimic, but not very good at it from what I could tell. That’s a different post, though.  Anyway from the time I was 16 until the time I was 19, I dated these fellows:  Elvis (yeah, I’m not kidding), Anthony (broke my heart), Shane (bastard), Chris1 (geek), Chris2 (nice geek), Todd (sweetie), Jerry (eye candy). I can’t remember if this is totally accurate, but it contains the main gist.  I remember that while I was dating Anthony, having this funny “puke” feeling when I saw her at the local mini-mart and she had “Tania loves” on one Converse sneaker toe and “Elvis” on the other. I mean, how many Elvis’s are there in any anglo town? I thought it was weird that she would date an ex, as my friends didn’t usually do that to each other, but what the hell. She and Elvis became really good friends, from what I’ve heard. Anyway, she went on to date Chris1 not too long after we’d broken up.  I started to think then that it was a bit weird that she’d dated two of my ex’s, but I didn’t think much of it since I hadn’t dated either of them for very long, nor had I “done it” with them (in retrospect, I’ve decided that if you can’t say the word “sex” out loud, then you’re likely not mature enough to be having it).  She went on to have a serious relationship with Chris2, which I found extraordinarily creepy, as we’d been quite an item. That was at the height of her bulimia. She never went for Todd (who was by then in university), or Anthony (he had transferred to a different high school in Grade 11) but when Jerry and I broke up after the prom, he told me that she tried to seduce him shortly thereafter. He thought it was funny, but it just reaffirmed my paranoia. Apparently she also hooked up with Shane after our romance ended rather surreptitiously for reasons that I can only describe as “very bad.” I don’t know if she had the same problems with him that I did, but that’s a different story.  Anyway, at the time, I had no idea why she would want to date these guys. In retrospect, I think she had a lot of self-esteem issues and these guys were all readily available and recently rejected. They were all from our high school, and I had broken up with them all rather spinelessly and without thought for their feelings. I always wondered if she nursed their wounds and commiserated with them on what a nasty bitch I was. I used to think that I was just being paranoid and arrogant, but now I’m not so sure.  Sometimes I think about that whole thing and wonder if I should get her number from the last remaining high school friend that I still semi-contact and give her a call to find out what the hell all of that was about. But, then I think that it’s not important enough to worry about. And it isn’t. It just makes me shake my head a bit and smile. I'm also really glad that Arthur and I never dated in high school.

      Update on the kitten front for those who aren't sick to death of hearing about it. Sweetie loves the brushing. So does Zoro, but he's not so obvious about it.  Zoro either hides in the corner, or in his carrier. He doesn't run away when I brush him, though, and his quiet little motor turns on. As soon as Zoro starts purring, then Sweetie purrs for no reason and pushes his head against my hand. He wears his heart on his sleeve, that one does. It's very cute.  By the end of this week, I think we can consider them family members. :)

      For those of you who have seen the  urlLink Marineland  commercials, don't believe them. They are marketing geniuses. Basically, everything you see on the commercials is all that there is. It hasn't changed much since I went there when I was 12 (that's 21 years ago, for those counting).  They pimp out their animals to the guests. You can buy food and  urlLink feed  bears, deer,  urlLink killer whales  (I'm not kidding), and  urlLink Beluga whales . There must be twenty bears in their exhibit, and they're all begging for food. It's really sad.  The rides need some work. You know a ride is not good when your 4-year old tells you "that was lame." But the SkyScreamer was very good, and almost worth the 2 1/2 hour drive to Niagara Falls. Arthur wouldn't take us to actually see the Falls, though. Pity. Frankie and Benjy haven't seen them. Maybe next time.
