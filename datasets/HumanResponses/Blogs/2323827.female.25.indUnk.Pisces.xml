      The monster is napping, and I should be doing homework. The final drafts of ALL my poems are due to Professor Logan on Thursday. I'm avoiding my own iambic pentameter disasters.  I'm actually at my mom's house. Charlie went home yesterday to catch the game. We lost. Thanksgiving was uneventful, but nice--and The Monster's First. He ate mashed potatoes and cranberries (surprisingly, he seemed to enjoy those).  We went to church this morning. I haven't been going to a church regularly in a couple of years. At first I felt guilty, but now I don't miss it. I feel detached when others speak of their love for Christ. I do think He existed and I can even believe He's the Son of God--but most times I find myself wondering  What Has He Done For Me Lately ? I pray and feel like no one listens. It's a complicated thing, Christianity. Am I going to burn in Hell? If I am, does that bother me?  Most days it doesn't. What does that mean? Should I be concerned? Are all the Christians around me this disillusioned? Are they all faking it, too? What drives people to seek a higher power?   I think I know what drives me ... if us humans are all there is, this world seems much bleaker. We kill each other and hate and curse and ruin our planet--while simultaneously we can love and make love and be so extraordinarily kind. Everyone wants to think that their morals are the moral highground, the only set of rights and wrongs that matters. Christianity tells us that sex outside of marriage is wrong, homosexuality is wrong, divorce is wrong, abortion is wrong--but God is love.   God is love.   That's the only statement I can truly believe. Humans aren't love. We screw things up and cause each other much heartache. But just where is that line that separates what God  really  said from what humans  think  he's saying? What makes me right and a Buddhist or a Muslim wrong? Christians don't like to say other religions are wrong--the terms I was taught to use are  misguided  or  uninformed .  But what if I'm the one that's misguided and uniformed? How will I ever know? I don't understand. This is why I don't miss my weekly visits to the House of God. It's also why I continue to pray.

        Do you ever get a break, I wonder, from how fiercely you love them? I'm just curious... how are you supposed to let them leave home, lose jobs, get their hearts trampled on? I know everyone does it, everyone survives it. But sometimes it just seems so unlikely, unless I can just get a little respite from this horrible hot love that hits me behind the knees. Motherhood can be such a mindfuck.     The paragraph above was taken from HipMama.com--it hit me particularly hard today. Motherhood IS a mindfuck. Just last night I was looking at Jack and wondering how those big eyes came to be looking at me, and for just a millisecond I resented him. And then I felt guilty.  Little Jack, do you know what I've given up to be your mother? A lot of times I'm lonely. My body feels like someone else's and by the end of the day I just want to be left alone. I barely sleep. I don't know if I'll ever get to go to grad school. I want more for myself, but I don't know how to get it and help you along as well. Your tears cause me such pain.  But Little Jack, do you know what you've given me? You'e given me a focus, a reason to keep trying to better myself. You'e made me stop and think about my words, my actions--even my thoughts. I want you to have all the things in this world that are goodness and light. I want to make you smile, to see your cheeks push up the corners of your eyes until your two white teeth are visible, shining pearl-like in your mouth. I want to hear you laugh the way you do--when suddenly, inexplicably, the giggles escape before you can contain them. They come from the very bottom of your feet and spread upward, bursting from you and into this world that can barely contain your brilliance. I love your dimpled hands and the way you use them to explore and play with fierce determination.   There is nothing like you in the universe.

      Another day, even less sleep. I have much work to do today. A paper and then an exam to study for, both are happening this evening. And I have a little boy who won't stay put, which makes getting any work done very difficult. In the spring he's going to day care, and I am going to have to do as much work as possible while he's there. But in May I'm graduating and leaving UF forever (not Gainesville, just the university).  Anyway, I have much to do and less time to do it in. I leave you with this:   Does not my heat astound you? And my light? All by myself I am a huge camellia Glowing and coming and going, flush on flush.   My thanks to Sylvia Plath.

        Is anyone else tired of diamond commercials?    I keep seeing those assanine "every kiss begins with Kay" ads and frankly they piss me off. OF COURSE every kiss begins with 'k'! What's so great about diamonds anyway? I personally wear a few, but only because my wonderful husband had his grandmother's heirloom diamonds made into an exquisite engagement ring for me. They could easily have been heirloom amethysts or rubies and I would love them just as much. The point is that they were a gift from the love of my life, not that they're cut with lasers and painstakingly polished with individual grains of imported Mexican beach sand (white only). Seriously, without these ridiculous slogans we might all be wearing granite.

       Singin’ in the Rain   The square, tan buildings lining the streets stand grouped in uniform blocks-- the fabricated city of MGM Studios, hoping for another blockbuster  under the conspicuous white letters of Hollywood. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds tap dance on a backlot, shim sham shimmying in yellow slickers and heavy black galoshes.  They’re soaked and smiling, twirling their umbrellas, patiently waiting  for the director to perfect his dolly shot and call, “cut!”  Debbie’s coiff is starting to wilt, while Gene’s wool suit shrinks under studio rain. The costumer notices a button’s gone--  filming is forced to stop. There is a scramble on the soundstage, interns scurrying,  scattering in nervous haste--  the director’s head is in his hands. Gene and Debbie wander to their trailers as the sky fades to black  behind the conspicuous white letters of Hollywood.  That's my little poem, inspired by my favorite musical of the same title. Whatcha think?

      Monday.  Jack-monster woke me up at 6:15, which is just about six hours and fifteen minutes after I went to sleep--if you don't count the two times I had to get up and rock him back to sleep, at 1:20 and 3 am (respectively). Charlie went back to work today, so he brought the monster in to lay next to me. Usually he latches on and goes into a milk coma for a couple more precious hours ... but not today. Why would he? I have class until 10:30 tonight and he knows it--baby's plot to ensure that his mother gets nowhere near the amount of sleep she needs. The good thing is that I can now function (with a smile on my face most days) with WAY less rest than I used to get. And a little creative use of concealer never hurts ...  Last night Jack learned to say, "ba." Today it's the syllable (word?) of the day. But the really big news is that the child--my one and only Jack monster--has learned to climb to the second stair, and STAND UP on it. He can't walk, but he can climb--just high enough to stand   over the tile floor  , where he could crack his partially fused little skull wide open lest he fall. Did I mention that he's only seven months old?  In other news ... this blog spot service will not let me post pictures unless I send them $10/month. Right. That'll happen.

      The Day The Weekly World News Came to Gainesville  I am seated in folding chair number thirteen, second row, on the right side of the Hippodrome's performance stage. I am here to see Bat Boy: The Musical--which, according to the playbill, is “an improbable musical comedy about a charismatic but bloodthirsty freak of nature who longs to be a normal boy." A true story. The theater has been elaborately decorated to look like the cave in Hope Falls, West Virginia where Bat Boy was discovered. Fog is rolling over the set from somewhere backstage, lending an aura of cave-like mustiness to the stalactites and stalagmites jutting from the ceiling and floor. Pre-recorded bats screech and titter as we wait for the show to begin.   “Can I have the program?” My husband Charlie is seated on my left next to his brother Chris, Chris’s girlfriend Sharon and our mutual friends Joe and Laura. We sit and talk and pass around our playbills. “I love that we can bring our beer in from the concession stand.” Sharon has purple dreadlocks and an abiding affection for good beer and sideshow freaks. “Does anyone want some popcorn?”   “We were going to get Bat Boy t-shirts, but we weren’t sure we wanted to subscribe to six months of the Weekly World News.” Joe and Laura might be Bat Boy’s biggest fans. They have been deeply engrossed in the mutant’s story since 1992, and make sure to read the updates regularly provided by The Weekly World News. Most recently they read that Bat Boy had successfully graduated college and was off to find Bin Laden or join the space program. According to Joe, Bat Boy was torn between “doing his patriotic duty” and “furthering the scientific knowledge of mankind.”   Without warning, the theater grows dark and the music begins. "In a cave many miles to the souuuth, there’s a boy born with fangs in his mouuuth”. The singing is loud and enthusiastic and sounds more like the entire cast of Cats than the mere ten performers on stage. “Hold me Bat Boy, touch me Bat Boy! Love me Bat Boy, save me Bat Boy!"  Even so, I forget to listen when a spotlight illuminates the naked man with pointy ears who has just entered from stage right -- Bat Boy. He shinnies up the nearest cave formation, a stalactite hanging so low it nearly reaches the floor. Sharon punches Chris in the shoulder and Laura can barely contain her glee. Someone wolf whistles.   It seems four teenage spelunkers--two boys and two girls--from Hope Falls are pursuing Bat Boy after glimpsing him deep in the cave they were exploring.  “The child is something less than beast--but more than maaaan!” He’s clinging to the stalactite and breathing hard. I can see how big and frightened his eyes are even though the ‘cave’ is dark.  The group surrounds him, shining their lights in his face. Bat Boy hisses and comes down, snapping his teeth and whipping his head in every direction. They try to speak to him, but he doesn’t understand. He can only screech--after all, he was raised by bats.  They poke and stare at him until he bites one of the girls and escapes into the darkness.   “Ouch! I’m bleeding!” The other three spelunkers manage to get her out of the cave and to the hospital, where they tell their story. “We were exploring the caves outside of town and we found this half-man, half-bat creature ... at least I think that’s what it was. It was definitely angry.” The serious nature of the situation prompts the townspeople to organize a meeting. They gather in the town hall and everyone is offered the chance to voice their opinion.  The sheriff stands up first, rifle in hand. “I think we should kill him and get it over with.” A young mother is next. “What if he bites someone else? What if he has rabies?”   Because the cast is so small, some men are playing the parts of women. One is a grandmotherly type who finds the idea of a mutant living in a cave absolutely scandalous. ‘She’ is wearing a thickly knitted white sweater and a kerchief over her curlers.  Clutching her handbag close to her chest with her white-gloved hands, she expresses her disbelief to her neighbor in a shocked whisper. “The creature was naked?” I hear Joe snickering in the background. “Nice dress.”  When the town meeting ends, a furious crowd led by the sheriff heads off in search of Bat Boy. With torches in hand and a song on their lips they set forth enthusiastically. “See him run through the swaaamps and the bogs, watch him feed on the fliiies and the frogs.” Their plan is to capture the creature and auction him off to the highest bidder. But when they reach the cave, Bat Boy is gone. As it happens, he was taken home by one of the teenagers who originally found him. Rather than attend the town meeting, she returned to the cave and gently lured Bat Boy home with her, where she hoped to civilize him.  When the girl--Shelley Parker--gets Bat Boy home, the family decides to adopt him.  Things get tricky when it is discovered that he can only survive by drinking blood-- but they persevere and manage to dress and civilize him anyway. By intermission, Bat Boy has dubbed himself Edgar and is flawlessly speaking the King’s English, cooking fabulous four-course meals and designing his own clothes.  He can arrange flowers and serve tea and is an accomplished ballroom dancer.   His genius and wit secure him the affection of Shelley and her entire family.  But the town sees things differently. They dislike Edgar despite his talents and decide that they must be rid of him. It is decided that Edgar should be dispatched to the nearest research facility. The Parker family fights to prove that Edgar is not a monster, and before long Shelley’s affection for Edgar becomes love.    A tryst is arranged in the forest just outside Hope Falls.  While the sun sets, Shelley and Edgar make love under the trees. The ground underneath them is strewn with wildflowers and autumn leaves of every color. The forest ‘creatures’--cast members with various stuffed animals strapped to their heads and belted around their waists--dance around the lovers while the forest god Pan watches over everything. “Hold me Bat Boy, touch me Bat Boy! Love me Bat Boy, save me Bat Boy!” Joe, Charlie, Laura, Chris and Sharon are all laughing out loud. As the actors leap and prance around making animal sounds, my companions are forced to cover their mouths with their hands.  Their pleasant interlude is interrupted by an angry crowd, led by Shelley’s father. “Kill him! He’s attacked her!” Shelley covers her bare breasts and steps in front of Edgar. “You can’t! I love him!” Mr. Parker steps in front of her. “Shelley, it’s time you knew the truth.” He explains that Edgar is really Shelley’s twin brother, conceived after Mrs. Parker was raped by bats following an unfortunate pheromone accident at the lab where she worked. At the birth there were two babies--Shelley (the normal one) and Edgar (the half-human, half-bat monstrosity). The Parkers decided to keep Shelley, but left Edgar in a cave to die or get eaten by wild animals.    After imparting this tale, Mr. Parker shoots himself. Shelley runs away and Edgar goes insane. In his rage, he sets fire to the town hall, kills five people and gorges himself on the blood of a cow, an act for which he apologizes with a song appropriately titled Apology to a Cow.  He then escapes back to the caves from which he came, leaving Shelley fatherless and shocked. In the aftermath, the townspeople realize the enormity of their folly. “We should have accepted him.” They begin to sing, softly, gravely. “Hold me Bat Boy, touch me Bat Boy!” The lights dim and the show is over. “I don’t know whether to clap or cry.” Sharon is clutching her playbill, looking amused. “That was like Othello. Everyone dies, except I don’t feel as sorry for them. But I guess even mutants need love.”

      So. It's been a while. I bet all of you who might have been reading my nattering have completely lost interest by now.   Jack has to go to daycare next Tuesday so I can go to class, and I can't tell you how much it breaks my heart. Will the daycare workers make sure to hug him and give him his blanket when he's upset? Will they know how to hold him to get him to sleep, and will they love watching his eyelids flutter into rest as I do? Will they kiss his hurts and call him "Monster" and smile and clap when he does something miraculous? Because Jack is a miracle--and he's mine. The daycare can never take care of him like I do. I can read his moods, his expressions, his gutteral little grunts and his babbling. He has no words, but it doesn't matter. Will it always be this way? This unspoken and physical dance between Jack and I? I am afraid that daycare will take it away.

        Evolution    Monogrammed silver soup spoons? Wine charms? A cashmere dog sweater? I shall sit here as I am, and buy something frivolous, so. Today the blown-out umbrella will stay in the coat closet! No bottomless parking lot puddles will swallow my shoes! Instead, I will lounge here under the glow of fluorescent lights, all the world reflected in my pupils.

      The rash is back. I thought it was a yeast infection, so I applied some gentian violet. Poor Jack-monster--his little bum is raw and red and the gentian violet's faded purple makes it look like I beat him.   I just gave him a bath because he cries when I use baby wipes on him. Now he's sitting, reading his books in the nude. Dear naked boy! ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***   ***    He found his penis this week--like all men, he's fascinated by it. His new favorite trick is to grab onto it while I'm applying Desitin or A&D. And I wonder--if girls had the same relationship with their "nether regions" that boys do, would they feel better about themselves? Would they put a higher value on their bodies and the wonderful things they're capable of? Would they feel cleaner and less ashamed? Would sex be more enjoyable and less painful? And most of all, would women let men treat them in ways that are obviously misogynistic?  I think not. Just something to think about.

        Jesus Goes Business    Today I walked through Turlington Plaza and saw a man wearing a sign that said, "GOD IS ANGRY WITH THE SINNERS." The sign was attached to a long metal pole on a harness--it looked like the sail on a ship. I imagined the man, with his message of "love," blowing away on the breeze. Am I a sinner? Should I get a sign-sail and stand next to him? Would that get me into heaven? It made me feel better that the Gay, Lesbian, and Bisxual student group was set up at a table not six feet away with signs advertising, "Same-Sex Hand Holding Day."  I wonder what campus preachers and sign holders think they're accomplishing. Does yelling at students about their mortal sins  really  win any converts? All I know is, Jesus is my homeboy. :) (I'm getting the shirt)    Time to Get Mad, Girls    I recently learned that hospital policies all over the state are changing--women (like myself) who have delivered by c-section will no longer be allowed to attempt a vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC).   Why? Insurance. Liability. Malpractice. My previous c-section means that I am at higher risk for uterine rupture. Nevermind that I am young and healthy. Nevermind that the way Jack's birth happened was a fluke. Hospital policies will now dictate the way I give birth.   Is this fair? Is it even the hospital's right? If this doesn't change, I will be denied the opportunity to birth my children naturally. I will be denied the experience of labor and the chance to bond with my babies as soon as they emerge. Instead I will be cut open on an operating table and the baby will be examined and taken to the nursery.  An unmedicated birth will be out of the question. When I come home from the hospital, I will be recovering from major surgery and taking Percocet for pain. To some women this may seem unimportant--but for me it's monumental.   And you know, I wouldn't argue. If for some reason a c-section was necessary again, I would be ok with that. But the fact that hospitals and insurance can deny me my right to choose--all I want is the opportunity to attempt a VBAC.   Giving birth to Jack was one of the most important and amazing things I've ever done. I was in labor for twenty-eight hours before I became desperate to sleep. I checked into the hospital so I could rest. My body was so tired--I begged to go to the hospital when I broke down and cried for the third time. It was at the hospital that it was discovered that my baby was in distress. Jack, dear little boy, was stuck in there with the cord wrapped around his neck twice. There was meconium in the amniotic fluid, and an infection in my placenta. The c-section saved his life.  I had planned for a natural birth. I was going to use midwives, and give birth without medication in a large, soft bed while Charlie held my hand. I was going to eat when I wanted to, walk if I needed to, and listen to music if it helped. I was going to float in the bathtub and breathe deeply and burn candles. I was going to scream or curse or cry without embarassment, without shame. I was going to sweat and bleed and will my baby into this world. I was going to hold him on my chest while he learned to breathe the air. Charlie would have cut the umbilical cord, but only after it had stopped being useful. The midwives would never have taken Jack where I couldn't see him. That's what I wanted, and it's still what I would choose if I could.   Who's right is it to tell me how I give birth?

        Randomosity    The state of the union? Dysfunctional. Bush must go. (You say you want a revolution?Well, you know...)  The state of my IUD? Just fine. I had it checked via ultrasound yesterday, and it's still there. No more babies yet.  Jack is getting his two front teeth. That makes four. There goes the gummy grin that made me fall in love! But this will be better. :)  Tomorrow is Friday and I have more homework than one person can do. But it's my last semester--so bring it on!  Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming ...

        Aspirations, Part I    My friend Lori is going to be a writer--and I think it's great. I know her because I'm married to Charlie, her and a whole lot of other brave and wonderful people who aren't afraid to just  be .  I've spent my whole life (ok, I'm not that old, but still) trying to decide who and what I want to be. From the time I was about nine until I reached college and started taking classes, I wanted to be a veterinarian. Horses. They were, and still are, one of my passions.   As a child, I ate, slept, walked, and dreamed horses. I read everything in the local library about them, from Marguerite Henry's  Misty of Chincoteague  to Walter Farley's  The Black Stallion . My favorite book in the  Chronicles of Narnia  was the fifth-- The Horse and His Boy . I could differentiate between bays, buckskins, palominos, and chestnuts. I knew what to do if a horse was colicking and how to braid a tail. I knew what they ate, the length of their gestation, and the difference between a gelding and a stallion.   I begged to take lessons, but my parents didn't have the money. So I made friends with horse people and mucked stalls and polished bridles and picked hooves as often as I could, all in the hope that someone would set me on top of their horse and teach me to ride.   I was never afraid and never got tired of the barn chores, no matter how tedious. All that mattered was that I could stand next to these creatures and look into their eyes and run my fingers through their manes that felt like unraveled twine. I could bury my face in their necks and breath the wonderful earthy smell that is horse. To this day my heaven is a barn.  But I digress. College was a rude shock. I had always struggled with math, but not with science. I was in science research. I spent three years (7th, 8th and 9th grade)working on a continuous project about the ozone layer and plankton populations--and I won awards. I was on the Science Olympiad team, placing in the Name That Organism (an exercise in taxonomy) and Cell Biology competitions. I got 'A's and had excellent research skills.  But then, I enrolled in basic college chemistry. And biology. Two classes that quickly became (to use a cliche) the bane of my existence. I sucked. I couldn't have made an 'A' if the professor had given me all the answers. So, I changed my major. Three times.  to be continued...

      A few weeks ago, my friend of Snark posted this question on her website: Why do you journal?  I never answered the post, but it did get me thinking. Why *do* I journal? What drives me to post my private thoughts and ideas and dreams on this very public forum? I have several reasons--here are just a few:  1.  That's what writers do.  Writing, like any art form, is about taking risks. It's about putting thought and emotion on the line and trusting that someone will either understand or appreciate what you're doing. And to hell with the people that don't get it, or find it offensive. I am only me--all I have is my point of view.  2.  I need the practice.  Because someday I might want to do this for a living. I might want to spin my thoughts into a tale or a volume of poetry for the world to behold. I might want to be the mighty editor of a fresh magazine for other women my age, other women who are just as frustrated as me about the way the world works.  3.  So I can say fuck.  A word I hardly ever allow myself to utter out loud. I can always write the things I cannot say. I can ask the forbidden questions and sometimes arrive at some answers.  4.  Because if I don't, I may go insane.  So much of my day is devoted to other people. If I don't give myself something that's truly mine, I run the risk of exploding into a billion tiny shards of my former self. Writing is fat free and therapeutic. No psychologist can give me what I've found in the written word.  5.  Writing is becoming a lost art.  For the love of words, people! I want to know every nuance and shade of this language and I want to make it mine.   "Like a poet, I have my reasons."

      Homework is taking over my life. There's so much that if it falls off my desk you may never see me again.   In other news...maybe I shouldn't share this, but this is a woman/mommy blog, and the problem is decidely one that only a woman could have.  I can't find the string to my IUD. Oh, and I've been having debilitating cramps for the last two months. I thought it was because I had yet to menstruate after giving birth to Jack, but now I'm not so sure. But instead of scaring me, the whole thing leaves me with a sort of vague sense of exhaustion. As if I needed one more thing to think about. Am I destined to live forever in birth control hell, getting only the odd "vacation"--the surprise pregnancy?  Because girls, Jack is a condom baby. Birth control pills make me a psycho hose-beast at high doses, and at low doses I can't shake the UTIs and yeast infections. I was so excited that I was eligible for the IUD after Jack.   Finally, a low dose of hormones with no maintenance! No stopping to fumble for it in the dark! No mentally calculating when my last period was and wondering if I'm in what I like to call the "danger zone!" My periods would be lighter! My cramps would be gone! I would once again be the barren goddess of zero pregnancies and lots of sex!  But it looks like it wasn't meant to be.

      Jack-monster has a rash like a belligerent vermillion continent creeping over his white skin. He cries when I change his diaper and pushes my hands away. I let him loose without a diaper this afternoon. Picture it--he's wearing a t-shirt, socks and shoes, but otherwise he's buck naked. There's nothing cuter than a baby without his pants.  Of course, he peed on the carpet--but there's something wonderful about his lack of social graces. He burps and farts and throws food and pees in the bathtub. He eats furballs off the rug and plays in his vomit and splashes in the dogs' water bowl. He puts the dogs' bone in his mouth and hums into it like it's a didgeridoo--and just yesterday I caught him sharing his watermelon with Leo. (yes, Leo eats fruit, but that's another story)  My favorite thing is to watch him offer the dog some food, let the dog lick it, and then take it back and eat it himself. Hey, at least he's sharing.  And it's not that Jack isn't gross. Because he is. I love him, but he's one of the nastiest little people I've ever met. But what I love about his utter lack of manners and propriety is that every time he does something gross or weird or silly--he's learning. Jack's world is a wonderful place. Nothing is too slimy or too dirty to touch. Hairballs and dirt and ants and sharing your food with the dog are all things worth exploring. To Jack, there is nothing more exciting than cause and effect. And for me, there's nothing cooler than watching him figure it out.

      What a long weekend. But it ended with something good! I finally got my poetry portfolio back, and the results were very pleasing. I got an 'A'--46.5 out of 50, ohhh yeah! AND, the professor said (I quote):  "Your lovely taste for description drew the poems into the world of language from that other world we all live in...your elephant poem was surprising in its deft manipulation. There were so many excellent poems here, it's hard to choose...I hope you'll consider further workshops and perhaps graduate school."   WOO-HOO!! This man is one of the most hated and feared poetry critics in the US, a poet himself. High praise, indeed!! It's nice to be rewarded for working my ass off. :)  And now, I will treat you all to one of my best (according to my professor)--oh, and this one's for Ahmed, who never believed my poetry amounted to anything much.    Blame Jesus    When you asked me to marry you, I could tell by your eyes you didn't really want me to say yes. You handed me a second-rate ring and I said yes-- unsure why  agreed to spend my life with you. We kissed and I closed my eyes,  wanting to forget all the wasted guile in the blue bedroom of finite pleasures-- and that I ever found you attractive. I often asked if you found me attractive, needing to be sure you were properly beguiled, that I was your only pleasure.  Next year, you won't be there to get drunk and ruin my birthday. I don't want your second-rate ring or your new-found devotion to Jesus. If you need to blame somebody, blame Jesus-- and I hope you remember me next time you're drunk and wondering why your life is so second-rate.

      The saga continues...   So, I took Jack by the daycare to meet the teachers today. He had a good time playing with the toys and one of the other babies, a little fat blondie named Jade. I was just getting used to the idea when the director called me into her office.  "I'm *so* sorry, but we can't accept your son. Some of the employees have decided to enroll their children, and we can only take applicants from the general public on a space available basis."  "No problem." That's what I said--even though I was thinking "shit shit SHIT what the hell am I supposed to do now?" I thanked the woman for her time, picked Jack up, and walked out the door. It was like ending a good date with a break up.   For three months, I operated under the assumption that Jack would be going to the Civitan daycare center on 13th St.  I applied early to make sure there was space--only to be left without childcare on the day before school starts.  Thanks a pantload, Civitan.  So I came home and started making phone calls. While I'm still bitter, I think this little day care problem could be a blessing in disguise. The good news? We're getting a nanny.  Since no one takes infants part time, it's actually cheaper to pay for in-home care part time than to pay full time at a center. And I have never been happier! I'm leery of even the best daycares, and I've only heard good things about the nanny agency I spoke with today.  Still, I wonder--why is it *so* hard to find good daycare at an affordable price?

      [insert primal scream here]  Have you ever asked someone to leave you alone and been pissed when they ignored you?  It happened to me.  About three years ago, before I met my wonderful, sexy, Irish redhead of a husband, I was dating a nondescript, short man of middle eastern origin. I pretended to be in love with him, mostly because it seemed like the thing to do at the time. My best friend was getting married and leaving me, and I was heartbroken and confused. I desperately wanted someone to love me like Marc loved Allison. Then I met Ahmed--and I thought he was a jerk.  But somehow we ended up together, and the sex wasn't bad. But everything else about the relationship was. He made me cry frequently and failed to apologize for anything. He told me I was too needy and the guilt trip always worked. I would apologize and then we'd have sex. We were together a year and a half.  My prevailing memories are of tears, pornography, and heated arguments about whether art is or is not a career choice. I would argue that YES art is a valid way to make a living, and dammit I was going to prove it. I would rail at Ahmed for his drawerful of dirty magazines and his love for jerking off almost daily. Once he suggested we rent a dirty movie to help inspire our love life. He spent the whole time looking past me, trying to see the porn. I asked him repeatedly to get rid of the magazines, and he would. But somehow they'd creep back into the drawer of his nightstand.  You know, it wasn't the porn that bothered me. It was the fact that he preferred a magazine and some lotion over me.  We took a trip to NY over one spring break. I LOVED New York, but I can't help but think my experience would have been more enjoyable if I'd been with someone else. We saw CATS in the Winter Garden Theater, and ice skated in Rockefeller Center. We went to the top of the Empire State Building, and rode the Staten Island Ferry. We didn't make it to Greenwich Village, but we did go to FAO Schwartz. The Met was closed--but I think it's better we didn't go. For a man that was so against me pursuing a career in the arts, Ahmed would have probably just ruined my time there.  I remember an argument we had, when he told me I was ungrateful, that nothing was ever enough for me. He never understood that buying me things wasn't the way to win me. He never said I love you unless I said it first and there was no compassion in his eyes for the homeless people we met in NY.   He drove a teal minivan that was his prized possession. I hated that minivan, and to this day I cringe whenever I see one. Once, when he was drunk and he'd picked a fight with me, I got out of the van and slammed the door as hard as I could, just to piss him off. He'd bought it used because it was "practical." It had been owned by some old people's home and had barely any miles on it. He washed it and waxed it like it was a '65 Corvette.  The only nice thing he ever did for me was to get me a kitten when my beloved blue-eyed Siamese, Luna, was put down by the pound. She was a stray and it was all a mistake. Ahmed took me to the pet store and let me pick out my orange babydoll boy, Leo. He paid for everything, and never held it against me.  It all fell part at my 21st birthday party. Ahmed got drunk and threw a beer during a fight he started. "Fuck you," he said. To me, the person he supposedly loved and was going to marry. And do you know what I did? Instead of kicking him in the shins and throwing him out by the curb, I cried and begged him not to drive home. He was drunk, and I was afraid he was going to kill someone.   Like an ass, he got in his stupid minivan and drove home anyway. It was at that moment that I knew it was over. I went to his apartment the next day and made him talk to me. He was still hung over and didn't want to see me. He was unapologetic. "Tell me now, do you or do you not want to get married?" I asked him, point blank, knowing what the answer would be and not caring. Suddenly, in that moment, I was free and it was beautiful. "No." He said no, I knew he would.   I handed him the ring back and left. There were tears, but not many. When he realized what had happened, Ahmed suddenly turned apologetic. Then he found religion. Religion had been one of our major problems. At the time I was dating him, I was heavily involved in a church group, and I asked him to join me because I thought it was important. As with everything else, Ahmed belittled me and refused to even consider it. After the breakup, he found Jesus. Like it was going to change my mind.  I had found my inner bitch, and I love her dearly for her part in helping me out of a dead-end relationship. I was going to marry a man who didn't really love me, a man with an anger management problem and a belief that buying me things would make me stick around. He only spent $200 on my engagement ring. Not that price matters, but he made me promise not to ask the jeweler, like it was a big secret.   When I made it clear that I was done with him, Ahmed gave me the ring and made me promise not to get rid of it. I told him I wouldn't, but the next day I sold it back to the jewelry store. And I didn't care. It was a pretty ring, but why would I keep it? As a memory of the marriage that almost happened? So I could keep replaying the beer flying past me while Ahmed shouted "fuck you"?   I met Charlie a couple of months after I dumped Ahmed. Charlie was over one night and Ahmed called to heckle me. "Who's Charlie?" As if he had any right to my personal life. Ever since then he's contacted me at random moments to say hello, to update me on his life. "I'm getting my masters, and my PhD and I'm in the Army and my friend Danny is getting married so how are you?" I NEVER ask for these details and frankly could care less. I have asked repeatedly for him to stop contacting me, to let me get on with my life. But today he tried again.  There is much to this story I haven't told you. Most of it isn't important. It all boils down to this: Ahmed gave me a ring and a cat. I kept the cat.

        It's raining babies    They're everywhere!! My niece, Emma Sinclair, was born on January 7 and my nephew, Cervantes Domingo, was born on February 16--but the newest addition is finally here!! Isaac Andrew was born on February 25 and he's the cutest baby I've ever seen! (well, maybe not cuter than Jack, but I could be biased...)  I've never seen a baby come into the world. I was under general anesthesia for Jack's birth and have absolutely no memory of it. When they handed him to me in recovery, I wasn't even sure he was mine. I had to "take their word for it." The tiny, swaddled stranger was hungry in that frantic way newborn babies are and I was unsure what to make of him. For me, the miracle of birth was really just major surgery that ended with me trying to breastfeed while recovering from an anesthesia hangover. And that's not to say that it  wasn't  miraculous--things were touch-and-go at the end, and the possibility that we could have lost Jack was very real.    Still, I want another child.  The urgency of my desire for another baby is intense and frightening. It's completely beyond my control. It's a tsunami threatening to swallow this town.   I am starting to forget things, Important Things that were my Reasons for waiting three or four or five years to give Jack a sibling. I remember that labor was painful, but the memory of the exact pain rating on a scale of 1 to 10 is foggy. Breastfeeding was hard--once I got out of the shower crying, because the water running over my nipples was so painful.   There were lots of tears. I cried because I was tired, because Jack wasn't latching on properly, because I was afraid my sex drive would never return. I cried because my clothes didn't fit, because it was tricky to shower and take care of the baby, because Jack was always hungry.   I was angry at my stretch marks and my glaring "bikini line" incision. There is no feeling between my belly button and the top of the cut--all the nerves were severed. I was angry the day Charlie went back to work and I stayed home to change poopy diapers and nurse Jack from sore breasts. I was angry that breastfeeding meant I only got sleep in two or three hour chunks. Most of all I was angry that I'm not Super Woman.   Why couldn't I do laundry and dishes and make dinner and clean the litterbox and vacuum and dust while taking care of Jack? Why did I feel guilty for sleeping when Jack slept, while the house slowly deteriorated around us? Why couldn't I look in the mirror and love this body that had sustained life, that was still sustaining it?   Still, I want another child.   I look at Jack and I wonder--when did he get to be so grown up? When did his shy, gummy smile turn into the ear-to-ear, nose-wrinkling grin full of teeth? When did he become the master of his pudgy fingers, able to grasp even the smallest cheerio or scrap of paper? When did he decide the world was calling him to explore, to climb, to laugh, to win independence with each new skill?   I look at his little blue and white velcro sneakers and I know because he can walk the toes will never be worn that way again. He doesn't need me to hold his bottle and he can feed himself-- he hates it when I hold the spoon. He knows how to put his hat on and turn off a light switch. He says "da" for dog and claps for the vacuum cleaner. He points at things and smiles at strangers in the grocery store.   He's learning to manipulate me and that's the hardest thing. It was so easy to love him, to play and to make him laugh, to dream about what he'd be. It was easy to forget that I am supposed to mold him and teach him the rules. Play fair, don't hit, eat lots of vegetables, and pick up your own mess. Vote however you want, don't be disrespectful, don't put your fingers in electrical sockets, look both ways before you cross the street, don't have sex with someone you don't love. Plant a tree when you get the chance, remember that even handicapped kids have feelings, and don't forget to brush your teeth.  Somehow I was chosen to raise this little boy, to make him wise and good and respectful. Some days I wonder--why me? What Great Knowledge or Skill do I have to pass on? When did I become the Responsible Adult?   *endnote: I am not doing this alone--Charlie is a wonderful, helpful, loving spouse and father. Of course, this blog is mostly about me and my relationship to the people and world around me.

        Good news...    I think I found a home for Hogan. A woman named Kim emailed me after seeing my classified ad on petfinder.com. She had to put her Himalayan to sleep a year ago and is looking for a new cat to love. She has no children and no other pets, and lives alone somewhere near Tampa. She wants Hogan! And has the time and the energy to make him use his litterbox! I am so excited--Hogan will get to be adored and she will have a new feline friend to brighten her days. A match made in heaven, yes?   To be honest, I was rather disappointed when Persian Rescue wouldn't take him. Being a responsible pet owner with too many animals, I didn't want anything bad to happen to the cat. But I must admit I had visions of a mat by the front door and one in the downstairs bathroom--maybe even one in the kitchen! I was pining for one catbox rarely used by an indoor/outdoor cat.  Dreams can come true...  This morning when I was getting ready to come to school, Jack decided he needed to be held. Only I would do, and every time I set him down he hunched his shoulders, bowed his head, and wailed like his heart was breaking. I tried to make my lunch with one hand, but he gets heavy and it's really hard to put cookies in one of those foldover sandwich bags that way. As I walked out the door Jack was crying hysterically, as if he might never see me again.   It's a phase and all I can do is be patient with him. It's frustrating though, when I need to get something done and Jack  won't  go play with his Daddy. It frustrates Charlie, too--it's hard to spend time with a child who only wants his mommy. And you know, it's not like I even have to be paying attention to him. He just doesn't like it when I'm at the laptop doing my homework. He wants me to be sitting on the floor while he plays with his blocks or his car, or when he tortures Leo. He wants me there so every few minutes he can climb into my lap and smile at me and then be on his way. Just checkin' in.   When this semester is over and I've graduated--then I'm all Jack's. I won't have to feel guilty that he may be suffering because I have to do homework or because I have to leave him early on Thursday mornings, right after he wakes up.  In the meantime, I'm working hard to be productive at naptime and after he goes to bed. School isn't everything and Jack is changing fast.   Anyway, I'm off to see if CLAS publications will give me any hack editing assignments to keep me busy. Because I don't have enough to do.  And I need to turn in my library books, and eat something because I'm starving, and then go meet Prof. Burt for a conference about my progress in his class.

        I'm sorry, we're busy in Iraq...    Oil interests, you know. Which is why we can't go to Haiti and help supress the violent uprising. We helped you in 1994, Haiti. This one's on you. Just don't send any of your "boat people" here, we are no longer the land of opportunity. The Statue of Liberty doesn't really want your huddled masses. She's too busy protecting her Own Interests, and we're too busy moving troops around on sandtables and scaring everyone in the US into thinking that soon there might be a Major Oil Crisis and that Saddam's Weapons of Mass Destruction are pointed at us even now. We still have some Iraqi Villians at large--you know the ones, from that handy deck of playing cards. And when we tire of that we can always inexplicably raise the terror alert from serious to imminent, from green to orange. We can leak tidbits to the press about our "intelligence" and make everyone forget about the bodybags. Everyone gets really riled up when we mention Osama Bin Laden. When we find that bastard ... so you see, we're really very busy with this Important Business.  ***            ***                  ***                  ***                ***            ***         ***  Bush is a sneaky S.O.B. Click  urlLink here  and read about the crisis in Haiti and why we aren't doing anything to help. It certainly backs up one of the initial problems with going to war in Iraq--now we're the World Playground Monitors. "Play nice, we said Aristide gets to be the leader." If Bush is so truly motivated by Democracy and Equality and Opportunity, why shouldn't the Haitians get some of it? Why not go storming into the country, flags flying high on our tanks, and make them all get along?  Because it doesn't work. Bush knows that. Colin Powell knows that. Every Republican and Democrat in the Senate, the House, and Bush's cabinet knows it, too. So what made going to war so easy? Bush played on our fears. The nation was ripe for it after September 11. We wanted revenge--for all our humanity, it's really just an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I wonder what would happen if the President was more concerned about the U.S.'s actual welfare than saving face?

        Shakespeare Wallah...the movie that didn't go off    We were all there in class tonight, ready to watch it, but it turns out the prof's DVD was in Powell format and UF doesn't possess a single DVD player that can play that.  Damn.  I lost my wallet this weekend. It was brand new, red, with Felix the Cat on it. I lost my student ID, my driver's license, and some other essentials that I won't mention here. It's as if aliens beamed it aboard their spaceship, because we've looked everywhere and it's just gone.   But today turned out to be an exciting day--my sister-in-law, Chelsea, had her baby! Mom and baby are both doing fine, but the really big news is that Isabella turned out to be a boy! 9lbs. 5 ozs. worth of boy!! They named him Cervantes Domingo and I can't wait to see him!  And now I'm off to finish the poem that's due tomorrow. And I might watch Average Joe. The girl choosing the guy in this version doesn't seem quite as shallow as the last, and I want to see if I'm right. I think she'll choose a Joe...

        To a Good Home Only...    One lovable, super furry, Himalayan cat. Purrs like an outboard motor and loves to have his chin scratched. Would prefer a home with no other cats or dogs or babies. Free to good, loving, forever home.   We've decided to get rid of Hogan. I am going to call Persian Rescue of North FL this morning and see what can be done. We'll miss him terribly, but I feel like this is the best decision for all involved. Last time I almost got rid of him I was angry and frustrated. This time the decision has not been made for emotional reasons, but for practical ones. Charlie and I have too many pets and too much going on in our lives to properly deal with the neuroses of a pure-bred cat. Hopefully some kind little old lady will adopt him and feed him Fancy Feast and brush his hair every day and keep his litter box sparkling clean and fresh.

        In Honor of Valentine's Day...    I would be remiss if I didn't tell everyone why I love Charlie! So here's my list:  I love Charlie because...  He laughs like he means it He makes me laugh He makes Jack laugh He's generous He's kind He always tells me the truth and hides nothing He's the best Daddy He loves his family He loves my family I respect him He always kisses me goodnight When he smiles I can't help but smile too He wears plaid Converse high tops He's liberal and open-minded He loves my poetry and artwork and always encourages me to be who I want to be He never misses an opportunity to tell me I'm beautiful He brings me flowers He will go to the grocery store after nine pm if I  really  want cookies He sometimes lets me win at wrestling He never hesitates to share parenting responsibilities even if it means missing sleep He lets me sleep in on weekends  He watches the baby so I can go to class He gives me the most thoughtful gifts He hates Bush, too He would kick a deserving ass if I asked him to Someday he's going to build a house with a window seat and a wrap-around porch just for me He loves my cats and my dog (even though he's constantly offering to skin them) He helps me find my keys He pinches my bum when I'm making dinner He's intelligent and he works hard He's supportive He folds laundry and does dishes He's proud of me He never picks an unfair fight He cleaned the cat boxes the whole time I was pregnant He spent every night at the hospital with me after Jack was born, even though he had to drive all over to make sure the animals were taken care of He's not afraid to cry He's witty He could always burp Jack better than me He grills the best salmon and chicken and hotdogs ... He thinks of recipes more as a "place to start" than directions that should be followed He bought me the best photo printer He trusts me when I use the "mother's intuition" card He's my most honest writing critic He'll argue with me over diction and word definitions and grammar He always knows what's going on in the world He's ambitious The first time he kissed me he was shy and had to sneak one in He let me pick Jack's middle name--Aengus Someday we're going to travel all over the world He's so happy when I give him presents He has curly, red hair He has blue-green eyes that are never exactly the same He has the neatest tattoo on his ankle He was with me when I got my tattoo He was the first person I saw after I woke up from my c-section He's the best kisser He always forgets to pick up his dirty socks and lets me tease him mercilessly about it He has a necklace that he wears so often he looks naked without--and I love the necklace because it makes him look like a hippie He always rubs my feet and my back When I was in labor he went to the store for fresh pineapple because he knows how much I love it He has a cute nose He lets me sleep in the corner of the bed by the wall so I can make my pillow nest He once patched the hole in the crotch of his jeans on the outside He wears funny t-shirts He'll go see a cheesy love story with me even though he doesn't like them ...  Okay, I'll stop. I could go on, but I may have lost a good portion of my audience. I was in love with Charlie about ten minutes after I met him and that will never change. Marrying him was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I have never met another man so sensual, so intelligent, so witty, and so kind. And to think that someone up there thought enough of me to make him my partner--

      Happy Valentine's Day! Charlie gave me daisies--purple ones. :)  Today Charlie and Jack and Marc and Allison and Melissa and Ryan and ME(!) are going to the Hoggetown Faire. Beer and wenches in corsets here we come!! And jousting and giant turkey legs and elephant rides and fairy wings ... I love the medieval fair!! Since I came to Gainesville, I measure my year by the faire and the Friends of the Library Book Sale. The book sale is the best--twice a year they open a warehouse stacked with old books and you can buy them CHEAP. I once bought 30 books for $25.   In other news... Jack-monster took his first voluntary steps last night. He's remarkably sturdy for a ten-and-a-half month old. When he was finished, he clapped. I can't believe that he's going to turn one in April. When you have a baby, people will tell you to cherish babyhood because it disappears quickly. It's such a cliche, but it's so true! How can this confident, good-natured little boy be the same child as the curled-up pink and hungry newborn I held in the crook of my elbow?  My boys are sleeping now and I am enjoying a rare moment to myself. Today I refuse to do homework--it's a holiday, after all. The house needs to be cleaned, and I am debating whether I need to find a new home for my Himalayan cat, Hogan. You see, he pees on carpet. It's a nasty habit and it's about to drive me crazy. Because of Hogan, I can't have a mat in the bathroom, in the kitchen, or by the front door. We have to have two catboxes and he only uses them if they're clean enough to suit him. Charlie and I think he's do better as an only pet--at our house he's one of four, not including the baby. I hate walking into the house and smelling cat pee. It's one of the absolute worst smelling things in the world. The trouble is that I am deeply attached to this cat. He finds me when I'm on the couch or in bed and lays next to me and purrs and purrs. He's declawed and doesn't destroy furniture. If he didn't pee everywhere he'd be a perfect pet. Should I feel guilty that I no longer have the time or the energy to deal with this? I think if I could be sure he was going to a good home I'd be okay.

      Happy Friday the 13th!!  Charlie is putting Jack-monster to sleep. We just had a wonderful dinner with friends, and since I had a nap today I am still alert enough to have some Time to Myself.  Life is good.  I'm not feeling especially verbose this evening. Just happy. :)

      Where is my friend Erica? I miss my friend Erica! I fear she has been eaten by bears! Erica, I told you not to go tasting bowls of porridge in strange cabins  .   Bears. They cannot be trained. They whiz whenever they want to.  Here is a poem about her:  Erica is really fun, she once bought me  a sticky bun. She likes dogs cause they have  four legs-- but she doesn't like spiders cause they have eight. (Which we all know violates the number of legs legally allowed to cross her threshold after the committee voted to pass Erica Ordinance 1392.6 1/2)

        On the advice of my advisor...    Charlie, who is sometimes able to think more clearly than me in Matters of Personal Conduct , has suggested that I ignore the troll. After all, the troll only wants to get a Rise Out of Me. So from now on, I will return to my earlier post-breakup stance of Refusing To Acknowledge That Ahmed Exists--no matter how low and immature he makes himself to get my attention. You can all imagine him sitting somewhere in Georgia, in the company of his Women of Ill Repute, trying desperately to figure out why our relationship ended and wishing that I would throw him a scrap of notice.  I will not be drawn into this fourth-grade game of "he said, she said." The relationship we had will be filed in the drawer marked "Life Lessons That Made Me the Person I Am Today (Though It Would Have Been Nicer To Get Here Without Them)."

        Obsess Much?    And now, for your reading pleasure--a troll! Yes folks, he's apparently been lurking here for a while.   "But who is he?" you ask. Don't worry, I'll fill you all in. But please, read this comment from my fiz..box:   Name - Almond JOY  I've been reading your blog for over two months now. Between your slander of me and your lame poetry I realize that NOT MUCH has changed in three years for you while much has changed for me.  You are still living the podunk life, lazy, and always quick to blame others for your own failures or unrealized goals. Now I know why we broke up. You are down right lazy and use people to justify your imaginary existence. I doubt your brain is much larger than that of the gerbil. Look Marcy, a nut!    Almond Joy--clever code name? Nope, guess again. It's Ahmed, my wanker of an ex. I will now refute his commentary.   "I've been reading your blog for over two months now."  Well, thank you. It's been a pleasure writing it, and I do hope you enjoy and find something interesting here as often as I can post.   "Between your slander of me and your lame poetry I realize that NOT MUCH has changed in three years for you while much has changed for me."  Oh, but much *has* changed. For starters, I dumped your sorry ass. I don't own that pitiful bit of a ring that you gave me any longer, either. I had a baby. I married a man who really loves me. I made some new friends. I made a fairy costume. I'm graduating in May. I got accepted to one of UF's top poetry workshops. I have become an aunt to four wonderful babies. I've located my inner bitch. I bought a new car. I worked on a horse farm and found it sadly lacking in intellectual stimulation. I found an alcoholic drink I like. I painted a mural. I could go on, but I don't want to bore you with the details.  So what's changed for you? Do you get your porn online now? Did the Army finally make you an officer? If they did, let me be the first to offer you congratulations. The Army has need of good men like you, fine upstanding men who know how to pull information out of their asses and lead by example. Are you getting your Ph.D.? I hope you found a program that will give you one of those for doing only as much as you need to get by. Are you writing a dissertation? Because I would be more than happy to edit it for you--as I recall you couldn't write a grammatically correct sentence. Do you have a girlfriend? Someone who will let you browbeat her? Does she know how obsessed you are with me? Because it seems you spend an awful lot of your time trying to figure out what I'm doing and who I'm with.    You are still living the podunk life, lazy, and always quick to blame others for your own failures or unrealized goals.  As I recall, I didn't blame you for anything except your addiction to porn and your penchant for picking fights when under the influence. In fact, I should prostrate myself before you, kiss your shoes, and thank you for being such an emotional fuckwit. Thank you, Ahmed, from the very bottom of my heart. If you weren't such an immature ass, I would be married to you now and miserable.  And what do you mean by the "podunk" life? I haven't been able to afford my farm yet, what with being in school and all, but I'm working on it. I also haven't failed at anything yet that I am aware of. I'm a successful mother, student, and wife. I have friends and family who love and support me. Hell, even my dog is perfect. I am realizing my goals every day, little by little. I work hard to be a good parent, a helpful and supportive partner and a good student. My grades have never been better. Of course, they were always better than yours. Does that make you jealous? I'll dedicate my first book to you, and think of you as I live comfortably off of the royalties.    Now I know why we broke up.  Thank GOD. I was wondering when you'd figure it out. There's just one little detail you're missing.   We   didn't break up. I had to confront you and drag it out of you, the fact that you didn't want to marry me. Too bad you weren't man enough to be honest. You took me to Friday's and tried to apologize, and coaxed me into your bed one last time. It didn't work. Ever since that day you've been bothering me. I don't remember ever contacting you except to ask you to leave me the hell alone.  But now comes my truly favorite part of his commentary.   You are down right lazy and use people to justify your imaginary existence. I doubt your brain is much larger than that of the gerbil. Look Marcy, a nut!   Ah, my imaginary existence. Well, all I have to say is, if this life that I'm living now is imaginary, I'll take it. It sure as hell beats living on some no-name military base in Georgia with a man who despises me. That gerbil comment really cuts deep. Man, maybe I should move up north and get job as a Rodent Meteorologist.   Anyway, I hope the troll is happy. I've devoted an entire post to him, which should satisfy his narcissistic desires to be the center of attention. Of course, I can't help him be right about any of these things, but I can give him a forum. That's what blogging in a democratic society is all about. Right?

        Jesus is coming--look busy!    Ah, the farce that is campus preaching.  Today the sign said, "REPENT OR ELSE." Or else what? No dessert? No TV for a week? Or worse, a spanking?  (yes, you must spank us all, and then ...)      You said boob.     So Justin Timberlake ripped off Janet's B-cup. A five-year-old boy watching the SuperBowl with his father might have seen a nipple. A ten-year-old girl might have figured out what's supposed to fill out her training bra. OH MY GOD.   What ever happened to important news? Oh wait, rodents still predict the weather up North--and don't even get me started about the South.   Right. You know, this attitude towards breasts and sexuality is the very same that made people give me dirty looks for daring to breastfeed in public.  But a boy has to eat, and everyone has to see their first boob sometime!

        "I'm glad I live in this luxurious burrow on the Knob and not in a dirty, smelly spider hole like a slob. When I come out I don't want to negotiate, But to just do my job and prognosticate. Today because my shadow I see, six more weeks of winter there will be!"     Happy Groundhog Day!   Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter. It must suck to live in New England, where a rodent has to tell them whether or not it will still be snowing in March. And how can they tell if he  really  sees his shadow? Because if you've ever owned a hamster or a gerbil or a guinea pig or [insert name of ridiculous rodent pet here], you know that their brains (regardless of the size of the rodent) are roughly the size of a pea. His train of thought must go something like this:                                               La la la la .... ooo, a nut! La la la la ...

        StellarPurpleDaisy gets political    Since I posted about the change in FL policy concerning VBACs, I've done some research. More information is available  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  I don't know who to write letters to, but I think the local hospitals would be a good place to start--and maybe a few letters to the editor? As far as I know, women can still attempt a VBAC at main Shands and at North Florida. AGH will not allow it, and I am unsure of birth center policies. But I'm going to find out. Caesarians are becoming a nationwide epidemic.   Let's agitate for change--after all, no one can bitch like a woman who isn't getting her way.

        We want you to eat, just not here...    That's right, move along. No sustenance in the CIRCA Lab, folks. Instead, there's a large-ish poster with pictures of what appear to be rabid 50's children drooling over plates of Manwich on White Bread. The little girl in the top left corner is the worst. She's wearing pigtails--the kind that curl into perfect ringlets and are topped by red gingham bows--and a pinafore and she's grinning madly, a sadistic gleam in her eyes as she watches the Manwich being spread across the Wonder Bread.   Can you spread Manwich?  Today is a long Tuesday. I hate long Tuesdays because it means staying after class for an hour and a half to meet with Dr. Losano. There will be  three of us at the meeting and we will sit in chairs in front of Dr. Losano while he lectures us on the finer points of editing. "People are not going to take your word for it. I can walk in and tell them that something in a document needs to be changed and they'll believe me, because I'm a graybeard and I have a Ph.D. This will not happen for you." There's no encouragement like Dr. Losano's.  I left my Witchcraft* class early today. I was sitting there, copying notes while trying to keep my eyes open, when it hit me--what am I still doing here? Dr. Turner puts the notes up on the class website, so why am I WASTING PRECIOUS TIME IN THIS MANNER? So I left. Just grabbed my stuff and walked out in the middle of the lecture. Yes, that's rude, but incredibly liberating. Dr. Turner's lectures are only slightly less interesting than watching the NASA broadcasts of the astronauts on a spacewalk. It all happens in slow motion because there's no gravity ... moooooving left arm .... moooving right arm ..... left leg.... right leg ....don't ... let ... go ... of ... the ... ship...  Senior-itis has set in. And now I'm off to find something in a vending machine to snack on while I read  Technical Editing ... just as boring as it sounds ...  *No, I am not learning to be a witch. The proper title is Witchcraft in Ancient Cultures, which is decidely less interesting than learning to be a witch. If only I could attend Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!

        Jack Aengus    I. Zero  Nurses hovered like bees. I was on my side, wrist splinted with an IV.   “Charlie?” He touched my hair, as if he hadn’t been crying.   “Jack is perfect.”  “Jack.” I repeated his name, tasting each letter.  And there he was—a swaddled bundle, eyes barely open under lights too bright after the darkness of the womb.   I touched his face, tracing a scratch left by the surgeon’s scalpel.  A miniature pink hand emerged from under the blanket. I unwrapped his damp, curled body just out of its cocoon.  His mouth opened, a red, expectant flower.   I listened to each small guttural swallow— could I satisfy such desperate hunger? As I watched, the rise and fall of his chest became a tide,  synchronous with my worry and wonder.  II. Ten Months  Jack tests each pea for firmness and weight,  hoarding the best as ammunition.  He launches them individually, an aimless, cheerful cannoneer. Another one whizzes by my head and he grins, revealing new, white, uneven teeth.  The dogs are at his feet, slavering,  measuring the arc of each tiny bit  of vermillion artillery, anticipating landfall  with the breathless precision of starving wolves.  I brandish a spoon shaped like an airplane  and try to find cover under the dining room table.

        This one's for you Mom...    Remember when you were a child and your mother (young, beautiful, perpetually thin)  always  knew what you were up to? What you were plotting and when you were lying? My Mom never missed anything.  Now that I have a child, I know how she did it, and it's simple really--no kid is the evil supergenius and/or crime boss that they would like to believe they are.  Take Jack, for example. When we go to the playground, he likes to eat the reconstituted tire bits that the city uses as mulch. If I catch him (and I always do), I tell him no and take the tire bits away.   Jack is a smart boy, familiar with no--so the next time he goes to eat some tires, he turns his back on me and tries to look sneaky. First of all, he's under three feet tall, so from my towering height of 5'4", I can clearly see what he's about to do, even with his back turned. Second, what else would he be doing with a fistful of black rubber?  I told you it was simple.

        I knew today was going to be interesting when I saw that bug in my cereal...    A weevil, and a very antisocial one at that. There he was, little legs curled under his lifeless body, floating in the 'O' of one of my Cheerios. I felt kind of sorry for him--until I realized that he was probably some kind of weevil scout, sent to scope out the choicest box of dry goods in which to build a Weevil Metropolis. Six-legged, starch-eating little bastard.   But don't let the weevil fool you. Today was a pretty good day. For once I understood the ridiculous calculations in astronomy lab and successfully converted kilometers per second per parsecs to Megaparsecs and then years. Based on my calculations, the approximate age of the universe is 1.238x10^10 years. I spent thirty minutes squinting my eyes and asking ridiculous questions while simultaneously ignoring my apathetic lab partners to accomplish the amazing feat. Then the "partners" copied my calculations because they're lazy and (as I mentioned) apathetic.   I was slightly angry until I imagined them at home writing their lab reports with absolutely no memory of how the hell they arrived at years from kilometers per second per parsecs. Ha. Their lab reports will be sad, sorry little things--but mine will be stellar. It will have color pictures and neatly arranged calculations and will be printed on a laser printer. I'll get another 101 and they will be jealous.  They will say, "How  does    she do it?" And they truly will not know the answer.

        I can win this one...    My son is upstairs in his crib, banging a toy against the bars. I am ignoring him--after all, he's supposed to be napping. He was tired,  I swear . I know this, I watched his eyes flutter closed while he drank milk from a bottle. We were in the rocking chair, the naptime music was playing quietly, all was peace and calm. So  why  isn't he sleeping?   I should thank my lucky stars that he's not crying, scrunching his face up and sucking in great gasps of air for bigger screams. I should be happy for the fifteen minutes I've got to myself here. But I can't understand this new phase. It is a mystery that must be solved!  The boy used to be a champion sleeper--if prizes were handed out for such things, Jack would have won Baby of the Universe for his swift and regular trips into DreamLand. He would look at me and I would know that the dark circles under his eyes and his quickly degenerating mood meant he needed sleep. So I'd make a bottle, grab a blankie, and we'd sit in the rocking chair, me admiring his long eyelashes, him slowly and easily slipping into a deep, milk-induced coma, blankie tucked under his chin.  I miss those days.   Now, naptime and bedtime are accompanied by much crying and gnashing of teeth. I cajole, wheedle, coo, and attempt to soothe while Jack rolls frantically in his crib, grabbing at the bars, the blankets, anything to save him from the Pit of Despair where we make him sleep. After ten minutes of this I give up and walk out of the room and Jack proceeds to scream as if a hungry wolf is gnawing off his limbs. I resolve to let him cry--because after all, he's been changed, fed, read to, patted, kissed, and reassured that his parents do in fact still love him and have not abandoned him in the dark, bat-ridden cave of his bedroom for their Own Sadistic Pleasure (or worse, to do Fun Things without him).  Fifteen minutes later he is still crying, at which point I enter the room again. My intent is to offer Jack some more milk because lusty, sustained screaming can really take it out of a kid. Besides, appeasing with milk is a tried and true method that has not failed me since he was born. But sadly, I have underestimated the boy and his Iron Will--not only does he reject the bottle, he rejects me, and I am not allowed to rock him to sleep because he's making a point. As a baby on the verge of toddlerhood, it would be against Jack's principles to give in and let Mommy soothe him, even though he's exhausted and near hysterical.  So I lay him down in the crib again and the crying reaches a new level--my mom calls it Level 5. Level 5 crying is the kind of crying that can only be described as hysterical, frantic shrieking followed by gasping and sniffling as more air is garnered for a new effort. It sounds like this: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, uh, uh, uh, uh, gasp, uh, uh, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  I know at this point that I'm winning, he's going to crack soon. I turn the light on in the hallway and peek into Jack's room through the crack of the door and its frame. He's no longer shrieking and his gasping and sniffling are increasingly without conviction. He has the look of a child who's given up, whose mother has outwaited him again, and who has resigned himself to sleeping all alone in the Pit of Despair while bats come and go.  Two minutes later, the room is eerily, suddenly quiet. The boy is sleeping. Tomorrow he will wake up with the sun in his hair and smile at me when I lift him out of his crib. The night's wrestling match will be forgotten and I will be Beloved Mommy once again.  The things we do for love.

        Writer's block is an evil beast...    It's what makes me look at my blank screen and feel braindead. My mother visits this site and has been suggesting that I write more--and I want to, but...  Jack is on a nap strike that is slowly be turning into a general, blanket sort of sleep strike. He was up this morning at 2:30, hungry and wanting to be rocked indefinitely. When I finally got tired of his head sweat dripping into the crook of my elbow, I put him back in his crib and resolved to ignore the screaming. It lasted another thirty minutes--not at full pitch, mind you, just an unconvinced, noncommittal sort of whining, loud enough to keep me awake wondering what kind of psychotherapy he's going to need in middle age.  School is finished in just over a month--two research papers and a final exam are all that stand between me and my mortarboard. Not to mention some minor lab reports and quizzes...   I've spent the last two days looking everywhere for affordable summer clothing in my size, and I do mean everywhere. I've been to Ross, TJMaxx, GoodWill (just in case), Target, Old Navy, and several places in the mall. Why can't I find clothes that fit?!  If you know me, you know I'm not large, though I do tend towards the busty side. This makes buying shirts extraordinarily difficult, especially since the current style of t-shirts is intended to be a "tiny fit." Is it too much to ask that a shirt be slightly fitted and flattering without hugging every post-baby bulge? I've lost almost all of the thirty-seven pounds I gained during my pregnancy, and yet nothing fits like it used to.   The problem is compunded by the fact that my choices are to either dress as if I'm seventeen, or as if I'm fifty-six. What happened to nice clothes for tweny-something mothers? Why does it feel as if I'm stranded in a sea of micro-minis and elastic-waisted capris? A sea of teeny-tiny tees and wrap shirts for small chests?   A regular large t-shirt is just barely too small, and an extra-large leaves me swimming in swathes of extra fabric. And where are all those women that are six feet tall? The ones responsible for the fashion industry's insistence on making women's jeans just two inches longer than is actually useful? And dresses! Don't even get me started on dresses...  Does anyone else have this problem? A normal shape and weight that seem to have been deemed abnormal and overlarge by unnaturally thin and tan fashionistas with impeccable french manicures? Anyone?

      My new poem ...    Honeymoon    When the sun rose that morning,  your grandmother’s diamonds glittered on my left hand. Under the sheets we were a heap of bare, tangled, sticky, delirious limbs.  Your red curls caught the light  and burned summer bright on our shared pillow. You counted my freckles while we listened to a feeble oak  scrape its arthritic branches on the roof.   Do you remember that house? The bedroom just big enough for the bed  and that place in the wood floor  someone had patched with cement?  The porch was wholly given to the vines and lizards  creeping in from the yard and the kitchen sink was older than our parents.  For six hundred dollars a month we had no heat  and a yard full of roguish magnolia seedlings. Every Saturday you made war on those magnolias, entering the fray with a secondhand mower  and a green bandana over your curls. You’d come in afterwards, dripping sweat  on your grandmother’s oriental rug, and ask for a drink of water.  That afternoon, I dressed in your old overalls,  thankful for their loose comfort over my morning-sick stomach. We drove on A1A with the windows down  and Ben Folds bawling a ballad on the radio.  It was pain, sunny days, and rain—I knew you’d feel the same.  The overzealous sun scorched your Irish skin and I closed my eyes.  Do you remember my body?  My porcelain stomach and comely breasts?  Before I was tired, queasy, shattered,  before the baby began in my untested womb  and before you could trace the outline of new life — I was nubile, vestal, bewitching.  You kissed me at red lights, stop signs,  and in the frozen foods section  when we were picking out ice cream. Before we chose the baby’s name— Jack, for your friend, and Aengus,  for the Celtic god of laughter, love, and wisdom— my hands traveled the length of you each night, lingering where your collarbone meets its other half.  At dusk we had dinner at the Conch House. We ate outside, where impudent gulls flew as close as they dared to our crab legs and scallops. The waitress took our picture  and then we walked on the beach,  our pants rolled up to our knees,  shoes dangling from our hands  and the drowsy sun setting your curls ablaze.   Remember how we pretended to be rich?  We walked the Ghost Tour with the Old Dead Sheriff— I wished for a camera to capture  the lingering, unsatisfied spirits— then we bought the biggest  chocolate-covered strawberries we could find.  I filled the heart-shaped tub in the honeymoon suite  with bubbles to the ceiling  and we toasted ourselves right there in the water, the clink of our glasses echoing off the stark hotel tile. Afterwards, we lay on the bed, your hand resting on my stomach where it was starting to stretch, talking of a child with dazzling red curls.

        The Rules    A gorgeous day--Jack and I went to the park and took off our shoes. I showed Jack how to pick the small, white clover flowers and then we walked over to the volleyball pit to play in the sand. He dug a hole, stopping often to let the sand run through his fingers. I pushed him on the swing and then spent a few minutes trying to explain why we don't eat the bits of rubber tire that constitute the playground "mulch."  Eventually I gave up in favor of removing him from the problem area.   It's wise to choose your battles with an almost-one-year-old. Electrical outlets, biting, and playing "is your head on tight?" with the cat are off limits. Whether or not to eat your peas or which foot your sandal goes on are negotiable. Turning the TV off and on for twenty minutes, banging your blocks together like cymbals, and sorting the freshly-folded laundry in the spirit of exploration are all okay. Feeding your dinner to the dogs on the sly and hitting are not.  Of course,  these are the black-and-white areas where even the youngest children and the newest parents need not be confused. I can tell Jack not to hit me and know that I have done nothing wrong by uttering that often overused syllable-- no . "No, Jack. Don't hit mommy." "NO. Don't touch that electrical outlet!" No, no, no. Two letters, no arguing.   No  is the mantra of mothers everywhere, a kind of chant we speak in the hope that the child will understand and internalize our good intentions. The only problem with  no  is that it's easy for it to lose all meaning. At our house, we're trying to keep it sacred, so we always say it like we mean it.   Last night, Jack reached out his hand to unplug the christmas lights on the porch. Charlie and I--in unison--firmly said, "no." Jack started to cry. But he didn't touch the lights.

      Okay, I think it's safe to say that I know nothing about HTML coding. I'm winging it here, which is why I can't figure out how to change the header font or move the links and archives back to their old home at the top of the page.     here's another poem to distract you all from my foibles ...   Horse, It’s You I Love!   Not you, roughshod donkey, moth-eaten drudge of the bony withers, hauling always the burdens of others,  not you, droopy-eared mule, plow-puller that furrowed the South, carrying cotton in reed baskets,    not you, ungovernable zebra with your blatant camouflage,  braying strangely on African savannahs— but  you, Horse, it’s you I love! For you, I have worked thankless hours in ramshackle stables,  just to breathe your earthy perfume! For you, I borrowed every equine volume in the library, hoping for enough book-learning to make me an Olympian! To you, Arab, Banat er Rih, child of the wind, little horse of the desert    from which all other breeds are sprung, To you, Thoroughbred, be you sprinter or marathoner, you’re all heart and  bottom, driving down the homestretch even if a leg is broken, To you, Shetland pony, crofters’ packhorse, sovereign of the scattald, wee, shaggy coal miner, To you, Lippizaner, spotless white-coated Austrian, performing your piaffes,  ballotades, and courbettes, To you, Mustang, Spanish ex-patriot, the embarrassment of Captain Cortez, first horse in the New World,   To you, Shire, brawny Brit of the lucky shoes, warhorse of the Middle  Ages, bigger even than the Clydesdale,   To you, Friesian, ink-black descendent of Equus robustus  and the knight’s fearless destrier, To you, Quarter Horse, faster at a quarter mile than even the Thoroughbred,  forever chasing outlaws and savages, To you, Appaloosa, spotted mount of the Nez Percé Indians, and you, American  Saddlebred, lean, leggy mount of Kentucky plantation owners, To you Selle Français, Brabant, Gypsy Vanner, Swedish Warmblood, Percheron, Welsh pony, Dartmoor, Akhal Teké, Highland,  Fjord , and Icelandic, To you Traveller, Comanche, Buttermilk, Trigger, Seabiscuit, Little Sorrel,  Man O’ War, Exterminator, Phar Lap, Hidalgo, Bucephalus,  Marengo, Justin Morgan, and Citation,  Long may your coats—buckskin, chestnut, gray, roan, or piebald— gleam like burnished metal, Long may your eager whinnies greet schoolgirls with pockets full of carrots, Long may you adorn green pastures, drowsing under shade trees,  and long, my love, may you gallop without hindrance  through my dreams awake and sleeping!   I agree, it needs work.

        The Pregnancy Bible    During my pregnancy, when my joints ached and my stretch marks seemed to be lengthening with each breath, I would open my copy of  What to Expect When You’re Expecting  in a desperate search for wisdom, reassurance, and sanity. The book was a gift from my mother in the sixth week of my pregnancy. She bought it for me the day I told her I was pregnant. It was nearly two inches thick and filled with black-and-white line drawings of the pregnant body. The cover promised a “clear, comprehensive month-by-month format” that would “reassuringly answer the concerns of mothers- and fathers-to-be.” My mother promised me that it was  the pregnancy bible . “You’ll find it very helpful. I read obsessively while I was pregnant with you—and this book was written by real mommies, not male obstetricians.”    I had my doubts. Pregnancy had come as a complete surprise to me and while it wasn’t unwelcome, it certainly wasn’t planned. The two solid blue lines on the pregnancy test left me feeling slightly ashamed of myself, as if I’d made change in the offering plate at church so I’d still have five bucks for gas. It wasn’t illegal—just  wrong . Besides, the woman on the cover looked ill. She was sitting in a rocking chair next to a basket of pale pink and blue flowers with one arm resting on her taut, rounded belly. The other arm was propped on the chair holding an open book. The half smile on her face was enigmatic (was it heartburn? gas? the baby kicking? nervousness? fear?) and made me uneasy. Was that book a gift from  her  mother?  I decided to continue on to the table of contents. As promised, they were clear and comprehensive. Following the introduction and foreword were five major sections divided into chapters and minor subject headings. I opened to the foreword and started to read. It was written by Dr. Richard Aubry, a professor and obstetrician whose enthusiasm for the book was matched only by his excessive praise. “I wouldn’t have thought it possible. The best just got better…with this brand-new third edition, I’ve marveled once again.”   Encouraged, I moved on to the introduction, which was written by one of the authors. Her name was Heidi Murkoff and she was a mommy—a real living, breathing female subject to the same fears and worries as me. Right away she allayed my fears concerning the cover woman. “[O]ur cover woman has been refreshed; after seventeen years of enduring a 1980s perm and a potato sack of a dress, she has enjoyed a sleek hair-to—cute shoe makeover.  And  she gets to wear pants.” Clearly this book was for the modern expectant woman, the intelligent, urban-chic mommy-to-be. The cover woman wasn’t afraid—she was smug.  After reading Ms. Murkoff’s reassurances, I felt confident enough to begin investigating the chapters.  Chapter 1: Are You Pregnant?  Since two at-home pregnancy tests, a midwife, and a doctor had already confirmed that I was, I skipped to  Chapter Two: Now That You’re Pregnant .  Under the chapter heading were sections titled  What You May Be Concerned About  and  What It’s Important to Know . These sections were themselves separated into even smaller and more specific sections. I had my choice of  Your Gynecological History, Your Obstetrical History Repeating Itself, Immunizations in Pregnancy, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Having a Big Family, The Father’s Age, Incompetent Cervix, An IUD Still in Place, Religious Objections to Medical Care, Living at High Altitude, First-Trimester Screening, Ultrasound, Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) , and  Other Types of Prenatal Diagnosis .   I chose  Your Obstetrical History Repeating Itself .  Page twenty-three, third paragraph—a question was typed in bold italics:   “With my first child, I had a very uneventful pregnancy. That’s why the forty-two-hour labor with five hours of pushing came as a shock. Is that what I’m in for again?”   Forty-two hour labor with five hours of pushing? I read the question again. Forty-two hour labor with five hours of pushing. Right.   That’s when the fear set in—the fear that would define my relationship with the so-called pregnancy bible forever after. I was terrified and fascinated by  What to Expect When You’re Expecting . The format for the rest of the book was the authors addressing the fears and concerns of pregnant women. The woman’s question or statement was always printed in bold italic type and followed by a few paragraphs containing the answer. Each page revealed some pregnancy statistic, risk or danger more ghastly than the last.     “Since I became pregnant I’ve got awful-looking spidery purplish-red lines on my thighs. Are they varicose veins?”   “I know they say that once you pass the third month, you don’t have to worry about miscarriage. But I know someone who lost her baby in the fifth month.”  “I’m afraid I’m going to get stretch marks. Can they be prevented?”  “I’ve gained so much weight that I’m afraid the baby will be very big and difficult to deliver.”   “My milk finally came in, leaving my breasts three times their normal size—and so hard and painful that I can’t bear to put on a bra. Is this what I have to look forward to when I wean the baby?”  “I seem to be leaking milk from my breasts all the time. Is this normal? Is it going to last?”  “I knew I wouldn’t be ready for a bikini right after delivery, but I still look six months pregnant a week later.”  “My baby is over a month old, and I can’t stop feeling depressed. Shouldn’t I be feeling better by now?”   “My hair seems to be falling out suddenly. Am I going bald?”    There I was, sitting on my couch, newly pregnant and afraid. I was only twenty-three and it seemed I would be condemned to a future of permanent varicose veins, hideous stretch marks, extra cellulite, sore nipples, and sagging, leaking breasts—if I miraculously managed to stay pregnant. If and when the baby was safely delivered and we made it home things got even less glamorous. There would be no sleep, a colicky, inconsolable child, postpartum depression, and absolutely no sex drive to speak of. My hair would start to fall out and I would retain water for weeks.   But these fears were nothing compared to the panic that labor caused me. Would it hurt? Could I do it without medication? What if there was an emergency? What were my chances of death? What were the baby’s chances of death? I didn’t know. The only thing I did know was that it was going to be bloody.   I was not alone.  What to Expect When You’re Expecting  had devoted an entire one hundred and fifty pages to the subject of labor and delivery. What impressed me about this section was that many women, upon finding that they were in labor, had taken the time to stop their Lamaze breathing and write to the authors.    “I just started getting contractions and they’re coming every three or four minutes. I feel silly calling my practitioner, who said we should spend the first several hours of labor at home.”  “The pain in my back is so bad since my labor began that I don’t see how I’ll be able to make it through delivery.”   “I’m afraid that I won’t get to the hospital in time.”  “The sight of blood makes me feel faint. What if I pass out while I’m watching my delivery?  “I had a forty-eight-hour labor my first time around, and finally delivered after four and a half hours of pushing. Though we both came out of it okay, I dread going through that torture again.”  “I’m concerned about my vagina tearing and stretching. Will I ever be the same again?”  “I’m afraid I’ll do something embarrassing during labor.”  “I’m really worried that my water will break in public.”     I kept reading and didn’t stop until I had just enough information to keep me awake at night. I hadn’t been this petrified since I watched  The Silence of the Lambs  alone in my dorm room as a freshman. I should have put the book away—but I had to see how it ended. Like the movie, the book was open ended. Hannibal Lecter escaped, and  What to Expect When You’re Expecting  left me  Preparing for the Next Baby.  “It would be remiss not to outline a plan for the best of all possible pregnancies—because the possibility does exist for an increasing number of women, as family planning techniques become more reliable, to plan ahead.”  P.S. (March 2004) My son, Jack, is now eleven months old. He was delivered by emergency c-section thirty-six hours after my first contraction and a week after his due date. In the end, I did need drugs to help me deal with the pain. Jack’s umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck twice and there was meconium in the amniotic fluid as well as an infection in the placenta. The pregnancy was normal and uneventful, and Jack is a healthy, active little boy with a ready grin. All I have left of his time in the womb are the stretch marks on my stomach, just under my bellybutton. But even they are starting to fade.   _________________________________________________________________________ P.S.S. This essay is in no way intended as a shot at my mother, whom I love very much. I had to write about an instructional book for a class, and it was funnier to take this approach than it was to simply explain the book. I really did refer to this book a lot during my pregnancy, and it was invaluable resource.

        In the Name of the Lord    A Genoese captain watches the skies over Granada,  his journey written in the stars.   He imagines himself High Admiral of the Ocean Sea,  a small favor in exchange for spices  that will flavor the meat of sovereigns.  The water churns white under the prow.  Steering west, the captain plots  the miles on a painted vellum map.  The sea curves into a bowl  where the great ships float like dead fish.  The sails hang damply from the masts, flapping feebly like wet laundry.  The captain finds himself near an island,  where he soon discovers that the friendship  of the natives can be bought for a trifle— small red caps, strings of beads.  They possess only wooden spears  tipped with sharpened fish bones.   Through ignorance they grasp the Spaniards’  swords by the blades, cutting their hands.

        A brief, imaginary interview with the writer...      What's new this week?  It's spring break, and I can hardly express how much that means to me. I am this close ----> [] to a nervous breakdown due to lack of sleep. Other news: Jack walks more than he crawls. He's learned to turn the TV off and on, as well as control the volume. Oh, and I bought tofu for the first time. Did you know that having tofu is like having a pet? You have to keep it in water--water that you change every day.     But what will you do with all that free time?  Nap. Write a poem at a leisurely pace. Take Jack to the park. Groom the dog. Watch the extended version of The Two Towers (finally). Write in my blog and feel something other than braindead when confronted with a blank page. Finish my trash-novel.  Research for my paper on  A Midsummer Night's Dream . Spend some time with Charlie. Edit some of my poems. Edit my editing homework. Finish changing my blog template and put up my links again.  Go out for my birthday without the baby .   Birthday?  That's right. I'm turning 25 precisely one week from today. I'm getting my ear pierced, in the cartilage near the top. I can do that now because I am almost through with my military contract. I want something with a purple, sparkly stone in it. :) ________________________________________________________________________________________________ I remember when I was a child and I'd look at older people and think, "Man, their lives must be so cool. I'm gonna be cool like that when I'm older, too." So now that I've reached adulthood, I wonder when the cool factor kicks in. When do I get to be the worldly, hippy, beatnick, intellectual person I constructed for my adult self as a child?   There were so many things I wanted to do. I was going to live in New York City and take the subway into Greenwich Village for art festivals and gourmet peanut butter sandwiches. I was going to see every single play on Broadway even if I had to sit in the rafters to afford a seat. I was going to make lots of money as an artist and always be reading some obscure translated novel.   I was going to write inspiring but mysterious poetry and spend most of my time thinking deep thoughts in museums and art galleries. I was headed to Italy to see Michealangelo's Pieta, and to the Louvre to see the winged Nike of Samothrace. I was going to date beautiful men and break their hearts when I chose adventure over marriage.   I was going to be a world-class equestrienne. I was going to be thin and gorgeous, with white teeth and slightly curly auburn hair. I was going to shop in vintage stores and thrift shops for my clothes and play the guitar to songs I wrote. I was going to be creative, kind, charismatic, and popular. I would shop at farmer's markets and wear flowy dresses and see foreign films with subtitles. I was going to be known for my intelligence, and possibly get a Ph.D.  I did not plan for this life that I am leading now. I never expected Jack or Charlie or that it would take me six years to finish college. I never expected that paying your own way generally means that you have very little extra money, or that joining the Army would take me to El Salvador, Japan, and Egypt and teach me about personal limits. How could I have known that chemistry and pre-calculus would be all it took to change my mind about veterinary school? How could I have known that putting on the Army uniform would leave me feeling so dissatisfied and unfulfilled?   But I have grown. A quarter century has taught me to stand up for myself and to never hide who I am. It has taught me that love comes in all shapes and sizes, and that unexpected surprises are often the best ones. I have made new friends and outgrown some old ones. I have learned grammar and writing and that Saturn looks like it's pasted in the sky when you view it through a telescope. I have learned forgiveness and patience and to seize every opportunity.   I have watched a person die and given birth to a child. I've created life and helped nurture it. I've learned to draw and paint and put my wallet in the same place each day. I have learned that nothing is sweeter than kissing Jack's cheek or waking up every morning next to the man I adore. I have learned to keep my own house, to do laundry, to cook, and to live on a budget. I have learned to say "I love you" without underestimating the value of the words. I have learned to tell the truth and laugh more than I cry. I have learned to make my own decisions and stand behind them, even if it means I have to discuss them with my parents.  The point is I love this life. It's not what I was planning, but it's full of small victories and plenty of its own joys.  I look forward to more children, more writing, and more years with my beloved Charlie.    ....and you're all invited to my birthday party :)

      Purple Galoshes  Rain, you’re so easily distracted, such a tease, riding in on a cumulonimbus cloud only to be blown off course by a northwesterly wind. It’s gray outside, but you haven’t yet arrived to water the periwinkles and mums.  Sometimes I wish you would come just so I could wear my black-and-yellow raincoat with the hood pulled over my head like blinders. When you’re here I like to drive with my headlights on, the wipers beating out a rhythm on the glass of the windshield.   You make me wish I had galoshes, purple ones festooned with white painted daisies. I’d wear them into every puddle between my house and the bus stop. I’d wear them into my garden to scatter wildflower seeds and to Sunday Evening Mass—God knows I love purple and Jesus looking so mournful on the cross might appreciate the diversion.    I’d wear them with argyle socks and a pleated skirt, or with jeans over bare feet. If I thought it becoming, I’d wear them to my wedding and kiss the groom under an arbor dripping with yellow roses.   I’d wear them to Cape Hatteras to collect shells in a tin pail and toss starfish back into the tide. I’d wear them to the Louvre—you know I’ve always wanted to see the Nike of Samothrace in all her winged glory. I’d wear them in the Grand Canyon, standing as close to the edge as I dared to admire the way purple galoshes look against red rock and sky.  I’d wear them in Limerick, leaning over the edge of the Blarney Castle battlements to receive the gift of eloquence…  Rain, why do you distract me so?

        The pain in my head...    Today I was driving home from a visit to my parents' house when I saw a sign that said "Support Are Troops." It was one of those digital construction signs that someone has to program. The bad news? That "someone" had programmed not one, but  two  signs.  So, please, "Support Are Troops."  And if you don't know what's wrong with that sentence, I can't help you.

       Domestic Goddess   Her hair is an artless bed-head tangle, wreathed in soap bubbles like roses, that rise off the pot she’s scouring. Her son dangles from her   by one chubby arm. Mommy, can I have juice-cookies-watch another video? All his requests are the same. He always needs something, wants to go somewhere, see something new. It’s exhausting, being his Social Coordinator, making sure he leaves with shoes intact and no milk on his chin. Sometimes, she can’t even align the buttons on her own shirt. She’d give up her husband for a third arm or a maid.

        A rant    To the Teaching Assistants Who Lose Papers, and the Professor Who Laughs Nervously At Her Own Humorless Comments:  (the following announcement is taken directly from the class website)   Announcements:  5/23 The flood of emails regarding grades has been a bit overwhelming.  The grades will be up as soon as possible, probably Friday morning/afternoon. Please restrain your emails for a little while regarding those grades. Everybody will have their grades when all of the grades are put together.    It's okay. TAKE YOUR TIME. You promised we'd know our grades by Tuesday past, but when you showed up with only half the papers graded because "it's intense to read so many [five page] papers at once," you promised the grades would be finished by Thursday. Well, guess what?! THAT WAS YESTERDAY. Hell yes I emailed you! I have only just barely managed not to email you THIRTY SEVEN more times in the last twenty-four hours.   Should I study for the final? Because it was my understanding that a 91 average meant I don't have to. If only I knew my grade ... but you--the "busy" grad students and professor--don't seem able to get it together. But like I said, no big deal. Just because it's Friday at five pm and I STILL DON'T KNOW MY GRADE isn't a problem. I'm just an undergrad. What could I possibly know about organization and finishing things on time? Honestly, I'm looking forward to spending the weekend waiting for you to finish. It's like a game--I keep checking the class website, only my grade is not there, like an elusive baby round of peek-a-boo. Fun!    In fact, the whole class has been an amusing look at total incompetence in action. Not only were my papers frequently lost, but the TAs were often unsure that they were in the right classroom when they arrived. Nervous Laughter would arrive three minutes after class starts and command the TAs to move the notes on the screen up or down. She would frequently ask them to fix something on a saved page--"don't you have one of those light pen thingies?" Like a couple of lackeys they would jump to do her bidding. For this UF will award them each a Masters in Classical Studies.  Thanks a pantload.

       The Importance of English in a Technical Society...   In defense of my chosen field of work (and in answer to some of Lavenderose's deeper and more confusing thoughts), I will now put forth why I believe literature is important. The sections in italics are taken directly from Lavenderose's blog, without which I could not properly formulate my argument.   I was walking on campus today trying to justify why I am a Liberal Arts major at one of the top universities in the country. I felt like an imposter... academians are physicists and chemical engineers, botanists and doctors and dentists and veterinarians, graphic designers and computer programmers, archaeologists and anthropologists and linguists and political scientists. I already know English, and so does everybody else-- so it leaves me feeling rather unsatisfied and doubtful that I have accomplished anything at all ...   English is a language, that's true. And yes, millions of people use it everyday in speaking, writing, and general communication.   But few people do it well. I am an English major because I'm a word snob. I pride myself on my vocabulary and the proper use of punctuation in all of my sentences. I know the difference between  affect  and  effect ,  ensure  and  insure . I can write a paragraph without a single comma splice. Nothing makes me happier than the perfect word, knowing when to use  heliotrope  instead of  purple .   In a society primarily engaged in moving forward technologically, our children are increasingly less literate. I study English because I value literacy and I want to pass it on to my son. I want to prove to the world that effective communication is the glue holding this planet together.   I study English because it's viable. Language is fluid and constantly changing. Knowing the proper use of language is the best weapon with which to fight degeneration. Take, for example, the word  like . If you talk to anyone under the age of thirty, you will notice how  like  has crept into their vernacular. You may also notice how it has made them sound less than intelligent. I have been battling  like  for years, because, like, I want to sound like the educated, intelligent young woman that I am and not some strumpet off the street. (Notice the proper use of the word as compared to the improper use.)  There is nothing better than English, especially not chemical engineering. It's true, few English majors have ever struck it rich--even fewer have been published. But that's not the point. The point is that taking pride in the way you speak and write is nearly as important as taking pride in your appearance.     I just don't know how I'm going to teach literature if I'm not allowed to preach to my students about morality, if I have to be objective. In all honesty, I see my position as a teacher more as a position of a preacher, which is probably a horrible thing to say if I want to work in the secular public school system. Oh well.   You will never have to preach about morality. Just choose literature that will spark discussion. May I suggest Mark Twain? The premier American wit was nothing if he wasn't a preacher. What better way to show the injustices of oppression and prejudice than through  Huckleberry Finn ? And who better to show the absurdity of love and unchecked passion than Shakespeare?   If books are too long, search the poets. Try Wilfred Owen, the war poet who wrote for only thirteen months from the trenches. His truths are quickly becoming our own in this political climate. Or look to "The Waste Land" for a picture of modernity's descent into ruin.   Morality was never taught by preaching. It is a thing learned through example. If you come to your students everyday with an earnest desire to teach them something about the world through reading, they will soak it up like thirsty osmotic cells. Ruthlessly correct their grammar, even when they're speaking. It won't make them like you, but they won't walk out of your classroom dumber than they arrived.  My advice is to look to literature less for a universal truth. Come to it with an open mind and a dictionary and take only the smallest nuggets of truth, the pocket-sized ones that you can carry with you everywhere you go. And don't spend any more time with philosophy majors.

       Graduation here I come...   That's right, I'm less than two weeks away from the Big Day. The day when I can't use the excuse "I'm still working on my bachelor's" as a reason for not having a job that pays more than $7 an hour. The day when I have to apply myself to My Life's Work, not just Exploring the Possibilities. It's been a rocky road, but deep down, we all knew this day would come (yes, even you Dad).   Know what I've decided? Since I love poetry so much and since I think I might be able to talk my profs into letting me into the MFA in Creative Writing Program sometime in the next two years--I'm going to be a writer.   Yes, you read that clearly.   ( dear sir or madam will you read my book? it took me years to write it, please take a look--it's based on a novel by a man named Lear and I need a job so I wanna be a paperback writer... )  My plan is simple. I will write everyday, either poems and in this blog, both if I am feeling particularly inspired. I will keep a reading list of reputable novelists and poets and I will read a book a week. I will look up words I don't know in order to increase my vocabulary. I will practice writing in meter, even though it makes me feel like I'd rather be scraping the mold off the grout in the bathroom with a toddler toothbrush. I will find out where poets get published, and I will send my work to those places.  And in September, I will email my profs and offer to take them to lunch so we can talk some more about grad school. Advice from my parents and the opinions of certain ex-boyfriends not withstanding, I will write about motherhood and marriage and the fact that I can't get the caterpillars to stop eating the leaves of my strawberry plant.  So check back to see how things are going. Watch as I balance motherhood, marriage, and becoming successful! Be there for the falls, the foibles, the victories large and small! Responsible adulthood here I come!

       Choose Your Poison...    ...or should I say, "tool of procrastination"? (yes, I put the question mark outside the quotations on purpose) Was my life more productive before the internet?  Jack is sleeping peacefully and I should be using this time to do something useful. Write my term paper, do some laundry, mop the kitchen floor, alphabetize my CD collection, give Ass Puppy (read Wolfgang) a bath as he's getting rather ripe--anything but sit here on my duff and waste time reading about the fashion dos and don'ts of celebrities at the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards. (That's twenty minutes of my life I will never see again...)   Or doing Google searches in an attempt to determine what kind of caterpillars are devouring my plants and laughing, pointing at me with their antennas. (They're Tussock Moth caterpillars, in case you were wondering, and I dreamed about them last night because I want so badly for them to all shrivel up and die...)   Sigh.  It's not even like my term paper is difficult. It's on adaptations of  A Midsummer Night's Dream  for children, and all I really have to do is watch a few movies and develop a thesis. It only has to be ten to twelve pages long and I can write five pages in three hours. Tomorrow is the last day of class. Graduation is in less than two weeks. Why have I lost all motivation?  Because who cares about a thesis when the birds are singing and the sun is shining and Jack is oh-so-happy to accompany me to the park to play in the sand? It doesn't seem quite fair that the last days of school coincide with some of the most gorgeous weather we've had this year. Or that there are plants to be re-potted, curtains to be sewn, kitchen counters to tile, and brownies to bake!   Check back in two weeks to hear how bored I am with all my free time ...

      Here, for your enjoyment, the PERFECT version of my poem. If you recall, it was previously about a billion lines longer and a lot more sappy.    Honeymoon   Your grandmother’s diamonds weighed on my hand. Under the sheets we were a heap  of bare, sticky, delirious limbs.  Do you remember that house? There was no heat. The porch was given to vines and lizards creeping in from the yard,  a jungle of roguish magnolia seedlings you battled with a secondhand mower. That afternoon, I dressed in your old overalls. We drove with the windows down, Ben Folds bawling on the radio. The sun scorched your Irish skin.  Do you remember my body?  My porcelain stomach and comely breasts? I was nubile, vestal, bewitching— you kissed me at red lights, stop signs,  and in the frozen-foods section at Publix.  At dusk we ate outside. Do you remember our hotel? The bathroom full of mirrors? I could not recognize myself. We lay on the bed, your hand resting on my stomach where it was starting to bloom.

      Okay, first, my apologies for not posting in so long. All five of my devoted readers have been pestering me to post for the last three weeks, but I have been too busy with school and baby and illness to have any thoughts beyond when I can next get some sleep. That being said, school is now almost over and everyone is well again, so here goes...  Tuesday, at my very last poetry workshop, I read a version of my poem "Honeymoon" that was subsequently judged by the class  and  the professor as perfect. There wasn't a single stroke of dissatisfied green or purple pen on it. I can't describe how good that felt, especially after an entire semester of poems getting dissected, line by line, until there was nothing left.   Today I'm watching Issac for Melissa. Amazingly, both boys are down for a nap and there WAS NO CRYING. Damn I'm good.   There's not much else going on. I was sick all night Tuesday, food poisoning or something. I was pretty sure I was going to die on the bathroom floor. In between bouts of throwing up, I imagined Charlie waking up and finding me sprawled comatose on the tile, in my nightgown. What actually happened was I begged him to stay home from work because "I spent the night throwing up and I'm still nauseous and who's going to watch the baby because I have a paper to write and I'm so tired..." So Charlie fed, changed, bathed and entertained Jack while I tried to stay awake long enough to write about crystallomancy for my witchcraft class.   If I get an A on this paper, chances are good that I can skip out on the final--of course, I'd be hard pressed to tell you its contents since I was in a fog while writing it. All I know for sure is that it was six pages long and heavily footnoted and cited. (Thank you, Mrs. Topper for making sure I never make THAT mistake again)  Happily, I was recovered enough by today to enjoy my last Cadbury Cream Egg, an Easter delicacy in high demand at the Hairston household.

      For all you Marcy-starved readers out there, here's a selection of last semester's poetry, since I can barely get my lame ass out of bed these days, let alone to my blog where I am required to think.  Enjoy!     Algiers, 1852   The hot end of an Algerian summer.  It took two days to get here on a ship driven  by the mistral wind -- the only wind Ulysses  failed to capture in his water skins. Ah, Ulysses!  The myth of travel is done;  science has dethroned poetry. Haughtily, but rather sadly, I strive to travel in prose.  I am thirty-five minutes from the heart of Algiers. Natives call it El Bahadja: the White City  of the Arabs, whitest in all the Orient!  Here doors open only halfway,  so that sighing veils may emerge -- Arab women, on their way to the public baths,  that forbidden gynaeceum, where whispers float from windows, the only sound of  captivity  consoling itself, dreaming of misunderstood freedom.  Compare the veiled women to their unruly sisters,  the Jews and Blacks, women with tolerant husbands.  Bare heads on fire and diffused with sunlight,  they walk facing the wind, cheeks ruddy  and dirt clinging to feet in heel-less sandals.  They gather as they please  at the fountains, houses and shops --  elongated, silk-shrouded  forms never faltering under heavy loads,  women of the bread boards and water jugs.  __________________________  Ode to an Elephant   Your skin is gray asphalt.  Cracked and pebbled, it sprouts  scattered hairs as wiry as daisies. Legs like the massive trunks   of redwoods support your ponderous Republican body, ears and trunk swaying disapprovingly.  You look serious and stern,  save for those uncanny eyes,   such unfathomable eyes fringed with black lashes!  The Greeks thought you an oddity, freakish beast  from the cryptic continent of Africa,  the arbitrary offspring of snake and rhino,   and a fearful sort of warhorse too measured for chariots.  The willing, broad backs of your brethren  once scaled peaks for Hannibal. O faithful elephant,   mount of kings and prophets,  declare your might as Kipling did:  our lord the elephant,  Chief of the ways of God . ____________________________  A Military Love Story   Titian highlights accent her hazel eyes, and keep her hair from being wholly black.  It’s been three years since she enlisted.  Now a Navy radioman,  she’s free of the house  of a luckless childhood.  A Navy chief, divorced, and searching-- like Ovid’s translators--for “a creature of a more exalted kind.”  He notices how her hair barely brushes the white collar of the uniform that clings to her hips and thighs.  On a date, she lets him slip his hand into the tight back pocket of her jeans. They drive her Camaro to the beach,  where she touches his graying hair. In three months they are married-- and just beginning to think.  ______________________________  Virgil Remembers   Over the rushing current of Hell’s swollen river, Charon ferried unlucky souls. “Through me you pass into the city of woe, into eternal pain,” he said, rowing quickly,  dipping his oar so that the boat skimmed forward. The hull slid onto black sand. “If you come with me, I will lead you where maps cannot,” Virgil said as he stepped from the boat. He began to chat pleasantly, to ease my fear as we passed into Hell.  “Before I was condemned to limbo, I visited Florida to get a tan under the indignant sun. I floated down the Indian River in a silver canoe to where it meets the sea, pausing at the coast to watch the sandpipers, small, brown, scurrying through the surf, hunting for sand fleas. Gulls circled above the dunes like winged surveyors. If only you had seen those birds, and the serpentine sand!”  More curious than afraid, I followed the poet. “In Florida,” he said, “the great oak trees tower  like Corinthian columns.” Our path led us past heretics burning in their coffins. “Those fires are white hot. If only you had seen the beaches, the sunbathers laid out on glowing towels-- If only Acheron had simply flowed into the sea.” _____________________________________  The Eighth Day   On the eighth day, God created cell phones. Adam tried to call Eve-- but she was watching  the serpent twine around the tree, admiring  the way his shingled scales gripped the bark, how the fruit gleamed like polished rubies.  The serpent taunted her. “Did God  really  say you must not eat from this tree?” Eve’s phone rang like a conscience. “Hello?” “Eve, what are you doing?   Why did you leave me while I was sleeping?” “To explore the garden. Listen, I’ve gotta go.  Call you later.” Eve snapped the phone’s  cover closed and frowned. The serpent laughed and said,  “What does he care? Aren’t you free  to do as you please?” “He’s so  needy !” Eve replied. “I’m tired of warming his food and his bed--he calls me all the time!”  She threw the phone. “I won’t go back!” The serpent fixed his slitted eyes on hers. “I am full of secrets. Come under  the shade of this tree--I will show  you truth in an apple-skin. You will know  more than Adam.” Eve smiled and stepped  under the branches. Her phone rang furiously as she picked an apple. Later, Adam found them there, lying together with juice on their chins. __________________________   Singin’ in the Rain   Nondescript brick buildings line the streets, standing in uniform blocks under the conspicuous white letters of Hollywood. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds tap dance on a backlot  somewhere in the fabricated city of MGM Studios, shim sham shimmying in yellow slickers and heavy black galoshes. They’re soaked and twirling their umbrellas,   smiles becoming grimaces as they wait for the director to perfect his dolly shot and call, “Cut!” Debbie’s coiffure is starting to wilt,  while Gene’s wool suit shrinks under studio rain. The costumer notices a button’s gone-- filming is forced to stop. There’s  a scramble on the soundstage, interns scurrying,  scattering in nervous haste-- the director’s head is in his hands.  The studio rain continues to fall unheeded onto props, cast, and staff, as Gene and Debbie wander to their trailers,  and the sky fades to black.

        The Color of Summer    This summer, I will paint  my toenails shell pink and walk on the beach. In the sand, I will not know  which are my toenails and which are scallops  or coquina.  I will not know  my shell-pink middle toenail from a tiny, vacant clam shell.  This summer, I will sip an electric-green beach drink from a plastic cup  wrapped in a napkin. Brushing the hair out of my eyes, I will stir the tequila  or the rum up from the bottom of the glass with my straw and finish the chartreuse tonic without ever learning its name.

        Peace begins when the hungry are fed...     ...unless the hungry were used to getting a bottle before bed and subsequently refuse to go to sleep when you swap it for a sippy cup even though you fed them a ginormous dinner and gave them a relaxing lavender bath and sang them a song and read them  Oscar's Grouchy Sounds  twelve times and rocked them and rocked them AND ROCKED THEM UNTIL BOTH OF YOUR FEET FELL ASLEEP.   We were down to one bottle a day, the so-called "going to bed" bottle. Sippy cups were (and are) being used at all other times. Since Jack had acclimated with no tears and little protesting to a nap-time sippy cup, I decided it was time to ditch that last bottle. That was yesterday.  Today Jack woke up at five am and refused to be comforted. He cried for nearly two hours. If he could speak in sentences they would have gone something like this: "I WANT MY BOTTLE, WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?!" I've wondered that myself, fervently, repeatedly--what the hell  is  the matter with me? We had it good.  The bottle was a wonderful thing. I'd warm it up and serve it to Jack while I held him and we rocked. He would then lay down with his blanket, quietly, and listen to his music until he fell asleep. He'd sleep all night and so would I. Naps were much the same, guaranteed and simply executed.  What was I thinking?

        The fun never ends at Camp Hairston...    Charlie wrecked his bike the other day out on the trail. He fell in poison ivy (we think), an accident that resulted in a lovely rash of red rosettes up his forearms and down my legs. Nice of him to share.   Our plan? Liberally apply the steroid cream and try not to scratch, which is difficult because the. itching. is. driving. me. insane. Scratching feels so good it's almost orgasmic. I keep dragging my nails over the red patches while looking furtively in all directions to make sure no one notices the crazy girl scratching herself bloody.  I want to scratch until the skin starts to peel away. I have visions of carefully removing the patches of infection with a small scalpel that would leave no scars. I wish pants were optional. I have considered duct taping bags of frozen vegetables to my legs--the cold would numb them and I would blissfully feel nothing. Sure, I'd have to walk with my legs apart as if I'd peed myself, but I think that's a small price to pay.

      Wow. It's been so long since I posted that the posting format at BlogSpot has changed. I apologize for my lack of interest in this blog, and I assure you that there will be much writing in the next few weeks. Right now I'm in Colorado, which is the most beautiful state I've seen so far. I could move here and be happy, I'm sure of it. What's not to love about mountains in the distance and wide open spaces? I'm here with my mom and my sister Jacqui, visiting my other sister Katy, and it's been an extraordinary week of talking, reconnecting, and recharging. Three babies, four women, and a lot of laughter. I'm completely smitten with my nephew Isaac and my niece Emma. Despite all that, I'm ready to go home and sleep in my own bed. More details later because tomorrow we're getting up to catch an early flight.

        The poet of the week is...    Pablo Neruda!  This week I will be enjoying and dissecting poetry from Neruda's book,  The Captain's Verses .  The poetry assignment I have given myself is to write a brief poem about the war so I can submit it to  urlLink this  contest. I'll keep you all posted on how it's going and will submit the final draft here for your review.  In other news...  We joined the YMCA and I am going to get my lazy, post-baby ass in shape! And Jack will be going to the Tiny Tots gymnastics class. :)  Anyway, I'm off to write while the baby still sleeps.

      I confess--I have someone on the side. Or should I say some  thing ? My love for Cinnamon Toast Crunch knows no bounds. I would rather eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch than anything. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, quick snacks, midnight snacks...the wonderfulness of cinnamon-sugary squares slowly getting squishy in milk is almost as wonderful as sleeping until noon or wearing your pajamas to the grocery store.   The summer I spent as a resident counselor at Girl Scout camp in Orlando is memorable because of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Two or three times a week the sleep-away camp pancake and biscuit carb-fest breakfast was replaced with single serving boxes of cereal in all flavors. They were stacked in the center of the table and no one was allowed to touch them until after the grace was said. Of course, instead of waiting, I'd say, "Counselor's rights!" and take the single Cinnamon Toast Crunch before any kids could. Those mornings, I was powerful, I was cool--I was in sugar-coated heaven.   Girl Scout camp fueled my addiction. It was only when I got home and returned to life on my college budget that I realized a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch costs roughly $5. Sadly, I could not afford to eat it any more--until last Tuesday. After all the years of wishing and hoping, Malto Meal (the cereal in a bag!) has finally released a generic version of Cinnamon Toast Crunch called Cinnamon Squares (or something equally unimaginative).   I have returned to my sugar-coated heaven.

      Nothing to say. Today I spent two whole hours by myself, reading, in a bookstore. I got a cookie and felt decadent. Then I came home to Jack and Charlie, both were glad to see me. I cleaned my desk, did some laundry, fed Jack dinner, and walked the dogs. I hung up new pictures of Isaac and Emma. I made a list of things I need at the store next time I go.  It's funny, but things have settled quite a bit since graduation. I spend most of my time with Jack and that's okay. I enjoy it. My days have taken on a pleasant kind of rhythm. We get up and have breakfast, say goodbye to Charlie. Then we shower and get dressed and go have an adventure until naptime. After naps it's lunch and then play. Sometimes we watch Baby Einstein, sometimes we read books or build block towers.   I make dinner most nights before Charlie comes home so we can all eat together. It's nice, to be able to cook and enjoy a meal. When I was still going to school, Charlie would come home and we'd eat something quick before I had to run out the door.    The more I stay home, the more I enjoy it. The pace of life has slowed down, maybe for the first time in my whole life. I watch less television and I laugh a lot more. I get more kisses. I read more. I just finished an amazing book that everyone should read, called  Prodigal Summer  (by Barbara Kingsolver). My house has never been cleaner.

        My Historical Lunatic Alter-Ego...     urlLink      Born in England sometime in the second decade of the nineteenth century, you carved a notable business career, in South Africa and later San Francisco, until an entry into the rice market wiped out your fortune in 1854. After this, you became quite different. The first sign of this came on September 17, 1859, when you expressed your dissatisfaction with the political situation in America by declaring yourself Norton I, Emperor of the USA. You remained as such, unchallenged, for twenty-one years.   Within a month you had decreed the dissolution of Congress. When this was largely ignored, you summoned all interested parties to discuss the matter in a music hall, and then summoned the army to quell the rebellious leaders in Washington. This did not work. Magnanimously, you decreed (eventually) that Congress could remain for the time being. However, you disbanded both major political parties in 1869, as well as instituting a fine of $25 for using the abominable nickname "Frisco" for your home city.   Your days consisted of parading around your domain - the San Francisco streets - in a uniform of royal blue with gold epaulettes. This was set off by a beaver hat and umbrella. You dispensed philosophy and inspected the state of sidewalks and the police with equal aplomb. You were a great ally of the maligned Chinese of the city, and once dispersed a riot by standing between the Chinese and their would-be assailants and reciting the Lord's Prayer quietly, head bowed.  Once arrested, you were swiftly pardoned by the Police Chief with all apologies, after which all policemen were ordered to salute you on the street. Your renown grew. Proprietors of respectable establishments fixed brass plaques to their walls proclaiming your patronage; musical and theatrical performances invariably reserved seats for you and your two dogs. (As an aside, you were a good friend of Mark Twain, who wrote an epitaph for one of your faithful hounds, Bummer.) The Census of 1870 listed your occupation as "Emperor".   The Board of Supervisors of San Francisco, upon noticing the slightly delapidated state of your attire, replaced it at their own expense. You responded graciously by granting a patent of nobility to each member. Your death, collapsing on the street on January 8, 1880, made front page news under the headline "Le Roi est Mort". Aside from what you had on your person, your possessions amounted to a single sovereign, a collection of walking sticks, an old sabre, your correspondence with Queen Victoria and 1,098,235 shares of stock in a worthless gold mine. Your funeral cortege was of 30,000 people and over two miles long.   The burial was marked by a total eclipse of the sun.    urlLink Which Historical Lunatic Are You?    urlLink From the fecund loins of Rum and Monkey.

        The best trash novel I never read...     Nothing Like the Sun: A Story of Shakespeare's Love-life , by Anthony Burgess. I picked it up at the book sale last month. Here is the compelling opening line:   It was all a matter of a Goddess--dark, hidden, deadly, horribly desirable. When did her image first dawn?   We the readers are supposed to be already on the edge of our seats. When  did  her image first dawn? But alas, we are not to know. Burgess takes an abrupt turn and begins to describe a teenage Shakespeare, inexplicably known only as WS, and peevish. He has siblings--Gilbert (the family idiot), Richard (whose right leg is one and a half inches shorter than his left), and Anne (who has no eyebrows). Already he speaks in verse--   "Go not too near the water, neither. Water hath a trick of drowning and, at best, is a wetter." And then the jingle ruled him, already a word-boy. "Water wetter water wetter water wetter."   Ah, that word-boy. I didn't ay it was good verse, did I?  The best sentence is this one, used to describe Jack Hoby the wild man:  He belched forth the soul of an alehouse.   I haven't decided whether to burn this book and put it out of its misery or flip through the pages for some more quotable gems.

      Four or five years ago, I was very involved with an on-campus church called Gator Christian Life (GCL). I met one of their members in my sociology class--since it was my first year in college and I was starved for companionship, I decided to go to&nbsp;a church service the following Sunday. The services were held in the Chemistry Lab Building and were unlike any services I had ever attended before.   The music was loud and the prayers were fervent. Most people stood singing with their arms raised, which is the Christian way of showing how REALLY STOKED you are about Christ. The sermon was passionate and righteous and many people claimed afterwards to have been "convicted." Right away I felt as if I was out of place,&nbsp;as if&nbsp;no matter what God had done for me could I match this level of praise and enthusiasm.&nbsp; But I was lonely and everyone was friendly and I began attending a Home Group.   It turned out that GCL was divided into many smaller groups, each serving&nbsp;a different function. Home Groups were groups of about twenty people, men and women, who met once a week at someone's house to sing praises, share refreshments and prayer requests, and study a Bible verse or two. Life Groups were the next smallest groups and consisted of four or five people of the same sex who met at the end of Home Group meetings to pray together and talk about their weeks.   The idea was that a Life Group would become your circle of most intimate friends, the ones who you went to movies with, prayed with, shared dinners and Bible verses with. That was all well and good, I suppose, but it never quite worked that way for me. I felt as if I'd walked in on a secret sorority meeting that had been going on for a long, LONG time. What I mean is, the group of girls I ended up with already knew each other very well. They had inside jokes, mutual friends elsewhere, etc. They were always very nice to me, but I quickly discovered that I couldn't be myself around them.  I couldn't admit that I liked Jewel more than DC Talk*, or that I would rather read almost anything over the  Left Behind ** series. Pro-choice was a taboo subject and kissing boys you weren't going to marry just wasn't done***. Surprisingly, I belonged to the organization for two years before I quit going.  When I left, no one called, no one emailed, no one checked to see if I had joined the Church of Satan or become a Mormon. Not one of my "best" Life Group friends even wondered what had happened. It seems they were all so busy recruiting freshman to join their Jesus Society that they had no time to see how many actual members were on their way out the door.  So that was four years ago. Two weeks ago, I ran into a GCL person, Stacy, &nbsp;at the downtown library story hour. She was there with her three-year-old daughter, Ella. She recognized me and came over to say hello. Stacy just happened to be good friends with one of the girls in my ex-Life Group, whose name was Gretchen. I asked after Gretchen and Stacy gave me her email address. Out of curiosity I emailed her to say hello, long time, how're you doing and the like.  Gretchen wrote back and told me how she'd met her husband working for Great Commission Ministries in Ohio and that now they had a little boy. I had told her that I was married and attached a couple of pictures of Jack. She commented on how cute he was and then asked for details.  So I gave them to her. How I met Charlie through mutual friends. How we were expecting Jack before we were actually married. How I am trying to decide what kind of church is best for me and my family. How I wondered what had happened to all the Life Group girls, since I never heard from any of them.  And Gretchen never replied.  *DC Talk is a Christian band most famous for the song "Jesus Freak."   **A series of books (fictional) about what it might be like at the end of the world, right after Jesus comes back and gets the True Believers and leading up until the Very End, when the world implodes and all that's left are cockroaches and Twinkies floating helpless in space, where no one will hear them screaming. The books are based on the authors' interpretation of Revelation.  ***GCL-goers were all proponents of "courting," which basically means sitting with chaperones and not touching until you decide you are good enough friends to make it a marriage, at which point you may spend your wedding night alone without birth control (which was not encouraged for married couples, the idea being that God would give you babies if you were meant to have them and would keep them to himself if you weren't, biology be damned!).

       Since I'm clearly obsessed with posting photos, I am going to steal an idea from my friend Lore and post one every day. So come, see the world through my eyes! If nothing else, it'll be interesting. The possibilities are suddenly endless. I can post my artwork...because not only do I have a digital camera--I have a scanner! This is the website I always wanted! Charlie is going to help me tweak the HTML coding and then watch! out! people!    &nbsp;  On another note entirely...I once had a professor that told us (his class) that if we used an exclamation point in his class once, we'd receive an 'F' as our class grade. If we happened to do it a second time, he'd fail us for a previous class.     &nbsp;  He hated them that much! But obviously I love them! I can't stop!

       Karaoke I    &nbsp;  She can't dance.   Wincing at her magnified voice,   she clutches the microphone   to keep herself from sinking   while&nbsp;t  he audience   takes another swig of beer.   She is suddenly aware   of her   purple Chuck Taylors--   the laces don't reach the last hole.   She thinks,     short laces, small talent,     a shower virtuoso&nbsp;with only one octave.    No one is impressed.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Karaoke II    &nbsp;  I am cute   in my jelly shoes   jelly bracelets   side ponytail   and enormous hoop earrings,   dancing to  Baby Got Back    as if I do.

      I love cherries.  I'm eating them now, like popcorn. Big handfuls of them. They were on sale at Publix, where in the summer the produce section is like my candy store. Nectarines, watermelon, cherries, blueberries, pineapple, peaches, cataloupe ... I always go a little crazy buying fruit. Jack and I have polished off two pints of blueberries in the last three days.  Awesome.  Jack had his fifteen-month check up today. He started crying when the nurse took his temperature and didn't stop until after the shots were given. Poor kid. He's napping now and will hopefully find the world a much better place upon waking up.   The big news is that he's 31 inches tall and 23 lbs. My little 6 lb, 18-incher has more than doubled his size. Not only that, but he has teeth and he can walk and he knows how to sing into a microphone just like a tiny, off-key Elvis Costello.  Last night he put on an impromptu performance in the bath tub, singing his heart out into an empty toothbrush holder. Buck naked and doing his best American Indian stomp dance. My little Bohemian.

      So. It's been almost a month since I posted last and for that, I have no explanation. I also make no apologies. I just haven't felt like it. Instead I've been reading books at a speed previously only matched in my childhood, when I'd check out ten books from the library and finish them in three days or less.   I've been reading novels by Barbara Kingsolver to the point that I am now suffering from a Kingsolver burn-out. But I love her work. I love that it's full of history and sociology and science and I love that she says everything without telling you much. My favorites so far are  Prodigal Summer  and  The Poisonwood Bible .   I have also been sewing--and for once in my life I finished a project. But please don't tell my sister because it's a surprise for Isaac Andrew and I'm rather proud of how it turned out. My next project is to create a fabulous purple quilt for my niece Emma.   See why I haven't been posting? My life is pretty unexciting. I clean the house, make some dinner, fold some socks. I think about writing poems and essays, but I never do. Sometimes I write in my journal, but usually I build block towers or play Animal Parade with Jack. We go to the library and the grocery store a lot and sometimes we visit the mall to play in the kids zone and window shop.  Some days we just stay home and make sure the animals have their heads on tight. I vacuum eveyr other day and Jack helps by riding the vacuum and taking all of the attachments out of their storage compartment. He throws his toys everywhere and stands on chairs and spits his food down his front. A couple of days ago he learned how to jump off the bottom stair. We have whole conversations using only gestures and whines.  A day in the life.

      This is the poetry of the mother, spoken or sung or simply exhaled in celebration or frustration (so often the same):  The sigh that followed conception, the galloping heart and flushed limbs, and the protective curling of the body around the greedy embryo.  The scream, almost a sigh, that propelled her reluctant son, delivering him wet and enraged into the air.  The lullabies and soothing words she tumbles into his ear when he cannot sleep, and 'no,' chanted as a prayer, a word she believes can save him.  __________________________ So I had an idea last night, and it went something like the above poem, but I failed to write down all the great lines that came to me before I fell asleep, and so this is what I end up with. Eh. A work in progress. Check back often!

        I Swear on a Stack of Bibles...    The following is an actual conversation I witnessed this morning between two characters on  Sesame Street . (It's slightly compressed, but you'll get the gist)     Prairie : The letter of the day is ' k .' It's one of my favorite letters because it begins the words  k ite and  k ey and ...   Cookie Monster : and  k owabunga.   Prairie : That's not a word!   Cookie Monster : Yes it is--it's a bit esoteric, but it's poetic in its own way.   Prairie : Then what does it mean?   Cookie Monster : It means this. ( takes a deep breath )  KOWABUNGA! ( devours letter K )

        100 Songs       My friend Lori has invited everyone she knows to participate in a project that involves burning CDs with 100 songs that have meant something to you at some point in your life. The idea is that you burn the same number of CDs as there are people participating in the project, then you trade. I am going to keep my list here, so I can edit at any time. Otherwise my list will be on whatever scraps of paper I can find when I think of another song, and I'll never finish. So, without further ado--I give you...My List.

      A love poem, one I have never been able to edit properly because it's for Charlie, a man who blindsided me.  You dear, My Scottish rogue my German aristocrat my sweet, international lover:  whisper your story in Gaelic and Greek, then blithely kiss me with your eyes closed, heart flung wide open.  Beneath a sanguine moon, I will show you the star that shines upon the hour of our meeting. _______________________  It is what it is, I suppose.

       I'm turning into one of those people. You know the ones, the ones with nothing to talk about--ever!--except their kid. I could talk for hours about the cute things he does. For instance, today he got his stuffed Big Bird out of the toy bin and offered him a drink from a toy bottle! Who taught him that?! You could have soaked me up off the floor with one of those super-absorbent paper towels.  But really, how many people would find that little anecdote as amusing as I do? I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10, how annoying are people like me? Is this just a natural consequence of having children? Two years ago I could have talked about current events, movies, books I was reading, pictures I was painting or drawing. The photos on this blog might have been of plants, or kittens, or tacky Christmas light displays.  Not that any of those things are terribly interesting...they're just, well, different. My life was different. It was all about me. But now, my driving purpose in this world is to raise Jack into a polite, helpful, kind, and intelligent man. A tall order, and a more interesting undertaking than anything I've done before--especially if you consider Jack as I do.  He arrived here with no expectations, no preconceived notions, no desires other than the basic human needs to eat and feel safe. A blank slate. Just fifteen months later, he can point his finger at me and say "no, no." He knows the cat says "meow" and the cow says "moo" (and he utters his "moos" with such feeling). He's developed preferences for mac n' cheese and Whatever Mommy Has In Her Cup.  So I guess what I'm saying is, yes, I'm probably annoying--but isn't he amazing?
