      Lets talk about Resilience. One of my favorite words ever. RESILIENCE!! I love the word Perseverence as well.... forgive me if i misspelled that. Taken straight from the miriam webster dictionary website :   One entry found for resilience.  Main Entry: re·sil·ience  Pronunciation: ri-'zil-y&n(t)s Function: noun 1 : the capability of a strained body to recover its size and shape after deformation caused especially by compressive stress  The CAPABILITY.... see that??? the CAPABILITY of a body to RECOVER........... caused especially by COMPRESSIVE STRESS. I know i skipped a piece in the middle but i will get back to that. Who ever knew that a CAPABILITY would be a noun?? Doesnt it seem more like a verb??   Anyhow, read it slowly..... close your eyes, repeat it to yourself..... The CAPABILITY of a body to RECOVER its size and shape after DEFORMATION. WOW is all i can say, what a statement. Just how resilient are you?? What of yours has been dented, walked on, smeared across the pavement, stomped on, crucified, and most of all broken?? When it happened, what did you do about it?? Did you sit there and cry like a little bitch??? Please say you didnt. Did you whine and blame and toss hints for someone to feel sorry and look down on you?? God i hope not. If so please stop reading my blog and go draw.....   Ok, for those still reading my blog, you draw too..... in your mind, or even better on paper. This is your lesson for the day..... a lesson on RESILIENCE.   Draw a circle, a PERFECT circle and turn it 3-dimensional into a sphere. A PERFECT sphere the size of a baseball except only SLIGHTLY smaller. NOW, got that? perfect sphere? good..... hold it at the level of your diaphragm.... no not the one that chicks use down there.... your diaphragm.... take a DEEP beath and where you feel like your lungs wont expand anymore, thats it.You can even feel the gap in between your expanded lungs if you concentrate hard enough...... THATS where you are to hold that sphere. Hold it tightly with your hand and then RELEASE IT. Think hard, dont let that sphere drop. levitate it if you will to sit there at the level i spoke of earlier. Let it slightly rotate.... like the earth sittin on its axis maybe..... NOW, imagine that sphere is inside of you, at the same level... just sittin there slightly spinnin, slightly turning, slightly chillin even. What color is it??? Usually that color represents who you are, your general outlook on yourself and the outside world.   OK, back to Resilience....... that sphere, is you. Your life force, or chi as some may call it. Every breath you take, concentrate on slightly spinning that sphere with the force of inspiration and expiration. Keep that sphere at a constant rotation. That sphere is your life..... that sphere is your mood, and that sphere is there to keep you balanced and ONE with this world that will all to often try to fuck you over many many times. That sphere is the rotation of your body in motion in RESPONSE to COMPRESSIVE STRESS..... COMPRESSIVE STRESS directly from the meaning of resilience. That stress will often warp the sphere, spin it faster than usually, slow it down, bounce it around, and even change its color. Concentrate.... dream, trust, love, and find a peace, balance, and THEN you will gain a higher plane..... a higher plane of living, thinking, and THEN you will be more RESILIENT!      This life gives you NOTHING easily these days. You have to take the good, the bad, the fucked up, the sweet, and the total pain of growing into the person you need or want to be. Keep that in mind as yor happy little sphere takes a beating from day to day life. Spin it back into true harmony with your mind and body, Breathe.... you are ok, NOTHING in this life can destroy you if you truly keep your mind / body / spirit focused.   Resilience.... what a wonderful word. I may sound whacko and crazy with my sphere rotating, but guess what.... im happy. Are you????

      WELL..... its monday, Haneen comes home today :) Ive missed her terribly and she knows it. I drank waaaaay too much last night. Im semi strugglin this morning. To eat, or not to eat, that is the question right now. Ive always been the stickler that when you are hungover, eat something and you will feel alot better but today im not quite sure if i can.   Anyhow, enough of my drunken stupor stories. Lets talk about life. We dont get everything we want out of life do we?? Currently i want to go back to school, want more money, and most importantly i dont want to be alone. Being alone is great in opposition to bein with a jackass or loser but it seems that someone special to me is slowly drifting away and before long it will be over. I dont want that but such as life. Consequences and pure nature and the forces drawing her away from me and the effect it is already starting to take on my sphere is definetly there. I can tell easily when i awaken, eat, look at her, kiss her even..... she will be gone soon. Ive thought into loving someone, let them go...... is it time to let her go??? She said it herself, we are SOOOO young, and we are. We really are. I could have SOOOOO much done by the time im 30. Hell look at what ive done in the past 2 years alone?? Its been one wild ride after another and im still goin strong. My potential is there, my will it there, my mind is even there..... All i need is just a TINY bit of inspiration.... thats it..... but my inspiration for the past 3 months is drifting away. Its really time to put up or shut up. Im gonna have to find clarity right now more than ever in my mind, body, spirit.... in my sphere, in my head, in my breathing. I need to trust her, and myself to do whats best, not what we always want out of life, but what is best. I must focus on the overall BIG picture, and i MUST acceot the outcome of all of this and take it in full stride as a stepping stone and not a stumbling block.   That is all for today.

      Well its almost 2 AM, the night is almost halfway over with. I need some plans!! This weekend is lookin pretty lame unless i can find something to do. I might have some plans saturday and sunday but nothing concrete. Im really hungry for my next meal but i still have 2 more hours before that. I REALLY hope to hit my goal this week. I wanna be lookin my best for San Antonio and the wedding. My overall lunchbag tonight feels lighter tonight and i hope im not starvin by 7 am when i go home and get some sleep.   Yesterday i contacted many travel companies to see just what my options were. I would love to get on the ball and get some things paid off just in cast i am leaving saint louis soon. Starting college fresh again would be a relief and a good feeling.   I DO NOT MISS PLAYING DARK AGE by the way :-p

      breath.... eyes closed, think, focus.  the last month has been hell. Ive lost alot. My best friend moved away, i lost my job, i lost alot of money, and the list goes on and on. I basically was at rock bottom for a good 2 weeks solid. It seems that the ONLY PERSON that could hit the nail RIGHT ON the head was my mother.... she described the feeling i was having deep down PERFECTLY.... like she lived it before... wait... she did.   Wow, Renae Voss... never lost focus. We dont discuss it, but i absolutely know she looks back in utter amazement of herself through some of the tougher times she went through. We all should. She walked through fire to get where she is now.   I could go on and on idolizing my mother but for now i wont.  My mind is JUST NOW starting to semi clear of the insanity clouded in it. EVERY day i worry about work, getting back in school, paying for bills, making a better life for me, and so forth. I feel lonely at times, i know noone here, i wish things were different but i know that if i could only break out into the life i want, i will be just un fucking real.  Tomorrow, go to work, do the best damn job you can Jason..... show them again and again with every single patient they did the right thing hiring you.....   Life is too short, ill be 60 soon, 80, 25, dead in the blink of an eye.....  Echo who you are, Jason.  Bust your ass to make ends meet. Get out and explore, see springfield, ride that bike, lift some weights, and continue to pride yourself on the great person you invision lookin at in the mirror one day.  Jason

      Tomorrow you are ok.... you know why you feel like this. You are totally sleep deprived. You are not a failure. Haneen loves you very much. This is all for the better. You are about to make your life amazing, you are totally in control of this situation, the past is GONE JASON...WAKE UP AND REALIZE IT....  Stop pacing, stop being nervous, you will do fine tomorrow at work. You will start gettng your ass in gear from here on out! You are not alone, you are not lonely, you are not here far far away from anyone that loves you. You are a simple phone call or plane ride away.   Sleep deprivation has totally taken its toll today on me unfortunately. Ive been cranky, emotional, and pretty much irritable since i havent been to sleep at all since ive been home. I miss Haneen much but even with all the demons raging in my head, i know shes there..... I know you are there baby holding my words close to your heart in amazement of the way that you feel towards me even now that im so far far away as i do for you my love....  Jason

      YEEE HA YEEEE HA   JESUS!! San Anotonio was AMAZING!! BOOOOOYA!!!   I am truly blessed. I had the best time this weekend in the company of many wonderful people. I was honored to meet the group of Haneen's undergrad friends. I took a liking to Salina and Anne the most. Salina because shes fun to talk lots and lots of smack with and goof around and Anne because shes really sarcastic and is really funny as well.   The wedding was beautiful. The vows at the wedding were amazing. The paragraph that was read was absolutely positively ALL i want in a partner in life. I was extremely touched by the words that were spoken. I cried, i laughed, and i went AWWWW as the children walked down the aisle as well to the marriage of their parents.   I enjoyed drinking and ass shaking friday night. The club was sorta typical Poly-Esthers but oh well. Taco Cabana was the perfect mix of food to eat at 3 in the morning. The hotel was really nice. I went to sleep next to an insanely gorgeous woman.....( anyone know who that was?)   Saturday, MMMMM great margaritas and food overall, but the Margaritas were awesome. We tipped the Mariachis as they played Guantanamera' for us. I dunno why but its one of my favorite mariachi songs yet its basic and played everywhere. Trinity was beautiful. Cardiac hill wasnt so bad. The fountain was soothing to my feet and scabby knees. The meditation garden was pretty and Haneen's old dorm was erm....still there. The market was interesting, MOTOCHICA was unleashed to the world in the form of a belt....hey, you gotta start somewhere ya know. The nap me and that extremely hot woman took that afternoon was sooo nice and to the wedding we went.   Sunday, that sexy beast of a woman that kept following me around all weekend and I remembered the Alamo after eating brunch and saying our goodbyes to the wonderful friends I met the weekend. We also walked through the rivercenter, listened to more music from the balcony outside while eating our Marble SLab ice cream. We took the rental car back, went to the airport, i took a nap, she played with my hair, and eventually we boarded. Poor Hope was scared of takeoff, but i reassured her she was ok knowing damn well if something happened, she would put some hoodoo magic on me as the plane crashed and burned.   So many memories of this amazing trip. I only posted a fraction of them here. There are so many more but these were the ones that spontaneously come out at the moment.   Jason

      Shouldnt i be sad?? Shouldnt i cry, scream, and cry once again to the thought of her.... my best friend.... gone.   Shouldnt i be sad?????? Shouldnt i lay in the bed that we spent so many nights in and cry clutching the pillow where she lay her beautiful head? Shouldnt i break down in tears every time i hear her voice on the phone? Shouldnt i refuse to eat, sleep, think, and live until i am one with her??  No, im not.  Very surprised i am.... I am taking this quite well. Haneen got off the plane in Houston as i remained to fly to Saint Louis. I hugged her tight, expressed my love for her, and watched her walk away from me. My love, my best friend, and my inspiration turned and walked away..... its enough to make you die inside isnt it??   But im still alive....  Perhaps moreso than ever.... The big picture unfolds slowly every passing day. Haneen is doing what she needs to do in life as i am. For ourselves, and for each other if the fates allow.   Physically, yes my body yearns.... for her and her only. My body reaches out to her while i sleep. I still whisper "baby" in the dark to someone who isnt there, I still get stuck in traffic and go BRBRBRBBBRBRBRBBRBRBRBBRBRRRRBRBR as i think of ALL the times me and haneen do that to each other. I eat a protein bar but its just not the same, I plan on going to the park with whomever wants to test their throwing arm with a baseball but it just wont be the same as the somewhat wimpy throws of hers. ( sorry babe, but its true :P ) I see her gorgeous eyes staring at my clumsy slumber while her hands run through my hair. I see her shoot that tequila like a real man would. She lives, breathes, and walks beside me in so many ways yet shes in Houston......  Emotionally.... wow.... i am intact. I woke this morning to a blue sphere only slightly spinnin faster than i want. I stress the power of ASSURANCE and i see that every time i talk to Haneen on the phone, internet, or whatever. It seems so far we BOTH have lost NO focus at all and if anything, gathered some of our senses. Amazed i am of how i am taking all this. I look foward to my new life in Springfield. I look foward to going back to school to get my degree and seek further education. I can honestly say that i do hope my education post bachelor's will be geographically closer to Haneen but thats a different story for now.   Haneen.... "Nostalgia" in Arabic. Lets observe...... Once again i observe the miriam websters dictionary for the definition of "Nostalgia"   Pronunciation: nä-'stal-j 1 : the state of being homesick  2 : a wistful or excessively sentimental yearning for return to or of some past period or irrecoverable condition; also : something that evokes nostalgia   Amazing isnt it.... read that second definition at least twice.   "EXCESSIVELY SENTIMENTAL YEARNING" for RETURN to or of some PAST IRRECOVERABLE condition.   I YEARN for the days i walked hand in hand with you in Tennessee Haneen. I YEARN for the day i held you on the plane from saint louis to Houston. I YEARN EXCESSIVELY for the times we talked about the TRUE inner person that noone saw in me except you baby.......  The past is IRRECOVERABLE no doubt. Your memories live with me every day.... i smile... i laugh...sometimes cry, but the hope YOU bestowed in me shines brighter it seems knowing you are gone but hope remains. My best friend remains. My plans remain. My faith in you remains.  Jason

      Before starting in on my life and the past few days / week or so i must type a formal apology to my blog.... you have been there to listen to me whine, gripe, vent and express yet i have ignored you for the past 12 days or so and im truly sorry for that :-p   Ok anyhow, now that this is outta the way, enjoy reading the updates of me, haneen, life, love, and the everlong pursuit of becoming happy and balanced.

      Do you know how to channell?   hell i may be spelling that wrong. Mebbe its Channel or something but anyhow, we will say CHANNELL.   Wait, first off. GO PISTONS!! Jesus they kicked the lakers ass tonight. Hard core too. It wasnt even close. Like 20 points??  Ok, anyhow, channeling. As in your emotions. Name a few emotions.... love, hate, lust, anger, faith just to name a few. Notice something about all of these?? There are a few more but take a look at them. Something you probably never think about OR you will never admit is the fact that these are all NATURAL. Anger, for instance. Anger is one of my favorite emotions. Why anger? you may ask. Well, anger is ALWAYS gonna be there no matter what. Someone murder your family or cut you off driving down the road or take the last doughnut in the break room? You significant other cheat and you found out? You paper cut yourself at work? You pull your quad playing softball (ouch). What has made you angry the last week or two?? Someone (a best friend perhaps) fuck you over at work? (thanks babe)   Ok, i could go on and on and on and on and on and you know BUT heres the point......  Ok well heres not the point, lets look at another emotion really quick..... LUST. MMMMMMMM LUST. Dont ya love it. Seein that sexy woman that you would just LOVE to get your hands on, seein that picture of david beckham on the cover of that magazine with those muscles at the bottom of his abdomen that i absolutely will never have LOL. OK, lets hit a little closer to home. See that woman in the office that hints at a "drink" after work that your wife or her husband doesnt really have to know about. Ok anyhow, i dont really know HOW to describe lust that much in detail but believe me, i DAYUM sure know what its like to lust after someone....specially a certain someone thats quite exotic in my eyes with gorgeous hair and a nice ass.... wait im getting off on a tangent  OK>>>! Heres the point to all my jabbering, please stay with me here. All of these emotions named up there are all NATURAL and they will happen at some point in your life, hell more than likely 3-4 times a DAY!!! a DAY.... a DAY..... 3-4 times in A DAY GOD DAMNET~!!!!   SOOOO.... what are you gonna do?  Anyone who REALLY knows me, which is very few, acknowledges the fact that YES i am a dork.... ugh i have been called a dork so many times BUT ITS ONLY by those who REALLY know me. Guess what else i am called??? Hrmmmmm patient.... yes me, patient. Resilient (which i STRIVE to be in so many ways). I have been complimented on my level of concentration, pain tolerance both physical and emotional. Ive been called inspirational, ive been called tons of good things. BUT GUESS WHAT WORLD>>>> I HAVE SOOOOO MANY PEOPLE FOOLED :) :) :) :)   First off, i am LAZY. I am a typical guy that likes beer, boobies, football, sex, and um... anything else that jiggles and doesnt whine when i dont wanna watch the latest quirky romantic comedy. I like to sleep, fart, and look at my girlfriends ass when shes not in the mood to put up with me and i would know this if i was listening to her instead of staring at her ass.  Whats my secret in gettin these people to think such nice things about me?? Well lemme tell ya. I learned when i was reborn 2years ago that yes, emotions are natural. Yes, emotions are gonna occur rather WE LIKE IT OR NOT, but guess what.... thats where the whole FUCKING WORLD turns ape shit crazy.  When someone / something pisses you off, breaks your heart, attracts you, angers you, persuades you, lifts you up, strikes you down, laughs at you, inspires you, calls you names, reminds you of the ultimate fuck-up you are, or whatever the hell your emotions do..... you gotta take all that energy.... POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE and churn it into something. Focus that emotion into nothing but RAW energy....  E = MC squared. INGENIUS.... the power of light. If only the crazy technology we have these days could match the power of light, what amazing things we could do.   Our bodies are sacred, imperfect, unsymetrical, and alot less refined than we think.... yet we have so much power to REASON. Take the RAW ENERGY that comes from the adrenaline flow of your emotions and FOCUS. Let that be your LIGHT into the person you want to become. If we could only reach the power of light, we could be unstoppable. Focus on the person you wanna be.... when someone hurts you....  Focus on the person you wanna be... when you fall in love with someone and know you want to spend the rest of your life with them. Focus on the person you want to be.... when you lose everything and you have to start over at absolutely rock bottom. Focus on who you want to be.... when life hurts so bad you want to do nothing but cry in the bed curled up into a ball of nothing while your poor defensless chi rotating the sphere begs you to GET THE FUCK UP and USE THE POWER INVESTED in you to CHANGE YOU LIFE GOD DAMNET!!!!   The flow of emotion from our nervous system will never accumulate to the power of natural light BUT for a body as small as ours, it will damn sure do. A tiny ounch of adrenaline mixed with a few pheremones mixed with a few emotions mixed with a few endorphines and jesus Christ what can you not overcome?? Some shithead dumping you?? some lame bitch getting you fired? some fear of admitting I LOVE YOU. What?? what can you not overcome with the power you generate from the love and or hate and or faith and or (insert emotion here im fucking tired of listing things, its too late at night)   Think about it. You can do sooo much in this world with the tiny body you have. Some of the most famous kung fu legends were known for their immaculate strength yet they were so small. They knew how to focus. They got angry. They got weak of the world. We all do.... chose wisely please. Use your energy in a way that will make you love yourself more and more...... i could go on and on and on about positive energy and all that shit, but actually a little negativity on someones ass is sometimes not such a bad idea >:)   all the peoples out there who think i have some amazing level of concentration, or patience, or nicey nice guyness or whatever...guess what? im no different than you. I eat, breath, and poo just like you. When life sucks, or even when life is awesome, i use it unlike ALOT of people do...... that is the ONLY difference in me and others......   Goodnight

      GO Pistons!! Tonight is game 3 and i really hope detroit beats the Lakers. Im not the biggest basketball fan but i dont like the lakers at all. Anyhow, today i SHOULD hear back from Rhode island so i will know if im visiting them or not this weekend. I also will hear from the Springfield hospital about what all they have to offer me. I REALLY cant wait to find some closure in all of this and take care of this immediately so i can get on with my life. Both places are going to be an extremely good oppurtunity but deep down i feel i will be going to Rhode Island. Springfield is nice, very nice, but i just think once i physically SEE Rhode island, i will be wanting to go there.   Anyhow, lets discuss something today. Hrmmmmm what to talk about. Ive recieved yet another email to me based on "Run Away". Im glad it makes sense to some and im glad someone is actually inspired by something i write in this blog. "Run Away" was based on some thoughts i had at one time, a very crucial turning point of my life even. Running away is often seen as weakness and falling short BUT i reallythink if you run away yet return a better person, you have truly accomplished something and as i said before, you will love yourself more in the end.   Ok, Thursday morning..... I slept good, im rejuvenated, gotta lotta energy and dunno how to waste it. I really just wish Rhode Island would call damnet so we can get this straightened out. I really wanna get this ball rollin so i can get on with it. I cant wait for this weekend since me and haneen are going on yet another trip. Not having something to worry about would help me out lots. I kinda wish i knew where i would be job wise by this weekend but thats not gonna happen. That would take a huge burden off my shoulders but oh well, such as life.I can just see me drivin a big Uhaul truck 1200 miles, cant you?? I would be all singin all the way across the US.   The 2 terms that come to mind right now are this..... I am either an Aislingeach pronounce AES LEN GEAH or a Sundancer. Aislingeach is a dreamer... whats your dream? Right now i dream of in 1 year i look back and seeing i made the best decision for me and i am entirely successfull for doing so. I see me and Haneen honestly not together but best friends throughout life. I see the contentment i have for what my life is still becoming and what i have become. I also see myself loving the new chage of scenery and my new surroundings. A sundancer.... one who sings in the rain and dances in the sun. Take straight from a song, a sundancer is "Set apart, running free, sundancer...dancing around me." Basically the whole song is based on someone observing a free spirit she wants to be like but cant... Mainly due to her uptight lifestyle. Sundancer feels the true light and equilibrium of the earth and all its inhabitants and he/she flows throughout everyday. I really feel that right now i am more of the Aislingeach than the sundancer but i would love to be both. The sundancer is out of my reach due to me worrying so damn much lately. Other than that, life is good :-p   Set apart..... runnin free..... sundancer, dancing round me Aislingeach.... whats your dream???  Jason

      WELL..... heres the choice. Springfield or Providence. I can more than likely go either. I could be in Springfield and get a good job, get back in school, move quicker, and pretty much get SETTLED easier. I can get a good shift, good hours, and work for an overall nice facility.   Providence..... REALLY good opportunity, GREAT money, good bonuses, good equipment, 1200 miles away so it would be sorta tough gettin everything in order to move and getting there but theres alot of relo money available in this deal.   Where does one start? I know my parents dont want me to go to Rhode Island due to me being so far away and mommas baby is out of reach. Hell i tried Alabama but couldnt find a job there so that scratches that idea. I wanted to go back to alabama to get back in school.... to get back in school. I do know that both locations have the program i want to study. Providence seems like a more exciting place to be but Springfield seems really laid back and alot less stressfull than a city which at this turning point of my life, i may need more than anything.   This is nuts isnt it?? I have no idea where to go. I really feel i would like either location and i really think i could get alot accomplished at either place but theres just soooo much soul searching i need to do. I could possibly see the facility in Rhode Island as early as monday, ive already spoken with them about this.  I have already spoken with and seen the facility in Springfield and know what im getting into there.   Time.... is a luxury i dont have right now. I am doing everything on my side to prepare myself to move and get up and go but i just gotta know WHERE am i moving to?? :) Strange huh?  Anyhow, this is my ordeal. I really hope something comes up and available before too long. I really need some closure and more than anything, i need to get on with my life.  Jason

      I love this fucking song. Its been out for ages and its by Disturbed. ive left maybe 2 or 3 lines out but overall here is how it goes........  Are you breathing now??? best line in the song :-p    So, are you breathing  Wake up, are you alive Will you listen to me I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now    Let the living die, Let the living die (say)  Are you breathing now Do the wicked see you You still breathing You're making me known  I can hear the voice But I don't want to listen Strap me down and tell me I'll be alright  I can feel the subliminal need To be one with the voice And make everything alright  So, are you breathing? Can't you imagine how good going through this will make you feel I promise, no one will ever know There will be no chance of you getting caught They never loved you anyway So come on, be a man And do what you are compelled to do.

      Well, the title says it all.... its friday damnet!!! This has been one hell of an emotional roller coaster for myself as well as Haneen. Sooo much has been on her as far as moving, trips, planning, deadlines, etc. Alot has been on my mind as well such as jobs, locations, money, deadlines, and simply where is my place in this world. This weekend is gonna be great though. Ive purposely put off a job interview till monday so i can enjoy every single minute of the weekend and relax with her. The guy from my monday interview wanted me to come on down tomorrow but i was like no thanks, ill come monday.   Im gonna go to the Cardinal's game tonight. Im really excited. Haneen got us tickets and im really ready to go. I love ball games and the Astros are a tough team so it should be a good series. The cards won 4 straight against pittsburgh so they could easily move up in the division if they get their shit together.   Anyhow, this weekend, im gonna hit up Mr. Sushi tomorrow. I cant wait. Me and Haneen have really missed eatin there and we both are craving it big gime. I also want some ice cream since its our free day. Haneens digital scale says im still 199, i as 198 last night after playin softball but im guessing i had a fluid loss from the running, moving, etc.   Anyhow, im not doing anything this weekend if i dont get this house cleaned!!! Ive gotta finish some clothes and do the dishes AND i have the big interview on the phone today with Providence. WOW! Me in Rhode Island. That state is smaller than tallapoosa county alabama where i grew up. Isnt that crazy?? I might ride my bike across the state one weekend just for shits and giggles.  Anyhow, i might post again after the phone interview and let the world know whats up. For those that care anyhow. I was very shocked and honored to recieve an email from someone who read "Run Away" by me. Im glad you liked, im glad its inspiring and i really hope you follow through and follow your heart.   Jason

      Well, i said something the other night that i think about all the time..... My life started 2 years ago. Seriously. Im not 24, im 2 :)      Its amazing that everything pretty much before september 2002 is pretty much a blur of a FEW happy childhood memories smudged with tons of depression, abuse, sadness, being severely overweight, being worried, lonely, and just all around sad.       Heres a quote a wise man once said..... well actually he didnt, i made it up so you know its not a total wise man. More like a wise ass, but anyhow, here it is.....    "You learn more about yourself when you are ALL you've got."  Think about it. Think about it hard. It took me leaving EVERYTHING behind back home for me to get to the point i am now. I worry alot, i have bills, women problems, and im often busy with work or other things but ever since i left Alabama back in september 2002, its been ME. For the most part, i havent asked ANYONE for help unless i was indeed struggling bad. I havent relied on anyone even to the point now i have too much pride to. I really think the first year away from home i learned that i can be happy, im not a fuck up, im definetly not a failure, and more of all, im actually a cool guy. I dropped some weight. A little more with the help of the BEAUTIFUL Haneen and Bill Phillips. Im really confident these days. I get out alot more, i am alot more focused on my breathing, my life, and the revolving and pigmentation of the sphere.      So anyhow, heres my point to you.... whomever reads this. Are you really tired of your life? Has some dickhead or drama queen got you down? You swarmed in debt? Tired of all the nah nah nah bullshit? Tired of the way people look at you, treat you? Tired of your parents? Abusive boyfriend/girlfriend? Tired of your town, scenery, job, LIFE????? Get up.... right fucking now.... RIGHT NOW and leave. yes Leave. Pack all you can into your small ass 1997 ford mustang and hit the road. Go off to some far off location 2000 miles away from your backwards ass life and get your ass in gear. I dont mean go run off and be some beach combing hippie who cools his milk in a creek. Go somewhere and work 3 jobs to pay off your old bills, Go to a city and live in this cheap ass small ass studio apartment but never be home. Go outside!! Get off your ass and go outside for christ sake. Get away from everyone and everything in this life that gets you down, breaks you open, and makes you cry. Get away from the family that always tells you what you SHOULD do or who you SHOULD be with or what YOUR life needs to be. Get out, run away, learn sooo much about yourself. you know why??? because you will be ALL you have right then. You wanna see if you are tough enough?? independent? Strong? OR do you wanna see if you are the person that the whole fucking world has got you down and out about??? Exactly, go find out. Get up, run away. Even the prodigal son returned a better person. Go off from podunk ass town mississippi and run away to the west coast to live in a hostile while working 2 jobs to support yourself and learn who the hell you really are.... i dare you.... you will love yourself so much more in the end.

      She said, goodbye, too many times before!!   I have no idea why that song is in my head, i guess since it was on the radio or something. If you hoped to read a message about how my relationships are going by the title of my entry, SORRY :*( so sad.   Anyhow, its too early to be awake in my opinion. I wish i was in the bed but i slept really good and once i wake up, im up for real. I read on a body for life forum about some dude trying to kick dark age of camelot as a bad habit. I told him to delete the game from his computer, BREAK THE GAME CDs and give his account to some random stranger right before he quits just so he can NEVER PLAY again. I think he took my advice :)   199 is my weight today. Im already 1/5 of my goal till i get to san antonio. It my 4 week photo was shocking, I really cant wait to see the week 8 / 12 as well. I could sorta tell in the mirror but the photos really tell the story.   Anyhow, wow talk about standing at a crossroad and looking left, right, up, down, everywhere about what the hell i can / should / better do in life. Its amazing the options yet how far away but so close i am to sooooo many goals and dreams. Anyhow, no use harping on them. I just gotta do what i feel is best for me, meet my time frames, and kick some ass. Nothing beats the daily assurance that YOU ARE OK JASON. The sphere is blue, i am strong, i have concentration beyond belief and above all, i am resilient. Remember the sphere?? :-p Its chillin this mornin. Life is good, i have alot more than i really think about. I have Haneen, shes soooo supportive. Shes leaving soon but dear God im so proud of her and everything shes accomplished.   WELL that is all for now, its early though. Dont be sad. I will type more and more when something off the wall comes to my head or i feel like venting or if im just fucking bored. I really need to make a grocery list so me and haneen can get some food mmmm.   Jason

          So this morning, its a gorgeous misty morning..... misty as in a deep deep fog. I wouldnt appreciate it so much if i still lived in Saint Louis due to the traffic, getting home, etc. The fog was so deep when i stepped foot outside the front door of the hospital that i couldnt see the parking lot 50 feet away. I felt relieved my shift was over, i felt glad it was time to go to bed, but suddenly something strange happened........      I invite you now to put away every and anything you have read in my blog and look beneath some of the idiotic, crude, sarcastic, and often downright mean things i may say for this morning's experience was unlike no other ive had in a while...... Try to look beneath the surface of me and possibly experience what i did this morning..... I would say close your eyes and imagine but its really not possible to do so while reading this now is it?      The first foot out the door was caught by a sudden halting sensation inside my body, the sphere pulsed strong once. Much darker than the norm, i thought the darker shade was due to my lack of rest. I stopped dead in my tracks, people walked past me, to their cars. Something about the first step and the deep single pulse from my inner life force made me stop completely and just take a look around. The morning was fresh, so new looking. A new day was creating right in front of my eyes. The sun was rising to banish the morning fog right before me. My Sphere pulsed once more and commanded me to .... yes.... breathe.       That first breath, i caught myself.....closed my eyes, formed the ribbonlike motion up my nose, down my throat and into my lungs. The mist in the air cooled and condensed in my trachea and cooled like menthol as it branched at my carina into my lungs. The sphere started to rotate to its normal speed and almost magically, the ribbon engulfed the sphere, changing its color slightly into a lighter blue and as the ribbon was vacuumed out.... back up my trachea except this time out my mouth, the ball of energy began to glow..... in appreciation that i for once stopped to appreciate what a wonderful, beautiful world we DO live in, breath the fresh air, engulf my senses in it even........  Possibly the first time ive lived here, i felt yes...... enlightened.  Jason

      OK...... so i got this shirt from my friend from Hawaii (thanks alot babe, by the way).....  It is solid blue.... with BIG WHITE LETTERS across it that ways HAWAII........ Sounds pretty self explanatory and easy to ready in plain fucking english right??? A pic will be coming soon.   This t-shirt&nbsp;was bought at Old Navy in Honolulu. For those who didnt catch the description please read again.... wait dont, if you cant comprehend SOLID BLUE with BIG WHITE LETTERS that say HAWAII on it, just go to bed or pour hot scalding coffee in your eyeballs or something besides read my blog....  Ok anyhow.... so im in the grocery store in Alabama saturday morning with my friend Ben when this really weird Winn-Dixie employee comes up to us. From the very get-go i can tell hes definetly a few fries short of a happy meal. He reminded me of the guy from Slingblade, you know.... i like dem french fried taters MMMMM HMMMMMM!!   Ok anyhow, creepy winn dixie employee comes up to me and Ben and looks directly at my shirt and says "HARVARD AYE???"   I look at the shirt, looked at him, looked at the shirt, looked at him, looked at the shirt one more fucking time just to give him a chance to catch his mistake only to see he doesnt so i reply..... "YEP....HARVARD.....(pause while i look at the shirt).... Is that where you went too??"   Ok my friend Ben is crackin up beyond belief..... im keeping a straight face, thinking to myself "what a dumbass" and he speaks.....  "No....didnt go to Harvard"   End of Conversation.  OK..... so the shirt gets washed, thrown in the suitcase and forgotten about. Well..... this morning when i was gettin dressed for the ride home i decided to put it back on just because i really like it. Well my driver's liscence is really strugglin' due to bein washed a few times and other things. It has cracks and a chip in it so i decided since im home, i will get a new one.   HAWAII shirt and all, i walk into the place. The lady behind the counter said and i quote "never knew any Alex City graduates of Harvard!"   I look at her..... look at my shirt..... look at her...... look at my shirt...... look at her.... (giving her every chance available to understand im fucking with her and giving her the chance to catch herself before while i think of something mean to say if she doesnt, which she doesnt) and say "Yep, i was gifted, graduated there when i was 17!! Finished Yale also&nbsp;when i was 20 with my second doctorate in metabolic physics!"   She believed every word of it...... Jesus Christ whats this world coming to.......  Ok, i get home. Its like midnight or something. My roommates drunk girlfriend is here and shes like hey how are ya??!! Ive never met this one, so i was all nice and sociable and stuff even though she was smoking in the house.&nbsp; She looked directly at the shirt and said "WOW HE WENT TO HARVARD!!!"   I was astonished.... blown away even.... SO i did what any smart ass, politically incorrect, jack hole like me would do. I looked at my shirt...... looked at her...... looked at my shirt..... looked at her...... looked at my shirt..... (giving her the chance to PLEASE NOTICE IT DOESNT FUCKING SAY HARVARD!!!) and said "Um baby...... please.... retake some of those college classes you slept with your professor to pass."   She had this puzzled look on her face, let out a giggle, and said "oh i didnt go to college."   I looked at my shirt, nodded to her, went in my room.   Jason  &nbsp;

      What am i scared of? Why am i so worried? Today, i lit up that interview?? Someone out there tell me please, just how back can one fuck up get me? I have this aweful lingering thought that my St. Louis mishap is gonna bite me in the ass on this.   UAB was cool today. I really enjoyed the interview. I looked sharp, i talked sharp, i thought before i answered, i displayed the person i really wanted them to see and the person i really thought i was.... but really, just how much is one mistake gonna fuck me???  That feeling, of the unknown, still lingers. I want this out. I wanna get my ass to birmingham. I wanna get the hell out of Missouri. I want sweet home alabama and UAB and school and most of all to get my fucking life on track. Im SO TIRED of feeling not good enough........  Baby, your all that i want, when your lying here in my arms.....&nbsp; Haneen.... tonight, i needed your voice..... so much. calming, soothing, reassuring, counting the days till we are together.....  ugh i need sleep. this sucks. I know all too well that i kicked that interviews ass and Nothing short of one hell of a candidate will keep me outta UAB. faith Jason.....  Jason

      Dear Barista..... &nbsp; you SUCK!@!!! but dear god i love you for it...... &nbsp; yes.... ME of all people praising poor customer service. See, ive learned you.... all too well, you lazy ass hoochie. You come to work dressed like a tramp with a starbucks apron on, your makeup is nasty, you need to get your roots done, and its obvious you hate your job but PLEASE dont quit.... i love you...... &nbsp; You see..... when i order my triple grande nonfat mocha, you are so fucking lazy that you dont stir it good for me..... yes babe, i watch you.... with your 2 swirls. Come on, you know theres a whole puddle of hersheys syrup at the bottom of that cup that needs to be mixed with my nonfat milk. You know that the 3 shots of expresso is way too much for a grande and needs to be mixed well with all the contents of my order yet you still swish twice with that spoon..... but i love you for it. &nbsp; See i learned you..... Perhaps starbucks trained you this way so i will purchase the triple shot instead of the double..... that extra shot gives me the deep coffee/expresso flavor that i love soooo much.... immediately followed by your laziness when i stick my straw all the way to the bottom of the cup to take a nuce bolus of hersheys syrup. Its exstatic to have that rush of chocholate immediately followed by the expresso..... mmmm so good. all due to one barista hating her job....... &nbsp; For once, i applaud you.... lazy one. Please. lean on the counter all you want, even in front of me, the customer. Please continue to not thouroughly mix my drink so that i may enjoy the fruits of your non labor :)  &nbsp; Jason

      There you lay.... in a million pieces right in front of me.... my mouth wide opened, my shirt off, a piece of my life now gone...... &nbsp; I left you there, in the floor, broken pieces for someone else to pick up...... Why does nostalgia hit me so fucking hard? All the times you were there, throughout my exodus from alabama into the great northwest. Into the midwest we went on wings of my car, during the nights i cried, danced till dawn, drank into a stupor, partied like tomorrow will never come, and i will never die..... &nbsp; You were with me always as the accent worked the women at the bars (specially seattle), the beaches of fort walton when trey lived there and we would go every other weekend, and finally, the last day of your 10+year journey with me. All the people ive met, all the ones who asked for you, even offering money, and even the upset people who i never even let touch you.... &nbsp; So many pictures i have with you..... even on my more recent, of me eating a piece of pie at the house of pies in houston..... I thought you would live forever... with me.... and venture secretly even if you had to like when we interviewed at Barnes and even this shithole of springfield. Children grabbed for you at the hospital in Birmingham, I grabbed harder when they went after you.....  Were you a symbol?? Of my freedom? Of my child-like spirit that was yet to be REALLY broken again since i left alabama? I never took you off, cept when i slept or showered if i remembered. I didnt want to break you carelessly...... but there in the store, you fell off, into many pieces no longer mine.  &nbsp; &nbsp; goodbye pooka shell necklace.... there will never be another one like you..... only ones who wish to be like you. You will be replaced more than likely by some token to wear around my neck, perhaps another closely resembling you.... but you will always hold a special place close to me for i picked you out years and years ago and you surprised me by lasting this long..... &nbsp; Jason&nbsp; &nbsp; Jason

      Well damnet, i didnt get my bonus..... i guess another week or two of struggling to make ends somewhat meet. Its not really that bad. Ive conserved lots and lots of monies since my check didnt have my bonus. Ive only spent what i really needed and such. I dont need anything really. I have plenty of clothes, i bought groceries to last me at least a week and a half and im not really doing anything other than working so there ya go.  &nbsp; Anyhow, nothing has changed..... cept the fact i want the fuck outta here. The end factor right now is Birmingham, what can i do to get there, and what i will do in order to get my ass back there. I am up to 40 exams in CT. I have already ordered my registry application packet, and ive already began to study for my registry. All i need is my 125 exams, take it, and get er done.  &nbsp; Work..... sucks.&nbsp; Ive never seen such a clusterfuck in my life. Anyhow, i could type endless pages on that but i just dont want to. I just woke up and i already dont wanna ruin my day. Instead i will eat my yogurt and cottage cheese and try to find somethin on this sunday afternoon to kill a few hours. I do however have a wonderful crew at work tonight and i actually look foward to working with them.  &nbsp; Birmingham..... geez how far away yet so close you are to me and to my future plans and dreams. What the hell can i do to expedite myself from springfield and fly far far far away from here. I saw a shirt in the mall yesterday with the state of missouri on it and it said "Oh take me outta my Missouri." Jesus Christ it hit the nail right on the head.&nbsp; I think me going to texas a few times made me realize just how nice the south really is, how friendly people are, and the fact that there is truly no place like home. I hate my boss too.... shes a dumbass and i hope she gets fired :-p  &nbsp; Anyhow, off to eat my yogurt i go. Ive got a beeeeeezy day of doin something or nother. Dunno what yet, but ill find something. I Just wanna get outta the house and enjoy the day before i go to work.   Jason

      SO basically i sit here, gettin ready to go put in my 5th day in a row, only 8 or something to go, im excited...... yeah i know, what am i smoking?? &nbsp; Anyhow, my first check comes tomorrow. Im excited to finally get a paycheck again. Ive already carefully mapped out where its going. Ive taken advice from very important people in my life to save, save, save in case this kinda bullshit happens again LOL &nbsp; On the other hand, after saving, ive still got alot to do. I need groceries. Im tired of steamed broccoli sandwiches :-p I DONT need clothes, i dont need shoes, i dont need anything frivilous, so guess what.... im shootin for the credit cards. I MIGHT pay off my personal line and possibly car also if all is well. Will have to see exactly how much im getting first. I need to BREATH also because hell, my next check has a crit pay shift on it and 20+ hours overtime as well so disappointment for not paying off everything in my path this time wont be such a letdown.  &nbsp; Anyhow, tomorrow the main challenge begins. The bills being paid will be an amazing feat and will really show what kinda discipline and self sacrifice i will and/or can endure. &nbsp; Jason  &nbsp;

If i can accomplish that, my life will be at this huge NOW WHAT???? Phase.   Ugh, but how? I cant just make it disappear so i work.... work my ass off. Kick some ass, work the overtime, pick up the crit pay, and most of all BELIEVE.   Haneen is far away from me, the parents are as well, trey and tonya are miles and miles..... Guess what? I am alone here..... I always said, ALWAYS said, and always will say...  You learn more about yourself when you are all you've got. This is my shot.... my chance... what am i made of??

      ****SPECIAL POST****  Ok first and foremost, i would like to clarify some things. I was HOPING that with my last entry i would be able to reach out to a few select people but its just not the case as in i have to be more specific. I was hoping my words were vivid enough for some to comprehend but i guess not so here goes another shot.... It seems the past day ive recieved emails of confusion from a few folks....Mainly the ones i really wanted to get across to. SOOOOO for the record, if you have NEVER read my blog and i sent you a link to it specifically stating what entry i wanted you to read, guess what??!!! YES there is a possibility it is directed to YOU, you dumb fuck??!!! Yes you, drama queens, yes you, liars, bitches alike, Yes you... person and or people that get on my god damn nerves, yes you people that clutter the mind of someone trying to not become someone like (gasp) YOU!! SO if you dont get it now, theres just no hope for you and i have no choice but to just start ignoring you from now on :)          OK..... back to mind/body/spirit      For those of you just tuning into my blog, please ready Jason 7.0 first before reading this for it is just a continuation of it. I would hate for you to fall into a deep WTF?!! syndrome for lack of knowing what the hell im talking about.      This installment of my blog will go over the balance of mind,body,spirit that i will be attempting to obtain. Upon completion of the 3 pillars (as i may call them) I will list goals, reasons, maybe even fears i have about them.      I really think body is the easiet pillar to describe so here goes. In the past 3 months, i have dropped 25 pounds. I feel healthy, more attractive, and easier to kidnap (good one haneen :p)  I do, however know im still fat. YES i am. I want that to change. I want to drop about 15 more pounds and reap the benifits of having a more sound body. Ive totally started over a 12 week body for life program due to me not totally sustaining my last one even though i did quite well. I have gained no more weight and actually lost another pound or two.     Ive concentrated immensely over the last few days (since the house of pie weekend) of what i put into my body as far as food and drink goes. I will have my free days of course but the struggle MUST continue throughout my non free days in order to keep my temple in check. With a physically sound body i will continue to walk with more confidence and well being Ive ridden the bike more, walked more, joined the AMAZING employee wellness center and i plan to be there often. I like to do physical activities so its not bothering me at all. I have the constant urge to go outside and do something. I really dont want to look like some muscled out body builder. Its the confidence i desire really and want to obtain. I actually like my body now, its just i want to fit in the smaller jeans, be more active without tiring out as easily, things like that.     Possibly the most pillar at this time to me is my mind.  Too much lately, i have been angry, confused, undisciplined, cluttered and depressed. Stress sucks me up so much as it does us all. My mind and spirit was totally broken once and has been strained lately. Money... yes money has stressed me out sooo much, I do not have the time nor energy to post just how much but basically my debt has kept me from living to my fullest. I want to go back to college but it is tough with rent, car payment, and tons of other unneccessary debt. I have decided to totally bust my ass at work and pick up some major overtime again and again in order to dwindle down my debt. My car is almost paid off, possibly in 2 weeks even. If i can knock out the credit cards, i will be set in a HUGE way. My goal is to pay off everything i can, drop work to part time, and get back to school at my fullest potential. Work needs to revolve around school, not vice versa. I also know i will not be able to spend money on stupid things, just my daily living expenses. My trip to hawaii is postponed until october for this very reason. If i could get back in school, i would be so very proud of myself.     Money isnt the only problem in my mind, but it defiently branches out many of them. I dont have money to fix my car stereo, see haneen as much, pay for dates when we do, and many other little things i wish i could accomplish. Once my financial situation is under control, im sure i will be a brand new person. My mind is also cluttered by a huge black hole of the past that i have NO idea how to banish. I have one thing i will be talking with someone (haneen) about in order to eliminate but other than that, the rest remains.     My spirit is something i really am not worried about as much. I really feel i am a good spirited person and uve always had that. My mind and body have often turned the sphere a different color but overall, its O.K.  Monday i am visiting Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Springfield to learn about becoming one. I spoke with one of their representatives today on the phone. I am also planning a trip to south alabama to meet up with my real father in august i think. It will be at the end of the summer once things die down but its definetly been a long time coming. I am hoping to do it when i meet haneen in alabama. I dont really expect her to go meet him with me but i think it would be a good idea since i will already be in alabama.    To keep my spirit clean, i have also planned on checkin out more martial arts schools here in springfield. So far my search has yielded nothing of interest.  I hope this compilation is not only some insight to you of who i want to be, but a daily reminder of who i want to be. I intend on elevating my life from now on until i can find some inner peace with myself and the world. I want to make myself strong... for myself and yes, for Haneen. I really feel now more than ever that i will be leaving Springfield one day after my bachelor's to be closer to her, possibly houston to get my masters. I hope this scares her not, but its the truth. Life is way to short. Ive wasted enough time, and here's my shot at facing up to the reality that i want to live.   Jason

            I Know it sounds like some kind of stupid AOL upgrade or something doesnt it??! Well get ready. Ready for what you may ask.... hell i dont really know myself, i just know its been a LONG time coming.        At LEAST a month now, ive been a complete train wreck. Always worrying, always down, tired, crying, depressed, irritable, ashamed of my mistakes, nostalgic, and just plain out bitchy and not myself. The unknown hit me really hard throughout the transition from Barnes and St Louis to here. It all happened so fast, such a surprise and i really was just not ready for it. I HAVE known for a LONG time the 2 following things....follow carefully also please....       My life has been on the verge of just blowing up into something extraordinary, amazing even. Ive had dreams, visions, and thoughts of how i KNOW i can become this person ive always wanted to be.       To accomplish this, i have to royally "clean out my closet" of people, places, and perhaps lifestyle practices that put me in the state of mind where i really dont need to be. I have to shout out some "friends"(so they call themselves) , shut away instances in my life that have brought me down and most of all, Banish the demons that forever linger to haunt me.   "Bring into the light..... EVERYTHING that you fear "     Conversion Software 7.0      Well, my changes in order to live, love and become Jason are no secret to me at all....why?? Because this situation is nothing new to me...September of 2002 ring a bell to anyone? I left EVERYTHING to become me. WOW, the greatest day of my life was the day the red mustang blazed interstate 90 into the great northwest and ported me into the person i am now.       Dont worry, im not gonna do anything crazy like that again. Im not going to leave everything behind and sundance my life for the next couple of years. I am not starting life over as i did in 2002, i am merely "upgrading" myself. I'm going to do this by the ever so ancient theory of balancing the mind, body, and spirit. If my journey succeeds say, a year from now, my life will forever revolve around the 3 pillars in which i intend to balance.     BUT.... Before we get to the mind, body, spirit.... Remember the #2 up there that i told you all to pay attention to? The so called "cleaning out my closet?" Guess what.... it started today when i woke up at 3 oclock. If you have dragged me down, chances are you just got served, asshole. If you have lied, used, or just plain out got on my god damn nerves it was sooooo nice (not really) knowing you. If you have held me back from thinking other than the truth, if you have bestowed negativity on me, if your drama has spilled over into my path of clear thinking....you poor soul for you have OFFICIALLY been voted off of Jason Island!! (thanks for the cute saying Jennifer, love ya babe ;p )  If you are sitting here reading this right now wondering "am i on that list" chances are you are.... so FUCK OFF and FUCK YOU :)   Ok, now that thats taken care of..... we will get to mind, body, spirit in my next installment. I have things to do before work and just cant get to it now............ It will contain plans, some which are already in affect, to future plans, practices, activities, and such of what im gonna be doin here in Springfield. It will be jam packed with goodness just like this one was =O       Oh... i forgot, to the Jason's Blog groupie who asked me to marry them... sorry but me and Haneen had a wonderful weekend in Houston so you must wait yet another day for our relationship to falter.... and good luck with that because i love her more and more and more as each day passes..... crazy isnt it how we survive such weird constraints.   Jason

      My poor monkey.... my exhausted hampster, my racked brain.... i owe it all to a simple phrase/abbreviation/state of mind known as WTF!!?!?!?  As those who are loyal to my blog know, i like to use definitions.... usually from the dictionary. Well unfortunantly there is no WTF??!! in the dictionary so heres my version. Hope it helps.....  WTF :  "dub hya Teeee Efff" 1. The state of mind whereas the train of thought is suddenly halted due to overload of information or amazement.  2. Short for WHAT THE FUCK??!!  3. Often categorized by the halt of the constant running of the hampster in Jason's mind -OR- the sudden scratching of the imaginary monkey's head and or picking of a vittle from it to eat.   Haneen knows the look on my face when the WTF??!! syndrome hits me.... she knows it all too well. I get it often, perhaps more than i would like to admit :) Just know, all of you out there with monkies with itchy heads, that you are not alone. The state of DUB HYA TEEEEE EFFFF??!! Hits us all at one point, no matter how smart, intellectual, or really plain out stupid you are.   Jason

      I would just absolutely love to give a huge shout out to the House of Pie in Houston Texas for their wonderful Lemon Ice Box Cream pie.... that and Haneen brought moments of bliss to me this weekend without even trying. The coffee was good, the pie was so good it would make ya slap yo momma, and just because its pie doesnt mean you cant order sausage and hash browns with it?!!!?! GOT IT?? :) To see for yourself the enjoyment i am having, feel free to observe the pic above :D  Jason

      For someone who has been nothing but an emotional wreck lately, i sure had some sphere pulsing moments :)  The sphere pulses when something really awesome SUDDENLY overwhelms me.... When i feel the urge spur of the moment to do something extraordinary, and what not......  I was pretty much convinced this weekend was gonna suck when i became really congested and sick right before my interview and afterwards. I stayed at Michelle's , got some meds, and hooked up with Heather sunday. We went down to the loop and suddenly we were just walking and laughing etc and the sphere pulsed amongst the hackey sack kickin, no arm pit shaving hippie chicks..... i took notice deep inside of me to see what on earth was luring me to keen my senses when the bongos hit me. At least 6-7 people and their drums were hammerin away an awesome array of music that i really just had to join in. A stoner who seemed really lost with the rythym (not lost IN , but WITH ) volunteered his drum to me and away i went. I really think Heather was amazed at me as i sat their in my new sunglasses bangin away some awesome soundage with the group who took sudden pleasure to the sounds coming from my corner. I played for a good 20 minutes with them before getting up to walk around more. The way i felt in the music.... i was lost IN the music (not WITH).... i felt free.... i felt alive.... and i felt expressive. It was really fun.      Alrighty, so the sphere is glowing now. Im in a good mood when Special Ed proclaims "Ive got mail YAYYYYYYYYYYYY!"     The sphere pulses once more as i knew what the message was gonna be (or at least who it was from) before i read it...... "plane just landed, ill call you when my phone gets charged"  Haneen was home..... i translated "plane just landed, will call when im not around everyone :-p" But nevertheless, shes home. My precious Haneen, bringer of hope, comfort, nuturement, peace, and desire to my heart.... is home.  Less than 2 weeks until i see her again as well :)     So im burning CDs at Heather's house that night, we decide why not, lets go to 6 flags Monday. Im there, on the roller coaster called "the Boss" which is their best coaster in my opinion when the light flickers from the camera and instantly the sphere pulses again with some instant crazy idea lingering in my head...... we jump back on the coaster and as its going up the hill, i whip out my..... cell phone???!  Screaming girls in the cart behind us start laughing their asses off when (with my sunglasses on) i turn around, phone to my ear, and say "Yall quiet down, im on the phone!!"..... yes, right at the top of the hill, right before the coaster made its initial descent gaining lots of speed. I located the camera once more and held the phone to my ear and as straight as i could sit, tried to look as normal as possible.  The picture was PERFECT. Peoples arms up, screaming, yelling, covering their faces, and some strange guy sitting there looking normal having a phone conversation....... I know it sounds rather dull, but remember Jack Handey???  " If i were a cowboy and i was dragging someone on a rope behind my horse, it would make me mad to look back and see him reading a magazine!!" Thats the kinda humor i was going for and it was awesome.  Anyhow, UAB called today..... i have the job if i want it. I have to have them an answer by the end of the week.......  Notice i tried to skip right on through that.... yeah thats because i know not what the hell to do with that situation.  SO anyhow, overall i had a great weekend thanks to the ever so sweet Heather Beth. She burned me like 10000000000 CDs and even let me use her John Mayer pillow when i went to sleep the other night. (god im soooo tired of hearing john mayer and Jason Mraz). A few pics of us are enclosed and i hope ya like them.  My weekend had other high and low points but hell its 530 in the morning and franklly i just cant think of them right now.  Jason

      Ok, me and Jennifer (OH MY GOD I HATE JASON ROGERS!!!!) have this ongoing debate ALL the time if different celebrities i look like. She has told me throughout the years of knowing her i resemble 4-5 different ones. Among the ones shes named, matt damon (i dont think so). I know i look nothing like him at all. I wish i did but oh well. There was once this show called meet my dad or marry my dad or something like that and one of the contestants she SWORE  looked just like me but i didnt think so either. I watched it at her house that night and saw no resemblence. He had some weird name like Jean de Carlo or some shit like that......     Ok, so anyhow, me and my friend Heather get the wild hair to make me a Burnt Corn Alabama shirt today since the local Old Navy doesnt carry them ya know..... well we make one (i farted in the crafts store and some poor pregnant woman had to endulge ) and i put it on along with my 4 dollar sunglasses i bought at the loop the other day. She takes a picture and upon concurring with Jennifer.......we have found a celebrity in which we can agree i look alike.  Johnny Knoxville.  Although i know i do not look like him.....at all..... for some strange reason i think i look alot like him in this pic. I will post for your viewing pleasure. Hope ya like the burnt corn shirt as well. It took alot of patience making that tonight :-p  Jason

      Well...... I just got off work, im gonna get some sleep, get rested up for my night at work tonight and my ride to St Louis in the morning. Im gonna sleep on Michelle's couch for about 4 hours and then catch my flight to Providence........  Yes, Providence Rhode Island..... Yes the job i turned down to come here to /smirk Springfield Missery, shit.... i mean Missouri.  They were extremely happy to see i was still interested in the job as was i to see it was still open, i havent heard from UAB yet, so what the hell. Better get that back up plan rolling in case ya know. My interview is Friday and im excited. Im really happy to travel to the East coast for once and i really think the interview will go well. I do know that after many conversations with the department head there, UAB better get their asses in gear because they have lost MAJOR ground with their drag assing around.  I will be back saturday to Saint Louis. I might go to the game if i can find someone to go with. I will still have 3 days off so no tellin what ill do on my off days. Maybe even work to get some overtime to start covering moving expenses to Providence ;)  Jason

      Just a quick note to vent my frustration that Nomar Garciaparra is no longer on the Boston Red Sox  I really liked him, hes on the Cubs now which isnt that bad, but he was sooo awesome in Boston. Oh well, to each his own, but i really dont think he shouldve left Boston.  Jason

      The one thing i havent done enough of all of my life is read...... ive maybe read 10 books the past 2-3 years when all of a sudden BANG i am reading 2 as we speak, have 3 more waiting to read. I didnt wanna get into them until i get the 2 down......  So, the first book is called Internal Bleeding. Its based on the epidemic of poor health care. Its gotta lotta stories on people who has the wrong leg operated on, wrong prescription given to them, etc. Its really interesting and sorta scary how easily things fall through the cracks even as a health care provider.  Second is Dojo Wisdom : finding your inner warrior. Its ok.... not exactly what i was expecting. It does give good ideas of dealing with daily life, people, stress, situations, etc. Its not bad but i wouldnt call it great. Alot of the recommendations are sorta shady and based on her vast study of Tae Kwon Do (which is Korean, not Japanese.... and above all NOT CHINESE KUNG FU :-p ) Her levels of concentration arent well displayed as much as i would hope, maybe because i feel mine is way up there compared to some peoples.  Anyhow, thats just a summary. Im not given some book review or anything, just suggestions if ya wanna get a good book or two to read. I have 2 books on Lance Armstrong and one more book that i cant wait to get into...... look at me.... Jason.... reading??!!  Jason

      Ok, so theres these 2 women at work that are so sweet. I work with them every weekend that i work and a few days during the week but not often. They look like sisters but they arent kin at all. They are the same age (mid 30s) and both have kids etc.  They both are so nice, really kind, religious, and overall very good people to work with. I have this problem though.... when im with them i often find myself joining in on their conversations and some of the things that come out of my mouth lately have made us all laugh like hell. One of the ladies has 3 kids, one does mary kay, avon, whatever the hell it is, one breast pumps her milk or whatever the fuck thats called and overall they are your prototype MOMs. They talk about arts and crafts, church, babies, things babies do, other peoples babies, and all kinda mom talk. They make beaded bracelets, exchange recipes, look at pottery barn magazines together, and just totally fill the role of Mothers well im sure.  Well they have rubbed off on me..... badly.  I have found myself in their conversations talking about what product exfoliates better, which SPF is best for the baby, which salad dressing is better tasting, and of all things...... Yes... I, Jason Rogers, made a little beaded bracelet last night. They were laughing that here i was, in the mix of these moms, making a beaded bracelet with their kits.... yes, kits. They have bead kits they get at hobby lobby. These girls are great. Ill miss them when im gone. They both have lucky husbands and children for they are virtuous women and even the non religious Jason knows that the bible says what a treasure a virtuous woman is. I even held one of the ladies's baby (youngest one) at a staff meeting the other night. So sweet...... ok i need sleep and or therapy/medication / caffeine :-p  Jason

      UGH why wont UAB  call me damnet?!?!!!  So the update is this..... im hired as of today IF my background checks out OK. Im not sure what that consist of, but thats what im waiting on. Im not sure if thats like criminal background or past employers or both or what :( I cant get over the fact that i could lose this oppurtunity becasue of a certain past employer and criminal record (hey she SAID she was 18...... just kidding :-p ) SO anyhow, the people in CT are done with me saying i am hired IF only HR checks out. Did i mention i HATE HR after my situation in St Louis???? :-(  Anyhow, thats the deal..... thats the update, not to fabulous but oh well. Thats whats going on with me. I really dont care what happens as long as i raise up outta here and fast.  I cant take this place much longer. Springfield is ok, the hospital is not :(  I miss my girlfriend, shes far far away..... that is all i really wanna say about that right now without being all emotional and sad and stuff. I call her voicemail and leave messages just so i can hear HI YOU HAVE REACHED HANEEN!!  Jason
