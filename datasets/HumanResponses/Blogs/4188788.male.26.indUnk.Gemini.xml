           This is a question often asked of me as a Filipino. Perhaps I have answered Yes half of the time and No for the other half. You see, this question really bothers me. But my changing answer bothers me even more, for it speaks of uncertainty, confusion even...  While I do not profess to understand Philippine politics and economics, I have a clear grasp of the realities surrounding me. And the bitter truth is, these realities are so fragile that they can disappear like will-o-wasp, or a new completely contradictory to the previous reality emerges from nowhere. To be more particular, I can cite business conditions and peace and order in the country. Many times since the 1986 Edsa revolution, the "light" of redemption was seen in the Philippines. There were talks of a growing tiger economy in Southeast Asia, referring to the Philippines. We read about business booms, we have the first build-operate and transfer law, increase in our exports. But suddenly, the sky darkens and all there is are lightning and thunder vanishing the full moon and smiling stars. We see massive unemployment, anti-economy decisions of the Supreme Court, emigrating capital, gloomy business mood. On peace and order, other than the usual street crimes, the Philippines remain a peaceful nation... and boom! The Abu Sayyaf kidnaps and terrorizes again, a village is pillaged, soldiers become politicians and perform idiotic theatrical acts, uprising in Mindanao, NPAs clash with soldiers. The only thing that appears to be constant is the growing malady of graft and corruption. During Marcos' time, he was the biggest corrupt official and nothing funny happens without him knowing it, or else the officials responsible will be thrown to jail or to hell, depending on the mood of the Marcos military boys. But now, every little tom, dick and harry is a corrupt official. Down to the lowest elective official, the Barangay kagawad, and the lowest appointive officials like government clerks and messengers, corruption is rampant! Everybody is out to do monkey business on his own. Show me one single totally honest Philippine government employee and I will give you the finger.  I consider my friends who have already left the Philippines to work abroad as lucky. To my friends who are planning to leave, I tell them to hurry. But when they ask me why I am still here, I cannot give a clear answer. While outward I tell them that there is no hope, a part of me refuses to acknowledge the fact. Deep inside, something is shouting at me, telling me that yes, there is hope, yes, don't give up. And somehow this voice tampered my fatalistic replies; I now realize and ask the question, where does the salvation of our country lie? Of course, our redemption lies within ourselves! If the Filipinos can mess up the Philippines to this unthinkable level, surely we have the talent to build it up! Bringing the country this low requires genius and perseverance, only a few other peoples managed to destroy their countries worse than we have. If we channel our ingenuity and talent to rebuilding the first republic in Asia, surely we will succeed, eh? And we can start our rebirth as a nation by saying out loud, that yes, there is hope for the Philippines!

        I love simplicity, there is beauty hidden behind its blank wall facade. Tranquility resides in its embrace... peace thrives in its bosom.

              Cen Cen   (A Father’s Letter) as published in The Philippine Star Fathers' Day Issue    As I watch you sleep, I can’t help but smile. A proud father to such a sweet angel. You got your lips and chin from your mom, but your black eyes and nose are definitely mine. I run my fingers through your hair and gently kiss you goodnight. We didn’t get to the part where Sleeping Beauty finally meets her prince charming, you slept early tonight. But perhaps tomorrow we will. For now, be calm in your slumber.    In the eyes of the world you are but an innocent five-year old child, but to me, my daughter, you are the whole world, and much, much more. In your innocence I find my peace, in your laughter I find my strength, in your tears- courage. You will not at this time comprehend why I stare at you while you play, or why I wake in the night and kiss you in your sleep. But soon, Cen Cen, I hope that you will.    You are my daughter, my only child, wrought from my own flesh and blood, molded in the wombs of your loving mother. My first letter to you was written minutes before you were born. It bears my joy for your coming, my fear for your health, and my prayers to God pleading to Him to bless and safe-keep you. It is now an item among the many pictures of your growing up: first smile, first step, first birthday. I look at them when you are not around and wonder at how fast you have grown up and how beautiful you have become.    Sometimes I wish that you would forever remain a child. In that way you will not lose your innocence and you will continue to ask me why the sky is blue and the grass are green. Or where the dewdrops in your glass windowpane come from every morning. And perhaps the world will never be a problem to you because your daddy will always be there to carry you. You will not be in need, Daddy will get your milk and bring your toys. You will never get hurt, Daddy will catch your fall. Daddy will take care of you.    But I cannot wait to see you grow up and watch you make your mark. Young as you are, I can see your brilliance and passion for knowledge and the arts. Perhaps you will be a doctor, or maybe a philosopher like your mom, for you are both keen on learning and profound in reasoning. You vanish the strain of a full day’s work with your newly-learned rhymes, you brighten the day with your new dance steps, and you make your mom laugh with the lines and theme songs you saw on TV. Hmmm… maybe my daughter will be a movie star? What joy is it for a father to see his daughter shine!    While I fear that the world may sometimes be harsh on you I know that your intuition and my prayers to God will carry you through. I can remember when you were just beginning to walk and you wouldn’t let me hold your hand because you knew you could do it. Trust yourself. You played wonderfully in your piano rehearsal and you got a standing ovation while me and your mom were nervously watching in the back. You are great. During your first day in school, you were apprehensive, but after a few hours, you were happily singing with your new friends. You are ready.    When you grow up, perhaps you will wonder, how much does my daddy love me? I love you with all my life and when you read this letter I want you to remember that. You and your mom are the best things that ever happened to me. I have not always been an ideal husband and father, for this forgive me. But in the moments that I have failed you, I failed myself, too. For if there is a mission in my life where I give my best, that is in trying to bring you happiness. For my frailty, please bear with me; for my love for you, please believe me. At this point in my life, I desire not to be known to you as a great lawyer, nor as a leader of men, but as a great father. For what glory would it be for me to have been great in the eyes of other people but found wanting in the eyes of my own family?    I wish to write you, my daughter, a longer letter. But my head is hurting me again. It has become worse this past few days, and the medicines can’t seem to lessen the pain like they used to just a couple of months ago. I am trying keep it to myself, I hope that I don’t make a sound, for I might disturb your slumber. Daddy will be leaving you soon Cen Cen, and I know that the time is near. Daddy is sick, baby, and God will be taking him to be with His angels in heaven. But from there, I will not stop loving you, from up above I will be watching and caring for you. I will be waiting constantly to hold you again, to touch your face. And my soul will be crying for a communion with you, for another chance to embrace you. Please remember me, Cen Cen…     Armand R.
