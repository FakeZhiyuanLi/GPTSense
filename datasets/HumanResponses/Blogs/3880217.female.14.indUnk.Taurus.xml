      So after recieving a hurtful e-mail from him, I've let him go, we could never be together, and after that I don't want to be with him, but now theres this other guy, and i'm afraid i'm going to hurt him, but the best thing I can do is push him away, its the only thing I know how to do,

      So I love him,&nbsp; but he doesn't care about me, how can I have such strong feelings for someone that doesn't even care about me?&nbsp;How can I be so foucused on being with him, and only him? If I flirt with someone I feel like&nbsp;I'm cheating on him, I feel guilty, and I don't want to feel like&nbsp;that, how come I'm the one left with all the memories of how it used to be, when we were friends, when we were a couple, but were nothing but memories now, but you don't remember me, because if you did then, you'd remember that I love you,&nbsp;but you'll never know now, because your in love with someone else,&nbsp;and I want you to be happy more then anything, even if I'm not happy, but that's just the role I get, I get to watch everyone else be happy, while I sit here and pitty myself for fucking up so bad that he would leave me, but whatever, what can I do?&nbsp;absolutley nothing, were over but I can't forget him, everything is a constant reminder of him, of how I love him, of what I lost when I lost him. So there's the confused&nbsp;part, and now the bitter part, I can't believe anyone, I think everyone's lying to me, and they probably are, wait bitter, hmm.... that sounds more paronoid then bitter, but trust me I'm very bitter, towards everyone, anyone that tries to get to&nbsp;close, I'm, just afraid they'll leave, and I'll have to go through this all over again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Okay I'm trying so hard to get over him but I'm not getting anywhere, I think i'm letting go and then something or someone will remind me of him, and I can't help but think of how I felt about him. A friend of mine says the reason I can't let go of him is because I don't have closure, and I won't be able to get over him, or heal from this, unless I have closure. But I don't know how to get closure, what should I do? So here's the other thing now there's this other guy that says he likes me, but nothing can happen. I'm stuck I can't get over him, my heart can't let go of his memories, we did almost everything together, I can't let go of all those memories, I don't know what to do.

      When I see the way he acts around other girls specifically Jackie he's new girl friend and Jessica he's ex girlfriend, I see how much he really cares about them and how I must have meant absolutely nothing to him, even though he meant everything to me, he was my whole world, everything that I wanted, I spent all my time trying to prove to him that I was there and that I would be perfect for him, but apparently I wasn't good enough, and I wasn't worth the trouble, he said he didn't want to lie to his Mom, but whenever I talk to her she says that she has liked me better then anyone else he's been with. I love his family so much, I consider them an extension of my own, not being around them since the split has been hard for me, I miss them, they were always so great to me, and they always say that they love me, his family loves me more then he ever did, but then again I have never believed that he loved me. I wanted to believe that's he loved me but when he first said it I should have called him on it instead of believing him, but I can't change the past, but if I could, things would be different, very different.

      I don't know why I have all these memories of him its so annoying, sometimes I want to think about him, but sometimes I don't, but truth is i'm constantly thinking about him. I need to let go of him, I know that, and I thought I was getting over him, but then Silver called him last night and it reminded me of how things used to be, and of my feelings that I haven't let go of. The saddest thing is sometimes I wish we had never been together, so we could still be friends, I miss being able to talk to him, so I not only lost the guy i'm in love with, but i lost my besat friend as well :'(

      so know i'm bitching about how complicated life is and i've only scratched the tip of the iceberg, i'm just confused about guys right now, and there's still a bunch of crap i have to think about, like, school, my future when i come to think about it my future is all i really control, what i want to be, the person that i become, my goal for this year is going to be to keep my gpa at 4.0 and complete 2 years of high school in 1 so i can hopefully go to a junior college and get out of the house as soon as possible hopefully with a scolarship, in whatever i'm deciding on as my future. I haven't had any work crap thats a whole diferent mess of drama. So i'm pretty good off for now i let you know if things change

      List's suck, I'm on a list, its crappy, I like this guy, but there is another girl on his list, I don't know why I even bother with this, I think I'll just give up on him, now i'm starting think about this more and the more I think about it, the more its eating me up inside, and the more I question, what's so wrong with me that I can't be alone on a list, obviously there's something missing form me, that makes me just not good enough, for someone to like me, and only me. So right about now I'm feelin' pretty shity, but hopefully something will happen to make me feel better, the only thing that would make me feel better right now is for my face to stop fucking swelling, and something to eat. damn I'm hungry. well as they say theres always hope that tomorrow will be better, but i don't see that happening.
