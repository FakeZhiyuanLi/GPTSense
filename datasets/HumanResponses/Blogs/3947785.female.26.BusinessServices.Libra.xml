      So Josh went to visit his parents this weekend...  having him GONE for a little over 24 hours was AWFUL.  I didn't sleep, I did nothing but eat, I got sick as a dog I even developed a very year urinary tract infection....  because I was stressed out that he was gone....  He comes back, and tells me that he has an opportunity to work less hours, and make just as much money.   He wants me to move to Mesa with him.  He even went so far as to tell me that when we have been together long enough, eventually I will become his wife.    I want this move.  I want a fresh life in a fresh town, a fresh start.  But I am terrified to leave my current job.  My boss counts on me, and I adore him.  He's like family.  I don't want to go.  I know leaving this job is burning a bridge behind me...  I'll never be able to come back to work here.    I am writing up my resume, and getting ready to start looking for work in Mesa/Tempe/ Phoenix area.  Damn this is scary.  I've been sheltered my whole life.  I'm putting everything on the line for Josh... and I dont even have the commitment I said I would require.

      Well, Saturday I woke up at 7am, and I sat and watched cartoons with the kids.  Josh woke up around 11am, and we spent the day being lazy... it was nice. I needed it.  Then Saturday evevening we went out driving in the rain.  Josh wants a tattoo, so we stopped by Old Towne tattoo to look at the flash.  Josh found a tat he likes, but it's $200.00 a pop.. and he wants one on each arm.  So we're looking at $400.00, so Josh can look like abig tough biker with tattoos on his arms.  To be honest, I love the fact that he isn't all tattooed up, I can show him off without having to explain...  but they are his arms, his skin...  his tattoos...  I'll back him no matter how much I dont like it. We stopped and got some movies..  Lord of the Flies, because I had never seen it and Josh felt it was an icon of our generation, The Tommyknockers because I have to have my horror flick, and Jackass the movie... because Josh thinks that stuidity is funny. (It's not)  We got home at like 11pm, and stayed up and watched Jackass, whichis alot funnier after a couple shots of Don Julio tequila (The best Tequila in the world) and a benedryl, then we tried to stay up and watch The TommyKnockesrs...  but I was just too out of it... I HAD to go to bed.  Sunday morning, 7am...  my son, Alan starts crying.  I go into his room just in time to watch him throw up all over his bed.  I get him up, bathe him, clean up his bed, throw out his pillow (it was already in bad shape), and get him and his sister sat down watching cartoons.  I try to stay up with them.. but end up falling back asleep.  Josh got up, took care fo the kids, and made breakfast. (What a GREAT man).  I wake up at like 11am, and we lounge around until Debi (My ex-husband's mom) came to pick up Ravyn (my daughter) for the weekend.  Once Ravyn was gone, we got dressed and hopped in the car and went to Tanque Verde Falls....  which was a stagnant, disgusting puddle instead of the beautiful falls we were expecting after all our recent rain.  we hiked around for a while, and it was beautiful despite the lack of water.  But my legs felt like they were on fire!  I dont know if I have a minor tanning salon burn, and that the sun was making it worse, or if it is a symptom of the Psoriasis...  but I was miserable.   I wanted to go home and slather a ton of lotion on my legs, but Josh was already upset with me for being unhappy that there was no water.. so I toughed it out.  Ended up haing a lot of fun despite myself. I adore Josh.  He gave up everything to come to Tucson to be with me.   That said... I fear that we may be torn apart.  Josh just wants to go home to Mesa, Az....  I am set up to be self sufficient here in Tucson, AZ.  If I give up my job and my apartment and I move to Mesa, I will never find work for what I make here ...  I'm an uneducated highschool drop out.  I'm LUCKY to make 430.00 a week before taxes.  ...  I'm scared to pick up and move and lose my security...  for a boyfriend.  It would be different for a husband...  but Josh wont commit to me that way.  I know he loves me, he takes excellent care of me.  But I don't want to move to Mesa, and then have him just walk out on me.  I want to know that if I move to Mesa, he's not going anywhere.   Well, boss just stuck his head in my office, I need to work on billing today.  UGH!

      Well, this is my first attempt at a blog.&nbsp; I have a ton to say about myself.&nbsp; I am 26 years old, a mother of two, and have a WONDERFUL boyfriend named Josh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was divorced almost a year ago, and I am wondering what to do to celebrate my freedom on August 12th.&nbsp;  On May 4th 2004 I was diagnosed with Psoriasis.&nbsp; This rotten disease has shaken up my life but lucky for me it's just a mild auto immune disorder...&nbsp; I have some flaky dry red spots on my skin, and some minor arthritis in my fingers and back, but right now it's not that big of a deal. You will find as you read my blog that my moods and thoughts change faster than even I can keep track of.&nbsp; Enjoy the ride!

      Ok..  so it started last night. I went and got my mail, it was sunday, and I knew I had a couple days mail in there to look over.  I find two letters, the first one I open is from MotorVehicle Department...  They cancelled my registration because they had no proof of insurance on record.  The second one I opened was a letter telling me that the eletric company was going to turn off my power because they had found three past due balances, totalling $600.00 plus they wanted a $200.00 deposit.  Where was I supposed to come up with $800.00? So this morning, I go to MVD, I show them i HAVE insurance....  then I go pay my phone bill, and go to my insurance company and re-up for another month.  Then I come back to work.  At lunch I start battle with the electric company.  I call them, and I talk to customer service.  I am told that they will have a "supervisor" call me back, well I'm trying to do this on my lunch break, so that wont do... I tell them I'll hold.  They hang up on me.  So I call back again, and I am told that a supervisor will call me back, I tell her I'll hold, she hangs up on me again (different girl)... so I call back again, finally I get a girl who finds me a person from the accounting department (someone with a brain... finally!) and I talk to her.  She tells me she can ignore two of the past due balances, as they are my ex-husbands, but that I need to pay them $235.30 PLUS a $200.00 deposit...  This still won't do.  So I ask if HER supervisor can talk to me.. once again I am told a supervisor will call me back.  At this point I have been on the phone for almost 2 hours, and am emotionally exhausted, so I agree, I'll wait for the supervisor to call.  Another hour or so goes by, I get a call from the supervisor, she tells me that I am responsible for ALL the debts, as a divorce is public record, and she looked me up.  She starts reading from the public record... I'm not divorced. (even sounds that way to me!)....  I have such a coniption fit over it, that she finally tells me to pay ONE of the three past due bills, and she will waive the deposit...  I agree and hang up the phone and pick it right back up again to call my divorce lawyer.  Mr. Victor Scwenbeck of Scwanbeck and Present in Tucson, AZ - 520-325-1800....  the man is a GOD I tell you.. a GOD...  if you need a divorce in Tucson, go to Mr. Schwanbeck.  He's not the cheapest, but he's one of the best.  Anyway, He is sending me a copy of my divorce decree.  I'll need it later to get my daughter into school anyway.  All this even though I still owe the man money.  It was a productive day, and I got my way...  everything worked out ok...  but it was stressful and hectic... and the worst part was when I thought I wasnt divorced... !

      Ok...  Last night I was at my mom's house and telling her about the upcoming move to Mesa.  She says my dad has a co worker who's wife works in the Phoenix metropolitan area teaching rich gringos to ride horses.  She thinks I can get in there as a trainer.  That would be AWESOME.  To get out of an office and back with horses would be a dream come true. I am starting to get excited about the move.  It won't be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is easy.  We are still looking for a place to live, we would prefer a house, but it looks like more apartment life up there.  Hopefully we can at least get a downstairs apartment.  I hate stairs.  This morning Josh brought me a second millipede.  My first one (herbie) hates the second one (kirby) ...  Luckily Kirby is the larger and more placid of the two, so I don't think either one will get hurt. I gave official notice to my boss yesterday, one month's notice.  He is going to promote Sheila, our telemarketer to office manager.  I have a month to train her.  I hope she can do it.  To be honest I have my doubts.  But I am a total control freak, and I sincerely belief that no one can do this job as well as I do.  But Sheila has been here for well over a year, she is loyal, hard working, honest, and she like my boss, is Jewish.  I think if she can master the computer, she'll be ok. Well, it's time to start my work day.  Still trying to learn a new program for my boss, so I can teach it to Sheila.....  And it is NOT user friendly!  Cat

       Today I came to work and broke the news to my boss.  I am planning to move.   Married or not, there is a shortage of good men in this world, and I am not about to let Josh get away.  I find a man who adores me as much as I adore him....  and that was pure luck.  I can find another job, especially if my boss writes the letter of recommendation that he told me today he would write.   So the first step has been taken...  Now, I need to sit down with Josh and work out details.   The only bad part of this is Alan is going to start school here in Tucson, and then in a month or two, he will be relocated to a new school.  He's strong and smart ...  and young... and it is for the ultimate stability in the long run.   I love my ex-husband's mother, Debi.  She is a wonderfu person who lives for my daughter.  Debi thinks Ravyn is the best thing since sliced bread.  I'm afraid moving will really hurt Debi, but she has to understand that Grandma's arnt everyday, and that Ravyn and Alan got dealt a bum hand when it came to a father... but Josh is willing to pick up where Jamie didnt bother to even try, and Daddy's are everyday. I know that Debi will cry, and be sad, but it's only 120 miles. She will still see Ravyn a LOT, and it's for the best.  Wish me luck!
