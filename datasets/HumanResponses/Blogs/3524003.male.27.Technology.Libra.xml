      Wednesday....my BRO drove me to MRT in the morning again. THANKS!!! Dreaded to go to work now..thinking about the user's problem is enough to make my spirits real low...Nothing much happen during the work hours, still cant resolve the user's problem...Went for classes after work, but it ended early, so I guess it wasnt that bad. Besides, my BRO came and fetch me... He's going to parkway to play pool, so I went with him. Just then, I thought of my dear,and asked her if she wants a ride back home. She said okie, so I dropped my BRO and drove to novena to pick her up.Once I picked her up, I had the most fun and enjoyable car ride with her.. Think I'm really missing her alot...Went to Bedok for makan,and send her home. Went to Parkway, played a few rounds of pool and went home...Long day for me....

      Guess who gave me a morning surprise?? MY BRO!!!! Finally arrive in Singapore!!He will be around till July 10..hope that is enough time for us to do some catching up. He also offered to give me a lift the MRT in the morning, thats nice of him. I was thinking to myself that it was going to be a good day. Little did I know...that the worst thing that could happen ,has happen. I went to look for the user to carry on with her problem. When I tried to resolve it, I realised something amiss...and it turns out that her system is a complete mess. I managed to solve her initial problem, but now it has recreated a whole new of problems. It was so bad that she demand to look for a senior engineer to assist her. I had no choice but to inform my site lead about the matter. That incident was enough to ruined my entire day. I was feeling so so low..being a newbie at the job and caused so much problem for my site lead...Plus, I was not going to meet my dear after work, which I felt that I really needed her. And then, a miracle happen. My dear called, and ask me for dinner!! My spirits were lifted greatly. We met for dinner at Maina Square and had a very delicious dinner.And again, my dear paid for it. Next time, it will be my turn, okie?? We took the train and went home... wanted so much for her to come to my place and spend more time, but...is okie. I got my wish came true, meeting her when I needed her the most...

      It has been awhile since my last entry, so I thought it would be nice to update all you folks out there about my on-going existence...Monday, went on with my daily life, when I got to attend to this user's problem. It took 1 full day to settle the problem.. but little do I know that it is the beginning of a horrible week for me...will get to that later. After my work, got to go back to my old work place and fetch my dear from work. And we headed down to Great World for dinner,as well as 'MOD' the X-box, cos my BRO will be returning the next day. And my dear was so kind enough to pay for it 1st!! *Muaks* *muaks* to you. We also had company, one of our good friend to join us for dinner. My dear paid for dinner too!! DOUBLE *muaks* *muaks*. After all that is said and done, we all went home and had a rest...so much for this day...
