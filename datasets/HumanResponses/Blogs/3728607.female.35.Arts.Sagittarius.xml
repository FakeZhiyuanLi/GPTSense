      Well, it looks like POSTCARDS will be released about Mid-August, barring any unforseen complications. In preparation for its release, we've got some preliminary  urlLink POSTCARDS stuff at CafePress  (things like notecards, t-shirts, mugs, that sort of stuff). You can also send an  urlLink e-card here .

      The new book cover is up! It's exciting to see what Donette did with it.  urlLink You can see it here (click) . It's quite a bit different than I envisioned, but I think it goes nicely with the premise of this book. I love the way she did the lettering, and how wispy the girl looks. All in all, I really like the effect. Sometimes, an objective eye really does the trick...going in directions I wouldn't have even tired. Donette is really wonderful with covers, in general. I hope others will like it, too.

      This is just a place to put a few notes about the progress of my new book. This is a handy spot for that. My personal journal is at  urlLink www.celaine.com , but that requires a membership registration.

      Wow. Had I not read    urlLink this post  at 2River,  I would never have known the significance of having an Alexa site rating of  urlLink 940,405 . I mean, that looks like a pretty dismal number. In fact, it would seem that there are  urlLink roughly 43,000,000 web sites   out there, which would make  urlLink www.celaine.com  in the top 2%. Pretty unreal.

      The conceit—letters and notes, scribblings found in a box and read randomly. There is no backstory and no explanation, they are anonymous and yet eerily familiar. The imagery is at once fresh and comfortable but not cliché or worn. The poems reverberate with the truth of the ocean; the sounds of the street mixed with soft whispers of secrets never before told. This anonymous woman unfolds, a lotus dipped in rain; she is wanton, an origami pressed open. You find yourself turning each page with anticipation, hoping that more of her will be revealed and you find that the more that is revealed the only thing you really know for sure is you do not want this story to end. (The full review is available on the Postcards page)

      Postcards from a Summer Girl is full of tight, exact poems punctuated by precise images. I place an empty glass/ upon drywall, but I can't/ listen to vacancy. Christine Laine's voice--startling in both breath and intimacy--is a voice worth listening to.   - Suzanne Frischkorn

       A review of    Postcards From A             Summer Girl  &nbsp;                by: Michael Paul Ladanyi (poet, author and editor )             &nbsp;                When I first began reading C. E.             Laine's  Postcards From A Summer Girl,  (Sun             Rising Poetry Press, Fall 2004) I realized that these             were poems of reality, truth and honesty. As I read             further, I found the language to be&nbsp;original,             the images hard-edged, soft and stark at the same             time, wrapped in layers of life's sound bites and             color. &nbsp;                From the poem  intensive care,             room 63 , the line, &quot;now bruised by light             and cigarette smoke,&quot; blends very well with the             colors of this piece, purple, blue, black and green.             As a reader, I felt these colors, their images more             vivid even than the subject of this poem. They are             the colors of bruises healing, though the color             yellow was not used, the last stage before a bruise             fully heals. I believe this was intentional, as             I&nbsp;feel the poet&nbsp;knows some wounds never             heal.&nbsp; &nbsp;                In the poem  Hush! , the             image&nbsp;of a white room&nbsp;defines starkness, as             the first few words of this piece define the poet's             stark memory of herself, or perhaps&nbsp;this is an             current evaluation.&nbsp;&quot;This is no photograph.             I am never that still.&quot; With these lines, Ms.             Laine defines&nbsp;who she is, as if looking into a             mirror, comfortable and honest with what she sees.             &nbsp;                From the poem,  The umbra of a             four letter word , the reference to Sylvia             Plath's poem, Elm, melds well with the feelings we             live with after a lover has gone. The line &quot;I             have no roots, now,&quot; struck me as honest             humility, something one must say to themselves before             any realization of continuing with one's life can             begin. &nbsp;                The poems from C. E. Laine's             Postcards  From A Summer Girl , are poignant             paintings of memory, death, loss and healing. They             are well written and filled with remarkable empathy             and truth of life's consequence. The words&nbsp;in             these poems are imaginative, full of woven image; and             I&nbsp;have no doubt&nbsp;I will find myself reading             them again.

        urlLink    (From the Evolving blog entry: Share the love...) I came across a  urlLink cool site  yesterday that made the imaginary lightbulb floating above my noggin blink on and off in rapid succession. Either that or I was experiencing a visual seizure. Anyway, the idea {BLINK, BLINK} was simply this...seems like this book site would be a cool and fun way to market my new book, Postcards From A Summer Girl. I've decided to offer two things in exchange for a little promotional help:                     1. A free copy of an e-book from Little Poem Press                  2. I'll reciprocate if you've got a book or chapbook you would like to promote.   So here's the skinny...this snippet in your weblog and then post a coment here or over in Evolving to let me know which e-book you want. The caveat is that you also have to mention the e-book and its author in your post. Place the following code in your weblog, along with mention of the e-book you want (we have to promote the e-book, too!!) Then post your link in the comments of this article.  To get the snippets of code,   urlLink  click here .   If you want to add to that, please feel free. Don't forget to mention something about the e-book you want to read, also. Link for the e-book can simply point to  urlLink www.celaine.com/LittlePoemPress . I'll do the same for you, too. Another neato-nifty-thing about  urlLink this site  is it lets you take a bit of javascript code for your site, where you can display the books you are currently reading, along with your comments about them. Maybe I am just a book nerd, but I think it's great stuff.

      I found a  urlLink nifty thing  today. It's a sort of book blog website, where readers can share and track books.
