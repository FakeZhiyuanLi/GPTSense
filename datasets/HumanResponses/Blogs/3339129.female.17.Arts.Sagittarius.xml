       Telling yourself you love another, isn't going to stop the pain of loving someone you cannot have.   PLACEBO - EVERY YOU, EVERY ME  Sucker love is heaven sent, you pucker up our passions spent My hearts a tart your bodies rent, my bodies broken yours is bent Carve your name into my arm, instead if stressed i lie here charmed Cause there's nothing else to do, every me and every you  Sucker love a box i choose, no other box i choose to use Another love i would abuse, no circumstances could excuse In the shape of things to come, too much poison come undone Cause there's nothing else to do, every me and every you  Sucker love is known to swing, prone to cling and waste these things Pucker up for heavens sake there's never been so much at stake I serve my head up on a plate, it's only comfort calling late Cause there's nothing else to do, every me and every you  Like the naked leads the blind, I know i'm selfish i'm unkind Sucker love i always find, someone to bruise and leave behind All alone in space and time, there's nothing here but what here's mine Something borrowed, something blue Every me and every you   PLACEBO - TASTE IN MEN  Come back to me a while Change your style again Come back to me a while Change your taste in men  It's been this way  Since Christmas Day Dazzled, Doused in gin  I'm killing time On Valentine's Waiting for the day to end Change your taste in men  PLACEBO - SLAVE TO THE WAGE  Run away from all your boredom Run away from all your whoredom And wave your worries and cares goodbye All it takes is one decision A lot of guts A little vision To wave your worries and cares goodbye  Sick and tired of Maggie's farm, She's a bitch with broken arms  It's a maze for rats to try  And it's a race for rats to die  Runaway.   THE MONKEE'S - TAKE A GIANT STEP  Though you've played at love and lost And sorrow's turned your heart to frost I will melt your heart again  Remember the feeling as a child  When you woke up and morning smiled This time you felt like you did then  There's just no percentage in remembering the past It's time you learned to live again at last  Come with me leave yesterday behind And take a giant step outside your mind  You stare at me in disbelief Say for you there's no relief But i swear i'll prove you wrong  Don't sit in your lonely room Just staring back in silent gloom That's not where you belong  Come with me i'll take you where the taste of life is green And everyday holds wonders to be seen  Come with me leave yesterday behind And take a giant step outside your mind   BLINK-182 - HERE'S YOUR LETTER  Cut the skin to the bone Fall asleep all alone Hear your voice in the dark  Lose myself in your eyes Choke my voice say goodnight As the world falls apart  Fuck i can't let this kill me Let go I need some more time to fix this  Here's a letter for you But the words get confused And the conversation dies  Apologize for the past Talk some shit take it back Are we cursed to this life  Fuck i can't let this kill me Let go I need some more time to fix this problem  I'm talking to the ceiling My life just lost all meaning Do one thing for me tonight I'm dying in this silence The last star left in heaven Is falling down to earth and Do you still feel the same way Do you still feel the same way???                                           QUEER AS FOLK Queer As Folk is my all time favourite TV show.. and here's why.. It's extremely controversial, lot's of people can't handle it. It doesn't stereotype homosexuals & portrays them in normal relationships & doesn't point out the differences between homosexuals and heterosexuals but instead shows the likenesses. The script is hilarious - great writing! The characters are SO likeable and after a while of watching QAF it began to feel like they were MY family and friends and I just felt so connected and in a happy place. And when i'm not watching QAF I miss the characters like they were my own friends and family. I cry when they cry, I laugh when they laugh, I share their most precious and intimate moments and their most saddest moments too. This is the only television show that's ever moved me so much and done this to me.                                                                           QAF QUOTES I LIKE:  QUEER AS FOLK QUOTES: "Don't waste time, life's too short. After all who knows what could happen tomorrow or even five minutes from now" - Michael  "The secret is to stop regretting the past and fearing the future and live in the now, because there is no always, there's only now, that's all we have" - Ben  "When it is right all you have to do is say yes to it" - Michael  "No matter how bad things get i'll always have my art, it's the one place i can go where i'll be safe, where no one can get to me" -Justin  And my favourite QAF quote from none other than Emmet: "I'd rather my flame burn bright than be a puny little pilot light"                                        RANDOM QUOTES:  *** "Feed the body food and drink and it will live a day,      Feed the soul art and music and it will live forever" - ??  "The mind and body must be subjected to extreme stimulus by means of drugs and music" -Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas  "I was hungry so i heated up a brick of cheese" -Tom Green, Stealing Harvard                                                          GREAT LINES FROM SONGS:  "I had opinions that didn't matter I had a brain that felt like pancake batter" -The White Stripes - The Hardest Button to Button  "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese" -The Vandals - Anarchy Burger  "Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies, in a Mercedes Benz, with the windows up, when the temp goes up, to the mid 80's" -Eminem - Forgot About Dre (With Dr. Dre)  "Let's go  Don't wait  This night's almost over  Honest  Let's make  This night last forever"  -Blink-182 - First Date                                    USELESS FACTS:  1. One of 'The Monkee's' mother's invented liquid paper.  2. If you cut an onion in half and rub it into the souls of your feet, you'll taste it in your mouth half an hour later.  3. Jimmy Carter saw U.F.O's.  4. Elephants are the only other mammals apart from humans that can stand on their heads.  5. Otis Redding wrote the song 'R.E.S.P.E.C.T'.  6. Bee's have tastebuds all over their bodies.   7. John Wilkes-Booth only fired one shot to kill Abraham Lincoln.                                                      JOE GILLAM:  Joe Gillam is an old man who i've seen around town a lot but only recently when I decided to speak to him did i learn his name. He's friends with weird Emily and they can often be seen together on dates dining at the Baker's Dozen in K-Mart or walking around aimlessly holding hands - but according to Joe they are NOT an item.   At first I talked to him because he looked like he & Emily had just had a fight (ok they had, me and my friend Stuart were spying on them) and he looked sad and lonely, but then i kind of wished i hadn't gone to talk to him because he informed me that Emily couldn't control her urination. Then he began to lean in close and he scared me and was being really creepy so i walked off. Next day he didn't remember me..  Ahh but that was a good night, Stu and I walked round the supermarket and filled up a trolley with really weird things then left it there and went.                                       SOMETHING BORING: Dad was playing the guitar and i sat there slurping my drink right up in his face for ages and he didn't even look at me. Then i went to mum and she was on the computer and i did the same to hr, and she didn't even look at me or tell me to fuck off like she normally would. Sometimes I think i'm invisible, although that would be insanely cool. I could sneak onto planes and travel all over the world and see everything and live in Johnny Depp's house and he wouldn't even know and I could go to Roswell and Area51 and monitor alien activity better than anyone because no one would know i was there! Do you believe in aliens? I have a very strong belief in aliens, i think it's stupid not to realise that Earth would not be the only inhabited planet. And scientists say that the other planets aren't capable of breeding life (no water, no plants, no oxygen, too hot, too cold etc.) but yes these planets can't breed human life, but aliens are not human, and what they need to realise is just that - these aliens are not human! The scientists don't know how the aliens bodies work, they could live in those conditions that we can't. There's too much evidence of aliens and u.f.o's to ignore it!   TOP 5 BANDS AT THE MOMENT: 1. Blink-182 (of course) 2. Placebo 3. Fenix*TX 4. The Vandals 5. Jimmy Eat World  TOP 5 MOVIES AT THE MOMENT: 1. Don Juan De Marco 2. Benny & Joon 3. What's Eating Gilbert Grape 4. Fight Club 5. Freddy Got Fingered / High Fidelity (couldn't decide)  TOP 5 ACTORS: 1. Johnny Depp (obviously) 2. Brad Pitt 3. Tom Green 4. Jack Black 5. John Cusack

       'Goes out to cruise and to meet his connection He never scores he just get's an infection Dreams of a place with a better selection Still it takes him all day just to get an erection'  Hmm i'm bored, been doing stupid things all day, amusing myself at least, i'm waiting for 53 minutes to go pick up my sister Lucille and her best friend Mollie so i won't be so bored. Mum made Mollie a huge birthday cake today with her name on it and all because on Lucy's birthday Lucy complained about the cake (which had her name written on it) saying that the Y was fucked or something, and then Mollie said "At least you got a birthday cake, I don't even get a cake, let alone a cake with my name on it". So mum made her a cake with a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLIE on it. It's a bigger cake than I ever got, and mum never made ME a cake with my name on it! Oh well anyway I bought Mollie a present today. Lucy bought her a Blink-182 cd and some smarties but then I got hungry and ate her smarties and i was gonna replace them but i DIDN'T! Oh shite I talk some boring sheeatttt. Hmm I might go eat the smarties mum bought for Mollie now.. mmmmmmmmmm... I'll replace them, they're already opened anyway what's the difference!!!!  *Her younger sister had a blister where I kissed her, on her thigh*

       Well considering this is my first post I suppose I'll introduce myself a bit, my name is Amy, I'm 17 turning 18, live in Australia and love music, Johnny Depp and guys! That'll do..  Well yesterday was a shite day, cause I had all these cool plans that my "friend" fucked up cause she's a ho. I won't get into it though cause it'll be as boring as george bush. And today well I only just crawled out of bed (11.15), had weird dream about this old man.. I went to visit him right and he's sitting there wrapped in cardboard and foil and he goes to me "IT'S ALUMINIUM" and i'm like "did you do this yourself?" and he goes "yeah" and laughs like it's the funniest thing since Fred Durst rapping. Then some lady nurse comes to check up on him and I take this opportunity to run through the rest of his house stealing as much stuff as I can get my lil hands on. Then I end up getting caught and old man goes skitzo "fuck this, fuck that" and tries to bash me up but he can't cause he's all wrapped up in foil and cardboard like a straight jacket. Then I wake up. WOW that's a great story, ah well...  I'm listening to Placebo at the moment, I love them! It's the 'Without You I'm Nothing' album. Me and my monkey reckon it's a good lil love making album. umm ok post more later.. It takes it's smile from every children          *Carve your name into my arm, instead of stressed I lie here charmed, cause there's nothing else to do, every me and every you*

       well normally since i dropped out of college at the start of the year i've been sleeping till 11 or 12 but today i fucking had to get up at like 9:30 and it's fucking winter (and of course tasmania being near antartica, winter is fucking freezing here) so my bed was niiice and warm and i really didn't want to fucking get up but i was going to see the new harry potter movie with lucy, mollie, emma and emma's friend  -kate? anyway so i got up early had my shower, got my shit together and we went down there only to find that it was sold out, so we bought tickets to the 6:10 session. but man i'm so fuckin pissed, like it's 1:30 and i'd really only just be crawling out of bed or sitting on the verandah having a cigarette and a cup of coffee, but no i've been up for hours now and there's nothing to fucking do. because the shite place i live in sucks monkey arse. BUT since i am moving to the big city next week, things are soo looking up!!! I'm so excited!! But i'm going to miss my family and friends like crazy! especially my family, i'll miss my sister & my mum and dad the most, and my brother too. I'm listening to the Rolling Stones 'Forty Licks' album which is fucking awesome. It's 40 of their best songs, 36 older songs and 4 new ones, and it fuckin goes off!! Awesome, awesome band, I'm only 17 so i didn't grow up in their 'era' but i grew up listening to them cause it's dads favourite band.   Favourite songs on 'Forty Licks' are... Beasts of Burden, Angie, Ruby Tuesday, Honky Tonk Women, Jumpin Jack Flash, Brown Sugar, Sympathy For The Devil, Get Off My Cloud, Street Fighting Man and of course Let's Spend The Night Together (even though it makes me a lil sad cause me & my ex used to listen to it a lot.. so it makes me think of him and get all weepy sometimes.. ahh sighhh.. over it!) Aaaanyway i actually love all the songs on there so it's hard to name favourites. Great lyrics though, great music. Anyway so i got the Placebo t-shirt i bought off ebay today, fucking awesome it fit's. Because i'm fairly petite it needed to be pretty small, and the band t-shirts usually come HUGE (for some fucked up reason, what.. like they think everyone who likes music is fat?) anyway so i'm stoked about it fitting! but the other top i bought is too big, well not across my tits it needs to stretch a bit, haha, oh well, nah it's not too bad of a fit i guess.. wearable.. BUT what i'm really waiting for is the new Placebo DVD 'Soulmates Never Die' to arrive in the mail for me, aaand this authentic, original 80's punk shirt -with safety pins and all! they're both gonna be awesome... then there's another hippy top i bought, didn't like it that much just bought it. oh well.  I'm fuckin starving man, it blows goats. I'd do anything for a few cheeseburgers and few packets of fries from maccas at the moment, and i mean anything.. Anyone want to make an offer? If anyone's reading this and you're bored go to www.hahapages.com it's pretty funny.. if you want to look at all the shit on there scroll down the bottom and click on the archive. it's something to do if you're bored anyway. Sooo every night i stay up til 1 am to watch the late show with david letterman, and then i normally go to sleep after it if there's nothing good on tv, but last night even though there was FUCKING NOTHING on tv (which reminds me i am soo gonna write to the television people and tell them how shit their shows are, and how they need to constantly play queer as folk & the simpsons (hey that's something i can do watch my endless supply of simpson tapes and dvds) anyway but there was nothing at all on tv but i just couldn't turn it off, i was so hyped up i couldn't sleep so i sat there with the tv on some foreign language movie, muted, listening to the white stripes (too loud apparently my sister didn't get any sleep cause of my music, but oh well, over it) smoking occasionally, just kind of staring at the posters on my roof..  thinking.. but i was completely tuned out.   i've noticed that lately i can tune myself out on command, if i'm watching tv or whatever, if i kind of bite my cheek (i have a bad habit of chewing it, so it brings great relief to me to occasionally bite it) i find that i can switch my main brain off on command - i still get all those other voices in my head, but i just kind of ignore them, and it feels so peaceful, i mean someone could say anything to me but i wouldn't hear it, they just can't get to me, when i'm in my own little world.   i'm also finding that my paranoia and insomnia are getting worse, as are all the bizarre voices in my head that tell me to do weird things, but they take over my body, my main brain thinker can't control them, they just take over completely, it's kind of scary, but not too bad cause they make me do really really odd things but nothing violent or harmful to me or anyone else, well harmful to my sanity yes, but not physically harmful. And sometimes i go into my little world and by the time i snap out of it i'm crawled up in a ball behind a chair or under the table or something.. it's kind of funny i spose. but it's not normal, i know that, but not being normal isn't the thing that scares me, because i would never want to be normal, i like being weird, and i like weird people, i don't like normal people, but the thing that scares me is the thought of my mental problems actually getting really bad, and so bad that i end up in a psych ward.  Well ummm i might start another post in a minute, but i'm going outside for a few mins.

       Are we alone in the universe? Are there really such things as aliens? Do they mean harm? What do they want? Will they someday dominate the Earth? Everybody has their own opinion on the topic, some believe, some do not. This essay will discuss my opinions and beliefs about paranormal activity.  To answer the first question, I strongly believe that we are not alone in the universe. Now for the creation of life on other planets there needs to be the right environment for living right? It is said that for the existence and development of life a stable star is needed, like our sun. The star needs to be not too close and not too far away from the planet. It takes several billions of years for life to evolve to the level of mammals, but before that happens you need an atmosphere with enough oxygen. It takes about two billion years for the plants to make enough oxygen to create those right conditions. Now Mercury and Venus are too close to the sun, there’s no liquid water. Mars, being one and a half times further from the Sun than us, hangs on the edge of the habitable zone. Planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are too far from the sun, they don’t have any liquid water on their surface. And also these planets (minus Pluto) exist for the bigger part of dangerous gasses.  So these planets are inhabitable then right? Well yes, for humans. But what these scientists who follow this rule of – no logical way anything could live there, fail to realize, or admit that these aliens are not humans so why would they need the same living environment as humans. They wouldn’t. They don’t know how the structure of the alien form operates so how can they tell us what kind of environment an alien needs for life? These people are scared of the truth.

       I have a friend who says ‘I’m not racist but I don’t like Asians’. And she’s not the only person I’ve met who has said something along those lines. Is the line between racist and non racist becoming blurred?   Supposedly racism was worse back in the day but really I think it’s still the same people just hide it better. There’s maybe not so much violence towards people of other races but there’s still hostility, judgment, and dislike between a lots of people of different races. I think there’s still as much racism as there always was, it just used to be more out in the open. Black people are still not being hired because they’re black a lot of places.  Employers don’t seem to care so much about experience and qualifications – if your appearance isn’t what they want you to look like then you’re out. It is not just ethnic that aren’t getting hired because of their appearance, my ex employer only hired me because I’m reasonably attractive when there were plenty of males with experience, whereas I had none. Then in the time I worked there every time he had a position open he judged by appearances, not qualifications. Girls who were overweight or unattractive were straight out and boys were just pretty much out – even though they usually had experience. No he wanted a pretty little girl even if she was dumb as a brick and had no idea what she was doing. However that was the only job that I’ve applied for that I actually got (apart from working as a waitress for my mother).  Over the past several years that I have been applying for jobs I have mostly always been asked to attend an interview. Now I have decent qualifications, good academic skills, a typing speed of 65 words per minute, a history of customer service etc. etc. So these employers are always happy to have me in for an interview… until I get there. I answer all of their questions fine, I tell them what they want to hear and sometimes I KNOW that I am the most qualified person for the job. BUT you see I have several piercings – wow big deal I know – but to these employers it is a big fucking deal for some reason.   And they ALWAYS discriminate against me because of it. Always. They’d act like they don’t but we all know they do. It’s not the fact that my piercings might affect the customer’s perceptions of the company, because the employer is always well assured by me that if I was employed I, of course, would not wear the piercings to work. So we know it’s not because of that. Then why you ask? It’s because these piercings automatically make me a bad person to these people, without them knowing me at all. Simply because some ‘naughty’, rebellious teenagers tend to have piercings so they assume I’m one of these people. When in reality my piercings are just a statement of my individuality, they are something that I like, but it doesn’t mean I’m a bad person.  It’s the same with coloured people, just because some coloured people are associated with crime; certain people assume that they’re all criminals. But uh… hello! White people are also always associated with crime but these people don’t think every white person is a criminal now do they? So why think of coloured people that way, because of course it is not true that all coloured people are criminals or terrorists, and they shouldn’t have to be burdened with other people thinking of them this way.      It’s not just appearances people discriminate against, it’s also sexual orientation. Homosexuals are now being denied the rights that everybody deserves. They are being denied the privilege to marry their partners who they love. They are being denied the privilege to announce their and celebrate their love for each other in front of family and friends in a ceremony that will bind their love and commitment together. Who the hell has the right to deny anyone of that?  I think that homosexual love should be celebrated even more so than heterosexual love. I am not gay, so that’s not why. The reason I think that is because homosexuals have more of a hard time in being the way they are and why should anyone have to have a hard time about being themselves? A lot of homophobes try and make homosexuals feel ashamed of who they are and it takes a lot of courage for them to come out and say ‘gay and proud of it’. But so many people have a problem with homosexuals that a large number of them find it extremely hard to be themselves. That is why it takes a hell of a lot of courage for them to be openly gay and to let people know that they are in love.   So they deserve to show off their pride, not just for their courage, but for their pride in their lovers and join their love together in marriage. But ohh the religious debate, well a lot of people would disagree with this but the way I see it is, if God is love, and God doesn’t make mistakes, then he intended to make everyone just the way they are, homosexuals included.   Homosexuals are also being denied the right to adopt children at all. Why? Because their children would be teased is the reply. But why would their children be teased? Because so many people are fucking ignorant and there is not a lot of understanding of gay people. But cutting off their rights is just making the problem worse. It is separating homosexuals from heterosexuals like they are species from another planet or something. If children are brought up to think of gay people as being ‘different’ and knowing that they are excluded from certain things and that people are punished for being gay, by having their rights denied, then they will not develop an understanding. But if they are brought up to believe that being gay is ok and that gay people are still the same people then they wouldn’t mind, therefore they wouldn’t tease other children for having gay parents.   By denying homosexuals their rights this problem will never be solved and may get a lot worse. If gay people can have the same rights as everyone else like they deserve then perhaps people will become more accepting towards them. Being gay doesn’t change a person of who they are, it doesn’t make them weird or a bad person it just means they have different preferences than other people. It’s the same as one person being a huge fan of death metal music and another being a fan of country music, it’s just their preferences it doesn’t change who the person is and what they think and feel and the sooner people realize that and make their children realize it the world will be a better place. And not just an acceptance of homosexuals, but an acceptance of everybody no matter what sexual preference, race, religion or whatever.   I was lucky enough to be brought up by two wonderful parents who taught me these things, who taught me that the value of every life is the same. If only everyone was lucky enough to have parents as good as mine then we could stop discrimination. But that of course I know is not going to happen, there will always be people discriminating against certain people, but you can help. One person does make a big difference in this case. So before you discriminate against anyone stop and really ask yourself why?
