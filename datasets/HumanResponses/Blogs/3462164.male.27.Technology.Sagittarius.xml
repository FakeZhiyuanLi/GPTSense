      All in all there were few surprises in terms of victories but some very exciting matches none the less. Pride Pride GP: CRITICAL COUNTDOWN 2004 was worth the hype, and is one of the stongest Prides yet not just in terms of match ups but also quality of matches.   Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Antonio Schembri   Nothing suprising here, Sak worked out a smooth victory over Elvis who still needs to learn to be more aggressive.   Quinton Jackson vs. Ricardo Arona   Now this one came as a bit of a surprise to me. Rampage has shown a weakness for very technical BJJ fighters on balance. His slam of Arona was sight to behold and pretty much eliminates any concerns I might have had about his head not being in the fight [no pun intended here]. As for some of the complaints about the headbutt -- Arona was KO'ed by the slam and it is clear by watching. The unintentional headbutt could have worked against Quinton, if Arona had not been KO'ed the cut on Rampage's brow would have ended the fight in Ricardo's favor.    Semmy Schilt vs. Sergei Kharitonov   Kharitonov is one hell of a good fighter in my book. His beating of Ninja should have clued everyone in and left no doubt this guy can hang with the best. Semmy seemed to frustrate Kharitonov early on with his reach and powerful left, however, on the ground Kharitonov took the fight to him and pounded out the win. I like that Kharitonov seems to strike hard and often on the ground to fend off submissions and set up his own. Hamanaka used this against Schembri to great success. He is flexible enough as a fighter to give anyone trouble like Sakuraba. There is no doubt he has a big future. I would love to see him fight Randleman on the Final Conflict card in August.   Paulo Cesar Silva vs. Naoya Ogawa   Ogawa is a world-class grappler, and Silva is a white belt. Was there ever any doubt on this one? Ogawa easily defeated the Giant with strikes after neutralizing any defense Silva could mount. I do have to say though Silva couldn't have lost either way. He still looks good on paper for getting this far and he wasn't injured at all. I like Ogawa; I hope he gets Nogueira in the next round that will make for a great fight.   Anotonio Nogueira vs. Heath Herring   Hands down the best fight of the night. This fight was intense with or without build up, which it didn't get enough of. Once again Nogueira proves he is just a bit too slick for Herring by working in a very slick side choke variation. Honestly, Nogueira is showing the greatest promise so far in the possiblity of taking home the belt. With Mirko out of the picture and Nog in the best shape of his life I think Fedor is going to be pushed farther than he ever has before.   Hidehiko Yoshida vs. Mark Hunt   This one went pretty much as expected if Yoshida got the take down. I must say though Hunt looked great in his submission defense. This guy has a great future in Pride if he gets over his fear of being taken down. Anyway, Yoshida by armbar, again.   Fedor Emelianenko vs. Kevin Randleman   Big build up, big slam by Randleman, big win for Fedor. This one went pretty much like Fedor's last fight -- Fedor is taken down and ends the fight with a quick submission. Though the loss isn't all bad for Randleman. In the past Kevin has seemed very lackluster with only moments of brilliance. With this fight however I think he is on a new path. Yes, I know he lost, but had he been in the ring with anyone but Fedor that fight would have ended with the slam. If he would just follow up, the fight may have ended there. I think Kevin needs sometime to get his life in order after the tragic passing of his father, then we are going to see him move on to great things. If he continues to fight at this intensity he will dominate the heavyweight division and perhaps take the title. Fedor on the other hand, it seems, has proven his resilience yet again. The tournament is clearly now down to Nogueira and Fedor. So far he seems unstoppable.

      The much anticipated rematch for the UFC Light Heavyweight Title was finally announced last weekend. At UFC 49, Randy "The Natural" Couture will fight Vitor "The Phenom" Belfort. Randy lost the title to Vitor in January during the first round, after the doctor stopped the fight due to a corneal abrasion. I had the pleasure of meeting Randy in March, and his eye was totally healed. It's going to be a close fight, and even though lots of people expect Vitor to win, I wouldn't count Randy out, as he has proven time and time again that he has what it takes to beat the best. Expect to see my breakdown of UFC 48 this weekend, as I still haven't seen the matches.

      UFC 48-Payback headlines some potentially fantastic fights, and brings to the table names such as: Ken Shamrock, Phil Baroni, Tim Sylvia, Frank Mir, Matt Serra, Curtis Stout, Frank Trigg and rising prospect Georges St. Pierre.  I think the question on every MMA fan's mind is:  "Will the appropriate title be UFC 48-Money back?  I don't believe so.  We have the popular and standard striker vs. grappler, legend vs. legend, a blood boiling desire for revenge, people fighting to keep their career in the UFC, upon many more drama stories worthy of a UFC soap opera (as opposed to the reality show currently in the making.)  As with any other mixed martial arts event, UFC 48 has the potential to explode in a fury of fierce fighting action.    It will live up to its potential as a powder keg, and then some.  Below are the picks that I have come up with upon reading the exciting line-up.  You may agree or disagree, but either way you must admit that calling mixed martial arts fights is like calling heads or tails, you truly never know what the result will be.  Enjoy the UFC's next installment in...UFC 48-Payback, tomorrow night on Pay Per View.  My picks:  Georges St. Pierre by submission in round 2. I'll just take a wild guess and say by armbar.  Matt Serra by submission in round 2 or 3. I'll even be more specific in saying perhaps by way of a triangle or rear naked choke.  Curtis Stout by a late TKO or unanimous decision after three rounds of exciting back and forth action. (This will also be huge money maker, considering Stout is somehow the under dog as far as betting is concerned.)  Frank Trigg by unanimous decision after three great rounds.   Phil Baroni by TKO in round one, getting full revenge for the horrible event that happened the last time they met in the octagon. He won't let Evan Tanner slip through his fingers this time.  Tim Sylvia by TKO in round one. Although I do feel that Mir has a chance, and I'd like him to win by submission (and could visualize it happening in round two) I just don't think it'll happen.  Matt Hughes by TKO in round two. I can almost see this one as clear as I can see my hand in front of my face. Matt Hughes in side control, pounding Renato Verrisimo until the ref tackles Matt to bring a hault to the fight.  Ken Shamrock by submission in round two. I'm just going out on a limb here for shits and giggles and saying Ken will bust out his patented ankle lock to tap Kimo. This one could really go either way though, I don't care what anybody says.

      Former UFC lightweight champion Jens "Lil Evil" Pulver fought it out in his second pro-boxing, and television debut against a more experienced boxer in Steve Vincent (3-1, 3 KO's) last night on ESPN2's second installment of Tuesday Night Fights.  Jens Pulver (2-0, 1KO) came out as a fighter, quickly closing the gap between he and his opponent, covering up with ear muffs, and launching power shots.  Vincent was light on his feet, and peppered Jens' body with lighting quick shots.  1:40 into the first round, Pulver was dropped with a fast and vicious left-right combination.  He recovered well, coming right back at his enemy with conviction.  In the second round it was Pulver who scored a big knockdown around the same 1:40 marker with a monster left hand.  Vincent had dropped his hands and was somewhat show-boating with head movement when he ate Pulver's patented left, that sent him tumbling to the canvas in shock.  He also recovered, but Jens failed to capitalize on the opportunity.  The third round of this scheduled four round bout did not cease to keep the audience on the edge of their seats as Jens AGAIN floored his opponent with a monster left.  This one was much more stunning than the first, and Vincent was beginning to make an impression on the canvas.  Pulver came out a bit more aggressive when his man recovered, but still lacked the killer instinct to close the show.  His man survived to see the final round.  Unfortunately for Jens, the fourth round did not include any knockdowns, but instead gave Vincent the opportunity to showcase his superior technique and fast hands.  He peppered Jens' forearms with quick combinations, with Jens landing the occasional mean punch, but none of them made him shaky in the knees. Most of the judges gave the fourth and final round to Vincent, as he significantly outlanded Lil Evil from bell to bell.  The end result was a split decision victory awarded to Jens Pulver.  In final punch stats, Vincent clearly out punched and out boxed Pulver, but the two knockdowns Jens scored were the deciding factor.  One judge still scored the bout in favor of Vincent, meaning he gave Jens a 10-9 round for one of the rounds he scored a knockdown.  All in all, this was a good win for Jens.    Many are doubting the potential of the former UFC lightweight champion, and current MMA star.  However, with only being 2-0 it is far too early to judge where his career is headed.  I believe that if Jens works on a few aspects of his game, he could become a force to be reckoned with in the welterweight division.  Here are some of the points I came up with after viewing the fight:  1.) Pulver needs to use the jab with more conviction.  Look back to my "second training tip."  Jens barely used the jab in this fight, and sometimes when he did, he'd paw with it.  I think that if he establishes his jab earlier on, and makes it a stiff jab, he'll find it much easier to set up those mean left hands that put fighters on their backs.  2.) Work the angles.  Jens came straight in, and although he is a natural fighter as opposed to a boxer, he should try working different angles to get to the body...which brings me to my next pointer:  3.) Pound the body.  After he closes the gap, Jens should nail the body with some nice hooks and crosses before taking it upstairs.  He was somewhat of a head hunter against Vincent, and that is why he had little trouble blocking the shots and returning fire.  4.) Stop focusing on the left.  It is no secret that Pulver has a monster left, but I feel that he spent too much time and effort trying to set it up.  It was almost as though it were the only punch he wanted to land.  If he follows the above pointers, and punches in numbers, I feel that the devastating left hand will set itself up.  5.) Make punches a bit shorter.  Jens needs to close the gap between he and his opponent a bit more before he launches the power punches.  Going to the body first will certainly help ensure that this distance is closed.  Making his punches a bit tighter will make it more difficult for his opponent to capitalize with counter punches.  Congraulations Jens Pulver!  Good luck in future pro-boxing bouts.

      Think back to the last mixed martial arts fight you saw in which the two combatants boxed for a lengthy period of time.  I'm thinking right now of Robbie Lawler vs. Nick Diaz, in which Diaz upsetted Lawler with a devastating lead hook.  If you view the fight in its entirety, you'll see that both fighters did one thing that leaves you exposed for a damaging blow if your opponent has any real boxing talent.  They pawed with their jab.  This horrible habit is a common one amongst boxers, kickboxers, and MMA fighters alike.    Pawing with the jab is only a small step better than leaving your lead hand dangling at your thighs.  You are basically just reaching out and touching your opponent when you could be sticking a decisive and intimidating jab in their face.  If you can touch him, you can hit him, and I'd rather hit my opponent than give him a nice little love tap.  Sticking your jab with conviction does a number of things.  It frustrates your opponent, ruins his rhythm, temporarily shocks or possibly even stuns him, if you use it properly it can blur his vision, and all of these lead to the most useful result -- it sets up your remaining arsenal.  From the jab you can drop right hands, hook, throw uppercuts, kicks, elbows, knees, or you can shoot in and slam.  However, if you paw with the jab it does nothing to his rhythm, it doesn't hurt him, and it doesn't take away his vision.  If anything, you are welcoming him in to put you on your back.  You are giving him your lead hand and saying, "I can't do anything with this...so here have it."  So the next time you find yourself on your feet in the proving grounds, be sure to STICK your jab with bad intentions.  Jab through him, and try to make his head into a pez dispenser.  It could be a matter of win or loss, champ or chump, life or death.

      With the next round of the Pride Heavyweight Grand Prix less than two weeks away, I figured I would post my picks.   Fedor Emelianenko vs. Kevin Randleman   While conventional wisdom is that Fedor will win this one, I am going to go with my gut and say Randleman. If Randleman keeps listening to Mark Coleman, and brings the same game he brought to Cro-Cop, he will be unstoppable. Of course, the key word is if.   Anotonio Nogueira vs. Heath Herring   I think Nogueira will win this one by decision, just like he did the last time he fought Heath Herring. Nogueira has been on a role, having lost just one match in the last 4 years. Herring has been doing well as of late too, winning his last 4 matches, but he hasn't had to fight the same level of opponents as Nogueira, and more importantly, he just doesn't have what it takes to win this match up.   Paulo Cesar Silva vs. Naoya Ogawa   I expect Ogawa to pick up the victory, but it won't be as easy as some of his past fights. Giant Silva is one big dude, a knockout is out of the question, so Ogawa will have to pick up a submission, or just tough it out until a decision.   Semmy Schilt vs. Sergei Kharitonov   After seeing Sergei mop the floor with Ninja, I think this one is a no-brainer. Sergei, by knockout.   Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Antonio Schembri   I don't expect Sakuraba to lose to Schembri a second time. I expect him to fight a cautious fight, and win by decision.   Quinton Jackson vs. Ricardo Arona   My inital thoughts were Arona, because Jackson hasn't had a match in 6 months. I still think that Arona will win, but not for the reason stated above. I just looked up Arona's stats, and Arona hasn't had a match in 18 months, so in that regard, Jackson has an advantage. I think the two are pretty evenly matched in skill, Jackson's win over Chuck Lidell was a huge win for him. So why do I still choose Arona? I believe the victor will be the person who wants the win more, and from what I am hearing, Jackson isn't very interested in fighting anymore.   Hidehiko Yoshida vs. Mark Hunt   If this goes to the ground, Yoshida should win by submission, if it stays on the feet, Mark Hunt should get the knockout. I don't see this match going to a decision. My instincts tell me to go with Yoshida.

      Thanks for the invite bro!  For my first contribution to this fine MMA blog, I'd like to give some nice training advice for those of you who are serious about combative sports.  Personally, I love to stand up and fight.  Submission grappling is a lot of fun and a fantastic work out, but if it were my choice I'd box it out in every match, win or lose.  Bearing this in mind, you will see more advice of mine geared toward stand-up fighting, and my first contribution is no exception.  In stand-up fighting one of the most important aspects of the game is keeping your eyes open and staying prepared.  A lot of fighters have the tendency to look away, perhaps at the ground or even the lights as their opponent pounds away with a vicious combination.  If you can muster up the courage just once to cover up and watch the punches, kicks, elbows, or knees coming at you then you can react better.  After all, you know how the saying goes, "The worst punch is the one you don't see coming."  Just remember, the same philosophy from baseball and basketball in Elementary school hold true in the brutal proving grounds, keep your eyes on the ball...only in this case the ball is represented by a fist trying to pound you into submission, which makes it all the more important!  So the next time you find yourself on the defensive, keep your eyes open and be courageous!  Remember that true courage is not the absence of fear, but how you react when you are neck deep in it.  Be brave, and see the shots as they come.  Counter when you see the opening, or get out quickly.  Try to retreat on angles instead of straight back.  If all else fails, smother your opponent's attacks by closing the distance between the two of you.  Good luck!  Train hard or fall hard.

      So far this show is set to be perhaps the best Pride to date not only for its lineup but also thanks to the GP’s initial round. I still can’t believe the Randleman/Crocop match nevermind Fedor/Coleman. It looks like we will also see [finally] the Jackson/Arona match so hype by Pride for the MW GP last year.  Here is the card as it stands now:  Quinton “Rampage” Jackson (USA) vs. Ricardo Arona (Brazil) Kazushi Sakuraba (Japan) vs. Antonio “Nino” Schembri (Brazil) Hidehiko Yoshida (Brazil) vs. Mark Hunt (New Zealand)   Tournament Matches are:   Fedor Emelianenko vs. Kevin “The Monster” Randleman Antonio Rodrigo “Minotauro” Nogueira vs. “The Texas Crazy Horse” Heath Herring Paulo Cesar “Giant” Silva vs. Naoya Ogawa Semmy Schilt vs. Sergei Kharitonov

      The last few years haven't been very good to Star Trek. Voyager was the worst Star Trek show ever, Deep Space 9 didn't get any promotion, and the first two years of Enterprise sucked. A lot of people blame two people in particular, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. Rick Berman took over as producer of Star Trek after the death of the series founder, Gene Roddenberry. Brannon Braga was a writer during the days of The Next Generation, and was promoted to producer for Voyager. Together, the two have run the series into the ground. In an interview with Ronald D. Moore, writer on The Next Generation and Deep Space 9, he revealed that the writing staff had to lie to Berman in order to do the show the way envisioned it. There were a couple of great ideas they had which they never could do, because Berman felt that they pushed the envelope too far. As for Braga, he has never seen an episode of the original Star Trek. He has violated continuity countless times, recycled old episodes repeatedly, and cheapened the show by putting as much sex in as possible in an attempt to grab ratings. Instead of expanding the audience, all they have done is alienated long time fans, many of which have turned to other shows. Fortunately, the two are stepping back from day to day involvement in Star Trek, and the series will be handed over to Manny Coto, who joined the writing staff of Enterprise for Season 3. I, for one, am very excited, for Manny Coto has written some of the best science fiction on TV in a long time. He was the series creator of Odyssey 5, which ran on Showtime for a season before it cancelation. Odyssey 5 was one of the most original shows I have seen in a long time, and the decision to cancel it was monumentally stupid. It was the second highest rated show on Showtime, but they decided they didn't want to do science fiction. That's just like when Sci-Fi channel canceled their highest rated show, Farscape, because it's ratings weren't as high as Stargate. More on that some other time. Coto also wrote some of the best scripts not only of this season of Enterprise, but one of the best episodes in all Star Trek. I am very confident that under his direction, the show will get even better next season.

      Ever since the last episode of Farscape aired back in March 2003, a lot of fans were left in the cold, not knowing the fate of Moya and her crew. Fortunately, a couple of months ago, Sci Fi channel confirmed that Farscape will be returning in the form of a mini-series, known as Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars. While there isn't an official date, it is expected to premiere in October 2004. As that date draws closer, pictures from the production are starting to be released on the internet.  urlLink Click here  for a page with links to tons of pictures from The PK Wars, and then come back here and post your thoughts.

      There have been a lot of developments over the last three weeks pertaining to Startrek. Some of it is good, some of it is bad. The bad news is that Startrek 11 is going to be a prequel concept. It will focus on the Romulan Wars, and follow a crew of new characters that have never been seen before. This is such a bad idea. Startrek fans don't want to see a movie about a bunch of characters we have never seen before, we want to see more movies with The Next Generation crew and Deep Space Nine crew. Doing a movie with new characters means they will have to waste time introducing the characters first. Also, they can't do the Romulan Wars justice in a movie, or even three movies like they are thinking about. It is much too big a conflict. If Paramount moves ahead on this, it could very well kill Startrek. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for the good news. First, production on Season 4 had begun. The first episode is titled Storm Front, and it will pick up where the Season 3 finale, Zero Hour, left off. Fortunately, they will not resolve the cliffhanger in one episode, but take three, which is what I was hoping for. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More good news is that Manny Coto is taking over more and more responsibilities from Brannon Braga. This should lead to Season 4 being even better than Season 3. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While William Shatner has not yet been signed to&nbsp;make an appearance in Season 4, another Startrek alumnus has. Brent Spiner, who played Data in Startrek: The Next Generation, will be in episodes 4-6. He will play the grandfather of Doctor Noonien Soongh, creator of Data. To add a twist to his character, Spiner's character will be against the development of artificial intelligence. Having the likes of Spiner and Shatner do guest appearances on Enterprise will be great, but I hope that they don't get to carried away with it. If they bring back to many old faces, it will be more of a gimmick to attract fans who have left the show in the last few years, and it won't make the shows any better. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am writing this post, Trekweb.com just posted that the season premiere of Enterprise has been delayed from September to October 8. To make matters worse, the show will premiere at 8 PM, even though the rest of the season will be at 9 PM on Friday. UPN obviously doesn't have the slightest clue on how to promote Startrek. The majority of their commercials were horrible last season, they have moved the show from Wednesday nights to Firday nights, and they can't even be consistent from week to the next with the time. In the likely even that UPN doesn't order anymore episodes after season 4 concludes, hopefully Paramount will find another network to pick Enterprise up, or put it into syndication.

There are two great updates. First, a teaser will be shown tonight on Sci-Fi during Stargate SG-1. The other is that the premiere date has been announced to be October 17.

      If any of you get a chance take a look at this bit of  urlLink verbal defecation  I found on Moveonpac.org. Albert Gore has a few nasty comments concerning the President. Again I am completely amazed at how liberals like Gore are unable or worse yet unwilling to grasp the big picture. Here are a few of the more obnoxious quotes I haven't heard discussed yet.   George Bush promised to change the tone in Washington. And indeed he did. As many as 37 prisoners may have been murdered while in captivity, though the numbers are difficult to rely upon because in many cases involving violent death, there were no autopsies.  How dare they blame their misdeeds on enlisted personnel from a Reserve unit in upstate New York. President Bush owes more than one apology. On the list of those he let down are the young soldiers who are themselves apparently culpable, but who were clearly put into a moral cesspool. The perpetrators as well as the victims were both placed in their relationship to one another by the policies of George W. Bush.   Just so I have this clear some Fascists who have acted against America and/or the Iraqi people in Iraq die in jail and this has changed the tone in Washington for the worst? As if the tone in Washington prior to this “unfortunate” incident was something akin to the REM video Shiny Happy People. Isn’t Moveon.org the same bunch of idiots that months ago published Ads that compared Bush to Hitler? Ah…the good old days. What the hell is this “moral cesspool”? Iraq is a moral cesspool because they for the most part like Bush and want freedom? That sounds like hate speech. As for responsibility of both the perpetrators and the “victims” well I have some questions there too. How are the policies of a four year old administration responsible for Islamic hatred of America forget about the actions of the prison guards who are probably filled with a understandable level of anger towards enemy? Note that Gore neglected to point out any real policies that state “kill, torture and otherwise abuse prisoners in the name of America”. Even if our policies are indirectly responsible, and they aren't, if Bush is directly responsible for these deaths, and he isn't, I would like to see the Democrats take direct responsibility for Alger Hiss. They are undeniably guilty of letting Communist spies run free in the government throughout the 20th century putting America’s standing in the world in jeopardy on a level far beyond the "loss of respect" we've supposedly suffered in this case. So what is worse: an American policy that lets Fascist die in jail or one that hires them to make policy?    In my religious tradition, I have been taught that "ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit... Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."    Ok, a bit about Gore's supposed “religious tradition” [note he didn’t say beliefs]. Democrats say they support America but historically have sided with the enemy. They opposed invading Afghanistan, so did the Taliban. They opposed overthrowing Sadam, so did Al Qaeda. No sooner did Al Qaeda rear its ugly head in Iraq did the Democrats start screaming for retreat. If we were to only look at the "fruit" of Democrats, say their positions on issues/their votes, the people they choose to support or the policies they put in place then we would be inclined to believe they side with forces opposed to America. They are the first to defend the enemy [sometimes even ahead of France]. Siding with the enemy when the enemy has stated they hate you and will kill you is an action that will only bring about ruin. Make no mistake here Fascist Islam hates Liberal values. Liberals will be the first ones killed. All of Islam’s arguments against American culture are focused on our crumbling morality, something Liberals champion. They are ideological lemmings at heart. Thank God there are enough Republicans around to keep them from driving us all off the bridge with them. So on this point I guess I do agree with Gore. By thier fruit you  will  know them.

       urlLink It looks like Saddam has the Jordanian equivalent of Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. who is saying Saddam was tortured during what our government has previously referred to as questioning.  Now while that comes as good news to most everyone who ever had to suffer under this evil bastard it may turn the political tide in his favor. I guess according to Saddam supporters US agents being pushy during questioning and depriving an evil dictator, who has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people, of sleep is now torture. However, the well documented torture and slaughter of Nick Berg was what -- Free speech?  Somebody please shoot this SOB now and make it look like an accident so we don’t have to go through this farce.

       urlLink More proof here on my theory that Leftists/Liberals are hated more than even the average American.  France has done nothing but defend Islam-o-fascists and attempted to thwart America's interests in the Middle East. They are by far the greatest defenders of Iraq and do their share to bash Israel. France does this to such an extend you could hardly imagine a better ally for Bin Laden yet France still finds itself under siege. At the least you would have thought the Islam-o-fascists would have waited until they had destroyed "the Great Satan" before they got to the business of killing their “friends”. That is, you might think this way if you think Militant Islam feels as rosy about the Liberals as they do about Militant Islam. Clearly this isn’t the case.

      Here is some  urlLink rather disturbing news . Iran has been rattling their swords lately, but this is very serious. Apparently, their spy Ahmed Chalabi, must have given them some indication that we Americans have no intention of opposing the Iranian army’s invasion of Iraq. If in fact the Iranian's do have a strong intelligence gathering presence in Iraq we might be better off attacking now rather than defending agianst an invasion with the enemy already behind our lines.

      Someone sent me this note. It is worth passing on.   There was actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper an offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American.  So an Australian dentist wrote the following to let everyone know what an American is,so they would know when they found one. (Good on ya, mate!!!!)  An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be Canadian, Mexican, African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan. An American may also be a Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, Seminole or one of the many other tribes known as native Americans.  An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim. In fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan. The only difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of them chooses. An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God.  An American is from the most prosperous land in the history of the world. The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God given right of each person the pursuit of happiness.  An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other nation in the world in their time of need. When Afghanistan was overrun by the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country.!  As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in Afghanistan.  Americans welcome the best, the best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the best athletes. But they also welcome the least. The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed. These in fact are the people who built America. Some of them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11, 2001 earning a better life for their families. I've been told that the World Trade Center victims were from at least 30 other countries, cultures, and first languages, including those that aided and abetted the terrorists.  So you can try to kill an American if you must. Hitler did. So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the history of the world. But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself. Because Americans are not a particular people from a particular place. They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.  Author unknown

            They told us our Army had no chance against The Republican Guard in Iraq war one. They told us the A-1 Abrams Tank did not work. Our Apache helicopters could not last in the dust. Our volunteer troops were too soft and the Iraqis were just too tough. As with most things that are based on facts and figures and not opinion they were wrong. They told us that federal programs were cut under Bush one. Actually the growth rate of some programs were slowed. So that 10 Billions plus 2 Billion became a cut. I don’t think Dan Rather knew math well enough to know that was not a cut. Some democrat told him it was a cut and neither Mr. Rather nor his staff was smart enough to know. All of the big media folks hang around with liberals so they don’t know what the rest of us know. People like Dan just read a script that is written for them. They don’t know a thing, they don’t write the script or research it. They just read it. They are either villains working for the enemy or the village idiots and being a charitable writer I will give them the benefit of the doubt – they are stupid and lazy.      Next we were told George W. Bush was stupid. The man has an M B A from Harvard. We have some graduate of Carolina in Liberal Arts that can’t do math telling us that Gore, a divinity School dropout, is a genius and a man with a Masters from Harvard is dumb. This is not difficult to see through.       Next we were told we stood no chance in Afghanistan. The Russians had found it impossible. We would also. There would be 1000’s of casualties. It was another Vietnam. By the way, Every war that a Democrat does not start is another Vietnam. As usual the press was wrong.      Now we are hearing Iraq too is a Vietnam. Who we are turning the country over to is the official question of the day, everyday. To me the question is not, “Who is George Bush turning Iraq over to?” It is instead, “Who would John Kerry surrender to?”       With the Death of Ronald Reagan the press is trying act like Reagan did not win the Cold War and his tax cuts did not help the economy.  With the tax cut tax receipts actually went up, not down. But a Democratic Congress spent money faster than it came in. The good economy we are told came from Bill Clinton’s actions. Which brings up the question how many affairs with interns does it take to get the economy moving. We are being told Jimmy Carter was a great President. If he had beat Reagan he might have surrendered to the Soviet Union or even Iran.

      As a Graphic Designer myself I would like to apologize for this  urlLink asinine, so called, prayer  I found on another designer’s web site. A designer, who I might add, I previously looked up to. Mo here is advocating the continued suffering of Iraqis because America is not perfect. Nothing America has ever done over the last 228 years to it’s own people, however horrible, compares with what Saddam has done in his thankfully short rule. I am disgusted and ashamed as an American by this attitude. As a follower of Islam   he   should be ashamed that he is praying for the mass murder and subjugation of his religious brethren in the modern age rather than see them freed by Americans. That is, after all, what opposing the American liberation means at this point.

                     I was watching Special Report with Brit Hume on Fox News last night and they were having a discussion about US treatment of prisoners in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard made a very good point, the same Democrats who are so angry about our "atrocities" will be the first ones to point fingers after the next terrorist attack on US soil. They will ask why we didn't do a better job gathering intelligence, and when people point out that they are the ones who prevented the CIA from doing its job, they'll say we're questioning their patriotism. Not that they have any, but that's another story.                 Here's my take on the whole situation. First of all, let's be real here. We probably are torturing some prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. But it would be wrong to equate our actions to that of these savages who behead innocent civilians in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. They torture people for fun, we torture only as a last resort in order to gather information. If a prisoner has valuable information that could save American lives, and he isn't talking, then we should do whatever it takes to make him talk. Remember, these people are our enemies. They have raised arms against America, and now they have to pay the price. The savages claim that they are retaliating against us because of US treatment of Iraqi prisoners. That's ridiculous. Long before these pictures were released, these cowards were resorting to cowardly tactics such as suicide bombing in order to attack coalition troops and Iraqi civilians. Furthermore, as far as Iraqi prisoner abuse is concerned, none of the pictures are showing torture. They show degradation and humiliation, which is not the same. This isn't just semantics here either, it is an important difference. And the accusations that our troops are insulting Arab culture are pretty weak, considering that Arab culture doesn't have any problem with rape, honor killings, torture, and other acts of savagery. The Geneva Accords don't apply to the Iraqi prisoners, as they haven't been classified as prisoners of war. I'm tired of seeing our enemies violate the rules of war everyday, and then hiding behind them when it's convenient. Now I'm not suggesting that we lower ourselves to their level, but we do need to make it clear that they can't get away with attacks on civilians, and then expect us to treat them with respect.

      In the last month, the savages have beheaded three civilians in an attempt to intimidate the US, and now South Korea into leaving Iraq in their bloody hands. They will keep resorting to more primitive means of warfare unless something is done. I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I have an idea. Let's send them videos of our own. Instead of beheading them however, let's feed them pig! Wrap them up in pig skin, shove pork chops down their throats, etc. Everytime our troops kill these savages in a firefight, perhaps they can cover the bodies with pig. Perhaps their friends will think twice before shooting at us, because if they die, their 72 virgins won't be waiting for them on the other side. Their last thoughts as they die should be of despair, knowing that they won't meet their god.

      Remember the 8 Royal Marines that were captured by Iran and blindfolded? The Iranian government claimed that they were violating Iranian waters. Well, it turns out that the Marines may never have strayed into Iranian waters to begin with. According to this article, the Royal Marines were in Iraqi waters and were forcibly escorted into Iranian waters. If the GPS data backs this up, then this would prove to be an act of war. With luck, the Bush administration will turns its sights on Iran in the next term.

      There's an old Arab proverb that goes like this: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." It would appear that the Arabs have forgotten their own teachings, since everyone is their enemy today. Even Al-Qaeda, which the Saudi's have supported for a long time, have started launching attacks on Saudi soil. While the Saudi citizens are angry about this, it is hard to have any sympathy for them, considering that they approve of terrorism as long as it is directed towards the United States or Israel. Even now, while the House of Saud claims that it is going to start cracking down on terrorists, they still go on national television and blame everything on Israel. The clerics, who are on the House of Saud's payroll also blame everything on the US and Israel. It is clear that they aren't interested in fighting terrorists, they are only interested in appearing to fight terrorists while maintaining good relations with us. This farce has gone on for too long, and it is time we issued an ultimatum to Saudi Arabia. Close down your madrassas that brainwash children into becoming terrorists, shut down all camps that train terrorists, and freeze the accounts of all known terrorists. In the meantime, we need to reevaluate our relationship with the two-faced House of Saud.

      The Supreme Court has ruled that detainees at Guantanamo Bay have the right to challenge their detention in US courts. This is an outrage. No where in the Constitution does it say that foreigners who have fought against the US have the right to legal representation in our courts. That right is for Americans, not their enemies. The ACLU, which is celebrating this decision, is supposed to defend AMERICAN civil liberties. Perhaps they should change their name to the Arab Civil Liberties Union, since that's who they really want to protect. Also, has anyone else noticed how the media keeps calling this decision a defeat to "Bush's War on Terror?" This is not a defeat to President Bush, it is a defeat to Americans everywhere that don't want to see our enemies released so they can continue to fight us.

      I just got back from 4th of July festivities to read this article from the Sun. Saddam Hussein admitted in court yesterday that he misjudged America's resolve to invade Iraq. He also said he was counting on the "United Nations' bickering over Weapons of Mass Destruction to save him." These statements prove two points. First, the Clinton era made America appear weak to the rest of the world. By not retaliating properly of the US embassy bombings in Africa, or the USS Cole bombing, the terrorists were convinced that America was a paper tiger. By allowing Saddam to violate multiple security resolutions and not doing anything about it, Saddam also became convinced that America wouldn't attack him a second time. The other thing that Saddam's admissions have proved is that the UN is totally useless. Saddam knew that the UN would never grow tired of playing Saddam's games, and that he could hold the inspectors off indefinitely. There is a very important lesson to be learned here. The US has an obligation to fight its enemies every time they rear their head. To not do so only emboldens them farther. This is one of the reasons why the terrorists were successful in attacking the US on September 11th. Forunately, in the last two and a half years, the Bush administration has been doing an excellent job of engaging the enemy in their territory. Most of Al Qaeda leadership has been killed, the training camps destroyed, and the rest of them on the run. The people who harbored them are no longer in power, and Afghanistan is almost ready to hold elections (if the UN would provide security, like the Afghans are asking for). Saddam Hussein has been deposed, and Iraq will draft a constitution next year, and also hold elections. Libya has dismantled its nuclear weapons program peacefully after seeing what happened to Saddam. The terrorists in Iraq are fighting a losing battle, and they know it. The next couple of years will be crucial in the war on terror. If we let up now, we will only confirm the terrorists beliefs that America is weak. Let's hope that we don't go down that road, or a few decades from now, we might not be celebrating the 4th of July.

      Now that I’m back I’ve just got to get my two cents in on this whole Kerry/Vietnam thing. Let’s face it Kerry has been setting himself up for a long time and this situation is a prime example of how Liberals persist in believing they can have things both ways. This man is a hero only in his own mind and the minds of some seriously diluted people. According to his own words Kerry is simultaneously: a war criminal and a war hero. He served in and protested against the war a trend we see continued throughout his career. This alone, for me, calls into question his ability to lead Americans. Waffles are for breakfast not politics, and John Kerry is a consummate waffler.  urlLink After seeing this commercial however I am quite certain this man is a walking disaster in addition to a waffler.  Two of his three Purple Hearts were received due to Kerry injuring himself through stupidity. It is truly hard not to laugh out laud just explaining that to people. If this is the best the Liberals can nominate then they are worst off then one might first believe.

I don’t know if we are still using psychological warfare on these Islam-o-fascists but it is their only weakness. Also, if they run into a "holy" place, [Mosque, outhouse, or whatever] they put that place in jeopardy and we need to make that clear by bombing the hell out of these sites if they are used as staging grounds.

       urlLink Al Qaeda has been working for sometime to obtain nuclear weapons.  I saw this link on LGF and I hope this article helps to put things back in perspective to anyone who is starting to relax [I know I was]. We are by no means out of the woods.    If a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon, a midget even smaller than the one that destroyed Hiroshima, exploded in Times Square, the fireball would reach tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit It would vaporize or destroy the theater district, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Terminal and Carnegie Hall (along with me and my building). The blast would partly destroy a much larger area, including the United Nations. On a weekday some 500,000 people would be killed.   Could this happen?   Unfortunately, it could - and many experts believe that such an attack, somewhere, is likely. The Aspen Strategy Group, a bipartisan assortment of policy mavens, focused on nuclear risks at its annual meeting here last week, and the consensus was twofold: the danger of nuclear terrorism is much greater than the public believes, and our government hasn't done nearly enough to reduce it. Graham Allison, a Harvard professor whose terrifying new book, "Nuclear Terrorism," offers the example cited above, notes that he did not pluck it from thin air. He writes that on Oct. 11, 2001, exactly a month after 9/11, aides told President Bush that a C.I.A. source code-named Dragonfire had reported that Al Qaeda had obtained a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon and smuggled it into New York City.

This is straight out of the Palestinian/Soviet book and we have seen it time and time again throughout the history of the last century.
