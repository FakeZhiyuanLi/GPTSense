      Okay, if the Exclusive Clothing Store (which we shall not name, but shall call The L*m*t*d) has their sign out front today that says "Five Days Only- The Season's Hottest Sweater for $24.50 (normally $39.50)" that will be twelve days now that the season's hottest sweater has been $24.50 for five days only.  I've been counting, you freaks.

      The Day After (Thanksgiving) 27 shopping days until X-mas. "Once more into the breach..."  It's us against them and I have to be at work in 90 minutes.  I am arming for battle but I ate so much yesterday I think I might just die in my car on the way there. I don't want to go to work, so I'm trying to psych myself up.  I need a mantra, damnit.  I don't have one yet.  How can I go into battle with the customers without a mantra?  I have to.   I'll be okay because I'm   urlLink kick- ass  like  urlLink Bruce Campbell .  I'm cool like Michelle Pfeiffer in "Batman Returns."  I'm  urlLink Neo  and there is no  urlLink spoon .  In other words, I am Mighty, I have a glow you cannot see.  I am Jack Black in "High Fidelity."

      It has been a hard week.  But apparently I am inspirational, to  urlLink myself  and  urlLink others .  Which is a comfort in these trying times. I have to work the day after Thanksgiving.  And I have to work the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  I do not have to work the Sunday after Thanksgiving and for this I am Thankful. I will be having the drumsticks, but I wish joyous  urlLink tofurkey  consuming to the vegetarians.

      Here is the fiction that must be maintained- I will pretend to care, care deeply, whether or not you spend your money today.  I will pretend that it is worth it to me to be spoken to like a mildly retarded teenager in order to get your money.  I will pretend I don't mind, don't mind at all if you demand special treatment and then rationalize your demands by loudly drawing attention to how much money you spend.  You will then, in return, pretend that I am nameless and faceless and, when I am in the world of my fellow nameless and faceless service employees, I must be invisible to you.  You have no say about what is said between us, even if it regards you.  This is the fiction that must be maintained if you wish for us to continue to act overjoyed to see you and your money.  Because we do not care, not in any way that would compensate us for the amount of self-denial that goes on every day.  For you to demand that we be subserviant to you and then to demand that we be voiceless and cheerful about it, as well, is to ask too much.  This cannot be done.   Sometimes you will have the misfortune of coming in when we are having a bad day, or just after one of your compatriots in wad-blowing has brutally peed all over our parade.  Sometimes we will not be able to serve you in the way in which you would deem adequate.  We hope this happens rarely and we apologize.  We are human, we will try to do better.  Sometimes you will come in on a bad day.  We will try to be understanding, within limits, within boundaries.  We ask for this kindness to be reciprocal, but know that it is hard, hard to keep track of so many people and so many days.  It is hard to keep track of anybody but yourself, and even that can slip sometimes.  We can't all be the center of the universe at the same time.  Right now it's Keanu Reeves.  And look how well he's handling it. Please know this, we have become as humble as we are ever willing to be.  There is a certain line beyond which we cannot be pushed.  We have to know this line, feel it like a high wall behind us, supporting us.  Otherwise this, all of this, day after day, would be too much.   We know you do not hear us, but it has helped to speak.

      Day Fourteen: Saturday I may sound like a broken record but here it goes: pedestrian passing lanes.  An idea who's time as come. The Other James Bond Store at the other end of the mall is selling Segways.  The James Bond Store across from us is the Pierce Brosnan as James Bond store with lots of very high tech gadgets that exist for no reason other than to show other people how much money you have.  It's a form of potlach- whoever has the most money to throw away without caring wins.  "I'll see your CD player for the shower and raise you a light saber and a bartending robot!  Ha ha!  Feel puny and full of self-loathing before my vast expendable resources of cash, you middle-income tax-paying worms!"  The only possibly useful thing in that store has been their big featured item (On Sale!  Four Days Only!) since July.  It's a Germicidal Air Filter.  How allergic are you if you need a four foot tall filter for every room of your house?  I hate the instructional video that goes with it.  Montage of- long-haired domestic cat, sneezing girl with pigtails, some kind of animated clip of blobby particles, a plant, a gloved hand wiping evil black goo off of a filter- on a never ending loop- long-haired domestic cat, sneezing girl with pigtails, some kind of animated clip of blobby particles, a plant, a gloved hand wiping evil black goo off of a filter, long-haired domestic cat, sneezing girl with pigtails.  All.  Day.  Long.  Yeah, and then there are the light sabers and the robots and the remote controlled cars.  The Other James Bond Store is a little more Sean Connery as James Bond with things that you might actually use, although never need, if you were, I don't know, on a train in Eastern Europe or something.  Super luxurious travel pillows and attache cases with all sorts of bonus features (a la "From Russia With Love") and the occasional Thunderball rocket backpack for good measure.  I don't mean an actual rocket pack, though.  The Segways fall into this category.  Oh my god I want a Segway so bad.  I want to get one and put some kind of giant awe-inspiring bicycle bell on it.  No, not a bike bell, something that simulates the sound of the bell chorus of a cathedral.  No!  Better.  A full surround-sound recording of a Japenese Taiko drum corps.  Imagine me zipping up and down the mall on one of those, people leaping out of my way, cowering, fearing for their very lives.  The power!  And then all I would have to do would be to figure out how to make it invisible, too.  Ohh, the guys at the knife store would friggin start a cult around me if I had an invisible drumming Segway. I used to just want to get a job with benefits, learn Spanish and get a more fuel-efficient car.

      Last night we played "Yes, but what does it DO?"  Trini, Nicolas, Beth and I.  Subject: pewter vessel, approximately two inches high by one inch deep by four inches long, roundly rectangular and in the shape of a coiled snake.  I think the intent was that it was a little card holder for little cards, perhaps business cards, maybe in a pet store, an exotic pet store, you know with the snake motif.  Anyway, why would the computer inventory file be any more right than us?  (Than we?)  (At least I got " urlLink than " right.)  In the spirit of my wanting to see things we sell in a different light, I tried to think of other uses and everyone joined in the fun.  Here's our list: Card holder Single cigarette ashtray Single cigarette ashtray that fits in your pocket, just empty it the next time you find a communal ashtray Very tiny water feature For school teachers to store their chalk Storage for prosthetic eyes (20 minute tangential conversation on whether prosthetic eyes are made of glass, where one could get prosthetic eyes without a, you know, prescription, and whether each of us would go with the glass eye or just the eye patch- me, glass eye all the way; Nicolas, eye patch; Beth, glass eye; Trini was trying to help a customer- how silly of her) Reliquary for a finger bone Storage for the very tiny silverware we also sell Single napkin holder Recipe card stand Candy dish File for paper doll clothes  You can't kill anybody with it, though, so my CSI game didn't work.  Unless you made some kind of magic spell that turned the snake real.  But you'd have to be on drugs to try something that stupid.

      Day Thirteen: Friday (not the 13th, but freaky nonetheless)  Chicken Little goes to the mall. The lovely and talented Mrs. R. W. F*ckyface-McF*ckhead tore hubby a new one last night so he dutifully jogged down to the mall to make it our problem.  Cut the freak a check, Gigi's been saying it since August when he first started becoming such a vocal "good customer."  There are "good customers" (and by "good"  I of course mean "bad") and then there is Mr. R.W. F*ckyface-McF*ckhead and his lovely and talented wifey and their magnificent boxes of hate.  Their $1500 worth of hand-crafted custom-ordered Brazillian cherry wood jewelry boxes for wifey's jewel collection that are never ever going to be perfectly matched enough for wifey, who perpetrates some form of spousal abuse on hubby who runs (I mean literally- he's always sweating every time he comes in and he never uses the phone) to us to complain some more and insist on gift certificates to make up for all his pain and suffering.  We don't want to give him gift certificates because that would mean he would come back to buy more things which will not be perfect enough.  What of our pain and suffering you wackjob?  The problem last night was that the boxes had been delayed (the re-boxes, actually, this is round three of trying to make a set to Mrs. F-McF's psychotic standards) in production.  The excuse was that the boxmaker's wife had had a stroke.  This is very sad.  Very very sad.  But Mr. F*ckyface was not interested in excuses.  "I'm not interested in excuses.  You and I, I think are seeing this situation from very different perspectives," (thought bubble- you got that right, Jim!) "and my perspective is that none of this is very professional.  You need to make this right.  I deserve some kind of compensation."  Beth tried to get a word in edgewise about handmade boxes and how they don't generally match the same way mass produced happy meal pieces of crap do, only she used better language.  "No, I'm not interested in your excuses.  You see, you don't have to live with my wife."  His exact words.  Thought bubble- please, Mr. F*ckyface, do not attempt to use your poor life choice making abilities as a rationale for coming in and peeing on our parade.  Rather than shooting another $1200 on a jewelry box that will not be right, will never be right-- the box is only a symptom, don't you see?-- I'm thinking our sweaty boy's pocket cash is better spent on a vicious pit bull divorce lawyer. It capped a lovely evening shift which had started with the ceiling falling in after a recent rainstorm and flooding all the fancy cutting boards.  Our industrial carpet looks like something large peed on it. Good thing I didn't have to handle Mr. F-McF (I was playing in the backstock area when he came in- plus I called neverending "not it" on this one a long time ago.)  I wouldn't have been able to hear much of what he said over the pounding in my ears.  Even overhearing it made my blood boil.  Happy thought bubbles, I kept saying to myself, happy thought bubbles.  Professor Plum with the scrimshaw letter opener at the cash register.   Today is Friday, but it is my Wednesday.  We got three seasonal employees and a van ful of freight which we could not unpack because of the problem of shipping a giant concrete chicken (one of our bestsellers) across country.   I gotta tell ya, though, the peppermint mochas at Starbucks- yum yum.

      Day Twelve, Thursday Only 35 shopping days left until X-Mas!  Come on you people!  Get off your lazy duffs and get to the friggin mall!  The economy sucks, I can't find a job in my chosen area of professional expertise (that master's degree I mentioned?  it's in library science), I'm in a wage freeze at my current job and I have this spanky sleek new silent-keyboard accessorized black ninja computer to start making payments on in February.  I need a damn Christmas bonus this year like nobody's biz-ness.  Help a shop girl out, will ya? Oh sheesh.  You're all shopping online, you lot of shut-ins.  I know you.  "The point is ladies and gentlemen that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of it's forms - greed for life, for money, knowledge - has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed - you mark my words - will not only save Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you. "  Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas),  Wall Street

      Day Ten, Tuesday I have a new special name for the Other Old Guy who works across the way at the James Bond Store.  I have special names for everyone who works there, like the names field researchers give chimps in National Geographic specials, these names reflect some visible trait of the subject.  Initially all subjects are given default names based on some observation made on their first day and their new place in the workplace hierarchy.  Tank Top Girl was so named because she started in the summer and on her first day wore a striped tank top, which we happened to know went against company dress code.  She never wore it again, but the name stuck until the I got the scuttlebutt from Kate, my smoker informant who shares cigs and matches with the crew from across the way (who are all nicotine freaks, unlike our crew where there's only Kate) that Tank Top Girl's real name was Jane and she had been made an Assistant Manager.  Then she became Assistant Manager Jane.  Then there was New Guy, Hot New Guy, Newer Hot New Guy who was eventually demoted to just Goateed Guy (said facial hair decision had the opposite of the usual effect on this one), the Beacon (fired a few months ago and then that night cleaned the place out of as much merchandise as he could fit in his Jetta), Manager Dan and Asian Manager- who became Hawaiian Manager on Tuesday, again thanks to information from Kate.  There's Tall Byronic Guy and the Junior Perv, who used to be Spiky because of his hair but got his new name from the close bond he formed with the Dirty Old Man, aka The DOM or The Dommer.  Those two (Byron and Spiky) started on the same day but Byron soon decided to make it clear that he was on another plane from the Junior Perv, as on his breaks he let JP make lewd comments to the Victoria's Secret employees while he, Byron, sat on the other break bench, smoking and reading- hardbacks, no less.  Hot New Guy eventually got his name changed to Fight Club for showing up one Sunday with his face rearranged before eventually transferring to another store.  I was sad when he left, we were nodding friends at the coffee cart- we'd both be there ordering at the same time and we'd nod in aknowledgement of each other, except on the Sunday morning he showed up with his face rearranged, he didn't make eye contact.  Then there's the New Assistant Manager, who replaced Jane, who quit, and the Jedi Jerk, formerly Bearded New Guy until his obsession with the light sabers they sell across the way became apparent.  And the Other Old Guy, who will now be known as the Unnecessary Avenger, due to his actions the other night when he "rescued" me and Trini from three twelve year olds.    Day Eleven, Wednesday, my day off I will record in more detail the stories of The DOM and the Unnecessary Avenger in a future entry, so stay tuned.  Today I just want to sit around not being at work and reading   You Shall Know Our Velocity   because I have to take it back to the library tomorrow and I'm only on page 140.

      "I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. You know, as a career, I don't want to do that."  --Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack)  Say Anything   (Thank you, www.imdb.com!)  Day Eight was ten hours and fifteen minutes long.  But at the end there was cheese and crackers and a speech on the company business plan.  Day Nine- Monday I don't think I am imagining that Kate does like me better now that I am peeved at Alice.  Oh la, the drama. Today in the restroom I encountered a very well-coached child.  She had red hair and a bright green dress on and her mother was in the stall.  The little girl (age maybe 3, maybe 4) was waiting out by the sinks.  As I walked into the restroom- there was no one else in there- the little girl yelled loudly and commandingly at me, "Don't take me!  Don't take me away!"

      Day Seven: Saturday, another day off because I swapped shifts. Typing up my little story about the man with the mugs reminded me of my all time favorite "what are these for?" moment.   Having so many things that are not mass-produced in one store often causes customer confusion.  Without divisions like "Housewares" and "Home Decor" or packages or marketing strategies they are sometimes at a loss trying to think of what function particular items that we carry perform.  The little pianos made out of coconut shells are one such puzzler.  "What is it?"  "It's a tiny thumb piano.  You play it with your thumbs."  "Yes, but what does it DO?"   Two Christmases ago we started carrying these fancy glass vases by a woman who had previously specialized in ultra tiny, elfin perfume bottles.  She had branched out into these vases that I had called the amoeba vases because they had weird shapes, were very squat and flat and had strange protrusions that were nothing but decorative.  She herself used the word "whimsical."  They were mostly in bright neon colors and cost on average $150 a piece and were very very fragile.  Being familiar with the perfume bottles that could only hold about 3 molecules of eau de toilet, I saw these vases as being something entirely in the "non-functional" section of our merchandise.  I was showing three to a customer, displaying them side by side on the counter, using the word "whimsical" and making some comment about the great colors when another woman, walking by, glanced at the show and exclaimed to her friend, loudly, "Oh, look at those gorgeous ash trays!"   Just last week, I got the sequel.  Woman, examining an $800 glass platter, asked me, "Is this food safe?"  I get too boxed in thinking of things we sell as art.  If she wants to spend $800 on that thing and then take it home and serve salad out of it, that would  make one freakin' cool dinner party and I would very much like to go.  Recently, due to my obsession with "CSI" I've been examining each new piece of merchandise for its suitability as a murder weapon.  We actually have a very high number of things that could do serious damage and yet be easily swabbed free of fingerprints and other trace evidence.  If this sounds sinister, don't read the next sentence.  When "good customers" come in and I start to experience the warning symptoms of "retail rage", it calms me to gaze upon our selection of causes of death.  Miss Scarlet at the cash register with the giant glass starfish.  I can't imagine working in the fancy knife store.  They're having a sale this week, by the way, all swords are 20% off.

      Day six was Friday: Shipment day.  Gigi and I like shipment days because both of us prefer to be in the back room unpacking things than out on the floor talking to people, trying to keep a straight face when they ask us dumb questions. Such as- (Now I'm going to do that thing I do where I set up the situation in great detail because the incongruity of these kinds of remarks really depends on context and I'm trying to be a good little anthropologist and provide this rich tapestry of context.)  Tall, handsome guy comes up to the counter, looks good, dresses good enough to be a contestant on a reality show involving some kind of romance, looks like he probably has a BA in something serious and professionally marketable and whatever job he has, he probably has authority over other people.  He's holding two ceramic mugs.  Not the whimsical mugs with the sort of dancing Alice in Wonderland tea-party shapes and colors, not the ooky fish-head mugs that look a little too much like actual fish heads that have actually been cut off of dead actual fish, just two basic ceramic mugs.  Cylindrical, handle midway down one side, blue with a little pattern around the bottom.  A nice matched set.  One in each hand.  "Are these for, like, drinking coffee from or something?"

      Day Five was Thursday- We dusted all the glass.  We have a lot of glass.  Hand-blown, hand-made glass martini glasses, glass vases, glass octopi (a big seller) big, gargantuan glass platters that cost several hundred dollars.  If you own a lot of handblown glass, I recommend those dusting cloths (your brand of choice) that "grab" dirt using patented dust-grabbing technology of some kind.  My theory is that these little wonders make use of static electricity and I frankly can't get enough of them.  Beth for some reason thinks that this patented technology, whatever it is, probably involves toxic chemicals and therefore causes cancer, so it takes her and Trini together twice as long to do half as much dusting because they use paper towels and windex on everything.  I didn't break anything, so that's always cause for celebration.  Customers like to come in and make funny funny jokes about my breaking things.  When THEY break things, the first thing out of their mouth is usually- "I didn't do it!"  It's like a reflex.  Unless their kid does it, in which case it's about a fifty fifty split between those that humiliate the child loudly in the middle of the store (of course never offering to pay for the damage) and those that just grab the kid and run away. We may have strict return policies and no sales ever, but I have never seen any manager in the time I've worked here ever even suggest to a customer that they had to pay for something they broke.

      Day Four: My other day off.  Yes, I have split days off, but I prefer to think of it as getting two Fridays a week.  I was talking recently with two of my cousins.  My cousin Margaret Katherine (still changing names, changing names like a mad fiend) has an after school job working at the returns center of a major department store.  Okay, screw it, Target.  My cousin Caitlin teaches special needs children.  Margaret Katherine and I were swapping psycho customer stories.  Margaret Katherine contributed one about a woman bringing back approximately $243 worth of wedding gifts- which she had registered for- a year and two months later with no receipts and demanding cash back.  MK explained the 90 day return policy and the woman flipped out on her and- here's the fun part- even though MK was basically reading the woman the return policy as it was posted in about 87 places right in front of her- the woman refused to believe her because, "You can't possibly be a day over 32!"  MK is 17.  Offended at being mistaken for someone over 30, but not about to appall this woman further by revealing she didn't even have a diploma, MK gladly went and fetched a senior manager (who was almost 23) to come and go through the same recitation of the return policy with the woman.    Caitlin: "Why didn't you just punch her in the face?"  (Special ed teacher, remember?) MK: "Security cameras.  I tell ya, if there weren't security cameras, I'd be punching people in the face all day long." And MK actually  likes  this job.  "Well you know it's going to be all right. I think it's going to be all right. Everything will always be all right When we go shopping." Barenaked Ladies

      "Writing up fieldnotes requires a block of concentrated time.  Incidents that span a few minutes may take the ethnographer several hours to write up, she tries to recall just who did what and said what, in what order, and to put all that into words and coherent paragraphs.  Indeed, an ethnographic maxim holds that every hour spent observing requires an additional hour to write up."  Emerson, Fretz & Shaw page 39  Day Three: Tuesday Riddle me this- a day to honor those who have fought for their country.  Hey, let's have a big sale!  Thought process?  It was busy, but I still had time to observe the employees in the store across the way.  Names will be protected- let's just call it the "James Bond Store" because they sell super expensive gadgetry that NOBODY needs.  Yes, you know the one. I record my observations in the form of haiku-  #1 (9:46am) The Dirty Old Man needs to get in, so he knocks shave and a haircut.  #2 (11:10am) Junior Perv does a soft-shoe by the robot that beeps and brings you drinks.  #3 (11:12am) Tall Byronic Guy can't dance.  He sits, aloof, in the Massage Chair.  #4 (2:00 pm) Asian Manager drives mini remote control cars to pick up chicks.  #5 (2:13pm) Asian Manager has a thing for the blonde at the baseball card store.  #6 (5:00pm) Jane, the Tank Top Girl makes assistant manager, gives two weeks notice.  #7 (5:45pm) Manager Dan takes fourteenth smoke break today.  Keep it together, Dan.

      "You get your PhD. How happy you will be when you get a job at Wendy's and are honored with Employee of the Month." Barenaked Ladies,   Never Is Enough    Day Two: It's a Monday I work in a store in a mall in the suburbs.  My official title is "Sales Associate."  The store I work in sells one of a kind handcrafted artwork.  Furniture pieces, ceramic dishware, jewelry, handblown glass vases, wood jewelry boxes.  We're known for having "classy" gifts.  We're a satellite store of a larger store/ "Gallery" located in the downtown area of the city of which we are a suburb.  (I'm trying to keep this all nice and vague and anonymous to protect the innocent and/or myself for the moment.)  The downtown "Gallery" (henceforth to be called "DT") gets a downtown clientele.  We get a mall clientele.  Same merchandise, fantastically different experience, but some tricks are apparently universal. Today's gold star customer award went to an elderly gentleman who I will call "Marbles Man."  This man came in with a gentleman who was either his clone or his life partner- they were dressed identically and the body language was of two people with some sort of physical need to be constantly in step with each other.  "Marbles Man" wanted to look at our glass marbles, of which we have quite a selection.  Normally these are locked up in a case, due to their being, obviously, highly shopliftable.  In order for this gentleman to browse, I had to open the case for him and then leave the door open.  If the case is open, I cannot leave it unattended.  Unless I want to get a well-deserved termination of my employment.  Man needs to browse, case is open, conclusion: I have to stand around nearby but not too near until he is finished.  I also cannot leave him to help other customers who, coming in partway through the procedure do not understand that I am already otherwise occupied (with open case duty) and think I am strange and rude for dishing them off to Gigi or Barb (names changed to protect me).  So it is awkward for about 35 minutes for me, but hey, at least it's not mucking out the restrooms or parachuting into a burning forest, so I can't really complain.  I'm just establishing the scenario for you here.  Probably too extensively.  The point I wanted to make was that this man occupied my time for 35 minutes, while he selected 27 marbles.  Which was quite a sale- marbles run $15 at least a pop.  So I was pleased enough to wait 35 minutes.  It was actually better than running all over the store with someone.  I'm thinking this is a pretty good morning.  Until he says: "You're going to give me a 10% discount." Our store does not give discounts.  We do not have sales.  We don't even give refunds.  We have all kinds of super strict rules about stuff, since we sell everything on consignment.  Anyway, store policy, no discounts.  But he didn't even phrase it in the form of a question.  "We don't really do bulk purchase discounts," I reply. "But you're going to give me one," says Marbles Man.  He didn't say, "Little lady," but he may as well have.  He did that looking down his nose at me thing that my algebra teacher used to do when I got caught passing a note in class.  What Marbles Man did not know is that, if this was his move to intimidate me it was going to backfire because even if DT authorized me to give this man a discount, I was going to be super snotty to him about it now because about once a week some older man tries the exact same thing on me so it stopped working about a year ago and now just annoys me. "I'd have to get a manager to authorize that." "Well, then you do that." Thought bubble--"Yes, you bet I WON'T." So I chase Barb down and in hushed tones tell her that this man has demanded a bulk discount.  Barb gets on the phone to DT.  Turns out the guy was just at the DT store and tried the same thing and they turned him down.  When we tell him that DT has refused to authorize a bulk discount he threatens to take his business elsewhere and we say, "OK," which seems to confuse him.  He and his partner leave, stiffly. You can have whatever opinions you want about whether or not our store should give bulk discounts.  My point is that, first of all, it was tacky of this gent to try to talk his way into a discount at both stores in the same day, and second, what I have learned working at this type of store is that people really do go shopping with the belief that "The Customer is Always Right" and that every store should be willing to do anything to make a sale and accommodate a "good customer."  And everyone always describes themselves as a  "good customer."  Here's the behind the scenes dish, people: anyone who feels the need to remind us that they are a "good customer" is usually remembered as a big pain in the arse.  The good customers usually don't draw attention to themselves, they just come in regularly and treat people well and even if they don't spend the big bucks, they usually get little perks like free gift wrap or extended layaway periods, just for being nice regular folks.  Deeds, not words, folks.  Be kind to your fine feathered sales associate.  Because we talk about you behind your back. On the internet no less.  "Telling people what they want to hear Telling people anything to make a sale. Eating in the food court With the old and the bored. I think never is enough, yeah, never is enough I never want to do that stuff." Barenaked Ladies

      New thought, but related- Somewhat scary that the DOM, being a James Bond store employee, would be more closely related to my tribe of retail than one of the women at the nordies makeup counter, who would naturally be the prey of the DOM and therefore somebody whom I would naturally have sympathy for.

      I went to the mall on my day off yesterday.  My friend dragged me along on an excursion to the Nordies makeup counter.  Not someplace I would ever go on my own.  I made the determination while meandering around there and trying not to look like a shoplifter among all the overdressed, perfume-soaked older women that Nordies retail culture is as different from my retail culture as British culture is from American culture.  The language is generally cross-intelligible, but the slang is all off and you'd be hard put to find anyone on either side who would think they were interchangeable.  I may have to go back and record more observations, go further in depth behind these first impressions.

      I know.  I have been a lousy  urlLink embed  this holiday season.  The quirky stuff doesn't happen during Christmas for the most part.  Or at least it hasn't.  It's just more more more of the standard of what we get year round.  A lady called me yesterday asking about the return policy.  She started out by saying she knew it was a long shot, so I can't really throw her in the "dumb-ass customer story" bin.  She knew she was asking for a lot, but she was obviously hard up for cash and willing to try anything.  She had bought some glass Christmas ornaments- last year.  She wanted to return them this year.  For cash.  Because for some reason which I couldn't really follow, she had to adopt 26 cats.  And the 26 cats are running all over her house now and she can't put any Christmas decorations up because the cats will break them and she needs money for cat food so can she return the ornaments?  There were so many ways in which this was completely outside the realm of what we could do I didn't even have to hesitate in telling her we couldn't help her, but I tried to be extra nice about it.  Because she even apologized for calling during such a busy time of year. Counterpoint: phone shoppers.  We need any sales we can get, it's true, but the phone shoppers are such a major pain in all our asses nobody wants to pick up the phone anymore.  What cheeses me off about phone shoppers is that we always ALWAYS end up finding out that they live just 10 minutes from the mall and the reason they are trying to buy things over the phone is that "the mall is just so crazy, there's no way I'm coming down there."  And then they get snippy when you try to put them on hold while you help somebody at the counter.  It's busy so I can't come into the store, but I'll call you when I know it's busy.  Phone customers have second priority.  If you did come down the store and had to wait while I talked on the phone before helping you, you are the exact same person who would raise a bigger stink than anybody.  The simple solution is that if you are going to phone shop- please do not do it during the same time that everyone else is trying to shop in person.  Try calling early in the day or late in the evening when we're sitting around restocking everything.  But no, just like senior citizens who can go on vacation any time in the year they want, but choose to clog up the freeways 4th of July weekend with their RVs just like all the rest of the working stiffs, phone shoppers want to shop at the same time as everyone else.  So we do our best, but then comes the pickup, because it's too late now to ship, so they have to come in anyway at some point.  But no, thanks to cel phones, they've even gotten around that now-- they want to call from the parking lot and have us run out and stand by the mall entrance and hand off the package to them- that was the suggestion of the day yesterday.   Arrrrghgh!  Some days.  Some people.  I want to just sigh deeply into the phone and say, "You.  You you you.  You should just not be allowed to have money."

      Man walks up to register today.  (Oh, don't get excited, it's not going to be funny.)  Announces himself with a huge sigh.  "Finally, my shopping is done.  Three weeks of hell are over!"  And he meant it.  This guy was just destroyed by the holiday shopping season.  Nola and I just looked at him, blank but mildly eager face- Shopgirl Default Setting.  "Oh," he said, seeming to remember himself, "It's probably worse for you guys."  For some reason there is an unspoken taboo on shopgirl bitching about holiday shopping to shoppers.  So Nola and I just sort of shrugged, "We'll sigh a big sigh of relief when we close on Christmas Eve," was my only response.  I wonder why we didn't just say, dude, you have no idea, NO IDEA.   The other day, Alice struck up a conversation with our UPS pickup guy who is super nice and of what you would call a generally sunny disposition, but for some reason I always have a perverse compulsion to say something complainy or smart-assy every time he comes in so I think he doesn't much care for me.  Anyway, he likes Alice and Nola and he REALLY likes Kate, but everyone likes Kate.  Blondes.  He likes blondes.  Returning to the topic of conversation, Alice asked him how his holiday season was going and even though he always seems to be in kind of a hurry, especially between Thanksgiving and Christmas, that day he paused at our counter and went off for about five minutes listing off various incidents of people driving stupid in the parking lot.  This guy's route is the mall- he basically spends all day driving in circles around the mall parking lot and then back and forth to his UPS hQ.  So holiday parking lot behavior has a major impact on his day, even though he gets to park pretty much wherever he wants.  But he was so glad to have somewhere to vent his spleen about parking lot ettiquette.  And he did it in a way that made it clear he saw us as being on the same side- UPS drivers and shopgirls against the shoppers.  It's a seige mentality this time of year and yer either fer us or agin us. When I go into stores to finish up my shopping I always want to let the people know somehow that I'm one of the good guys- I'm in the club- I work behind a register, too.  The mall actually sponsors some of this behavior by encouraging stores to give mall employee discounts- for example I can get a discount at the shoe store, even though I don't work at the shoe store, I just work down the mall from the shoe store.  "You're one of us."   There's a hierarchy the rest of the year- I'll make note of that later- but during x-mas it's all of us together, even the Santa elves, who are only seasonal help and who always cut in line in the women's restroom.

      I have been under for the past few days.  Deep under.  It does not improve.  I'm in a perpetual Thursday- no matter what day it is, it seems my day off is still one day away.  Tomorrow the mall goes to full holiday hours: 8am-11pm.  Please do the math.  This is insane.   I'm very excited about Sandra winning "Survivor."  This has nothing to do with retail, I just am. Making a sociological observation, even though I just got off a nine hour shift of nonstop Christmas rush, trying to fulfill my field note duties.  A typical cash register transaction takes about 2 minutes- the floor person hands off some item or items to the boxer, who pulls off the price tag and begins the boxing procedure which is either straightforward (earrings) or freakishly ass-paining (raku-fired wall-hanging kimono).  Customer steps up to the counter, ringer asks, "What do we have for you?" customer blanks utterly for a few seconds and then recovers, describing objects now already being swaddled in tissue paper and boxes.  Simultaneously, the boxer is handing off the price tags, which are used to ring up the items, and telling the ringer in secret store code language what the items REALLY are.  The ringer plugs the codes into the computer.  Hopefully the items are in the system, but if they are not, the ringer has to generate a description of them from scratch, this is called an NNI and is sucky for the ringer and later on for the inventory manager.  We hate NNI's, they are the enemy.  We are experiencing an epidemic of NNIs this week.  It has to do with stock getting moved around between stores.  Anyway, the ringer plugs the things into the computer, gives the customer a total, they then hand over cash, check, gift certificate or credit card.  Ring through the register, ring through the credit card processor, copy out info on check from drivers license, run check through scanner, process travelers checks and gift certificates through the ritualistic systems required by each, scribble on cash with the magic marker that detects counterfeits (what do we do if it comes up the wrong color, by the way?  Call the feds?  Mall security?  Refuse the bill?  Nobody has told me, but I color away faithfully).  Mark method of payment on store copy of receipt, hand back credit card and customer copy of receipt and instruct customer to please step around to the other side of the counter and await their packages.  Do the hokey pokey and turn your self around.  Also-- answer phone. "Thank you for calling Gallery X." "Yes, do you sell pottery?" "Yes, we do." "I was wondering, do you have any artists that have a last name like Evans or Evers or..." "We have an artist named Evans..." "Engles or Anderson or maybe now that I look at it it could be Elvis.  Anyway, I have this ceramic bowl, it's sort of blue and iridescent and clear and I guess maybe it's glass, actually.  And the artist's name is signed on the bottom, it looks like he used a pen, and it's very swoopy and he's got a... a big swoop at the end, and it's definitely an S now that I look at it..." "Our Evans is a ceramic artist and he carves his name in the bottom, he doesn't use a pen..." "And it's a very round bowl, almost a complete ball, really, more of a vase I guess and..." "And our Evans only works in like blues and greens..." (thought bubble-- what the hell do you WANT???) "Anyway, my son works at [Department Store X] and about fifteen years ago they had a bunch of these in some display and he got this one for very cheap.  Anyway, I just love it and I was wondering if I could order some more.  Does it sound familiar to you?" "It doesn't sound like anything we carry."  (Meanwhile, I have, thanks to a chatty boxer, been able to ring through about three customers while this woman natters on.) "Well, that's okay, can you think of anywhere where I can find it?" (Thought bubble...  ?!?!?!?) "Not really, I'm very sorry." "Well, who do you think might know where I could find some more?" (Thought bubble... hang up, hang up now.) "I suggest that you contact [Department Store X] and see if they can help you."  [CLICK] Saturday, 2pm, one and one half weeks before x-mas.  Like one week before Hanukkah (to use the spelling I see here on my desk calendar).  I really wish I could eavesdrop on the runaround this woman will get if she does call Department Store X. Anyway, 2 minutes per transaction times 60 minutes an hour times 7.5 hours-- plus phone conversations and answering any random questions from customers on the floor-- figure about 260 conversations a day.  260.  Actually, that's misleading to say 260 conversations a day.  It's really the same conversation with 260 people.  The weather-- it's bad.  The mall is crowded/ hot/ not too bad.  Wow, those kids lined up to see Santa are sure loud/ cute/ not well-behaved.  Christmas/ Hanukkah/ solstice is only [number] days away!  I'm almost done with shopping/ I've just started shopping.  My [mother in law/ sister/ girlfriend/ son] is so hard to shop for.  This is the perfect gift!  Can she exchange it?  Why don't you guys do giftwrapping?  260 times a day.  Smile, be sincere, be engaged.  You try it.  Go ahead.   I'll tell you a BIG secret, too.  I hate people.  I'm very shy.  This is the longest running performance art piece ever.  Every night this week, come on down, we're open until 11pm now. And the season's hottest sweater is 50% off.

      The computer crashed on Friday night.  Blue screened and toastered.  They weren't able to close the books out.  All day Saturday- the first Saturday of December- we made sales using handwritten receipts and a 16 year old casio printing calculator.  For all that, FOR ALL THAT, once the new computer (just as error-riddled as the old computer, for the record) was installed, we were only missing a dollar, A SINGLE DOLLAR, from the till.   I wish I had some kind of heartwarming story to tell you about humanity perservering in the loss of technology and customers all of a sudden becoming more sympathetic and kindhearted when we revealed our loss of a computer, but most of them seemed lost in Christmas Shopping Craze, which has the same outward symptom set as college freshmen deep in the middle of their first hell week.  Everyone is in the same boat, but everyone is in their own head, all on a mission but not really sure what the mission is, just that they only have a few days until one way or another it's all over.  For the general public this year, buying is not a joyful thing, it's more of a duty and it's something most people seem hellbent on getting over and done with.  Like preventative surgery.

      I spent my day off Wednesday being nice to people of my own free will.  Not because I was being paid to.  It was lovely and refreshing. Today I am beat.  It's starting to get to me.  It really is.  Everything is tired and hurts- feet, back, head, brain, eyes, arms, fingers, ears, soul, nose. And the season's hottest sweater is still $24.50, for those of you tracking this particular plotline.

      My brother asked me if I thought Hard Core Santa's only gig was being Santa at Christmas at the mall, like did he earn enough getting his lap peed on for 27 days straight to support himself the rest of the year.  I doubt it's possible, although wouldn't it be fabulous if it were true?  I can't imagine Hard Core Santa doing much else the rest of the year, except maybe being an astronomer or a portrait painter or dishing out raw vigilante justice.

      The Mall Santa has arrived.  He is hard-core Santa.  Those people you know who go to renn faires dressed in full costume and talk in British accents and refer to their girlfriends as "wenches."  He's the Santa equivalent.  The beard is real.  The "Ho ho ho" is genuine, and he uses it in conversation with adults and mall management.  He has a staff with real silver bells on it and I have never seen him so much as flinch when a kid goes into a Santa rage and starts screaming, even though the acoustics of that mall intersection where Santa's Lodge (more on that in a minute) is located multiply and amplify child-pitched sounds to psy-ops levels of ear pain tolerance. By the way, Santa's Lodge.  It's two stories tall and has a ski ramp for snowmen on the roof.  It's a two-dimensional set, but from the front, it looks as though the three-car garage with the Lexus SUV and the John Deere is just off the side beneath the escalator.  Since when does Santa have a lodge?  Thinking about it I couldn't quite remember what it was that Santa had- I guess maybe a cottage out behind the toy workshop- but it was never no suburban 4 bdrm, 3.5 bath split level like this thing.  I think Hard Core Santa probably yearns for the cottage years, but the mall management wishes to create the illusion of opulence and economic upswing.  It is a myth, I tell you from the front lines people, it is a myth.   Hard Core Santa bears up in silence.  Chester the Talking Christmas Bear down by JCP's is keeping it real, though.  He's been around so long you can see the gears that move his big giant head around through a gap in his threadbare fur.  He has a little cottage, but the silvering on the one-way glass has started to peel and today I saw even the kiddikins still short enough to be allowed into Playland guessing that the wizard behind Chester the Talking Bear was inside.   When the kiddikins leave, Chester the Talking Bear also likes to chat up passing honeys.  "Hey," says Chester out of the blue as I walk by with my peppermint mocha, "So, what's going on?  What are you going to do tonight?"  Hard Core Santa would be tsking his tongue behind his genuine authentic beard, but then he would take a look around at the snowmen snowboarding down his roof and would silently go home to stare at himself in the mirror, combing his beard and polishing his silver bells in a brooding Santa silence.

      Nola has not been laid off, but Nola does not appear on the schedule.  We try not to believe that there is anything nefarious in this, but it is now becoming apparent that the left hand is only rarely aware of what the right hand is doing so that while the right hand is offering us candy, the left hand is shoving us out the door.  As a consolation, Nola and yours truly have been given the special job of coming in after closing on our days off and cleaning the light fixtures for extra cash.  The sad part is that I'd rather be doing that than helping customers, anyway. Nola has a job interview somewhere else in the mall on Tuesday, though, so she could be making a getaway very soon.  I am insanely jealous, but very happy for her.

      I love it, so I'm sharing: check out  urlLink GA-GA  at asininepoetry.   Ha ha!  They'll call us MIND GORILLA!  Ha ha ha!  Believe it or not, right this minute I'm writing cover letters for job applications.  You can see why I might be going slightly bucky.  I'm not a natural at business correspondence whoring, so I'm having to fall back on my Performance Art.  I imagine myself as a product and also as the TV voice over artist hired to sell the product and we're both trapped inside some kind of radioactive chamber, like in "The Fly" and the freakshow that emerges writes my cover letters.   Gak, I really hate this process.  Anybody just want to GIVE me a job?  Like a good job?   I'd like a job finding information for people.  Not like private investigator type information or weapons of mass destruction type information, just, y'know, information.  That's out there, in files and books and internet bboards.  Floating around out there.  I'll be a deap-sea info fisherperson.  For hire.  You come to me and ask me a question and I'll say, "Yes, I think I know what you're looking for, that reminds me of something," and I roll my luxury office chair over to my file cabinet (because in my fantasy I have file cabinets- I fantasize about file cabinets- I am a BIG NERD) and pull out a magazine article or something.  And that's just the start, because then I go through the article and I start looking up all the people quoted in it and stuff that they wrote.  And at the end of the week I have put it all together into a multi-media CDROM presentation which is so high-production quality and friggin infotaining that you call all your friends over to watch it with you and they all become total info junkies and all of you give me lots of money and eventually I can buy a houseboat and write a book about my experience and get to meet Keanu Reeves personally when he plays my boyfriend in the Oscar-nominated biopic. So who's on board with this?   Come on you space ponies, I'm making mashed potatoes without the lumps! (Daily bonus points to anyone who can figure out who I'm quoting there.)

      Followed this link from  urlLink Ms. Frizzle .  Just so happens I got the same result she did.  Although if I weren't a sonnet, I could be a  urlLink Blank Verse .  Today is a Blank Verse day, for sure.         I am the  sonnet , never quickly thrilled; Not prone to overstated gushing praise Nor yet to seething rants and anger, filled With overstretched opinions to rephrase; But on the other hand, not fond of fools, And thus, not fond of people, on the whole; And holding to the sound and useful rules, Not those that seek unjustified control. I'm balanced, measured, sensible (at least, I think I am, and usually I'm right); And when more ostentatious types have ceased, I'm still around, and doing, still, alright. In short, I'm calm and rational and stable - Or, well, I am, as much as I am able.     What Poetry Form Are You?

      The observers become the observed... The Gadget Porn store is suffering the January Retail doldrums.  We polish silver, they play with remote control cars.   It's all men over there now, ever since Tank Top Girl quit clear back in October.  Tall Byronic Guy came over last night.  Came over probably to talk to Kate.  I see him wandering around a lot on slow evenings.  Hawaiian Manager has his lady friends down at the baseball card store, TBG likes us and the girls down at our silver jewelry competetor store.  He thinks we like him.  He's better than Junior Perv, but through guilt by association they're all suspect over there.  He was nice enough, but as Kate and I were standing at the counter and he was talking to Kate about how boring it was over there, he pointed and we saw that Jedi Jerk and, to my chagrin and dismay, Replacement Guy were observing us through the night-vision binoculars.  I had such high hopes for Replacement Guy.  He wears designer frame glasses and looks like a grown-up Wesley Crusher and I've never seen him on the smokers' bench.  I thought he might be quality.  Maybe he was just led astray in a moment of weakened boredness by the Jedi Jerk.  Kate told TBG to go tell them to knock it off.   "Who knows how high-powered those things are?" she said to me.  "They can probably see inside our pores and stuff."  I still am not quite comfortable enough with Kate to have voiced aloud my suspicion that skin tone wasn't what they were probably making note of.

      Water cooler chit chat at work.  We don't have a water cooler so we all stand around the register.  Normally this is discouraged, but sometimes I think it drastically improves morale and can be very very productive.  For example today, we made a totally non-professional diagnosis of what the hell is wrong with Bob, the Sucky Computer Consultant.  We have decided, based on our collective knowledge on the subject gained from a) watching one episode of "Law and Order" in which expert testimony delivered by actors covered the subject, b) one NPR piece one time that somebody heard while they were driving and c) some articles that Trini read for her previous job-- that Bob the Computer Consultant is autistic.  Whether or not he actually is is beside the point because we all decided he was and therefore decided that was how we were going to deal with him whenever he called.  And then he called three times and the first time Barb talked to him like she always did and he got all flustered and annoyed with her and was very rude and she got upset.  The next time he called, she dealt with him keeping in mind our new diagnosis and things went swimmingly.  Ditto for conversation number three.  So the new rule for talking to Bob is to just let him get through his rehearsed speech, give him very specific details of any problems the computer is having- give him the details repeatedly if he asks, don't use metaphors or slang and then hang up.  This seems to make him happy.  Which makes us happy.

      What is Perpetual Thursday?  Perpetual Thursday is always being one day away from your next day off.  Which can be great, you only have one day left to go, right?  Better than Perpetual Monday, or Perpetual Sunday evening, that's for dang sure.  But imagine if it were always the week before summer vacation and never actually got to summer vacation.  Yeah, sucky, right?  Today is a Monday which is a Thursday- being in retail I work over the weekend and get Wednesday and Thursday off.  Although, now with the cutting back of hours, getting to work on Sunday is considered a privilege rather than a duty.  A gift of wage-earning.  It's slightly absurd and reminds me of the Monty Python  urlLink 4 Yorkshiremen sketch .     Right. I had to get up in the morning at ten o'clock at night, half an hour before I went to bed, eat a lump of cold poison, work twenty-nine hours a day down mill, and pay mill owner for permission to come to work, and when we got home, our Dad would kill us, and dance about on our graves singing "Hallelujah."   Not that bad, of course, just the line about having to pay for permission to come to work.  That's how it feels sometimes, like the gallery has become a Home For Wayward ShopGirls and we should all just be grateful for our opportunity to show up however many days we get put on the schedule.  Better I guess than having to backstab each other to get hours, like my cousin who works for a certain home furnishings store that has a commission policy wherein you get hours based on your dollar sales.  You start out at 14 hours a week.  If you make big bucks for the store in those 14 hours, the next week you might get 18 and somebody who was at 18 who didn't use their hours as wisely gets knocked back.  I've barely got the personality to do retail in the first place, I'd not make it to the second week at a place like that.  If it were really Perpetual Thursday, of course, the payoff would be that I could watch "CSI" 365 days a year.   I forgot to watch the "Golden Globe Awards" last night.  Well, except for the fifteen minutes where Diane Keaton won (her outfit was so classy) and Johnny Depp lost (but he lost to Bill Murray, so it was okay).  The whole procedure reminded me of my 9th grade awards ceremony.  Everyone was more concerned about who was sitting at the cool kids table and what their hair looked like than who was winning stuff.  Including me.    I am then reminded of the "Saturday Night Live" sketches about the uber-exclusive men's clothing store, particularly the episode with Sean Hayes where he says to Jimmy Fallon something along the lines of, "You know, this store was so much cooler before they put in that entrance."  10 minutes of determined googling were not fruitful at producing a transcript, apologies for not citing my source properly.

      If you're not interested in making comments or in adding comments to your own blog, you could go amuse yourself by reading about the  urlLink candy of the future . Soon, soon, children, I will be writing book reviews and movie reviews and TV reviews here.  Soon also I will be talking about the weird people that I observe in public places and totally fabricating tragic homelives and childhoods for them.  I will be tackling Big Philosophical Issues and I will be complaining about my cat's sudden tendency to get psychotically aggressive while I'm trying to read.  The mall will also continue to make award-winning guest appearances.   Look for future commentary on the  urlLink Golden Globe awards , if I remember to watch them. Here are my picks, we'll see what kind of jackpots I hit tomorrow night. Best Movie (Drama)- haven't seen any of them, but based on something my uncle said, I'm going with "Mystic River." Best Actress (Movie, Drama)- haven't seen any of them, but I always like Cate Blanchett Best Actor (Movie, Drama)- haven't seen 'em.  Gotta go with Jude Law, though, because he's pretty. Best Picture (funny or musical)- Only saw "Bend it Like Beckham" which was super amusing, had a great soundtrack.  But not award-winning.  I'm going with "Big Fish" even though I didn't see it because I love Tim Burton. Actress- funny or musical- Haven't seen any, (we'll just assume from now on that I haven't seen anything in the movie categories unless noted otherwise and if you think this is a problem, I figure this is how the Oscars probably get voted on anyway, so keep that in mind) and I'm sure Scarlett Johansen probably will get it, but I like Helen Mirren. Actor- Comedy Movie- JOHNNY G#DD#MN DEPP!!  Who is the winner even if everybody else says otherwise.  So there. Foreign Language- I abstain on the basis of no qualification to judge. supporting, screenplay, director, blah blah blah TV (I'm a little more qualified in this category, but not as much as others due to my not being able to afford cable.  I'm not going to break it down by category, I'll just give a shout out to the nominees I like.) CSI, Keifer Sutherland, Monk, Bonnie Hunt, Bitty Schram (hella cool name, too, btw), Tony Shalhoub, anybody or anything not freakin "Friends" related or on NBC, Arrested Development.

This blog is now about whatever the hell I feel like making it about.  What are you gonna do about  that  General MaryAnne Public?  Huh?  Well, since I'm experimenting with making things spankier any way I can, you can (hopefully) make a Comment on this entry, if I cutnpasted the scripts right. If you're interested in how I'm doing this, I can't really explain it, but you should go to www.Commentthis.com.

      "There's three ways out of every box: you fall out the bottom or you crawl out the top, There's three ways out of every, every box. And if you can't find your way out you just burn it to the ground and walk away, real slow."  I think that's how it goes.  The Wallflowers, from  Red Letter Days , which, against all expectations is becoming one of my favorite CDs.  Note the title change.  Everything's changing.  According to my tarot cards, my changes are going to be good as long as I can keep my money worries under control.  Not so much good change for everybody else.  Alice got laid off today.  Freaking weird that.  She was down to one shift a week, anyway, since she went back to school, but it seems she was the only one who had no idea it could happen.  But Barb and everyone were planning her birthday party on Friday just like nothing was going on.  I'm pretty much waiting for my turn at this point.  Getting laid off wouldn't really be so bad, because I could at least try to collect some kind of unemployment.  It couldn't be worse than what's going on right now, which is them bleeding back my hours a half shift a week.  I'm barely making 30 hours right now and it will probably drop next week.  I really hope those tarot cards speak truth. So, anyway.  In light of present circs, this blog is having a mild change in format.  But we'll still play more classic rock favorites before noon than most stations play in a day.  Now I just won't have to confine my rants to the mall.  You, there, who cut me off while driving-- or you funny (weird, not haha) guy standing around outside the post office, or YOU, guy on the unicycle on the sidewalk.  What's your deal, anyway?  It's a free for all.  I could go after celebrities, or your mom.  Sheesh.  The power.  Why didn't I do this a long time ago?

      Okay okay okay.  So, ummm, yeah.  Uh, okay.  No more whining.  We're going to do this thing.  I keep getting tempted to just delete this blog and devote all my energy to  urlLink The One Where I Lie Outrageously and All the Time , which I haven't plugged in like 3 days so I don't feel too bad about mentioning it right here.  But then I realize that I had a mission with this one and I should damn well make a better effort because the people need to freakin' know, you know?  They need to know what I'm talking about.   Whatever, you say.  And I say, okay. Today we are going to talk about the confusion between anonymity and privacy that I have been noticing.  When you go out in a public space (like a mall, for example, but if you are more familiar with it, say a restaurant or a grocery store) you are not in private.  Durr you all resoundingly tell me, but think about it.  Because about 18 times a day I see people that don't.  Think about it, that is.  Think about it and now... magical ingrediant... think about it with a cel phone.   Are you now or have you ever-- carried on a private conversation on a cel phone while in the middle of a public place?   Examples could include-  arguing with your divorce attorney making risque jokes to your boyfriend about what you're going to do to him when you get home describing your icky symptoms to your mom prescribing medication for psychiatric patients whom you refer to by first and last name complaining to some relative about the cheapness/ sluttiness/ bitchiness/ selfishness/ arrogance of some other relative I have overheard all of these conversations in the workplace.  The Dr. mentioned actually spent fifty minutes in our store (because "it's so quiet in here") with her daytimer spread out on the jewelry counter making multiple phone calls.  It's very quiet in here, it's January and we are overstaffed due to the owners kindly not wanting to do what everybody else does which is hire a bunch of people for Christmas and then fire them in January.  There is nothing left to do- everything is cleaned, restocked, inventoried, etc.  We have nothing to do and no other customers and so frankly, our only entertainment is eavesdropping on customers' conversations.  It's weird that the people who come in chatting to a spouse or a friend seem more conscious of other people being around.  They'll start into some sort of taboo subject and then if they notice another customer or a shop employee they'll drop their voices or move away or change the subject.  But the cel phone users never do.  It's like they all believe that by talking on the phone they are magically in some soundproof booth.  Or that because the other people around can't hear the other side of the conversation it doesn't count.  Believe me, I spend all day listening to people, I can figure out what you're talking about Jim-Bob.  And the next time you come in, I'll probably recognize you.  So, is it okay that I know that you and your wife were having sexual problems long before you separated because I don't know you socially?  Because I don't know your wife?  Because I, as a lowly retail employee, don't count?  Because you think that you'll never see me again or if you do the slate gets wiped clean?   Yes, it's impolite to eavesdrop, but cel phones have made it completely impossible not to.   I know if you want to carry on a conversation on any topic anywhere outside your home, as every American should have a right to do, there needs to be some assumption that either the people around you aren't listening that closely or that what they think of you doesn't matter.   But how to explain the people who talk to their friends in hushed tones vs. the cel phone users who don't even think there's anything wrong with taking a call in the MIDDLE OF A POINT OF SALE TRANSACTION?  Being on the other side of the counter, I will tell you the impossible-to-escape interpretation of this action: You, little Shopgirl, have just been de-prioritized.  You do not rank standard human interaction at this time.  This is strictly about the cash and does not require language.   It used to be that if I was ringing somebody up and the phone was ringing I would put the person on hold until I'd finished, but now, since the other person is just as likely to be on their phone, I just go ahead and take the call.   Which is off the subject.   So is the fact that people answer their cel phones WHILE THEY ARE IN THE BATHROOM.  I hear this multiple times a day (we have no back room in our store, so employees use the public restrooms out in the main mall- don't get me started tonight on the restrooms, we'll be here forever.)   Thought bubble--  rrrring  "Hello." "Hi, how are you... hey, are you  peeing  right now?" "Well, yeah." "What the f*ck!"  click  And fade out on tangent.  Fade in on rant that I was ranting before. My subject was the confusion of anonymity with privacy.  When you go out in public, you are in a crowd and can rely on anonymity to protect you if you want to share personal information.  But you should remember that you are not in private.  Call me old fashioned but there are conversations that really should only take place behind closed doors.  Certainly the doctor's.  I still can't figure out why she didn't go out to her car and take care of that stuff.

      I know I have already extolled the virtues of the  urlLink Female Army Officer in Afghanistan blog , but I enjoyed this and so I present you with a sample from her entry on 1/9/04:  "This discussion sparked a pointless debate in my office. S asked the question, "Was the first rug invented or discovered?" In my mind, the clear answer is "invented," as "discovered" implies the thing existed in that same state and was stumbled upon by a human. "Invented" requires action/intervention, and an idea to spawn the thing. Think about it: the wheel--invented. Tools--invented. The planet Mars: discovered, no one built it. The duckbilled platypus--discovered, although bears a close resemblance to what your mother said would happen if you bought separates instead of complete outfits."  This is not related in any way to retail.  I just liked it and thought I'd share.  Maybe I need a new mission statement.

      Again, I have lost my scientific objectivity and turned this into a whine fest.   I will try to add some socilogical perspective.  Where I was going with my rant against Bob is that his attitude is one of- "Well, my system is perfect.  You people who use it just keep screwing it up."  We don't screw it up, Bob.  We USE it.  And if your system cannot be used in the environment in which it needs to be, then it is not a very good system.  I think there are computer consultants out there working now who think more on this level- that of, okay, the program doesn't respond well when this happens, so, since we can't prevent that from happening in the normal workday, we need to deal with it.  Instead of Bob, who just sends down a stone tablet which says, "The program doesn't like it when you do that.  Don't do that."  Like the joke about the doctor, "well, don't move your arm like that."  I'm not saying Bob is a bad programmer and I'm not saying his system sucks.  I'm saying that neither one seem equal to the task at hand and rather than working on his alibi, he should be working on the problem. In other news, it's another snow day.

      The computer at work is X many pounds of useless, non-biodegradeable scrap.  As far as I'm concerned.  Sadly, there are no funds to purchase a new computer, so we must limp along with what we have.  Which lately has meant doing hand receipts and balancing the books at night with a calculator and a pencil.  Which, tellingly, increases the accuracy. The computer consultant is a jerkwad and a nimrod.  I'm going to write a haiku about him right now:  Computer consultant haiku #1: Jerkwad Nimrod Bob Our Computer consultant, Hear this now: you suck.  He's one of the old school computer consultants, back from before they coined the term "user friendly."  Somebody gave him some sort of manual at some point on how to make friends and influence people, so he talks the lingo like a badly translated Japanese monster movie: "Oh, your business comes first."  "Oh, it's a pleasure working with you."  He always says "oh!" before everything.  Except when he's talking to himself while working.  Then he mostly says, "This is terrible.  This is just useless."  Making no effort to disguise his alarm and disgust.  Every day he has a new story about why the computer is broken and it NEVER involves anything to do with his program (he wrote the code for the cash register, but, tellingly, has to have us show him every time how to actually USE it to ring a sale).  First it was that the hard drive frame was bent from being taken in and out of the desk so often- implication, it's our fault.  "Yeah, sure," said Barb in the back room when I told her, "Because you know I pull the hard drive out and just take it home with me sometimes, kick it once or twice, and then bring it back."  We never move the hard drive.  Okay, so that wasn't really what it was because it stayed broken.  So then it was that we were doing something to circumvent important error messages.  Again, implication- our fault.  Unless the computer was communicating the error messages on ultrasonic frequencies telepathically to us, there were no error messages.  Just the computer locking up entirely.  Which we reported, but tried to work around because it was in the middle of holiday rush and we could not be without a register.  Now the story is that the computer has a Trojan horse, even though we don't do e-mail on it.  I'm not expert enough to say it's absolutely not a trojan horse, we have Outlook on the computer and I have personally used it in the past- but only twice and only to communicate with Nina in the admin office when she asked me to.   Again, implication- not Bob's fault.  Nothing at all to do with his program.  Nothing at all to do with the fact that our computer is frankensteined together out of spare parts and is Windows 98 attempting to run UPS software that is probably no longer backward compliant.  Because we can't upgrade out of 98 because Bob still hasn't finished updating the cash register program from 95.  WHICH IS NOT BOB's FAULT and has NOTHING to do with the current bugs.  At this rate, we'll be just getting to XP when the rest of the planet- including small textile businesses in Kinshasa and dogsledding teams in Baffin Bay-  are all running off of palm pilots networed via satellite and activated with voice recognition.  But this will not be Bob's fault.  Nope nope never.  Jerkwad.

      Falling under the heading be careful what you wish for... SNOW DAY yesterday!   My bosses were nice and declared that if we thought it was too dangerous to drive to work we didn't have to go.  Being that there was about 8" of snow in my apartment complex parking lot and I live at the top of a steep hill, it was pretty much a no-brainer.  But it took to almost the last possible second for the phone tree to completely take effect and for me to find out I didn't have to go in.  Thank goodness we have such a thing, though, because on the news I saw them interviewing some poor gal who works at the same mall and who was trying to get to work- had been trying to get to work for 3 hours by bus because her car was stuck- and after waiting at a bus stop for over an hour for a bus, any bus, to show up, was giving up.  She said she hoped her manager watched the news and felt bad for her and didn't fire her.   Because, get this, even though the State Department of Transportation issued a warning saying, unless it's an emergency DO NOT DRIVE, and if you leave your driveway, even in urban areas, CHAINS ARE REQUIRED, and even though all the other malls in the area closed immediately and without question, the mall I work at is so damn greedy or incapable of making a decision (the only two reasons I can come up with) they refused to close.   Let me reiterate.  It's a national holiday, chains are required to go anywhere, a state normally drenched in rain gets a freak flurry of snow, kids are able to go snowboarding in the street and mall management thinks, oh yeah, people are totally going to be jumping into their cars, risking life and limb in this barely recovering economy so they can hit the after Christmas clearance sales, which aren't that good anyway. Yeah, that's totally going to happen.  Right after the hookah smoking caterpillar shows up with the flying monkeys.    Excuse me while I laugh my butt off at you.   Well, I can laugh, because my nice bosses gave me the day off.  Thank you, nice bosses. Hopefully my nice bosses will also give me a nice Christmas bonus to make up for the lost wages of me not being able to get to work.  Particularly since it's supposed to snow like 10 more inches between now and Monday. And here I was complaining about never getting two days off in a row.  Be careful what you wish for.

      Observations:  The L*m*t*d sold the pants right off one of their mannequins today, leading to many gasps of "Naughty!" from passing shoppers.  Amanda was helping a gentleman pick out some decorative tiles.  A woman came over and pushed them both out of the way so that she could look.  Pushed them hard.  An adult woman.  Amanda nearly fell on the floor.    Said the woman in the faux fir coat over acid washed jeans and a college football t-shirt: "Oh, I'm just lookin' tonight, honey.  There was a time when I was workin', I could just come in here and point to anything and say 'wrap it up' and I'd never leave without five or six of my favorite things.  Not anymore.  Now between my rent and my teeth, I've got nothing left over.  But just show me these pearls here and let me drool."  Sign at the kiosk that sells hermit crabs: "Due to state regulations, we cannot accept returns on any live animals.  All sales are final."

      Had a young dad in with his daughter, having conversations that I'm sure were (at least on his part) intended to be overheard.  The daughter was I'd guess 4 and therefore probably just a few months too young to have reached that phase that all children go through where they realize that everyone around them can hear what they say (not just mommy and daddy) and that frequently total strangers find small children hilariously amusing and that they can get all sorts of positive reinforcement on the cheap just by shooting their mouth off in public places.  She was, as I said, a bit too young for this, and I didn't get that vibe off of her.  Hard to read, though, because her dad was angling for something, I just could not figure out what. There is a certain type of male shopper who comes in shopping for his wife and likes to flirt sub-textually with the shop girls using this as a come on.  Like, "Boy girls, aren't you disappointed that a real catch like me isn't on the market anymore?  Look what a spectacular mate I am.  Buying this [opal ring/ perfume bottle/ silver bracelet/ heart-shaped chunk-o-glass] for my lady.  Eat your hearts out." Couldn't tell if that was this guy's deal or if he really was just that enthusiastic about his anniversary.  Complicating the issue was the fact that I saw him completely barking at his child out in the mall two minutes earlier when I was coming back from my coffee break. He was super-sweet with her in the store.  Admittedly, you will be at a disadvantage just reading this, but see if you can figure out how much of the following conversation was disingenuous: "You should get something shiny for Mommy." "You think so?  I was thinking that Mommy and Daddy could get new wedding bands for their anniversary, what do you think?" "Can I be at the anniversary?" "I couldn't imagine it without you, sweetie.  Do you want to go somewhere for the anniversary?" "Yeah." "Yeah?  Where do you want to go?" "Calgary."  [Either the mom's Canadian or this kid is pretty well-traveled.] "Calgary, huh?  I was thinking of somewhere more interesting than Calgary."  [Okay, now the dad is definitely trying to come off as well-traveled because Calgary sounds plenty fine to me.  Could one drive to Banff from Calgary?  I've often really wanted to go to Banff.  From photos it looks like the kind of place that can stunt double for Heaven in the movies.]  "What do you think of going to Chile or Peru, honey?  Would you like that?" "Or we could go to Chuck E Cheez." I showed him three or four of wedding bands, which the child insisted on trying on.  Then she decided to leave and he made a big show of being dragged by this little pink-clad elfin thing out the door, "Apparently I'm leaving now.  Thank you for your help."  Eight hours later as I sit and write this I'm now trying to think if I did a ring count as I put them back in the case.  It was an entirely adorable conversation, just the sort of thing that I thought as it was happening, "I'm going to remember this so I can write it in my blog."  But I can't get the staginess of it out of my head.  I'm so used to us being invisible, having something so blatantly done for the benefit of the shop girl audience causes a pricking in my thumbs, as the old saying goes.

      For you today, I recommend:  urlLink Kristin Thomas's Spam Poetry.  Which is not poetry  about  Spam (tm) but poetry  made of  spam.  If you are disappointed by this, you can try  urlLink Spam Haiku , which is ultra high tech looky and all about processed meat products.  If you dislike Spam, and prefer Haggis, you will be disappointed in   urlLink The Haggis-on-Whey World of Unbelievable Brilliance  because it isn't about meat at all.  It has very silly information about giraffes.  Such as that they control 90% of what you see in mirrors.  I, of course, love this website beyond all rational reasoning.

       Security Alert  The lengths some people go to just to make nuisances of themselves.  I swear. Someone from mall admin came around with a security alert handout the other day.  They wanted us to know about a conspiracy of stalker potty-mouths who are preying on female employees of local malls.  The scam runs something like this- the evildoer skulks around the mall until he spots some shopgirl he wants to target.  He waits until she gets off work then follows her out to her car, making note of the make and the license plate.  Then he waits until the next day and while she's at work, he leaves a note on her windshield saying that he accidentally hit her car or that he found something that she dropped and since he's such a good samaritan, here's his phone number, please call him.  Which she, if she is either naive or stupid (po-tay-to, po-tah-to) does.  Revealing to the villain her phone number on his caller id.  A lot of planning and set up, I'm thinking, as I read the security alert bulletin.  I'm wondering at this point if the poor woman is then located through a reverse directory and the whole story ends with dismembered animals left on doorsteps and police transporting people under cover of darkness to safe houses.  Then it turns out that the Evil Supergenius just wants the shopgirl's number so he can make smutty phone calls to her.  What the hell? So the mall rentacops are all over this, it being printed in the mall newsletter, so if we get a note on our car, we are supposed to go to the security office and have them call the number.  How helpful.  Prank phone calls, they're all over that.  Shoplifters and guys who actually come into the store and make smutty comments to shopgirls in person, I'm sorry, the mall's insurance doesn't cover mall security getting involved with such issues, they recommend that if it's serious we contact the local police.  If it's in your shop, legally, it's your problem.  "The police can be very helpful in talking you through making a citizen's arrest."  (Direct quote from a previous security alert.)  So, yeah, mall cops, good for prank phone call protection and giving directions to little old ladies who want to find the Shoe Mill.  Not so much with the crime fighting.  It's telling that from a distance you can't tell their uniforms apart from the employees' at Sees' Candies.

      Ahhh, Valentine's Day, just in time to rescue us all from the retail doldrums of January.  I think we did more sales in the last two days than we did in all of September.  First it was the wives, then the husbands, then the dads with kids needing gifts for the stepmoms, then for the new boyfriends.  Then, around 4 pm yesterday the mall emptied out of those lovey dovebirds and we saw the dark side of Valentine's Day retail.  Two groups of very different make ups.  The mercenary newly-engaged, out hunting for big diamond bargains at all the jewelry store sales- you'd think it would be so cute and sweet but you're wrong.  The way these folks pressed for deals they may as well have been shopping for a big screen TV.  And then there were the single women all dressed up at the mall on a Saturday night, shopping alone.  Filling the void with retail therapy, I guess.  Most of them avoided eye contact and carried around their Victoria's Secret bags like a personal force field.  They all had exquisite hair and shoes.

      Of course, what would a conversation about mannequins be without reference to the 80's classic of the same title?   Jonathan Switcher is a young artist. He just doesn't seem to last in any job he does. But when he builds a mannequin, he makes it so perfect, he falls in love with it. It is the first thing he has made that makes him feel like a real artist. The mannequin ends up in the window of a big department store. When he saves the life of an old lady who happens to be the owner of that store, he is rewarded by getting a job at the store as stock boy. Later the mannequin comes to life as Emmy, who was an ancient Egyptian living in the year 2514BC. The two redesign the window display to make it most eye catching in town. The store competitors are not happy and will do anything to stop them!   This plot summary brought to you by the good folks at  urlLink imdb .  I know it's somewhat based on the Pygmalian myth and it's intended as a fluffy romantic comedy, but does anybody else find the idea of a grown man having a serious relationship with a lifesize doll kind of wacked?  Of course, I find most romantic comedies creepy, with the exception of "Addicted to Love."  (In spite of the fact that it stars Meg Ryan, the plot mainly revolves around two stalkers, for some reason I find this less yak-inducing than "Runaway Bride.")   When I was little and I had to fill out those cute little homework assignments in first and second grade where they asked you about your favorite food and what you wanted to be when you grew up and if a magic genie gave you a wish what would you wish for I always, ALWAYS wrote that I would wish for my toys to come to life.  My favorite book at the time was  Amy's Eyes  by Richard Kennedy, where a bunch of toys come to life and go on a pirate adventure in search of golden treasure.  Adorable right?  But then, get this, the main character gets turned from a little girl into a doll and then her button eyes are eaten by a fish so her brother packs her in salt so she won't turn into a real girl again and go blind and then later a doll-come-to-life named Skivvy becomes convinced the apocalypse is at hand and sabotages the ship.  I was like 9 when I read that.  I thought it was so awesome.  I wanted all my stuffed animals to come to life and go to school with me and then we could all go kick ass on the people who made fun of me on the bus. Oh, please, we were all frequently horrible as children.  I just kept a detailed journal of it. Er, tangent, apologies. Anyway, if the mannequins at the mall now came to life, no chance of inappropriate relations with window-dressers, as none of the mannequins have heads and most don't even have arms that go all the way out.  Just some headless zombie mannequin army.  What would they do, I wonder?  I don't envision them rampaging around, smashing windows and terrorizing consumers.  I kind of see them going down to KayBee and playing with the wind-up doggies, or going into other stores and trying on entirely different wardrobes, or hanging out in the massage chair at the Gadget Porn store, or curling up on the leather couches in Pottery Barn, finally able to rest after all that standing.

      Conversations about mannequins continued:  The Limited mannequins have overly good posture, that sort of slightly swaybacked boobs up cheerleader stance. Eddie Bauer's mannequins all look, even the girl ones with the pointelle polo shirts, like a rugby line about to charge.  Not slouchy, just, "hey, let's charge up this wooded hill and breathe some fresh air and throw a stick for some golden retrievers." Banana Republic's girl mannequins definitely have the smallest boobs of any of them. Victoria's Secret mannequins- well, upright posture isn't really the point is it?  They're sculpted plastic T&A, they don't even have arms. The GAP for Kids mannequins have no heads.  Well, no one's have heads anymore (I remember when they had heads and faces and wigs and makeup), but the GAP for Kids mannequins have special attachable parts on rods that allow them to wear hats.  Neck, blank space, then a hat.  And they have feet, or at least parts to which shoes can be attached.  And they're posable, to simulate active scenes of play.  The effect of which I find very eerie, phantom children flying kites.

      Conversations about movies continued: I explained to Caroline that I just couldn't get into the whole elves and dwarves and flying dragons things as much as she could. Caroline: "Well, but you're into sci fi." Me: "Yes, I am, but that's a bit like saying 'You like Coke, you can't also like Pepsi' or 'You like Tiffany, you can't also like Debbi Gibson.'" Caroline: "That's true, but if it were, like  The Matrix  you'd want to maybe crawl into that movie, right?" Me: "Well, yeah, okay." Beth: "Jeeezuss!" (Beth's mom is Canadian and you only really notice the accent when Beth swears.)  "That's a horrible movie to live inside." Me: "Well, I'd do it mostly for the ass-kicking." Beth: "What did you think of the second one by the way?" Me: (hedging- making a so so face) Beth: "Did you think for example that the sex scene should have been  longer ?"  (Interesting, never thought about it, but Beth sounds more Canadian when she's being sarcastic, too.  Which would be the inverse of what you'd assume.) And then I explained to both of them how really the whole rave/orgy scene was just brilliant marketing for the DVD and all those hard-core scifi geeks out there like the comic book store guy on "The Simpsons" or the Jedi Jerk from the Gadget Porn store sitting at home alone of an evening.  "Hmmm.  I want to watch sci fi.  But I also want to watch porn.  How do I decide?  Oh, wait, now I don't have to!" Really, though, there have only been a few movies in recent memory that I'd want to, not live in, but maybe spend a summer vacation time share there.  "Pirates of the Caribbean" (duh) and "The Royal Tenenbaums."

      Good crew today.  But no customers.  So we were talking about movies.  Last week I had expressed my lack of desire to see "Return of the King" because I had not even seen "Two Towers."  I was ordered to see "Two Towers" and having nothing better to do that evening, did so directly.  So now today Beth and Caroline were encouraging me to see "ROTK." "Every time I watch one of those movies," said Caroline, warming to her subject rapidly, "I just want to climb right up there into the screen" (and here, to illustrate her point, she started crawling up onto the counter) "and jump into the movie and start living in it.  I want a hobbit life.  I want to live in a hobbit house...." "Oh my God!" breathed Beth, "I want to live in a hobbit house, too!  With a little door and a little gate and..." "And a pony!" yelped Caroline, now re-enacting riding a pony.  Then she realized that the Gadget Porn guys could totally see her doing it and probably wouldn't understand.  She stopped.  "But the pony is pretty much obligatory no matter what the lifestyle." They asked me why I liked the second movie better than the first and I said something about the ecological message and getting to know the characters better and blah blah blah... "And there are some serious hot pants in that movie," said Caroline.  She knows me  so  well.   Hobbits I can take or leave, but former  Xena  guest stars tarted up like Vikings on horseback?  It's a foolproof formula!   Then Caroline taught me and Kate and Beth how to braid our hair like Legolas. Some days don't suck as much as the rest.  Funny how the ones that don't suck have no customers in them, though.

       Scoliosis Chic   urlLink Freddie Prinze, Jr . has the worst posture.  I mention this because I noticed today on my lunchtime walk around the mall that it appears that GAP and Snobercrombie and Flinch have discovered a way of dressing their window mannequins so that the headless dummies appear to be slouching like said Spouse-of-Buffy.  Which leads me to wonder if in fact the outfits being marketed in this way were actually  designed  to be worn while slouching.  There certainly isn't much to most of them unless they are artistically crumpled and pulled askew by jutting hips and hunched down rib cages and off-kilter shoulders.  Has anybody thought to study this?  Probably not.  Being your friendly mall anthropologist I call it to your attention.  If I had funding, I could conduct a study, coming back in 15 years and measuring bone mass loss and lower back pain amongst current A&F shoppers (ie ninth graders).  I would also study what, for lack of a better term, I would have to call "gumption."    urlLink Orlando Bloom  , roughly a contemporary, does not slouch.  Does he generally appear therefore that he could at any time kick Freddie's ass?  You betcha.  James Bond does not slouch.  The Karate Kid does not slouch.  Neo, Batman, Superman, slouchers none.   Perhaps I'm moderately more sensitive than most, having suffered all sorts of spinal issues throughout my otherwise uneventful childhood and so in store windows I still have the habit of checking my reflection to see if I'm standing up straight enough.  So I have it on the brain as I'm gazing at the displays anyway. The GAP mannequins are not nearly as bad as A&F.  The spring line is better than winter, perhaps the warm weather and ice cream colors have perked them up.  But A&F is bad.  Those mannequins are hopeless, if they came to life they would spend their days hanging around the mall, bumming cigarettes from Gadget Porn store employees and staring vacantly at the windows of stores.  The JCrew mannequins have nice straight spinal cords.  They are upwardly mobile and should they come to life, in short order I'm sure they'd be captains of industry and rulers of the free world.  Or at least winners of "The Apprentice."  And now the socioeconomic element (and you thought I was just BS-ing this?  I have a  degree , I'll remind you).  JCrew is the most expensive of the three stores, growing more so, in fact.  Come to think of it, Banana Republic (GAP's higher rent cousin) also has very straight-backed mannequins.  Not that GAP and A&F are cheap, they're just expensive enough to convince ninth graders that they're getting something really cool.  But JCrew and BR are much more expensive (completely out of my price range, for instance).  And their mannequins do not slouch.   Connections?  Coincidence?  Comments?   And yes, I know that I spend too much damn time at the mall and that I probably put too much thought into the small things, left with nothing else to occupy my mind for 8 hours.  You can leave that little remark at home tied up in the yard. I hope that I have now sparked something for you to think about.  Now that I've mentioned it, you're going to see them everywhere, slouchy mannequins and famous people.  It's like pregnant women or albinos.

       And just to set the record straight...   I don't want to be called a hypocrite here.  I know I goob on spelling and use the wrong word sometimes as well.  I once got called up on "crepuscular" vs "corpuscular" in a letter I wrote, which absolutely served me right for trying to use such a fancy-ass word in the first place.  Which is quite a funny mix-up, really, one having to do with things that come out at twilight and the other having to do with, corpuscules, I guess.  Which are small and biological, as I understand it.  Anyway, I screw up with words myself.  But rarely do I laminate my errors for public posting.  It is a statement of the retail mindset that I got a big secret bang out of recognizing the goob in the now hiring sign.  How far it drives me sometimes.  Because essentially my personal philosophy about linguistics (and I suppose it raises me above the masses that I actually have such a thing) is that for interpersonal communication, whatever works should be allowed.  Slang, e-mail emoticons, Ebonics- language is a dynamic thing and as soon as it stops living and working and evolving it goes the way of Latin.  But in my philosophy this attitude only applies to language in everyday use among equals.  Business communication and official postings should be spell-checked, proofread, edited and revised.  Two or three times each.  And should follow all the rules of grammar, usage and spelling.  If you're asking for "professional" individuals to come and slice off slabs of beef, slather them in yogurt and roll them up in a pita and then work a cash register for $6.00 an hour- you have a professional duty to not be sloppy with your signage.

       Not to be snotty, but...   Sometimes it's hard.  Well, yes, obviously, you say.  Wait, you say.  What are we talking about? Retail, I reply.  Working retail is hard.  Especially if you have a masters degree. Okay, you say.  Tell me more. Well, it's hard because you can either be snotty about having the master's degree- "Neener neener, I'm super educated, I'm better than everybody, no one understands me or appreciates me, I'm just here until I can get something better, blah blah blah."  Or you can completely suppress it.  Suppression is required if you want to make friends and influence people you work with.  Besides, most of the people I work with have college degrees of some kind- retail is no longer someplace for high school juniors and college drop outs.  If you live in a university town, it's quite likely your Starbucks barista probably has a PhD. So, I have to check the master's degree chip on the shoulder at the mall entrance.  Which I dutifully do, and it usually makes my life easier.  To the point where I almost forget I have it.  To the point where I don't even get defensive when taking sh*t from the Subway shift manager or some of the people I work for.  To the point where I lose the secret power that comes from knowing that I have it.   I'm not sure I follow, you say. Well, like Superman, I reply.  When he's being Clarke Kent, it's okay that he's kind of nerdy and Lois Lane doesn't think he's particularly great, he's cool with it because he knows that he's got the ability to leap tall buildings with a single bound and if he ever just desperately wanted to impress somebody he can just bust that out.   This has gone somewhere a little different than you intended when you started, hasn't it? you ask me. Well, yes, I say.  Because originally this was just supposed to be a snarky little wise-ass entry about the "For Hire" sign some corporate assistant manager of the Greek place had made up.  It's large and official, slick printing job, snazzy logo, expensive looking glossy lamination.  And apparently I am the only one with the super-impressive brain power to notice the big flaming error in the middle of it. "Now Hiring.  Seeking professional, hard-working, timely individuals for evenings and weekends.  Please inquire at register for applications." I call your attention to the use of the word   timely  .  Timely individuals they want.   Now I direct you to the definition of timely provided by the good folks of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (Fourth Edition) (courtesy of  urlLink Bartleby.com ):  time·ly  1. Occurring at a suitable or opportune time; well-timed. 2.  Archaic  Coming too early; premature. Seeking timely individuals.  Individuals occuring at a suitable or opportune time.  Riddle me this: if I were an individual, and I like to think I am, how would I go about occuring at a suitable time?

      I normally don't get Mondays off.  Normally I get Thursdays and Sundays and alternate Wednesdays (more alternately than not lately) off.  Mondays I have not gotten off for several years.  There is a hierarchy of days off.   Lowest: two separate days- neither one a weekend. Then: One weekend day and one weekday, still not together. Then: Two weekdays off together. Then: Two days together, one weekend, one weekday. Highest: (Manager and 14 year employees) Two weekend days off. Beth has worked here off and on for 14 years, so she gets Mondays and Sundays off.  Beth is on vacation this week and last week so while she is gone, I work Beth's shifts.  But I don't say, "I'm working Beth's shifts."  I say, "This week I am Beth."  This is not a shopgirl phenomenon.  This is idiosyncratic to me only, unique to my performance art approach to my retail employment.  The Me that exists at work is a role, a role defined by a schedule, certain hours of every day that I do not own- hours where I occupy a service position that is approached by members of the general public who are on their own time, theoretically operating as themselves and not role-playing.  They do not care much whether I am individually in that position (I do not try nearly hard enough to inspire this kind of loyalty, in fact it goes hard against the non-offensive, forgettable anonymity I try very hard to cultivate).  As long as that position is filled by a competent customer service employee they are content to buy from whoever is available to take their money away from them.  Smiling shopgirl, CGI hologram projection of B-grade celebrity, trained monkey, robot.  If they want to buy, they'll buy.  Bad service will discourage a sale, but mediocre and forgettable service will get it in the end just as well as memorable and good.  There is a copious amount of anecdotal evidence to support this- many customers come in and do a walk-through- scout the shop, perhaps have someone open a few cases, then declare that they may be back and depart for other destinations.  Hours later they return and approach a different shopgirl, ie having started with Kate in the morning, they return shortly after lunch and pick up with Amanda, and even though Kate and Amanda do not strongly resemble each other, even though Amanda greets them as though she has never seen them before (having come on at 1:30 she has not), they pick up with Amanda right where they left off with Kate, expecting Amanda to possess all of Kate's knowledge of the previous transaction.  Partly, this is due to people not really paying very close attention to much of anything around them most of the time.  I recently saw a Discovery channel special devoted to this, the big payoff bit at the end being a filmed study where they gathered 16 average youngish bar-going people together in a bar and made them watch a video of a basketball team practicing.  They asked the people to count how many times the basketball got passed.  Apparently, the counting was so all consuming that only two participants (both female) noticed the large man in a gorilla suit who walked onto the center of the court and began to dance around amidst all the basketball players.  Additional evidence: Margaret Katherine, the cousin I have who works at Target, likes to tell the story of the woman who came up to the returns counter with a microwave purchased at KMart, receipt from KMart and asked to get her money back.   "I can't give you your money back, Ma'am," said Margaret Katherine. "Why not?" "Because this microwave came from KMart." "Yeah, so?" "You're in Target, Ma'am." "Oh.  Really?" "Yes."  "Did this used to be KMart?" "No, it's always been Target." "I thought it was KMart."   In her defense, both signs are big and red. Anyway.  My point I think I was making about half an hour ago was that people don't pay much attention to much of anything most of the time, so distinguishing between two white thirty-ish females- even if one is more thirtyish and blonde and has a high pitched voice and the other is more fortyish and has black hair and barely ever speaks above a whisper- is probably asking for too much dedicated brain power, especially factoring in multiple stores, cell phone conversations and screaming small children.   So there are no embarrassing messages at the beginning of the program like at the beginning of "All My Children" when someone has to take the week off but they haven't had enough time to write in an emergency trip to South America in search of a long lost daughter or twin brother.  "This week the role of Tad is being played by..."  I just work Beth's shifts and nobody notices, except me.  To me, there is a difference, and for some reason it is important.  So I say it this way.  This week I am playing the role of Beth.  Which involves taking Beth's phone messages and getting Beth's days off.  Try it some time, it really does alter your perspective to suddenly get different days off.  This week is not so bad, but last Monday I had trouble figuring out how I was supposed to behave.  What was I supposed to do with a Monday off?  It warped time, is what it did.   Next week Beth comes back and I get to go back to being myself again.  Or the Self that works in the store, anyway.  As for the rest of me, the me that I am on my own time, out of the public eye, well...

       Fast Food Tyrant  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Little tiny doses of power give people personality disorders. I hate the new shift manager at the Subway in the food court.  I have to go to Subway because the shift manager at the Greek place is like the food court sleazoid sidekick of the DOM, everywhere else makes me sick and the shift manager of the chicken place is so rock-star good looking I can't ever get my order out straight for looking at him when I go there.  So, stuck with Subway, which isn't bad if I can get any one of the constant carousel of high school "Sandwich Artists" (official job title, by the way, they put it on their resumes).  But for some reason my dumb luck has been of late to always get Peggy (whose real name I use because she is such a surly bitch and she deserves it).   Normal Subway patter: 1)"Hi, welcome to Subway, what can I get for you?" 2)"What kind of cheese would you like with that?" 3) "What kind of vegetables would you like with that?" 4) "Mayonaise?  Mustard?  Salt?  Pepper?  Oil?  Vinegar?" I order the same sandwich every time so it's more of a rote recitation when I go up there than a decision.  But then Peggy started being more "hands on."  To the point of last night grabbing my sandwich in progress away from my little blonde-ponytailed high school sophomore sandwich picasso and shoving her into the back room.  For reasons apparently known only to Bitchy Peggy, judging by the confused eye rolling between the girl on the register and the ponytailed picasso.   Peggy's Subway patter: "What are you having?" "Cheese?" "And then?" "And then?" "And then?" "What else?" "Is that all?" And then a BIG SIGH when I present to her a $10 bill for a $4 sandwich.  Making change is, I guess, one of the major trials of Peggy's day.  The girl on the register would have been more than happy to handle it and stepped up grandly to do her subway duty, but Peggy elbowed her into the back room as well.

      We all got repetetive stress injuries... All those in windowless cubicles lashed to keyboards suffering from  urlLink carpal tunnel , the employees at Orange Julius share your on the job injury blues.  Last night the shift manager was showing me the huge knobby callouses that have grown up between the first and second knuckles of her first fingers from flipping the switch on the blenders all day long.  They looked painful and permanent.

      Was watching  Blue Velvet  the other night because I'm a big David Lynch fan and found myself wondering what Dennis Hopper's career would look like today if he hadn't done so many memorable roles as raging psycho freaks...   Several of the actors who were considered for the role of Frank found the character too repulsive and intense. Dennis Hopper, by contrast, is reported to have exclaimed, "I've got to play Frank. Because I am Frank!"  from  urlLink Blue Velvet trivia  on imdb.com  Then, after I turned off the DVD and switched over to network TV, I saw an ad for  urlLink  Starsky & Hutch  , starring Ben Stiller and   urlLink Owen Wilson   and my question was answered.  I've not been able to isolate whether it's the mannerisms or the eyes or what exactly, but if you would like to check it out for yourself, watch   urlLink Easy Rider   and   urlLink Zoolander   in the same weekend sometime.  And if you'd like to see a cute cuddly teenaged Dennis Hopper getting his butt kicked by a drunken James Dean, rent   urlLink Giant  .

      Well, amid all the hullaballoo about gay marriage on the news lately- W., Massachusetts, SF, and now  urlLink Portland  I thought I would weigh in with the perhaps overlooked retail perspective: it's good for biz-ness. February was a good month for us.  Why?  Lots of folks apparently decide to get engaged or married in the month of lurrrve.  And we are a store full of stuff that makes great wedding gifts.  We also sell rings.  Anything that ups the numbers of people getting married, I'm in favor of because those people need rings and the people that love them need gifts.  And we will be there in their moment of need.  Which will result in higher sales which result in higher profits which could, somewhere down the line (if the owners don't get pissed at mall management and close our store entirely) result in higher wages for me in my hour of need, which is turning out to be a very long hour indeed.  We've always done a small but steady business with "commitment ceremonies" and "civil unions" or whatever, more with the chicks than the guys at our store.  Frankly, I like them better than "normal" weddings.  Generally, for one thing, they plan a lot farther ahead- they've been thinking about this for a while, so they are calm and decisive, which a lot of ring shoppers aren't.  I hate the frantic wishy washy ones.  They need something!  Now!  But what?  But what?  Ack.  Go somewhere else where you can get a full refund if you freak out and pull a Brittney Spears.  Screw sales statistics, I don't want to deal with you.    You'd think it would be the opposite- two brides instead of one and both of them playing off each other.  There's a reason there's no masculine equivalent to the term "Bride-zilla" in the popular vernacular.  But all-female weddings have been some of my favorite customers.  Some of the ones I've done have come back in and become amazingly good regular customers.  Others brought boxes of candy-  even after we screwed up the ring order on the first try.   Most of the hetero brides I deal with, I'm lucky if I get a "thank you" as they grab the ring and jet out the door and then we don't see them again until seven years later when they drop the ring down the sink and need it repaired or something.   Either that or the bride-mom is calling every single day to check on the "status of the ring order."    The only other major demographic that shops in our store that bring as much joy to the ring counter as lesbians are the Society of Creative Anachronism knights and ladies/ Goths.  Anyone who asks if I can get them something "like in the Lord of the Rings" immediately gets the full sparkling focus of my retail skills.  Black trenchcoats and sunny dispositions.  I love 'em.

       Well I don’t know why I came here tonight. I’ve got the feeling that something ain’t right. I’m so scared in case I fall off my chair, and I’m wondering how I’ll get down the stairs.  "Stuck in the Middle With You"  Gigi: "Are you standing on one of those three legged stools?" Self: "Yeah, but I'm fine.  See?" Gigi: "Yeah, I just get all scared when someone gets up on those, like Fred." Self: "Well, certainly Fred should never be up on one of these.  But I'm fine." [seconds later, while Self had one end of a large $2500 oil painting and Gigi had the other and Self was leaning forward to get the painting hooked on the nail] Self: "Oh, here I go!" [verbatim- I have witnesses] And I crashed to the floor, somehow not taking out the $2300 glass sculpture underneath the $2500 oil painting- which Gigi somehow managed to catch all by herself- or the entire glass display cabinet located approximately 18" behind me.  Somehow I had broken nothing- bones, sculptures, displays.  I also fell completely out of the sight line of the gadget porn employees and all customers.  Gigi was the only one who saw.  Seems the universe at large wanted me to learn a lesson about standing on three legged stools, but just that specific lesson.  I'm quick to learn, overkill is not necessary and I appreciated not being smited for pride going before a fall.  Attention, mysterious forces: message received.  No more three legged stools for moi. We all had a good hearty laugh at my expense.  Perhaps I missed my calling.  Perhaps I should go to  urlLink clown school .    Clowns to the left of me! Jokers to the right! Here I am stuck in the middle with you.  Yes I’m stuck in the middle with you, and I’m wondering what it is I should do. It’s so hard to keep this smile from my face. Losing control yeah I'm all over the place.

They're all together so any time you want to, you can come pick one of these out. 5 YEAR OLD BOY: Why would I want to do that? MOTHER: Because you can read while you listen to the tape.

      I get my grrr yarghs out...   Once upon a time  there was a woman named Ruth.  And Ruth was her real real name.  Ruth had a bracelet, which she took to the faerie workshop to get fixed.  The faeries did not complete their work on the bracelet quickly enough to suit Ruth.  The faeries had run out of magic bracelet fixing dust and were waiting for another shipment.  Then the faerie that drove the magic faerie dust from workshop to workshop up and quit and took many valuable files with him and there was much confusion in the faerie workshop.  Anyway.  The bracelet was not completed soon enough to suit Ruth.  And Ruth probably had a legitimate beef with some of the faeries about this situation.  But instead of behaving like a rational adult, Ruth decided to wait until one minute before the faerie workshop closed in the evening and then call the faerie workshop on the telephone.  A totally innocent faerie who knew nothing about Ruth's bracelet picked up the phone because she thought it had to be a fellow faerie's family member calling, after all, who would call the faerie workshop one minute before it turned back into a pumpkin?  Ruth did not even wait for this faerie to finish saying hello.  Ruth was so mad about her bracelet, she just started screaming and screaming at the poor innocent faerie who just wanted to go home to her magical little cottage in the mystical grove and curl up with her kitten and a cup of tea and a book of spells in her nice cozy pajamas and her bed of butterflly wings and myths.  Ruth was mean mean mean to that faerie and she was so so loud, the faerie had to hold the telephone away from her head, for fear of going deaf in her little faerie ears.  I should also add that the faerie was working two jobs that day and had been on her feet helping people for 12 hours straight and had eaten exactly one meal, a cold hot pocket (she was an ironical faerie) in her faerie-mobile while stopped at an intersection waiting for a train from the Here or There to tote it's cargo to the Over Yonder.  This faerie just told Ruth that she had to call back in the morning when the workshop opened again and when the faeries that knew about Ruth's bracelet were back at work, but Ruth just wanted to scream and scream and so that's what she did.  Fortunately, the faerie was used to taking crap from mean mean ladies like Ruth, so she just kept saying "Ok, Ok, Ok," until Ruth got kind of confused and let the faerie hang up on her.  Then the faerie went home and cast a spell on Ruth and once she had done so, she slept the sleep of innocent angels.  Whereas Ruth had to deal with icky fungus demons who, summoned by the faerie's magic spell, crawled into Ruth's room and poked her and screamed in her ear all night long until the sun came up. Wicked Ruth.  We hate her.  "It's times like these," Caroline said, "That I wish I had Tourettes, because then I could legitimately say something like- 'Stupid bitch, burn in hell!' when I got a phone call like that."

      Fire drill at the mall yesterday.  Of course we didn't know it was a fire drill while it was happening.  Sirens started going off.  No observable effect on shoppers.  Most seemed to not even notice- no looking around, no asking each other, "what's that noise?"  Nothing.   A few times in the past few months the sirens have started going off and then stopped after a minute or so.  Enough for me to have gotten nervous and asked what the protocol was, should the sirens be for real.  My instructions: "Do what the Gadget Porn guys do." So this time, when the sirens did not stop and were after several minutes accompanied by some sort of official announcement over the PA system which was garbled enough to be completely useless but very threatening sounding, I looked across the way.  Tall Byronic Guy wasn't messing around, he was shooing people out the front door and locking it behind them.   There were four employees in the store and 3 customers.  Carolyn L. had followed a couple into the back of the store and Amanda was helping a woman at the jewelry counter.  LeeAnn, who is new, was wandering.  I was just returning from a bathroom break. "Gadget Porn is evacuating!" I announced loudly, so that Carolyn L. could hear me in the back of the store.  I probably sounded a little excitable.  It was a beautiful day outside yesterday and I had a nostalgic moment thinking back to junior high fire drills where we got out of boring class for ten or fifteen minutes.  Like the customers I assumed nothing bad was happening.  Carolyn L., typically, was not so sure and gave me an alarmed heads up look.  Her couple ambled out, she following behind like a sort of shepherdess.  Amanda heard me as well.  I was standing right next to her by this time.   Amanda, to her jewelry counter customer: "I'm sorry, those sirens mean we have to evacuate now." Customer: "Okay, but first, can you show me those earrings there and tell me a little about your layaway policy?" Amanda: "No, I can't, because right now we are evacuating the store." Customer: "Well, alright, fine then."

      Adventures in Netflix: thoughts on   Timeline  , based on the book by Michael Crichton   they should have just re-made  Goonies    I spent the first quarter of this movie wondering how lines this crappy make it on screen and if Michael Crichton flinched at all if he saw it or by now he just cashes the check and doesn't even blink anymore.  The next quarter I spent thinking, "Enough of this swordfighting bullcrap, let's get back to the guys in the mirrored room and hear some more about quantum physics and faxing people across the country."  But, alas, no, I had to watch a bunch of people run around getting chased by guys with swords. Then the big battle for the castle started and that was cool because then I could spend the second half of the movie wondering how one of my favorite adorable little  urlLink fonts  could share the same name as a medieval  urlLink seige engine .  After all, Trebuchet is a font I usually use when I want to type something like  "Congratulations on Your Engagement" or "Come to the Bake Sale"  .  It doesn't remind me at all of nasty catapulting flaming death or a giant machine capable of flinging dead horses.  Once upon a time I would have sat all night pondering on this, wondering, creating dumb answers in my head.  But now there is the internet and google and 12 billion other people out there, some of whom share my same obsession with font faces, some on an even deeper level, and I easily found my answer.  (Google keywords: font trebuchet history.)   Trebuchet, designed by Vincent Connare in 1996, is a humanist sans serif designed for easy screen readability. Trebuchet takes its inspiration from the sans serifs of the 1930s which had large x heights and round features intended to promote readability on signs. The typeface name is credited to a puzzle heard at Microsoft, where the question was asked, "could you build a Trebuchet (a form of medieval catapult) to launch a person from the main campus to the consumer campus, and how?" The Trebuchet fonts are intended to be the vehicle that fires your messages across the Internet. "Launch your message with a Trebuchet page".   "Font Descriptions and Histories in a Nutshell"  urlLink http://www.comfsm.fm/~dleeling/cis/fontdescriptions.html   Then I watched the DVD extras- I always watch the DVD extras on the crappy movies because I feel like I have to be somehow recompensed.  The director just kept talking about how all the scenes in the movie were with the same group of 6 actors and how it was reminding him of when he made  Goonies .  "You hug one, you had to hug all of them.  You made one cry and they all got mad at you."  This movie would have been greatly improved by being more similar to Goonies in other ways.  Zany inventions, for one thing.  And, never have I ever uttered this before, but (cringe, I can't believe this) perhaps a longer, more elaborate chase scene.  More focus on the geeks, less on the jocks.  It's what Michael Crichton does best in the books and they always frell it up when they make the movies. And a word on DVD extras- I'm going to start keeping a tally of the number of commentaries that are done by people who are either drinking, drunk or hung over.  So far I'm at 2- "A Knight's Tale" and "2 Weeks Notice."  But I just started counting.

       what was that line about little cat's feet...?   Nola quit the mall salon.  Her favorite new topic of conversation is everything she is not going to miss about working there. "God, I am not going to miss that at all." Caroline: "What?" Nola: "Cat, the girl who meowed." Caroline: "She meowed at people?" Nola: "Yeah, like she'd walk by you and just say 'meow meow' at you or you'd say, 'Hey, Cat, how's it going?'  and she'd say, 'Meow.'  Cat wasn't even her real name.  She just called herself that." Caroline: "Because she liked to meow?" Nola: "Maybe.  I guess.  She was a freak.  I won't miss her at all." Caroline: "When she cut people's hair, did she go like this?" ( Caroline curled up a fist like a cat paw, licked it and then ran it down Nola's hair .) Nola: "No, but oh god, it would be so funny if she had." Caroline: "That would be a good sketch." Nola: "Yeah it would.  'Meow.  I'm a cat and I'm going to cut your hair.  Meow.'" Caroline and Nola then started meowing and cat-grooming each other for the hilarious benefit of Self and Also-Ran and Hawaiian Manager over at Gadget Porn Central.

      Caroline last night, re: the bouquet of lilacs that Beth brought in on her last day: "Oh my gosh, these are just so pretty I want to smash my face into them all the time."  We then had a discussion trying to figure out why we both get the urge to headbutt things we find aesthetically pleasing. They have replaced the ATM kiosk that I use in the mall.  Now the location of the security camera is a very obvious little black window at the top of the machine.  I know that this is for my own protection or perhaps the bank's protection and therefore, by extension, my money's protection, but every time I withdraw money, my eye catches that little panel and I just really really want to smash my face into it.  I haven't done it yet, but sometimes I assuage the urge by just staring into it for a really inappropriate amount of time after I have finished my transaction. I'm leaving my mark on the world.  12:43pm- withdrew $20.  12:50pm, used credit card to purchase sunglasses on sale.  12:52pm, made eye contact with security camera at entrance of department store.  etc etc etc   8:50pm, made blog entry, post and publish.

      So now I have two jobs.  I've added "part-time reference librarian" to my resume.  And an additional seven hours to my work week.  Which doesn't sound like a lot, but makes for very long Tuesdays as that is the one day where I do both jobs and am at work for 12 hours straight.  It remains to be seen whether or not I have the constitution to maintain such a schedule.  Nola does it twice a week and has, off and on, for over a year.  But then Nola is now also suffering from kidney stones and has to move again because living with Kate was no longer working out so there are not a lot of ways in which I would want my life to resemble Nola's right now.

       These are days...  To summarize since January: Alice- laid off, dropped off face of planet Lenny- (courier) quit to start his own gallery.  Now the big boss man has to drive all the sh*t between stores and he is NOT pleased about it. Kate- was offered assistant manager position for $4 more an hour at the gadget porn store but turned it down on principle and because she was concerned about being bored and constantly sexually harrassed by her co-workers.  Also, the UPS guy definitely has a crush on her.  Also, she is trying to get back together with her estranged husband, who is unemployed. Nola- quit her job at the Snooty Salon, tried to fill in hours at the gallery, but was told that there weren't enough for her.  Fortunately, found a job at the Mall Salon and was able to move into Kate's spare room.  Mall Salon job, it turns out, does not pay for crap, so Nola now works 60 hours a week between there and Gallery.  Also, her brother was arrested on the same day that Nola missed work at both jobs waiting 9 hours in the emergency room to find out that she has kidney stones.  Also, she has no health insurance. Gigi- got pg, quit. Beth- Went to New Mexico for a week.  Saw life passing her by.  Came back.  Quit. Caroline- She and husband moved in with his mom. Carolyn L.- husband had heart attack. Barb- dog died. Trini- immediate family member had breakdown. Amanda- what's her story? Me- well, there was that time that I fell off the stool...

       The grass is always greener...   Craptastic day today.  I feel the need to either eat something or buy something.  Dr. Phil would so disapprove. There was a lot of swearing going on DT today.  And not cute, feisty, frolicky swearing.  Every "Fuck!" was bleated with the subtext of, "God, if just one more thing gets fucked up today, it's going to be the end of me.  I just can't handle this constant torment."  Constant torment being things like, y'know, momentarily misplacing your keys or jamming your thumb on a doorframe.   I sliced my thumb open with the tape dispenser- shut up, it totally hurt.  It bled all over the styrofoam peanuts and tissue paper in the box I was packing.  But did you hear me swearing up a storm?  NO.  I sucked it up because THAT'S WHAT YOU DO, PEOPLE.   Either that or you make a  urlLink voodoo doll .  I personally like to go home, where I have some privacy-- have I told this story before?  oh well, you'll hear it again-- and I like to draw a picture of the person who botthers me and I write their name on it.  Usually I add a speech bubble with them saying something stupid.  Then I take the picture in my bathroom, set it on fire and then throw it into the toilet (I'm a safe voodoo practitioner.)  Amanda goes ahead and draws the picture while still at work.  Then she uses a thumbtack to drill out the eyes and/ or heart of the poophead.  Then she feels bad about it.  Then she doesn't feel bad about it anymore.

       You know you're watching too many crime dramas when...   Last night Caroline and I were not up to much, just watching the customers go by.   CAROLINE: "That man looks very wholesome." ME: "Which one?" CAROLINE: "That one just going out the door." ME: "You think he looks wholesome?" CAROLINE: "Yeah, very all-American.  With his khakis and his loafers and his sweater vest and his bald spot and his toy store bag.  Probably going to go get in his station wagon and drive home to his kids, maybe pick up a happy meal on the way." ME: "Sure.  Okay." CAROLINE: "What?  Isn't wholesome the word for him?" ME: "Or pedophile." CAROLINE: "You're sick and nasty." ME: "Mmm.  I try." CAROLINE: "This is fun.  Let's make up stories about everybody that goes by, okay?"  And that's just what we did, little childrens.  And they were all very rude and full of violence and inappropriate overblown slurs based on little more than bad fashion choices.  Or at least mine were.  Caroline likes stories about princesses and pet monkeys.

       Dream therapy, downtown:  Second day DT yesterday.  This time at least everyone acted like I was somewhat supposed to be there.  Instead of some sort of spy, they treated me like an out of town country cousin sent to learn about urban sophistication for the summer, whose ways were strange but quaint.  Or maybe a foreign exchange student.  Next week I'm hoping I can maybe upgrade my role all the way to that of foster child dumped on snarky, materialistic, unsuspecting bachelor uncle- played by Keanu Reeves or Hugh Grant-- who teaches said uncle and all his cynical friends a thing or two about life, love and what it means to be human in this mixed up crazy world of ours. I'm learning fast-- when to jump into a conversation and when to just smile and nod (the smiling and nodding gets me teased for being "shy" but seems to earn me major points on the "niceness" scale.)  I'm learning why everyone seems to be perpetually running around with all their projects, even when they're not working on them, even the people who have their own desks and offices.  The place is in constant chaos, like one of those football gameboards that works by turning it on and the whole thing vibrating and sending the figures on top of it cruising around to new positions, colliding with each other.  I set three boxes down on a cart in the back room, being promised that the cart was "my workspace" and I could use it for the day.  I was then dragged away from the cart to take advantage of another desk that had opened up to do some data entry.  Came back to the cart after lunch.  Contents of cart had been redistributed as follows: 2 vases taken back out to sales floor (understandable I suppose, even though both clearly marked for anyone literate: "Please return to artist- NOT SELLABLE") 1 box to be shipped for repair relocated to store manager's desk (His comment: "Do you know what this is or why it's here?"  I had half an answer for him, which seemed to be more than he was hoping for.) 2 boxes to be transported to other stores vanished entirely. I rescued the repair box and kept my trap shut about the rest.  If it doesn't get dealt with I'm just figuring it will vibrate past me again next week.  They all go running around, I'm going to take the radical approach of sitting still and just grabbing the stuff as it comes by me, trusting in the baggage carousel of fate.  Otherwise I shall go mad. Like Chicken Little.   Chicken Little on dishes in the break room: "Well, I'm washing all these dishes.  But I am not going to deal with  those . I do not deal with lipstick on coffee cups.  I just do  not ." Chicken Little on dream analysis: "I had a dream last night that Jamie got all mad at me cuz I kept spilling shit on her.  Like I was carrying around coffee or something and then I just kept dumping it down her front and she was all, 'Omigod!' and pissed at me.  And I just kept doing it." I've only been down there a total of 14 hours but it is so far my assessment that everyone DT hates Chicken Little.  Which I am all on board with.

      So it's not just me.  Barb is on some sort of nervous tear and it's making us all edgy.  Some more than others.  I thought she just had resentment issues with my defecting to DT and playing dumb whenever she made not-so-subtle suggestions that I play double agent.  But Kate and Nola are about ready to string her up by her new dye job and throw hot flamey things at her.  Last night after she left Nola and Caroline and I discussed the possibility of an intervention and then decided that it might just make things worse.  This is something I never thought I would see happen- the day I look forward to being transferred DT because it's  less  emotional and political there. The nefariousness and intrigue has infected Amanda, who is making weird little power plays around the store.  She has claimed two glass displays from Nola and whenever anyone moves anything around in them, fifteen minutes later Amanda is back "fixing" it.  She also has started secretly picking on Trini for no good reason.  Right now she's got a low profile about it, I think me and Caroline and Trini are the only ones who've noticed.  I don't think she's being intentionally evil.  I just think she's competetive.  Which is so unheard of at the Gallery that, if she keeps it up, everyone is likely to think she's crazy, rather than promote her, which is what she must be hoping will happen.  She still seems so nice to me.  With her pink kindergarten teacher sweaters and her soft little voice.  Like a little bunny with fangs.

      Six month anniversary.  I have been blogging since November 9. Here are some words from others:  "Three things in human life are important: the first is to be kind; the second is to be kind; the third is to be kind." --Henry James  "Hell is other people."  --Jean-Paul Sartre

      Started phasing into DT yesterday (I got promoted, if that's what you call it when they offer you a job that doesn't necessarily pay more but has more responsibility and comes with its own office- and by office you should understand me to mean "crawlspace with view of filing cabinets").  Was back at the mall today, everyone else asked, "So, how'd you like it?"  But Barb asked, "So, do they make fun of us down there all the time or what?"  For like 30 seconds I could not even answer.  Finally I just blurted, "Why what an odd question!"  This was something I'll admit to being afraid of- if the Store is some kind of dysfunctional family I'm now involved in a very passive aggressive custody dispute.  Not that I'm overwhelmingly looking forward to being the odd-smelling monkey in a new monkey cage and having to refind my position in a totally messed up social hierarchy all over again, but the sooner this transition is over with and the fewer questions like that one I have to face, the better.    Thinking about Barb's question, though, the analogy that immediately came to mind was the following quote from Jon Stewart's old stand-up bit:   A Canadian woman was harrasing me and kept asking 'what do Americans think of Canada, you can tell me the truth' so I said 'Uh, we don't. Until we run out of natural resources, you guys are pretty much safe.'  - Jon Stewart

      Thoughts on  Quicksilver  by Neal Stephenson:  It's not about anything so much as it's about entirely everything.  For example:   On men's fashion, circa 1670:    Today, walking across Charing Cross, he was wearing a suit that appeared to've been constructed by (1) dressing him in a blouse with twenty-foot-long sleeves of the most expensive linen; (2) bunching the sleeves up in numerous overlapping gathers on his arms; (3) painting most of him in glue; (4) shaking and rolling him in a bin containing thousands of black silk doilies; and (5) (because King Charles II, who'd mandated, a few years earlier, that all courtiers wear black and white, was getting bored with it, but had not formally rescinded the order) adding dashes of color here and there, primarily in the form of clusters of elaborately gathered and knotted ribbons-- enough ribbon, all told, to stretch all the way to whatever shop in Paris where the Earl had bought all of this stuff.  The Earl also had a white silk scarf tied round his throat in such a way as to show of its lacy ends.  Louis XIV's Croatian mercenaries,  Les Cravates , had made a practice of tying their giant, flapping lace collars down so that gusts of wind would not blow them up over their faces in the middle of a battle or duel, and this had become a fashion in Paris, and the Earl of Upnor, always pushing the envelope, was now doing the  cravate  thing with a scarf instead of an (as of ten minutes ago) outmoded collar....   [page 179]  Just for starters.  You're either bored to tears or hooked like a crack monkey.    Lacking any sugar in my diet for 72 hours now, I'm tweaking on anything I can find and spent about 40 minutes this afternoon reading and re-reading this passage, which goes on for about another page, by the way.  Over and over like a worry stone.  I stopped short of qabalistically rearranging all the letters in the proper nouns, but not that much short.  On Saturday I'll be officially de-toxed and will get to eat chocolate again.  It's good to have things to look forward to.

       Recent Trends on the YAFIC Scene   Two of the New Young Adult Fiction books that I picked up today were written in verse.  urlLink One of Those Hideous Books Where the Mother Dies  by Sonya Sones is, befittingly, written in  a wide open first person kind of verse, like what would happen if you transcribed some 15 year old girl's journal.  urlLink Worlds Afire: the Hartford Circus Fire of 1944  by Paul B. Janeczko is more Spoon River Anthology-style.  Each player gets his or her own moment in the spotlight to tell of the big-top fire that killed 167.    I don't know if it's a coincidence, but based on what I was able to read of both of these at the desk, I'm pretty pleased with the state of affairs of books being written for kids right now.   E.B. White, author of  Stuart Little , but also an editor of  The New Yorker  once said something like, "If you have to change gears to write for children, you're going to strip your gears."  Anyone who thinks kids books are just for kids should pick up one of Jon Scieczka's picture books.  Oh, and by the way, if anybody can pass the word along to Jeff Bezos, this whole "search inside the book" functionality they added at amazon.com just turned the search box in to a total piece of crap and I now have started to take my business to barnes and noble and powells.  Just because you can figure out how to do something, doesn't mean that you should.  And I have yet to have anyone explain to me why the quick search box searches inside the book.  How is that helpful AT ALL?     My Powers of Librarian Clairvoyance Are Increasing   GIRL: Do you have that book... umm... it's called like "Aristotle... something"... it's supposed to be about how there was never really a Jesus... ME: Do you mean  The DaVinci Code ? GIRL: Oh, yeah!  That's totally the one!  She wasn't as excited anymore when I told her that the waiting list was 542 people long.

       Summer Reading   Just started  Call of the Mall  by Paco Underhill.  Stay tuned for raves.  Anyway, he claims to be a  retail anthropologist .  Such things exist?  My God, why wasn't I  told ?  I'm going to start work on my research grant right now!   Since I'm back at the mall anyway.  DT and the Queen Bee may hate my guts, as I hate theirs, but I'm still a big fish in my beloved little suburban pond.  And there's nothing like a trip to the evil urban empire to make this little country mouse appreciate her previous bucolic existence.  Mouse is probably the wrong rodent, though.  Mallrat.  Say it loud.  Say it proud.  Paco knows where I'm coming from.  Paco's shopping vocab word o' the week:  Meanderthal - you know 'em, you've seen 'em, they thwart me daily on my dash to Starbucks.

      Wow.  This pickle jar is really stuck.  I wonder if 86 guys on horseback could come open it for me. In other news, don't you love those "confidential" open letters that show up in Dear Abby sometimes?  "Dear P in Q, Yes you should, but please don't ever tell your mother-in-law.  And make sure the monkey has had all its shots.  Remember, your pastor can help you find many valuable local resources.  Good luck, and remember, none of this is your fault."  I want to do one. Dear Ms. H in Seattle- Doesn't Mr. J hate everyone's m-f-n p, just on gen. principle?  Congratulations!  I look forward to hearing about the caffeine overlords and lite beer & nuptual adventures in the home of the apple blossom festival.

      Adventures in Netflix:   D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation   In my continuing self-made film school attempt to watch all 100 movies on the  urlLink AFI's 100 years list , I got around to this, the oldest feature.  And certainly the only one that unabashedly features, in a starring role, as the romantic lead and hero, the entire Ku Klux Klan.  I'm sure entire theses have been written about this movie and endless court documents and reviews exist.  So what can I, li'l ol' me, add to the discussion, I wonder?  What more can be said about a movie that is so of it's time politically and so ahead of it's time technically?  That is so beautifully shot and so disturbingly written?  That is so three hours long?  That features such beautiful actresses and costumes and such atrocious blackface make-up?  That features the incomparable Lillian Gish getting flirtatious with a bedpost?   What I  can  say is that, if you can somehow strip away from your mind all the hateful propaganda, this movie makes the KKK look stupider than the 3 Stooges.  At least the Stooges look like they're being ridiculus on purpose. As I said, the movie has, in the romantic lead, essentially the entire KKK.  There is a handsome young leader for the first half of the film, but once he puts on the hood, he somehow gains an entourage of about 85 guys on horseback that are always with him in everything he does and, due to the hoods, indistinguishable from him.  First, let's take on those hoods.  They look like what they are- dirty bedsheets.  And apparently the important guys get to skip the dunce-cap cones and instead are issued round ghosty heads with 18" toothpicks sticking straight up out of the top.  Like the stingers of giant bees.  Only no stripes and instead of coming out of their butts, the pointy part comes out of their heads. Okay, so you have 86 guys, all looking exactly alike, riding around in their moms' dirty laundry and completely overkilling every situation.  Especially considering the more common Hollywood movie convention of the superman- one lone man is able to defend a cabin against an entire army, rescue the girl, capture the evil supervillain and rebuild the town all on his own.  This movie reverses the convention.  Going up against one guy in a cabin?  Bring 85 guys on horseback with you!  Girl needs rescuing from the supervillain?  Sure, honey, me and my 85 guys will be right there.  It led me to ponder other situations in which 86 KKK guys on horseback could show up and try to make themselves useful.  Change a lightbulb?  Kitten up a tree?  Here comes 86 guys in hoods gallupping up to the rescue.  All in that choppy fast-slow motion of antique movies, too.  Did little Timmy catch the school bus without his lunch again?  Send out the 86 guys on horseback!   Little old lady need help crossing the street?  Good thing there were 86 guys on horseback to help her!  I know that this, socio-historically, is actually a profound statement about the way that the KKK works (no individual responsibility or accountability, fear and intimidation through numbers and anonymity).  But it  looked  like a really stupid SNL sketch.  The kind that they put on at about 12:50am, when they're sure nobody's watching anymore.

       from my daily horoscope   Confrontational people are just crying out to be heard, and their style is unique. It's fun to watch them take it down a notch when they see that they're not getting to you. Skip the conflict and cut to the resolution. Set an example by checking your weapons at the door. You know what really matters here, anyway.  Suck on  that , Queen Bee

      Long-range planning:   Ted Egan has a grand vision for Darwin, one of Australia's most isolated cities. The Administrator of the Northern Territory sees it as a booming metropolis of "a couple of million people" by the end of the century, as tropical Australia undergoes a radical transformation.    That's right, kids, the end of the century.  That would be the 21st century.     "I would hope that in the next 100 years there's a real move to industrialise the north," the former singer told BBC News Online. "It could be very, very exciting." ....  Darwin once had a reputation as a heavy-drinking haven for dreamers and misfits, but it is now re-branding itself as Australia's commercial "Gateway to Asia".    Read the  urlLink whole original article  on the BBC  I've been to Darwin.  Bought a didjeridu there.  Remind me to tell you about it sometime.

       See n' Say   It's possible that more people use Google and Yahoo because they have better serach algorithms, but really, with all the swapping back and forth of who owns who's search engine ( urlLink www.searchenginewatch.com ), the more obvious reason is that they are way more fun to say than, for example, alltheweb.com or, even lamer, about.com.  (Links not provided because what's the point?)  If it's got a catchy name, even if it's a long one, it stands a lot greater chance of getting randomly stared at by me while I while away hours between job searching and helping patrons at the library desk.  I get the abbreviations for all the entertainment "news" magazines confused (is it ew? eonline? which is the one that I'm hating this week because they were too ass-kissy to Britney Spears?).  But I always remember  urlLink Zap2it.com .  I'll even remember really long adresses if they're fun, like  urlLink www.televisionwithoutpity.c om and  urlLink www.whosaliveandwhosdead.com . Here's a list of a few others of my favorite places on the web that are fun to say as well as fun to surf:  urlLink  www.stomptokyo.com  - For all your monster movie needs.   urlLink www.rathergood.com  - Home of Angry Kittens, Spong Monkeys and a Giant Bee   urlLink www.slashdot.com  - I won't bother posing like I know what's going on with this one, but dang it's fun to say.   urlLink www.everything2.com  - First there was everything, then there was everything else.  Because it's interactive.  urlLink  www.h2g2.com  - same song, British verse.  Well, not entirely, this one is based (ever so loosely) on the  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  by Douglas Adams. Further television disection can be found at:   urlLink www.jumptheshark.com     urlLink www.straightdope.com  - has been fighting ignorance since 1973, as their logo says, it's taking longer than we thought.   urlLink www.bushorchimp.com  - is what it says And the ultimate in time-wasting fun-saying web-surfing name-calling, where I go for all my cockroach-racing, robot-fighting, wacky inventions information needs:   urlLink www.boingboing.net    In an unrelated internet adventure, Wendy Molyneux educates us all on  urlLink How to Tell People You're a Billionaire Without Sounding Obnoxious . My personal favorite:  3. My, what a cute baby. I have a baby at home made entirely out of one-hundred-dollar bills. Why do you think Jesus loves me so much? Is it because I am a billionaire?

      Sucktastic conversation with the Queen Bee about my (self-de)termination of employment.  Got lots more hours at the library, though.  And many sympathy calls.  "Sorry your job sucked and you had to quit"- new greeting card category.  Perhaps I will start a new line in all this newly acquired FREE TIME.  I know I should probably be worried about how I'm going to make my rent, etc., but the sun is out this week and the pool is open and I can't seem to make myself care about anything else for a while. Working retail means that you are essentially everyone's bitch.  You have to serve the public.  The public is a lot of people.  And your job description is to serve  all of them .  I thought doing bookkeeping downtown would save me from this universal bitch-dom.  As it turned out I was still everyone's bitch.  Only I was my co-workers' bitch instead of the public's and I didn't have any fellow bitches to ease my burden.  I was the only bitch on the island.  I lost myself for a while there.  I was like the deer that accidentally jumps a fence and winds up on the field of a major sporting event.  No more sign of the graceful majestic woodland crature, I just kept darting around, slamming into things because I couldn't identify them or reconcile them with my knowledge base, reacting instead of acting, twisting and bucking.  I wasn't myself.  Then I made the decision to quit and all at once, The Bitch was back.   When you're the low drone on the totem pole, a universal bitch, you don't weild much power.  No responsibility, either, so that's usually the pay off.  But no power.  The one power you have, the one way in which you can totally lord it over your employers is the knowledge you have of when you are going to quit.  Barring those bad sitcom scenes that go something like, "You can't fire me I quit!"  "You can't quit, you're fired!"  You can decide at any time, hey, I'm done here, and there is nothing they can do to stop you from leaving.  And weilding this sword is wonderous joy-inducing.  I'm positively drunk with sword-weilding, job-quitting power.  No one can touch me.  I am the QUITTER.  And they never saw it coming.  Poor bastards.  It's like if that deer, the one on the baseball field that you were all laughing at on "America's Most Humiliating Home Videos" all of a sudden kicked a famous athlete in the groin, jumped back over the fence and then hotwired somebody's jeep and drove off.  To Mexico.  To be a movie star. Open PS to Queen Bee: Here.  You can have your stupid bus pass back.  Sheesh.   "What am I going to do?  I'm good for exactly two things.  International superstardom or helping a vampire with a soul to rid the world of evil.  It makes for a short, but colorful, resume."  --Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter)   Angel   (season one)

      Diary of a Quitter...   Top Ten Ways to Know It's Time to Quit Your Job   10. You walk past a homeless panhandler on your lunchbreak and think to yourself, "keep your own hours, get to work outside in the sun, I could do that..."  9. Everytime someone explains a new bookkeeping procedure to you, you think to yourself, "Yeah, like I'm going to be around long enough to ever use that."  8. Any time someone explains anything to you, you think to yourself, "Bullshit."  7. Your direct supervisor, who is training you, is out sick.  You show up ready for work and instead of being glad to see you, your other supervisors have a discussion- with you in the room- as to who is going to "babysit" you that day.    6. While listening to any interview on "Fresh Air" on NPR with anyone who is doing any sort of work that they enjoy, you feel an uncontrollable urge to weep and throw things off your porch.  5. You spend most of your time away from your job (including hours when you should be asleep) worrying about your job.  4. You find yourself being very glad that your employer educated you on what it means to work in an " urlLink at-will employment  state."  Yes, they can fire you at any time, but you can (as I am probably about to) simply call them up and tell them you're not coming back.  Ever.  3. You are no longer sleeping.  Except at your desk.  2. It is easier to figure out how you're going to survive on crackers and peanut butter and $500 a month income for the next three months than to figure out how you're going to get through the next three hours.  1. It makes you vomit.  Literally.  PS: Like my new template?  It's blogger-ific, I think.

      Just so everyone knows I'm not having a total disassociative event due to work-related stress, I shall revisit  Adventures in Netflix!  Yay! :  urlLink  Shallow Grave  - the movie that asks   How many roommates does it take to dismember a corpse?   This is a taut, gorey little psycho thriller with a few good nasty ouchie scares and a bit of flair.  Not as much style as, say, " Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ," but fewer unkindnesses, and lovely Ewan MacGregor in his undies as well.  The ending is the payoff, but the film also has several thought-provoking character developments that shed light on the barely capped volacno of psychodrama that is roommate relations.  Three is not a harmonious number of roommates.  This movie gets that spot on.  I know from experience and from discussions with several friends.  It's a universal truth that in times of conflict, two roommates will gang up on the third.  Who, if things follow the pattern in  Shallow Grave , crouches in the attic all day, plotting, brooding, spying on the other two and clubbing all invaders of his/her personal space in the skull with a hammer.  CAROLINE: "Wow that is a loud phone." ME: "Apparently all phones in Scotland sound like that." GIGI: "Really?" ME: "Well, no.  I've never been there.  I'm just making an assumption from what I've seen in this movie here.  It was supposed to be sort of a joke.  It kind of sucked.  I'm tired." CAROLINE: "How did I miss that this movie is in Scotland?"  " Normally I don't usually meet people, unless I already know them ." -David (Christopher Eccleston),  Shallow Grave

      Pardon me for not having written for some time.  It's a shame, too because I would've been a flippin genius on the sardonic observation and witty asides tip, lemme tell ya.  Insomnia, low blood sugar, high pollen counts, anemia, the period to end all periods (period?  more of an exclamation point, really-- or no, more of a %#*@!!!) and caffeine deprivation combined with the stress of starting a new job where all the computers were simultaneously failing created in me the sort of adorable pithy weltschmertz usually found only in persons suffering from stigmata or heroin withdrawal.  Presented with the unearthly trial of being unable to locate a black sharpie of appropriate thickness for labeling shipment boxes, following so closely after my getting snapped at for leaving the packing tape in the incorrect storage position (sticky edge must be perpendicular to horizontal storage surface- IDIOT! STUPID! STUPID!) I found myself creating a comparison study between my life and that of the Biblical Job.  In all seriousness.  When the printer didn't feed correctly I decided it might be best for me to just end my life.  I may not have been writing to you today if I could have figured out how to do myself a harm with a  urlLink swingline stapler .  Fortunately, my brain was too nutrient starved and shriveled in my skull, cappillaries writhing and neurons cramping from lack of caffeine, for me to play my CSI game and  urlLink figure out how to make a weapon out of an office supply .   My excuses are listed above- tired hungry menstrual crazy.  Everyone else down there, however, thought I fit in wonderfully.  Have you seen that  urlLink FedEx commercial  where three guys go all Shatner about an overnight package, saying, "Doomed!" and you're supposed to laugh because it's just a simple task.  Working downtown so far is like that commerical, only NOBODY'S KIDDING.

       Because you asked for it...   "Summer Sale: Botox, $10 unit"  Yes, you can get Botox injections, laser surgery and a face peel at the mall.  It's a weird little salon place with some tropical palms in the waiting room area right at the front (so everyone can see you there, waiting for your Botox).  They used to have it down by the children's play area.  That didn't last long and as soon as a spot became available they moved elsewhere.  Now they are positioned very cleverly- between Sears and Nordy's in the Urban Slutwear cluster (GAP, A&F, AE Outfitters- with JCrew not far off, but as we've said, in previous entries, JCrew is trying to distance itself from its Urban Slutwear cousins geographically and demographically.  And GAP is not really Urban Slutwear, it really is a quite respectable alternative, I have no complaints against GAP when people shop there responsibly, but the ugly truth is that it is the gateway store for many urban slutwear addicted teens.)  Confronted by all the swarms of Attractive Young Hooligans as they walk between Sears and Nordy's the Nuvo International target audience is slammed again and again with images and live action examples of how smooth and sexy Youth is and then, right there, they are given the answer.  On sale for $10 a unit.  Well, they're given two answers, because Sweet Factory is right on that corner as well, so they could just drown their sorrows in Jelly Bellies (tm).    I'm wondering, though, if Nuvo should have gone with the sale approach.  Because who wants to confess they got their Botox on sale?  It's like Department Store make-up counters.  They never have discounts, apparently because they think it's low-class or something (if you're OK buying discount lipstick, you probably buy your lipstick at Walgreen's- not at the makeup counter, so they're not losing your business anyway), they just have "free gift with purchase."    But I can't really figure out who goes to the mall for Botox anyway, so maybe they do have to aggressively go for the Walmart shoppers.

       Watch Out for the Bad Green Implant   In an effort to promote their new series "Dr. 90210" which is, I'm led to believe from the hype, a reality show version of "Nip/Tuck" (because evidently the plastic surgery as entertainment market isn't saturated enough), e! online brings you   urlLink Ka-Boob!     "Now, because you asked for it--you did, right?--we offer you a game where you can live out a fantasy Beverly Hills life. In Ka-Boob!, you are an aspiring actress in search of a larger, more fame-friendly bosom....   How to play? It's easy. Catch the falling implants to score points and advance through the levels. If you drop an implant, you lose a turn; you get three turns before the game is over. Keep an eye out for the good purple implant, which increases the points you can rack up, and the bad green implant, which will cause you to lose a turn."   Did we ask for it?    Did we?    I can't be sure, but I think somebody down in Hollywood's been sucking on a dumb stick.  Maybe two or three people.  Maybe more.  And for your information, the only reason I wound up at E!Online was because I was reading up on Marlon Brando.  Does it seem to you that famous people tend to die in batches of fairly equal fame?  I'm speaking here of Reagan, Ray Charles and Brando.  A little less than a year ago we had John Ritter and Johnny Cash (the relative fame gague for these two would probably depend on your generation).  A historical example would be presidents Thomas Jefferson and  urlLink John Adams , who died within hours of each other on the 4th of July, 1826.  (Adams' last words were, allegedly, "Thomas Jefferson survives," which, sadly, was not true.)    I shall have to do some research.  It could all just be an artifact of the way news cycles in the media work, but...  I don't mean to be disrespectful at all.  Exact opposite.  I'm interested in the way this TV-loving nation grieves for its celebrities.  Does that seem morbid?  I have no problem with that.  If you do, you can go play with some falling boobs.

Can you find a video for my friend?  Well, she's not really my friend.  She's just this girl who is here with me.

      Was unwell again today.  The bowels.  The bowels will be my downfall. My enemies got together to present me with a gift basket.  They have no money and we have very little food, but they collected trinkets that they found in the hold and presented them to me as gifts.  Many odd treasures were in the small basket, as everything that shakes loose anywhere in the ship during a storm eventually rattles its way down to the hold.   I was given: two nails (one slightly rusty, one very rusty) seven coins from seven different currencies a bent piece of wire that slightly resembles a galaxy a perfectly round stone four pieces of broken glass (which they wrapped carefully in a dirty cloth)- three clear and one blue an intact green vial (perhaps for specimens) a very old candy a lock (rusted over, unusable) ten keys (none to the lock) a mummfied bird a postage stamp (perfect condition- one of them must have been saving it in his pocket) some buttons

      Thanksgiving was excellent and hardly marred at all by the ungodly carrolling of the penguins.  I threw a boot at two of them and made eye contact with Charles- he seemed to be somewhat embarrassed by the behavior of his new friends, but did not make any other moves to re-establish contact.  We ate oatmeal and brie and listened to  urlLink Alice's Restaurant  on the shortwave, as we have done every year for the past 200 years.  Then we danced.  Arthur is very graceful when drunk on ceremonial wine.  I slept fitfully.  My enemies uncomplainingly returned to their watch for the squid, it was quite noble of them and I am beginning to rethink their enemy status.

      The penguins are building Something out on the ice.  Charles seems to have been adopted by their King. My enemies, while crawling about in the hold trying to find blankets to warm them on their squid vigil, discovered a forgotten stash of oatmeal and our Spirits became buoyant.  Thanksgiving will be a special meal, not just another dolling out of the daily hardtack and brie.  I have authorized Arthur to open the last remaining barrel of ceremonial wine.  Penguins and squid be damned, tonight we feast and count our blessings.

      Charles, the ship's linguist, has defected to the  urlLink penguins .  I have known about his secret signals to them during the night, he watched them through the spyglass for weeks and learned their peculiar language.  I have loved Charles like a brother for most of our lives.  I hope for all our sakes he knows what he is about with this.  He fled last night and all morning I have been watching him in their camp, all of them swaggering menacingly around like homeboys with their jeans sagged down.  I trust Charles to not reveal the ship's secrets to his new tribe, but lately he has been acting quite mad and the idea of him scheming with the penguins has made some of the crew uncomfortable.  I don't know how long I can put them off from some kind of bloody massacre.  They are quite bored and in need of entertainment, of which even Arthur has to admit we are in short supply. My enemies in the hold relay no soundings of the squid, but they complain plaintively about the smells.

      The talent show was full of bitterness and barely stifled jealousies.  Arthur, however, is blissful after being called for 6 encores. I have just awoken from a ghoulish nightmare that made me writhe in my sleep and my heart beat so that I thought my chest would cave in.  I dreamt that while we sat here, clamped in the ruthless ice, from deep below the surface where the murderous ocean is still liquid, we were attacked by that which is our prey and mission-  urlLink the collossal squid .  It wrapped its tentacles around the hull, bursting it like a child's toy ball, and then those unholy tentacles forced their way inside, following the rush of searing icewater through the passageways belowdecks, grabbing all those men who could not flee fast enough or who had abandoned all hope and let themselves be taken by the razor sharp, boneless grip of the evil squid, rubbery, like overcooked noodles, but also able to slice like knives.  And the men twisted and screamed in the squid's arms, torn apart were they by the eviscerating pasta embrace of the massive invertebrate swum up straight from the fire and ice of the hellish ocean trenches beneath this continent of cold.  How I hate the creature and wish we had never come to its land.  Even the contemplation of my beautiful map is not enough to cool the fever of this ghastly nightmare in my brain.    I will send for Arthur.  I will station my three enemies belowdecks, in the lowest part of the ship's hold, to spend the nights listening for the attack of the squid.

      My map of Antarctica remains incomplete, the ink has frozen and cannot be thawed with what little is left of the lamp oil.  We remain clamped in the ice.  Soon, the penguins will overrun the ship and the crew will begin trying to eat each other.  Arthur remains optimistic, however, and is, at this moment, working on his madrigal arrangement of "Oops, I Did It Again," for the talent show this evening.

      The little girls brought me a message in a bottle that they found while wandering on the ice this morning.  The bottle was of beautiful cranberry cut glass and the paper inside made of silk and cotton fibers and most inviting to touch and rub against one's tear-stained cheeks, if one were so inclined. The message enclosed read as follows:  "We hunt them encyclopedically in order alphabetical to leave any uncataloged and free is to our mission antithetical."

      Chaos spreads daily throughout the Library.  The Crew have started making their lists on the walls, which are all of ice and easily carved into with any sharp implement.  Some of the crew members have become disruptive and have begun trying to deface others' lists.  Some do this by scratching, other less bright individuals attempt to lick the lists off the walls.  I have had to put the young lady stowaways on patrol with squirt guns which they keep perpetually filled with warm water to rescue the unfortunate ones who get stuck, but so many have tried and there are only the three little girls, some of the men do have to wait over an hour before assistance arrives.  Seeing all this is heartbreaking for me, but Charles assures me that penguin intelligence has the Librarians already at the edge of the ice floe.  Depending on the truth to the rumors about the ice breaking abilities of the Panizzi, we estimate them to be three days out.  I detest this waiting.

      To continue with the tale...  After we had rounded up the entire crew, Charles revealed the nature of the Something that the penguins had built.  It was to be a library- the Great Antarctic Library.  It is palatial with seventeen spiral staircases, fourteen levels of reading rooms, four towers, three levels of catacombs, a formal parlour, a mezzanine, a ballroom, a reference desk of fortress-like proportions and 185 rooms altogether.  It also has its own lighthouse, manned by several Fairy Penguins down from Tasmania on summer vacation.   "Why a library, Charles?" I asked him. "To attract the Librarians," he replied.  The little stowaways exchanged significant looks, but I did not follow.  Charles elaborated, "I do not fault you for not being aware, my captain, for they keep their infamous power a deep secret, but there are tribes of Librarians, migrating like nomads about the earth.  There is a particularly large and formidable seagoing horde and they are rumored to have a fearsome icebreaking ship, known as the Panizzi.  The Librarians are attracted anywhere they sense disorder, they feel compelled to re-organize and catalog and taxonomize..." "Oh, how awful!  I don't want to be stuffed!" cried Estelle. "Taxonomize, not taxidermize," said Charles patiently.  "It means to create hierarchies of terms and to label things carefully.  So they are drawn to libraries and particularly to libraries that are in a state of chaos.  The King Penguin, who told me of the rumors he had heard of them, and I have set out to create for them a library in such irresistible chaos that not even the Antarctic ice will stop them from coming here, and smashing open a channel behind them as they do.  We can use it once we get your glorious HMS Juvenile Delinquent (Humpty-Dumptied) back together again." "How will we do that, though, Charles?  The crew have all gone mad." The King Penguin had come over to join our conversation.  He uttered some utterances and Charles translated.  "These problems, he said, are but trifles to such prodigious and powerful Librarians as the crew of the Panizzi.  They will come and they will know what to do.  The King Penguin is skilled in diplomacy, he will help us deal with them." So we ushered in the Ice Mad crew, carrying their bits of HMS JD (flotsam) and set them loose in the Great Antarctic Library to create irresistible chaos and a siren song for the Pirate Librarians of the Panizzi. I am summoned to mediate a dispute, I will return shortly with more naration.

      Captain's log:  Oh, what an eventful Christmas!  Most of the crew are now enclosed in the Great Antarctic Library and we await in slightly less exposed conditions the arrival of our rescuers, which the newest battallion of penguins- a tribe of  urlLink Emperors  all the way from Dronning Maud Land, reported were already on their way thanks to our frenzied efforts throughout Christmas Day.   Perhaps I should start at the beginning. Charles showed up, breathless, at the igloo door, his eyes alight with a fire of excitement the likes of which I had not seen since our childhood days when his clever scheme to build a tunnel system from our dormitory to the Deep Gardens first entered his agile young brain.  "Come, come, Veronica," he said- and I knew then that all would be well.  Charles has always called me Veronica when he wants to be jocular.  It has never been my name.  "Captain, captain," he cried, "Come, my plan is underway, we must prepare for our rescue!  Are you well?  Are your enemies well?  Will you help me?" "Of course, beloved brother Charles!" I cried and "Hurrah!" and "Bully-oh!" cried my enemies. "Where is Dr. Bippie, he has not fallen ill, as well, has he?" Charles asked. It was the first time in over a day I had thought of the Dr.'s whereabouts.  We immediately returned to the shipwreck and cried out for Dr. Bippie.  Out on the ice, the scattered crew heard us and some shouted back whatever craziness popped into their fevered heads.  Somehow, over the din, Dr. Bippie heard us and gave up a shout- "Captaine!  Charrrrrrle!  We are in ze penderie furr les pickles!"  After Charles and my enemies and I got over our initial confusion about Dr. Bippie's garbled mention of dresses for pickles and realized it was just his old brain injury and not the Ice Madness that befuddled his directions, we found him and the young lady stowaways in the pantry.  Ship's Cat yowled when we opened the door and Charles realized with a start that Monkey, the third Ship's Cat, had been hiding in his winter parka lining since he defected to the penguins.  Monkey leaped out of Charles's coat to confront Ship's Cat, who was his sister and whom he had missed.  I hugged Dr. Bippie, who hugged Charles and the three little girl stowaways ran around hugging each other, happy to be out of the pickle closet for the first time in days. "What a lovely reunion this is," sighed Charles, and I could tell he was sincere by the gleaming tears in his violet eyes, "but we have much work to do if we are to be prepared for our rescue.  For if we are not prepared, all the penguins' work on the Structure Which Will Still Not Be Mentioned by Name will have been for nothing and THEY will pass us by with only a desultory glance.  Pip pip!  We must now be industrious!" And industrious we were, dear reader, all Christmas Eve and into the next day, rounding up the meandering crew and collecting every scrap of my beloved HMS Juvenile Delinquent (torn asunder) and herding and tossing them into a sort of holding pen/ corral sculpted from the ice by the penguins.  The newly-arrived Emperors, being the largest of the penguin species, stood watch around the rim and allowed no one out.  Few tried, I was surprised to see.  Most had passed from the more aggressive and suspicious stages of Ice Madness to a mumbling sort of docility, which would be not unpleasant if it were not accompanied by terrifying bombasts of flatulence and periodic urgent needs to speak with lawyers.  Ship's Counsel refused to awake from her nap, so everyone started pacing.  Still, the Emperors kept them in check and didn't seem to mind the farting, which kept me and my sane assistants free to round up the stragglers.  In the end we had only lost one fellow, I presume he fell into a crevasse.  I hope and pray he was not consumed by the squid.  Charles insists that the penguins have told him the sea monster is not a threat to us, but I know that if the foul beast gets once a taste of human flesh, it will not be satiated until it has devoured every last man, woman and child in its territory, which we believe must reach thousands of miles. Oh, dear reader, it has been a long and wearying day.  I have much more to tell, and more work tomorrow, but I can write no longer and must rest for a few hours.  I promise to continue as soon as I have another free moment or two.

Oh, I can hardly stop myself from hoping that we will soon be saved!  I am frumious with anticipation, but I cannot count chickens before they hatch, I am superstitious.  There is one final phase to be completed before THEY come and I will need the assistance of the Captain and Dr. Bippie and the enemies, if they are still free of the Madness.  I am setting out immediately for their igloo.

      Captain's log- My mission has been a failure.  My crew have scattered, taking many important parts of the ship with them.  Soon, I will have to face the loss of the South Polar Exploratory Ship HMS Juvenile Delinquent (trapped in the ice) and all of her crew, somewhere in the Antarctic ice floes.  My enemies and I have built an igloo near what is left of the ship and we watch the penguins, now working more furiously than ever, through the spy glass.  Their comical little motions bring me some solace, but I admit to being quite inconsolable.  I had wanted so badly to see Timbuktu in a high wind and the Siberian steppes in the spring.  Ahh, well.  As Dr. Bippie would say, que sera, sera.

      Thimble, Wimble and Estelle perused for the dozenth time the note that had been curled in the tiny green bottle, written in Smike's exquisite script.  It was a poem:  "Beware the librarians, my sons, The jaws that shush, the eyes that watch, beware their Dewey decimals and shun their dusty tomes of reference, natch."  "What has Smike got against librarians, I wonder?" said Estelle.  "I think they're perfectly lovely people." "I once shared an elevator with a librarian," said Wimble, "she offered me a lolly but mother wouldn't let me take it.  The librarian seemed sad and then she got off at the seventh floor." "But why is Smike warning us about the librarians now?" wondered Thimble. "Ahhhh, eet eeez zeee Ice Meehhdnusss," said Dr. Bippie, who was now also crammed into their pickle closet, as it was one of the few places left on the ship that didn't have gaping holes in the walls from the crew stealing the wood planks for making lists on.  "Eeet, I fur, 'as seized zee crrrew elmost entirrrreleee.  We quatre and ze Captaine et ze trois, 'ow you say eet, enemeees? are ze only ones 'ooo remaine, ahhh, eeeemune.  Smike eeez suspicious of librarrrrians.  Arzhur eez suspicious of ze Pope.  Sheeep's Cook eez suspicious of 'ees own leeetle fingurrr.  We are all doooooomed." "Dr. Bippie, you are silly," said Estelle and bonked him with a spoon.  "We aren't domed at all." "He said doooooomed," corrected Wimble. "Not that, either," said Estelle, "I'm not afraid of no Ice Madness nor no squid, neither." Just then there was a knock on the wall.  A strange, gruff voice, tiny from lack of use, whispered through the knothole.  "They're coming.  Soon.  Be ready."

      While we're on the subject of subplots...  Diary of Charles, Ship's Linguist, HMS Juvenile Delinquent (trapped in the ice)  The HMS JD is being torn apart, piece by piece.  I can only hope my beloved Captain is being spared the Ice Madness that rages through the crew, they have scattered now, about the ice, each clutching their little pile of scraps on which they scribble and mutter.  I have seen no sign of the Captain, nor the Captain's enemies, nor Dr. Bippie, I can only presume that they wish to go down with the ship.  I have sworn that this will not happen, and with the arrival of the newest battallion of Rockhopper Penguins, my hopes have soared of completing my Brilliant Escape Plan in time to rescue most of the crew and the ship.  The Rockhoppers were the lynchpin of the plan, their tireless work ethic and small, energetic bodies required to put the finishing touches on the Great Structure (I do not dare yet utter its true name for fear of putting the final stages of the plan into motion too soon, every step is so finely balanced and perfect, timing must be preserved.)  I am so indebted to the King Penguin for this Brilliant Escape Plan, he and his people have a knowledge of these seas that is vast and they are generous with their information and wonderful hosts and teachers.  It will be sad to leave them, I would love to stay among them on the ice and publish a treatise on their folklore about the squid, which they worship as a deity, but I know I would not survive year round on the ice.  And my first duty is to my beloved Captain.  The only hope for the crew is to get them out of the ice as soon as possible.  I am torn with the need to perform some action, any action, but my work is largely done, the tasks that I can perform have been completed and now I must trust to the business of the Rockhoppers.  I sit, ill at ease, by my lantern, warming my hand and chewing my buttons in nervous anticipation.

      Meanwhile, in the story's first official subplot...  "Thimble," said Wimble, "This is a nasty, dark little room.  We are not happy in it." "I don't know," said Thimble, always the optimistic twin, "It's all right, I think.  There are worse places." "Name one," said Wimble. "Inside the collossal squid's belly." "All right." "Collossal squid's got no belly," said Estelle. "What's it got instead, then?" said Thimble. Estelle's face got a pious look and the child refused to divulge.   Estelle, Thimble and Wimble were three of the four stowaways on board the HMS Juvenile Delinquent (trapped in the ice) and, having been warned by Dr. Bippie of the Ice Madness, they had holed themselves up in a tiny cupboard usually used for storing pickles.  They had Ship's Cat for company.  Ship's Other Cat was loose somewhere and they hadn't seen the third ship's cat, named Monkey, since Charles left the ship.  Smike, the fourth stowaway was also nowhere to be found at the moment, although they supposed he was able to look after himself.  Smike was a bit of an enigma, really.  No one had actually seen him, as he liked to hide in closets and under chairs during the day, but they knew he was around because whenever anyone left out a dish of soup for him after supper by the morning it was gone, a lovely calligraphed thank you note left in its place, signed, "Smike, Esq." Thimble and Wimble were sisters, twins, actually.  Thimble was small and Wimble was tall, Thimble had light hair and Wimble had dark, Thimble liked to dance and Wimble liked to hit things with a hammer, but they were twins.  Siamese twins, in fact.  They were born conjoined at the thumb.  Thimble's left thumb was Wimble's right thumb and they could never agree on, if they should be surgically separated, who would get the thumb.  They were still arguing about it right up until they checked into the hospital to get the surgery, when they had to share a room with Estelle, a little girl who had no thumbs at all.  Estelle was an orphan with brownish blackish reddish curly hair, one blue eye and one purple eye and freckles on half her face.  She had been raised by pygmies and was in the hospital with a cough.  Thimble and Wimble decided to give their thumb to her and then the'd have one thumb each, all three.  And ever since that day they had been the best of friends and the most prodigious hitchhikers the world had ever seen.  They had hitchhiked to Antarctica aboard the HMS Juvenile Delinquent and were planning on hitchhiking to Mars next when they had gotten stuck in the ice.  They had been playing checkers ever since, waiting.  Now Dr. Bippie had told them to hide if they valued their very sanity, but Wimble was beginning to get peeved with the confinement.   Then a bottle came through a knothole in the wall.  Tiny little specimen bottle, green of color, with a roll of paper in it and a cork stuck in at the neck.   "Hello?" cried Wimble.  "What's this?" There was no answer from the other side of the door. They all three waited to hear footsteps in the corridor, but there were none.  They waited a very long time for three anxious little girls to wait.  Until...   "Well," said Estelle, "Let's see what's inside."

      Dr. Bippie has made no progress on the dreadful Ice Madness, he works round the clock and I have to remind him to stop occasionally to eat and drink. I am writing this deep in the hold.  Earlier today I felt myself possibly succumbing to the Ice Madness.  There seemed to be a thousand million things in my head that needed to be put down on paper, pinned down and ordered before they scurried off somewhere else, deeper, burrowed in and went all wiggly inside my brain.  I confessed this fear to my enemies, who invited me to spend the night on Squid Vigil with them.  They claim the vibrations in the hold and the constant listening for the squid focus the mind and eliminate the madness.  We are now, the four of us, huddled around a lantern that glows primarily for warmth and gives very little light.  I listen to the gentle creaking of the ice, I try to listen deeper, outside the hull, for the deep evil thrushing of the squid, the foul silence that I know will come right before the first tentacle pierces the hull, made different and more awful than the rest of the silence by what comes after.  There is also scuffling above.  Those with the Ice Madness are out scavenging above on deck, we listen to them devouring the ship- tearing off planks and bits of sail so that they have somewhere to scribble their lists.  I have given up giving orders to the watchmen to stop them, they are crazed and will not be disuaded and I don't want my crew harmed over bits of flotsam, now with everyone going mad, the ice compacting around us and the squid threat growing nightly.  Let them have what comfort they can in these awful times.  Nights so bad my only comfort is to sit in a dark hole with my enemies and listen for the approach of a monster that has no sound.

      Letting Arthur out to meet with me and share his list of passwords may have been a mistake.  I don't believe he had any contact with other crew members, but Dr. Bippie's dire predictions have come true and the Ice Madness has started to spread.  The primary symptom seems to be a compulsive need to make lists of things.  Every scrap of paper is being snatched up and squirrelled away by the crew members that have succumbed.  We have not yet been able to identify which ones these are, but are working on analyzing the handwriting of the scraps of lists that we find about the ship.  Lists of laundry, lists of favorite foods, lists of favorite books, lists of baby names and inspirational leaders, lists of enemies and strangers, lists of undeniable truths and lists of lies that have been regretted.  Lists of ways to make a fire, ways to drive your roommate insane and ways to skin a cat.  Lists of suspects, lists of weapons, lists of supplies, lists of homonyms and foreign words that sound dirty.  Lists of mineral compounds, languages, state capitols and curses.  The watchmen and my enemies bring them to me as they find them about the ship on their patrols.  My three enemies and Dr. Bippie are the only ones that I trust have not succumbed, and with Charles gone to the penguins and Arthur in captivity, they are the only ones I can express my fears to.   I had another nightmare about the squid.  It did not attack, but I knew it was there, lurking.

      Dr. Bippie has diagnosed Ice Madness and fears that Arthur may be Patient Zero in a shipwide epidemic.  Or I think that's what he said.  Dr. Bippie is sometimes hard to understand due to a childhood brain injury that makes him think he's French.  His accent becomes more pronounced under stress or during periods of excitability, such as now.  But since he only thinks he's French and is not, in fact, French, he speaks no French, just garbled English with a very fake sounding accent, so Jacques the Translator can do us no good.  But I think what he said is that Arthur has Ice Madness and it's going to get worse before it gets better.  I trust Dr. Bippie completely.  The French thing aside, he's a formidable metaphysician and astrological specialist. Arthur has been quarantined, but as he is still working on deriving the perfect password, he hasn't noticed yet.  I have reassigned one of my enemies to Arthur Surveilance.  The other two remain on Squid Vigil and every morning report no activity. I have ordered Dr. Bippie to work on a cure for Ice Madness and sent a message to Charles with a passing penguin, just because I thought he might like to know.

      Arthur has suddenly become quite paranoid.  He has hatched 27 conspiracy theories in the last two days and plagues me with his insane logic day and night.  He is suspicious of Charles, the penguins, my enemies in the hold, the ship's cook, the ship's bootblack, the helmsman, the night watchman, the baker, the four stowaways, certain lanterns in the messhall, one particular chair, the ship's cat and the Pope.  He fears the collossal squid, the ice, ghosts, the reanimation of certain preserved botannical specimens and dinosaurs.  He insists that I am the only one in which he can put his total faith and has demanded that we have a secret password, so that he may at all times know that he is really speaking to me and not some nefarious double created from robotics or black magic.  I have decided to humor him, so that he does no one any harm until the ship's metaphysician can divine what has ailed him so suddenly.  Knowing of his pre-existing personality disorder, I have asked him to compile several lists of possible passwords and then present them to me arranged by order of merit and historical significance, cross referenced with monomythological symbolism.  He agreed so eagerly I practically wept.  This should keep him bundled up in his cabin happily scribbling for the next 48-72 hours, enough time for Dr. Bippie to get a good astrological reading on the situation.

      There are more penguins than ever now.  They come to help with the building, I assume.  The Something has grown incredibly larger and more confusing.  I count seventeen spiral staircases and excavation has begun into the ice for a sublevel of some kind.  Charles has brought them fire and they use it to boil water, which is used for drilling out tunnels below the ice.  Late this afternoon, three penguins approached the ship.  They waited politely in view of my cabin window until I came up on deck and then they moved closer, making it clear through shuffling their feet and swaying their flightless wings upward towards me that they wished to be allowed on board.  I instructed two strong crewmen to lower one of the lifeboats, which the penguins climbed in and were raised up to the deck.  Arthur kept the crew in line as the penguins disembarked, stumbling over each other slightly and then escalating the stumbles into a beautifully choreographed 3 Stooges slapstick routine.  By the end, they had entirely won over the hearts of the men and were welcomed aboard with more heartfelt slaps on the back than even the Incans had been.  The penguins ducked their heads shyly but winningly and mingled gracefully with the crew until I instructed my men to return to work and signalled to the penguins that they should make it known to me why they had requested to come aboard.  They nodded and then turned, as a unit, and proceeded below decks, as though they had the entire ship's plan memorized.  They marched straight to Charles' cabin.  Once I had let them inside, one instructed me through clucks and gestures to pack a bag of clothing for Charles, while the other two worked together to go through his desk, sorting out certain books and papers, which I then was asked to put in the knapsack with the clothing.  The penguins then took the sack from me and walked back up top to the lifeboat.  They performed a gentle ballet for the sailors who had returned to the deck to see them off.  It was only a minute or so in duration and utterly silent, but it was enough to make many of the men and myself weep openly at the beauty of it.  Then they stepped into the lifeboat and I lowered them back to the ice.  They waddled off into the snowy dark white blueness. My heart is full.  I do not know that the penguins can help us, but if we perish here, we do so among wonderful new friends. My enemies continue to listen for the giant squid, but report nothing new.  They were very sorry to have been sleeping and to have missed the visit of the penguins.  I have issued orders this evening that they are to get toast and tea served to them every midnight.  They thanked me kindly for it.

      Two months now trapped in the ice.  Arthur reminds me daily of his concern for our special cargo and its prolonged exposure to the cold.  Besides the missions of my map and the hunt for the squid, we were also charged by Her Majesty with delivering a collection of Joseph Cornell tribute boxes and Etruscan child grave markers to the National Gallery in Hobart, Tasmania.  I give Arthur my assurance that her Majesty would not have allowed the artistic treasures to travel by sea without first packing them and insulating against every kind of weather, but I can see the doubt edging into his eyes. We need to escape this damn ice! What are the penguins up to, I wonder?  I wish Charles would make contact again.  He becomes more like them every day, I saw him yesterday sliding on an ice ramp they had bellied out, zipping around on his stomach with his arms pinched tight to his sides.  The Penguin King confers with Charles for hours in the evening, both gesture at the Something that the penguin builders are working on and mutter conspiratorially.   Some of the crew have suggested we begin trapping and eating the penguins.  I am not ready to take things this far.

      "The time has come, the Walrus said..."  No, I have not run out of imagination, far from it.  It's just that it really is a very long way to Tasmania and we are still all so cold.    The Choose Your Own Adventure Contest    I am initiating among the crew and you, dear readers, a Choose Your Own Adventure Contest.  It shall be a great and mighty contest with much greatness and mightiness.  The rules are these:  1) You may submit ideas for adventures that the HMS Juvenile Delinquent can have on the way to Tasmania.  Consult the  urlLink Dramatis Personae  if you need reminding of existing characters, or invent your own! 2) You may tell a story, such as those submitted by  urlLink Captain Virginia  or  urlLink Arthur  to entertain the crew. 3) You may also submit ideas for adventures that the crew of the Panizzi may have, although these I will have to run by Captain Virginia. 4) If your idea is chosen, it will be included in a future episode of The One Where I Lie Outrageously and All the Time. 5) Please remember that we are playing fast and loose with the space time continuum and also that "reality" as we all darkly perceive it, really shouldn't concern you. 6) Facts are silly things.  Don't be enslaved by them. 7) You must include your pirate name.  If you can't think of one for yourself, I pity you, and direct you to fidius.org's  urlLink pirate name generator . 8) Submit all entries via the Correspondence link at right. 9) If you are Sherman Alexie, Keanu Reeves or the ghost of Lewis Carroll (and can provide proof of such) you will automatically win. 10) If you are a real pirate or Siamese twin or pygmie or penguin or Charlie Chaplin impersonator (and can provide proof of such) you will automatically win. 11) Everyone else has to be brave and interesting. 12) You will receive no prize for winning.  Only notoreity and satisfaction of a job well done and three cheers from all the crew. 13) If you use exceptionally naughty language or disparage your Captain, crew or librarians in any way, you will be thought much ill of and if I have any say in the matter, you will be confined to squid vigil with no oatmeal for an age and an era. 14) There is no deadline.  For I am a generous and expansive Captain.  And also the fast and loose with the space time continuum thing again.  (And everyone was thinking that was just a cute tag line.)

      This afternoon I was finally taken on a tour of the Panizzi's imponderable Stacks.  Librarians aboard the Panizzi have,  urlLink as you may think , access to the finest of web-surfing wifi equipment and incredible databases of knowledge available to them through their PDAs and laptops.  But they are Pirate Librarians, and therefore love tradition and have an incredible archive of ancient texts and modern paperback bodice-rippers and every Dick and Jane and Shakespeare in between.  These they are able to carry about aboard ship thanks to their incredible Stacks, which make use of space-time bending technology passed down ritually from generation to generation of Pirate Librarians (Captain Virginia claims to not even have been through enough initiation ceremonies to be inducted into the Clan of Those Who Know How It All Works).   There is a great door in the middle of the ship below decks, and when you open it, a stiff breeze pours out, smelling slightly like wine and old leather and burning leaves and Dean Martin songs.  As you pass through the door, the temperature seems to drop ten degrees and your hair and any loose papers you may be carrying swirl and blow about you.  The door slams shut behind you with a resonnating "pooooooom."  When it shuts, the air goes still.  Now you stand in a vestibule with torches along the hallway, which descends approximately 30 feet down a shallow grade, carpeted in soothing burgundy, wood paneling and soft, rounded oak railings curving down along either side.  Soft violin music seems to be coming from other parts of the ship, wafting in through vents you cannot see.  At the end of the vestibule, there is another door, this one is also oak, but has several large frosted panes of glass set into it.  Two of these are intricately etched with writings in many languages.  At the bottom, I could read in Gothic lettering like that found on my personal copy of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales: "No food or drink."  To the right of the door, courteously, there is a small set of shelves on which you may leave your lunch bag and tea cup if you have inconsiderately or absent-mindedly brought such things with you.  I inquired and found that small hard candies and cough drops are generally overlooked.  But never peanuts.  Don't even try. When you open these double doors, the wind is even stronger and the temperature drops another five degrees.  Those in the know, I realized, usually brought a scarf or additional woolen sweater with them to do their work in the Stacks. Before you in this new room, which is even more beautifully paneled, there stand the Stacks.  The effect of a first encounter with the Stacks I can only describe as being similar to opening one's cabin door and suddenly being confronted with an entire army standing a nose's breadth away from one's unwashed sleepy face.  The Stacks are Imposing.  The Stacks are Imponderable.  The Stacks require a map and compass or skilled guide for navigation.   There are lighted stripes of tape along the aisles, white lights lead to green, green lights lead to exits.  There are signs posted here and there directing readers to the Way Out, but these signs are often posted directly on the ceiling or down near the floorboards.   The Stacks themselves are loaded with books and tomes, all arranged according to the Librarians' cryptic systems.  And the Stacks roll on wheels so that when Readers do not need to be facing a particular set of shelves, that set may be rolled along and compacted against the other shelves not being used.  Aisles can be opened up by turning great giant cranks at the end of each row of shelves.  One must always give a shout of course, before beginning to crank so that one doesn't squash a fellow reader between the shelves.  There have been a few close calls, I was told, and some Librarians with long, tragic memories now carry stools, benches or apple crates into the Stacks with them to block the shelves apart.   Carts are constantly rolling back and forth along the rows of Stacks, carrying books that are out of place to be sorted and reshelved.  Due to the Stacks' ability to  urlLink play fast and loose with the space-time continuum , they seem to go on infinitely.  I walked and walked and never found myself having crossed my own path.  It also probably affected my brain, having the floorplan constantly changing with all the rolling shelves and carts. No one could satisfactorily explain the wind to me, other than saying "It's the cold air return for the entire ship," which didn't seem right.  Anyway, this constant wind, which was strongest by the door, but always whispering about the shelves, caused micro climates to form in the Stacks.   I found myself in the middle of a not unpleasant spring evening fog while pondering the collected works of Dickens.  Some areas are more prone to cloudburst than others and for preservation purposes, the Librarians have had to install awnings and umbrella racks in certain areas.   I was told that at the very end of the Stacks there was located a Great Globe, which the Pirate Librarians use for keeping track of the other Librarian Hordes, but I was not allowed to see it, being not of Librarian blood.  In consolation, they showed me the Reading Room, which was very cozy and full of overstuffed chairs and newspapers (I did not ask how they got the daily newspapers from every major global city just 24 hours after they hit the streets).  And then they showed me the wall of Portraits (located in the 920's- for biography of course) of all the great Pirate Librarian captains.  Captain Virginia's portrait was not quite finished they explained, so the most recent was still Lady Pendergrass's.  She seemed so familiar, but I just couldn't place where I must have seen her before.   This will trouble me all night.

      I visited Dr. Bippie today to pick up my horoscope and have him readjust my aura.  He passed on a few words from my dear departed Aunt Flora.  I love Dr. Bippie's cabin, it is packed with books- the works of  urlLink Nostradamus , the  urlLink Tao Te Ching , a beautiful  urlLink Creole Bible , the  urlLink Cryptonomicon , the  urlLink Necronomicon , the  urlLink Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,  urlLink Goodnight Moon , and a  urlLink mysterious tome  that seems to move around of its own volition whenever you are not looking at it.  He also has a lovely  urlLink dead raven , stuffed and attractively posed, an antique phonograph, a ouija board, a table that he claims is from ancient Greece, several Egyptian stelae covered with the mysterious dancing script of heiroglyphics and several small broken robot toys- I never know how he breaks them and I wonder now if Jacques has seen these. The  urlLink aura cleansing  was very refreshing and I went about my captain's duties with greater  urlLink vim  following.  I am glad to be feeling not at all like a  urlLink miserable failure  anymore.

      We continue through the open seas towards Tasmania.  The crew entertain themselves with books and videos that they check out from the Panizzi, as well as writing  urlLink asinine poetry  and  urlLink bad haiku .  These last two habits also being things that they picked up from the Panizzi, I'm not sure that the Pirate Librarians are an entirely good influence.  Many of my crew are also now begging me for  urlLink tattoos .  Arthur and Delwin and I prefer to spend our down time  urlLink playing with our legos and reading the Bible .  My enemies debate politics and listen to the  urlLink radio  during the day and weave  urlLink cat's cradles  at night while they listen for the squid.  Dr. Bippie discusses the tarot with Captain Virginia whenever he can and Charles works with Delwin on his penguin lexicon.  The Little Stowaways run about the ship playing with the cats, bothering my enemies and asking all sorts of questions of the Reference Librarians aboard the Panizzi who are of course delighted to have new questions to work on.  Smike continues to hide under chairs and Jacques the Translator sulks about.  I may have forgotten to mention in the Dramatis Personae that Jacques is a robot and so has a great deal of trouble with seasickness.  Mr. Poom is experimenting on him with various  urlLink homeopathic cures .

      Perhaps, since we are at sea and nothing much is happening except  urlLink water water everywhere , today would be a good time to recap the Dramatis Personae for newcomers and all and sundry.  (Especially considering the upcoming Choose Your Own Adventure Contest!- stay tuned.)   The HMS Juvenile Delinquent (South Polar Exploratory)  our beloved ship and home, trapped for a time in the Antarctic Ice, dissassembled by the mad crew and then reassembled by Pirate Librarians, now at sea once more.  Captain- brave and intrepid and full of sugar and spice and puppy dog tails, of course.  Arthur- the Captain's right-hand rabbit.  Frequently adorable.  Charles- lifelong best friend of the Captain, Ship's Linguist, fluent in Penguin.  Delwin- a penguin anthropologist and professional entertainer.  Dr. Bippie- metaphysician extraordinaire, believes he's French although he isn't.  Jacques the Translator- sometimes has difficulty masking the animosity he feels for Dr. Bippie.  Thimble and Wimble- globe-trotting non-identical formerly-Siamese twins.  Estelle- their one-thumbed, raised by pygmies hitchhiking co-conspirator.  Ship's Cat- types 65 wpm  Ship's Other Cat- likes Hank Williams but not "new country"  Monkey- cat  Smike- additional stowaway, rarely seen, lovely penmanship.  Captain's Enemies- they number three.  The Colossal Squid- the Captain's arch-nemesis.   The Great Antarctic Library  Built and staffed by penguins under the direction of Charles and the King Penguin   The Panizzi  The great ice-breaking ship, the crown jewel of the sea going Librarian fleet.  Home to the Pirate Librarians, who do a booming business raiding libraries around the globe and leaving stunning organization and awe-inspiring filing in their wake and who make supply runs that keep the other land-bound Librarian hordes well-stocked and ready to pillage and classify at a moment's notice.  Panizzi's Captain, Virginia- a wise and mysterious leader with a past.  Lady Pendergrass- her mentor, may become important later.  Mr. Poom- Captain Virginia's right-hand man with the muttonchops and the snappy wardrobe.  Misc. crew and staff of the Panizzi   The Author- yours truly (behind the curtain)

      Captain's Log: HMS Juvenile Delinquent (at sail again)  Note to self: the cats' typing skills are appalling.  Something must be done about this.  Possibly I should switch from Qwerty to Dvorak?  Monkey seems to show no interest in the keyboard at all, but just chases the letters across the screen with his nose.  It is perhaps too much of a conceptual leap for them to understand that the letters on the screen are a result of the typing on the keyboard.  They were raised aboard ship and only recently have we converted from our letterpress to the digital age.  The cats were all very adept lead typesetters, so they can learn new skills.  I must admit it took myself some time to become used to these magical "word processors."  Some of the crew are still suspicious of them and build altars on top of the monitors and make offerings to prevent blue screens.  Interestingly, this seems to work just as well as studying computer manuals for keeping the machines up and running in all the salt air and the cold.

      We have set sail.  The Panizzi takes the lead and the HMS Juvenile Delinquent (free at last) is a sea going vessel once again.  Our cheers as we got underway caused the glaciers to calve.  The cacophany produced by the penguins was resounding.  I wept, I have no fear of confessing.  For I thought that I had failed my beloved Majesty and would not be able to carry out her mission, that I had failed my crew and would lose them all and my ship to madness and cold.  And now, accompanied by fine new friends, we are Tasmania bound. I have reassigned my enemies to squid vigil.  This must be kept secret from Delwin (and therefore from Arthur and Charles) because I am afraid he will be offended.  But I cannot take chances.  We cannot escape from sudden freezing insane death only to be swallowed by calimari as soon as we reach the open seas.

      Captain Virginia's tale last night was such a hit, tonight the crew begged for another campfire story.  Arthur volunteered.  Here is the story that Arthur told us our last night in Antarctica:    The Story Arthur Told Our Last Night in Antarctica    Once upon a time there was a little boy named Johnny.  Johnny was a nice little boy who lived down by the river with his mom.  Johnny liked ice cream and Johnny liked his pet fish and Johnny liked to  urlLink wrestle alligators .  There were lots of alligators in the river, so Johnny wrestled alligators every day except Sunday.  He didn't wrestle any alligators on Sunday because the preacher told him Jesus didn't want him wrestling alligators on the day of rest.  Johnny never quite agreed with this policy, but being underage and a good boy who loved his mother, he went along with it.  He did, however, usually try to wrestle twice as many alligators on Monday to make up for the lapse. One year, Johnny turned nine.  On the day before his ninth birthday, his mother asked him what he wanted for a gift.  Johnny said, "Mom, I want an alligator wrestling suit."  So that's what his mom got for him.  She had to drive all the way to New Mexico to get it, because that's where the factory was that made it.  It was okay, though, because she had a super-fast car that could get to New Mexico in fifteen minutes.  Actually the car was more than just super-fast, the car could fly.  It had been a gift to Johnny's mom from Johnny's dad before Johnny was born.  Johnny's dad was an inventor and the  urlLink flying super-fast car  was one of his inventions.  So Johnny's mom got him a shiny aluminum alligator wrestling suit and that's what Johnny got for his ninth birthday and he ran right out with it the minute he got it and wrestled seven alligators all at once. "Wow," said Johnny.  "This alligator wrestling suit is great," he yelled.  "I can wrestle seven alligators all at once.  I could never do that before.  Thanks, Mom!"  And he hugged his Mom and then wrestled alligators all the way to bedtime. The next day the Devil came to Johnny's house and challenged him to an alligator wrestling competition, because the Devil wanted to win Johnny's aluminum alligator wrestling suit.  Johnny said okay, let's go, because he was a good boy so he wasn't afraid of the Devil.  The whole town came to watch and to cheer for Johnny because nobody liked the Devil. The Devil wrestled six alligators.  Johnny wrestled six alligators.  The Devil wrestled seven alligators with one arm tied behind his back.  Johnny wrestled seven alligators with one arm tied behind his back and with both his ears plugged.  Johnny was going to win this competition.  So the Devil cheated and paid some alligators to pretend to wrestle him but then to lose big time.  He paid ten alligators to do this.  And there was no way Johnny, even with his aluminum alligator suit could do this, could wrestle ten alligators, so everyone thought, oh no, now the Devil is going to win.  So the whole town, that just loved Johnny to tears, took up a collection and Johnny's mom hopped in the super-fast flying car and flew to New Mexico with the collection and bought some upgrades from the factory for Johnny's alligator wrestling suit, including an alligator mind-control button and she flew back and all this time Johnny had been holding off the ten alligators, but he hadn't beat them yet and then his mom came back and said, "Johnny, I bought you some upgrades," but Johnny was the bravest alligator-wrestling-est boy that ever lived and he wanted to beat that Devil so bad and he wanted to show that Devil that he could do it without upgrades.  So he got good and mad and then he whupped one two three four five six seven eight nine alligators just like that.  And then he whupped the last alligator with his eyes closed.  And then he yelled at some other alligators and called them some names and they came over and there were six of them so he whupped them and in the space of six or seven minutes he whupped twelve more alligators after that and he was just like this mad little alligator whupping machine boy and Johnny won the contest fair and square, no upgrades, even though the Devil cheated.  So the Devil, as a prize, gave Johnny one big wish and one little wish. So Johnny wished for world peace and a turtle and everybody everywhere lived happily ever after.  The End.

        The Story of Captain Virginia    I was born in a salty climate.  I grew up in a lighthouse.  We never closed the windows.  The mineral deposits made it very difficult to keep any cars running, so we left them alongside the roads and rode bicycles.  My parents were hardworking people, and good, but our house was infested with poltergeists.  Every night they would throw tea trays at us while we tried to sleep.  We took to taking naps in public places.  I developed the skill of sleeping while standing up in elevators.   Sometimes the poltergeists would follow me to school.  A few times they followed other children home.  I wasn't very popular and became bookish.  I spent recesses in the school library, sorting the checkout cards.  This was, I suppose the beginning of my destiny although I didn't know it then. There were eight of us children and my father was always telling us that one day if we were naughty one night the gypsies would come for us.  We were always naughty, so we kept our bags packed under our beds.  We weren't surprised when the gypsies came through the window that September night.  We were awake because of all the flying tea trays and most of us were ready to leave.  My youngest brother Earnest didn't mind the poltergeists much and begged to be left behind, so he was.  He still runs that lighthouse.  I correspond with him often.  My parents died some time ago.  It is hard to keep track of my six other brothers and sisters, some went north and some went south and some went east and some went west.  We run into each other now and again in exotic locations and greet each other warmly.  We all have such interesting lives.   The gypsies taught me how to read the  urlLink tarot  and then apprenticed me to a troupe of rodeo clowns.  I endured the mettle-testing initiation rituals (and still bear the scars upon my back) and learned quickly how to balance on a barrel, but after two years it was concluded that I lacked the constitution for the work.  I am of a contemplative nature and the bovines saw in me, in this, a kindred spirit and refused to be aggressive with me.  To this day I possess the ability to lull cows with my thoughts.  The rodeo clowns sent me off to make my own way in the world with their blessings and a pair of silver engraved spurs that I wear on ceremonial occasions. I worked as a bartender, and as a train steward.  I was a shopgirl for a time until I slapped a woman.  I dug for fossils in the desert and searched for Bigfoot in the norhtwest rainforests for a summer.  I was a park ranger and a museum guard.  That ended when a handsome thief convinced me to help him steal some art and then left me in the lurch.  While I was in prison I studied criminology and graphology and anthropology and mythology.  When I was released, having gained several college degrees, I went back to visit my brother Earnest.  I stayed at the lighthouse for most of an autumn.  One dark night on the eve of winter, a ship passed the rocks below the lighthouse in deep peril, my brother and I thought for certain it would run aground and be smashed and the poor crew drowned or thrown into the rocks and killed.  But the ship's pilot was both a madman and a genius and he had set a course and stuck to it and miraculously the ship made it around the headland safely and tied up in the nearby harbor.   That ship was the Panizzi.  The next morning I left early, Earnest understood and shook my hand warmly and affectionately.  The poltergeists flung candlesticks at my head, but I ducked most of them.  The door jamb took a nasty knock, however.  I collected all of my meagre belongings and walked down to the harbor.  I inquired at the tavern about the ship and a small bookish voice in the back of the room called me over.   I found her sitting at a little table in the corner, just finishing the New York Times Saturday crossword in ink.  She folded the paper primly and looked up at me evaluatingly.  Her name was Lady Pendergrass and she was the Head Librarian of the Panizzi at the time.  I was barely nineteen and, even with as many thrilling tales already under my belt as I had then, and all my academic commendations, I was trembling with nervousness in front of her tiny pink-cardigan clad frame.  Her one pirate extravagance was a necklace of shark teeth, which clattered against the delicate pearl buttons of her lacy white blouse when she rose to shake my hand.  She gazed up at me through her impenetrable bifocals.   "Yes, yes," she said.  "I'm never wrong about these things.  And I think you'll do nicely.  Have a toddy with me here, dear, and then we'll go up to my ship and see that Mr. Poom gets you a cabin and some textbooks and some rope for practicing knots." Lady Pendergrass retired to her country estate several years ago and I must have learned quickly because she left me in charge of the Panizzi when she went.  You'll have to ask my crew whether I have done the title of Head Pirate Librarian of the greatest Pirate Librarian ship in the Great and Terrible Pirate Librarian fleet proud.  And at this all the Librarians gave a three great cheers for Captain Virginia and a cheer for Lady Pendergrass.    Arthur had fallen fast asleep.

      In two days we will be leaving.  I spent some time last night, gazing up at the three quarters moon through a freezing fog.  It was beautiful, crystaline and misty.  I know that one day I will have to return to Antarctica, my map is incomplete.  I also want to see what becomes of the Great Antarctic Library.  But I wish to circumnavigate a few more times before I come back to this desolate continent. Savage with glee over the impending departure, the rest of the crew were running about the ice howling at the moon like a bunch of  urlLink spongmonkeys , most undignified and I was embarrassed in front of the noble rowdiness of the Librarians, who were engaged in more civilized pursuits, like cards and dice and re-enacting their favorite professional wrestling matches.  It was Arthur who suggested it.  He was so adorable, wrapped up for bed in his footie pajamas with the roller skating elephants on them and the gorilla mask that he likes to sleep in and dragging around that blankie of his.  Arthur is so cute sometimes I just want to zap him with a shrink ray and put him in my pocket.  Anyway, sensing my distress at the spongmonkey-ish mooning about behavior of my crew (who were no longer Ice Mad, but you might be hard put to tell the difference), Arthur asked loudly above the din, "Captain Virginia, if it's not too personal to inquire, how did you become a Pirate Librarian?  I was wondering if you might thrill us with your life story this night." Of course everyone, even the Librarians, settled right down.  Captain Virginia is a great leader and an imposing commandress, but she is not urlLink  loquacious  by nature and so most of her crew did not know anything of her life story. "Well," she said...

      I asked Captain Virginia last night where she got her Most Impressive Coat.  As it turns out, she purchased it in  urlLink Salamanca Market  in Hobart, on the fierce island of Van Dieman's land (referred to in polite company nowadays as Tasmania), our next destination.  The worksmanship on the garment is astoundingly excellent, I asked her how she found such a fine piece.  "A werewolf introduced me to his tailor," she replied.  I have believed myself to live an adventurous life from my birth in a cruise ship lifeboat in an eye of a hurricane in the Bermuda triangle right up until 7pm this evening, but goodness, these Librarians and their nonchalant tones when speaking of things like werewolves in Tasmania and their other  urlLink action-packed  escapades-- it makes me positively itch to get out of this ice floe and back out into the world, having more excitement.   Some may be wondering what happened to my beloved Arthur, Patient Zero in the Ice Madness epidemic.  Have no fear.  The  urlLink collected works of Jane Austen  was prescribed by the Readers Advisors and soon enough he was right as rain.  He has forged a most peculiar friendship with one of the penguins, a yellow-eyed chap by the name of Delwin.  Or at least that is the human nom de guerre he has chosen for himself.  Delwin, the greatest  urlLink Charlie Chaplin impersonator  I have ever come across (and I have in the past judged competitions at the state level), wishes to become somewhat of an anthropologist for the penguins, living amongst us and performing participant observation for the next six months, until we can drop him off at his family's winter migratory gathering.  After so much hospitality from the penguins it was impossible of me to refuse, so Arthur has taken it upon himself to be Delwin's chief informant, guide and particular mentor.  He is right now taking intensive penguin-language lessons from Charles.   My enemies you may be wondering about as well.  My fears of the collossal squid seemed to offend the penguins, who assured us over and over that it was no threat.  I could not very well keep my enemies on squid vigil and maintain diplomatic ties with the penguins, so, trusting whatever defense systems the penguins relied on with such absolute confidence, I reassigned my enemies to guard duty, watching after our precious cargo of Etruscan grave markers, Joseph Cornell tribute boxes and jars of botannical specimens.  Since the HMS JD has been reassembled and the cargo safely stored aboard, my enemies have had some time to finally enjoy some rest and relaxation.  They are learning the sacred art of subject heading syntax and the  urlLink Ranganathan  classification system (esoteric but fascinating) from the Cataloger Librarians.  They are also consuming vast quantities of  urlLink butterscotch pudding  (created from a 500 lb. supply of instant mix which the Pirates picked up on accident in a raid off the Cape of Good Hope.)  What strange enemies I have.   Tomorrow we have a grand reception in honor of the opening of the Great Antarctic Library.  I must go polish my buttons.  I must do it by hand now,  urlLink my button polisher  was lost overboard off the coast of Sri Lanka in a complicated practical joke.  At times like these, consumed with my bitter inner envy of Captain Virginia's Most Impressive Coat, I miss it terribly.

      Captain's Log, HMS Juvenile Delinquent (revenant)  The Librarians have managed to fulfill even the most outlandish faith we have put in them.  Most of the crew are recouperating nicely from their bouts with the Ice Madness, the story times calmed them and now the reading material supplied by the bookmobile has provided the much needed distraction from the acres of ice.  I think also the knowledge that we shall soon be making a break for it (literally) and getting out of this frozen trap has helped revive everyone's spirits. The Librarians have managed to rebuild the Juvenile Delinquent!  Apparently their skills of organization and their excellent mastery of maritime structures allowed them in less than 24 hours to undo all the damage done by the ravenous crew.  They decoded the lists and identified all the pieces and now my beautiful South Polar Exploratory Vessel is revived and better than ever!  I am so pleased. Captain Virginia and Mr. Poom are most excellent new companions, so knowledgeable and urbane, but with many bloodthirsty tales of their voyages on the high seas.  All of the librarians are most agreeable company and the evenings while we prepare to extricate our ships from the ice and make our way back out to the open seas are now quite festive with both crews and all the penguins providing most boisterous social activity.   The Pirate Librarians are all tattooed and festooned with spoils that declaim their many voyages.  Some have obscure passages from ancient texts tattooed along their arms, others wear layers of batiks from Bali and silks from Singapore and tapestries from Tierra del Fuego, they are flamboyant in dress, but often shy in manner.  The penguins have proved excellent ice breakers (in the figurative sense) and go-betweens.  Guessing at their pantomimes draws the humans together and the penguins continue to provide quality dance and slapstick entertainment around the campfires.   We did not leave immediately because Captain Virginia's mission was not just to rescue our crew.  In fact, her wonderful asssistance to us was just a side activity.  She and her Librarians are determined to establish a working library in the magnificent structure constructed by the penguins, where any travelers that come from other lands can leave their own tales and rejoice in tales from those that have arrived before them.  They want to stock the library well with all the classics so that future season-trapped crews will not have to face the Ice Madness, and they also need to train the penguins in the ancient art of Library Science so that they may staff the library year round.  I believe some negotiations are going on as to which of the Pirate Librarians will stay behind to get the Great Antarctic Library up and running.  I believe it is a very prestigious and much sought after position, as I have seen many of Captain Virginia's crew engaged in serious discussion with her, attempting to curry favor.

      The Diary of Charles, Ship's Linguist, the HMS Juvenile Delinquent (some assembly required)  How shall I describe the meeting of two such great Captains?  I wish that you  urlLink spoke whale , my dear reader, because the Gray Whales have a lovely saying in their tongue that encompasses all the emotion of two great ones who have never met but have heard of each other through the ocean currents and across space and time encountering one another far from home and on equal terms.  I wish I could render it for you phonetically, but since the  urlLink International Phonetic Alphabet  was created only for human utterances, I am afraid this is impossible.  So sad, because even though I am a linguist, words fail me.  The Panizzi, after a full night of grinding through the ice, arrived early in the day, the sunlight glinting off the spectacles on the librarians' faces like disco lights off the facets of a mirror ball.  The great ship ground to a halt a safe distance from the Great Antarctic Library and the Penguin King and my captain advanced to meet it, arms outstretched in a sign of friendship.  A rope ladder was hurled over the side of the Panizzi and Captain Virginia Dodgson, in her Most Impressive Coat descended, followed by her second in command, Mr. Poom, possessor of a small head and very large mutton chop sideburns.  Captain Virginia had long black hair and heavy black-rimmed glasses and sensible shoes.  Mr. Poom wore a costume of psychadelic tweeds, crowned with a pimpin' hat with a large feather.  These are, after all, dear Reader, Pirate Librarians.  The rest of the crew awaited along the railings of the boat, ready to throw down more rope ladders and begin their work in the Great Antarctic Library.  I had offered my services as translator, but the King Penguin had waved me off, preferring to rely on his outstanding and graceful pantomime skills.  So I waited at the entrance of the Great Antarctic Library with the little stowaways and Dr. Bippie, not able to hear what words of brilliance were exchanged between the two seafaring leaders.  The greetings all seemed most amicable, however, and after only 10 minutes of discussion, Virginia gave the signal and the Librarians cascaded down onto the ice, rushing into the Great Antarctic Library through every entrance.  My beautiful captain and Captain Virginia, Mr. Poom and King Penguin followed at a dignified pace until they came even with us.  My captain suppled the introductions all around and then I realized that Mr. Poom was toting, like a faithful  urlLink St. Bernard , a small keg of hot chocolate, which he shared around with all of us.   "They'll make short work of it, they're professionals," Virginia was saying, I noticed an interesting tattoo up the side of her neck, it was the same image as the bow spirit of her magnificent ship, "But it will be at least a few hours.  May as well make ourselves comfortable.  Is there somewhere inside where we can keep an eye on things?" "Of course," replied our Captain, and we showed them to the mezzanine. The Pirate Librarians seemed to be working in distinct units on different tasks.  One corps was working on the scrapings on the walls, another unit was gathering the scraps of the HMS JD (jetsam), the more flamboyantly dressed members of a small group were gathering the Ice Mad crew for a story time and a purple-clad bunch that Poom seemed to be calling the Readers' Advisors were gathered together off to one side observing our crew and rooting through a large cart or "bookmobile" that they had dragged inside on a sledge.  The Catalogers seemed quite an elite and exclusive squad- notable for the red, blue and green books they toted around.  Their work was elusive, but we could sense their power behind the scenes.  The Reference Section was Library use only and had therefore remained aboard the Panizzi, but Captain Virginia was in constant contact with them via a constantly running fleet of messenger penguins.  They supplied answers to her questions about the weather and anything else that seemed to arise.  The Story Time seemed to instantly calm the crew, who even began to sing along after the third or fourth tale.  "We hope they're well enough to engage in Arts and Crafts later," said Virginia.   Late in the day a cry went up from one of the Catalogers, "I say, I believe it's  pre -coordinated!" at which point Mr. Poom and Virginia both exclaimed, "A-ha!" and began furiously issuing orders to the Catalogers and a team of "shelvers" which had been waiting aboard the Panizzi was dispatched.  "Won't be long now," said Mr. Poom.  "See that it won't be."  We left at supper time, but it was clear that the Pirate Librarians intended to work throughout the night.  I still do not fully understand everything that they did, but what the wrought by the following morning was nothing short of miraculous and I shall sing their praises until I die.

      "Mr Poom!  Tell the  urlLink Reference Section  that I want information on  urlLink penguins ,  urlLink Antarctica ,  urlLink stowaways , and  urlLink Joseph Cornell ," shouted Virginia Dodgson, the Captain of the Panizzi.   "Already done, o Captain, my Captain," replied Mr. Poom with  urlLink alacrity . "And please, Mr. Poom," said Virginia.  "Don't quote  urlLink Whitman  in front of the penguins." "Of course, Captain." "Now, Mr. Poom.  Prepare my Most Impressive Coat.  We are about to storm the library."

      We have been watching the approach of the Panizzi all day through the spyglasses.  It is not  urlLink a traditional ice breaking ship .  I have a theory that this is due to the Panizzi being usually a sailing vessel in the tropical southern Pacific, I shall have to ask when they arrive, but I believe the ice breaking aparatus is removable and can be broken down and stored in crates in the hull, which then act as ballast when the ship is navigating open seas.  The ice breaker attaches to the front of the ship, powered by some engine stored on deck and consists of two long jaws that run along either side of the bow to about midway back to the beam.  Each jaw is made up of a thousand and one gears that rotate in different directions, moving hammers and blades that chew up the ice and force it back and upwards in two giant sprays on either side of the ship, creating a wide channel.  The machinery appears to be steam driven, although what they use for fuel, I cannot imagine, as there is no central chimney stack as one would expect if they were burning wood or coal.  The other aspect of the ice breaker, that allows the ship to move forward quite rapidly, are the cables.  The ship is not propelled through the ice from the rear, but rather dragged forward on cables that are launched ahead of the ship, each cable with a sharp, clawlike end that pierces the ice at some speed and then digs in hard, allowing the ship to be pulled forward using winches attached up on deck, which are cranked by members of the crew who switch off in shifts.  When the ship is pulled even with one set of cables, another set is launched and the first set is freed from the ice using a sort of detonator and a small amount of explosive in each one which is triggered, I believe, by a sharp upward tug on the cable or some kind of twisting motion.  This breaks the ice even further.  Then the first set of cables is hauled in and reloaded and the ship is winched along to the second set and on and on and so forth.  It is, as one would presume by reading this, a very noisy system and the booms and cracks and grinding rumbles roll back and forth across the baren landscape like loose shot on a drumhead, clattering around off of drifts and ice walls and rattling into each other and into the walls and towers and gates of the Library.  Strangely, none of the Ice Mad crew seems to have noticed the noises at all.  The Little Girls, however, have had to stuff their ears with cotton as the Panizzi has gotten closer and the noise has grown deafening.   The Panizzi, behind the ice breaker, is a magnificent ship, three masts, with room for a crew of probably 80, judging by the number of lifeboats stored alongside.  It is made from a wood that glows red in the antarctic sunlight.  The crew work willingly but solemnly, changing off with precision and moving about the deck with feline surefootedness.  There is stained glass in some of the cabin windows and a bowspirit carved in the shape of a beautiful woman with bird wings of many florid colors, holding a ponderous black book to her chest, over a white gown with folds and gathers carved so realistically it seems to flutter in the icy wind as the ship pulls forward. Initially the great ship's progress through the ice seemed staggering compared to our own locked position over the past months, but now that the great Librarian ship is close enough for me to observe the movements of the crew with my naked eyes, but still not quite close enough for us to approach on foot, it seems to be taking forever.  My anticipation makes it seem so, I'm sure.  I pace about the mezzanine and rehearse various greetings  and  urlLink forms of address .  What honorific does one use for a Pirate Librarian if one is a captain of a recently trapped and dismembered South Polar Exploratory Ship in Her Majesty's Royal South Polar fleet?  I'm attempting a sort of shabby dignity.  We need their help, but not their pity.

      From the desk of Lady Pendergrass, Librarian Extraordinaire (Retired)  Things to do today: 1) Inform gardener that something must be done with the topiaries.  Bunny rabbits are not acceptable. 2) Tell the maid to polish the silver. 3) Tell the maid to polish the silver  properly . 4) Read a book and write down my thoughts about it. 5) Hone lethal mind control abilities. 6) Feed the ninjas. 7) Find out what Captain Virginia is up to. 8) Call Francis. 9) Create new computer virus. 10) Invite all my famous and royal friends to come over and watch the Oscars on the satellite. 11) When they show up, pretend I have no idea what they're talking about and threaten to turn the dogs on them.  This will be a funny joke.  Perhaps fire shotgun for versimillitude?   12) Have everyone in for drinky-poos.  Record all conversations with secret bugging equipment. 13) Breathe out the negative energy.  Breathe in the positive energy.   14) Make new things to do list for tomorrow. 15) Don't sweat the small stuff.  Remember, it's  all  small stuff. 16) Send assassins after Smike. 17) Say prayers. 18) Brush teeth  and  floss. 19) Tuck self in. 20) Turn on hypno- suggestion tape: "How to improve your global domination skills in six easy steps."

      In the loveliest of handwritings...  Damn.  Damn, bugger and damn again.  Six months hiding under chairs, barking about on the ice of Antarctica, now stuck in a row boat on the open seas off the south coast of Australia with Jack and Dab, two of the nerdiest librarians I'll ever admit to meeting.  I have been subjected to nonstop questioning about my personal informed opinion about the authenticity of Sean Connery's James Bond v. Roger Moore.  I find it interesting that all short men tend to prefer Moore.  Now they fortunately have begun arguing between themselves about Halle Berry in a swimsuit and left me finally to try to arrange my own thoughts.  But if they don't stop bickering I'll probably have to brain somebody.  I won't be proud of it.  I have a license to kill, but this is just silly. Everything seems to have blown up in my face and I have no idea whom to trust any longer.  One thing is for very certain, Arthur and Lady Pendergrass are both more and less than what they seem. More later.  Jack and Dab are poking each other in the eye and the roughhousing may capsize the boat. S. Mike, esq.

      Lady Pendergrass either didn't suspect a thing or was even more of an actress than Captain Virginia.  "Oh, Virginia darling, I'm retired.  I'm not up to much now, you know.  Just my knitting and my hen breeding and I putter occasionally." "Lady Pendergrass, how sedate you've become!" "Well, dear.  I will confess, I did get up to a bit of plunder over the holidays.  Went down to the equatorial jungles and killed my own wild pig for Christmas dinner.  With a spear, darling.  Oh it was scrumptious.  I wish you could have been here.  Francis missed you, I think." "Francis was there?" "Why, yes, darling.  He always makes it home for Christmas.  You, though, as I understand, were pootling about the South Pole.  Anything of interest down there besides those awful thuggish penguins?" "Oh, not much of interest at all, really.  Nothing up to your standards of excitement, anyway." "Oh, don't beat yourself up.  You're young yet, you can't expect to have that crew dodging cannon fire for you the way they did for me yet.  You'll find your feet soon enough." Mr. Poom was gesturing wildly at Captain Virginia to get off the phone.  All of us knew, could sense Lady Pendergrass's acute intuitive powers, seeking out a psychic connection with Viriginia over the wireless connection.  At any moment we knew she must discover that we knew about Smike, but that we didn't know nearly enough.  But Virginia persisted. "Well, Lady Pendergrass, I would like a bit of adventure, though.  A bit of romance."  Poom seemed about ready to tear his own hair out at the mischevious stubbornness with which Virginia ignored his silent implorations to sever the line of communication.  "Whatever happened to that tall dark heir to something or other you introduced me to at the Espionage Ball we attended last year?  That one with the lovely handwriting?" "Simon-Michael?  Why I thought you didn't take to him at all.  I'm surprised indeed that you still remember him....  I have no idea where he is." "I was only teasing Lady Pendergrass." What was Virginia up to?  Poom could hardly contain himself.  He went over to the door and although he was on the inside, he knocked loudly on it. "Yes, Poom?" said Virginia. Poom made a noisy show of opening the door and making footstep noises coming closer to the phone.  "So incredibly sorry to interrupt, but, ma'am, Captain's presence requested on deck," he said in a horrible stagey tone directly into the phone mouthpiece. "Yes, thank you, Poom," said Virginia, pulling the mouthpiece away lest Lady Pendergrass be able to smell what Poom had for lunch over the wireless.  "I'm sorry, Lady Pendergrass, but I must go." "Of course, you must dear.  Take good care of my ship.  Tell them all hello hello for me." "Right-o." "Ta." The connection was broken.  It would be a few hours before we would know whether any of the A/V club librarians could get additional information off of the recording we had made- such as was Lady Pendergrass talking from her country estate or a hollowed out volcano somewhere?  But Captain Virginia's Cheshire cat smile told us all that she, at least, had gotten exactly the information she wanted out of the conversation.

      We discovered the main communications control panel in Smike's secret inner ship, where he had been contacting his secret puppetmaster.  Charles and Poom and I gathered around while Captain Virginia pushed the redial button.  (Arthur, being exciteable, was told to wait outside.)  The signal must have been traveling around the globe because it took some time for the call recipient to answer, and it sounded like another day there.   A ponderous British gentleman answered, "Hello." A sea change occured in Captain Virginia's visage.  "May I speak to the lady of the house, please?" "One moment." Ponderous British footsteps moved off down ponderous British hallways filled with ancestral portraits and fine curios of Empire.  In the next moment another voice, crisp, sweet, like a fine lace handkerchief, a voice clothed in pink wool and shark teeth.  "Why Virginia, what a sweet surprise, to what do I owe the honor?" Virginia exchanged glances with us all. "Oh, nothing in particular, Lady Pendergrass.  I was just out here in the southern oceans, wondering what had become of you recently."  Captain Virginia was a sphinx, an enigma, a cipher.  Mr. Poom's eyes were as wide as saucers.

      Turns out I needn't have worried about how to broach the subject with Captain Virginia.  Gossip between the two ships spreads like a brushfire and Mr. Poom has his ear to the rumor mill and reports directly to Virginia.  She approached me with information that I found, while not shocking, certainly disheartening.  She was, for obvious reasons, quite shattered. Two of the crew of the Panizzi have made off with one of the lifeboats and enough supplies (as estimated by Poom) to get them to Africa.  I have no doubt that Smike is with them, thwarted in whatever evil deed he intended to perpetrate using my beautiful jigsaw ship.  Virginia and Poom and Arthur and I are all agreed that we must get to the bottom of the mystery of what they were plotting, as I am sure we have not seen the last of them.

      Captain's Log: Directly upon our rescue by Arthur, my enemies and I (who had been wandering in the secret passages, pursued by Smike for probably 24 hours) alerted the crew to the presence of a saboteur.  I am convinced Smike is in cahoots with one of the librarians.  The Little Stowaways informed me that Smike made some feeble attempt to convince them during the Ice Madness that he doesn't like librarians, but I believe this is just so much smoke and mirrors.  There is no way Smike could have constructed the operation that my enemies and I witnessed scrambling through that dark labyrinth alone just in the time since we have left Antarctica.  One of the catalogers must have aided him during the reconstruction of the HMS Juvenile Delinquent in dry dock.   The question now becomes, while my crew busily tear their ship apart again in the hopes of flushing Smike out of hiding, how do I bring this up to Captain Virginia without insulting her?

      Diary of Arthur  Oh what to do what to do?  All my fault all my fault.  Captain missing.  Enemies gone.  Ghost ship ghost ship.  Everyone was at Delwin's party, lovely cake, lovely biscuits, lovely ribbons, lovely irons.  Stayed so late so late.  Captain stayed behind with the ship the ship.  Enemies were on squid vigil, I wasn't supposed to know, no wasn't supposed to know, but I knew.  It's alright.  Wouldn't tell Delwin.  Delwin's lovely, but I love the Captain more, I do.  Wouldn't have told.  But now they're gone, Captain's gone.  Afraid they may have taken the Captain.  No one else to have done it, right?  Who else would there be?  Who else? Oh worry worry worry.  Poor Arthur, he is worried so. And now that horrible knocking again.  Bloody poltergeists in the walls or something.  Wretched.  Wretched.  Can't finish my nap.  Two days with the Captain gone and no sleep for the worrying. What to do what to do?  Librarians out in little boats searching.  Adorable little boats.  Wish I could have one.  Charles taken command.  Dr. Bippie scries with a bowl of water.  No tasks for Arthur, though.  No tasks.  Wish I could nap.   Stop the bloody knocking you wicked poltergeist! Oh, here now, look what you've gone and made me do.  I've put my boot through the wall and...

      No water.  No food.  No sound.  Exhaustion. Where the bloody hell is Smike? Then, this morning, the angelic tapping:  "Begging pardons, is this the Captain?  We are thine enemies.  Our code is not exquisite.  Please to excuse.  Require ye assistance?"

      I am tiring.  I have been at this all night, although, since it is pitch dark in my little hole and I have lost all track of the space-time continuum down here I could have been tapping for a year or a nanosecond and would no longer have any idea of the difference.  I do seem to have sustained a repetetive stress injury in my wrist from it, however, which would indicate I've kept it up for at least twelve hours. I have been forced from the pain in my wrist to edit come of the conversational niceties from my distress signal.  I hope my crew is not put off by my brusqueness.   "Captain trapped.  Smike bad.  Help.  Now."

      I was once in a terrible dinner party conversation where someone misquoted the great American detective story writer Raymond Chandler as saying, "When the plot gets stuck, simply have a man enter the room with a gun."  I was reminded of this occasion this afternoon when I was pulled back to consciousness from my nap (having another ferocious nightmare about the squid-- this time it actually had one of its foul squeaky biting tentacles down my  throat  and was attempting to strangle me from the inside out), startled awake by none other than Smike, holding a musket to my sleepy head.  Most of the crew were attending a surprise birthday party for Delwin aboard the Panizzi.  Besides, it would be beneath my dignity to shout for help. "Smike," I informed him.  "This is unacceptable." "Oh Captain, my Captain, you are a princely one, aren't you?" I found his voice and accent to be quite as lovely as his handwriting, he sounded very much like one of the soothing reporters for the BBC worldservice who manage to sound so suave even with gunfire and rabid hippopotami stampeding in the background.  His sneer as he jerked me out of my bed by the shoulder was decidedly less attractive. "Smike, what do you intend?" "I intend to take you as my prisoner, my Captain." "What is this nonsense?" "You'll find out soon enough, my Captain," he sneered again, again that lovely voice.  "You see," his face was very close now, as he had to lean near to bind my wrists and apply the gag across my mouth, and I could see his tragic backstory lurking behind his icy blue eyes, "I have chosen my own adventure, Captain.  And in it, we never arrive in Tasmania.  Come on."  And with that he towed me out the door, down the passageway and suddenly through a secret trap I had no idea existed.  Smike's unsupervised rambles throughout the ship and insane hiding behavior, I now realized, should probably not have been allowed to continue unchecked and unsupervised.  I took them as eccentric high-spiritedness.  They unfortunately seem to have had a more sinister purpose.  Smike had worried out every crawlspace on board the ship and had actually discovered quite a lot of space between decks and behind walls that was not being used by the crew and had essentially, as I observed while we continued our journey, created an entire ship behind the ship, with his own set of supplies and navigational and communications equipment.  I was startled at his genius, but kept my cool, trying to memorize right and left turns so that I might make my escape at my first chance.   The turns soon befuddled me, as I'm sure Smike led me through the most circuitous route he could find, at last simply dropping me down a half a floor into a small shaft and then shutting me in with a heavy plank and leaving me there.   I have checked all the walls, all the corners, followed every plank.  I am well sealed in and have no idea even what part of the ship I am imprisoned in.  Smike left me without searching my pockets and I am at the moment using one of the strange coins, a particularly heavy and tarnished disc that was presented to me during my illness by my enemies, to tap in morse code along the walls. "Pardon me, this is your captain.  I seem to have been taken hostage.  Assistance would be appreciated at your earliest convenience.  Thanks ever so.  I'll be waiting here, then.  Ta." Over and over and over I tap.  I will keep this up all night and all day if I have to.  Smike does not know, apparently, who he has tangled with.  I was morse code champion of my youth group seven years in a row and even won a special medal from the Emperor for it.  And Arthur and Charles are both almost as adept.  I have complete faith that I will be rescued at any moment.

      Diary of Arthur... Went shopping today with Dr. Bippie, Charles and Delwin.  It was the first time Delwin had ever seen a  urlLink traffic cone .  He couldn't stop laughing.  Charles wanted him to explain the joke but he couldn't stop laughing long enough to talk.  He's still laughing.  We are sitting in a tavern waiting for our soup.  We have lots of new coats and fish to take back to the ship.  My new coat is wool and made of blue.

      Peter lived in a small flat, near the market, and it was there that he and Captain Virginia and myself retired for morning tea following my and Peter's consultation with the tailor.  As we began the walk up to his fourth floor penthouse in the antique building, Peter informed us that his landlord had fits if he witnessed his tenants engaged in vices of any sort, so Peter asked us, " urlLink Kindly, kindly, kindly, do not smoke in the hall or staircase ."

      Diary of Charles, Ship's Linguist, HMS Juvenile Delinquent (Snug as a bug in a rug)  Overheard in the galley-  Ship's Cook (shouting at ship's cat Monkey): "Why do you run when I get the pot Monkey?  You afraid I'm going to boil you?" (gesturing menacingly at Monkey with a large black pot retrieved from a cupboard)  "Don't fear the pot Monkey.  It's only a pot.  See?  See, Monkey?  Pot.  Pot pot pot.  Pot, Monkey, pot.  Pot pot Monkey pot pot pot.  Pot!  POT!" (rhythmic banging of pot against chopping block).   Monkey looks askance, then walks away, shaking one hind paw dancerly behind him as he steps away, as if shaking the devil politely off his heel.  This is superb.  The levels, the dialectics!  A linguistic goldmine.  I shall seclude myself this afternoon and analyze.  It feels wonderful to breathe harbor air and to get back to my academic roots.  My work with Delwin on a penguin lexicon for publication is rewarding, but like any professional working for a prolonged time on some esoteric area of their expertise, it is refreshing and mind cleansing to get back to the basics.  I wonder what Arhtur has been up to, scampering around the hallways in the Captain's absence?

      We arrived in Hobart, Tasmania on the evening of the full moon, so we had much light to dock, even though we had arrived late in the evening.  We tied up in the harbor along the Panizzi and although we had not much time to venture into town, many crew members had enough time to buy fresh seafood from the vendors along the docks.   We slept well, in spite of all the howling.  I attributed it to the comfort of a harbor.  Early this morning, Captain Virginia accompanied me to her tailor in Salamanca Market to commission a Very Impressive Coat of my own.  Not surprisingly, considering it was a Sunday morning following a full moon, we met Captain Virginia's werewolf associate there. "Why Peter, hello," said Captain Virginia, obviously quite pleased at the coincidence. "Darling, Virginia, my favorite bloodthirsty bookworm," and they exchanged air kisses.  Virginia introduced me and I shook Peter's large strong hand. "Pleasure to meet you," he growled in a very distinguished accent that I couldn't quite place.  It was largely local, but had tints of the merry olde mother country.  "Peter Canis." "The pleasure is mine, I'm sure," I replied, charmed in spite of his hairy palm. "Peter," tsked Virginia, noticing the tattered formal wear suspended from hangers over his shoulder.  "That looks like some of your finest opera kit.  Is that from last night?  You know better than that.  What were you thinking?" Peter gazed down ruefully at the frayed shoulders of an Armani tuxedo.  "I was thinking of the Utter Dish who invited me to a touring performance of the Siberian Ballet.  I overestimated my self control and completely misjudged moon rise I'm afraid.  Fortunately the Dish came accessorized with a large sterling silver crucifix and had had garlic for dinner.  The weather was a bit off so there wasn't much in the way of innocents wandering the countryside, thank heavens.  The Dish got me home and locked in the basement with a raw sheep corpse.  No harm done except to my Armani and to my spine from sleeping in a hollow in the floor.  Trevor here is a magician with a torn out satin lining, however, so I've no fear.  Next stop is the chiropractor and then the florist to send apology roses to the Dish.  But there's no hurry.  After you and your luscious friend are done with your tailoring business, would you care to join me for tea and bikkies?" We of course accepted.

      Dearest Mum, I hope this message in a bottle finds you well and safe in our cozy island bungalow.  I also hope you've been wearing your galoshes when you go out, as I remember from my childhood, this is a damp and froggish time of year on our tiny Isle of Arthur.  You must keep your tootsies toasty, Mother, otherwise there'll be no dancing in the moonlight at Midsummer Eve.   I don't have to worry about the cold so much as the damp here, adrift on the Indian Ocean.  Dab's here, not to worry.  You told me to look out for my brother and I'm doing a right cracking job of it, even if he is a blistering dunderhead and capitally annoying most days.  You may be getting some communication informing you that Dab and I have become TRAITOROUS MURDERING HORRID NE'ER DO WELLS but I'd like to assure you that this is simply a clerical error and that you shouldn't worry at all.  I'm sure it will all be righted as soon as we can row to South Africa or Indonesia, depending on the weather.   We're out here with a bit of an odd duck name of Smike.  A bit neurotic and bites his nails a lot, but he's got the Queen's interests at heart, truly.  For here is the most exciting thing, Mum, he's really truly a Spy!  Of the cloak and dagger variety.  Secret societies and the whole bag.  He's absolutely spiffing at navigation and leadership and all those classes that neither Dab nor I did well in in Librarian Pirate school so I've no worries.  Hopefully my next bottle will be coming from somewhere a bit more north and then the next one after that shall hopefully come from dry land itself. Dab says hola (he likes to show of his Esperanto, big fat faker) and sends a son's dear love.  As do I.  We're both in robust health, and absolutely not TRAITOROUS NE'ER DO WELLS at all.  We miss you and the Isles, but expect to be seeing you for Midsummer Eve at the latest.   Your eldest (by 3 minutes) and most handsome (by leagues), Jack PS: If you get this, and can find a way, send Dab and I some cribbage pegs by the most convenient carrier pigeon, we have a lovely plank to make a board.  We try to use buttons but they slide about and I'm fairly certain Dab cheats. PPS: here's Dab his own self--  Dear Mum, How's life?  Keeping busy are you?  Not too much flirting, I hope.  I've just got a wee tetch of the  urlLink scurvy , but as Jack (your insufferably pretensious elder son) wrote, most things are going fine.  This character Smike we're with is an absolute dodger, but he'll get us to Papua New Guinea come hell or high water, so no worries.  Also, with the cribbage pegs, can you send a whistle and a pen? Your loving and charismatic son, Dab

       Meanwhile, in another story happening elsewhere involving different characters entirely...   For the nth time that day, Government Documents Librarian II Whatsername Sprank (real first name Magda) checked the area to make sure she was alone, opened the tiny window of the media player on the desk computer and stole company time like a wicked bandit by watching the news clip again. The Japanese scientist pushed the adorable little  urlLink robot .  The little robot fell down.  "I feel very bad about this," the Japanese scientist said, in Japanese.  Sprank did not really speak Japanese, but she could lip read it perfectly after years and years of watching Godzilla movies dubbed into English.  The adorable little robot struggled for a moment and then got adorably back up, with approximately as much heart-liquifyingly adorable lack of grace as a curly-haired human toddler or perhaps a big-eyed monkey baby.  It said something in a metallically adorable robot voice and then went over to give the Scientist a hug.  Sprank imagined the scientist looked a little abashed at such puppy-like forgiveness, even if the shove had been part of the demonstration drill required for the press conference.  A same-faced chorus of bespectacled and white coated scientists said, "awwww," as did the crush of robot-loving Japanese press that filled the demonstration room, most of them were off camera.  Sprank wanted to know what the robot had said.  She'd watched the video clip 23 times since the link had appeared on the wire three hours ago at who knew what hour Tokyo time.  This time she thought she had a pretty good transliteration so she plugged it into a randomly selected  urlLink translator  webpage.  She got back: "Robot descend no ouchie.  Upright super cowboy, OK super fine!  I love you." Sprank had a laugh like someone just slapped a donkey and she amused herself listening to her braying echo off the walls of the Apse, as this solemn little rarely visited wing of the university library was known.  Robots are funny.  She wished she had $54,000 so she could buy one.   Sprank, on the books at least, made poverty wages.  If it were not for the monthly transfers from her father's secret offshore account, she would have no money at all for the toast, gummy candy and spinach that sustained her vital life force.  Or for her handbag habit.  A robot would definitely fall under the heading of "conspicuous consumption" and might blow her cover with the rest of the library staff.  She couldn't lose this cover now, she and Romeo were so close to busting open a major LARVAE conspiracy, he'd have her hide if she lost this secret identity day job.  Plus, it had the added benefit of being in such a forbidding corner of the library that she got to fulfill her public service desk duties while only rarely having to deal with one of those filthy annoying members of the general public.

      Romeo was Sprank's Euro-trash counterpart in the Research and Anti-Espionage Division of Black-Ops Librarians.  He was actually from Southern California and his real name was something like Lincoln or Calvin, something very presidential or corporate, but he had taken on France, Italy and small portions of the Netherlands by storm right out of spy school and now was steeped like very old tea in the culture and attitudes of The Continent.  Sprank first met him when they were new recruits, back when the sheen of expatriotism was still fresh like paint on a doll and some of his lines came off sounding like they'd been copied out of training manuals or bad movies.  Now Romeo was almost an embarrassment as a nom de guerre to him.  It was trying too hard.  And everything that Romeo was about now was effortlessness.  He shared that with Sprank.  A deep commitment to total apathy.  And the only reason, Sprank sometimes felt, that she wasn't totally blown out of her depth dealing with him was that she still had the rebel yell, flip-em-the-bird quality, whereas Romeo's apathy had just gotten jaded and bitter.  Again, like old tea.  She still had some rage in her, which he missed in himself.  Case in point, the invisible car incident. Ten minutes after Sprank had been dismissed by the Commander, Romeo joined her in the Reading Room.  He was carrying a file folder and an elaborately sealed parchment scroll. "Whassat?" Sprank asked.  Not even hello.  If he had brought her a robot there would have been small talk, but since he brought her spy equpiment as a present, she had determined no matter what her heart and hormones told her, to keep this just business. "Your new vehicle papers.  Tres angsty, Magda.  Glad to see all that desk jockey work hasn't dulled your edges." "Dude.  I'm edgier than a well-trimmed lawn.  I'm all about edges these days.  No.  I meant the piece of frilled up sheep hide you got there." "Party invitation." "NO!  We're going to the Espionage Ball?  Really?" "No.  I'm going to the Espionage Ball."  Sprank thought she saw him get shifty.  "With Bootsie." "The hell you are.  She's a double agent!" "Well, not so double.  More ours than theirs these days.  She'll be on a very short leash--" "Kinky!" "Stop it.  Plus she's party-trained." "Well, I should hope so." "Parrrrrty-trained, Magda.  It means she knows which fork goes with the salad and which fork goes with the shrimp.  We're walking a very thin wire here, darling and one faux pas, however adorable, could not only blow the entire sting operation but also get somebody, most importantly moi, as you so endearingly like to put it-  whacked ." "I know a shrimp fork when I see one.  They're the bitty useless little ones that look like Lilliputians use them for harpooning carp." "Nicely done," smiled Romeo, "Proved me wrong with a literary allusion.  But you barely know how to curtsey and we need you on surveilance." "Oh, if there's curtseying then screw it.  She can have the gig."  Sprank smiled and sat down in the chair Romeo was offering her. "That's what I thought you'd say, darling."  Romeo smiled and his hand brushed her shoulder and Sprank felt her stomach and her ears get very very hot.   Oh, this is very annoying  she thought.

      So the following morning it went down something like this... "Special Agent Sprank, would you like to explain what happened to your vehicle?" "Why?  Whappened to my vehicle?" "Sprank, are you drunk?" "Aggg, no.  Just tired." Long, pregnant silence.  The silence was carrying quintuplets and was four weeks past due.  Sprank continued to mouth breathe and stare glassily at the corner of her superior officer's desk.  Romeo sat in one of the fantastically uber-trendy office... well, repose experiential station was a better term than chair because it really was so much more than a chair...  Sprank's head snapped back to the corner of the desk as she noticed her mind wandering ever further.  It was completely gassed and she was afraid at some point it would get out of her reach and just disappear completely. "Sprank!" Mental whiplash. "Yessir!" her body snapped to attention, at least.  Romeo sat up a little straighter.  Which meant he was a tad worried about his old partner.  Generally, Romeo liked to leave the straightness to the pleats in his suit and to let the rest of himself drape gracefully like a tasteful window dressing against doorframes and over furniture.  Sprank usually found boneless slumping to look creepy when practiced by other men, but Romeo was an artiste.  He managed to make it seem, whenever he entered a room, that he was the eternal centerpiece and that the rest of the room had just been hastily thrown together to accomodate his presence.  Now he looked a bit crinkly around the eyes, could those be worry lines?  In his flawless statue face?  Good gad, thought Sprank, I must pull myself together. "Sir.  Could you repeat the question please, sir?" "Madame Sprank.  Would you like to explain the condition of your automobile?" "The condition of my automobile?" "Well, apparently it has become  invisible ."   "Mmmm.  Yes." Romeo choked slightly.  He was trying not to laugh or something.  Good.  Make the cheeky bastard earn that aplomb. "Can you explain this?" "Somnambulism, sir." "Really?" "Quite.  Suffered since childhood.  I must've sleepwalked out and drawn all over my car.  I have no recollection of it whatsoever sir, but it does explain this lingering tiredness." "That's b**ls**t, Sprank." "Oh, no doubt, sir." "Really, Madame, you are a well-respected field agent.  If you wanted a new vehicle, you could have just filled out a form." "But, sir, could I have used a big fattie marker on the form?  Because it really was more about the big fattie marker.  Really." "Get out.  Romeo will join you shortly.  He has new information pertinent to your mission.  You have done some excellent preliminary work, Sprank.  We are in your debt.  This is an amazing, career-building opportunity to make a major dent in LARVAE's operations." "I'm very excited about that, sir.  Practically leaping for joy.  Can I have a robot?" "Get out, Sprank." "Willdo, Sir.  Thank you sir."

      The  urlLink tagger  pen stank with a fumious stink that slinked up Sprank's nose like a centipede.  She imagined tendrils of toxic chemical fumes trilling along her cerebellum and it made her wish she could sneeze.  She tried looking up at the lamppost light, but it was orangey in tint and diffuse enough that it didn't trigger her sneeze response.  If she couldn't sneeze, she wasn't sure how she could wash out her brain.  The toxic pen fumes were making her dizzy and stupid, which she could tell by the fact that she kept tipping over into the side of the little dingey car and by the fact that this idea of hers just kept getting better and better.  She was almost finished, just a few more embellishments.  She had wanted to fill in some of the razzle dazzle marks with a silver pen, but that would have to wait until daylight when she could get a better idea of the overall effect of what she had just done to her vehicle.   It had all come from not having robots.  If Romeo had bought Sprank a robot as a hello again gift, instead of heartless surveilance equipment, she would have been able to keep herself much better entertained during this lockdown period where she was not to leave the walled property of headquarters while Romeo was debriefed.  Gassed up on pen fumes, Sprank laughed again at the dirty pun of "de-briefed."  Stupider by the minute.  Anyway.  No robot equals very bored Sprank.  Bored, listless Sprank, times 3 days of no outside world contact equals insomniac Sprank.  Insomniac Sprank plus two bags of sweet-tarts, 2 liters of Mountain Dew and a barometrically-inspired mild headache equals the return of Sprank the punk-ass vandal.   But Sprank hadn't vandalized anything since her teen years and now staring down the barrel of 30 she discovered she had become quite timid at the thought of doing any real property damage.  But the fatty tagger pen she found in a supply closet near the loading dock called to her with siren sweetness and begged to have its juicy inky contents let loose all over some permanent surface.  So she did the only thing she could think of on short notice.  She graffitied her own car.  Over a period of several hours.  In the middle of the night.  It was quite the masterpiece, truly, much, much more than her banged up, paint-peeled little Sundance deserved.  Jungle foliage swirled around, tropical birds perched above the headlights, fish leaped from the wheelwells.  And in huge letters, right across the rear, Sprank's very stupid joke: "THIS CAR IS INVISIBLE."   Ha.  No robot.  But now the HQ highand mighties were going to have to buy her a new car.  No way could she drive this around town and be all inconspicuous girl anymore.   Knowing already how dumb she was going to feel in the morning, Sprank trundled off to dream of robots and gaseous snakes curled up in her brain.

      The new tree house is quite comfortable, although the monkeys have already discovered how to pick the locks on the windows.  Damned monkeys.  At least the mosquitos stay out and I'm well above the flood marks on the trees, so no fear of the river making a surprise entrance halfway through supper again.  My God that was embarrassing.  The Duchess's new gown half soaked and me unable to loosen the knots on the tied-up canoe because I was drunk and then the bloody monkeys running all across the table, making off with the good silver candlesticks.  What the hell the dirty little primates are doing with all my place settings I've no idea.  They've no obvious culture, so they can't be entertaining with them.  Leland fears they're hoarding them for use as weapons.  Leland would.  Bloody sodding Leland.  Can't believe the Duchess, leaving him here with me for a whole fortnight.  He was useless at rebuilding the treehouse, sat about on his arse the whole time, going through bananas like some kind of engine that runs on potassium but then expels no noticeable force or product except belches and insipid stories about "the time good old Roddy pranged the motorcar straight into a police station and all of us utterly pissed as newts, falling out and vomitting on the coppers' shoes."  Stupid Leland.  We hate him.

       Lies, More Lies and Other People's Tales of Morality   This afternoon we took Arthur to Storytime at the local library- the Queen, Captain Virginia, Peter and I.  The Queen made quite an impression on the many small children there, many of whom wished to sit on her and ask her personal questions, once her portable throne had been erected near the card catalog.  The children feared Peter, who said, "Fine, whatever," and slunk off with Charles to the Archives to look for some Ancient Texts on Important Things and Such.  Virginia and I stayed to watch the Storytime and to help Arthur pick out some reading materials for the coming weeks. The Storyteller was from the Far East, which is actually quite close to Tasmania, geographically, so that was confusing.  He wore many strange fabrics that shined and shimmered and had animals embroidered on them and as he told the stories about the animals, he somehow made the animals dance and fight with each other on the surface of his shirts.  Most of the Tasmanian children had seen his act before at the library and birthday parties, so they kept interrupting and asking questions and making opinionated commentary.  I find Tasmanian children very rude.  Children in my own country are kept in boxes until they are old enough to appear in polite society and use a proper shrimp fork.  Then they are released, trussed up in sailor suits and patent leather shoes and shipped to boarding school where they learn the multiplication tables and do recitations and follow parliamentary rules of debate to resolve playground disputes.  These Tasmanian wild things hit when they are displeased, grab what they want, laugh with their mouths open and sing when they feel like it.  Horrid.  The Queen loves them and could not be prouder of her country's youth.  I was mortified with Arthur, who fit right in. At the end of all the stories, Arthur ran and fetched a book which I'm afraid fully reflected his new base Tasmanian taste.  It was full of  sarcasm  and  satire , I'm afraid.  Captain Virginia was very amused and the Queen laughed heartily.  I grudgingly joined in, however, when Arthur read aloud the following for us in the car on the way home.  It really was, I thought, very droll.  And so true.  So absolutely true.   Duckbilled Platypus vs. BeefSnakStik     From Squids Will Be Squids by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith    "I have a bill like a duck and a tail like a beaver," bragged Duckbilled Platypus.  "So what?" said BeefSnakStik.  "I have beef, soy protein concentrate, and dextrose."  "I also have webbed feet and fur," said Duckbilled Platypus.  "Who cares?" said BeefSnakStik.  "I also have smoke flavoring, sodium erythorbate, and sodium nitrate."  "I am one of only two mammals in the world that lay eggs," said Duckbilled Platypus.  "Big deal," said BeefSnakStik.  "I HAVE BEEF LIPS."  {Moral: Just because you have a lot of stuff, don't think you're so special.}

      Captain's Blog  We are wintering in Tasmania at the Queen's Hobart Palace.  The museum was delighted to get the Joseph Cornell boxes and Etruscan grave markers and the Queen was overjoyed to meet Captain Virginia, whom she immediately commissioned to put the Royal Library, Archives and Fun House in order, which Captain Virginia has been working dutifully at for almost a month now.   Representing the homeland, I, of course, spend most of my time taking Diplomatic Teas with the Queen and her Friends and Callers.  The Conversation is always peppered with witty barbs and scathing gossip, but the Queen is a hostess of extreme personal generosity and a supernaturally well-trained kitchen staff who perform harrowingly sublime feats of pastry and conjure sauces fit for the gods, so every afternoon is a joy and I can hardly wait for the next one. Arthur seems to have truly found his element here and scampers about the palace with Delwin and Thimble, Wimble and Celeste, finding secret passages and monk's holes and drawing treasure maps late into the night.  Charles has found a tower room with a pleasant view where he prepares his Penguin Lexicon for publication, conferring with Delwin in the mornings.  Dr. Bippie has set up shop in the evening parlor and has many buxom female clients who visit him regularly.  Apparently men of his talents are hard to find in Tasmania. Peter is a regular visitor to the palace, except during certain times of the month, obviously.  The Queen finds him droll, and having an uncle who suffered from a curse that turned him into a frog during every solar eclipse, she is quite sympathetic to Peter's peculiar plight. The palace is of course infested with poltergeists. We still have found no further clues as to what Smike was up to.  Captain Virginia worries more than I, she has attempted several times to get back in touch with Lady Pendergrass, but the woman seems to be giving her the brush off.  Mr. Poom eventually got too nervous and begged Virginia to desist.  She now pesters me to ask the Queen about any connections she may know of with Lady Pendergrass or a mysterious organization that Captain Virginia I believe called LARVAE.  But one does not want to bring up flies- in any of their gestational forms- during tea, and I don't want to become too personal with her Highness, so I have not yet found a tactful time to draw out such information conversationally.  Viriginia, I fear, is becoming a bit exasperated.  Can't be helped at the moment I am afraid.  When Charles finishes his lexicon, perhaps he will help me construct a nefarious and delicate linguistic trap, but until then I wish to maintain the Queen's trust.  She is very lovely. And all of that business seems so long ago and far away on a cold dark sea.  And here and now it is so cozy by this fire in this overstuffed chair, drinking this lovely tea, listening to this lovely soothing music, petting this lovely purring cat, doing this crossword puzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...

      Smike had found an e-book containing all the Horatio Hornblower series underneath a bench in the tiny boat.  He thought Jack and Dab, being pirates, would find some amusement in the classic nautical tales of maritime adventure and quit picking scabs and poking each other in the back of the head for at least one morning.  They were distracted, but instead of reading quietly, spent the whole day thinking up ridiculus nasty puns on "Hornblower." Smike was quite at the end of his tether.  They had to be somewhere near Malaysia by now?  The ocean hereabouts should be ruddy sodding full of islands, how could he be missing all of them in the dark?  Smike was not fond of despair, wouldn't abide it, but he began to indulge, ever so slightly, in malaise. Land land land.  Where the hell was all the land? And now Jack and Dab were back poking each other again. Bugger.

      Dear Mother, Landfall at last, and not a moment too soon, I assure you.  We were all going right starkers in that little rowboat out in the middle of the sea, the sea, the endless sea.  Smike has startling aptitudes of navigation and got us across reefs and shoals and through waters both shark and typhoon infested.  And finally it has paid off for today we found ourselves washed ashore on a very pleasant little tropical Eden with lots of fruit flinging itself out of trees at us, coconuts piled to your heart's content, soft sand, soft sunshine, soft green foliage upon which to nap or with which to make a quite jaunty hat, and monkeys who display excellent manners and comedic timing.  Oh!  And two very dapper gentlemen.  One, named Leland, is an absolute tip top fellow.  Quite a roustabout, excellent sense of humor, I sense he and Dab and I will get along famously.  The other calls himself Francis the Second and he is a bit more sour of expression, perhaps because his uniform had been chewed upon.  Oh, Mother, here is the most absolutely dodger thing of it, Smike and this Francis knew each other!  [A tear in the paper and a large ink spill followed by a change in handwriting.] Hullo Mum, Dab here.  Didn't think I'd let Jack have all the fun, did you?  Jack is sulking because he doesn't get to tell the best part of this big tale, but too bad for Jack.  So, we pulled up our little boat on the beach, and after a joyous jig of "Land Ho!" we noticed two gents marching down out of the trees at us.  One quite a large bloke, limping a bit, and wearing a sort of jaunty leopard-print toga item.  The other was in dress whites, a bit frayed around the edges, with thick spectacles and an air of superiority about him.  He introduced himself as Francis the Second and this was his cousin Leland.  Jack and I stepped forward to shake hands and be sociable and then to demand fresh water and bananas, but then Smike stepped forward and all time seemed to stop for a blip. "Well, hello, Smike," says Francis 2. "Hello Francis." "How simply absurd of you to just drop in like this." "Most untoward of me, I know.  Absolutely necessary, however, I assure you.  My traveling companions have gone quite mad from staring at the sea for weeks, otherwise we shouldn't have disturbed you and would just have gone right on rowing to South Africa." (Don't worry, Mum, we're not mad a bit.  Well, not any madder than usual.) "Well, you're certainly welcome to some R&R on this lovely island.  Leland will show you to the tree house.  I, regretfully, can not stay, and I must, regretfully, commandeer your rowboat." "Why, Francis, have you received an Invitation?" (It was his tone, Mother, that implied the Capitalization.) For a moment Francis looked like he'd maybe swallowed something he didn't his mother to know he'd put in his mouth, but then he just decided to out with it. "Yes, Smike, I have received an Invitation.  The Ball begins in 47 hours and as there is no other means of transportation off this island, I shall have to take your boat." "Well, my boat comes with me as captain and no other way, Francis.  I myself have a standing Invitation, as you probably know, and so we shall go together to the Espionage Ball."  Smike looked downright gleeful at the prospect, but Francis looked like maybe he'd rather eat his own arm.  "Very well, Smike, if this is the way it must be with you.  We shall go together.  Leland, summon the monkeys." And then, Mum, you'll never guess.  This Leland whistled and thirty monkeys came running out of the trees with paddles and jumped in the rowboat and Smike and Francis 2 jumped in the rowboat and they hardly had time to sit down before the monkeys had the thing back in the water and headed along at about 20 or 30 knots, paddles flying and splashing away. "Well, my fine fellows!" yelped Leland chipperly, "Shall we eat some bananas and then tell fart jokes until they come back to get us?" Righto! love, Dab (and Jack) (but Dab more) (but Jack better) (shove off) (you first) (no, you) (stinker) (fatty) (ow!  now you've done it) [many more ink splots and quite a vicious stab through the paper with the pen]

      "Have we an ocelot?" asked Leland this morning, while I was doing my sun salutations. Stupid Leland. We continue to hate him and wonder why he has not been removed by the Duchess long before now. She can't have forgotten us? "Have we an ocelot?" Leland asked again. However much I wished I could ignore him, I have learned over the past months that if Leland is not immediately gratified in any of his requests he becomes Belligerant and then he becomes Recalcitrant and then he becomes Violent and Rude. "No. No ocelots, Leland," I replied, dropping into Downward Dog pose. Leland always laughs at me when I do this pose. He did again this morning. "Ha!  Your bum's up in the air." I found it to be a bit too much that Leland could make the same silly observation every morning for seven weeks and still find amusement in it. I was about to say something very very snarky, when I received a most alarming message cocunut delivery from the Monkey Mail. "Hey, what's that?" yelped Leland, taken aback by the message-bearing coconut missile fired into our treetop home by the long, slim arm of a local macaque. "It's private," I scowled, huddling in a corner to open what turned out to be my very crumpled and well-traveled invitation to the Espionage Ball. Oh! What to do, dear Diary, what to do? To finally be invited but to only receive the invitation 48 hours before the event and to be trapped on an island in the South Pacific, my only hope of catching a ride to the Ball being to wait for the Duchess to toodle back around on her pleasure yacht and remove her obnoxious cousin and then possibly take enough pity on me to give me a lift. It was a beauteous and tragic morning all at once. And it was only to get more confusing. "Hello, what's that?" exclaimed Leland turning away from me and towards something on the beach. "What's what?" I inquired. He stood tall and wide, blocking my view with his impressive physique. "It's private," he sneered. I stomped on his bare foot with my wooden clog and as he screamed and dropped to the treehouse floor, a Magnificent Sight was revealed to me. A small craft, manned by three unshaven but otherwise healthy looking individuals, had landed on the beach. Finally! An opportunity for International Diplomacy. I darted to my hope chest and, with great alacrity, drew out my dress white uniform. Off of which all the beautiful gold braid trim had been chewed. Blast and bugger the insufferable monkeys!
