						         In this hour one of the adversary’s foremost lines of attack is to bring accusation upon God’s people.  It is very important that we follow our conscience and walk a life void of offense. Walk circumspectly and walk praiseworthy of our calling.  If we fall short, admit it, get up and try again. But do not cover it, for what is done in secret shall be shouted from the house tops.         If we have been falsely accused, we must identify that it is the season for such.  Don’t you know that if they accused Jesus, so shall they accuse us? God knows this grieves us, as it grieves Him. But regardless of what man shall say about us, as long as we have God’s defense and His backing, we shall be safe. Fear not man, rather fear God’s disapproval. Delight God and you have nothing to fear.         The accusers do not comprehend, neither will they until it is too late. So let the accusations go and trust God to bring you all the way through it.  Realize that God give honor to who honor is due.   Yes, God will honor you, but it may not be in the manner in which you choose or to whom you may choose. You can not direct the will of man, so let their response go. Conquer this and overcome it and you will have a crown prepared and waiting.         "And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night." (Revelations 12:10)

						         Prayer is not only response to God's grace as brought to us in the life and work of Jesus and the teachings of Scripture; it is also request for our needs and the needs of others. For good reasons God's holy and wise purpose does not permit Him to grant every petition just as it is asked.   Several hindrances to answered prayer are:  Iniquity in the heart (Psalm 66:18),  Refusal to hear God's law (Proverbs 28:9),  An estrange heart (Isaiah 29:13),  Sinful separation from God (Isaiah 59:2),  Waywardness (Jeremiah 14:10-12),  Offering unworthy sacrifices (Malachi 1:7-9),  Praying to be seen by people (Matthew 6:5-6),  Pride in fasting and tithing (Luke 18:11-14),  Lack of faith (Hebrews 11:6), and  Doubting or double-mindedness (James 4:3).   More positively:   God has promised to answer our request when we:  Start helping the hungry and afflicted (Isaiah 58:9-10),  When we believe that we will receive what we ask (Mark 1:22-24),  When we forgive others (Mark 11:25-26),  When we ask in Christ's name (John 14:13-14), and  When we abide in Christ and His words (John 15:7), also Pray in the spirit (Ephesians 6:8),  Obey the Lord's commandments (1 John 3:22), and  Ask according to His will (1 John 5:14-15).         Until we have properly responded to God and His word, He cannot entrust us with His powerful resources. Prayer is request to a personal Lord who answers as He knows best. We should not think that we will always have success in obtaining the things for which we ask. In His wisdom, God hears and answers in the way that is best for us.

						   Dedicated Action     Christ's example does not require us to withdraw from society, but to render service to the needy in a spirit of prayer. He wept over Jerusalem in compassionate prayer, and then He went into the city to give His life a ransom for many. Authentic prayer will be the source of courage and productivity, as it was for the prophets and apostles.

						         I'm just, a nobody, trying to tell everybody, about Somebody who can save anybody.    Coming straight from God's Word…It means low lying, of low degree, to be brought low, of low estate, cast down, or humble in spirit.  The word for humility is translated several different ways in the New Testament alone:  Matthews 18:4 "humble",  Matthews 23:12 "abased" Luke 3:5 "brought low" Luke 1:46 "low estate" Luke 1:52 "low degree" Acts 8:33 "humiliation" II Corinthians 7:6 "cast down" II Corinthians 10:1 "base" Philippians 3:21, "vile" in reference to the body of humiliation. James 1:10 "made low"  But my favorite comes from the old testament: Better to be a nobody and yet have a servant than pretend to be somebody and have no food.  Proverbs 12:9 NIV  Moses spent forty years thinking he was somebody; then he spent forty years on the back side of the desert realizing he was nobody; finally he spent the last forty years of his life learning what God can do with a nobody! That is humility!  When God intends to fill a soul, He first makes it empty. When he intends to enrich a soul He first makes it poor; when He intends to exalt a soul, He first makes it sensible of its own miseries, wants, and nothingness. That is humility!  God has two thrones, one in the highest heavens and the other in the lowliest heart. That is humility!  Humility will do several things for you:   1. Take you away from the shadow of yourself.  2. Keep you from a sense of over evaluating yourself..  3. Save yourself from thrusting yourself upon others.  4. Save you from the desire of displaying yourself.  5. Keep you from the "center stage" mentality.  6. Save you from desiring to be the object of observation.     Beloved, we must discern that humility is not measured in giftedness.  God sees the heart and others see the glory.  But humility is esteeming others higher than us. Humility is the recognition that others have gifts we need, and that our lives can not be full without the operation of the entire body.  Humility is recognition of dependence and interdependence. God has made us a team member and we can not function without others around us. No matter how gifted we are, we will always need others. God has made it that way so no member in His body can boast of independence and live on its own. Every member is important and as long as we understand that we will have a humble heart and treat others with humility.   "And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary." (1 Corinthians 12:21, 22)   Therefore, I stand and say again I'm just, a nobody, trying to tell everybody, about Somebody who can save anybody.  Elder J. Andres Vazquez

						   Thanksgiving      Are we unthankful because we think we have not received what we deserve? But if we got what we "deserved," we would be condemned because of our guilt. As sinners, we are not people of God by nature. We have no claim upon His mercy or grace. Nevertheless, He has forgiven our sins, granted us acceptance as His people, and given us His righteousness standing and a new heart and life. Ingratitude marks the ungodly, "because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful" (Romans 1:21). Believers, in contrast, live thankfully. God has been at work on our behalf in countless ways. So in everything, even for the discipline that is unpleasant, we give thanks (Colossians 3:17; 1 Thessalonians 5:18).

						   Praise   Though it is difficult, start with praise.  Focus on God’s character.  The natural outgrowth of faith, worship, confession, and adoration is praise. We speak well of one whom we highly esteem and love. The one whom we respect and love above all others naturally receives our highest commendation.   We praise Him for His "mighty acts....according to His excellent greatness" (Psalm150:2) and for His "righteous judgments" (Psalm 119:164).   For God Himself, for His works, and for His words, His people give sincere praise.

						   Sisters, Women of God…  Rise up!    I say again…  Rise up!    Lift your heads up and walk upright and realize that you are somebody.    Let me remind you that in the book of Mark chapter five verse forty-one, the same God who took the lifeless “child by the hand and said “Talitha cumi” which is interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise” is still available today.    Rise up!    Let me also remind you that in the same book of Mark and the very same chapter (five), now go back six verses and discover yourself in verse thirty-five…when you got it, say amen…now the same God who “immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him” and healed a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years…still has that asset available for your every issues today.  Rise up!  For you brothers out there who are suffering from Gynophobia…wake up…and get over it…for she is a help mate.   In the book of Jeremiah chapter nine verse seventeen, The Bible says, "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may draw closer; and send for cunning women, that they may come".  God has providence for women.  He wants you to unlock your jaws and cry out against the malevolence that the devil has placed upon her and us as well. She has what I call, “The Triple C”, Capacity, Contributions and Capital within her that can bring glory to God.  Let us all come together, Brothers and Sisters in the name of Jesus and defeat the devil and accomplish our destiny.  Elder J. Andres Vazquez

						        By the time the Lord made woman, he was into his sixth day of working  overtime. An angel appeared and said, "Why are you spending so much time on this one?" And the Lord answered, "Have you seen my spec sheet on her? She has to be completely  washable, but not plastic, have over 200 movable parts, all replaceable and able to run on diet coke and leftovers, have a lap that can hold four children at one time, have a kiss that can cure anything from a scraped knee to a broken heart-and she will do everything with only two hands."        The angel was astounded at the requirements. "Only two hands!? No way! And that's just on the standard model? That's too much work for one day. Wait until tomorrow to finish." But I won't," the Lord protested. "I am so close to finishing this creation that is so close to my own heart. She already heals herself when she is sick AND can work 18 hour days."        The angel moved closer and touched the woman. "But you have made her so soft, Lord." "She is soft," the Lord agreed, "but I have also made her tough. You have no idea what she can endure or accomplish." "Will she be able to think?", asked the angel. The Lord replied, "Not only will she be able to think, she will be able to reason and negotiate."        The angel then noticed something, and  reaching out, touched the woman's cheek. "Oops, it looks like you have a leak in this model I  told you that you were trying to put too much into this one." "That's not a leak," the Lord corrected, "that's a tear!" "What's the tear for?" the angel asked. The Lord said, "The tear is her  way of expressing her joy, her sorrow, her pain, her disappointment, her love, her loneliness,  her grief and her pride."        The angel was impressed. "You are a genius, Lord. You thought of everything! Woman is truly amazing." And she is! Women have strengths that amaze men.   They bear hardships and they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love and joy.   They smile when they want to scream.   They sing when they want to cry.   They cry when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous.   They fight for what they believe in.   They stand up to injustice.   They don't take "no" for an answer when they believe there is a better solution.   They go without so their family can have.   They go to the doctor with a frightened friend.   They love unconditionally.   They cry when their children excel and cheer when their friends get awards.   They are happy when they hear about a birth or a wedding.    Their hearts break when a friend dies.   They grieve at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left.   They know that a hug and a kiss can heal a broken heart.   Women come in all shapes, sizes and colors.   They'll drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you to show how much they care about you.   The heart of a woman is what makes the world keep turning.   They bring joy, hope and love. They have compassion and ideals.   They give moral support to their family and friends.   Women have vital things to say and everything to give.   HOWEVER...   IF THERE IS ONE FLAW IN WOMEN, IT IS THAT THEY FORGET THEIR WORTH.

						   Adoration  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God is love, and He has demonstrated His love in the gift of His Son. The greatest desire of God is that we love Him with our whole being (Matthew 22:37). Our love should be expressed, as His has been expressed, in both deeds and words. People sometimes find it difficult to say to others and God, "I love you." But when love for God fills our lives, we will express our love in prayer to the one who is ultimately responsible for all that we are.

						   Confession&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness of Gods holiness leads to consciousness of our own sinfulness. Like the prophet Isaiah, we exclaim, "Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts" (Isaiah 6:5).   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sinning we hurt ourselves and those closest to us; but first of all, and worst of all, sin is against God (Psalm 51:4). We need not confess our sins to another being. But we should confess them directly to God, who promises to forgive us of all our unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).

						   Worship  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In worship we recognize what is of highest worth, not ourselves, others, or our work, but God. Only the highest divine being deserves our highest respect. Guided by Scripture, we set our values in accord with God's will and perfect standards. Before God, angels hide their faces and cry, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts" (Isaiah 6:3).

						   Faith  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most meaningful prayer comes from a heart that places its trust in the God who has acted and spoken in the Jesus of history and the teachings of the Bible. God speaks to us through the Bible, and we in turn speak to Him in trustful, believing prayer. Assured by Scripture that God is personal, living, active, all-knowing, all-wise, and all-powerful, we know that God can hear and help us. A confident prayer life is built on the cornerstone of Christ's work and words as shown by the prophets and apostles in the Bible.

						   Communication with God.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because God is personal, all people can offer prayers. However, sinners who have not trusted Jesus Christ for their salvation remain alienated from God. So while unbelievers may pray, they do not have the basis for a rewarding fellowship with God. They have not met the conditions laid down in the Bible for effectiveness in prayer. Christians recognize their dependence upon their Creator. They have every reason to express gratitude for God's blessings. But thy have far more reason to respond to God than this. They respond to the love of God for them.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's love is revealed through the incarnation and life of Christ, His atoning provision at the cross, His resurrection, and His continuing presence through the Holy Spirit. Prayer cannot be replaced by devout good works in a needy world. Important as service to others is, at times we must turn away from it to God, who is distinct from all things and over all things. Neither should prayer be thought of as a mystical experience in which people lose their identity in the infinite reality.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective prayer must be a scripturally informed response of persons saved by grace to the living God who can hear and answer on the basis of Christ's payment of the penalty that sinners deserved.   As such, prayer involves several important aspects:&nbsp; Such as Faith, Worship, Confession, Adoration, Praise, Thanksgiving, Dedicated Action, Request, Effectiveness

						   Worship is the ideal way to do all that God instructs. When God's love takes hold of our lives, it touches us so profoundly that our egotistical desires change.   If we truly worship Him, we won't lie.   If we truly worship Him, we won't defraud.&nbsp;   If we truly worship Him, we won’t gossip.&nbsp;   If we truly worship Him, we won't be self-centered.   Is worship employed in your life today?  Elder Vazquez

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my name is the malicious communication of facts, rumors or behind the scene information of an intimate or personal nature which injuries the reputation of another.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am motivated by a deep-seated often-unexplainable desire to see another suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am more deadly than the screaming shell from the howitzer. I win without killing. I tear down homes, break hearts, and wreck lives. I travel on the wings of the wind. No innocence is strong enough to intimidate me, no purity pure enough to daunt me. I have no regard for truth, no respect for justice, no mercy for the defenseless. My victims are as the sands of the sea, and often as innocent. I never forget and seldom forgive.&nbsp; What is my name?   My name is G O S S I P.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brothers and Sisters, Slander is the communication of false charges or misrepresentations, which defame and damage another's reputation.&nbsp; I know we’re well aware of the accusations and assumption that continues to hinders the men and women of God today.&nbsp; Don’t ever let your guards down.&nbsp; Gossip is just one of many battles we will face.&nbsp; Spiritual warfare is definitely for real.&nbsp; The Bible says "And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force."&nbsp; The devil will fight till the very end therefore we shall fight to the very end also.&nbsp; Let’s continue to fast, pray and fight the good fight and though some of us will suffer violence, let us lean on with faith on Gods Word and take it by force. &nbsp; God Bless you all  Elder J.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I truly believe that one of the greatest prayers in the Bible is that of the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 3:16,  "That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man". &nbsp; Our weakness is in ourselves and our strength is in Him.&nbsp; In a day when it seems that the forces of evil are stronger than ever, it is vitally important that there rise up a strong army of "Mighty Men for God".&nbsp;&nbsp; That a spiritual battle is being waged is as true today as it was when Paul first penned the words,  "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against the powers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places".   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time that we take a stand against the one who comes to "steal, and to kill, and to destroy.&nbsp; "Whether or not we are successful in taking that stand will depend on whether or not there is raised up, in our generation, a band of "Mighty Men" for God, men who are strong in the Spirit, men who stand for righteousness, ethical behavior, integrity, personal and family responsibility, and who provide protection and leadership within the Body of Christ.&nbsp; I for one, am ready.&nbsp; The question I ask is…  &nbsp;  Are you?  &nbsp;  Yours because of Calvary,  &nbsp;  In service of the King,  &nbsp;  Elder J.

						   I dreamed I had an interview with God.   “So you would like to interview me?” God asked.  “If you have the time” I said.   God smiled. “My time is eternity.” “What questions do you have in mind for me?”  “What surprises you most about humankind?”  God answered... “That they get bored with childhood, they rush to grow up, and then  long to be children again.”  “That they lose their health to make money... and then lose their money to restore their health.”  “That by thinking anxiously about the future,  they forget the present,  such that they live in neither  the present nor the future.”  "That they live as if they will never die,  and die as though they had never lived.”  God’s hand took mine and we were silent for a while.  And then I asked... “As a parent, what are some of life’s lessons  you want your children to learn?”  “To learn they cannot make anyone  love them. All they can do  is let themselves be loved.”  “To learn that it is not good  to compare themselves to others.”  “To learn to forgive by practicing forgiveness.”  “To learn that it only takes a few seconds  to open profound wounds in those they love,  and it can take many years to heal them.”   “To learn that a rich person  is not one who has the most, but is one who needs the least.”  “To learn that there are people  who love them dearly,  but simply have not yet learned  how to express or show their feelings.”  “To learn that two people can  look at the same thing  and see it differently.”  “To learn that it is not enough that they  forgive one another, but they must also forgive themselves.”  "Thank you for your time," I said humbly.   "Is there anything else  you would like your children to know?"  God smiled and said,  “Just know that I am here... always.”

						   I asked God “Is there truly a little boy in us as men?” and to my surprise the answer came with an unanticipated message on forgiveness.  It comes from First Corinthians chapter fourteen and verse twenty, which reads, "Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.”    Brothers, we are God's children, so we should always be humble before God as His dear children. We should be forgiving as children forgive, as well.  Children can brawl one minute, and in the next five minutes be in concert again. They are quick to forgive and forget. In that, we should be just like them. We should not be children in the decisions we formulate, however. We should be mature Christians in understanding. We should grow in the Lord each day, so that we will be wise in the decisions that we make. Our understanding of the things of God must be influenced by the instruction of the Holy Spirit.  Forgiveness is the most Christ-like act a Christian can do. Never are you more like Christ than when you forgive because that is what Christ does. Forgiveness is a magnificent virtue.  Yours because of Calvary,   In service of the King,   Elder J. Andres Vazquez

						   The following quote contains "principles for Christian living" that are taken mostly from the 'wisdom' literature of the bible- Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. It is impossible for one to live right, or to have wholesome relationships, without following Scriptural principles.   I'VE LEARNED that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone who can be loved... The rest is up to them.   I'VE LEARNED that no matter how much I care, some people just don't care back.   I'VE LEARNED that no matter how good a friend is, they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that.   I'VE LEARNED that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.   I'VE LEARNED that there are people who love you dearly, but just don't know how to show it.   I'VE LEARNED that true friendship continues to grow, even over the longest distance.   I'VE LEARNED that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had, and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.   I'VE LEARNED that no matter how bad your heart is broken the world doesn't stop for your grief.   I'VE LEARNED that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.   I'VE LEARNED that just because two people argue, it doesn't mean they don't love each other. And just because they don't argue, it doesn't mean they do.   I'VE LEARNED that two people can look at the exact same thing and see something totally different.   I'VE LEARNED that no matter the consequences, those who are honest with themselves get farther in life.   I'VE LEARNED that even when you think you have no more to give, when a friend cries out to you, you will find the strength to help.   I'VE LEARNED that credentials on the wall do not make you a decent human being.   I'VE LEARNED that it's hard to determine where to draw the line between being nice and not hurting people's feelings, and standing up for what you believe.   I'VE LEARNED that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it.   I'VE LEARNED that sometimes when I'm angry I have the right to be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.   I'VE LEARNED that either you control your attitude, or it controls you.   I'VE LEARNED that it's not WHAT you have in your life but WHO you have in your life that counts.   I'VE LEARNED that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes.  After that, you had better know something.   I'VE LEARNED that it's taking me a long time to become the person I want to be.   I'VE LEARNED that you can keep going long after you think you can't.   I'VE LEARNED that learning to forgive takes practice.

						   Prayer has power over everything. God can intelligently act in any part of the universe or human history. Although some people think prayer is a waste of time, the Bible declares that "the effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much" (James 5:16).  Prayer meets inner needs.   One who prays will receive: Freedom from fear (Psalm 118:5-6),  Strength of soul (Psalm 138:3),  Guidance and satisfaction (Isaiah 58:9-11),  Wisdom and understanding (Daniel 9:20-27),  Deliverance from harm (Joel 2:32),  Reward (Matthew 6:6),  Good gifts (Luke 11:13),  Fullness of joy (John 16:23-24),  Peace (Philippians 4:6-8), and  Freedom from anxiety (1 Peter 5:7).   One may ask “Is prayer effective only in the inner lives of those who pray?” and the answer is...   “No”, prayer can make a difference in the lives of others.   Biblical writers believed prayer for others could result in greater wisdom and power (Ephesians 1:18-19);   Inward strength, knowledge of Christ's love, filling with God's fullness (Ephesians 3:16-19);   Discernment, approval of what is excellent, filling with fruits of righteousness (Philippians 1:9-11);   Knowledge of God's will, spiritual understanding, a life pleasing to God, fruitfulness, endurance, patience, joy (Colossians 1:9-12);   A quiet, peaceable life (1 Timothy 2:1-2);   Love for one another and all people, holiness before God (1 Thessalonians 3:10-13);   Comfort and establishment in every good word and work (2 Thessalonians 2:16-17);   Love for God, steadfastness in Christ (2 Thessalonians 3:5);   The sharing of one's faith, promotion of the knowledge of all that is good (Philemon 6); and   Equipment for every good work that is pleasing to God (Hebrews 13:20-21).   Some people who think prayer can affect others question the ability of God to change His usual patterns in the physical world. But some prayers in the Bible changed nature and physical bodies.   Jabez prayed for enlarged borders and protection from harm (1 Chronicles 4:10).   Other people in the Bible prayed for deliverance from trouble Psalm 34:15-22),   Deliverance from both poverty and riches (Proverbs 30:7-9),   Deliverance from the belly of a great fish (Jonah 2:7-10),   Daily bread (Matthew 6:11),   Preservation and sanctification of spirit, soul, and body (1 Thessalonians 5:23),   The healing of the sick (James 5:14-15), and   The ending of the rain and it's beginning again (James 5:17-18).   When the disciples prayed, the building around them shook (Acts 4:31) and an earthquake opened the doors of their prison (Acts 16:25-26).   Brothers and Sisters, our prayers do make a difference in how God acts in the world.
