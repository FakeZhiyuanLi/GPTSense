      Regrets  Why expect so much from me? Don’t I have the right to be wrong? Why am I so different from them? Finally, it seems like I really don’t belong.  To live in a different view That is what I often hope for I can’t see which is true My mind’s window or my heart’s door  I don’t intend to be in this situation Somehow I regret the path I took I’m bound with chains—I can’t push through Cuffed with sadness—now I’m blue  Being in this—I can’t be fine I wonder why I worry too much Maybe because I’ve grown to this bout So now it’s hard to leave and back out.  I can’t escape—everyone’s staring Every step I make—still they’re looking Just for once can I ask for something? Give me back my freedom—my own precious feeling…

      03132k4  Nth cain  Late night dew drops form On petals waiting to bloom Day break and still wide awake Lying face up on my room Torn apart but standing, hoping to be whole again Scared to act and be known—wonderin’ if I really can.  It rushed through so suddenly  But I felt every inch of pain Gush of blood, tear in my heart Seem to be the nth cain. Deeply hurt though the feeling is shallow Coz my actions are limited, just bound to follow.  Early morning dew drops lay On petals waiting to bloom Dusk of night just thinking Of a way out of this doom.  Don’t rush to be complete  Coz time is a hard thing to meet. There is o reason to be so hasty Coz everything is planned in my own destiny.

      02212k4  happy  months ago I dreamt of you I don’t know how and why My dream just flew You were my savior… Looking out for me  In reality I never thought of you Not until today, I never knew I never expected I’d like you But I’m happy I just do… You are my light… Shining to lead me  I’m happy just the way this is Though I know you see me differently From a distance I can see you Still I’m happy, but I won’t hope Coz you’ll never be with me  Thinkin’ bout these makes me whine Will my dream ever come true? No one can tell but I thank you I’m happy you crossed my mind But I know my limits—you’ll never be mine.

      11282k3  certain  I don’t want them to be kept hidden It’s hard to cover up what you’re really feelin’ Tired of hearing the same old lies Fed up believing these would suffice.  But why do I feel bitter like this? Familiar places, scenes and faces. I thought I’d be wiser this time around But it’s wrong to presume what I really found.  I’ll have my time I know I will To call my own destiny to fill Forget about what we had back then Coz I don’t wanna make the same mistake again.  Maybe I’m just too afraid to feel But how would I know if this is for real? If I’d be a stone, would I be happy? This I’m quite sure—no, I would not be…

      7 30p 11022k3  second flight  for so long, I’ve fooled myself I’ve become so blind, numb and deaf. Can’t see reality the way it is Coz I’m longing to feel what I think I miss  I’m over you at least I think Flipped my wings to another twig But hanging on to this sight Leads once more to my plight.  Why should it be this way? How come I can’t figure this one out? Just tired of dreaming you would stay Fooling myself I won this bout.  But at least I felt it, though painful it’s sweet… My second flight remains to be Yet another unsolved mystery… Or would it really be?

I admit I’m wrong I shouldn’t have hoped so much I should have been contented My aching heart is crushed.  Thank you for the time you spent with me Coz u made me feel complete Thanks for the lesson you taught Hiding behind the pain you caused  Where darkness reigns I know there is light. Though for now I may be broken Soon I’ll be complete again  So stop… coz I’ve had enough When my heart was torn apart. My eyes are already wide open I’m certain I won’t be bleeding again.

      9 20p 09072k3  vulnerable  I’m a fool coz I believe I just see what I want to see I’m so stupid to really think That you care so much about me  Behind that innocent façade Lies a heart of typical kind Eager to explore and to find New things to puzzle my mind  Stop playing games with me I’m tired of losing Denying the feeling I’m in Sick of admitting my sin.  If only I could see right through you, Then I would know what you really feel, Then I would know what I would do… Then I would know what to feel…

      10p 08072k3  in doubt  ties that bind us, if they are strong would stand steadily—right or wrong but why am I feeling we’re rotten inside? Inner thoughts and reasons—these we just hide.  How can we dare say we’re gonna last forever If amongst ourselves we’re lost down under Why should we be called as such? If in times we’ll just run out of touch.  Minds in difference, but acts as one Hiding forever amounts to none Years that passed will be in vain If we will remain to be the same.  To hear the words stuck inside To see the thoughts in our minds Without the cover, just the plain truth Will set us free from all these fools…  A piece of me bleeds because I see Reality which seems to bug no one but me Stoned and confused as I am today Wonderin’ if everything will be okay.

      7 30p 05312k3  trigger  struck with a stupid judgment can’t believe I have fallen for playful words not meant to hurt but somehow in my mind was incurred  it never really mattered before coz it wasn’t exactly what I cared for  but now that I have grown up, something in me says, “it’s enough.”  Humanity’s sense of perfection Is what everyone tries to live up to The standards are set with no options,  It’s wrong but that’s what I oughtta do.  Yes, words have that mush power  To swing you to a mind setting But bear in mind it depends on you Whether or not you wanna fit in.  There’s a good side too in my case Coz I can somehow have a say Envy has got no more space, And that’s non-conformity in a way.

      11 40p 05272k3  my heart’s words  it’s hard to admit this but it’s true I have grown farther away from you Stress and pressure just went out of hand Aggravated by your reprimand  I miss the days when I’m still young When hugs and kisses were precious gems Those moments are already gone And time is hard to fight against  I should have understood both situations  But i acted tough and hard instead Leading to miserably wrong actions I’m sorry’s not gonna undo what was said  Miles apart our hearts might be But still love bridges you and me Coz our souls and blood are of the same Unconditional love and care remain  I’m making upfor the times wasted It seems we both are, I have noticed A vivid image of us together Is in my mind and heart forever…

      1a 05212k3  a need to change  there are too many “I’s” I’ve said my life, my happiness and my regrets I never realized how selfish I’ve become It’s always “I and me” but in “others” I’m numb  I’m not the only person who is in pain We all get hurt coz we’re just the same Why do I always feel that I am alone? Facing ordeals and struggles on my own  I was blinded by the scene About how things work out to be My mind’s just stuck on me So haunted by my own grief  Acceptance may be a hard task But it’s not too late to learn and start Because it’s worth half the road crossed It rekindles the fire I thought was lost  Things happen for a certain reason What had happened can never be undone The mistakes we did are a part of the past Grieving over should be chosen last.  Love others because of what they are Not because of who they happen to be Just always listen to your heart But have an open mind to see  It’s wrong to indulge on things you don’t need So don’t be a slave for lust and greed Be contented but aspire and dream Coz life’s beginning is love’s mainstream.

      11 15p 05112k3  mellow  I never realized that years have passed After the hard work and the sleepless nights I never realized how fast time fleets Until this moment of truth and light  The day when I woke up and sought To learn the whys and wherefores Of my being and my future If it’s too late or too soon, I’m not sure.  A very long time I was given To reckon about what I wanna be About what I’m really feelin’  About what is suitable for me…  I’m still lookin’ beyond the mirror Hoping to see a sign to believe My search for light is not yet complete So my quest’s gonna follow my lead.  Absence of pressure urged me  To be hopeful and become happy I have mellowed but soon I’ll return To the “me” I used to be…  It’s alright to think and reflect for awhile Don’t be hasty but don’t waste your time Live up your dreams and don’t mess with your life Coz it isn’t over ’til you give up the fight.

      10 42p 04232k3  my plea  yes I’m free… but how long would I be? Before the walls would be put up Again I’ll stay weary Would anyone please, just release me?  My cell will rearrange Thought my life has changed But I’m haunted… forced… pressured… Sank to the lowest… degraded… flickered.  I’m happy now and I’m contented With a simple life left not bothered But it won’t be long before they come And put me where I should be from  Why can’t you see, I don’t like the way it used to be? Should you be the one to hold the key To my life, no that shouldn’t be Coz you don’t even know me… And you don’t own me!  I’ve been putting up quite some time now Too much pressure, I can’t allow Oh, I really wanna break free From the life which they expect to see  I am just human, I am born to err But is this deed a mistake to consider? If I just want to have my liberty By not being dictated with what I wanna be  Please understand me and do not expect Don’t be disappointed coz I’m not perfect I’m already fed up with your regulations It’s now time to stand…I’ve learned my lessons.

      3 10p 04092k3  see reality  I woke up and felt the sun Its rays striking ahead  With sleep eyes still not gone As I struggle to step out of my bed  An ordinary day it might seem Same trend, same pace, same light But then I felt a different beam Leading me out from the night  A new hope has come my way The reason to live my life again Beginning with a brand new day Forget about myself back then  Though I don’t know my plans for the future At least I am sure I’m the best I can be Safe and protected; with myself to nurture Certain that I am really free.  Confused back then about the night Afraid of the dim, gloomy trail Because of that I learned to fight Learned to accept to win or fail.  Darkness is not what it seems to be I finally realized that wrong cliché It brings us hope and light to see The right path to head on our way  Use your heart to see reality  That looks might be deceiving  Eyes recognize only outer beauty That is our plight—the fact in living.

      8p 3292k3  Breakaway   Wish I knew the cure  for this kind of sickness I can’t stand the pain,  wanna breakaway from this mess  It’s planted inside of me And its ready to burst out  If pressured and exalted Gonna breakaway too loud  Before this would happen I want it to stop Must find the cure today Gonna break myself away  If only I have an option Then I won’t dare be here If only there’s a solution I’d break away to be clear.  This confession I’d like to make To be free from my mistakes I don’t know if I am to blame But to break away… I feel the same

      12 15a 03162k3  still  you came and lit up my life gave hope and stayed by my side felt safe whenever you’re around the reason for my love to abound  when I need help, you’re always there  with open arms to show you care  you let me feel that I am loved you’re an angel sent from up above  why did you have to go and leave? This question in my mind was conceived When everything now is perfectly fine You went away and left me to whine  It’s different now you’re already gone Give me time to recover and move on I won’t ever forget your memories Because I’m certain I’ll treasure all for keeps  Time may pass though slowly now People may change, I know somehow Lives may end to form the past But your memories are here to last  Your body may be gone  But your spirit lives on You’re still in my heart You’re still the one.

      1a  my solemn death  I’m sick of living this kind of life Always limited… always perfected… Sometimes I would just sit back and cry Wishing to leave this place and die  To look in myself in the mirror and see All the great things they wanted me to be My eyes won’t dry I can’t help but sigh. Hoping to leave this place and die  I’m weak, feeble, with no friends and family Is there anyone who would care and take me? Anywhere… any place… just not close by Coz I’m praying to leave this place and die  Ran out of choices… I’m on the verge of time… I should come up with a decision to change this fucking life Though it may seem wrong… still it’s sublime I have left this place… I am free to die…

      12 15 A 02212k3  maybe  I shouldn’t… I wouldn’t…  But I did… I urged myself to stop this feeling But even got my deeper inning  I tried to look for someone new But all I came to look for is you Afraid my secret would burst out in the open Ashamed, because you are my closest friend.  How would I ever forget this feeling? If everything around reminds me of you If my world spins around reminds me of you If my world spins around your hands, Well, then I have no longer a chance.  Just one stare then I would fall To hear your voice to hear you call My heart would melt and then I’d let A whisper of love be left unsaid.  If ever you will notice I hope you won’t change Coz our friendship I don’t want to ever end And right now I have come to accept That you and I are never meant.  Maybe it is better left unexpressed… Hoping my actions would never manifest. Maybe that’s just our destiny… Coz you and I aren’t meant to be…  Maybe… maybe… maybe…

      8 45p  the nerve  I thought I was over you  But I was wrong I tried to believe I’m okay But that was not for long I fooled myself over that mind-setting  To cover up what I’m really feeling   But the pain still dwells in my heart Can’t you see the damage you’ve done to me? It’s now that I’ve realized—you’re so blunt! But I can’t take you out—away from me.  I can’t accept that you chose her over me, You’re so pathetic I can’t believe you could be So right now, I’m gonna leave you with nothing But misery, pain and pure suffering  Because of the pain you’ve caused me You’re the last one in the world I deserve I’ll forget you, I know, soon I will. So burn your ass in hell--- The Nerve!!!

      8 30p 01282k3  no choice  all eyes are on her  every move she makes afraid she’ll do something wrong in whatever step she’s about to take  she listens to everyone, their criticisms, praise and flattery she tries to live up to their expectations despite the fact she’s not happy  she believes it’s not yet time  to be on her own and live her life maybe she is  still pondering if everything is gonna be alright  how would she know what’s right or wrong  if she is dictated for so long well, its her heart she should follow if she wants it then she should go  but what would really make her happy? The answers, only she would know for at this moment, she’s left with no choice, but to remain silent and have no voice.

The reason why I get myself wrong Thinking that I could be so strong I can’t believe I’m feeling these kinda things It looks like you are being my wings  The reason I’m stuck here in this fucking place Doing what I’m obliged to, no matter what it takes Still giving in and holding on Though it seems like it’s starting to get dawn  The reason there’s rain every time I see her Wishing you would know me but not in blur Trying to be her, but that could not happen That’s why right now I’m holding my pen  Someday, I’ll see myself in your arms  Holding me tight, loving me truly And that someday, I’ll thank this pen For comforting me and for being my friend

      11 50p 01122k3  free  depraved, hurt, exploited, debased since childhood she has always been a slave for other people's sins... gruesome...lurid... grisly history still haunts her in her sharp memory.  she never spoke, even a single word about her sorrow and resentment then she was abused and used causing her mind to burst out open.  all her memories came back to life hurting her badly, killing her from within. she cant stand it she had to fight. and had to stop her pain and strife.  her mind was in clutter she was in deep trouble because of something she did left uncracked and still perplexed.  nevertheless, she thinks she did something right for the first timein her so-called life  happy and proud of what she has done knowing those people were already gone.  from the bondage which looted her, she had already resisted happy she has her liberty on her own again. another prison awaits her but she remains mighty, because she had learned to defend herself already.  be not dictated with what others expect do not fool yourselves and never pretend be not afraid of other people's shadows because behind the form, there is a light which grows.

      1st year hs  the awakening  i hear a voice crying at naight a sound of grief, of hopelessness everytime, at ight, hearing it signals my end  in the morning light, my fear has gone away as long as the sky is here the sky, it's fragrant... the only thing i want it's fulfillment with no contentment i depend on it.  but when the light is replaced by darkness... fear is residing in my body the voice is crying again... it's scaring me!!!  the sun rose... a relief... but... but... i still hear the voice crying again and again... over and over! "who is it?" the crying did not stop... i feel the voice runnng through my veins it has awakened me...  with the chances in life which i wasted, the tears are still in my eyes the pain still burns up inside it's still fresh in my memory.  the voice gave me hope gave me the will to go on to start again... but whose voice is it? is it his... hers... or MINE?  the 2nd poem ive written,... amateurish... but special..

      12 30 02  deadly expectations  "be good stay on top do your best, never flop" these words uttered to her mind planted since her youth, heard til she dies.  envying the common and simple despite her lucky status in life she's ready to jump down and socialize with those different from her advanced style.  some people idolize her, some hate her others like her, few don't know her they say "she's lucky she's always on top." Despite her achievements, still, on the corner of her mind she seeks her true self and asks why she always does things good and right.  she could not find the answers  hearing these words again, "be good, stay on top do your best, never flop." planted in her mind since her youth... heard til now, she dies.
