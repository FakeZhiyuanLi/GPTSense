       Good news.  Currently 5 of my 7 vehicles are running.  I think it is a new record.  And all of those 5 are even plated and everything.  What would be a fun interesting thing to do to the Bronco before it goes to the scrapyard?  I'm up for anything.

       Hello again, updates on me...I went to the doctor yesterday and everything is awesome with me.  Although we talked about it and I can't ride rollercoasters anymore :(  I can however get a tatoo which is the one thing I wanted out of the appointment.  So family that is in on it with me...now you have to think about what you're getting. Betcha didn't think I was going to be able to get one did ya? Oh and if I want I can have one celebratory drink on my 21st birthday but I don't care about that as much as the tatoo. So I'm a happy person right now.  Bye

       Nick requested I post these pics of Alex and Chase, so here they are for your viewing enjoyment!        Also, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to post pictures to this, so if you want to have a picture put up, just e-mail it to me and I'll get it up here for you!

       Check out www.cedarpoint.com to see their new Top Thrill Dragster roller coaster. It's 420 ft. tall. On the left side of the page, go to live park cams. It should be fun to watch when the park opens. I think we should have a family reunion there. Kari

       Woot. After much confusion and hard work on the part of Brittany I am able to post on this here family blog. My life is very fast paced as of right now. I go to school and then straight to practice for the musical which I'm student directing. It's fun but has some long hours. I clock in about 13 hours at school a day. Which isn't bad considering my personal record for straight hours at the school is 17. Staying at school past midnight for the spring play is great fun. School stinks though. It needs to end before I pull my hair out. Meh. Off to the homework.

       Hello! I'm on the blog. News with me is school is still 5 weeks from being done. I don't have much work to do that is tough so that's nice. I did most of the hard stuff in march and now I'm just reworking on the same stuff until the end. For now that's all but I'll keep posting.

       Have no fear, your Cass-i is here! So yeah, uh family...my news consists of, i'm in high school as you know, i don't think my brain can hold any more information, i detest my english teacher, even more so for teaching me that word...i just go around doing random things of randomness and that concludes me. if anything of remote interest happens to me, i'll be sure to post it. the only interesting thing that i have is that my winter percussion thing won state...and that's all i got, we're doing a community night on the 26th, and drum enchanted evening the 3rd week of may. that is all my life has in it right now. so till next time, this is me, signing off. Much love to the family!

       Howdy everyone! Not much new here. Chase is 6 weeks tomorrow and the poor boy is fitting another cold, which the 4 of us seem to be passing around to each other. Nick is working hard in his new position, which he really enjoys. I've started to work from home part-time, which I've found to be much more difficult than I imagined. Especially with a sick infant!! Alex is a great big brother and we're very proud of him.  Congratulations to Cassi, Colin, Cole, Kevin and Brittany!! (Wow! Lots of good news to be celebrated!)  I'm sure the boys and I will be up North for a visit soon. We'll keep those of you up North updated on that!!  Steph

       WELCOME HOME ARIEL from your most excellent adventure! Can't wait to hear all about it.  Although I'm not sure it measures up to our putting the 18,223 layer of paint on the world's largest paintball! We did that yesterday to finish up my Karipalooza weekend. And we also saw the World Rosary of Peace made out of bowling balls. Only in Indiana! Love, Uncle Jim and Aunt Kari

       We had a great time at Family Tattoo day. The crew at Burning Image is wonderful. Two guys came in on their day off to help out. We were the first family to come in. We're going to be featured on their web site. Some young kids were in and Gramma Dena was going back to get hers and one girl yelled "She's getting one?" (the girl's mom wouldn't let her get one). We have some awesome tattoos. Hope we'll be able to get some pictures up. Kari

       Tomorrow is Family Tattoo Day! We have nine going. Gramma Dena is really getting into this. She thought about riding over on Kevin's motorcycle but the helmet messes up her hair! You can still get in on all the fun. We're going at 2 p.m. central.  When we're all healed, we'll put up the pictures. Love, Kari

       Hey everyone! I don't know who's all heard but Cole is moving to Chicago. He got an apartment with a friend from school. He'll only be 15 mins. from Dr. Weigel and Children's.  We will be empty nesters! We now have a wonderful guest room if anyone would like to visit.  Kari

       TATTOO DAY PHOTOS!!  Sadly, the pictures from Kari's camera didn't turn out, so we don't have all the pictures we'd hoped for.    Me in the process of being tattoed!    My finished product.    Cole in progress.    Colin in progress.    Colin's finished product.    Grandma getting hers done.    Grandma and her artist, Baldo.    Jim's finished product.    Kevin's halfway done...    Maggie's finished product.    Laurie freaking out.  Too bad we don't have finished pictures of Kevin's, Cole's, Kari's, Laurie's, Grandma's, and Rachel's, but they're all cool!

       Ariel- I was calling my 50th birthday celebration weekend Karipalooza. Since it was on a Friday, I got a whole weekend to party. Uncle Jim had planned all sorts of stuff and Karipalooza sounded much more fun than 50th birthday. I had already used a fest when I turned 40 (we had fortyfest).  Brittany- We have pictures of the paintball and rosary that a friend had taken from his digital camera and sent to our email.  Can you put them on the Family Blog if I email them to you or do you need it to be on a cd or disk?  Our pictures from tattoo day did not turn out. They all look like they had been taken with a softfocus lens and are all blurry.  We're going to a Nascar race today. Jim got free tickets from work and since it's in Joliet, only about 1 1/2 hrs. from here, we thought we'd go. It should be a great people watching day!  Love to all and hope everyone is having a super summer. Kari & Jim

       Wow - can you believe Cassi and Colin are 17 now!! Yikes. And this Sunday, Cassi leaves for the Indiana State Police career camp. It's just the start of her journey to become a criminal investigator.  I feel so old!!

       Ralf got a job at Blockbuster, so at least one of us now has an income :)  He also gets 5 free rentals a week, so I predict a lot of movie watching in the future.  Also, Ralf and I drove to Anderson a couple days ago so that I could go to Rax and relive childhood memories, but they were closed on Sundays.  How rude!  When I go back I will write a full report.  LOL.
