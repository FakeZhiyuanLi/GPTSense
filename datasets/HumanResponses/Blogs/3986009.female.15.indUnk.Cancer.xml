        I can't believe I was sucked into this...this evilness that I have so long kept at a distance with a stick. *Sigh* anyway, I hope you are happy  James , because this is all your fault. I think this is good enough for now, I'm out.  -Marissa

       In seventh grade, I had to read a short story, it was the best short story I'd read in my life! It's now three years later and I continue my search for the book, and today, O what a glorious day!

       My picture looks really bad, but when you go into my profile, it looks a lot better. Meet Jane, she's the main character of my comic "Plain Jane" If you copy me, I will hunt you down, and rip your arms off. ^_^ You are warned...Anyway, she looks  way  better when hand drawn, but you can kind of get the idea of what she looks like. Maybe someday I'll post my comics up, but they are in black and white, and had drawn (I wouldn't have it any other way!)

       Yea, that last post, just ignore that...it's really just how I was feeling for a few minutes, and it's really intended for only one person, because we were talking about "stuff" the other night.  So if you are not that person, and you have no idea what I mean, just don't read that...ever...again.  Ok, so moving on.

       As you can tell, my blog has now become...pink.  It's what happens when someone keeps me up until 2:30 or so...*cough*Caroline*cough cough* anyway, I think it looks good with the whole Gaz picture over there, and Blogger didn't have any pretty gray ones.  All right moving on, now I can tell you about Thursday-Yesterday!

       I had this nightmare the other night, and when I woke up and got in the shower this kind of popped in my mind, things like this happen when I stay in a hotel without my dreamcatcher. I'm not really a musician, so I don't really have a melody or anything.

        I got bored with messing around with a website, because I have bravenet, and it used to be super easy to use, and now it's all screwy, and I don't get it, sooo I gave up...but I took a million quizes!

        Well, today is the first day where I really have nothing all that great to talk about, I could tell you about my day at work, but would involve effort, and let's face it, I don't like that  effort  deal.
