      I had these ideas for a while now and so I decided to post them... :   "The lone knight stands on the tower watching the gloomy storm clouds in the distance"   "They watched the lone knight travel along the road, never to see him again"   "So after she left him, he traveled alone in the world, never to be with another for the remainder of his life."   ""Behold your king before you", he motioned to the body of their king laying there in eternal peace"  &#169; Roberto Marquez

      This is a work in process.  In order to read what happens afterward, click  urlLink here . I know this seems like a direct rip off of the Bible but keep in mind this is a rough draft and I will go back and modify it to change what exactly happened. I just wanted to get an outline down before I flesh it out.  'The "Life-Bringers", those created by the Creator, finished bringing the last of life to the land and for a time were satisifed as was the Creator.  For a great length of time,  there was a great peace  the Life-Bringers as well as all life living in the Realm.  However, this period of peace did not last as long as hoped by the Creator for a shadow from unknown source.   After the appearance of this darkness, several of the "Life-Bringers" began to talk and complain on how unfair they were being treated and soon begin crying that they deserve rule over the life and realm they created.    However, the Creator refused to surrender saying no one deserved to rule over the realm since all life in the realm were free  without a ruler, though it fell upon deaf ears.   Soon more "Life-Bringers" began to join those whole already beginning to speak of rebellion against the Creator. Soon fighting began amongst the "Life-Bringers" which broke out into an all-out war.  However, the Generals of the "Life-Bringers" were able to quickly to organize an army and fight the Rebellious Ones successfully.  On the verge of defeat, the Rebellious Ones retreated into the Realm before they were forced to surrender.  Upon landing in the "Realm" their forms changed to that of hideous horrible monsters yet the same lust for power and jealousy that forced them into the realm grew greatly.  They began to terrorize all life in the realm even attacking those "Life-Bringers" who had entered the realm before the rebellion and had taken on a form. They had no control over their emotions or actions, only the rage and lust for destruction that filled them when they fought against their fellow "Life-Bringers".  The cries of the life could be heard by the "Life-Bringers" who watched in horror as their creations suffered great pain and feeling this pain, they pleaded to the Creator to do something.  First, "Life-Bringers" were allowed to bring as much of the life on the realm to safety including those later known as the Ancient Clan as well as many others.  This was still not enough though as most of the life did not understand the "messengers" or were too frightened to leave.  Then it was allowed that many "Life-Bringers" could travel to the Realm to fight these Monsters and so they departed entering the realm.  Many of them took the form of the complex yet fragile lifeform of humans.  However, when they awoke from their journey, they were disoriented with no memory of where they had come from nor their purpose in being in the realm and were scattered across the land.   They wandered across the land and soon were by those of the Ancient Clan.  Though confused upon why they did not remember were they came from, they were accepted and allowed refugee in the Great Hall were they stayed for a time as the monsters continued to ravage the land'  &#169; Roberto Marquez

      Here is the some original text I wrote two years ago at LJ that I am placing here for historical reasons.  The Realm of Entelle    Well where to start is the stories that helped me develop what I have thought of so far. As I said in a previous post, I am a huge fan of Tolkien and after rereading several of his works, I have been given many ideas but I am being careful in trying to make my works unique. The actual ideal of the world actually started many years ago about 1998 or 1999 in which I gave the realm the name called Entelle. In order to make it different from Tolkien and many other writers, I decided to make the realm a complete island world with many islands surrounding it and therefore the name in an ancient language is called the Island Realm. I will attempt to write and later add onto the description/names as I am still devising a language system:    The Second Age (Rough Draft)  The Realm of Entelle has been through many changes. The name given, by the those known in legends as the Life Bringers, was the Island Realm as it has many chains of islands. Before becoming under the Destructive Wrath, the Great Land covered almost the entire realm. Four mountains surrounded all sides of the land leaving a large plains/valleys with many beautiful forests though most of it was chopped down by the men who came to live there. It is said because of this, many scars where left behind including desolated lands where no life exists and many marshes due to flooding, the punishment for such destruction.  The Moutains of the North have been named the Cursed as a large evil was known to live there and it is said that in beyond them is the Ice Field as well as the Mist, said to be the source of all evil. A large sacred river seperated the mountains and the Plains. It is said to flow southeastern, disappearing into the mysterious eastern moutains though there are many tribunies that flow from it southward form many lakes and rivers.  The eastern moutains is said where the wise Dragons live along with the people known as the Riders. It is said within the mountains amount of caves, dens where the dragons once dwelled. There are also many halls, home of the Riders of the East, containing the largest amount of information recorded in the entire realm. Said to have remained undamaged even after the invasion of the hall, it was never found until near after the Final Defeat.  Beyond the mountains of the south is a coast where many mariners live. It is said that this is where many of the exiles fled first. After the construction of the first fleet, many sailed away to the other island but few remained behind and built many sea towns that is strung along the coast.  At the time, only one island chain was well known as it became the leading island after the Destructive Wrath to follow. But at the time, it was still in it's younger days.
