      Schilling (11-4 ) vs. Rich Harden (3-5)  It seemed like the A's scored a few more runs each game than they did in the one before it, while Boston scored a bit less. But in the end, Boston sweeps the A's. This was a close game, going to 10 innings. Schilling didn't look so good, giving up three runs and eleven hits in his 5 2/3 innings. Finally, Ortiz hit something, a solo homer, as well as Manny's three run shot. The Sox go to win it in the bottom of the tenth when Damon singled, then scored from first on Mueller's double, two out rally to win the game.

      You probably wouldnt understand the little 8 and the - and the ), but its a smily face with sunglasses. As in, cool. Like it's cool that the sox beat the A's two days in a row, not to mention that they not only beat them, they DESTROYED them. Yeah, it's cool alright.  And for once, the game was actually on television!! NATIONAL television! As a New York resident, I rarely get to see the Sox on tv. Especially WIN on tv. Yankee fans beware!  So yeah, about that game, Martinez, Bos (9-3) vs. Redman, Oak (6-6). First inning, Mark Bellhorn hits a solo homer for the first run of the game, in the second, Garciaparra would hit another solo shot for the 2-0 lead. In the third, Oakland got all of their three runs, but not until Boston rallied with two outs in the second inning for five runs. Manny's error in center field may very well have been the reason that the A's got three runs. After Damon missed a tough bounce off the Monster, Manny kicked it a few more yards, then finally getting it under control. Manny came back however with his beastly homer in the seventh inning, which cleared the Green Monster and soared into the street below, upon returing home, Manny shook hands with people in the audience, I'm sure some disgruntled manager will be whining about that tomorrow. Too bad, final score: Boston Red Sox (45-37) 11, Oakland  A's (46-36) 3.

      Barry Bonds picked up first base as a memento of his latest record, as he trotted down the first base line for the 2,191st time in his career, he broke the record held by Rickey Henderson.  Eric Gagne of the Dodgers finally blew a save, after nearly two years, his record 84 saves beat the previous record by 30, set by Tom Gordon for Boston, April 19, 1998 to June 5, 1999. Worth noting, Gordon is now going to the All Star game as a Yankee.

      The Red Sox will return home to Boston today after their 1 and 5 road trip to New York and Atlanta. They play the A's and the Rangers this week.  Yesterday's game was a killer as a Boston fan, Derek Lowe took the mound and had a comfortable 4-1 lead at the beginning of the 5th inning. But, being people who had seen this happen before, we knew we weren't home free just yet. And, of course, we were right. The Braves scored a total of nine runs in the fifth inning, putting the Sox back 10-4. Oh, and by the way, during this streak of 7 hits, Lowe managed to get only one out. After the fifth inning, the Braves scored no more runs. Neither did the Sox. Manager Terry Francona has talked about taking Lowe out of the rotation completely.  In other Red Sox news, three Sox players made the AL all star team. Manny Ramirez, who was expected to make it, David Ortiz and of course, Curt Schilling.     The New York Mets swept the Yankees in the subway series. Good for the mets.   SCORES FOR 7/4/04   Braves: 10, Red Sox: 4   Expos: 6, Blue Jays: 4   Mets: 6, Yankees: 5   Reds: 5, Indians: 4   Phillies: 5, Orioles: 2   Pirates: 6, Brewers: 2   Rangers: 18, Astros: 3   Cardinals: 2, Mariners: 1   Marlins: 4, Devil Rays: 3   Rockies: 10, Tigers: 8   Padres: 7, Royals: 1   Dodgers: 8, Angels: 6   Athletics: 9, Giants: 6   Diamondbacks: 6, Twins: 2   Cubs: 2, White Sox: 1   Dodgers: 6, Angels: 2

Number Two...MATSUI is overrated...heres the stats people:      Batting average  HR  RBI       .288  16  106
