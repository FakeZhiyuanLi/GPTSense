      Here it is.. the last day of 2003.   Where the hell did my year go? I heard somewhere that time is actually speeding up; that a day is literally shorter than a day 100 years ago. Being the hippie I somewhat am, I believe it has to do with mankind destroying the ozone layer, melting the polar ice caps, creating the greenhouse effect, making nuclear power plants, forcing the indians off thier land, destroying the rainforests...and I would not be suprised if Barney 'the purple dinosaur' was involved. Its a conspiracy!  Well.. at least this year I have a party to go to. Last year I was going to have some people come over but I got a headache I didnt want to deal with people. So it was just me, my cat, a bag of potato chips and Carson Daly. And despite your company, Carson, (for you really are a lovely host... one painted pinkie and all...) not being a loser much appeals to me this fine new years day. I will ring in the new year with Dick VanDyke, fake champagne, my friends and maybe a boa or two. And, until a get myself a car and (more importantly) a drivers license, that is the best I can do.  Marissa and I were discussing how old we feel the other day. I know, I know...15? How old can you possible feel? Well.. do you realize that a kid born in 1998 is 5 yrs old now? Yes...Yes... suprise suprise! I can do math. But think about it. In just ten short years I will be 25. Its even hard to believe I will be sixteen this summer. God... I'm getting all sentimental! Screw it! Give me the future!! YYYYEEEEE HHHAAAAWW

      why... hello, hello, hello, hello! (must read the above with a british accent to get the full affect)  Ahhhh... the jaws of vacation are holding me fast and tight in thier grasp. How is this analogy relevant you ask? Well unlike yesterday... I'll tell you. I have woken up at 2 oclock for the past 3 days. At first I was proud of this fact.... but now it is sincerly depressing me. By the time I am even presentable to the outside world, there are only like 3 hours of daylight left! I need help!I am so taking a sleeping pill tonight at like seven. Maybe I might be able to get up before most people come home from work.  Oh! And despite what Marissa may claim.. her journal is amusing. :)  I officially think Hal Sparks is the funniest man alive. He is as funny as Orlando Bloom is hot.  And that is saying something.

      Marissa and Satpreet have inspired me to start my own blogspot.   Clever idea really...to tell the whole world what I am thinking...because I am sure the whole world wants to hear it.  And if not, they are welcome to place a blindfold over their eyes.               Wait! Better idea....  Hmmm? You wanted to know what it was? Opps, sorry.. not going to tell you. I find that the air of mystery is much more alluring than the air of frankness. Of course, all the air in muskegon stinks because of the papermill.  So hold your nose.

      I have been reading Josh Bourdon's livejournal 'cuz i found it through Reece's. And altough I have never even talk to the kid, and have high suspicions he doesn't even know who the hell I am...all I have to say is that he is pretty damn smart. He said that he is sad because of the lack of love, and the impossibility there of.  Dude... I can relate (and probably can most of my friends). He also said that guys only complain in their journals, which is correct. Anywho, I just wanted to give props.  Props?....umm Katherine, you are white.   'Tis true.  I am mad I missed the basketball game last night (well not really, to tell the truth), I am more upset I missed the benefit concert. That Morgan Stewart girl seemed like she was really good when Mr. Lawton played her cd in choir. I dunno... I just felt kinda of sick. Not sick so much in the physical sense, but just sick of....oh i dunno....nevermind.  I had to give my Self-Intro speech yesterday. I did pretty well, and was only slightly nervous. Ha! I guess those acting classes I took with Laura in 5th grade are paying off...now is the time to reep (is that how you spell it?) the benefits! I got a 95 out of 100 and a 50 outta 50. Still, I hate the sound of my own voice...but doesn't everyone? I think I sound like a little girl. Maybe that just means I'm in touch with my inner child.  My cousin Leah (or, as my grandpa would say with his Jersey accent, 'Leer') burned me a cd of all her favorite Weezer songs. I have always known about Weezer, since I am for some reason drawn to 'Buddy Holly' glasses, and Rivers Como is always sporting them (which, I must say, is pretty dang HOTT!), but have never really heard many of their songs. I like 'What Everyone Wants' or 'American Girls' best, and I used to like 'Holiday in the Sun' until Mary Kate and Ashley tainted it for me (no offense Sarah!). Weezer is an odd name don't ya think? It got me pondering.   I want to sart a band....which will be hard since I have no musical talents and I am not particully inclined to acquire them (though guitar seems fun...but knowing me, my laziness and lack of concentration, chances of me learning are slim and nil.) It would be called 'A Stroke of Genius' and the first smash single's chorus will be 'It always rains or snows in 3rd hour'....   It be a kinda emo-ish, punk-pop sound. Since my plan will never be put into action, I am inviting anyone to take the name, but to just (please) make good music and sing about pocket protectors, Bill Gates and government conspiracies.   Those topics just fit the name don't they?  ...I have SO much homework to do...this will seriously get in the way of my procastinating.....

      In reflection of my last entry, all I can say is this:  Whoa there, Katherine!   Lets all say it together know....hypocrite!  Yes.... I admit I am a hypercrite. A big one.  Below, I state I dislike dramatic people, but yet just by writing that entry on that certain subject I was being dramatic.   In fact... just by my admission of this, I am being dramatic.   I don't know why, I just hate to appear like I want attention. I didn't. I just needed to get all that off my chest.   And, again, I repeat...that was NOT about one certain person... it was about a certain state of mind. My rantings were about the idea that people nowadays take alot of things for granted.   Kids in Cambodia don't have to deal with ADD, anerexia, obesity or family troubles because all that doesn't exsist there. Neither does security, democracy or respect. I'm just trying to fit it in people's small little minds that our situations are all pretty damn good if ya think about it.   I think I was inspired my an episode of Oprah.

      JESUS CHRIST---DOES THE WHOLE WORLD HAVE PMS OR SOMETHING???  No offense to anyone (I admit I hate that saying, because if you say that, odds are you are gonna offend someone) but at the risk of riling some feathers ---- certain people (and by 'certain people' and mean MORE than one) need to take a breather or something. I may be a little optimistic, but I hate when people are dramatic. I look around and hear people complaining.   ....Complaining about their bodies, their boring-ass lifes, their families, their friends and just basically their whole damn situation. Frankly, I am so sick...... completly sick of it.   Can't all of them just open their blind eyes??   You live in AMERICA. The greatest country in THE WHOLE WORLD.  You go to a good, finicially secure, safe school.  You are beautiful.  You are far better off then most people.  And...above all, and most importantly....at least one person, out of all the billions on the globe...loves you.  I know people get in a rut once in a while, and they need to vent, but does everyone really have to drag me down? I sound like a selfish, raving, ranting, lunatic....but this is my venting session.   MY detox.   Those people get to vent, so do I.  All I really hope for is that people can regconize and can see what I do. I am sympathetic, but done.  Completely and utterly done.  I am reading 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Holden Caulfield hates when people are overly dramatic and fake.   I am beginning to relate.

      Welcome....."My little strawberry!" (lol....that one is for you, Jenna!)   Ahhh... While I was watching Buffy today from 4 oclock to 6 oclock (uummm..ya...thats how lame I am...you didn't know that already?), I suddenly realized I absolutely LOVE Spike. In case you don't know, Spike is a very hot, (but unfortunately) very vampire-ish character on the show, with an adorable english accent. And, as most will know, I go crazy when I hear a hot guy speak with a british accent. The wierd thing is I usually do not like 'bad boys' but Spike is the exception.   I do believe I will be watching a lot more episodes since my revelation. Buffy is a very good show....lets call it 'educational'. I have learned many lessons since I tuned it. Such as: 1. Always carry a 'shape pointy stick' with you when walking deserted grave yards at night. 2. Your principal is actually a giant evil snake. 3. Everygirl has a soft spot for hot, english, bleach blonde bad boys. 4. It is very tough to be 'The Key'...or its sister. 5. The government might be making robots disquised as 'slayer' boyfriend material.    And finally: Highschool is a porthole to hell.

      hello to all my readers!  I haven't updated in awhile, I know.  I went to Chicago on Friday to see Hairspray with Carly Jibson in it!(our very own hometown celebrity and MS alumni)  All  I can say is this:    IT FREAKIN KICKED ASS!!!!!  Those four little words are among many (like marvelous, excellent, surburb, exciting, awe-inspring and magnificent) that could describe the awesome perfromance I witnessed on Friday.  I have seen many plays in my lifetime (I can't even begin to count them) but Hairspray above all was the best.   THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!  Where else could you stand up and shake your groove thing at the end?   Not 'Les Miserables', I'll tell ya that much.  I love anything retro.....I just can't help it....this was the perfect play for me. Between the swingin costumes and lingo ('thats afro-tastic!!') and the hot guys (who you could totally tell were gay, but hey, a girl can dream!) I was in my own 60s heaven!  Go to the Hairspary website and tell them Katherine sent you.  Maybe you'll get front row seats!   urlLink

      Jenna....hun,...  You really, REALLY need to learn how to use proper grammer and stuff. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it just seems like you are extremely rushed or something. I know you don't mean to sound that way, but it just does. I still think your blog is funny tho... there is no denying that.  I totally agree with Jenna's vote for me as best liar, although I am mildly mad she has given away my well-kept secret. But....since its out in the open, I might as well tell everyone the excellent recipe for 'lying-and-to-your-parents-and-getting-away-with-it' soup.   The ingredients you will need:  500 pds of Trust (from your parents) ~ If your parents believe you tell the truth all the time, and set a good example, they will not question you decide not to tell the truth~  1 1/2 cup of Good Behavior ~Parents will basically excuse anything if they know you are a 'good kid', but might have 'taken awrong turn'~  3 ounces of Flattery ~It is hard to be mad at someone that is telling you how 'you are the gratest mom in the whole world' and how smart, slim, and talented you are~  4 cups of Bartering ~If chores can get done, maybe they will excuse the thought of groundage from their brains~  Of course, the recipe varies for evryone, but this what works for me!  Chow!

      Yesterday was very eventful.  I went to school, harboring ideas of somehow killing the stupid person who made our school days begin as early as they do, and tried to get through all of the uselessness of algebra unscathed. When school was (thank god!) finally over, I went to Simone's house and hung out while she got her stuff for our journey to Reeths Puffer, cuz we had to cheer there at 7:30. The bus ride to 'Rockets' territory was entertaining since I had applied my good idea of bringing my cd player with the best cd ever (Guster, 'Keep it Together'...I pity if you have not heard them yet) tucked neatly inside.   After the game had ended, (we won, of course!) we cheerleaders were just happy that we could at last sart heading towards home. .....but fate had different plans.  The bus broke down in the Puffer's parking lot. It would not start. AT ALL.  And despit the fact I was being throughly amused by the reckless teenagers doing doughnuts in the empty parking lot now and then, I was getting sick of a certain someone's hyena-like laugh. On top of the fact that we were stranded, the only adult we had on board was the bus driver, Mr. Bob. Now, Mr. Bob was extremely pleasant, and I am just thankful he was not some ex-con murderer. We called Coach O and we managed to get some parents to come out and get us, but not before some of the girls couldn't feel thier toes.   Ah well....it was much more exciting at the time.  I have to go prepare and study for exams (and by that I mean I have to go procrastinate and play 'The Sims'). See ya lata alligator!

      hmmm.. where to start?  Actually, I shouldn't say that. I don't have anything to begin talking about in the first place. All I can really say is how much I hope people don't think I 'm a geek for writing in my blog twice in one day.   'Cuz right now, that is my self image.  I know what your thinking: '.....uummm....do you really care that much?...are you THAT addicting to it?' To answer your questions:  YEAH!  For some odd reason (I have an inkling it might be pride), my blog is the fiirst place I go when I sign on. Even if I don't write it in.....I feel a strange pulling feeling of having to look at it.   People are complimenting me on how fun my blog is to read...which got me thinking...  If it is this easy to entertain people...I should do this for a living someday. It could be that my friends are just incredibly easy to amuse (which is a likely option, since I myself have been captivated by how the clothes spin around-and-around-and-around when I look in my grandma's washermachine's glass door) but I'd like to think not.  See, the only thing I would love to improve upon is my sense of  story-telling. Satpreet tells the greatest stories...full of detail and creativity. I feel the need to put things bluntly, becuase if I don't, I feel as though I'm not being true to myself.... like, awkward, writing about something I have never exprienced. I guess that doesn't make me very imaginative does it?   ......oh well...  Have I ever told you about my philosophy of 'oh well'? No? Well then... I'll start at the beginning.   I adopted my philosophy in about 8th grade, but I have always used it throughout my lifetime. There are many variations of 'oh well's, and I employ them for many different situations.   First, there is the huffy, hurried and forceful 'oh well'.  ~This one gets the most use when I am in a fight with my sister or a friend, and it basically arrives when I just want to stop talking about a certain topic.  Next, there is the realization 'oh well'.  ~When I recieve news that makes me change my mind, or peaks my curiousity, do not be suprised if this type of 'oh well' springs from my lips.  The I-don't-give-a-damn 'oh well' is the one most often in rotation, however. ~All of the 'oh well's have the underlying central theme of not caring, and this one pretty much sums it up.  There are many more species of 'oh well's covering the globe.... maybe in China, swimming in egg drop soup, perhaps ice fishing with eskimos in Alaska, getting a tan in West Palm Beach, or even going for a ferris wheel ride in London.....wherever....the next time you hear an 'oh well', think of me and my faithful philosophy.    I just read this entry over. All I can say is this:   Am I so lame that I have to resort to writing about my imanginary philosophies?  I guess so.         .......oh well....

      Ugh...   You ever feel that way sometimes? Just..... ugh. Right now I am in that present state. Despite how throughly stimulating Info Tech is (can't you just hear my voice dripping with sarcasm?) I am just sitting her waiting for that faithful moment when the bell rings and I increase my change of getting run over by some senior boy, obviously a little too excited to get the frist fries of the day. Which, by the way, I don't believe to be that good that you must run over some little freshman to get to....  AH! the bell rung!    Will someone help me up when Mr. Fry Man runs me down?   .....hahaha... that should be a country song!

      The basketball game was canceled! woo hoo!! I SO did not want to cheer tonite... sometimes, you just don't feel like being peppy...and today was one of those days. Yup...today is more like one of those 'I-think-I'll-just-lay-around-procrastinating-and-watch-tv-till-dinner' days.   Alrighty....voting time. Raise your hand if you're worried about exams!   Yes....I see your hand way back there. I share your apprehensions friend, I do. Especially in the area of choir. I just stopped listening to Mr. Lawton. And when I decided I would be a good student and pay attention, I discovered his voice sounded like the teacher's on Charlie Brown. WA-wa-wa-WAAA-wa  *sigh* I am so lazy.   No, I don't think you even comprehend how incredibly  sluggish Katherine DeVoursney is. An example: last night, I got all snuggly in my bed, ready to go to sleep, and then I realized my room light was still on. Being the resourceful chick I am, I grabbed my stuffed kitty, and attempted to somehow launch the sucker (note: I said STUFFED) at the light switch. Did I really think that by some miracle my GENIUS plan would actually work?  Hell ya I did. Did it really? Hmmm...lets see here...since I sat in my well-lighted bed, in my well-lighted room for like 20 more minutes....I'd say... NOPE. Get the gist? I knew you would.  You are so smart that way.

      ....but you didn't say 'God bless you' when I sneezed!!..... I have concluded that the movie 'Dogma' is the new and improved Bible...with moving pictures! I shall borrow Jenna's word, and describe it as the 'shiz'. Not only is it hilarous, it is enlightening. Having rather radical views of organized religion myself, I can relate to the movie's ideas of faith. For example: I think Jesus was married to Mary Magdalen, he had siblings, and the Bible is gender biased. I don't consider myself spiritual...more of an observer. I am keeping my options open.   On a lighter subject.... New Years Resolutions. I agree with Satpreet on the point of why try to make yourself a better person only once a year, but in the honor of tradition... here is mine: 1. Swear more.  Why is this a resolution of mine, you may ask. Some people may have one to actually swear less (like my sister for example). Well, in my head, I cuss all the time...why not express it verbally? People are always so shocked when I do swear, which is odd (at least to me) because words are just words. However, I absolutely despise when every other word that comes out of one's mouth would be censored on national television.  2. To get kissed by next year. At frist I debated whether or not to put this on my website, for the mere fact that everyone would be able see it. I finally said screw it, who the hell cares? I am pretty sure only my friends even read this, and they probably share the same resolution. It is embarassing that yes, I am 15, and yes, I have not been kissed yet, but neither has anybody I regulary converse with.  God... I am so glad no boys read this... that I know of...  Oh! I have a correction to make. I said I would be watching Dick VanDyke on new years... but I really meant Dick Clark. Of all the Dicks in the world....I get them confused.  Speaking of the name Dick.... there was a man arrested named Richard Head  a while ago. And, as we all know, the nickname for Richard is....? Yup, thats right...Dick.  Dick.....Head.... Dick Head. Wanna guess what he was arrested for? Child molestation. That probably had NOTHING to do with the fact he was most likely teased relentlessly as a child. Geeeezzzz his parents were stupid.   Hey! I just got a letter from this poem publishing thing I entered online, and they want to put my poem in a book. I am pretty sure it is just a rouse to get you to buy the book, but it still cool. I am gonna allow them to publish it none the less, so at least the poor saps that do buy the book can see it.  Wanna see it? Sure ya do...  The Water  The water washes As the sun shines As the grass sways And as the seagull talks. I walk with wind As the sand floats by.  Like it? I am not particulary proud of it.. it could be better... but hey!  And now I must leave you. Please don't cry.. it doesn't flatter your features.  Parting is such sweet sorrow.  Unless the person you are parting from is the person you never wanted to be parted with in the first place.

      Teenage hormones mess with you.  One minute I am so exremely happy...I love my friends, I love my school; everyone and everything is just dandy...and the next minute I am so pissed off I think I want to punch someone. I never go to the side of being depressed...ok, well, rarely... I just get really synical and snippy. Little things annoy me when I am like that.  All teenagers should wear a warning label attached to our heads that changes like a mood ring:  "SAFE TO APPROACH"  "FOR AGES 13+"  "CAUTION: MOODS MAY HAVE SHIFTED DURING GYM CLASS"  "DANGER WILL ROBINSON....DANGER WILL ROBINSON"  This would be beneficial to everyone. No guess work involved.  On a different subject:  Please tell me I am not the only one who believes that the new movie 'The Passion of Christ' is some neo-republican-christian propaganda?  I don't care if people disagree with me... I can't change people's opinions and I don't believe any mortal can. People will think what they think and thats that. Case closed.  But it would be nice to know if anyone shares my opinions. E~mail me.   .....But hey..... enough rambling for today.    SONG OF THE DAY: 'Losing My Religion' R.E.M.

      If you would kindly direct your attention to the middle right of this entry, you will notice I have added a guestbook and chatterbox to this page.   I would love you all to utilize them! :)  Anywho....  I have now determined what is most important in my life right now.   MONEY.  MULAH.  DOUGH.  GREENBACKS.  Many girls would say that their boyfriend was their top priority currently, and I have contemplated this and determined I am through with members of the opposite sex. Money is much more rewarding. With money...you can buy happiness.   Don't argue with me on this one.. you know its true...don't lie to yourself! I have accepted that fact.   From what I have come up with, all love is can be summed up in this phrase:  MARKETING TOOL.  A highly stratigized, highly effective marketing tool invented by the card companies, television and movie producers, and record companies.   My mother argues sometimes I am too synical and literal. Perphaps mommy dearest is right, but some may call me bitter also. I, however, believe I am none of the above. I just believe I found the truth.  I am sure a rare few agree (....Satpreet...Marissa...) but at least the my ideas are out there....   SONG OF THE DAY: 'Quitter'- Gas Giants

      I was reading some of Marissa's old entries and she was talking about how uncultured Americans are.  I concur (borrowing your word there, hun, but it fits.) I mean, have you SEEN the Real World Paris? They get kicked out of a resturant for yelling and got all pissy over it. Um, hello folks... it was rightfully so.   I want to go to Oxford with Marissa when we graduate so we can get the hell outta here while at the same time finding our rich, hot, British husbands that also happen to be some obscure Lord or Duke of 'such-and-such'.   Altough Irish guys are equally appealing...and have much more fun. Drinking, singing...it all goes hand and hand to the blarney of heart.  Its hilarous when Marissa tells stories of her family when they get drunk and go to Docker's (....hey! Its our grandma's birthday too!....), because they are mostly Irish.   Samething with my dad's friend Joe Kelly. He came over one night after "drinking ONLY water" (uummm...surrrre....) at that new chicken wing place out by the mall. He preceded to go on and on about how fanatastic the TVs above the urinals are there...and how the war in Iraq could have been prevented if this type of electronic installment was present in ALL urinals around the globe.   Gotta love that family...Bonnie, Megan, Erin and Sean (how Irish can ya get?)  Half my family is Irish, but we don't have any fun stories to tell. That side is kinda quiet when it comes to our ancestry.   I think it has something to do with the fact that they are from NYC and Jersey...and might have been involved in some secret, undercover Irish mafia.   Actually no, the Irish would be no good at mafia work. They'd all get too lazy  to go kill someone and just take him out for a drink instead!

      Like my new template?  ...'Poetic Flower'....hhmmm...makes me seem more philosophical then I really am....  About this whole scheduling thing....it just gets me all stressed out.   Physical Science or Chemistry? Debate or Advanced Speech? Aerobics or Health? Newspaper or Choir? Spainish or French? Will I cut it in Honors English.....what about in A.P. World Studies? Should I take zero hour? And where am I gonna fit in Bowling if I take it for my gym credit later? Where does those Tostido scoops get their shape? How does jello wiggle like that...?Is it really alive...? If listen to 'Tommy' with a candle burning will I really see my entire future? Why do they always take my Lucky charms? Why doesn't those kids the rabbit some Trix already? I bet he'd leave them alone.  Ok, so maybe those last few questions are irrelevant....  However, I do have some decisions to make.   I love choir(...Jenna and Andrea...what more entertainment do you need?...) but I'm not going to pursue anything musical and I can't go to Brazil so whats the point?   I also want to take zero hour so I won't have to deal with those crazy upper classmen and the pressure of trying to park with all them beeping their horns at me (which will most likely be the case)...  Plus, Debate will look really good on my college application, but what if I decide to do football cheer and it gets in the way?   Ugh.. I need my R.E.M. and milano cookies.  Then maybe I will be sane.

      Happy S.A.D.!   (Single's Awareness Day)  Well, I arrived in Florida expecting to get a tan, feel warm, have the sun shine on my face, and all that lovely shit......but to my surprise..its going to be crappy all weekend! WOO HOO!  The fact that snow doesn't get into my shoes is quite comforting but I am seriously in the middle of nowhere.... surrounded by old people that apprently like to invest in tacky lawn ornaments.  The highlight of my day yesterday was eating alligator (which, according to legend, DOES taste like chicken), and shopping at a Bell's Outlet (a cheap store where the people here like to invest thier social security).   Today was an improvement...I got to swim with manatees! You can go on a boat tour and go scuba diving off of it. I saw tons of the 'sea cows' and even got to pet one. It felt like leather. They like it when you scratch their backs...who doesn't?...so I happily obliged.  Oh! And get this....they have a 'Monkey Island' in the middle of the river. Its this small island where people stuck like 5 monkeys and put some ropes and shelters for them on it. The monkeys are scared of water and can't swim, so they can never get off.   How depressing is that?   My grandpa assured me (after I brought this to everyones attention) that the monkeys get fed 3 meals a day and are 'much better off' than in the wild.   Still.....I wouldn't liked to be held on an island and be turned into a tourist trap.  Ah well...maybe if it was sunny here I wouldn't be so bummed out.  Geez...I'll stop complaining....its Florida!!! Who wouldn't kill to be me right now?   All you up in Michigan do me a favor....do my share of freezing my ass off k? K.

      Everyone beware! There is an internet stalker on the loose!   He goes by the s/n of "beerbongburns50". He goes to Fruitport and gets peoples s/ns off profiles. Jenna and Kayle have talked to him, and so have I...but not so much as talked, as messed with him (which was great fun if I might add).   I am only writing about him because on my aim profile there is a link to this blog, so I figured he can probably (if he was ambitous enough) read it.   I have no intentions of deleting the link just because some odd little boy with too much free time might *gasp* stumble upon a diary of a girl he has never met.   If you did not know me, and you read all my entries, you would gather the impression that am a nerd. I'm not blaming you there burnsie, I would gather that same impression too.   And all I can say is this:  NERD POWER!!!  If I get good grades, have interesting, funny friends who actually know what is happening in the world (and are concerned with it), am involved in school activities, and (god forbid) have a good personality and am labeled a nerd, geek or bookworm, so be it.   So be it.  Because the truth is, if people label me a nerd, (just as I label them slackers, druggies, and sluts) I am comfortable in my position...which is more than I can say for some people. I like who I am, I like my life, and I like what I see for the future.   Nerds, preps, punks, wanna-bes, nobodys, and loners all blend in highschool oblivion when we graduate..... and until then, I'm just going to try and avoid anything I'll have to tell my high-priced shrink about when I'm 40.

      So its official.  Me and Satpreet are starting a band. How do we expect to be successful when we have only 2 members and one can't write songs or play any instruments?   Well, we haven't quite figured out the legistics yet, but we definately have a kick ass band name. 'A Stroke of a Genius'. Yup...we got the name...now we just need the talent.  Actually..... who needs the talent aspect? A lot of famous people coast thru life on their good looks and good managment, and wind up on the covers of movies, cds and magazines. (i.e. the Olsens, Hilary Duff and Frankie Muniz)   Unfortunatly I don't have good looks or good managment so this might be an obstacle.  But to quote a famous 60s black suffrage song...."We shall overcome...."

      I sometimes get tired of dressing up, showering, putting on makeup or basically troubling myself to appear 'presentable' when it doesn't seem to help anyway. I wish I could just throw out all my makeup and my wardrobe and only buy sweatshirts and comfy pants. What I am troubling myself for anyway? I am not attracting any members of the opposite sex...and it doesn't appear that I will be in the immediate future either.   Don't get me wrong...I am not saying a need boyfriend to be happy. Its just that I look around..at school, in the movies, on TV... and 'love' is everywhere. Maybe it is only apparent to those who want it, like a mirage when someone is stranded on a deserted island, but it makes me think: why can't I have that too? I don't want a boyfriend just for the sake of having one... I am beginning to think I want one so that I can prove to myself that love (or the emotion of which) is a pure, solid, real thing.  Because I am starting to have serious doubts.  I mean...what if 'love' is just all hyped up for the movies and tv and the real thing isn't even what you expect it to be.   Like when I see a commercial for Taco Bell.   I think to myself 'Hmmm...that mexican pizza looks good.'  So I go order one..full of anticipation and curiosity...and then bite into it.   Guess what? They aren't especially appetizing.  That is what I am getting at.  What if love isn't what its all cracked up to be?  If thats the case.....  I just might end up going through life all by myself.  .....and I don't like to feel lonely.

      I..........  LOVE.........  WARM........  WEATHER!  Kindly disregard the ugly excuse at writing poetry I exhibited in the entry below. It was made up at a time when I was bored, cold and sick of Michigan. My guess is that a higher power read the dismal crack at being artsy, because he/she/it smiled down on me and said:  "Lets bless that little town where Katherine lives with one...maybe two days....of real, glorious, uplifting sunshine....so she'll stop writing crappy poems...."  I and so it shall be.  And for however long this lasts, I will be in a much better mood.   To quote Jason (THE MAN) Mraz:  "Good day sunshine, I'd like to say how truly bright you are...you don't know me, but I know you, see you're my favorite star..."  I mean... I friggin played GOLF yesterday! I had ICE CREAM!   If that doesn't count as jubliant, unabashed joy......  What does???  Song of the day: "Who Needs Shelter?"- Jason Mraz

      This is the Guster road journal entry that made me and Marissa laugh until we cried....true, it might have been like 9:30 at night...our nerves were shot from a hectic day at school, the homework was winding down, and we were tired...but I think it might have the same effect on you if you let it.      Fri Apr 18 2003  04.18.03 -- houston tx   Of all the cities I'll miss visiting when my drumming days are through, I'll miss Houston Texas the least. I mean this, of course, in the "best possible way." Here was tonight's situation... I was in Houston, I was hungry, and it was 11:30 pm. Discuss.   It doesn't seem like such a desperate set of circumstances, but we have very little mobility on the road. Our bus is always anchored where it is, I wouldn't know how to drive it if I were even allowed to, and we can rarely get Michael to pull over at Wattaburger or anywhere else when we leave at two in the morning for the next town.   The Hickory Hollow BBQ place where we ate lunch was closed, so I went into a bar called Cosmos Cafe and asked if they were still serving food. They weren't. I asked where I might find something to eat in the neighborhood and learned there was a Jack In The Box up Washington Street a ways. Is it within walking distance? This question stumped them. Who would ever walk somewhere in Houston?   I would. I walked a goddam mile and a half with my shirt stuck to my back and sweat rolling off my forehead until I found the Jack In The Box, and when I got there the door was locked. They closed at 11, so my only hope was the 24 hour drive thru. But I wasn't in a car. And so I did the thing that many of us have done at some point in our lives... I pretended I was a car. I inched my way along the drive-thru line between two pick-up trucks until I got to the menu.   I decided I would have two Jumbo Jacks and two chicken sandwiches. I was "hungry" and I'd just walked a long way in the humidity. I said hello to the speaker and the speaker said nothing to me. What the fuck? I kicked it, because that oughtta get their attention.   Nothing.   Sensing that the pick-up truck with the gun rack behind me was growing impatient, I decided to continue up the line to the window to actually talk to a human. A few minutes later I got there and a woman with a Jack In The Box hat and headset rolled her eyes at me and said "sorry, no walk-ups." Wait a minute. Walk-ups? There's a fucking name for people like me? This pretending-you're-a-car phenomenon has a name!? I tried to make this woman understand... I'd walked for a half an hour past barbwire-enclosed car dealerships with doberman pinchers barking at me the whole way, just to come to this very Jack In The Box so I could spend my four dollars on four meat and mayonnaise sandwiches. My money's no good here just because I'm on foot!?   She closed the window on me. I fucking loved when she did that. I had no choice but to plead with the cars in line behind me to let me tack on a few sandwiches to their orders. I was determined. But no one even rolled down their window for me. In fact some of them rolled their windows up as I approached. Even after I showed them my money and everything. They must have thought I was nuts. True, I was sweaty, angry, and my shirt was missing a few buttons so I may have been showing some nipple. But come on Houston. Have a heart.   I spent the long walk back to the bus wondering what I would do if I were in a car and a walk-upper approached me. I know what I'd do now.   Back on the bus I found some bread and cheese and a George Foreman grill to make me happy.  Song of the Day: "The First Baptist Bar and Grill"-- The Bob&Tom Show

      I'm no Satpreet...but I wrote a poem the other day when I was in a kind of mood:  'Grey'  Most inspired when the snow is falling. Before dinner Before dark But after the light. The 'inbetween'.  I look out the window then And I try to follow the flake with my eyes All the way down.  But they fall to fast.  My eyes are left behind.  It's about time they caught up with the rest of my body.  And isn't it odd? When the falling begins I shudder.  And isn't it odd? When it stops I'm abandoned.  But its ok...I'm used to it. Since the trees are bare I can be grey.  And I can be tired And scared And sick of my imperfections.  However... It's nice to see things have purpose When I'm not quite sure of mine.  And it's nice to know that some things make sense.  And it's nice to know that others don't.  I can see the world as 'beautiful' Or at least against the backdrop of me wandering.  Or at least to find something To follow it  With my eyes.  But I bet I'll be too slow And what I search for... What I watch for... Will slip and fall.  Maybe one day I'll catch it on my tongue.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  An after thought:  I talked to my grandparents on the phone, and I was thinking about something I said.  Grandma: So...hows your love life? Me: Non-existant. Grandma: Thats not true, I bet you have tons of good looking guys. Me: Yeah......imanginary ones.

      HAPPY ST. PATRICKS DAY!  Ahhh...the day of drunkeness has finally arrived....  I overheard someone talking today who said (and I quote) "St. Patrick's Day is over-commercialized."   St. Patricks Day over-commercialized?  St. Valentine's Day?  Yes.  Halloween?  Yes.  Christmas?  Hell yes.  But Good 'ole St. Patty's Day?  Nah.   I have concluded that this particular day is not over-commercialized because of one thing:  There is no 'St. Patty's Day Sale' at ArtVan.  ArtVan has a 'Presidents Day Sale', 'Easter Sale', '23rd Anniversary Sale' (23 years? Big whoop...), AND a 'Low Interest, Low Payment, No Icome Tax until the Year 2078' Sale....but dear Pat is just left out in the cold.  You can determined how over-commercialized a certain holiday is just by watching the ArtVan commercials. For example: Christmas is the most overexposed holiday, concluding that ArtVan's commercials for their 'Holiday Season (....by saying Christmas would be politically incorrect..) Sale' seems like it sarts to air in October.  Anyways.... I must journey forth and do my English homework.  TTTTAAAAALLLYYY HHHOOOOO!

      As you may have noticed, I have changed my template....again! This blog has become the 'parade of templates'.  ::...gotta change things up....gotta keep 'em fresh.....::  It seems like a long time since I have sat down and typed in a good mood. I think its because it was such a nice day. The weather can affect everything.  Why do people always say that when no one has anything else to talk about, they resort to talking about the weather? I think the weather is the universal conversation starter. Even a blind man can tell you what the weather is like outside.   When the weather is crappy.... I feel crappy.  When the weather is sunny..... I feel cheery.  And so on and so forth.  ..........................HOW I LONG FOR SPRING BREAK!!!............................

      WHOA  I think this is the longest I've ever gone without posting.   The reason for that is probably the one I use most often...  I am extremely lazy.  I know... I know.... sitting in front of an electronic device having to press little black buttons in a particular sequence to convey a message may only SEEM easy to some...but to the vast and growing majority of the American people that would rather sit on the couch and watch an infommercial instead of getting up and finding the remote.....or (god forbid) actually change the channel manually....the whole having to come up with a logical and coherant entry has proven more difficult.  I just made that whole last paragraph one sentence. One big, long, run-on sentence.   I have had a semi-interesting week.   1.) Signed up for golf team.  2.) Cheer pictures. 3.) Discussion Speech. 4.) Worked the fish fry with Marissa. 5.) Subsaquently messed the crap out of Marissa's blog. 6.) Wasted a whole Saturday night cheering for Shores at Grand Haven with only three other cheerleaders because the rest of the squad didn't show up.  The fish fry was fun....except for the old people. For an explanation, I can only urge you to view Marissa's blog.  Ah well....  Its 1:24pm and I am going to go take a shower now.  Aren't the weekends just WONDERFUL????

      I am just updating because I feel obligated.  Why?.......... Now there is a question I can't answer.  I haven't even decided on a subject to talk about yet.   Lets see here....*scratches head, knowing full well that it makes you appear like you are thinking...when really you are procrastinating*...  The only news I really have is that every single Mona Shores choir that went to Festival got straight ones. That means that we get to skip a day of school to compete at State. Which is always nice.  The Spring concert today showed me how great Mr. Lawton is. Sure...he can be a little flaboyant sometimes, and if he didn't have a wife and 3 kids I'd have serious questions about his sexual orintation...but he is one damn good teacher.  After watching all the higher leveled choirs perform today...I have to say it kinda depressed me.   It made me think...why can't I be good at that? Why can't I have something that interesting to say I am good at and am proud of?   I am not really good at anything.  I can't sing, I can't act, I can't dance, I can't play sports, I can't tell stories or jokes well, I'm not labeled 'hott', I am not coridanated, I suck at driving, I am not artistic, I am only a good student leaning on the side of average, I have little fashion sense, and I am lazy. I have no idea what I want to be when I grow up.    Basically all I know is that you have just wasted about 30 seconds of your life reading about all the things I can't do.   THAT, and I am a orange piglet with yellow dots and light blue lipstick.  Song of the Day: 'The Sweater Song'- Weezer

      When I heard about Mr. Bush (yes, that's right.. 'Mister'... because I believe he does NOT have the diginity to be addressed as 'President') proprosed an admendment to the constition making gay marriage illegal I was outraged.   Completely OUTRAGED.  All I could think about was my mom's friend David; who is gay. He has rights. He is a human being. He found his boyfriend's body when he died of AIDS. A person he LOVED. He has been through more troubles in his life to stay true to himself than I bet a majority of us ever will.   All Bush is doing is imposing his beliefs where they don't belong. I have stated before that I can't change people's minds...and that is true. I do not profess to know everything...however, I do seem to be more cultured, tolerant, and informed than others *cough...Bush...cough*.  Why can't this country be more accepting? If someone wants to show thier love for another person by marring them... why should anyone take that right away? Why can't we be happy that two people are in love? Love is what makes this world a tolerable place. If we take that away, what will be left?  Song of the day: 'A Change Would Do You Good'- Sheryl Crow

      I have not (as I am sure you are aware) updated in awhile.  But there hasn't been much to update about.  Let's see here.... got a haircut....hate block scheduling...but only on the days I have english, math and science in a row.... read Tracy Lorenz's article.... played golf today with Kayle....watched survivor last night....been groovin' on an imaginary Hawaiin rollercoaster ride..... aannnNnNnNnnNNndd thats about it.

The syllables will always make my feet leave the ground, defying the law of gravity; just because you said them. The word that I will associate with being both scary and exhilarating at the same time. When it is spoken, my thoughts will always drift back to you.   Your smile, your bright eyes, the cute dimple on your cheek.... the one I want so much to place my finger upon, if only I just got close enough.   But like other things, you are too far away.   Why can't I muster the nerve to break down the barrier that I have build so high in my mind; the one as strong as steel, while still as fragile as a spider's web?  I admit I do know why...   It is because I'm just more comfortable in the background.   I can't put myself out there..... where ever 'there' may be.  All I content myself with is that one word.   I nibble at it.... savoring each little speck that rolls off my tongue. I'm careful to make the flavor last, so I won't be jaded the next time I hear it. Which is not often; so when my ears are tickled with the pleasant sound vibrations directed towards me, I am all the more satisfied.  And all the more thinking of you.  ******  Song of the Day: 'Sleep With All the Lights On'- Dashboard Confessional

      I have succumb to Marissa's mind controlling powers... I changed my template. I particularly like this one because it reminds me of a big city, while still being simple and a bit retro.   Laura....must you go to Chicago and leave me stranded here?   Ever since I went there in February and changed planes at Midway Airport over spring break, I have had a longing to go there.   On the subject of the Windy City: Bill won The Apprentice, and he now gets to build a huge hotel for Donald Trump there.   Another one of my mother's conspiracy theories: Amorossa sabotaged Kwame so he would lose.  I think I am the only one of my friends to watch that show.  But thats cool.....I can rant and rave about it while everyone wonders what I am talking about.  Everyone needs a person like that.......     and guess what guys!     Thats me.

      "Ok class: If you haven't started putting in your information into your outline yet, and are still looking for articles, you are hopelessly behind."  So, Mrs. Boyden, that was just a polite way to tell me I'm screwed??  Yes,yes....I see through your sharade....  I've come to the point where I just don't care anymore about school.   Screw my speech to inform.  Screw Julius Caeser.  Screw animal classifications.  Screw MEAP math problems.  The only subject I like is American History.  With the past, you don't have to question. What is done, is done. It is all set in stone. That is what I like about it....no thinking outside the box....which is what I always have a hard time with.   Not to say that I'm going to let my grades sag.....oh no....I'm too obsessed with getting into college to let that happen.   By the way... why am I that obsessed about it?   I've forgotten.  Good job? Good money? Good social standing?   Was it all of those reasons? None? Maybe one I haven't named yet...or have yet to place my finger upon?  That is probably it: I just haven't decided yet......  This situation happens to me often.    Song of the Day:'Keep it Together'- Guster

      This just in:  ........ME!.....  Yes, I have returned to the land of overweight, sweatsuit-wearing, 'rat-tails-are-the-new-mullet' people, all wedged in the  barren land (spare a few harsh, neon-ified buildings; i.e.: Meijiers, the Seaway Motel, Comerica Bank) known as Muskegon.  This is what Eve must have felt like when forced to vacate the Garden of Eden's premises.  Only.... my Eden was a placed called Naples.  Naples, FLORIDA to be exact.  Now, some may say that visiting your grandparents for Spring Break might not be cool....but you can bet that the ones uttering those words would be trapped in Michigan, and have surely never met my grandparents.   After all, anywhere away from Muskegon, especially with a tropical climate would be a haven for me... hell.... give me Haiti! (All that political turmoil could go on around me....what do I care?....so long as I am curled up with my good book, a safe distance away from the rioting...perhaps perched a-top a palm tree)  I don't know how I can possibly contain myself now that I have gotten a taste of sunshine, suntan oil, and coconut perfume.

      It seems lately I have been lagging with my posts. But since I leave for Florida tomorrow, I figured I should give my readers  (...all two of you...) a farewell-for-the-week address.  Actually...its not so much as an address as it is a rambling.  I think Satpreet has passed her writers block onto me. Maybe its like a cold (writers block, that is): it just travels around person to person.   ho hum....  Why do I have to be such a procastinator??  Its 9:30 and I still have to pack.  I need something to occupy me....I need to find my niche in life.... Can I borrow someone's?  Also...this entry is going all ADD on me.  Random thoughts running through my crazy mind: ~ I need to read those two books mom gave me. 'Waiting for Snow in Havanna' and 'Second Glance'. I have been considerably behind in my reading, but I did finish 'The Catcher in the Rye'.  ~ Houldin Caulfield is possibly the best character ever. ~ Seth Cohan on the OC is second place. ~ Wait...no...its a tie... ~ The blog I found today is really interesting....it again makes me realize how much more I need to learn. ~ Jack Johnson's voice is soothing. ~ I bet Kelly is freaking out right now at 'The Secret Window'. ~ Note to self: Try to overcome the fog known as writers block....Lists are BORING.  I suppose that is it.  I sincerly wish everyone a happy, sunny, liberating Spring Break!   Song of the Day: 'Taylor'- Jack Johnson

       To be on your own, With no direction home   JesusMaryandJoseph...  I cannot possibly wait one more insignificant miniscule second until summer!!!!  Bob Dylan, you keep posing this question to me, so I must answer.  'How does it feel?'  How does it feel to be so close to the end of school, the end of homework, the end of demented english teachers, the end of waking up early, the end of deadlines, assignments, and tests?  Well, to be perfectly blunt:  IT FEELS PRETTY GODDAMN WONDEFUL!  In the summer, I don't have to see people I don't want to. I can just make up excuses...or ignore them all together.  I can go to the beach.  OoOoOoOoOo THE BEACH!  I do not care if I have to go all by myself. I am getting my non-exsistant ass to the beach at every possible opportunity.  I can read frivolous books, because I can deem them 'Good Summer Books'. The type of books I am refering to are, of course, the ones that have no educational or nutritional value, but are delicious non the less. The 'Krispy-Kremes' of the paperback world, if you will.  Maybe I'll even get a job.  Three ideal working conditions: 1. The new Independent/Foreign Film Theatre (slash) cafe. 2. The library. 3. Barnes & Noble.  Ah, minimum wage... I can smell your alluring scent slipping through my open window now.  Also, (and this is just an option here people) campaign for Nader.  Get Bush the fucking hell out.   (Awww wasn't that sweet?)

       Seconds pass slowly, and years go flying by   I went to Barnes & Noble with Jill today, and I just love that place.   I am such a geek.  Anyway, we got some frappacinos and just sat and talked for a while. Mostly about the catholic religion, its flaws, and so on. But what I really loved was just the freedom of hopping in a car and going some place just because I could (and the fact that Jill has a license). God, that just made me want to get my license so bad.  Geez this weather sucks. Its Memorial Day Weekend! Where are 'ya, sun?  I also got to see Shrek 2 last night. That is officially the best kid movie (...yup, I know you saw it coming...) EVER! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.  Song of the Day: 'Jackson Cannery'- Ben Folds Five

       Ob la di   I love these new templates by blogger! Except I don't know how to get a picture for my profile, so Marissa, you are gonna have to help me out this weekend or something.  If you are not to busy with volleyball, that is.  Satpreet, I am heartily in favor of starting a Liberal Support Group. Just think, my great idea would be the first in the country (that I know of!), and we can voice our 'liberal' ideas in safety. Not that we weren't safe before, (after all, what harm could those evil republicans do to the mighty liberals? ok... beat us in the presidential election, but hey...) its just that now, we have 'support'. Which just makes it sound important. Like Alcoholics Anonymus.  *Stands up*  Hi, my name is Katherine, and in this country over run with conservative conspiracys, I am proud to be a Liberal.  *Group Claps*  Hi Katherine, and welcome. We join together here today to shout our liberal voices loud, so much so that Presdient Bush will become deaf, and our noble ways will triumph!!  *Bon fire dance commences, ritual animal scarifices are committed, scattered praying to the heathen gods are seen, and howlings at the moon are heard*  *Gets up from drinking the blood of a chicken* Golly-gee-gosh guys, that sure was a fun time! See ya next Thursday! I'll see you, Bob, in 4th period!  *Looks up from watching the orgy* See ya, Katherine! Oh, and can you bring the refreshments next time?

       I'm jaded... I hate it   Here's the situation:  Guys do not notice me. I get that. Point taken.   But why not?  I figure I must be some homely, mousey mess for no one to look at me. But then I wonder if that's really the problem here. I mean, I have seen some pretty ugly ducklings that have someone to hold their hand. So maybe it is just my personality.    True, I do not really have any talents.  True, I am not really all that motivated.  True, I can be a bit blonde sometimes.  So I guess I can see what people are happy not missing.  All I am trying to say is that I suppose I know what the problem is...  Its just *sigh* frustrating.  Will all you do me a favor??  I would greatly appreciate it if someone would comment on here I tell be what the heck is wrong with me.  Do I have bad breath? Am I ugly? Am I a liar? Am I a fake? Do I have a horrible personality?  Maybe its just the teenage insecurities talking here, but I really want to know. You can even post it anonymously if you like. That way, you can dish it all out on me and not worry about I think about you.  **** Song of the Day: 'Love Song for No One'- John Mayer

       We can dance to the radio station that plays in our teeth   Computers are frustrating.  EXTREMELY frustrating.  I can not figure out how to put one little measly picture on my profile. While all my friends have cute visual aids... I am left out in the cold.  Both Simone AND Marissa have tried to help me with the predicament, but when they start talking all computer-ish my brain shuts down. Believe me, I don't want it to. I know that I should be comprehending it. I keep telling myself "Listen up here, Katherine!! This is useful! C'mon.... Don't nod off!!!!". And yet... What ends up happening?? My brain just starts to melt and the little red button labeled "WTF??" starts blinking.   Much the same with Math.  But the truth is, I seriously and hopelessly do not get computers, their codes, their files, their accessories, and ESPECIALLY their need to bombard me with pop-ups. An example:  I want an I-Pod. What can I say? I am a victim of good advertising. Those shadowy figures dancing around to catchy (almost hypnotically so) music is something I just cannot resist. But here's my deal: I do not know how the freakin' things work. I get that they play music without cds, that they can hold hundreds of songs, and they are really expensive, but I do not know how to download whatever it wants me to. Even if I did, I can pretty much guarantee I'd screw it up. The only way I will ever figure it out is if I ever come in contact with someone who (by some miracle) has this (and can properly use it) handy device, and they can show me how easy it is to work, and then make fun of me for my ignorance *ala* Saturday Night Live Jimmy Fallon-annoying-office-computer-guy style.  Another example:  I want a digital camera. Since I am turning 16 in July, I have a very high chance of receiving one, because I keep reminding my father that some kids get a car for their sweet sixteenth (plus the fact that he is whipped). However, I want the kind of camera that you can buy a printer for and you don't need a computer to print the pics off. Yes, I am so desperate to not interact with my computer that I will go to extremes to not deal with it.   But I should probally stop talking bad about my computer, since it is most likely monitoring everything I type, just waiting to attack.  Now I will have to stroke it and whisper sweet nothings in its speaker, just so it won't freeze.  ****  Song of the Day: 'Light Up My Room'- Bare Naked Ladies

       I see that there is evil, And I know that there is good, And the in-betweens I never understood   Ok, there is a subject I need to address. Religion (*gasp*). I feel the need to explain things, if only to get something off my chest.  I do not know why, but I have never had deep spiritual feelings. I do not know if it was because I was raised Catholic, the fact I may have trust issues (?), or I can't seem to believe in something I do not know for certain is there. Even when I was little, I always hated church. I hated the way it was so formal, cold, and forbidding. Maybe I am the only one to ever think of church that way, but I can't change it. That is what I see it as.   If I do go to church nowadays, it is because I am forced to. I have tried resistance, but it failed miserably. I just decided "Well, what the heck? It can't kill me. It can only make me uncomfortable for an hour. Plus, this is the only way my family will shut up and drop it."  I sit there, doing my best to annoy the crap out of my sister (by saying things like: "Oooo... I want a slurpee!!!!" really, really, loud), disagreeing with almost everything the priest says, and staring at all the people who are pretending to look interested.  The thing is, I cannot wrap my brain around the idea that there is only one true thing to believe in, and that there is only one right religion. There are thousands of religions in this world, and many are much older than Christianity. Religion trys to answer the unknown questions ("Why are we here?" "What is the right thing to do?" "What happens after death?"), but I am not quite sure if those questions are meant to be answered.   Me? I believe that if you lead a decent, honest, full-filling life, and don't commit any horrendous crimes (murder, having an affair, knowingly destroying the environment, or going over the mandatory speed limit of 25mph in Roosevelt Park), you will be rewarded when you die. I do not know with what, how, or where, but I am certain something good will happen. If you live a life full of corruption, you will be punished. I do not whole-heartily believe in Heaven or Hell. I just think that if you go through life loving, giving and being appreciative, everything will be okay.   Maybe I am naive, maybe I am confused, maybe I have got it all wrong. Maybe I will end up burning in hell for all eternity, surrounded by evil b-list actors (Aaahh!! Michael Landon! Nooooo!!) .... who knows?  All I can be sure of is myself. I am not saying there is no 'higher power'. There defiantly is, and between all my stubbed toes, cuts and bumps I have been getting lately, I am not entirely sure He/She/It likes me. Afterall, someone needs to be reaponsible for our welfare (THAT and someone needs to be in charge of smiting).  I do not know if anyone can relate, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.  *****  Song of the Day: 'Philosophy'- Ben Folds Five

       I'm not sleepy, and there is no place I'm going to   Today was officially the last Wednesday of school. Lets say it all at once now, at the count of 3.  1....2...3...:  YIPEE!  I have huge amounts of homework (almost reaching critical mass), but the thought of school getting out in less then a week is keeping me (somewhat) stable and alive.  While I was walking back to my locker after school, I saw a boy (I am not going to say his name, since I do not want to get in trouble for my light-hearted mockery) who appears to be growing side burns.   Now, normally, I would be supportive of this venture, since many know about my affainity for side burns and buddy holly glasses, but in this case, all I can say is this:  'Dear Lord, Man! Why the hell are pubes stuck to your cheeks?? Did you forget to look in the mirror for this past MONTH? Did your mother drop you on your head while you were a child.... numerous times? Growing side burns is an art form! How dare you desecrate this sacred practice? It takes skill, and only certain guys can get away with it. You, my dear sir, are not one of them!'  If I had any kind of balls, I would have grabbed him by the shoulders and shaken him, while screaming my insanities in his face.  But, alas...   I do not.

         The horizon has been defeated        I  love  summer.      (Just in case someone had slipped through the cracks and didn't know this.)      Highlights of my week:      Wednesday- Went to the beach with Debra and Tessa. No run-ins with Mr.Expose Myself. Unfortunate run-ins with druggies who are supposedly on tethers. For dinner, Station with the Mom.       Thursday- Went to Jenna's, attempted to eat all of her food. Favored the cheese puffs especially. To demonstrate this point, drew stick figure holding giant cheese puff on driveway with chalk, which proclaimed:  "I loves me my cheetos!"  .        Friday- Went to Lauren's (aka Andy the Egg Head, or at least according to Debra) to watch movies. After  My Best Friend's Wedding , so-journed to Debra's, watched Danielle, ate dinner, and went to 7/11. Not to mention hot tubbed.      Yes, that was my past 3 days. What's planned for today?         Get Kayle's present     Quench craving for Dominoes buffalo wings     It may be a short list, but at least its organized.

       Here  I  stand    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Today is my mom's  birthday  . We're going to Lakeside Inn (or some name equally West Michigan-ish) for dinner. It shall be fun, what with all my inquirys on wether or not my grandparents watched the Democratic&nbsp;National Convention last night. My guess is  no . Is it just me, or do all old people seem to be&nbsp;Republicans?&nbsp;Does some  morbid  transformation or&nbsp;trans-continental  brain washing  occur&nbsp;to make this so? Is this an example of&nbsp;their acquired wisdom, or&nbsp;of them slowly growing  senile ?     But since I am young,&nbsp;do not require the assistance of a hearing aid or fiber tablets, I watched the convention last night. I&nbsp;must say,  Clinton  is one of the  best  speakers I have ever heard.&nbsp;I never really watched him speak, since when he was in office, I was in elementary and was a little to busy following the Spice Girls instead of national politics. Kerry may be a bore, but Edwards can make up the charisma for the both of them. Also, has anyone ever watched that 'CBN' news network on Fox Family thats on really late at night? Its  disgusting . Its like a cross between republican propaganda and the religion channel. Last night, they were discussing "why-do-democrats-hate-bush-so-much". Well, Mister 'I-am-posing-as-a-reliable-news-reporter-but-I-am-actaully-a-christian-republican-gooney', I am no expert, but maybe its because of the downfall in the economy, healthcare, education, and most importantly (and most glarily) the serious situations&nbsp;in international relations. Mmm.. yah. That  might  be it. And for the record, I do not  hate  Bush. He might even be a nice person (though that subject could be fiercely debated.) But as a president, Bush kinda sucks.     &nbsp;   Kinda ?    &nbsp;  Katherine, who are you trying to kid?     &nbsp;  He  really  sucks.    &nbsp;

      Whew  I haven't updated in a long time!  The odd thing is, I really haven't been doing much. On Friday I went to Stas's party, which was fun. Especially the part where I put on Stas's bra, stuffed it, wore her high heels, and pretended to be a hooker/hooters girl/ Hef's 8th girlfriend. Also, I got a haircut. It is a little bit shorter than I would prefer, but my bangs are cute. I wanted it like Ashlee Simpson, even though I can't stand her. I just can't respect someone who doesn't write their own songs (however much I like thier hair).  What else? Oh... thats right... My birthday is tomorrow!  I am getting this http://www.restorationhardware.com/page.jhtml?type=product&id=prod2220033&categoryId=cat290015 from my mom.  (If that didn't turn out to be a link, I am gonna be really pissed. Blogger is being a dumbass and made all the icons for bolding, italicizing, block-quoting, and linking disappear. Needless to say, I am not too pleased.)  My birthday party is on Saturday, and I am really excited! I made it 50s themed, because A) the cute 50s invites at Great Party were on sale, B) I wanted a theme, but couldn't make up my mind, and C) I just love the 50s, as many know. It shall be fun.  It is officially past midnight, so that means it is officially my birthday. That means: I am officially 16.  Odd how I don't feel like it.  But its nice to say.  "I'm 16!"  Yes, has a mighty nice ring to it. One more time.  "I'm 16!"  Ahhh... sounds like sweet tinkling bells.

      Quite contrary to what I was jabbering on about in my last post, I am very happy now. I don't even know why. I am just relaxed, calm and mellow. I feel great. I think its becuase of summer. I love summer.   Sun tan lotion, slurpees and dangerous fire torches lit by Sarah.  It is just the best.  We were talking about the Brendan Leonard Show. That show was the SHIT. I loved it. (Why do I keep using the word love? Maybe I just LOVE that word)  Does anyone remember Kevin Carlson? He was hizz-ott!

      I am bored, so I feel like writing, but I don't know what about. In most blogs or livejournals, people just talk about what they did, or who they hung out with.   However, I don't read those type of internet diaries.   I read the ones with substance.   Like Satpreet's or Marissa's.  But get this: BOTH of their computers are broke and therefore I am stranded without any fun journals to read. OR comments on my blog.   Because thats who commented: Satpreet and Marissa.  Those were happy times.  What? America too dependant on technology?  Nah.   And even though I am going to list what I have to do tonight, that does not mean this blog has no substance, OR that I cadone those that lack it. It just means I am bored and have nothing to talk about.  So, here goes:  1. Get Anastasia's present 2. Go to drug store: get Shampoo, Conditioner  3. Eat dinna 4. Go see Anchorman with Debra (pry around 8 or 9)  I know, I know, I just melted your mind with all that lameness, but as you should know by now, I am lame.  Lame....  hhmmm..

          As of right now, there is exactly 11 days until my 16th birthday. But in 3 minutes, there will be 10. That's because it is currently 11:57 pm.   Okay, now there is 2 minutes.  I watched 'When Harry Met Sally' for the first time tonight. I deem it my new favorite love movie. Whenever I see a really good love movie, it becomes my new favorite. I change my mind often, so savor this.  Midnight! Its official: 10 days left.  It is so strange. When you are young, you look at the age of 16 as way off in the distance. You think of cars, boyfriends, and jobs. Ironically, I have none of these. But I have come to the realization, I do not care anymore.   On the car issue: I am lazy, so I didn't get my permit certified until June. Now the earliest I can get my license is December. But as of right now, I get driven everywhere, I don't have to pay for gas, and I don't have to worry if I am going to get pulled over by a cop. So life is good. What is there to complain about?  Boyfriend issue (or lack thereof): When I think of love *slash* boyfriends *slash* my-insignificant-need-to-have-a-supportive-male-presence-around-to-dish-out-meaningless-compliments-to-soothe-my-esteem, I go through stages. Stage one: Not caring. Stage two: Starting to care but pretending like I don't. Stage three: Really caring, and not hiding it. (For an example, see my blog entry from June 22) Stage four: Low self esteem. (Again, see that entry) Stage five: Not caring.  I bounce back and forth through this stages, and for a better explanation of the 'Not Caring' parts, I give you this: Sometimes, I get sick of what I look like, I get sick of trying, and most of all I get sick of my getting sick.    To quote Fat Bastard, "Its a viscous cycle."  And finally, the job issue: My dad, he is whipped. Soft. One of those guys that can't say no.   Generous .   'Nuff said.  But all-in-all, 16 is a good age. Two years from voting (WOO.. go NADER), five from drinking. 16, 2, and 5. All round numbers.   Wait.. No... not 5.   But it should be, its right there between zero and ten.  ****  Harry: There are two kinds of women: high maintenance and low maintenance.  Sally: Which one am I?  Harry: You're the worst kind. You're high maintenance but you think you're low maintenance.

       If I could frame my mind where would it hang?   Last night was fun. Good times, good times. (Wasn't that a 70s sitcom? hmmm)  Lyndsay's birthday party was great... even though Kayleen did throw me in the pool (along with Laura's help). Swimming in your clothes is kinda fun actually. C'mon, ya gotta admit that.   I came home at sat up reading until 3 in the morning. Thats most likely the reason why I didn't even come downstairs today until 3 in the afternoon. The book I finished was one of the best books I have ever read.  The True Story of Hansel and Gretel: A Novel of War and Survival , by Louise Murphy. Its all about WWII and the Holocaust. I think everyone needs to read it. See, this is what it looks like:     Now go fetch.   Ugh... I am doing laundry. I hate it. CURSE ALL LAUNDRY! Thats one of the reasons why I don't like having my parents be divorced. I have to do my own fucking laundry, and that sucks.  Sucks suckity suck suck sucks.  I don't have anything else to talk about. So... ermm.. bye?  Yah... bye.    "I think there are more truths in this world than there are artists"

       One step ahead of the shoe shine   I made the discovery of a century.   While I was bored last night, I went down stairs and started looking through all our old records, and I found Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. My response?  "Hella cool!"  So I pulled out the vinyl, and guess what fell out. guess. guess. guess.  A Bob Dylan poster! My second response?  "Hella WOO!"  No just kidding, I didn't really say that. But all the same, I was SUPER pumped.   Its so vintage-y and 70s I just can't help but love it. I promptly hung it up in my room.  Also, I found Janis Joplin's Greatest Hits, Tommy, Simon and Garfunkel, and a whole lotta broadway records (my moms).  I just LOVE records.  I love 'em, I love 'em, I love 'em!!

       Sham on!   Summer Celebration is an interesting place. Good people watching.  For instance, you may see one (one? psshh.. try one  hundred ) of these:      *shivers* EEEEEEEEWWWWWW   I actually ventured down to Heritage Landing for the first time since it started. Yup... Kool & The Gang. (not fimiliar? Hits: 'Celebration', 'Get Your Back Up Off The Wall')   But as we all know, no one goes to the concerts to hear the washed up disco bands.... ooohhh no. We all go to walk around and eat carni food. Which is the best part.  Okay, not the walking. I mean, EXERCISE?? I think not.  But the thing that gets me is that people (mainly, my disillusioned sister and my sister's disillusioned friends) buy passes for a week, but only use them to walk around. Guess what? You can do that for free on our treadmill. No joke! I'll turn it down extra slow so that you can talk and I'll just stand here next to you listening. What... don't give me that 'but its not the same'! Here, I'll turn on the oldies station and spray some bad cologne. See? Its just like your're really there!!  But I have no complaints about the carni food. Nope, none whatsoever. "Pile the cheese on those nachos m'am. But could you please avoid dropping one of your teeth into them? I have noticed that you must have some rare gum disease, concluding the lack of molars in your mouth. You only have a precious few left! Lets keep that mouth of yours shut tight, as not to lose anymore further."  ****  hey, I'm not gonna do the 'song of the day' thing anymore. I don't think anyone cares, and I think lyricsondemand.com may start charging me for my excessive use.   But to entertain yourself, I hand picked  urlLink this  especially for  you .

       I'd sleep it all away but the sun won't let me...I'd miss those lovely days of summer    Ah, this one is the best:  	  I love this  urlLink website .  And this  urlLink one .   Or  urlLink here .   So, how has everyone's summer been so far?  Since our weather has decided to actually cooperate with us, mine has just been peachy. I went to the beach today and yesterday, and while I despise the ardous walk from the parking lot to the water, I still enjoy my sandy freedom emensely.  Michigan isn't so bad in the summer. Can't say the same for the winter.  However, I greatly need a job. I have been waking up around noon, and if I must say, that fact is quite depressing. I feel like I am sleeping my life away. But sometimes, my dreams are a lot more entertaining then real life.  I haven't been to Summer Celebration yet, but I plan to go to the Art Fair tomorrow or Sunday. I'm also looking forward to the Air Fair. What's that you say? Sky diving Elvises?   AWESOME....what more could a girl want?  Also, I finally got my permit certified. I have logged about 4 hours so far. (WOO! Only 46 to go!) I forget how much driving can suck sometimes. My ADD-ish brain can't handle it.  "SLOW DOWN!"  "SPEED UP!"  "LOOK AT YOUR BLINDSPOT!"  "curb... curB...cuRB... cURB... CURB!!!!"  "... awww don't stress about it, Katherine, the accident wasn't even your fault..."   Ah, the joys of learner's permits.  **** Song of the SUMMER (errr... Day...): 'Who Needs Shelter'- Jason Mraz

          I am  not  a 'twentysomething'.. (thank god)          So, although I am loyal to blogger still, I have started a   urlLink  livejournal   .        I am going to do my best to update both, but it shall be hard, since I hardly have the ambition to type  one  post, let alone  two .       Maybe I'll alternate days.       Yes, thats the ticket.

        Fade, fade, fade          Satpreet has a    livejournal .      I have mixed feelings about this.       I am loyal to the faithful and steadfast blogger, and yet I have the nagging feeling to start my own livejournal. After all, you can have a 'friends list'. Basically, that is the only thing that is appealing to me right now.       But a more pressing matter is at hand: Today was the first day of  August .      And being the procrastinator I so dutifully am, I have still not sarted on the three books I have to read for english.  Not that I haven't had time . I certainly have. But between the new TV in my room, waking up at noon, and being my normal lazy self, Mark Twain can't seem to squeeze himself in. Yup.... sorry to break this to yah Mr. Huck Finn, my schedule is  booked .      I think it may be a subconcious thing. Maybe I am not starting those books because I know I have to take notes on them. And if I have to take notes on a book, I always end up hating the book.       Yes, thats what it is: a irrepressable subconcious attempt by my mind to destract my waking body to not read those American literature classics, as to not hurt my relationship (and future relationship) with them.      Or....      (In a simpler version)      I don't feel like doing work until I possibly have too.
