       this morning i woke up a bit early and, instead of rolling over and going back to sleep in my nice, warm, comfy bed, i decided to get up and head to my store.  i work at starbucks, but not just any lame-o starbucks!  i work at  the  starbucks on  the  cannery row.  yes, the same cannery row john steinbeck wrote about.  my store is in one of the tinneries that used to line the row.  this building once reaked of fish and sweat, but now warmly invites weary travelers in before heading to the aquarium with its sweet, coffee smell.  we have the most beautiful view of the sunrise, looking across the bay and toward the hills.  i never open anymore since anyone wishing to schedule me that early must have a death wish, but when i did, it was so amazing to finish the opening tasks just a few minutes early, make myself a soy latte, and sit down to watch the golden sun peak its head up over the hills to grace us with a glorious pink sky.   now, i should interrupt here and tell you that all that i have written here was a result of one of my favorite things in the world, my soy latte.  if you would have asked me an hour ago about all of this, i would have told you that since we are a "tourist" store, we get some of the rudest customers in the world!  and they come from all over the world just to insult the closest barista at our store!  if we can't speak their language, they get angry.  if we can't understand their accent or poor translation, we are at fault.  if we don't know which pastry they are pointing to because they won't even attempt to say the name printed clearly on the signs right in front of the pastry, we have insulted them beyond all belief!  please listen to me, if you ever go into a starbucks that isn't "your" store, please treat them the same way you would treat your own barista.  they are just trying to make your experience a pleasant one.  and please, please, please   don't forget the     TIP  !  we live off of those tips...

       so, i got an email the other day from a friend of mine from england. i have missed him dearly but had just given up on ever hearing from him again, let alone seeing him when out of the blue (where does that phrase come from? why can't it be out of the taupe or out of the seahorse?) he emailed me! simon wanted to tell me that he was moving here to cali, becoming a teacher, and getting married! oh my gosh! are you joking? he also told me that he and his fiancee, brook, were going to be driving through my monterey soon on their way to mickey's wedding! what! mickey's getting married too? so, in preparation for their arrival, i called today. he then told me that my leader of my dts, vero, got engaged this weekend!!! to marc james!!!!! WHAT!!! everyone's getting married. except me, strong, independant, stable, newly emotionally strong and stable, wonderful, weird me. i know that it isn't for lack of men, i have been asked out by the most eligable bachelors at all the nursing homes and the i-am-40-and-still-live-with-my-mommy-cause-i-am-not-really-able-to-give-up-the-video-games-and-mystery-science-theater-club. maybe i am too picky... maybe i need to let down some of the dating barriers i have created... maybe i am just loving myself for the first time in my life and just don't want to share my time with anyone else because i am very possesive... maybe i over-analyze too much...
