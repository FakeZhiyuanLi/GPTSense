						   Hello Internet Friend,  For the past 100 years we have all been stuck in the rat race we call life. There is a way out through a home business system that works.  I know that a lot of people are on an endless search for that easy make-money program that doesn't require any work - you just sign up and collect money.  I know, I'm searching, too!  While your waiting,   My name is Phyllis Newsome and I am offering anyone that is interested a simple system that I use to profit from the internet. However please be advised that I am not an internet guru by a long shot, just an average person trying to make a few extra dollars via the internet, and fed up with the massive amounts of hype in this virtual world that is costing us all a large portion of our precious time and money.  The key to building a long term residual income is having a simple, duplicatable process that anyone can follow and achieve success with.   I am not going to waste your time with a long introduction, So let’s get started :  Since everyone needs access to the internet to profit online, why not get your Internet Service Provided for FREE ? Here is the one that I use, this is an excellent service. No banners, No pop-ups, and Unlimited Connection for only $11.99 per month. But wait it gets better, you can sign up as an affiliate, get four people to use this connection service, and your monthly charges are paid for, and after that, you earn commissions from every individual that signs up for the service under your Id number Thus, adding yet another income stream to your portfolio.   urlLink Click here if your interested      I don't know your computer skills so I thought I would mention this revolutionary Newbie Website Learning System, now offering- Free Tutorials, Free eBook, Free Magazine, and a Free newsletter full of helpful tips. You may or may not need this. However please be aware that making money online is a lot about using your email program to it's maximum potential.  urlLink Click here if your interested       With that said, it’s time to  Get into business.  If you do not have your own product or service to start out with the clear choice would be promoting affiliate programs (where you earn commissions by promoting other people's products), Here is one that you can join for free, and you are provided with multiple websites The products range from nutritional supplements, environmentally safe cleaning products, Long Distance service, high-speed DSL internet service, Domain Name Registration, Books, tapes and hundreds of other products.  Your complimentary sites are already pre-configured with your ID so that when you advertise these sites on the internet, and people sign up or purchase products from your site, you receive the credit. So you basically have ONE simple objective...to refer people to your  Websites.  urlLink Click here if your interested      Tips to maximize your advertising efforts:  When you join an affiliate program you are given a basic URL to promote, it is very important that you find a way to disguise this basic link, You may be small, but you don't want to look that way. You can purchase a unique identifier that belongs only to you by registering your own Domain name (your address could be www yourfirmname com)  Ideally, you want to choose a name that is easy to remember and to spell and that relates to the topic you are promoting If you don't have your own domain you can find any number of places to buy Domain names (redirects) very inexpensively. Here is one that I recommend it does cost about $35 per domain name for a year, but well worth the expense.   urlLink Click here if your interested     *Note- you do not have to have a website to register a Domain name.  If this is not within your budget you can simply make your URLs more compact, shorten a long Web address, or simply disguise your affiliate link. Here is a free service that you can try.   urlLink Click here if your interested     Now you will need to promote your new business products and/or services:  IMPORTANT: If you have not already done so, please make sure to review the  urlLink CAN-SPAM ACT OF 2003   recently signed to law and effective January 1, 2004. This is very important for anyone who will use email as an advertising vehicle  There are three main methods of getting traffic.  One is using the free methods, another way is by paying for email advertising and the other is buying leads.  The second two work well, although there are plenty of scammers in both sections of this industry.   I am only mentioning FREE classifieds  because many people get involved with an opportunity because they simply don't have a lot of spare change in the first place. That means that they can't afford to do some of the more expensive forms of advertising. I will warn you up front, free classified advertising is effective, but it is EXTREMELY TIME CONSUMING.   Using many of the Free promotional techniques you will attract a lot of counter offers from other people. That is why it is VERY important to register A seperate business email account for running your new business.  If you would like to start out by using a Free email account-there are many available, Here are a couple FREE email accounts that I recommend, OR use one that you are familiar with:   http://mail.usa.com  http://UltimateEmail.com http://myway.com  Then simply go to any search engine, whether it be HotBot, MSN, Yahoo, Overture, whatever and type in "Free Classifieds". From that search you will get literally HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of places where you can advertise your ads free.  (Don’t forget to add your business URL in your signature file on all of your out going e-mail’s, I have also taken this a step further and had friends and family place my links in their outgoing messages In addition to printing Flyers that contain your Business information, and word of mouth -let everyone you know about your new business.   Here is a couple FREE Advertising hot spots that I use: #1   urlLink Click here if your interested      #2 Free solo ezine ads -  urlLink Click here if your interested      #3 This is an Interesting  NEW site, (a must see)  Advertise expenses vary , however very entertaining and informative.  urlLink Click here if your interested      And finally if you already have a business or not. You can jump on the fast track to success with this private membership, This is a one stop business resource guide that even offers free leads every month. I have been a member since February 2002, However it does have a minimal fee (less than 1 dollar per day)  urlLink Click here if your interested      If your interested in the above beneficial membership and need a way to help pay for this valuable asset, How about an additional income stream- Here is an assemble at home opportunity:  urlLink Click here if your interested       One Question??
