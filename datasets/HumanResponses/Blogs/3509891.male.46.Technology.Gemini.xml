      Well, I've just started this blog.  I am new to blogging, and so I hope this will be a successful experiment.  I have many projects that I am working on, and I find myself procrastinating on them.  I hope that this will help me organize my thoughts, and help me make some progress on my projects.

      One of my projects that I forgot to mention was genealogy.  I have been working on my family history on and off for about 15 years.  I haven't done anything with it for about 5 years now, which is why it slipped my mind.  But, I may catch the bug again.  Or I may get a call from some distant cousin that I didn't know I had.  So I will add this to my list of works.  Now, getting back to those Egyptians...

      I got back to my school assignment today.  My paper is about 80% complete now.  I found that I don't have a lot to say about Egyptian creation myths, though.  I am trying to make a connection between the creation myths, and the sociological agenda of the authors of the myths.  I presented some (what I believe are) good points for the Hebrew and Hindu myths, and passing observation for the Japanese myth.  But the Egyptions are either too subtle for me, or they just didn't use their myths the way I expected them to.  How dare they!

      I've added a download section to the sidebar at the right.  The first download I've made available is "SevenUp".  This is a four-player (3 computer players, and one human player) card game that I wrote in Delphi.  This game was written with very little reuse in mind.  As I have mentioned before, I am in the process of writing a card game library.  First, this project is intended to give me some practical expirience in writing programs in C#.  Second, it is designed to be reusable, so that writing new card games will be much easier with this library.  The first game I plan on writing with this new library is a replacement for the SevenUp game.  When That is done, I will place that game in the Download area.

      Well, it is now Monday, and not only did I NOT work on my novel, but I did not finish my assignment by Thursday.  It seems that my vacation did not attract my muse, afterall.  On the plus side, I did make it to the library, to do my research for one of my programming projects.  I did not get the answer that I was hoping for (although it was the answer that I expected).  At least I know how I will be proceding from here.

      I am taking a vacation from work this week, and I am hoping to catch up on some of my projects.  One of my programming projects (the Library book management program) will require some research, so I will see if I can contact someone at the library that can give me some information.  The big step, however, is in getting started on my first history paper.  I need to do a 4 page paper on creation myths, and I did my first rough draft today.  I put down some thoughts on what I will say, but it needs a lot of elaboration.  And then with a little polishing, it should be ready to submit by the end of the week.  The odd thing is, I feel guilty.  It feels as if I am avoiding working on the novel.  I am at a point in chapter one, where I will need to start writing dialog.  This, of course, scares me, so it is natural that I will tend to put it off.  However, school work DOES have priority over other projects.  OK!  So, if I can get the paper done by Thursday, that should give me some time to work on the novel.

      OK.  As I have already said, I am working on a number of projects, from school work, to computer programs, to novels.  Here is a more detailed description of my projects.  I have been taking classes at the University of Minnesota for the last 27 years, and I am finally a year away from graduating.  Needless to say, I am not one of the types of students that they are proud of.  In fact, in an effort to send a wake-up call to us slow-pokes, they have set a deadline, after which, to graduate, we would need to meet current requirements (instead of the requirements set when we enrolled, and which we have been working toward).  So in the intrest of finishing up as soon as possible (with a year to spare), I am taking a correspondents course over the summer.  My first assignment involves comparing a number of creation myths.  I have an idea of what I want to say, and have plotted out about half of the paper.  The main problem is forcing myself to sit down and write it.  That is where this blog comes in.  I figure if I can get myself to sit at the computer and write for this blog, I can work-out my thoughts, and continue on with the paper.  Next is my computer programming.  I have been working as a computer programmer for 19 years, and I have found that it is VERY important to keep up to date with the new technologies.  Therefore, I am trying to teach myself C# and ASP.NET.  First, the C#.  I have a little pet project that I first wrote in Delphi, and I have decided to start over from scratch and rewrite it in C#.  In Delphi it is a card game named Sevens, or SevenUp (I have it available for download on my web page).  In C#, I want to create a Cards development class library, to make it easier to create any card game.  I have most of the programming done for the card classes, but have yet to create the rules class.  Another program that I would like to write is a library book management program.  I would like to query the local library for information on a book using the barcode on the book.  No real great challenges there, just trying to find the time.  And finally, my novel.  I have a couple of ideas for books, and I made the mistake of telling one of them to a coworker of mine.  She fell in love with it, and wants me to write it, so she can read it.  And then, to make matters worse, she gave me an idea for another book.  And so I need to spend time on this as well.  Although my genre of choice is science fiction, this book is more of a spy thriller, involving a stollen PC, with sensitive information on it, a terrorist plot, and an innocent bystander who can't seem to shake the people tracking him.  I have been able to start work on the book, but I am not a writer yet, and I still don't know how to write dialog.  At some time, I will make the plunge and start.  At that time, I will bring a sample to my friend, and she will be able to critique it for me.  So what's stopping me.  Again, maybe this blog will help me.  We'll see.

      Look at the date.  It's been over a month since I last blogged.  Where does the time go?  Well, I have sent in my first homework assignment, and am waiting for it to be returned, graded.  In the mean time, I have started work on my next assignment.  This one is on the law documents of ancient civilizations.  It sounds more in-depth then it really is.  It's really a comparetive essay.  My co-worker (grouppy? fan? agent?) is pressing me for the first chapter of my book.  She has set a deadline for it.  Conflicting deadlines.  Just what this blog was meant to address.  But then, if I don't make use of it, how is it supposed to help?  I have a two week vacation coming up, so I hope to make use of that to catch up on my writing.  But that's just another way of postponing it, isn't it?  So I had better get going at it now.
