       urlLink    How can you drown in a garden pool?? Read this  "The 9-foot-deep garden pool where three children and a father drowned this week was originally designed to be 3 feet deep, a city official said, and an extensive safety review was planned.  Police say 8-year-old Lauren Dukes slipped and tumbled in. Her friend, 11-year-old Juantrice Deadmon, grabbed her hand but was pulled in. Then 13-year-old Christopher Dukes jumped in to help his sister and Juantrice.At some point, the Dukes' father, 39-year-old Myron, also jumped in. After struggling to stay afloat, all four went to the bottom.  Police said the victims had obeyed signs warning against swimming in the fountains, waterfalls and pools.The pool where the four drowned is fed by water that flows down several irregularly spaced steps, creating waterfalls. The water is pulled through a drain at the pool's bottom by a pump, and the water is then recirculated through the structure.  The city has paid claims to people who have fallen down the steep steps, officials said. No injuries were serious enough to warrant erecting barriers, Zavala said. Before Wednesday, the most serious accident at the park was in 1991, when an 80-foot light pole fell and killed two people.  City officials planned to meet with an engineering firm Friday to start the study. Officials said the Water Gardens, which have been drained, will remain closed until police finish investigating.  In Chicago's South Side, the steps of Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, where the victims worshipped, were piled with flowers and teddy bears. Myron Dukes' sister, Georgia Dukes-Watson, said he and his wife, Stephanie Dukes, had gone to the convention with their two children to embrace their spirituality and take a break from their financial worries.

       urlLink     Teenage sensation Wayne Rooney was compared to Pele, the most famous soccer player of all time, after he powered England into the quarter-finals of Euro 2004 with two goals in a 4-2 defeat of Croatia on Monday.   England are joined in the last eight by champions France who beat Switzerland 3-1 thanks to two late goals from Thierry Henry. Swiss striker Johann Vonlanthen took over from Rooney as the youngest scorer in European Championship history with his first half effort.   Rooney, 18, is Euro 2004's top scorer with four goals, leading his normally understated coach Sven-Goran Eriksson to draw comparisons with Brazil's maestro.  "I sometimes try not to say things but he is absolutely incredible," said Eriksson. "I don't remember anyone making such an impact on a tournament since Pele in the 1958 World Cup."   "When you see him perform, nothing fazes him," said David Beckham. "It was a big game tonight. He has produced again and he deserves all the praise he gets.  OK...whatever  >

       urlLink    Another Japanese horror remake coming to theatre this halloween. We already have The Ring 2 and this promising Buffy-takes-on-japanese-vengeful-ghost movie called "The Grudge". In case you're not a japanese horror fan, Ju-on : The grudge is one of the most successful and one of the creepiest, I might add, horror franchise in Japan. Now with the remake starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr and Bill Pullman hit theaters on August 22nd. Looks like a new trend for hollywood to reamke a japanese movie with the original director directing the remake. No difference in this one. Takashi Shimizu the original Ju-on director returns in this Hollywood version. Asian horror fans can rest their cases for now as the words are out that this remake will be as nail-biting-eyes-covering creepy as the original, and guess what? the movie takes place in Japan. Miss Gellar and her castmates finished filming in Tokyo, Japan in March. Oh..and in case you haven't seen the original, Lion gates is realeasing limited realease in New york and LA this summer. Go see it and you'll know that in Japanese horror..nobody lives. LOL that's a major spoiler.OOPS Click on  urlLink the link  to see a bigger version of Miss Gellar in The Grudge.
