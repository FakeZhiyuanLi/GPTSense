      5/12/04  Not much today. I didn't go to school. I stayed home and watched the talkshows. As usual Jerry Springer was airing cheating. That show sucks so much. I watched maury, who aired how this 800 pound man lost 600 pounds. Boy.. thats more than 7 of me. And then I watched a little bit of Dr. Phil which was boring. And then I finished it off by watching Oprah, there was this 9 year old boy who was born as a girl, but changed into a boy when he/she was 6. Kinda suck. Wonder how they would.. you know.. "Build" the male organ.  Anyways, This is probably going to be my last post because I didn't do much today. Krillin(Christopher Fletcher) told me journalism is theapeudic. I don't feel anything when I throw my words on the blogger thingy.   Btw check this weird post I saw on govteen.com  "is ther anyone there who has hot story they would like to share like the first time i got with another little boy, it starrted wen me ryan,and 4 girls and jay were at ryans house and we played truth or dare and me and ryan had to french for 3 seconds, after everybody left i went into the shower and in the middle of the shower ryan walked in the shower naked with his tiny penis hanging out sayin he wanted my little body, so we started to make out butt naked in the shower, and that was how i got started on my liking of little pubeless boys like me."  There are so many sick people on the internet. It's not even funny. There HAS to be ways to check your identity before you sign on the internet. Like...  If you are a convicted sex predator/pedofiler. You should be banned from the internet.  If you are not running atleast a broad band connection. You should be suspended from the internet.  If your computer is more than five years old. You should be suspended from the internet.    I know that kind of stuff sounds ignorant, but think of the things it would solve.   -Peace out. Roan          My stats 4'8"  86 lbs. Puberty stage: Undisclosed :P

      This week...  5/11/04  Well this is my first post. I dunno what to say really.. But life really sucks. I took two big tests today. Visual Basic 6, I bombed this test. Probably going to fail that class too. My math test was very hard too. Who knew complex fractions w/trinomial factoring could be so confusing? Screw that.  On saturday my dad gave me $100. I was like...  Me: "What's this for?"  Dad: "You studied hard, I noticed."  Me: "I don't deserve it..." *about to hand back the bill*  Dad: "Take it... *Pocket the cash*  I don't really know what to say about being hesitant to accept cash. I must be some sort of freak. *sigh*  Today was unusally warm for this time of the year. I wore a pair of sorts that I've had since 6th grade. This proves that growing is an asshole. Also, a nice new. Large nautica  t-shirt. Went down to my knees. Anyways, with bashing my on fashion sense.   As I got on the bus today, I noticed it was humid as hell. I sat at the 4th two-seater. As the bus kept going. Around the fourth or fifth stop this huge fatass sat right next to me. I was like... "What the hell?". Anyways I just delt with his enormous size and profuse stench for the 15 minute bus ride. I got to homeroom and threw my book bag on the desk. I sat down and fell asleep on my bookbag. Again, I was sleep deprived from playing Saga till three in the morning.  The bell rings and go about my normal school schedule. Until I met up with a girl that always *destorys* me with her book bag. I got advice on this and the guys at saga says she likes me. I don't know why.... How does a girl like you when they hit you? Love doesn't make any sense.....  I got to 10th period and it was gym. I got changed (Which might I add is communism). I got changed and head out to play volleyball. Since I seem to suck at everything that involves coordination. Some dude spiked the ball and thwacked me into the face. My nose bleed and it sucked. it was a good excuse to miss a few minutes of History. But, the pain wasn't really worth it.    It was another one of those annoying school days. Got abloody nose, probably failed two quizzes and got beat up by the same girl.  That is all, my first post.
