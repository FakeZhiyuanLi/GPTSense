      Welcome listeners ! the freaking friday is upon us!  Everyone is being A FREAK today and thanks to our double full moon, it can only linger awhile longer before the shadows drift across the crater and it is back to pinkworld as we knowd it. Another wonderfully gloomy day here up on the Northcoast of oHIo, I love those the best as it pushed all the color of the region to the forefront of vision and never seems quite as bad as everyone groans about...  I have not blogged for two nights because I have been working on prints. I have found a great black paper that is soft enough to still pick up some images on old woodblocks I have not been able to pull prints off of. It is on sale this week, and I just keep trucking back and forth so pull more off...i am surrounded by b & w in the studio and they look sweet - white on black is always sleek stuff and this paper is very sexy and elastic...kinds of like that Democratic Kerry Speech last nite, which is what i stopped printing to check out...very worth it, I thought i would get pissed at the political bs, but i thought he did a good job and made some effective points that maybe i bury because I don't want to think big business runs my county  I framed up some of my wine themed prints for Ted's Wine Shop and painted some wine buckets i thrifted for him....i am not a very crafty person, so I am sure they look a little too abstract for foodies to purchase, but ya never know...  I have a new scanner from my sister and it is a scanning beast - I have tried to scan my artwork and I guess I did not realize how much art I have that is under 11 X 14 that could be scanned...Recently I was asked for my portfolio and of course I have not put together anything in the 5 yrs I have had stupid corporatey art jobs or been trapped at grad school ..... nor do I think about them like a designer, it's like here's what i have done and ususally graphics people look pretty confused because what i do does not sell anything or can be directly used to sell anything....processed, whatever !  today the crucial tunage is from my fav 80 station on line _ RADIOIO80s it is like i am 17 and excited about music again, which really does not happen too much anymoo....some of my favs played today were suicidal tends, robyn hitchcock,  kate bush and some 808 !!!so random and it so doesn't metter because it was the 80's  i am off to bowl tonite after some serious spirits....first weekend of not having to work one of my three crappy jobs as I prepare to gain more points on my ever evolving resume and get social before it gets chilly and you see no one for months

      today i hopped on the boat to ebay and set sail to selling all my artwork without ever having to speak to anyone - an artist's wet dream! I placed a few items up for sale that were woodblock prints and priced them low to see if any bids and fights break out over my stuff. That would be amusing!spent most of today staring either at my box at work or at home, my eyes are getting sick of this blue glow that bleeds out of all our homes....must be that full moon.....today was a typically gray rainy cleveland day even for July and the b-52's were just too damn happy to listen too...sometimes I put on NPR but the Democonvention is driving the coverage into my brain...ugh....so it was the cars today for crucial tunage, and it was CANDY -O, which still proved to be goofy but I will take that over the doom and gloom of Public radio any day when it is raining here.....  so log on to ebay and pick up some cheap OG artwork ! what a steal ! they are prints, which are not my primary artistic interest but they are just as challenging and symbolic to my work as paintings. I have loaded one swirl image, one paw print and one wine print. The hope of variety there would be to sell out to anyone who is buying...hopefully all my artwork will sell and this time next week we will be printing like mad to keep up with the edemand!

      okey - added all the personal stuff no one will give a hoot patoot aboot! we be off and blogging....today is monday and i am back to my day job in just a few hours....stayed up late to frame up some prints for Ted ( my husband's name is not ted, but for the sake of the blog, his teaser tag is indeed TED....think Farmer Ted from "Sixteen candles" ? Doctor Ted from " Earth Girls are Easy", TED a great name for a great schmoozey wine expert.....so framing up some commercially minded wine themed prints and realizing I was out of black paper to print on so I zipped out to a big box artsy craft store and purchased more paper to print upon...I am printing and scanning in hopes of ebaying my life away and loading some images on the gallery site...but then once I start unraveling once aspect of art, others tend to follow and of course I am also up late setting up this !@#$%&ing ebay account and my box here is just pretty old and slow to set up things like blog and ebay accounts....Earlier i had scored some super ugly jonesny green pants, , lame lizjeans, stevem shoes and a sleeveless polka dotted dress ( petite so it might actually f!@#ing fit )so i was not so discouraged about printing shortcomings when i got shoes on sale...they even turn up a bit....recently my favorite shoes were devoured by the izzburg , my plucky boston terrier pup and altho they were Kenneth Cole and not stevem, they were square and turned up like a dutchman and were supernotcool, so i adored them....as did the izzywhirl with her tiny teeth! she is not very destructive except when i really love something or if it was part of a bone... so this week we look forward to further cleaning up my studio in my attic, going back to work in a few short hours after being away for a few days and surfing the net for a new job....need a new day job that allows for graduate work to be completed and new work created for the gallery....this week I need to get my arse on ebay and sell some stuff!! When I have worked in various frame shops it is amazing to me how many people buy art off ebay! what the f*&! am I waiting for ? well, you never really want to deal with the commerce crap of art and personally I would prefer just to paint, print and draw and never have to think about how to sell it and to whome....but this is the case for Buzz, the space i run with a few of my compadres and fellow artists who can't stand ass kissing to get into galleries and shows....so much smooching I JUST CAN"T F*%$#ING DO, we have our own space and do whatever we feel will sell, not what some other jackass thinks they can sell...oh well, cleveland is not a cultural mecca and thus the reason for grabbing the wheel and driving yer own way off the interstate....... sad to see this week close, last week I hung out with the fam as my seester was in town, freshly married, hung out at the gallery with the artsy folk and later at the Lava Lounge and then did some more painting on some wood squares I carved shapes into with chalk....future paintings....maybe...ok - a few more resumes to email out to the world and back to bedville - gotta get up early to print underlayer & prepare for my favorite radio station - W-O-R-K ! hopefully it might stopp raining to drive 1 hr to RV....hopefully!  TODAYS' ~ crucial tunage ~CD PICK - b-52's  I have over 900 stupid cds of alternative poppy eighties ( some later )tunes... occasionally i fall back into love with something i never listen to and like to share  today my rediscovered gem was the banana yellow B-52's debut album which i finally broke down and bought on cd after having lost my double tape ( wild planet & b-52's debut were available on a double tape- totally cheapass cassette classic! ) when it melted on the dashboard of my chevy citation during my lunch shift about 14 yrs ago during my lunch shift at Don's Pomeroy Hell. I did rebuy 'WIld Planet" on cd and have since splurged on "Whammy" and 'Cosmic Thing" which is pretty okey, but i think that might bring the b52 section of my collection to the end......that fred!  he is right tho - there is a moon above called....the moon....  goodnite moon!

      last we left off, I had my g-ma's 80th birthday party on Sunday that went off very well and she was quite surprised to see 50 of her friends and relatives also at brunch that day !! ( her birthday was not the day of the surprise party to further...surprise her....)....she never quite got the look of shock off her face so that was great!  Monday Todd and I were both off together and we went to a very fun local concert on Public Square of very fun local bands....my favorite radio show " the ASSHOLIER THAN THOU " on Monday mornings is from 7 - 9am and I am a faithful listener....that day they announced a public square FREE concert with FUzzhead and Vernacular so we were there....sat there for a spell until I realized that Sitting on the next bench next to me was most of SOnic Youth who were in town that nite and i think i would freak out playing my guitar knowing Thurston Moore is in the audience, especially if I was playing right from his playbook, as one of the bands sure did! so pretty cool FO FREE  Tuesday I was informed that my vacation was sort of over and I was a part timer. I scored a job at a local ceramic space and let's hope this does not suck. I trained a few hours this week and it all seemed pretty cool so far...  Friday Todd and I escorted my g-ma to a fab production of West Side Story at the Chagrin little theater. Aside from my grandmother's insistence to arrive a whole hour early, the mainly hi schoolers did pretty well dancing signing and actin it up.. theater is such an odd culture to me, visual art is such a scavenger, isolationistic beast and theater people seem like organized little wolfpacks...so different.....  Saturday i hung out at Buzz as Colin my partner in crime ripped down the old show and slapped up the new crap! it is an artist from Chicago and it is ok work....nothing that gets me to fake any excitement but maybe I will change my mind if we sell some stuff and make some breadcrumbs.....I was supposed to go to a party but my friend PK must have just gone without my ass...all the same, I have been in my studio just about everynite getting some pieces to come back to life and creating some nice stuff for my upcoming exhibit as Buzz in October...I was really in the middle of a nice flow and wasn't in any mood to cut myslef down and drag my turp /stinky spirit soaked ass and be crabby me at another party...  today i worked but luckily before I left I dumped minty green paint on my grey carpet in my bedroom and it SPLATTERED the room...one would think we have gone for a more eighties look at my house! so I have spent most of the evening saturating my carpet and then soaking up any paint still swilling around my carpet fibers...this is the hell of living with an artist who thinks that they are so talented they don't need drop cloths, which is true until they unleash their special talent of being clumsy and uncoordinated and then the drop cloth might have come in handy instead of finding paint splattered even on the darn dog......  saturday colin and I went chasing a fire...ended up being in Midtown and was a garage with 60 cars...someday i will become more geekier and nail a camera to record such weird crap that amuses me to no end and post it alongside the witty banter...until then, think smokin tires for sur........  tunage > still listening to the goddamn b-52's........however, in cleaning out my storage areas, I did find my pathetic tape collection....peee yewww did I have no taste.....so I tried to slap in a few old tapes while painting on Wed and proud to say it is hard to paint to Kajagoogoo or the Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Soundtrack... however, I was surprised to enjoy my squeeze tape bablyon and on " hourglass" being the actual hit off the lp in fall of 87? might have to take the cd plunge on that one...i usually LOVE to paint to Brian Ferry [Boys and Girls} being my NO#1 studio tape of all time but somehow my ancient tape unraveled a feww days ago and now I have to buy it AGAIN .......because brain ferry could sing the phone book and I would care......roxy is ok but BF is a must have for the studio or the bedroom...

      took a few days off to do art, clean my house and get ready for gma's eighty-th birthday party this weekend....pretty outrag....other than that, Buzz had an opening last nite of black artists Friday nite which was cool and off the hook as far as ass - backwards organization   Last weekend i Hung out a Patsy's new pad and it is very sweet! I took two days off and hung out with Ted and then interviewed with anyone who will let me thru the door...the only thing worse than having a job is looking for one....  Wed I hung out with my mom and we went to a funky ass paper store in Brunswaco and found some clear sleeves for my prints...stocked up on some paper and lipstick and drove my ass back home as fast as possible...always fun to hang out with mom but it was dreary and yucky and it was brunswaco....yick....  My sister is in town for our g- ma party and we will be faking a party tonite so my g-ma does not expect the huge - ass party we planned for sunday...hah ha  paintings are going well, started 5 more that have more promise than the batch I am screwing up after their first layer of paint....some colleges were constructed this week and I just have to paint and sand, we will see how hard hardboard really is >  Lately the crucial tunage as been jazz....jazz jazz jazz...miles and miles of miles! kind of blue and bird are summer painting favorites as it seems like the cool down the intensity that heats up in the studio.....  made a new buzz print this week because I must have pitched the old one in a fit of rage....so unlike me to throw ANYTHING away.....  ok - back to the white trash art fest ival i am ignoring to blog
