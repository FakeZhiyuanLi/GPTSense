      So last night, I was over at Kasey's. We were chillin' like the homies that we are playing truth or dare. It was more truth though because Kaleigh was still up. Billy came over (drools profusely.) Just as we were about to play truth or date. Of course, I wasn't dumb, I knew not to choose dare while Billy was in the room. They would have dared me to hump him or something. Trish was about to ask me if I liked Billy, but I interrupted her before she could finish by telling Billy that I liked him. Then somehow, Kasey ended up asking me if I would ever make out with him or have 'sexual intercourse' with him. I wouldn't do the dirty with him, I wouldn't, but I would make out with him. God knows it.  Alcoholic beverages were drank last night, and things began to get crazy after awhile. Kasey and Ronnie got into it and Kasey ran out the front door and down the street with Ice 101 in her hands...Smart, isn't it? Luckily, the cop that was sitting with that old guy was off duty or he would of taken her in, like he said he would of. After Kasey calmed down, we went back to the house, only to find Ronnie gone. He had left minutes after we did, he too had alcohol in his hands. He came back a little after we did. Everything was peachy after I talked with Ronnie outside and made him not want to hang himself. Then, in the middle of bringing his confidence up, Trish comes outside and tells me Kasey is puking her intestines out. So after putting Kasey in her bed, Trish began to drink more, making herself even more drunk than she already was on vodka and orange juice. After trying to keep Ronnie and Trish from pulling Kasey out of her bed, and forbearing them from pouring sprite all over her hair. I failed. Things were pretty screwed up last night.  I go back to work tomorrow. I've had a freakin' rash on the left side of my face that insanely itched. So mom took me to the hospital and they gave me a shot in the butt with cortisone. It's all good now, the redness is gone, the itching has faded, and I'm back to normal again. I've been typing for awhile. So, I'm out like a lamp.

        Recently, I started hanging out with Kasey.  One of my closest best friend who moved to Lexington, Kentucky when I was in the sixth grade, and then in the seventh grade moved to Indiana. Last year, she moved back and into an apartment next to her Dad and Cyndi, her step mom. She is probably the only person who I can tell enormous secrets too. Well, Two people, Her, and Sarah. Those are the only two people that I trust not to reveal my secrets. She's cool,  I'll probably type more about than anything else because lately I've practically been living with her.     C.J moved out. I thought I wasn't going to miss him when he moved out because he was an ass monkey when he lived here, But I miss him. I miss the cool music of Alkaline Trio, and Coheed and Cambria blaring from her guitar and from his surround sound, and I miss the rude, but needed comments that he makes towards Megan. I went to the theater sunday with Sarah to see the Village and C.J gave me free popcorn and a free drink. Seeing as how he never has done that before, I was utterly shocked. Wednesday was his birthday and mom made him a Broccoli Casserole cake. It was good. Ha, He left it here, and I ate it...he was suppose to take it home.  Oh well. I would of gave him a large amount of money, say a fifty but mom gave me a twenty and told me to give it to him instead. For his graduation present, I gave him half of my savings. It took forever for me to save up. But, I made the big decision to give him one hundred dollars. Now, How I have it, I saved up two-hundred-thirty something.    I'm out like a lamp, Later Donkeys.
