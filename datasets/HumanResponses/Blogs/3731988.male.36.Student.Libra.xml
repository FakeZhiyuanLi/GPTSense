      Still not quite back into the swing of things. Eventually I'll get to the point where I'm posting everyday. Soon, in fact. Until then, here's what I wrote yesterday for a California Dem group I'm part of, which discusses the liberal/conservative divide in our country. It should make sense, despite the other views not being posted:      I don't think you can separate Americans' perception of themselves as either conservative or liberal from the culture-clash that created the current definitions. Ronald Reagan was the one who so thoroughly stigmatized the word "liberal," as a reaction to the 60's counter-culture. Before that, liberal largely meant supporters of so-called New Deal-type "welfare state" policies (as opposed to Reagan's corporate welfare) -- although I've seen speeches going back to Kennedy and Truman that talk about the liberal/conservative divide, and the underlying themes sound as if they could've been written yesterday. As a result of Reagan, though, liberal is now mostly taken to mean the difference between being "grown-up" and "hippy-dippy," despite that being a flawed and unfair characterization, and the fact that the reverse is closer to being true.     But Reagan was able to get inside the skin of Democrats and dissect them extremely effectively, because he WAS one until about the age of 40...and there's no zealot like a convert. The same way that journalists today (and for the last twenty years) -- despite the majority of them being liberal -- are far harsher on their own kind. First, as a result of trying to be fair and taking it too far. Second, as a result of the sh*tty essence of human nature, "me too-ism," and how incredibly fun it is to tear people down. Third, the fact that most of them suck at their job, and have as much insight into human nature as my dead pet gerbil. Finally, because members of "The Fourth Estate" have reduced themselves to being sensationalistic purveyors of garbage, with an "if it bleeds, it leads" mentality, and a need to make things bleed if they aren't currently doing so. Oh, and because most of them suck at their job, if I haven't mentioned it. Along with their being spineless worms.   That phenomenon (with the exception of sucking at their job, and perhaps being spineless worms) is largely shared by the public. Finding the worst in people is like a drug, and the country is addicted. It's as a result of all this, I would argue, that only 18% of Americans call themselves liberal, despite their stance on policy issues. Even during the hey-day of Clinton bashing, I never felt that the media branch of the vast right-wing conspiracy -- at least the ever-dwindling "objective" part of it -- was acting in a conscious effort to serve as the GOP's lapdog. Rather, being the GOP's lapdog was a result of being slaves to sensationalism, of having all the insight of a rotting shoe, and most especially, of really, really sucking at their job. (Along with being spineless worms, as I may have mentioned.)    But as the band Smashmouth said regarding the 60's cultural revolution (which had a long hangover period, convincing many of us that the spirit that tried to squash it was gone forever): "This is a love attack, I know went out but it's back. It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact."     The Reagan Revolution was what caused the love attack to retract, like George Costanza's what's-it after a cold swim. But it's back, or on the verge of being back, just as the song suggests. And this time, when we win, it will be here to stay.     In order to defeat the competing mindset, though, and successfully usher in the new (previous) age, I don't think it's a question of politics, but a question of culture. To the extent that politics can effect the culture (which I think is minimal, if relying on caucuses, congresses, or Kucinichs), then the route you describe could be effective. But with most of the people I know -- outside of those I know from political circles, who are the exception, not the rule -- revamping the intra-party dealings of the Democratic Party is just not the way to reach those who need reaching. It needs to be something far more superficial, and pleasing to the eye. As Otter from Animal House said: "this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part."     I mean that facetiously, of course, but in the same spirit as he did, which is to think in all new terms...and I think the Dems have spent the last two years doing that. In short, I believe we have already done what some are suggesting needs doing. The party HAS remade itself, spurred by the catalyst of the Iraq war debate, and it has taken the culture right along with it. Air America and the Daily Show are doing what Dennis Kucinich and Ralphie "the Nad" Nader never could. In my view, the conservative/centrist/progressive debate within the party has pretty much run its course. That's the argument we've been having for the last thirty years, not the one we need to have going forward. The whistle has blown, and the DLC-type Democrats have finished ahead of the far left-wing, if one insists on judging it that way. (Which I don't.) At some point the question becomes whether or not the left wants to accept that, because there's nothing in the cards that is going to radically change the views of the majority of Americans in the years ahead.     All that needs to be accomplished now is coming together to defeat George Bush in the fall. After that, if people of any political persuasion within the party can't find a receptive atmosphere for their views -- or can't find the words to express them, or sway the views of others -- then maybe we should just part ways and do our own thing. I think the Democratic Party has remade itself, though, and I for one am extremely pleased with the result. If those same groups want to fracture before the election, and thereby torpedo both of our futures (which I'm not suggesting anyone here is doing), that's okay with me, too. As I've said before, suffering is good for the soul. We're almost home, though. And I'd love for us to make it there together...

      Hey all...back online blogging for the first time since December. Yay!   Who am I talking to, though? No one knows I'm here. And there's nothing to read but this introductory post.   Right now I'm just enjoying watching Terry McAuliffe befuddle Ed Gillespie on CNBC. Ed seems a bit uncomfortable talking about Dick Cheney's ongoing financial interest in Halliburton. Poor guy...  Okay, the blog is set up. More to follow...

      Have you seen the weirdo who's touting his "American Evita" book regarding Hillary Clinton? I wonder what guys like that would do if they possessed self-respect, or weren't creating false issues like the "Clintons don't want Kerry to win" stuff...which picks up where their "Bill Clinton is obsessed with his legacy" obsession with Bill Clinton's legacy left off. These are the same people who in high school aspired to be members of the in-crowd, but never quite made it. In their Quixotic opposition to the Clintons, however, they feel as if they can finally have their revenge. There's a saying they may want to consider, though: Once a loser, always a loser. Just something to think about.  Speaking of deficient self-respect: Ralph Nader continues to diminish himself as well, by aiding George Bush's bid for "re"-election. Now that his wings have been so thoroughly clipped by Dems, however, Ralph is actually kind of cute; like a tarantula in a jar. Here's lookin' at you, Nad-boy...to the extent that such can be stomached.  But the real fun, as always, comes from the Republican spin-factory -- which is kind of like Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory, except instead of chocolate they use feces. (And instead of Oompa Loompas, Robert Novak.) The Repugs are banking heavily on the word "liberal" to get them through this election; a word I've now heard slightly less than the eighty-seven-billion, four-hundred trillion times I've heard the phrase: "We know he had weapons of mass destruction. He used them on his people. The previous administration said he had them. The UN said he had them," and so on. And it's just as mind-numbing...though the numbing effect, in this case, is something that will come back to bite them in the ass. (Which, incidentally, is probably the only way the poor bastards will ever have something bite them in the ass.)  The liberal tag has been the cornerstone of conservative attack-politics since Ronald Reagan stigmatized it in the Eighties...and today, they're apparently intent on running it into the ground. Which is appropriate, since the technique is near dead. As a result of their lack of insight, however -- and seeming to sense that liberals are on the verge of removing the stigma altogether -- they have taken a frontal approach, and challenged Kerry and Edwards to embrace the label. "Why don't they just admit they're liberal?" the conservatives taunt. Answer: Because conservatives are doing the leg work of rehabilitating the word for us. Why interrupt a good thing?  Think about it: Kerry and Edwards are going to run away with this election; then remember that the younger generation -- whose lack of memory over Vietnam made them accept lies about Iraq as their first taste of nationalism (and are being convinced to embrace women dying in back alleys because they have no memory of illegal abortions) -- are being told that the soon-to-be-victorious ticket is the embodiment of extreme liberalism. Yet following the election, they will be responsible for returning honor and prosperity to our country. Then think about whether Kerry/Edwards should embrace the phrase now...or if it will be more fun to let conservatives continue to instill the positive connotation themselves.  I've always laughed at the "liberal media" idea -- not just because it's asinine, but because it shows that most people don't know what far-left liberal truly means. If you want to know if Kerry and Edwards are extremist or mainstream, though, ask a Green Party member...then run like hell, unless you want an earful.

      Bill Clinton is a man in pain. This is as it should be, it would seem, judging by the way things are, or at least how they have been. I've seen him in several interviews lately in which he -- like myself and Mick Jagger -- can get no satisfaction. It's irritating to watch (if a bit ironic): interviewers who don't listen, and who are on to the next question before he finishes the last. Superficial searches for superficial meaning, satisfying their superficial needs. Robert Bly, in his book "Iron John," said: "The gift comes from the wound." So it is with Bill Clinton. Forever wounded. Forever suffering, in the gaze of an uncaring eye. Even those who care don't really care, unless they're mutants like myself. With apologies to William Buckley, the book of our times could be called: "Let Us Talk of Petty Things." And we do. Lord knows, we do.   So a man like Clinton, who has much too say, but finds himself squeezed between Jennifer Lopez's buttocks and Britney Spears' boobs -- (insert joke here) -- can't find an audience on our frantic TV dial. He's not alone, however...though more alone, since Marlon Brando died. Unlike James, Jimi, Jim, and Janis, and much like the tortured Brando: Clinton did everything right except his exit. And like the worst of us, has been fated to live. It's fitting, some would say, to have to stick around. This joke that has been played upon us -- this wretched, decrepit joke -- has more than one rimshot in mind for Bill Clinton. Though, contrary to what some might think, it's not a matter of getting what he deserves. Who does, after all? Even if they deserve the worst, which Bill Clinton most assuredly does not.    I'm not above it myself. I've been known to crack wise with a Clinton joke, just because -- and perhaps this is fitting -- just because I can. None so profound as my favorite, which is: "What would John Kennedy say about the Monica Lewinsky scandal? He would say (to paraphrase his famous speech, in his New England accent): 'He did it, not because she was easy...but because he was haaad!'" I've carted that joke around for years now, like a kid forever on his way to soccer practice. It no longer even makes me laugh. And yet I keep it, in the vain hope that one day someone will appreciate just how truly clever I am.  They never do, though, Bill, they never do. The rotten bastards never will. I coulda been a contender, had life not gotten in the way. I could have been a champion, had it not involved rising to the occasion. Clinton met every challenge, of course, but then he took it too far. Any sane man would. Laughter in excess turns to sorrow, and excess tears to laughter. So said William Blake, roughly...and so it is for Bill. But his suffering makes us better, by letting us know what lies ahead. If we're not cautious. If we're too good. If we strive too far. Achievement in excess is decadence. And excessive decadence? Well, that just leads to blogging in the middle of the night.  From the act of a quintessential loser, John Kennedy's libido spilt out over the land. His head cracked open and infected the place, and gave us the roaring Sixties. A child of that libido, Bill Clinton, found Kennedy's intelligence and carried it back to the White House. But like his idol, he too, would end in tragedy, with a shot heard 'round the world. A rim shot, or whatever...whatever suits your need. Bill Clinton was America's Rorschach test. And unlike the Rhodes Scholar who did so much for our country, America flunked.

      In what will serve as the death knell for the Bush-(ball and)Cheney "re"-election effort, John Kerry named North Carolina senator John Edwards to take over for the disgraced current vice-president in January. Voting formalities aside -- not because they'll steal it, like the present commander-in-thief, but because Americans love their country -- John Kerry and John Edwards will soon set America back on track, and bring our world back from the brink of disaster. Our country, the planet, the universe, has just breathed a collective sigh of relief. It's time to let America be America again...and Bush can settle for being Texan.  In the ongoing illustration on how far back on their heels the incompetent president's campaign is, they continue to sling mud and pray that something sticks. Following the political direction of right-wing scumbag Dick Morris -- whose expert advice amounts to "insult them to drive up their negatives" -- desperate Republicans have been doing just that. In an attempt to say something positive, though, the Bush campaign is releasing an ad featuring John McCain that reminds Americans not to forget we are at war. But do so optimistically. And, bringing together some old family friends for the first time in a long time, Osama bin Laden's image appears in the ad. Now, one might wonder why the Bushies would want to put the image of the man George let get away in their campaign ads...but then, one might wonder why the Bushies do alot of things.   But those days are behind us now...or soon will be. It is time for America to be America again. And starting in January, it will be.
