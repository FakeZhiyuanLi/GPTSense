      Hey, Not doing a lot today. I feel quite sapped of energy though cos I just got out of the bath.  Wedding tomorrow and I'm already having doubts about what I'm going to wear. See, it's this blue top, and it comes down quite low so when I'm eating... ahem. Yeah, I'll see.  I said in a different post that I couldn't go to ATC, but my mum said I could! Yay. She said she would drop me down there and maybe I could get a taxi or something back... hooray. That'll get me out of the house from time to time :-D Ha. Fuck you to all of you twats that say I don't get out much.  It's really crappy weather today. I don't want it to be like that tomorrow, cos I'll be really cold. Especially in church. Ick. Church. I never go to church. Never ever. I'm not religious at all. In my opinion, the bible leaves a lot of history out... like the dinosaurs etc. Where do they come into it in Genesis. And humans were on the Earth by the 7th day in Genesis. That's just not possible. History and science can be proved. Religion cannot. I'd prefer history and science because of this.  Hmmm... one of my friends was on the bus when I went to the cinema with Lois. It seems different between us... somethings just aren't the same. Somebody else said to me that she's stuck up, but she hasn't always been like that. Grrr why do people have to change? I guess I've changed too. I've turned into a quieter person (and nobody thought it was possible). Maybe thats why they think I exculded myself when I went out with them last. Thats not it. I don't feel like I fit in any more, so I'm quieter. I don't want to bitch about anybody and everybody, so I stay quiet. Ok, so I'll react when I see somebody walking around in rolled up jeans and slouch boots (because they are fashion victims... and they're usually sheep too). And the people I hang around with usually find it funny. But I don't and will never bitch about my friends behind their back.   These people say that it's ok cos they don't just bitch behind peoples backs, they tell it to their face. No. They don't. If anything, they talk through their computer screens so as not to get a punch in the face. They would all look like rugby players if they told everybody what they were saying about them behind their backs because they would be beaten up. And they know it. It's sad when people get like that... cowardly.  I'm going now. I think I've moaned enough. xx

      Hey, I just got back from the cinema. :-) It was gooood. Lois and I saw Shrek 2. It was so funny. After the film Lois and I went into McDonalds, and this guy said "Hey, can I have a strawberry milkshake" so the guy behind the counter said "what flavour would you like?" lol me and Lois found that quite funny, but I didn;t want to offend the guy behind the counter so I kind of just smirked at him. lol.  Lois wants me to go to ATC. She said it would be fun, but I don't know because of transport- I have no way of getting there or back. Oh well. There's always something stopping me. I would love to go because it seems quite fun (from what Lois and Hannah say). Well, we'll see.   See you around. Bye...

      Hey, Why can't I get the thought of certain people out of my head? It's seriously annoying now. It's almost getting to the point where I'm thinking about a particular person 90% of the time that I'm awake.  Perhaps that's just cos ofsheer boredom, I don't know.  It's like, when I'm watching a film, and it gets boring, my mind wonders. Or when I'm sat thinking about suff, my mind wonders... And it wonders to the same person everyday.   It's not fair, why can't I just forget it?  I hope this doesn't happen at the cinema today. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Yay I'm going cinema with Lois!!!  I haven't been to the cinema in ages. We're going to meet at the sundial and walk down to the cinema and see whatever is on. :-D  Tori's back tomorrow. I'm sooo excited. She came online the other day, and I got all emotional. I dunno why. Maybe because I haven't spoken to her in around 3 weeks, maybe because I was feeling fragile from an arguement I had just had.  I don't know why I felt fragile. But I do feel like if i see the bitch that upset me then I'm gonna smack her so hard. It probably wont hurt her though. My slap is weak. Either that or I'll miscalculate and it wont have the desired painful effect. Trust me, it's happened often enough already!  See ya

      Hiya. I've just had my hair cut. It's not that much shorter, it was just a trim to get rid of the dry ends. Anyway, I really like it. I got it feathered slightly too so that it shapes around my face more so now when I wear my hair down it should look better.  I'm going cinema tomorrow with Lois :-). I really hope I don't see any of my old friends because I really can't be bothered with them any more. That means all of them. I'd rather be a loner, keep myself to myself and not have to bitch in a big group when the ringleader has a problem with one of her lemmings.  I always feel better writing this "Journal". I feel better telling it to a computer screen and sorting out my problems for myself, instead of talking to people because most of the people I talk to say "Oh, just ignore them, you're better than that". But it's easier said than done... and besides, I don't  want  to ignore them. If I had my way, they would all know how much I hate the lot of them. But there's something inside me that's stopped me. I guess thats slightly hypocritical, but it's how I feel. I've been called a follower, a sheep, a loner, a loser by the ugliest slutiest most stuck up bitches I know. Nice.  I mean, I've only just started believing that I'm "better" than them. I've been told it by my mum but she's biased... my best friend told me that I'm better than them too, but I guess I didn't believe her either, I guess I thought she was just saying it to cheer me up. I have low confidence, and I guess it shows and my  old  friends have seen that they can take advantage of that.  I keep thinking "Oh, what if this happened, or what if that happened" instead of what actually happened in reality. But I think I need to stop doing that because there's no point in thinking about what could have happened. It's the past and nobody can change it.  "The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out/ Screws Fall Out" by Less Than Jake  You told me that your 20 years have gone by much too fast And you've been hoping this year will be better than the last You said you've been waging a war against the lonliest of nights With the strongest drinks and longest lines It's not that big a surprise That you're feeling more dead than alive You're feeling more dead than alive  So I'll let you know  If you need, somewhere to go I'll be listening when you call And I'll bre there if you fall off If you need someone to believe in you, I'll let you know I will  You said the hole in your head has gotten bigger than the hole that's in your chest And you're stuck between the past and present tense You said you've been waging a war against so many years of lies With stronger drinks and longer lines It's not that big a surprise That you're feeling more dead than alive You're feeling more dead than alive  So I'll let you know  If you need, somewhere to go I'll be listening when you call And I'll bre there if you fall off If you need someone to believe in you, I'll let you know I will  But sometimes you gotta let it go, gotta let it go.  So this pen is starting to become  A pipe bomb and these songs  Have turned to anthems again To everything that's changed and to everything that's gone away Here are my condolences to the future I never met It's gone and never coming back, it's not coming back So don't hold onto your past, you gotta let it go  'Cause friends leave as time fades away The people and the places along the way Without a doubt  Screws fall in and screws they fall out  Tomorrow's gone up in smoke  And I wonder when I'm all alone Where'd my convictions go So to everyone thats gone away Or fades away or stays the same Here are my apologies to the person that I used to be Before I burned down every bridge and every inch Of everything I used to know, I gotta let it go  Friends leave as time fades away  The people and the places along the way So don't hold onto your past No, it's never coming back, you gotta let it go.

      Hmmm... my plans for the rest of the week are: today- get a haircut at 2pm thursday- go to cinema with Lois at 12pm friday- maybe go and see "Joker" (a local band) 9pm saturday- go to a wedding sunday- nothing planned yet. Might bug Tori til she agrees to meet me (and maybe Lois) so we can catch up.  Thats the most I've had to do in a while, lol. Since exams have finished, I don't have to go back to school until 3rd September, and it's quite boring for me because I don't really do that much :-(. It gets boring after a while, just sat at home. Especially when it rains. Because then I   have  to stay indoors, or catch a cold.   I've tried looking for a job but I kinda gave up due to lack of interest (of the people that I asked for a job). For example, I would go into a shop and ask if they're looking for work and they'd just say "No" and I would feel really stupid... ick.  I've grown quite... conscious (sp?) that I have little or no social life, because it's drummed into me by a bitch who used to like me. I have to say, I've never  really  liked her, but thats not the point. And she doesn't know that. She went up to my sister and said "Your sister thinks I love her, but I don't". I just laughed when my sister told me because she really has no idea. And she says her "level" is much higher than mine. I don't really care though cos she talks shit a lot of the time. And her head is so far up her ass that she needs a glass stomach to see properly.  I'm starting to bitch. I don't like it when I bitch. Bye

      Today it's sunny, so I decided to sit in the garden for an hour or so. I'm going to have redish stripes down the front of my legs soon. (The backs of my legs are  white , lol. But I don't care). It was quite relaxing. I read Kerrang! magazine and I started a book called "Secrets" by Danielle Steel. It's about an actress in Hollywood... it's not bad so far I guess.  So I have until 3rd September off and not much planned. Thats my monotonous life for you... although I'm going to the cinema with a friend of mine on thursday and a wedding on saturday :-) I had to go and get an outfit for it yesterday. I saw my ex and it kinda made me jump because I haven't seen him in 3 months. I didn't say anything to him. My mum (who I was with) doesn't know I went out with him so I kinda didn't dwell on it. He didn't see me, but I told him online last night. I'll post that part of the convo cos it's quite funny in an awkward kinda way:  Me: I think I saw u today Friend: k Friend: where Me: in town Friend: when Me: today... Friend: what time 2day Me: um... i dunno... y? Me: it was between 10 and 12 I think... Me: it might have been someone else tho... Friend: might have been me Friend: i was in town then  lol   I'm addicted to eating mint. Not the sweets, the plant. One of our neighbours gave us some in exchange for fresh fish ( :-S ) and it is really nice and really addictive.  Well I'm going to go now.  Bye PS. Def Leppard Rock

      Hey... I'm just your average 16 year old English girl... only I seem to have managed to piss ALL of my closest friends off, so now I feel isolated, bored and  alone . It's not a particularly nice feeling. And I don't even know what I've done. I haven't had anything to do with these people for 3 months, and still they're having a pop at me.   I had to delete a previous journal (not on here) because they practically spammed my journal with comments. I don't mind the odd one or two messages, but there were loads. And they would never say anything nice, and always find something to criticise about my post. I got fed up with feeling that I had to respond to them so I deleted the journal completely.  One ofthe girls only just realised last night, and IMed me... we started arguing, she signed off and I felt like a bag of crap. Her ex-boyfriend came online and he cheered me up so much. :-)  I know that in the past when they've invited me places, I haven't been the loudest person there, and sometimes I felt excluded. They blame that on me. They say I exclude myself, just because I'm quiet. They are   loud  though. When they walk into a room, they take control of it.  We had a sixth form induction day, and the popular girls sat behind me, I sat further back than this group of people that I've been talking about. The nicest one in the group decided to dye her hair pink, the ones that are annoyed at me have the underneath of their hair bright red/ pink. The "popular" people decided to take the piss. At the time, I felt like I should have been defending them, because the "popular" people are so stuck up. But I said nothing, and it kinda looked like they had upset this girl. They said "Oh 'so-and-so' weren't we going to dye your hair pink?" and the girl sat next to her said "Yeah, but not if it turns out like  that " which I thought was a really mean thing to say.  I think thats enough for a first post. I'll update soon. If you've read this, feel free to leave a comment to say hi.  Bye.
