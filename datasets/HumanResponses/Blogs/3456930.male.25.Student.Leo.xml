      It just dawned on me about 5 minutes ago that I no longer have a home.  "What are you on about you crazy mofo?" some of you may be wondering. "What about where you're living?". Yes yes... I do have a home here in Newcastle, but I no longer have a "Home" (with a capital H). I no longer have a place that I know is intrinsically mine. Some place where I KNOW I can go to anytime. Day or night.  My parents have moved and they are selling the house that has been a part of my life for the last 13 years. Yeah yeah, so what? You may ask. It's not like it's your ancestral home or anything. It's not like it's been in your family for X amount of generations. Yes, that IS true but it still doesn't stop the fact that I have developed a sentimental attachment to it. Sure, it's only a brick and mortar house. But some of my most defining moments of my life have happened in that house. It was the place where I threw my first party. Where my friends would come 'round to visit and hang out. Where I admitted my feelings to my 'first true love'. It's the memories that go along with that little 3 bedroom place in Calala. On top of that, it's the first time I've ever lived somewhere that wasn't rented. It was our (my) home. And now some fuckhole strangers are gonna move in and it's no longer going to be mine.  So I no longer have a home. Once my parents buy a house in Grafton it'll be weird because I'll have no idea where it will be and it'll all be new and crap. I'll be a stranger in a strange town.  Hmmm... that'd make a good movie. All I'd need would be a motorcycle and a shotgun....   Lowman X, out.   Listening to: "Lateralus" - Tool.

      Finished another long day today. Didn't get to bed/sleep til about 12:30-1:00am this morning then had to get up at 5am to get to work by 7. Ugh... so I didn't get too plastered last night. Even so, I still felt decidedly seedy this morning. Anyways, it was only a 3 hour shift and I finished at 10am. So I'm sitting there, drinking my 'staffie' coke, when Dave (one of the guys who works there) plonks a 'birthday pint' of black in front of me and says "For yesterday, because you buggered off before I could buy you one". 10am people!!! So I drank it. Very very slowly. Just about finished it when Bill, another one of the guys who works there, plonks another pint of black in front of me. "Happy birthday for yesterday, mate. I didn't know..." to which I responded with "Cheers Bill. Yeah, I tried to keep it on the low side". Had just finished that one when Doug, one of the regulars, puts ANOTHER pint of black in front of me. So, in the space of about 40 minutes, I've drunk 3 pints, on an empty, and decidedly uneasy, stomach. It's not yet 11am and I'm slurring my speech and feeling a little festive. Finish the third pint and then a schooner arrives from one of the other reguklars... at yhh this pont arm shlurring my shpeech and freeeeeling VERRRY drunk *hic*.  Drink it they say. So I drink it. By this time, the little bit of my brain that still contains rational thought surmises that everyone's trying to get me tanked and tells the rest of my brain to finish the beer and leave. Go home and sleep it says in its "I'm on my soapbox" voice. Funnily enough, the rest of my drunken brain riots and I haven't seen that rational bit since. I suspect he's lying in a ditch somewhere....  So I have another beer, vowing to myself that this will be the last. Hey, I'm no drunk and I have people I need to impress at dinner tonight. I don't want to turn up for dinner drunk and smelling like a brewery...    Eventually, I leave the pub. 3 hours after I finish. 4 pints and 3 schooners later. I'm holding my own against the footpath that threatens me with a painful slap in the face if I take a wrong step. I'm glaring at the ground, daring it. "Bring it on bitch" I mumble at it... people look at me strangely. I glare back. Good thing I'm wearing my work uniform with my pub's logo on it otherwise I think I may have been in trouble with some toothless skanky chick at the bus stop.  I have to powerwalk from the bus stop to my house because my bladder decides, at the most inopportune time, to suddenly realise that it's OVER full. Just make it. Have sobered up considerably. This is one benefit of having a stupidly fast metabolism. The downside is that I need to piss every 5 minutes when I drink. The upside is that I have the physique of a really tall rake with no chance of getting fat - no matter what I eat.   The downside is that I look like a really tall rake.  I sleep for a couple of hours until I get picked up to go to dinner. Feeling seedy again. Bugger. Haven't had an opportunity to do an A.G.B.   Can't stop farting. Mexican food and alcohol from the previous night is playing havoc with my inards.   Spend all night holding in farts. It's now 11:14pm and I feel crook from holding in said farts all night. I'm now letting them go with reckless abandon...  Uh oh... be right back...  *A couple of minutes pass*  Nope, I'm all good. *Grin* Heh heh heh...     Because, you know, you needed to know all this, right?    Stalker girl called by last night to wish me happy birthday. Wouldn't leave. Had to literally escort her home. Well, to her street at least. Won't take a hint it seems. Came round again tonight while I wasn't here....  Came up with a new word for faeces. Buttmud. Heh heh heh... pretty catchy, hey? You know what you're going to do now, don't you? Every time you need to go, you won't be able to wipe your ass without thinking "Heh heh... buttmud". I bet ya anything that's what happens. And I want 2 cents every time the word is used. LOL  Need to do something about Stalker Girl. She's starting to get on my nerves considerably. Is it my fault I'm the only person she knows in Newcastle? Not fucking likely. Go and get some new friends ya freak! Have decided to put this dog out of its misery first thing in the morning.   Feel the need to rearrange my bedroom again. Or at least change around the way I have my posters and artwork displayed on the walls. Try and make it better somehow. Thinking of putting up my Grad Show work... might look good.... see what happens though.    Anyways, I'm beat, so I'll go to bed now. Talk to you all soon.  Lowman X, out.

      Thanks to everyone who sent/texted/called/emailed/yelled/screamed birthday wishes to me. Makes an old man feel good. *Grin*  Was getting a little freaked out when I hadn't heard from my parents first thing this morning. Was expecting a 5:30am wake up call. But, as I found out, my parents were busy unpacking their belongings in Grafton. Yep. They've finally moved. The house has been on the market for a week and a half and it looks like it'll be sold by the end of next week. So they've done it. They've taken the first step to... well... the coast. Hmmm... not really the first step. More like the last, I suppose. But, anyways, they've finally done it. So that explains the lack of communication.  Okay, I know what you're all asking: "Shut up with the thanks and tell us what ya scored!!".   Well, I got a REALLY REALLY nice watch. Let's just say that it was expensive and leave it at that, shall we? BLOODY nice watch! And I got a hooded, zip-up, jumper. I don't know the official name of it but it's something you'd get from General Pants. That sort of thing. It's really really nice too. I've been looking at something like that for a while. So now I'll be able to say that I'm now hip and cool. And really mean it! LOL  My flatmates are taking me out to dinner tonight but, unfortunately, I can't get absolutely wasted because I have to be up at 5am tomorrow to start work at 7am. Tough luck for me...   Mum feels bad that they didn't get me anything but, really, I'm not too worried. Just as long as their happy. That's what counts. Besides, I know that I can use it as blackmail material for the next 5 years at least. *evil grin* No, seriously, I'm just glad they finally did something about the itchy feet...  But seriously... 5 years. Oh yeah. I can see the stuff I can wrangle out of them already... LMAO  Anyways, I gotta go to uni now so I'll talk to you all later.   Lowman X, out.

      And now I wait my whole lifetime for you, And now I wait my whole lifetime for you,  I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you, I search the outside, search inside for you,  To take back what you left me, I know I'll always burn to be, The one who seeks so I may find, And now I wait my whole lifetime,  Outlaw of torn, Outlaw of torn, And I'm torn...  So on I wait my whole lifetime for you, So on I wait my whole lifetime for you,  The more I search, the more my need for you, The more I bless, the more I bleed for you,  You make me smash the clock and feel, I'd rather die behind the wheel, Time was never on my side, So on I wait my whole lifetime, Outlaw of torn, Outlaw of torn, Outlaw of torn, And I'm torn...  Hear me... And if I close my mind in fear, Please pry it open, See me... And if my face becomes sincere, Beware... Hold me... And when I start to come undone, Stitch me together, Save me... And when you see me strut, Remind me of what left this outlaw torn...  -Metallica

      It's come to my attention that some people may have mistakenly thought my birthday was a few days ago (what with the last post I put up). I'd just like to point out that it wasn't my birthday then. It's actually on the 28th. Which is... oh, hang on... is right now actually! Yay! Happy birthday to me!  Well, technically I have several more hours to wait until I am officially over the line but I don't see me dying between now and then.

      It comes with the tenacity of a Scottish Terrier and the unstoppable power of a freight train. It comes bearing down and there's nothing I can do about it except accept my fate with good humour and just a touch of chagrin.  Yes, it's that time of my life my friends. My 25th birthday. A quarter of a century old. Half of 50. Holy crap. I look back and think "Where the hell did this come from??". This certainly isn't due for a couple of years yet, surely? But then reality gives me a quick kick to the head and says "Nup, you're here man. Better make the best of it!".  So what have I learnt in the 25 years I have been on this planet? Hmmm... tough question.   Well, I suppose one thing is, to quote Good Charlotte: "Some friends become enemies, some friends become family...".   It's easier to hate than it is to forgive.  Falling in love is easier than falling out of love.  Money (most certainly) makes the world go 'round.  80s music rocks (sometimes).  Change is inevitable and anyone who doesn't adapt to change dies (both metaphorically and literally speaking).  Sometimes you HAVE to lie and sometimes you HAVE to face up to the music.  Moving for a woman sometimes works out (in mysterious ways).  Life is never as you left it 5 minutes ago.  Women are a fickle breed who will NEVER be understood by the males of the species.  Tooheys Old is a great drink. Caprioscas (a vodka drink) are even better.  It's the unknown that makes life interesting.  Everyone needs someone to say "Thanks".  Love, whether it be platonic or 'true love', is one of the best things in the world.  On the same note, love can hurt like a muthafucker.  Blood may be thicker than water, but I'll always want a friend's fist in a fight than a family members' harshly spoken words.  If it can go wrong doesn't mean it will go wrong but there's nothing wrong with preparing for the worst.  True friends are becoming few and far between.  Hang on to the people you care about.  And, finally, just be thankful you're still around.   So that's my soapbox confessional done for the next 25 years. I'll see you all back here on the eve of my 50th.   Lowman X.

      Ugh. What an absolute bitch of a night. 8 and a half hours with no break (yes, illegal, I know), just go go go... I hate the TAB. I hate drunk people. I hate people who play pokie machines. I hate the fact that I was only meant to be on for 4 hours, max, tonight but, because of 120 odd people in the bistro, I had to stay on and miss my last bus and have to fork out money for a bloody taxi.  Yeah, I know. I'm just complaining. But dammit, I think I'm allowed to. I'll just say that it was an absolute c*nt of a night.  On another note, it was good to see Jol and Jas this morning (even if I was still half asleep when they arrived). It was a case of....  J: We're 30 kms out of Newy. We'll be there soon.  D: Cool. Jol and Jas are coming. I'd better get up and - zzzzzzzzzzzzz!  *Car door closes and D wakes with a start*  D: Ah crap... stupid tiredness...   I would really like to thank them both for dropping in on their way up to Armidale. Thanks for the copy of 'Lowside', Jas. And thanks for the poster Jol. If any of you know me, you'll probably know of my fervour for the Crow movie (watched it 9 times in  a 24 hour period when I first saw it). Also, I have declined to donate my organs... just in case I, too, have to rise from the dead to avenge something or other. So Jol thought i would like a Crow poster for my birthday which is coming up on Wednesday. Now I just gotta find some place to put it...  Also, thanks HEAPS for the fleecy vest. It's bloody fantastic!  Anyways, that's me done for the evening. I am absolutely shot so I'm just gonna go to bed and sleep the sleep of the dead.   Lowman X   "Nothing! You say! Matters! To us!"

      Well, just got the confirmation email from the government that my passport has been processed and will be sent out to me via registered post and will get to me early next week.  I'm glad that's finalised. Something else I can cross off my list.  Was a little worried that I'd have to get new photos done because when I went in to hand in the form the bearded lady (I shit you not, she had a beard!!) behind the counter was making a bit of a kerfuffle about the photo being too far away and that my head didn't fill up the whole photo.   Yeah, fuck you too bitch. Bring it on.  All I have to do now is finish up my CV, get a JP signed copy of my passport, get 2 references from teachers that I've worked with (on school-headed stationery), a JP signed copy of my qualifications (uni degree etc etc), proof of address (front page of a bill or something), and fill out the registration pack.  Already have the police check. Just as I thought, no criminal thingamees against my name. I'm as clean as a whistle. So does that make me a good guy or just plain boring?  Anyways, once I get those done and sent off to Global Ed I'll have me a job at the end of the year. Oh yeah. Mind you, that hasn't stopped them from ringing me up last week and offering me 5 full-time teaching positions in England already. Starting in September. One problem fellas, I don't finish my course til the end of November...

      I have come to the conclusion that I am a Driver. I can't handle being a Passenger.   What brought me to this conclusion was a number of things that have occurred over the last couple of days. Well, these things actually cemented my opinion as I already had a pretty good idea that I am a Driver.  The first thing was being a Passenger in a car that was being driven by my flatmate, Matt. Now, I have nothing against Matt and his driving other than the fact he tends to drive like an old lady. Way too cautious and not a lot of forethought about where he's going and the like. Like I said, I have nothing too bad against it. I'm just finicky.   The second incident, and the one that is the more important of the two, happened tonight on my way home from uni. Bronny, a girl from my course, gave me a lift home. Basically, we almost had a rather nasty accident because she's not overly confident about her driving. And when you drive a 35 year old Valiant that is nothing short of being an APC on the front line, you REALLY need to be confident about your skills. The imaginary brake was being stomped on quite vigorously on the trip home. Particularly when she went to change lanes and almost took out a little plastic two door hatch.   I think what it comes down to is that I like to be in control. I need to be in control. I need to have some say into how I'm going to live and die. If I'm behind the wheel and I'm the Driver, then at least I know if anything happens it'll be my own damn fault and not someone else's.  I know I'm a Driver. Others should remain Passengers and let me do the driving. We'll get there quicker and with fewer injuries.   People who flip their cars on the M4 should particularly remain as passengers or keep to public transport.

      I thought it about time that I said my two cents worth about this.  Now, we've all heard about this $3000 grant that the government is giving to new mothers, right? For those of you who have been living under a rock for the last 6 months or so I'll re-cap:  Basically, for every baby born on or after July 1, 2004, the government will give the parent/s $3000. For each baby! A breeding payment so to speak.   Now, besides this just being a political stunt by the Liberal party to stay in power (hey, the election is coming up soon), it's also just plain stupid, ill-conceived, and even more badly executed! The people who would benefit the most from this should be the people who struggle on or below the poverty line, low-income workers, people who can't afford to take maternity leave etc etc etc....  Unfortunately, it's these same people who will get the grant and piss it right up the wall. Not all of them (I'm not going to generalise THAT much), but a fair chunk of them, I'll bet. And the main reason for this? Because they're also the same ones who have, for whatever reasons, little or no education and can't see past their next dole payment. I know quite a number of people who have gotten pregnant so they can get this benefit. And you know the worst thing about it? Most of them are below the age of 18. Yes, we're going to see an influx of teenage mothers and all because the government is run by a bunch of dickheads. I know of one girl already who is planning on buying a TV, stereo, and an Xbox with the money. When asked about what she was going to buy the baby it was replied with: "Nothin'. I'll just use me dole for that shit." And you want to know how old this girl is? 16. Yep. Fucking 16!! Does anyone else see this whole thing is a very bad fucking idea??? Or am I the only one? The people who WILL use it responsibly are the ones who really don't need it. Middle to upper class families. Most of them plan on opening savings accounts etc etc etc.... for their 'precious' kids. And you want to know why? BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED THE FUCKING MONEY IN THE FIRST BLOODY PLACE!!!! If they did they wouldn't be putting it 'away'. They'd be buying prams, cots, diapers, and other shit.  This is all too friggin' wrong!!! Once again, Howard has managed to give his upper-crust wanker mates a hand up while driving the lower classes further into the ground. The most disturbing thing is going to be all the fucked up kids that are going to be reaching adolescence in 15 or so years. Will they be properly educated? Probably not. Will I have to try and teach them? More than likely. Will it be a futile mess? I can almost guarantee it. Will society go even more to shit? Yep, with no brake to stop the out of control vehicle....  Society's fucked people. Get out while you still can.   Lowman X.

      I still find it deplorable that the government refuses to subsidise the 'quit smoking' stuff like patches, inhalers, gum etc. As I've said before, it just proves my point that the government doesn't really want people to quit. Smokers bring in far too much revenue. If I was in government I'd put forward the proposal that all the quit smoking stuff would go onto the pharmecutical benefits fund. That way, smokers will get a better deal.  I say: bring the cost of a packet of nicotine patches down to $10.00 and I reckon you'd see FAR less smokers around. As it is, I am one of the people out there that buy patches anyways. It costs me about $30-35 per packet but I do know it is worth it. A packet of cigarettes cost about $9.50 - 10.00 (also dependant on what you actually smoke too). Now, multiply that by about 5 and that's how much a week I used to spend on cigarettes. A packet of patches lasts for 7 days. I do know that it is definitely worth it. I think the catch of it is that with the patches you fork out the $30-35 in one hit whereas, with the smokes, it's a smaller amount so it lulls you into thinking that it's not as expensive.  But it's all a moot point anyways. I mean, seriously, why would the government give a damn? Smokers are one of the major revenue raisers in the country. It doesn't matter that they die at a higher rate than the average non-smoker. Most smokers die of diseases that are quick killers so they don't hang around too long draining the medical budget. It's better for the government if these hapless individuals die young than old because then the government will REALLY have to look after them as they get the pension and the population ages more and more rapidly. As it is, Australia has a population that is too old, while the younger population don't want to breed to help pour money into the government's coffers.  So what it comes down to is this: Smokers die. Younger. If the smokers die then it means the government doesn't have to support them when they're sitting around wearing old people diapers on the pension. The government saves money. It's all cost-effective.   Lowman X.

      The cool thing about tonight was that it was one of my crappy jokes that got me drunk.   We (Matt, Banno, and myself) were at the Kent for trivia night. We were going decidedly average tonight I must say. usually we kick veritable butt. Anyways, that's beside the point. During the night, they have sections where you can win free jugs of beer. The last one of these 'win a free jug' things was a joke one. You had to write down a joke and the best one won a free jug. My baby harp seal joke won out...  (One for the hippie tree-huggers)  "A baby harp seal walks into a club....."  Jimmy (the guy who runs the trivia gig) laughed his ass off. So we won. Oh yeah!  So now I'm (still) drunk.    LX.

      Well, here I am, back at the start of a new blog.  Dammit. I still can't believe what happened with the old one. All because of a sensitive touch pad and an itchy button finger.  Nevermind. It'll teach me to be a bit more careful in the future.  I'm still feeling seedy after last night on the vodka. I have no idea how I'm going to go on my birthday. I WAS planning on going out and getting a little hammered but I think I'm over that idea now. It takes me too long to get back to feeling well again.  Got the first day of second semester tomorrow. I have a few things I need to do, such as: finding out how I can get one of my subjects turned from an 'Incomplete' to a 'passed'. I know why it's an 'I' and not a 'P'. It's because of that last assessment I handed in late. Man, I really hope I don't have to redo that subject because it'll mean that I have to do it again next year, which then means I don't head to the UK at the end of the year. Fuck. Stupid stupid stupid!! I'll go and have a talk to my tutorial lecturer and see what needs to be done. I hope it can get sorted out. Otherwise I'm fucked.  Anyways, I gotta go and get some sleep.  Talk to you all soon.   Lowman X.   "I've got to be honest,  I think you know, We're covered in lies,  And that's okay..."  Vertical Horizon - 'You're a God'

      We were informed today that the lecturer for 2 of our 4 lectures is conducting an experiment this year. He's decided this year that he won't be putting the lecture notes on-line, nor his powerpoint presentation. Fair enough I hear some of you saying. Yeah, all well and good I suppose. If ANYONE KNEW WHAT THE FUCK HE WAS ON ABOUT!! It's the lecture notes that allow people to draw a corellation between the readings and the lecture. It allows the students to compare notes they've done during the lecture, the powerpoint presentation/lecture notes from the lecturer, and information gleaned from the required readings. It's this process that develops understanding for the students.  Quality Teaching model.... Higher Order Thinking.... Pedagogy.... all these things, and others I can't remember,  everyone is having trouble with. I know I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it but that's probably because I can't afford to go out and spend almost $200 on some fucking textbooks that I'll use for 10 weeks and never use again. And you can't get them from the library because they're never there anyways!  If I could have a look at the lecture notes (even AFTER the lecture) I might have a better understanding but no, that ain't going to happen apparently. Oh, he's taken note of people's concerns and anger but that ain't going to persuade him. It's apparently so that we will actually do the reading (which I'd do if I could get my hands on a copy). Oh yeah, should I mention that the required text for this one subject, which is about $80, is written by him??  Yes, he is a world leader when it comes to the study of teaching and pedagogies and metalanguages and all that jargon. But just because someone KNOWS a shit load doesn't mean that they're good at getting their students to UNDERSTAND what they're trying to impart. His examples and explanations just leave us even MORE confused than when we came in. And the things that we do get a grasp of end up being COMMON SENSE THINGS ANYWAYS!!!

He's so intellectually advanced (in this context anyways) that he seems to forget that we really have no idea what he's going on about.  Anyways, that's me done for the evening.

      Your words to me just a whisper, Your faces so unclear, I try to pay attention, Your words just disappear...  'cause its always raining in my head... Forget all the thing's I should have said...  So I speak to you in riddles,  'cause my words get in my way.  I smoke the whole thing to my head  And feel it wash away...  'cause i can't take anymore of this,  I wanna come apart... And dig myself a little hole,  Inside your precious heart.  'cause its always raining in my head... Forget all the things I should have said...  I am nothing more than a little boy inside, That cries out for attention, Though I always try to hide... 'cause I talk to you like children, Though I don't know how I feel... But I know I'll do the right thing, If the right thing is revealed...  'Cause its always raining in my head Forget all the things I should have said   -Staind

      Well, today was a good day. Had my friend David come up and visit me from Sydney (no, not my arch nemesis). He had a day off and thought he'd come up to say g'day. Haven't seen him since... about... 1999? 2000? A while anyways. It was really good to catch up with him. He also dropped off some books I lent him so now I can re-read the Wheel of Time series and finally read books 9 and 10.  What else happened today? Hmmm... not a lot. Just worked and then came home and rubbed in the All Blacks' loss to the Wallabies to my flatmate, Matt. He's a Kiwi so it was funny seeing him getting all psycho during the game and jumping around and everything. And then they lost. LOL. Yes, much fun was had by all.  Deciding on whether I should sell all my stuff before I leave for the UK. Like my bed, bookshelf, fridge, lounges etc etc etc... wondering if I'd get much money for them. See what happens closer to the day. If I don't I'll have to decide on what to do with them. Like where will I store it all? What can I palm off to my parents/friends etc.  Have noticed that my house gets REALLY dusty REALLY quickly. Like, stupidly dusty.  Anyways, I'm off to read for a while.   Lowman X, out.

      Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the stoush of the century! It's the US of A championship of the world!  In the black as oil corner, and just as greasy, weighing in at a feather weight somethin-or-other pounds.... GEORGE "DON'T FUCK WITH MY DADDY" W BUSH!!!  And his challenger for the evening, in the red, white, and blue corner we have, weighing in at something-or-other pounds.... MICHAEL MOORE!!!  LLLLLLLLLET'S...... GET READY TO RUUUUUUUUMBLE!!!!!!!!    Yes, as you can probably guess, I just got back from seeing Moore's latest offering "Farenheit 9/11" and I gotta say, even though, yes, it is biased, and yes, we do all know he wants Bush out of the White House as soon as possible come hell nor high water, his documentary was a definite eye-opener. Fuck, I don't even know where to begin.  Some of the file footage like the public beheading, the young Iraqi child with half his head stitched up and crying out as they tried to stitch up the top of his head, the napalmed people, the dead bodies... what can I say? It's all fucked up. Moore gets his message across and he's as subtle as a brick in the head (or as in the case of some of the people, shrapnel). The thing is, it takes this sort of slap to the face to get people to wake up and smell the proverbial "napalm in the morning".   Homeland Security? What a fucking joke! For a country supposedly built on the freedom of people those citizens were all too quick to let their rights be signed away.  And the opening sequence where not one single senator would sign the forms about thousands of African-American people not being allowed to vote in the election that Al Gore actually won. What's up with that?? What the fuck is wrong with this world people??  I am scared. I am truly fucking scared. And not because of all the "acts of terrorism". I'm scared because I'm seeing a world becoming more and more ignorant of what's happening around them and living in a constant state of fear because of a few dickheads with delusions of granduer!  I'm training to be a teacher. What the fuck do I say to these kids when they ask me "why"? What's my answer? Because the world's a screwed up place that's being run by screwed up people? Despite the fact that it's the truth, I won't be able to say it. Why? Because of the few people with all the fucking power. That's why. Just look at the school that's getting screwed over because they entered the Rock Eistedford with a routine that asks questions about Bush and Howard and the whole "War on Terror". A few conservative wankers are up in arms about it. Oh boo hoo! Why don't the influential minority just fuck off and actually listen to the majority for once? Because that's not actually how a democracy works apparently. It isn't the majority that makes decisions, it's the rich minority. Well, from me, go fuck yourselves you ignorant, blind, money-hungry, fucking tools!   Lowman X, out.    "A dictatorship'd be easier." -G W Bush.

      Jesus H Fucking Christ!!!  Well, this is a pain in the arse! Went to uni and tried to access my blog from the network there. Unfortunately, it did something to my password which has then made it not let me into my own blog!! Support tried to help me and it worked for a bit and then all today it wouldn't let me in again. Now it seems to be working again... fuck me gently with a chainsaw!  Make up your friggin' mind!!   Lowman X, out.   "Spinnin' outta control, outta control!!

      I've been up since 3:30am. I kept waking on the hour until I couldn't handle having the same dream anymore so I stayed awake and then went to work at 6am. Worked until 2:30pm, came home with a migraine, and then slept, doped up on Ibobrufen (or however you spell it) and slept until 8 this evening.  Have been having trouble with my blog. Password became invalid after trying to access it via the university's network yesterday. Such a pain in the ass.  Was the same dream again. Time after time. Why won't it just leave me be? What is it? Why can't my sub-conscious thought be in minds with my conscious thought? What do I need to do to finish it, once and for all? I'm sick of waking up on random occasions and feeling like shit for days afterwards. Why does my mind insist on making me relive it time and again? What haven't I learnt from that time? What lesson still eludes me? The lesson of forgiveness? Vengeance? Hate? Love? I wish my brain could talk and let me know....  I feel like seeing that movie "something something of the Spotless Mind". You know the one, with Jim Carey and the Titanic chick, Kate Winslet? Winslow? Wow, my brain is really muddled at the moment because of the migraine. It's mostly passed now but I still have a throbbing head that hurts every time I cough.  I need to eat now. Am rather hungry.

      Well, this is going to be a different Blog. This is going to be the first of a series of CD reviews. I’m not going to just review new albums/songs either (hell, I’m a poor uni student for fuck’s sake!!), I’m also going to go back and pick some ‘classic’ ones and give you all my two-cents worth.  So in that vein, I give to you, my hapless victims, my first review:  Album: “Load” Artist: Metallica Released: 1996 Genre: Hard Rock Producer/s: Bob ‘pansy pants’ Rock with James Hetfield & Lars Ulrich Tracks: 14 Track Listing: 1.	Ain’t My Bitch 2.	2X4 3.	The House Jack Built 4.	Until It Sleeps 5.	King Nothing 6.	Hero Of The Day 7.	Bleeding Me 8.	Cure 9.	Poor Twisted Me 10.	Wasting My Hate 11.	Mama Said 12.	Thorn Within 13.	Ronnie 14.	The Outlaw Torn   Almost this entire album was a departure of everything everyone assumed Metallica was about. To start with, they changed the style of the way ‘Metallica’ had always been written with the distinctive knife-like points. It was like, from the outset, this album (and the follow-up, ‘ReLoad’) would be their “mid-life crisis” album. They’d released the phenomenally selling ‘Black’ album so where to from there? Release a ‘Black’ clone? Try not to live up to the massive expectations? Or try something new? I think it was mainly a combination of the second and third responses…  The artwork, by Andres Serrano (he of ‘Piss Christ’ fame several years ago), is both a pun on the title but also a piece of art that Kirk Hammett loved and talked the rest of the guys into using (they didn’t all agree on Kirk’s taste). Personally, I like it. Yes, it’s blood and semen squeezed between two sheets of glass. Maybe it’s the art student coming out in me (no pun intended) but I think it’s an awesome change of style for a ‘tallica album cover. All the rest had made not-at-all subtle statements from “Kill ‘em All”’s blood covered hammer through to The Lady Justice on “…And Justice for All”. The “Black” album was a touch more subtle but still rather literal with the ‘Don’t Tread On Me’ snake in the bottom corner. The cover art for “Load” had no direct message, and a hell of a lot of people didn’t even realise what the art was made from until they did some research. Some people hated it, others thought it was all right, and others loved it. The reaction to the artwork itself summed up the reaction to the actual music contained inside…  Anyone who was expecting a carbon copy of the “Black” album was going to be disappointed. Anyone who was expecting ‘tallica to go back to their “true” metal ways were going to be very sorely disappointed. This DID take a lot from the “Black” album (song structure, sound, etc etc etc…) but the rest of it was something a little darker but also a little more… grungy? Alternative? Experimental? Deep? Not as heavy? More mature? Maybe all of those and maybe none. Here was Metallica delving into something other than straight out, ‘in your face’, lyrics and music. They experimented with different tones, layering, vocals, and other bits and pieces to see what they could come up with. And they came up with a lot.  The lyrics took on a more personal twist as Hetfield, rather than just singing about physical and literal subject matter, delved into the psyche more. ‘The House Jack Built’, ‘Until it Sleeps’, ‘Thorn Within’ all deal with a psychological issue of some description.   ‘THJB’ is a look into the collapsing world within (perhaps a pre-marker to Hetfield’s stint in rehab in ‘02/’03?) and is asking us to “step inside”, have a look around and see the corruption that resides. ‘UIS’ is about loss and the aggression and angst that accompany this sense of loss (particularly after a loved one walks away). “So tear me open, but beware, there’s things inside without a care…” is a line I think everyone has wanted to say to a dodgy ‘other half’ who’s just fucked them over. And ‘TW’ is about the guilt and how, no matter how much people look at you with disdain, it will always be the shame the individual feels inside themselves that will be the worst part of it all. People can scorn all they like but it’s what the person feels inside that feels the worst. The conscience is a hard master.  The slower songs also took on a deeper meaning as well. These were an extension, I feel, from ‘Nothing Else Matters’ on the “Black” album. It was their first “real” ballad song and they took what they learnt in that experience and extended it into this album. ‘Hero of the Day’ and ‘Mama Said’ said a lot about the band in the sense that they didn’t HAVE to be a heavy unit all the time. They could take a softer approach and get across a different set of meanings. They didn’t have to be in your face all the time and they learnt more about the idea of building the song to a powerful conclusion. ‘HOTD’ starts out almost country like with its twanging, almost clean, tone, Hetfield’s ungrowled vocals, and then builds to a powerful finish.  Then you have the songs like ‘Bleeding Me’, ‘Cure’, ‘Poor Twisted Me’, and the slightly absurd sounding ‘Ronnie’. These are the “unsung” goodies of the album. ‘BM’ has layers of sound that takes you deeper and deeper as you listen. Layer upon layers: simple guitar riffs, bass, drums, synthesiser, vocals - then the chorus kicks in and kicks you in the guts. It takes you from one extreme to the other and drags you along on its merry little ride. ‘Cure’ has a simple rock beat but don’t mistake this for a simple song. Have a listen and see what I mean. Structure-wise this would be one of the more simple songs on the album but that doesn’t stop it from being a fairly good song.  ‘Wasting My Hate’ was the song that was probably the closest to “old-school” Metallica. Fast, aggressive, take-no-shit attitude. But even this was tempered with the new mentality that had infused the entire album. Different tones, sounds, structures, vocals – it all made it sound old yet decidedly new and it was this “newness” that people didn’t, or couldn’t, understand. Rather than just two guitars, bass, drums, and vocals, like the old days, there was multiple layering of guitar tracks, the vocals were played with sound-wise, the lyrics aren’t about hating this or that (as the name may suggest) but about NOT hating something because it just isn’t worth it in the end. It was almost a song about positive, soulful, affirmation. Hold it guys, getting into *shudder* Savage Garden territory there! But it was still “balls hanging out” rock and whatever anyone else thought be damned!  The most excellent song on the album though would have to be ‘The Outlaw Torn’. This is Metallica going back to their old epic ways, touching it up a bit with their new ways, and letting loose on a 9 minute track about pain, love, regrets, shame, pride and revenge. From the slow build up at the beginning to the instrumental-like ending this song just won’t end until you’re left drained from going with the guys on their musical odyssey.  ‘The Outlaw Torn’ pretty much sums up the entire album. It’s an album about love in all it’s guise be they painful, hateful, sorrowful, and any other something-ful you can think of to throw in there.  Overall, the album was better than their other albums in some ways (more mature-minded, deeper psychological subject matter) but left something to be desired in others. As I said, it was Metallica in mid-life crisis mode and this is the end result. An album that, left to its own merits, succeeds very well, but when compared to the expectations left by the “Black” album falls just short of the mark. It would take another 12 years after the release of the “Black” album for them to bring out another album that would once again redefine the hard rock/metal genre and prove to the world that they weren’t a bunch of middle-age Rolling Stone wannabes. They were (and are) a musical force to be reckoned with.  So, in finishing, I hope I haven’t bored you to death with this. If you have any comments, please feel free to leave them on the comments section, and if you own “Load” get it off the shelf, whack it into the CD player and give it a burl. And if you don’t own it, go out and get it.  Rating: 7.5/10

      I have this dreadful feeling that I may not be able to go to the UK at the end of the year. My flight is booked and I'm paying off my ticket (only $718 to go), that's not the problem. The problem is that I'm not really getting enough work to save a decent amount before I go. I find new bills and expenses cropping up at the most inopportune time. When I think I'm finally starting to get ahead something comes along and puts me two steps back.  Example: Uni fees. $173. Textbooks. $200. Bloody house insurance. $133.  This just all in the last couple of weeks. Add on top of these the fact I still need to buy a backpacker's backpack (more convenient than a suticase) which will cost a good few hundred dollars (at least), $718 to go on my ticket, visa, and then save AT LEAST $2000. What with the exchange rate I'm gonna be lucky to get to the UK with 800 pounds.  Yes, I will be basically stepping into work but I will still need to pay for bond and shit when I get there. There may be a few weeks where I won't be working...  Hell, I'll admit it, even my impulsive, devil-may-care side of me is getting worried! And that's enough to get the rational side of me really freaking out!  What the fuck am I supposed to do? I'm not getting enough hours at work and I don't know if getting a second job is achievable or will achieve much. The other frustrating thing is that I live with sociable people who like to go out and do stuff like go to the movies, go drinking yadda yadda yadda. I don't want to seem like a social introvert so I tend to go along as well. I really need to stop doing that. I also need to buy groceries and not get take away so often (tends to happen when you work nights though).  Hell, I need to completely overhaul my entire budget. I need to overhaul my entire way of thinking...   Lowman X, out.   "Here's a quick impression for you: Caw caw! BANG!! Fuck! I'm dead!" -Big Top. 'The Crow'

      I can't feel you anymore... I can't even touch the books you've read. I followed you beneath the stars, Hounded by your memory, And all your raging glory... But now I'm finally free. I kiss goodbye the howling beast That separated you from me. You'll never know the hurt I suffered, Nor the pain I rise above, And I'll never know the same about you, But soon we'll be together In the clasp of oblivion...
