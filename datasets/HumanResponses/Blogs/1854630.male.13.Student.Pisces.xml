      Oh, and another thing. When I die, I want to be cremated, and for my ashes to be put in a cake.   I'm not sure if I can feel clever for thinking that up, because I think I might have heard that someplace else, but forgot about it, so now I think I thought it up myself.  Well that, and its stupid.

      I saw  The Day After Tomorrow.   Good movie. I liked it. Very good special effects.  I'm now a vegetarian.  A few months ago, I discovered  urlLink lifeaftertheoilcrash.net . The site was about a week old, and was very interesting. I read it, and was thoroughly convinced that an Oil Crash would occur in the next couple of years.  For whatever reason, I forgot about it. I don't know why I did, it just didn't seem so important. When I saw this movie, I remembered  urlLink lifeaftertheoilcrash.net , and revisited it, to find that it had grown incredibly. The author of the site now had a book out, which I will be purchasing as soon as possible. Go to the site. Now. Read it with an open mind.   I know that I'm only thirteen, but hear me out. This is important. Read it. If anyone is reading this, go to the site, and please take a few minutes to see what the author has to say.  Please.

      Yeah, I'm not really going to write any more about the weekend. It was boring, but now its over, and theres nothing more to say about it.   ac  said she would call, but hasn't yet. On the phone last night she said she wanted to see a movie today, and I told her that I might not be able to because my family wants to do the whole memorial day thing. My dad really wants to see The Day After Tommorow with me, and I think that I should spend some time with him. Looks like a good movie, anyway.  In other news, Cake's new album,  Pressure Chief  will be released September 7th. Cake rocks, people. Go buy their music.

      Its a weird thing about blogging. This whole weekend, in my mind, was just something to write in the blog about. I don't mean that when I got back home (two hours ago or so) I thought, "Wow, this weekend had some great material for the blog." No, while it was happening, I was thinking that I would be writing about it. I was writing a rough draft in my head, trying to find which words best fit the situation, in what way I could express how I felt at the time.  There I was, on the beach, getting burnt to a crisp by the sun. I was building a sandcastle, desperately running back and forth from the wet sand to a bit higher up on the shore where I was building my castle wall. The tide was getting closer and closer to the wall with each wave, the water looked like Poseidon's arms reaching to bring my castle to its demise. Yet still I built my castle higher and higher, testing the strength of man against the forces of nature. At last it looked as if I had won, I reigned victorious in the everlasting battle between humanity and the elements.  The war ended at a convientent time, a man and his son began to walk toward me and my family (who were higher still up the shore). After a few seconds I identified them to be the boy who was having the Bar Mitzvah, the reason my family had driven up this weekend, and his father. They had come to greet the out-of-towners all staying at the hotel. They walk over to my mom, and soon after she calls me over.  "Dave, honey, come say hi to the  d 's!" I walk over, realizing that I haven't seen this guy in about six years. "Oh hey Dave," his dad says. The Bar Mitzvah boy is very clean cut. He's wearing a hat, but I can see his hair spiked up in the front, and very short sideburns. He has And-1 shorts on, some sort of basketball shirt on, and what look to be expensive basketball shoes. He's very tan, and is about six feet tall.  On the other hand, I'm shirtless, pale, and covered in sand. I'm a pretty scrawny guy, and don't really feel comfortable with my shirt off around people. For the past year or so, my nipples have been rather puffy, and I'm really self-conscious about it. It might just be puberty, I don't know. The point is, I was feeling very uncomfortable as my mom and his dad were chatting away.  "Oh, Dave plays the guitar too," my mom says. "Really?  a  hasn't been practicing as much as he should. Do you really like it, Dave?"  a 's father asks. "Oh, um, yeah," I said looking at the ground. "So what sports are you into?" his dad asks me.  I hate that question. I'm not very athletic. I don't play any organized sports. Sure, I play basketball and ride bike at my friend's houses, but I'm not in any organized league.  "Oh, I'm not playing any sports right now," I hear myself mumbling, the best thing I can come up with at the time.   This ackward questioning goes on for about ten minutes until the  d 's have to go talk to other people. With that over with, I decide to go in the ocean and cool off for a while.  Fighting the forces of nature is hard work.  I'm wading in the water, feeling the waves lift me up, when I look over at my sand castle, and gasp. Its gone. All of it. Completely destroyed. I see a mound of wet sand where once stood a luxiorious castle. At this point, theres usually only one thing to do.  I closed my eyes, and let the waves carry me back to shore. I claw at the sand, mumbling nonsense to myself. I hear my mom yelling something, but continue. I'm on my stomach, pulling myself higher onto the shore. I open my eyes, and look up, to see a thirty-something year old woman sitting in a chair laughing at me. What are the odds that I'm beached right in front of her chair? Really. I stand up and go back into the water, letting the sand fall off my body.  Alright, I'm going to be honest. I can't write any more about this right now. Theres only so much I can write before my writing turns into total crap. I think I crossed that line a few paragraphs ago. In conclusion, go read the Doonesbury comic today. God bless our troops.   Or something like that.

      "As mentioned in a previous announcement, we will be conducting hall sweeps starting today. You've had all year to figure out how to get to class on time. The gig is up people, you're too old to cut the mustard," the mounted PA box crackled.  Our principal is always trying to use hip phrases to better connect with the students, so this 'mustard' reference wasn't too off the wall. I had accepted it, and so had most of the other students, but I knew what would be coming--  "Did he just say "CUT THE MUSTARD?" asked an overweight guy in front of me with a hearty chuckle. This is the guy who makes stupid jokes about anything that happens, anything that anyone says, and is the only one who laughs at his own jokes.   Yes, he said cut the mustard. You know what he meant, just drop it.   "No no," piped our teacher, an elderly lady with an odd vocabulary, always using words like 'slew' instead of 'bunch.' "'Cut the mustard' is an old saying used when the speaker wants to express the fact that someone is too feeble to make an incision in mustard, which  you all probably know is a soft material."  "Not MY mustard," the same guy retorted. "Mine's CHUNKY!" exclaimed with a Beavis-and-Butthead-esque laugh.  And that was yesterday.  Today was one of those uneventful thursdays. Tommorow is friday, but I'm not really looking foward to the weekend. My family is driving up to a family friends' son's Bar Mitzvah. We get back Sunday! I can hardly contain my excitement! Three fun-filled days of family, people I don't know, and I'm guessing there will be blintzes involved.  I have no idea how to spell blintzes. Oh well.

       ac : Are you sure you don't like  kg ?  me : Yeah, I'm sure. I feel pretty bad about it though. I really don't want to hurt her feelings...  ac : So do you like anyone else? Anyone at all?  You! I like you! You you you!   me : why is it always about who I like? what about who do YOU like?  Nice move.   ac : Me? No one...  She doesn't like me... I wasn't expecting it anywa-   ac : Or maybe I just won't tell you.  What sort of games are you playing, woman?   me : Oh darn. Wait, don't you like that  hd  guy?  No, she doesn't. Whatever. Just make conversation.   ac : No way!  Alright, I believe you. I think I'll just keep being a shmuck about it though.   me : Whatever you say.  ac : I'm serious!  me : Its okay... I'm not gonna say anything...  ag : I really can't... I mean, I'm not even sure...  What are you talking about? You can't what?   me : you really cant what?  ac : I really can't tell you... it would ruin everything.  No it wouldn't. Tell me!   ac : Sort of...  me : I really dont think it would, but I'm sure you know what you're doing. Pulling more and more out of your ass.  ac : I wish I could tell you... I would, but like my best friend likes him too...  Wait a second... her best friend? kg likes me, and they're best friends so...    me : Whatever.  No, dammit. Tell her you like her!   me : Anyway, I like you.  Stupid stupid stupid. What is wrong with you? How could you possibly think she likes you? Out of all people. Really, pull it together man. Just tell her you're kidding.   ac : Right.  This is your chance. You could blow it all off right here--   me : No no, I do.  *smacks head against keyboard*   ac : Of course you like me, we're great friends. You like me as a friend. I know that.  She's trying to let you out easy! Just take the bait! Make it into a joke somehow!   me : No, look. I like you as a friend, but then I like you.. like... the other kind of "I like you."  Real like, smooth like, you know, um, wording there. You had the easy way out, and you blew it. Theres no way to explain this and not look like a complete asshole. Good job.   ac : You're... kidding me, right? You like me more than a friend?  Augh. Its all over...   me : Yeah, totally.  Totally? What the hell are you thinking? You're just on a roll today.   ac : "Yeah, totally" to the first or second question?  me : The second one.  me : ac, yes. I do like you more than a friend. I have feelings for you.  ac : Woah. Thats so cool. I'm such a loser... Whatever that means...  me : I'm a bit confused, but alright.  ac : Me too, why are YOU confused?  me : The whole part about me liking you being cool, and you being a loser. That didn't quite click. Look, I sort of figured out that you don't like me... We can just talk about something else.  A real man accepts defeat. Dammit. Dammit. Dammit.   ac : No, I do like you, I just didn't want to say anything...  And the rest, as they say, is history. This was a conversation we had online, but of course, I added in proper spelling and grammar, merged IMs, etc. to make it easier to read. We agreed that it was too late in the year to go out or anything, as my family goes away for the whole summer. I'm not happy about this at all, but thats for another entry. Anyway, I'm feeling quite elated right now. I know theres still the issue with  kg , and I had to promise not to tell her, but I think there still may be some action going on at a party or something... Either way,  kg  didn't bring it up to me even though she was online all afternoon, so maybe she won't say anything afterall...  Oh, by the way, I hope you like the new logo thats been put up. In case anyone is wondering, the font is called "Whiffy."

        oklahomophobic  - A dislike for Oklahoma and for anyone from Oklahoma.  e.g., Tulsa? I'm not going to Tulsa. I'm Oklahomophobic.    kaibo swabber  - Person who cleans portable toilets or who pumps septic tanks.  e.g., The kaibo swabber had failed to leave toilet paper in the porta-potty, which left Alex in an embarrasing situation.    telefellatio  - when you have to schmooze someone important over the telephone  e.g., Hey Bob If Mr. Big Cheese calls make sure you perform telefellatio on him    urlLink  pseudodictionary.com    I've been browsing their website for about a half an hour now, which is basically a dictionary of user-submitted sniglets, searching for a word to describe the situation I'm in. Not so much the situation really, but the feelings. Everyone has felt them at some point or another, maybe not both these feelings at the same time, but you've felt them at some time nevertheless.  A few weeks ago I picked up the book "The Tao of Pooh" by...  Actually, I don't have the book with me to tell you because I lent it to  dg . Anyway, the book has given me a new outlook on life in general, and I reccomend you pick it up. Its a great introduction to Taoism, and the author explains everything in a way that is very easy to understand. He compares aspects of Taoism to scenes from the Winnie the Pooh books, which surprisingly have a good amount of Taoism in them.  As mentioned before, the book has made me look at things differently. One of these things is girls. Alright, I know that I'm thirteen, and have no idea what I'm doing in terms of relationships, I don't know what love is, etc. Still, the only way to learn is to go out into the playing field... or something like that. I don't recall this as being one of the concepts in the book, but I've decided to tell people when I have feelings for them. I know I haven't told  ac , but I'm getting around to it... eventually...  I've been open about this when friends ask for advice involving the complex issues of middleschool love, and always tell them straight in the eye that the best thing they can do is tell the person exactly how they feel, and the worst thing that can happen then is that the person won't feel the same way, and that we will deal with the reaction when it comes. A big concept of Taoism I've been using in daily life is that we need to live in the present. We should be deciding what to do about how we feel about someone NOW, not how the person will react once you tell them LATER. I've had numerous discussions about this with (among other people)  dg  and her twin sister  kg . I've told them both that telling people how you feel is the best way to go.  Sometimes, you know, your advice can backfire on you.  Apparently  kg  has a crush on me. I know, big deal. Just tell her I don't like her, everything will be alright. I don't act different around people who like me, so whats the problem?  I don't know, this just feels different. We were good friends and stuff, and I really don't want to hurt her feelings.    ac   was the one who told me that   kg   liked me (and apparently has liked me for some time now) even though she wasn't supposed to.   kg   wanted to tell me herself, but I asked  ac  to tell me what kg told me she wanted to talk to me about earlier that day (she had mentioned that she wanted to talk to me about something, I had no idea what it was about).  ac  eventually broke down after hours of-- three minutes of interrogation, and here we are.  What to do? I don't know,  kg  will tell me tommorow.  ac  said she ( kg ) didn't want to tell me, because she thought I didn't like her, but  ac  told her to tell me anyway. I guess all I can do is take my own advice and tell  kg  how  I  feel.   On a lighter note, last night I bought the "Weezer: Video Capture Device - Treasures from the Bault 1991-2002," which is jampacked with music videos, behind the scenes footage, and other good stuff. Over three hours of video, great stuff...

      I restarted my blog due to another blog I stumbled upon called  urlLink  Tequila Mockingbird.  Its a great blog, and you should all check it out. It made me remember why I loved blogging so much. Not that I blogged much in the first place, I think on my former blog I wrote all of about seven posts.  I bring this up because I'll be taking a leaf out of her book. Instead of writing the real name of someone who was involved in something I deem worth writing something about, I'll put their initials, in order to protect the identities of the innocent and such. Anyway, to the writing thing...    ac.  God, she's beautiful. I've got one period with her, and I'm just... I don't really know what I feel. We're great friends, and went out earlier in the year, but I was a jerk when we did. I dumped her in a note (what an asshole) that was about two sentences long (bigger asshole), and spelled her name wrong (biggest asshole ever.) Somehow, we're still friends. Good friends, too.   I dumped   ac   because she was going to dump me (yeah, I was an insensitive jerk.) She was being great, but I was sort of nervous about the whole thing.  I had (and have) only made out once, and I knew she was going to want to, so I was nervous about all of it. Wait a second, why would I be nervous about that? Aren't I the guy who-- yeah, I don't know why I was nervous. But the making out wasn't the whole issue, I was just ignoring her and acting incredibly different around her. She obviously noticed and got her friends to talk to me about it (if a girl gets her friends to talk to you about something, its definately a bad sign. Especially if you feel more comfortable talking to her friends about it than the girl herself.) I knew she was going to dump me, so I took the low road and dumped her first. In the note, I explained that my nervousness and lack of attention to her was due to the fact that I didn't like her in the first place.  After we broke up, everything went back to normal after a week or so. We were only going out for a few weeks anyway, and hadn't really done anything, so we weren't really going out in the first place. We're better friends than we were before then (we went out in January or so,) and do flirt alot. I like her, and I know I should tell her how I feel, but its so late in the year.  Alright, I'm reading this over, and I'm really the biggest loser in the world. I need to straighten myself out. I think I should apologize to her, or tell her how I feel anyway.      Confused...

      Nope, my name isn't actually Dave Vallace. I had another blog, yet it was discovered by both my aunt and little brother. Its only a big deal because some things were a bit personal, you see, and not things that aunts or little brothers should be reading. But then, who am I writing this for? Using an alias means that I can't show this to family or friends, because it destroys the purpose of having one in the first place. Oh well.   More later...

      I think I'm going to end up purchasing one of these Lomo cameras after all. I talked to my mom about it, and she really likes the idea of spontaneous picture taking. These cameras actually have film though, so if I was to post any pictures it would involve scanning.   So I guess I'll be doing alot of scanning.  Actually, I don't think I've used an actual camera that you have to put the film in before. Only those Kodak throw-aways...  urlLink  ten golden rules of lomography

         As mentioned this morning, I packed "Utne" in my bag today and read it during homeroom. Incredible. Tons of interesting stuff you don't see in most magazines. The thing is, most of their material IS from other magazines. I'm not exactly sure how that all works out, but I enjoy reading it because its the best of the bunch each time, the best from each magazine.  Or something like that.  They had a large section about street art, such as graffiti and stenciling. They had a guide on how to make a stencil, and I made the ninja-type thing in the picture above.  There were quite a few stencil/graffiti pictures, including one I loved and was able to find a picture of on the internet.     In other news, we had a yearbook meeting for next years yearbook committee after school today. I tried out a few months ago and made it, which may or may not be due to the fast that I know most everyone on the yearbook staff. The meeting was mostly about advertisements and the theme of next years yearbook. No one was saying much, so I was contributing as much as I could, even though it was generally garbage. I did have one idea though that I thought was pretty good. We could have the yearbook be a computer. You know, each page could be a window, and there could be other computer related stuffs. Yet the idea was shot down. Oh well. Anyway, I think the yearbook advisor hates me already, and the next school year hasn't even started yet.  I'm going to start taking a lot of pictures. Not just for yearbook, but for me. There's an art of taking photographs called  urlLink lomography , and from what I understand of it, its taking pictures everywhere you go, not even always looking through the lens. Making photography a part of your life. Not stopping to make sure you have the perfect shot, just firing away at the landscape, at whatever object you want to memorialize in a photograph. About a month ago, I went to their website and read about it. Ever since, I've been looking at things and thinking "Wow, I wish I had a camera with me." My dad is bringing home the digital camera from his office tomorrow, and so shall the reign of lomography begin.  (Yeah, I know that technically lomographers are supposed to use a special kind of camera, but I don't think that's really the most important aspect of lomography anyway. Lomography. That's a weird word to type out.)

      So I took a cold shower. Not a REAL cold shower, because I was jumping around the whole time, and was only in the shower for about a minute, washing myself and hair the fastest I ever have; but a cold shower nevertheless. I got out as soon as I could, and was shivering  from head to toe.  Now I feel toasty. I have no idea why. I just feel really warm. I'm still in a towel and bathrobe, but I usually don't feel this way after a normal shower. That, and I'm really woken up.  Cold showers rock.  Except for the whole "cold" part.

But then, thats probably the potentially most dorky thing I could possibly do. If you'll excuse me, I better get back to organizing my Pokemon cards. Night.

        YOU'D BETTER WATCH WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT PEOPLE Researchers: Psychologists from Ohio State, Purdue University, and Indiana University Who They Studied: College students What They Learned: When a person attributes positive or negative traits to someone else, the listener will frequently attribute those same qualities to the speaker, a process known as "spontaneous trait transference." 	"In other words," the researches conclude, "politicians who allege corruption by their opponents may themselves be perceived as dishonest, critics who praise artists may themselves be perceived as talented, and gossips who describe others' infidelities may themselves be viewed as immoral.... The gist of our research is that when you gossip, you become associated with the characteristics you describe, ultimately leading these characteristics to be transferred to you."   - Uncle John's All-Purpose Extra Strength Bathroom Reader by the Bathroom Readers' Institute, page 113   Just thought you might want to know.

      Last night I dreamt that tons of people came to my blog and posted lots of comments. Then I woke up, and my blog was still bare of any trace of visitation.   I'm  urlLink profile 1854630  at Blogger. That means there are one million, eight hundred fifty-four thousand, six hundred twenty-nine other blogs being hosted by Google. Even if one million of those blogs aren't active, thats still alot of competition.  Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. There isn't any competition, just other people exchanging ideas, opening peekholes into their lives for the world to look through. Still, I want people to listen to what I have to say, whatever that is anyway.  And that's all I have to say about that.
