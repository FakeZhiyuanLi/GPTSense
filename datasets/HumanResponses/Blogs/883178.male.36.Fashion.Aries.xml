       Highlights?  No highlights.  The show sucked.  Sorry, Jimmy.  However, Michael Jackson was awarded a birthday cake from one of the village people.  That was pretty cool.  Sorry if I'm a little crabby today.  I had a run in with our infamous receptionist today.  Grrr.  I thought that Christine had the all-time worst relationship with a door-hostess, but ours puts hers to shame.

      Will someone please tell me about the highlights of the VMAs?  You're killing me here!  Sorry I can't make it to MN this weekend.  I need to help Billygoat move the rest of his stuff to Cleveland. But a trip is somewhere in the near future...I can see it now: Hal, Stoner, Bobo, and DJS enjoying a nice cold one at Lee's Liquor Lounge.  That sounds like my kind of dream weekend.  As long as 2 Tix plays something by Styx, of course.

      I went to the State Fair last night.  Here's what I ate:  1/2 order of Australian fries (with ranch and cheese; served by folks who talk like Aussies), 1/2 order of cheese curds, one entire root beer float, a medium sprite at the food barn.  Can I gripe about a few things though?  The swine barn, cattle barn and sheep barn were all closed for cleaning to bring in new animals, so I did not get to see my favorite part:  the champion (pronounced champine) hog.  But the state fair people still made me pay my full eight dollars to get in!  How does that work?

      Last Christmas, Hal gave me a few calendars. One of them is a "Perpetual Postcard Calendar" from the Tate Gallery. I just thought I would share the description of one of the more unique postcards:  "Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View"  Garden shed and contents, blown up for the artist by the British Army.  Of course, this picture isn't as interesting as "Misty and Jimmy Paulette, NYC" -- two drag queens in the back of a cab. "Zagi" is a painting of a naked lady stretching her calves against a wall, as if she is about to go out streaking. "Swingeing London 67 (f)" is my personal favorite though -- it's two guys on a bus, shielding themselves from the paparazzi.  And that's the story of my perpetual postcard calendar. Stay tuned for more exciting posts...it's a slow day, and I have plenty to say.

      Don't even try to pretend you don't love it, DJS. I can read right through you. I am glad I won't have to listen to the theme music anymore after next week, though. But I can't wait for the big finale -- THREE hours of American Idol in ONE WEEK! Luckily, I have the VMAs to tide me over.  I'm such a teeny-bopper.

      American Idol...what the %@#?  I got suckered into watching the end of it and I so wanted that microphone..er, I'm sorry...Justin to go.  I can't stand the look of that guy, let alone his butchering of every song he gets his Michael Jackson-esqe hands on.  I'm in agreement, though, Panda.  Nikki can't sing and it's clear that Kelly really should win, since she's the only one that's been consistent enough (from what I've seen in the recaps) to belt out something somewhat decent week after week.  So alas, Nikki is gone.  While she was easy on the eyes, her yodeling left much to be desired.  Call me crazy, but I don't think we've seen the last of her.  If she doesn't end up in movies or get her singing chops up to par, I'd be damned.  Honestly, I can't wait until the show ends.  I'm tired of hearing that dumb theme music and seeing that bug-eyed brown-haired idiot nodding every time the Poor-man's Brad Pitt says anything.

      Whoever said I originally let him go?    So I never told you all about my brother's wedding.  It was a blast, but nothing happened that would shock many of you readers out there.  Some people drank too much, my brother did a hilarious dance to "get" the garter, my mom complained about the photographer eating dinner at one of the guest tables, etc, etc.  After the reception, a group of us, including my bro and Sylvia, all went to Sylvia's parents' room to drink Polish vodka, meat, and pickles.  Those Poles sure know how to party!  Her mom was dragging everyone at the reception on the dance floor during the Beer Barrel Polka...and when the DJ played "Believe" by Cher.    American Idol: If Nikki doesn't get the ax tonight I'll have to seriously reconsider taking up a career in the music biz.  It's obvious you don't need talent.  It seems to me all you need is a belly-button ring and some really shiny lipstick.  Heck, I can do that!

      I hurt my back this weekend, and have been a gimp ever since.  Old age is sad.  Yesterday I went to a “Dr. Feelgood” (if you can call a geeky urgent care doc who’s never been alone in a room with a girl before “Dr. Feelgood”) and got some drugs.  A muscle relaxer, to be specific.  My only experience with this medication prior to yesterday was watching Samantha’s older sister in “Sixteen Candles” go nutty on the stuff.  Taking just one makes me feel pretty high, I can only imagine what several would do.  “I mean, other men have loved me, but not for six whole months in a row.”   By the way - can we can the Rick talk?  It took Panda a long time to let him go.  We don't need to dredge up the past.

In other music-related news: U2's "Stay" just came on the radio.  I am in heaven.  Not to say I'm comparing Rick to Bono, but...

      I opened up Internet Explorer this morning and what did I see? Panda's little brother!   There's a story about him on our intranet -- apparently he's doing a great job as a business banker. I think it's hilarious, because I think of him (as Hal said) as the angry Scotsman, risking his life to create the most glorious fireworks display ever, partying with friends such as Yankee Doodle Andy. Or running around singing the Mexican hat dance song.  I'm scared.

       DJ S, I extend my sympathies regarding the soda fiasco.  And Stoner, please don’t get me sick.  Wear a mask, or something.  By the way, I, uh, hope you feel better.  I haven’t TGIF’d this much in a long time.  It’s been a v. crappy week.  But on the bright side, MKD sent us treats from his vacation – pralines from Savannah.  He’s back in the office on Monday, and I have to toss him mad props for shipping in snacks from GA.  It put the “F” in Friday.  Yesterday, “Lil’ Sickie Jr.” and I booked tickets to visit our favorite set of Mikes in P-town.  The trip isn’t until October, but I’m looking forward to it.  Last time we went, we spent the better part of a day cleaning Mikey’s apartment.  Let’ hope it doesn’t come to that again.  Maybe a preventative pre-trip care package of Mr. Clean and Windex would help… hmmm.  Panda, I’m sure if you and Billygoat end up moving out there you could teach those two a thing or two.  Have a great weekend, folks.  I’m going to the fair with Corduroy tomorrow, so I’ll likely have stories on Monday. :)

      Always hard to follow a post about someone blowing chunks, but...  I just drank a Diet Pepsi because the other stinkin' soft drink machine (that offers delicious Diet Coke) won't accept my dollar bills.  Trust me, I tried all five that I had.  Since I needed liquid, cafferinated refreshment, I turned to the much-loathed Pepsi machine and it greedily ate my Dead George.  With a sigh, I depressed the DP (that's Diet Pepsi) button and the machine farted out a newly designed can.  Since I don't like to drink out of cans, I scooped some ice into my Uptown Bar pint glass and poured the Diet Pepsi over the rocks.  (Note: If you don't drink your soft drinks in a bar glass while at work, you're truly missing out.)  I choked it down and wished the Coke machine wouldn't have done me wrong.  Friends, it just ain't the same.  Oh...and I'm going to Khan's Mongolian Barbecue for lunch.  Lucky me.

       The horror…   A friend of mine started her day yesterday not feeling all that well. By 6 p.m. she was throwing up. Of course, since hearing that story I have developed symptoms similar to hers. I can’t decide if I am on the road to a very unpleasant evening/weekend, or if it is all in my head. I’d be thrilled if it was a Tuesday (as long as it didn't interfere with "Idol" watching), but I don't want to be sick over a weekend!   Puking on a Saturday is the worst torture I can think of – especially if it means I’ll feel better on Monday.

      I feel so bad for Nikki. She obviously wants to be off the show, and I think some sickos out there are voting for her just to torment her. She knows the other singers are better than her. She gets humiliated every week. I swear they only said nice things to her the other day to keep her from offing herself so she wouldn’t have to perform anymore.   I am also very depressed that Tamyra got booted. I know, she’s going to move on to a successful career, yadda yadda, but I was excited for the last few episodes, to see her and Kelly battle it out. I’ve been a Kelly supporter all along – but I still wanted Tamyra to be there in the end.   And Panda, I’m with you. Seacrest and Dunkleman have got to go.

      OK, what the heck just happened?  First, Seacrest makes out with some woman in the crowd, then the "Idols" decide to sing a Paula Abdul medley for Ms. Abdul herself (I've heard chimps sing better), and then Tamyra gets kicked off?  What about Nikki?  She needs to have her vocal chords permanently removed as not to cause this nation more pain and suffering.    Nikki, haven't we suffered enough?  Your nervous wink-tick and tears do not fool me.  You still blow.

      What you posted below is exactly why I love it so... because it's so bad, it's embarrassing.  Kind of the same phenomena as stopping to take a good look at a car accident.  Demented and sad, true.  But oddly entertaining, nonetheless.  The stupid-looking afro guy is Justin.  He totally creeps me out and freakishly resembles Michael Jackson when he still looked "normal".  One of the guys I work with bets he'll be in the top two.  We'll let Simon be the judge of that.

      Okay...so I'm the curmudgeon here.  I can't stand that show.  Like most of TV (and I don't want to get on a rant here) American Idol is totally insulting to my intelligence...you know, 'cuz I'm so smart.  I caught a clip of some of the show when my girlfriend was watching it and there was a segment where it showed 'those wacky kids' having fun between rehearsals.  They were being crazy and trying their hand at playing the trumpet.  Of course, no one was able to blow it and make it work right.  Hilarious!  But then...the idiot with the stupid-looking afro (I think, I forget because they're all talentless) drank some Coca-Cola and was able to belt out a chart-topper.  So stupid.  And another thing...don't speak for the whole of America by calling any of these no talent schleps American Idols.  Let us decide who the damn idols are, okay?  Not just the poor slobs who actually call in to vote for this garbage.  Seriously...would you buy a CD if any of them released something?  I'm sorry, I'd rather spend my hard-earned cash on a pencil.  So I could poke out my eardrums.  (take a breath)  Okay...so I'm crabby today.  I've had to train 6 people who had the attention span of a fat lady in a bakery.  Needless to say, I'm a little burnt out.  Today was a long day.  I guess I hope Kelly wins, alright?  :)

      I have to admit, I'm a closet fan of "AI" myself.  But lately, I seem to be watching it more for the crazed "live studio audience", the judges, and the inane circus clowns, oops, I mean "hosts", than the actual performers.    What's with these kids' parents in the audience?  Particularly, what's with Nikki's parents' T-Shirts?  I'm all for being a "fan" of your children, but I believe they're wearing a picture on their chests of her half-naked.  And the judges: what a bunch of pretentious a-holes.  Can someone please tell me what that was on Paula Abdul's head last night?  Paula, even though you won a Grammy in the 80's doesn't mean, it  still is  the 80's.    I could go on and on about those 2 ass clowns Seacrest and Dunkleman.  Heck, what I really should go on and on about is how I actually know their names.  I need to get out more.  So tonight, we will see who sucks the least.  I have my money on Kelly.  Who's with me?

       Today I am visiting my nemesis:  REI  REI and I don’t mix.  I made a few trips there earlier this summer to prepare for my Fourth o’ July Colorado shoot out, er, camping trip and had some bad experiences.  There is a lot of attitude amongst those climbing wall-ers.  Suffice it to say, I am not a member.  So why go back?  I do it out of love for my big bro.  This Friday night he flies in from NYC and the next AM he’s heading straight for the boundary waters.  For this purpose, he needs a paddle.  Lest you figure him to be a poor planner, let me explain.  He has ordered a paddle online from said merchant, but in his words “it’s not here yet, and I’m worried it will be too short”.  Okayyyyy…  To remedy this, he would like me to pick up an alternate paddle at (hated) REI so that he has options when he arrives in Minneapolis.  I will then be returning the rejected paddle to (hated) REI.  It’s a simple task, I guess, and I’m willing to brave those over-gortexed fools, but brother has another request – pick out not one, but three “really nice looking paddles of a specific type, so I can choose among them”.  He explained that he’s really particular about the wood grain.  Uh-huh.    The saddest thing is, as I retold this tale to Stoner, she pointed out that I’m the same way about shoes (and I’m pretty sure that that if I bring home another purse, I’m breaking the lease, or something).  I had little argument.  Except, that I haven’t asked anyone to bring the shoe department to me.  Then again, I haven’t spent much time in New York (apparently).  On a much happier note, who’s going to win American Idol?  I was a late arrival to the show, but it has me hooked.

      What a day.  There’s been no small amount of chaos here at work, but the funniest thing just happened - I went out to lunch (I picked up my new golf clubs - woo hoo!!) and upon my return, workmen (ow!) were milling around and 1/2 the cubes in my surrounding little area had been torn down!  It was out of nowhere - I almost started laughing, it was too bizarre.  Turns out they are doing a physical reconfiguration as well as an organizational re-build.  Perhaps the same 2 year old with a crayon is masterminding both?  hmmm…  DJ Shovelpants will be moved “to the other side” as we say ‘round these parts.  I will be similarly relocated early next year.  Who knows where MKD will end up.  I wonder what will happen when I come in tomorrow morning…

      Who ever thought it would be so difficult to find a good, non-cheesy DJ for a wedding?  Billygoat and I were in Wisconsin over the weekend, checking out local vendors for our big day.  We decided to crash some weddings in the area in order to watch the DJs in action.  So to do this, we thought it would be a good idea to get dressed up - you know, to "fit in."  What we forgot was that we were in Wisconsin.  Because we dressed up, we  didn't  fit in.  There were guys walking around in tight Levi's, Harley T-shirts, and permed mullets.  There were others in loose khakis and bright white Reeboks.  It was like we had entered some parallel universe of fashion mishaps.  And the DJs sucked, by the way.  I was more impressed by one DJ's disco ball, than by his music.  FYI to all those attending mine - "Brick House" is on the DO NOT PLAY list.

      I work for a big company, and part of my job is to edit communications pieces. I’m always amazed at how many people are involved in the editing process – the easiest, smallest pieces go through at least ten hands, and everyone has something to say.   Today I was even more amazed than usual. Someone is on vacation, so I’ve been asked to review the company-wide communications that she looks at on behalf of our business line. There were 132 people on the to: line of this message. I’m not kidding. I counted. 132. Each of these people will probably pass it to one or two other people, meaning there are potentially hundreds of small changes that are going to be made to this document.   I am so grateful that is not my job.

Pandyland is real-time, and I love it.  Here’s an update on my weekend: I got to play with Rocky, my parents’ new puppy, and I found out how he got his name. You might think it’s an adaptation of our family’s last name – but really, it’s because Rocky eats rocks. And twigs. And pretty much anything else that he can get into his mouth. I was never really too big on pets (you have to feed them or they die), but now I want one.

        News flash...    Sara, some goofy broad on Sasshole, visited this here site and claimed it was a joke.  Please...someone dispatch a crew to burn her house down.  Doesn't she realize that we're in the beginning stages?  Oh...and I did check out Pandy1and.  Confirmation that they just can't get enough of us.  Any slob willing to devote his time to making a (oh, stop me... the comedy is too intense) site (chuckle, guffaw) that's supposed to be (hee hee) like ours (ho ho) is comedy genius.  Purely.  The talent there is staggering.

      Yo yo yo...DJ is in the hizzy for rizzy. (Man...I'm such a whitey whitebread)  I also enjoyed a crisp, delicious Diet Coke myself.  I didn't have any money for the soft drink, so I had to borrow a dollar from my girlfriend.  She gladly handed over the legal tender and liquid refreshment was consumed post haste.  Nectar of the Gods, I say.  In other news: I think we should somehow post a Pandyland e-mail address or somehow install a comments feature on this here site so we can give something back to the people.  You know...let them speak their minds if they'd like.  If this sounds agreeable to the rest of the crew, I'll start digging up some info on how we can get it done.  That's how I do...

Speaking of consumption of food and drink: I have downed one bottle of Propel (Black Cherry flavor), a Nutri Grain breakfast bar, and a packet of Curious George fruit snacks.  I love sugar.

      I guess I can't seem to avoid trouble lately.  I got myself into a bit of trouble at work.  I took a picture of my boss when we went bowling at our last "team-building" meeting.  I then decided to submit it and a group photo of our team with a little "human interest" story to our work newsletter.  This newsletter is distributed globally.  That may not sound too bad until you find out what the picture looked like - it was basically a photo of my boss' ass.  Most people would be able to laugh this type of thing off, but not him.  He's got a major Napolean complex.    The longer and longer I stay within the corporate realm, the more I find out that nobody has a sense of humor anymore. Either that, or I'm not much into "team building".

      As some of you may know...I likey the band  urlLink Eels .  I even convinced Hal to part with their first effort 'Beautiful Freak' for a small fee.  The exchange went a little something like this: (hit it)   Shovel  -  I like EELS.    Hal  -  Oh, I have their first album.    Shovel  -  Do you ever listen to it?    Hal  -  Not really.    Shovel  -  I want it.  How much?    Hal  -  One burrito.    Shovel  -  Sold.   If you're not privvy to their music, they're the band who sang 'Novocaine For The Soul' (not my favorite)_but they're kind of like a cross between Cake & Beck...sort of.

Day I became a former sasshole reader  I will be gone next week, then I will post, post and occassionally, post.  Thanks for making me part of the team.  P.S.  Panda, I love your movie reviews! P.S.

That is completely encouraged.  Love, Panda  ps - we also love U2.  We will post a lot about that.  If you don't like it, go check out sasshole.com.

      Sometimes I believe that cheaters prosper.  Sometimes I think that there is no karma and you can do bad things all day long and twice on Sundays and never have bad things happen to you.  Sometimes I hate the world because we could make things so simple, we could be so cool to each other and instead we complicate things and are mean to each other and we (collectively) suck really bad.    Sometimes I feel like we have it set up so that people who are willing to short cut and cheat and mistreat can really get ahead.  Yep, screw people over, make SVP and buy a Lexus:  It's a Wonderful Life.  What's the downside (not a rhetorical question BTW - I really want to know what the downside is to the person who does it.  Do they feel anything?  Do they care or does a giant mansion and a European luxury sedan make it all better?)?  I hope to God that I never understand it. And, in spite of myself, I wish that something really bad would happen to people who do bad things to other people.    I am going (via 10 year old Honda) home (to house that would not pass FHA inspection), and I am going to drink a giant dirty martini (up).

      Duf Fer -- you are not sharing too much, because I have no idea who those people are. I just know that Heather was right and Peggy was very, very wrong.  Now I will share too much. I just got this e-mail:  " Update from Needlework Unlimited : The Rowan Trunk Show has arrived with lots of sweaters knit up in the fabulous Rowan yarns.  All Rowan yarn 15% off during the show. The CanvasWorks Trunk Show continues through Sunday and the Shelly Trunk Show is coming next.  We have a special treat during the Shelly show - Shelly herself!  Shelly will be in the shop on Saturday, October 12, to assist customers with canvas and fiber selection. Also October 12, knitters can try out our new yarns in the classroom at our Fall Yarn Tasting.  Better mark your calendars! And this Saturday, September 28, Dave Paulson will be at the shop sharpening scissors.  This is a great opportunity to have a professional make your edges like new.  Drop them off anytime before Saturday and they will be ready by 5pm Saturday."  It was at approximately 4:12 p.m. today that I realized I am kind of a geek.

      I’ve actually seen Panda do a duet of “Up Where We Belong” and I have to tell you – it was truly inspiring.   In other news, I am taking a class on Tuesday nights. I’m not giving out the name of the place because I want to tell you about some of the people in my class. And I would feel horrible if they knew I was discussing their quirks on the Internet. Not that they would somehow stumble onto Pandyland, realize I am talking about them, and figure out who I am. But still -- I have paranoia issues.   Back to my story – I’m starting to think that this undisclosed organization plants people in their classes in order to boost the confidence of the other students. Because my class has two that are somewhat questionable.   It’s a freelance writing class, so on the first day we did the usual interview-the-person-sitting-next-to-you thing. You’d think that in a room full of potential reporters, you’d get some pretty straight facts. Not the case with the guy sitting next to me – while introducing me, he went on about how I am there to pursue an advanced degree, and how I publish a journal about insurance and issues relating to insurance, etc. etc.   Neither of these things came out of my mouth – I’m definitely not there to pursue an advanced degree because, well, they don’t grade you on the classes and don’t actually offer any degrees. I did say that I do employee newsletters for an insurance company, so I guess I do see how he could confuse that with an insurance “journal.” But the nature of what I write for work involves very little objective research – just a lot of “pat Bob on the back because he sold a huuuuuuuuge policy!!!! AOW!!!!!”   Still, this guy pales in comparison to the lady who I shall now refer to only as “Crazy Lady.”   On the first day she apologized for being 45 minutes late and having to leave an hour early – our class is two hours long. This week, our assignment was to get writer’s guidelines from publications we’d like to write for. It’s a pretty simple task, all it involves is a few minutes on the internet or a few minutes to fill out the addresses on a couple of envelopes. Not a big deal.   When we got around the room to her, she said she didn’t do the assignment – and that, quite frankly, she didn’t realize this was going to be so much work. When asked who she’d like to write for she said – “I didn’t really think about it. I don’t know. I guess  National Geographic . It’s always been my dream to be a photographer for  National Geographic .” Which doesn’t exactly explain why she’s in a freelance  writing  class...but hey, whatever works.  Finally, last night there was a reception for some grant winners going on outside the door of our classroom. We all joked around about mingling during break time – but really, we were joking. Crazy Lady, apparently, was not. She came back from break with a glass of wine.   So anyways…those are my stories…for now. I’m sure I will tell more later.

      I would like to sing "Summer Wine" (the song that is on the "Corrs Live on VH1" cd, apparently Nancy Sinatra sang it?) just like they do -- as a duet with Bono. I like that song because of its country flair and belt-the-whole-thing-at-the-top-of-your-lungs potential.  If Bono is unavailable that weekend, I suppose I could substitute with something from "J to tha L-O"...right now it is a toss up between "Ain't it Funny" and "It's Gonna Be Alright." Of course, that will be decided when I find out if Ja Rule is available or not.  Murder, Inc. is tha bomb.

After all, we've got a SMASH HIT website without the aid of polls, porn, or the tired (and I mean...tiiiiiiiired) notion of booting anyone off.  Let's give ourselves a pat on our back and a burrito in our fat gobs for a job well done.  Splendid work, everyone.  You make this DJ priggity-proud!  Duf - Tomorrow might be tough for a burrito run.  I got the newbies to train, but God-willing, let's make it happen.  Seeing as it's my last day of work for the week, I want to run the clock down any way possible.  Ya know?  Stoner - I can't tell you how many tears leaked out of my head when I opened my DJ Shovelpants e-mail account and saw...NOTHING!!!  Where's that story, dammit?  No pressure, of course.  But Sweet Jesus!!!  I will however sing the extended version of 'Sweet Child O' Mine' at the burrito fest.  If you guys really behave, I might even do the Axl Rose patented Serpentine moves, too.

      Sign me up for the PBJ (Pandyland Burrito Jamboree).  I will sing  Unchained Melody  (more like the Willie Nelson than Righteous Brothers or Elvis).  I can't wait to meet Panda Bear.  I heard so many things.  I mean so many GOOD things. Oh, and Stoner, all god-fearing Americans like pancakes - that's why you got the frowns.

      I think that everyone should have to sing a song at the first annual Pandyland Burrito Jamboree. I just think that would be a nice touch.  We have a potluck here tomorrow, as part of United Way week. I have to bake something, so it only costs me $2 to participate, rather than $6. I think by the end of the week, I am going to need the United Way because I will be so poor. It's one of those three-weekend paychecks (c'mon, you know what I'm talking about) so it's a stretch already...I got frowns for skipping out on the $3 pancake breakfast today. I don't really like pancakes, so I decided it is my prerogative (as Bobby Brown would say) to skip out. I'm not participating in the cribbage tournament today either. I'm on strike. Okay, and I don't know how to play.  But I must get back to work...my boss just handed me our cookbook to final-double-check to make sure all of the editing was done properly. For the eight millionth time. What was my mantra again? Oh yeah -- "I don't want to sleep on cardboard, I don't want to sleep on cardboard..."

      Ball of confusion That's what the world is today Hey Hey  So last night, I get home from work thinking there is going to be this great anniversary celebration (what is the second anniversary anyway?  Tin?  Paper?  Cash?  I think it is cotton or china) and I find my wife drunk on Grain Belt Premium singing that Dave Edmunds song: "I Knew the Bride When She Used to Rock and Roll" out of key at the top of her lungs.  All I can think is "Geez, I've got 5 more years of this crap?"  She passed out while I was reading her my romantic anniversary poem (called "Anniversary 2, Electric Boogaloo - Two Dirty Limericks to Honor Our Anniversary").  I ended up watching a bad video tape (static, cut off before the end) of the Emmys - how about that  Everybody Loves Raymond , huh?  Anyway, it was not the anniversary I imagined:  some celebration.    I guess that's only funny for people who know my wife.  For those that don't, I have never seen her drunk, but she cannot say the same of me (hiccup).  Stoner, quit your job and hit the road Kerouac style.  Title your book "On the Road Again."  Make it stream of consciousness.  You'll need an oil change (every 3,000 miles) for your (quiet) Toyota.  Maps, and lots of drugs (preferably hallucinogens, but maybe Ecstacy to make it a version for the new millenium).  Of course, you'll need corporate sponsors (a certain large national bank comes to mind).    But, Stoner, mainly I wanted to say this:  in the words of Bachman Turner Overdrive (BTO to those in the know) I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you:  tonight.  Expect delivery tomorrow after work.  PB:  I'm am the world's biggest Cheesecake fan.  I also had a non-traditional wedding cake at my wedding - Kranzakake (Norwegian snack cake for holidays and weddings) - and either it was a big hit or everyone lied and said that it was.  Don't invite me to your wedding (my wife has problems with the sauce), but save me a piece of cake.  DJS - sorry about lunch today. What's the haps for tomorrow?  Buh-Ree-To? Lemmeknow. When are we having our Pandyland Burrito Jamboree?  HAL - let's shop soon, but not for shoes.  Billygoat - what gives, too gruff to post?

      You'll have to ask the 'rents about the open bar plan since that's their gig.  I'm all for it, but I'm also for keeping things reasonably priced, which an open bar doesn't help with.  All I know at this point: there will definitely be all the top-notch booze you can drink available during the cocktail hour before dinner.  The goal: drink as many drinks as you can, as fast as you can.    That sounds like the games we used to play at Plum's on Thursday nights.  Look forward to a Billygoat post soon.  I heard rumors that he may get close to a computer this evening...

      I feel like a loser that I wasn’t in the short-story contest like everyone else, though I had a nice weekend regardless.  It got a little surreal when on Saturday night I found myself at a friend’s cabin watching the “Miss America” pageant.  Please, will someone put this contest out of its misery?  I say this not out of feminist outrage (I personally think there are bigger fish to fry), but because it’s just sad.  Not even “so-good-it’s-bad”, or “Fastlane-bad”.  Just sad.  Though not quite as sad as waiting for someone you are "fighting" with to surf over to your web log.  Panda, I like the cheesecake idea, but let’s get to the part of the wedding that everyone REALLY cares about – will it be an open bar? :)

      I haven't been able to post much lately. It seems that either a) the internet is down at work, b) I am being forced to proofread recipes, or c) I am repeating "you can't quit your job, or you will have to live on the street" over and over in my head, which means I haven't had much time for Pandyland.  But I did manage to take that brat packer quiz. I am sad to report I came up as Long Duck Dong. Embarassing.  Y'all can read my story if you want...it's a little strange to have people want to read something I wrote, because I don't write many stories -- I just write in my journal, which I'm sure you all would find WAY more interesting, but that's too bad, you can't read it. Posting it seems a little weird though. It's less than 900 words (per the contest's instructions) but still...kind of a long post. And it's on my home computer anyways. And the dog (or mouse) might eat it by the time I get home, you just can't ever tell...  I heard our crazy neighbors fighting last night. All I caught was "You're crazy! And angers me! Take it down this instant!" which I can only assume is referring to the notes she has posted on the door to keep the window washers away (it's been a month now).   Duf -- I have reviewed my copy of the burners code of ethics. Your cookies are on the way. BTW, I am v. sad to hear that the Jack Johnson show at First Ave sold out really fast, which means we can't go.   Panda -- I *love* cheesecake. I can't wait to go to your wedding.   DJS -- I want to do another quiz.   Hal -- I want to play Stratego later.  Billygoat -- I miss you.

      DJS, you are right on the money about craphole.com...not only are their posts ridiculous-o, but that idiot Sara thinks our site is the mock site that Mr. Crap had painstakingly made eons ago.  She's a real piece of work.  So I was in Wisconsin again over the weekend...more wedding stuff.  We got to taste the wedding cake.  Postitively delicious!  I broke out of the mold and am making her bake me a 3-layer cheesecake.  It may not be as pretty as the traditional dessert, but it sure tastes damn good.   I saw the movies  Signs  and  One Hour Photo  over the weekend.  I may post a review(s) later, but to make a long story short: We saw  One Hour Photo  first, thought it was terrible, and then decided to sneak over to see  Signs  to try and get our money's worth.   Signs  was good, but not great, so I guess that's better than a sharp stick in the eye...and watching  One Hour Photo  again.  DJS and Stoner - whenever you're ready, post your stories.  Now I'm curious.

You know, rights and what-not.    Wow...what a coinky-dink that Stoner was in the same contest.   Stoner - I'd love to read your story.  Do you want to share it with a fellow writer-type (me)?  If so, please send it to:  djshovelpants@yahoo.com .  I'll do the same if you want to read my contest effort.  Another guy I know entered the contest as well.  It's weird to see what people do with the topic (which I wasn't a big fan of).  IMHO is: In My Humble Opinion.  For more crazy abbreviations or code words, visit  urlLink Urban Dictionary.com .  They've got all the crazy lingo there.

      Shovelpants, Stoner participated in the self same short story contest.  It was good that I did not do it.  I would have won all the money.    I am reading your story now DJS - people like Miller High Life:  it is the Champagne of Beers.  Excellent story.  I loved the surprise ending with the clever twist.  I think you and Stoner should post your stories here.  Panda, what does IMHO stand for?  Am I totally clueless?

      Not a bad weekend on my end, either.  The key word was:   relax  .  Since we're moving out of our de-luxe apartment in the sky-high-high this coming weekend, I didn't want to do a whole heckuva lot.  I beat Super Mario Sunshine, ran some errands, went to Stillwater with my girl, and I participated in a 24 hour short-story contest.  As an added bonus, I got to watch the newest episode of the Sopranos.   Duf  - I thought the Polara album was pretty decent.  Of course, that's listening to it here at work, where I'm plenty distracted, so...  I might have to give 'er another spin or two.  I do like that tune they've got playing on the radio, however.  Happy anniversary!  I guess I've got to pay my dues, I thought your wife would 86 you a long time ago because of your mad penchant for DVD/CD purchases.  By the by...I'm going to Best Buy tomorrow.  You in?  On another note: I accidentally popped over to Sasshole.  Man...they've still got a bunch of lame-o's pretending to post interesting things.  No amount of polls or porn will make that site remotely interesting.  Boot everyone off, starting with Dr. Ego himself!

      I have to say it was a good weekend.  I watched tons of college football; I teed it up with a local DJ/Turntablist (who is playing quite well lately (on the course and on the wheels of steel)), and I took the cold (achoo!) my daughter had last week!   I want to take a moment to plug the new  Polara  album  Jetpack Blues .  They are a local band, and their disc is outta site/dy-no-mite (although I am not so sure DJ Shovelpants liked it).  Let me know if you want me to burn it - which reminds me of something I'm going to do for Stoner.  I will burn, but I have a burners code of ethics that you must agree to.  Tonight is my anniversary.  To those who thought we would never last:  ha!  Those who bet 1 year, 364 days on the over/under:  pay up suckas!    Stoner:  how was the contest?

      I have come up with a new "workplace friendly" version of the Nelly song:  "Hot in Herrre."  It goes a little something like this:  "It's getting cold in here, so put on extra clothes.

      I'm so glad you all voted off Bobo Le Clown.  People love those Survivor style vote-offs on Blogs.  Now, I am here, and I will be so much more regular than Bobo (er...frequent).  This weekend, I am going golfing with this golfer who thinks she is so good at golf, and I am better than her at golf and at other things too.  I just ate part of a "Fast Break" candy bar, and it was too sweet for me.  I am going back to "Baby Ruth" as my CBOC (candy bar of choice).

      Wow, I didn't think I would get such a rebuttal.  You coulda just said something like "hey, non-network tv ain't all that bad" and I would have been pacified.  Thanks for the play-by-play.  I don't have HBO (or even standard cable), therefore TV viewing for me is unfortunately limited to Network stations.  Billygoat grew up without a TV at all - my parents actually had to explain to him what they meant by the saying "sometimes we are so 'Ozzie & Harriet'."  [Anyone who knows Appleton, WI knows it's pretty close to a real-life "Pleasantville."]  It's funny the perspective he has on things, having never watched TV as a child.  I'd say he's more creative than most, he loves to read, & doesn't ever feel "the itch" because he's missing a show.  Since I'm already sick of explaining things like who each character is on Friends or how Wheel of Fortune  always  comes on at 6:30pm, I highly doubt that after we're married we will be watching TV at all.  It's hard to teach an old dog new shows.

      Okay Panda, let me clear the air about the whole TV thing.  I've got the unfortunate 'sit-chee-ay-shun' where our living room is right smack dab next to the bedroom.  When the girlfriend is watching TV: (Alias, reruns of 90210, American Idol, parts of Fastlane and tons of other uh, stuff) I have no choice but to see some of it. After realizing that it's just as bad as everything else, I retire to the study and read. Yeah, it's sad.  It's not that I think I'm above quality shows shown to you piecemeal with rotten commercial interruptions every five minutes or so...heck no.  I like some TV, I just hate MOST of it.  That's all.  For the record, I can't watch more than an hour of network television without complaining and feeling my brain start to melt.  I DO however, have a deep, deep love of some of the HBO shows.  I'm talking your Sopranos (best show, ever!), Dennis Miller Live, and I'll admit it...I like Sex & The City.  Can you say Kristin Davis?  Yep...I can.  But, for your consideration, here are some shows I'll watch without wanting to commit a homicide:   1.  The Sorpanos  2.  Insomniac (Comedy Central)  3.  Real TV  4.  The Simpsons  5.  The Daily Show (rarely, these days)  6.  The Osbournes  7.  Sex & The City  8.  The Dennis Miller Fun Hour  9.  Crank Yankers  (Jesus...I couldn't even come up with 10!)   A note:  The only show I actually seek out and set aside time to watch is The Sopranos, everything else is stuff that while I'm surfing, I might stop on and watch a bit, but I don't set my clock, arrange my meals, or storm out of public places in a blind fury to watch.  Wow...I need to lighten up, eh???

      I just caught a bit of Bono on Oprah this morning.  We snuck into our conference room and I made someone hold the bunny ears while I watched so the reception was good.  Oprah called in to a radio station when Bono was in town a couple days ago.  Supposedly she took him out for dinner after the night of the taping.  They went to Rosebud...I walk past that place at least once a week...why not that day?  It's probably for the best, though.  If I would have seen him it would have turned pretty ugly.    On a side note: I was wondering about Shovel's supposed "hatred" towards television.  It seems to me whenever anyone comments about a show on TV, Shovel seems to know ALL about it.  IMHO, I think he's a "closet watcher."  And I don't buy the argument "Oh, my girlfriend was watching, so I just  had  to sit there for several hours too."  C'mon DJS...fess up!  You love TV!

      Thanks for the pipe, DJS. :)  I should clarify my earlier statement.  I didn't say that Fastlane was good, I just said I enjoyed it.  If he was a poor man's Tom Cruise, the show would be unwatchable.  But the fact that he's a  POOOOR Man's  Tom Cruise made it enjoyable.  For me.  I won't be taping it (God, I hope not - it would mean that my TV habit is truly out-of-hand), but I have a feeling I'll be finding myself laughing at it from time to time.  As Stoner put it, "this show is Melrose!!".  Well put.

      Special thanks to Stoner for performing a vigilante rodent inspection earlier this week (she gave us the all-clear).  My own rodent-removal procedure consisted of hysterical calls to our apartment management company (creatively called “Apartment Management Company”).  The woman with the lucky job of answering the phones there calmly explained to me that the mouse will eat the poison put out by the exterminator “and then leave your apartment to die”.  I wasn’t quite sold with that premise as I’d think a mouse would choose to die in the plush environs of our apartment versus venturing out into the world for one last adventure, but since we have several senior citizens in our building, this lady gets must get away with such tall tales on a regular basis.  Whatever.  To further complicate all this, I’ve seen too many Tom & Jerry, Speedy Gonzales, and even Micky Mouse cartoons to begin to think that it’s a done deal that the mouse will eat the poison, no matter how enticing.  I’m nervous that left to its own devices, the little bastard will sneak the poison in my morning coffee and hit me over the head with a giant anvil.   So now that we’ve confirmed that the only residents of apartment 205 are Stoner and myself, I can look forward to a pleasant weekend.  *sigh*  Further housing lowdown… I caught a bit of  urlLink “Rear Window”  recently, and it has me even more suspicious of the clowns across the hall.  I’m determined to figure out what’s up – so far my sleuthing has uncovered the fact that they keep their mini-blinds nearly closed a lot of the time.  I’ll keep you updated.

      Hey...I got no shame, I'd do it.  I'll eat AND get my toesies done.  Hell, yeah.  Which reminds me of something...  Back when I was dating a complete psycho, she used to get a kick out of painting my big ol' Fred Flintstone feet.  I didn't care, since you know...what else did I have to do, so I let her, we both laughed and I kind of forgot about it.  I mean...REALLY forgot about it.   Cut to:   Time:  2 Days Later     Scene:  Bloomington Karate Center  I used to be quite the avid kickboxer (and no, I don't look like John Cusack from Say Anything) and as such, I'd get suited up, hop in the ring and pound all kinds of fools into paste.  I had a bit of a reputation as being a bruiser.  As a shorter, stockier guy I could move quick and hit pretty gosh-darn hard.  Well, imagine my absolute horror when I began to strap my footpads on and saw...  Pink Glitter Nail Polish.  Like a trooper, I fought anyway and avoided the odd glances I got from some of the other clowns, but I removed it quickly once I got home.  I used the old "Oh, my girlfriend did that" routine.  They would just nod and go..."Uh-huh, yeah..."  Ah...good times, good times.

      Panda - your Bill story is classic, and informative.  I’ll have to keep the silverfish idea in mind for our neighbors across the hall… as a defensive measure, of course.  I thought I had good Bill stories, but yours takes the cake.  And Stoner, stop with the quiz fixation, already.  You have one alter-ego, and it’s Coco.  If you want to nickname it “Kylie” or “Mallrats” every once and awhile, that’s fine.  But a rose by any other name is still a rose.  Or a Coco.  I’m overdue to comment on the upcoming U2 release – I hope you’re sitting down, but I’m excited about it.  Not as excited as I am about an album of all-new material, but rest assured, I’ll be picking it up on the first day of release (or midnight the night before, if possible).  It’s been a long week already, and today’s anniversary isn’t helping any.  Tonight Stoner and I are going to Steen’s house for drinks (that sounds better than “to drink”, doesn’t it?) and it’s a welcome diversion.  They have an occasional bat problem, but I have mice, so I can’t throw stones.  Maybe VH1 will replay the show (a whole hour long!) Stoner and I watched last night about "Booty".  We should be so lucky.

      That story sounds oddly familiar...Billygoat and I thought my silverfish were coming from Bill, the guy across the hall from me.  Here is his story:  I first ran into Bill in the elevator when I was doing my laundry.  He's this huge, bald, gay man.  Picture Mr. Clean with a lisp.  When you first see him you think "This guy is going to totally kick my ass" until you hear him say something like "Oh, I just *love* your shoes."  So I thought he was just a bit eclectic.  He even offered to give me his XBOX because he said he never used it.  Sweet, right?  Until I found out he was completely schizophrenic.  I started running into him in the hallway at weird times.  He would look at me strangely until I finally asked him what was up.  Bill asked me stuff like "Did you knock on my door the other night?" or "Did you hear that pounding before?"  I, of course, answered 'no' to both of these questions.  He then told me something that was really wacko.  "Someone was pounding incessantly on my door last week so I went to the door but no one was there.  When I looked at your door across the hall, I saw shadows of feet under the door."  I quickly responded, "Wait a second, bud.  I wasn't even in town last week."  (the ol' NYC alibi)  But Bill insisted... "The cops are after me (I'm a drug dealer, but just a *little* drug dealer) and so I think that they have someone watching me who is using your apartment as a hideout."  WTF??  I told him I appreciated the "heads up", and I would look out for him and the mysterious door-knocker.  Translation:  "I will continue to dead bolt my door and avoid you at all costs, you freakshow."  So last week he finally moved out.  More like got KICKED OUT.  It turns out he never paid any of his bills (and I thought drug dealing was a lucrative profession) and he started to use the outlet we had in our hall to plug in HIS ENTIRE APARTMENT.  No lie, I tripped over his extension chord everytime I went to my apartment.  It was pretty funny, though, since I hate the management company for my building and he was really socking it to 'em.  But still, the guy was nuts.  So that's why I have silverfish.

      For the record, our apartment is spotless (except for the peanut butter that is probably now all over the place, thanks to our old-fashioned mousetraps).   We think the vermin has something to do with the people across the hall. They're very suspicious -- about two weeks ago, window washers were going into each apartment to wash the windows. There were signs posted everywhere telling us that our apartments would be entered, and our windows would be washed. This prompted the neighbor lady to hang a number of things on her door, including: 1) a doorknob hanger that says "do not disturb", 2) a copy of the fax she sent to the apartment management company, requesting that she not be disturbed because she is working on a very important civil court case and just does not have time for this 3) a copy of the letter she sent -- via certified mail -- telling the window washer place that her apartment is not to be disturbed, 4) notes for the "independent contractor window washers" in case they somehow missed the message that this apartment is not to be disturbed. This stuff is still hanging on their door, even though the window washers have been done with our floor for almost two weeks now. I've been a little too scared to read everything that is posted, because I don't want them to jump out, grab me, and pull me into their scary apartment. Hal thinks it is a human chop shop.   ANYWAYS, that's why we think there is a mouse around...because of the dead bodies.

      Well, while we're on the subject...  My girlfriend is a clean-freak.  When I think our apartment is spotless, she thinks it's filthy.  So...  She was going to have a bunch of her friends over for a 'girls night' where they'd drink, watch chick flicks, talk about make-up or whatever... the works.  The bottom line?  My presence wasn't requested, so I hung out with my parents and such.  In preparation for Girl Fest 2002, she cleaned the place, top to bottom until you could eat off of the floor.  The girls came over, I was no where to be found, life was good.  Wrong.  I got a call on my cell phone around 9:15pm and she was a little excited.  It seems that a bat had managed to get into our lovely Uptown apartment (a first, by the way) at the most opportune of times.  The lessons?  Clean doesn't always = vermin-free & sometimes it's not a good idea to kick me out of the apartment for the night.

      DJS, I've been there. I've felt your pain. In the 7th grade, I became horribly addicted to The Legend of Zelda. I wanted to win so badly. I remember dreaming about the game, and thinking about it during that last hour of school -- then rushing home to play until I had swimming practice. Thank goodness for organized sports, or I could have become a tech person or something. Ew. Instead, I decided to purse a career in marketing. What does that mean? Well, today me and the rest of my department are formatting recipes to put into a cookbook to sell during United Way week. Literally -- it's cut, paste, format, repeat. It's kind of depressing when you think about it -- that in theory, we're donating probably $3000-5000 worth of time and printing costs to raise maybe $300. But I guess that is better than nothing...

Ever since playing the demo for the new Nintendo Gamecube game, featuring everyone's favortie mustachioed plumber, I knew I needed to have it for myself.  I plotted, I schemed and somehow I convinced my girlfriend that along with a new entertainment center, desk, and chair for our townhouse, our new home wouldn't be complete unless we had a Gamecube and the Super Mario game.  We bought it yesterday.  Sweet Christ.  I should've known this would happen.  Now, since I don't watch a lot of TV, I whittle my idle hours playing video games.  The wit of Seinfeld escapes me.  I want Frasier dead.  Don't get me started on American Idol.  Televised sports?  Sorry friends...no.  I'm almost 30 and a guy, so I usually play video games with guns and cars and all kinds of mayhem.  Not this time.  I'm a chubby plumber chasing mushroom-headed little guys, collecting coins, and spraying plants with water.  If you were to stand outside my apartment door, you'd hear the Super Mario music, the noise it makes when he jumps and the 'ching, ching' of collecting items needed to free the princess or whatever the hell it is I'm supposed to do.  Help me.  I was tired last night.  My girlfriend went to bed around 9pm and I should've followed suit.  It was hot and miserable and I really could've used the sleep.   Getting the 8th red coin could've waited until a more reasonable hour.  I mean...I own the machine and game.  It's not like it's going anywhere.  At around 12:30am...I crawled into bed: red-eyed, sweaty and jumpy.  I must've looked like a crack addict.  I woke up this morning thinking of excuses to not come into work today.  Did I want to take care of some errands that needed taking care of?  No.  Did I have an appointment?  No.  Was I thinking I could catch up on writing my book?  No.  I wanted to play the stupid game.  Damn you Mario.

      I will be in NYC all next week - yet again I have to be in NY on September 11th.  So someone is going to need to say something on this site other than me.  Let's hope I won't have to make another road trip across the country like last year.  Ciao, bella.

      After that 1-1/2 hour Marathon Medley (more like the Sweeney Sisters on crack) we finally got to the winner....the people have spoken:  And the people chose the 20-year-old Texan cocktail waitress - Kelly Clarkson!  All kidding aside, having been involved in choral music for most of my life, I've heard good singers as well as really bad singers...and I have to say - Kelly is one of the best I've heard for someone her age.  What makes her voice so unique: completely effortless.    Now if I could just get that stupid "A Moment Like This" song out of my head.  That, and picturing Seacrest and Dunkleman naked in a hot tub....  OK, maybe I just went too far.

      Greetings from So-Cal.  Writing to you cordless!!  I’m here for some meetings and they’ve been fine.  Tonight the real entertainment began at our “celebration dinner” to celebrate a less than successful rollout, but it would be bad to not have the dinner that usually follows such rollouts, so whatever.  A certain celebrant decided that “celebration dinner” translates in idiot as ”you should be drunk”.  Examples include when we had ordered our own desserts and then he said “bring out another 3 or 4 tiramisus to share”.  Uh, there were only 9 of us, and we had all just ordered what we wanted.  Throughout dinner, when someone finished their drink, he would order another one for them.  They wouldn’t know it ‘till another (unwanted) new drink appeared in front of them.  My boss (a vegan) joined the table only to have him helpfully point her our to the waiter by yelling, “SHE’S THE VEGAN”.  I’m sure the other patrons appreciated this info.   After dinner, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot appeared, and he yelled “THIS IS ON ME, THIS IS A CELEBRATION FOR CRISSAKES!  I LIKE TO LIVE LIFE”.  Uh, okay… but the best was at the very end, when a few people had filtered out.  He cornered the two business sponsors and resident “corporate bigwigs” and told them “I DON’T UNDERSTAND OUR BUSINESS MODEL – IT IS GOING TO FAIL.  I KNOW THE BROKERAGE INDUSTRY LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND, AND WE’RE GOING TO FAIL.”  Mind you, we’re not in the brokerage industry…  Cue exit of everyone with the exception of Mr. My-resignation-is-forthcoming… we left him at the restaurant as he told us “I JUST SAW MY FRIEND – HE WANTS TO FINISH THE BOTTLE WITH ME”…  We re-convene tomorrow morning at 8am.  Hope he makes it.

      I am very surprised (and disappointed) to see all you hard-core U2 fans have not even mentioned the fact that U2 is coming out with its second "Best Of" collection in November.  This one's covering some of my fave music from 1990 to 2000.  So much to look forward to: 1. Even Better Than The Real Thing 2. Mysterious Ways 3. Beautiful Day 4. Electrical Storm (William Orbit Mix) (new song)  5. One 6. Miss Sarajevo 7. Stay (Faraway, So Close!)  8. Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of 9. Gone (new mix)  10. Until The End Of The World 11. The Hands That Built America (new song)  12. Discotheque (new mix)  13. Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me 14. Staring At The Sun (new mix)  15. Numb (new mix) 16. The First Time

      A very ill person has given the Walgreen’s pharmacy the wrong phone number – Hal and I keep getting their automated calls informing this person that their prescription is ready. We had another one today. He or she must take a LOT of pills (or use a lot of cream, if it is a skin condition) because the calls come pretty regularly. Sometimes I wonder if the person died and we got their phone number…and it’s just the same prescription, over and over. That would be sad.

      Billygoat has officially moved out of his place and out of Chicago.  No more sweet location off of Michigan Ave to brag about for him.  He can no longer bring chicks over to try and impress them with his Chicken Candle and Whale Bone altar.  Instead, he's spending his days taking care of his grandfather in Cleveland.  This entails trying to hide chocolate from him (last week grandfather ate an entire bag of Hersey's minibars) and taking the phone away (a couple days ago he called 911 and the cops came to the house - maybe he called because he ran out of chocolate?).    Running out of sweets would definitely be an emergency for me.  I love sugar way too much.  I have a bag of Jelly Bellies sitting on my desk that are calling my name.  Gotta go!

      I had the honor of golfing with Hal and Bobo le Clown this weekend. I never really liked golfing – but this time I had fun! Hal and Bobo are good people to golf with. They don’t get mad if you hit it on the wrong fairway and decide you can pick it up and play it from wherever you want. Afterwards, I had three tall, cool glasses of Diet Coke. What a refreshing experience!

I swear, when sack of trash behind the front desk sends out an e-mail letting us know the birthday cake for the month hath been unleashed, the people in floor below us must wonder where we suddenly got a charging head of cattle.  It's like they've never had cake before...or eaten befoe or something.  So HAL...lay it on me.  What happened with uh...Jan?

      I just had the most terrifying experience.  I visited the link Panda put on there.  That Peter Pan guy frightens the living shit out of me.    I was going to post the following little Halloween story on Soft Drink, but since it's collapse, I've got no choice but to put it here.  Sorry. -----  Holly-ween   In October of 1996, I moved from Minnesota to California to pursue a career working in film and what-not.  At the time, I was married, but my uh...wife wasn't going to move out until November.  I basically had a month to 'set-up' camp.  After struggling for a week without work, I landed a job working on the set of Dante's Peak.  It was a crappy volcano movie...you don't remember it.  Since I was alone and had nary a friend, some clowns at work invited me to a Halloween party.  I thought:  Sure.  I can rub elbows with some big shots and maybe get in good for the next film crew they set up.   Of course I needed a costume and I didn't have one.  Time to hit the stores.  I bought a nun costume.  I know it's lame to do nowadays, but back then I had a real thing about being religious people.  I've been Moses (complete with Ten Commandments) Jesus Christ, and a nun.  But I wasn't going to be any ordinary nun.  No sir.  I bought some additional accessories for my get-up.  Once I was back at my dumpy apartment, I got dressed for the big night.  I hit the streets dressed as a cigar-smoking nun wearing combat boots, wearing an eyepatch and sporting a tommy gun.  It was so cool, and I looked so stupid.  I drove way out into the valley to go to this party and since I'd only been there a couple weeks anyway, it wasn't an easy chore to find.  Luck was on my side and I got there in full effect.  I saw the costumes other people were wearing and I smacked myself in the forehead.  I worked with the Special FX department at Digital Domain and EVERYONE was wearing really elaborate costumes.  It made me want to cry.  I looked like a cheap, stocky nun with shitty accessories.  Shame on me.  The only way to get over this, of course, was to drink.  So I drank.  And drank.  And driz-ank.  Sometime over the course of the evening, I befriended a crippled pirate and exchanged quips with a docile Frankenstein's Monster. (it's true! click  urlLink HERE ) I was out of my skull drunk.  Take how drunk HAL was at Pandyland Burrito Jamboree and multiply it by 8.  I was drunk.  I could smell booze coming out of my pores.  People were holding their mugs beneath my sweaty nun robes to fill their cups.  Drunk.  I had such a great time, I must've sat down to absorb the atmosphere.  The whole party was outside on a patio decortated all spooky-like.  I sat in a lawn chair and laughed, shot people with my fake gun and had a blast.  Cut to tomorrow morning.  I woke up and I had no idea where I was.  I was sitting in someone's backyard on a rickety lawn chair.  I looked down and saw that I was wearing a black dress and had some kind of dumb scarf thing on my head.  On my lap was a plastic cigar.  In one hand, I held onto an empty plastic cup that smelled like beer.  In the other hand, I was gripping a plastic Thompson machine gun.  What in the sweet name of Christ happened to me?  The sun was out, there was dew on the grass and I had no idea where I was or how I'd gotten there.  The Halloween party had been taken down and no one bothered to wake me up. I promptly stood up, staggered through the stranger's lawn and began to look for my car.  Best Halloween ever, man.  HAPPY HALLOWEEN Pandyland!!!

      Today I had a terrifying experience.  One of the guys I work with came to the office dressed as one of the Village People.  And I thought Britney Spears was the only one who thought that was cool.  I'm reminded of last year when Billygoat and I dressed up as Tinkerbell and Peter Pan for Halloween.  Billygoat in tights...it must have been love.  At least he wasn't as feminine as  urlLink this guy .

      Greetings, Pandyland!  As Panda mentioned, I'm currently in NYC staying with my bro/sis-in-law (aka "my peeps") for the week.  Last evening Panda and I walked by a trendy-looking bar at about 5:30pm.  There were a few people inside, baracades at the ready outside, and big promotional posters for a certain heartthrob's new CD by the entrance.  Seems we had stumbled upon a party for Nick Carter (aka a Backstreet Boy and Britney's rumored new squeeze for those not in-the-know).  We flirted with the idea of waiting a few hours for the chance to scream at Nick and his party people as they arrived to celebrate his fantastic new release.  But then we went into a non-trendy bar around the corner and had beers.  I don't regret our choice (yet).  While here, I've been enjoying the HBO provided by my hosts.  I saw the Sopranos (yes, it's great) and it was weird to see it only a day after it originally aired.  I'm used to being way behind on it (and Sex in the City, too) as I catch it on DVD.  More importantly, I've finally seen "Curb Your Enthusiasm".  HILARIOUS!  Now I know what Duf has been talking about!!!  More updates to follow.  Congrats, Stoner!!

      Just to let y'all know - HAL is here in NYC!  We just went to lunch.  What a nice surprise!  Of course, she's a little too "busy" to spend any evenings with the founder of Pandyland.  I had big plans for the girl and got shot down.  Ouch!  Yes, DJS, I went to see Dancer in the Dark...twice.  Billygoat was the one who cried like the little beyotch he is.  Crocodile tears.  Stoner, the only reason I knew that was a Laffy Taffy joke was because I love candy almost as much as you do.  And obviously I buy them for the candy, not the laugh-potential.

       Stoner:  I'm so proud of you I just don't know what else to say.  That's awesome!!!  Hurray for you!  Who's your agent?  Do they publish Children's Books?  'Cause I've got one, you know...  All seriousness aside, I should point out that tomorrow we should find out who won the 24 Hour Short Story Contest both Stoner and myself entered.  I'm hoping to win all the money.   Panda:  Despite what that Bono-nut HAL says, Selmasongs is a damn good album.  Of course, I'm guessing you've seen the movie.  I don't want to sound like a panty-waist, but I cried like a little beyotch.  It's probably one of the best films...EVER.   Duf:  Sorry about Soft Drink.  Can you find it in your heart to forgive?   HAL:  Where are you?

      Panda, you are so smart. That  was  off a laffy taffy wrapper.   In other news, I am so proud of myself! In my writing class, I wrote an essay about swimming. I sent it to a little magazine here in town, called Twin Cities Sports. And do you know what? I think they just might print it. They said “probably” – but first I will have to make it a little longer.   I have not yet counted any chickens, but I am still very excited!

      It's about time I openly bashed the company I work for.  I highly doubt anyone who works here reads this anyway, so it probably doesn't matter if it's proclaimed here or not.  DDS sucks.  Today I was told I am "hostile" and that I "need to take control of [my] own career."  I should not wait until someone delegates work to me.  Anyone who knows me  at all  knows that I'm the LAST person on earth to wait to take action.  I'm laughing my ass off right now.  Anyone in the Twin Cities need a maid?  Cleaning toilets would be better than the shit I take here.  Pardon the non-intended pun.

      Hey kids...rock n' roll, rock on...etc.  Well, I got sick on Wednesday and here I am back at work a changed man.  After diagnosing that I really abuse my stomach with some of my dining choices, I've decided that I'm going caffiene free.  Can you believe it?  Not only am I NEVER eating Asian food again, but my days of delicious Diet Coke are behind me.  *sigh*  Today marks the fourth day I've gone without that precious natural resource.  Did I go through withdrawals?  Yes.  Did I get crazy headaches that lasted a 1.5 days?  Yes.  Have I kicked the habit?  It appears that I have.  So...alas, I'm different already because of this.  Not that this is a bad thing, but I'm not NEARLY as hyper as I used to be. CK 2 even commented that she can see the change in me.  Jesus...what was I like before?  My new beverage of choice?  Water.  Yep.  Water.  Not nearly as exciting or effervescent, but it's for my own good.  Poop.

      Anyone who knows me pretty well knows that I love monkeys.  My brother gave me an "adopt-an-orangutan" kit for a present and now I am the proud mother of a funny looking monkey in Borneo named "Einstein."  I also love that Sprint PCS commercial highlighting the "monkey with a cold."  No, not a "movie that is old."  How cute is he with those Kleenexes?  Pretty darn cute.  Before the Snipers were caught, Billygoat and I commented on the $15 or so million they were asking for ransom money.  We thought the people of Maryland could have a fund raising activity...perhaps a "Bowling for Snipers" telethon. People could take pledges and then the Sniper would get one of those big, monstrous checks like they give away for Publisher's Clearing House.  But then we thought that might not be a good idea for the Sniper because then everyone would see him.  It's a thought anyway.  I picked up and listened to  Selmasongs  today after it had collected dust over the last year.  What a musical spectacular.  Bjork is one talented imp.  I remember how happy I was the first time I listened to this album, and in my excitement, I called up HAL to share my good fortune.  She very unenthusiastically informed me that a "certain coworker" of hers had the album too and played it all the damn time.  I guess she didn't like it as much as me and the "certain coworker" did.  Hmmmm.  I'm going solo to my cousin's wedding this weekend.  My brother and dad already promised a dance with me.  Great, that's all I need to feel better - to dance with a couple of 6' 6" buffoons.  There better be an all-night open bar.  Or the DJ better play U2-all-night-long.    Things have been pretty slow around these parts.  I go to NYC again next week, so hopefully things will pick up by then.  Cheers!

       Christina Aguilera is trampy.  I just saw this thing on MTV where she performed under the Brooklyn bridge and then was interviewed by Carson Daly.  I have also seen her "Dirty" video (though I'm kinda surprised by everyone's outrage there - it's not like they've undercovered Snow White's secret porn flick).  So there's my judgement for today.

       Burn Junkie   This morning I found myself thinking about the summer vacation I took with my family in August.  We were in the south, in a state where there are fire ants.  At midweek, the mid-point of our trip, a fire ant bit me on my right foot.  For the uninitiated, fire ant bites start with a pinch-like sting, then leave a burning sensation that spreads an inch in every direction from the bite epicenter.  About an hour after the bite, my foot was red in a circle (one inch in diameter) and graced by a mild itching sensation.  At that moment, I realized that I loved the entire thing: the bite, the sting, the burn and the itch.  On the last day of our vacation, I went back to the fire ant hill and stood there on my left foot until I was bitten again (less than ten seconds).  This morning, as the mercury strived for 30 fahrenheit and the wind pushed hard for the 20's, I understood that soon winter will come to the entire country and the fire ants that were so kind to me a couple of months ago will be gone.

      Hiya Kids...  Nah, I didn't go into hiding, I just decided to shut ol' Soft Drink down for a multitude of reasons.  Below, here are a few:   1.  Now that I don't have as much to complain about, content has been kind of thin.  2.  It got to be more trouble than fun maintaining daily content.  3.  People (in my old circle of friends) have made my goings-on the topic of too many drunken conversations.  4.  A lot of clowns misunderstood or would read the wrong tone in some of my posts.  5.  I want to do something different with the Soft Drink moniker.  Something big, fresh, exciting...  I've gotten a ton of e-mails about the site shutting down already and I feel kind of bad about it.  No worries, though.  I plan to get back in the blogging mix again with a new and improved page of sorts.  When?  Don't know.  Until then, I've got Pandyland to frequent and I hope to get working on my 2nd book.  It's almost finished, so I'll probably post more on my sister site:  How I Got Published (or tried anyway)...

      I’m running into a little trouble here this morning. I’m tired. And I keep zoning out. I keep catching myself staring off into space, and I don’t even remotely look like I am working.  I have become a zombie.

        Little Purple Pill/A Guy from Nebraska/I'm in love   I'm pretty sure I have acid reflux disease...it was only a matter of time.  Anyway, it was a good run for me, and now it is time for me to get right with God.  At DJS's on Saturday night some guy named Murray mixed up a concoction called a...well, I don't know what it was called.  Anyway, it was a shot of Jaegermeister submerged in half a glass of Red Bull.  It was surprisingly delicious.  It tasted like a sweet tart.  I have to give Milton props for a great drink.  I had one.  DJS had 2 (at least).  HAL had none.  But Marcus begged her every time he poured one.  Anyway, this guy Manny was from Nebraska.  Just throwing that out there.  In an unrelated news item, I'm in love with Bjork (add your own umlaut/diaresis).  She is a total artist, and she is well pierced.

      Hey thanks!  I had a great time on Saturday, even if it was a bit low-key.  There were a couple of moments through the day where I stopped and looked at DJ LZ and was like: "Holy shit.  I'm 30!"  But all in all, it wasn't so bad.  I guess when I hit 35 or 40, I'll just spend the day weeping or something.  Thanks for stopping by and for the book, HAL.  It's going into the rotation immediately and from a cursory flip-through, it should be right up my alley.  Thanks!!!

      About Soft Drink...  I don't know that I'm gonna put a link on Pandyland to Soft Drink.  It'd be kind of weird, like bridging two different worlds together that really should be kept seperate.  Who knows, maybe if I lighten up a bit and not worry about it so much.  Of course, one of my big concerns is that I've got two different blogging 'handles' and it might be confusing to those who don't know who I am.  Does that make me a jerk?  Quite frankly, I'm amazed anyone even reads Soft Drink, so...  Since tomorrow is the big 3-0 for me, Duf, CK2 and I are going to see  The Ring  today on company time.  We're calling it 'Team Building.'  I call it getting the hell out of the office for a good 2 hours or so.  Best...birthday...ever.

      Hey guys,  DJS - Nice work with the links and photo page!  Me likey.  Any chance we'll get a link to soft drink? ;)  Me also likey not working.  This morning mom and I went for facials, then to Cafe Latte for lunch.  While Cafe Latte is normally a great lunch spot it was more crowded then I'd ever seen it (due to MEA weekend??) and I felt rushed through the line by the pair behind us.  It used up all the relaxation I had banked up the hour before.  The crazy woman behind us kept telling her friend that she got her teeth "from the bone bank - doesn't that sound weird?".  For the record lady, yes it does.  She repeated it several times to her buddy, though I'm sure the she heard it each time, just like all the rest of us did.  Then she said "some people died from knee parts that they got from the bone bank, I hope that doesn't happen to me!!"  Well, I disagree.  I hope she dies.  While in St. Paul I swung by the UST bookstore (long story).  It was really weird to be in such a familar place with not a single familar face  - except for a glimpse of Fr. Lavin shuffling through Murray-Herrick (speaking of people about to die...).  Anyway, not much has changed, though the Grill got all new chairs and tables and it looks pretty nice.  No update on "Scooters", though.  Sorry, Panda.

I think part of it is that I've been a writin' whore on Soft Drink, so I guess I gots to wait until I have some exclusive fun to drop on Pandyland.  Panda, if you find any cool jobs in your travels, let me know.  I'm fed up with this place.  Yeee...

      Sorry Stoner.  I can't talk for the other Pandyland slobs, but I've been caught up in job-searching mania.    I think Pandyland Bratwurst Jamboree is a perfect name...not only does it touch on a Milwaukee delicacy, it has the same PBJ initials.  Brilliant!  You should be in communications or something.

      TRI-MENDOUS work, DJS.  The e-mail has been sent to my brother, requesting his floorspace.  Let's hope he remains the coolest brother ever and lets us stay with him.  This is  definitely  on.  No hoax.  I know at least HAL is with me.  And Stoner and Duf can be suckered into anything.

      To quote Bjork: "Sometimes the things I do astound me."  Some of our 'special features' are up and running already kids.  Not bad for a half hour's work.   Milwaukee:  Are we seriously going to do this?  I'll cry myself to sleep if I find out this is just some kind of hoax.  I think it'd be a damn good time in America's Heartland.  Last time I went there (to see Tenacious D) I got so drunk that I couldn't hear.

Do we have any requests for links?  I think we should set up a group Pandyland@yahoo.com e-mailbox in case some visitors decide to send us a message.  We can all have access to it and respond or check mail periodically.  Also, when I get some time, I'll slap together a link that can take us to the Pandyland picture page.  Everything is possible, yo.  P.S. I wonder if Gino finished that sack of grass.

      Regarding The Milwaukee Pandyland Gala: it's  really  hard to find body-building midgets on this short notice.  I might have to resort to finding a group of drunk girls who don't mind doing Jigs on street corners.  Oh wait...  My little brother doesn't know it yet, but we will be staying with him.  If asked, he will wear his Angry Scotsman wig and Kilt apron to join us on Water Street in style.  Stay tuned...

      So now that the pics are "live" on Ofoto.com, who needs Admin rights to put 'em up on this site (or at least via link)?  DJS?  Are you up to the task?  The no-links look of this site has become a bit mundane.  Let's spice things up!  (However, that does not mean we need to resort to polls and Survivor-style tactics.  Yech.)

       Props to Panda for the great pics!!  You'd think by this point in my life I'd know enough not to drink near flashbulbs, but alas, I am naive.    Speaking of Panda, last night she told me that she's busy planning the Milwaukee-flavored jamboree.  So don't expect too many post from her - you have no idea what it takes to organize a parade on short notice.  Or am I saying too much??  Stoner, no more wart-related posts, please.  In return, I'll publicly acknowledge the fact that you kicked my ass in "Stratego" again last night.  THAT'S sharing.

       At its height, the internet, like a vibrant democracy, provides a forum for the free exchange of ideas.  As a community, we can work toward consensus and truth by debating issues of the day and elevating responses that are sound logically, ideologically, philosophically.   Within the internet community, a blog, and in particular a group blog like this is a distillation of that forum.  Together, us members of Pandyland can develop synergy and a higher collective understanding.  We are all like mountain climbers progressing toward a summit and infinitely more likely to reach it because we are not working alone, but, rather, in concert with like minded people.  We are a team focused on a single goal.  In order for us to reach that goal, we need to feel that we can talk about things freely and openly.  So, when Panda shares her story of love on the rocks, we are, as a community, elevated.  When HAL told her story of back pain, we were enriched.  DJS's deep sharing about his love of the Band the Eels was awe-inspiring.    And in that spirit, I would like to thank Stoner for bringing us all closer together, for stimlulating a marketplace where ideas can be exchanged, and for bringing us all closer to higher truths by sharing her story about her struggles to overcome plantars warts.  Which everyone knows come from sinful living and not swimming pools.  Are you right with God, Stoner?  You must be because the smite was lifted!    But I digress from praising Stoner for helping us on our climb:  can you see the summit friends?   Also, DJS, I would like to suggest the band name:  This Treatment (with mad props to Stoner).

      Okay, I'm only admitting this because they are gone now, but I used to have plantars warts all over the bottoms of my feet. I was a swimmer all through high school and college, and pool decks and locker room showers are hotbeds for wart "seeds" as my mom called them.  Anyways, I just read about  urlLink  this treatment  and it made me cringe.  Still, it probably isn't worse than what I endured. I went to the doctor every other week for a few months, and she would cover each wart in a liquid that caused big, deep blisters. I'd have to poke them with a safety pin, and would limp around until they peeled and healed.   (Note to DJS -- I think "Peeled and Healed" would be a good band name.)  Needless to say, these days I never EVER go near a locker room or pool deck without flip flops on.

      I just got Panda’s pics. Man, the PBJ was great. I miss it.   In other news, I tripped going up the stairs at work today, right in front of a guy I used to think was cute. For the record, I stopped thinking he was cute when I heard how many times he’s dipped his nib in the office ink (as they say in  Bridget Jones’s Diary ) – but that didn’t make the wipeout any less embarrassing.

      She's gone for the day, so I'll sneak to her cube and eyeball the situation.  1. The drink is still in the glass. 2. It's still pink. (she thought we'd staged it and just used pink lemonade) 3. I could be wrong, but it looks like a little of it is missing.  She might've taken a sip of it by mistake here at work. 4. Believe it or not, she didn't throw it away.  It's still sitting out in plain view.  I'm going to go over and take a digital picture of it.

      I thought knowing the fate of the drink would be enough – but it only triggered more questions:  1. Was the drink still actually in the glass?  2. How did it look by Monday morning?  3. Did she drink it?  4. If not, what did she do with it?

      What a night.  Expertly captured by D to tha U to tha F.  Here's some of the things that stuck in my head:   1.  Come to think of it...I WON'T have a Heineken.  2.  Pick it up! Pick it up! pick it up!  3.  The men's bathroom.  Smelled like old vomit and heaven help the person who needs to go in there for an extended visit.  4.  That idiot dancing and grooving by the jukebox.  Went home alone.  5.  The look on Gino's face when HAL said we were having a Jig-Off.  6.  'God Made All Of This' MC's' tyrade about God.  Yeah, he's responsible for Gin N' Juice and all of the human filth and garbage in the Country Bar.  If he made all of that...he must've taken the day off.  7.  My repeated threats to wreck the place only fueled my Bon Jovi performance.  I had a damn good time...really!  A Milwaukee road trip really should happen.  Hit Water Street in high style, and bring a laptop so that we can blog in real-time.  How damn cool would that be???

      To quote DJS: Duf Fer's PBJ1 play-by-play is "COMEDY PLATINUM."  I couldn't have said it better.  Thanks to all who came out for our night of debauchery.  The film (evidence) has been turned in and photos will be distributed this week.  The rest of the weekend did not involve excessive amounts of alcohol, but it definitely involved excessive amounts of fun - the highlight being at the movie theater's photo sticker booth: Jillios, Stoner, HAL, and Panda have been forever emblazoned on a "Girls Rule" sticker.  Sorry Stoner - to really be part of the club, you must buy a cell phone to stick it to.    See y'all at PBJ2 - maybe we should screw Milwaukee and head someplace warm - perhaps New Orleans?  We could invite Gino to judge Jig Off Part Deux - "Who Can Show the Most Skin."  On second thought, I don't want to be on the next "Girls Gone Wild" video.  Milwaukee is a better idea.  Beer, cheese, & sausage...Delicious!

       Pandyland Burrito Jamboree (PBJ1 - to those in the know):   Would You Rather  read a really long post about the PBJ1 or be forced to read bunghole for a week?  Where to begin...  The  Beatnik Chicken ? The  Flavor Twists ?  CK 2's Cocktail ?  No, I think we all know where we have to begin...the  Jig Off!   Like all official competitions that take place on Lyndale avenue after bar, our jig off need a judge and got one:   Jig Judge Gino .  HAL jigged. Panda jigged. C...e jigged.  Gino studied the jigs intensely (too intensely?) and picked HAL as the winner.  So, for those of you scoring at home, the winner of the First (annual? semi-annual?  monthly?)  Pandyland Burrito Jamboree Jig Off  was HAL (for the record, DJS and your humble narrator did not compete).  I think Gino kissed HAL, but I'm not sure.  Gino shared his  Flavor Twists  with all PBJ1 attendees who were daring enough to eat them.  Then, the ever cool (and primarily toothless) Gino declined our offer to go on and on until the break of dawn because, to quote  Jig Judge Gino  directly  "I'm fittin' to go home and smoke me some weed."  Does he know that marijuana is contraband listed among the items prohibited by our state's controlled substances statute?  Who knew we were partying with a miscreant?  But wait it gets worse...  We take the party over to  Super Big Mike's Subs  or whatever the phuck it's called and it was too lame to tame so we go to Dulono's for some pie (except your ambitious author who had the grilled cheese), and our waiter memorized the orders for the entire table (including beverages, toppings, and everything).  We declare:   "he's a genius,"  and he replies  "no, I just smoke a lot of pot."   Is it me, or is the entire nation on the wacky tobacky?  A  Beatnik Chicken  watched and  Simon and Garfunkel  provided (inaudible - no amped music after 12:00) background music to the meal.  But, before I poo poo the Stoner Nation, the criminal world, I must report that the Pandyland crew pulled a couple of  PBJ1 Capers :  Your earnest secretary stole  CK2's Cocktail  glass from the  Country Bar  and DJS (a patriot if ever there was one) stole his  American Flag Glass  from Dulono's.  He claims it was their fault for putting the flag on it.  Frankly, I agree.  But I haven't mentioned the  Country Bar  at all:  The Karaoke master was a limp dicked nobody.  We were surrounded by freaks.  One guy came up to the table and asked DJS  "Do you have any reps at this table?"   We still don't know what the phuck that means.  DJS said "no."  Another guy, after singing Snoop Dogg covers thirteen or fourteen times, challenged DJS's assertion that there was no God (because what God would deny us the mic when others had it all night long?) by saying  "look around you - God created this."   Then, as proof that God  is  real, and really does create stuff,  DJS Got the Mic , and I assure you God was in him while he brought the hizzy dizzy with his holy spirit filled rendition of Bon Jovi's  You Give Love a Bad Name .  He really brought the house down (all the way down).  Now, to end with the quotes of the night (in no particular order.  I asked Gino to judge, them and he said "man, cough...cough...cough...they are all...like...beautiful man.  It would be like...cough...wrong to judge man.").  So here they are:  "Come to Milwaukee!"  Hmmm...PBJ 2? "Are we going to Gino's or what?" "I want the dick." "Gonorrhea all the way." "Would you rather...?" "I can't run, I have a cocktail in my pants." "Would you pass me a niz-ap-kin?"  All in all, PBJ1 was a HUGE success.

      Warning! There are jokes on specially marked Diet Coke bottles. To get the punchline, you have to go to their web site. DO NOT GO TO THEIR SITE. The jokes suck. They aren’t funny at all. Okay – one was semi-funny, but not funny enough to justify wasting valuable web-surfing time.   I’m so disappointed. I expected more from the world’s largest soda manufacturer. You'd think they would spring for the good jokes.

       News Flash:   Duf Fer and I just got back from a quick jaunt to Rainbow Foods where I was asked to pick up some treats for a training session.  Wait...you mean I can get out of the office for an additional half hour?  Sold, baby.  So we're listening to the Rolling Stones 2 Disc set we each purchased within the last few days.  At the food depot, we snatch some cupcakes and a nice box of cookies and we're good to go.  On the way out, I head down the pasta aisle.  Why?  Don't know.  I just did...but now, I wonder if it's fate.  On the lower shelf where no one can really see them is the most beautiful value pack this Blogger has ever laid eyes on.  5 boxes of delicious original Kraft Macaroni & Cheese packaged together with a bonus.  What bonus, you ask?  Why...a free E.T. bendable figurine, staring back at us from the cellophane box he's held hostage in.  " Gimme ," I said and scooped it up.  At a price of $3.99 I was more than sold.  At the counter, the lady asked if I had an Easy Save card.  Does the Pope shit in the woods?  Of course I do.  She swiped it and it was as thought the band started playing the parade song early.  Her eyes widened as she told me about the savings I was about to reap.  " This is a good deal ," Linda the Rainbow lady quiped.  " You saved half. "  $2.00???  Yes friends.  Five boxes of deliciousness and a little brown friend to keep you company.  Life is good.  So good in fact that Duf ran back down the aisle and fetched a Blue Box Value Pack for himself.  As he was checking out, I spied the offer on the back of the boxes.  For a mere $14.99, you can have you child's picture put onto a box of macaroni & cheese, right below the banner that says "The Cheesiest."  Now, I don't have any kids, but...well, let's say I've spent my money in worse ways.  Sold!  P.S. I'm anxious as all get out for the Pandyland Jamboree tonight.  Gonna rock this town...  (I'm so excited, I'm posting this on Soft Drink, too.)

      Ummm…P. Diddy? Busta? I don’t know who sings that. Give me more lines.   I just interviewed the biggest “character” at my company. He absolutely, positively, completely and totally loves direct mail with all of his heart. And if you ask him how he is, he’ll say something along the lines of “I am so incredibly wonderful right now, it’s almost impossible to be any better.”   When I first interviewed him last year, he tried to get me to change my auto insurance. Today he filled me in on the entire history of sales, marketing, and direct mail. (It was actually quite interesting.) He is definitely the king of “leave silence and someone will fill it” which left me cracking some pretty confused one-liners in hopes of getting the subject back on track.   I knew I was in for it when I walked into his office and sat down – the first words out of his mouth were “so when are you getting married?” to which I replied “um…someday? I hope? I am currently un-engaged, with no plans to get engaged in the near future…” He just looked at me with a straight face. I couldn’t figure out if he was going to set me up with a grandson or something. (He’s old enough to be retired, but loves direct mail too much to quit.)   I think he tries to shake things up at the start of every conversation, and that’s why he has so much fun. Either that or he’s crazy…like a fox.   Finally, Panda I hope that meow was coming from you and not from me (Coco) because I don’t like cats.

      DJS, I read your recent posting on Soft Drink - I  knew  you would like  urlLink  The Best Page in the Universe .  When I read it, half the stuff sounded like your own posts.  Comedic insults galore!  I especially like the article "People who like David Lynch movies are idiots."    NYC really smells.  That's something I will never miss about this city.  When you're walking down the street you get whiffs of sewage, hot dog water, and then patchouli.  Yes, patchouli.  There are these guys that sell this nasty incense stuff on the street.  Who the hell ever thought that patchouli was a nice scent?  I'd rather bathe in hot dog water any day.  All you hippies stink.  I'm serious.    On a more cheerful note - I can't wait for tonight.  What could be better than drinking cheap beer and listening to the melodious sound of Duf's voice?  Coco's comin' out too - I can feel it!  Meow!

[cue guitars] Sweet Home Alabama [guitar interlude] Where the skys are blue [more guitar here] Sweet Home Alabama [yep, guitar] I'll be comin' home to you.  Panda, make sure to show some love for DJS and Duf when out shopping!  "Tonight's the night we make history!"  Stoner, who sings that?

      Roy? Sounds like a Grade A suckerhead.  Eff him.  I'm getting a little antsy in anticipation for the hoe-down tomorrow night.  Is that crazy?  I don't know if it's because I haven't been out and about for quite some time, but I'm looking to get a little surly (not really) and pick a fight with a bearded biker (no, I won't) and end up picking up my teeth off of the sidewalk (never happen).  I know my boss CK 2 is looking forward to seeing me rock the mic...and I'll be soooo disappointed if Duf doesn't throw something down vocally.  I think the boy has got real singing chops.  I'm pretty sure he can sing the pantalones vaqueros off of anyone in the joint.  And yes...he's going to win all the money.  All the money.

      I just looked at the weather and it's supposed to be 30 frickin degrees in Minneapolis this weekend.  I may have to reconsider my visit.  It's 60 in NY right now.  How does one pack for such extremes??  I took a walk last night after work.  When I'm here in NY by myself, I don't have many options for things to do: I either go back to my hotel room and watch way too much TV and eat a bag of Pirate's Booty (my favorite), or I go wander around until the stores close and spend money.  I opted for the latter.  I walked aimlessly south.  I found myself in the middle of NYU's campus and thought about Ben, Felicity, Noel...and then remembered that they aren't real people...and that the show isn't even on anymore.  *tear*  Then I went through my favorite part of town: on Broadway through Chelsea, then south of Houston (hence "SoHo"), and through the Village.  I went to my favorite market in SoHo, to the cheesy junk stores in Chinatown, and then to Dean & Deluca.    I may have a nice surprise for HAL and Stoner because of my aimlessness.  And the fact that I like to buy stuff for people when I'm bored.

      I want to clear up a misconception.   The correct pronunciation of my name is not "Duff Furr" as many people seem to think.  It is:  "Do Fair."  It's French.    Thanks,  Duf Fer  P.S.  Panda, I saw the Portland pics.  I got all blurry just looking at some of them.  Anyhoo, I think we will out do the donut extravaganza no problem.  Both Stoner and HAL represent (as in "rep-RAH-zaint").

      Stoner, I agree.  We just had a belated birthday celebration for 2 people on my team.  Someone brought Dunkin Donuts and we sat around and talked about stupid TV shows like the Bachelor and the Real World ("those girls are SLUTS!") and then we went back to our desks.  What a waste of time.  And no one even sang the birthday song.  So  urlLink here's something  that made me laugh out loud this morning.  "Good job Kelly, now pack up your shit and find a foster home."   I needed that after the weak Donut Extravaganza.  Let's hope our Burrito Jamboree is more festive.

      Why is it that when we write something cheesy in a greeting card, we sometimes feel compelled to add the words “just kidding”?   I just did that – as if my coworker would think I was serious when I wrote “birthdays are so great, you should have them more often!” For one thing, isn’t even possible. Still, I felt I needed to add that just in case she didn’t get my sense of humor.   Workplace celebrations are awkward.

      Stoner, to satisfy your love of rap and my love of duets, we should sing a little diddy that combines both.  I betcha "Walk This Way" by Aerosmith/Run DMC would work.  We could each trade off the mic during the chorus.    I just want to hear you scream "WALK THIS WAY!" as I respond with a more subdued "Talk this way."  Hey, I deserve it.  After that I have a wedding ring we can pawn off for more beer money.

      Two 'rritos (I thought they needed a nickname) and Lil' Sickie WILL be there, I assure you. Coco will have no trouble with the four drinks though, after her training camp last weekend. And the Reaper's Assistant wants to borrow your cell phone.   I know my demands don't carry much weight since I do not intend to sing (my only karaoke experience thus far has been in the rap genre), but I swear heads will roll if I don't hear someone do a duet with Panda. I mean it.

I'm prepared to announce that Coldplay's  A Rush of Blood to the Head  is the album of the year.  Everyone has to listen to it during the Jamboree.  No exceptions.  HAL, let me know if you need five faces.  Now all we need is a reason for Panda and HAL to get "they drank" ( all the way ) iz-on...k...give me a moment...  DJS I'm thinking  Sweet Child O' Mine .

      Wow...my reputation as a crank caller is spreading.  Crazy.  Of course, I'd be happy to lend my services.  I've even got equipment to record the calls so we can enjoy it at another time.  Options, baby.  We're talking options...  But yes...the Burrito Karaoke Marathon is going to be the bizz-omb.  It's been a while since I've done that.  Uh...sing in public that is.  The burrito consumption remains on the strong tip.  I really hope HAL pulls through and finds a good place to rock the mic, though.  Elsie's isn't really condusive for the kind of entertainment that we're prepared to provide.  It's busy and the fat lady that runs it wants me dead, I'm pretty sure.

      Now that the P-town excitement has died down, I can focus my energy on gearing up for the Pandyland Burrito/Karaoke Jamboree!  In other news, our crazy neighbors still have anti-window-washer paraphernalia on their door. I wonder how long it will last. If y'all wanted, we could knock on their door and confront them as part of the Jamboree. Or, I've heard DJS is a master crank-caller -- maybe we should try to get their phone number...it's probably listed on one of their faxes or memos to our apartment management company...

      I spent last weekend in Portland with Stoner and Mrs. Headrick.  It was a fabulous time, but I just realized that every time I leave the state with Stoner, a new alter-ego pops up, a la Sybil.  "The Reaper's Assistant" now joins "Lil Sickie" and "Coco".  Panda, hold on to the invites.  They will be soon be valuable collectors items.  Sell 'em on Ebay!!!

       Panda B:  Yeah, I'm guessing your talking about the ass-play scene with Ralphie and Janice.  Uh...not sure where that came from.  They're doing everything in their power to make that character even more repulsive than he was in the previous episode.  Mission accomplished.  Admittedly, though...I tend to like the REALLY bad guy (Ralphie) and the REALLY nice guy in the show (Bobby).  Ironically, they're both going to get mixed up with each other because of that pig Janice.  Joey Fat-one?  My girlfriend would be thrilled.  She's all about the N'Stink.  Oh...I can't wait to see what next week holds.  If you haven't watched the show, pick up an episode or two at the video store.  Be like us!  Best show EVER.   Duf:  Watched most of Curb Your Enthusiasm last night.  It's actually pretty damn funny.

      I forgot to tell y'all about seeing Joey Fatone from N'Sync on Monday.  Billygoat and I decided to press our luck and try to get rush tickets to Rent.  BG was a lucky man and his name got called - we got front row seats to Rent for $20 a piece.    And Joey Fatone was the star.  During their standing ovation we were seriously 1 foot from him.  I told BG he should touch his shoe, just to say he touched one of the members of N'Sync.    He said that wouldn't be something to brag about.  So what was with that one scene in the Sopranos this week?  If you saw it, you  know  what I'm talking about.  Ewwwww.

      You know, Stoner might be onto something.  One of the reasons we're all here in the first place was because Stoner was so close to getting 'booted' from that crappy little site from before.  Uh...Butthole.com or something...I don't know, but I'm sure it was anus-related.  With our 'the-truth-hurts' brand of comments we left on that aforementioned site, we started a revolution...and a rivalry.  People were actually interested in Crapbox.com for a day or two.  Kind of funny that Panda got the El Boot (Spanish for 'The Boot') and thus Pandyland was born.  Anyway, glad to be back in the hizzy.

      Panda - report back on the status of "The Big Breakfast" - I believe they cancelled it about a year ago, I think I heard something like that when I was there.  Pathetic!  I was just mourning the loss of "TFI Friday"!!!  Other than that, HAVE A GREAT TRIP, you lucky sod.  DJS, I don't think there's R-B's, but there are other foodstuffs to make up for it.  Panda would argue for "flapjacks", Stoner would argue for Kronnenburg, I would argue for the candy.  And Duf, it's stuffing.

      Unfortunately, DJS, I think  we're  our only fans.  :(  So I'm off to London/Brussels tomorrow evening and  can't wait .  I can't wait to eat  real  fish and chips, watch the Big Breakfast, go to some good Indian Restaurants, attend an evensong at Westminster Abbey, eat Belgian chocolate, and talk to many British men.  What I will not do: buy Belgian lace.  For some screwed  up reason my mom is sad that I'm not more into the lace-thing.  It's not like I plan on ever decorating with doilies, so I don't know what the problem is.  I met a friend for drinks a couple days ago when I was in NY.  We had traveled through Thailand together (not really by choice, he happened to be in my MBA class) and so I think he’s under the impression that we have this eternal “bond.”  Since I’m usually bored out of my mind when I’m in NYC for business, I hastily accepted his invitation.  Not much has changed with him since I last saw him a year ago – he’s still a chachi frat boy who can’t let go of the frat boy days when beer bongs were cool.  So the intellectual stimulation was minimal, but the scotch consumption was definitely to the maximum (which I bought on DDS’ tab, by the way).  Me?  I just had a glass of free champagne that came with my room.  So after getting the $70 bar tab and walking out of the place, he actually said to me…”You know, if I didn’t have a girlfriend right now, we could get it  on .”  My reaction: “You gotta be kidding me.”  Guys are complete morons.  Sometimes it sucks to be single again.

      SHOOT ME NOW!!  I just spent my lunch time in the company-provided break room trying to peacefully eat my lunch and read my book.  This request was not granted - instead I had to listen to some clown on her cell phone spend 20 minutes telling someone about her quest to turn some f**king cat picture into her Christmas card this year.  FYI, the picture of her cat was taken last Christmas, prices are much better at Wal-Mart then Proex, and she's already turned the photo into an 8 x 10.  I'm going to kill her.

      Ever gone to  urlLink Haiku Town  and wondered: "Jesus...why hasn't that clod put any new haikus up there?"  Well, there are many theories, one of which is that he's doing it in protest of my old blog  Soft Drink  shutting its doors.  Since I'm not up to recreating something as elaborate as my old bliz-og anytime soon, I decided to fill the void for people just yearning for plain ol' dumb haikus submitted by myself, others and hopefully some of you cats.  I'm pleased to present:  urlLink Discount Haiku .  Enjoy.

       True Confession Time/I'm Free/Helene Beware   I can run, but I cannot hide:  I drink soy milk. Well, if you must know, it's because I'm lactose intolerant.  Please don't give me a hard time about it.  I am intolerant of intolerance of lactose intolerance.  Like DJS, I am caffeine free, baby!  I did not see one second of The Bachelor.  I can say this though.  He is from Missouri; at some point he's become a wife-beater.

      Helene it was! I knew it from the first episode I ever watched -- I wasn't even swayed by Gwen.  In regards to the other items that have been up for discussion lately:  1. I prefer skim milk. My problem is that I only have one glass out of the carton, and before I know it, it's expired. Then I am too scared to remove it from the refrigerator. So I ignore it until Hal yells at me.  2. Caffeine....mmmmmm....bzzzzzzzzz....what was I talking about?  3. Childhood vs. adulthood. I still watch the Muppet movies. That's all that matters, really.   4. My own discussion item - my "social life" as my dad would call it. It's great to be dating someone who is really nice and funny and cute and that I enjoy being around. But in a way it sucks too - because I get all excited to see him, and that means I have to sit in my chair for EIGHT HOURS of torture, wishing the end of the day was here already. It's definitely going to be a long day...expect lots of posts from me...

      Alright, tonight it's going to be Helene all the way.  And my bet is that Aaron pops the question.  This AM my favorite morning DJ, "Scrappy", made some good points.  He said that if he's The Bachelor, he's "not feeling" either of the girls.  He said that Helene is "a cold B" and Brooke is "too clingy".  In his view, "men don't like static cling, especially the female variety".  Scrappy is the new Dr. Phil.

      Wow.  I don't log in for an afternoon and I miss all the good shiz-nit.  Let me tackle the important issues in brief.   1% Milk  - I'm with HAL all the way on this.  I refuse to drink that transparent skim milk sludge.  It's watery, gross and you don't get the good spits from drinking a pint of skim.  Ick...just think of it...  "No...we don't want real milk...let's just SKIM some off the top."   Caffeine  - Tomorrow will mark my one month anniversary of being caffeine free.  Crazy...but that's how it goes.  I'm really beginning to think that caffeine really didn't have that much sway over me.  I'm still able to stay up as late as I need to (1:30am last night) and now I don't get the jitters around 11:30am or so if I don't have a delicious Diet Coke.  Does I miss it?  Yes...but I've got a hard time accepting that something like a frigging Soft Drink had that much of a hold on me.   Kids Stuff  - As you may all be aware, I'm pretty much immune to the 'growing up' requirements.  This is the stuff I STILL do:   1.  Play Vids (or Video Games to the lamen)  2.  Get Happy Meals at McD's  3.  Read comic books  4.  Buy an occasional action figure  5.  Read children's books.  I highly recommend the Series of Unfortunate Events series  6.  Eat Orange Tic Tacs like candy, instead of using them as breath mints  7.  Fart on the phone when I'm talking to my brother  8.  Buy dumb things out of coin machines: super balls, stickers, crappy rings  9.  Think Star Wars is the best movie...ever.

      Duf, "Skorts" should definitely NOT have an asterisk next to them.  They should be outlawed along with "Sweatshirts" considering those two items could make a deadly fashion combination.  Oy!  As Hal can attest to, there is a woman in Minneapolis who wears skorts all the damn time - even in winter.  She is mean...and looks like a clown. "Skorts" must be on the "Appropriate Business Casual Attire" list where she works.

      That's a funny question, because off-hand I can think of a ton of things you are  supposed  to give up, but never do. For me, that is: 1. Sugar cereal for dinner. 2. Saved By the Bell 3. Macoroni & Cheese and hot dogs 4. Taking "gas money" from your parents. 5. Watching Disney movies (ie "Tuck Everlasting") and thoroughly enjoying them. 6. Telling on your brother when he squeezes your hand really, really hard during the "Our Father" at church.  To add to Hal and Duf's list: 4. Riding in a Radio Flyer wagon. 5. Wearing a lot of hot pink (unless you're from New Jersey). 6. Zip shoes (but then again, I see old people take this up again when they're about 80.) 7. Your dad drawing funny cartoon pictures of guys smoking cigarettes on your brown bag lunch. 8. Sofa forts

       HAL and I decided that there are things you have to give up when you become an adult.  Here is a partial list:  1.  Recess 2.  Summer vacation 3.  Whole milk  HAL then proceeded to tell me that she is stuck on 1% milk and refuses to migrate to skim.  I'm all like "What's up with that?" She's all like "I don't want to drink it, it's like water plus."  I'm all like "but it's not fair, we all have made the jump" and she's all like "I'm not going to do it."  I friggin flipped. Like, who does she think she is?  What things do you think people have to give up when the become adults?

      Go see “Bowling for Columbine”.  Saw it the other day, and it was very, very good.  Surprisingly good, in fact.  Different and better than I expected.  “How so”, you ask??  Well, I have an unexpected new admiration for Marilyn Manson.    Being at work again has also been surprisingly great, but so far two people have asked why people keep saying “Welcome Back” to me.  They hadn’t known that I had ever left.  Nice.  I’m not sure how to respond.

      MS Mail...oh God, don't get me started.  I'm pissed that I missed the hastily-arranged Country Bar Meltdown on Saturday.  I was sick as a dog on Friday.  Literally, I was sitting at my desk and felt like I was stoned (not that I have any idea what that's like) with my mouth hanging open and staring at the computer like I was some kind of a-hole.  It got so bad, that I told CK2 that I needed to go off and up out of the place and kill time until DJ LZ (my girlfriend) was ready to head back to the burbs.  So...what'd I do?  "There's a place for fun in your life..."  Mall of America, yo.  I went in, walking like a zombie and purchased a doughnut ala Krispy Kriz-eme and enjoyed a mouth-watering bottle of milk.  From there, I promptly headed to the video game store and played a demo version of Star Wars: The Clone Wars on Gamecube.  I got to fly a ship and kick some ass, but when my guy popped out of the ship and flipped on his lightsaber, the game took a turn for the worst.  It was some bad actor trying to do Mace Windu (Sam Jackson's character) and it stunk.  That, and a bunch of guys hit me with the killing.  Good time-waster, shitty game.  So, in a nutshell, I was too sick later that night for karaoke and such.  But I'm there next time.  P.S. Don't believe the Cocks.  8 Mile was a good flick.

She insists on calling it MS mail.  But then she has had a stick up her @$$ for 51 years, and she's only 50, so...  On an unrelated topic, I think I got a dud CD at the Virgin Records Megastore in Columbus, Ohio.  Here is my moral dilemma (I will not be back in Columbus until the second week of December, and I cannot wait that long to listen to the new Foo Fighters disc):   would I be in the wrong if I took it to Target for an even exchange?   They are such a giant corporation and can better absorb the loss than me, a poor lad who is barely getting by.

      You're right, Duf.  "Final Chapter" was a bit harsh.  Mix beer and HAL, and the Jig Off has the potential to be never-ending.  Living in Minneapolis does sound logical doesn't it?  The thing is, I split my time between Chicago and NYC.  That makes me sound important right?  News flash: I'm not.  I saw "Frida" again last night with a friend here in NY.  Even better the second time!

I am officially broke now, but I beefed up the collection by adding 2 graphic novels (my first) by Daniel Clowes, 10 cd's and 2 dvd's.  Being so close to Christmas and all, I thought I would look out for myself by getting things for me and only for me.  To quote DJS's buddy: "I rock."

It's just very weird to read about the work environment, and to know the people they are talking about, and to have seen the behavior firsthand. I never thought of it as sexual harassment (if anyone even swore around me, they always apologized) but I guess this woman was deeper in the trenches with the sales force than I was.

      As some of you know, my girlfriend Laura loves N'Sync and more specifically, Justin Timberlake.  I know, I know...  Actually, it's kind of cute, but I digress.  I, for one, can't stand him.  I hate his little afro, the way he suddenly talks 'street' when he's around African-American folks, and his cocky, look-how-much-trim-I-can-get attitude.  I've been forced to listen to choice cuts off of his latest album 'Justified' and they all center around how people only like him because he's got money, how Britney Spears broke his heart, and girls.  That's it.  So, I'm pleased to announce that, along with my first song I've written 'Delicious Chips', I'm planning on penning a song that takes a shot at all the N'Sync's, Justins, and Backstreet Boys of the nation.  It's tenatively called "Let Me Love You Girl (Uhhhhzzzzsh)" and I should have some lyrics ready next week.  I'm just doing my part.  Stoner - Weapon of Choice?  Who is that?  Fatboy Slim?  DJS, out.

      I need to get back in the writing swing of things.  Word around the workplace here has it that there's a certain fellow on another team that can draw the pants off of anyone on the floor.  The supervisor for said artiste brought his sketchbook by and my jaw literally hit the floor.  This guy has mad, mad, mad talent.  Imagine the coolest looking little children's picture book you've ever seen and add 10 on top of that.  That's how good he is.  Since my novel has stalled since my move and the release of  'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City' , I haven't had the urge to finish my newest book.  It's currently stuck on page 110, where my kid hero is stuck in a swamp and is being attacked by spawning bog beasts.  Don't ask.    I looked at this guy's journal with total admiration and I decided that we needed to collaborate, that's all there was to it.  He claims he can't write very well.  I can't draw to save mine or anyone else's life.  Wonder Twin powers...ACTIVATE!  I sent him this e-mail and told him we needed to work on a project together.  He accepted!  Expect to see my first children's picture book in your local bookstore sometime next year.  (I can't give the title here in case there are some crooks reading.)  Anyway, I'm excited.

On a side note, I'm writing from a cafe, and the pandyland site is considered a "restricted site", so I can't go to it.  I had no idea I was participating in such a controversial venue.  Thank goodness "blogger.com" is kosher.  Finally, if anyone would like some slow-cooked food, I've got a year's supply on hand, and I'm happy to share the health.

      I am officially delirious.   Since my last post, I have:  1. Come down with a really bad cold, which means I am taking lots of medicine. 2. Gone on a job interview, which gives me hope that I will not be doing what I am doing now forever. 3. Gone on two dates with a very nice young man, and discovered that Figlio and Subway are equally romantic. 4. Gotten a call out of the blue from the Minnesota Children's Museum, a place I have been trying to get a job at since I graduated from college.  My head is swimming.

      I went to Milwaukee at the last minute on Saturday.  Saturday morning I looked on Ticketmaster.com and 2 more tickets had opened up for the sold-out opera "Carmen", put on by the Florentine Opera Company at the Milwaukee Performing Arts Center (not to be confused with Art's Performing Center, a Milwaukee strip club...Pandyland Bratwurst Jamboree starting point perhaps?...).  So I met my mom in the Beer Capital of the World for a cultural experience.  To make a long story short: my little brother played a  matador  in Carmen.  Somehow, my twerpy bro knows people in high places and got cast in this professional opera.  Can you imagine our fits of laughter when he appeared on stage with a matador's cape, black wig with a pony tail in the back, matador's hat, full make-up, and  pink  tights?  I thought I was going to lose it.  The people around us did not find it nearly as funny as we did.  Seeing him up there, trying to act serious, surrounded by world renowned opera singers was pure, unadulterated, comedy.  So that was definitely the high point of my weekend.

      GossiP  All women in Tampa wear thong underwear.  Women entering Tampa in regular underwear find their garments, however grandma-tized, become thongs.  This is not entirely a good thing.  DJS is coo coo for cocoa puffs.  HAL wears lifts.  Panda's funky glasses are equipped with x-ray technology.  Never bet against a pony that Stoner has picked to win (that's all I'm sayin').  I know a guy in Jersey who throws pennies out of his car window (at highway speeds) at cars that annoy him.  He keeps a mini baseball bat in his car in case there is trouble.  Duf stares at women's butts.  Weekends are made for Michelob.  I'm out!

      Speaking of freakish neighbors...I have a few of my own.  In the last 6 months, my apartment management company opened up our building to dog-owners.  Now don't get me wrong - I'm completely pro dog.  But when you put a massive dog like a rottweiler in a studio apartment, terrible things are bound to happen...things that make me want to strangle the mutts.  Take for instance the Spanish-speaking woman (I will call her Lola)  two  doors down from me.  I no longer need an alarm clock.  Lola leaves at 7:30 sharp every morning.  That happens to be the time I get up for work.  That also happens to be the time the dog becomes possessed by the devil.  I have no desire to find out if its bark is worse than its bite.  I'm convinced the dog has been trained to kill...he  screams  when Lola leaves.  I've already left one complaint to our management company and my neighbor right next to me (let's call her Bonnie) has left 4 complaints.  Last night Bonnie knocked on my door.  She said Lola has now complained about HER to our landlord...Lola's mad because she said Bonnie has been knocking on her door and harassing her (Of course Bonnie had just wanted to tell Lola to shut up her dog, and Lola never even answered the door.)  I told Bonnie I would be happy to vouch for her that Lola's dog is a complete menace.  Bonnie then informed me she's in law school and "[Lola] has made the wrong person mad."  Whatever.  Then there are these 2 dudes (I call them dudes because to call them "men" would be laughable) across the hall from me.  They both look like Jay of Silent Bob & Jay fame and they listen to old Pearl Jam albums all day long.  (How do these people afford rent?)  Seems rather appropriate since they are living in the apartment that Bill, the former resident and local drug dealer, lived.  (Refer to Pandyland archives.)  They have a huge dog as well - I'd call it a mix between a boxer and a rottweiler.  Mean, mean, mean.  He sniffed my butt the other day.  Now I'm getting sexually harassed by a dog.  Great.  Just another reason I can't wait to find a job and get the heck out of Chi-town.  Maybe I could do what this one guy on Michigan Ave was doing the other day.  He was all dressed up in a snow suit, and looked relatively normal.  Except for the fact he was carrying skis, wearing ski boots, and holding a "Keystone, Colorado or BUST!" sign and a bucket to gather donations.  Wow, he must  really  like to ski.

(possibly invest in ear plugs for use between 9 & 10am) 5) To find a job where I get an ounce of respect. 6) To be nicer to my mom; she's only trying to help. 7) To see Coldplay in Phoenix.

      I don't hold people to drinks.  It would be unprofessional, and not in the spirit of drinks.  That said, the first sign of middle-age/lameness for LIFE is when you pass up booze to “tidy up”.  That’s all I’m saying.

      So far, today has been well-spent.    I played a U2 lyrics trivia game.  It was kinda lame (only 5 multiple-choice questions), but I liked my score – “5 out of 5 correct.  Your U2 trivia ranking is:  You sure your name isn’t Bono?”  That made me smile.  Today I remembered the new word I learned for “cool”.  My brother (younger, natch) refers to things as “sick”.  At first I thought he was saying “slick”, as in “that’s SLICK!”, but then I realized he was saying “that’s SICK”.  So then I thought that he was saying it wasn’t good.  But then I found out that he was saying it is good.  So “sick” = “cool”.  I guess.  He said he got it from a friend he met in Italy who was from Long Island.  So I thought it was an isolated thing.  But then I heard someone (unrelated) to my brother refer to something they thought was good as “sick”.  I think it was on TV, or something.  So that means it’s probably not an isolated thing.  Happy New Year, y’all!

      Yeah, maybe I should get my hands on that Handbook.  I could definitely benefit from strengthening my pimp hand.   Panda  -Give me a week or two, and I could trick you out.  No diggity.  (Wow...somehow that just didn't sound right.)   Stoner  - Crazy.   Duf  - If you wanna be an usher, the job is yours, pal.   Hal  - Don't hold me to the bevvy after work.  I'm going to try, but I know we've got to straighten Chez DJ before tonight.

       Call me crazy.   I just said no to the concrete people. I almost can't believe it myself - I thought I would do anything to escape my place of employment - but after being forced to give it lots and lots of thought, I realized that a good gig is a good gig.  I have lots of vacation. I have great benefits. I get really, really pissed off about things that don't really, really matter. I get to take long lunches and go exercise, which makes everything seem all better anyways.   I don't like four trade shows per year. I don't like no vacation for the first year of employment. I don't like "yeah, you'll work 40 hours per week. We don't expect you to work more. But would you work more? I mean, forget it. Don't worry about it. You only have to 40 hours per week. But you're not a clock-watcher, are you?"  I don't like change. I do like my coworkers. I'm staying put.  Call me crazy.

       I Leave Town for One Minute!; 2 best: Turkey Hunting is Not What I Thought    Let me get this straight -   Hal and Panda are going to Phoenix in Feb. Stoner is leaving banking for masonry. DJS is locking in. Panda got laid. Skip Gangs of New York.   Let me get this not so straight -  Hal ran into a gay (pronounced gey) ex who is not an ex. My old college roommate and his wife are having a baby (oops, wrong section) Skip Gangs of New York.   Back to getting things straight-  Here's my update (boring in comparison):  I survived hurricane Lequetta (Mother of Duffer) being in town (but just barely, friends, just barely). We went to see 42nd street at the Ordway, and it was pretty good (lots of tap dancing though).    Tomorrow (when I am in the office for a couple of hours - to slap Hal and call her names (it's jealousy, but I hide it well) - to shake DJS's hand and call him friend and beg to be an usher - to clean out my e-mail where I'm told I'm the biggest drain on our e-mail memory - God Techies lie!) I will share my two favorite sentences from holiday letters received Chez Duffer.  It's priceless - let's just say my old high school debate partner was cuckholded (can women be cuckholded, or is they just cheated on?), and I think two friends (married) got it  all the way on  while turkey hunting.  I miss you all so.  Truly I do.

      Uh, no.  Mr. Shovelpants shouldn't get that guide.  You can't have something like that falling into the wrong hands.  Since we're talking movies, I'll DISH on a couple I've seen recently:   Catch Me if You Can  - Entertaining.  This will probably turn out like all Hanks movies (yeah, I know, it's really Leo's show) for me - I see it in the theater, enjoy it, and then never see or really think of it again.  It was the same for me and "Road to Peredition", "Cast Away", "The Green Mile", "Saving Private Ryan"... you get the idea.  Though I should say that out of that list, "Road to Peredition" was the best.   Adaptation  - Entertaining.  Weird.  In case you're unaware, it's buy the same writer and same director as "Being John Malkovich", so it's not "Maid in Manhattan" (though wouldn't it be great if those two did the remake?).  There are a few things to discuss, but since I don't think any of the rest of you have seen it, I'll wait.  This I can say - there are moments in that movie that are so quitely hilarious that I just think, "wow".  They don't hammer the point home, which is so rare and so great to see.

      Thanks for the info about "Gangs"...I was sceptical about that one.  Lots of hype always scares me away.  Another thing about Jackass - To all the ladies in the audience: Johnny Knoxville can make me a human bowling ball any day of the week.  He is brutally hot.

      Panda, I'm in total compliance with you on both counts.  I thought  Jackass: The Movie  was sheer genius.  I don't remember laughing so hard in my life...well, in the last couple of years anyway.  I personally thought the end thing (after the credits) with them as old men was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of exessiveness.  Anyway.  As for Kevin Smith latest foray: I haven't seen it and I highly doubt I ever will.  I struggled through  Dogma  which was such an over-rated piece of crap, I kind of felt cheated.  Was I offended by it because I'm religious?  No, and for the record, I'm about as agnostic as they get.  I just thought the performances were awful (Linda Fiorentino was horrible) and that snootchie-bootchie shit is for the birds.  After seeing 'Shitma' in the theatres, I swore off seeing any more Jay & Silent Bob movies.  They pantsed me on Mallrats and I felt taken again with Dogma.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me. The funniest thing is, ol' Kevie Smith peaked at Clerks and that was the flick he did with the smallest budget.  Oh...if anyone is wondering how  Gangs Of New York  is, I can sum it up in a couple of words: Waste Of Time.  Easily one of the worst (and most boring) movies I've seen in a long time.   Catch Me If You Can  was pretty good, though.

       Funny movie, disappointing movie   Have any of you seen Jackass: the Movie?  It was really funny.  I kind of shocked myself how much I laughed.  Although it made me feel physically ill during some parts (Yellow Snow Cone anyone?), it was well worth it.  Check it out.  Silent Bob & Jay Strike Back...this one was a huge disappointment to me.  Other than the cameos being pretty amusing, it was a  little  too over-the-top.  But how could you ever repeat the genius of Clerks?

It reminds me of the time I was in Catholic grade school, was yelled at by the nuns because I had my shirt untucked, and then had to tuck it in in front of the whole class.  Except this time, I didn't almost pee my pants.  But I cried about as much...  I hate it here.

Coldplay is playing Phoenix in early February, and I like any excuse to leave Minnesota in January or February.  Heck, if Rick Astley was playing Nashville at the right time I'd probably go.  That's a  *probably* , Panda.  For you envious Coldplay fans, they are also coming to the Target Center in March.  So Coldplay is offering something for everyone.  They're great.

      Yeah, I was pretty anti-Woodbury (or any suburb for that matter) myself before I moved there.  Now...I'm not sure I'd want to live anywhere else.  It's quiet out there.  You can see stars in the sky at night.  Everything is close by and I don't mind the people as much as I thought I would.  Plus...there's a Borders REALLY close by.  How kick-ass is that?  Traffic aside, it's not a bad place to live.  Much cheaper than those dumpy apartments I used to inhabit.

      I would also like to say congrats DJS!  Although I don't know how I feel about you supporting Woodbury's economy in such a large way. I want it to shrivel up out there, so there's not so much traffic when I visit my mom & dad. Back when I was a kid, why, it was all open fields! But I suppose you live there now, so I should just shut my yapper and let you spend your money wherever you want...   For the record, to anyone who may have read Hal's post - I do not regift. I witnessed someone regifting (although, according to this un-named individual, it was something she liked so much she ran around town looking for the same thing this year to give to someone else - a likely story) an item they got from Hal. Of course, I couldn't keep it a secret. I had to tell her. Don't regift around me - I'll bust you.

      Congrats, DJS!!  Thanks for spilling the story, too... I know it's hard for you share the mushy stuff.  We appreciate the effort.  :)  I'll bet it was a pretty good Christmas for Laura, too!  I had a very nice holiday, even if it was sans any red boxes.  I got some good gear and I think people liked the stuff I got them, so there should be few returns.  Though, as Stoner knows, sometimes people sometimes re-gift.  :)  I was able to spend a lot of time with my family over the two days of Christmas, and it was a good time.  My fam is deeply eccentric, and it's nice to know where I get it from...

       Marry Chirstmas   Yep, yep...'tis true.  I'm gonna get myself married within the next year or so, hopefully.  Here's how it went down:  A couple o' weeks ago, Laura had a dream that she didn't want to tell me about.  Of course, I bullied her into telling me anyway, figuring it was going to involve Justin Timberlake in some way, shape or form.  It didn't.  Instead, she said that she dreamt that she got a little red box for Christmas.  Since we decided that we were going to get each other anything (since we just bought our townhouse and such together) I broke the news to her that a little red box wasn't really in the cards.  She knew that and explained that was why she felt dumb bringing it up.  Meanwhile, the tiny wheels in my head spun.  On Monday, she wasn't feeling well, but being the work-a-holic that she is, decided to go into work anyway.  We drove together and since it was slow and she didn't have much to do and felt considerably worse, we went home.  Both of us.  I dropped her off so she could fire herself right into bed and I decided to go out and do a bit o' Christmas shopping.  I went to the Maplewood Mall and spent a gift certificate CK2 had gotten for me only hours earlier (for those at home keeping score, I bought the Back to the Future Trilogy on DVD) and on my way home an idea hit me.  I needed to get Laura a card for X-mas.  What was near the Hallmark in Woodbury?  Yes, friends.  The Shane Co.  I went in, saw THE ONE RING, called it 'my precious' and I was on my merry, or marry way.  I planned to give it to her in Mankato at a big family function, so I needed to carry it with me, so's I could spring it on her.  In case you were wondering, yes...it was wrapped in red.  At my parents house, my brother bought his girlfriend some earrings wrapped in an IDENTICAL box.  For a second, I thought someone had found my package and set it on the counter.  I almost shit eggrolls.  Anyway, long story short, I decided to wait until we got home to propose.  I put the ring in an antique box next to the fireplace and hinted that Santa Claus might've come whilst we were in Mankato.  She thought I was a dork and went upstairs.  After much hinting and urging, I finally got her to go downstairs and look in her shittin' stocking.  I got her some dumb stuff like an N'Sync import album, Pretty In Pink on DVD, some of those Harry Potter jellybeans, etc.  She scolded me for getting her gifts when we decided not to.  As she went to hang her stocking back up, I got on my knee near my antique box and I said, "Oh...I think there's one more."  She said, "What're you doing?"   I handed her the red lil' package and she opened the sucker up.  I was kind of nervous, but I managed a 'Do you think you'd want to marry me?"  She said yes.  Best...Christmas...EVER.

      I may have mentioned that I wrote a song called  'Delicious Chips'  for my friend in Florida to do what he'd like with it.  Well...after a couple o' months waiting, it's finally done.  That's right: the song's done!!!  I'm an official songwriter now and I've got the CD with my songwriting opus on it.  There's also some of Big J's other songs on his album titled Snacktastic on there, including:  - Scurrvy Song Part 1 & 2 - I Like To Party - My Name Is Jared - Chrissypoo - Nothing's Going To Break My Stride (Cover)  I might be a little biased, but I think 'Delicious Chips' is the best song on the album.  The guy singing sounds like a poor-man's Sammy Hagar with a dash of Meatloaf thrown in.  If you have the means of stopping by sometime, I recommend it.  Good times.  Oh...lookit the time.  I'm Audi 5000 in just under 5 minutes.  Happy Holidays clowns.  If you're REALLY bored, why not submit a Holiday Haiku to Discount Haiku???

       Something to laugh about...   To get y'all in the Christmas spirit, Anchower's newest column:  urlLink Secret Santas are for Shit .  And if the title alone doesn't convince you to click on the link, here's a snippet from the column that will: "Last Friday, Smalley totally dressed me down for wishing someone a Merry Christmas. I told him I thought we were supposed to say that, and he was like, "You're supposed to say 'Happy Holidays.' It fosters an environment of religious inclusion." I got a news flash for you, Smalley: It don't make no difference if you tell them "Happy Ass Day." They're there to get a Christmas tree, not a holiday tree."  So true.

It looks like I'm leaving the world of financial services in order to become a masonry maven.  As Hal said, this is probably just geeky enough to be fun for me.  And the countdown* begins: 12 business days left.  (*unofficial, since I haven't accepted anything, and can't give notice til my boss comes back from her holiday vacay.)

      Everything old is new again...  Having attended pre-school through college in this town, you’d think I run into people I know all the time.  In some ways this is true, but not nearly as much as you’d expect.  The exception being that in the last two weeks I feel like I have run into everyone I’ve ever known ever.  I ran into the previously mentioned “Nick” (let’s all be thankful I’m not using Panda’s nickname for him) at Blockbuster a few weeks ago.  Of course, I heard him before I saw him.  Thankfully, I was able to duck out without him noticing me.  Now, before you judge me, I challenge any of you to engage with Nick by choice.  There.  So, a day or two after that near-miss I ran into a friend’s ex-bf at a bar.  What followed was a surprisingly uncomfortable conversation (who knew there were lingering feelings between him and myself?).  But I recovered.  Then on Saturday I got a call on my cell phone from a very gay man who claimed to be an ex-bf and wouldn’t identify himself.  This was really disturbing for a lot of reasons.  But then when he identified himself I was really happy – it was Sholl!  (before nasty rumors get started, let me clarify that he is not, in fact, an ex).  I had heard nothing of that cat for maybe 5 years and then he runs into a mutual friend’s husband, gets my number, and just like that we’re in touch again.  Finally, yesterday I get together with an old friend I’ve seen little of in the past few years and we played catch-up.  I don’t know if you can count him as a long-lost friend exactly, but I also saw the white-haired karaoke m.c. guy that hosts all karaoke in the western metro, this weekend.  I hadn’t seen him in long time, either.   Now I hear that Nick and Duda were spotted on the jumbo-tron.  Will wonders never cease?  Moral of the story?  I need to relocate.

       Another story:   I went to the Vikings game with Matt (a.k.a. my boyfriend) on Saturday. On the big Jumbotron TVs they show fans waving, etc. and guess who I saw?  Nick Reinbold and Matt Duda.   Duda in a charcoal grey turtleneck, and Nick in plaid.  Some things never change.

      I just got the best xmas gift from my coworker!  As many of you know, I read  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius  and loved it. I mean  loved  it. I had an emotional relationship with that book, and breaking up was hard to do.   My coworker Audrey knew this, and for Christmas she got me Dave Eggers' new book,  You Shall Know Our Velocity . Apparently there were only about 10,000 copies printed. She ordered it for me in October and even got it signed when he was in town.   I'm so excited!!!

      Hal, I would think a serious sipper like yourself would want your latte to stay as hot as possible for as long as possible.   Room temperature coffee is just gross. Hot rocks. In regards to your questions:  1. You can feel the heat right through the java jacket. It's warmer. Try it.  2. I've never ordered an extra-hot latte and been disappointed. They're always plenty hot.  3. In the depths of winter, I prefer extra hot bevys. In summer, I go for standard temps.  4. & 5. When it comes to bevys, I don't concern myself with actual temperature numbers. That's more for weather and fevers than for coffee.  I predict that Hal will crumble and order an extra-hot latte sometime this winter, just to see what the hype is about.   Then she will be one of us.

      Okay, so I've now located a resource to help me with the coffee-temp related questions I have!  First off, how do you tell between a 150-degree latte and an 160-degree latte?  Also, do you turn around and tell them to heat it up if it's unsatisfactory?  Or do you just let it go?  How do you arrive at said bevy temperature preference?  Do you find something too cool and put a thermometer in it for future reference?  Do you burn your tongue and figure that's 5 degrees too hot?  So many questions...

      Disturbing new trend noted while getting my coffee this a.m. -   People who specify the temperature of their coffee as part of their drink order.  I first noticed this practice while in California a few months ago.  I thought it was a "west coast thing" but apparently it's catching on.  Someone explain this to me.

       BEST FILMS OF 2002   1.  Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers  - Okay, so I've already gushed about it, but it's quite simply one of the best movies ever.  I haven't been this excited for a movie series since I was a lil' shaver waiting for part 2 of Star Wars.  Yep.  It's that big to me, and this is coming from the dork who still has all of his Star Wars guys and a talking Yoda on his desk.  Was it really 3 hours?  Wow...I could've stuck around for 2 more hours...no problem.  2.  Signs  - Yeah, ol' Night M. Shamalamadingdong let me down a bit with his previous effort 'Unbreakable' but I was willing to give the cat another try.  Glad I did, because Signs ended up being one of the most intense movies I've seen in some time.  Yeah, the guy thinks he's the next Hitchcock and ends up using his 'but-wait-until-you-see-the-end-and-how-it-all-ties-together' gimmick, but friends...it works.  One of the most fun films I've seen in some time.  3.  Road to Perdition  - I'm a sucker for a good Sam Mendes flick...what can I say?  The guys got chops, baby.  From 'American Beauty' to this dark little number.  I'm sold, suckerhead.  Here's my legal tender.  Nothing quite like seeing Tommy Hanks in a bad guy role and seeing a crazy-as-all-getout ugly Jude Law working his silver screen magic.  If you haven't seen it...do it.  4.  The Good Girl  - I didn't want to see this, but I somehow got roped into it.  Damn...I'm glad I did.  As you may or may not know, I don't waste my 'precious' (the quotes are for you, HAL) time on TV, so I really never cared for any of the 'Friends' gang, but I'll be dashed if Jenny Aniston isn't a top-drawer actress.  Not the chick-flick I expected at all.  There were several moments when I just couldn't believe what was happening.  The movie wasn't designed to make you comfortable, but I think that's why I dug it so much.  5.  Bowling for Columbine  - I don't think I need to stress how much this movie has changed me.  What started as a huge mistrust of fear-generating news programs has turned to all out hatred.  I will never watch the news the same way again and I think ol' Chuck Heston and Rich Clark are a couple of the biggest celebrity assholes I've ever come across.  While I don't necessarily agree with everything Mikey Moore comes up with, I have a huge amount of respect for him.  If he released one of these types of flicks every year, I'd be in line to slap down some green.  I went and saw this with my dad...he's an instant Moore-fan.

       For the Record; Stop the Presses; Yes, I Really Was   Panda - FYI, I never betrayed you (and I'm pretty sure the cock has crowed three times), so you can throw all these Judases out and we can run our blog as we see fit!  :)  Extra! Extra! Extra!  Read all about it - Stoner has a boyfriend!  All we need now are details.  So, let have them!  Nice try with the movie review diversion though.  I really was propositioned by a pro at Rainbow on Monday.  I was there to get bananas (Dr. Freud, where are you?), and this woman came up to me, her eyes red like the rose of a thorn bush, like all the colors of a royal flush, and she asks me if I would like to go on a date.  I was tired, so I did not attempt a witty reply.  I just said "okay."  I mean "no."  I said "no."

       Two Towers Y'all...   I've gotta second Stoner's glowing review of T3.  It was easily THE movie I was overly excited to see this year and it did not disappoint in the least.  I hadn't read the books before about a year and a half ago, but I made a point to read them at least a month before each of the movies came out.  I've still got to read Return of the King, but sweet Jesus, the sheer scope of these movies is unbelievable.  My mom bought me the big ol' DVD box set of Fellowship of the Rings a month or so back and when I brought it home Laura looked at it and said, "Hmmm...doesn't seem like anything I'd be interested in seeing.  I then told her she might want to clear out of the living room for a good 3.5 hours.  After it started playing, I could see the movie's effect work like a tractor beam on her.  In no time, she was completely engrossed.  Anyway...long story short: DJ Likey.  He likey a lot.  It's quite possible that this is going down as the best movie I've seen in years.  I'm seeing it again next week.   "My precious....we likes it!!!"

       Stoner's First Movie Review  by Stoner  Last night I attended the second installment in the Lord of the Rings series. Never in a million years did I think I would be saying this - but that movie rocked.  For the past week or so, my boyfriend (as he is officially titled) and I have been watching The Fellowship of the Ring. He's a big fan and read all of the books, so he explained every little detail of the story. When I would fall asleep,  he would stop it - or let me sleep through the "epic battle scenes" and wake me up for the important stuff.   That helped. Because I knew the basic story and all of the characters, I had a much easier time following this one. I heard it would be darker and more violent, but the story was so good that I didn't care. The characters that started out together in the first movie are now on a few separate quests, and each storyline is riveting.   Yes, Pandyland friends, I just used the word riveting.  Anyways, my point is it's good stuff. You'll be hearing a lot about a CGI actor named Gollum. And let me tell you, he really is amazing. I can't believe he wasn't real. He was definitely a scene-stealer.

      Alright jerks.  I don't post for a few days and I get treated like a red-headed step child?  Do I have to start my own blog again?  I'm now in Chicago through Christmas.  It's soooo good to be home.  Although I had a kickin' weekend with my girls over last weekend.  We caught a show on Broadway on Saturday and a cheapskate frat boy on Friday.  That's right...the same one I talked about a few weeks ago.  Believe me, it wasn't my idea...it's my friend who's a glutton for punishment.  Don't even get me started about the cheap-ass moves this clown pulled. (i.e., ordering 2 bottles of the most expensive wine in the restaurant, only to make us pay for it when the bill came.)   So Billygoat was robbed in Guatemala today.  To directly quote his e-mail to me: "A German guy and I got robbed today as we walked the shores of lake Atitlan. There were 3 14 year old kids with machetes. Unfortunately I lost my camera and a completed roll of film. The police came minutes later and tried to catch the thieves but the kids were faster.  I didn't lose much else or get hurt so don't worry. I am safely in Panajachel now. My passport was safe in the secret pocket."  And to think I was going to travel with him for 6 months?  Blatant evidence that everything happens for a reason.

       Thirty Something Moment; Mostly Dead All Day   I cannot believe that I forgot to mention one album in my top five.  I blame DJS for not making it a top six list.  Anyway, I want to change my rankings so that I have a new number 4.  N*E*R*D moves to 5 and Jack moves to 6.  My new number four is:   Wilco  -  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  - If I could have a dream rock and roll band, if I could design a band to be any way I wanted it to be, I would not be the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin or even U2, I would be Wilco.  They are American rock and roll at its purest.  YHF is a brilliant addition to their discography.  Last, let me acknowledge that the Strokes disc may have come out in 2001, but it is a 2002 to me.  If you don't like it, then F ya'.  Also, Stoner, are you dead?  Just curious.

       5; Disappointed; Low Post   My top five for the year (I spent all weekend thinking about it):  5.   Jack Johnson  -  Brushfire Fairytales  -  soulful, mellow, deceptively complex, funky, memorable, all around excellent with only one or two songs that are only slightly above-average instead of awesome.  4.   N*E*R*D*  -   In Search of ...- "one day (one day) when I get older (oh-old-uh).  I'll start a family, get a job and go be a voter (vo-oh-tuh)."  Need I say more?  Warning:  for dirty dogs only.  3.   The Strokes  -  Is This It  - Pure rock and roll, I KNOW I will be listening to this years from now, and hey, it's not their fault they are the next big thing.  2.   Red Hot Chili Peppers  -  By the Way  - flawless, complex, funk/R&B, bold, experimental, confident, risk taking, mellow, intense, well-produced, all the things you would expect from musicians who have been around as long as some of the Peppers have been around.  A long disc that never grows tedious and in another time(...say pre-corporate radio) would have spawned at least 6 radio hits (maybe 7).  1.   Coldplay  -  A Rush of Blood to the Head  - Not one flaw.  Not one.  "God put a smile upon my face" by making music like this possible.  Flawless.  Sublime.  Everything:  religion, sex, ecstasy, heartache, redemption and good sangin'.  Best single of the year:   Tear  by  Red Hot Chili Peppers .  Worth the price of the disc.  You will all think I am a mellow nerd when you hear it (it has a horn section interlude), but it has all the climatic charm of a slow building "o" and all the lingering power of being left high and dry, if you could somehow be thankful for the experience and want to do it over and over again; I played this at work about 25 times in a row one day.  It's addictive like heroine (or so I'm told...but I digress).  Biggest disappointment of the year:   Elvis Costello's  -  When I Was Cruel  - as a fan, perhaps I expected too much; but with the exception of a couple of tracks, it is completely forgettable and average.  I missed my Pandyland brothers and sisters last week.  Sorry for the low post.

      I like to shake my boo-tay.   Therefore, my five fave artists of 2002 were:    P. Diddy.  I can’t believe J Lo hasn’t responded at all to his pleas.   Busta Rhymes.  Pass me some Courvoisier.   Usher.  I don’t think he’s got it bad – I think he’s got it good.   J. Timberlake.  He just wants to love me, baby.  (Tie)  Jay Z and Ja Rule.  I can’t ever figure out which is which, so I’ll go with both.   And the top  album of the year , courtesy of Duf, is by Dirty Vegas. I have no idea what it’s called. But it’s good.

      I think I'm with Heather...haven't had much time or money lately to keep up with the trends...but for me:   Beck  - Sea Change Beck is extremely bummed out.  I think certain albums hit you because of the timing in when you listen to them.  Beck was talking about breaking up, I was breaking up...it just made sense.  On the whole, this is a pretty sophisticated album for him.  I never thought he'd ever break away from the "I'm a Loser" genre...this album proves he has.  If you like a softer edge, more intelligent lyrics, more melodic vs. noise, you'll like it. Very well crafted.    Elvis #1 Hits  On the other end of the spectrum...if "Little Less Conversation" doesn't make you want to dance around, then you must be in a coma.  Good ol' rock n' roll mixed with some sappy ballads.  The best single disc Elvis primer to date.   Doves  - The Last Broadcast The perfect album for all you Jeff Buckley, Coldplay, Radiohead, or Wilco fans out there.  This album is lush, melodic, poignant and cohesive. This was my first introduction to the Doves - having listened to this British album for the first time a few weeks ago in London, I immediately downloaded as much of their stuff as I could find after I got home.

      DJS is way more on the cutting edge than I.  I usually come around late to new stuff.  Rather than give you my top 5 albums of 2000/2001, I’ll give you a few thoughts on 2002 music:  #1 – Coldplay   A Rush Of Blood To The Head  .  HANDS DOWN.  I love those guys.  I also liked what I heard of John Mayer.  And Norah Jones has a great voice and a good album.  The most disappointing music release of the year was Beth Orton’s   Daybreaker  .  I wore out her 1st 2 albums and even her EP.  I was really, really looking forward to her latest effort, but it’s just okay.  She better improve by next time, or she will have officially let me down.

      Since we're coming up on the end of the year, why don't we start a series of BEST of 2002 lists?  We can do one a week until the end o' the year.  This week:  BEST 5 CDs of 2002  in no particular order.  1.  N.E.R.D  -  In Search Of...  These guys are all over the map.  One part R&B dance-y music, another part lyric mischief.  Not only are their songs catchy, very well produced and delicious, but they're pretty damn funny.  It's refreshing to listen to music that doesn't take itself so seriously.   Relax girl...sip some of my slurpee...   2.  Lo Fidelity All Stars  -  Don't Be Afraid Of Love  Yeah they're sort of a house/dance/techno band...but they're so much more.  After the loss of their lead singer (yes, they sing, too) the future looked bleak for the Lo-Fis.  No worries, mate.  Their newest effort is solid.  Rock solid.  If you're going on a road trip and you need a kick-ass soundtrack to drive to, scoop this one up.  3.  The White Stripes  -  White Blood Cells   So I've already sung their praises and I've only owned the CD a day and a couple hours.  If I've already listened to it like 8 times, does that tell you something?  I like their whole gimmick, too...pretending they're brother and sister when they're really ex-spouses.  Am I icky if I say I think Meg White is kind of cute in a gothy, creepy girl way?  Methinks no.  4.  EELS  -  Souljacker  Okay, so I learned about these guys backwards, buying their newest CD and working my way back.  Shit...I even bought a burrito for HAL in exchange for their debut album.  Well worth every inch of tortilla.  Their newest (and consequently my oldest) effort is a kick in the mouth of crazy-ass beats, sound lyrics and mouth-watering rhythm.  C'mon...in the first song entitled 'Dog Faced Boy' the chorus is...  Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me...  Pure bearded genius.  5.  Emiliana Torrini  -  Love In The Name Of Science  Well...technically this CD came out in 1999, but I got it late last year and...well, I still can't get enough of it.  She's from Iceland (big bonus!) and I saw her open up for Dido at the Xcel Energy Center.  Considering she didn't have much in the way of a set-up for playing such a huge venue, I was totally blow away by her.  One part Bjork and one part Dido is the best way to descibe it and that still doesn't give her justice.  Anyway...not an easy album to find, I had to bribe the woman at Tower Records in Philidelphia to sell me her copy...but well worth the effort.

        From the 'Yeah...We Already Know' Department...    I just snapped up the CD from  The White Stripes  yesterday.  The verdict?  This DJ likey.  He likey a lot.  I had it in my hand at Target and as I perused the aisles of quality products at reasonable prices, I hemmed and hawwed about getting it.  I knew like 2 songs on the CD and since I was late to jump on the band wagon, it was priced to own at $14.99 (which I think is a bit steep).  On my way back toward the video games, I decided to put it back.  When I did, I set it on another shelf for a clerk to put reshelve later.  Little did I know, but I managed to put it near some other CD offerings...one of which was, you guessed it:  The White Stripes.  Only this one was different.  For a mere $13.99 (that's $1 in savings) not only did you get the CD, but you also got a DVD with 4 (count 'em 4) videos and 2 unreleased songs on it.  Sold.  I can't stress how cool these cats are.  Loud, sloppy rock with the just the right amount of lyrical wit and genius.  If you love Justin Timberlake and glossily produced stuff, you'll HATE this.  It's a contender for best CD of the year in my book... which gives me an idea!

We all got stuffed, and are experiencing terrible sugar crashes right now. I could drink an entire ocean of Diet Coke and still fall asleep.  I am going to die.

      A few thoughts on Mariah Carey and the Today show…  For those who may not know, Mariah Carey performed live from the Mall o’ America on the “Today” show this morning.  Al Roker (yum!) and Matt Lauer (sure…) also were at the event.  Sadly, Ann and Katie stayed in New York.  I watched a bit of the show, though I missed the live performance (sniff, sniff).  It was the pope coming to bless the cathedral.  People were kissing Mariah’s ass - you would have thought that Bono himself was there!!  It’s always a weird thing to see her interact with her fans – I’ve never seen someone more condescending, so much so that it’s painful to watch.  When Matt asked her why she was there to perform she said very sincerely that it was “to be with the people”.  Ew...  Anyway, it’s also what people around town (alright, in the elevator and the break room) are talking about.  It’s funny that everyone says the EXACT SAME thing – “I would have gone to see Matt and Al, but Mariah’s not my thing”.  And then I think about a rotunda of people chanting “MATT. AND. AL!!, MATT. AND. AL!!” and then they take the stage, and everyone goes nuts…

      HAL, I suppose you could say it was a cry for help - a cry to plan another Pandyland Jamboree maybe.  I need my Pandyland buds to keep me on the straight-and-narrow!  I think jigging in public is definitely more acceptable than dry-heaving in front of one's parents, doncha think?

      DJS, glad to hear you saw Frida!  HAL heard this story first-hand, but just to give y'all a quick recap:  I went out with the girls on Saturday night...the same time my parents were staying at my place because they went to see an opera on Saturday in Chicago.    I drank way too many margaritas, as well as some sort of red shot, lots of Newcastle, and zambooka.  Damn zambooka.  The night involved the above drinks, a sweet jukebox, an extremely friendly Irishman, a guy who looked like one of the singers in the Barenaked Ladies, and a computer programmer with a girlfriend (the one guy  I  decide to talk to all night, btw.  And, I don't remember his name.)  To make a long story short...I stumbled into my studio apartment at 1am, went into the bathroom, and puked.  And to remind you, my parents were sleeping over...so they heard and saw everything.  My mom played the sympathy ticket: "Oh honey, I feel so sorry for you..."  While my dad was a smart ass as usual: "Too much medicine, huh?  *laughs under breath*"  I mumbled something and got into bed...the next day, as death warmed over me, mom and dad got me up at 7am to go to mass.  Oh my Lord.  I've never felt more like ass...ever.  The one time I go out hard core in about  two years  and my parents spend the night.  Good grief.

      What up Pandyland?  A couple of you cats know I write and of those that know, a couple also know that I sent my story to two kids to read and send me back a review.  Let me explain...I've been involved with some online Children's Book Author groups (that haven't been much help) and I always get e-mails and stuff from other groups who'd like me to join their groups.  Well...I got an e-mail from a guy a couple weeks back that told me about a service he and his kids were providing.  For the low price of $7 each, I can have his kids (a 2nd grader & a 3rd grader) read my 320 page manuscript and do a pretty thorough critique of it.  At first I was skeptical, but then I thought: 'Ehh...what the hell.'  I sent it off and thought I'd hear back from them in a week or two.  Nope.  Review #1 came in today.   BTW  - I saw 'Frida' on Saturday.  Loved it!  Who knew lil' Selma had it in her?

      I have another work gripe that I need to express - font usage.   What's with the people who write corporate memos in Comic Sans? No matter what the message says, I read "please don't take anything written in this memo seriously. If I had crayons, I would be using them right now. Because that is cute. And so am I."  It's like I'm working with Charlie Brown.

      OK...now that DJS has offered up the Bono/Bjork page, HAL has to put him back on the Bagel List.  (Whatever that is.)  Alright, children.  Don't make me pull over again...or next time, it's the belt!  I'm going to the Lyric Opera tonight.  It's supposed to be a long one - about 4 hours.  Nothing like paying for a song-filled nap. Tomorrow night it's girls-night-out con killer margaritas at Caesar's on Clark.  Single Women and Sweet Frozen Drinks: a deadly combination!

      Okay...I gotta come clean.  It's sweeps week in Bloggerville and I thought I'd stoke the fires a bit to get better ratings here on Pandyland.  Yes, I'm a ratings whore.  As you know from my visits to  other  sites I enjoy the occasional nudge and believe me, I knew I'd get some backlash for my remarks on Bono's profound statements in Iowa.  I like the gadge (not everything he says) and I really do like U2.  Duf couldn't have nailed it more precisely with his insightful summary of both Bjork and Bono.  I never intended to drag Bjork into this, but alas...all is fair in love and etc...  Can't we all just get along?   (djs hears the crowd murmur: yeah...if you wouldn't ever post anymore, we could...)

       Pandymonium in Pandyland?   Okay now wait a minute.  As a U2 fan and a Bjork fan (even a Sugarcubes fan), I have to come in and stop this insanity.   Bono is an artist.  For that matter, in my opinion, anyone who creates anything is an artist.  If you make shitty clay ashtrays, you are an artist.  Let's recognize him as such.  But more than that, in my opinion (and I recognize these things are subjective), he is an  exceptional  artist.  To me, his contribution is more in poetry than in quality of voice.  Though he may not have Bjork's multi-insturment gifts, you have to give him credit for a wide variety of lyrics that put him in a category that most artists can only dream of.  He has been anthemic, soulful, silly, subtle, profane, and his portrayals of America (and I hope this does not overstate it) remind me, for their realism and love, of Nabakov's  Lolita .  His lyrics touch on religion, politics, love, history, struggle, pop culture, man, everything.  And think of all the banal lyrics there are today.  Think of how hard it is to be inventive and to go outside of yourself.  Think how hard it is to create before millions for twenty years, knowing that some people love you and never want you to change, but that change is required if you are going to be on the scene for that long.    Also, we really must not fault him for his political actions.  It is, IMHO, always wrong to chide people for trying to make the world better.  He is high profile, and everything he does will get attention, so all of his actions will seem self-serving to an extent, but considered against the alternative - doing nothing - I hope he continues to speak out even though it means he will be criticized.  Now for Bjork.  She is an artist of the highest order.  Her musicianship is genius.  Her lyrics are sublime, and the combination is breathtaking.  What she wears, why she hits people, her strange videos, they are all a function of her genius.  And I would totally date her anytime ever.  Wifey has already given me permission.    I guess what I am saying is that these things are usually subjective, but should never be an "either or proposition."  Also, there should never be a compeition.  Who is the better artist is always a silly question.  However, who would you rather sleep with is not.  And for me, it is Bjork (it's close, but Bjork edges out Bono because I've seen her nude and she is easier to visualize).

      DJS,  I'd love to share set lists with you (seriously, I would).  But to keep it brief, yes, they did play "old stuff" on the Popmart and Zoo TV/Zooropa tours.  "I Will Follow" was played on both tours (from their original album) as was "the hits" from "War", "The Unforgettable Fire", and "The Joshua Tree".  I think you're thinking of the drastic overall difference between their concerts of the '80s and their concerts of the '90s.  Popmart/Zoo TV, etc were flashy, multi-media spectacles (and great f--king shows) that were a big contrast from the simple "4 guys on stage" concerts that they did in the '80s.  Plus, they were playing stadiums vs. theaters.  Lots of people balked, and U2 was like "deal with it".  But they always had a diverse set list.  Anyway... just go to a show when they are in town again.  You'll thank me for it.  Though I'm not sure if Larry will take of his shirt again.  That was just special.

       HAL:  Did you see U2 perform during their Popmart/Zooropa days?  They may have rescinded their statement since then, but I'm quite sure they boycotted performing their earlier efforts (read: their hits) for a period a while back.

      Wow, I've never seen such long posts since....oops, again...wrong site.  And to think  Stoner  somewhat "caused" this bit of controversy with her subtle rip on the Icelandic imp.  I love it!  For the record, I like Bono  and  Bjork.  But I do have to say I enjoy Bono as part of the band more than a spokesperson by himself...if only he was on this Midwestern AIDS round-up with the Edge (instead of Chris Tucker, that guy totally bugs)...then I actually might take him seriously.  By the way, I'm planning my next big international trip next year...to Iceland.  I can't think of anything cooler than Bjork's hot-spring-filled homeland...it's somewhere I've always wanted to go.  Anyone want to tag along?

      I can't disagree with what people are saying here.  I just have to take small exception with the  claim  that Bono said he won't play old stuff - there's been stuff from "Boy" or "October" (circa '80-'81), at almost all the shows I've been to, and they ALWAYS play stuff from "War" (1983) and every subsequent albumn at every show.  And I certainly don't disagree that Bono is "a guy with a microphone and an agenda", after all, I love that about him.  Same goes with the charge of cheesy-ness.  He's guilty - guilty of being earnest!  Em I buggin' ya?...  I also agree that Bjork was being subversive and rebellious at the Oscars.  No one in their right mind actually thought she put that on thinking "this will fit in with any Vera Wang out there".  But it was a bizarre and flaky thing to do.  I also loved it when the “South Park” guys arrived at the Oscars dressed in J-Lo and Gwyneth dresses.  It was weird and obnoxious.  But I laughed really hard, and it’s the only thing I remember anyone wearing from that year, plus, we're still talking about it, so it was genius.  Bottom line, U2 fans have to live with the fact that Bono can be perceived as pompous, and Bjork is a freak.  But they don’t have to accept those as bad things.   I just hope this doesn't all come down to someone getting booted.  Er, wrong site...

      Okay...now the gloves are coming off.   Bono:  an egomaniac who seems to be pulling out all stops to get himself a Nobel Peace Prize and also the a-hole at one time who said something to the effect of: "F the fans...we're not playing our old stuff anymore" all the while trying to cram Pop Mart and Zoo TV garbage down people's throat.   Bjork:  a musical genius.  Is her stuff as catchy as U2's?  No, nor does it need to be.  With every song she's ever recorded, she comes up with a completely distinct and different sound than her previous efforts.  As for the easy cheap shot EVERYONE makes about the swan dress, here's what I have to say: How dare she wear anything other than Prada or a Bob Mackie dress?  This was the   OSCARS   we're talking about!  Ugh!  On a red carpet full of people spinning around to show off their $50,000 dollar dresses that designers gave to them to wear, Bjork showed up in a dress her friend made and was pretty funny about it.  Of course, she didn't expect the backlash she got from the press and every other automoton that watched the awards.  Her response to it all?  She wore it again (how dare she!) on the cover of her album 'Vespertine.'  Tre cool in my book.  Okay...I can see this escalating in an all-out Pandyland brawl.  For the record, I like some of U2's music and I actually think Bono is okay.  I merely pointed out what I thought was a very corny little statement on his part.  I appreciate what he's trying to do, but he needs to stop acting like he's Jesus Christ with his prophetic words of wisdom.  All in all, it's hard to call Bono an artist.  He's a guy with a microphone and an agenda.

      I'm sorry I missed out on this argument yesterday, but I really feel I must contribute my unbiased opinion to the Bono vs. Bjork discussion.   Bono: a man with a smoldering, sexy voice, who despite his age makes leather pants look like the best idea ever.   Bjork: a woman with a voice that is alternately shrieky and raspy, who despite common sense once wore a stuffed swan dress.  So which "artist" is superior? Hmmm...it's such a tough call...

      Sorry, DJS... I don't get your "Bono can be corny" argument.  But are you surprised?  Bono could pinch my cheek and tell me I'm  "cute as a button", and I'd find it profound and intensely original.  And as long as you don't push the issue with Bono, I won't tell you that Bjork is flaky.

      Okay...I know some of you Pandy-ites love Bono, but this excerpt from an article (sent in by Moses Oatmeal) is just...plain...corny...   Award-winning musician Bono and actress Ashley Judd stopped in Iowa  City on Monday to plant a movement in some of the world's best soil.    Joined by an American AIDS expert, an HIV-infected African activist,  and a Ghanan musical group, the stars educated and attempted to inspire a  bubbling IMU crowd of more than 2,000 to fight the epidemic, which  kills 6,500 sub-Saharan Africans each day. Approximately 29 million  Africans are infected with the disease.    "I'm told you can grow anything here," said Bono, who shed his  trademark leather jacket and wrap-around shades for the event. "We're here to  grow a movement."   Man...how long did it take him to draft that catchy little phrase???  (to read the whole delicious article, check the Pandyland e-mail box)

       Bringing everyone down.    1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?   Yoda.  I’m not sure why he was such a prominent figure in my childhood social circle… probably had a lot to do with the fact that he talked/looked funny.  We used to spend a lot of time around the pond behind my parents house, and there was a place there that we called “Yoda’s Bathroom”.  I don’t know why we gave him a bathroom, and no one else.  I also don’t know why we didn’t give him things like a bedroom, or a kitchen.  But I’m sure it made sense at the time.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?   Grandparents.  They all died when I was pretty young.  I’m often told that I’m like my dad’s mother, which makes me happy and sad - she died before I was born.  The thing is, a relative inevitably tells me a story about when she was scamming or pawning something, or when she confronted some strange kid about being a “greedy little bastard”, or her habit of talking to paintings on the wall as if they were her (dead) sisters.  Then that person says, “You remind me a lot of her”.  I’ve got a lot to look forward to.  This reminds me, earlier this week I was watching a “morning program” and they were showing this piece about a little kid (about 4?) who’s favorite thing to do (aside from suction-cupping things to his stomach) is to take helium balloons to a nearby hillside and “send them to” his dead grandma.  She died when he was 2 years old, so he doesn’t even really remember her.  I just lost it.   3. What's the furthest from home you've been?  Literally… Prague?  Figuratively… probably when I slept over at a friend’s house and her dad came home drunk and a little belligerent, so we hid upstairs.  It was apparently something she was really used to and I was really not used to.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?   To keep the old trap shut.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?  Gearing up for a week away - I’m a “nester” so I like preparation.  That aside, social highlights include bowling/karoke Saturday and a church-shopping expedition on Sunday.

       And the dark horse...     1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?    I liked Spiderman.  I think the fact that he was a kid who got bitten by a spider was cool to me when I was a little.  My brother on the otherhand, liked the Hulk the best.  Maybe it was little brother syndrome...then again, he was also pretty fond of Wonder Woman too.  I never did get the Spiderman underoos, but got a nice olive drab set of Yoda ones.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?    A BB gun.  I had an uncle who got me this scarecrow dart gun set where you shot these rubber sucker-darts at this plastic scarecrow who exploded if you shot him in the chest.  It had other targets, too, but...you know.  We played with it for one day and it mysteriously disappeared, guns and all.  I always wanted to get a BB gun so I could go out and hunt stuff in the backyard.  Never got one...that is, until my brother bot me a BB handgun a couple years ago.  By then, I didn't want to hunt.  Figures.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   When I lived in Los Angeles for 9 months.  It was pretty hard for me and my family.  While I loved living there and working in the industry that I did, it was weird not having the people I was really close with nearby.  When my brother and his girlfriend visited, I felt bad.  I couldn't visit with him for very long and when he left I cried like a little bitch.  Like real hard sobs...or like the Scottish would say: I was greetin' like a bairn.    4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?    How to play a musical instrument.  I had a bass guitar years ago and played the damn thing once.  My 'band' and I recorded our first song, the instrumental 'Burning Down the Ghetto' and that was pretty much the end of it.  I did get an acoustic guitar over a year ago, but I haven't had a chance to learn to play it yet.  I did make some effort, however.  I bought a 'The Complete Idiots Guide to Playing the Guitar.'  How sad is it that I still don't know how to play the thing?    5. What are your plans for the weekend?    Going bowling with some friends and their little daughters and then eating.  Heading out to dirty ol' Mankato so I can look at the place where we're having the reception and also to check out some other potential photographers.  Of all the details I'm the most picky about, it's the picture-takers.  We saw one guy who just took them with a regular camera and get this: let's you keep the negatives.  No thanks, pally.  They looked like any retarded cousin could've taken the shots.  Let's just say I've been put in charge of who does our pictures.  Sunday I work at the bookstore and I plan to work on getting my stuff ready to submit to publishers/agents.

       I like Fridays.     1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?    Definitely Wonder Woman. I was so jealous of the next door neighbor with the Wonder Woman underoos. She got to wear a fancy tiara and bracelets and flashy clothes, and was tough and fought crime at the same time.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?    Makeup. For Christmas I always wanted makeup or hair accessories or stuff like that, but girliness wasn't completely encouraged in my family. I am just now coming out of my girly-repression funk. And spending a lot of money on nail polish.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   I spent Christmas with a bunch of Italian people one year, and was very homesick. Only one or two of the people spoke English - so even though the others were trying to be nice and talk to me, I couldn't understand what they were saying. Then my family called, and they were all together and sounding like they were having fun (and speaking in my own language). I was lonesome...in a crowd...very sad...    4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?    Spanish. I took it in high school, and wish I had continued in college. Instead, I wasted my time on things like Economics and Accounting. I wouldn't have been able to go on the London Business Semester with Panda though, if I hadn't minored in business...    5. What are your plans for the weekend?    Tomorrow I get to go to my boyfriend's holiday party for work. It goes from 5 pm to midnight, and there is a dance...I think I will be tired when it is done. On Sunday we'll go to my niece's 2nd birthday party. And on Monday we're playing hooky and doing fun stuff all day instead of working. I like him...  So, Duf, where does the Friday Five come from?

       Being Proactive with the Friday 5, yo.    1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?  Does Smurfette count as a superhero?  Because she rocks.  She lives in this village of  all men  and just flirts to get her way.  She’s the ultimate woman/blue creature.   2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?  Off hand, I can’t think of anything I wanted for myself.  (On the same wavelength as Duf…) My brother wanted a go-kart since the moment he could talk.  So sometimes I would ask my parents for a go-kart for Christmas/Birthdays since I thought I’d have more “seniority” or something because I was older.  That never worked.  We never got a go-kart.  When my cousin did we were green with envy…and that bitch never let us drive it.  That still makes me mad.   3. What's the furthest from home you've been?  Bangkok & Chaing Mai/Rai in Thailand – the most gorgeous place on earth.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?  I’ve always wanted to learn an Asian language, but I don’t know if I’d have the patience for it.  And I still need to learn to drive stick.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?   What’s with this question every week?  I’m going to see a punk show tonight at the Elbo Room, looking at a condo (possible purchase??) on Saturday, Comedy Sportz tomorrow night, movie on Sunday.  O-u-t...out!

       Friday Five, Y'all...Friday Five, Y'all...Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday Five, Y'all:     1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?   Aquaman.  He could talk to the animals, and he could swim like a darn dolphin.  He had a great looking butt.  He was the complete package.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?   Affection.  Just kidding.  I'd have to say go-cart, Bob.  A go cart or affection.  Yep.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   Where ever I go, I take Kansas with me.  I'm never away from home, y'all (there's no place like it...it's where the heart is...it's sweet home...it's on the range where the deer and the antelope play).    4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?   Empathy.  But idiots and their idiotic decisions make it so flippin' hard.  Look, morons, get a clue!  Everytime I try walking a mile in someone else's shoes, I just wonder why people don't drive more.  Friggin' morons!    5. What are your plans for the weekend?    [Okay, Friday Five is getting kind of lame and redundant.  We might have to make up our own if this shit keeps up:]  To mourn the absence of football with DJS, (you feelin' me, Shov'?), then to shovel, strategize, sing,  sleep , scramble and start sip-sip trainin' for Panda's visit (jig judge Gino, where you at?).  Why do you ask?

       A trashy saga...   To HAL's point #3 - in our apartment building, we have to bring garbage to the dumpsters in our garage. At least they started in our garage. Then they were moved outside. Many people complained (for the record, a lot are elderly, so I see where the problem could be) and now they have moved them back into the garage. I guess the fire department says they have to be in their own room, however, with a door that closes and latches.   Thus, our ingenious apartment management company built a dumpster-closet, with walls that go from the floor to the ceiling. It freaks the hell out of me. It's pitch dark in there - apparently one of the stipulations is that the room can have no light - and there is plenty of room for rapists and murderers to hide. It's perfectly convenient. After they kill you, they can dump your body right away.  And that is why I don't take out the trash.

       Moses was right, I need to do this -     1. What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  Is there anyone out there who has only one thing they don’t like about their body?  Alright, I’ll go with my midget-jaw.  It’s far too small (or the rest of my face is far too big), and because of that, I don’t like my face in profile, at all.    2. What are two things you love about your body?   I finally have an appreciation for my height (for the record, the last time I checked I am somewhere between 5’10’’ and 5’11’’).  I had a hard time with it in adolescence, but now I don’t mind it when people ask me to grab something off the high shelf at Target.  It’s also a major foundation of my faith, as when I was a youg’n I literally used to pray to God that I would not be 6’ tall or taller.  The exception is that I’m still not used to the really weird comments (among several odd experiences, I’ve had a stranger inform me that I’m lucky I’m so tall, because no man will lie to me, as he has to look me in the eye) that I get.  I’m also a fan of my feet, which explains my shoe and pedicure expense problems.   3. What are three things you want to change about your home?   I don’t like many of the people in our building, including, but not limited to:  the freaks across the hall, the loud bastards below us, and the weird, haggard, drifter-type guy who lives somewhere else in the building.  I miss having a garbage shoot like I did in my old building (much more convenient for refuse-removal), and finally, I miss having a garbage disposal (also a convenience in refuse removal).    4. What are four books you want to read this year?   I don’t plan that far in advance.  But I would like to finish the 6 or so books that I have partially-read.    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?  Wow, I’m not nearly that well thought-out.  Nor am I much of a goal-setter.  I have promised myself that I will never drink that much again, but then broken that promise.  I would like to travel to all 50 states in my lifetime (so far, about 30 are down).  It would also be neat to go to each continent (excepting Antarctica).  I’ve only done 2 of those.  I better get on that.

      HAL - I wasn't all that ga-ga over  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind .  It stank like usual Steven Soderbergh fare and I was just informed last night that part of the deal they made with the studios is that ol' Stevie got final edit rights on the film, so he could make it into his usual yawn-fest.  While I didn't HATE the movie, it didn't leave much of a lasting impression on me.  Plus, it had my least favorite actress in there: horse-faced Julia Roberts.  I wish George Clooney would cut his apron strings and do projects other than what Soderbergh gets him involved in...he's slowly starting to bug the shit out of me.  Now...if you want to see a great movie, one of the year's best (or was it last year?) go and see the movie  NARC  with Ray Liotta and Jason Patric.  Awesome movie.  Gritty, powerfully acted, loaded with some pretty startling imagery.  I just saw it last night and I'm still kind of buzzing from it.  Saw a preview for the movie The Core.  Now THAT movie is going to suck.  Sample dialogue:   "The earth is going to split in half.  There's no way we can stop it."  "What if we could?"

       The At Least It's Not Wednesday Yet Five:    1. What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  I wish I were a little more fit. I still think of myself as an athlete (because of high school and college) and thus being able to eat as much as I want whenever I want, but am pretty much a lazy bum these days.   2. What are two things you love about your body?   I have plenty of thick, healthy hair on my head - without having thick, unruly hair on my arms or face. Is that two?   3. What are three things you want to change about your home?   I wish it was free. I wish it would clean itself. I wish it was right next door to where Matt lives.    4. What are four books you want to read this year?    You Shall Know Our Velocity  by Dave Eggers, since I got it for Christmas and like the first four pages so far. Also, I'd like to finish reading the other books I purchased last year, such as  The Corrections . I'm looking forward to taking a day off to read the new Harry Potter book non-stop once it comes out. And maybe I should read that cheese book, because I'm unhappy at work.    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?   A long time ago, my swimming coach taught me that the only thing in life I truly  have to  do is die (followed up by a conversation about whether you  have to  go to the bathroom or not, or if it will kill you if you don't...but that's a story for another time) so I haven't made many promises to myself. I like the idea though, and intend to make five promises to myself right now.

        Tuesday Five: A little slow on the pick-up     1.  What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  The paleness of my skin…in winter I’m almost transparent.   2.  What are two things you love about your body?  That I can put my body through hell and back and it keeps on tickin’. My gorgeous toes.   3.  What are three things you want to change about your home?  I wish I had more room. I need more space. Did I mention I live in the smallest studio apartment on Lakeshore Dr??   4.  What are four books you want to read this year?  I don’t remember the last time I picked up the Bible.  Fast Food Nation  by Eric Schlosser To keep reading  Who Moved My Cheese  by Spencer Johnson when I start to feel out of control.  Why There Are No Good Men Left: The Romantic Plight of the New Single Woman  by Barbara Whitehead (Just kidding…)   5.  What are five promises you have kept to yourself?  Pay off my graduate student loan before I get married.  Thank God the wedding didn’t happen in November, because I just made the last payment last week. To remember my friends’ (and mother’s) birthdays. To stand by my convictions, no matter how unpopular: i.e., I’m probably the youngest (and only) Republican I know in Chicago.  To surround myself with music… and to keep playing the guitar since I can’t fit a piano in my tiny house. To eat whatever I like and not feel guilty about it.

      First off:  Edgeville Rocks.  Second of all, this is the toughest [Monday] Five ever.   1.  What is the one thing you don't like about your body?   Easy:  my weight.  So sad that the thing I don't like is a thing I can control.   2.  What are two things you love about your body?   I think I have beautiful feet. That golden hair that grows out of my forehead.   3.  What are three things you want to change about your home?   The address. The size. The lack of jacuzzi/hot tub.   4.  What are four books you want to read this year?   The Hours by Michael Cunningham Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer (guessing on spelling) The Brothers Karamazov Naked by David Sedaris   5.  What are five promises you have kept to yourself?   Listen to New Year's Day every New Year's Day.  Get out of debt (and then).  Live below my means.  Love my friends even if they are wrong and do things that hurt others (or me).  I have done wrong things, and I have hurt others, and though I never did it on purpose, I needed the love of friends to see me through.  Ooops...too heavy.  Devote myself to writing; but not to the exclusion of what matters.  Never give voice to  that , no matter how much I want to.

       Monday Five - DJS Version 1.0     1. What is one thing you don't like about your body?    1.  I'm getting gray much too soon.  I'm only 30 for crissakes!    2. What are two things you love about your body?    1.  I like my nose.  It's just the right size and isn't too pointy or weird looking.  Plus, the nostrils are just the right size for my fingers in case I have to do some quick excavating.    2.  My ears aren't bad either.  The cartiledge has stayed pretty solid and I don't have big Dumbo ears or anything.    3. What are three things you want to change about your home?    I'd like to (when we get a bigger place):   1.  Build a darkroom for photography and such.   2.  Design the ultimate office for writing and research.  When I get the book deal, I'd love to have that ready and waiting.    3.  I want to add a kid or two (or three) to the home.    4. What are four books you want to read this year?      1.  Return of the King    2.  Black House    3.   Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix    4.  Edgar Allen Poes Complete Tales    5.  The Thief Lord    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?     1.  Never sacrifice happiness for anything.   2.  To continue writing until I die.    3.  To never smoke filthy cigarettes or take any sort of illegal drugs.  (go ahead, call me square)    4.  To visit ancient places sometime.    5.   To never forget those who are important to me.

       Death has warmed over; What does it mean when...   A guy says he wants you to meet his parents?   He has already made plans with you for Valentine's day? He makes you breakfast?  Needless to say, I had a stellar weekend.  But currently I feel like ass...probably a combination of lack of sleep and doing shots last night after the Super Bowl.  Some highlights: -- Eating King Crab Legs and a bottle of wine...then going to a hole-in-the-wall bar with great U2 albums on the jukebox. -- Getting a call from Marc on Saturday night (when I was out with my friends for Girls' Night Out) with him asking whether Jake knew about viagra. -- Busting up a bathroom tryst between 2 white trash clowns during the Super Bowl.  The guy was this short little creep, who claimed he "was helping her because she was sick."  "I think you helped her enough, asshole, so now it's time you fucking took a hike."  "What are you going to do about it?"  "Whatever, little man."  He seriously wanted to fight me.  The funniest thing I've experienced since telling a certain mall-haired girl, "This ain't Madonna bitch."

      FYI, while the article IS disturbing, it's controversial because many are saying it's not quite the epidemic that Rolling Stone(r) is making it out to be.  Apparently, if you only site one named souce and one anonymous source when proclaiming a crisis, it's considered "sloppy journalism".  So while we may all be going to hell, don't base that opinion on the article alone.

      Here's where I was confused: Even though it says very plainly that Duf posted at 10:31 on Thursday, I thought DJS posted that, hence the plea for him to read the biography.  So F DJS...Duf should read  The Hidden Life .  Sorry Duf...I should know your writing style from DJS'.  Will you forgive me?

      Friends,  Let me make it plain.  I did not like  'On The Road' , and because of that, I've never bothered with any other Jacky Kerouac books.  F him.  For some reason (and it could be the time when I read it) the book did absolutely nothing for me.  Admittedly, I don't read much in the way of high-brow literature.  I kind of read junky books (mystery thrillers, kids books, Irvine Welsh) so I'm not what someone would call 'well read' and it's probably because I'm not really impressed with literature for art's sake.  I just like a good story.  When I read  'On The Road'  I didn't think it was a good story.  I've never been a big fan of the 'beat nation' writings and I swear I was going to get sick if I had to read about this clown going back and forth across the country one more time.  I really wanted to like his stuff.  I mean, the Beastie Boys dig him, so why shouldn't I?  Alas...it was not to be.  Now J.D. Salinger?  Me likey.

      DJS,  FYI: I have not even read  The Fountainhead .  But I like Jack Kerouac too.  Since you like his writings, I would suggest reading his biography  Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac .  It takes a good look at his tortured psyche... I think you would enjoy it.  Cheers, Panda

      So I picked up a copy of Jack Kerouac's  On the Road  at the airport.  And I paid more for it than a book of this sort should cost.  I always think that  On the Road  should be like tarot cards.  The kind of thing you are not supposed to buy but are supposed to just happen upon.    I know this book is one that you either love or hate, and, if memory serves, DJS is in the hate camp. But, to me, I can tell you that, 1/3 of the way into the book, it will definitely be a favorite of mine.    As I have been reading it, on planes and in airports, people have come up to me and commented.  It's a community building book.  Here is an excerpt that stuck with me.  There are others that stuck with me more, but it would take a long time to type them, and after my lengthy post earlier this week...  "He was simply a youth tremendously excited with life, and though he was a con man, he was only conning because he wanted so much to live and to get involved with people who would otherwise pay no attention to him.  He was conning me and I knew it (for room and board and "how to write", etc.) and he knew I knew (this has been the basis of our relationship), but I didn't care and we got along fine - no pestering, no catering; we tiptoed around each other like heartbreaking new friends."  To me, the book is a love letter to America, and it is poetry.  I may end up liking it like Panda likes  The Foutainhead .

       Yes, I'm a damn video game nerd.   I hurriedly went out to Best Buy today because I've been in the market for a new video game.  Knowing today was the release date, I scooped up  'The Getaway'  for the Playstation 2 and I think I'm almost as excited as Stoner was for her boyfriend to come home to play this game.  It takes place in London and youget to play as a vigilante cop who is on the wrong side of the law.  Yeah!  The best part, is that the instruction booklet has a definition for some of the 'slang' they speak.  I had no idea that they called the Police 'The Filth.'  Wow.  Now it makes sense why Irvine Welsh's book 'Filth' featured a picture of a pig with a bobby helmet on.  The other nice part is that the game is rated 'M' for mature.  On the back, it informs you why.  - Blood - Drug Reference - Strong Language - Strong Sexual Content - Violence  Guns.  Exploding cars.  Mob bosses.  This is going to be the best game ever. I want to go home now.

       Traveling with Panda could be hazardous to your health -    I got copied on the following email today:  Hey James, Panda here...Paul's big sister.  Remember me?  I think I did a keg stand in front of you a few years back.  Well, Paul gave me your e-mail because I told him I was going to Phoenix the weekend of February 8th to see a Coldplay show at the Dodge Theater.  2 questions for you: 1) Is Tempe far from Phoenix?...if not, you should hang out with me and my friend HAL on Saturday night. 2) If Tempe *is* far from Phoenix, is there a bar(s) you could suggest for 2 swingin' cats with stunning personalities? (I'm talking about me and HAL.)  Give me the scoop! Cheers, Panda  I was expecting a quick, simple, early-night vacation.  If Panda is reeling in Paul's buddies, I better make sure my insurance premiums are paid.

      I'm staying at Le Parker Meridien this week.  Last night the fire alarm went off at about 4am.  I don't think it was very loud, because I didn't wake up right away, but then all of a sudden it stopped.  It's funny the logic you go through when half asleep.  I distinctively remember thinking, "If there really is a fire  someone  will knock on my door and tell me."  What?  But I was just so cozy in the feather bed, you know?  So for about the next 2 hours the fire chief kept getting on the intercom saying "The fire has been taken care of; everyone stay in your rooms..."    I guess my logic wasn't so crazy after all.

      Wow.  Powerful haiku from our very own Panda now available at  urlLink Discount Haiku .  In case anyone is keeping score, I'm writing a synopsis of my first book.  It's supposed to be roughly 3 pages and sum up a 300 page children's novel.  Okay, officially, I'd rather write another whole damn book than do this.  How evil is that?  The thing I'm writing to 'pitch' my book is sloppy, dull, and if I were reading it, there's no way I'd want to be my own agent.  Open one of these windows.  I want to jump out of it.

      "In 27 years, I have worn approximately 7020 pairs of socks, and I have owned approximately 810 pairs of socks."  I know this is not true, because in the summer I hardly ever wear socks (even at work) and the socks I do have I've owned for at least 5 years.  Plus, do they count hose?  Because if they do, that might bring the number up.  But at any rate, there is no way this is close to the right number.  I feel very defensive today.  Maybe that's because I was just ripped a new asshole by my boss.  It's Review/Evaluation day (aka Motivation to get a new job Day).  I think I will write a haiku to express myself better...

       I Get Knocked Down, but I Get Up Again/You Light Up My Senses/Judge Him By the Content of His Riffs/Echoes   "Hell yeah."  Speaking of British music, I heard Chumbawamba singing on MPR this weekend (yep that makes me a double nerd); they sang this tune called "Jacob's Ladder: Not in My Name."  It was VERY political and after my goof yesterday, I will leave it there, but I'm all about Chumbawamba now (do I hear triple nerd concentrate?).  I saw at CD now dot com that they have a double disc with Noam Chomsky!  I might have to scoop that up.  And I don't care if you all tease me either, because I know there is at least one John Denver fan on this site!  By the way, I also like Woody and Arlo Guthrie.  There, it's out.    It hurts me that you all dog out Adam like you do.  I want to change my vote to Claytonland.  Isn't the bass track on the  Under-A-Blood-Red-Sky  version of "Gloria" enough for redemption?  Must he also be handsome?  I'm so sick of gender oppression I could scream!  All echoes and mad love for "25th Hour".  I am a Spike Lee fan, and I thought he was near the height of his game here.  I too, thought Barry and Ed did a great job, but my kudos go to the always phenomenal Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Also, Anna Paquin did a fine job.  I recommend the movie without reservation.

      Bonoland, Edgeville, and Larryopolis all get my vote.  Panda, I also saw “25th Hour” (with Duf) and really, really liked it.  Ed Norton is super awesome.  I’ve never  not  liked him in something (even “Keeping The Faith” was cute).  Some day my loyalty will pay off.  But I thought that Barry Pepper (the Wall Street buddy) stole the show.  On a side note, I’ve been listening to The Clash as of late, and they are fucking amazing.  Can I get a “Hell yeah”?

      So it's pretty timely  and  coincidental that I just saw "25th Hour" on Sunday night: a movie about a guy facing a 7-year prison term.  I'd say Edward Norton shows us his best performance YET as Monty Brogan, a pretty decent guy...who happens to deal drugs.  Some fantastic commentary on post-9/11 New York.  If you see it, pay close attention to the scene where his own reflection yells at himself about the various ethnic groups scattered throughout NYC.  The audience roared...  So why is it so eerie that I just saw this?  To make a long story short: I just found out Billygoat is going to the Big House for a few days next week to make-good on a little mishap that occurred about 3 years ago.  Granted it's no 7-year term, but I still told him he better "watch his back" while he's there...if you know what I mean.  He wasn't amused.  And to think I could have had conjugal visits?

       Prologue:   Let me start by saying that I like Pandyland best when it is madcap and silly.  My plan is to go right back to my madcap self right after this really, really, long post.  Still, I really want to get something off my chest, and I think this might be the forum for doing it.  So, pardon me for my response to President Bush's recent decision to oppose the diversity plan used by the University of Michigan to increase the enrollment of minority students.  If you don't want to read this lengthy post, please don't.  I promise not to write like this very often.     Overview Comments:   1.  I am not necessarily a proponent of affirmative action.  I think we are close to the point in our society where race is not a prohibitive barrier.  It is a barrier, but I feel that for most people of color (especially middle class and up people of color), it is surmountable.  In my view, socio-economic status matters more than race.  I would much rather belong to any racial or ethnic group and be middle class than be white and poor.  Although I have encountered racism in my life, I have been fortunate and have been able to just consider it the misguided misgivings of misanthropes.    Also, affirmative action programs leave minorities in a precarious place.  Minorities feel that they are perceived as underqualified, and they may feel pressure to prove that they belong.  Not an easy burden to bear, let me tell you.  2.  With the exception of about 50 schools, I think, particularly at the undergraduate level, colleges and universities are about the same.  As a youngster, I had the great good fortune of attending two colleges, one of average reputation (Kansas University, my alma mater) and one of stellar reputation (Georgetown University).  Now, I'm not naive, and I understand that prestige paper has its blessings, but when I consider the quality of education I received at both institutions, I'm hard pressed to say that one was better (academically) than the other.  I can say that I was more inspired,  on the whole , by the intelligence of my fellow students and Georgetown, but I might actually argue that the students at Kansas worked harder (and trust me, there were plenty of kids at old KU who could have gone to any school in the country).  I know for a fact that grade inflation is more alive and well at Georgetown than it is at KU.    Anyway, it is hard for me not to see, to some extent, much of the conversations about Affirmative Action as really being "I'm chapped that I can't get into Yale."  Again, I definitely see that there is a value to having a degree from the ivies, the seven sisters or the blue-chip schools.  But, at the same time, it is hard for me not to say:  "okay, you didn't get into Michigan.  Go to Michigan State or Ohio State or the University of Vermont."  Can this conversation be about more than people feeling like they should get into whatever school they want all the time?  I bet most people who applied to multiple schools, can relate experiences that seem odd (when I applied to law school, I got in to two top fifteen schools:  Cornell and the University of Texas, but did not get in to the University of North Carolina - a school that was then just outside of the top 25; go figure.).  3.  Much has been said about how being from a select racial or ethnic group is worth 20 points in the admissions program at Michigan - the same number of points awarded to students who get a perfect 1600 on the S.A.T.  Without getting in to it too much, let me say:  "so what?"  Being an athelete is worth 20 points too, but I don't hear anyone saying "Craig Krenzel took my spot at Ohio State - I think that is totally unfair!"  [note to Pandylanders:  Craig Krenzel is the quarterback of the Ohio State football team.  Ohio State won the national championship this year for the first time since 1968.  Craig Krenzel is white.]   My Beef with George:   1.  I see this as being about more than a University's right to allocate points to assure diversity within its student population.  Colleges and universities have criteria that favor a lot of different classes.  You get points for being an athelete, a musician, an Eagle Scout (even though it is a discriminatory organization - a different rant for a different day), a citizen of a less than populous state, graduating from a prestigious high-school, graduating/surviving from a really shitty school, being a legacy (having parents who went to the school where you are applying), being the child of someone famous, beign the child of someone wealthy, completing highly-regarded academic programs (like the I.B. program), writing a strong essay, doing well on a standardized test, being from a specialized racial group, or being gay or lesbian among other things.  Why target just one criterion?  If it is permissible to say that a school should take effort to make sure that kids from North Dakota get in, why is it impermissible for a school to take efforts to make sure kids from diverse racial backgrounds get in?  For those who oppose the criterion, how do you know your place was taken by a minority, and not, say by a kid who plays a mean clarinet?  Given that admissions is as much an art as it is a science, can we ever know with certainty who displaced who?    By the way, one could argue that among the criterion above, most allow greater access for non-minorities:  for example, there are disproportionately few minority Eagle scouts (and even fewer  gay  Eagle Scouts; and absolutely NO women Eagle Scouts), there are few minorities in Wyoming, legacy programs disporporitionately favor non-minorities, and so on.    2.  George Bush was a "C" student at Yale and gained admission into the Harvard M.B.A. program.  While this does not preclude him from coming down against affirmative action; he must yield to concerns that this is a fine time for him to start working toward fair admission standards (not to mention wondering about when he will go after some of the other unfairnesses that characterize our college acceptance processes).  3.  With the exception of historically black institutions, there is no university in the United States, that I am aware of, that has a disproportionately high number of minority students.  The only possible exception that I can think of would be large Asian populations at some schools, but arguments about whether they "deserved" admission tend to fall a bit flat.  In other words, no one has a beef with a kid who is a national merit finalist and has a 4.0 (plus) no matter the kid's ethinic or racial background.   By contrast, there are school, especially private schools that have a disproportionately high non-minority population.  In fact, some schools, Bob Jones University comes to mind, receive federal funding while espousing view-points that discourage minority application (Bob Jones is against miscegenation (on Christian grounds no less)).  Bob Jones receives federal funding as do other schools that are unattractive to minority applicants (Oral Roberts, the Citadel and Brigham Young come to mind).  Look, give those schools money (hell, even give them my tax money), just don't cry foul when other schools answer the moral call to counter-act their efforts.   4.  Last, schools from states with larger minority populations (like Michigan), should be allowed latitude in developing student bodies that mirror (or come close to mirroring) their communities.  I hope few would find much to praise in a University of Virginia or a SUNY school that had very few minorities; I know few have a beef with the low number of minority students at the University of Utah.     Final Thoughts:   Still, what I would like to see instead of programs that work to insure admission to students based upon their ethnic or racial background are three things:  1.  An effort to make the overall admission process more fair at all Universities.  2.  Favor racial and ethnic groups only in cases where it is needed (don't award the 20 points to the hispanic kid from Auburn Hills whose parents are surgeons, who went to some fancy private school in Detroit, murdered the S.A.T., travelled abroad her sophomore year, and got an Infiniti for her sweet 16; instead, save the points for the minority kids who grew up less than priviliged and still finished school and  did well enough  to earn a Michigan degree.  Regardless of whether they did  as well as  some other kid who did not get in to Michigan, but will probably get in to Ohio State or the University of Illinois or Dana College in Blair, Nebraska.    3.  Let's have a conversation instead about the students each year who don't go to college (although they could) because they cannot afford to go (either because of money or circumstance).  Instead of efforts to deny admission to some (no-doubt) deserving students of color; why not efforts to promote admission for the deserving poor?  Sorry so lengthy,  Duf

       News Update: Award Shows Still Suck  - or-  Why I Hate Dick Gere.   Okay, so I should know better, but I watched a good chunk of the Golden Globes last night anyway.  Yeah, The Two Towers gots pantsed left and right to sub-par movies like 'Gangs of New York' and 'Chicago', but I'm not bitter.  Well, maybe a little.  Admittedly, I'm not that big of a J.R.R. Tolkien nerd.  I've read all of the Lord of the Rings books except for the last one, which I anticipate will be enjoyed toward the end of the year...but even so, I am completely enthralled with what Peter Jackson's crew has accomplished since working on the films.  Yes, I'm a movie nerd and I've watched every little nugget of the extras on the 'Fellowship of the Ring: Extended Edition' (save for the commentaries) and I'm sorry, but if there was ever a director who deserved a 'Best Director' win, it's good ol' Kiwi Peter Jackson.  You won't find another director who was more involved with what was happening with not one but THREE gigantic films taking place at the same time.  But no...let's pucker up and kiss Marty Scorsese's ass a little more.  'Gangs of New York' was a big bloated stinksore of a movie that was decent for the first 20 minutes, and lost track of itself for the remaining 2 hours and 10 minutes.  F you, Marty.  But again, I'm not bitter.  I just turned off the Golden Globes after that.  Oh Jesus, but I wished I would've shut 'er off sooner.  Anyone see the contenders for best Dramatic Series on TV?  Yes, my Sopranos were nominated, but alas, they succumbed to 'The Shield', which judging from the clip they showed before giving the award away was probably the most horribly-acted, piss-poorest editing done...ever.  And they hand the award over.  It's gotta be political.  'The Sopranos' is single-handedly the best TV show on tv...period.  I may be biased.  Oh...and can someone tell me why people are so in love with Dick Gere?  Okay, he made a movie that a few women liked called 'Pretty Women' but he's no actor.  In EVERY single movie he's ever done, he plays the same gray-haired, rodent-eyed smarmy asshole he plays in EVERY other movie he's ever been.  Hey, Dick...why not stretch your horizons a bit?  Play a drooling retard, or someone that doesn't always get the girl, or better yet...play someone other than yourself you self-righteous twat.  I'm sorry, but about 10 minutes into his acceptance speech, I wanted to poke out my eardrums with a pencil.  Hey asshole, if we wanted to hear the end credits, we'd stick around after the movie was over.  Wow.  I need to calm down or take another day off or something...

      F It...It's the Friday Five!   1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?    I like novels and admittedly, I read mostly fiction.  I tend to stay away from newspapers and magazines of substance because I like to stay pleasantly uninformed.  Turns out, I'm not missing much.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My favorite novel?  That's a tough one.  I guess I'll just list SOME of my favorite novels.  I really liked Stephen King's  'Misery.'   It was a bajillion times better than that pathetic movie they made with Kate Bates and Jim Caan.  The movie was Candyland in comparison.  (ooooh...big revelation, the book was better.)  I also like the book  'Filth'  by Irvine Welsh quite a bit.  Then again, I like just about everything that gadge writes.  This is a hard question to answer...it's kind of like asking me what my favorite movie is.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  It's too long to write, but it's  The Cremation of Sam McGee.   You can read it  urlLink here .  I've never been a big poetry buff, but the ones I really tend to like are ones with a story.  Call me a simpleton, but I'm a sucker for a clever tale...    4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  Either the Bible or Dianetics, though I probably never will.  I really want to see what all these religious kooks are making such a big fuss about.  Plus, I want to read about Scientology so I can make fun of it and not feel so guilty.   5. What are you currently reading?  Right now, I'm reading a children's novel by Cornelia Funke called  'The Thief Lord.'   It's pretty good.  Supposedly, she's like almost as popular as JK Rowling in other parts of the world.  I'll probably finish it this weekend and prepare myself for  'The Return of the King.'

      Panda, I'm glad you're enjoying your day.  Last Friday, DJS, Duf and I enjoyed an "Old School" matinee at the glorious Mall.  I think you and your coworker would have liked it a lot.  Today was also our cake day - last day of the month!  We're only allowed on piece per person, as ordered by Jan.  I don't know why she makes a point of emailing this ration info to everyone, as we always end up dumping several pieces of dried-up sheet cake, but she does.  DJS, nice tale.  I hope that Wendy's addresses your issues satisfactorily.   By the way, what happened to the "F5" this week?

       Office Shenanigans   We are  incredibly  bored today.  Rob and I have done the following:  1) Played on-line video games (most wouldn't qualify Solitaire as a video game, but I disagree.) 2) Highlighter War...I won because one of the highlighters I threw at Rob exploded.  His bunker was the refrigerator, mine was an office chair. 3) "Can You Take It?"  A game of strength & stupidity: I sat there with my eyes closed, while Rob tried to throw paper wads at my face  as hard as he could . 4) Boobie trapping our office mates: We put a box of stuff (paper, highlighters, stuffed animal(?)) on the top of the door and called one of our coworkers to come over to our office.  This failed miserably since the door got stuck.  (Mental note: test boobie trap next time.) 5) We're going to the movie  Old School  now.    Have a good weekend.

      Here's mine.  Sorry for the length, friends.  BTW - It's absolutely true. ------------------------------------------------------------   Wendy's Consumer Relations Wendy's International, Inc. 4288 W. Dublin-Granville Rd. Dublin, OH 43017  February 28, 2003  Dear Sir/Madam,  I’ve always loved Wendy’s.  From their delicious, juicy hamburgers to their crisp and pleasantly salted French fries all the way down to the creamy and simply dreamy Frosty shakes.  Dave Thomas created a legendary burger shop where quality could be experienced visit after visit.  It was a real treat to enjoy my meals under Wendy’s roof.  That was, until last Saturday, February 22nd 2003.  My friend and I had the unfortunate pleasure of visiting your Woodbury, Minnesota location sometime around 8:30pm.  We entered the establishment hoping to fill our growling bellies full of deliciousness and stepped up to the counter.  Waiting behind the counter was a scowling young man by the name of Kahled.  As I approached the ‘Can I help you’ zone, I received nothing of the sort.  Kahled merely glared at me as I smiled and got ready to place my order.  With nary a grunt, he punched in my meal:  - A number five with only ketchup, mustard, pickles, cheese and bacon. - A pack of 5 chicken tenders. - A delicious Mug root beer soft drink. - Regular fries (I decided not to ‘Biggie Size’ it that night)  Kahled grumbled something that I couldn’t understand.  When I asked him: ‘Come again, friend?’  He sighed and said rather loudly and abruptly: ‘What do you want on it?’  I repeated my request and he scornfully made the necessary corrections.  I felt like I was inconveniencing young Kahled.  As he went to collect the items that made up my order, he engaged himself in a quick kung-fu fight near the bubbling machine where the fries are made.  Another worker, complete in drive-thru gear, launched a kick toward Kahled’s nether regions.  The kick was blocked, but with my ‘to go’ bag in hand.  The paper was crushed and my eyes widened in horror.  This was the bag my food was going to go into?  With no sense of urgency, Kahled collected the rest of my order and dropped them into my mangled sack.  At the soft drink fountain, he began to pour my non-Biggie-sized beverage.  As you probably know, root beer tends to foam a bit more than other soft drinks.  He poured the delicious drink and stopped when the foam got to the top.  Instead of waiting for the bubbles to dissipate, he merely capped it and handed me my order.  He handed me my meal and said nothing.  Not even a ‘Here you go’ or a ‘Thank you.’  He wore the same dejected look throughout the whole transaction.  Even during the kung-fu battle.   When I opened my soft drink, it was as I suspected.  The cup was 3/4s full.  Not the usual value I’ve come to expect from Wendy’s.  My friend received similar treatment and we both decided on the ride home that we had just experienced Wendy’s at its worst: All because of a young miserable boy by the name of Kahled.  I do enjoy the food I’ve received from Wendy’s in the past.  I’m sure, in time, I may be able to forget the awful experience I endured at the hands of Kahled.  I’ve always liked what Dave Thomas stood for, but I must say that Mr. Thomas would be absolutely appalled at the treatment we received at the Woodbury Wendy’s last Saturday night.  Please know that I’m going to avoid this location for a long time to come.  I felt I should pass this incident on to you so that the integrity and Dave’s legacy would not be tainted by someone as awful as Kahled.  I am withholding my home address so that my home isn’t attacked by Kahled and his kung-fu squad.  If you’d like to reach me to discuss this further, I can be reached at my work number:  555-123-4567.  Fondly, DJ Shovelpants   ------------------------------------------------------------ I had to mail it, sadly.  I don't expect a prompt response.

      Duf,  As you requested, I have written my one letter.  I wrote this to Kellogg's, praising their Special K Red Berries cereal.   Dear Sir/Madam:  You don’t know how happy it makes me to see those freeze-dried strawberries every time I pour myself a bowl of Kellogg’s Special K Red Berries.  I have always been a big fan of the “traditional” Special K – growing up, my grandma ate a bowl everyday while preaching your mantra to anyone who would listen: “if you can pinch an inch…”  So with the addition of the “Red Berries,” not only am I keeping grandma’s legacy alive, but I’m also enjoying the sweetness the new Berries have to offer.  However, I do have 2 questions:  1) Why did you name the strawberries “Red Berries”?  Is there a trademark on the word “Strawberry”?  Do people ever complain because they were expecting RASPBERRIES in their cereal? (because those are red too) 2) Have you ever thought about selling the freeze-dried strawberries SEPARATE from the cereal?  I have to say, sometimes I just empty a box and dig around for the crunchy sweet goodness of the “Red Berries”.  They remind me of when I tried space food when I went to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago as a kid…weird texture, but oddly delicious.  You could dominate an entirely new food category with this idea: Cereal Accompaniments.  If you sell them separately in their own bags, consumers could buy them to put on any kind of cereal they wish, not just Special K.  Please tell me if this is something you have already considered.  And again, thank you for a great breakfast experience.  Keep the Berries coming.   I will keep you posted on any reply I receive. I am already expecting a form letter, so maybe I'll be delightfully surprised.

       Down with Biscomerica!   After waiting days for the response to my note to Biscomerica, I got a flat reply.  Here's my note (reprinted):   I just had a bag of Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies, and they were delicious.  I actually shared them with some co-workers (keeping my calories down, you know) and we all liked them a lot.  We had a disagreement about whether the hats were separate or if they just broke off from the Uncle Sam cookies.  Could you settle this for us?  I think that the hats come separately.  Also, and this is unrelated, but we were thinking that since America is one nation under God, it might be a good idea to do a line of religious cookies.  We thought you could incorporate some images of our Lord, like Jesus, sandles, fish, wine and a crucifix.  Just an idea. Thanks and best wishes with your cookies.  Now more than ever we need to stay together as a country.   Here is my response from Trixie Fargo (no lie) at Biscomerica:   Thank you for taking the time to contact us!  We are delighted to hear that you enjoy our USA cookies.  The hat should be attached to Uncle Sam, as depicted on the front of the package.  Thank you!  Trixie Fargo   Trixie, you are wrong!  On the front of the package, there is a hat by itself.  Not only that, she completely left out JESUS!  Corporate America:  where's the passion?  I don't feel the passion.

      HAL, someday I would like to hear the story about the blood all over your fridge.  That sounds bizarre...you could have made up some great story for one of the gem-sical blind dates you had recently.  "Yes, so now I would like you to see my  bloody  refrigerator..."  You know me, I always like a good tall-tale.  So Duf, your cynicism towards whether the current fella will be around 'til June would definitely be warranted under usual circumstances...I've been known to be somewhat fickle.  Hey, as they say, you gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your handsome prince.  But my cold-hearted snake exterior has been breaking down with this one...and it finally collapsed on Saturday when I was asked the question (this is the second time this has been asked, mind you): "Can I call you my girlfriend?"  (Dorky, I know, but that's a huge reason I like the big galoot.)  "Yes, I guess that would be alright."  When I told HAL this story, she told me she felt tears welling up.  Softy.  And if that's not enough, I'm making the  real  big leap: he's going to Wisconsin with me this weekend to meet the 'rents.  Stoner and HAL know that Proud Mary can be just about as blunt as me, so this should be interesting.  If he survives, I just might have to keep him around until the Coldplay show.  Maybe.    Since the tickets were sent to me and are in my possession, I am in the power seat.  As it should be.

      May the records show that my previous post about Bono is nothing like my trying to understand how people are so enamored with Coldplay.   urlLink The Post That Started It All   I merely cited that he was corny for saying that like crops in Iowa, 'movements' can be planted with the good Midwestern people.  I wholeheartedly concur that everyone has their own tastes, but I don't dislike Coldplay.  Really I don't.  If their songs come on the radio, I sing a few lines and hum the rest.  I guess I haven't experienced 'Pure Coldplay Satisfaction' as some of you other kids have.  Also, to lend some credibility to my constant thirst for why some bands have it and others don't, let me point out that I own  'Corey Hart: The Singles'  on CD.    Never Surrender, indeed.  So there.

      DJS, your Coldplay comments are awful reminiscent of the “What’s the deal with Bono?” post a few months back.  So I’m just going to concede that everyone has their own tastes, and leave it at that.  I’m crabby today.  As most of you know, I volunteer each month for 3 lousy hours.  For those who don’t know, in this time, I help prepare a meal for the “less fortunate”, aka our friends in the alcoholic/schizophrenic homeless community.  About every 4 months or so, I take a turn and plan the meal.  Meaning, I figure out what to cook for dinner for about 125 men, go to the grocery store and purchase said food items on a budget of about $100 (I am reimbursed for the expense), and bring this meal to a place where I prepare it with about 5 other volunteers.  It’s a pain to do, but as I said before, I only do it a few times each year.  So on Sunday I went to the Cub foods that I hate (the one in Edina) and picked up 20 boxes of pasta, 20 jars of meat sauce, several pounds of cheese, a few pounds of carrots (even drug addicts need their Vitamin D, yo) and a huge box of Oreos (drug addicts especially like the Oreos).  Granted, it’s not gourmet, but you try keeping things imaginative at less than $1/head.  I get the usual stares from people in the store – what?  A girl can’t stock up??? – pay up, and leave.  Shopping isn’t the big headache in this process, folks.  It’s the hauling.  As you can guess, the items above are heavy.  And I’m one girl.  So after shopping, I load the items in my car.  And then I realize that 20 jars of pasta sauce will likely freeze in my trunk.  And the carrots and cheese probably won’t do so hot, either.  So I leave the pasta in the trunk and haul everything else up to my apartment.  Bags are ripped, multiple trips made, but the job finally gets done.  The fridge is full, and I’ve got a few bags of sauce to navigate, but it’s only for a day or two, so no big deal.  This is no worse than the time I had 30 pounds of ground beef bleed all over my refrigerator, but that’s a story for another time.  Today I get an email from someone else in the group (who, for the record, I adore) saying she purchased the meal for tonight, so I write back and say, gee, that’s great, but I already did that too.    Several of us back-and-forth-ed over “what should we do?”, and it looks like I’m going to have to haul everything over there, and still end up hauling much of it back to be stored by yours truly for a month, at which time I can haul it over there again.  So I’m irritated.

      Okay...at the risk of being tarred and feathered, I just don't get the whole Coldplay thing.  Yeah, I think some of their songs are pretty good, but damn...you guys are passionate about them fellas.  (I'm sorry if I'm lumping Stoner with the rest of y'all...I'm not sure if she's a fan or not.)  Admittedly, I haven't heard either albums of theirs all the way through, but there hasn't been anything too significant (that I've heard) that just grabs me.  Sorry, friends.  Personally, I thought the Simon and Garfunkel thing felt awkward.  It's pretty obvious that Art hasn't been doing much these days and it kind of showed.  I don't know if it's because it's Madison Square Garden or what, but a lot of the performances were pretty flat.  They didn't seem like they wanted to be perfoming together...and for the record, I love me some Pauly Simon.    I thought the Nelly/Kelly Rowlands thing was almost unwatchable.  Mixing his two hits together didn't work well and it showed.  Afterwards, Nellyson had a look on his face that said  'Even this fake bandaid on my face isn't gonna save this one.'

       The Definitive Grammy's, by Duf'   Top three moments at the Grammy's (in order from cool to coolest):  3.  Simon and Garfunkel opening the show with the "Sounds of Silence."  2.  Eminem singing "You Only Get One Shot" backed by the Roots (they were goin' off in the background).  1.  Der:  Coldplay singing "Politik" backed by the New York Philharmonic.  Best Grammy moment ever.  I could just feel them saying:  "this war is a bad idea." I always love passion and sincerity , and they had both.  I was pulling my hair out and screaming for June to hurry on up so I can go see them (drinkie winkie poo) in Chicago with Panda and the fella (assuming he is still on the scene - or is that cynical?)    I loved the Clash tribute, DJS, but I would rank it fourth.  My favorite thing about the Grammy's is it really distinguishes between artists.  Avril Levigne exposed herself as a flash in the pan (or to quote Robin Williams (holding the grammy to his ear) "I can actually hear careers ending!").  No Doubt continues to refuse to die even though  there's really not a lot up there.     The Dixie Chicks are talented musicians, no denying that, but man were they flat.  Ladies, ease up on the Valium.  Nelly was surprisingly flat (could it be the production?).  John Mayer seemed poised for a 16 year old, and the classically trained woman who sang before him and has some pop song I have heard a dozen times but don't know was quite good too.  I always love Yo Yo Ma, even when he is playing with bald wife-beaters.  Norah is solid, and I was happy to see her get the praise she got, but the Grammy's has a tendency to overdo it year after year.  It is a great disc, and she is a great singer, but I don't know if ALL THAT PRAISE was merited (Similarly, as much as I loved the "O Brother Where Art Thou" soundtrack last year, I think it was over-awarded.  I'm Norah, I don't want to start my career with my debut album winning 5600 Grammy awards.  Talk about setting yourself up for a sophomore slump... (not to jinx her).  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get drunk and go shopping (for burritos that is).

      DJS, unfortunately I fell asleep before I could catch the Clash tribute...and I did not fall asleep because I thought the Grammy's were boring, but it had been a rough weekend for me.  You didn't tape it by chance??  Tremendous Avril Lacrap haikus, by the way.  Did any of you see MTV's pre-Grammy show?  What was her problem there...she was acting like she had never been out in public before.  Angst?  More like social-moron-asshead-half-wit.

      The Grammy's SUCK.  Sorry, friends.  I'm an awards-show junkie, but the Grammy's just don't do it for me.  Plus, they were on during "Alias", so I saw very little.  Duf told me that while Coldplay won a few "gongs" (as they call them in the UK), those categories weren't included in the telecast, so they were not allowed to speak.  That's all I needed to seal my contempt of that show.

      I'm going to have to disagree with you a bit, Panda.  While Coldplay's performance was one of the better of the evening, I think the best part of the Grammy's was when Sil, Dave Grohl, The Boss & Elvis Costello did their Clash tribute for 'London Calling.'  I don't know, I got the warm fuzzies seeing all of those guys playing together, plus the dude from No Doubt was back there laying some chunky bass riffs down.  I thought ol' Chris was going to knock himself out, head-banging whilst tickling the ivories.  For the record, this is the first Grammy's that I actually watched more than 65% of.  Could it be because of Norah Jones???  Mayhap...

      How 'bout those  urlLink Grammy's ?  Ms. Jones cleaned up, but Coldplay's performance was the most memorable, IMHO.  Chris Martin can wail on that piano.  HAL, I will continue to stand in line behind you to bear his children.

       Fun things to do when you're drunk:   1) Uuuuhhzzzssh. 2) Eat burritos. 3) Dance. 4) Sing karaoke. 5) Client conference calls. 6) Go shopping.  I experienced #6 on Saturday afternoon, and never could have imagined how fun it could be.  Me and the fella were having a nice, lazy Saturday - went to a museum, walking around Michigan Ave...when we stumbled across the Mexican restaurant "Su Casa" and decided to have some lunchie and drinkie.  After 2 large margaritas (it doesn't take much), I was ready to shop until I literally dropped.  First I dragged fella to Ann Taylor and wanted to try on several dresses.  When they asked me if I wanted him to come into the dressing area with me I screamed "Absolutely NOT!"  I was confused because I thought she was suggesting he go  in my dressing room with me  (not that I'm  that  modest, but I thought it was weird), but what she meant was that he sit in this sitting area they have for the men.  The dresses weren't exactly working out, and when the sales lady knocked on my door, without even thinking, I opened it - and didn't have my shirt on.  I think the men were happy to be shopping with their wives that day, because they got a nice show from me.  Fella just laughed his ass off..."When you did that, I was just under the impression that women's dressing rooms were, you know, very  free ..."  No, that's just me being a drunk asshole.  On to Bloomingdale's to try on more dresses...  I insisted on going to the designer section ( so unlike me  considering TJ Maxx is more up my alley)...and then proceeded to 1) Open a Bloomingdale's charge card, and 2) Buy $400 worth of stuff.  When I was at the Clinique counter, I wanted to buy my mom some eye cream for her birthday, so I asked the lady what was the difference between all the varieties they had.  "Well, this one softens lines, and this one reduces puffiness, and this one..."  "Um,  whatever .  I'll take the cheapest one." (FYI - Clinique ladies don't like it when you're a smart ass.)  Of course, we continued the evening at my favorite local bar (no HAL, not the Hangge Uppe): Monsignor Murphy's.  And their shot of the month: the delicious Oatmeal Cookie.  It couldn't have been a more perfect day.  But on Sunday I was wondering what I was doing with all this crap from Bloomingdale's.  Thank God for flexible return policies.

      PB,  You needn't have told him that - it is almost impossible to get in the pants of a Guatemalan woman.  It's like a friggin' Fort Knox of the pants or somethin' over there.

       PB can be emotional, y'all.   I know some may describe me as crass, blunt, bitchy, tough...maybe even a little crazy.  But believe it or not, I'm probably the biggest sap you'll ever meet, although I may not show it right away.  And it could not have been more evident than it was today: I met Billygoat for lunch, on his way to the airport for his 2-1/2 month trip to Central America.  This morning I gathered the rest of his crap he left at my place, all of the mail that he still has coming to my house, and I was fully prepared just to give him his shit and tell him to take a hike.  But I couldn't...when I saw him, I just started to cry.  It's not that I'm not over him, because believe me, I am.  But the thought of saying good bye to anyone - boyfriend or not - to possibly never see him again, is a very sad prospect.  So I sat in this Thai restaurant, had a very cathartic cry (first time I cried since we officially called off the wedding), and said  goodbye . That's it.  My office mate summed up why this happened: "It’s very easy to be unhappy with someone you don’t see.”  So true, my friends.   Now, where the hell is my beer??

       1. What is your most prized material possession?  I have a copy of “The Prophet” by Kahlil Gibran that my mother gave to my father (may he rest in peace) when they were dating.  I would say if I had to grab one THING in the event of a fire, that would be it.   2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  This is a bizarre thing about me, but I really don’t have a lot of my old stuff.  Much of it is still stored at dear old mom’s, and much of that has been thrown away.  So, I would say that thing I own that I have had the longest is “The Prophet.”    3. Are you a packrat?  In a way.  I have a hard time discarding magazines.  I have too many CDs and books, but other than that, it all must go.  Although, like Panda, I likes my photos too.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  I really like a clean house.  But, like most men, I really hate what you have to do to have one.  When I lived alone, my space was always spotless.  We have a maid now (don't hate) and that helps, but our house is too small for the stuff we have, so clutter is an issue.  When we have adequate storage space, we will be much better off.     5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  Themes:  "Damn dees people po’."  "Please God paint me."  And:  "Hand it on down, we'll take it!"

       1. What is your most prized material possession?  Oh, how can one decide?  I likey my framed autographed picture and CD of Bjork that I fought for tooth, nail and credit card to get on Ebay.  I also have an autographed picture of Alec Guiness in Obi Wan gear that I'm quite fond of.  Hmmm...I like my truck too, though I guess it's not actually mine.  Not for another 4 years, anyway.   2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  I guess it's the pajamas I got when I was born.  I fired out of my mom, they spanked me, wiped me off and stuffed me in these awful little pajamas that are like blue terrycloth and are as comfortable as sandpaper.  A couple of years ago, my mom gave them to me.  Guess she didn't need 'em anymore.   3. Are you a packrat?  You have no idea.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  I prefer a little clutter...okay, a generous amount of clutter.  This, however, doesn't agree with my beloved, so we try and reach a happy medium.  It took a long time for her to get used to not reshelving a book I was reading if I set it down for longer than 5 minutes.  I've gotten much better and so has she, God bless her...   5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  Kind of.  The downstairs shitter is the designated: Have a seat and enjoy yourself theme.  There's a framed photo of a picture I took in Chicago of a laundromat sign with the words DROP YOUR PANTS HERE, positioned above the toilet.  While you're seated, there is a cluster of goofy random black and white pictures that have been framed and arranged tastefully, including: a framed greeting card of a little boy reaching into his pants with a smile on his face, a picture of Sil (Steve VanZandt) of the Sopranos looking disgusted, an old sign that says MADAMS, PLEASE KEEP YOUR GIRLS OFF THE STREETS AFTER DARK, and some other nuggets.  I don't know how I got away with decorating that bathroom, but it's actually one of our favorite rooms.  It's got character, baby.

        1. What is your most prized material possession?  A Jedi not possessions prize.   2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  I agree with Panda, gotta be something from baby-hood.  To be specific, maybe it’s “Lamby”, my stuffed Lamb.  This just illustrates my lack of creativity, even as a child - I get a stuffed lamb and name it “Lamby”?!!??!     3. Are you a packrat?  Yes, a bit.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  I’m tidy but not too clean.  I dislike dusting, vacuuming, etc.  But I pick up after myself.  I just realized that it’s kinda weird how vacuum has 2 “u”s.   5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  Yes.  The theme is “affordable”.

       A Vast Improvement from Last Week    1. What is your most prized material possession?  Does a  collection  of things count?  If so, then my answer would be my huge collection of photos.  I have to say I usually have my camera with me during some of the funniest/greatest times of my life (HAL and Stoner can attest to that).  When thinking about this question, I thought about what I would cry hardest about if I ever lost it...I would  cry my eyes out  if my pictures were ever taken away.  I briefly considered my signed copy (by the entire band) of The Bends by Radiohead, but I thought I'd only whimper a little bit if that was ever gone.     2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  I'm sure my mom has a scrap of a blanket or something of mine when I was a baby, but the thing I remember  touching  me the most was a little gold ring my dad gave me when I was about 4 or 5 with my birthstone (emerald) in it.  I wore it so much it got a little bent, but I loved that ring.  It's still in my jewelry box.   3. Are you a packrat?  With letters, pictures, and CDs - yes.  But I got the "throw away" syndrome from my mom.  If I didn't throw things away like I do, I'd be swimming in crap since my apartment is so small.  I try to keep things simple - I'm a minimalist at heart.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  Spic-and-span, definitely.  Jillios used to make fun of me, saying I would prefer to live in a hospital.  If I could, I would clear my house of all junk...only clean surfaces.  Just a room (hardwood floors) with a chair, lamp, and a table.   5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  I only have one room (studio apartments are a bitch).  Everything has its place, even the knick-knacks, but there is no real "theme".  I can't wait to move into a larger space so I can finally decorate, but the truth is, not having room saves you a lot of money.

      Yes, DJS.  Your hunch is correct.  Having worked briefly for a start-up here in town, occasionally we'd send out mass e-mails to people who had registered on our site.  Sometimes, people would change their minds and send us an "unsubscribe" e-mail...that only fueled our fire because then we were sure their e-mail address was "live."

I know this isn't exactly a news-breaking event, but I've reached the boiling point.  I click on the things on the bottom of these awful e-mails telling these assholes that I don't want to get their newsletters anymore, but I'm beginning to think that might just INCREASE the amount of garbage I get in my e-mail box.  Since I'm quite the hot head at times, I've decided to strike back.  I'm sending each of them a nice little reply.  I'm also thinking of opening another site so that I can chronicle my battles with these dirty, filthy, leech-like spam-mails I get.

      Stoner - that's so spontaneous - I LOVE IT!  The only reason I would want to go on a cruise is because I could have access to a buffet 24-7.  Not that I would actually  eat  24-7, but just knowing the food is there would bring me great happiness.  Jan scares me.   My lack of filters came out again today.  Thong was showing us a picture of this girl in TCW magazine (TCW stands for "Today's Chicago Woman" - one of those free publications that shows you pictures of the so-called "swanky" crowd at their snob parties hanging out with so-called "celebrities" that happen to be in town...it's right up Thong's alley...the life she yearns for.)  Well, she told us that one of her friends told her she looked "just like" one of the girls on the "51 Singles You Should Know" list.  This is just about the gayest "article" ever - they ask these chachi's what their "Turn-ons" are or, please, tell us about your "Sense of Style".  Barf.  There were actually 2 pictures of the girl Thong supposedly looked like.  In one of them she looked fairly normal, but a little bloated, and the other one was kind of a glamour-shot type pose.  Thong made the mistake of asking me which one she looked more like.  My response (pointing at the glamour-shot pose): "You definitely look more like her.  She wears too much make-up."  Um, did I just say that?

      Stoner Gone Wild...  I am in a very deep state of shock. Excitement. And shock.   My honey got bored at work the other day and started checking out travel deals. He found a very, very good deal for a cruise and somehow managed to talk me into it. My tax return is much bigger than I had expected, so technically I can afford it, but I had planned to be financially responsible with it - and going to the Bahamas is something I've always wanted to do, but didn't expect to be doing this weekend.  I leave on Sunday. I come back the next Sunday. I will tell you all about the pretty tropical fish then.

      I hate Jan.  She and Chris Farley in drag 'are a lot alike.'  I wish that bloated sack of protoplasm was on the breadlines with her swimming pool-sized mug of ice, wondering where she went wrong.  Jan is the woman who:   1.  Asked me if I'd like some of her leftover Metamucil.  2.  Asked DJ LZ how good my aim is...(toilet aim, friends)  3.  Mentioned to more than a few folks here that her and her husband are 'naked people' as in they don't wear clothes much.  4.  Can't stand not knowing other people's business.  I could go on, but the list of crap she pulls is enough to get anyone else like her fired and deported eight times over.

       The Morbidly Obese Doth Offend from Time to Time   DJS, Hal and I work with this woman named "Jan." "Jan" is morbidly obese and she is our "Reception Specialist" (nope, I did not make that up).  Anyway, Jan figures prominently in the story I am about to tell.   Last week, we hired a gentleman by the name of HB.  HB is an African American.  He is in his late forties, has a moustache, three grown children, one grandchild and moved to the Twin Citays in 1975 to start working in the title business (for the record I was 7 in '75).  He is shorter than me by 6 inches or so, balding and well dressed (unlike the loveable Duf).  He is soft spoken and wears a ring on his right hand.  He cannot type 75 wpm.  He lives in Minneapolis (I live in "The Paul" or "Shots Paul," by the way).  He is a title expert and I had to use spell check to get "title" right.  He can not rock the mike.  He cannot bust a move (see photo, above:  nuff said about Duf).  He is not a vegetarian, a unitarian or uber-liberal.  He went to a private university and not the best land grant University in the world.  He drives an American car and talks to his parents more than once a month.  He has had a colonoscopy.  He has never had a one night stand with buxom twins, nor has he won an award for BMX trick riding.   Anyway, I was walking down the hall with HB, and on my way back to my desk Jan says to me, she says:  "You two are a lot a like."  That, my friends is superficial thinking at its shallowest.  In reply I simply said:  "Whereas you, 'Jan,' are unique in the world."

      I just entered Minneapolis as a potential spot for Dave Attell to do an 'Insomniac' show.  In 50 words or less, I had to try and sell this place.  How kick-ass would that be if they actually came here and had Mr. Attell do his thing?  Well, besides the fact that they'd give me a $1000.00 too...  DVD Update: I got the Insomniac DVD and have watched 85% of it already.  It's beautiful.  Keep your Joe Millionaire, American Idol, played out Survivor, Bachelorette, Son of Bachelorette, and the Bachelor's Whore.  There is no better show on tv than Insomniac.  Here's the themesong:   AWWWW... Drunks and losers, Dwarves with limps, Flos and ho's and one-eyed pimps - Down the alleyway they creep. They're all your friends when you can't sleep.  Come with me and you will see. A late-night-freak-show-Jubilee! Kick the Sandman in his sack; Stay up late - Insomniac!    urlLink Hear it!

       Apologies for not replying sooner...   I didn't go to work yesterday. Apparently I missed a good Pandyland day. Duf, I really liked your message to the cookie people.  As far as calendars go, I have a "play with your food" one that is hilarious. It was a gift from 80 degrees (I believe we're supposed to refer to our friends via code names, and that is hers) and it also came with stickers, which I love. This month a strawberry is kissing some puckered-up piece of green produce (possibly ugli fruit?). I use the adorable fruit/veggie stickers to mark PTO days, and rubber ducky stickers (also a gift from 80 degrees) to mark the days I work out. Next month I am switching to shamrocks and leprechauns, and the month after I am switching to easter eggs and baby chicks. I need the motivation to get me to the gym.  I also have a perpetual postcard calendar, which was a gift from Hal. I love this calendar, but it does put a little pressure on my because it is displayed in a place where people walking by can see it, and if I don't change the date right away in the morning (every day!) I hear about it. People actually use it as their source for date information - which I don't recommend, because I cannot be counted on to change it every day.  I also used to have a Wells Fargo calendar in my cube, but I gave it to my honey because his calendar at home expired at the end of last year (imagine that). And our "trinkets and trash" vendor gave us all ceramic coasters with 2003 calendars on them, but I threw mine away because I thought it was tacky. It didn't fit with my desk's decor (most of the items, including my little green lamp which was a gift from Panda, came from my trip to Ikea with Hal and Panda several years ago). Finally, I have a little Kandinky calendar that was also a gift from Hal, but I cut off the calendar parts and just hung up the pictures.   My computer, office phone, cell phone and both of my watches also tell me the date. I track most of my appointments in Outlook though, but have a Clinique day-timer (given to my by my coworker, who got it as a free gift with her purchase and was going to throw it away) that I use for easy and portable reference.  And now, like Duf, I must go wash my hands.

      Duf, Thanks for the report and for doing your part for this great country.  Are there any cookies left?  I would like to taste them, even if they suck.  Maybe they should be the official Bad Cookie of Pandyland.  We should distribute them to drunk people at the PBJ2.  Or should we call it the PB&BJ??

      We just ate the Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies.  They are made by Biscomerica, and they suck.  I actually have an aftertaste that is still killing me even minutes later.  Anyway, I wrote the company via their web site.  I lied in my message.  This is what I wrote:  I just had a bag of Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies, and they were delicious.  I actually shared them with some co-workers (keeping my calories down, you know) and we all liked them a lot.  We had a disagreement about whether the hats were separate or if they just broke off from the Uncle Sam cookies.  Could you settle this for us?  I think that the hats come separately.  Also, and this is unrelated, but we were thinking that since America is one nation under God, it might be a good idea to do a line of religious cookies.  We thought you could incorporate some images of our Lord, like Jesus, sandles, fish, wine and a crucifix.  Just an idea.  Thanks and best wishes with your cookies.  Now more than ever we need to stay together as a country.    I will share the reply...stay tuned.

      I only have a boring office-type calendar in my cube.  It's very functional, but not fun at all.  The guy who sits next to me has a Far Side calendar, and sometimes he lets me read the funny ones, so that's cool.  I don't think Stoner has a calendar in her cube, otherwise she would know it's been FAR TOO LONG since we've had a substantial post from her.    Where's the love?

      DJS, stick to making jokes - you're pretty funny.  Duf, admit it, you're happier.  You've found the better path.  I have a U2 calendar here at the job (save your gasps of shock), and February is Adam month.  Thankfully they gave him the shortest month.  I wasn't bothered by it before, because this is the first week of the month that I've been in my cube.  But now that I'm on day 3 of staring at the bass man, I'm sick of it.  Thank goodness March is Edge month (I had to preview).  Speaking of work calendars, DJS is a Soprano.  I have a Missy Elliot song in my head.

       Hal has turned me into a freak!   Okay, I have a mildly obsessive complusive side, I admit that.  I even worry a little bit that it will get worse and worse as I get older and older until I am washing and washing my hands fifty times a day and re-alphabetizing and re-alphabetizing my CD over and over.    Anyway, Hal used to give me a hard time because I had a tendency to accumulate e-mails in my MS mail Inbox.  Sometimes I would have like 2200 items in my Inbox with 900 or so unread (let me explain here that I have preview so I can see the first few lines of e-mail messages without opening them.  So if I can glean the essence of the message without opening it, then I do/did).  Anyway, I finally swept my box clean, and now I am a freak about zeroing it out all the time.  It's unhealthy.  I live in fear that I will return to the dark days of multiple messages stacking up and stacking up and stacking up...until, finally, I am living in a house full of magazines and newspapers and spent fast food bags and junk mail and bulk food purchases from Sams Club so that finally I have to cut pathways just to get from room to room and the only thing in the house that is not dirty is the clean-ass sink where I wash my hands over and over and over until they are chapped and bleed justifying the medication I so clearly need (only to take it obsessively - twice a day, ten and ten, but after food, so I will have some bread before each one, but then I must toast it, but only slightly and no butter or margarine unless it's Friday).  Okay, gotta go arrange my sock drawer.

      DJS, thank you for eating the rest of the sausages...and taking them down.  Duf is so much cuter.  Duf, Shake ya ass! (But watch yourself.)  HAL, I can literally feel your pain.  On Valentine's Day, when the fella was making me dinner, I decided I'd warm up the dessert I brought over - a delicious, homemade apple crisp - in the oven.  Unfortunately for my arm, but fortunately for fella's entertainment, I attempted this after drinking an entire bottle of wine by myself.  (I had to do  something  while I was waiting for him to cook me tuna steak and pumpkin soup.)    Because I had hit a nice drunken stupor, I did not feel the hot, metal, oven rack scald my wrist.  I, too, have a nice mark to remember this by.  But I do not remember the pain.  I do remember laughing a lot, though.

       Gamey/2026/Bush Girl is President?..Carl Lewis, Jr. (adopted son) Wins Long Jump   Okay, I think that DJS, HAL and I should all sample them.  My only fear is that they will taste Canadian.  I like the syrup up there, but that is about it - Moose is too gamey.  If the cookies are born and baked in the USA, then they are probably nummy!  We will report our findings in a post later today.  Stay tuned.  HAL, um...I think you were supposed to learn to stay away from burners...oh...about 23 years ago.  I'm sure you did learn it then.  Is it possible that you are not dumb but just forgot?  Think of it this way, you are set until 2026.  I think that's an Olympic/Election year.

       Theme for next week:  Born (and-Baked) in the USA Land?   Our break room has Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies for sale in the vending machine.  They are just like animal crackers, only instead of a rhino, there is an Uncle Sam, instead of a Giraffe, there is an American Flag.  Don't get me wrong, I'm as patriotic as the next guy, but where love of country meets gettin' paid, I'm always a bit skeptical.

Me and the fella got tickets on Saturday for their Chicago show in June...DANCE FLOOR TICKETS.  RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE.  (BTW, we bought 4 tix - 2 are still up for grabs...get 'em while the gettin's good.)  I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it.

       A Short Commentary on Thongs: Pros & Cons   Pros:  1) Thongs are great if it's Saturday night and you feel like wearing that kicky pair of tight black pants and you want to avoid the dreaded "underwear line". (HAL, there's no way you're getting me to use the P-word.) 2) Guys love them...they just do.  Wear one, and certain guys may just buy you a car...or at least a bus pass.  Cons: 1) They are so fricking uncomfortable.  I don't care what certain girls say..."You just have to get used to them, and then you'll never even feel them!"  You people are liars, because I think I would no longer be human if I suddenly became "comfortable" with something lodged up my butt crack.  But Dirty may disagree - refer to his latest post. 2) Some girls always have them sticking out of their pants.  (Celebrity sightings: Britney and Christina) Two words, DJS: low class.  My coworker, Thong, has her's practically up to the middle of her back...what the hell is that?  Can she not feel it?  Once I actually commented: "Um, Thong, your underwear is sticking WAY out..."  (I've never been accused of having filters, you know.)  Her response?  "Oh, my red ones!  You like them?"  Are you kidding?  No, dumbass, I wasn't  complimenting  them, I was telling you you're a white trash whore.    How can I make this any clearer?

       1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.    Because somehow I think people want to read about the things I buy, people that piss me off, and movies that I hate/love.  Uh...people do want to hear that stuff, right?  Right?  Actually, my previous blog Soft Drink needed to be shut down because it caused a couple sets of moist eyes.  I miss my old blog, but love my guest-starring role here on Pandyland.  Yo, word is bond.    2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  A couple of 'em, I guess.  My asshole friend Dirty likes to read the whole site entry by entry then cite how boring we are.  He secretly wishes he was the 5th Pandylanda...  Sorry, Dirty.  No room.  I haven't subjected anyone else to our blog because of the ruckus I caused with Soft Drink.  Mayhap I'm a little blog-shy in getting others to read it.  Garsh...wouldn't want to upset any other big-nosed, alcoholic assholes.   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?    Sure.    4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??    I'm actually adapting all of our entries into a screenplay.  I'm going to pitch it in Tinseltown later this year.  The hardest part was trying to keep all of Panda's exploits down to a PG-13 rating.  Not an easy job, yo.  And I'm really trying to make HAL's character a bit more punchy.  Duf's motivation is somewhat questionable, too.  I've had early script-reviewers tell me he doesn't make a convincing protagonist.  I think the lovey-dovey feeling that Stoner's smitten character-in-love provides acts as a great balance to Panda's crazy Chicago-night escapades.  I'm not sure where I fit into all of this, but I'm hoping to write a car chase in for myself.  Hopefully I'll be able to have my character fire an Uzi out the window.  I've always wanted to do that.    5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.     I don't really have any favorites.  But here's a couple.   1.   urlLink Care For Something Dirty?   - My friend Abbot's alter-ego goes off the deep end from time to time to the delight of us all.  (Except Stoner)  2.     urlLink Goobita  - This girl is totally self-centered and a bit of an airhead, but I'm drawn to it like a fly to shit.  Okay...I admit it.  I think she's cute.  Not much else there, though.  3.   urlLink DNord  - The birth of my nickname was built by leaving jerky comments on his personal journal.  I used to work with this guy, and he figured out who I am, but that still didn't scare me away.  He acts like he knows more than he really does.  Totally boring, totally uninformed.  Again...I visit regularly.  4.   urlLink How I Got Published...(or tried anyway)  - A shameless plug for my blog/journal about my struggles to get my sorry ass published.  Not a very riveting read, but I've had some famous authors send me e-mails from reading some of my posts.  I use my REAL nickname on here, BTW.  5.   urlLink Moonshine's Live Journal  - Want to feel better about your life?  Read this Live Journal of an unemployed mother of two living in Minneapolis who has just about the worst luck of anyone I've ever come across.  A lot of posts about her daily life, but like a car wreck I'm strangely compelled to tune in and see what happens.  Nice person, but man...the fu%#ed up situations she finds herself in...  By the way.  This Friday 5?  Worst ever...

        I agree - today's Friday 5 is kind of a joke.     1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  I'm a frayed knot!   2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?   Lettuce in, it's cold out here!   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?   Orange you glad I didn't say banana?   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year?  To get to the other side.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs?   Kermit's finger!

        The “Friday 5” better improve…     1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  Peer pressure.   2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  I have a t-shirt with our URL written across the front.  I wear it everywhere, I think it’s helping get the word out.  Either that, or folks are just staring at my chest without going to the site.  That better not be the case.   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  Yes.  We’re egomaniacs who think that our thoughts and activities are of interest to others.   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??  North-northwest.  Hopefully we’ll make it to Alaska by August.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.?  I don’t read any other blogs – as touched on in #3, I’m pretty self-absorbed.

       Tellin it like it is: The Friday Five    1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  1) I get incredibly bored at work. 2) It's a good idea to keep in touch with the Twin Cities crew.  It's the only way HAL will continue to send me presents.  3) To meet new and interesting people: Duf & DJS - who woulda thunk I could love ya so darn much?!?     2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  Most of the people I tell about it look at me funny or forget the address, so they never read it anyway.  My parents definitely don't know...mom would be sorely disappointed in her angelic daughter.  I would never again tell anyone I'm dating about it...how could I give y'all the dish otherwise?   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  1) Bono 24-7-365; 2) Time to get our drink on.   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??  I definitely think we should continue to add embarrassing photos of our members...I'll be sure to bring my camera to Minneapolis in March.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.?  I only have 3: I found  urlLink this one  randomly, but it has some interesting perspectives.  Hate Wal-Mart? (Or your job/coworkers in general?) Then you'll love  urlLink this . Not as much a blog, as a diary of  urlLink adventures in bowling .

       Disclaimer/Friday Five, yos:   Disclaimer:  Per my bro (and he know, yo, he know) we are not a blog.  He is going to tell me what we are, but we are not a blog.  Answer like we are tho.   1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  Reason one:  Like a good enema, journaling and blogging is good for purging the system.  Ahhhhh...I feel better already.  Reason two:  blogging helps me feel connected to Stoner.  Reason three:  I'm not in the business of defying Anne.  You feelin' me?   2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  My bro know, wifey know, no one else know tho. I dunno.

      I know I've put  urlLink this link  up before, but I just looked at it again today and it made me laugh out loud.  Plus, it wastes some time reading it...time where I could actually be doing some work.  Slow, slow day, Pandylanders.  DJS - I have to wait until I go home to hear/see that link - no speakers here.

      I'm pleased to present one of the funniest links in the world.  If you've got sound, I guarantee you won't be able to get this song out of your head.  It's THAT catchy.   urlLink Kikkoman Commercial.    Panda  - You'll love it for what happens to the little cartoon cat.  HAL  - You'll love the flexing.  Stoner  - You'll enjoy the theme of happiness throughout.  Maybe.  Duf  - You'll like the brief uuuhhhhzzzzshhh scene.  (and yes, it's safe for work...no hot caution needed)   All I gotta say is:  The Japanese make some weird commericals.

      I just bought tickets to see Tori Amos in Madison and I'm psyched.  I'm a bit of a spaz about her and own most of her albums, but have  never  seen her live.  And going with someone who likes her  almost  as much as I do will make the experience of seeing her truly great.  Why is it that a shared love of a particular band/artist can always draw people together?  Or maybe it's just me.

      DJS, I thought your Dukes of Hazard/Peanuts reference was very poetic.    Speaking of family that lives in excessive proximity… my mother comes from a very large family - she was lucky # 13 of the 13 kids my grandparents had.  Her family spent their summers at a house on a lake.  Somewhere between then and now her siblings all found a way to really, really not like each other (I don’t like to say “hate”).  Not to the tune of death threats, but definitely to the tune of lawsuits and other similarly bad behavior.  To illustrate – a few months ago I was asked (in writing) whether or not I would like to sue one of my cousins.  The letter was from one of my uncles (via his attorney), and the entire episode was absolutely non-surprising to me.  I actually took it as a “welcome to the family”-type gesture.   Alright, so back to this lake in western Minnesota where my mother grew up – I swear that ½ the houses on this lake belong to either one of my mother’s siblings, or one of their children (or one of my mother’s cousins, or one of their children).  I go back there and I am continually amazed that all these people who don’t like each other choose to live on top of each other – at a second home, no less!  I mean, it’s a nice spot and all, but there are 10,000 lakes in this great state – why not venture out and make a few new enemies?  And to get into the reason that still visit said lake gets into truly “Dynasty”/”Peyton Place” territory.  Besides, you get the point.  So I’m all for a little distance with family.  On an entirely different note, I saw  urlLink this movie  this weekend with Stoner.  It was very feel-good, and chock full of girl-power.  I highly recommend it if you like any of those things.  Or if you like soccer.   Sorry, Duf, I have yet to see  urlLink this , but I hope to soon...  Happy Monday, Pandyz.

      Having spent the past weekend in a small town, I can safely say this: I enjoy the scenery of a small town, but there's no way in Christ Jesus's name our Lord, amen will I ever live in one.  DJ LZ's sister and bro-in-law moved to a small, small town south of the cities where he's planning on opening a landscaping business.  They got the opportunity to buy his uncle's house and live there for cheaper.  Newer house...big, out in the country.  Oh, but there's a catch or two:   1.  Grandma lives on the property too.  Her house, and I'm not shitting you, is 50 yards away.  If you're bumpin' uglies and the windows are open, ol' granny is going to see all of the action.   Not only does Gramma live close-by, their next closest neighbors are the bro-in-law's parents!  Further down?  Yep, you guessed it...another uncle.  Hey I love my family as much as the next guy, but there's no way I'm living in their goddamn backyard.   2.  Dirt driveway.  It's a regular Dukes of Hazzard thing going on.  I guess concrete is too darn expensive, so they'll just pull the General Lee up and hop out through the windows.  Like DJ LZ, her sister is a bit of a neat freak.  Good luck with that...everytime someone pulls up to the house, it's going to look like Pig Pen from the Peanuts Gang bumrushed the place.   3.  Local bar: The Town Pump.  I'm not kidding.  We popped in for a beer and there were signs hung strategically near the doors that read: 'Anyone fighting will be ejected for 30 days.'  That's nice.  Since there aren't a whole lot of people who can frequent the place, they can't really kick anyone out for good.  It's kind of like a penalty box for country hicks.

      Direct quote from Thong after she got back from the bathroom:  "Whoo-wee!  Thank God, the oatmeal finally kicked in!"  That's perfect.  Exactly what I needed to hear on a Friday afternoon.  I'm leaving shortly to take a quick roadtrip to 'Sconie.  (DJS, I know how much you like that term.)  A little Tori, Old Style, and re-living the college days on State Street.    As you can see, I'm not that complex.

      I think I have a lot of complexities, but I don’t think that there are “two types of people in this world”.  Therefore, none of us are “either/or”.  If you need to label me, I’m complex.  But here’s my rundown on Duf’s list:  1.  I am low maintenance.  For those of you that scoff at this, go on a camping trip (or another comparable activity) with me and then tell me your answer.  2.  I am not a genius.  3.  I don’t need a lot for fulfillment.  I have no 5 year (or 1 year, or 25 year) plan.  If you asked me what my goals are in life, I would struggle to answer - not because I don’t know what I want, but just because I really don’t want much.  I cannot recall any time in my life where I have felt "unfulfilled", "empty", or anything of the like.  4.  I’m left brain (though not extreme left brain).  5.  I rarely if ever see more in words/actions then speaker intends.  In English class when they would say that the red scarf represented life or hunger, I never saw that.  I wouldn’t even remember the red scarf.  Same thing about foreshadowing, I was like, “huh?”  It’s the same reaction I would have after watching “Dawson’s Creek” and someone would say, “I think Joey and Pacey are going to get together because of what he said at the hot dog stand”, and I would be say “oh yeah, I really liked the shoes that Joey was wearing in that scene!”  6.  I highly enjoy subtlety and nuance (so here’s is one of my complex features).  When the red scarf was discussed, I was always like, “ahhhhh…. that’s pretty cool”.  But then I would wonder if the poor author just happened to mention the color of the scarf with no motive, and now it’s being dissected in English classes for all eternity (again, making me complex).  When Joey and Pacey got together, I really liked seeing the repeats to see the (now obvious to me) hints that they were a far better couple than Joey and Dawson.  7.  I absolutely believe that all people are good (making me not complex).  But I also believe that everyone has good and bad “in” them (making me complex).  8.  I have idiosyncrasies and pet peeves.  But not more than the next gal.  9.  I’ve had my nicks, but I’m not high on the trauma scale.  That said, some of my complexities definitely arise from specific points (even moments) in my life, as do all of us.  10. I don’t have a lot of passions, but those that I do have, I’m very passionate about. (dunno if this makes me c or nc)  11. I accept people as they are.  I don’t think that there is any right way to go about life.  I also believe very strongly that you cannot change another person (and that’s a good thing).  12. I like to rotate between the island vacation and the city vacation, but I do lean towards the city vacation.  Something with historical significance is preferred.  Or involving a kick-ass concert.  13. There are no absolutes in life.  Except death and taxes, of course.

      Shouldn't over-analyzing your own nuances while trying to determine whether or not you're complex automatically make you complex?

       The Friday One  By Duf Fer  I have one question for you.   Are you complex or not complex?   Here are some things to think about while answering.  1.	Erase any pejorative connotations of “complex.” Being complex or not complex is neither good nor bad, it just is.  2.	No one factor is, in and of itself, determinative unless is EXTREME.  3.	Complex is different from high maintenance, but if you are really high maintenance, that may suggest something about whether you are complex.  4.	Intelligence is, in most instances, not a factor.  However, there is a level of genius that per se qualifies someone as complex (see, e.g. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Vincent Van Gogh).  Similarly, there is a point at which low intelligence would qualify someone as not complex.  For most people, intelligence is non-determinative.  5.	Probably the factor that drives your status more than anything else is how much is required in order for you to be fulfilled.  If a lot is required, then you tend toward complex.  If not much is required, then you are not complex.    6.	Are you right brain (creative) dominant or left brain (analytical) dominant?  Being right brain dominant increases the likelihood that you are complex.  Being left brain dominant, increases the likelihood that you are not complex.  7.	Do you tend to see more in words and actions than the speaker or actor intends?  If so, then there is an increased chance that you are complex.    8.	Do you like subtlety and nuance?  If so, then you tend toward complex.  If you prefer and respond better to the direct, then you tend toward being not complex.    9.	Which of these statements do you most agree with?  “People are basically good” (not complex).  “People are basically good, but their systems and devices elevate pathos within the group making those systems and devices inherently corrupt and therefore evil” (tending toward complex).  “People are basically evil” (complex).  10.	Do you have a lot of idiosyncrasies and pet peeves?  If so, then you tend toward complex.  11.	If you have a history of “issues” or trauma and those issues or that trauma defines you more than it should, then you tend toward complex.    12.	If you have a lot of passions, hobbies, pursuits…if you are a renaissance person, then you tend toward the complex.   13.	If you tend to accept people as they are and take a happy go lucky approach to life, then you tend toward not complex.    14.	If you had to choose one vacation over another (all things being equal – in other words, you are not vacationing to reduce stress or mourn a loss, you are just taking a vacation), which would you choose?  I would choose an island vacation with lots of r and r (not complex). I would choose an urban vacation with much to offer by way of sight-seeing and activities (complex).  15.	Last, if you think most of life’s moral and ethical questions can be met with a “right” or “wrong”/”good” or “bad” answer, then you tend toward complex.    For a perfect example of complex and not complex, see the film “Personal Velocity” and focus on the second story featuring Parker Posey (complex) and her husband (not complex).  Okay, so, I talked to Hal and DJS about this yesterday, and they are probably  well sick  of it.  Last night, I told my mother-in-law that she was complex but her children and husband were not complex.  She did not hit me by the way.  I asked my wife if I am complex or not complex, and she did not hesitate to say I was not complex (based on factors 5 and 13, BTW).  After thinking about it, I would agree with her and say that  I am not complex , but just barely.

       Bitch Session   Normally, when I'm finally back home in Chicago, I'm in a great mood.  Not today.  In addition to DJS overriding my post (no hard feelings, friend...I just thought I'd tease you), I've had my head slammed into the ground a few times today. (not literally)   1)  Another ass-backwards view from my company: it's more effective and cost-efficient for me to travel to NY and spend thousands of dollars a month to get trained, than for someone within our NY office to learn how to use our web teaching tool. This takes approximately 5 minutes to learn...I know because I've used it before with our clients.  I just don't get it.  Here's the direct quote I got from the head of L&D:  "I just spoke with the trainer and she has no experience with Webex. Since the trainer is inexperienced and the room is not set up, we won't be able to accommodate Panda virtually. Please let me know if you have any questions. We're sorry it didn't work out."  Yeah, I have a question.  Why is your intellectual equivalent a box of rocks?   2)  I don't understand why boys need to keep explaining themselves and asking "why?" when you've already told them "I'll call you if I change my mind."  One word: pathetic.  At least I have a date tonight...and we're going to my favorite place on earth - Medieval Times.  Horses, jousting, and bad food should get me out of this funk.  If not, then I guess we'll  have to resort to a Cuban restaurant.

       What is your first childhood memory?  I remember my mother coming into my room to wake me up, opening my drapes (it’s very bright outside) and telling me “You’re going to have your picture taken today”.  Then we go to the JcPenney’s portrait gallery and a middle-aged man with a mustache (it was the ‘70s, folks) and brown hair is taking my picture, taking care to pose my arm on the fake branch/log prop thing.  I was 3.  When I look at those pictures today, I have a déjà vu feeling.  I wonder what happened to that photographer...   Do you have a favorite piece of clothing? Discuss.   I have a story to go with every purse, pair of shoes, and coat that I own.  And I might just lay down in traffic for a few of those items.  But I have little attachment to my actual clothing (i.e. jeans, sweaters, t-shirts and the like).   Any weird morning rituals? (non-sexual in nature please...)   They’re all sexual in nature, so I’ll just say that I don’t pay my rent in cash and leave it at that.  Don't judge me.

       First memory:  When I was four, my family went to California. At the beach, a plane flew over. My older brother told me it was the plane I was supposed to take – he said they were all going home on a different one, and I was going to have to stay in California by myself forever.   Favorite clothing:  I have a wide variety of favorites – one in each genre, whether it’s sweaters, jeans, t-shirts, long-sleeved t-shirts, underwear, etc. I’m pretty much always wearing one of my favorites – today, I’m wearing my favorite socks.    Morning ritual:  As a general rule, I drive to work in a high-stress, emergency manner every morning. If I am driving from my honey’s residence, I even put on makeup in my car. Dangerous, I know – but it saves 10 minutes and I only do it at stoplights. From my residence, I drive on the shoulder and cut ahead of traffic. Again, it’s dangerous. I know. And even with all of this high-speed driving and other risky business, I am still typically 15 minutes late for work.

       What is your first childhood memory?   I remember being in a small green house, sitting in a high chair next to my twin bro in a high chair waiting for toast.  I have no clue how old I was.   Do you have a favorite piece of clothing? Discuss.   I have a green sweatshirt with an embroidered golfer on it that my ex-girlfriend's parents gave me.  It is comfortable and it reminds me of golf.  I also have this pair of tiger printed thong underwear that I like a lot:  grrrrrrrrrrrrr (hear me roar)!   Any weird morning rituals? (non-sexual in nature please...)   I pretend to sleep while I peek at Mrs. Duf in the buf while she is getting dressed for work.  I read (usually poetry) in the bathroom.  This morning, I finished "In Cold Blood" while sitting naked atop our kitschy, green carpeted toilet bowl cover waiting for Tiny E to wake up (it didn't take long).    Panda, please answer again.

       DJS: The Thursday Three    What is your first childhood memory?  My first childhood memory (no doubt aided by the super 8 films my parents took at the time) was me peering in at my baby brother Dr. Rob PHD in his crib.  I was just a little over two and I was extremely fascinated by the little bastard.  I would just watch him sleep in his crib and poke him from time to time if I wanted to see him do something.  I didn't go through the 'I'm jealous of the baby' phase.  No sir.  I just wanted him to grow up so that we could play with cars and Legos and such.   Do you have a favorite piece of clothing?  Discuss.  Yes I do.  I've got this old gray fleece sweatshirt that I wear all of the time.  It's a J. Crew (don't hate, it was my first) and I don't think I'll ever find a more functional piece of clothing ever.  It's great for when it's cold and I just need something to throw on real quick in the winters.  Spring and fall I use it for my famous cargo shorts/sweatshirt ensembles, but in summer I gotta put it away.  It's like a ritual.  Me to sweatshirt:  I'll see you in two months, friend.    Any weird morning rituals? (non-sexual in nature please...)  I don't know if this is considered a ritual, or even sexual, but I do it anyway.  Since DJ LZ gets up a good 45 minutes before me, she showers first.  Even though I'm dead tired and not ready to wake up, I try to sneak a peek at her from under the covers while she's getting dressed.  I do this every morning.  A little nudity in the morning is just the thing to make me feel refreshed and ready to face the day.  My ritual, of course, is ruined if she decides to get dressed in our walk-in closet while she's picking out what to wear.  What can I say?  I don't tire of seeing her in the buff.    Note: That's a good thing.

       Two Olives for a Great American   My favorite Senator of all time (yes, even more than Wellstone and even more than Lyndon Johnson), Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, died yesterday.  He was a gentleman, a scholar, and a man who could not be defined by party affiliations (he was a central figure in the Kennedy administration  and  in the Nixon administration for crying out loud).  He wrote 18 books and cared passionately about issues of race, ethnicity and class.  I bet that Panda and I both would find much to admire in his policies (now that's crossover).    When I was an intern in Washington (pause for Monica Lewinsky joke), there were a handful of people that I always wanted to see.  I was there during the Bush administration (pause for second Monica Lewinsky joke) and there were all these famous politicians that I always got a charge out of seeing.  Ted Kennedy was one.  John Kerry was another.  Lowell Weicker, the great Connecticut maverick, was still another (should I have been born in the Northeast?).  The President, of course.  There were others, but none topped Senator Moynihan.  I would sometimes go to finance committee meetings to hear him speak.  I even visited the Senate floor a couple of times to catch his remarks on some piece of legislation or another.  He was the kind of Senator I would want to be if I were one:  an intellectual, independent, a man of ideas and history, a supremely witty wordsmith quick with a bon mot, but perhaps most of all, a man you would want to knock back drinks with.  DPM was a martini drinker, so today, knock one back in his honor.  Make mine with two olives, please.

      Sorry, friends.  I have little to say about Oprah.  I think she is neither Jesus nor the devil.  I also have no personal anecdotes regarding her.  However, I do have something else to share.  I try to keep my news sources somewhat diverse, and in surfing various online news outlets, I always like to check out the "most emailed" stories to see what people are interested in/interested in sharing.  On ABC's news site, apparently people are not too worked up about the conflict in the middle east.  Based on the fact that it's the #1 emailed story on that site, they are more worried about  urlLink cooties .  But who isn't?

       On a Side Note: Don't Forget Stedman   Stedman Graham has been Oprah's "steady" for years now.  He's a community leader but will never get the kind of credit Oprah gets because he's not on TV (although you'd think sleeping with her would give him  a bit more  press...).  And he's generally a pretty nice guy.  I saw him once on one of my flights to NY.  I recognized him (since I live in Chicago, I probably see him more in the news than others might).  No one else even noticed the poor sap.  He was sitting in COACH -  behind  little old me!  Finally, one of the stewardesses realized who he was and quickly led him up to First Class.  Now, I usually think the people in First Class are major snobs (I've only been there twice - I hoard my upgrades), but you'd think a guy who has his hands on Oprah's loot would have said something.  But he didn't...and he looked  really  embarrassed to be "escorted" up there.    I think any guy that can stand in the type of shadows a woman like Oprah casts deserves mucho credit and accolades.  The only "friend of a friend" stories I have about Oprah are: 1) My coworker Thong works out at the same health club Oprah belongs to.  She says she sees her there from time to time and without her make-up she looks AWFUL.  Thong claims she never went up to her for an autograph, but I was once out with Thong in NY when we ran into Queen Latifah at a steak joint.  Not only did she go up to the Queen herself (while buzzed, no less), but she also said “what’s happenin’ sistah?”  I thought I’d die of embarrassment.  So maybe I can’t trust Thong. 2) A former coworker of mine once saw her walking her dogs off of Michigan Ave...again, no make-up.  Absolutely hideous.

       My Oprah Experience by Duf Fer   Once, I was in Chicago visiting a friend.  The friend is rich. His parents have a really boss pad in a fashionable building on the Gold Coast.  They are part owners of the Chicago White Sox. They have plenty of cash.  As I was walking into the building, I came out of the revolving doors and bumped into, literally, Oprah.    I would pay money to see the look on my face.  My immediate reaction was to say excuse me.  I bumped into someone.  My just as immediate second reaction was to realize who I bumped.  Just as immediately as that, I exclaimed "oh my God!"  She laughed and said "no problem" and gave me what I would call a genuine smile.  I have seen her show maybe 5 times in my life.  It seems to be classy and thoughtful, even as it is slick and, perhaps, insincere.    Two things in reply, DJS.  First, I have a friend whose mom was shopping at a posh grocery store in Connecticut and happened to see a very famous man.  We will call him PN.  She went up to him and said "I'm a big fan" or "Can I have an autograph?" or some such thing that fans say.  PN said "get the fuck away from me": hostile words in a hostile tone.  I can only imagine that I am one of thousands of people who have heard about it either directly or indirectly.  So, PN had a really bad moment.  PN is probably a flaming asshole.  But, there are times when it makes me wonder about the burdens of celebrity.  Myself, I would not want to rich, powerful or famous.  But, if I had to avoid one, without a doubt, I would avoid fame.  What a curse. Oprah has all three.  Second, I'm not sure I blame Oprah for her popularity.  She is the consummate Capitalist, no doubt about it.  She is all about the dollar that's clear.  We used to debate the merits and demerits of her book club at Barnes and Noble all the time.  I think, in general, we all concluded that she got people to buy good books and read them (two good things).  I can say with certainty that she was surprised by the popularity of her book club.  I don't know that it is her fault though.  I also think that, as you get to know Jonathan Franzen (and "The Corrections" is phenomenal BTW) you will realize that in the jerk Olympics, he would easily lap Oprah, and then flip off the crowd as he accepted his gold medal.    But I have to admit I am an Oprah apologist.  I like powerful women in general (I even admire Martha Stewart though I have never seen her show or read her magazine, and even though I am troubled by the insider trading scandal when I was in high school, I had a Geraldine Ferraro thing that woud not quit - I can admit that among friends, right?), and I tend to root for the success of AfAms in general.  Having said that, I know there is probably much about her that is worthy of criticism.  I just wanted to say that there is much about her that is worthy of praise too.  Last, I have a friend who has a friend who worked for Oprah for years. The friend told my friend (who told me) that Oprah is very hard to work for (very demanding, very particular, a perfectionist and often uncivil), but also very generous and supportive, and, in a strange way, one to cultivate a (dysfunctional, yes) family atmosphere at Harpo productions.

       Why I Hate Oprah by DJ Shovelpants   Yes, America loves them some Oprah.  Me?  I think she's the biggest phony this side of my left ass cheek.  The following are some things about the self-important ego-maniac that drive me to drink.   Oprah is a nice person.   Absolutely false.  She treats everyone as though they are peasants and is about as nice as having a rousing case of apocalyptic stomach cancer.  My father, who is now a retired police captain had to organize security for Dirty ol' Winfrey when she was in town some years back.  Since he was one of the top dogs, he had to escort her in her limo to the site of her appearance and he said that he'd never seen anything like her.  She was nothing but rude to the people who worked for her and had a nasty snarl on her face during the entire 'backstage' experience.  Only when she was out on stage and talking to her league of followers did she bother to smile.  My dad said it was like jekyl and hyde.  'One minute she was acting like a total 'c___' (a phrase he never uses, btw) and the next, she's acting like she's on the same level with the people that paid money to see her,' father DJ reported.  'Plus,' he added.  'She's got a head like a goddamn medicine ball.  Huge.'   But Oprah gives gifts to her viewers!   Yeah, and so does Santa Claus.  Look, any half-wit can see the game that's running during her 'I Want To Pamper My Guests' shows.  You think ol' fatty wallet Winfrey is actually shelling out dough to give 'thousands of dollars worth of items' away...just out of the kindness of her heart?  Think again!  All of this stuff that she's giving away is donated from the companies.  It's called 'plugging.'  When you think you're watching Oprah really 'giving something back' take a closer look.  You're watching an Oprah informercial!  Yeah, it's great to get deluxe apricot face scrub and a bath robe woven from the hair of 3 year olds, but don't think for a second that you're seeing Oprah's generosity first hand.  The people providing the 'gifts' are lining her swollen pockets with more money.  Why?  Because her followers think that if Oprah likes something...it's gotta be good.  Which brings me to...   Oprah's Got a Book Club!   Don't even get me started on this.  There's just something sinister about Oprah 'reading' a book and then turning around to tell her followers to read it and...guess what?  It's a huge bestseller.  No one person should have this kind of influence over a large mass of people.  The only other person I can think of that was able to brainwash people was a German fellow...named HITLER!  Okay, so I exaggerate, but the plain truth is: yes, some of the books that are part of her club are good.  Admittedly there are even some that I plan to read...but I think Jonathan Franzen did the right thing when he told Oprah to go ahead and leave him out of the book club.  Good for him!  I wouldn't want her stupid logo emblazoned on my book (if I ever get published) either.  Thanks but no thanks, Oprah.  I'll let the work speak for itself.  Way to go, Johnny.   But She's So Down To Earth...   Yeah, sure...and Charleton Heston isn't a gun-toting drooling idiot.  It bothers me to no end that she's got a magazine (sorry, Stoner).  Why?  I'm guessing she has very little to do with it other than use her 'mind-altering power and name' to sell copies and to show up every month to have her picture on the cover.  Yuck!  To me, the magazine is merely another vehicle for her 'brainwashed fans' to pick up and scour the pages so that they can find out what their television girlfriend thinks they should buy or how they should dress or whatever.  Sweet Jesus!  Think for yourself, people.  And the whole thing with her phony face being on the cover of every issue...yeah, I don't detect any inflated ego there.  Nope...none at all.   But, but...  I realize she does some good.  Yes, she donates lots of money to charities and all that stuff.  That's fine.  She's gotten people who haven't picked up a book since high school to read her 'selections.'  Great.  But she's also unleashed that tyrant Dr. Phil on the rest of us.  Well, guess what?  I don't buy half of the stuff this asshole spouts on about and I don't like the look of his potato head.  I don't think you'll see armies of men following Dr. Philbert's every word and buying the Dr. Phil magazine if (and god forbid) it should ever come out.  I know a lot of Oprah's fan feel a sense of 'belonging' to her club or group of fans, but trust me when I say this: the bottom line is the dollar dollar dollar bill y'all.  She's not your friend.  Oprah wouldn't touch you to scratch you...unless it's going to increase her ratings or line her XXL pockets with cold hard cash.

       While We're On Oprah...   I know DJS is an unapologetic Oprah hater, but I kind of like her.  She is well-dressed, articulate and rich!  Also, her show, when considered next to Jennie Jones and Maury and bald-ass Montel and Jerry (a consummate entertainer), is nothing but class.  Now, that Dr. Phil...I'm no fan of his!  I'll southern accent you!

       All I have to say is...   I'd better get my Oprah Magazine soon, or there is going to be HELL TO PAY! I'm serious. I've been checking the mailbox for weeks, and still haven't gotten it.  As far as the 2sday 2 goes, I second Hal's emotions. Top Gun all the way, purely because of Iceman. And Mystic Pizza, well, because I had a crush on the guy that Kat kisses (even if she is the babysitter and he is the dad).

       Nice work, Duf.  I like the q’s!!    What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie? Why?   Gotta be ”Top Gun”.  And no, I’m not a gay man.  I still laugh every time Iceman snaps his jaw at Mav.  Other faves include “Rain Man” (takes me back to New Years Day 2000, aka The Day Stoner Almost Died) and “Jerry McGuire” (though it has caused far too much personal pain amongst several of my friends), I also thought he was great in “Magnolia” – one of the few times he’s shown us his sense of humor.  I’d also like to make note of his work in “A Few Good Men” – a great example of the mysterious seductive powers of a cocky sonovabitch (I am normally immune to Tom Cruise - I like men taller than 5'2").    What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie? Why?  “Mystic Pizza”.  HANDS DOWN (“I know what you are!!  A hustler!!”, “It’s the shit, Steam, don’t eat it”).  And I agree with Panda, Lili Taylor is great in it.  And what I wouldn’t give for that soundtrack!  Second place goes to “Pretty Woman” – a far guiltier pleasure than “MP”, but we’re all friends here (“This ain’t a buffet, Kit!”).

        What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie?  Why?   That's a tough one.  I haven't seen many Tommy Cruise movies that I haven't liked.  I'm with Duf on this one.  He's vastly under-appreciated and he really knows how to pick roles.  I did get pissed at him for a while for choosing similiar roles/vehicles.  "Days of Thunder" was "Top Gun" on wheels down to the put-on-the-brakes-so-we-can-get-the-upper-hand move.  But if I were to pick just one, I'd have to go with "Cocktail."  Yes it was cheesy.  Yes it was just a plain ol' dumb movie, but it reminds me of my days as an Usher at Apache 6 theatres.  I had it timed so I could 'check' the theatre during the waterfall scene.  Elizabeth Shue.  Delish!  Plus, who can resist the killer soundtrack (Kokomo, Don't Worry Be Happy) and how they flip all those bottles around?     Close favorites:  Born on the Fourth of July, MI:2, Jerry McGuire    What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie?  Why?   Oh...you mean 'Horse-Faced Julia Roberts?'  Easy.  "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" which was a horseshit film.  Why is it my favorite?  Because she gets killed in the movie.  Sorry if I ruined it, but I've actually saved you some time and money.  Seriously.  Spend your money on something else.  You can thank me later.

       It's Tuesday    What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie? Why?   My fave is probably  The Outsiders , although more because I like the book than the film.  Plus, Tommy was so cute and young - his face was so smooth & shiny! (I'm not saying I like young boys, but...)  A close second is  Far and Away .  I'm a sucker for a good romantic film, sans comedy. Tom and Nic sizzle.   What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie? Why?   Mystic Pizza  - one of Hal's guilty pleasures, but my favorite Julia movie.  She made this movie before she thought she was God's gift, and that innocence and humbleness comes through in her character.  I also have a fascination with Lili Taylor.

       2sday 2, y'all!  (If You Hate The Actor, You Can Pick the Movie You Dislike Least)/ With Props to Hal Who Gave Me the Idea at the Mall of America and May Not Even Know She Did It/Note, the Question is MOVIE, and not ROLE, but You Can Pick Role If You Want To - Who Knew the 2 Would Be So Complicated?    What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie?  Why?  Although I really liked "Rainman" and "Mission Impossible 2" and especially "Eyes Wide Shut," my favorite Tom Cruise movie (drum roll please) is "The Color of Money" hands down.  By the way, I think Tom Cruise is simultaneously overrated and under-appreciated.  I really liked the movie.  I thought he did a great job, and Paul Newman was at the height of his powers (the much maligned Marty Scorsese was brilliant).    What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie?  Why?  Ocean's Eleven surprised me.  I thought it was pretty darn good, actually.  I also would give props to "Everyone Says I Love You" and "Pret-a-Porter."  But, without a doubt, the best movie Julia Roberts has been in (hands down, nothing else even comes close) is "The Player."  Not only is it my second favorite Altman movie, but it is one of my all-time favorites.  It's almost cheating to pick her here because she is barely in it, but... you know the rules!

       Lullaby in Birdland   With  Lullaby in Birdland  being one of my favorite tunes sung by some of the greats: the jazz vocal group Manhattan Transfer, Mel Torme, Ella Fitzgerald...  I always wondered what and where Birdland was exactly.  My question was answered  urlLink last night .  I took my parents there to have dinner and see a great 16-piece jazz orchestra: The Toshiko Akiyoshi Orchestra with Lew Tabackin.  Toshiko (the quirkiest Japanese lady EVER) and Lew (a very quiet, introspective man with a white, white beard and killer jazz chops) are married.   And man, can they make music together.  If you're ever in the Big Apple, Birdland is not to be missed. As Charlie Parker once put it - "The Jazz Corner of the World."    Out of sight!

       Ow. (Not aow!)   I was hungover today too - plus generally feeling gross after eating brownies and cookies and hummus and pita and chips and cheese and lime chips and baked cheesy chips and bread and artichoke dip.   I think there was more excess going on in our apartment than at the Oscars themselves.

       Hoops, Nothing but Hoops!   Speaking of war, I say we bomb the people who put the Academy Awards on opposite NCAA basketball.  How are we supposed to be patriotic when the two most American things ever (March Madness and Oscar Madness) are in conflict?  When will the President take action against this evil that is perpetrated against his own people?  I missed the Academy Awards (in its entirety) because I have basketball fever.    If lovin' hoops is wrong, I don't wanna be right!  Oh, one other thing.  Catherine Zeta Jones is  not  carrying my love child.  Please respect her privacy and the "sanctity" of her marriage by not contibuting to the furtherance of that  ugly ,  ugly  rumor.    Thanks in advance,  Duf

       Gangs Of... No Oscars   Personally, I was glad to see Gangs of New York take home ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  And if that included omitting U2 from the Oscar winners, then so be it. (and let's face it, U2 has done much better work than that limp song)  Everyone was SOOO sure than Danny Day Lewis was going to win and that Maury Scorsese was a lock for best director.  Sorry friends...'twas not to be.  Even though I was a little disappointed that Nicole Kidman won something and that Chicago hogged some awards it didn't deserve, it made me feel somewhat vindicated that Gangs of New Zzzzzzzzzz didn't win a damn thing.  It almost makes me feel like I know what I'm talking about.

      I am hungover.  I was in denial about it when I first woke up ("I'll feel better after a shower"), but as the day progresses, my eyelids are heavier, and I am fighting the urge to crawl under my desk where it's quiet and dark, and if I throw up it will be less obvious.  I didn't really over-do it last night, it's more that I mixed things up.  A lesson you think I would've learned when I was 16 - if you're drinking beer, just stick to it.  Don't play the hero and down a mixed drink and then some cider and then back to beer.  The drinking definitely intensified when U2 lost (*sniff, sniff*) their oscar to the flash-in-the-pan Eminem.  So I'm blaming him.

       Duf, I would never kick you out.   Here at Pandyland, we are free to express ourselves.  We are free to use profanity and voice our opinions on everything from movies to phone manners to the best place to karaoke.  Duf, I may be Republican, but I also agree with a lot of your views on politics (in this case, war - particularly point 3 under "Here's the thing") as well as your favorite comfort foods.  My father fought in Vietnam and doesn't talk about it, but I see him get sad when people are not supporting our troops. However, I have never heard him say these people don't have a right to say what they want.  Rant on, friend.

       Explosion Avoidance/My Longest Rant Ever (PB, don't kick me out)   Sometimes, I feel like I will explode if I don't write something.  Today, what's stuck in my craw is  urlLink this.   Here's why:  1.   "Put an end  to the spoiled, disrespectful, ungrateful pro-peacers who don't know the meaning of sacrifice."  How should we put an end to them?  Oh, I have an idea: we can use all the electric chairs and gas chambers that are under-utilized in America (that's sarcasm BTW).  Just so I'm clear, is this man really suggesting that we kill Americans who don't "support the troops"?  2.  There is a sign that says France Sucks.  I could write a book on what bugs me about that, but I will try to be brief.  First, the government of France does not support this war.  The French people are divided on it (like the people of all nations of the world).  The country of France (its people) is different from the government of France.  That's why we are targeting this war at the government of Iraq and not at the country of Iraq and certainly not at the Iraqi people.  It is possible to oppose the government but not the whole country.  What is the value of all this hatred of France?  Second, France was acting on what it believed.  They have an obligation to do so, just as we do.  Third, I'm not sure France is wrong.  It is difficult to argue that diplomatic measures were exhausted before the bombing began.  U.N. Resolution 1441 clearly does not authorize this action and requires a second resolution to sanction the use of force.  The inability of the U.S. to secure U.N. Security Council approval for this effort is not the fault of France (recognize that we have the responsibility for making a case for war - and we failed to do it; recognize further that France was not the only country that planned to veto the Security Council Resolution - should we hate Russia too?  Should we hate everyone who disagrees with us?  Should I hate the man who hates people who love peace?  Where does all this hate leave us?  What would Jesus do?).    3.  I don't even know what to write about the Freedom chainsaw.  I really don't.  I have thought about it all morning, and I still don't have any coherent thought in response.  People trouble me is about all I can come up with.  Here's the thing:  1.  I support our troops.  I also feel really sorry for them.   2.  I suspect our fighting men and women know that this war is not entirely on the up and up.  Troops during Operation Desert Storm talked about "why they were there" all the time.  They were open in their speculation about whether the war was about oil.  Troops in Vietnam were candid about the impropriety of American involvement there.  Our soldiers know more than most Americans that it is almost impossible to make a case that Saddam should be removed while allowing other regimes to remain in power (see my fourth point below).   3.  Questioning the war does not mean failing to support our troops (perhaps this is so basic and so easy that it escapes people's minds).  It is possible to hate the war and love the soldier.  In many ways, love of soldier compels us to question and challenge war.  4.  The men and women fighting in Iraq are  not  protecting  our  freedom.  While one may argue that Iraq is a threat to the U.S.  Only strained reasoning would allow that argument to hold any water.  First, Iraq has no weaponry capable of reaching the United States.  Their missile range is not only capped at a few hundred miles, but also so grossly inaccurate that the missiles, even if they could fly the several thousand miles to the U.S., would be more likely to hit Baghdad than Boston.  Second, let's be honest, Iraq's main threat is to Israel.  Our men and women are more involved to protect Israel than the U.S.  Third, Iraq's minimal weaponry is significantly less threatening to the U.S. than the nuclear weapons possessed by countries like Pakistan, Iran, Libya, North Korea (recently awakened by sloppy foreign policy), Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.  If we are really interested in  protecting our freedom  by eliminating possession of weapons of mass destruction by unstable regimes, then what the hell are we doing in Iraq?  If we were to rank direct threats to the security of the U.S., I'm not even sure Iraq would make the top twenty (even if you factor in terrorism - the C.I.A. all but admitted that there is no connection between Iraq and Al Queda).     5.  I will bet anyone $100 that our troops come back with some kind of syndrome or another.  (Let history be your teacher here:  there are the effects of Agent Orange exposure to our Vietnam era veterans (finally admitted after a few decades of U.S. government denial); and there is the currently denied Gulf War Syndrome).  I will add to the bet that Iraqi war veterans will be under-supported by the government, that they will find little financial assistance for necessary medical care and that they will be directed to woefully over-crowded and horribly under-funded VA hospitals.  I bet that, to the extent that their effects include mental instability and violent behavior, they will meet with little or no understanding from our criminal justice system.  Last, I bet that many of the folks who attended weekend rallies in support of our troops will either:  a) remain silent when soldiers return and need our support; b) vote for tax cuts that further undermine the ability of agencies charged with supporting veterans to actually provided meaningful support; or c) both.     6.  The essence of democracy is freedom.  One of the freedoms we are supposed to value as citizens in a democracy (I'll save my arguments on why we are not a democracy for later) is the freedom of speech (this is so basic that the inability to understand it shocks and frightens me).  The freedom of speech defends and supports the right of the citizenry to express their opinion. It is not limited to voices that support the government (and perhaps has most value in dissent).  We have a long line of famous dissenters in the United States.  Abraham Lincoln was a prominent in his opposition to the Spanish-American war.  Richard Nixon campaigned on getting our troops out of Vietnam  even while soldiers were there fighting .  If we take away dissent, we are not free.   7.  The illogic of claiming to support troops who are fighting for our freedom and seeking to silence those who exercise freedom in dissent is so visceral and so removed from reason that it depresses me.    How can something so basic be so little understood?

       Bored at Work, Why Not.    1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be?  Bono.  I think I would weep.      2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?   I’m pretty content with this century, although I think everything (including movies, music, commercials, magazines, TV shows) is way too oversexed.  I’m no prude, but what happened to mystery or intrigue?  Britney Spears exposes her underwear for the world to see.  Kids are getting the wrong ideas.  Ricki Lake makes me sick.  Times Square is filled with 100-feet-tall pictures of half naked men and women.  If I could pick a  decade  to grow up in, it would be the late 50’s/early 60’s. Things seemed to have been simpler…people had different (perhaps better) values…quality was more important than quantity…hope was there…no one knew what AIDS was…”mixers” weren’t geeky…people visited or called instead of e-mailed…girls wore pink.     3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?    Having done a bit of international travel, if I lived anywhere other than the US, I think I would really miss my creature comforts.  I took baths for 4 months straight when I lived in London, and let me tell you, I was dying for a “power shower” after just a week.  Soaking in your own filth is not that romantic.  Plus, I really like central air and dislike bugs. Otherwise I’d live in Thailand.  Living on a tropical island may sound nice, but I would definitely get sunburned.  Yep, I’m sticking to the US of A.   4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?  Kelly Kapowski because she was the head cheerleader and got to date Zack Morris.    5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?  Gwenyth Paltrow – her face can light up a room.

       Some Random Happenings  by Panda  On Friday we went out for King Crab Legs.  They were delicious.  Tonja kicked everyone’s ass in darts.  I got in a fight with someone at the juke box (again).  On Saturday I kissed a boy.  He was delicious.  Tonja wanted to kick someone’s ass.  I did not get in a fight at the juke box, but was told I smelled nice by someone who was sitting next to it.  Yesterday afternoon my parents and I went to  42nd Street .  Bo from  Dukes of Hazzard  was in it.  He sang and danced deliciously.  Then we had sushi.  My parents are not used to raw fish because no one eats that in Wisconsin (unless it’s pickled herring on a Ritz).

       Friday5 Is Still Alive (check back next week, yo)    1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be?    This question is always so hard for me.  There are so many different reasons to meet people.  For golf, I would pick Tiger Woods, Jesper Parnevik and Meg Mallon.  Philosophically, I would want to meet Jesus, Martin Luther or Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Politically, I would love to meet Jimmy Carter, Winston Churchill, Woodrow Wilson or Saddam Hussein (I would at least TRY to reason with the man).  Artistically, I would want to meet Glenn Gould, Jimmy Hendrix, John Updike, Richard Ford or the poets A.R. Ammons and Galway Kinnell.   For dinner, I would want to meet Gertrude Stein, Big Ernie Hemingway (pig on a spit?), Malcolm X and Bill Clinton.  Romantically, I would want to meet Audrey Hepburn (circa 1960), Amanda Plummer (don’t ask) Anjelica Huston, Ariana Huffington, Halle Berry, Parker Posey, Bjork, Condolezza Rice or Faye Dunaway (circa 1960).   But, with only one choice, the person I would most like to meet would be Krzystzof Kieslowski the Polish film director.   2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?    This may be lame or boring (how could it be more boring than my last answer, I know, I know, but wait), but, as an AfAm, I definitely would not go backwards.  I also feel that, overall, we get worse globally with each passing year.  I am a bit of a Luddite and I think technology makes us worse, not better.  So, I would pick the present century.     3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?   I would move to Scandinavia or Canada.  I am politically more in line with folks there, and I think that in terms of quality of life, they are on par with or better than America (unless you count culture and food).  But I would hate to move.  I am proud to be an American, and I feel really lucky to be born here instead of many other places.     4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?    Easy, Atticus Finch from “To Kill A Mockingbird.”   5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?   Tyson, the Ralph Lauren model.

        A Little Better...The Friday 5 Presented in DJS Stereo     1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be?  I'd like to meet my great great grandpa, the guy who is the reason I have the middle name I've got.  He looked like a interesting old guy who wore bib overalls, had a dog named Tippy and spent hours and hours whittling pieces of wood into chains and fans and other useless items.  I've got an old newspaper article that he was featured in and he didn't even bother to look up at the camera, he's just sitting in his old chair, Tippy at his feet, working his pocket knife into the wood.  Before the big battle my family endured at the hands of my e-vil grandma, my parents secured me a relic from my great grandpa's past.  It's an old wind-up watch some girlfriend gave him back in the olden days.  So cool.  The amazing thing is, it still works.   2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?  Future.  Definitely future.  I'd be too afraid to go into the past a la Marty McFly and wreck too much shit in the present.   Plus, I'm all about technology.  I want to ride in cars that'll fold up into my suitcase, and had a robot maid picking up after me.  Plus, not having to cook when you want a delicious meal?  Sign me up for that.   3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?  It would be home.  I'm tired of being at work.   4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?  Indiana Jones...no wait, Darth Vader, no...scratch that...I'd want to be Gollum.  Er, on second thought...how about Oprah?  That way I'd throw myself off of a bridge and do the world a favor.   5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?  Probably George Clooney's.  I was going to say Sloth from 'The Goonies' but I figured that would get old real quick.

       They Shouldn't Outta Done That!   Politically, I am about as liberal as you can get without being a socialist (don't kick me off, Panda).  I have my misgivings about this war against Iraq.  I won't get into all that here.  I think that flag burning, as a form of expression should be allowed (even as I regard it as both repugnant and over-used).  I won't get into all that here either.  Having said all that,  urlLink this  really bugs me.

       1.  If you could be in any branch of the military, which would you choose and why?  I’d be in the Coast Guard, just to smite any political ambitions.   2.  What are your comfort foods/guilty pleasures?  I have lots of both.  Name the comfort food, and I love it.  The only exception to that truth is frosting.  A lot of people like to eat frosting, except me.  My guilty pleasures usually involve television or movies.  I’m kinda a sucker for “7th Heaven”, tho I haven’t seen it in a long time.  Regarding movies, well… Mystic Pizza, Reality Bites, and The Sure Thing all rank as my faves.  But since they are also excellent movies, I’m not embarrassed.  Really.   3.  The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny. Discuss.  I think that all underwear (within reason) is beautiful.  Though I also feel that your undergarments are not to be seen by the general populace (I, in fact, thought that this was the whole idea behind u-trou).  It baffles me as to why thongs make non-thong wearers so damn angry.  Besides, anything that rids the world of "VPL", or "Visible Panty Lines" is a great thing.

       DJ Shovelpant's Thursday 3    If you could be in any branch of the military, which would you choose and why?  Navy.  I'd like to be a Navy Seal.  You know, do all the sneaky-ass stuff you see in movies.  'DJS, we need you to parachute in, slit this guy's throat and get the secret microfiche.'   Done and done.  Plus, they get all the cool gadgets long before any of the regular grunts get their hands on the technology.   My only fear is that it might be like when I steal a ream of paper here at the office... I'd be tempted to make off with the infrared binoculars or the armor-piercing howitzer shoulder cannon.  Imagine that...a whole group of Navy Seals after my ass for stealing from the office.  But yeah, Navy Seal.  If you're going to kill...kill in style.   What are your comfort foods/guilty pleasures?  Mini Chips Ahoy cookies.  Don't ask me why smaller and portable cookies taste better to me.  They just do, okay?  I also like them caramel flavored icecream Drumsticks treats.  You know the ones.  Peanuts on top, a swirl of delicious caramel inside the cone.  Mmmm....delicious.  I'm also in compliance with PB and Duf on the doughnut thing.  I need 'em like a hole in the head, but who can resist a hot Krispy Kreme fresh out the box?  Not this DJ...   The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny. Discuss.  I think they're delicious.  May I refer you to Halle Berry's appearance in  'Bulworth'  for further proof?  Ay chihuahua.  I guess it boils down to this: if you've got a decent dumper and you feel like displaying it, go for it.  But...use some tact.

      Thurs3:  1. I would be in the branch that translates top-secret intelligence. In a safe, secure building. I don't want any risk of getting killed, but I am kind of interested to see what intelligence reads like.  2. I love to bake chocolate chip cookies - especially if I am feeling blue. Not to eat all of the dough, just to feel better. Baking makes me feel like I am at home, whether I am at home or not. Sometimes I'm at home and I need to feel even more at home (you know?) and that does the trick. I don't have a ton of guilty pleasures (I express my love for Justin Timberlake and Oprah Magazine with pride) but the other day I took a bubble bath and THEN went to the gym, which felt like a guilty pleasure because I took the bath knowing full well that I intended to sweat and then shower again later on. But I looooove the bubble baths.  3. I am anti-thong. I try to avoid having stuff up my butt whenever possible.

       PB's Thursday 3    If you could be in any branch of the military, which would you choose and why?  When I was 17 and a senior in high school, I went through about a month-long phase where I wanted to join the Marines.  I went on and on about this...I remember vividly.  I was enamored with the uniforms, the challenge, the extreme toughness, the yelling, the fact that most Marines are sick-in-the-head.  When my brother caught wind of my plans, he laughed his ass off, especially because at the time I was about 90 pounds and nowhere close to as tough as I am now.  (I'll kick your ass if you disagree.)  He then challenged me to do 50 push-ups in a row.  I could not do it.  So I changed my mind.    But, to answer the question, I still dream about being a Marine, so that's the branch I would choose now.   What are your comfort foods/guilty pleasures?  I'm with Duf on the donut thing: I love getting 2 Boston Cremes from Dunkin' Donuts (Double Down with the Double D, Hal.).  Especially because I love hearing the Indian guy with his THICK Indian accent say "Yes maam, 2 Boston Cremes." And I like classic, just out of the fryer Krispy Kremes.  I also adore Mac & Cheese.  My guilty pleasure is to read the latest copy of US magazine on my plane rides to and from NYC.  Sometimes I hide it in a copy of Business 2.0 or Smithsonian (sounds like pervy Saddam) just because I am always on business flights and am afraid my fellow passengers will think I'm an airhead.  I can't get enough of the celebrity gossip.  I need serious help.   The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny. Discuss.  I have discussed the pros and cons of thongs in a previous post.  I work with a girl named Thong who bugs the crap out of me.  I'm through with this topic.

       Thursday3 (in the place to be...ya heard me?); 3 Totally Unrelated Questions:    If you could be in any branch of the military, which would you choose and why?  I would either choose the Navy or the Air Force.  Probably the Air Force and here's why (I'm totally serious BTW).  I   HATE   mud.  I can't stand it.  If I was knee deep in the shit, like in 'Nam or something, I would need for it to be dry dirt.  I can't walk around in mud.  It makes me have to pee.  In Saigon, I would be a killing machine.  In the jungle, surrounded by mud, I would be worthless ("hold on a second guys, I have to pee pee").  Once, up in the boundary waters, I was portaging with a canoe on my back, and sank past my knee in slippery, slippery mud.  I was so unhappy.  So very, very unhappy.     What are your comfort foods/guilty pleasures?  French fries and donuts are my weaknesses.  Oh how I wish it were not so.     The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny.  Discuss.  I disagree.  I'm totally against it when it is not discrete.  The problem with the thong movement is that folks seem to have this need to flaunt the thong.  Folks that wear a thong with low cut jeans and a bare midriff so you can see the thong?  They are  so  wrong.  That should be illegal.  If people wear a thong and it's not known that they are wearing a thong, I think that's wonderful.    Also, being a non-thong guy, I wonder also if they aren't uncomfortable.

       Clean to Very Clean  By Gunnery Sargeant First Class Duf Fer  We probably should not go public with this (for national security reasons), but since we have a very small readership and code names and all, we should be fine.    Okay, here goes.  DJS and I are special ops operatives for a national agency (unnamed for national security reasons).  If you notice that our number of posts goes down, it's because we are in the "shit" over in the Middle East killing "the madman of Baghdad" or taking out select members of Iraq's Republican Guard.    For example, earlier today, we got word that Saddam (correct pronounciation rhymes with "Madam" or "Adam") was at the Best Buy in Bloomington.  When we got there, it turns out it he was at the Bruegger's Bagel Bakery.  So we went there, and they said he was at the Borders Bookstore.  We found him in the magazine section trying to hide behind a copy of "Juggs" that he stuffed inside the "Harvard Business Review" so that we would not know he was a smutter.  Anyway, it turns out this perv was just some Saddam look-a-like.  But, to be safe, we exterminated the target with extreme prejudice using our typical surgical precision:  it was a clean to very clean hit.  Most shoppers were unaware that there was an assassination during their noon hour.    Just doing our part...

      Today Mr. Shovelpants gifted me two great Clash posters (someone was going to toss them!!).  Since they were indentical, and Duf was coveting them, I gave one to him.  It's the little things in life.  The little things.  BTW, Panda - I hope I don't get too sauced up at your party on the 5th.  I can be a little loose-lipped under said circumstances, and considering your plans this weekend, it could get ugly.  That's all I'm saying.

       Close to wartime in NYC.   People are starting to get a little nervous around here.  My boss is convinced the war is going to start at exactly 8pm.  I plan on being at Macy's at about that time, trying on swimsuits.  If they force us to evacuate, everyone on Broadway is going to see my bare ass...or at least me looking pretty uncomfortable in a two piece.

       We live in a cynical world, yes we do...   Overheard on the elevator today:  "But I was really looking forward to watching the war on TV tonight...".  Yes, she was joking, but damn, we're jaded folks.  I went out to grab lunch today (sorry, Duf), and outside of Bruegger's there was a pickup truck that took up two spaces.  Not that it was too wide (well, it was pretty wide, but not wide enough to spill into the next spot), but rather that it was too long and it took up two spaces the long way.  It upset me.  If your vehicle is unable to fit in a standard parking space, please don't drive it.  Better yet, just never buy a vehicle if it has to take up two spaces in the lot.  Thanks.

       1. If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be? Why?    Call me crazy, but I wouldn't want to be famous.  Rich wouldn't be too bad, but famous?  Nah.  Now, before you scream at me and say it's just hypothetical, and just for one day, I'll play along and say I'd be J.LO so that I could be the soon-to-be Mrs. Affleck for a day.  But I wouldn't want to be in public, or have to sing any of my crappy songs or be in any of my crappy videos, or act in my crappy movies, anything like that.  If Benny breaks up with Jenny before my chance to be her for a day, no thanks.  If not J.LO, I wouldn't mind being First Lady for a day, because, let's face it, that's a pretty sweet job.  But I don't see myself married to Dubya.   2. What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?    If Santana dies tomorrow, no mourning from Hal.

       1. If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be? Why?    This totally just popped into my head, but it makes perfect sense:  J. Lo .  Here's why: 1. I could finally have gorgeous, dark, glowing skin...even if just for one day. 2. I could spend gobbs of money on ridiculous things. 3. I could drive a Bentley. 4. I could diss P. Diddy...big time. 5. I could kiss Benny Affleck all day long. 6. It would be a-ok for me to have a protruding boo-tay...and I'd shake it.  7. I could make a music video with L.L. Cool J.  I would tell him the one-pant-leg-up look is O-U-T.  8. I could speak fluent Spanish. 9. I'd be keeping it real, since I  am  from the Block, yo.   2. What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?    Anything by a generic crap band that's on a top forty station.  Some examples: Lifehouse, Vertical Horizon, Sister Hazel, Third Eye Blind, Matchbox 20, etc, etc.  These bands are so damn forgettable, and their music all sounds the same.  Blah!

       Tuesday Two, y'all, Tuesday Two, y'all.  Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday Two y'all!    1. If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be? Why?    That's easy.  I would be Tiger Woods.  My hope that one day would be long enough for me to pick up some things from his golf swing and groove them into my muscle memory.  I could also know what it feels like to hit a ball 300+ yards and have people stare at me adoringly.   2. What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?    For me it's a four-way tie:  Anything by Meatloaf (although he is rarely on the radio anymore), anything by the Violent Femmes (please die "Blister in the Sun", please - it was great the first million times I heard it, and now I absolutely cannot stand it at all, not even a little bit and don't get me started on "Do you like American Music?"  Arrrggghhh!).  That one song by the Suburbs that they play here too much...(when will it die?)...and that is similar to this one other song I destest by the Meat Puppets ("Johnny loves Janie, Janie love Paul womp, womp, womp, womp....).  It's horrible.  Horrible.  I'm upset just thinking about it.  Ick.  Meatloaf fans, let me feel ya'.

       The Tuesday 2! Presented by DJS    1.    If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be?  Why?   I think I'd want to see what a day in the life of J.K. Rowling would be like.  Since she's the most popular author in the world, it might be somewhat interesting to see what she does in one day.  That way, I can feel better (or worse) about myself for not even getting published yet, let alone being a sliver as successful as she is with her kids books.  Maybe it'll put things into perspective, you know?  Well...probably not.   2.    What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?   That's easy: Dave Matthews Band.  The lamest, shit, frat-rock music ever.  If you like listening to DMB...then I'm sorry, I can't be your friend anymore.

      Sorry for the lack of posts lately.  I can explain...   1.  We're having a bagel bowling bonanza tournament here in the office today.  Since I invented the game, I'm more or less running things.  Speaking of which, the finals are in a few minutes...  If you haven't done this in your office, you should.  It's a friggin' blast.   2.  I got Photoshop 7.  As evidenced by my appearance at the Hindenburg explosion, I've been spending a lot of time learning how to make it work.  Yeah, I'm not a full-on computer nerd yet...give it time.   3.  Nothing really exciting has been going on.  Really.  Once spring has hit us full on, maybe there will be some interesting stuff to blog about, but not much is new under the sun.   4.  I've been busy putting up the valence in the kitchen.  If you're ever in Woodbury and would like to see it (the valence, I mean) let me know.  It's beautiful.   5.   Friday Five?  No time.

      Call me lazy, but I would prefer a Friday 2. I know that's not alliterative, but five questions is just too much commitment.   How 'bout we do a Tuesday Two and then a Thursday Three? That would be more manageable, and we'd have all five questions done a whole day early!  Of course, we would have to write our own - but they wouldn't be half as lame, I'm sure.

       1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?   I would kill a good, kind and gentle man if it cut my phone time in half.     2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?   The Star Tribune called me; they want me to up my service.  I said "how did you get my work number?" then hung up.  Was that rude?   3. About how many telephones do you have at home?   Two cordless; two cell. (Don't hate).   4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?   I used to work for a U.S.S. who is a great guy and is now a Washington player.  When he was done talking, he would just hang up.  No hate intended, but rude city baby.  I said nothing to him about it (hello, I was an intern), but others worked on him a great deal.   5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?   I would rather e-mail.  Although, sometimes the phone call cannot be replaced - people don't always understand your mood and meaning in writing.  The Friday Five is about to get kicked to the kurb.  We may have to make our own if they don't shape up really quick like.

       I love the good old U.S. of A., but Not More than Booze and Snacks   During lunch, DJS and I had salad with lots of freedom dressing (it is the best, the tangy flavor the artificial orange color).  Anyway, we had an argument over whether it is wrong to freedom kiss on the second date (he said no - but he's kind of slutty).  I said yes...no freedom kissing until the third of fourth date.  Later, we discussed the merits of the freedom cut bikini.    Okay, that was sarcastic.  All I am saying is this:  without french fries and vodka, my life is dimished significantly.  So, if France and Russia veto U.N. Resolution 1441 and the patriotic thing to do is ban all things Russian or French, then I'm going to be one brie eatin', fry snackin', vodka drinkin', unpatriotic so and so.

       Are you ready for the WEEKEND?  How about this lame-o Friday Five.   BTW, there are no rules this weekend except ONE: What goes on in the Twin Cities  stays  in the Twin Cities.  That's all I'm sayin'.   1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?  I like talking on the phone if I have juicy gossip or to plan an event for the weekend.  I usually don't call people just to chat.  Bor-ing.   2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?  Kellie - we're excited to get the hell out of dodge and head to God's Country.   3. About how many telephones do you have at home?  One cordless, one cell.  Whatever.   4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?  I absolutely hate people with call-waiting.  When someone says "Hey, can I get this other call?" that basically means "You're not important enough for me to talk to".  I don't ever use the call waiting I have on my cell phone, and I don't have it on my cordless at home.  If someone really needs to get a hold of me and he/she hears a busy signal or gets my voice-mail, the person can call back or leave a message.  C'mon people!   5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?  Depends on the situation.  If I'm dumping a guy, I try to call and let him off easy - it's the least I can do.  But Kellie likes to e-mail guys her "Dear John" letters...she's a bitch like that.

       Why I hate hotel gyms.   I kind of have a little ritual when I'm in NY, particularly when I have no plans in the evening.  I usually try to walk back to my hotel (about a 40-block hike), go to a deli for sushi or the salad bar, order a cheesy romantic comedy on my TV that I'd never pay for with my own money, watch it, and then at about 9pm I'll go to the hotel gym.  I go late because I hate working out when the gym is crowded.    So I was all alone two nights ago, until this short, stocky guy came in to ruin my workout time.  I was on the treadmill, minding my own business and listening to Coldplay (of course), and this guy starts up the treadmill right next to mine.  He had it going the fastest speed possible, and kind of gave me a look like "check  this  out."  I was not impressed.  He was running his little heart out, with me continuing my walk at a normal brisk pace.  I guess I didn't give him enough positive feedback, because he then proceeded to raise the incline.  I swear, I think his treadmill was almost at 90 degrees at one point.  By this time he was completely staring me down, wondering why I wasn't giving him a round of applause.  This totally wigged me out, so I just left.  Then last night, I went down at the same time, started my workout, and who showed up  again ...weirdo runner guy.  He gave me the stare down again, this time with a sly smile and wink that said "I'm blatantly hitting on you"...so then I blatantly went back to my room.  Telling a guy like this off is usually no use.  But if I see him again next week, I'm going to punch him in the neck, or at least give him a piece of my mind.  And since I have longer strides than him, I'll run him into the ground for sure.

      I miss you all fiercely (mostly Panda...and well DJS...and especially Stoner...and even Hal (who is with me in Columbus, Ohio...I miss her because she is different on Pandyland.  We are all different.  We can be free.  We can write whatever we want.  We don't have to wear clothes while we blog (although we really should sit on towels) and we can curse).  I will give my five update later.  I have to go train a Chase processor right quick like.

       THE WEDNESDAY FIVE by DJS, yo.    1. What was the last song you heard?   You've Been Flirting Again  by Bjork It's an acoustic version I got on a bootleg CD.  Rumor has it, the Swan Princess is planning a North American tour (no dates set yet).  I've already decided that I'll go wherever I have to, just to see her again.  Can someone say ROADTRIP?  Or CYBERFARE, at least.   2. What were the last two movies you saw?   Old School  - A comedy classic.  I don't know who I think is funnier: Will Farrell or Vince Vaughn.  Both of them are comedic geniuses who are extremely good at what they do.  If I were to cite a favorite moment, it would have to be when Will is shot with the tranquilizer dart and he's lying in a heap beneath some chairs at a kid's birthday party.  The best part is, he doesn't want to stay down and he gets up with a slow-mo groan.  Insert laughs here.   The Good Girl  - I've seen it already, but I bought it off of my brother for $10 on DVD.  I think the movie is sheer comedy genius.  Maybe a bit unbelievable, but then again: why see a movie if you expect it to be believable all the time?  I usually don't like Jenny Aniston, but she was pretty good in this flicky-poo.   3. What were the last three things you purchased?  - A burrito from Chipotle for lunch yesterday.  Need I say more?  Mmmm....delicious. - Everclear's new album - Slow Motion Daydream.  I think I'm one of the few people on the planet that still really like these guys.  I'm going to see them in concert at First Avenue in a couple of weeks.  I can hardly wait. - Laundry detergent.  DJ LZ said we were low on the stuff, so I got it when I bought my CD.  Two jugs of Surf, comin' up!      4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  - Begin editing my 2nd book.  Yucka. - Shop for paint and such.  We're going to paint our last room.  The big 'un. - Install two lights in our upstairs hallway. - Work out a schedule where I can: write, read, workout, learn how to play guitar, play video games, and get everything else done.   5. Who are the last five people you talked to?   Jeremy the German  - The IT guy who is repsonsible for installing the time-consuming yet fun Photoshop on my PC.  If there's been a lack of posts from me, blame the good people at Adobe.  It's tre fun.  Terri the Mexi-Canadian  - She's my neighbor at work across the aisle from me.  Amazingly, she's shown up for work everyday this week.  Then again, it IS only Wednesday.  Liz the Caucasian  - The supervisor for the CCS team delivered two delicious roast beef sandwiches to my cube, no C.O.D. required.  I guess I'll catch her on the flipside or something.  I offered to cut a check.  Offer refused.  Cim the Irish(?)  - She's out today because her little guy is sick.  I'm not sure if she's Irish or what, but her hair is reddish and it IS almost St. Patrick's day.  Mike the Fat Blob of Shit  - He waddled by and asked if Cim was out today.  I told him she was.  See above.  (I don't think we have any Jews working here.)

      Because I took a sick day on Friday I almost forgot...   THE FRIDAY/MONDAY/TUESDAY FIVE, by Panda.    1. What was the last song you heard?   God Put a Smile Upon Your Face  by Coldplay I'm really excited to see this band again this summer...I've been listening to this album a lot...not as much as Hal, though.   2. What were the last two movies you saw?   The Safety of Objects : Excellent.  Cool twist at the end. Tremendous cast - including the hottie drug dealer guy from the movie  Go .  Plus Joshua Jackson (Dawson's Creek cutie) plays a paralyzed guy.  That's weird.  All the Real Girls : Sweet movie, sad ending...you'll cry your eyes out if you have ever been in love.  Hell, you'll cry your eyes out anyway.  Paul Schneider is the next big thing.  You heard it here first.   3. What were the last three things you purchased?  Oatmeal w/banana at "Sushi Deli Flowers" this morning here in NY.  Salad and a pack of gum at "Terry's" for lunch.  I guess that's 3 things, albeit boring.  I plan on going shopping after work today (I can't pass Sephora in Times Square without twitching) so there will be more things added to this list later.     4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  Drink, shop, laugh, and...drink.   5. Who are the last five people you talked to?  Suketu (sits next to me) My lady boss (she's a high-maintenance Jewess - I swear, she is always eating) My man boss (he's a wimpy little fella - wrote a haiku about him once) Myself (I think people are looking at me funny...) The Fella (he makes me smile and likes to cook stuff for me - next meal: Vegetable Biryani, an Indian delight!)

      Stoner,  HAL and I had a little discussion last night.  We will go somewhere other than Half Time under 2 conditions:  1) You get down on your knees (this was HAL's idea).  2) And you utter 5 simple words....    "GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE."    It's that simple.

      Friends,  I'm in agreement with Ms. Stoner.  I'm all about the good times, so I'd like to avoid a high-volume crowd if possible.  If it gets to the point that we can't even move or talk to each other, fun times will not be had by all.  Tis' true that EVERY bar is an Irish bar on St. Pat's day.  As for singing, I'm down with that.  I'm just going to hope that a couple of you kids will rock the mic as well.  What's the worst that can happen?  And yes...I think burritos are in order for PBJ2.  Mo' definitely.

      I'm not so hot on the Half Time idea...I know, Irish and all, but every bar is Irish when it's St. Patrick's Day. I want to go somewhere with karaoke, so I can see DJS perform again.

      Stoner, I talked to HAL on Saturday and this is what I know:  Friday: You are taking us out to dinner. (You're just leading, not paying - no worries!)  Then HAL is meeting up with us when she gets in.  Girl's night - ow!  Saturday: PBJ2!  HAL suggested Half Time.  I don't care, as long as there's beer.

      All:  Is PBJ2 on Saturday night? I'm assuming it is, due to the traveling agendas of most of the Pandyland crew. I also have a perhaps more important question - is there going to be karaoke? A jig off rematch? Burritos?  Please send deets as they arrive.  Thanks, Stoner  p.s. Sorry Duf, but I am not posting the new cell number. I've gotten enough strange phone calls.

       1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?   I read fiction 99% of the time, but I like non-fiction and poetry too.    2. What is your favorite novel?  It is almost impossible for me to answer that question.  I have so many favorites (ask HAL).  But, if I had to pick one book, I would pick  Moby Dick .    3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Why Regret By Galway Kinnell  Didn't you like the way the ants help the peony globes open by eating off the glue? Weren't you cheered to see the ironworkers sitting on an I-beam dangling from a cable, in a row, like starlings, eating lunch, maybe baloney on white with flourescent mustard? Wasn't it a revelation to waggle from the estuary all the way up the river, the pirle, the kill, the run, the brook, the beck, the sike gone dry, to the shock of a spring? Didn't you almost shiver, hearing the book lice clicking their sexual syncopation inside the old Webster's  New International  - perhaps having just eating out of it  izle, xyster  and  thalassacon ? What did you imagine lay in store anyway at the end of a world whose sub-substance is ooze, gleet, birdlime, slime, mucus, muck? Don't worry about becoming emaciated - think of the wren and how little flesh is needed to make a song. Didn't it seem somehow familiar when the nymph split open and the magfly struggled free and flew and perched and then its own back split open and the imago, the true adult, somersaulted out backwards and took flight toward the swarm, mouth-parts vestigial alimentary canal unfit to digest food, a day or hour left to find the desired one? Or when Cassonova threw the linguine in squid ink out the window, telling his startled companion, "The perfected lover does not eat." As a child didn't you find it calming to think  of the pinworms as some kind of tiny batons giving cadence to the squeezes and releases around the downward march of debris? Didn't you once glimpse what seemed your own inner blazonry in the monarchs, wobbling  and gliding, in desire, in the middle air? Weren't you reassured at the thought that these flimsy, hinged beings might navigate their way to Mexico by the flair of the dead bodies of ancestors who fell in the same migration a year ago? Isn't it worth missing whatever joy you might have dreamed, to wake in the night and find you and your beloved are holding hands in your sleep?  [please don't sue me, Galway]   4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  The great works of Russian Literature.  Up next:   The Brothers Karamazov  and  War and Peace .  Yep, Duf' is serious.    5. What are you currently reading?   The Body Artist  by Don Delillo. Up next:  rereading  Lonesome Dove  by Larry McMurtry.

      Wow, Stoner.  That's a weird and creepy story.  Good luck with that new number.  So I've been doing some field research on an oddly fascinating phenomena:   Golden Tee games are almost always right next to the jukebox in a bar.   And this gets me in trouble...mostly because of another fact I've uncovered:   Guys who play Golden Tee are total chachis and have no hope of ever sleeping with a woman.   Last night I was at a local tavern, enjoying some free beers because one of my friends won a free happy hour.  (cha-ching!)  Of course, I made a bee-line to the jukebox in order to dominate the song choices for the evening.  As usual, there were a few frat-boy chachis gathered 'round Golden Tee.  They were all giving each other high fives and other such frat guy behavior.  I was just ignoring them, and picking my usual song favorites.  Then one of these guys decides to be a smart ass and rips on one of my choices...it happened to be a U2 song.    He had no idea what he got himself into.  Even while sober I probably would have let him have it, but since I had a few cocktails by that time, it was no holds barred.  "Hmmm, thanks for sharing your fine opinion on music with me.  Sorry I'm not as cool as you and didn't pick some lame-ass Dave Matthews song.  Oh, and by the way, you've just proved my theory.  Guys who play Golden Tee really don't have a penis.  Thanks!"  Needless to say, he was pissed, but didn't bother me for the rest of the night.  Stupid, stupid boy.

       I had to change my cell phone number today.    Since I got it in late December, I’ve gotten about two “no number” calls a day – they never leave messages. I assumed it would taper off as people realized that I’m not the person they’re looking for. Twice, I’ve gotten messages from the parents of a girl named Amber, asking her to call home. I don’t know the number for home, so can’t call them back to tell them I’m not Amber.   After my vacation, I had a message from a woman named Sharon. She didn’t give me the reason for her call, she just sounded very professional and left an 800 number. I thought my finances were in trouble or something, because she works for some sort of bank. When I spoke with her, she said she found my number in her husband’s wallet. He’s a trucker, and she knows he’s been messing around with hookers – and she assumed I was one of them. We cleared up the confusion when I said I get calls for a guy named Dan and a girl named Amber – apparently the scrap of paper in her hubbie’s wallet said Amber on it.   The last straw, though, came last night. I got a creepy voicemail in a heavily-accented male’s voice that just said “I know who you are…” I decided I didn’t want to know who he was. So I switched it.   I wonder who had my new number last? Hopefully, not another hooker…

       I have no self control when it comes to chocolate.    All day long I’ve been trying not to eat it – not because I gave it up or anything, but because I eat entirely too much of it. I’ve been scarfing it down on a daily basis since about a month prior to Halloween. Here, the candy stream never stops.   Right now there’s a whole bunch of FastBreak and KitKat and Almond Joy and other wonderfully delicious mini candy bars, all about 10 feet away from me. Every time I turn around I can see it. The only time I don’t think about the bag o’ chocolate is when I am in a meeting, behind a closed door and distracted by the topic at hand. B  ut now it is 4 pm and my other coworkers are going home, and that means I am going to be alone with the bag. After 4 pm is when it gets the worst. I start to get hungry for dinner, and the mini candy bars sound better and better.   If I have to use the fax machine, I’m screwed. It’s right next to the bag. How can I hold myself back?

      Thanks Hal.  I feel much better.  So I've been thinking about what I should "give up" during the Lenten season.  This is a lot of pressure - I mean, I already have to stop eating meat on Fridays, and then there's the whole Easter Vigil thing on Holy Saturday which is just about the longest mass in existence.  When I still sang in the Cathedral choir, this was the Big One...the one we all dreaded because it meant we had to stand for 3 hours straight.  And we didn't get to stand in the choir loft in back, but smack dab in the front, in front of the entire congregation, sweating to death and feeling like we're all gonna faint.  So, yes, Lent is a lot about sacrifice (considering everything JC did on the cross and all), but why does it have to be?  Instead of "giving something up", I'm going to try and be a better person...at least for 40 days.  How am I going to do that?  Well, I'll start by buying all my friends in Minneapolis a round when I'm in town next week.  And then I'll try not to yell at old ladies in the bus anymore.  And then for the finale, I will make sure to (try) and keep my mouth shut when I see someone dressed like a slut.  It's the least I can do.  In other news, if anyone has been keeping score: Mike Walsh of  urlLink "Bowling Roadtrip"  fame, has finished bowling in all 50 states.  He is also the first person in history to have ever bowled in Alaska AND Hawaii  all in the same day .  Congrats Mike and welcome home...and good luck writing the book.

      Hi Pandys...  Panda, while I feel that guilt is usually a pointless emotion, I feel that it's especially true when considering Ash Wednesday service.  God really doesn't care if you're there or not.  He's got like 6 billion people to worry about, and so he stopped tracking church attendance ages ago.  Unfortunately, he's been keeping this info on the down-low, so not a lot of people are aware of this.  Plus, The Church doesn't even consider it a holy day, so even the bureaucrats don't care.  On the plus side, Santa is still keeping a naughty/nice list, so the pure-of-heart are still rewarded, while the evil are punished.  Yesterday I went to Ash Wednesday Mass with Duf and Anjali (I thought it was nice that they joined me).  It had a "centering" effect on us (or at least me), but it was quickly lost on Duf when he later had a little run-in with the valet at our hotel.    BTW, sorry DJS, there were no photos taken of me with ashes on the fo' head.  But I could probably recreate the look in MN with some dark eye shadow, if you like.  Later friends, Hal

       Ash Wednesday: not just about walking around with dirt on your forehead   So I got this e-mail from my mom this morning: "This is a day in the Church of Fast (no meat) and Abstinence (no eating between meals). Start to prepare for Easter, the holiest of seasons in the Church.  Join the Holy Father and pray for world peace!!  In case you  urlLink do not get to Church !"  My mom can be a little overbearing at times, God love her, but she means well.  I read this feeling a tinge of guilt knowing I probably  won't  make it to mass today, but thank God she put the little clause in there - I can just click on that link and all worries are gone!  So I'll pray for world peace, and I'll even abstain from eating meat, but no eating between meals is going to be tough...especially considering my mom just gave me 5 boxes of Girl Scout Cookies and they're sitting on my desk right now.  Damn Thin Mint temptations!  This is going to be a rough day.

       First off, welcome back, Stoner!    Second off, here's my F5 on a Monday...    1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?   I'm always reading something, but the bulk of it is newspapers and magazines.  My favorite newspapers are the NY Times and the StarTribune.  My favorite magazine is Vanity Fair, and Entertainment Weekly is something I'll eventually have to wean myself off of.  I also like reading both novels and non-fiction books.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My two all time faves are “The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and “Life After God” by Douglas Coupland (though I don’t think this one is technically a novel).  I also have to site “To Kill A Mockingbird” by Harper Lee as a sentimental favorite – Ms. Tyson read it to us in seventh grade, and it taught me that books read in school can be cool.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Okay, it’s not exotic, and probably says more about the fact that I saw “The Outsiders” at an impressionable time in my life than anything else… but here goes:  Nature’s first green is gold Her hardest hue to hold Her early leaf’s a flower; But only so an hour Then leaf subsides to leaf So Eden sank to grief So dawn goes down to day Nothing gold can stay   4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  I’m a slow reader… and I have to have great interest in anything to read it, so I have a pile of books that I swear I’ll get to but I never will, and books that I made it 1/2 way through, and I swear I'll complete.   5. What are you currently reading?  “Tender Is The Night” by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I told CK2 how much I liked “The Great Gatsby” and she told me that I would like “TITN” even better.  So I’m being obedient.  I just started it, so it’s too early to tell if it’s as good.   Third off, I'm in a ridiculously good mood this morning... I don't know why.  It is Monday, fer chrissakes...

      I highly recommend booking a last minute cruise to the Caribbean in the middle of winter. It’s cheap, you get to eat tons and tons of good food, and you get to sit in the sunshine.   Here are five of my favorite things from the trip:   1. Trying new foodstuffs.  I ate escargot for the first time in my life, and was introduced to guavaberry rum – which is really tasty in guavaberry coladas.   2. St. John – the island.  This extremely beautiful place is over 90% national park, which means it’s clean, not chintzy at all, and the snorkeling is cheap. Which brings me too…   3. Sea Creatures.  Snorkeling was a blast – we saw stingrays, a shark, crab, squid (possibly) and an incredible range of tropical fish.   4. Folded towels.  Every night, our cabin steward gave us fresh towels shaped like animals – including a monkey, wearing my sunglasses.   5. Last but not least.  I thoroughly enjoyed having super-extended honey time. It was nice to not have to go to work every day, just to play and do whatever we wanted. And I was very happy to find out that after 7 nonstop days, I still can’t get enough of the guy.

      Kellogg's sent me a quick response.  Thanks, Rosemary:   Thank you for contacting us about your suggestion for Kellogg's(R)Special K(R)Red Berries. While your idea is not new to us, we appreciate your interest and the time you took to submit this idea.  Our company devotes a great deal of time and effort to developing new and improved products, packaging concepts, promotions and merchandising ideas, such as recipe ideas and alternate serving suggestions, to make our products the best on the market.  When this product was first produced Kellogg Company tried different fruit additions.  From the information we have received the name originated because there were more than strawberries added.  Due to consumer review strawberries were chosen as the only fruit to be added.  We are happy that you are enjoying the product.  Again, thank you for contacting us; we appreciate your interest in our company and products.  Rosemary Consumer Affairs Department   On the bottom of Rosemary's very unremarkable retort, there was a push to remember to eat breakfast...   National School Breakfast Week is the perfect time to remind parents of the importance of eating a good breakfast.  Findings from studies conducted by nutrition research organizations continue to support the fact that children who eat breakfast do better academically and behave better in school than those who do not.  The key reason...not eating breakfast means that blood sugar levels remain too low to allow for proper concentration.  Adults can suffer the same problems when they skip breakfast.  So, remember to treat your children...and yourself...to a nutritious breakfast each and every day.  Our cereals and meal-on-the-go products can help!  Go to the Nutrition section of www.kelloggs.com to learn more.   It's looks to me Kellogg's so-called "studies" are just pushing people to buy more of their product.  My brother always ate breakfast when we were growing up and that never made him "behave better."  What a crock.

       Waging War   I've had it and I'm now officially standing up for my cause.  If any of you know me very well at all, you'll know I have a severe distaste for smokers.  I won't bother listing all of the things that bug me about the filthy habit because it's been said before.  But let's just say this: some people are passionate about peace, other about animal rights.  This time I'm not fighting the smokers for myself or any other human being.  I'm going to war for the tree.  Across the street from our building is a lone pine tree that has to sit at the edge of the property.  It is this tree that every smoker from across the street gathers to engage in their ceremony of stink.  All kinds of pigs waddle across the lawn to get to this poor tree to light up, bitch about work, and smoke to their tar-stained heart's content.  Now, if you know most smokers (like I do) they don't bother disposing of their filthy habit properly.  Take a drive on the freeway for example.  How often do you see some asshole fire a butt out the window because he doesn't want to 'stink up his car' or 'surround himself in his disgusting weakness?'  The same applies for the poor pine tree.  They fire their butts on the ground and pollute the poor tree with their rancid smoke screens.  So, what I'm doing is making signs that I'm going to put in the ground next to the tree.  They're going to be high-quality signs that will be laminated, fastened to a pointed stick and inserted into the ground.  The signs are going to have little messages on them that will (hopefully) make the smokers feel like gruesome beasts and remind them of what social lepers they are.  One sign will say:   Hey Smokers!  This is the Pine Tree Talking:  PICK UP YOUR BUTTS. I don’t want to suffer because  of your filthy habit.   Another one says:   Mmmmm….Delicious Cigarettes.   You know what else is delicious???  CANCER. Enjoy Your Day.   -The Tree   I'm planning on making 12 different signs.  I will plant them one week from today and let the fun begin.  Of course, I'll keep everyone up to date on what happens.  I can see the tree and all of the sweathogs that go down there to smoke from my desk.

      Last night, I saw Pete Yorn play live.  In addition to being a looker, the guy puts on a good show.  In fact, it exceeded my (admittedly modest) expectations.  As DJS might put it, “me likey”.  Speaking of DJS, Pete sang a song called "burrito".  I can't believe he's not DJS's soul mate.  On the surreal-in-a-good way front, I ran into a friend from high school at the show.  It’s always really weird to see someone you’ve barely known since you were both 17 telling you that she’s been married for 3 years.  Plus, she works in the same industry as I do, and thus actually understands what our company does… no small feat.  The music, the blast-from-the-past, the nicotine and alcohol all spun together to make me quite woosy.  I’m having a groggy morning.

      Okay, that test was pretty intense.  I can’t believe they needed all that info to come up with “ Iron Ethel Bonney ”.  Plus, they had a lame explanation:   A pirate’s life isn’t easy; it takes a tough person.  That’s okay with you, though, since you are that person.  You can be a little bit unpredictable, but a pirate’s life is far from full of certainties, so that fits in pretty well.  Arr!    Sure.

       Do You Ever Do This? Subtitled:  Duf' Finds Religion  By Duf Fer  Do you ever wait to share bad news until it's no longer bad?  Here are some examples.  My friend Renee, a Pandyland reader, who is holding Pearl Jam tickets for the show we are going to see together, lost the tickets, but wisely waited to tell me (I have a bad heart you know) until she found them.  And so it is with Duf'.  I lost about $1,000 worth of expense reimbursement receipts.  I didn't want to say anything to Mrs. Duf' (she has a bad heart you know), and this morning I found them.  Praise him!

      My pirate name is:    Bloody Roger Vane    Every pirate lives for something different. For some, it's the open sea. For others (the masochists), it's the food. For you, it's definitely the fighting. You tend to blend into the background occaisionally, but that's okay, because it's much easier to sneak up on people and disembowel them that way. Arr!

       Shit.  You'd Think I Never Posted Anymore (mostly I'm afraid of Stoner bringing up Justin Timberlake again)...by DJS Inc.    1. What was the last TV show you watched?  Since I don't watch much TV, I have to back to Wednesday.  I watched the last half of a show called 'Extreme Makeovers.'  It's about how 2 ugly people (through the miracles of science and plastic surgery) get to be okay-looking.  It was gross.  One woman had lips to Rhode Island and the other had a face that looked like it'd been caught in 12 violent hailstorms.   2. What was the last thing you complained about and what was the problem?  That I couldn't remember a movie I'd wanted to see (and possibly buy) at Suncoast.  I figured it out, Duf.  It was called  urlLink Series 7 .   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?  Wow.  I think it was yesterday.  I told my bestest, lovey, honey-bear, snookums, tender-morsel (DJ LZ) that I thought she looked cute.  And she did.   4. What was the last thing you threw away?  A half hour (more like 45 minutes) going to the MOA (Mall of America) with Duf Daddy.  We had time to burn, friends.   5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?  Shit.  I don't know.  urlLink FARK?

       First off, I think I need to address Duf’s obsession with me… I haven’t seen him, or spoken with him today, and yet he’s apparently fantasizing interactions between us.  Weird.  I’m not even wearing pants today.    1. What was the last TV show you watched?  I flipped between the Today Show (I’ve still got something for that Matt Lauer) and Good Morning America (or GMA to those of us in the know).  Katie (ugh) was interviewing Al Pacino, and Diane (love her!) and Charlie were chatting about reality TV.    2. What was the last thing you complained about and what was the problem?  I didn’t vocalize it, but this morning I was upset about how long the wait was at Caribou.  I thought to myself “there has to be a way for this to be more efficient.  Most of these people are headed to work!  I shouldn’t have stopped.  Yeah, I should have.  Next time I should go to Dunn Bros.  Sebastian Joes is usually quick too… Maybe it’s just slow because it’s Friday…”  Something along those lines.   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?  It was indirect – last night I was working on a gift for a friend and I wrote that I felt lucky to know her.  We haven’t given it to her yet (it’s a group gift) so she has not yet received the complement.   4. What was the last thing you threw away?  My O.J. container, and my coffee cup.  Don’t know which went first.  I drink a lot in the morning.   5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?  The Internet Movie Database.  I’m a junkie.

       Hal is the Center of My Universe or Sits Near Me, You Decide The Friday Five by Duf Fer    1. What was the last TV show you watched?  Fox 9 News - I was desperate (I feel like this gives the wrong impression of my television viewing habits).   2. What was the last thing you complained about and what was the problem?  I complained to Hal about co-workers who were complaining about a co-worker when the complaining co-workers are very far from complain-proof.   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?  All of my answers are giving the wrong idea, but I told Hal that I liked her pants (in a HR friendly way, or at least I think it was an HR friendly way - I wasn't leering or anything).   4. What was the last thing you threw away?  A note to Hal asking her about her availability for golf the week of May 12 (with our boss and a bean counter who works with us).      5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?  hal.com, just kidding... urlLink One of my favorite web sites of all time (enter a word and check it out) .

What was the last thing you complained about and what was the problem?  My job.  It sucks.  Enough said.   3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say?  One of my coworkers brought in his baby pictures and I told him I thought he was a cute baby.  Especially the picture where he was wearing a T-shirt that said "Mister Magic."     4. What was the last thing you threw away?  A banana peel.   5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?  Yahoo

We're going to see  BJORK  at  RED ROCKS!!!     You see, I'm a registered member of  urlLink www.bjork.com   and as such, you get to buy concert tickeys a good 2 days in advance.  That's how Bjork does and she does it all night.  So, long story short...I'm going to see my most favoritist Icelander tearing the mountains down at the site where the U2 video 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' was filmed.  How's that for kick-ass?

      Since you asked…   It all started with the movie Bend it Like Beckham. At the Uptown theater, you can buy tea. I got some Ginger Peach Longevity Tea, and it was delish!! Next thing you know, I’m at World Market buying the stuff. I also picked up some Mango Ceylon Metabolic Frolic tea. I drank some for a few days, and got terrible headaches, until I realized I was WRONG in my assumption that black tea has just as much caffeine as coffee. As it turns out, this stuff has half as much. So I started taking Advil to mask the pain.   I decided I want to kick caffeine a while back, but really cemented the decision on a recent trip to my honey’s hometown. I realized it’s kind of pathetic to have to make a special trip to Burger King for coffee. (No Starbucks in his town – too small.)    Plus my doctor told me to cut back in order to reduce PMS. I think that would really be a good thing for everyone…

       1. Who is your favorite celebrity?  Sport: (tie) Tiger Woods and Nomar Garciaparra. Film:  Tim Robbins (ask me again next week) Television:  Bernie Mac and (though I have not seen her show yet) Wanda Sykes Porn:  DJS Politics:  tie:  Sen. Harkin, Sen. Bradley, Sen. Kerry, and, most of all Sen Harry Reid of Nevada (former employer).   2. Who is your least favorite?  Osama Bin Laden (for obvious reasons) Jim Carrey (sorry, I don't get it - I never have actually) Lleyton Hewitt (the tennis player - still haven't gotten over the racist comment directed at James Blake in the 2001 U.S. Open, I will root against him until he is dead; he makes me hate Kim Cjlisters (his girlfriend) and he give me reservations about Australia) Alanis Morissette (I can't explain it, I'm a total hater.)   3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?   Met is a strong word seen is easier.  I bumped into Oprah as faithful readers know.  I saw Alison Janney at the L.A. Arboretum (no bra!) and John Ritter at Amoeba Records (uncombed hair!).  I just saw Nick Collison (graduating forward for the Kansas Jayhawk basketball team) at Yello Sub (best subs in the lower 48) in Lawrence, Kansas (the 23rd street location, not the Jayhawk Boulevard location).  Rick Fox small forward for the L.A. Lakers at (then) Dayton's in downtown Mizzapolis.  I talked to the poet Anne Carson (stared at my crotch the whole time - "hey, poet, I'm up here!").  I've seen Duante Culpepper (Vikings Quarterback) and Stephon Marbury (Phoenix Suns guard) at the airport.  I talked to (former Vice Presidential candidate) Geraldine Ferraro in her office for about 15 minutes (couldn't take her eyes off my crotch BTW).  I've met and talked to Maya Angelou (writer, poet) and Gordon Parks (photographer, artist) and Jesse Ventura (wrestler, governor).  I saw Prince driving a Ford Taurus in Minnetonka once.  George Steinbrenner at a Yankess spring training game.  I sat on a plane next to General Westmoreland (commanded the troops in Vietnam -   loves   his gin gibsons BTW).  I rapped with Jesus once in college (vey, vey drunk, friends, vey drunk).  A few Presidents (the elder Bush (S.A.C.), Gore (counting as President) and Reagan)...My contacts have all been so slight that I'm sure I'm forgetting some.   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?   Not even for one second.  I'm not sure I would want to be rich.  I definitely would not want to be powerful, and of the three, the one I want the least if fame.  What a burden.  If I had to choose one between rich, powerful or famous, I would reluctantly choose rich.  I'd put them in this order rich, powerful, famous.   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?  Tiger Woods - for the golf, baby.  I know it's boring, but I cannot tell a lie.  I would pick Tiger for the golf.

       Friday Five, cuz I'm bored.    1. Who is your favorite celebrity?  I can't pick one.  And I don't have to because it's our site and we can do whatever the hell we want... Bono (for his music, sex appeal, charity work, and for pissing off DJS) Kate Hudson (could she be any cuter?...plus, she's the poster child for flat women everywhere.) J. Lo (not so much cuz I like her, but because she always gives us crap to talk about) Claire Danes (she's been in some great indy films and was in the best show on TV - My So-Called Life) Vince Vaughn (love the funny, smartass attitude.  Ms. T partied with him in LA and said he was even cooler in person)   2. Who is your least favorite?  Saddam Hussein (for obvious reasons) Renee Zellweger (I have no idea what the fascination is) Britney Spears (that carnie-looking wanna-be virgin freak) Jennifer Aniston (she always looks like she's constipated) Any Super Model (eat already) Andie MacDowell (worst actress ever.  stop your whining.) Mariah Carey (no-talent slut) Katie Couric (hiding behind that crazy smile is a cuckoo liberal bitch)   3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?   Never met, just seen.  I saw Sarah Jessica Parker while I was shopping in the village.  Queen Latifah when I was dining with Thong (v. embarrassing).  The guy from the B-52's while walking through Soho (don't even know his name).  Rosie Perez was in front of me in line at the friends-and-family sale at J Crew on 5th Ave.  For the record, she was not looking good without make-up...and she bought about $400 worth of clothes.  Wait, one more...I saw Elizabeth Hurley in Marshall Fields on State St here in Chi.   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?    I think it would be a blast.  I'm a sucker for some good drama, so why not get the paparazzi involved?  I'd invite them shopping with me.   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?  I picked J Lo before, but maybe this time I would choose Madonna.  That would be one wacky day.

       F-f-f-f-f-f-friday F-f-f-f-f-f-ive in DJS Quadraphonic Stereo    1. Who is your favorite celebrity?  Always a tough question...because from what realm of fame dost thou choose?  Music?  Movies?  TV?  Well, since TV sucks, I can omit that realm.  Let's see...I guess I'm going to have to go with Bjork.  I know...it was a given, but when I really think about it, there's no one else that I'll drop whatever I'm doing to watch if I see a video of hers or an interview or whatever.  I'll even admit to getting into a bidding war with some Kraut over an picture of her framed with an autographed CD in there.  The final price ended up being $312.00.  Guess who won???   2. Who is your least favorite?  I've got a bunch.  Here goes (in no order)  1. Oprah Winfrey (see earlier posts) 2. Dick Clark (there's a reason people call him 'Dick') 3. Jennifer Garner (have no idea why she's famous) 4. Horse-faced Julia Roberts (no talent, big-toothed psychopath) 5. Bill Cosby (mugging, annoying, holier than thou jello-eating jerk) 6. Dave Matthews (yodeling frat-boy rock idiot) 7. J Lo (phony, over-exposed head-case) 8. Sean Connery (egotistical wife-beating drunk) 9. Rosie O'Donnell (head like a medicine ball, loud-mouth freakshow) 10. Avril Lavigne (it upsets me that I even know her name) 11. Michael Jordan (retire for good, you has-been) 12. Dale Earnhardt Sr. & Jr. (one down, one to go) 13. Justin Timberlake (I want him dead.  get an identity, white-boy) (to be continued)   3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?  Yep.  I've met Brendan Fraser (nice guy), Uma Thurman (she touched me 3 times), Timothy Hutton (asked me how I was doing), Michael Rappaport (prick), Steven Wright (my mom embarassed him in an elevator), Emilio Estevez (bumped into him), Joel Coen (shook his hand and introduced myself).  People I've just seen: Natalie Portman, Martha Plimpton, Queen Latifa, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jean Claude Van Damme, Joe Pesci, Joshua Jackson, Linda Hamilton, James Cameron, Kid (from Kid N Play) there might be some more but I can't think of 'em.   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?   I don't know if I'd want to be famous because t would suck for everyone to know who you are.  The minute you do something stupid, everyone knows about it.  I guess I wouldn't mind being well-known, you know?  Like if one of my books takes off and people on the street say 'Hey, aren't you the guy who wrote...?'  That would be pretty cool, I reckon.  Yeah.  Well-known.  That'd be all right with me.  Oh...and rich, too.   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?  We did this question already, but I'll pick someone different this time.  I'd want to trade places with Steven Speilberg.  In one day, I'd green-light all the projects that came over from a certain DJS and I'd ask him if I could buy the rights to his children's book so that I could make it into a blockbuster family film.  If I was Steven Speilberg, I'd avoid Kate Capshaw...I don't know, tell her I was busy at work and wouldn't be able to come home.  That woman scares me.  Plus, she ruined the 2nd Indiana Jones movie with her horrible acting (dis)abilities.

       Bestiality Discussion at Work   Thong has gone waaaaay too far this time.  Today she somehow got onto the subject of her dog's crotch.  And how her and her husband play with it.  I'm not kidding.  "He was laying on the couch with his legs spread, and I wanted to see what his balls felt like so I grabbed them."  "My husband said "Hey Thong, check this out." And then he pulled back his foreskin to see the red lipstick."  I seriously need a supply of airplane sickbags at my desk, because I feel like I'm going to vomit everytime she opens up her mouth.  Word of advice: don't tell your coworkers about playing with your dog's nads.  I think Rob wants to submit a haiku.

      Happy Easter, kids.  Be good.  I'm off to visit my older bro and his wifey in Ann Arbor.  To facilite this, I have a big flight to Dee-Troit tomorrow.  I've never been there before.  Any Eminem sightings, and I'll be sure to tell you.  I don't think I'd say "I love you" to him if I do see him, but we'll see.

      Hal, in this case, when the L-Bomb is used with a celebrity (b-list or otherwise), it never means "in love".  Like when I told Bono I loved him at the U2 show we were at (well, I didn't tell him as much as hollered  at  him).  Bono and I are not at that "level" yet.  So it just means I like him a whole lot.  With that chachi Jaime from the Bachelorette, telling him I loved him was a desperate attempt to get him to talk to me.  I wasn't really feelin' it.   You  saying it to Bono, on the other hand, is a whole other story.

      In addition to seeing the Jayhawks perform last night at the Metro (great show!), I ran into  urlLink this guy  by the bathroom in the club.  I remember being a little star-struck (yes, he's only a minor celebrity to most, but hot DAMN I loved that show)...so I had to tell him I thought he  definitely  was the hottest one of all 25.  That didn't seem to get me any points, so then I desperately told him I loved him.  (Yeah, good move.  Because most guys are so turned on when complete strangers tell them they love them.)  He said "Thanks."  And then ran away as fast as he could.  Hmmmm...did I come on too strong?

I was going to dd DJS, but I don't have his number in my phone.  Panda, I don't have your number either.  I need Hal's phone to booty call you!  So, here's what you missed.  I am drunk with Hady (self hating Puerto Rican from Crooklyn) and Andres (self hating Puerto Rican from Cali) and Anj (self hating Indian from Iselin, Jersey (represent, represent)) and Big Kev (self hating Jew from NYC).  It's all good in the hood like a young boy should - you feelin' me?

       We Must Be Popular (nah...that's not it)   You may be wondering why there's sometimes a high-quality (snicker) picture up above and why sometimes there's nothing but an empty space and a little red X.  I know I did.  Well, it turns out that the place I use to host pictures only lets the page be viewed a certain number of times before they say 'Eff this.  You're taking up too much bandwidth.'  Bandwidth is nerd-speak for computer power.  So, one would deduce that our crappy little site is becoming somewhat popular because a bunch of people must've stopped by and caused the Sopranos picture to go away.  Anyway, long story short, I made a new picture (by request) and it should be up top tomorrow morning.  Village Photos (the shitty site that hosts pictures for free) says that traffic was too high today and that my account has been locked until tomorrow.  Hasta la taco, friends.

      I’ve been remiss in reporting on my recently viewed movies.  So here goes:   urlLink This  was REALLY great, thanks to Duf for the recommendation.  I especially enjoyed the Parker Posey segment.  She rocks.   urlLink This  was okay.  I had heard it talked up a lot, and I am a sucker for Campbell Scott (ever since “ urlLink Singles ”).  He had me at “I just happened to be nowhere near your neighborhood”.  Anyway, it was just too big on the smug, and too little on the clever.  Even with that, it was much better than…   urlLink This movie .  Panda and I spent most of the flick going “what the?”, and not it a good way.  I’m no sucker for Mickey Rourke, so I had no love for him as a drug “cook”.  Needless to say, if you like Jason Schwartzman, just watch “ urlLink Rushmore ” again.  Then your heart will not be broken.  This movie sucked.  Unless you’re into John Leguizamo wearing only a sock.  Than this is the flick for you.  There.  Now I feel much better.

       1. Favorite drink?  That's easy:  it's vodka and tonic.  My favorite vodkas are, in this order:  Grey Goose, Belvedere, Stolichnaya, Absolut, and Ketel One.  I'd also like to give a shout out to the vodka martini up, eight to one with an extra olive and to the Manhattan.    2. Favorite bar?  W.A. Frost in St. Paul is my favorite Twin Cities haunt.  Johnny's Tavern in Lawrence, Kansas, my favorite spot of all.  I also have to give a nod to two bars in D.C.: The Hawk and Dove and The Sign of the Whale.    3. Most hungover…  When I was in college, one night I got so drunk that I kissed a man (not on the lips, yo), walked off a porch and fell into a thorn bush, and then had a hard time keeping my vision clear (so drunk I had blurry vision).  The next morning, I woke up drunk with a stabbing pain in my head.  That was because I "fell asleep" on the bathroom floor with my sunglasses on and they were pressing into my cranium.  Anyway, I went to register for class and pay fees. It was the beginning of the fall semester, so all these parents from KC were escorting their youngsters through the process.  I was waiting in line for my scholarship (with my wayfarers all the way on and my high top fade haircut faded very high, thank you) and the urge to purge fell on me (all the way on me).  I went to the bathroom and it was packed.  Every stall was taken and every urinal too.  I could not wait and got sick in the trash can while fathers and sons looked on me with disgust.  It was the beginning of a hangover that almost did Duf' in.

       My Apologies to Gladys Knight & The Pips   Needless to say, I made an ass of myself on Friday at Mickey's karaoke on Clark.  "Is this thing on?...I can't hear anything?...those aren't the words...what key is this in?"  "Midnight Train to Georgia" never sounded so bad.  And I never felt so lit.  And who knew you could make "America" by Neil Diamond into a duet?  On a more sober note,  urlLink here's a movie  you should run out and see.  Don't just sit there.  Go.  Now.

       Allow me to apologize...   I’m sorry if we didn’t call you, and I’m especially sorry if we did call you.  My memory of Wednesday is very… vague.  I am not yet aware of why we were on the phone so much to begin with, but I’m sure I’ll remember soon.  That said, this is an ironic set of Qs.   1. Favorite drink?  Gin and Tonic.  Specifically, Tanqueray and Tonic, and for those special occasions, Tanqueray 10 and Tonic.  I also like vodka – Panda introduced me to flavored Stoli, which is very nice.  I’m not a fan of “dark” booze, like whiskey or tequila, though I do like a rum and coke one and awhile.  I also adore beer and wine.  Wow, now I’m thirsty.   2. Favorite bar?  Easy.  The Hangee Uppee in Chi-town.    3. Most hungover…  24 hours ago.  Picture waking up in a hotel room with the lights and television on, and shaking.  Then realizing that you have to pack (!!!), go into work (double !!!), and then get on two airplanes (hello, aisle seat!).  Luckily, I am never drinking again, so I don’t have to worry about hangovers anymore.

       1. Favorite drink?  I’ve always loved the Captain Morgan – along with some delicious Coke. Other faves include, but are not limited to, bloody Marys, Newcastle Brown Ale, Sangria, cider, all types of wine, vodka martinis (with really good olives – mmm…chipotle stuffed olives…), Leinie’s, Harp, Miller Lite, amaretto sours, and mimosas.   2. Favorite bar?  That would have to be the Hart and Spool, our pub from Borehamwood. I also really liked the bar we went to in Portland, which was a converted elementary school (even though it creeped me out a little – something about being in a school at night while drinking).    3. Most hungover…  Ouch. I get hungover pretty much every time I drink nowadays. I haven’t puked for a while though – which is good. The last time I puked, it was after a moderate night out. The phone rang, I jumped up, answered it, said “I gotta go,” and then ran for the bathroom. I like not being lil’ sicky though…

       Sharing Too Much Time with DJS    1. What's your favorite drink?  Why?  Wow.  This changes almost daily.  I'm a simple man with simple mean, so I enjoy the occasional beer.  If I were to go to the store right now and pick up a 6-er, I'd probably get Miller High Life which, as you all should know, is the Champagne of Beers.  I don't know.  Every since Dirty and I went to Milwaukee to see Tenacious D and enjoyed the brewery tour, I'm sold.  It's delicious.  (insert white trash jokes here)  If I'm going to have a drinky-drink, I'd go with a Vodka Sour or possibly a citrus-y drink mixed in with Bacardi Limon or O.  Those give me my 'O' face.  Oh, oh, oh...   2. What's your favorite bar?  Tell me about it.  Even thought I haven't been there in ages, I'm going to go with The German Bar or Gasthaus Zur Gumitlikeit (or some shit like that)  They play polka music, serve beer that I don't really enjoy drinking, and it's usually crowded and hot as hell.  Why do I like it?  It's usually a pretty good crowd.  You can do snuff, drink beer from a boot, the bartender there gives me a free shot EVERY time I go in there, and the waitresses are cool.  They wear funny wigs that look awful on them.  One of the waitresses even danced like a crazy woman with me one night.  She kind of reminded me of a poor-man's Bjork.  God bless her.   3. When was the last time you were really hungover?  Discuss.  It's been a while.  Oddly enough, I don't drink nearly as heavily as I used to.  Call it old age.  Whatever, jerks.  But, I'd have to go with the pub crawl in November of 2001.  I was between girlfriends at the time, and I had my sights set on 3 different potential female prospects.  Well, we started drinking waaaaaaaaay too early.  By the time I caught up with any of the women I had my eyes on, I was completely shitfaced and made a fool of myself.  I ended up making out with my (at the time) best-friend's girlfriend (she started it) and I fell asleep in my car with some girl I went to high school with outside my other friends house.  No, I hadn't been driving, but I was dog tired and full of booze.  Does anyone understand now why I don't drink so much anymore?  Thanks for your time, friends.

       I like The Drink   Last night, over a low-ball glass of Makers & Coke, I was thinking about how much I like the Drink.  Now, I'm not talking about liking that drink in particular, but The Drink.  The Booze.  The Pint.  The Occasional Snootful.  The Elixir.  Then I thought  why ?  Why do I like it so?  Let me tell you.  The drink makes you feel powerful.  Sexy.  Vulnerable.  Relaxed.  Crazed.  Energized.  Sad.  Depending on what you drink, you can feel all these things at once.  Margaritas make me feel festive.  Wine makes me feel calm.  Beer makes me laugh.  A Vodka Tonic is my equivalent to speed.  So along those same lines, here's the  Thursday Three :   1. What's your favorite drink?  Why?  Flavored Stoli and Tonic.  I was  way  into this before all the cheap versions of flavored vodka came out.  What I'm really saying is, I invented this drink.  Stoli-O and Stoli-Razz give me the jump-start I need for a night on the town.   2. What's your favorite bar?  Tell me about it.  There is nothing glamorous about Monsignor Murphy's.  Basically, it's a dump.  It has Golden Tee next to the Jukebox (as you know, my biggest pet peeve).  It has cheesy sports paraphernalia on the walls.  Hal once posed with one of their numerous dart trophies.  BUT...they do have a beer garden in the summer, and they have one of the BEST jukeboxes in the city (Lots of U2 = Great Jukebox), they sometimes give me free shots, the bartenders have funny nicknames like Ziggy (although I've been known to call him Skippy when I'm hammered).  You also don't have to dress up to go there.  It's where everybody knows your name...or at least your favorite drink.   3. When was the last time you were really hungover?  Discuss.  I bet you I can guess it's this morning for Hal and Duf.  For me, it was about a month ago after my friend had a party at the Schoolyard Tavern.  The party was on a Thursday night, making the hangover feel even worse because I was supposed to go to work on Friday.  But I didn't.  I took a totally legitimate sick day.  And watched TLC all day long. Nothing can cure a lil' sickie hangover like "The Dating Story."

       Those Voice-Mail Sluts   I got a choice VM from those 2 trouble makers last night too.  (and here I thought I was  special ...)  I was at the Green Mill, so it was difficult to hear what everyone said, but it was pretty similar to what Stoner decribes below.  I called back and got Duf on the line.   His response: "You DO love me."  Yes, Duf.  Very much.  Hal of course had to get on and give her 2 cents: "I am SOOOO drunk right now."  Do I detect a pattern?  Or did this just start after her corruption in Chi-town?

Hal: Hello? (blowing wind) Hellllloooooo? Hello? (more background noise) Hal: Hi-Stoner-I-was-going-to-leave-a-message-but-I-can't. (all one slurred word)  I also got a phone call at home, so I got to talk to them. I just really hope they're doing okay at work today...  Duf, Hal, how about an update?

       Happy Friday!    1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  My parent’s house, Dowling Hall at UST (4 years, 4 different rooms), Borehamwood, SLP, and now my current place.  That makes a modest 5 (not counting the multiple Dowling abodes).   2. Which was your favorite and why?  Gotta go with Stoner – Borehamwood, baby.  It was also the lowest-quality housing I’ve ever lived in… Stoner didn’t mention the mini-fridge (shared by all 7 of us), the lack of a clothes dryer (that’s what the room heaters were for) or kitchen floor, and the mountain of garbage piled on the side of the house.  Not to mention dodging the television license people for 6 months.  It’s kinda sad, but I wouldn’t last 2 days in a place like that now.  Honorary mention goes to the apartment I had in Dowling.  Rent free, furninshed, plus free cable (and nearly unlimited C-Store access).  It was good.   3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  I can think of few things I hate more.   4. What's more important, location or price?  Location.  Hands down.   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  I don’t have a complete picture – but it’s an old place (and since this is a dream, I have the money to maintain it, and modernize it where needed).  I’m within a walk to a coffee shop, a little restaurant, and a place to buy milk… and I have cool neighbors.  There is no pool, but there is central air… The bedroom is a good size, with a master bath… hmmm… I have to think about this more, I can come up with better stuff...

       1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  House on Temple Court, first house in Woodbury, house in WI, townhouse in Woodbury, house in Woodbury, Dowling Hall at UST (four different rooms), flat in East Finchley, 107 Cleveland, house in Borehamwood, Carriage House on Summit, Somerset Oaks (that address is still on my driver’s license), Westlake Estates (for one month), and now right by Lake Harriet (yet spending quite a bit of time in White Bear Lake).   That makes 16. Look out Duf - I'm almost caught up.    2. Which was your favorite and why?  House in Borehamwood – three guys, four girls, and over 30 guests in five months. Who could forget the jungle bathroom, the shed, the washing machine we had to keep closed with a broomstick, the skylights that blew into the neighbor’s yard every time the wind picked up, the psychic landlady who healed Christine and made us reupholster our own furniture, and the characters we met at the Hart and Spool.    3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  They used to be nothing but exciting – when I could fit all of my belongings into one car, and do all of the moving myself. Once you start roping people into lifting furniture, etc. it gets a little stressful. But I love unpacking and deciding where everything gets to go.    4. What's more important, location or price?  In my younger days, I was all about location. But now that I am older and increasingly poorer (yet wanting to live in a house someday, instead of an apartment) I am all about price. When it comes down to it, every location has its benefits. Inexpensive housing is a big one!   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?   My pie-in-the-sky dream house has plenty of windows, is near a lake, has a nice big yard for my non-drooling, non-pooping St. Bernard, and a sanctuary-like home office where I work on projects that make me happy, plenty of space for my kids to play – without the risk of choking, drowning, or electrocution – and the best damn shower in the tri-state area.

       1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  Are you ready for this?  The green house in Kansas City, the brown house in Kansas City, my grandparents house in Wichita, the apartment on Rock Road, Wichita, the condo on Bramblewood in Wichita, the condo on Woodlawn in Wichita, Joseph R. Pearson Hall, Lawrence Kansas, Roger Templin Hall, Lawrence, Kansas, an apartment on Fourth Street SW, Washington, D.C., the blue apartments in Lawrence, the brown apartment in Lawrence, the co-op in Dinkytown, the house on 7th street, Minneapolis, the apartment near St. Anthony Main, the townhouse uptown, the house in Golden Valley, the apartment uptown, the house on Chicago Avenue and the house in St. Paul on Iglehart.  That’s 19, friends (which means I have not averaged two years in any one place –I’m a nomad, a gypsy).     2. Which was your favorite and why?  A house is made of brick and stone, a home is made of love alone.  I would pick my current home as my favorite.  Awwwwwwww…    3. Do you find moving houses more exciting or stressful? Why?  My goal is to move twice more in my life.  I would like to move into a home that I will raise a family in, then I would like to move when we empty nest.  That is all.  I HATE moving.  I find it stressful and tiring.   4. What's more important, location or price?  Right now I live in a very inexpensive house (purchased pre-bubble…if I told you our mortgage payment, you would all pass out), and I would gladly triply my mortgage for a better location.     5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  Gee, I have never thought about it (wink, wink).  There is a nice view (a lake or a city scape or wetlands.  I always liked wetlands).  And a wrap around porch (Cape Cod style, y'all).  Everyone has their own bedroom, plus there is a guest room and a separate study/den, there is a balcony off the master suite, all closets are walk in (there is an over-abundance of storage space, all bathrooms are so huge they border on gaudy – I have my own sink, basin and medicine cabinet), the kitchen is large enough to eat in, but not too large.  There is a dining room with seating for 12, there is a living room (no TV) and a family room (with “a color TV so I can see, the Knicks play basketball…”), there is a media room (High-Def, DVD, stereo, those couches that shake with the bass), and a built-in stereo with speakers in all the key rooms, including the fitness room.  There is a finished walk-out basement with an 8 foot slate pool table.  In the backyard, there is room for a nice garden and for a putting green surrounded by sand traps.  There is also a writing studio that is topped by a greenhouse.  There is a tennis court, with basketball rims at each end, and there is a phat-ass garage.  The whole house is powered by on-site solar and wind energy and has a whole bunch of windows.  Last, there is an underground bunker supplied by its own independent filtered oxygen source and accessible from any floor in the house where we can escape when the terrorists attack (instead of duct taping plastic all over everything like suckas!).

       Friday 5:  Done and....Done.   Sponsored by DJS    1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  Oh, sweet bearded Christ...there's the St. Anthony house with ma and pa shovelpants, then the apartment in New Brighton, then the shithole in Los Angeles, temporarily back to mom and dad's when I moved back, to the house behind Elsie's in Nordeast Minnecrapolis, then to the house in 'upper Nordeast', then a temporary stay in an apartment in Uptown, then back at mom and dad's (transitional), then back to the house in Nordeast, then to another apartment in Uptown, then another, then I moved in with DJ LZ on the busiest intersection in Uptown (Franklin & Hennepin) then finally to the townhouse in Woodbury where we're living happily ever after...until we move in about 3 years.  Lucky 13, baby.  But I'm counting each move.  That's how I do.   2. Which was your favorite and why?  I like our place in Woodbury.  It's ideal in every sense of the word.  Don't have to shovel snow, cut grass or any of that garbage.  Can't.  Busy.  Also, we can park both of our cars in the garage, we get to do laundry a mere 20 feet from where all of our clothes go and last but not least...it's quiet.  I don't hear filthy fat pigs riding around on their stupid Harley Davidsons, firetrucks at 2am, or drunken assholes stumbling out of Liquor Lyle's calling out to their equally drunken friends.   3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  Stressful as all get-out.  It's the worst thing in the world to do.  I'd rather have someone drop kick me in the ball bag than move my stuff every other year or so.   4. What's more important, location or price?  I concur with my friend, Panda.  Location baby.  Unfortunately some of my locations have been less than stellar.  Hence the moves.   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  I'd love to have a big old office/library where I could work on my latest literary masterpiece.  Attached to that, I'd like a nice big dark room so I can pretend that I'm a big shot photographer too.  A pool would be okay, too, but more importantly I'd like to have a big old spa attached to my kickboxing gym where I'd have heavy bags, speed bags, lots of kicking shields and a full-size ring where I could have my very own fight club.  Oooohh...I'd also like to have a video game arcade where I could have all of the classic vids that I enjoyed growing up.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the deluxe stadium-seating home theatre, too.  Perfect for watching my asspocket of DVDs and playing video games until my eyes were as dry as chicken tenders from Arby's.  Yeah, I said it.

       I like this Friday 5, so let's do it    1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  Hmmmm....the white house in Madison, the brown house in Madison, the yellow house in Appleton, the brick house in Appleton, the dorms in St. Paul, Crouch End flat in London, 87 Cleveland in St. Paul, Cle-Mar in St. Paul, 3 BR Three's Company situation in Uptown, St. Louis Park place, studio on Lake Shore Dr. in Chi-town.  That would be 11.   2. Which was your favorite and why?  Crouch End flat for obvious reasons...some of my best times EVER were in London (and Stoner was there, she can vouch for me!)...even though those damn kids would wake me up practicing their violins.  87 Cleveland (w/ AM and Jillios) ranks up there too - ask Hal about cleaning the floors.    3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  The most stressful experience I can think of.  That's why I haven't moved out of my tiny place in over 4 years, even though I constantly complain about its size.   4. What's more important, location or price?  Location, location, location.   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  My dream house would have a pool, but only if I was in California, NOT the Midwest.  In Chicago you could only use a pool for about a month.  Oh, and I would need a cute pool boy to clean it.  I would also like a home gym, but only if Rico (that Fubu wearing hottie) was my personal trainer.  Sorry, TG.

      Geez....someone's crabby.  (see post below)  But seriously, HAL, when is a good time to schedule you to meet my cat?  I'm sure Kato's owners are flexible as to when people can come by to see how un-cat-like the little fellow is.  After all, he is America's Favorite Cat. Did I mention that he's got a crooked tail?  It's so adorable...there's no doubt in my mind that you'll stop hating cats.  I guarantee it, friend.  And oh...that reminds me, I've got to stop at Sam's Club for a 2 pound bag of Chex Mix.  Nummers!  That aside, I feel it's my civic duty to report I've found my CD of the year.  Yes, it's only April and early April at that, but I don't care.  I think I've found the next album that's going to remain in the truck for basically the rest of my days.  It's  urlLink The Exies .  They opened for Everclear last night at First Avenue (rollicking, sweaty good time) and I've got to say these fellows rock like none other.  The best part?  Their CD is only  $7.99 at Target this week .  I scooped it up on Tuesday so I'd be prepared for last night's show when Duf and I went out to score the latest White Stripes CD and I've got to admit...DJS likey more than the WS disc.  I never thought I'd admit it, but it's THAT GOOD.  If you're in the office (Duf, HAL) you must stop by to watch the video that's included on the CD.  Just damn good all around.  Side note: Barrio Barb bought it on my recommendation and CK2 is going to scoop up a copy, citing:  'The lead singer is HOT.'

       Morning Rant   DJS, I’m sure it’s a great cat.  But why are cat people so defensive?  If someone says “I like cats better than dogs” they don’t get a response like “you have to meet MY dog… he’s great, and totally unlike all other dogs.  He’s more of a turtle, really”.  Whereas every time I say I don’t dig cats, someone has The Exception Pet that I would surely love.  I don’t get it.  Something else I don’t get – there is a new Sam’s Club opening in Bloomington on 494 any day now.  I know this because my parents have brought it up at least once every time I’ve spoken with them recently.  I’m like, “what is your obsession with ‘Sam’s Club’?” and my mother went on about how it’s near a Home Depot, and much more convenient than St. Louis Park.  Didn’t answer my question, but I guess it’s a response.  I just don’t understand why any two-person household needs to buy in bulk.  It’s not like they’re caterers!  Anyway, today my dad brought it up AGAIN (!!!), and I said “does mother know that Wal-Mart is not allowing their employees to unionize?”  His response was silence, and then, “your mother is not a liberal”.  No, she’s not.  But at least she’s got an 18-month supply of corn flakes.

       When you go to the zoo, what animal are you most excited to see? Why?  Ugh...the zoo.  I'm not a big fan of the zoo.  In my opinion all of the animals look tremendously sad and I feel bad for going and looking at them.  Before anyone jumps on me and says  'Jesus, you crumudgeon (sp?) lighten up!  The Minnesota Zoo is great for the animals.  They totally feel like they're right at home in their cages/pens/whatever!'   No they don't.  Seriously, take a survey and see which ones like living a confined life and which ones would like the get their ass outta Minnesota.  That being said, I guess I'll have to go with the tigers.  Just seeing the look they give the people who bang on the windows of their cage.  It's like:  'I could soooo eat you if I was out there.'     Come on now, cats or dogs? Why? (Yes, Hal, you have to pick one)...  I'm going to plead the 5th on this one.  For my living situation, I have no choice but to like dogs better (DJ LZ is allergic), but I had the greatest cat in the world before she came along, so I feel I'd be betraying his species if I didn't say I had a soft spot for cats as well.  Ah Kato...I hardly knew ye.  I gave him to a good home and he's happy where he's at.  If I had my cat still, I'd invite all of y'all to take the Pepsi Challenge with Kato.  He was a cat who didn't know he was a cat.  Affectionate, would fetch stuff and did this cute little dance whenever I came home.     Okay...that's enough.  I miss my lil' buddy.

       When you go to the zoo, what animal are you most excited to see? Why?  This shouldn't be too much of a shock to most of you, but I like  urlLink these little fellas .  They are so entertaining, although the monkey houses at zoos usually stink  a lot .  Did I mention my orangutan Einstein from Borneo?  He's cute too.   Come on now, cats or dogs? Why? (Yes, Hal, you have to pick one)...  Dogs.  No question.  But along the same lines as Hal, I HATE cats.  (Plus I'm allergic.)  Sorry, Duf.   urlLink Here's the dog  I would like to own sometime in the future when I have a big yard and kids to take care of it.  Yeah, like I'm going to pick up crap.

       When you go to the zoo, what animal are you most excited to see? Why?  Geeze, it’s been ages since I’ve been to the zoo… hmmm… I like a lot of the animals, but watching big animals like dolphins or whales in water is always cool.   Come on now, cats or dogs? Why? (Yes, Hal, you have to pick one)...  DOGS!  Not so much an attraction to dogs as much as an aversion to cats (sorry, Duf).  I secretly want a really tiny dog that I can carry around in my purse (like the lady in the allergy commercial), but I only think that that would work in NYC, so there goes that dream.

I've just typed the word NAKED far too many times for one post.  I had a bad day at work yesterday, so I laid in the dark last night, in my hotel room, with two glasses of wine (I couldn't decide whether I wanted cabernet or merlot)...naked.  Ok, no more naked stories.  At least today.    I would have done the Tuesday 2, but I'm afraid DJS has it out for me.

       Last Night I Dreamt that PB Kicked Me Off Pandyland/Musing on the Forgotten 2  By Duf Fer  Last night I dreamt that PB kicked me off Pandyland because my post (insert Freudian pun here - itself a Freudian pun) was too long. She was naked.    I felt sadness and cried.  Not because PB was naked, but because I like being on Pandyland.  Hal gave me an "I-recommended-you-for-this-job-and-you-can't-even-show-up-on-time-or-ease-up-on-the-internet-porn-so-they-have-to-fire-your-@$$" look.  I felt sadness and wept bitterly.  Not because I care what Hal thinks, but because she was so right.  I was wrong not to be on my best behavior when a friend recommended me for a web community.  When I woke up, I realized I had wet the bed (so typical).  I felt shame and flogged myself.  Not because I have a weak bladder, but because I was exiled and frightened.   Also, why did we not do the 2sday 2 yesterday?

       An April Fools Joke on Stoner  By Stoner  I just called up my sweetie to express my disappointment in the fact that he hasn't tried to play any April Fool's jokes on me today.  As it turns out...earlier today I received an email saying I needed to go to a web site to claim a lotto prize that I had missed. I didn't recognize the name of the sender so, being the good employee that I am, I forwarded it to our tech support. He told me not to click on the link - that the email was bait and I should delete it.  My sweetie thinks this is all hilarious. I knew he was the April Fools type - I was even expecting a prank. But I still fell for it.

       An April Fools Joke on Mrs. Duf Fer  By Duf Fer  Background:  J is my mother in law.  R is my brother in law and our financial advisor.  About 5 months ago, I tried to make a case for buying United Airlines stock.  Mrs. Duf Fer was reluctant and so was R.  This is the message I sent Mrs. Duf Fer about 5 minutes ago:   This morning, I was reading that philosophy book that J gave me and happened upon a quote that really made a lot to sense to me.  Keep the quote in mind as you read this e-mail:  A person really is less free once one learns servitude.    - Goethe  I have been thinking a lot about our financial future…and here goes…    This morning, I called your brother to talk about college basketball.  We got to talking about United airlines, and I asked him to purchase 4,000 shares of United Airline stock for us.  He agreed to do it, and the purchase will be made probably by 11:45 this morning (he was preparing some other buy tickets and thought he could have it done by then).    R was not too in favor of this purchase (Merrill analysts are saying short term is “sell” and long term is “sell”, but I really have a lot of confidence about this, and you know how conservative money managers are about the airline industry – Warren Buffet won’t touch it).  I’m sure you remember that United was trading at about $2.50 a couple of months ago when I originally had the idea. Today it is trading at 81 cents (so maybe you were right that we should not have bought it then).  Anyway, it is obvious that now is the time to buy.    The federal government has indicated that it might loan airlines some money so I think that’s a good sign.  Also, even though the United machinists union refuses to re-negotiate salary, I’m sure they will resolve with massive layoffs (like Northwest just did).  There are indications that United will embrace this strategy to get the costs savings they so desperately need.  Remember, United is the number two airline in America (in terms of routes) with key routes in the central transportation infrastructure and the O’Hare hub (which is a jewel).  Also, United is the official airline of the Oprah Winfrey show.  So, let’s look at the upside here.  Pre- September 11th, United was trading at about 30 dollars a share.  To be conservative, let’s assume it will go back to half that amount to $15 per share.  That means our investment today of about $3200 will turn into $60,000 for a profit of about $56,800.  Imagine what happens if it returns to $30 per share (which I’m sure it will).  We will end our financial servitude and know true freedom (focus on the Goethe quote; I think the answer is there).  Yes, there is a risk, but what’s $3,200 to us – it’s just sitting there mocking us – begging to be spent.  Don’t you think buying the stock is a better idea than buying a new sofa (given the potential return)?  Also, if you look at our portfolio, we don’t have any risky stuff.  We have overloaded on conservative investments, so this risk gives us better balance.    I think the part that may bug you most about this is not talking about it first.  Okay, I can explain that.  I feel so good about this decision that I just knew you would say yes anyway.  Also, when we talked about it before, you kind of said yes, so I felt comfortable giving the go ahead.     If this all blows up (which it won’t), I will give up half my allowance until the loss is returned to us with interest.  If you really don’t want to do this, call me by 11:45, and I will try to cancel with R.  Love,  Duf'  P.S.  Focus on the first letter in each word of the quote.  I think it's a code of some kind.

       Stoner’s Review of Omnifest.    My sweetie and I have officially gone to half of the movies at this year’s Omnifest at the Science Museum. (I feel so cultured.) We’ve seen Adrenaline Rush: The Science of Risk, Ocean Men: Extreme Dive, and The Great Barrier Reef. I was most excited for the last one – but unfortunately, I think it was filmed in the late seventies/early eighties. People actually laughed out loud. The narrator’s voice was very familiar – I remember it well from documentaries in eighth-grade science class. And it was extremely dramatic. Throughout, there were interviews with a couple who looove the ocean, and call the Great Barrier Reef their second home. They’re very concerned about the damage that humans are doing (as they pull themselves along on the coral and step on it) and have befriended many fish (which they pet – these are fish – they have no fur). My sweetie and I agreed, most of the aquatic life around them looked terrified. My favorite quote of the movie came when the woman (who looks and sounds just like Olivia Newton-John) picked up a sleeping fish. As it started to wake up and freak out, she shoved it back into its sponge-y hiding place. In this very surreal, sweet voice she said “see – you can pick up the fish and they hardly notice. This one is starting to stir a bit. Perhaps when it wakes up, it will think this was all just some horrible nightmare.” (Insert sweet, Glinda-the-good-witch smile here.) Yes, she must really love those fish.  Whoa. That was quite the long post. I’m impressed with myself.   Must...rest...now...

       Rant   So I'm sitting here on a Friday night posting to a blog...God, I'm a rock star. Anyhoo, I've got a few things on my mind and I often stop to think and reflect about the things that I have seen, experienced and hope for the future. I've always been a "heavy thinker" so much so that my mom told me when I was young that one day I might grow up to have an ulcer. (All right! Something to look forward to!) I had a very "heavy thinking" week this past week. I get bogged down with people's expectations of me, my expectations of others, and my fears and insecurities. I've realized that this isn't a good time. I don't want to think about those things so much anymore. This is easier said than done, but I'm trying. Take a deep breath, trust in God and just let it go.   Sorry to get a little heavy on you, but I feel better. Thanks.  And on to the F5:  1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   I think being a kind, loyal soul would be nice. Oh and the effing hot chic bass playah this town has evah seen...rock.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   At this moment: don't worry, be happy.    3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   Moving past bad relationship moments and finding joy in loving someone.    4. What about the past ten years?   Oof...there are a lot of big and small victories over the past 10 years, can't point out just one. I would say the most meaningful moments have come from relationships - finding love, enduring love, losing love and starting all over again. It's humbling and empowering in the same minute.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?   Don't be afraid to jump in with both feet. Oh and if you aren't a rock star, you're nobody. rock on.

       My movie comments and 5 -    Right on, Panda,  Keeping the Faith  is one of my (not so) guilty pleasure movies.  It's no masterpiece, but I really loved it.  It totally lacks cynicism, and I think that's why it stands out.  I also saw  Rules of Attraction  not so long ago... I thought it completely sucked.  Sorry, but Dawson on the crapper does not equal art.  I read the book (for some reason I am repelled and yet strangly attracted to BEE's books, but that's another post for another time) and it wasn't much better.  Last night I  urlLink watched this  and found it to be excellent.  It has been so raved about in the press that I was ready for a big let down.  Go see it.  Claire Danes is BACK!  Also, a few nights ago I watched a couple of episodes from season four of  urlLink Sex and the City .  It was a lot of the same (Big or Aidan, Aiden or Big, etc.), but there was one episode that was beyond great - Miranda's mom suddenly died, and the three other girls go to Philly for the funeral.  I was blown away by how good it was (and I cried like a baby...).  It said more about not only female friendship, but how we deal with grief than anything I've seen before.  That show is a good one.  On to the q's...   1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   You mean I get to pick?  Alright – remember that I’m kind and funny.  Make that very kind and very funny.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   ”It is what it is”   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   About 9 months ago I was part of a work “shake up” that felt like a very big deal at the time, and now seems like so little so long ago.  I learned a lot from the entire experience (I still am, really), and that feels good.   4. What about the past ten years?   In the last ten years I have graduated from both high school and college, and done all those other things that one typically does from the age of 17 to 27.  They are pretty “meaty” years as far as personal growth and achievement… can’t pick out a small list from that.  But suffice it to say – I’m happy with where I’m at.    5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  Smile. :)

       The Heavy Five and that Ain't No Jive [with closed circuit comments to PB]  By Fer, Duf   1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   Being a nice person and the father of the first person to land on Mars or cure cancer or both (like cure cancer with cancer-fighting gel discovered while exploring Mars).   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   [PB, I loved your quote.  My grandmother used to say "in order to really clean up, you have to make a mess."]  But the quote that best fits my outlook is "...isn't it worth missing whatever joy you might have dreamed, to wake in the night and find you and your beloved are holding hands in your sleep?"  Because, to me, it speaks to the need to find happiness in the real world and the everyday and in the bonds we all have with others, be they friends or lovers.   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   Nearing full implementation with a challenging project at work.  Close second:  last year around this time, I got an eagle on a long par five (three wood, four iron and 15 foot putt).   4. What about the past ten years?   No question:  becoming a father.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  [PB, not to get all heavy on you, but I think it is impossible to have a relationship of consequence/depth and not make someone cry. Could we add the words "ever mean to" in front of "make you cry"?].  My advice:  "always make the decisions that make you happy, that limit hurt to others and that give you the most options; if you pursue nothing else, pursue happiness, but don't do so selfishly."  Close second:  "stay sucka free, baby."  SSH (sorry so heavy), Duf'

       It's Been a Movie Marathon   I've watched a ridiculous number of movies this week.  Let me separate the good from the bad for you, in case you find yourself in the video store this weekend and don't know what to rent:   urlLink  Secretary  : liked it a lot.  I actually cried a bit at the end even though it was a creepy S&M type love story.  But I think Maggie Gyllenhaal is adorable.   urlLink  Slackers  : good, but not that memorable.  I rented it because of my love for Jason Schwartzman.  He plays a very convincing stalker.   urlLink  Vulgar  : disturbing on so many levels.  Being a Viewaskew production from Kevin Smith, I had high hopes for this film.  Especially with Brian O'Hallaran (Dante from Clerks) as the wacko clown.  If it wasn't for the cameos from Kevin Smith (as a gay TV producer - really funny!) and Jason Mewes (as his slacker-self), I would have turned this off after the first 15 minutes.   urlLink  Pecker  : my favorite of the rentals.  Funny and quirky.  Memama's (the crazy grandma) obsessive idolatry put me over the edge.  She made a Virgin Mary statue talk, using her own voice ("Full of Grace!  Full of Grace!"), and claimed it as a  miracle .  I think even my mom would laugh at that one.   urlLink  Blue Car  : good, but depressing.  Saw this in the theater...I'd call it "Lolita-lite".   urlLink  Keeping the Faith  : I was surprisingly delighted by this.  Edward Norton and Ben Stiller make a great combo.  My favorite scene was when Edward Norton's character set himself on fire when using the insense-thingy in church.     urlLink  Rules of Attraction  : funny to see the usually squeaky-clean WB actors turn towards the dark side.  Unsettling, but oddly intriguing.  These kids take debauchery to a whole other level.  Dawson Leary as a drug dealer?  F-ing great.

       Too heavy for Pandyland?  What the hell...   The Insomniac's Friday Five  by Panda   1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   I would like to be remembered as a risk taker who always loved bravely, laughed loudly, and lived without regrets.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   I remember my grandfather once saying, “You have to plan for the good times, because the bad make their own arrangements.”  When you have things to look forward to, life can’t get any sweeter.   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   There are 2: getting my MBA and walking away from a wedding/marriage that was bound to make me miserable.   4. What about the past ten years?   With each year, comes less guilt about not meeting my parents’ expectations of me.  This has been a long process, but I am finally starting to figure out what I want out of life, without looking for the acceptance of the people around me.  Sometimes it’s not easy being an over-achieving, people-pleasing, Catholic girl.  And on a side note: when thinking about all the crazy shit I’ve done in the last 10 years, I’m just glad I’m still  alive .   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  In general, you should always listen to your gut instinct.  99% of the time, it’s right.  To all the girls out there: No man is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry.

      Hey, Bassy... I haven't seen "BA", but if I hear one more stupid story about how people are calling the phone number for God (apparently listed in the film) I am going to scream.  I just don't care that some lady in Idaho is getting 20 calls a day from people asking, "Is God there?"  Is there nothing else going on the world?  Apparently not.    Besides, I think it's all a publicity stunt by the film's studio.  Who sits in a movie theater and jots down a fictitious phone number to crank once the credits roll?  Not me.  And if other people do, that's great... just don't dedicate partial newscasts to this supposed epidemic.  Because, as stated before, I don't care.  And DJS... you officially suck.

It's fantastic outside today! I'd like to go to the movies sometime soon. Now I can't keep up with all the art-y indie flicks that Panda enjoys but some friends of mine said "Bruce Almighty" was pretty funny. Anybody see it yet?

      Hal, that's funny you bring up that important topic.  T and I went to my  urlLink new favorite neighborhood bar  last Saturday.  Since I had spent the whole day on a boat, steadily drinking, I vowed to T that I would only have a salad and Diet Coke and we would just "hang out."  I did order my salad and DC, and we were just hanging out, until some guys came over to talk with us, one of them strikingly resembling Prince William. (Of course, I had to tell him that fact.  At first he thought I was talking about Prince Charles..."No!  The hot son of the late Princess Diana, you fool!")    All of a sudden I had the urge to order a round of shots for everyone.  Must be something about royalty and alcohol.  It's like a drug for me.    The night only got messy after this.  We ended up stopping by a sex shop, and we learned the lesson that it's illegal for women to go to "the back of the store" - where the peep shows are.  For some reason, that seems ass-backwards to me.  Then, when we got to Monsignor Murphy's, one of the guys we were with decides to perform his own  urlLink "Puppetry of the Penis"  (the ancient art of genital origami) show for a bunch of 40-something women.  Nothing like mixing tequila with penis tricks.  And his fiance thought it was a riot.  Hal, you have to move to Chicago, if only for the stories.  But to answer your question, I'm a Wills Girl...or at least A Guy Resembling Wills Girl.

      Today I've been mulling over important decisions... like  urlLink Prince William or Prince Harry ?  The eternal question - the good boy, or the bad one?  According to  The Sun , Britain's  premier  tabloid,  "If Harry were in a movie he’d be the baddie all the girls fancied who turns out to have a big heart after all. Think Top Gun’s Iceman."   Somehow, I don't buy it.  But if it's selling papers, more power to them.

       To The Strength...To Go The Length, Thinking You Are First When You Really Are Tenth?     1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  I like going to the ocean.  I know that's pretty general, but it's true.  I don't care if I'm in Oregon, Ca-li-for-ni-a, or even on the east coast, seeing that much water crashing into the delicious land does something for me.  But, if I were to make a full-on decision, I guess I'd say I like seeing the ocean from the Santa Monica pier.  I've been there a bunch of times and I find it pretty difficult to turn around and go back where I came from.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not very well-traveled...yet.   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)   I remember going to California when we were kids and believe it or not, the trip to the actual state aboard the plane went without a hitch.  It was when we landed and tried to find (in my dad's words) the 'son of a bitchin' hotel.'  I kid you negative when I say we spent a good 2.5 hours in the car, exhausted from the flight, listening to my dad go apeshit in the front seat while he told Mama Shovelpants 'he knew where he was going, goddammit.'  Other than that, I've got nothing horrible to report...at least to that destination.   3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)   I've got a few.  Philidelphia - I took a roadtrip with a previous girlfriend and we made all of our hotel arrangements over the phone.  I never understood how this was done because you never really know what kind of place you're getting yourself into.  So, we were going to Philly to see Madonna on her last tour and we booked a room in a hotel that was like 3 stars or something.  Not bad, right?  Wrong.  When we got there, the place was being totally renovated...and not for the better of the hotel.  The swimming pool (which it announced online as being open and beautiful) hadn't had any water in it since 1973.  The elevator up to the room looked like it had been shot up with bullets and beaten with a sledgehammer.  It creaked and farted as we went up to the 10th floor.  I thought, 'Well...at least our room will be okay.'  Right?  Wrong again, suckerhead.  I am not even kidding when I say it looked like there had been a homicide in our room.  There were unidentifiable stains on the carpet, a real mildewy smell to the place, ratty bedspreads, shitty artwork from a dying/starving artists sale, and a view of the 'hood.'  For a couple of very white-bread 20-somethings, this wasn't good.  The kicker was that I had driven straight through from Minnecrapolis to this shithole with about an 1.5 hours of sleep.  This was supposed to be my oasis...my pot o' gold at the end of the interstate rainbow.  'Twas not to be.  I looked the place over and was horrified at what I saw.  Old chips and shit under the bed intermingled with dust-bunnies.  Behind one of the pieces of art, I noticed some maroon-colored splatter marks.  I've read a lot of true crime books, kids...I know what that is.  Blood.  From the looks of it, someone blew their brains out all over the wall and the cleaning staff must've given it a quick wipe with a Wet-0ne.  Needless to say, we got the hell out of Dodge and found a nicer, more expensive hotel.  We even got free cookies.  The second one was when I helped my friend Jay move to Orlando, Florida.  Not only did I get a $212.00 speeding ticket in Sconie (oooh, I hate that) but once we got into Florida, we got in possibly the worst (and almost deadly) accident ever.  In the left lane, some ass-clown hit (and killed) a dog.  He slammed on his brakes and came to a complete stop.  As such, the cars behind him (us included) we screwed.  To Jay's credit, he swerved out of the left lane and saved us from a nasty rear-end collision.  The bad part is, we clipped a minivan which sent us spinning across 4 lanes of busy Florida traffic.  Let me repeat that.  We SPUN across 4 lanes of traffic.  At one point, I could see the cars coming down the freeway directly at us as we spun off and landed ass-backwards in the ditch.  Neither of us was hurt and amazingly, no one else, save the dog, was killed.  No doubt about it, it sucked.  The thing that made me most mad was that the asshole who started the 7-8 car pileup drove off before the cops came.  Some people...

      Yeah, I don't really agree with Maddox's review at all.  I thought some of the crap he said was pretty funny, but all in all there really wasn't any basis in his qualms with the movie.  But yeah...no one needed to see Keanu's ass.  That's just irresponsible.

       1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  When I haven’t been home in awhile, I love landing at the Minneapolis airport and feeling like I’m home again, or if traveling by car, exiting from the freeway and being “almost there”.  Sometimes it’s more exciting than leaving in the first place.   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)  I’m probably jinxing myself, but I have incredible good luck in travel.  The glaring exception was on a commuter train one night in London.  Because of a problem with the tracks earlier in the day, the Thameslink train we used to get from central London to our ‘burb was unbelievably packed, even at 11:30pm on a weeknight.  The platform was jammed, and when the second-to-last train came up, it was chaos trying to get on.  None of the four of us could fight our way onto it.  When we realized that the last train was on its way, we were ready to kill or maim our way onto it, as the alternative was waiting at the cold station until the first train at 4:30am.  We risked massive internal injuries, shoved past even the most jaded Londoners, and barely squeezed onto the train.  It was a claustrophobic’s worst nightmare – flying through underground tunnels in an over-packed train car.  Once on, the four of us shared looks of great relief, even if we could hardly breathe – the ride from King’s Cross to our stop was just 17 minutes total, including a handful on stops in between.  We figured the worst was over – we were on the train, and the crowded situation could only improve with each stop as people got off.  Unfortunately, things got much worse before the first stop.  Some guy a couple feet away from me had enjoyed too much red wine (from the look and smell of it) and started puking.  Some lady cried out, “OH, GOD!” and then there was massive groaning, and then I remember the stench hitting me.  Horrible.  One of my companions, Mikey, was closer to the “action” and he looked as though he was going to die.  Somehow in that impossibly tight space, the drunk puker was given his own open space.  I still don’t know how this was physically possible.  People must have crawled onto each others shoulders.  Eww.  It was the worst 15 minutes of travel I’ve ever experienced.   3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)  Again, I’ve been pretty lucky.  The worst places I’ve stayed have been some lower-end youth hostels (others were not too bad), and while they were not nightmares, I remember showering in a gross hostel in Rome and realizing that I was somehow getting dirtier.  On that same trip we were accosted a few times in various cities by little gypsy girls.  It was totally sad – they were obviously well trained at a young age.  And no matter how mean these kids were, you just can’t up a smack a little girl.  Which is probably why they clean up as thieves (or at least they did with us).

       1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?   Thailand.  Why?  The people are some of the friendliest on earth, the food kicks you in the ass (in a good way - spicy!), there are mountains  and  beaches, everything is dirt cheap - from hotels and food to fake Burberry purses, and the great live sex shows.  (Just kidding about that last one...although, according to the "menus" I was presented with, you'd be surprised what those women can do - pussy shoot banana anyone?)   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)   Oh my God.  Until recently, y'all know I've been traveling at least 50% of the time for my job...that ups the odds that  something  horrible could go wrong.  The first winter I traveled for this job, my plane was late (coming AND going)  every single time .  One time, they brought us out on the tarmac (this was, of course, to keep the stat of "on time departure").  We then sat on the runway for 3-1/2 hours.  They only gave us water.  People were irate.  It was anarchy.  We ended up not even taking off and drove back to the gate.  The flight was delayed until the next morning and there were no hotels available.  Absolute nightmare.   3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)   9/11.  Saw the second building get hit and the horror in people's faces.  We couldn’t fly, so I roadtripped back to Chicago with 2 guys (a 50-year-old flaming homosexual and a chain-smoking Columbian) I didn’t know from our LA office and we slept in the same hotel room together (the only one left) in Toledo, OH.  Enough said.

       1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  I would say Alaska.  I like that there are different rules there (the shortest distance between two points may not be a straight line; you can golf at midnight sometimes), and I love that everything there is so big, so grand and so unspoiled.  I have only been once, but I would like to go back.  I not a big repeat traveler, and I would like to go to so many other places, but it is difficult for me to imagine a time when Alaska does not hold a special place in my heart.    2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)  Not really except that I learned the hard way that the shortest distance between two points in not necessarily a straight line.  When the "highway" I took originally was jam packed with potholes that you could sink a basketball in (no, I'm not kidding).    3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)  One, I got pick-pocketed in Chicago.  I called the police, and they were all like "what do you want us to do?"  When I got back to Kansas my wallet was in the mail (with all of it's credit cards and none of its cash) with a nice note saying "I saw a man throw this in a trash can and thought you might like it back.  Happy New Year!"

I did Key Lime Pie shots with my friend Mark last night...this will soon be added to my weekly regimen.  In the meantime, have a fantastic holiday weekend.  I'm seeing Old School at the Vic tonight after dinner (again, more training), will possibly be on a boat on Saturday if the weather cooperates (this is when the training is brought up another notch - the "long run", if you will), Girls' Night on Saturday (sprint training), the Sox game on Sunday  afternoon at Comisky (slow & steady training starting at 1:05pm), and my day off on Monday (maybe catch an indy film).

       No Friday Love   What's up with the no posts today? Are you guys actually working? Here's a Fun Friday 3 to get you a-postin...  1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  Las Vegas is one. I just love staying in fun hotels with lots of amenities and things to do. Vegas has TONS of them, so I've always stayed in a new hotel each visit and each one so far has been distinct, from the kitsch-y, cheap Imperial Palace to the luxury of the Mirage. Another favorite destination is Hawaii. Now I've only been there once (just a few months ago!), but I can definitely see myself continually going back. It's gorgeous and relaxing, but save your pennies...   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, ridiing bus, etc.)  I've been pretty lucky with travel services so far in my life, but during one Christmas vacation a few years ago I was driving to see my boyfriend who lived in Chicago. I decided to drive from Mpls by myself. Unfortunately, a snow storm started on the day I left and it was awful. Normally, an easy drive down I-94 averaging about 75 mph and getting there in about 6 hours, was turned into a drive down Hell's Alley. Ok, maybe that's a tad dramatic but it's pretty hard to drive 40 mph, by yourself, gripping the steering wheel tensely the entire way, and no more than half mile visibility in front of you while passing cars and trucks turned over on both sides of the road. It took me 12 hours to arrive in chicago. oi.    3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)  When I was in college, I took the typical "Spring Break 95!" trip to a sunny Mexico destination. The hotel was a hot bed of college co-eds, unfortunately the hotel pool was an indication of how hot the hot bed was. GROSS. yick. ew.

       1) Tell me about your neighbors.   We live on the end of a string of four townhouses, so there's only a neighbor on one side.  I don't think the two women who live there, like us all that much.  Here's my theory:  On Monday nights a group of my friends (okay, two) come over and we play video games.  DJ LZ heads upstairs to the safety of our bedroom while we hash out our battles, quests, typical video game nerd shit.  During the course of the evening, I've been known to holler: "You whore!  Son of a bitch!  Oh you piece of shit!  F--- You!, etc."  You get the picture.  Sometimes, I slam my hand down on the couch in frustration and I groan like the world is ending.  I think they might think that the Soon-To-Be-Mrs. Shovelpants and I are in an abusive relationship.  It probably didn't help that I would kickbox out in the garage either.  The only other neighbors I'm aware of is the guy who has so much crap piled up in his garage that he literally has a narrow corridor that leads to his back door.  He walks his dog to the mailbox, where it pisses all over the side of the box.  He doesn't want to damage his yard, you know!  Then there's the guy who puts on his Rollerblades to skate to the mailbox to get his mail, then rolls on back.  At least he says 'hi.'   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.   Best - The weather.  (sun, warmth, etc.) Least - The weather.  (rain, gloom, filth, etc.)   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partner…you can fantasize here).   That's easy...in lieu of Salma Hayek, I prefer a mate of the female variety who has big striking blue eyes, a smile that almost makes you want to cry because she makes you so happy.  One with rotten taste in music and movies.  I find that so damn cute!  My mate would be from Mankato, have one brother, one sister, drink watery Michelob Golden Draft Light, pronounce 'hot dogs' funny, steal all my good lines, 'set' puzzles instead of 'put them together', have every line of 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' memorized, and would be a whiz with budgeting and keeping my shit in check.

       Thursday 3 in the hizzause...My first questionnaire!   1) Tell me about your neighbors.  I have neighbors on one side of my apartment. I'm on a corner unit. And they seem like nice folks except for the loud music at very early hours. They also have a friend that lives in the building who comes by their apt. to visit quite often and rings the doorbell whenever she stops by. It's kinda like a dorm for them...ahh dorm life *nostalgia surge* the days when you could stumble "home" after a drunken adventure by simply following the hallway walls.   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.  Most favorite: I have to agree with Panda. I love the smell in the air -- lilacs especially. And it's the season before my favorite, Summer. What can I say? I like it hot.  Least favorite: my work building turns on the air conditioning in spring, so it's not only sometimes cold outside, it's freezing inside all the time. I hate it. My fingers are losing mobility as I type...this...now.   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partner…you can fantasize here).   I'm a sucker for musicians, big time. The creativity, passion, focus, and drive are all highly attractive qualities for me. Actually it doesn't necessarily have to be music. A spark for something creative is a turn-on. Something that puts a "fire under his butt" (Credit: Christine) I also like it when he turns that passion into a life-goal and makes it a priority to perform. It's such a treat to watch someone perform well. Other qualities include being a warm personality, genuinely nice person and organized. A good conversationalist and a down-to-earth guy who's interested in my mind  and  body. ; )

       What do they do with the stuff that they cut/pump out?  BB, thanks for bringing up "Extreme Makeover" – I guess someone had too.  I actually like the show as well… although I have to look away whenever they show a nose job being performed - it’s just too much to see them hammer and slice away.  I also agree that it’s well done considering that when you boil it all down, the message of the show is that if you just looked better, you will be happier.  But you know what?  The fact of life is that these people are going to be treated differently by the world as "afters" then they were treated as "befores".  I’m not against plastic surgery (unless you’re Phyllis Diller) and I’m certainly not against reality TV.  So why not "Extreme Makeover"?  On to the serious business…   1) Tell me about your neighbors.  Well, there’s not much to say – the weirdoes across the hall got evicted, and there were the only neighbors that were really on my radar.  I guess that makes me a bad person – I need to reach out to the many others on the second floor.   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.  Best, the longer days.  Least, that road construction is just beginning…   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partner…you can fantasize here).  Oh, dear.  Faithful readers may remember that I couldn’t describe my dream house… and I don’t think I could do any better with describing my dream guy.  Suffice it to say, I know when I see what I like.  Take, for instance,  urlLink Michael Vartan ... just a random example, of course.

       1) Tell me about your neighbors.   Our neighbors are Henry and Carlotta.  They are retired.  They are very, very nice.  They drink a lot. They are pack rats, but they are very, very nice.  There has been a racoon stalking around our neighborhood.  Two nights ago, Henry shot her with a .22.  Can I get an Atticus Finch casting call one time?  Our neighbors to the West...not much to say except I have never (as in not once) seen them open their curtains.  Once they brought over mail that was delivered to them inadvertently, so if they are chopping people up in there, I would tell the TV news "I'm shocked..they seemed so nice...they kept to themselves and always mowed their lawn in a timely fashion."   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.   Most: It is the beginning of golf season.  For me, that is the best part by far.  I also like the baby animals that are around, the return of flowers, and the fragrance of lilacs in the air.  But don't kid yourself, it's 98% golf.    Least:  It ends with summer, when it is too darn hot (can I get some AC up in this mug?).   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partner…you can fantasize here).   I can fantasize here, huh?  Easy for you to say!  Let me just say I like the maternal type, gardeners get extra points, a woman who will golf with me and tolerate my foolishness and sloth.  I favor girls from small college towns who have strong local family ties and a fiscally conservative bent.  They should be about 5 feet 8 inches tall an laugh at my jokes (selectively).

       You Go Girl!   I won't even lie:  I am going check  urlLink this  at least 100 times this morning.  I hope she does really well too.    I have always thought that golf could be like marathon running, and that men and women could be on the same course at the same time.  I won't suggest that her one tournament performance will settle the argument once and for all, but I will hope like crazy that she does well and gets her due praise.

       I'm a Junkie   I can't get enough. I'm addicted. I'm hooked. I need my...Reality TV. Last night I spent 2 hours happily flipping through American Idol, The Bachelor and Extreme Makeover. And I was depressed when it was all over and it was time to go to bed. I'm pathetic but I'm enjoying these shows so I don't care if you think I'm pathetic. The world is a harsh place and find happiness where you can is my motto. (I have a motto now!?)  American Idol was interesting for the last 15 minutes when they cut the crap and announced the winner. But I must disagree with Panda in that Clay did not get robbed. He clearly is a talented singer and I think he would be perfect for Broadway and theater. But he always reminds me of the kid from MAD Magazine when I look at him, with a delivery that was a bit too dramatic for me. I was happy when Ruben took the title as I enjoyed hearing him sing in every performance.   The Bachelor was good. I won't bore you with the deets. It's been my guilty pleasure this spring. Don't hate.  And finally, the most enjoyable hour is Extreme Makeover. Have any of you seen this show?? It's awesome. They take real people who have been unhappy with their body, bone structure, teeth, hair, makeup, everything and make them over. Now you must be wondering "Why would Bass Babe like such a superficial show, promoting looks over personality?" Why? I'll tell you. The people chosen are normal, everyday people, not rich, snobby types who need to look younger for their television careers (Joan Rivers, a perfect example of hideousness.) The people chosen are folks you would know in your neighborhood who have some serious problems and have dealt with ridicule & shame their entire lives. Now you can say "Hey who cares what people think! Be happy with what God gave you!" that may be true in an ideal world, but c'mon we've all felt uncomfortable with our looks at some point and these people feel uncomfortable ALL the time. They can get anything they want if chosen for this show: plastic surgery, lipo, dental work, Lasik, personal trainer sessions, fashion, hair and makeup consultants. and it's amazing the transformations. They are so happy that it kinda makes you get a little teary. And in the updates of previous winners at the end of the show, all are still so happy and have made real efforts in changing their attitudes and confidence. it's pretty cool. So I ask you fellow Pandylandaz, would you ever consider changing your looks (body and/or face) in the Extreme?  Me: If I were chosen and I didn't have to pay anything, I  might   get my nose worked on, as I've never been real happy with my fleshy button nose. I'd also get my teeth straightened and whitened. I'd like the fashion, makeup and hair too.   sorry for the long post.  BB

       I Think I'm Going to Hyperventilate   I just found out tickets go on sale on June 7th for the Ben Folds/Tori Amos show here in Chicago on Sunday, August 10th.  Never in a million years would I have put these 2 on the same stage, but I suppose it makes sense since they both play piano.  OK, I gotta go breathe into a paper bag or something.  If I don't post for the next 24 hours, please call the paramedics...or maybe by that time, the coroner.

       Clay Got Robbed: He Clearly Was the Better Voice   America decided – and it came down to a mere difference of 130,000 votes out of 24 million.    But this is what really pisses me off about our society (and the show):  Ruben = “Velvet Teddy Bear” who wins American Idol and gets a record contract out of the deal. If Ruben was a woman = “Fat Pig” who is told she needs to go on a diet if she’s ever  really  going to make it big.  WTF is with this double standard?  It makes me so damn mad.

       This Damn Insomnia Strikes Again:  “Tell Me…” - The Thursday Three  by Panda   1) Tell me about your neighbors.   I’ve had many neighbors throughout my years here on Lake Shore Dr.  There used to be a guy next to me I called “coughing guy” who sounded like he was coughing up a lung throughout the night.  Right now, the guy who lives next to me I call “LP Trixie guy” because he always has some dumb broad(s) over whose voice wakes me up in the middle of the night.  “Like, do you remember that scene in Happy Days, where…”  No lie, I just heard the Trixie say this and it sounded as if she was actually in my apartment – it was that audible.  He also has a lot of sex with these chicks.  That’s the last thing I need to hear right now.  Then, of course, who could forget bald, gay, drug-dealing Bill who used to live across the hall from me.  The clowns who live there now share something with Bill – they just got an eviction notice taped to their door a couple days ago.  Good riddance; their Rottweiler-sized dog scares the crap out of me.  Then there’s “bird guy” down the hall whose bird is always squawking when I’m waiting for the elevator.  “Old Guy”, on the other side, has lived here even longer than I have.  We both are early-risers and often make small talk in the elevator about the weather.   2) Tell me what you like best and least about Spring.   Best = The smell in the air.  It’s glorious.  And I love the first pedicure of the season…that’s when you can truly say good-bye to old man winter.  Least = The fashion confusion.  I never know when I can “officially” start wearing Capri pants and sandals and am not allowed to wear wool sweaters anymore.  On the really weird weather days I’ll pair wool pants and flip flops together.  I’m a mess.   3) Tell me about your ideal mate (not necessary to describe your current partner…you can fantasize here).   First things first: he’s gotta have a quick wit and make me laugh hysterically.  The rest is just frosting on the cake.  Spontaneity is important considering my “uber-planning” ways; it helps even me out.  There’s nothing sexier than a guy who can take a last minute trip or spontaneous “sick day” with me.  Having a lot of the same musical tastes always helps.  He would also send me flowers at work (or maybe meet me for lunch with a single dendrobium orchid).  Having been very close to getting married, I know having the same life goals really goes a long way as well.  I usually go for guys who are a little awkward, but not in a “he’s a project” sort of way.  More in an endearing way…his pants might be a little too big, or he wears Chuck Taylor’s with shorts, or he may have goofy sideburns, or he may trip when he goes to open the door for me.  I definitely do not like “slicksters.”  You know, the guys who are so smooth and know all the ways to woo a woman into the sack.  These guys make me really uncomfortable and I can smell them a mile away.  I also don’t fall for money (although it can be fun for a while).  Stability and security is important, but all that "stuff" is just temporary.  What would you do if he lost his job and it was just you, him, and an empty room?  He better be able to entertain me with nothing.  That’s what I want: to be able to be in an empty room with him, with no distractions, and have everything I need.

You are loved here; don't blow it!  I agree that we need a PBJ3 ASAP!  I am down for whatever, but after the Coldplay-in-Chicago sell with Mrs. Duf, it would probably be easier if we did a Minneapolis/St. Paul jam (tee hee).  My favorite song is  Ashes of American Flags  - this line alone makes it a fav:  "I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck!"  I'm quoting BTW.

I think it would be a great idea to reconvene as a group...perhaps the weekend of August 9th (I'm coming to the Twin Cities anyway)...or maybe all y'all can come on down to Milwaukee to see Wilco at Summerfest on Thursday, July 3rd.  I know Hal and I will be there for sure.  Speaking of Wilco, Duf - I just broke down and bought  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot .  The building pictured on the first and last page of the liner notes is Billygoat's old apartment.  Weird.  I made Rob put it in our community CD player here at work and am thoroughly enjoying it so far.  What's your favorite song (if you can pick one)?

This is a big step for a girl like me, but I think I'm ready. Ok, let's get started....I'm feeling pretty good. Oh yeah, this feels great! You want to hear more? Wait...oh my...whoa! that's a mighty big...POST you got there. I don't know if I can keep up with the size of these things. I think I need a rest now. Yeah, maybe I'll try again later today. Thanks so much for understanding.  Regards, Bass Babe

       The Profundity of Parenthood  By Duf Fer  TinyE, the pride and joy of Duf and Mrs. Duf, has entered a new phase.  She loves music.  Loves it!  But friends, she does not love the same music as Duf yet (she turns her nose up to Radiohead.  Radiohead!  Young people today...but I digress).  She loves children's music (and lots of it).  It can be pretty cool.  For example, Putamayo has a collection that plays like the best cartoons - it works on a level that kids really respond to, and there is substance for the adult audience too.  But, sadly, children's music (like children's lit) can also be lousy and horrible like Chinese water torture (drip, drip).  For example, Mother Duf (TinyE's grandmama) bought TinyE a collection of songs, rounds and spirituals including such classics as "Clementine" (I could little describe the extent of it awfulness)and "Are You Sleeping Brother John" and "Shanandoah" (which I must confess is a Duf' favorite - both on the disc and otherwise).  The problem with the collection from Mother Duf is that it has 61 songs on it (not a typo, that's 61 - under the "O", six, one), and it is like nicotine for the toddler set.  Once they start on it, there is the initial coughing fit and burning sensation and then they're hooked.  Here is a sample of one song:  Go-d said "Noah There's going to be a floody, floody" Go-d said "Noah There's going to be a floody, floody Get Those Chil- dren [clap] Out of the muddy, muddy... Children  uh-of the Luh-ord!"  And it's exactly like a song that a co-worker whistles or hums or sings that gets stuck in your head all day.  ALL DAY!"  From the Putamayo collection though, there is a really great song called "Just Keep Goin' On."  It is sung by a Blues artist named Eric Bibb. It has a verse I like quite a lot:  Just keep goin' on Just keep goin' on Just keep goin' ah-on Just keep goin' on Treat every knock as a boost and every stumblin' block as a steppin' stone Lift up your head Hold your own Just keep goin' on  That's what's in my head today.  Call me, I'll sing a verse.

       DJS Rather...get it?  Instead of Dan Rather.  Oh...shut up, you.    1) Would you rather live in a world...  a) Where the handshake was replaced by the act of grabbing another's genitals, giggling, and bouncing up and down  b) Where all international disputes were settled by means of break-dancing contests?   Breakdancing contests.  Why?  Because you just know some genitals don't always have that fresh smell to them.  I'd be constantly washing my hands and well...my gentials if that were the case.  Plus, it would be fun to see our elected officials break out the cardboard and unzip the sides of their parachute pants to get down to business.   2) Would you rather...   a) have a sinus infection where anytime you sneeze while in the presence of others, they change sex  b) have the inability to distinguish between babies and English muffins?  (Things to consider: grocery shopping, buttering, watching a football game during allergy season)   I'd definitely pick 'b.'  Not only do I love English Muffins, I find babies absolutely delicious.      3) Would you rather have to always wear...   moon boots or a sombrero?   Sombrero.  It's great.  You can look all mysterious in it and you can set it on the ground for an impromptu dance.  Plus, you can hide stuff in the top and all kinds of things.  Hell, I'd carry a sandwich up there for later enjoyment.   4) Would you rather live in a world...   a) Where massive Afros were mandatory for members of Congress  b) Where it was legal, in fact encouraged, to crucify mimes?   If the breakdancing thing from up above went into effect, it would just add to the fun if these stiff pricks had to wear afros besides.  Oh...what a beautiful world.

(Things to consider: grocery shopping, buttering, watching a football game during allergy season)   I would pick b.  First, what happened if I sneezed in bed?  Also, I feel that, even with my incredible love of the English muffin, I could stop myself each time I was about to butter one up.  I could also be more complimentary of all babies "she's so cute...I'd like to split her with a fork, butter her up and broil her."   3) Would you rather have to always wear...   moon boots or a sombrero?   I live in Minnesota and would pick the boots because most of the year they would go unquestioned.  BUT, my feet would stink so bad in the summer, the only Christian response is the sombrero.   4) Would you rather live in a world...   a) Where massive Afros were mandatory for members of Congress b) Where it was legal, in fact encouraged, to crucify mimes?

To see George Bush do the worm would be priceless.   2) Would you rather...       a) have a sinus infection where anytime you sneeze while in the presence of others, they change sex       b) have the inability to distinguish between babies and English muffins?  (Things to consider: grocery shopping, buttering, watching a football game during allergy season)  Definitely "a".  Because the alternative is too horrific.     3) Would you rather have to always wear...       moon boots or a sombrero?   I'd wear a sombrero...as long as it's the "urban sombrero".  Plus, it would protect my face from the sun.   4) Would you rather live in a world...       a) Where massive Afros were mandatory for members of Congress       b) Where it was legal, in fact encouraged, to crucify mimes?   Afros in Congress...I'd be more interested than ever in politics.

       Truck Stop Transvestite Cock-sucking Whore   That was the name of one of the songs an "open-miker" played last night.  Before he sang this "ballad", he explained how he was divorced twice.  Gee, who couldn't live with a guy who was  so  eloquent?  But I digress...let me tell you about  urlLink the greatest movie I've seen in a long time .  Now, before you start rolling your eyes thinking, "oh Lord, we've heard this before," (Hal, I  know  you're thinking about "The Fast Runner" - Inuits rule, btw) you have to hear me out.  Absolutely tremendous.  And it was rated G.  It's a documentary that follows 8 different kids on their way to the National Spelling Bee in Washington D.C.  Maybe I loved it so much because I could relate. (I won our city-wide spelling bee.  I remember by dad hollering words out of the dictionary to me while I got ready for school in the morning.  I ended up not being able to go to regionals, the runner-up had to go in my place, and she lost on "potato".  Spelled it with an 'e'.  Talk about CHOKING.) Or maybe I loved it because each person's story was so unique and quirky.  One rich girl wanted her "au pair" to come to the competition with her.  Another wanted her father, who didn't know a lick of English, to go to Washington DC for the first time in his life.  I laughed (mostly), and felt a tear here and there, but it was also exciting...yes, a  spelling competition  kept me on the edge of my seat.  You felt each kids' nervousness and pain when they lost.  You spelled along with them (ok, maybe that was just me).  It really drew you in.  I don't think  Spellbound  is playing in the Twin Cities, but keep it in mind the next time you want to rent a fantastic flic - good for the whole family!

       Does this happen to you?   In our cubicle culture, soemtimes people will come into my workstation, see that I am on the phone (I am always on the phone) and then have a seat.  I will sometimes stretch my arms out to let them know that I'm well hung...er...I mean...on a lengthy call, but there are a couple of thick customers who will just sit there anyway.  It's getting to where I think I should get some muzak and outdated magazines for my cubicle as waiting room ("Duf the hygienist will see you now, scrape, scrape - why don't you floss?" - but I digress).    So, what I do is hit my mute button, explain my sign language (universally known around the globe and the whole world over for"well hung" or "long") and ask if I can check in with them when my call is done.  Today, in a stroke of pure dullness, one of our slower colleagues replied by saying "oh, okay, it's not important, I'll check back with you later."  Which begs three questions:  if it's not important, why didn't you leave when I flashed you the "long" sign?  What the hell's the matter with you?  And, how do you navigate complex tasks like brushing your teeth or unlocking a door?

       Tell me about your first love (& loss).   Her name was Tempest.  I couldn't believe she liked me. She was gorgeous, and she had a dark reputation.  I was a squeaky clean nerd, and I kept not knowing what she saw in me.  I was awkward around her much of the time, and she did not respond well to my number one source of comedy...sarcasm (I've outgrown that sarcasm thing BTW).    We rode the same bus, and she lived not too far away.  She was older than me (a trend) and a Leo (another trend), and I was crazy about her even while I was confused (still another trend).  Tempest ushered in a new era for me.  Prior to hanging out with her, I was a model rocket (Dr. Freud white courtesy phone please...Dr. Freud white courtesy phone) fiend.  But after Tempest, it was all girls, all the time (trend).  Sometimes she would come over to go for a swim.  A couple of times, I would ride my Schwinn the two miles to her house (her mom hated me).  I got a car while we dated, and though I had a restricted license, I drove to her house once or twice too.  We hung out for a few months, and I learned a lot.  Some things shareable, some not. She eventually broke up with me to date a guy with a better body and a darker reputation (trend), and I remember being both heartbroken and pragmatic (I couldn't imagine us running away together or anything) (trend).  I still have a hair ribbon that she wore to my house one night, and I still remember that she used to wear this body spray that smelled wonderfully. Right now, I can't remember what it was called (three initials like FDS or something), but it was ATR when I was a school boy.   Sometimes, every once in awhile, I wonder where she is and what she is doing (trend).

       Open Mic Night   I finally went to watch Open Mic Night at Friar Tuck’s last night, after much prodding from a guy in my building…his name is Diesel (real name, Dror) – he’s a diamond importer from Israel who plays soccer, loves sexy women (those are his words), and goes to night clubs.  I told him the only reason I came to Friar Tuck’s was for the $2.00 bottles of Iron City.  And Tim the bartender.  He played an acoustic version of  Where the Streets Have No Name  and sang into the tinny-sounding microphone.  He may be an even bigger U2 fan than Hal.  He yelled at me because he said my friend H and I were more interested in talking to the bartender than listening to him play, and then he asked me about my weekend.  I told him I had a date on Friday.  When he asked about him, I told him we had a sort of interesting and convenient arrangement.  We never called each other during the week.  He’s way too set into his routine: works out Mondays and Wednesdays, always gets his massage on Sundays.  (What guy does  that , btw.) Works during the day on Saturday.    It’s a nice arrangement, actually.  No false pretenses, no expectations, no feelings that you’re in a job interview during the date because he needs to get married.  He e-mails me and we just do nice things together.  He wants to take me to Charlie Trotter’s and on his boat.  Diesel said all that butterfly bullshit is temporary anyway.  It fades, and you better make sure that person is your best friend in the end, because that’s all you're going to ever get or need in the long run.  He told me I was a good friend and was funny (not sure if he meant funny “ha ha” or funny “weird”) and cute and interesting.    He gave me a U2 bootleg when we got back to our building and a copy of his demo.  I’m supposed to give him my opinion on it, but am afraid to listen to it for fear of laughing.  Not because it might be bad, but because that sort of thing makes me uncomfortable; so I laugh.  Diesel didn’t understand why I laughed so much.  Maybe I need to explain that to him.

        Monday One     Tell me about your first love (& loss).   Matt was a goofy, Irish, dark curly-haired guy.  He made me laugh…that’s what I remember first drawing me to him, and that’s what makes me smile when I occasionally think about him today.  He also wrote the best love letters.  Matt gave me roots; he gave me wings.  I had no roots or anything to leap off of (or compare to) before him.  All I had was the burden of my dreams…Matt taught me how to build a bridge between my dreams and who I am.  Let me say that again: we must build a bridge between our dreams and who we are.  That’s why most people never find love, because our dreams get in the way.  Love is about acceptance.  It’s about settling.  Settling is the real triumph of love.  It’s  easy  to find a great man if you can find one and if he loves you.  But  real  love for  real  people; that means loving  despite .  After we broke up I couldn’t get out of bed.  I just kept thinking, if only I had kept a different perspective, if only I wasn’t so young…I would understand the significance of needing to have it end later.  But at the time, I just wanted to die.  But then, after recovering from mono (oh, the dreaded “kissing disease”), something happened.  I went to class.  Everyday, I continued living, going through the routine, and suddenly…a month, a summer, a year passed.  And before you knew it, I was ok.  Sure, I missed Matt.  The sadness was gone and it was ok, it made sense to me.  Not the actual break up, but the way things get left behind, the way things get out of you…like the way some things pinch your skin and cling to you forever, but others wash away, just disappear without a rinse.  People, things, places, they can just wash away.  And what is left is a sense of peacefulness.  And relief.

       1. What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.?   The water in Woodbury...not so good.  Maybe I'm just not used to it and too lazy to try, but I like me a bottle of Dasani.  Evian is for shit.  It tastes like it's been perfumed or something.   2. What are your favorite flavor of chips?   I love Delicious Chips. (c. 2002 DJS Songsmithings) Eh...I guess Nacho Cheese flavored Doritos have been my fav since I was a little DJ.  I don't like any that have onion or some foreign cheese flavored crap on it.  And all those new Dorito flavors?  They can eat a dick all the way up.   3. Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?  I make a mean box of Macaroni n' Cheese.  I'm a blue box kid all the way, yo.    4. How do you have your eggs?   Hot, not runny.  I guess I enjoy them over-easy to ensure no slime on them damn eggs.  (note: this is the most retarded Friday Five ever.)    5. Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out?   My dad made me a hamburger (or 3) a week ago.  How did it turn out?  What...are you writing a book?  Who gives a shit how it turned out?  They were delicious, okay?  The damn things were delicious and I'm not apologizing for a damn thing.  Screw you, Friday Five.  I hate you.

       1. What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.?  I’m fine with tap water, but I really enjoy the sparkling water… especially LaCroix berry flava.  If it’s flat bottled water, I love Evian… though I only enjoy it with guilt.  It makes me feel snobby, too many negative connotations.       2. What are your favorite flavor of chips?  If they are potato chips, I like salt and vinegar flavor.  Otherwise, Doritos or lime flavored Tostitos.  Yummmmmm.   3. Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?  I don’t cook many things.  But if I do, I like my chili, taco dip, or lasagna.  I can only cook very unhealthy foods.   4. How do you have your eggs?  In chocolate cake.   5. Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out?  Mom cooked dinner for us (dad, sis-in-law, myself) on Tuesday.  It was great (corn chowder and BBQ chicken sandwiches) as always.

       1. What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.?  Oh dear, this is going to expose me as a total snob.  My favorite water is San Pellegrino.  I also simply adore Perrier.  I don't get much from Evian or Volvic or Dasani or their likes.  Too flat for me.   2. What are your favorite flavor of chips?  Sun chips with the funky fresh Cheddar flava, baby!  I am, and always have been, a sucka for Pringles too.  Can't stop eating them.  Might go get some now.   3. Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?  My vegetarian chili is the reali deali.  I also like to make vegetarian lasagne and vegetarian grilled cheese sandwiches.  I am a good breakfast maker.  Panda, I would love to taste your balls sometime.  Sorry, I couldn't help myself.  I really tried to let it slide (side note to PB:  please don't take Christ out of Christmas, thanks!).   4. How do you have your eggs?  Scrambled, thanks.   5. Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out?  My mother in law.  She can flat out bring it too, yo.  Best Egg Salad sandwiches eva (and she makes a mean omelette too).

       Lazy Friday 5    1. What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.?  I prefer bottled water since it's portable.  I have a purifier at home, but it’s so high maintenance…I can barely remember where I put my keys every morning, let alone try to remember when I need to change the filter.   2. What are your favorite flavor of chips?  Sour Cream and Onion Baked Lays – especially with a meatball sub from Subway.   3. Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most?  As far as desserts go, I’d give myself rave reviews for my apple crisp and peanut butter balls (during Xmas only).  For entrees, I can cook up a mean beef stew…and my mac & cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches are both especially nice because I add lots and lots of extra cheese.  That’s the Sconie in me.   4. How do you have your eggs?  Scrambled with cheese, fried in a sandwich.   5. Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out?  My dear mother made some excellent orange chicken on Mother’s Day.  Having been a former home-ec teacher, the woman is an amazing cook …plus she was cooking for 35 people on  her  day.  She makes feats like that seem like a walk in the park.  I can barely cook for one and am afraid when I have kids, they will starve to death or get real used to take-out.

       As I admitted to Heather last night...Giving Duf' Tone!   I thought Dawson's Creek was the name of the town.  I never saw an episode.  Sucks to be me, I guess.   On another note, people keep giving me tone!  It all started on Monday when the business sponsor for my lead account returned from vacation "crabby" and gave me tone.  Then, during a conference call, I got into a squabble with our tech lead (we'll call her MJ).  MJ wanted to tell Large Institutional Client A that if we prioritized work ask they have asked us to do, then we would have to revise the timeline for Large Institutional Client B (Large Institutional Client A and Large Institutional Client B are competitors - which means that LICA could give a phlying phuck what happens to LICB's timelines and would think we were morons for even presenting it as a discussion point). When I asked her to stop, she gave me tone; then she called me after the conference call and gave me more tone!  Last night, instead of watching Dawson's Creek, I was doing testing for an implementation and one of our Project Managers gave me tone.  Then, this morning, one of our vendor managers gave me tone.  Everywhere I turn, people are giving me tone!

       Pacey Wins   I was able to catch the last hour of "Dawson's" last night, although I was a little confused how everything went down exactly, since I missed the first hour.  How did Jen get sick?  How and when did Pacey's brother and Jack get together?  What was with Dawson's hair when they showed flashbacks from the first season?    My fantasy ending of the show would have been like this: 1) Dawson would finally come out of the closet and end up with Pacey's brother.   2) Jack would realize he was only being gay to "mix it up" in Capeside, reveal his true heterosexual love to Jen, they would get married, she wouldn't die. 3) Pacey and Joey would end up together (wait, that happened). 4) Dawson's mom and Joey's sister would die. (they are so damn annoying) 5) Gran would become mayor of Capeside and live to be 113 years old (like she doesn't already  look  that old). 6) The dorky dropout guy Joey was dating in Boston would move to Capeside and work at Pacey's restaurant.  (Just so I could continue to see more of him...hot!)  And for those out there who still don't know who Katie Holmes (Joey) is,  urlLink here's a still  from one of my favorite movies that she was in: Go.  Hot or not?

       1. What is your favorite magazine?  Vanity Fair.  It takes dedication to get through it each month, but it’s so worth it.   2. What is your favorite television station?  Wow, tough question.  I have cable, so there are so many to choose from.  Non-network, I’m usually on MTV, VH1, Comedy Central, or E!, filling my head with complete nonsense.  On my “B” list, there’s Oxygen (for the “Isacc Mizrahi Show”), WE (just for the “Felicity” re-runs… God, I love that show).  For all that I enjoy cable, though, I could definitely live without it, which means that favorite channel selection leaves me with ABC, CBS, NBC, WB and Fox to choose from.  If I only have one channel with reception, I go with ABC, because I need my “Alias”.  But “Alias” aside, I go with NBC for it’s collective quality.   I used to like the WB, because of the great shows (remember when they had all the good stuff?).  But now it’s a sorry shell of it’s old self.  That said, I’m all over the last episode of “Dawson’s Creek” tonight.  Joey had better pick Pacey.  Panda, I love him too.

       Billygoat is Comin' Through Chi...God Help Us All   Just got a last minute e-mail (would you expect anything less) from BG, saying he's coming to Chicago on a red eye from Cali at 6am on Saturday morning for a Bachelor party that night.  He's wondering if he could come right to my place so we could catch breakfast and a "nice walk through the park."  I'm all up for a little breakie, but 6am...damn.  I don't even get up that early for work, let alone ex-fiances.  Let's hope on our walk through the park we don't run into any bums who need a place to stay, cuz I ain't got room at the inn...but on the upside, at least I don't have a car to steal.

       It's Tuesday on Wednesday    1. What is your favorite magazine?  I've discussed this before...my guilty pleasure mag when I fly is US.  I adore it...and I have recently stopped hiding it because I don't care who knows that I LOVE celebrity gossip.  When I have to go the brain-fulfilling route, I would say I enjoy Smithsonian (loved the Frida article a few months back), Business 2.0 (esp. nice for a young-professional techie like myself), FastCompany (progressive business-speak), and Entrepreneur (to keep my dream of someday owning my own business alive).  For music, I can't get enough of Q Magazine, although, since it's imported from the UK, the price is high and you can't get the special attached CDs cuz they get lost when shipped over.   2. What is your favorite television station?  I be like Duf...no cable in my humble home.  So I must resort to the more mundane network and local stations.  I really like Public Television (channel 11) on a Saturday afternoon, esp. when they show the entire Anne of Green Gables series.  The WB is something I'm embarrassed to say I enjoy from time to time.  I'm missing the last episode ever of Dawson's Creek tonight, and I forgot to set my VCR, so I'm really bummed (I like me some Pacey, baby.)  Right after work I turn on UPN (channel 10) and watch Blind Date (makes me feel REALLY GOOD about my dating life), and then switch to Fox at 6:30 to watch Seinfeld.  Wow, this sounds like I'm anti-network, which is probably true.  Who in the hell could watch yet  another  episode of Fear Factor or Survivor anyway?  If I had cable, my favorite station would be TLC...hands down.  And maybe Lifetime for the Golden Girls reruns.  Don't get me started again about Bea Arthur.

       The 2sday 2 Because It's 2sday Somewhere!  By Duf Fer   1.  What is your favorite magazine?  Well, for me, I have loved many magazines.  I used to subscribe to  Rolling Stone .  I have also had subscriptions to  Spin ,  Golf World ,  Harper's .  When I fly, I am likely to pick up a copy of  The Economist .  I think  Newsweek  is okay for a corporate sellout publication.  I like  EW  but could never keep up with all the issues..  My only subscription right now is to the only magazine that I think I cannot live without, the  New Yorker .  Friends got me a subscription to  Book  magazine, and I liked it for a year and had no problem letting it lapse.  Lately, i am buying a magazine called  Adbusters  a lot (very, very progressive:  they had an issue called "I want you to curb your consumption"; but not political, they have barely mentioned the war).  It comes out every other month, and I get it at Whole Foods for the phenomenal price of $6.50.  Still, without question, my favorite magazine is the  New Yorker.    What is your favorite television station?  Okay, for me, the main reason I have a television is sports.  I don't really watch much else.  I want to see  Bernie Mac , but always forget when it is on.  I like  Scrubs , but have the same problem with it - I usually look up at 8:05 on Thursday and realize I missed it.  I am absolutely nuts about  The Simpsons , but am prone to missing it.  The 'Fer family  don't got no cable and we's dishless too (I wonder what percentage of homes have neither cable nor a dish...), so my favorite channel on our TV is CBS.  They do the best job of covering sports (even on a crappy TV, high def is noticeable; their coverage of golf is sublime, friends, absolutely sublime).  When I have access to cable, pretty much all I watch is ESPN.  Therefore, my favorite channel is ESPN.

       Is it Too Late…is She Gone Forever?   A few weeks back I went to a rock show…but this was no ordinary rock show.  It included all the bands Stoner loves.  In fact, it was a  Tribute to Stoner .  She had been moshing at a Matthew Sweet concert prior to this.  Now, who on earth would  mosh  to Matthew Sweet?  Well, a true fan would…and that’s how we lost her.  A huge blow to the head was all it took.  So in attendance at her show were her other favorite artists: India Arie stood up to say a few words about her long-lost soul sistah, Justin Timberlake dedicated an entire dance number in her honor (of course, he was wearing her favorite fedora), and Dirty Vegas got everyone to chill out and remember the good times; the times when Stoner would tell all of us about her encounters with chocolate and caffeine or her latest tales with her sweetie.  Of course Mr. Sweet arrived to give his condolences and offered to sing his song “I’ve Been Waiting”, because we’ve all been waiting; waiting for something, whether it be a post from an old friend, a long overdue visit to Chicago, that burrito at Chipotle, Liz Phair’s new album, or just a nice warm day (for a change).    I don’t know about you, but I’m sick of waiting for all of it.

       The Shape of Things  turned out to be excellent.  I found myself laughing and smiling (perhaps devilishly) throughout the entire film.  The men in the audience were not doing the same, however.  Same writer and director as  urlLink In The Company of Men , another rather controversial flic, but this time around, the female gets her turn.  Evelyn takes turning a man into a "project" to a whole other level.  I don't want to reveal too much...just go and see it; if for no other reason but to crush on the adorable Paul Rudd (of  Clueless  fame).  Guys - you can stare at Rachel Weisz, but you might end up just hating her guts.  She's  my  new role model.

       We Lost A Great One Over The Weekend...This Is Stoner's Story   I know we never talked about this before, but Stoner and I are part of a squardon called Freedom Force Five.  Don't bother looking it up, it's a top secret faction of the Star Tyme Federation where we defend our planet (and neighboring planets) from hostile situations.  Remember that big asteroid the size of Texas that was heading for us a couple of months back?  Well, let's just say we handled that skirmish with tact and a firm resolve.  We've been a crack force for as long as you've spitting up all over yourself, and I was beginning to think that our squadron was indestructible.  Until last night.  I got the call and rushed to the jump station, where, true to form Stoner was already strapped into her flight suit.  She had a patch of Papa Smurf sewn onto the arm of the navy blue jumper.  Not regulation, but when you're busy saving the world from The Goztok Armada, rules don't always apply.  We high-fived and put aside our disagreement on whether Oprah is a vital member to society or a money hungry ho, and took to our starships.  No time for a long drawn out overdramatic countdown...our nimble little cruisers leapt into the stars, unnoticed by the thousands of people on the surface.  They were too busy watching American Idol, or Survivor or some other drivel.  "Stoner, DJS...good of you to join us."  I spotted the rest of the F3 Squadron and tilted the flight stick to the left, doing a barrel roll into formation.  Always looking to one-up me, Stoner launched into hyperspace, froze time and materialized her ship into the line-up.  The stunt had Turk and Whippet clapping in their flight suits.  The commander, Topside, wasn't having it.  "Save the manuevers for the fight, Stoner," he scolded.  Deep down he always thought of her as 'the special one' and let infractions like the Smurf patch go.  I tended to agree with him, though.  She was always the one you wanted on your wing in a pinch, even if she did play that damn teeny-bopper music over the headsets.  We flipped our radar scanners to 'battle' and waited.  The Omni-scan picked up something, otherwise we would be sleeping only to go to our Joe jobs in the morning.  Something was out there.  Since my suit rode a little tight in the crotch, I took the opportunity to grab the groin of my suit and give it a no-nonsense tug.  As I did, my flight stick was knocked forward, sending me into an unexpected nosedive.  "There goes, DJ," Whippet cried over the helmet-comms.  "He's been hit."  Before I could protest, and right my starship, the largest Goztok Armada ship I'd ever seen rose from behind the moon.  It made everything rumble, and knocked our targeting systems offline.  I gasped as I saw the enormous laser cannon mounted on top of the ship.  "You've got to be shitting me," I whispered, pulling back on the throttle.  I was in a tight spot and with my slip of the control, I left my squadron unprotected.  With no time to rejoin the pack, the Goztok ship unleashed hell.  Now, I know none of you have ever been in a space fight, but let me tell you.  When you're in the thick of it, you don't have much time to react.  It's not like the shows on TV or the movies where you get a couple free screw-ups, your shields hold and you can get the power up and save the day.  It's not like that at all.  "Arrghghghggh," was all I heard as the ships above me exploded into a ball of fire.  Just like that, Topside, Whippet, Turk, and yes...Stoner were all but a memory.  "Noooo," I shouted and pulled myself up into the thick of battle.  "You sons of a bitch...that was a Pandylander!"  I spun my Hot-Wing into the fight and did my trademark barrel-roll-while-I'm-shooting trick.  The twin-mounted, coolant-cooled laser cannons erupted and spit laser-ific death up on my enemies.  The giant Goztok ship just seemed to absorb the shots.  I increased the power of my front-quarter shields, and swooped beneath the monster ship.  It looked like a steel burrito, but laden with laser cannons.  On my malfunctioning Omni-scan, I picked up a reading.  If I wasn't mistaken it was...  Stoner!  I don't know if I was delirious from the tears in my eyes at seeing the crack team of star fighters reduced to nothing, or that I was happy to see Stoner still alive in her crippled ship, but it looked to me like her flaming vessel was on a collision course with the Goztok mother ship.  "For mother....earth," she gasped over the helmet-comms."  "No!  Stoner, it's not the only way."  "Only...way...I know...how..."  Before I could do another thing, Stoner's ship disappeared into one of the small cargo bays inside the Goztok ship.  A second later, there was a small explosion, followed by another, and another...and then the big one.  As I turned and manuevered back toward the Earth, the Goztok ship erupted into a ball of flame, sending chunks of metal, alien carcasses and debris all through our solar system.  As the only member left of Freedom Force Five, I wiped back the tears and collected myself.  Sure we'd only saved the world a couple hundred times together and there was always the danger of permanent retirement, but Stoner inspired me that night.  I dialed up her dance-y music and listened to her favorite little teeny-bopper sing about girls and dancing until I reentered the atmosphere.  Damn if it wasn't catchy.  And yeah...wherever she is, Stoner can be my wing woman anytime.

       Reminiscing or Rage Against the Dying of the Light or Nothing Gold Can Stay or Where the Fuck is Stoner…  By Duf Fer  One time, me and Stoner walked around Uptown (coffee at Dunn Brothers, brunch at Figlio (her the omelette with cured proscuitto and brie, Duf a Bloody Mary and two eggs scrambled with Rosemary potatoes on the side), tried to get tickets for a matinee, but it was sold out, brother – never let it be said that the Twin Cities don’t appreciate Almodovar!  Anyway…). We talked about renting a canoe, but ended up getting Rollerblades at one of the local skate shops and doing a couple of laps around Calhoun.  It was a perfect day except at one point either my feet or her feet started hurting so we stopped skating for a moment and just chilled.  The way people just chill sometimes when chillin’ is all you need. After a healing moment or two, Stoner and I sat at Calhoun’s edge and hung our toesies in her pristine tides. It was one of those nights where initially the water was cold, but then, as you adjusted to it, it seemed perfect, you couldn’t have imagined it any other way.  As the sun set, casting a perfect orange hue over the majestic lake, we commented on the restorative power of the water, downtown reflected on its stillness, the sun in harmony with its body, with us.  We skipped stones and traded stories.  I think we even talked about our dreams. We both conjured a day when we could meet on the World Wide Web as part of a larger community and expound on the mundane and trivial; we felt questions and answers should be a part of it so someone might ask:   what do you think happened to Stoner?    And the members of the community would all answer.   I confess, it was more her dream than mine, but man, what a great night.  Eventually, the absented sun left behind a sky studded with stars.  We saw one in particular – so bright it didn’t seem real.  Its presence made that night, the kind of night when friendships are cemented, even more awesome.  Anyway, looking back on it all now that Stoner has left the ‘land, I’m only thankful that I got a chance to know her…to really, really know her.  Reminiscing on that night and thinking about Stoner, I wonder if some stars just shine too brightly and then, fade too soon.  Sometimes I wonder if Stoner was that star.  Other times, I wonder if Pandyland is the star and Stoner was the sun.  Then, I wonder if Pandyland is the lake upon which all these images are reflected, and Stoner is downtown with clouds in the way so we can’t see her.  Then I realize it doesn’t figure that I’ll know everything that day meant…I just miss her, man.  I’m not going to cry or anything – I shed my last tear over it this weekend, when I logged in for the 33rd time and still there was nothing.  I just think that if she is under a rock with no knife to cut her arm off with, and it is taking her a really long time to post because of having to type with one hand and fight off pain and passing out and stuff, then, well…at least we had that one night, you know?

       Playing Hookie (kind of)   My cold became a little out of control over the weekend, and I'm sure the drinking and getting "sleepy" on Friday night around the bonfire and on the beach did not help things.  T and I had a good weekend in Sconie...other than getting hit on by some chachis on Water Street and them not understanding sarcasm.  "Don't you get it, clowns? We only talk to guys who have hot tubs."  "But my buddy here has a hot tub in Pewaukee."  My brother then chimed in: "I think she was thinking more of, you know,  urlLink Sybaris ?"  So I woke up this morning, hacking my insides out, and called in sick.  As luck would have it on a "sick day" the sun came out in all its gloriousness.  So now T (who is also taking, as she would say, a "mental health day") and I are going to the movies.  And we're going to see  urlLink this .  They just started chanting "sit down whore" on Jerry Springer.  What a great day.

       I Know You are Asking for Physical Responses, but for Me the Two are Intertwined:   1) Gwyneth Paltrow - yep, but needs to gain some weight (at least 30 pounds). 2) J Lo - not my type (icky personality, I need a woman who can keep it real, yo). 3) Kate Hudson - kinda...I mean...sure.  Mark me down for yes. 4) Nicole Kidman - yep, but needs to gain some weight (at least 30 pounds). 5) Lauryn Hill - yes, and I say unto you yes. 6) Gwen Stefani - nope, not even a little, but I can't tell you why because you'd lose respect for me (hint: not hideous clothes or association with lousy band). 7) Katie Holmes - okay, this is embarassing, but I don't know who Katie Holmes is (besides the married name of an ex-girlfriend). 8) Mariah Carey - It's kinda the J Lo thing, personality is an absolute barrier for me:  so, not hot. 9) Britney Spears - nope, not even a little, not even when I was in high school. 10) Raymond's wife in "Everybody Loves Raymond" - yes, you betcha (her are spunky).

       Having Fun is the Best Medicine for a Broken Heart   I was asked on a date last night, but given the mood I was in, I literally had to drag myself out.  And to think I actually considered wallowing in my own self-pity for the evening.  But as loyal Pandyland readers know, PB is not one to sit back and feel sorry for herself.  Especially when it comes to men. So I got back out there...and had a fabulous time.  Let me break it down for you: 1) He told me I was smart and beautiful. 2) He opened my car door for me. 3) He took my coat in the restaurant. 4) We drank 2 pitchers of sangria and a bottle of wine. 5) We shared dessert. 6) He paid. 7) He held my hand. 8) Best kisser ever.  Maybe I'll see him again.  But even if I don't, I had a hell of a good time.  Giddy-up.

       The Impossibly Difficult to Answer Five  By Duf Fer   1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.   "Jack and Diane" By John Cougar (Mellencamp).  So many memories from the summer it came out; including my first job as a dishwasher and cranking it up in the kitchen whenever it came on the radio.  I will always love it.     2. Name two songs that always make you cry.   If I were to go the silly route, I would say "Blister in the Sun" by the Violent Femmes and "Paradise by the Dashboard Lights" by Meatloaf because I HATE those songs so much.  I really, really hate them.   But, to play it straight, the songs that move me almost to tears are "I Know" by Fiona Apple "...and you can use my skin, to bury secrets in..." and "MLK" by U2.  There are many others that touch me deeply.  I can think of only one time that music made me cry.  When I was in high school, I woke up one morning looking for something on the telly.  Nothing was on, so I settled for some old guy playing piano at an ornate concert hall.  As the concert went on and I watched him more, I could tell he was sincerely moved. The audience was moved too, and the music was so perfect that when it was all over, I wept.  To me, the guy looked so old that there was no way he could play  that  fast and  that  perfectly, but he was amazing.  The depth of feeling is unmatched for me by any musical event I have ever seen.  Nothing comes close.  So, yeah, I cried, and no, I didn't let a tear go, I broke down. It was so amazing and sincere that I fell apart.  I learned that it was Vladimir Horowitz and that he was returning to Russia for a series of concerts after years of exile.  Somehow I think I knew that from the music...    3. Name three songs that turn you on.   "Music Sounds Better with You" by Stardust -preferably the club mix, but whateva' you got.  "Ecstasy" by PJ Harvey - preferably the 4 track demo, but whateva' you got. And (don't laugh): "Violet" by Hole.     4. Name four songs that always make you feel good.   "Only One I Know" The Charlatans UK, "Boys of Summer" by Don Henley, "Walt Whitman's Niece" by Billy Bragg and Wilco and "Wonce Again Long Island" by De La Soul.  I could add a zillion more, but I will just add two:  "Clap Your Hands" by the Black Eyed Peas and "Everything's Not Lost" by Coldplay.   5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without.   Like Hal, I am on a desert island with albums:  "Dry" by PJ Harvey.  "Mermaid Avenue" by Billy Bragg and Wilco.  "The Unforgettable Fire" by U2.  "Stakes is High" by De La Soul.  "Horowitz in Moscow" by Vladimir Horowitz.

       I Had the Time of my Life  just came on the radio so, as if possessed, my coworker and I broke into the dance from the last scene in Dirty Dancing.  You know, the one where they are all doing that move in the aisle up to the stage.  I didn't do the eventual swan dive, though.  Rob most certainly would have dropped me.  Nobody puts Baby in a corner.

       The Straight Dope From America's Favorite Cauc-izzy: DJS    1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.   Just about anything by DMX.  He's got this ego thing that kind of bugs me and he acts like he's such a friggin' tough guy, but at the same time his songs pretty much kick ass.  I hear his new song 'X Is Gonna Give It To Ya' and I want to seriously go out and fight people.  It's that good.  And yes...I'll probably end up buying his damn CDs now.    2. Name two songs that always make you cry.   Weird.  I don't think there are any that make me cry instantly.  One that I can think of would be 'Cats In the Cradle' (not sure who sings it).  I'm sure that when the day comes that my dad isn't around anymore, it'll make me cry like a lil' bitch.  I think there might be a couple of Johnny Cash numbers that make me sad, too.  That one that's on his new CD that Sting wrote called 'I Hang My Head.'  That's a sad one.  Yep.   3. Name three songs that turn you on.   "D'Yer Mak'er" by Led Zeppelin, but only the Sheyl Crow version.  Her voice is all scratchy and HOT, HOT, HOT.  "Please God" by Ana Voog.  Yes.  The local Minneapolis girl who has that webcam at  urlLink Ana Voog.Com  has a hidden track on her album.  It's somewhat naughty.  DJ likey.  Last but not least, I guess I'd say "The Love Boat" theme song.  Love....exciting and new...   4. Name four songs that always make you feel good.   Oh, good Christ.  "Battleflag" by the Lo Fidelity All-Stars.  "What I Got" by Sublime.  "I Left My Wallet In El Segundo" by A Tribe Called Quest.  "Rotten World Blues" by EELS.  I don't know.  This changes constantly, so check back with me next week.   5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without.    "Aurora" by Bjork.  "Untouchable" by Garbage.  "Sounds of Science" by The Beastie Boys.  "Paradise City" by Guns N' Roses.  "Sugar Free Jazz" by Soul Coughing.  Okay...admittedly, I didn't spend too much time on these questions.  I'd have to really consult my CDs because I know I'm going to constantly go back and say 'Oh shit...I forgot about that track.  Maybe I should amend my post on Pandyland.'  Can't.  Won't.

       Good Qs.    1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.  Anything by J. Lo.  Hard to get behind an "artist" that sings songs other people wrote for her about how “real” she is.  But damn, they’re catchy!   2. Name two songs that always make you cry.  “Kite” by U2 and “Ghost” by The Indigo Girls   3. Name three songs that turn you on.  “Ultraviolet (Light My Way)” by U2, “I am the Walrus” by the Beatles, “Criminal” by Fiona Apple   4. Name four songs that always make you feel good.    Too many to list!  “Brimful of Asha” by Cornershop (esp. the Norman Cook remix), “Interesting Drug” by Morrissey, “Beautiful Day” by U2, “Ordinary People” by Pulp, “A Little Respect” by Erasure, “Sabotage” by The Beastie Boys… and 2,000 other songs.    5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without.  So I’m on a deserted island… they’re not going to say “You get to bring 5 songs”, they are going to say “You get to bring 5 albums”.  In light of this, I’ll list the 5 albums that I couldn’t ever do without:  Achtung Baby , U2  A Rush of Blood to the Head , Coldplay  Louder Than Bombs , The Smiths  All That You Can’t Leave Behind , U2  1  – The Beatles, heck, anything by the Beatles!

       Maybe this will get Stoner to post SOMETHING.    1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.  That gay remake of "Big Yellow Taxi" by Joni Mitchell - sung by Counting Crows.  That band has bugged the hell out of me since "Mr. Jones", but something about this song makes me want to tap my feet.  Don't tell anyone or I'll have to kill you.   2. Name two songs that always make you cry.  "To Make You Feel My Love" by Bob Dylan "The Promise" or "Goodbye" by Tracy Chapman   3. Name three songs that turn you on.  Just take 3 songs from: Anything by U2. Anything by Radiohead.   4. Name four songs that always make you feel good.  1. "Save it For a Rainy Day" by the Jayhawks 2. "Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Part 1" by the Flaming Lips - "...those evil-natured robots, they're programmed to destroy us, she's gotta be strong to fight them, so she's taking lots of vitamins..." Classic! 3. "Carnival" by the Cardigans 4. "Galileo" by the Indigo Girls    5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without.  "In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel "With or Without You" by U2 "Blackbird" by the Beatles "Driftwood" by Travis "Taxi Ride" by Tori Amos

       I Haven't Posted In a While.  That Doesn't Mean I Don't Love You.   The Boomsticks (the softball team I'm on) has their first game tonight.  I'm predicting a Boomstick loss since our infield needs some major, major work.  We had a scrimmage in the rain on Sunday against another team associated with our company and that didn't go so well.  Not that we're not a good team, but they were short handed and we ended up giving them a few people from our squad to fill in their gaps.  Of course, they were a couple of our better players.  First of all, the team we played, call themselves Rage.  Yeah...totally gay.  They look like they're stunt doubles for the Addams Family and after a few innings I could see why they named the team Rage.  The catcher who has something totally fucked up with his eye, spent the bulk of the time yelling at the pitcher.  Why?  I don't know...maybe it's because we were hitting everything he put over the plate.  The funny part was seeing said catcher up at the plate.  When he wasn't popping up into the infield, he was swinging the bat like he was at the 'ring the bell' thingy at the carnival.  You know...swinging down and swatting the ball as opposed to swinging nice and level.  Wow...I sound like a total sports nerd.  Don't be deceived.  It rained, we played anyway and I think I yelled a little at how horrible our infield played.  People were bobbling balls, overthrowing, and missing easy outs.  I think at one point I shouted:  Looking good Boomsticks, looking real good.   I need to take it down a notch.   In other news:  the girls that sit next to my cube here at work say the word 'girl' once every 3 words.  I am not even kidding.   'Girl, his basement was all flooded and he ran downstairs to save his Sega Genesis, girl.'  'Girl?'  'Girl, it's so frustrating and girl, I told him that he needs to fix that shit, girl.'  'Oh girl.  You know they never listen, girl.'  'Girl, you feel me?'    This is the inside of my head:   girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl....

       Down by the Station Early in the Morning See the Little Puffer Bellies All in a Row   So we book ourselves at the Residence Inn in Worthington (a suburub of Columbus), Ohio.  It is a two minute drive to the office where we are working, and at a rate of $99 per night, it's a steal for business travelers.  But then maybe that's because there are train tracks about 100 yards away.  For those of you who are nostalgic for the days when trains carried freight across this great nation, may I recommend the Residence Inn of Worthington, Ohio.  Pets are welcome, and you don't have to go down the hall for ice.    Also, people here suck, and I am paid to waste my energy on them.

       Keep On Truckin': Why Not to Waste Your Energy on People Who Suck   Some people are energy vampires.  When you are with them or after you depart, you feel drained or depressed.  They are emotionally insatiable; no matter how much attention or time you give them, there is always one more thing they need.  If you try to help them feel better, they resist and argue for their problems.  They don't recognize their ability to generate joy, love, or prosperity for themselves, so they look to others to sustain them.  Watch out for anyone who says, "I have so much love to give and no one to give it to."  Immediately translate that into, "I am the emotional black hole of the universe, and I will suck every ounce of life force from you if you let me."  Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt.

       Regarding the previously mentioned U2 calendar in my cube:   At least I'm pretty sure it's been previously mentioned... anyway there is a U2 calendar in my cube, and May's picture is borderline workplace-inappropriate.  It's a concert photo, of Bono's face and a woman's outstretched arm, her fingertips on Bono's lips, barely in his mouth.  It's a beautiful shot, and one that I felt a little creepy about keeping over my computer.  So, I moved it to a corner of my cube, out of site for most people walking by.  I don't want to offend anyone.  Anyway, Duf said all that needed to be said about my fantasy life when he put the following note by the picture (aparently it's not out of his site): "This is my hand, signed Heather Lee 4.30.03"

       The Worst Manicure Ever.  Happy Cinco de Mayo.   I forgot my wallet this morning (don't ask how since I had my purse).  This would typically be irritating, but especially today since I wanted to get myself a b-day manicure.  So I went home during my lunch hour to get my wallet and stopped for a quick mani on the way back to work.  I picked my color and then sat down at my usual mani station.  My regular woman was out sick...so I got someone else.  A man.  I've never trusted men to even do my dishes, let alone paint my nails.  If he was gay I may have had more faith.  But he wasn't.  He cut the hell out of my cuticles (they were bleeding).  He painted "outside the lines".  There wasn't even a much-awaited hand massage.  He sucked and it looks like a monkey painted my nails (which actually would have been an  excellent  b-day surprise, by the way).  I suppose after a few margaritas this evening, though, I won't notice I even  have  fingernails.

       But what about the next 4 months???   You know on Thursday, when I said that the addition of “bling-bling” to the dictionary was the happiest day of my life?  Well, I was wrong.  This Sunday night is the  urlLink Alias  season finale.  It is certain to be the highlight of my young (c’mon now) life.  J.J. Abrams created the show, along with another Pandyland favorite,  urlLink Felicity .  For these achievements, I think that statues should be erected in his honor, and we should have a national holiday in his name.  Sunday's eppy is two hours long, and depending on what happens, I might not make it to work on Sunday.

       Not Enough Time for a Proper Post   I miss you.  Last night we went out drinking to 1) celebrate the dysfuntion of my team, and 2) celebrate the fact that a friend of mine graduated from the Port Authority police academy.  #2 was much more fun, but #1 was free, so I can't complain too much.  After #2, my coworker D and I went to an Italian restaurant/bar so she could buy me a b-day drink.  Here we ran into some (mostly) foreign waiters/bartenders.  They preyed on our naivete and drunkenness like flies on shit...but my favorite line was said by a pretty cute waiter from the Dominican Republic.    "Are your eyes blue?"  "Yes."  "Because I'm drowning in them and I don't know how to swim...I get off at 10:30."  "What's your name?"  *insert hot accent here - and trill the r's* "Frrrrrranco."  Sorry Franco.  Can't.  Busy.  Shortly after that I drunk-dialed my parents.  More details on that later.

       The Thursday3 Brought to you in DJX Setraphonic Siz-ound.     1. So, what's your break-up story?  My previous girlfriend was a mess.  When she wasn't 'hanging' out with her previous boyfriend, she was calling me at work threatening to cut herself if I said I'd break up with her.  Yeah...a real keeper.  Well, we were on and off and when we were back on, she decided that she wanted to go on a 'business trip' with her ex-boyfriend.  You know...just as 'friends.'  I wasn't too crazy about the idea.  When I grilled her about the accomodations, I learned that she was indeed staying in a hotel room with him with only ONE bed.  Her logic was: 'Yeah, but you've stayed with your friend in Oregon and she's a girl.'  For the record, I slept in the bottom bunk of her kid's bed.  Not even REMOTELY the same thing.  Despite my pleas for her to not go, she went.  When she came back, I promptly dumped her like a visit to the restroom after eating at Khan's Mongolian BBQ.  The following is an e-mail conversation that transpired weeks after the dump-age..    Crazy:  I'm sorry I called you so late last night. I just wanted to tell you about this dream I had that you were in....blah blah blah blah...   DJS:  What part of 'I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU EVER AGAIN' don't you understand?   2. Have you ever lied to spare feelings when breaking up with someone?   I used to.  I've got this thing in my genetic code where I don't want to let people down, including ex-girlfriends.  The previous story (and yeah, there's a lot more to it) was the exception to the rule.  I don't give two shits about that psycho now.   3. Stevie Wonder says "there is superstition." Discuss.  For someone who can't see how ridiculous his clothes are, he's got a helluva lotta insight.  This is evidenced by the number of wackos who hang around the 'Speculation' seciton at the bookstore I part-time at.  Those assholes usually pull up some floor, grab a stack of UFO, Nostradamus books and make a night of it.  So yeah, Steve.  There's a lot of superstition goin' on.  Word is bond.

       The Return of an August Tradition: Now in Stereophonic, Quadraphonic Technicolor! The Thursday3 By Duf "Bling Bling" Fer    1.  So, what's your break-up story?  In college, I had a girlfriend (well, more than one, but I digress), we'll call her BP.  One night, drunk at a party, BP got mad at me and threw a bottle of Heineken at me (Duf ducked, bottle breezed by).  I ended it because she clearly had an anger management problem.  She called me a lot and even waited for me in my bed one night (scary).  Eventually, we reached an understanding (or so I thought).  One afternoon, I was at home watching Jeopardy (With Alex Trebek - a Canadian) after a vigorous academic schedule.  BP comes down the hall walking out of my roommate's room.    BP:   I just *&^%$# your roommate. Duf:   Who was better? BP:   He was by far. Duf:  That's funny, your mama said I was.  BP remains silent then throws herself at Duf and beats him about the head and neck.  Offending roomate removes BP from the person of Duf.  Eventually, Duf, roommate and BP reach an understanding.   2.  Have you ever lied to spare feelings when breaking up with someone?  No, I pretty much tell the truth.  However, I have broken up with someone from the (edge of the) bed of someone else so that I would not "cheat."     3.  Stevie Wonder says "there is supersitition."  Discuss.  Stevie hasn't been so right since "Master Blaster."  I try to get the same hotel room if I was in it during a good business trip (or if it has a great shower) (Hal calls me princess for this).  When my team is in the NCAA tournament, I try to watch all the games in the same place and wearing the same things I wore during a (usual) first round win.  I lift my leg at all railroad crossings, and if I am going late through a yellow, I swipe the ceiling of my car to keep johnny law/50 down - ya heard me?

       It is True   Yes, Lee Jeans is coming out here to get corrupted by yours truly.  He's a very naive boy and has no idea what he's gotten himself into.  Poor thing.  As far as his tendency to wear Lee Jeans...that would be negative.  I think I mentioned in an earlier post that he doesn't wear any pants at all.  Why do you think I would invite him here for an entire weekend otherwise?  To drink pop and talk?  I don't think so.  I think I've said enough.  Cheers.

(Yep, I'm a snob-and-a-half.)  My parents called in a panic on Sunday morning (while I was at the Gay Pride Parade) just to see if I was OK.  Mom and Dad, I like to go out, but I can't attend EVERY PARTY In Chicago.  They're funny.  11 days until Lee Jean's arrival, but who's counting?

       How to Make an Ass of Yourself  by Panda Bear  Last night I attended an event with my grad school alumni association.  Not only was this going to be an important networking experience, but I was also going to be inducted onto the board of directors…so I had to be on my best behavior.  However, there’s one detail I’m leaving out here – the event involved  wine tasting .  I was doomed.  I started drinking a nice white wine…and it was going down way too easy.  I was greeting people as they came in…Don’t worry though – I wasn’t using my “Country Bar technique.”  No one was getting his/her chest stroked…but I was getting pretty chatty, especially when I met some people who could potentially get me a job.  I met a guy who worked in Orbitz’s marketing department and talked to him for a while.  More wine was tasted.  I then talked to the Dean for a while, but at that point I remember telling myself “Panda, keep your shit together.  Just smile and nod.  Don’t say anything stupid.”  By the time the wine class was supposed to start, everyone was lit.  The poor lady who was supposed to teach us about all the wines hated us.  We were all talking (very loudly) during her entire presentation.  (Mental note: at the next event don’t let the attendees DRINK before the presentation.)  We had more wine, and more wine, and …well, you get the idea.  The event ended at 8pm, but of course that was  way too early  for me to go home…so I suggested to my friends (at that point, EVERYONE was my friend) that we stay and buy some more drinks.  The Orbitz guy and I were pretty tight by then.  I thought I was definitely going to get a job offer from this…until I realized he just wanted to get into my pants.  “Do you want to go out sometime?  I think you’re really cute.”  Wait, I thought I was networking.  Instead, me talking to him was mistaken for flirting.  The good news is that within only a few days I’ve found potential job prospects (at Target and Orbitz), but the bad news is I have to date these guys first.  Fuck me.  I shared a cab with the Orbitz guy (would you believe he lives down the street from me – in IAN’s building…Jesus) and right when I got into my place he called.  “I could tell you were ‘into me’ at the event…blah, blah, blah.”  Sorry, friend.  All I wanted was your business card.

       The PBJ3 (Sans Burritos, BB, & Duf) and Those Crazy Dancing Fools   PBJ3 started out innocently enough.  HAL and I showed up after DJS and Bob (not his real name) had already ordered some delicious, but unhygienic, burgers and fries at the  Country Bar .  HAL and I waited for what seemed like an hour for our first drink(s): a bottle of ML and a well drink happy-hour special – rum and coke (definitely the clearest rum and coke I’ve ever consumed).  First, the  singing .  We initially got the book of  b-side karaoke hits .  We chose a few numbers and since the place wasn’t being run by the  karaoke Gestapo  (please refer to PBJ1 October archives), Mark and DJS got called up to sing a rousing rendition of  Brass Monkey  by the Beastie Boys.  The crowd fell in love, and couldn’t wait for more.  Yours truly got up to dedicate a number to the Country Bar – “Country Bar, this one is for you…’Thank You’ for everything.”  Yep, I brought things down a notch with  a Dido tune . We soon found the  Karaoke Bible , and thank God we had time for a few more cocktails before DJS and I were called up to sing a duet of  Total Eclipse of the Heart .  This brought tears to the eyes of most of the patrons.  Mark then made the crowd holla with the classic sensation,  Runaround Sue .  Second, this summary could not be complete without discussing the  bar full of boozehounds . (Ourselves included.)  I felt it necessary  to greet everyone who came into the bar .  They either got a good  chest stroking  (guys only), or a very enthusiastic  “Welcome to the Country Bar!” greeting .  I wanted people to feel comfortable while smoking, drinking, and singing various ditties like  “Gin n’ Juice”  (sung only ONCE all night, btw.)  In the case of Kool Kirby, however, he got a nice  leg hump  to remember the evening by.  I’m not quite sure if those coming in were terrified by this display, or if they stayed just because of it.  “Baby Got Back” brought out the worst in everyone, especially  a guy with gold teeth  who told me I had a “little back.”  One fella came right from work at Outback Steakhouse,  wearing his bling  (or as HAL pointed out, more appropriately,  his pieces of flair ).  I also witnessed a terrible crime –  a classless slut’s thong  was sticking out and was just begging to be snapped.  This lead me to meet a guy named Lee.  For those who are wondering, DJS made sure to ask whether or not he wore  Lee Jeans .  For the record, I don’t even think he was wearing pants (probably prompted by DJS’ plea for everyone to  take off their pants ).  Finally, the evening was concluded by  eating pizza at Dulono’s .  More American Flag glasses could have been stolen, but that seemed inappropriate to DJS who couldn’t complain enough about  our salad pizza .    We missed Duf and BB, but photos are in the process of being developed as I type.  2 roles, in fact.  But the summary above should not overshadow  Saturday Night Fever .  Mell’s Beauty Bar ended up being a complete bust – only one manicurist for the entire establishment?  Forget about it.  This got us in the mood to  get our groove on  at  Drink , not a place we would normally frequent, but it seemed just right for that night…especially when everyone heard  their favorite songs  and we got a choice spot to dance,  right in front of the window .  After Marc danced for 2 bachelorette parties, we annoyed the cops, we got elbowed by falling-down-drunk couples, we broke the glass, and smacked each others’ asses,  we left on a high note .   In other news…   It’s a good sign when:   he calls (when he says he’s going to call) and we end up talking for almost 2 hours.  It’s a bad sign when:  you find out his friends have given him the nickname of “Chachi”.

       Will You Take a Visa with My Mother's Name on It? The Friday Five on a Rainy Monday By Duf Fer    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?   I have the original natural hair:  the afro, and I keeps it low, yo.   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?   When I was eight, I had an afro (power to the people with no delay), that I would corn row on weekends (corn rows hurts BTW).  I had a Philly fade in college (a.k.a. the high top fade, a.k.a. the kid-n-play lite), but other than that, I have had the same style pretty much my whole life just at varying lengths depending on how lazy I am about my barber visits.     3. How do your normally wear your hair?   Low like a marine (Semper Fi, yo).   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?   I would wear a long ass beard and dreadlocks (seriously), but the corporate world is not ready for a Rasta Manager.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  Two:  when I was in high school, the clipper fell off and I was bald, baby, bald.  But I got the next cut free.  What is up with the next cut free deal anyway?  I want the current cut an the next three cuts free.  The other hair disaster was when I lived in D.C. (Marion Barry - best mayor ever - if you like crack and prostitution and late buses).  I went to a salon to get my hair cut.  I got a serviceable cut and some pretty rude treatment.  I was a poor as hell college kid, and when they told me the fee (BB, PB and H will yawn, but you have to understand that at that point I had never paid more than $10 for a haircut) was $50, I almost wept.  I think I ended up charging that to Mother Duf.

       If There Was Ever A Night That I Needed To Drink 5-8 Beers...It's Tonight.   I'm a corporate trainer/communications expert by day.  When the IT guy is gone for say, vacation, I've somehow become the back-up.  Nerdy, right?  Not really.  I know somewhere betwixt jack and shit about all this network, internet, router stuff that computer nerds eat for breakfast.  I've spent the bulk of my day on the phones with clowns in California who have been trying to replicate a problem we're having here at work.  It's cut into my 'normal' work time and I don't get a penny more for doing any of this shit.  To quote Dirty:  Happy Friday friends...and fuck me.   And now...The Friday Five brought to you in part by DJS Industries, a subsidiary of the Soft Drink corporation.    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?   It's short, but kind of long on top right now.  I don't know that it's necessarily wavy or curly, but it's thick.  It's like a goddamn brillo pad.    2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  The biggest thing I notice is that I've gotten a lot more gray hair over the last 5 years or so.  I'm only 30 years old, but I fear that by the time I reach 40, I'll look like Phil Donohue.  I guess I can be grateful that I won't ever, ever, ever be bald.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?   As low-maintenance as possible.  I'm a guy for Christ's sake.  I don't need to mess with that kind of shit.  I do hate it when it gets too long.  You see, I'm cursed with a large head (physically, you twits) and when my hair (thick hair) gets long, my head size grows exponentially.  That's when I need to cut 'er down, yo.    4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?   The gray would be gone.  Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.  Well...maybe a cowlick or two would get outta my sight.  Sometimes I get the Alfalfa thing going on in the back.    5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?   I had some broad in high school cut my hair for me.  She had a shaver but no guards.  I told her 'who cares, cut it anyway.'  She applied the shaver to my head and slipped.  Bzzzzzzzzzzzt!  There was a three inch bald spot in front of my ear.  I shrugged and said 'well, you might as well make it even.'  This was back in the mullet days, so she proceded to shave the side of my hair, leaving it long in front and long in back.  I looked like some kind of crazed Indian brave with a thick mohawk.  Two days later, I had my picture taken for my health club membership.  I could never get away with it now, but it looked kind of rockstar.

       You still know nothin' 'bout me.   The other night I saw  urlLink this movie .  In a theater.  Full price.  My choice.  Awe yeah.  I might even get past my  urlLink Vin Diesel  aversion and see the original.  Maybe.  For those not in-the-know, Mr. D was not in the sequel.  On a side note, when I googled the words "I hate Vin Diesel",  urlLink KMC Forums came up .  I can't make this stuff up.

       The FF in full effect.    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?  Naturally wavy.  Medium length.   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  It’s gotten darker (from light blonde to dishwater brown, but I color it enough to deny my brunette-ness).  It’s also gotten curlier.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?  I get lazy… often.  I like wearing it up so as not to deal with it.   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  I would love a good haircolor.  Really, I would.  I spend a fortune on getting it done, and it kills me because each time I leave the salon with okay results.  For the money and time that goes into it, I should want to marry my hair.  Or at least sleep with it.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  I’m not risky enough to have all-out disasters, though like any girl, I’ve had my perm regrets.  However, last time I got my hair cut, Danielle (her real name) decided to give me bangs.  This despite the fact that I have a cowlick that denies all bangs.  So I had to bobby pin the bangs away for the longest time (I still have to, almost 3 months later!).  I’m afraid to go back.

       eBay Scare   I like to mix it up, especially when I'm bored at work.  So I was talking with my coworker and we thought it would be a great idea to have a ping-pong table here at work in our corner office.  I said "That's easy - we'll check 'em out on eBay!"  That was a mistake.  We went on eBay and looked up ping-pong tables.  A slightly used one popped up on the screen for less than $100.  For shits and giggles, I bid.  I was immediately overbid, which made it obvious that someone was Proxy Bidding - I assumed they put a maximum bid in for $100, so the site automatically puts in another bid for them when someone else bids.  So I put in another bid.  And won - I was now the top bidder.  Which immediately made me panic.  Two seconds later, though, someone put in a higher bid.  Relief!  But wait....5 minutes later?  They retracted their bid.   I was on top again.   Our first reaction: "Fuck."  Initial concern: how in the hell would we ship it here (the seller required the buyer to pay for shipping).  More important concern: if our NY office would find out we had a ping-pong table, we'd be fired for sure (but I suppose I can think of worse ways to get let go...).  So I performed an eBay no-no.  I retracted my bid, with the consequence of now having a negative record on eBay for the next 6 months.  Oh well.  It would have been pretty cool to have "Ping-Pong Tournament Fridays" though.  That would mix well with our Friday Beer Run.  Who woulda thunk eBay could almost give you a heart attack?

       A Friday Five Close to my Heart    1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?  Now it is naturally wavy and I straighten it everyday.  And it is short...but I'm growing it out which is taking forever.  I am very impatient.   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  When I was little, my hair was stick straight and my mom insisted on the "Dorothy Hamill" haircut = a.k.a. the "Bowl Cut".  I was already a tomboy growing up, but that hair cut made me look even more masculine.  When my little bro and I would be out together, we would be referred to as "those cute little boys."  I think this gave me a huge complex.  Then one day in grade school my mom agreed to take me to the salon and get me a perm. (Remember when this was actually cool??)  This started me down the road of  hair hell .  The perm never went away and I had naturally curly hair (Felicity-type curls) all the way through high school.  I also grew my hair out in high school giving me a horrific "poodle look."  In college I really started experimenting with my haircuts and color.  I was a hair model for a while which means that I would get my hair done for free or at a discount if I let them do WHATEVER THEY WANTED.  Please refer to question #5.  2 summers ago, my hair was the shortest it's ever been...even shorter than all y'alls' (with the exception of Duf's...his is pretty short).  But now it's finally to where I want it to be.  Yep, it took me 28 years to finally get it right.   3. How do your normally wear your hair?  Like I said above - straight and sometimes behind my ears.  I like to keep the cut very "wash-n-go."   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  I always wanted really, really straight hair like those Vidal Sassoon girls.  I love those angular type haircuts.  Remember that band from the Eighties -  urlLink Swing Out Sister ?  I love her hair.  I guess you always want what you don't have because you don't know how many times (when I still kept my hair curly) people came up to me saying "What I'd give for your hair."  Hell, you can have it.   5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  I have had way too many disasters, but I have only cried once.  I always remember to keep in mind that it  will  grow out.  I think Bassy can remember my experiments with out-of-the-box hair color during college.  She was my roommate at the time - my hair had a nice purple hue for a few weeks, and then it turned a weird red-orange color.  My biggest consistent mistake has been getting it cut too short.  One time, when I was still going to a transsexual hair stylist here in Chicago (another story for another day), I was shaved up the back and had spit curls cut on the side.  That was wacky.  In the past few years, though, I've been much more conservative.  If I was working in a record store and not for a software company who knows what I would look like right now.

       Which Song, DJS? and If It Weren't for Search Engines and Porn...   You need to tell us which song you're lip-syncing.  Captain & Tenille?  The Carpenters?  50 Cent?  Whatever you guys picked, I'm sure it will be great.  Believe it or not, we've had record numbers coming to our crappy little site this month.  Before you start the parade, I have to be honest.  It's because of people who use search engines to scour the internet for porn.  "Sexy Animal Sluts" is the big one.  I'm not kidding.  It's sad how many sickos are out there, but it makes me laugh because I'm sure they click on the link and think "Oh, yeah baby...I'm about to see some chicks having sex with animals..." when all they get is a picture of Butch Bassy in her fishin' gear.  Now that's funny.

       Hi.   We're doing a 'Puttin' On The Hitz' type of event here at work.  Remember that show?  The one where people make total asses of themselves by lip-syncing songs in front of God and everyone?  Yeah...that's what we're doing.  I know this sounds tre gay, but I'm on the Entertainment Committee and since we've done Bagel Bowling 3 times already and we've cooked breakfast for people more often than we care to remember, I thought it would be kind of fun (and stupid) to have people get into it and rock the mic on the rooftop of our parking garage here at work.  And they bought it.  There are going to be around 9 performances today starting at 1pm.  We'll be eating mouthwatering hotdogs, delicious chips, and savory soft drinks.  I'm performing with a friend here at work and it's going to be abso-fucking-lutely crazy.  There will be pictures and I will post them here on Pandyland, since I know our ratings have been slipping.  Oh...I forgot to mention: HAL is a judge.

       There is Something in the Water in this Town   People have been incredibly rude to me lately.  But  urlLink this  has helped me cope.  I'll tell you more about it some other time.  And BTW, there will be no cat fights this weekend.  Only drinking and harmony amongst all members of Pandyland.

       Counter-Counter Point  By Duf Fer  Two weeks ago I bought a skirt (mini no less) at Anthropolgie, and I have been tickled pink.  It frames my ass beautifully, hangs at the same level in front and back, and is really easy to hike up at the urinal.  It is well worth the $125 I paid for it.  Now I can just find a matching bag (Kate Spade, please) and shoes (Jimmy Choo, please), I'll be all set.    If there is a cat fight between Hal and PB at PBJ3, I'll cry and cry and cry that I missed it.

       Counterpoint:  Do Buy a Skirt on Sale   With all due respect, Panda, your first mistake was shopping for clothing at Anthropologie.  Sure, they are a great place to find a $50 knick-knack, but let's be realistic about their clothes.  I think you said it all with your reference to a $90 piece of cotton with straps.  Do I really need to point out that this item was probably made in a Taiwanese sweatshop from scraps that the Urban Outfitters people didn't want, at a cost of $0.13?  Give me the right sales price to justify this - 50% off?  75?  Sorry.  While I feel for you and your frustration, I think you're a smarter shopper than that.  You can do better.  I think you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater, as it were.  One cannot stop purchasing skirts on sale simply because her friend bought a piece-of-crap burlap sack at Anthropologie.  Sorry, friend.

       Don't Buy a Skirt on Sale   So I go to  urlLink Anthropologie , a store known for it's over-priced merchandise.  I skip looking at the full-priced clothes (a tank for $90? yeah right.) and make a bee-line to the sales rack.  I found a choice long, brown, linen skirt with these weird rips on the bottom...it had a sort of edgy look that I liked, plus, it was half off.  Sweet no?  This skirt sucks.  I wore it for the first time today to work.  The skirt fits strangely - it clings to my ass, but has a loose waist, so when I walk it slowly creeps down.  My ass was pretty much hanging out of it in the bus today.  Lord help me if I've turned into Thong.  When I walked the 2 blocks from where the bus drops me off to where my office is, I was pulling it up the entire time.  I'm sure everyone who passed me thought I had major problems.  Moral of the story: most of the time you get what you pay for.  But I still wouldn't buy a tank for $90.

       3concerts8days  By Duf Fer  In the past 8 days, I have seen 3 concerts.  Not bad for a married man (props to my lady).  Last Monday, I saw Coldplay at the University of Illinois - Chicago Civic Center.  On Friday night, I saw Wilco at the Walker Art Center Sculpture Garden.  Last night, I saw Pearl Jam at the Xcel Energy Center.    If I ranked the bands among my favorites, I would rank them thusly:  Wilco Coldplay Pearl Jam  [Coldplay and Pearl Jam are almost indistinguishable in my ranking; I like Wilco quit a bit more than the other two, and I love the other two.]  But I would rank the concerts:  Pearl Jam (best show I've seen in quite awhile) Coldplay Wilco  The show last night was phenomenal.  The band was tight.  The crown was hyped.  They did covers (including "Driven to Tears" by the Police and "Rockin' in a Free World" by Neil Young).  The energy was electrifying. The Xcel Energy Center turned the house lights on (meaning "you don't have to go home, but you got to get the hell outta here"), and the band played on.  It was political.  Humorous (a fan joined the band for a rousing number).  As the years have gone on, the band has only gotten better.  They even waxed nostalgic about not having been to MN for five years (I saw the last show as well - I saw both with my friend Renee - a faithful Pandyland reader - we waxed nostalgic about all that has changed (and not changed) since the last show).  So, I found myself, a couple of times, remiscing about my turbulent 20s.  Thinking about love and loss and those crazy times.  I thought about grundge and the whole Seattle scene and Kurt Cobain and there was emotional force to it all for me.  I didn't cry or nothing, but it added layers to a show that, even without them, would have slain me.    I mean, even  urlLink the opening act  rocked.  The cherry on top of a great night:  we kinda sorta partied with Ozzy Osbourne's guitarist "Jack" after the show.    All in all, a magical evening.

       The I-Don't-Feel-So-Well Monday 5 by DJS      1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?  Visit Egypt.  Ever since I was a young-in (and I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark) I wanted to head out to Egypt and check out some pyraminds, tse tse flies, and some delicious artifacts.  I used to actually read up on all of the ancient lore and I was convinced that I could find the lost ark of the covenenant.  Now that I'm older and a bit more agnostic, I'm not sure it ever exists.  But...it was fun while it lasted.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   I'm a guy, so this doesn't happen too often.  Sometimes DJ Laura Z will ask my opinion (and yes, I get the 'is my butt too big in these?' question) but I'm usually pretty straightforward.  I guess I don't remember a time when anyone, Duf included, asked me what I thought of his pants or his haircut.  So, I guess my answer is: when applicable, yes.    3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   No, not really.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   I know I sound like a total nerd, but I think it would be cool to be Neo from the Matrix and just kick all kinds of ass all the time, fly whenever you wanted to, love Carrie Anne Moss down, and hang out with Lawrence Fishburne.  Jesus...who wouldn't want that?     5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   There's two.  I always wanted to learn how to play an instrument.  I've got an acoustic guitar in my closet just dying for me to learn how to play it.  I also wish I had the ability to go without sleep for as long as I wanted.  As a busy 30 year old, I find I don't have enough time in each day to get my shit done, so I'd like to chip into my sleep-time hours, with no negative drawbacks and regain that 1/3 of my life that's just being wasted.  Did I mention I don't feel good?  F this...I'm going home.

       Don’t Hate – I Was Out of Town   Everyday is Like Sunday 5  by Panda   1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?  Climb Mt. Kilimanjaro.  I was supposed to do it on my honeymoon, but we all know how that turned out.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?  I have been accused of being brutally honest…but with hair, outfits, etc, I can be like a guy in that I don’t notice subtle differences.  Especially with hair color…when Thong was still in the office she was getting her hair highlighted at least every 3 weeks (it was gross) and she  always  asked me if I liked it.  Instead of saying yes or no, I usually told her I couldn’t tell.  This was true and not too hurtful (?).  I have had some interesting hairdo’s over the years, and I usually appreciated people’s comments…unless it was some asshole guy telling me they like girls better with long hair.  Those guys can go to hell.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   A “friend” once told me how a guy  really  felt about me when we were going out.  This I did  not  need to know.  Does this even answer this question?    Actually, I guess I found out 2 things from this: 1) the person who told me this bit of info is not that great of a friend, and 2) that guy was a total shite.    4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   Dylan (Drew Barrymore’s character) in Charlie’s Angels.  She kicks ass and looks good doing it.    5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?  To be a psychic would be fantastic, but I wouldn’t want to know when people were supposed to die.  Too creepy.

       1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?   Skydive.  That’s one.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   Nope.  But I don’t feel that I’m all-out lying.  If someone gets a perm, I might not like it because I feel that it’s not my style, but I can appreciate that someone else might like it.  Therefore when I say “it looks nice”, I’m really saying that someone must like it.  But maybe it’s just not my thing.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   Yes – many times.  There are many categories for this.  First off, there are the times that someone tells you something private or secret about another person, and you know that they shouldn’t be telling you.  An example would be “Jane told me her deepest secret – want to hear what it is??” – and it kills you that this person actually tells you.  There are also the times that friends make decisions that you wouldn’t make, and all you can do is support them and shut up.  Something like, “I’m going to invest in Worldcom” - I would rather just not know about it.  Yet a third type is when you are told something that puts you in a dilemma – to tell or not tell.  I really don’t like those.  “Don’t tell Jane, but her car is getting towed” or “Don’t tell Jane, but I’m about to sleep with her dad”.  Alright, so car towing doesn’t usually create a morality crisis, but you get the idea.  In case you can’t tell, I’m not a fan of secrets.  Ignorance is bliss.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   I wouldn’t mind being Buttercup in the Princess Bride.  Some pretty cool stuff happened in that book.     5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   I would love any kind of musical talent (take note, Bassy), be it singing, playing an instrument, conducting, or anything of the like.  Instead, I make mix tapes.

       The FF by BB, yo yo.    1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?   Play with a killer band in a sold-out, big huge arena outdoors, like Soldier Field in Chicago. On a more realistic note closer to home, I'd like to play the main room at First Ave.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   No. I try to minimize hurting people's feelings so I try to find something positive and confusing to say. Them: "Hey do you like my haircut?" Me: "Haircuts are indicative of change and I find that change in this life is good. Sometimes change can ruin your life for awhile, but most of the time it turns out ok. People can learn a lot about themselves in times of change. You're learning a lot about yourself now." Hopefully I will have lost their attention by using big words and long sentences, all the while conveying my true feelings about their haircut.    3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   Ok, I've been stuck on this question for like 20 mins now and I've got nothing. If something comes to mind, I'll post it latah.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   Since I don't play video games, I'll go for a board game. I would like to live in Candyland. Why? Because everything is sweet and edible and the name rhymes with PANDYLAND! reason enough right there.   5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   3 Way tie: (1) Be a bad-ass volleyball player. (2) I would like to sing so lovely that it brings tears to people's eyes and goose-bumps to their skin. (3) I would like to sweet-talk my way in and out of any sticky situation.

Nope, I'm in that world too.  Alright, I would like live in Scooby Doo, being a meddling kid and gettin' my sn-iz-ack all the way iz-on.  Care to join me in the vizzy, friezzys?

Four way tie:  (1) I would like to be able to charm buxom twins into the sack.  (2) I would like to be the greatest chess player of all time.  (3) I would like to be able to dunk a basketball.  (4) I would like to be able to clover my tongue.

       Once I was out with DJS  By Duf Fer  Lost my login info, but just found it.  What's new?  Here's a blog for my peeps.  Once I was out with DJS and he said that someday, when he has a little critter [or little critters] of his own, he would not mind waking up in the middle of the night for feedings and gentle rockings to sleep.  This is my prayer for  DJS:  that he never actually has to test that statement.  My prayer is that he will have a child [or childrens] that sleeps [be sleepin'] through the night because friends, I am so tired today, my whole body hurts.  Here's how it happened:  TinyE (the pride and joy of Duf and Mrs. Duf), who can now crawl out of her crib,  went to bed around 8:30 .  Duf and Mrs. Duf went to  bed at 11:00 .    Mrs. Duf was reading a thriller by a Scandanavian author who puts the "er" in thriller.  Duf was working one a poem about elevation from disgrace and despair through the enjoyment of a near perfect plum.    Anyway,  at 1:30 , TinyE woke up and came walking into the marital bedroom where nothing much was going on but a bit of the old in out, in out (known Chez Duf Fer (pronounced "doo fair") as inhaling and exhaling, also know as catching flies, also known as snoring (for those of you who misunderstood me to reference that wonderful 70s icon  A Clockwork Orange )).  Anyhow, TinyE woke us up, and Mrs. Duf, who does most of the heavy lifting on the graveyard shift (and otherwise) coaxed her back to sleep.    PumpkinCountryBumpkin (also known as TinyE)  woke again at 3:00  and DadDuf did  not get her back to sleep until 3:30 .     At 5:00 , she woke up, and she was done for the night.  I needed her to go  at least until 8:00 .  I  would have taken 7:00 .  I'll admit that  6:00  would not have lead to a blog, but would have allowed for some gripin'.   But 5:00 ?  Ouch friends, ouch.

      Glad to hear y'all had a good time with ColdPlay. So I'm curious about the all-girl 14 yr. old band....were they one of the openers for Coldplay? Why were they horrible? Could they not play their instruments? I'm hoping you will say "yeah they could play but their songs just weren't for me." otherwise, I will be disappointed to learn that yet another crappy band is getting good gigs and continuing the perception/belief that female musicians aren't so good on instruments. (It's hard to escape that belief when it's presented to people many times over.) Maybe I need to stop the negativity here and remember what's important....she looks good in a tube top.

       Cold (n' Hot) Play   HAL, I am sorry to break it to you, but that show was all for  me .  I know I told you I had to "catch a flight" at 4am, but it really was to meet Chris without hurting your feelings.  It's unfortunate you had to find out this way.  Yes, the show was great, but the time we waited before Coldplay came on was clear proof of who were the biggest fans.  We started about 10 layers of people back from the stage when we first arrived at 6:15.  There were 2 (yes, TWO) opening bands before Coldplay finally made its appearance.  What we survived: feeling really, really old; standing for over 3 hours with no water (or BOOZE - it was a "dry arena"...Duf and I would have downed at least 2 more cosmos otherwise); a weirdo who kept staring (without blinking) at HAL's chest and then asked me about my monkey shirt ("So, what's up with the monkey?"  "Who are you tryin' to get crazy with, ese? Don't you know I'm loco?"); some pot smokers from Sandwich, IL ("I like Jewish ass."  "Wait, you know  I'm  Jewish."); a horrible, all-14-year-old girl band called Eisley ("Please visit our website.  Please!"); and lots and lots of sweatiness.  We ended up only 4 people back from the stage once Coldplay started.  It was awesome.  To whoever's foot I totally stomped on while jumping up and down and screaming like a lunatic: I'm  very  sorry, but this ain't Madonna, bitch.

      Hi kids,  I've had a nice collection of days off - over the weekend I was in my friend "Kat's" adorable wedding.  Though the event was great, being in the small town freaked me out.  I actually saw a bumper sticker that said "First Iraq, Now France".  And that's not the only nutso political expression I saw.  Ewwww.  Then on Monday, Duf and I drove to Chi, met up with Panda and spent a couple of beautiful, intimate hours with Chris Martin and his band.  You might know his band as "Coldplay".  I know them as "HAL's Collection of Future Husbands".  Thanks to Panda's efforts, we were on the floor just a few feet from the stage.  I thought Chris did a great job of playing the show just for me, while not making the rest of the crowd feel completely ignored.  I thought that I did a great job of expressing my enthusiasm, while not earning a restraining order.  Chris is a good guy, and a great dancer.  He wasn't as goofy as he was in Phoenix (no boy-band falsetto impressions this time), but all was forgiven when he got on his guitar and did his "back and forth" move.  For me.  After the show, we caught a few zzz's before heading back to Minneapolis yesterday.  Panda was again the true trooper - she went to bed at 2, and got up at 4 to catch her plane to NYC.  She's my hero.  I love rock and roll.

       Some Real Characters   T, Nish, and I ran into some total cuckoos over the weekend.  As a quick preface, we went to Capturing the Friedman's on Friday before we hit the bars.  A fascinating documentary, with some twists and turns: at the end you didn't know who to believe.  As an added treat, the director attended our showing for Q&A after the movie.  He originally started filming the documentary with the theme of "NYC Party Entertainers."  This turned into something  urlLink he never imagined .  It won the Sundance documentary prize.  See it if you can.  On to the retard recap: 2 fellas came up to T and I in an Irish pub, one of them we called "Hans without Franz" because he was pumped up, wore a white muscle shirt, and was covered in bling - gold chains, bracelets, and earrings.  Total chach if we ever saw one. His friend who we coined "St. Matthew", approached us with the line "I used to be an altar boy at the Catholic school down the street from here."  How does one respond to this?  We told them both we were lesbian yoga instructors.  This fascinated them to no end.  "So, are you 2 lesbians with  each other ?"  The next place we went to, we were first confronted by a guy who was with a bachelor party; and then dissed by 2 of his friends from the East Coast who attended Yale med school. "Hey, friends, I want to introduce you to these 3 stunning ladies..."  Yale Asshole: "Um, don't you see we're having a  conversation ??"  Needless to say, we found out these guys were on a bank role from their rich parents - when you can go to Yale med school w/o student loans, the assumption is you're loaded.  They were assclowns anyway.  At the next bar (yep, we were crawlin'), T ended up talking to a guy I nicknamed "Sporto Spice."  He looked like he just got off the soccer field...he had a blue and white jersey and looked like the type who would wear a visor indoors.  He was nice enough to take her drunk ass home.  The next night, after the Yo La Tengo show (killer, btw), we were innocently eating a nice meal at Clarke's diner, when our waitress came over with 2 glasses of milk.  "Those 2 guys over there ordered these for you - they insisted on one chocolate and one plain.  Enjoy."  When we glanced over at their table, they gave us the ol' "wink and point."  Hilarious.  Then a few minutes later they sent over an orange and on their way out of the joint, they stopped by our table to tell us that it was important we consume it. "The vitamin C in that orange really helps with your stomach enzymes."  Whatever, dude.  Always a story, friends.  Always a story.  Sometimes I feel like I'm on some fucked up episode of Seinfeld.

       Nigel Update   Nigel is alive and well in Appleton, WI with my 'rents.  He's been staying with them in their guest bedroom since my studio is too small.  I think my mom is getting annoyed with him because he doesn't like her home cooking...either that or the fact that he has a sock in his speedos (mom thinks that's inappropriate).  Since I am moving into my new (bigger) place soon, he will make his return to the big city soon enough.    I will most likely welcome him to Chicago with a doo-rag.  It's an appropriate head covering for summer.

       MIA  Sorry to be outta da loop lately, just busy is all. I must say that I'm lookin good (maybe a little butch?) as a bass fisher-woman. Excellent work, DJS. Weekend was non-eventful. lots of church gigs and I actually rented some movies. Saw "Catch Me if You Can" and "Good Girl" Liked them both very much. Catch Me was a fun movie but what I liked most about it is that it's based on true events. Some teenager in the 60s actually posed as an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer & teacher. talk about cahones. It shows what the power of donning a uniform and talking authoritatively can do for you. It's all acting, baby. In the DVD special features, you meet the actual guy who did all of this and listen to him talk about his experiences, I thought it was pretty fascinating because I can't imagine actually doing any of those things. The guy racked up about 5 million in forged checks and bank fraud, landed in jail for about 6 years but has been working for the FBI in catching criminals like himself for the past 20 years and he's paid huge amounts of money to design new security features for check companies. talk about the american dream alive and well.   King Nigel is a great name for your puppy, DJS. Panda and I once had a half-mannequin man named Nigel. He rocked. Dressed in blue speedos and hats that correlated with the seasons. Panda, what happened to poor Nigel?

       Well, this just in...   I'm like you Panda, I like giving them real people names.  I had a little dog like the one I'm getting, but he looked more like the Taco Bell dog, just much...much cuter.  One of the original names I threw out was Bill and that got shot down.  Ironically, I just suggested Nigel not too long ago, too.  I like that one too.  Right now, we're both in agreement on  Kenobi .  I'm serious.

       I like King Friday, but how about...   Some dog name suggestions  by Panda  If I'd ever get a dog again (Smokey, RIP ya trooper), I'd name it a ridiculous person name.  For example, the name Clarence always cracks me up.  That and Stanley.  Some others:  Bob Clyde Dennis Dave Miles Ned Cliff Shamus  Nigel Rodney  Caesar Calvin Wolfgang Lamont Harvey Lorenzo Hector Hank  Those are just a few I thought of...there are always more.

       Didn't Bother With Friday Five...Instead, Here's a Self-Serving Question...     1. If you could pick a name for, say, a small little male dog...what would you name him?  Why?    I'm partial to the name Friday for my dog, but it's getting the thumbs down from my partner in crime.  She wants to call him something like Max or Jake, which I think is too common and not very inspired.   But DJS, why Friday?   The lady we're driving 4 hours into Sconie and 4 hours back from has been calling the little guy 'King.'  Like I mentioned, he's the tiny runt of the litter that only weighed 1 pound a few weeks ago.  Since I think that's kind of cute, I thought I'd combine both King & Friday together.  That makes King Friday, the puppet king in Mister Roger's Neighborhood.  Plus, who wouldn't like a dog named Friday?   "Hey, there's DJS...but what's that creature walking with him?"   "Oh, that's his dog, Friday."  Am I crazy?  Lemme hear ya Pandylanders!!!  This isn't the kind of post that will do me much good after today!!!  Holla!

       Spanish Villa   I've been cleaning out my apartment tonight (getting ready for the big move, what can I say - I'm a dork.  I plan ahead.).  In my cleaning, I stumbled across some of my old piano music and guitar tablature...specifically the lyrics to a song that was performed by a band Bassy and I were a part of during our good ol' college days.  The name of this band?  "5 Below."  (There were 5 of us.  Gay, we know.  At least we didn't call ourselves "Serendipity", one of the other choices.)  Anyway, looking at these lyrics again made me laugh out loud.  The song was written by our good friend Nemo (not to be confused with the new animated Disney character).  I never paid much attention to the meaning of them, but looking at them now, it seems he was having a, shall we say, "lovers' quarrel" with someone.  The "Spanish Villa" refers to an apartment building that was close to the UST campus; a building inhabited mostly by college students, in this case - Nemo.  When you read these lyrics, imagine a Spanish-style guitar rhythm.  If I would have had a sombrero at our gig, this song would make dancing around it appropriate.  Here they are [with my comments, of course]:   What will you find? It cannot be alive the anger in your eyes,  For life  [he's pissed!]   I won't even try to understand why these feelings arise,  Again  [doesn't rhyme, but whatever...this was always an awkward stop in the song.]   Chorus:    It comes out at night, right beyond Marshall's lights;  [that would be Marshall Ave. in St. Paul]  It's a fear that I can't control Some things never change, some things I can't do Why don't you just follow your heart?    Leave me here to die  [in front of the Spanish Villa he could have gotten shot, I suppose?]  Just do it polite  [how does one leave someone to die politely?]  Go flee this night You lied  All I can try to believe is my life I didn't try to lie Again  [another awkward pause.]  (Chorus)   It's not a crime to see the signs the anguish in your eyes  [first anger, then anguish in her eyes...this girl is all over the place.]  Tonight  Oh yeah, I tried to be on your side I really did lie Again  [wait, I'm confused.  First he said he didn't try to lie, then he really did?  And she lied too?  Liars!]  (Chorus)  End.  Bow.  Gracias amigos!  Si, si!

      I like small dogs.  It's true.  Panda... why didn't you say you had a pool?  I'm going to visit you ALL THE TIME.  That's sweet!  By the way, have you thought about why you went over there the other night?  I mean seriously... it can't just be the t-shirt and dessert pan.  I have nothing else to say.  Sorry.  But congrats to you two on your recent successes...

      That's a miniature pincher.  Anyone who says: 'That's not a real dog!' gets their teeth kicked in.  I like all dogs, big or small.  Turns out, we live in a townhouse and will stay there for another couple of years.  It would be grossly unfair to have a big dog in a place where we don't even have our own yard.  We haven't thought of a name for him yet.  But yeah, he's tiny.  At eight weeks old, he weighed one pound.  He should top off at a whopping 5-6 pounds.

       It's Official   After 4-1/2 years in the same studio apartment, I'm moving in August!  It's currently a renter's market in Chi, so I took advantage of the good price on a one-bedroom...just down the street from where I am now and still only a block from the lake.  Finally, I will have more space, and can have more than 2 people over at one time.  Plus, there's an indoor pool (not that I'm actually going to use it, but it's a cool thing to have, I suppose).  Another bonus: my apartment number is "311"...like the band.  Won't forget that one.  I'm even thinking of buying a car.  And that's not crazy talk!  Hey DJS, what kind of dog is that?  A Rott puppy?  It looks like the smallest dog ever.  Does he currently work for Taco Bell?

       Contrast to a couple of days ago...   You know how it seemed like my day was shit on Tuesday?  It's amazing what another 24 hours or so can do.  Firstly, I've been working like a madman to get the editing on my 2nd book done.  I'm making huge strides and I'm like halfway done, methinks.  I've set somewhat unrealistic goals to reach every week and amazingly, I've been able to meet them.  (pat on back)  If all goes well, I should have a readable version of my latest and greatest to share with my eager readers.  On top of that, I've been continuing correspondence with a children's author who has been giving me all kinds of leads and the 'go-ahead' to drop his name when writing to agents.  Keep them fingers crossed, kids.  Secondly...remember how I was going to be a goddamned hero and join the fire department on an on-call basis?  Well, I had an interview a couple of weeks ago and I thought it went well.  They told me that they'd contact me in the next week if they were interested in bringing me to stage 2.  A week went by, then another.  After my softball game last night, I got the mail and saw a letter from the city of Woodbury.  Shit.  I cracked it open and was ready to say 'Goddammit' when I discovered it was letting me know that I made it to stage 2 and that I had to go to a meeting next week.  Yeah!  Thirdly...I'm in the worst physical shape I've ever been in.  EVER!  To combat that, I'm going back to kickboxing.  I've worked out a schedule that allows me to workout just about everyday and not disrupt my normal schedule too much.  This probably seems lame to most, but I've been yearning to get back in the ring and knock some suckas out.  My new regimen starts next week, yo.  Fourthly - We get to go and pick this little guy up on Saturday:     Anyway...that's my good news this week.   'Everyone knows these are rock hard times...'

      PB & the Get Drunk Crew,  No, I think the whole fiance thang is working just fine.  It's all my fault, yo.  've just got a bad habit of scheduling stuff for myself without checking the calendar for plans we've made MONTHS in advance.  I hate myself for it, but I'm growing, learning, yearning to become better at not doing that so much.  So...my plan was to drive back from Mankato 1.5 hours in time to rendezvous with you cats at the agreed-upon location.  I've worked it out with the missus and I think we've reached a compromise we can all live with.  However, if Friday the 20th would work for everyone else, that would save me an extra trip and make everyone happy.  Plus...isn't it better to get your driggity-drink on Friz-i-day?  Methinks so...  As for the Eels concert, there's not way around it.  I've paid for portion of the cabin and it's too damn far to justify driving back and forth to see E and the crew.  Damn me.  Damn everything.   'Saturday morning...who's gonna play with me?  6 in the morning, baby.  I gotta long, long day ahead of me...'   - Eels from the album 'Shootenanny!'

       Old Man Duf' Addresses the Youth of Today  By Duf Fer  Young Peoples,  Concert City for Duf' too:  Coldplay in Chi-town on Monday.  Wilco at the Walker Art Center Sculpture Garden.  Pearl Jam in St. Paul.  R.E.M. in St. Paul.  For you young people, Pearl Jam and R.E.M. are bands that are popular with my generation.  They recorded on cassette and compact disc.  The cassette was a recording medium that served for music listeners in between the LP record and the compact disc.  There was also (briefly) an 8-track player, but I will have to explain that separately.    Rock on,  Duf

       Summer Concerts.  Married Life.  Cold Cubs Game.   DJS, Perhaps this whole fiance thing is not working out so well?  Seems to me, all your fun is ruined because of trips to Northern Minnesota with your beloved. (Need I remind you of skipping out on PBJ3?  That's all I'm sayin'.)  But seriously, how would Friday, June 20th work for you?  Better?  I, too, have been delirious about the concerts I've attended this year/will be attending.  Tori Amos in Mad City (w/Ben Folds in August), Coldplay (seeing 'em again w/ Duf and Hal on Monday - ow!), Yo La Tengo this weekend, Wilco at Summerfest...oh, my spinning head.  DJS, I, too, can feel your bliss.  Duf, I'm shocked and disappointed that you would think I could ever demote you to lame-o status.  I'm not lying when I say your lifestyle is one I long for.  Toenail clippings and all, I want to have a family eventually.  But I am also not ready to have that with just anyone.  God knows I could have had it all last November.  What I'm saying is, the "thrill-a-minute" you describe can get old.  But I enjoy it while I can...and will make sure you do a shot with me at PBJ3 (and perhaps before the big show).  And then I will put you in a cab and make fun of you behind your back.  BB, don't worry, be happy.  Worrying gives you wrinkles, sweetheart.  Hal, to answer your sarcastic question, I'm definitely not inviting Ian to the show, especially since we just had this discourse over e-mail:  "How are you?"  "I'm fine."  "Just out of curiousity...have you figured out why you came over on Saturday night?"  "I wanted my stuff."  "Are you sure that's all?"  "Please don't e-mail me or call me anymore.  Thanks."  I am now taking off to freeze to death at the Cubs game tonight.  Cheers.

       Happy...then Sad.   It's a great day here in the land o' DJS.  I got past what I thought would be a difficult assignment here at work with little or no difficulty and more importantly I was able to sneak out to Electric Fetus to pick up the the EELS album 'Shootenanny!'  {Duf - I tried to call and see if you'd join me.  Alas...twas not to be}  Best part?  It came with a free 4-song EP if you bought it at one of 3 special locations.  Yes!!!  Then came the even better news: the EELS are going to be playing a show at First Avenue on July 22nd!  This is the best day of my life!!!  I'm not a huge concert goer, but I've been known to make it to shows that literally will stop your heart had you been to them.  Seeing one of my all-time favorite bands in the world in a small, intimate venue is like the prequel to what will be a legendary journey to see Ms. Bjork in Colorado.  But I digress...  This has the potential to be an even bigger concert year for me than last year when I saw a veritable ass-pocket of great shows.  Then, the bomb hits:  I'm going to be out of town on 7.22.03, spending a week with my fiance and her family up north in a cabin, some 6-7 hours away from the stage where Mark Oliver Everett, Kooool G Murder, Butch and the rest will be rocking the place to rubble.  Stop the bus.  I'm getting off.

       Sometimes You Post Just to Post  by Duf Fer  Saturday night I was clipping my toenails and arguing about housekeeping.  PB, someday you will have to adjust to my boring life of work and family.  Try to ease into it; your life seems so thrill a minute.  I don't want you die of deceleration trauma.  Also, am I wrong to be worried that I will end up in a cab during PBJ3 and earn the lame-o label?  I better go home and practice drinking.  Bass Babe, during PBJ3, you simply must fill in the blanks of your latest post for me.  There is much unsaid there, BB, much unsaid and we all know that silent waters run deep.  Last, I was sending a thank you letter to Hal, and she saw it in my cube ready for mailing.  The letter is more than a month overdue, so I'm sure she has no clue that I'm thanking her for.  So embarrassing that.

       An Interesting Turn of Events   I was hanging out with some friends on Saturday night at Avenue Tavern...K turned into a drunk lame-o and had to be put in a cab and taken home.  I still wanted to stop by MM's on my way home so I went in, got a free shot from my friend Doug, and sat down next to a nerdy looking guy...I asked Doug to get a shot for him too.  Turned out, this guy was a physicist from Germany who just moved from Southern France to Chicago to work for the Department of Energy.  He was interesting, but I wasn't attracted to him in the least...just nice to talk to (and I had to share my shoddy German with him - knowing how to say "You asshole, go home" auf Deutsche always gets a few laughs).  Well, of course, with him being of the male-asshole-persuasion, he thought this was his cue to get a little touchy feely.  Oh Jesus.  When he excused himself to go to the bathroom, I used the opportunity to get the hell out of there.  I just didn't want to deal.  On my way home, I got a random call from my ex, Ian.  This couldn't get any weirder.  I asked him where he was, he said he was at Nick's Uptown.  I asked him if he was alone, he said he was.  I told him I'd be there in 5 minutes.  This visit with him was going to be strictly selfish on my part - for those of you in the know, he's had some stuff of mine that he's been promising to give back to me, and I intended to get it back that night.  No hanky-panky would be involved. Just an exchange of goods (well, maybe just a one-way exchange).  I saw him, we made small talk, blah, blah...   Here's our conversation, edited as not to completely bore you: Me: "When can I get my shit?"   Dumbass: "I've been meaning to give it to Anu."  Me: "Yeah, I hear you've been giving her other things as well." [Closed circuit: he kissed my friend Anu a week after we broke up.  Whatever.]   Dumbass: "But it was totally innocent...[insert other lame excuses here]"   Me: "I don't care.  We're going to your place and I'm getting my stuff."   Dumbass: "So do you want to go out again sometime?" Me: "You gotta be kidding me."  When we got to his place, he gave me my stuff, and then asked if I wanted to stay for a bottle of wine.  What version of "NO" don't you understand, friend?  I told him I'd see him around and left immediately.  I hope I didn't just open up a can of worms.  But it was all worth it, because I got  urlLink this  back.  Amen.

       Playing Catch Up On Monday...This Is: THE DJS FIVE    1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   Man, this is going to be a heavy one, but here goes.  I'd like to be remembered as someone who is a bona fide 'good guy' that will hopefully encompass my role as husband, father, grandpa, brother, son, you name it.  When I'm gone, I want people to go: 'Remember DJ Shovelpants?  Yeah, he was one of the good ones.  Damn I miss him and his smart mouth.'    A close 2nd would be to have people remember me by my work, and by work I mean my writing, and by writing I mean the stuff that I've been writing for the kids.  You know how I do.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?  Off the cuff: 'As soon as you're born you start dying, so you might as well have a good time.' - Cake   3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?  I'm proud that I've finally found the one person on this planet who I love unconditionally.  Turns out, I'm doubly lucky that I also get to marry this woman in less than a year.    A close 2nd would be the completion of my 2nd novel.  Turns out I really do have a knack for this writing thang...   4. What about the past ten years?  Not sure this qualifies, but I guess that my biggest achievment in the last decade would be getting rid of all the things that held me back over the years: friends who were the equivalent of bags of shit on legs, my cold-hearted non-supportive ex-wife, all the scary, scary ex-girlfriends I've dated, and the attitude that I should just give up on the dreams I've always had and just to get in line with everyone else.  Forget that noise.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?   'That's the way it goes sometimes, but just remember it goes the other way too.'  (I think that was from 'True Romance')

       Instant Karma's Gonna  Got  Me  By Duf Fer  Last night, at poetry group, I workshopped a poem called "Departure."  It is (in early draft and)about a man who is on a flight and thinking about home (in the most connubial sense of the word).  All the other poets hated it and did not understand it and kept telling me that image, without a concrete concept to anchor to, is worthless.  I feel now that my criticism directed at an artist early this week has come full circle to visit me.  Why don't I follow the old maxim related to not having anything nice to say?

One day, Rob came up with one that said "World's Greatest Boss."  The next day, I was victorious with a mug that read "I Have the Best Ideas!"  But the all-time winner is the mug that says: "1984 Tennis Champ." Quality. Unfortunately, we haven't found that mug since.  Someone else must have caught on to our mocking, and took back the mug permanently.

      Closed Circuit to DJS (and anyone else who clicked on his Link O' Day game)  WHAT THE...?  Totally bizarre but I managed to get through the whole game. It's kind of interesting to go into something like that and have no instructions and let the brain work a little magic to try and figure it out. The graphics and Flash work were quite inventive and the little dude smoking opium was a funny, weird addition....  On the other end of the spectrum, I enjoy these games, particularly the Card/Puzzle section and Multi-Player Bowling (great boredom relief for coworkers and myself.)  urlLink My Link O' Day .

       Old School Catholics   I was brought up by an old school Catholic mom - she went to Catholic grade school and an all-girls college.  She has told me stories about when she would go to mass during grade school, and if a girl happened to forget her mass veil, she would have to wear a Kleenex on her head (wouldn't want any hair to show - sinful!).  Needless to say, I was brought up in the Catholic tradition as well.  Catholic grade school, college, AND grad school - the whole nine yards.  I was a bit of a "talker" during my grade school years (shocker) and got smacked upside the head more than a few times by some crotchety old nuns after getting caught "talking to my neighbor" during class. (Side note: why do grade school teachers always refer to your other classmates as "your neighbors"? ie: "Don't look at your neighbor's test" or "Pass the papers back to your neighbor."  Weird.)  So I've been packing for my big move this week, and have stumbled across various things I've forgotten about: old letters, funny pictures, and...old school "prayer cards" that I've collected during my Catholic school years.  I've decided to keep one of them in my wallet for good karma: St. Jude, The Patron Saint of Hopeless Cases.  Because things have gotten kind of hopeless around here, I need all the help I can get.  "Pray for me who am so needy..."

       A Pet Peeve leads to the Tuesday One   My biggest pet peeve:  guys who don't get out of their seats on public transportation for old people, disabled people, or pregnant women.  This morning a woman got on the bus who must have been  at least  8 months pregnant.  She looked as if the baby was going to pop out at any second.  She had to walk all the way to the back of the bus until she got to my seat, and I got up so she could sit down.  She probably passed about 10 men who paid absolutely no attention to this poor woman.    My question to y'all: Is Chivalry Dead?  I'm afraid, in this hardened city, it is.

       What Time Is It?   This sounds like a fairly easy question.  Unless you asked me that about 1 hour ago.  We just upgraded our computers at work, and with the upgrade came some problems - namely, that the time (located at the bottom right corner of most PCs) was set to NYC (Eastern Standard) time.  I'm home an hour early and didn't even mean to do it.  Yay me!  Let's hope  urlLink this  doesn't happen to me tomorrow.

       The Truth  By Duf Fer  I really don't have any feelings about the Liz Phair album one way or another.  I am just hurting because Bob Hope is dead, and I needed to lash out.  I'm sorry.

       Steamin' Mad At Dirt   I'll fight the both of you.  How dare you not like something that I enjoy?  I jest and I'm definitely going to let it go.  There's no point in trying to convince you of Liz's merits if you've already branded the album as horrible.  I don't agree, but I'd be wasting my time if I tried to outline a convincing argument about how y'all are just wrong, wrong, wrong...  For the record, my favorite Liz Phair album is 'Whip Smart.'  I remember seeing the video for 'Supernova' where Lizzie is wearing a motorcycle helmet and playing the guitar like it's going out of style.  She won me over forever during that video because, despite what all of her nay-sayers (not you guys in particular) she came off as someone that definitely doesn't take herself too seriously.  Gotta like that.

       My 0.02   First impression - any song (with the probable exception of "Lil' Digger" and "H.W.C.") coulda been a track on the next Britney/Xtina/Avril/Pink CD.  It's true.  That said, I wouldn't feel let down if Britney/Xtina/Avril/Pink sang the same songs, because that's all they can do.  However, I think we all know that Ms. Phair can do better.  And has done better.

       I Should Let it Go  By Duf Fer  Your point is a pretty good one as far as it goes.  You have to recognize "Exile in Guyville" for what it was though (a rebuttal to the Rolling Stones's "Exile on Main Street").  Divorced from that context, then smut just seems like smut.  Consider "Whip Smart."  Consider "whitechocolatespaceegg."  "Exile in Guyville" was fresh and a good idea well executed.  Liz's new idea is "sell more records."  Not only that, it's not well executed.  It's a bad idea, badly done.    Also, I have oodles of albums that are wildly popular.  I like thin pop music (you can't beat the Go Gos for that), and I like complex stuff that is seen by many as inaccessible (The Sonic Youth is probably the most widely known example).    Look, Liz can do whatever the hell she wants.  The bottom line is that if you are John Updike and your next book comes out and it's John Grisham, people are going to completely demolish you by evaluating you in light of your past efforts.   I don't over value producers either.  Hey, it's all good.  One of Liz's other producers works with Pete Yorn, and I dig his stuff immensely.  But if you are Liz, and your start thinking I want the producer to change my sound so that I can sell more records, you have to know you are going to take some knocks for that.  Of course, if you are Justin Timberlake, you really need N*E*R*D.  Ask yourself this though:  is there a consistent musical thread on this disc?  Can you see a dramatic difference between tracks based on who is producing?  What does that say about the source of the art?  Is is Liz, or is it her label?  Is she trying to save her contract or what?    For me, what this argument comes down to is this:  there is a whole wide world of pop music with texture and flair and (yes) mass appeal (I think Madonna qualifies here, and I would add Maxwell, there are many, many others).  One can be popular and widely enjoyed without being shitty.  Liz, in an effort to reach more people, dumbed down and simplified and changed her sound and it was so foreign to her that she cannot convince anyone who knows her that this is what is within her, that this is the reflection of some burning internal drive.  In short, she's completely lost, adrift.  She has no clue what she is doing, and it shows on the disc.  Look, I still listen to my copy of "Like a Virgin" from time to time. There is something there that is worth returning too, and you can't get more calculated for mass appeal than that.  I will leave my argument to this. If you still listen to this new Liz Phair CD even a year from now, I will eat her nasty underwear and say it's my "favorite."

       The Following Post Is Rated R...you've been warned.   Okay, I wanted to stay out of this but here's a comparison for ya.   Flower  is taken from Liz Phair's 'Exile in Guyville.'  I'll also include the lyrics to  'H.W.C'  from her self-titled and much bally-hooed self-titled effort.   Flower    Everytime I see your face I get all wet between my legs Everytime you pass me by, I heave a sigh of pain  Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste I want to fuck you like a dog I'll take you home and make you like it Everything you ever wanted Everything you ever thought of Is everything I'll do to you I'll fuck you and your minions, too Your face reminds me of a flower Kind of like you're underwater Hair's too long and in your eyes Your lips a perfect "suck me" size You act like you're fourteen years old Everything you say is so obnoxious, funny, true and mean I want to be your blowjob queen You're probably shy and introspective That's not part of my objective I just want your fresh, young jimmy Turning, slamming, ramming in me Everytime I see your face I think of things unpure, unchaste I want to fuck you like a dog I'll take you home and make you like it Everything you ever wanted Everything you ever thought of Is everything I'll do to you I'll fuck you till your dick is blue  Everytime   And now, for your comparison pleasure, here are the lyrics for  'H.W.C.'    H.W.C.    Give it to me, don't give it away Don't think about what the others say My skins getting clear, my hairs so bright All you do is fuck me every day and night  You're my secret beauty routine Na, na, na, na, what my body has seen I am lookin' good and I'm feeling nice Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum  I'm gonna pull you back down between the sheets Everything is fresher when the day is sweet In the morning light when you're already on the phone  Face it, one of these days Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray It's the fountain of youth It's the meaning of life So hot, so sweet, so wet my appetite  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum  Face it, one of these days Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray It's the fountain of youth It's the meaning of life Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Your hot white cum.   Personally, I think the lyrics in 'Flower' are a bit more carnal and smutty than the lyrics of 'H.W.C.'  I'd be hard pressed to find someone who disagrees with me.  So she says 'cum' a couple times.  No big deal.  My two cents:  I can't and won't limit myself to the music (books & movies) I enjoy solely by their artistic merit.  I can't.  I had a friend growing up (and I'm not making parallel comparisons, please don't think that's my intent) who did that to the point where it bordered on ridiculous.  If a CD he purchased sold more than 10,000 copies, it was immediately brought to Cheapo (where they don't give you much for CDs.  Might I suggest BookSmart or Half-Price Books?).  The reason being?  He didn't want his collection tainted with music that was considered popular or loved by the masses.  He has over 1,000 CDs in his collection and you'd be lucky to find 50 that you recognize.  Like Panda, I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion.  There's no point in it.  You either dig something, or you don't.  For me, I like Liz Phair's new album.  Do I love it?  No, but I don't hate it either.  To me, it doesn't seem like she's thrown all of her old tricks away to completely sell out.  Not at all.  Yeah, she's trying to reach a new audience and there's always that risk of alienating your old fans.  I read somewhere that she recorded a few albums between this one and 'whitechocolatespaceegg' that she absolutely hated and scrapped completely, never to see the light of day.  I'm sorry, but I like me some variety.  If you were to go through my CD collection, bookshelves, and wall of DVDs I think you'd see a pretty broad cross-section of titles.  I can't overly concern myself with what is too commercial, too popular or what lacks artistic merit.  It's too limiting for me.  I like really shitty movies and I like ones that are though-provoking and make the hair on my arms stand up.  Same goes with music.  I can't concern myself with who produced what track and what their motivations were for doing so.  If Liz wanted The Matrix to produce a couple of tracks to give her sound a more wide appeal, then so be it.  I could care less that he produced Avril Lavigne's album.  So what?  That seems to be a foothold for most of the critics of Liz's new album.  Well, does that mean I should hate one of my favorite groups N.E.R.D. because the people in the group produced Justin Timberlake's album or a song or two for Britney Spears?  Nope.  Okay...this became a rant without me wanting it to be, but let me close with saying that I'm not absolutely in love with the new Liz Phair CD, but I like it well enough that I'm looking forward to seeing her perform again with some friends.  I've read plenty of reviews of her album and none of them (save for People magazine) have been favorable.  The bottom line is: it's not art and I don't think it's pretending to be.  It's just a different direction for an artist that people were expecting more (of the same) from.

       There's Change and then There's Change  By Duf Fer  Here's my point:  artists have to evolve over time, but evolution should reflect artistic growth.  If U2 reproduced their "Boy" sound over and over, it would get tedious after 20 years.  Radiohead has changed and evolved over the years too.  "Pablo Honey" sounds different from "Hail to the Theif," but you recognize both as Radiohead.  What Liz did is change  genres .  She went from alt rock to pop.  That is a huge change.  She went from the company of Patti Smith and PJ Harvey (artists) to the company of Avril Levigne and Christina Aguilera (marketers).  She has dumbed her lyrics down to the point that I don't even recognize her (compare the lyrics of F*** and Run from Exile in Guyville (with their capacity to surprise and educate) to the banal lyrics of H.W.C. (nothing but smut) on this new piece of trash CD and you will see what I mean.  Change is inevitable.  Degradation could be avoided.  If the hiatus left her with nothing to say, better to fall silent; I'm all for single mom's providing for their illegitimate children, but I also hate to see an artist become a marketer and Liz Phair used to be about something besides making money.

       I'm Not Here to Change Anyone's Mind   So I'm not going to try, but didn't we  just  talk about respecting a band's desire to change?  Whether you think Liz has changed for the better or for the worst, she is evolving in some way.  If y'all wanted Exile in Guyville Part Deux, it's just not going to happen. (Kind of like how I wanted The Bends Revisited.)  Here's a single mom, looking as HOT as ever, singing dirty lyrics, and, after 5 years of being on the sidelines, she's playing SOLD-OUT shows again.  If I hear one more person say she's "sold out" I think I'm going to puke.  After more than 10 years in the biz, she still has ambitions - commercial ones at that.  I say more power to her.  But I have to admit, I'm not going to her show - primarily because I know with her new sound (and the fact that her songs are played on  urlLink "The Eric and Crappy Show" ) the venue will be filled with  urlLink these girls .  In other news: I take the bus to work everyday and pass the park across the street from my house.  There are always a few bums laying around underneath the trees, catching some zzz's.  Well, I've been noticing this one bum who has been there for the last few mornings.  I think he might be dead... What I should do is go over by him and poke him with a stick, just to be sure.

       Liz Sucks but Doesn’t Swallow  By Duf Fer   I have a dilemma:   A group of friends and I are planning to go to the Liz Phair show in Minneapolis on August 28th.  I bought a ticket at the oh so nice price of $15.  On my recent trip to Birmingham, I forgot to pack CD's, so I bought the new Liz Phair disc (and the new Annie Lennox disc) at the Atlanta airport (the prices were not so bad really).  Pause for a CD memory:   CD memory:   My preference is to buy only one CD at a time.  It gives me a chance to fully listen to the CD without the pressure of checking out two discs at once.  I almost never follow this rule, but I often try.  Every once in awhile, I will get two discs at once and they will both blow me away.  One example that comes to mind is that I bought Billy Bragg and Wilco's “Mermaid Avenue” and the Putamayo disc “Memphis to Mali An African American Odyssey” on the same trip - both are certified Duf' platinum.  Back to the dilemma:   The dilemma:   I hate the new Liz Phair CD.  Honestly, I have not had such a strong negative reaction to a disc since, well, ever.  It is absolutely horrible.  I like "Extraordinary" well enough as a forgettable pop song (produced by The Matrix of Avril Levigne fame – why would an established artist like Liz Phair want to emulate Avril Levigne?), and Love/Hate conjures up the Liz of old, but the rest of the disc is borderline deplorable.  There are moments that are desperate like "Favorite" and there are moments that are sick.  "H.W.C," which stands for hot white cum "give me your hot, white cum" is the easiest example (she plans to use it for healthy skin by the way).  Now, before you label Duf a prude, let me say that I have plenty of dirty discs.  No problem there.  In college, I had a copy of the Too Live Crew's uberdirty album “Too Live is What We Are,” and I dug it for a long time.  “You said it yourself, you like it like I do…” ah memories.  Now I may seem like a sexist - how can I own a bunch of dirty discs and give Liz a hard time for being candid?  Well, its because I also own "Exile in Guyville" and "Whip Smart." I even have "whitechocolatespaceegg." All three discs are quite candid and frank in sexual conversations, all are thick with smart music and some pop sensibility but mostly  all three discs are thick with clever lyrics .  Somehow, none of those discs are crass and vulgar.  I just don't believe that Liz feels this way.  I think she is adapting her style to sell records (and she has said as much).    The two things I like most in music are passion and honesty.  People ask me how I can love Vladimir Horowitz and Sonic Youth with equal devotion, it is because the one thing you cannot deny is that they are sincere and passionate.  They really feel what they are expressing.  It makes their art pure.  It’s like going to a KoKo Taylor show.  You know that she is singing from her soul. She sings because she is a singer; she could not care less if singing made her a millionaire or the poorest woman in Chicago.  One the other hand, Liz Phair is trying to make some extra money by being dirty and applying formulas, and her impurity has corrupted the entire disc.  It’s trash.  I will be at Cheapo before the sun sets.  Also, I'll take my ticket to the show and sell it to someone who would like to see her.  I ain't the one.

       Friday 5 to Make Up for Lack of Posts   Sorry, I've been busy in NYC.     1. What were your favorite childhood stories?  I loved "Goodnight Moon", "The Story of Ferdinand", "Corduroy", "Eloise", and "The Snowy Day."  I always thought Dr. Suess books were weird and I think the illustrations scared me.   2. What books from your childhood would you like to share with [your] children?  All of them...I can't wait to read to my future kids.  My mom read to us very early which had 2 results: 1) for me, I learned to read by age 4, and 2) it made my brother hate reading.  So I guess it's a crap-shoot.   3. Have you re-read any of those childhood stories and been surprised by anything?  "Goodnight Moon" is pretty boring now.  I probably just liked the pictures when I was little...it's definitely a baby book - for kids 3 and under.   4. How old were you when you first learned to read?  oh, I guess I mentioned this before - 4.   5. Do you remember the first 'grown-up' book you read? How old were you?  I don't remember the "first" grown-up book I read, but I remember really enjoying "The Secret Garden" when I was in 2nd Grade.  I loved the fantasy in it, and when Mary finally finds the sick boy in the house and takes him outside.  They turned the book into  urlLink a movie  in 1993, and it was so fascinating for me to watch because a lot of the scenes (the house, garden, etc) looked exactly how I had pictured them in my head.

       I'm a sexist pig?   First off, true sharing - like many women (back me up, BB and Panda!) I go to a fancy salon and pay a lot of money to "professionals" who smear hot wax on my unwanted hair for the purpose of violently ripping the hair out by the roots.  For the most part, I reserve this pleasant experience for the hair around my eyes, commonly referred to as the "eyebrows".  This is a semi-regular thing for me, and in the few years I've been having this done, I have always had the service performed by females.  When I made an appointment at the usual place, I was informed that "David" will be waxing me today.  I think that David is a man.  I'll be honest - I'm worried.  Unlike a bad haircut/dye job/manicure, you can't just cover up a poorly done eyebrow wax.  If it's crooked, or say, they remove your entire eyebrow altogether (!!!), you can't just cover it up or pull it back into a ponytail.  I hope this "David" person knows what he's doing, and doesn't have a thing for  urlLink Marlene Dietrich ...  Agh!

If I did, I'd be posting this from my yacht (sailing in an undisclosed area, due to security concerns), and not my cube.  Yesterday I watched an oldy but goody -  urlLink Rattle and Hum .  It may surprise some that I had gone a couple years without viewing it.  In fact, since getting the DVD version a couple of Christmas's ago, I don't think I'd actually watched the darn thing.  Anyway... watching it again reminded me why  urlLink I love that group  so.  If you haven't seen it, well, please do.  Next week I'm traveling to Cleveland (via Detroit) just so that I can go the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and catch  urlLink the U2 exhibit .  I'm looking forward to it.  So much so, that last night (note - after watching R&H) I dreamt that I was in a panic because I went to the Hall and forgot to see the U2 stuff.    I need help.   urlLink But I'm not going to get it .

       I Meant to do this Friday 5 Last Week   So here goes:   1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?  Amy T.  She lived down the street from me and we went to the same Catholic grade school together.  We were always doing stupid stuff, but what I remember most is riding bikes.  Remember riding bikes ALL THE TIME, when you were little?  That was so great.  I had a yellow banana seat Schwinn.  With a basket.  And we really loved stickers.  I have to admit, that was pretty lame.   2. Are you still in touch with this person?  Unfortunately, not.  When we got to Junior High age, my family moved and we both went to different schools on opposite sides of the city.  We ended up going to the same high school 3 years later, but it definitely wasn't the same.  We both had different friends by then and just ended up saying "hi" to each other if we saw one another in the hall.  It was kind of sad.  I know she's married now and lives in Wisconsin, so that's cool.  The only reason I know this is because I have a very nosy mother who keeps up with these things...   3. Do you have a current close friend?  In addition to my close friends in Minneapolis, my best friend in Chicago is Ms. T.  She's my partner-in-crime.  We go drinking together, pick up men together, and generally get in trouble together.  She's been in Guatemala for the last 3 weeks on vacation, and I've missed her terribly.  When we're both in town, we don't go a day without talking...at least a couple times.   4. How did you become friends with this person?  We were in a class in Thailand together.  I actually thought she was a ditzy, snob-and-a-half party girl when we were there and didn't really hang out with her.  Not until we got back and took our last MBA class together (and were in the same final business plan group) did we hit it off.  Kind of weird.  Just goes to show how you should give people the benefit of the doubt.   5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?  Jenny G. from High School.  She was my best friend junior and senior year and really opened my eyes up to different (make that, fun) things.  The first time I got drunk was with her.  We used to go to her house during our lunch hour (she lived across the street) and she'd smoke pot...one weekend we made a trip to Madison for "Harvest Fest" to hear speeches on legalizing pot or wearing hemp clothing.  (I was very innocent, so this seemed like a huge deal to me.)  Her and her parents (professors) were uber-liberal, opening up my then close-mindedness towards other political and social issues.  She was an all-around cool and interesting person.  I recently e-mailed her out of the blue by getting her e-mail from classmates.com, but haven't followed up with a phone call.  Maybe I'll do that soon...

       Friday Five  By Duf Fer   1. When was the last time you cheated?  On Monday.  DJS and I took a co-worker out for a burrito lunch.  DJS ordered a burrito with extra chicken and received extra chicken.  However, we were not charged for extra chicken and I knew it.  So, I cheated Chipotle out of $1.50 worth of chicken.   2. When was the last time you stole?  On Monday.  DJS and I took a co-worker out for a burrito lunch.  DJS ordered a burrito with extra chicken and received extra chicken.  However, we were not charged for extra chicken and I knew it.  So, I stole $1.50 worth of chicken from Chipotle.   3. When was the last time you lied?  In a post earlier this week, I lied about the size of my loins.   4. When was the last time you broke or vandalized another's property?  I broke a china plate at my in-law's house, while kissing ass by washing dishes.  The hard to replace plate was found on e-Bay along with additional pieces that were missing from their set.  They ended up thanking me for inspiring them to complete their set.   5. When was the last time you hurt a loved one?  Mrs. Duf and I had another argument two nights ago ('tis the season?).  She looked hurt at one point.  The only details I can offer are that we are working on a project and had some third party advice that I see as having general value, but that she sees as having specific value.  In disagreeing with her, I think I was too aggressive and logical and indirectly (and without intending to do so), dismissive of her view.

And that the townspeople are glaring at them thinking "Ha ha...your dad's in hell"? Call me insane but a) people just don't care that much about their fellow townspeople and b) get over it.

       This is Never Going to Work  By Duf Fer  Liz Phair - nope (I was down with Exile in Guyville, but she's lost me since then).  White Stripes - works for me, but I know of at least one hater.  Run DMC - walk this way.  Sure thing, baby.  Hootie & the Blowfish - trying desperately to think of a song of theirs to lampoon.  Failing.  I think I better vote them off the island.  Yanni - I'm all the way down.  All the way.  Not.  Public Enemy - I'm just guessing that PB has fallen off since "It Takes a Nation of Millions..."  Winger - 3/4 sleeve tees make me look even fatter than I am.  I won't even tell you what a mullet does to my appearance.  Rick Astley - never gonna choose him up.

       How do you choose?   I lay down my picks for the Pandyland band:  Sting The Police The Black Lashes Pete Yorn Celine Dion 50 Cent Clay Aiken  Sorry Duf, Radiohead & REM have failed to make my list. But I think you'll find the other choices presented here are just as worthy...

      Dr. Duf,  Graphic novels?  I got a stack you need to peek through.  First and foremost  urlLink Sin City  by Frank Miller.  I'm going to bring them in (I have all of them) for you to enjoy.  Next up?  Stray Bullets by David Lapham.  You would also probably like Strangers in Paradise as well.  Don't worry...none of these are geeky super-hero graphic novels.  They're more like Pulp Fiction-y stories with some really kick-ass art.  Over-all band for the Pandyland crew?  Some quick thoughts:  Liz Phair White Stripes Run DMC Hootie & the Blowfish Yanni Public Enemy Winger Rick Astley  I don't know...these just came to me.

       I'm learning a lot.   When you agree to buy a place, you have to sign a lot of things.  I know, I know, "just wait until you close"... anyway, I had to sign like 15 places, to verify that I am aware that I can look up the location of registered level 3 sex offenders online.  (Insert your own Panda's-latest-boyfriend joke here)  I wasn't too interested in this info, as it's considered unreliable (people move and don't register like they're supposed to) and all offenders had a first time offense, before which there would be no online listing.  Curiosity got the best of me, so I went to  urlLink the address , and typed in my new zip code.  Nothing.  Then my current zip code.  Nothing.  Then the zip code for my parents, and you guessed it, nothing.  Finally I entered the zip where my two nieces (ages 9 and 2),  and newphew (age 8) live (along with a new kid to be delivered in November).  Five offenders.  Great.  I knew it was the 'hood, but reading what put these dudes in prision makes the 'hood feel less "ghetto couch on the front porch" and more "violent rape attack on unsuspecting victim".  Too much information.

       A Few Words to the Pandylandaz   Duf: I am with you.  Let's find a band, etc we all can agree on.  I'm on board with REM, but don't know about the rest of y'all.  Frank Sinatra is a guy you can't argue with either.  (Fly Me to the Moon, people.)  I'd say Alabama, but don't want to get beat to a bloody pulp.  DJS: Would it kill you to shave a little off my hips when you use Photo Shop?  Help me out, friend!  Bassy: Best Haikus Ever.  You need to channel your creativity like this more often.  Hal: Now that you won't be house-hunting anymore and have freed up some of your time, you can concentrate on looking for a new job for me.  No?  Then I will be your personal maid/chef/greeter in your new place.  C'mon, you can afford me!

       For the Good of the 'Land  By Duf Fer  Suddenly is seems important to me to find a musical artist (band or solo or duo) who we all agree is bomb-diggity (is it still hip to say bomb-diggity?  Is it still hip to say hip?  Hepabruthaout, y'all).  DJS is not down with U2 so don't go there.  BB is not up on the Radiohead tip, so squash that.  I won't even bring up my favorites, because I get depressed when you kids have not heard of bands that I liked in my youth and whatnot (R.E.M., The Pixies, Otis Redding, etc.).  Somebody throw out a life preserver and save this sinking blog!  No Justin Timberlake please.  Thanks in advance.

       Me, an Interpreter?   Duf, I'm not quite sure I want to be the future interpreter of all things Family Duf.  Especially if the end result is you ending up on the Barcalounger/Lazy-Boy/Sectional/Davenport.  (GASP - I  said  the "D" word.)  (Side note: you sleeping on the Barcalounger gives you something in common with my little brother.  During Summerfest weekend, my little bro ended up on the Barcalounger in our hotel room on one drunken evening.  But this is only because his wife passed out in bed with me, and he didn't want to share a bed with Hal.  Who could blame him?  She snores.)  So all this Radiohead babble is getting a little exhausting.  DJS, I sold  Pablo Honey .  Deal with it.  I just have bad memories with that album and it was more of a cathartic thing than anything.  And like I care what some clown making minimum wage at Cheapo thinks?  Let's talk about something new...like Liz Phair's new masterpiece.  She sold out?  Who cares...her songs still (esp. H.W.C.) speak to me.  Her lyrics are still dirty, dirty, dirty.  Isn't that all that counts?  As y'all said about Radiohead, I much prefer to be surprised and entertained and enjoy an artist's changes over time.

       How I Can Love BB Like I Used To Love BB/How Long to Sing This Song?/PB is a Goddess, I Know this After a Night on the Barcalounger  By Duf Fer  1.  BB, I don't think you have to leave the 'land, and I still love you, I just love you differently.  Please give  The Bends  a spin.  If I burn it for you, will you at least try it?  Please.  It may be our last chance.  We may have to search for other musical common ground if you persist in your communistic refusal to embrace the movement.  2.  Phoebe Cates is 40 today.  I heard it on NPR.  [Pause for Fast Times at Ridgemont High flashback].  3.  PB:  my wife, upon reading your post about "things are going to have to change around here", thinks you are a goddess (I told her you were not a goddess; she said she hated me and made me sleep on the couch).  Anyway, I may call on you as an interpreter during future altercations.

       Radiohead Y'all...   Yeah, the new Radiohead album isn't my favorite of theirs, I'll admit.  But damn if it doesn't do something to me!  My first listen I was kind of like 'Okay, I know these guys know what the hell they're doing, but this needs to grow on me, yo.'  And it did.  Like a rash...but one of those rashes you don't mind so much.  You know the kind...  I've lost you, haven't I?  First of all, I'm having a hard time believing anyone could sell  Pablo Honey .  What?  That's like an essential rock album.  Yeah, they played the piss out of 'Creep' on the radio, but still...there's tons and tons of delicious musical nuggets to be ingested.  I can't even imagine the look on the person's face  at the 2nd hand CD store when that album ends up in the 'I-want-to-sell-these pile.'   "What?  You're actually getting rid of this?  For $3?"  To each their own, I guess.  (Panda, you're crazy.  That's all I'm sayin'.)  Like Duf sez:  It's hard to rank these albums.  Each of them is different to me.  Yeah, there are threads of their previous effort woven into each one, but they are definitely stand-alone works that can't be ignored.  Here goes...  1. Kid A 2. OK Computer 3. Pablo Honey 4. Amnesiac 5. Hail To The Thief 6. The Bends  I know, it's probably blasphemy to cite  'The Bends'  as my least favorite, but as mentioned in previous posts (Duf's namely) this isn't to say I think it's a shitty album.  They all get top marks in my book and admittedly, I jumped on the Radiohead bandwagon with  'OK Computer.'   A lot of my rankings have to do with where I was in my life at the time the albums came out.  When I get a new Radiohead CD I tend to listen to it to death and I found myself listening to Kid A probably the most.  Interesting side note: I was planning on writing a book (a mystery/thriller-type) while listening to Radiohead.  I wanted to set kind of a dark, strange tone in my narrative.  I wrote 16 pages of it and thought it sucked.  Oh well, it was worth the try.

Fortunately I have found an outlet in  urlLink haiku ...

       My Radiohead Rankings  by PB   1) The Bends 2) The Bends 3) The Bends 4) OK Computer 5) Hail to the Thief   My copy of The Bends was signed by the band (including the most impish, googly-eyed lead singer in existence, Thom Yorke) at the Let It Be record store in Minneapolis after their show at First Ave.  This album will always be special to me, not just because it was signed, but because I had a truly spiritual experience at that show.  (Picture being literally lifted off your feet by the pulsating crowd during the song  Black Star .)  Plus, it's a great album to put on for a little "Uszzzzzsh", if you know what I mean. (OK Computer has some ussszzzzsh factor, too.)    I sold my copy of Pablo Honey, and after listening to Amnesiac and Kid A several times in the record store, I couldn't buy them.  Sorry, Duf.    Conflict is good.

      No roses, but I did buy myself a condo today (in St. Paul for those interested, in Highland Park for the nosy).  Technically I don't get it until next month, but I'm still excited to pick up my own little six figure debt.  It's cute (small) and charming (not all the amenities I wanted) and I'm excited.  And as a bonus, I get covered parking and a slightly smaller commute.  It's all very adult.

       Oh No...A Conflict in the 'Land!   I love the new Radiohead album.  If you compare it to 90% of the stuff out there, you have to admit it is art.  If you compare it to past Radiohead, you may not love it the most.    Still, I like it as a complete work, but I also really like a lot of the songs.  Namely:  "2+2=5", "Sit Down Stand Up", "Go to Sleep", "There There" (the one that is getting airplay) and "Myxomatosis".  But the one song that makes the whole album is "Where I End and You Begin" ("I will eat you alive" - indeed).  If you don't like that track, then you don't like Radiohead.  The bass (BB take note) at the beginning is everything:  sex, truth, God, art, poetry, literature, drugs, pain, redemption and dishonesty.  As I listen to the entire album, I feel like I get their meaning.    DJS and I went lunch with this cool guy NeB, and he said something that I think is spot on.  No two Radiohead albums are really alike.   Pablo Honey  and  The Bends  are pretty close, and obviously there are similarities between  Kid A  and  Amnesiac , but other than that, they have changed quite a bit.  I like  Hail to the Thief  almost as much because it can stand on its own as a bold musical statement and because it represents a variation on the theme that makes Radiohead what it is:  evolution and change.  You either like that they change from album to album a lot, or you don't.  It can be maddening after a flawless album like  The Bends  when you feel like you could love many albums almost just like it, but then you would never get an  OK Computer  if they always stuck with that The-Bends sound.    And now, without further adieu, here is my ranking of Radiohead (studio) albums:  1.   OK Computer  2.   The Bends  3.   Kid A  4.   Pablo Honey  5.   Hail to the Thief  6.   Amnesiac   The main thing is this:  there is not one on the list that I would not give an "A" rating.  In fact, I love them all. The difference between the rankings is so slight that I almost could not do it.  A year from now, I might have them all inverted.  Anyway, what are your Radiohead rankings Pandylandaz?

       A Couple Brief Album Reviews    Radiohead's  Hail to the Thief    If I read another review of this album that says you have to listen to it a few times to "truly" appreciate it, I'm going to puke.  I'm a  Bends  girl, therefore  urlLink I'm not really feelin'  this album.  That's it.   Annie Lennox's  Bare    Very different from Radiohead, but whatever.  Can this woman wail.  I love this record and her attitude about making it.  The cover art and her explanation was particularly intriguing to me: "I am not a young artist in their early twenties.  I am a mature woman facing up to the failed expectations of life and facing up to 'core' issues.  I don't want to represent myself visually in some kind of cliched, airbrushed, saccharine kind of way."  Go, Annie.

       My First Guess   Duf, as a woman with (fairly) normal womanly traits, I know how we have tendencies to express something (perhaps very strongly), while actually being concerned about something totally different.  Here's what I think is happening: Mrs. Duf is frustrated.  She's under a lot of pressure and as a modern woman, has taken on many roles: 1) Super Mom, 2) Career Woman, 3) Wifey of Duf Fer.  Personally, I think there is more pressure on the woman to be  perfect  at all Three.  Men can slack a bit on #1 or #3 and get away with it because "they're bringing home the bacon".  Of course, this is crap, but society (or the horrid media) dictates this.  (Another reason I still wish it were the 50s.)  So when Mrs. D says "things need to change around here"...you may think she's talking about the order of the house. (Men tend to take things more literally than women.) However, I think she just wants you to be aware that she's going to need your support.  Not just with the vacuuming or putting Tiny E to bed, but emotionally as well.  She needs to know you'll be around to pick up the slack.  Also, you traveling a lot probably makes the Mrs worried about things falling behind at home.  Talk to her and tell her what you told us in your post.  I'm sure she's more concerned with the cleanliness of your relationship than with the bathroom.  Convince her that you have her back...  But again, this is just my guess.

       Garbage & Small Shameless Plug   Friends in Christ and/or Pandylandaz,  Don't forget to take the garbage out.  Let me add to that.  Don't forget to take the garbage out, especially if you have a little 5-pound dog that shits on the floor as if he weighed 55 pounds.  You gotta love the little guy, but Nigel (the newest addition to the Shovelpants family) is a walking, barking feces factory.  Sure it's tough to hold it in when you're home alone for a good 9 hours or so.  But when I come home after a long day at the office, it never seems to fail.  There are at least 3 specially marked stinky Tootsie-Rolls waiting to be cleaned up.  On top of that, there's a couple strategically-placed puddles of piss to navigate as well.  Ah...the joys of puppyhood.  Where am I going with this?  Well, where we live the garbage men (and yes, I generalize because there aren't any garbage broads doing the job in our neighborhood) come and pick up our trash on Tuesdays.  This, of course, is where all the Nigel Nuggets and Pissy Papertowels go.  We make a point to keep all the garbage in the garage so that our townhouse smells like a spring garden...so all is good.  Unless you forget to take the garbage out.  Friends, I have 2 other adults living in my house with me.  One is the future Mrs. DJ Shovelpants, and the other is her brother.  All of us are capable of wheeling the little push cart out to the curb.  It's not tough.   Last week, however...it seems no one (including myself) could be bothered with it.  So the trash didn't get picked up last week.  That meant all of the little parcels of poop and pottied wipes had a good week to ferment in the humid garage.  Son of a bitch.  We even had a sign posted on the door going outside that read in TF Mrs. DJS's script:  'Hey!  What day of the week is it?  If it is Tuesday, please remember to take the garbage out!  Thank you!'   Can't.  Busy.  Flash forward to this morning, and guess who's standing (in business casual attire) inside the already-full garbage can, struggling to get five more bags to fit inside?  Correctamundo.  Me.  I was stomping that shit down, while my better half held the can so I didn't fall down and dash my stupid head apart.  Every jump launched more stink in her general direction and she looked like she was going to throw up.  Who could blame her?  She was getting blasted by horrible clouds of filth and poop.  Anyway...that's all I got.  Advice for Duf later today.   Shameless Plug:  I don't mean to whore out my little site, but would it kill y'all to toss me a haiku at  urlLink Discount Haiku ?  Would it?

       I Liked it Better When He Wasn't Posting at All, A Case Against the Lengthy Blog By Fer, Duf (a.k.a. "tiny")   Beloved Pandylandaz,  What a weekend.  Mrs. Duf and I went to see the play Chicago.  I liked it well enough but was not knocked out by it.  I like musicals (and I am secure enough in my femininity to say it – and secure enough in my masculinity to admit to a feminine side), but this one seemed overly weighted on songs and not enough on plot advancement and for some reason, it didn’t work.  Also, the dancers/chorus were on the stage the whole time (though off to the side and in the dark), and you could see them talking and stretching during other numbers – it seemed like they were not quite in it.  We had a great dinner with my in-laws at Kincaid’s afterwards – they call their Crème Brulee “Burnt Cream.”  Also, Mrs. Duf and I had a minor altercation this weekend.  The Mrs is in the running for a new job as the Head Gardener at a local conservatory and seems likely to get it (if she does, I will be so proud of her and so proud to be the husband of the person who holds that job).  On Saturday, she said “if I get that job, things are going to have to change around here.”  I said “what’s that supposed to me,” and she proceeded to talk to me about housekeeping and (increasing) the extent of my participation therein.    Now, a few thoughts: first, our house is fairly orderly.  Dishes don’t linger in the sink.  Nothing is dirty but sometimes things are not orderly.  Laundry can hang out a bit before being put away, and toys don’t always leap into the toy box at a steady fast rate, but when they do, they tend to leap back out. (it’s a toddler thing, you’ll understand).  My wife has four cats, and they keep our vacuum busy (I wonder sometimes why they ain’t bald they shed so damn much), and there is always a project or improvement task that could benefit from completion (the computer room is in chaos right now).  But for the most part our place is okay.  Okay, true confession time. We have a housekeeper who comes once a week to see after the bathroom, the vacuuming, the dusting the floors, the windows, etc.  In fact, I look forward to returning home tonight to that spring clean smell.    Now, before I share this next thought, let me say that I do not like comparative living.  It is a dangerous thing to want something that others have.  It is a sickness that is tough to cure.  And besides, no matter how much you have, there is always someone who appears to have more (even Bill Gates wants something that someone else has:  maybe he wants to own a sports team or have a wife who loves him for who he is, maybe he wishes he could sing or that his penis weren't so small).  Having said that, most of our friends who have little ones (not penises, children - although I am secure enough to tell you that I have a very, very small penis - it's like two inches when fully erect and no thicker than a cocktail straw, but I digress...most of our friends with children) don’t keep their house as orderly as we keep ours.  So, the implication being the statement “things are going to have to change around here” bugged me a bit.  I feel like we are doing okay, and that we could be much worse than we are, and Mrs. Duf is saying that (1) we are lousy and live in squalor.  Or, alternatively, she is saying that (2) if I pitched in more, it would be easier to maintain order. Or she is saying (3) she would be happier if married to a man of even average penis size, but let’s focus on my first theory:  Pandylandaz (there can only be five (although if Stoner came back, we would have six) don’t hate).  Can you help me articulate standards for cleanliness?  Thanks in advance,  MicroDuf  P.S.  Panda.  I won’t hate, I’ll congratulate, and if I was in Chi-town, I would facilitate.  Play on playa!

       May the Best Man Win   I'm sure some of you are wondering how the Lee Jeans extravaganza went this weekend.  It was great; in fact, we've already made plans to see each other again in August.  After having a beer per inning at Wrigley Field, seeing the fireworks at Navy Pier, enjoying a delicious steak dinner on the Smith & Wollensky patio, having cocktails at Danny's and hanging out at the Lake, it only seemed natural to do it all again sometime.  Here's the kicker...both OG and LJ want to be "the only one".  I went out with OG last night after I dropped LJ off at the airport, and he felt the need to profess this.  Now I'm in a pickle...I like both of them, one is local, one is in the city I want to move to...and I'm supposed to decide?  Sorry, boys.  Can't do it.

       Checking In.   Panda, in response to your (possibly rhetorical) question, no, that doesn’t happen to me.  Not only do I know everyone in my phone, but I also know their birth date and middle name.  You should call some of those dudes and give them my number.  Then we’ll be even.  I’m back from Dallas.  You know the highlight from Duf’s post below.  Aside from that fun (by the way, who knew that assassination + conspiracy x homelessness = hilarity?), yesterday morning I caught my flight out of Dallas at the godly hour of 9am (compared to Duf’s ungodly 6:30 departure).  Rather than lose sleep by going to the airport with Duf, I rode with another (sorta) coworker.  This was fine (we only got lost 1.5 times), except that this other person did not know the difference between U2 and Duran Duran, a truly horrid offense, and one that I thankfully do not need to get into here (all Pandylandaz know the difference, it’s a part of the test taken to join our ranks).  Once at the airport and minus the ignorant coworker, I immediately started to calculate ways that I can permanently avoid the Dallas airport in the future.  It’s dirty, confusing, crowded, inconvenient, outdated and slow.  Plus, you can only get there on American.  To quote another (sorta) colleague, “eewww”.  I was starving, so I searched for food.  When I say searched, I mean walked and walked and walked in one direction with my rolly bag and didn’t find anything.  Then I gave up and started walking and walking and walking in another direction with my rolly bag until I finally found a yogurt stand, a McDonalds and an Au Bon Pain surrounded by a hungry mob.  I figured my best bet was the Au Bon Pain.  I got in line and surveyed my options – a few crusty day old muffins and bagels, and an odd doughnut-esque item here and there.  I looked up at the menu and found half of it covered in “we’re out of this” or “we don’t sell that anymore” fashion.  When I got to the counter, I asked the gentleman working the register, “Do you have any flavored cream cheese?”  He then looked to his feet and responded “I wish! We only have the plain stuff”.  I immediately felt sorry for this dude who obviously has an inferiority complex over his store’s lack of strawberry cream cheese.  I got a muffin and retreated to my gate.  I hope another trip to “Big D” is not in my immediate future.

       Kevin Update   For those of you who don't know Kevin, he's my ex-boyfriend from a few years back.  Hal and I went camping with him last 4th of July (along with my ex-fiance, Billygoat) and he pulled a fricking glock out of his pants when we expressed some fear that a bear might ransack our camp.  "Don't worry...I have  this ."  Jesus H Christ, dude.  Well, he called me last night (seems he does that every 3-4 months or so) just to see what's up.  Of course, he had some crazy shit that's happened to him recently:  "I've been hospitalized twice in the past couple months.  Once for a huge shoulder injury from a serious car accident and another time for water intoxication."  Water intoxication??  What the hell is that?    "It's when you actually drink too much water and your body rids itself of all its electrolytes and completely cramps up."  Only Kevin.  And for those wondering, he's not marrying the Russian girl just so she can stay in the country.  How do I find these gems?  Oh yeah, he delivered me a pizza once in New Jersey.

       Does This Happen To You?   I was looking in the Phone Book in my cell phone today...just browsing through.  You would not believe how many names are in it of people who I have no idea who they are.  Most of them are guys names, which leads me to believe I got their names in bars at one time?  Or someone confiscated my phone and entered some phantom numbers?    It must be the latter.  I would never get someone's number who I had no recollection of (or desire to call).  That's not me.  Really.  Maybe you can help with a few examples: a Chris at 773-, a Mike at 315-, and a Sean at 347-.  I think the only Chicago area code is for Chris.  Who the hell are these people?

There are 2 fellas I'm a'courtin'. 1) Lee Jeans (Mpls), 2) OG (Chicago) (aka Orbitz Guy, aka guy I met at the Alumni wine tasting event who I initially was only talking to in order to get a new job...he's cute & funny, so I kept him.)   Item !  I will not be having "a lesbian phase" anytime soon.  Sorry, friend.   Item !  About 50 hours until Lee Jeans arrival into Midway Airport.  I'm picking him up there.  And there will be making out.  Hope the other clowns waiting at Midway like PDA.

       The First Stages of Alzheimer's or What Not to do When You're Out With One of the Two   I think this is all a little too much for me.  I can't keep the conversations I'm having with these guys straight.  Plus, they both have a brother and a sister, making it hard to keep track of the family details.  Last night, I asked OG about his sister's job at Accenture.  "Um, but my sister works at Deloitte & Touche."  Shit...wrong sister.  Then I was telling him about my trip to the dentist that day.  He said: "I absolutely HATE the dentist."  Me: "I know...you told me that before."  OG: "No, we never talked about dentists."  Shit...wrong guy again.  I either need to take notes when I'm talking to these dudes or I need to make flashcards.  Oi.

       This Just in Generalissimo Dufcisco Franco is NOT Dead or "Miss Hal, can you dig a little deeper?"  By Duf Fer  Long lost (but not forgotten) friends.  I am not dead.  I have been traveling too much, and I have not been down with the blog ups like I should be (gotta get down to get up - BB, can that be a song recommendation for you - put on some James Brown, honey - you can get bogged down in the sad stuff...put on something funky or something angry and draw your poisons to the surface then drink lots of water - all massage therapists advise it.  Which reminds me, spoil yourself too.  Get a facial and a massage and play a round golf at The Wilds in Shakopee).  Anyway, not much is on with me.  Hal and I are in Dallas for a meeting.  Yesterday I was in Tampa...tomorrow I will be in Columbus, Ohio.  It is too much.  I am finally starting to see that...it is too much.  Here is a story.  Last night, Hal and I went to Dealey Plaza to decipher this grassy knoll stuff.  Maybe all that is needed to unravel the Kennedy conspiracy are a fresh set of eyes and some Minnesota pragmatism.  Anyway, it was late-ish, around 9:30, and it was dark.  We were kind of walking around not really getting all the right stuff when this kind fellow (he called himself Miquel Bolton - and I did not get it until I got back to the hotel) came up and explained that we were pointing at the wrong grassy knoll (the place is thick with knolls and they are all grassy).    Well, we are in Texas, and the people are very friendly here (I know this because the 10 people I asked for directions (to the restaurant (Taco Diner in West Village, I recommend it for your next trip the Big D, but warning, no one knows where it is - ask for the West Village mall instead and directions to Dealey Plaza, and directions to our Hilton in Grapevine) were all way nice and...if they didn't know how to direct me, overly disappointed), and Miquel was no exception.  He showed us the window where Oswald ALLEGEDLY fired the shot (Miquel does not buy the lone gunman theory at all nor does he buy the magic bullet theory), he showed us the X that is embedded in Elm street to mark the spot where Kennedy was hit for the first time.  He showed us the manhole cover where the second shot threw his head back, and he showed us where the guy stood who fired shots from behind the what?  That's right,  the  grassy knoll.  He showed us the terrace they have erected in back of the grassy knoll, the memorial, the conspiracy museum.  He explained how the manhole shooter escaped, and how the knoll shooter fled.  He pointed out where Oswald was apprehended, where he was booked in, how he was transferred from one jail to another and the hallway where he was shot by Jack Ruby.  He showed us the austere memorial whose erection (I wrote erection...tee hee) was requested by Jackie O (I used erection and Jackie O in the same sentence...tee hee), and he read the plaque explaining how the citizens of Dallas paid for it (with contributions from others).  He even told us where he was (Waco, Texas) and what he was doing ("getting his play on"  yes, that's a quote - he was 4 at the time) when he heard about the assassination.  His grandfather cried and he recalled that as unusual.  He had never seen that before.  For those of you who have read this post believing that people are genuinely kind and that they offer help and tour guidance from an altruistic spirit of love for fellow man and to add another stone to the solid strong structure we call the community of [wo]man, you are right, just don't read the next paragraph.  Miquel walked us back to our car and explained that he was out of work and needed money to send his daughter to Six Flags tomorrow.  He was working us the whole time.  It gets worse.  Duf, as usual, was cashless.  Hal went into the car and into her purse to cough up a five-spot, and Miquel said (quoting again), "Miss Hal, can you dig a little deeper?"  BTW, I'm in favor of disclosing all fees up front.  Anyway, as we drove away, Hal, who has always been a bit too PC for my tastes.  Argued that men like Miquel, are a tragedy.  He was bright and personable and knowledgeable about the area.  He was articulate and his sales skills were keen.  He may have had a drinking problem.  I genuinely enjoyed the tour, even as I knew (fairly early on) there was a hook.  But Miquel is not employable, Hal pointed out - a blatant argument for helping the less fortunate - a view I spit on as a hardcore capitalist.  Why should I work to support people who can't just get a stinkin' job?  Explain that Miss PC Hal!

       Maybe it is a Cult   Bassy - like Hal said, K.O.T.  I suggest not listening to Indigo Girls or Tracy Chapman...that shit makes me cry like a baby for no reason.  You know how I told you guys that the holistic yoga thing was helping me cope with the stresses in my life?  Well, I think they are, indeed, part of a cult.  My yoga master has been bugging me to go to this one special healing chakra session with the guru of yoga - Grand Master Li...which happens to cost 200 bones and is on the weekend.  I've been telling him I can't make it, but after getting pressured more last night I told him I don't want to commit to a Saturday (my weekends are very important) or pay the cash.  Then he told me I needed to come for a preparation class on Tuesday night (tonight) and I said I had plans.  The guy wouldn't let me off that easy.  "What are you doing?"  So I finally just told him the truth: "I have a date."  "Can you reschedule?"  "Um, no."  No one is going to tell me to screw up my social life...not even some little, meek, Korean guy.  Sorry, chief.

       The DJS Movie Review Corner   'Allo friends.  I've been on a tear seeing at least one movie a week for the last month or so.  Pretty amazing, eh?  We think so.  Without further delay, let me get right into the shit and give you the low-down on what's what in the cinema.   Finding Nemo  - Saw this a couple weeks ago and was really excited to see it.  However, I was somewhat sick.  I think I was low on iron or something.  As such, I got really tired and and nodded off during parts of the movie.  Days like this made me wish I still drank caffeine, you know?  I could've really used a shot in the arm.  Anyway, the movie was okay.  Not my favorite Pixar effort, but decent.  I still think Monster's Inc. was the best one.  Argue with me if you want.  I win.   Rating:  7/10   Should've Been Called:  Finding Monster's Inc. More Interesting Than Nemo   The Hulk  - I really didn't want to see this until I saw some kind of special on cable about how they did the effects and stuff.  Then, I HAD to see it.  Am I glad I did?  Sure.  Before I hit the theatre, Dirty and I ate a burrito.  It was delicious.  Packed with tender morsels of chicken and the hot sauce was on par.  I washed it down with some refreshing water and I considered myself full.  Off to the show.  The movie was actually suprisingly good.  I expected shit, but it turned out to be a pretty smart flick.  I don't know that kids will like it much as there's a lot of set-up and the green son of a bitch doesn't show up until almost an hour into the flick.  The ending was a little weird for me.  I mean, what the hell is with Nicky Nolte anyway?  The Hulk's dad turned into some big ghost thing and I just didn't get it.  Worth seeing, though.   Rating:  7/10   Should've Been Called:  Rar! Kids No Like Hulk!!!   Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines  - Another movie I didn't want to see, but ended up checking it out anyway.  I'd heard that the ending was totally unconventional and that it was crazy with action.  Sounded right up my alley, so I decided that after I put in a shift at my part-time bookstore gig, I'd see the midnight show.  I didn't have anyone to see it with, so I decided to be a complete loser and go by myself.  No really, it's okay.  I only cried a little on the way there.  At the theatre, there were so many Asian kids there, I thought I'd mistakenly walked into 2 Fast 2 Furious.  You know...because they like to trick out their Hondas and such.  Anyway, the movie was mediocre at best.  Yeah there was lots of action, but I didn't care for the character development...was there any?  The chick Terminator, the TX was lame.  She didn't seem like much of a threat.  I did learn one thing though: Claire Danes is not an attractive girl.  She looked like ass.  I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not raving or running out to see T3 again.  Oh...and the title mentioned 'Rise of the Machines.'  I saw plenty of machines.  None of them rose.  Hope that didn't ruin anything for you.   Rating:  6/10   Should've Been Called:  T3: Where's James Cameron?   Bruce Almighty  - I know this one is a little older, but I finally got around to seeing it.  The verdict?  It was a piece of shit.  Good idea gone terribly wrong.  Jimmy Carrey is funny in moments and other times I was like: Dude...you're trying too hard.  I don't know.  Then, they had to ruin an already crappy not-funny movie by slapping you on the ass with a moral.  Save it, friend.  I didn't buy a ticket to have someone teach me what's right.  Fuck you.   Rating  3/10   Should've Been Called:  Bruce All-Shitty

      What's with guys having to mark their territory when they're with you in a bar?  This happens to me quite frequently.  I'll be either talking to a guy I just met, or maybe I'm on a date with someone who's not technically "my boyfriend"...and then another guy might come over to talk to me.  All of a sudden Guy #1 has his hands all over me - maybe his arm is around me, or he grabs my hand, or starts stroking my hair.  Like this is some sort of "sign" for Guy #2 to back off?  Dude, why don't you just pee on my leg like a dog?  Geez.

       Let the Juggling Begin   I may have mentioned someone in an earlier post  - Orbitz Guy.  OG called me yesterday and after talking on the phone for almost 45 minutes and asking me out for Tuesday night, I suggested we just meet for a drink in an hour. (I hate to talk on the phone when you can just get together in person.) And why do I always think it's only going to be  one  drink?  Big Surprise: It ended up being several.  But we ended up having a good time.  He was pretty cool and downright hilarious.  I excused myself at one of the bars we were at (yes, there were several of those too) to go to the ladies'.  While I was in the john, I checked my messages...one came through from Lee Jeans.  "Call me tonight..."  So I called him quick to touch base ("I'll call you tomorrow to chat...I'm out with my friends.") and went back to OG.  "Gee you took a long time in there...what's up?"  "I had to call one of my friends."  Then later last evening he told me how he really "felt a connection with me" and he could tell I was feeling it too.  (So now he's psychic?)   I'm way too old for this Three's-Company-type-hijinks.  It's already stressing me out.  Let's just hope I don't run into OG when I'm at the Cubs game with Lee Jeans this Saturday.  Then I'd really have some 'splainin' to do.

       Because It Feels Like Friday 5    1. How are you planning to spend the summer?  I'm trying to hit every outdoor-seating bar I can this summer.  I'm also attempting to find a new job (not quite as fun or exciting).  [Closed Circuit to the Pandyland crew: I'm looking for a job in Mpls again...cross your fingers.] I will also be moving into a new place in August (if I don't move to Mpls first!).      2. What was your first summer job?  I had a paper route...this lasted about 4 months because I somehow suckered my parents into helping me with it, which completely pissed them off.  If I had to think of my favorite summer job, it was working at the local movie theater. (Popcorn Girl.) I got to see any movie in the city for free, so one summer I saw EVERY SINGLE MOVIE that came out - good or bad.  This also made me very comfortable with going to movies by myself.     3. If you could go anywhere this summer, where would you go?  Like I've said many times before, Iceland.  Or Australia (since it's winter there right now, the weather is mild).  But I can definitely feel another Mpls trip coming....destination: Country Bar.   4. What was your worst vacation ever?  When I was little, my entire family (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) and I would go to Florida for Easter Break.  One year I got so sunburnt I blistered all over...it was pretty gross.  The worst and most painful vacation ever.  Now that I'm older, I can't remember any bad vacations.  I guess I've had good luck (plus, I plan things meticulously so nothing can go wrong...Billygoat on the other hand...don't get me started.)   5. What was your best vacation ever?  I don't know if this was the absolute best, but I had an awesome time when I was with my parents, bro, and sis-in-law in London and Brussels last Thanksgiving.  We got drunk together, laughed a ton, and saw everything we could in 2 fantastic cities.  Plus, I didn't have to pay.  I think the best vacations are free.

       Sometimes I think...Why Me?   But then I realize it's just so I can post something interesting here...  This morning, I got stuck with 2 other people in one of the elevators in my building.  After waiting for 15 minutes, we realized we were stuck between floors.  Finally, a policeman helped us crawl out "Keanu-Speed-Style".  I guess I'll never say the Chicago Police are useless again.  Plus, I had a pretty good excuse as to why I was late to work.  I doubt my boss bought it, though.

       I Love Me Some Liz   Okay, I have to admit by about 3:30pm yesterday afternoon, I thought about blowing off the Liz Phair concert.  It was one of those days here at work, a handful of people bailed on going to the concert (ahem) and I just wasn't in the mood, ya know?  Christ, I'm glad I went.  We met up at The Refuge in Minnecrapolis (HAL, Dr. Rob Phd, and BS Reid) and strolled in about 20 minutes before she hit the stage.  Opening act?  No time.  She started promptly at 8:15pm and rocked the proverbial pants off of everyone there.  Contrary to popular belief, she only did like 3-4 songs from her much loathed new album.  The rest?  Sprinklings of 'Exile In Guyville' an occasional track off of 'Whip Smart' and a few from 'whitechocolatespaceegg' including one of my all-time favorite Liz songs 'Perfect World.'   I want to be cool, tall, vulnerable and luscious...   I don't know.  Say what you will about the 'new' Liz and her 'sell-out' album, but she's still got it in my opinion.  She may be trying to move in a new direction, but she definitely hasn't forgotten what's gotten her this far.  Oh...did I mention that she's friggin' hot?  Wow.

       Love Letters   I thought the art of writing a good love letter had fallen to the wayside long ago, until I received the sweetest letter ever from Lee Jeans yesterday.  He ended it with "I guess I have a little bit of a romantic twist...a good cowboy always does."  (For those keeping score, LJ rides horses and participates in competitions back home in So Dak.  You should see him in his cowboy hat and shit-kickers.  Oo-la-la.)  "Warning Sign" by Coldplay just came up on my CD player.  It couldn't be more timely.  So, to all you fellas out there: write your woman a thoughtful letter already.  Sometimes small gestures like that have big paybacks, if you know what I'm sayin'.

       Hot in the City  By Duf Fer  We have had a pretty rough run in "The Paul" lately.  The week before vacation, a suspected car thief was arrested in our back yard and trashed Mrs. Duf's garden while cursing and waking up TinyDuf at 3 a.m.  Five officers were involved in the hunt, and none of them can distinguish echinacea from weeds.    The next day, the suspected car thief's girlfriend came to our house (our address is a matter of public record) looking for "keys" that her boyfriend "dropped" in our yard while hiding out from the police officers (before being found by a bad ass police dog).  The police came by soon after her and said that his keys were included among the items they checked into holding when he was taken to jail.  Their theory:  he dropped drugs in our yard.  I was out of town during the whole affair.  While we were on vacation, our credit card company called and told us that they suspected fraud on our account. Some sucka was charging up a storm (including an $1100 Texaco charge) on our card.  Last night, someone broke into our garage.  All three of our bikes were stolen (including the one I bought Mrs. Duf for Mother's Day this year - it's been ridden twice), our garage people door was damaged severely, and my wife's car stereo was stolen (DJS, I like the way you gave the gift to DJ LZ, and perhaps I will do that too someday to replace her stolen stereo (JK)).    While on vacation, we cleaned out our garage, and among the items we threw away...her old car stereo!  My response to all of this misadventure is almost as upsetting to me as the events themselves. I:  1.  Want to move to a better neighborhood; 2.  Have been spinning theories about who stole our credit card and who broke into our garage, and it is someone I know; 3.  Have been feeling guilty about traveling so much because I have these testosterone driven (and illogical) notions that if I were home, Mrs. Duf would be safer.   4.  Have been thinking about getting a home security system; and  5.  Have been re-examining the propriety of traveling so much and questioning the balance between providing for my family in a job I love (making a good living) and being home more often (even if it means that I earn less money).  This balancing act is a near constant struggle for me.    But mostly I have been thinking about being a better provider and buying a house in a better place so that when I am gone, everyone will be safer.  Our current plan for moving is a 3 year plan.  This will allow us to make home improvements, and it will allow us to be better positioned to buy a house that we can live in for a lenthy (nod to DJS) amount of time (we will save, increase income and decrease expenses (bye bye daycare ($1000 per month), hello public schools ($0 per month)).  But with all these happenings, I wonder if we should not scramble and stretch and just get the hell out of our part of the city now.  No answer seems correct.

       I'm With DJS   I've had a bit of the blogging blues lately, too.  It's not like nothing interesting has been going on, I just have been feeling a little under the weather emotionally.  That's kind of weird for me because I'm usually cheery, cheery, cheery, but after rejection 378 on the job front, one can get a little down in the dumps.  So what's the best remedy for that?  Sitting in a dark theater, with smuggled-in Whoppers (delicious), watching the latest indie flick.  That and catching some interesting films on free cable.  Let me recap:   urlLink Dirty Pretty Things : A very touching and intense movie that does not have a dull moment. It's encouraging to see a movie that ends with people of values prevailing.  This movie brought to light the extent people will go to for freedom and a better life - and how you and I take all these things for granted.  Plus, how can you NOT love Audrey Tatou (of Amelie fame)?   urlLink Step into Liquid : As the tagline says - "No special effects. No stuntmen. No stereotypes. No other feeling comes close."  I've never surfed in my life, but after seeing this movie, I definitely want to try it at least once.  And who woulda thunk there actually was surfing off the coast of Lake Michigan in little ol' Sheboygan, WI?   urlLink The Swimming Pool : I saw this movie last night and didn't figure out what really happened until about 5 minutes ago.  Now I want to go out and see it again to catch all the nuances.  Very good, but seems pretentious at first (maybe because it's filmed in France?).   urlLink The Karate Kid : I caught this on ESPN Classic, of all stations.  I swear I hadn't seen this since 1984, so it was a true blast from the past.  (Side note: The first time I saw it I was amongst an all-African American audience in a movie theater in Madison, WI - which was great because everyone was yelling at the screen during the karate tournament scene.)  Little Ralphy Macchio seemed so hunky back then; now he just looks like a total dweeb in a red, plastic jacket.  And seeing him with Elizabeth Shue?  She seemed about 10 times bigger than him - what a weird looking couple.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it very much, even though I was mocking it the whole time.  The ending anthem during the final fight destroyed me: "You're the BEST, around...nothing is going to ever keep you down!"  Wax on, wax off.   urlLink Van Wilder : I was pretty sceptical about this one when it came on Showtime, but it's a bit of a gem.  Ryan Renold's (Van) comic delivery reminds me of Will Ferrell at his best.  I would call this film a very carass  Animal House  (if that's possible?).  Both the eclair scene and Tara Reid's performance made me gag, but as a whole it was entertaining.  If you want dumb humor, this will deliver.

       Yep.  I Suck.   Hiya P'landers.  My name is DJ Shovelpants.  I used to post on this-here site quite a bit.  Remember me?  Of course, I've had plenty to blog about as of late, but I've got the blogger blahs these days.  Why?  Don't know.  Maybe it's just a simple case of can't...busy...  Though I don't think this post will be lenthy (I intentionally left the 'g' out in the word lengthy.  Please pronounce accordingly) I'll try to keep y'all up to date with what's new.  - Today is DJ LZ's birthday.  She's a whopping 27 years old today, almost four years my junior.  Yeah!  For her birthday, I snuck her bare-bones Saturn SL (with no power windows, locks, steering, etc) in to have a CD player installed.  I had to be all covert about it because we work together and we usually drive in together and it's always in the truck.  I played sick this morning, she drove the truck in and I came in an hour later with the Saturn.  I dropped off the car and made a ransom note that said 'LOOK IN YOUR CAR' and cut it into pieces, dropped it in a box and wrapped it all nice.  I set wrapped box on her seat whilst she was at a lunch meeting.  Hopefully she'll like it.  - Today also marks the day that my little dog Nigel will lose his manhood.  That's right, friends...I'm talking about his ball bag.  It's going bye-bye.  The vet called and said that the operation was successful and that the little guy is just fine.  We get to pick him up tomorrow.  Poor little son of a bitch.  - The Bjork concert - In a handful of words: It was a goddamn religious experience.  I'm not even kidding.  Not only was the whole trip itself enjoyable as all get-out, it was capped off with the absolute best concert I will ever see in my life.  Hands down.  Red Rocks is the coolest venue of all time and the whole event totally made my whole year.  Nothing will come close to this in my book.  I bought a poster from the show and I'm going to do it up with my ticket, some pictures and I'll have a commemorative wall-hanging for the rest of eternity.  It was well worth the drive through So-Dak, Neb, and Wyo.  Good times, good times.  - 2 teachers (one in Stillwater & another in Austin Texas) are going to read my kids book to their 3rd grade class.  I'll get e-mailed reactions and comments from little kids in a couple of months.  I'm also just about finished with my 2nd book, so those who've read the 1st installment and is jonesin' for more will be able to check it out.  (shameless plug)  That's all that's going on with me these days.  Sorry I've been a slacker.  Like I said...it's been the blahs for me, blogger-wise.  Ciao for now, crazies.  - DJS

       Must be the stress   I have a lot going on this week.  First off, today is my last day at work until the Tuesday following Labor Day.  That great, but there are loose ends to tie before I leave today.  And once I do leave today, I have to rush downtown to cook for 150 homeless men.  I'll get home about 9:30 tonight, and then tomorrow morning I close on my condo (a big woo-hoo!), before which I need to get a cashier's check, if they ever get my final figures figured out.  Then I move, move, move, until I'm back at work next week.  So it's a little chaotic for me, though I realize that it's good chaos.  Anyway... I'm not a great multi-tasker.  This may surprise those who've seen me read a book while my stereo is on, with my T.V. muted.  But I just can't keep too many balls in the air - another reason why I've never tried juggling.  Anyway, I thought I was doing alright until I stopped in the ladies room this afternoon.  I looked at my face in the mirror and realized that I looked pretty washed out.  Then it dawned on me - I totally forgot to put on a trace of makeup this morning.  Somehow I woke up, showered, dressed, dried my hair, and did everything else normally, including putting on earrings, but I skipped the makeup step.  I've never left my home without makeup before in my life, unless it was on purpose, or I was under 15.  Weird.

       It's Kind of Sad   The Pandylandaz missed our one year anniversary.  It was on August 16th.  Now here we are, going days without posting.  It's all kind of sad.  Whatever.  I'm so very tired today.  My coworkers have a terrible influence on me.  We went out for margaritas last night after work and then I met up with Robert at a sushi joint and did sake bombers.  After using alcohol to gain an inordinate amount of confidence, we hustled a couple jerks in pool at an Irish bar down the street.  We won one of our games because I intentionally leaned over the table in a seductive manner, making our opponent crack and hit the 8 ball in.  Men are so easy.

Then he sends me this [long e-mail] and doesn’t even address what he will/will not do with the feedback he requested!!!!!  What is his deal lately????   The only problem:  S/he sent it to me instead.  Oopsie!  My instant reaction was to send it to his/her boss (and make a case for getting him/her reassigned from the project, but I counted to ten and chose to take the high road (talking with him/her about it) instead.

       Hoo boy...    Panda  - That's cool.  Not the best picture from our performance, but it'll do...it'll do.  Let me just say that we went to a lot of trouble just to get 2nd place.  We had to make those shirts and the choreography?  Forgetaboutit...   In other news...   I've been offered the job of on-call Firefighter/EMT.  That's right.  Just like I mentioned in my haiku some months back, I'm going to be a fucking hero.  The problem is, I'm going through the 'tests' right now and let me tell you friends, I'm not liking it.   Test #1 - Piss in a cup.  This one I can handle.  Contrary to popular belief, I've never taken a single illegal drug in my life.  Yes, friends.  That also includes smoking 'the pot.'  Never have, never will.  Does that make me square?  Fuck you.   Test # 2 - The Physical  Boy, was this one a real bastard and clocked in at over 2 hours long.  Not just the usual 'turn your head and cough' that male physicals are used to be.  I found out that I weigh 10 pounds more than I thought, my blood pressure is high (a connection?), and that sitting in a gown in the check-up room for 45 minutes can be a very humbling experience.  I also managed to offend the nurse.  She asked if I would mind if she drew blood from a certain vein.  I said 'Hey, you're the doctor or...assistant' as my voice trailed off.  She said, 'Actually, I'm a nurse.'  Yeah?  Well, you've got stanky breath and you could use a shave, nursey.  Yee-ha!   Test # 3 - Head Test  This doesn't happen until I get back from Colorado.  Wait...let me rephrase that.  The day I've set aside for recovering from the roadtrip, I'll be spending 5 (count 'em) FIVE hours taking a psychological profile.  Then, I'll have some head doctor talk to me for an hour at the end.  Jesus Christ!  This is what I'm doing with my day off???  Anyway, not to pat myself on the back, but out of 50+ people that applied for the gig, I'm one of 9 that made it.  That's kind of cool, methinks.  Now, if I could just find out when they hand out the axes...

       Another Week Begins   What's up, sluts?  I went to the Tori Amos/Ben Folds show last night.  I was pretty pumped about it and was anxious to get there on time since Ben was the opener.  My friends who were with me don't get as riled up about music (strike that, I mean spaz out) like I do, so they were taking their sweet time at the bar we went to beforehand.  Needless to say, we got there 5 minutes after his set started.  It was dark, so we couldn't really see which box seats we had, so we just sat down in the first ones we saw.  Ben was awesome - he rocked the house with "Rockin' the Suburbs" and even got the entire Auditorium Theater to sing 3-part harmony.  Right after Tori came on we got flashlights in the eyes and were told we were in the wrong seats.  Our real seats?  Still box, but several rows back...behind some ass clowns who stood up during the entire show.  Now, as a preface to my upcoming rant, I'm all about having a good time at a rock show.  Hey, stand up, scream, sing along, jump up and down, I could care less...but at  Tori Amos ??  Sit down and shut up.  This one jag-off was dancing with his arms flailing all around. (How he was doing this to "Pass the Mission", I could not tell you.)  At one point, he was freaking out so much that his chair toppled over and caused a huge disturbance.  Not only was he in my way, but it was also hard to listen to the music since he was such a distraction.  He also started talking (in full voice) to the friends he was with which made a girl in front of us totally lose it - she finally turned around and yelled at him to "Shut the fuck up!  Everyone here is so annoyed with you!"  (I kid you not.)  On the other side of us was a girl who sang every lyric to every song.  Um, honey, after singing (as loud as you can) with Tori during "Crucify" we  get  that you're the biggest fan ever.  I didn't pay 60 bones to hear Tori sing a duet with you.  Thanks.  The only respite from this was when Tori covered Don McLean's "Vincent".  Absolutely gorgeous.  (As BB can attest to, this song is a guilty pleasure of mine.  Cheesy, I know, but I love it.  And her version was spectacular.)  Thank God the "lyric girl" didn't know this one.  It was the one time I could actually hear Tori sing.  In other news: Lee Jeans is coming back to Chicago this weekend for Round Two.  My bro and sis-in-law are coming on Saturday too, and they insisted on staying at a hotel that night even though I have plenty of room in my new place.  According to my bro, him and his wife "don't want to intrude on a girl in heat."  Dude, gross, you're my brother.  He'll be staying at a hotel called the Willows (Duf may remember staying there once).  This got him pretty excited since he said he could exclaim at bartime (he told me this over e-mail): "listen up ladies!!.....this party will continue to be off the hook at the Willowz!!!....there will be crystal in the fridge and suds in the tubs....only at the Willowz!!!"    I guess you have to know him and his off-the-wall sense of humor to get that.  Sometimes I worry about my brother's sanity.  He always makes for a good story, though.  Let's hope he doesn't break out the Elvis glasses again.  My sis-in-law then sent me a few links soon after...First watch  urlLink this , then go  urlLink here  .  Those 2 are two peas in a pod.

       I've Surpressed Political Blogs for a Long Time, but I Can't Remain Silent on This One  By Duf Fer  California.  What the hell are you doing out there?  Last November, Gray Davis is re-elected.  In January, he begins his second term.  In April (or so) multi-millionaire Congressman Darrrell Issa begins a drive to recall him.  In July, it succeeds.  In October, Davis will face a recall election.  In other words, for no malfeasance whatsoever, a sitting Governor may be ousted less than one year after he was re-elected.  The cost to California taxpayers?  $70,000,000.  Nice (if only it could happen in MN)!  Why recall Davis?  Well, he supposedly misled voters about the size of the budget deficit.  Yep.  That has never happened before, and not only should Davis be recalled, but he should get the same punishment as all those Enron felons (what?  They haven’t been punished yet?  Oh.).  At last count, there are almost 200 candidates on the ballot.  The early favorite:  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Now, I have to give Arnold props.  He has been politically active, and is not running without any experience at all.  He is a Republican, but he is married to a Democrat, so that makes him relatively trustworthy.  I think he would make a fine governor; I don't want to use this blog to put down Arnold.    But I do want to say that what ails California is not going to be solved by selecting a new Governor.  California is either the most populous state or very nearly the most populous state.  They had a thriving (even if overvalued) dot.com based economy that came crashing back to earth along with the Nasdaq.  Silicon Valley is a shadow of its former self as the tech boom has settled a bit and other parts of the country have become technology headquarters too (see, e.g. Boston, Austin and Fargo).    Homeland security obligations and a weak national economy, factors that have sent almost every state into budgetary chaos, are particularly acute in California because it is so big (both in terms of geographical reach and in terms of population).  California has a number of potential terrorism targets to defend (including a large number of hospitals that require overhauling to meet potential chemical and biological threats).    California was creamed by energy deregulation and by crooked energy execs and perhaps it can be said that Davis could have handled all that better.  However, given a chance to oust him in November, voters declined to do so.  Add to all that the fact that diminished Federal support to states (which allows us to fund the war against Iraq to the tune of $4,000,000,000 per month) particularly harms California.  Also, in California, as in most states, the Governor is only as good as the legislation that reaches his desk.  One could argue that Gray Davis should have been a more effective leader in the legislature, but let me make this one bet:  whoever takes over will not resolve the budget crisis in California.  The crisis is bigger than one person and requires resolution of issues outside of California.  In my view, states run just like households:  in order to decrease debt, you need to do one of three things:  1.  decrease spending, 2.  increase income, or  3.  both  Oh, one other thing, the second option has to be done without increasing taxes.  So, short of more financial support from the federal government, the only realistic options are all political suicide (what politician in his right mind is going to increase taxes today?  A politician can only cut spending so far, before he gets blamed for every problem from bad roads to poor schools to increased crime.  A governor needs a legislature to do anything anyway).    The only justice to come out of the whole scenario is that Darrell Issa, the gentleman who funded the whole thing so that he could take over when Davis was recalled, had to end his candidacy when Arnold threw his hat into the (overcrowded) ring.  [BTW:  Issa made his fortune selling car alarms, so if you need another reason to question his judgment, there it is.]  Issa spent a couple million financing a fiasco for his own personal gain, only to leave chaos behind and force himself to make a tearful speech about how he wasn't going to be able to reap the benefits of his self-motivated effort to place his will over the will of the voters.     The only question that remains to be answered is:  who will reap the benefits?  Not California, and not any state that follows its lead by allowing partisan politics to usurp the democrat process.  Californians, you elected a Governor less than a year ago.  You have a legislature.  You have a voice.  Use them.  Don’t recall Governor Davis.

      Duf, we seem to be on the same wavelength this week (or maybe just notice the same pop culture phenomenons).  I watched 2 episodes of that show last night and was completely delighted (I am delighted for 2 reasons: 1) because I even  could  watch it - I've never had cable, and in my new place I tapped into the line and am getting it free - shhhh! don't tell Comcast.  2) Watching these gay men make the straight guys really uncomfortable makes for some good comedy.)   Not only do they help these guys with a make-over, but it seems they help them plan something nice for their significant other.  For one, it was a marriage proposal.  For another, it was learning to sing a song he wrote for his wife.    I hope more straight men catch on and watch this show.  So many guys out there need this kind of help, and I'm convinced these kind of positive changes will lead to world peace.  Duf, you are definitely not alone.

       Anita Gaye  By Duf Fer  Apparently there is a new show on television's Bravo network where five gay gentlemens will do a life makeover for a straight gentleman.  It's called "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."  I think I need to be on this show.    First of all, I have been wearing essentially the same kinds of clothes since 1980 when I started to pick my own outfits. It is almost impossible to see me in something other than a polo style shirt and Docker's style pants (standard brown shoes by Vegetarian Shoes of London, thanks).  I bought new glasses and was horrified by what I perceived as a radical eyewear departure, but only one person at work has noticed (props to HAL).  In other words, my radical departure was not a departure at all.  Second, my eye for interior decorating is not only color blind, it is blind, blind.  So I could benefit from some fabulous direction as well.    Third, when I go to a restaurant, I usually eat the same thing.  In part this is because most places have 3 or 4 vegetarian choices, but it is also linked to my (mild) epicurean conservatism.  I know enough not to embarass myself at a business dinner, but I could also use some culinary refinements (ex:  we were at Savories in Stillwater last weekend, and when they brought out the figs with candied almonds and creamed gorgonzola as a pre-meal palate exciter, not only did I think it was tiny limes with whipped cream, but I didn't know if I should eat the entire fig or what...HELP!)  Last, the only time I have ever changed my hairstyle was in college.  I had a high top fade for a semester or two (and compared to Kid-n-Play it was more of a mid top fade), but other than that, I have sported to same doo since conception.    I went to the  urlLink show's web site , but to sign up for a makeover, you have to live in the New York area.  Drats!

      BB, If I was in Minneapolis right now, I would personally bring shots over to your work place.  And it sounds like the woman you work with could use a few as well.  Either that, or a sharp, quick bitch-slap to the head.   I HATE PHONE COMPANIES.   Turns out, after much screaming and crying on the phone to these people, I'm still not going to have a dial tone (let alone, high-speed internet) for another week.  Dicks.

      Shortly after I wrote my post, my friend Petey called and is going to make me dinner this evening since I haven't seen him in ages. HAL, I believe we're still on tomorrow night and I would like to partake of said drunkenness with you at that time. Open invite to Duf and DJS too! Let's discuss here tomorrow.  Ciao. and thanks for listening to all my crap. -BB

      BB - you don't have to ask me twice.  I'm in.  Beer, wine, and amaretto (sorry -  we're not much for Hard A) are flowing freely post-working hours at my apartment.  Just keep in mind, I have been swallowed whole by a new obesession -  urlLink 24 .  Blame DJS... he loaned me the DVD (all... twen-ty... four... hours) and my non-work hours have been devoted to viewing it.

       Last resort...   I can't remember when I've been in this bad of foul mood. Everything is irritating me today. I can't stand my job - one coworker in particular - and I haven't slept peacefully in over a month.  I think I will bitch about her here. She's the kind of person who gets caught up in details that she can't see anything else. She also insists on asking you about every said detail because she a) wants to seem like she includes everyone and b) isn't confident enough to make a decision. I can appreciate being included in the decision-making process if that does factor at all in her intentions, but C'MON...I can't tell you how it annoys the shit out of me to be bombarded with 8 questions about something that hasn't even been discussed in any detail with the client and she's asking these questions because she's not confident in being able to meet the client's expectations and she thinks they will leave us. She has no foresight to capture the essence of what the client wants if she can't include every component the client mentions in a brain-storm session. She does this with EVERY client and no client has left our company for this reason. She has no big picture skills or perception that this is a FUCKING WEB SITE. We are not saving lives, helping the poor, feeding the homeless, or even adding to the intelligence of the population. We're shlocking products to consumers. That's it. It's absolutely maddening and given my mentioned foul-ass mood, I've actually thought about picking up my computer and tossing it at her.   I've got a hankerin to get drunk right now. Any joiners?

       I’ve been to heaven, hell, and back again…   Greetings, Pandyland.  I know, it’s been awhile.  I missed you too.  Duf’s right.  I’m a changed woman.  While walking through the U2 exhibit I thought to myself (swear to God), “this is what heaven must be like”.  The only difference is in the real heaven, security guards probably don’t ask me to remove my tongue from the display case.  The only real downside was the other people at the exhibit.  There is an area dedicated to U2 fans (zines, etc.) and you can sign a guest book, if you so desire (Desire, get it??  Like the song?).  A woman (inexplicably, in her twenties) yelled, “Mom, you have to read what people wrote!  This stuff is hilarious!!  ‘Bono [she pronounced like Cher’s husband’s name], I love you, will you marry me?’  That’s nuts!”.  Shut up lady, it came from my heart!  If the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday was heaven, O’Hare airport on Sunday was hell (I had to fly though there from Cleveland).  Apparently, when scattered showers hit Chicago, all remaining humanity and kindness goes out the window, and chaos reigns.  After being put on two flights that were subsequently cancelled, I was given a standby ticket for the last flight to Minneapolis that night.  As a consolation, or additional kick in the ass, depending on you outlook, I was “guaranteed” a seat on a flight leaving Monday afternoon and given a “discount” coupon for a hotel.  When I asked where I could get my bag for my impending unplanned for overnight in Chicago, the gate agent finally looked up at me, laughed, and muttered “good luck”.  I mercifully landed a seat on that last flight, (leaving at 11pm) and got the hell out of hell.  The cherry on top was the earache the flight gave me to remember it by.  But as I finally got to my bed at 2am, I could not have cared less – I was home!!  Anyway... I'm never leaving Minnepolis again.  It was a nice run.

       HAL has that glow about her...  By Duf Fer  Pandylandaz (don't hate) and devoted readers,  Hal is back in the office and she has that special glow about her.  Sure, she may be pregnant (there is no trick to getting her pants off, NO TRICK!), but really I think it has something to do with the everlasting high of going to Cleveland and seeing the U2 exhibit at the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame (where visitors are advised to use their AAA discount - it's spendy).  Alternatively, it could be a Burt Reynolds thing.  Yours,   Duf

       Comics   I'm addicted to  urlLink this guy's  web comic.  I don't remember how I stumbled on it, but I read the first one, then went immediately to the archives to read all of his other strips.  I swear, if I could draw half as well as he does, I'd 86 this blogging thang and do a web comic/journal-type thing.  Genius.

       Flavored Pop and Friday 5   Duf, it's funny you mentioned that brand of soda pop.  I moved last Thursday, and hired 3 large AfAms to help me out.  Because it was a hot day, I asked them what I could get them to drink.  I offered them my good imported beer, but they insisted on something else: Tropical Sprite Remix.  They love(d) the stuff.  To them, it was delicious.  Duf, you must have more sophisticated tastes.  All and all the move went well (other than the fact that they sent the elevator down with ALL OF MY SHIT - no one went down with it, some a-hole on the 4th floor called the elevator, and my stuff all fell out - but only a few things broke).  I can't wait to be in Minneapolis, but I'm not looking forward to moving again.  Oy.  Now, on to the business...   1. What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?   I try to aim for 7am, but usually don't get my ass out of bed until 7:30-7:45.  It's pretty nice working for a NYC-based company, cuz the hours are 9-5.  I usually roll in about 9:15am.   2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?   It's hard for me to sleep past 8am, unless I was drinking heavily the night before.  Visiting Lee Jeans makes sleeping in virtually impossible.  He gets up at 5:30am during the week and is a real go-getter on weekends too - he insists on getting up, getting coffee, and reading the paper by 7am.  What the hell?  Needless to say, I can barely keep my eyes open right now.   3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?   Turn on music that makes me smile, turn on my computer to check my e-mail, and/or listen to NPR for the weather and quick news report.   4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?  On the weekends I can get out in 10 minutes if I don't shower.  During the week, I can take up to an hour if I take my sweet time.     5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?  The Bagel on Broadway - it's just down the street from me and is the best Jewish deli in town.  No matter what time of the day, they put pickles and challah bread on your table.  Nothing like pickles and coffee to cure a hangover on a Saturday morning.

       What's the Story Morning DJS?    1. What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?   Usually around 6:30am.  It all depends if DJ LZ (who gets up earlier than me) brings Nigel upstairs and tosses him on the bed.  If he scampers around and pounces on my face (which he did this morning, the son of a bitch) its quite a bit earlier.   2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?   I don't tend to sleep in on the weekends.  I'm one of those people that think no one needs more than 5 to 6 hours of sleep a night.  I stay up late and get up early.  But, if I were to sleep in late, it's generally not any later than 8:00am or so.  I'm going to sound like a macho Navy-SEAL dick here, but: You can sleep when you're dead.   3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?   Groan, piss, moan.   4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?   Usually, if I need to do the full-meal deal (shit, shower, shave) it'll take me a little longer.  On a typical day, I'm out the door in about 20 minutes or so.  That is, of course, if I don't dilly-dally.  Me?  No...    5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?   I'd say Jamba Juice if there was one on the way to work.  Typically, I don't stop for breakfast.  I know it's the most important meal of the day (blah, blah, blah) but I usually don't have the time.  I am a big fan of McDonald's breakfast, though.  Dee-licious.

       Not Such a Bad Friday Five  By Duf Fer   1. What time do you wake up on weekday mornings?  It really varies.  I have an alarm clock (her name is TinyE) and she goes off at inconsistent times.  Usually it is between 6:00 and 7:00.   2. Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?  No, my alarm clock does not recognize weekends.  I used to sleep in until like 8.  Sometimes I get up super early (5:30) and play golf.   3. Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?  Void.   4. How long does it take to get ready for your day?  It varies, sometimes I surf the web and that extends my prep time.  It usually takes me about 30 minutes.  It takes me another 30 minutes to get TinyE ready.   5. When possible, what is your favorite place to go for breakfast?   It's a three way tie:  McDonald's (multiple locations), The Highland Grill (St. Paul) and The Louisiana Cafe (St. Paul).

       I Don't Like the Sprite in Me   The other day, I had a bottle of Tropical Sprite Remix (no, I'm not making that name up).  You'd think I would like it.  As an American Negro, I really connect to Sprite products generally (all their ads are targeted right toward urban blacks (of which I am both)).  And, for those of you who don't know it, my people luvs them some flavored pop.  If you've ever wondered who buys strawberry or orange or grape pop, its AfAms, baby, its AfAms!  But I digress...  Tropical Sprite Remix is the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth, and I am a cigar smoker, so that's saying something.

       Moving Woes   When I think about the possibility of moving again, I need to remember where I made mistakes the last time around.  Word to the wise: don't let your parents unpack your stuff.  Sure they're helpful, but maybe a little too over-zealous in getting it all unpacked right away.  2 problems I encountered: 1) Mom & Dad unpacked my entire kitchen and it took me a good week to find out where everything was.  I couldn't eat cereal for a couple days because I couldn't find my bowls.  2) I let Mom unpack my books, and she found  urlLink this .  Since my mom would  never  believe that her little angel would buy such a thing on her own, I just blamed it on my crazy Minnesota friends, telling her it was bought for me as a "gag gift".  Sorry HAL and BB.  I panicked and sold you down the river.

       Just gross.   Last night I took a certain New Jersey-based client out for drinks.  Upon leaving the bar (around midnight), said client exclaimed, "Ewww!  There is an old guy making out with a girl in that car" and pointed out the car behind us.  I looked over and caught a haggard-looking man who seemed to be around 70, smooching on a woman who was probably in her mid-twenties.  I'm glad I wasn't eating at the time.  I can only surmise that she was a prostitute, but the vehichle, woman, and location did not provide the context in which I would expect to stumble across someone turning a trick.  That said, I don't think those two were exactly dating.  As my companion pointed out "oooohh, I think she's really drunk".  Ewwww!  And you think Bob is a slut?

       The Debate, Settled  By Duf "The Judge" Fer  I have to side with Panda.  If she has a crush on David Hasselhoff, that's her business.  I do find it odd that he is now going by Bob, but it is plain to me that the man pictured there is none other than the star of such hit shows as Knight Rider, Baywatch, and Baywatch Hawaii.  Glad to lend a hand,  Duf'

      Panda - I know nothing about Bob, other than his dumb name and haircut, but considering he's on a show as daft as The Bachelor only stirs the embers of my dislike for the clown.    Don't get me wrong, I'm all about imperfections.  Some of the celebrities I've got crushes on are sometimes a bit out there.  (Christina Ricci, Gina Gershon, Bea Arthur) But Bob just has one of those faces (from what I've seen) that you just want to punch and mash into paste.  You know?

       The Man of my Dreams  by Panda "I’ve Dated All Types" Bear  Now, I'm not saying I know much about Bob Guiney.  I admit I probably have gotten sucked into the media hype surrounding him, but there's a reason so many girls think Bob's the ideal man (or at least  seems  to be).  He's  not  perfect.  Not even close.  He's clumsy, sensitive, and hilarious.  He's divorced.  He has a goofy haircut.  He doesn't have tons of money.  This makes him seem accessible to most girls out there.  When a middle-of-the-road woman looks at a man like Bob, she probably thinks "Hey, even I'd have a chance with that guy."    On the other hand, all the other Bachelors in the past were the exact opposite.  They were rich, arrogant, too-good-looking clowns that were just looking for a hot piece of ass.  Why would the majority of the women out there be attracted to that?  Just cuz they have better haircuts?  In my opinion, it's someone's imperfections that make him or her lovable.

       Everyone Wants to Be Found   BB, I happened to catch that one a couple weeks ago.  Bill Murray may get an Academy Award for this film since he didn't get one for  Rushmore ...but his humor came through differently here than in his other movies.  He perfected his sarcastic-lounge-singer-shtick on SNL, however during the most memorable scene of  Lost in Translation , he sings a karaoke version of "More Than This" with absolutely no condescencion.  The electric chemistry between Scarlett Johansson's character and Murray's is also cemented during this scene.  No doubt, anyone who sees this film will get lost in it.  On a very different side of things, I saw  urlLink The Magdalene Sisters  last weekend.  This movie is a fierce expose of Ireland's Magdalene laundries (which detained more than 30,000 morally "wayward" women to labor indefinitely in convent purgatories, until the last was shut down in 1996).  There were some horrific scenes in this movie that were just inexcuseable, driving home the director's obvious anger over this shameful blight in the Church's history.  My feeling upon leaving the theater: sadness and a contempt towards the religious figures of my own faith that could have allowed this to happen.  But this sort of thing has happened throughout history - women being proscecuted for being "temptresses" to men.  Maybe it's not the religion that's to blame; perhaps we should blame the men (and women) who went along with it without questioning their own moral implications.  One movie you should NOT go see:  urlLink Once Upon a Time in the Midlands .  It's slow and not funny.  Not even worth reviewing.

       BB Boom Boom on the PP  By Duf "So Proud" Fer  This morning, my little angel, mimmicking her father, disrobed, sat on her little poddy and, after bearing down, produced solid waste.  I expressed happiness but did not over do it.  I thought about yelling at her.  See, some interpret Freud to say that scaring a child while he or she is using the bowl will produce an adult obsessed with neatness.  Rewarding a child in that posture, will produce an adult who tolerates messiness and disorder.    Happy Friday!

      This from my Concert Friend Who is One Sharp Cookie By Duf Fer   ...in my opinion, the fact that we sat down for about 1/4 of the REM songs wasn't a reflection of us, but rather the songs. You really can't rock out to Nightswimming or Everybody Hurts. I'd say even 20 year olds would sit down during ballads.  I also think in Minnesota, perhaps more than in other states, there is definitely a herd mentality. People stand up if others stand up and don't if they don't. I'm definitely included in that, myself. I feel a great deal of social pressure not to stand if the people around me, especially behind me, aren't standing. That was true 15 years ago and it was true Tuesday. I remember years ago going to concerts and wondering why no one was dancing. I do think a younger crowd is more likely to stand because young people are more self-absorbed than others. But no one sat during any of the Fleetwood Mac concert and as we've discussed, that was the very definition of yuppy concert. I don't think there was much sitting during the Paul McCartney concert, but I can't say for sure. I do remember there was a jackass talking loudly during a lot of it, which was VERY annoying!   I think she is right.  I feel that song selection was an energy drain, and R.E.M. has its share of ballads that really play well on enduring albums and can be fine in concerts.  They have enough up tempo rocking tunes to keep things high too.  I also feel pressure to sit if the people behind me aren't standing.  I once had my life threatened at an Indigo Girls concert...

       That’s weird.   Today I folded and called the cable company to request hook-up.  Lest you think I’m frivolous, I signed up for the most basic service (less than $10/month) so that I can get decent reception (I can’t watch “The O.C.” in black and white with snow, yo).  I have guilt over all the DVDs I haven’t gotten around to watching, books I haven’t read, fresh air I haven’t had, and I think going without Comedy Central will open up about 17 hours in my week.  Anyway, I spoke with Glen (who was very helpful), and curiosity got the best of me.  I had to ask what the various levels of cable-dom would bring me.  Apparently, there are 3 levels of basic cable (wisely called “1”, “2” and “3”).  I’m getting the first option.  Glen explained what channels are available for each option… and when he mentioned Fox News (part of option #3, FYI), he editorialized that, “if you like news, that’s a really good channel”.  Uhhh, thanks Glen, but I’m doing just fine without Bill O’Reilly right now.  Point of the story is this… I get nervous around people that are enthusiastic about Fox News.  It’s one of my more recent phobias.

       Satisfactory in St. Paul  By Duf “Play Orange Crush, Damnit” Fer  Last night, at the R.E.M. show, I found myself thinking a lot about the event as a description of my demographic.  The American middle class, ages 30 to 40, largely white (your humble author excluded), largely educated, largely interested in staying in touch with the side of self that rocked from time to time.  What became apparent is that time has worn away our ambitions; we have aged with our performers.   Michael Stipe and the gang came out and started off with three energy filled and older R.E.M. standards (I should look them up, but I’m at work and need to hurry this along).  Stipe was a whirlwind of energy dancing and throwing his arms, jumping and cavorting.  He talked about his penis.  But as the show continued on, his energy lagged.  The overall energy lagged.  Concert energy is a weird symbiotic thing.  One can get bogged down in wondering whether the band creates the energy and the crowd feeds off of it, or whether the crowd creates the energy and the band feeds off it.  Most would acknowledge that both the band and the crowd have the ability to create and kill a good vibe.  The best shows are those where the two work together to create a phenomenal energy (see, e.g. the Pearl Jam show at the Xcel Energy Center this past June).  Last night, in St. Paul, a great concert was made good by a lack of energy (HAL and Panda will recall our Coldplay show in Chicago where the band showed up to rock, but the fans did not).  As I analyze what depleted the energy last night, what I’m left with is the following:  R.E.M. by its set selection, failed to follow a pattern that promotes an energetic response.  For my money, the best concerts follow one of three formulas.    Formula one:  The concert starts kind of low (slower tempo song that scream warm up) and finishes high leaving an emotional peak at the end.  This is one of my favorite models.  The band knows their entrance is good for 15 minutes worth of energy, use that to play slow and low.  Formula two:  or, what I call the inverted bell curve:  bands start high, bring things down a bit and then finish high again.  Not a personal favorite, but I have seen it done very well.  Formula three:  is the (extremely difficult and rarely pulled off formula) of starting high and staying high all night.  Bands that hope to pull this off need to draw on a number of things:  a selection of up tempo rocking songs that they can play for two hours, a crowd that will, with them, keep things at a fever pitch, and an emotional hook (the loss of an important person to the band, or a homecoming, a reunion show, or a retirement show, anger, glee, drugs (not kidding) something, anything).  Last night, R.E.M. followed what I call the EKG model where they vacillated to closely between up tempo songs and down tempos songs.  Any D.J. worth a turntable investment will tell you there is a value in having some connection (in tempo or in theme from one song to the next).  The EKG model is not conducive to good energy. At one point I felt like I was at mass. Sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up.  Second, Stipe talked too much.  I know that concert conversations can build intimacy, and his stories were great, but if cutting the comments in half would have allowed a couple of more songs (like, oh, say “Orange Crush”), I think we all would have been better off.  Third, they did not play Orange Crush.  Fourth, the show was not sold out – that can keep a band flaccid like nothing else.  In the age of $75 dollar tickets, it is clear that the stakes are higher.  Concertgoers are right if they expected the band to do most of the heavy lifting.  I also suspect that there is actuarial methodology around the benefits of having a nearly sold out show at $75 per seat instead of a sold out show at $50 per seat.  While it is not egalitarian, my thought is that tiered pricing is the way to go – it allows your fans to come without being limited by income restrictions.  Sure, it’s yucky that those who have more money to spend can get better seats, but at least more people can go.  In any event, the show was not sold out, and I think that contributed as an energy drain.    Fifth, to dovetail on my opening comment, I think our beloved band, and its beloved fans, are part of a demographic that desperately wants to rock and truly wants to go all night long, but just can’t do it.  My concert friend (as my brother in law calls her) are thirty somethings, and we danced all night at Pearl Jam, but I think we were inspired by our younger co-goers who have the metabolism to rock non-stop.  Without them last night, we were not ashamed to sit from time to time.  But about my demographic:  we have to recharge our Starbucks card, we have schedule maintenance for our traction control cars, and we have a spreadsheet due right after our 9:00 conference call.  Like many of the folks at the concert last night, we want to think we can stand up for two hours of great rock and roll, but instead, our default setting is to sit for fine entertainment.

       I am, I am, I am Superman and I Know What’s Happenin’ By Duf “I’ve Been There I Know the Way” Fer  Tonight I am going to the R.E.M. show at the Xcel Energy Center (don’t hate).   Ticket price:  $75 Ticketmaster markup:  $215 Shipping fee:  $10 Handling:  $17.50  Now, for you younger Pandylanders, R.E.M. is an alternative rock and roll group.  Rock and roll is a style of music that Duf listened to when he was your age.  R.E.M. started in the late 70’s in a town called Athens in a state called Georgia.  While they have had many hit records, it could never be said that they are as popular as Brittney Spears or Justin Timberlake or anything.  R.E.M. has a site where you can request songs for them to play tonight.    I requested:   Orange Crush  from the controversial album  Green    "Follow me, don't follow me:  I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush."   Can’t Get There from Here  from the album  Fables of the Reconstruction  (certified Duf Platinum)  "When your world is a monster, bad to swallow you whole..."   Saturn Return  from their latest LP,  Reveal   "Easy to poke yourself square in the eye, harder to like yourself, harder to try..."  I will have a full review tomorrow.  Yours,  Duf

       I Like the Soap   Especially if it's Aveda...my collection increases by 3 this week since I'm in NYC through Thursday.  God help me if I get stuck here because of the hurricane.  I went to a brand new all-you-can-eat Sushi/Teriyaki restaurant last night.  It was fabulous, but I think I overdosed on shrimp cocktail.  We were the only Westerners in the place, so the food must have been pretty authentic.    It's also fashion week in NY, so there are a lot of skanky looking model-types walking around.  Robert and I saw one woman last night who had barely any clothes on except these weird, pajama-style flowy pants.  She looked like MC Hammer's back-up dancer.

       We All Mourn in Our Own Way   I may not have listened to much Johnny Cash in my day, but I do really like Bob Dylan, and from the little I know about Johnny, I'd say the two are fairly similar.  They both have a huge male following, both write  amazing  lyrics (need I refer to my favorite Bob song, "To Make You Feel my Love"), both have a dark side, and both have/had so-so voices.  Also, the influence they both have on other musicians says a lot about their great talent.  So I thought I'd mourn in my own way today at noon, by heading over to the  urlLink H & M  grand opening on Michigan Ave.  The Midwest has needed this store for a while now, and it's  finally  here.  You'd think I was in line with 12-year-old girls going to an N'Sync concert the way people were pusing, shoving, and carrying on.  When they finally lifted the rope for me and my friend Kellie, we had to rush in and grab the first things we saw.  There was no trying anything on, so I just nabbed a purse, bought it, and said good-bye to Kellie.  She actually took the whole day off of work just to shop there today.  What women do for cheap couture fashion.

       I Hang My Head and Cry  By Duf Fer  “I am an alcoholic.  I am a drug addict.  I am a homosexual.  I am a genius.” -Truman Capote  “I’m an artist, a poet, a genius, I know it.  I don’t buy cheeba, I grow it.”   -Adam Yauch  The man in black is dead.  I learned of it this morning while getting ready for work.  If you don’t understand Johnny Cash (my wife does not understand Johnny Cash.  When I play his music, she groans audibly.  I won’t put her down for that.  Johnny Cash is not the most easily appreciated musician of all time.  He does not sing exceptionally well (and never really did).  He is not exactly Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix with the guitar (though his gifts are ample).  There is much about his life that is not glamorous or enviable.  But if you don’t understand Johnny Cash), if you don’t get why he is so admired,  then you owe it to yourself to try to understand him.  He is one of the best songwriters this country has produced.  He recorded music for almost fifty years.  He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.  He was a gospel musician.  If you did a graph of the people he inspired and the people they inspired and the people they inspired, you would get all the way from Johnny Cash to Jack Johnson, and you would touch hundreds of artists in between.  Justin Timberlake was apparently raised on Johnny Cash.    The man in black was extraordinarily creative.  Along with his wife, June Carter Cash, he recorded the hit song “Ring of Fire” which is about a couple’s love but is derived from a term that every birth mother knows quite well.  By tying the two concepts together, the song asks what you would go through to create something meaningful.  If there is a more succinct statement of the cost of love, I don’t know what it is.  Ring of Fire is also an apt description of the creative process or, at least, Johnny Cash’s creative process.  As further testament to his creativity, he recorded songs by Sound Garden and by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and made them his own.  I adore Nine Inch Nails, but they will never own Hurt again; when Johnny Cash sings “the needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting,” somehow it becomes so much more powerful.    Johnny Cash wrote books and studied the bible.  He won a lot of Grammys and admiration in both Nashville and New York City.  Hell, earlier this month he was nominated for 7 MTV video music awards.    Johnny Cash’s love for June Carter was so profound and sincere, it compelled him to quit drugs and drinking and turn to Jesus.  He prayed daily and sincerely, but he would also kick your ass if you needed it.    Every man should aspire to be like Johnny Cash; every woman dreams of taking a rebel hell-raiser like him and converting him into a family man.    Though it is wrong of me to write it (I never met the man and cannot claim to know him).  I wonder if asked to describe himself, like Truman Capote did, like Adam Yauch did, I wonder if Johnny Cash might not say that he was:  An Alcoholic A drug addict A felon An asshole An infidel A divorcee A sinner A veteran A musician A songwriter A husband An uxorious husband A father A Christian A poet, and  A genius  So this morning, when I heard the news that Johnny Cash was dead, I thought about a couple of his own words.  His words about love for his wife June:   I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.  I keep my eyes wide open all the time.  I keep the ends out for the tie that binds...   Because you’re mine, I walk the line.   For his love, he walked the line.  Words are limited.  Actions are too, but much less so than words.  Songs about actions backed up by a life – that’s powerful and profound.  Profound like his words about mortality:   I hear the train a comin’  It’s comin’ round the bend…   Then, of course, there’s the gospel standard that the Carter Family made famous, but that Johnny Cash also recorded:   I was standing by my window On one cold and cloudy day…   It was so fitting to learn that this great American Icon is gone on a cold and cloudy morning.  R.I.P. Johnny Cash.    [May] the circle be unbroken…

       It's the Small Pleasures in Life   So y'all might have read or even heard my complaints about my job.  There are definite downsides to where I work: the constant travel, bitchy/demanding clients, horrible management, mediocre pay, impossibility for advancement...but I digress.  There are upsides too: I almost ALWAYS leave the office by 5 (except for the days I'm traveling 'til 9pm), I get to play whatever music I want at whatever volume (unless Robert is on a conference call; then he gets pissed), sometimes we play cards or have arguments about religion or politics for hours on end without disruption from our bosses, Thirsty Fridays, and making fun of our weird co-worker J who always screws us during happy hour by ordering about 5 Chivas on the rocks and then splitting the whole bill 4 ways.  But today is great.  Today we finally got our phone headsets in the mail.  You know, the hands-free headsets call center people usually wear.  I feel like I need to call up someone and make a huge deal, all while making very dramatic hand gestures.  I've been calling everyone I know, just to "test it out."  Maybe I'll call Hal next.  She loves to get calls at work.  Or my brother, who I try to make laugh just because he sits next to one of the Presidents of the bank.  Hands-free = good times.

       A Little Griping  By Cranky Duf'  Last night, I caught a red eye in San Francisco (11:50) to come back to Minnesota (8:30 after the connection in Chicago) for a meeting with both of my bosses (one of whom was flying in from NY).  I adore my bosses and feel quite fortunate to report to them.    My NY boss, who could rival Panda for frequent flyer miles, is a bit of a fraidy cat when it comes to air travel.  Anyway, he cancelled the trip and did not tell me.    He claims he cancelled because the fare was too high (which is about like DJS cancelling because the Bjork show was too long of a car trip).  But I think it is a 9-11 thing.  That tragedy hit him really hard.    Anyway, had he given me a head's up, I would have taken an alternate flight (there was one at 6:00 a.m. PST today, and another one at 2:30 PST - I could have worked a full day in San Fran and come home at a reasonable hour - alright, I could have done some tourist-y things instead of working and still come home at a reasonable hour).   Instead I am at my desk and so tired that my whole body hurts.

       By Popular Request...(okay, just Bass Babe)   Hiya kids.  Been a long time since I rapped at ya.  What's new?  Well, let's see...  - I finished the 3rd draft of my 2nd book.  It's now available for people to read (no pressure, friends).  I've been working my proverbial ass off for the last year (with a couple months off here and there) to get it done and it finally is!  Now I'll give myself a breather before I start the whole process again.  - Tonight I start my secondary career as an on-call firefighter/EMT.  Well, tonight is my orientation, anyway.  Turns out that there were 50 candidates and I'm one of 7 that made it this far.  Cra-zy.  I expect I'll have some interesting posts in the months to come.  Stay tuned, Pandtastics!  - I'm going to golf for the first time in my life on Saturday.  I imagine it will also be my last itme golfing as well.  I was cornered by some friends here at work and told it'll be fun and that it doesn't matter if I suck, since it's a best-ball challenge.  Snick here at work claims I may just have a wicked 'short game.'  What the hell does that mean?  Also, I don't know if I play right or left handed.  I'm not kidding.  - Item!  Anyone else stoked to see 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico?'  Really?  I'm the only one?  Well, it's got Salma Hayek in it, plus lots of guns.  It...can't...miss....!  - I haven't been able to fight space aliens after the loss of Stoner in outer space combat.  The academy has been calling for months, but I just can't seem to get it together and take to the stars as of late.  Hopefully, this will change and I'll be able to save the universe again.  - We're working on a video here at work.  I wrote the script and cast over 24 people to appear in it, including our very own HAL.  I even have a small cameo.  If we get together for a Pandyland Burrito Jamborree 4, we might have to screen it before the boozin' and singing commences.  Whattaya say?  Okay...that's going to do it for me.  Until next time, keep your pants on and keep reaching for the chips!  Delicious chips, that is.

       Yo, Where You At?   Hey Pandies...it's long lost Bass Babe. Where have you been Bass Babe? one might ask. Well, I've also been suffering from the Blogger Blues and haven't felt like posting while I sort out my Jerry Springer-esque personal life. It's been a tough couple months but I think I've finally reached the clearing. No one has stolen my bike and I have a new gig to look forward to this evening. ;) (Shout out to Duf Fer!) So here's the Friday Five comin at 'ya.    1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   Dishes. I have a dishwasher, but I even hate doing the minimal dishwashing like when I cook something in a big pot. I also dislike unloading the clean dishes into their respective cabinets or drawers. Laundry also ranks up there because it's time consuming.    2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   I don't mind vacuuming and cleaning out my closet of all the clothes I don't wear anymore. I just did this recently and it was pretty great to downsize by 7 grocery bags full of clothing!    3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   Just clean as needed.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   Nothing odd. Just make sure the kitchen is clean.    5. What was the last thing you cleaned?  My bathroom and kitchen before I went out of town last weekend. I, like Panda, enjoy coming home to a clean apt.

       Very timely.    With the recent move, I’ve been cleaning a lot, and having conversations with others about cleaning.  During the course of one conversation, I realized that there is always one weird cleaning thing that someone likes doing (and everyone else hates).  It was decided that several people should get together and go to each other’s homes and execute the task that we each enjoy doing.  The theory was that everyone would be simultaneously be happy and clean.  I’ll report back with the results.   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   Clearing clogged drains – hate it.  I also dislike dusting and vacuuming, but hate is too strong a word.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   Alright – here’s my weird cleaning thing – I like cleaning dead bugs from light fixtures.  Sorry, but I can’t help it.  I also don’t mind doing laundry (including putting clothes away), unless I need clean clothes and I don’t have time for laundry.   3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   No routine.  But I am tidy.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   Not really.  Before I go to bed, I like to straighten up (If I’ve done the dishes, I make sure they are put away), but I don’t know if that falls into “odd” territory.  It's not like I clean my bathroom floor with mouthwash...    5. What was the last thing you cleaned?  Last night I finally put my bed together and spent my first night in the new place (!!!).  I cleaned the bedroom floor, and my parents graciously helped me dispose of the boxes and packing materials that took up my entire main room.  Finally, I'd just like to say that I think the strong arm of the law came down on Phil because he didn't sell patriotic baked goods.  Just my $0.02.

       Best Album I've Gotten In A While   Friends, I can't tell you how much I love the new  Fountains of Wayne  effort  'Welcome Interstate Managers.'   Sure, you've probably heard their radio-friendly hit 'Stacy's Mom' but there's so much more to these guys that I can't even begin to tell you how much I dig this record.  These guys, admittedly, are a band that knows how to have fun.  That's not to say that all of their songs are about clowning around and recording tracks that are barely there in the effort to illicit laughs.  Here are some sample lyrics.  From  'Bright Future In Sales'   -  I gotta get my shit together, 'cause I can't live like this forever.  You know I've come to far and I don't want to fail.  I got a new computer and a bright future in sales...yeah, yeah.   From  'Hey Julie'  (my fav) -  Working all day for a mean little man, with a clip on tie and a rub-on tan.  He's got me running round the office like a dog around a track, but when I get back home you're always there to rub my back...   Okay, I'm not doing any justice to them, but trust me.  It's certified DJS Platinum.  When Dirty and I go on roadtrips, we usually come back with a CD that was the 'Official Soundtrack of the Trip.'  Fountains of Wayne won by a landslide.  We played it non-stop, yo.  Swing by for a listen if you're in the hizzy.

       La Morte d'Phil  By Duf Fer  Those of us who work in the International Plaza Building (DJS, Hal and me) have suffered a tremendous loss.  Our beloved Phil, owner, manager, cashier, stock boy and conversationalist of Phil's Snack Shop, has been evicted.     The Background:   Phil was straight up weird, yos.  He always ended any ring-up with "...is that all fer ya then?"  Also, we were having an auction once, and we asked Phil for a $5.00 gift certificate, and he asked us to give him some time to think about it.     The Recent Events:   A couple of weeks ago, Hal and I were downstairs at our cafe.  Phil had a lien notice taped to his door.  It seems some chip maker sued him in small claims court seeking and obtaining a judgment against him in the astronomical amount of $275.  The Sheriff posted a notice that Phil's failure to pay the outstanding amount left him subject to forfeiture of his property.  Then today, I saw a sign indicating that the space that once held Phil's Snack Shop is now for rent.    Our beloved Phil is gone.    Is that all fer ya then?

       Clean-up Friday Five   By Obsessive Compulsive PB   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?    1) Putting my clothes away.  For some reason, the extra effort of hanging stuff on a hanger puts me over the top.  2) The bathroom floor.  It makes me want to gag.   2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?    Vacuuming is the best because it's minimal effort and makes the place look 10 times better.   3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?    I usually keep things pretty tidy and picked up, but when I know I have guests coming into town for the weekend, the heavy-duty cleaning is done.  It also bugs me if I know I have dishes to do, so that's something that I keep up with.   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?    The only way you can truly get a floor clean is on your hands and knees.  Mops carry bacteria and just push the dirt around.  I learned this from my Type A mother.   5. What was the last thing you cleaned?   I made my bed, put away my laundry, and scrubbed my toilet.  I'm going to be out of town this weekend, but for some reason it's always comforting to come home to a clean john.  I'm weird, I know.  Let me just add, the perk of staying in hotels half my life is that I don't have to clean up after myself.  It's so satisfying to be able to use  all  the towels in the bathroom and then just throw them on the floor.  Hell, I can use a towel for each body part and it doesn't even matter!  Now that's living.

      Friday Five By Duf "Mr. Clean" Fer   1. What housekeeping chore(s) do you hate doing the most?   I don't like putting laundry away.  I can't figure out what it is, but I have a real block there.  It's horrible.     2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing?   I like to do the dishes.  It is my favorite chore.  I also like to vacuum, and I like dusting and using windex on glass and appliances.     3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed?   We don't really have a routine.  It's just catch as catch can.  We have a person who comes to help us once a week and she does all the heavy lifting (bathroom, floors, etc.).   4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules?   I am kind of fierce when it comes to scrubbing dishes, and I prefer hand washing to a dishwasher.     5. What was the last thing you cleaned?   Last night I vacuumed to help fight cat hair - my new favorite babysitter has a cat allergy, and I want to help keep the dander down.  This morning, after returning home from taking TinyE to daycare, I did the dishes and took some recycling out.  I also made the bed.

       We All Walk Around with Thresholds  By Dinosaur Duf Fer  Here is the deal with me and the Violent Femmes.  I think we are all allotted a maximum quantity of things in our life.  We walk around everyday with a riding-a-bus threshold, a chick-flick ceiling, and a visit-to-the-mall cap.  Everyone's threshold is different.  For example, DJS's mayonnaise threshold is comically low, while my french fry limit is almost inexhaustible.  My mother will not eat a hot dog, no matter what - she had to live on them when she was a poor college student, and she maxed out.  Anyway, during my college years, I reached my Violent Femmes limit.  I simply cannot hear "Blister in the Sun" again (although, it must be written that "American Music" is among the worst songs of all time - it ranks with "H.W.C." as being almost as bad as "Paradise by the Dashboard Lights").  I have heard it 100,000 times already.  It's not that I dislike the Violent Femmes, I'm sure they are just fine.  It's more that I am past my limit with them.    You never know when you are going to max out.  It just happens.  I hit my VF limit in 1987.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  It happened on March 15th at 10:17 a.m.  I was late for my Current American Foreign Policy class, and I was drunk.  My roommate Todd (late for his Comparative Lit class and stoned) took off my slightly warped LP of The Smiths' "Meat is Murder" and put on the Violent Femmes.  "Gone Daddy Gone" was spinning on our turn table, and I realized I was done.  I couldn't listen anymore.  I'd maxed out.   Historical note:  For you younger Pandylanders a turn table is a machine that is used to play LPs (a.k.a. records).  You see, before .WAV or the MP3 and before the mini disc, in fact, before the compact disc or the cassette tape, there was a music playing device called a record player.  People used it to play records.  You might have seen it at a club where a DJ is "spinnin' and winnin'."  Anyway, Duf the dinosaur actually had a record player in college.  As a side note, he graduated never having used a computer.  That's right all of his papers were written on a typewriter, and he used the shit out of white out.

      I like it, Duf, except the first song I heard was a ditty by the Violent Femmes.  I thought you hated those guys (or was it just "Blister in the Sun")?  I guess no radio station is perfect.

       DJS Should Appreciate This   I've recently applied for a position with a company (that will remain unnamed) in the Twin Cities.  If I would get the position, I would report to a person with the last name of "Bjork".  It's fate.  Plus, how cool would it be to address my boss as "Mr. Bjork"?  I guess you'd have to be a fan to appreciate that.

       Wisco Never Sleeps   This just in, from a fellow Wisco-nite we met on Friday after the Cubs game.  Unfortunately, I don't remember what he looked like (give me a break, we were in the bleachers and my friends were buying the beers), but he sounds like fun.  He e-mailed this note to me and the other Sconie girls I was with.  Any of y'all who are in the Chicago area, should stop on by the Alumni Club on Sundays...   "That's right ladies -       Wisco-Nation never lies down and takes a nap; especially on Sundays when perfection strolls out onto the field.  Not everyone is perfect, not everyone can be Brett Favre.  Actually, not everyone knows a lot about football.  But I'm assuming that since you chosen few are from Wisconsin, you might know about a sport called football, and a team in northern Wisconsin that plays just about every Sunday through the fall.  My job is to ensure that all people who enjoy viewing such a sport get the opportunity to do so in the right environment.  Namely, with me and about anyone else I can scrap together in this God-forsaken state (damn FIBs).         Seriously, since moving here I've trekked my ass every Sunday to the Alumni Club on Division for the games.  It's a Bear hang-out, but the owner is from Wisco and plays Green Bay upstairs with the Bears downstairs.  It isn't exactly the classiest bar in Chicago, but the beer is cheap, and I routinely get hammered and throw things.  I've got a few people who are always there with me, and there are always a bunch of people from Wisco who will seem somewhat familiar to me since I got drunk with them 16 Sundays last year.         Drop me an e-mail if you want, or just show up (by the way, I'm the guy from Guthrie's).  There are many things for us to be proud of, being from Wisconsin, and none less than our ability to cheer for Green Bay in a victory, or cloud our brain so heavily with beer that we forget about the loss."   If my memory serves me right, he was the guy I took a picture with who kept making a "W" gang-type sign with his hand and was incessantly yelling out "go Wisco!".  I'll be the first to admit that Packer fans are obnoxious.  Let's hope Lee Jeans can keep up with me and my family when we're all at Lambeau this Sunday.  He has no idea what he's in for, poor thing.

       We have an epidemic on our hands.   Don't you guys see?  Someone (or an entire group of hatemongers) hates the Pandys, and he/she/they are stealing our bikes to get back at us.  I don't have a bike to steal, but DJS and Bass Babe should be worried.  Whoever this creep is, I hope he/she/they will just leave us alone!!

       Something About the Big City?   Part of the reason I'm trying to escape the throngs of Chicago is because of the mistrust I have for the people around me.  I've learned I can't trust those I work with, those who live in my building, the mayor (espcecially the mayor - he's a corrupt mob-boss), or even my mailman.  Everytime I come home, I see a different note on the front door of my building from someone pleading to have a package returned.  (Our stupid mailman puts our packages in a "free-for-all" bin, which only encourages this stealing behavior.  Moral of the story: I never have stuff shipped to my house.)  I also recently saw a note on my neighbor's door that indicated it was a felony to steal a neighbor's newspaper (must be a lawyer-type).  How much is a newspaper these days, $.35?  What is wrong with these people?  The last straw happened late last week.  Someone stole my bike out of my building's supposed secure and locked underground garage.  It was locked to itself, but not to anything else, so someone probably just picked it up and put it in their car.  If my bike was a $2000 mountain bike, I could see why someone would want it, but it was a 1975 brown vintage Schwinn with a bent frame and shoddy gears.  Maybe they really liked the Mickey Mouse bell or perhaps one can get big money for vintage bikes on the black market?  Whatever the case, I hope whoever has it now is enjoying it.  The thing is, I'm not mad about someone actually taking the bike. (Although there was a definite sentimental attachment to it - it was the bike my mom used when I was a baby...there used to be a baby seat on the back of it.)  What bothers me is that people are that inconsiderate of other people's things.  I know whoever stole it could probably afford to buy one on their own.  Plus, they probably had a car, which I do NOT have.  And now, I don't have a bike either.  But what makes me saddest is to see posts like Duf's below, because I'm hoping when I move to the Twin Cities, I will not be surrounded by crazy, irrational behavior such as this.  I tried to explain to my parents (who cursed Chicago when they were here over the weekend - they hate the traffic, lack of parking spaces, rude people, and now, especially, whoever stole my bike) that there are assholes everywhere.  I'm just surrounded by MORE PEOPLE, and therefore it  seems  like there are substantially more assholes.  I would bet the percentage of assholes in Appleton, WI is the same as in Chicago.  I still can't wait to move out of this hole.

       He is Bad News/There is No Good Answer  By Africanized Duf Fer  It appears that we have a suspect in our garage break-in (and in the unauthorized use of our charge account).  It is a family friend.  Add to the list of lost items the last remaining (though microscopically small) vestiges of our innocence.  Add to the list of things we have to deal with betrayal and heartbreak.  He is bad news. I called the police and ratted out my friend.  It is amazing how much more dishonesty and disregard hurt us when they come from the hands and words and actions of people who purport to love us.  The friend is the son of a closer friend, and she is wrestling with the question of what to do.  She loves her son, but she needs to get away from him.  He is bad news.  He lies to her more than he speaks truth to her.  He steals from her.  He defrauds her.  He uses her love against her.  She now cannot take him around her friends because he will do the same to them (he was painting our garage recently).  He is bad news.  She needs to simultaneously be there for him (the obligations of parenthood) and keep away from him (the obligations of tough love).  There is no good answer.  He is bad news.    In other news, my niece is removing her eyelashes.  Not a nervous habit, more like an indication of an anxiety disorder.  She is 7 years old.    Finally saw "Bowling for Columbine" last night.  The part that is really sticking with me:  the whole business about the "Africanized" Killer Bees.    My next three messages will be shiny and happy.    I promise.

       Happy Halloween, Pandies.    1. What was your first Halloween costume?  It was either a tiger or a bunny.  My mom made me and my brother these costumes and we each wore one or the other (we got to switch each year) until we were about 10.  If you wore the bunny costume, you got pink lipstick on your nose (because all cute, little bunnies have horrible, bright pink snouts).  If you were the tiger?  Bring out the black eyeliner and you got yourself some whiskers.   2. What was your best costume and why?  I wore a slutty nun costume freshman year of college.  Mini-skirt, fish nets, low-cut body suit, and then the veil.  It probably wasn't the best costume, but it definitely gave me a lot of attention.  Especially from some guy at a frat party we went to who was dressed up as a priest.  Of course, we had to make out... because WWJD? (I'm totally going to Level 9 of hell.)   3. Did you ever play a trick on someone who didn't give you a treat?  Dumb question.  Next.   4. Do you have any Halloween traditions? (ie: Family pumpkin carving, special dinner before trick or treating, etc.)  Every year we would carve a pumpkin, making a huge mess in the kitchen with all the pumpkin goo.  When my brother and I grew out of trick-or-treating, we would devise plans to scare the neighbor kids.  One year my brother wore oversized clothes, stuffed himself with pillows, and wore a scary mask so he looked like a fake-scarecrow-type guy.  He sat on the porch with the bowl of candy in his lap with a sign in it reading "Take ONE, please."  Then our friend across the street hid next to the house with an ax.  Any kid that took more than one piece (which was most of them - stealers) would get the scare of his/her life.  My bro would stand up and bellow "I  SAID  only ONE piece!" and would chase after them like a zombie.  Then our friend would crawl army style across the lawn with the ax to get the kids from behind.  One time a huge man and his daughter approached the house, with the kid in a wagon.  His daughter was scared to take a piece so the dad said "There's nothing to be afraid of, honey.  He's not real."  When he went to get the candy, my bro stood up and scared him shitless.  "Hey man, that's NOT COOL.  NOT COOL at all." And he raced across the lawn with his crying daughter in the wagon.  Comedy gold.   5. Share your favorite scary story...real or legend!  Too busy.  But here's a  urlLink link .

       Room on Fire, Reviewed  By Duf Fer  I got the new Strokes album, "Room on Fire," yesterday (its release date), and it is very darn good.  I don't think it is as commercially viable as their debut "Is This It?", but it is an impressive work.    In my view, their technical skills are neither diminshed nor improved.  They can still rock out, but they don't bring as much energy to the songs here as in the debut.  I think this is intentional.  They are quieting things down a bit, and just as "Is This It" was a throwback to classic American Rock and Roll, this new piece is an extension with the lights adjusted to effect a different mood.    The opening track "What Ever Happened?"  Seems like a VH1 joke disguised as a love song and is clearly the high point on the disc.  "I want to be forgotten, and I don't want to be reminded..."  The low point?  There really isn't one.    "Between Love and Hate" is another favorite.  Overall "Room on Fire" is a solid effort that does not topple the primacy or primal-cy of their original effort but establishes The Strokes as a band with its own distinct and wonderful sound and furthers their effort to resurrect pure American rock-and-roll.

       You Win Some, You Lose Some   I was in Detroit the last couple days for work.  God help Detroit-ians.  That city, um...really blows.  My boss is an avid gambler, so I was dragged to a casino on Sunday night.  No, not the somewhat nice one across the river in Canada, but an awful hole-in-the-wall in Greektown.  In fact, I think it was called the "Greektown Casino."  It was, quite possibly, the worst casino ever.  And this is coming from a girl from Wisco who's seen pretty bad casinos on Indian reservations.  Granted, I'm no gambler.  I headed straight for the nickel slots (in an area of the casino called "Nickel Heaven.")  My boss bellied up to the craps table and since it was obvious he had no desire to teach me the game, nickel slots were my best alternative.  I was surrounded by blue-hairs, obscenely obese men, street people, and carnies.  This ain't saying much, but I was definitely the most attractive person in the place.  I had to ask some old ladies to show me how the nickel slot games worked - they had surprisingly complicated rules for only having nickel winnings.  I won 250 nickels on a lucky pull.  That's $12.50 in case you're interested.    Since the smoke was really getting to me (one of the blue-hairs offered me a Parliament), and my boss was ignoring me, I thought it was time to cash out.  Plus, they didn't even have free cocktails.  I was lucky enough to get on an earlier flight yesterday to come home.  I was excited to get out of that city ASAP.  I waited by the gate (I was there about 45 minutes before flight time) and didn't hear my flight get called.  All of a sudden, I saw the city change on the digital sign behind the ticket desk.  I ran up there and asked what happened to the flight.  "We just closed the gate.  You can't get on that flight." "But I had a ticket!  I never heard you announce boarding!" *type, type, type* [No Apology] "Here's a ticket for the next flight." (3 hours later.)  Now, I  know  I wasn't going crazy.  There were other people around me that never heard them board the flight either.  We were pissed.  I called American today and got a $150 voucher and an upgrade to my status.  It pays to be a complainer.  ***************  Duf, a couple things: how was the S&G show?  Also, I have had the Strokes new album on my Amazon wishlist for a while and not  one  bite.  Maybe I'll get it for Christmas?

      Duf, what is a "Tootsie" or a "Kramer vs. Kramer"?  Thanks in advance.  And while we're on the topic of gratitude, thanks to BB for inviting me to my first gay Halloween party.  I have enjoyed Halloween in the past, and I've also been to parties hosted by our homosexual friends.  But put the two elements together, and, well... it's like Mardi Gras + Christmas x MAC cosmetics.  A fun time.

       Room On Fire/400,000 New Yawkahs Can't be Wrong  By Duf Fer  The new Strokes disc:  "Room on Fire" is out tomorrow.  Word is bond.  Tonight, Mrs. Duf and I are going to the Simon and Garfunkel show in St. Paul.  Simon and Garfunkel are a "pop" duo that rose to fame in the 60's and 70's with hits like "Mrs. Robinson" "Sounds of Silence" and "Bridge over Troubled Water."  One half of the duo "Paul Simon" went on a fine solo career that included hits like "You can Call Me Al" and "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes."  Simon and Garfunkel's songs were the soundtrack to the popular movie "The Graduate" starring a young up and comer named Dustin Hoffman (who went on to star in such films as "Tootsie" and "Kramer vs. Kramer.").  S & G held a concert in New York City's fabled Central Park and 400,000 people went (it was free).    Don't hate.

       I'm With DJS   Getting old is a double-edged sword.  I can't wait to retire.  But then I can definitely wait to be put in a home to "live" the rest of my days.  Billygoat's poor grandfather is about 93 now.  Whenever I ask him (BG) how his grandfather is, he says something (tragically) funny like "well, he just had  another  birthday." or "My parents are basically waiting for him to pass away so they can finally go on a vacation." (Grandfather lives with his parents.)  The poor man seems to just keep on ticking.  He has what BG's parents call "mini-strokes" every other week.  He recently had to get one of his legs amputated because of bed sores.  He sometimes forgets he doesn't have this leg and takes a leap out of his chair to go to the bathroom.  If I get to that point, bring me out into the backyard and take me out "Old Yeller" style.  Please.  If you're bored today (like Rob and I are), check out  urlLink these videos .  Our favorite is "Hey Ya."  Outkast is so great.

       I Don't Want To Get Old by DJ Shovelpants   All right, I'm not saying I want to die soon or anything, but I really don't want to get really old...and feeble...and helpless.  Last night I met up with my FTO (Field Training Officer) at the fire department to go over some stuff I missed in class on Monday (while I was rockin' with the EELS).  I got to tear around town in one of the trucks (a DJS first) and go through an obstacle course we set up, open up a hydrant, spray about 500 gallons of water around, the works.  It was a great night to catch up on stuff.  Did it all in about an hour and a half.  I got home and was about to turn around to meet DJ LZ and Darb at the local watering hole when my pager chirped:   'Station XXXX please respond to 123 Fake Address Drive for a medical emergency.  93 year old woman, vomiting, may be unconcious...'   What to do?  Do I go and eat chicken wings or do I head back to the station and possibly help save a life?  I opted for the station.  I got on the ambulance in the nick o' time and we tore off on a Code 3 (that's light and sirens).  At the house, an old woman was hunched over the kitchen table with an oxygen mask on.  She lived with her middle-aged plus daughter and immediately I could smell it.  The smell of old age.  Urine.  Feces.  Oldness.  The woman was a withered and fragile husk of what she had once been and there was a crowd of people (police/paramedics, EMTs, us) doing all kinds of stuff for her.  Because I'm still a trainee, I couldn't do much, but we loaded her onto the ambulance and I could smell that she hadn't asked to go to the bathroom.  Some of the veterans in the department would call that a Code Brown.  I guess it's funny when you don't smell it.  The ride to the hospital was absolutely crazy.  Doing 80 miles an hour, sitting around a poor old woman, who quite frankly, just wanted to die.  The paramedic was asking me for help and I was almost afraid to do anything.  I haven't even start EMT classes yet!   'Hand me 500 mg of sodium chlroride and tubing.  When I give the signal, I'm going to need you to spike the bag, bleed it off and then hand me the needle.'   Errr....right.  The woman's arm was bleeding from a IV that didn't take and I was holding a piece of gauze on there.  Meanwhile we're barreling toward White Bear Lake.  The paramedic kept putting her hand on the old woman's head and assuring her that she was going to be okay.  Oddly, I don't think she wanted to be okay.  After all was said and done, we delivered her to the hospital, barely intact but alive.  We talked a bit afterwards and the paramedic/cop asked me how long I'd been on.  When I told her a little over a month and a half, she just about shit.  With my FTO right there, she said I 'worked well under pressure.'  Cool.  But still...I don't want to get old.  If I'm looking like I'm ready for the dirt nap.  Just let me go, man...

      DJS, allow me to explain.  Lost In Translation is a slow movie - you're not *missing* anything by walking away from it with that impression.  In my opinion, it was blissfully slow.  How do you convey boredom and isolation with a fast pace?  You don't.  While I didn't find it boring, I can see where others might.  It's a quiet movie about having everything and nothing, being alone in a crowd, Japan, karoke, platonic love, marriage, and friendship.  And Bill Murray.  And fax machines.  It's also an adventure movie - not in the "Goonies" sense, but in the "out with people you don't know, in an unfamiliar place, not knowing what the night will lead to" sense.  So we will agree to disagree... I didn't find it boring.  But we'll agree to agree that Bill Murray is beyond great.

       Thanks.   I feel like I'm 112 years old.  This aging shit is for the bird.  For...the...birds.  Let me throw some random stuff at you:   Elliott Smith:  Don't know him, didn't know him, probably won't miss him.  He did some song for 'Good Will Hunting' which (the movie) was grossly overrated.  Enjoy your time, El.  Oops.  Too late.   Kill Bill Vol. 1:  I thought it was fun.  There were some parts I could've done without (see: Sonny Chiba scene about getting the tea) and others that I'll probably think about for some time.  Yeah, it's not an important movie and one could definitely live without seeing it, but I thought it was a damn good time.  (Closed Circuit to Duf: The nurse?  That was Daryl Hannah)  I'll take Lucy Liu any day...you know, if I wasn't engaged or what-not.   Lost In Translation  - Saw it Saturday night and I've took two things away from it.  1. Bill Murray is a genius.  The acting was superb and I'd love to see him get a delicious nomination from his performance.  2. The movie was easily the most boring movie I've seen in some time.  This must've been the pitch:   Okay, so I've got this idea for a movie.  Two people are stuck in Japan and they're bored.  They sort of like each other because they've got a few things in common.  What do you think?   If I'm not getting something from this movie, go ahead and e-mail me and clear it right up.  djshovelpants@yahoo.com

       Once Again Back is the Controversial  By Duf "I love DJS" Fer  OK, ready?  I saw "Kill Bill, Vol. 1" and I thought it was OK just O...K...  I liked it well enough, but in my view it was ice cold.  There was not much warmth in it at all.  I thought all the acting was good.  I liked the fight scenes.  The "stylized" violence that everyone talks about was fine.  I could look at Uma's butt for another hour or so at least.  Even with all that though, I dunno, it's hard to explain, but Bill just left me flat.    I read a review in the New Yorker (hated it) and one in the City Pages (loved it), and understood how both arrived at their different opinions.  The New Yorker reviewer said that after he left, he felt nothing and even called the film crap.  The City Pages mentioned the homage to Kung Fu cinema and Brian DePalma (notably the nurse scene - who IS that actress by the way?, I want to give up my current life and follow her especially if she will do that homicidal nurse bit for me) and the use of colors and angles.    By the way, here is a quote from City Pages that will prove DJS right and prove me right too (just kidding, we all know critics are assholes, and only an asshole would quote an asshole to make a point):   But I had no idea that Tarantino possessed the skills to sustain a near-unbearable emotional intensity at the same time. Kill Bill Vol. 1 isn't a career high: Tarantino's masterwork remains Jackie Brown, a haunting tale of careworn love buried in a pulp-novel graveyard. But in its meticulous craftsmanship and jacked-up cinephilic energy, Vol. 1 might be the most viscerally and emotionally overwhelming B movie ever made.    I felt that Uma Thurman did a great job, and I am totally in love with Lucy Liu.  I will see Vol. 2, but I did not think this was one of his best efforts.    Opinion.  DJS:  That Eels show sounds like a little slice of heaven.    Hal:  I'm synchin' right now.  Oh the joys!  BB King:  I miss you.  Call or write.  Panda:  Sorry I missed your MN engagement (two nights only!).

       Wow.  Tough Crowd.   Hey kids.  Just got back from Madison, Sconie (ooh...I hate that) where I saw quite possibly one of the coolest concerts of my life.  Of course, I'm talking about the EELS.  Who did you think?  The friggin' Eagles?  Please...  They played Monday night at a club called Luther's Blues which is like a cross between First Avenue and Chammps (you know, those restaurants?).  Small, small venue.  Just the way DJ likey.  There was an opening act, DJ Honky, who is basically a side project for EELS front man Mark Oliver Everrett, also known as E.  The guy was dressed like an old man who spun records and basically just smoked his pipe and stood there.  Hilarious.  Twenty minutes later, the EELS hit the stage.  Kool G Murder on bass, Puddin' on drums, and some new guy called Chet the 3rd on lead guitar.  But where was E?  Coming through the crowd, riding on someone's shoulders and playing a harmonica was our lead singer.  Dressed in jean jacket and tough guy glasses (which he never removed once) he took the stage and they tore through 5 songs before he even said 'Hello, Madison.'  I went with my partner in crime Dirty Abbott (which makes 2 successful concert road trips this year) and we stood literally 3 feet from the Mr. E.  They had set lists taped to the stage that were designed to throw people off.  Namely, they didn't play a single song off the list.  Classic.  I scored a guitar pick and Dirty got hit in the face with a flying drumstick.  He was asking for it.  The EELS tore through many of my favorite cuts on their albums, including my favorite 'Mr. E's Beautiful Blues.'   The smokestacks spittin' black soot into the sooty sky The load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage The ringmaster's telecaster sings on an empty stage  Uh-huh God damn right, it's a beautiful day  Uh-huh God damn right, it's a beautiful day,  Uh-huh    The real bonus?  4 encores, including one with the lights up and most of the crowd gone.  "Ladies and gentlemen...the EELS have left the building.  Just kidding, here they are!"  It's in the top 5, kids.

       Blown out of Proportion   I was watching the Early Show this morning (to catch a glimpse of  urlLink my beloved , of course) and they had an interview about Steve Bartman, the poor sap who is now part of Cubs lore.  Except they didn't actually interview  him , they interviewed his fricking  neighbors .  And then his written apology was aired, spoken not by  him , but his  brother .  Isn't this "man shrouded in mystery" stuff just a little too much?  I think it's making an even bigger deal of it, personally.  Even the Cubs themselves have emphasized he shouldn't be blamed.    Whatever.  I'm over it.  One of the guys I work with is a stand-up comedian on the side.  He had a show at the  urlLink Gotham Comedy Club  last night, which I attended.  So instead of crying my eyes out watching the Cubs lose last night, I was laughing it up to about 7 comics.  My friend was killer funny.  It's weird because his day-job is so not funny (he's in my department.  I can vouch for that.).  It's like he became a different person on stage.  And here I thought I was going to have to heckle him.

       Honestly   I was pretty interested in the whole curse thing and the poor, dumb, nerdy son of a bitch who is Chicago's most hated.  I learned quite a bit about the goat curse and how it was placed on the dirty ol' Cubs and honestly, from a 30+ year old kid who can't resist a good story...I was intrigued.  I actually felt sorry for the guy and watch some of the news this morning and heard some of the fans reactions to what happened.   "I wanted to fire that asshole (tastefully bleeped) down!"   Once sausage-eating Chicago asshole muttered.   "He should be kilt!"   Yeah, that's how he said 'killed' it's a Chicago thing, I think.  Poor asshole.  That's what he got for being a superfan.  Not only was he at the game to watch his favorites superjocks run around in their gay little stirrups, he was also listening to it on the radio and sadly...he never saw it coming.  So I admit.  I was engaging in some baseball talk a bit today.  Okay, so maybe it was around 10-15 minutes worth (all told).  If this kind of thing (or something like it) was guaranteed to happen every game, I'd become a fan.  Until then?  No time.

       I think only Duf wants my reaction   I have a feeling most readers don't care what I think about the Cubs (DJS may fit into this category).  But if you  need  to know, initially I wanted to rip that clown's head off.  I'm sure if I would have been at the game, I would have thrown my beer at him like everyone else.  But then I thought about it.  What's a baseball fan's first reaction when a ball is coming towards him/her?  To reach out for it and try to grab it (or at least protect yourself from it).  Sure, "that fan" could have taken the high road and stepped back from it, all while trying to get everyone else to back up too, but most likely there would have been some other idiot trying to jump over these people to get his hands on a championship ball.  I think it was instinct, and he went for it, especially because the ball looked like it was out of play.  It's unfortunate, but you can't tell me the same thing couldn't happen again.  And that one instance did  not  cost the Cubs the game.  This was not the only chance the Cubs had to recover.  How about the bobbled possible double play?  No one is threatening to kill Alex Gonzalez (the dumb fool).  It was a terrible, unbelievable upset.  (Not that I  care , or anything...)  So how 'bout those Red Sox?  Will the curse be lifted?

       Ah, the Power of Persuasion   Duf, you are my hero.  You are probably one of the only smug marrieds I know to acknowledge this injustice.  And here I thought I'd be accused of having a huge chip on my shoulder....  But I used my single status to my advantage last night.  After bringing up my problem to several front desk staff members and to a few managers, I finally clawed my way to the top - the GM of the Marriott Courtyard Midtown East - basically the CEO of the hotel.  I explained what had happened and expressed my fear as a "single woman alone in [her] hotel room..."  I also used my "preferred customer status" at Marriott chains (I'm a silver member, the lowest of statuses, but status just the same).  I reminded him that I spend thousands of dollars at his hotel, and because of this "incident" I may be forced to not book here again.  "Ms. Panda, we are at your mercy. [No lie - those were his exact words.]  What can we do for you?  A free breakfast, perhaps?"  I went for the gold.  "I want a free night."  An hour later, the GM met me in the lobby.  "I have comped all charges from last night."  Score one for the single lady.  I got a $250/night room for free.

       It  Is  Discrimination (with a stunning surprise ending)  By Duf Fer  I have been meaning to respond to your post from a few days ago, Panda, and have not found time to type my thoughts (what with the “Jackie Brown” imbroglio and all).  Anyway, I wanted to say that it  is  discrimination in the workplace when you treat someone differently because of their marital/parental status.  I was talking to Hal about it, and these are my thoughts:  Being married (in and of itself) should not make a difference in how people are treated at work.  However, I feel I am treated differently (better) at work because I am married.  I think people take married folks more seriously, and I think our society tends to root for “families” (read married people).    People with kids are torn.  You usually have to leave by a set time (I get away with it because Mrs. Duf is extraordinarily supportive and has a job where she is done every day at the same time) and be with your youngins.  Here’s what’s different.  Everyone knows you have a child, and everyone knows it means that sometimes you will not be able to stay late or take that trip.  I should note that there is an expectation that fathers will have work as a slightly higher priority than home and will still go the extra mile.  The “bread-winner” expectation is still there.  I feel it a lot a work (a lot of folks I work with are childless – we have an amazingly, disproportionately high number of DINKs here).  When I take a half day because my daughter is sick, I don't expect anyone to take up my slack, but I do feel that some folks wonder why Mrs. Duf isn't doing it instead of me.  Single people without kids have a tougher time because people at work tend to assume that they have nothing else to do except burn the midnight oil.  That is a yucky assumption.   When I read your piece Panda, I was thinking about my situation at work.  There are two people who have my job title.  Me (married for 3 years with 1 child) and my counterpart (married for 25 years, 2 kids are grown and out of the house).  The easy assumption is that my counterpart can come in whenever she wants and leave whenever she wants.  I stroll in around nine (hey, Hal set the standard) and people know it is because I have to get my daughter up and dressed and to daycare (much more time consuming than you would think – I wake everyday at 6:00 and I can’t get to work until 9:00 when all is said and done).  But her life is still full of obligations.  She moved to a new house, she broke her foot, and she has a sister up north in the middle of an awesome battle against cancer.  My whole point:  we need to move to place where we don’t consider marital status (or parental status) in the workplace.  We should not assume that because someone is single and childless that work is the only thing that have to do.     Surprise ending:  Panda and I are in AGREEMENT!

       Is It Me?  By Duf "You Sniff It Like Coke" Fer  Is it me or have the number of spam e-mails on oxycontin and vicodin gone way up since Rush made them the "in" drugs?  [closed circuit to Panda:  Hal and I were in Dallas/Fort Worth, and the Hilton checked me into a room that was already occupied.  When I opened the door an authoritative woman yelled "WHO IS IT?" and I nearly wet myself.  You see, a black man breaking into hotel rooms in Texas...yep, that's grounds for being shot dead - no Dallas jury would have convicted her.  Anyway, at the Hilton, your reward when that happens is that you get a free movie.  My protest that it was 1:00 in the morning (hello, business traveler?  might have a meeting in the a.m....hello?) and that I was not likely to watch a movie so late fell on deaf ears.]

       At the End of my Tether   I told myself I was no longer going to be negative about traveling, my job, etc...but this story is so "last straw", it would be crazy not to share it.  I checked into a Marriott hotel last night.  I was exhausted so I went right to bed.  At 3:00am, somebody came into my room.  Let me repeat that:  somebody used a keycard and walked right into my room .  I shot out of bed (in a total state of fear and confusion) and yelled "Um, HELLO!"  I then heard a woman's voice - "Somebody's already in there!" - and she closed the door.  Baffled, I immediately called the front desk.  "I think you just checked someone into  my room !  What the hell is wrong with you?"  "We're sorry ma'am.  They should be coming down right now and we'll take care of the situation."  The 'SITUATION'??  Someone was in my room!  That is the biggest mistake a hotel could make!    I couldn't sleep for a while, but eventually fell back asleep around 4.  The phone rang an hour later.  I thought it was my wake-up call, so I picked it up and then hung it up.  The phone rang again.  This time I put the receiver to my ear. "Um, we weren't sure if your wake-up call was at 5 or 6."  "Actually, it was at  6:30  so you're wrong all the way around.  Please don't tell me it's 5am right now."  "Ah, ma'am.  It's 5am."  Because I had been woken out of a deep sleep, I was a bit irrational.  "YOU PEOPLE ARE ALL COMPLETELY RETARDED!" *click*  Needless to say, my sleep last night was not good.  I stormed to the front desk this morning and told the manager on duty what had happened.  He gave me no recovery statement like "Oh, we're so sorry - here's a free weekend coupon."  All he said?  "I'll check into it."  What the hell is there to check into??  Those are the facts - you think I'd make this up?  What I can be thankful for: the person who came in my room was a sober woman.  A drunk man would have been even more scary.  Also, it could have been worse if they checked the person in at say, 10pm, and I wasn't even in the room, but all my stuff was.  But maybe I shouldn't be so hard on the Marriott.  Perhaps they have a new policy when they're oversold: pairing random strangers up for the night??

       Put me in the corner for Jackie Brown.     I don't remember too much (it's been some years), but what I remember most is that I had not heard good things about it, and I almost didn't see it.  Then when I saw it I couldn't believe that it wasn't getting great word-of-mouth.  Anyway... I can't believe there is all this talk of QT, and no mention of his guest spot on the first season of "Alias"!  The man is a poor actor who should stick behind the camera (aside from his cameo in "Pulp Fiction", which was one of the best director's cameos of all time, though I admit that's not saying much).  But he was more than good as a man out for revenge, a bad-guy after a worse bad-guy on "Alias".

       I Love DJS  By Duf Fer  One of my main criticisms of American movies (hold on, I have to adjust my beret, it was about to slide off my big head) is that they feel the need to jam every moment with action. There has to be a kick, an explosion, a boob, a fantastic line, a  something  in every minute or the audience might become bored and go to the multi-million dollar action extravaganza instead.  “Jackie Brown” from one of our more explosive action directors, gives proof of Tarantino’s versatility.  The opening moment, with Jackie on the moving walkway, I loved for three reasons (and we part company here, so there really isn’t much point is going too much further):  1.  It sets up a very deliberate pace that Tarantino carries through the entire film (including the scene at the department store where pace is everything).  2.  It compels you to sympathize with this middle-aged black woman who works for a crap airline and makes a crap wage and has to hustle to make the rents.  In the same opening, when she starts to run so that she won’t be late for work, I thought, man, when I’m in my late 40’s, I pray to God I’m not a clock puncher who had to run to avoid being late for work.  3.  It pays homage (oh Tarantino and the homage) to all the Blaxploitation films that gave Pam Grier her fame.    4.  Okay, one more thing, the song in the background, Bobby Womack’s “Across 110th Street,” that’s the jam right there, son.  That’s the jam.  Also, the words are trying to tell you something.  I could go on and on about Jackie Brown, but I won’t.  Suffice it to say that of his movies, it is by far the most  believable  to me.  I believe there are people like Jackie just trying to survive in Bush’s America (oops, sorry for the slip…my beret got in my eyes while I was typing).  And Pam Grier, in my view, was absolutely dogged by the awards.  Her performance was off the hook (so was Robert Forster’s).  I think that when the pace is a bit slower, it is easier to appreciate the acting, and this film is about controlled pace and controlled acting, both of which were handled extremely well by experts.     Like a brother,  Duf

       Color Me Slayed.   Yeah, reasonable minds can definitely disagree...but be reasonable!  'Jackie Brown?'  Better than 'Reservoir Dogs?'  I don't quite know how to stomach that.  I feel as though someone wound up and punched me in the gut with everything they had.  Whoa.  I'll ask you what I ask a lot of people that enjoyed movies that I just can't stand:  What  did  you like about it?     If I may, I'll present a laundry list of problems with the movie (and please remember that I only saw it once.  one times too many)  - Length: Wasn't it like 3 hours long?  Why? Get an editor! - Characters: Not a single character that I liked, not even remotely. - Premise: I must've missed it.  Was there one? - Pam Grier: Yes, she's an icon to some.  Do we really need to see a static shot of her face on a motorized walkway for 15 minutes?  For my buck, 'Reservoir Dogs' is still Quentin's best film.  It's the building block on which almost all of his other work has been built.  Dogs totally redifined the way movies are shot, stories are told, and how what you don't see is as important as what you do.  Besides, (and not that this is a selling point) do you remember any really quotable lines from Jackie Brown?  I could go on for days with classic lines from RD.  But I won't.  If I were to list the QT scale, it'd go a little something like this:  1. Reservoir Dogs 2. True Romance 3. Pulp Fiction 4. Kill Bill Vol. 1 5. From Dusk Til Dawn 6. Four Rooms (at least his 'room') 7. Natural Born Killers 26. Jackie Brown  (I've left space between the mostly rotten Natural Born Killers and Jackie Brown for any Broadway plays, infomercials, or home movies that he might release between now and then.)   Diff'rent strokes for different, etc...

       Huh?  by Duf Fer  I like Quentin Tarantino.  I like him quite a lot.  He is creative and hip and has a style all his own (okay, a penchant for homage all his own).  I have not seen 'Kill Bill Vol. 1', and if current babysitter trends hold, I will have to wait until video.  At any rate, I must comment in response to my boy DJS who describes 'Jackie Brown' as an atrocity.  Huh?  I did not read the Elmore Leonard book, but I loved 'Jackie Brown'.  That's cool, reasonable minds can disagree.  The main thing is, if you are going to pick examples of QT films that are atrocities, you pick 'Four Rooms,' you pick 'From Dusk 'til Dawn,' (so what if he didn't direct it) but you don't pick 'Jackie Brown.'    Here comes the slayer:  'Jackie Brown' is a better movie than 'Reservoir Dogs."  Here, I'll illustrate it...  Here's QT's top three (in order - and I haven't seen Kill Bill Vol. 1):  Pulp Fiction Jackie Brown Reservoir Dogs  Yours,   Duf

       William   HAL & Co.,  I saw 'Kill Billiam' on Saturday.  It's easily one of the most violent movies I've seen in a long, long time.  And I loved it!  It's nice to see him do something actually watchable after that atrocity 'Jackie Brown' where he took all of the good parts of a mediocre Elmore Leonard book and threw them out to film the rest of the garbage.  'Kill Bill' was frantic, fun and loaded with such over-the-top action and killings that I found myself laughing harder than the morons in the theatre who were snorting over the 'Scary Movie 3' trailer.     (Side note: If you see me at a theatre and I'm holding a ticket stub for 'Scary Movie 3' go right ahead and plug a gun into my eye and squeeze, baby, squeeze.  I'd rather watch a buffalo shit.)   Back to 'Bill.'  If you don't mind countless slayings, spurting stumps, Lucy Lui (yes, delicious) and fakey comic book style action, than you really owe it to yourself to see this movie.  Is it the best movie of the year?  No.  So far 28 Days Later has that honor (until Return of the King hits).  Is it Oscar calibur?  No.  God, no.  But it's a lot of fun.

       I Watch Movies to Escape   I love the feeling I get when I bring home rented movies (usually 4 at a time).  When the MGM Lion pops up on the screen, it's as if nothing can go wrong (for at least the next 2 hours or so).  I block out everything - phone calls, e-mails, loud neighbors - to watch a story unfold.  Here's what I got lost in this weekend:   urlLink The Dangerous Life of Altar Boys : Kieran Culkin strikes again, this time as an angry 14-year-old in a story about growing up under the oppressive authority of the Catholic church in the 1970's.  There are animated sequences that interrupt the flow, but I loved the realism of the rest of the movie - not sugar coated at all.  Jodie Foster as a one-legged nun?  Priceless.   urlLink Comedian :  This is a documentary about passion.  Jerry Seinfeld and the other comedians featured in this film adore what they do - including the blood, sweat, and tears behind it all.  Seinfeld has surely followed his bliss.   urlLink The Smokers : A dark comedy about a group of girls who enact revenge on the boys who mistreated them.  My bottom line reaction to this film: garbage.  But I love Oliver Hudson (the hottie who played Joey's boyfriend in  Dawson's  and the brother of Kate Hudson), so that saved it for me.  That, and I could somehow relate to  urlLink Busy Phillips'  character.   urlLink Tuesdays With Morrie : Initially I picked this up and laughed.  A movie based on an Oprah Book Club book?  No way could I watch this.  But at my independent video store I get "rent one, get one free," so this was my freebie.  And surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.  And I cried my eyes out.  At one point, Morrie quoted the poet Auden, "Love each other or perish." He also asked these 4 questions:  Have you found someone to share your heart with?  Are you giving to your community?  Are you at peace with yourself?  Are you trying to be as human as you can be?    This will probably be my last post for a while.  Be good, kiddos.

       A Different Kind of Discrimination   While I was in training this week, I overheard one of my coworkers talking about traveling for a former job. "I had to go to Florida for 2 weeks a month and then I would come home for 2 weeks.  And this lasted THREE MONTHS!"  I leaned over to him and half-jokingly said, "Hey, R-man, try that schedule for  three years ."  His reply?  "Oh, Panda.  It's no big deal for you.  I mean, it's not like you are married or have kids like I do."  Hold it right there, bud.  Just because I'm  single  means I don't have the right to have a normal life?  Why? Because there couldn't  possibly  be anyone who cares about me or needs me back home?  And on a side note, perhaps I'm single  because  I'm on the road  all the fucking time .  Single people are forced into staying later at work. (“I gotta get my kid from daycare – have fun staying until midnight to finish that PowerPoint presentation!”) Single people don't get to stay home because the nanny called in sick.  Single people supposedly have no reason to take advantage of the benefit of "working from home."  Single women get ogled and asked out at work (I’m hoping that’s just the pervs I work with).     closed circuit to Duf: of course these are generalities - you'd stay late at the office if needed.  Don’t hate.

       Wicked Awesome  By Duf "TV" Fer  Last night, I was (like all God-fearing Americans) watching baseball on the telly when Mrs. Duf interrupted me with an urgent request - "go get groceries."     Editor's Note:  Mrs. Duf was NOT watching baseball and is irretrievably communistic and atheistic.   I said "no problem, I'll go after the game."  Said she "no, go now.  I need you to go to Whole Foods for the 100% vitamin C applesauce and they close at 10:00."     Editor's Note:  no, I'm not kidding.   I thought "but it's the middle of the game, and the Sox are leading!" I also thought about the nature of communism and how it has been exposed as a failed philosophy and governmental system.  I concluded that socialism is really the best route, though it should be tested in less homogenous nations.  Can it thrive in a former capitalistic nation where income hierarchies have become accepted?  I considered cutting my toenails; they are a bit long.  I also thought about Nomar Garciaparra's pre-hit routine.  Boy is it bizarre.  But what I said was "no problem honey.  I love you.  You are the hydrogen to my oxygen.  Together we support an entire undersea world and form an essential ingredient for life.  Without you, I am incomplete.  You are the wind beneath my wings, and I never want to let you down.  I want our love to be a beacon in the night shining as an example of love and devotion for all the world.  And can I have a  treat  when I get back?"  She said "no.  But you can put the groceries and dishes away."    Ah...wedded bliss.  Solution:  I took my mini portable TV (you know the ones with the 2 inch screen, right?) and watched the game while I shopped.    My Whole Foods fellow shoppers all stared at me and I responded by asking "how can you judge me?  I'm only driving the Subaru Outback while I save up for a Volvo!!!  Give me a break!!!".    One guy asked me for a score update.  I told him that the Sox just hit a home run to make is 5 to 0, and we watched the replay together.    Only in America.  Go Red Sox! Go Cubbies!  Then go Red Sox in the World Series!  (Sorry Panda...I know we will find common ground some day!)

      First off, this is not the forum I wish to debate in, nor do I wish to debate at all.  I was merely discussing a different perspective - not claiming it as "the ultimate truth", but as something different from what the media tells us.  It's a good idea to get information from all sources - CNN, Fox News, NY Times, or one marine - and my point was that too many people take a biased look at something without seeing both sides.  For instance,  urlLink this  is something interesting I've read recently.  Another media source that should not to be taken as the end-all-be-all, but to be read with a grain of salt.  Politics, violence in society, and foreign policy is not my forte, and I'm not going to pretend I know everything about such matters.  So I won't.

<date>07,October,2003</date>
<post>

     
      Setting aside for a moment how reluctant I am to accept the word of one marine as gospel truth.  And also neglecting a conversation we could have about media as a tool of propaganda (and guess who wields the tool), let me respectfully and cordially disagree.  Saddam's regime was oppressive and criminal.  There is international (and overwhelming) consensus around that point.  Iraq is well rid of him.  Again, everyone agrees.    This is where the disagreement begins.  Some argue, myself among them, that our justifications for the war were dishonest.    First, if Saddam's oppressiveness is our justification for war in Iraq, two thoughts come to mind.  First, now that he is out of power, why don't we leave?  Second, it's time to start attacking (pre-emptively) all those other countries suffering under fascists.  There are unspeakable tragedies taking place all over the world.  And on the despot depth chart, Saddam wouldn't even be on the JV team.    Second, there is no link between Iraq and Al Queda.  If that was our justification for war, we would be in Saudi Arabia right now.  The link between Saudia Arabia and Al Queda is much more clear and much stronger.  Third, there are (as yet) no found Weapons of Mass Destruction.  After initially discovering them in 1991, we eradicated them and were able to contain Saddam for years.  We pretty much knew he did not have WMD, and that if he did, he had no vehicle to deliver them, which brings me to my next point...  Fourth, there is no evidence that Iraq was (as we were told or "manipulated into thinking") a direct threat to the United States.  I don't even think an argument could be made that they were a credible threat to Israel. (Some argue that Dr. Paul Wolfowitz and the other neo-cons were really interested in stability in the region and in protecting Israel).  At any rate, as a result, the whole justfication for the war was (at minimum) ill founded and (more likely) fabricated.  If I had a child in the military serving in Iraq, my outcry would be deafening.  I'm all for military service but I can never support the use of our fighting men and women for any cause that is not well founded.  This cause is not well founded.   The reason our soldiers are still being shot  may  have to do with a fanatical minority that hates us, when (perhaps) a majority loves us.  To me, though, it is more likely that now that the despot has fallen, Iraqis want us to get the heck out of there so that they can go about the business of true self rule.  Isn't that another part of our justification for going - to restore Iraq to self rule?  I believe that a lot of Iraqis feel we don't belong there.  They are right, and, to tell the truth, we never did.  They know that our motives are impure.  The whole world knows our motives are impure.  Americans who read the paper know our motives are impure.  And international challenges to prove otherwise have been unanswered by our current administration.   Last, to reply to your side note.  Asking why the poor in this country shoot each other is fine, but we must also ask, more generally, why Americans shoot each other.  There is a lot of violence in our poor communities (I say it is linked to a cycle of violence, a lack of meaningful opportunity, economic injustice, crime, drugs, human frailty, easy access to guns, a culture obsessed with guns, poor leadership and rap music - it's the type of problem it would take about $87,000,000,000 to fix), but there is also a lot of violence in American in general.  Why did Columbine happen?  Why did that one guy shoot his pregnant wife then try to escape to Mexico?  Why did that kid bring a gun to school in Minnesota and kill a classmate and severly wound another?  What explains the snipers?    The way I see it, violence is no longer the exclusive province of the poor. We are a violent people.  Our continued support of the death penalty, our unjust and unjustified pre-emptive strike againt Iraq, our passion for violent games and movies and sports and music, our tendency to shoot each other, it all proves the same point.

      My marine friend went home to home while he was in Iraq as a "community service" and got a good idea of the Iraqi view towards America(ns): 30% are very pro-American (these people threw down their best rugs when he visited their homes), about 65% are indifferent, while only about 5% of the Iraqis are very against us being there.  These 5% are mostly the poorer citizens, the ones who are hopeless...these also include non-Iraqis - people who cross the border from Syria and other countries.  It's unfortunate that we are manipulated by our leaders and our media in thinking an entire country(s) hates us.  Even though it's a small percentage of people who disagree with us being there, since hate is so powerful, it may seem like more?  I don't have the answer.  But I do have a question: Why do the poor in  this  country shoot each other?  (rhetorical question, most likely)

       A Different Perspective   I'm in NY this week and went out with some friends a couple nights ago.  Among these people was a "friend of a friend" who I really enjoyed talking to.  He was visiting NY and on a vacation from his MBA program in California.  When I asked him how he got the time off, he said he was taking a semester off and was on leave from the Marines.  He had just returned from Iraq.  I didn't ask a lot of questions since I was sure he was inundated every day with the inane opinions of people who were never there, could never understand, and everything they knew about the situation they got from the 10:00 news.  So I just said, "that must have been an indescribable experience."  I asked him to give me the statement he gave to anyone who asked "how it was".  "What I found out, more than anything, was how lucky we are to live in the United States.  The media has been misleading.  The Iraqis cheered for us in each town we went through.  They are supportive of our help and a chance for freedom."

       Beware Freaks Bearing Gifts  By Depressed Duf'  It never ceases to amaze me how those who trumpet patriotism with words are also those who debase it most with their actions.    In Washington, some Senior White House official has ratted out a spy.  This is counter-espionage.  This is treason.  This is the opposite of "united we stand."  The USA Patriotism Act is an assualt on personal freedom and the bill of rights that would make Mussolini blush.    In California, a long standing tradition of respecting the voice of the people was ended by a recall of a Governor (unpopular though he was) who had committed no crime or malfeasance of any kind.  Last night, farce concluded the tragedy; vox populi became pox populi.  May we get the elected officials we deserve.  My favorite piece though is that while states all over America are rushing to make students recite the pledge of allegiance, our transition team in Iraq is working to remove dogma and patriotism from the schools there.  Apparently, in Iraq, style over substance is disfavored, and a return to educating children means decreasing time devoted to anything except the three R's.  I like the pledge of allegiance.  I don't think anyone should be forced to say it (that pesky first amendment and all), but the pledge, in and of itself will do little to make children understand or love America.  For that, I think we should favor more substantive things.  Of course, it would mean a shift away from words and toward action.

       You'd think I'd have an inferiority complex...    1. What vehicle do you drive?   I don't.  I don't have a car.  How do I get around?  Bus, subway, cab, train, and airplane.  Don't hate.   2. How long have you had it?   I  haven't  had a car for almost 3 years.  Some of the best years of my life.  No worries, no payments, and I never have to be the designated driver.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   What's cool about the bus - sometimes you get crazy drivers who won't let  anyone  get in their way.  Near-death experiences are a great way to start the day.   I like cabs because cabbies always have NPR on, they know the quickest ways around the city and to the airport, and they tell you interesting stories about why they came to America.  Trains are great - esp the Amtrak to Milwaukee.  Everytime I go to M-city I see the same guy who hands out snacks and tells us when we've crossed over into "America's Dairyland." He sometimes gives me a free Heineken.  I hate planes.  Nothing cool about them at all.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   You get the crazies on the bus.  Once I saw a homeless lady throw-down on a business man because he tried to sit next to her.  Funniest shit ever.  (He wasn't hurt, the cops came on and threw her off.)  Sometimes cabs can really reek.  Bad.  Either with BO or about 10 of those hanging vanilla tree things.  I don't know who told these guys quantity was better than quality.     5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   One of the biggest things I'm looking forward to when I move to the Twin Cities is owning a car again.  One of the biggest things I'm  not  looking forward to when I move to the Twin Cities is owning a car again.  But I know I'll have to get one.  It's a car town.    I'm going to change this question a bit and tell you the car I would buy if the  weather  was no object.  (I'm talking about horrible, Midwestern, snowy weather.)  I would get a  urlLink Mini Cooper .  Sure, it might make me look like an clown, but it would be fun as hell.   Let's motor.

       Start Yer Engines, Yo.     1. What vehicle do you drive?   2002 Nissan Xterra, black.   2. How long have you had it?   1 year plus a month or two.    3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   It's corny, but I love that dumb little first aid kit hanging in the rear door.  I also like that it's one of the only SUV's still built on a truck frame.  Where most SUV's (Explorer, Navigator, Escalade) look like a fat woman on wheels, my lil' truck stayed true to the game.  Yes, yes, y'all.  Oh, I also like that it's got like 5 A/C adapter thingy in it.  I can charge my cell phone, hook up a TV, inflate an air matress, and use one of those big spotlight things at the same time.  Shit, I still have an extra one I could use to cook up some breakfast.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   Because it's black, it almost always looks like it's filthy.  Minor complaint, though.  I still like the color more than any other.    5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   Honestly?  For once, I've got the only car I'll ever want.  Keep your Affiniti, your shit Cadillacs, Lincolns, etc.  I don't ever want a luxury car (or truck) and I don't ever think I'll get a truck bigger than what I'm driving now.  I guess after cursing out assholes in the really nice cars for so long, I wouldn't ever want to be in legion with them.  Besides, in my world, I've had plenty of shitty, shitty, cars and my Xterra is like a luxury vehicle to me...in comparison.

What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   It's priced less than my other car payment(s). and I absolutely LOVE my sunroof..."wave your hands in the air and wave 'em like you just don't care"   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   The CD player skips when I hit a bump in the road. I miss my six-disc, sub-woofered system of my SUV, but let's not reminisce here, BB...*single tear rolls down cheek*   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   red, convertible luxury sports car - phat stereo, suped engine and a massager built into the seats. awe yeah. (I testify that I have never watched "The Fast and the Furious" nor "2Fast 2Furious" but HAL can fill you in that they are worthwhile cinema fare.)

But the great part is that I just don’t care about it – bring on the hail, door dings, and muddy feet.   2. How long have you had it?  Close to 4.5 years.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?  Keyless entry (great when you have groceries), HOWEVER, I don’t like the “beep” sound it makes.  When I go to lock it or unlock it, I feel like all those around me are asking why I’m engaging (or disengaging) a security alarm on a 5 year old crap car.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?  See above.  Plus, the breaks are currently squeaking.  Grrr.   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?  No object?  Probably a tricked out Saab.  I know, I’m pretty predictable.  And I’d go with a color – Black is played out for me.

       I Like the Five and Hope You Will Too  Duf "Wheels" Fer   1. What vehicle do you drive?  I have a 1999 Subaru Outback (don't hate).  Incidentally, no, I'm not a lesbian.   2. How long have you had it?  Almost one year.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?  It's a three way tie.  I like the stereo (CD changer and sub-woofer - playaz only, y'all), I like the heated wiper blades, and I LOVE the heated seats.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?  My power antenna is broken, and I know it is going to cost $100 bucks to fix it.   5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?  I would get either a brand new Toyota Prius, or an electric car. I also like vintage automobiles, and would love to have an old MG and an old VW microbus.

       Now I Know Why They Call It a Bronx Cheer  By Duf Fer  I went to the Yankees and Twins games in New York on Tuesday.  I had a wonderful time.  Yankee Stadium is really cool and the fans are off the hook.  I can't tell you how many times people dropped F bombs.  When Hideki Matsui (from Japan) came up to bat, a drunk kid from the Bronx who was sitting right behind me yelled:  "hit the ball you slanty-eyed bastard!"  Of course, best of all, the Twins won.  Now if only the Red Sox would have won...

       New Digs  My new place is great, thanks for asking HAL! I've got plenty of space and it feels really cozy too.  I even have enough room for my never-ending supply of tolietries. Note to anyone who might consider giving me a gift of any kind at any time in the future: Please no lotions, bubble baths, makeup, medicines (except for the alcoholic beverage variety) or nail care supplies. I hate to put conditions on gifts, but I just physically can't take anymore.   My roommates are throwing a Halloween party the weekend prior to Halloween. All Pandylandahz are invited to attend and trash the great new digs. :)

       "No foolin', the Jayhawks are great" and the band's not bad either.  By Duf Fer  I love the Kansas Jayhawks and the band the Jayhawks.  Count me in it to win it.  Saturday night is the ticket; I'll bring the Night Train.

       Duf is Not a Loser  and  PBJ   Duf, once you've tried the relaxation technique, I think you'll agree that it's one of the more powerful relaxation techniques out there and should be utilized by more than just the smug-marrieds. That would be cruel and unusual punishment for us stressed-out singletons. And we all know that stress causes an unhealthy demeanor which in turn can lead to an uptight, crabby, possibly violent society. We wouldn't want to do that to society now, would we?   I'm down with PBJ with the Jayhawks too. I vote for Saturday as well, but could do the other dates if consensus dictates.

       PBJ - "A Sort of Homecoming"  and  Let's Do Some Math   Hal, that's very kind of you to suggest.  No foolin', the Jayhawks are great, and a super way to celebrate.  I vote for Saturday, but could probably make the other dates work too.    Now, on to an interesting math problem:  I just shredded every single one of my travel expense reports.  There were 81 total.  On average, for each report, I was in NYC for 4 days.  That's 324 days total.  I have worked here for 32 months or approximately 960 very long days.  Therefore, I was in NY roughly every 3 days.  What did that get me?  207,811 frequent flier miles, 119,108 Marriott Rewards Points (I caught on to the whole hotel point thing a little late...plus, I used some with Hal), 8 free upgrades to 1st class, 1 free flight coupon, 1 free hotel night coupon, and 3 free drink coupons.  Now if I could just get a few weeks of vacation to use all this, that would be great.

       Reflections on My Misspent Youth  By Duf "Doh" Fer  Hal explained the whole uuuzzzzzsssshhhhhhh thing to me.  Man, I feel like I wasted my entire college career.  And all along I thought that when my roommate but a sock on the doorknob, he was folding laundry with his girlfriend and didn't want me to see any of her essentials.    Now I know why college girls always asked me to relax with them and then said I was "sweet" and "such a gentelman" when I didn't understand what they were saying.  Man, I'm such a loser.    Planning to try BB's relaxation technique... Duf

       Catching Up   First thing - hats off to DJS... it's not easy to gulp down your pride.  Glad you got a payoff for your efforts.  Secondly, Panda is headed back to Pandyland central (a.k.a. "The Tundra") and we haven't locked down the celebration?  What is our collective problem?  I propose we incorporate one of the Jayhawks shows at First Avenue (December 19, 20, & 21) into said celebration.  Who's with me?!!?!?  Thirdly, Duf, let's talk.  I have a great multi-media presentation that explains the whole thing.  It incorporates dollar signs, lights, and a cross.  Once we've met it will all be clear.

       I Guess I'm Really Confused  By Duf "Little Naive" Fer  I'm confused.  I originally thought that uuuuuuhhhhzzzzzzsssshhhhhh stood for, well, you know..."doin' it."    But then BB said she likes to uuuhhhzzzhhh to relax, and that can't be right, because, well...she's not married.    I mean it's no big deal, but I guess I'm a little confused.    Can someone explain it to me?  Thanks,  Duf

       Uuuuuhhhzzzzzzsssshhhh   Oh, too funny.  I don't know what it is, but seeing someone else use that goofy phrase 'Uuuuuuzzzzzsssshhh' just cracks me up.  It's just slays me to see it used in someone else's blog entry or hearing someone else say it.  I know, I'm weird.  Ever curious where it came from?  I'll tell you.  Whenever Dirty Abbott and I go to see a movie and there's the slightest hint that there's going to be some 'hot romance' I used to mutter under my breath 'Uuuuzzzssshh, uuuzzzsssh' which in my head is the sound of delicious sex.  Of course, we thought it was hilarious, but not all movies had 'sensual scenes' so we had to make do with anything remotely romantic (i.e. a passionate kiss, someone takes off a jacket, etc.)  Pretty soon we were saying 'uuuuzzzzshhh' anytime someone looked at each other.  It was our way of predicting what the people in the movies were  really  thinking.  Yes, I know.  I'm 31 years old, but I act like I'm 12.  Deal with it.

      Before I continue, let me summarize my "resignation day" from this shitty job:  *ring* [my boss calls, first thing Monday morning]   Me : Hi,  Worst Boss Ever . [This I would say in my dream world.] What's up? [This is what I really said.]  WBE : I'm calling to talk to you about a "few things."  Me : OK  WBE : I didn't like how you handled things on Friday.  It's OK that you left early, but I'd like more warning in the future.  Plus, unless it was a medical emergency, according to policy, you are not allowed to use Personal Days as Vacation Days.  Oh, and the client wasn't happy you didn't call her back.  [Side Note: could it be impossible for me to take 4 hours off to visit my sick, dying mother...or to get tests run for a terminal illness...or to fly to Guatemala to save some starving children?  He doesn't know me or my gig.  What a pretentious asshole.]   Me : Well, I apologize if I inconvenienced you.  But to set the record straight, I did get back to the client and answered her question.    WBE : Well, just don't let it happen again.  Me : Sure, whatever.  Hey, I was going to call you later, but now that I have you on the phone, do you have a couple minutes to chat?  WBE : Yes.  Me : I wanted to offer you my resignation.  My last day will be December 3rd.  WBE : [Silence.]  Oh, OK.  And.... scene !  As my coworker Rob said it: "He attacked you with a squirt gun, and you came right back at him with a bazooka."  Paybacks are a bitch, friends.  By the way, I was nice enough to go to NYC yesterday to tie up any loose ends.  WBE wasn't there.  Too bad, since I was so ready to tell him he can suck my left tit.   1. List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year.   Finalize a move date. Finalize a New Year's date. (need someone to kiss at midnight, folks.) Finalize a car purchase. Finalize a start date at my new job. Finish the Frank Lloyd Wright cross-stich I've been working on for my mom for Christmas.  Don't hate; I'm crafty.   2. List five people you've lost contact with that you'd like to hear from again.   I agree with Duf, kinda dumb question...  Colleen Shealer (high school friend) Mary Oksas (friend from Holy Name Cathedral choir who had a baby and dropped off the face of the earth) Stoner (now that she doesn't visit PL, I never hear what's happenin'; but did you know she's ENGAGED?)  I can't think of anyone else...I make it a point to stay in touch with the peeps.  It takes effort, and I'm sure I bug people, but someone's gotta make the contact, you know?  From his post below, I'm sure DJS knows what I'm sayin'.   3. List five things you'd like to learn how to do.   Be more patient.  Sew my own clothes. Keep my mouth shut when appropriate. Cure cancer. Put on makeup without looking like a hooker.   4. List five things you'd do if you won the lottery (no limit).   1) Start a charity that brings orphaned children from 3rd world countries (and eastern Europe and Siberia - where my cousins are from) to the US to connect with families who can't have children, and can't afford to travel and pay the fees to adopt them.  2) Have my own limo driver (it would be my Polish driver Jerry from NY).  Because I'll be very busy spending all my money, he must drive fast without causing harm to other drivers and/or getting a ticket.  3) Give money to my friends who hate their jobs so they can quit and travel around the world with me in my private jet.  4) Buy a different cashmere sweater for every day it is cold.  Cozy  and  stylish!  5) Throw lavish parties for every season for all my friends and family.  And invite U2 to play at each one.   5. List five things you do that help you relax.   Yoga [breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth]. Walking around my neighborhood with no particular place to go. Cleaning while listening to music. Eating mac & cheese while watching a rented movie. Reading a smutty magazine. (i.e. US Weekly, Glamour, or Marie Claire)

       Hot Amends   Well, I bit the bullet earlier this week.  Some of y'all (Duf, HAL) might remember the falling out that I had with some of my oldest friends over a year and a half ago.  I said some things, they read some things, I wasn't feeling them, they weren't feeling me and it turned into a real big stinky war.  We shut down all lines o' communications and decided 'F it' we're better off not being friends anymore.  On Monday, I decided enough was enough.  I wrote an e-mail to some of my estranged friends and basically apologized for my end of things.  I was stupid, confused, and just wasn't thinking.  I spoke about how much it sucked to have to amend every conversation about my past with 'Well, these guys I used to be friends with...'  It was tough.  I sent the e-mail, not knowing if I'd be scorned, responded to or just plain ignored.  I got a response.  Then another.  Bottom line?  I met up with one of my old best friends last night at Bennigan's.  Wasn't sure what to expect, but he greeted me with a hug and we shot the shit for 4 hours last night, which I'm sure pissed the waitress off.  I'm not saying things are going to be the way they used to, but it's a start.  Quite honestly?  I feel like a weight I've been carrying around for 1.5 years has been lifted.  It's a good feeling.

       School of Rock, Reviewed  By Duf Fer  As faithful readers know, Duf went to the premiere of School of Rock yesterday.  Oh, everyone was there, Jack Black, Lisa Marie Presley, Governor Arnold, everybody.  Okay, that's a lie.  I did see the movie though.  Here's the deal.  I am a Jack Black fan.  He has made some poor movies ("Shallow Hal" and "Saving Silverman" come to mind), but he has been in some gems too ("Orange County" is a certified Duf platinum, and I also loved him in "High Fidelity").    JB is a master of physical comedy.  His body control, his numerous facial expressions, his eyebrows - he's got it all.  Like some of the best plus-sized comedians like John Belushi and Chris Farley, one of his best assets is his ability to use his (non-Chippendales) body without shame.  As the rap impresarios Fat Boys sang "yeah, I'm overweight."    I liked "The School of Rock," but I did not love it.  I laughed out loud on numerous occassions, and I'm glad I went.  It was entertaining in the tradition of the best escapist movies:  a perfect afternoon retreat.  Still, I will be surprised if I remember much about it next week.  The problem with the movie is that beyond Jack Black (and a few Joan Cusack moments), there really is nothing else.  The kids don't stand out.  The other teachers don't stand out.  The parents don't stand out.  The roommate doesn't stand out.  The plot doesn't stand out.  It is all Jack.  Though I can see him carrying a movie most of the way, he needs some help, and he didn't get much here.    When I think of my favorite comedy films, they work because there are so many characters and characatures.  Like Caddyshack where there are just a zillion zany characters.  I would have loved "The School of Rock" instead of just liking it if the other characters were...well...characters.    Best line (Joan Cusack):  "Okay, I have an update:  all of your children are missing."    Second best line (Jack Black): "I'm pretty sure I've touched your kids, and I know they've all touched me."

       It's a Boy!   Last night my sis-in-law gave birth to a healthy baby boy.  No name yet, which I see as a good call considering there was an emergency c-section involved.  In addition to being in labor for close to 24 hours, she’d been induced, then sedated, then operated on.  I’d like to see what name I came up with under similar circumstances.    My parents and I brought the new baby’s siblings to the hospital around 10.  The oldest (a 10 year old girl), was granted the honor of holding the new baby in the rocking chair first.  She was so proud, and I could see she was relieved.  When we were driving to the hospital I told her that her mom was having an operation to have the baby (to explain why we were going to the hospital before the baby was born).  “Just like Aunt so-and-so did when she had so-and-so??” she asked.  “Yes” I told her.  “Oh” my niece replied, “does this mean that the baby cannot be still-born, like they sometimes are when they come out the normal way?”  Uggh.  My 8-year-old nephew did not have so much interest in the actual baby so much as interest in the fact that the baby was a boy.  “Yeahhhh!!” he jumped up and down when his dad told him that mom had had a boy.  I asked him what he was going to teach his little brother and he replied, “how to build stuff”.  The best reaction came from the now-displaced baby of the family, my 2½ year old niece.  I lifted her up to the window and pointed to the newborn on the other side of the glass.  “Sweetie, look at your new brother!  Isn’t he beautiful?”  She in turn pointed to a cartoon decal on the corner of the window (not in the region of the baby) and screamed, “IT’S TIGGER!!!!!”  Denial, apparently, is not beyond toddlers.   After a few minutes of Tigger admiration, a nurse came to the group and said, “Big brothers and sisters are allowed to come and see their little brothers now!” and the two oldest ran into the nursery room.  Then dad picked up the toddler and brought her into the nursery with him.  I gathered with the grandparents and watched behind the glass as dad and kids got a closer look at the new addition.  Our attention was taken away from the child in the crib as we watched the face of the child in dad’s arms.  As she looked down (Tigger was now out of sight lines), the unmistakable expression of confusion, leading to realization, and ending in “oh, shit” passed across the kid’s face.  And I swear to God I saw I saw her little fist clench.    To prove that she is truly shameless, later on the little one came out from visiting her mom and corralled her grandparents by lifting her shirt as she approached them and pouting “I am hurt”.  As the swarm moved in asking what was wrong she went into a long story about her older brother giving her an owie.  She’s good.  So all things considered, everyone is happy and healthy.

      Duf, I'm curious to hear what you say about "School of Rock."  I think it's one of the funniest flics I've seen in a long time- all that and a feel-good ending to boot.  Hal and BB thought it was "just ok".  I have no idea what's wrong with those two.  Another movie y'all should see is  urlLink Shattered Glass .  Hayden Christensen (hottie) plays the real-life Stephen Glass, the young  New Republic  journalist who faked his stories and almost got away with it...until he got busted big-time by Forbes on-line.  Great depiction of a true story - esp for all you writers out there.

       It's Veterans Day  By Duf Fer  I plan to honor our fighting men and women by leaving work in the middle of the day and going to a movie with Mrs. Duf.  I wanted to see "Mystic River," but I was out-voted.  We are going to go to "School of Rock" instead.  I will give a review when I return.  Yours in gratitude to those who died to protect our freedom,  Duf

       Oh, Two Other Things  By Duf Fer  1.  BB:  on the right woman, the low riding pants, even if they lead to a crack or undies show, are all systems "go."  One prob:  they are so rarely on the right kind of woman.  2.  Panda:  Once you go PDA, you never go back.  Check it.  I just uploaded a blog that I wrote in a meeting I was in, and I totally used bluetooth to do it too.  I have four styluses too.  Or is it stylii?

       Hate is Such a Strong Word  By Duf Fer   1.  What food do you like that most people hate?   Okra.  Thank God I’m a country boy.  Have any of you ever had it?  Make mine fried please.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Meat:  it’s murder, yos.  I also cannot stomach the coconut.  I won’t eat it.  Period.  Coconut flavor I like, the coconut itself, I cannot abide.  Add artificial vanilla or any syrup besides real maple syrup.  Also, I need real whipped cream, not Cool Whip.  Thanks.    3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   I would say Brittany Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Julia Roberts.  Let me hasten to add that I don’t think they are homely, I just don’t get why everyone goes coo coo for cocoa puffs over them.      4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   This is somewhat embarrassing, but I can be honest among my friends, right?  I am really attracted to  urlLink Lili Taylor , and to  urlLink Illeana Douglas .  Don’t tease me.  I’m just being honest.      5. What popular trend baffles you?   Number one is the trend with the jeans or skirts that are faded in the seat and thigh.  What’s up with that?

       Who needs Lee Jeans when you can have this...      Yes, folks, I saw the one and only Ricky Springfield on Friday.  It felt like I had gone back in time to 1981.  Hal asked that I break it down for you:  * See that picture above?  Yep, that's Rick's "signature move".  He plays his guitar  with a dozen roses  (making a spectacular rose petal shower), given to him by a woman in the crowd.  When we were walking in the bar, I wondered what all the flowers were for.  I soon found out.  The women went nuts for this shit.  *  urlLink The typical Rick fan : suburbanite; 3-inch bright pink nails; fluffy yellow-blond hair; late 30's-early 40's; bearer of vinyl Rick Springfield album covers from the 80's (to get signed, I suppose); short; obsessed; screechy.  * One unlucky sucker was (literally) dragged to the show by his overweight girlfriend.  She made him follow her through the jam-packed crowd so she could see better.  Unfortunately for him, she dragged him right in front of a group of 5 short, angry, Rick fans.  "Hey, jackass.  You're too tall to stand here.  Get the f- out of our way!! *push, push*"  They were out for blood.  * Some quick Rick facts: Rick still has a mullet.  So does his band manager.  He wore a nerdy flannel shirt which he took off half-way through the show.  He also wears (on his right hand only) a black leather glove with the fingers cut off.  He drinks red wine throughout the show (heart condition, perhaps?).  He oozes kitschy, cheesy goodness.  * At one point during each of his shows, he pulls some chicks up on stage.  Here he is with some girls during his Branson, MO show (they look very similar to the girls he pulled up in Chicago.  Maybe they're groupies.).  I call this "the Rick sandwich":     * I didn't know any of the songs except Jessie's Girl...which he didn't play until the very end.  But obviously, I only went for the choice people watching.

       Did you miss me?    1. What food do you like that most people hate?   I like seafood, and though I’m not in too much of a minority there, it’s the only food I can think of that on occasion people will turn their nose up at.  As in “ewww… how can you EAT that??” when I eat mussels.  Get over it.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Eggs (unless they are in chocolate cake), and apparently, Yoplait Whips.    3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Vin Diesel.  Though I think I’m in total agreement with the other Pandys on that.    4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   This is a tough one.  I can’t think of one… I guess I have pretty mainstream tastes.      5. What popular trend baffles you?   Cars that are bigger than houses.  They are very popular at the parking garage here at work.  Don’t get it.

       Boy I Sure Don't Like Much   By DJ Shovelpants    1. What food do you like that most people hate?   Boy there's probably a veritable assload of foods that I like that most people can't stand, but I'm coming up short here.  I guess I'm going to go with the old Chef Boyardee Ravioli in a can.  For some reason, I find this delicious, yet everyone I know thinks it smells bad and is horrible tasting.  I don't get it.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Do you have a half hour?  Here goes:  a. White n' creamy  - I won't eat anything a white and creamy consistency, which includes: sour cream, mayonaisse, cottage cheese, ranch dressing, cream cheese etc.  I don't know why that is, but none of the above foods or condiments sounds good to me.  At all.  b. Fungus  - I will not eat anything resembling a mushroom.  People spend all kinds of money trying to keep athlete's foot at bay, yet people are willing to eat 'shrooms.  Yuck.  I think the thing that creeps me out about fungus is that it's a scary cross between the animal and plant world.  c. Seafood  - Anything out of the water is staying off of my plate.  That includes: tuna (can or otherwise), fish sticks, croppies, crappies, halibut, salmon, shrimp, whatever.  Sorry, but everything in the aquatic world has a real 'dirty water' taste to me.  And shrimp?  Since when does eating maggots or worms from the water sound appetizing?  d. Nuts  - Some people like to gobble up nuts.  Not me.  The only kind I like are peanuts.  Period.  Cashews, walnuts, almonds...ick.  Bad aftertaste.  That enough for now.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Jennifer Garner.  The list is endless, but this horse-face is sticking out like a sore thumb.  I swear, she looks like Melissa Rivers who is easily one of the most disgusting 'personalities' working in the biz today.  What is Jennifer Garner's appeal?  She's very plain, her eyes are too close together, and I think she's one of the shittiest actresses around (besides that black hole of talent Julia Roberts).  Yet...everyone seems to like ol' Jen Garner.  Shit.    4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   Sheryl Crow.  I don't know if it's her looks or the complete package, but ol' Sherrie does something for me.  Yeah, she's a little bit older and could definitely benefit from a sandwich or two, but I don't know, I dig her vibe.  Her version of Led Zepplin's D'yer Ma'ker is one song of hers that tickles the cockles...of my heart.   5. What popular trend baffles you?   Those stupid ass walkie talkies cell phones.  Isn't the cell phone enough for you?  No, when you've got to talk to someone immediately, just push a button and open your fat mouth.    "Yeah, Jim are you there?  Over."   "Yeah, Scott.  Go ahead for Jim."   "Uh, Jim I can't seem to find the plunger and..."   "Oh yeah, Scott.  It's behind the..."   Annoying.  Infinitely annoying.  As if it wasn't bad enough that we have to hear one half of someone's conversation when they're talking on their cell phone, now we have to hear two assholes acting like their driving freight down the highway.  Some dick in my firefighting class had one and was talking to some shitheel IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS!  Nice guy, but I wanted him dead and his walkie-talkie smashed to pieces. ---------- Bass Babe - About the low pants: yeah, definitely trying to hard.  These pigs usually have a tattoo above their crack in close proximity.  'You like my ass?  No?  How about the tattoo instead?'  Sorry ladies.  No.  PB - What happened with Lee Jeans?  Is he out of the picture?

      Friday Five  hey y'all. sorry to have been MIA the last couple of weeks. Between holy-crap-there's-too-much-work-on-my-plate and setting the most-parties-attended-in-one-night world record (shout out to HAL, my accomplice) there's been no time for blogging. but here's a post to satisfy my fellow 'landahz:   1. What food do you like that most people hate?   hmm...I can't think of anything except Yoplait Whips yogurt that I know only HAL hates. (maybe other Pandies do too...dunno)   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Cottage Cheese. bleck. lumpy, curdy grossness. oh and tunafish. fish that comes in a can?? thanks but I prefer the fish to come out of a lake or ocean.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Ben Affleck. I don't get it. his acting is marginal, personality indistinct & looks are mediocre.   4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   He's not classicly good-looking but I think  urlLink Noah Taylor  is very attractive. I just loved him in "Shine."    5. What popular trend baffles you?   women who wear pants so low that they can't sit without becoming a plumber. Is 'the crack' a now attractive body part? Or is it to show off the underwear? I don't get it. Either way, the look screams "I'm trying too hard to be 'sexy' because I have nothing else to offer." Is this popular trend attractive to men? thoughts, DJS & Duf?

       Some PB News Nuggets   * The month-long drinking sabbatical I was on was completely overridden by my drinking binge last evening.  I had put my blood, sweat, and tears into planning a great networking/social event at Second City (a legendary comedy club here in Chi) for my grad school alumni, and what did I do to celebrate?  I got plowed with the Dean of the business school.  When he made a speech and asked me to stand up to be recognized for my hard work on the board of directors, I remember the act of standing up felt like an extremely daunting task.  * Just when my addiction to cable had gotten to the point where I actually considered a 12-step program, it was cut off.  Completely.  No more cable, free or paid for.  I guess I'll have to take up needlepoint or something, cuz I'm not quite sure what I'll do with all this additional free time.  * I got suckered into attending a SOLD OUT  urlLink Rick Springfield  show tonight.  I know he's a chachi, but that point is probably moot.  I'll make sure to throw a pair of my chonies up on stage, along with the 40+ women who will likely be in that crowd.  * Famous last words: "Let's go up to your place so we can cuddle."  [For those too naive to know, when a guy says he just wants to "cuddle" (whether he just met you or otherwise), he just wants sex.  Or at least a dry humping session.  I am not one of those who is too naive to not know this.  Neither is my friend T.]  * My life could dramatically change by this time next week.  I will let you know if that happens.  And now...the Friday 5.   1. What food do you like that most people hate?  I really like to dip carrots in peanut butter.  A lot of people give me grossed out looks when I do that.  How is that so different from putting celery in peanut butter?  Could someone please explain?   2. What food do you hate that most people love?  I'm OK with sushi rolls (particularly wimpy California rolls), but I hate all other sushi.  It's funny, because when I'm in NY, everyone always wants to go out for sushi.  When I tell them that's not my cup of tea, I ALWAYS get this same response: "You don't like sushi?  But you  look  like you would like sushi."  I  look  like I would like sushi??  What does that even mean?  Is it my hairstyle?  My shoes?  My bra size?  I am dumbfounded.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?  Someone must think Britney Spears is good-looking.  Otherwise, she'd stop making her slutty videos and selling her crap music.  Personally, I think she looks like a damn carnie.  Her legs are kind of squat-like, but I suppose her short skirt/high boot outfit combo doesn't help give the illusion of longer legs.  Someone needs to tell her to stop wearing that shit.   4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?  It used to be Bachelor Bob, until I realized he was as big a tool as any other guy out there.  There, I've said it.  Bob's a pig.  But to answer the question, I think  urlLink Sarah Polley  is unbelievably gorgeous.  She has an average-girl look to her, but when she's on-screen, she shines.     5. What popular trend baffles you?  PDAs.  Don't like 'em.  Won't get one.  Don't try to convince me otherwise. (Granted, I also said that about cell phones at one point, and now I'm a total cell phone whore.)

       Better Late Than Never?  Sure.     1. What was your first Halloween costume?   I was either a gay astronaut (the costume was gay, not me) or a cowboy.  I'm not sure which.  I remember my mom saying that she was getting me an astronaut costume and I was all stoked because when you eat, breath, and drink Star Wars (at 5 years old) you're thinking big shiny helmet, cool space boots, the works.  Oh no.  This costume was the fucking  uniform  the astronauts wear, complete with dicky hat.  It sucked.  I looked like a tool.    2. What was your best costume and why?   I think I'm going to have to go with Moses.  Yeah, that's right.  Moses.  I got a big ol' white beard and white long wig, fashioned some maroon robes out of old clothes and carved myself two styofoam stone tablets where I wrote my OWN 10 Commandments.  Typical commandment?  Thou shalt drop thy pants at my bidding.  Thou shall fetch me some ale.  You get the idea.  The best was dancing with these two tablets.  Had I been single at the time, I think ol' Moses would've gotten all kinds of ass.   3. Did you ever play a trick on someone who didn't give you a treat?   Oh, for Christ's sake.  Grow up!   4. Do you have any Halloween traditions? (ie: Family pumpkin carving, special dinner before trick or treating, etc.)   That's crazy.  My friends and I used to do the same scarecrow trick thing.  Hilarious.  We'd also hide people around the lawn in various piles of leaves so that it looked like the entire yard was rising from the dead.  The kids didn't like it much, but I laughed so hard I almost pissed myself.    5. Share your favorite scary story...real or legend!   No time!

       2003 Top Fives   I don't know if I can remember 5 movies that I've seen this past year. Let's test the memory banks...  1. Lost in Translation -- loved it 2. School of Rock -- pretty funny 3. Elf -- pretty funny too 4. Bruce Almighty -- pretty good if expectations are low, but there is one scene that just made me howl with laughter. 5. Runaway Jury -- sucked.  I saw some other ones too but I just don't remember them right now. I, like Duf, saw some films for the first time this past year that were quite good. The Matrix (first one) was a standout.   Albums 1.  John Mayer ,  Heavier Things  -- I just love this boy's style, sound, guitar prowess, lyrics, the whole package. dream job = John's bass playah.... and lovah .... 2.  Sting ,  Sacred Love  -- this is a no-brainer for those that know me. I will like something, if not all, of anything he records. 3.  The Thorns ,  Self-titled  -- love those harmonies! 4.  Train ,  My Private Nation  -- I'm a sucker for well-written, catchy pop music. 5.  Pete Yorn ,  Day I Forgot  -- love this guy's sound, really enjoyed his concert too.  6.  Guster ,  Keep it Together  -- I just picked this up last week and I'm really diggin it. Since it was a late-in-the-year admission, it's gotten less air-play than the above albums.  Ok, memory banks are in fairly good condition...

       My Top Five  By Duf "Ain't Had No Sitter" Fer  I haven't seen five movies this year.  I saw  28 Days Later  and liked it.  Mrs. Duf and I just saw  House of Sand and Fog  (we both liked the book) and thought it was quite well done.   We also saw  American Wedding , and I know that no matter how hard I try I will never get those 2 hours back.  I saw  Narc  in 2003, so can I count that as my favorite?  I have, however bought a robust number of albums.  I still need to get some stuff that folks have been raving about (Metallica's  St. Anger , Jay-Z's  The Black Album , Yeah Yeah Yeahs  Fever to Tell , The New Pornographers, Dizzee Rascal, Blur's  Think Tank  Drive By Truckers and Bubba Sparxxx), but my current list, from number 5 to number 1 is:   Cat Power  -  You Are Free :  I picked this album up on a recommendation from a Kansas Public Radio show, and it blew me away.  Not uplifting, not hard rocking, but mellow with force.   Outkast  -  Speakerboxx/The Love Below :  When it is right, there has never been anything more right.  When it is not, it is still darn good.  If I tended to listen to either side as a whole, I would rate it higher, but there is something about this two-disc set that prompts me to use my next track button sometimes.  It may just be the nature of the two-disc set.   The Strokes  -  Room on Fire :  The more I listen to it, the more I see it as beautiful in its mathematics.  The whole album is patterns and deviation from patterns.  Brilliant!   The White Stripes  -  Elephant :  It mentions the city of Wichita...no on has done that since Soul Coughing and before that you have to go back to Glen Campbell.  But as for Jack and Meg, two words:  ass-kicking rock.   Radiohead  -  Hail to the Thief :  Okay, I'm so biased that I'm not terribly reliable.  If I admit to being a bit blinded by my love of all things Radiohead, will you listen again to what is still a phenomenally well-structured, well-produced, well-considered and well-executed work of art?

       Top Fives of 2003   We're bored at work.  Why not?   Top Five Movies   Yikes, this one is hard.  Lemme think... 1)  Lost in Translation  - no need to explain 2)  Elf  - not artistic, but DAMN funny 3) (Tie)  Spellbound / Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion  - excellent documentaries 4)  Dirty Pretty Things  - loved the unexpected ending 5)  In America  - just saw it...I usually hate kid actors, but these little angels pulled at my heart strings.   Top Five Albums   1)  The Postal Service  -  Give Up  (I can't stop listening to this!) 2)  The Shins  -  Chutes Too Narrow  3)  Annie Lennox  -  Bare  4)  Michael Buble  - (self-titled) (Don't hate, I love me a hot, young, jazz vocalist) 5)  The Jayhawks  -  Rainy Day Music  (I got this at the show and have had it in my car ever since.)

       Willy-Nilly   I have been reading a course study guide on Project Management that my boss had in her library, and I just read a sentence that uses the word "willy-nilly":  "You cannot allow prototyping to just go on willy-nilly."  Are you kidding me? I thought only 80+ year-old grandmas used that phrase.  And in a Project Management Institute publication no less!

       Can You Tell I'm Swamped at Work?  By Duf "Waiting for the code drop" Fer  Since we're all buddies, and you all know me as a man deeply rooted in the masculine and heterosexual tradition, I call tell you all without fear of compromising my standing as a manly man, or my status as just plain... as... well...macho, that I think I have discovered the best author of all time.  Her name is Jane Austen.  I read  Sense and Sensibility  and named my daughter after its heroine.  I am just finishing  Emma , and though patience is required with all her texts, your reward on completion is an ample one.  I have long argued (much to the chagrin of Mrs. Duf) that sex and money are inextricably linked, and nowhere are issues of class and love more prominently aired than in the works of the beguiling Miss Austen.   Emma  is a masterpiece, and it pales in comparison to  Sense and Sensibility .  I have a book to read for book club (remember I also fart a lot and watch copious amounts of football), but right after that I'm going to read  Mansfield Park  or  Pride and Prejudice .  Maybe I will quit my job and become a Jane Austen scholar at Princeton or something.    Yours over the deep end,  Duf

       May Old Acquaintance, Don't Forget the Friday Five   By PB   1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year?   Getting my ass to the Great North.    2. What was your biggest disappointment?    Meeting a great guy right before I left Chicago - but he'll be here on New Year's, folks.   3. What do you hope the new year brings?   A trip to Iceland and/or Turkey and/or Vegas and/or Europe w/ the fam.   4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?   Start an exercise routine - not to lose weight, necessarily, but to get stronger.  I feel like weak sauce right now.   5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve?   I'm making fondue (it's about time, DJS) for my visitor and then we're meeting the peeps at Lee's Liquor Lounge for a rockin' good time with the 80's cover band, 2 Tickets 2 Paradise. Then I'll kiss someone (on the lips!) at Midnight.  My dream New Year's: that Hal  and  BB show up too, and Monty does the dance of his life to "Come Sail Away" by Styx.  *sigh*

       End of Year Reflection  by Bass Babe  As 2003 comes to a close (and I have nothing to do at work), I'm reflecting on all the big things 2003 has brought me, in order:  1. Trip to Hawaii. Amazing, must return someday. 2. Anxiety, heartache, paranoia, rage and grief, all courtesy of my lying, cheating theif of an ex-boyfriend 3. Determination to make changes in my life.  I can honestly say that 2003 is not on my list of "happy & fulfilled" years. I discovered a part of me that I am not proud of in any way. I wanted to be with someone so badly that I lost respect for myself. And this, I deeply regret. But I suppose it is gratifying to know that I can come out of a situation like that and dig myself out of the hole. The experience of it all has definitely left me a changed woman. And change is, in this case, good.   These last few months I've been very focused on changing my path in life and I'm excited for the future. More as it happens, 'landahz...  Happy New Year! Please accept this as my Year End Five. As I was writing, Duf & DJS were busy posting.   Closed Circuit to HAL & PB: Gee...I wish I had the  urlLink Best Boyfriend Ever ...it's nice to know that Best Boyfriends can also express their attraction and lust for other women.

       Year End Five  By DJ Shovelpants, Esq.    1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year?    Can I list a few?  Thanks, I knew you'd say yes...  - Applying, making the grade and becoming a certified Fire Fighter. - Finishing my 2nd book. - Reconnecting with friends I thought I'd lost forever. - Bringing our lil' dog Nigel into the family.   2. What was your biggest disappointment?    I had some promising prospects that were interested in possibly representing and/or publishing my book, but they seem to have fallen through.   3. What do you hope the new year brings?    - A successful and fun wedding in April. - Additional weight loss. - Time to work on Book 3. - EMT Certification - A new job opportunity doing something I love. - A kick-ass trip to Maui. - Another good concert roadtrip with Dirty. - A prego DJ Laura Z. (am I asking too much?)   4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?    Oh sure.  Once my firefighting training is done, I'm going to be more pro-active about getting my writing in the hands of the right people.  I plan to attend conferences, join critique groups and pound the pavement a bit.    I also want to look tip-top (weight-wise) for my wedding in April.   5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve?    I plan to keep it on the low-key tip.  We'll probably have some friends over, stay off the streets, etc.  I kind of want to be home in case the pager goes off and I need to save the day.  Holidays tend to be high-action days in the firefighting/emt world.  We'll see how this week fares, eh?

       Year End Five  By Duf Fer   1.  What was your biggest accomplishment this year?   We have a very finicky customer division.  Stabilizing the business in that division is my biggest accomplishment this year.   2.  What was your biggest disappointment?   I set as goal to make VP by the end of the year, and I will not do it.  Feh!   3.  What do you hope the new year brings?   Happiness at home.  Continued health.  Weight loss.   4.  Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?   Yes.  It’s all about losing weight in 2004.  I want to look good in a wedding I’m going to in April.  I also have some writing goals.  I want to edit my play and work on a novel idea following the Stephen King method (5 pages a day).   5.  What are your plans for New Year's Eve?   We always go to a friends house (MJ – I call her the Queen of Pop). She makes a gourmet dinner, and we drink and play games. It is a mellow vibe, but one of my favorite holiday traditions.

       A Quick Reflection   Things I love about Minnesota: walking into a grocery store and using a cart (first time in 5 years, yo); people in my apartment building introducing themselves to me - and inviting me in to hold their baby; it feels like Christmas without the annoying tourists on Michigan Ave; the cutest neighborhoods ever (thanks to 44th & Upton); not worrying about locking my car if I'm dropping something off somewhere (my landlord laughed at me when I first got here because I locked my car each time I walked even 10 feet from it); not getting my mail stolen; seeing my friends again!  Things I hate about Minnesota: the mounds and mounds of snow and ice and the horrible cold (my movers' locks were frozen when they arrived...after it took them 4 hours to start their truck).  Slow drivers.  And the Vikings.

       BB was here and she lies.   Yes, BB was just at my new house, and I received a gorgeously wrapped present from her.  The beauty was astounding.  The wrap was purple with pink polka-dots and it was tied together with a pretty magenta bow.  Almost too pretty to open.  Almost.  I've started my new job and found out quickly that my posts here will definitely be slowed down.  I work in a busy "cube farm"...not condusive to fooling around.  Fooling around = making personal phone calls, instant messaging, or posting on blogger.  The good news: it looks like I'm going to be very busy.  The bad news: I don't know shit about insurance.  My defense: smile, nod in agreement, and throw out terms like "HIPPA" and "Fact-Based Medicine."

       Woes of Wrapping  by Bass "Worst Wrapper Ever" Babe  In an effort to make my measly presents to friends and family seem more expensive, (BB's on hard times, yo.) I bought some really pretty, shiny wrapping paper and ribbon. "Hey look at the shiny paper!!"  Now I usually do the "gift bag" sort of wrapping, but I thought, "I'm really going to give it an effort this year and wrap all the gifts with ribbons, bows, the whole nine yards." Ok, so I wrapped 'em all and the paper and riboon actually highlight my lack of wrapping talent.

       Yesterday?  Yeah...That Was A Good Day   Friends, so often we find ourselves talking about the negative things that happen in our days.  Why is that?  Is it because rotten things happening to our person is more interesting?  Do we seem like a braggart if we talk about our successes or when things go our way?  I have no fucking idea.  But, at the risk of sounding bragadocious (check the spelling on that one, HAL) I want to tell you why yesterday was a good day.   1.  I went to work hungry (we need to grocery shop, y'all) and DJ LZ had picked up a delicious Jamba Juice for me yesterday.  Orange A Peel...there ain't no stopping it.   2.  I sent out 10 (count 'em) 10 query letters to solicit my book.  To this date, I've never sent out that many at once.   3.  I got a X-mas card containing a gift certificate for $30 at Best Buy from CK2.  Thanks!   4.  Shortly after, I got a X-mas card containing a Godiva chocolate bar from Duf Fer.  Thanks!   5.  Duf and I enjoyed a mouthwatering burrito (with no waiting) at Chipotle.   6.  The appraisal guest speaker session I put together was well received and went off without a hitch.   7.  I found out I passed my state certification.  Translation: I'm an official card-carrying firefighter now.   8.  Whilst shopping, I found a video game I was looking for...and cheap!   9.  Got the bulk of my X-mas shopping done.   10.  Saw 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.   11.   DJ LZ bought me a pint glass (I collect 'em, you know) with a little rabbit on it that says: 'Hey this made me throw up a little.'  Yeah...it's gonna be hard to top yesterday.

       Dictionary Assistance Requested  By Duf "whatdatmean" Fer  On reading that late segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond sired a child with his black  teenage  housekeeper, I find myself challenging my long-held understanding of the word segregation.

       O Come, O Come Emmanuel     1. Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?   Yep.  They go hand-in-hand.  But as soon as the 25th of December passes, bring on the warm weather vacation!   2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?   I like mixing it up from year to year (i.e. sometimes being at home, sometimes visiting family, sometimes picking a new destination), but the perfect celebrations always include good food and great company.   3. Do you do have any holiday traditions?   My family doesn’t have too many Christmas traditions, except that we always go to Mass at some point.  And if we’re home, we open presents on Christmas Eve (when traveling, we don’t bring presents with us).  When I’ve been in England for Christmas, we do Christmas crackers (two people pull apart a paper contraption that “cracks” and a toy prize, a joke, and a paper crown fall out) and wear our paper crowns during Christmas dinner.   4. Do you do anything to help the needy?   I act pretty much the same towards the needy during the holidays as I do the rest of the year.  The major exception is that I throw snowballs and ice chunks this time of the year, whereas in the summer it’s usually pop cans and other garbage.    5. What one gift would you like for yourself?   A day at the spa.

       1.  Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?   To me, cold weather is more essential to the holidays than anything else except family and friends.  Later this week I may go to Florida for work, and it is hard to imagine I will feel a holiday vibe there at all.  I know for those who live in warmer climes, it is fine, but for me, a white Christmas is preferred.   2.  What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?   Family and friends.  Food and fun.  Relaxation.  That is my ideal holiday.  A portable DVD player wouldn’t hurt either (just kidding).  I would love a Christmas where my family and Mrs. Duf’s family all got together.   3.  Do you do have any holiday traditions?   Every Christmas and every Thanksgiving, I read short stories from a Truman Capote collection that the Modern Library issues.  I also get snockered on Tom and Jerry’s and tell people what I really think of them.   4.  Do you do anything to help the needy?   I absolutely refuse to give a cent to the Salvation Army (for political reasons).  I would sooner eat $1000 than give them a penny.  Mrs. Duf and I do most of our charitable giving this time of year.  Our favorite charities are a local humane society, Mother to Mother (a Catholic charities group), the Minnesota Literacy Council and the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy.   5.  What one gift would you like for yourself?   A portable DVD player with Bose noise canceling headphones (does that count as two?).

       Move Update   This will probably be my last post for at least a few days.  I haven't picked the best time of year to move - sounds like Mpls is getting a bunch of snow and tomorrow Chi will be hit with a "rain/snow mixture".  Should make for good traveling for me and my movers.  This is the first move I've ever done completely by myself (no friends, parents, cute neighbors etc.) and I'm totally exhausted.

       My $0.02    1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?   Yep.  I like to shop, unless it’s under pressure (i.e. need to find a gift for someone in 30 minutes, need a pair of shoes to match an formal outfit).   2. What was the last thing you purchased?   Starbucks coffee, Sunday afternoon.   3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?   Like ‘em both, but I only really order online from Amazon.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?   I got an allowance, but I don’t really remember it, aside from needing to empty the dishwasher, etc. to get it.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?   On Saturday I spent $60 on a top that, in hindsight, I don’t really like or need, so I’m going to return it.  That’s at the high end of what I’ll spend on clothes (exempting shoes, purses, and outerwear, of course), and I’m certainly not going to spend it on something I don’t like.

       Still Here, Yo.    1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?    Yeah, I do.  I'm a total consumer and I can't go a paycheck without buying myself some shit.  Whether it be a DVD, music, vids, or anything else that I really don't need, I'm a junkie.  Everytime I walk through a store, I'm making a mental list in my head of all the crap I want to buy.  It's a sickness, I'm sure.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?    Well, I just put a bid in for the Johnny Cash autobiography in hardcover.  Does that count?  That was like an hour ago...    3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?    This is a tough one for me.  I like the convenience of shopping online, as I can't stand crowds and stupid people walking slowly in front of my.  I also like getting a 'parcel' in the mail, which is another benefit to shopping online.  The only thing that bugs me is that I want my product NOW.  Having to wait is the worst.  Literally, it'll ruin my day if I'm SURE my package will be there and it's not.  Yeah...I know.  I'm goddamn weird.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?    I seem to remember like a $1.00 a week.  But we had to earn it, yo.  Make our beds, keep our rooms tip-top.  I think I saved my money for toys and my brother would spend it right away on candy.  He'd get pissed when I'd buy a Star Wars figure and he'd be ass out.  I wish I could save my money like that now.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?    I got a stupid back-massager thing for my chair here at work.  See, I jacked my back on Thursday night and I needed a quick-fix before my big firefighter test yesterday.  It was like $40 and I ended up slamming the remote control in the door.  So, I did what anyone else would do:  After my back felt better,  I returned it and got a full refund.  It was seriously a piece of shit, though.  (Panda: If you aren't locked in for insurance yet, you should let me know.  Our State Farm agent is good quality and he's cheap.)

      Before I answer this Friday 5, I'd like to review one of my answers to our last one...  ** List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year.   Finalize a move date. (Check. December 10th.) Finalize a car purchase. (Check.  Toyota Camry.) Finalize a start date at my new job. (Check. December 17th.) Finish the Frank Lloyd Wright cross-stich I've been working on for my mom for Christmas. (Check. I even made the frame.)  Finalize a New Year's date. (and...Check.)    1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?    I only like to shop if I have a purpose.  Otherwise, I'd rather not browse or window-shop.  If I do that, I only buy shit I don't need.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?    Christmas presents.  But they're a surprise, y'all.    3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?    For clothes, I prefer going to the shop in order to touch the fabric and try 'em on.  I usually buy my books and CDs online, though.  Not a lot of risk there.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?    I think my allowance was something like $3.00 a week in grade school.  What could that buy me?  Stickers...I was obsessed with stickers.  But I don't remember getting an allowance in high school.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?    Car insurance through Geico.  I think I got majorly screwed, but I didn't have time to shop around.  I forgot how much it costs to own a car.

       Last Friday's Five  By Duf "Five Alive" Fer   1.  Do you like to shop? Why or why not?   I don’t.  I don’t even like to shop for things that I love (records, golf equipment, DVDs, etc.).  I can’t explain it.  I just don’t like to shop.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?   I bought my wife a quilt and two matching shams for her birthday last week.    3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?   It’s a tie.  I hate the wait associated with online shopping; it takes too long to ship things, but I love how it avoids the crows and hassle.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?     Yes.  When I was in high school, my allowance was $100 a month (I had to use it for everything).   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?   “La Femme Nikita” I regretted it because I already own it.  It turned out well...I gave it my brother.

Uhhhhh....   Duf overheard the exchange and later asked me, "so, how much money do you have?"  As for Ms. Paltrow?  Further reason to hate her more.  Grrrrrrrrr.

       Husband Club Rated It Difficult to Extremely Difficult  By Duf "Run It Up the Flagpole" Fer  On the 20th, I'm trying to sneak out to see the Miserable Minnesota Vikings play the Quite Talented Kansas City Chiefs.  At my last Husband Club meeting (a gathering of husbands who just want to do right TM) I talked about my plans to see the game then go to a concert all on the same day.  The boys felt it would be difficult to extremely difficult to pull off.  We wondered which was worse though:  being gone two nights in a row or being gone most of a Saturday.  No one proposed skipping one of the events.  Hmmmmmm..... Hmmmmmm.....

      Ed McMahon has paid me a visit...  1. Who do you call first?  My Parents   2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  A house   3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?  A Vacation for me, the Pandies and all of BB's friends  4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?  To Family. Make sure mom, pop, and the sibs are all taken care of for awhile.  Charity: National Endowment for the Arts &  the local Humane Society  5. Do you invest any? If so, how?  I would invest in real estate, some stocks and me by 1) setting up my own fitness studio in prime locale with a sizable marketing budget and 2) I'd get in a good pop band and make an album in a kick-ayass studio.  This was a boring post. Sorry, yo.

       I have just won one million dollars:  By Duf "Ain't Nuttin to a Pimp Like Me" Fer  For starters, I am going to say something strange (indulge me in an Austin Powers moment for just a second).  One million dollars is a lot of money, but it is not a  life changing  amount of money to me.  Does that make me hopelessly middle class?  For fun, I am answering as though I have one million tax free dollars.   1. Who do you call first?  My financial advisor at Merrill Lynch.   2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  A Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date (stainless steel) in the 36 mm size ($7,500)   3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?  I buy Mrs. Duf Fer a Jaguar (her dream car) ($50,000)   4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?  To charity- Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy ($50,000) Minnesota Literacy Council ($50,000) Minnesotans Against the Death Penalty ($50,000) Ramsey County Humane Society ($50,000)  To Family- My mom ($100,000) My brother and his family ($100,000)   5. Do you invest any? If so, how?  I invest the remainding $542, 500 by putting $50,000  in TinyE’s 529 plan (which, with the present amount plus 15 years of growth, should pay for Bennington or Radcliffe or Princeton or Kansas University or any other school she wants to go to) and by allocating the last $492,500 as recommended by my advisor (though I suspect a healthy portion of it would go into residential real estate).

       I Need a Nap Friday Five   Starsailor was great (although I still can't see), but I'm so, so tired...so instead of working, here's my 5...   You have just won one million dollars:    1. Who do you call first?   1) My Parents (via phone) 2) Randy (in person after I buy him a ticket to come here) 3) My friends (at a party I put together at the Country Bar)   2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?   A house near Lake Harriet. (But not  on  the lake...I'd need a lot more money for that.)     3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?   Burritos for everyone from Pandyland.     4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?   Charities: International Primate Protection League, Alzheimer's Association Family: My brother Friends: to BB, so she can pay off her debt, relax, and buy some sex toys.   5. Do you invest any? If so, how?   I'd buy more stock in my company.  Since I've been here, my stock has gone up $10/share!

       I'm Po.   Duf,  although I had a great time at the party, I, sadly, could not justify the expense of such items against the credit card debt, upcoming expenses, and the like. Boy, I wish I wasn't so damn practical sometimes...but maybe it's  more  practical to partake in such intimate items to avoid any expense and headache of being with an actual man...thoughts?  Yours, BB

       Operation: Winter   What's with the Minnesota local news?  I swear, I turn on the evening news and there's some chump reporter standing outside telling us all how cold it is.  All week long it's been an expose on the "so-out-of-the-ordinary" weather.  Genius!  What's next?   Today's Feature: Salt Trucks ??  (BTW, on FOX they are really calling it "Operation: Winter" - I laughed out loud at that one.)  I have to have a Hal-like rant about the idiots in this town who go JOGGING during weather like this.  Stay home!  You can take a couple days off for crying out loud.  Or let's all pitch in and buy these clowns treadmills.  No one should (by choice) be running around outside right now.

       Spice It Up   BB and I attended a party on Saturday night.  It wasn't your regular party.  It was one of those parties where they sell things.  You know those parties where ladies get together and the host gets discounts on merchandise if the attendees buy a certain amount?  The products can range from candles, to lame-o baskets, to cookware, to cosmetics.  This party was kind of like that.  Emphasis on  kind of .  There was a host, and there were things being sold, and there were demonstrations...  of  intimate  items.  The demonstrator first started out with bubble bath and lotions...you know, just to get the crowd loosened up.  Then she brought out the big guns - things that vibrated, shook, lit up, and downright scared the hell out of me.  Bottom line: I dropped 100 bones and it's going to be a  great  Valentine's day this year.

      Duf - you will love Sanibel/Captiva!  (Have you been there before?)  As a kid, we went there (w/ grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles, cousins) every Spring Break.  I'm a bit nostalgic for the place.  Recommendations: Go to the Mucky Duck (restaurant/bar) and bring TinyE to the beach to collect sand dollars.

       Well, I Did It  By Duf "Road Warrior" Fer  I spent much of last year going back and forth on whether I should get a portable DVD player.  Pros:  I travel a lot.  I like movies.  It would give me something to do on the plane.  Cons:  I didn't want to buy one if I wasn't going to travel much (I live in denial and always think my travel pace will lighten).  They are spendy and I kept thinking the price would come down (which it kind of did).  I like to read and thought I would not read as much if I had movies to watch (although I used to be able to play movies on my laptop, and I found sometimes I felt like reading, and sometimes I felt like watching a movie).  Well, next month Mrs. Duf and I are going on vacation with TinyE.  We are going to Sanibel Island, Florida, for a few days of R and R.  What finally put me over the edge is the thought of sitting next to a fidgety toddler during a 3 hour flight to Florida.    So I got one.  I did it today.  It is not the top of the line (it has a small screen), but it played to rave reviews on Amazon, and the price (3 honey bees) was in my range (there are some that are still in the 800 to 1,000 dollar range, and I just could not afford the divorce).  I'm kind of excited for my new toy, and you can all play with it any time.

      Last night I saw (and  heard  - it was scary) Hal rage about "snow bikers".  Before seeing her, I considered commuting to work this morning via Roller Blades, but I quickly reconsidered.  Thanks for setting me on the straight-and-narrow, Hal.  Also, I'll make sure to never bike through St. Paul in the snow, as to avoid a hit-and-run with you.

       High Calibur Quality   If you've got the means (speakers and such) at your disposal whilst at work, check out the website for a band called  urlLink The Darkness .  They're like this generation's Spinal Tap.  I caught their video 'I Believe In A Thing Called Love' on VH1 this morning (when they could be bothered to actually play music) and I just about had a stroke with the laughter that ensued.  Dial it up and see it for yourself.  Click on 'Videos' and watch it.  Classic.

       Bringing Up The Rear - It's DJS   At this moment, what is your favorite...    1. ...song?   I don't know if I've got a favorite song, but I've been spinning the new CD by Jet 'Get Born.'  You've probably heard their song "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" on the radio.  If not, give it a listen.  I think they're much more interesting than the (in my opinion) overrated Strokes.  They're dirty, ugly, and they make sweet, sweet music.    2. ...food?   DJ LZ and I discovered 'Axel's Bonfire' a few months back in Woodbury and I'm a huge...HUGE fan of their chicken quesadilla.  I swear, every time I drive by there I want to pop in and inhale one.  They're that friggin' good.  Of course, I'd be remiss not to mention my five-pound friends, the Chipotle chicken burrito.   3. ...tv show?   Pretty simple: 24.  Now, I refuse to watch it during it's normal broadcast, what with the commitment and the commercials and such, but suffice it to say, I've blazed through the first 2 seasons on DVD and I'm anxious for the release of season 3.  As I've mentioned before, I'm also a big fan of 'Insomniac.'  Dave Attel is my hero, yo.    4. ...scent?   My shampoo.  A guy who's in my firefighting class works at Aveda and scored me a big ass bottle of 'Rosemary Mint' shampoo.  I'm sure by the time I reach the bottom of the quart sized bottle I'll be plenty sick of it.   5. ...quote?   This comes from Tony Almeida after being asked by Jack Bauer (in 24) where so and so was:  "He wasn't playing ball, so I had to take him out."   Speaking of Sean Penn, I'm finally going to see 'Mystic River' on Friday.  If this movie is going to unseat my Lord of the Rings buddies, I want to at least see what it's all about.

       Here goes...    At this moment, what is your favorite...    1. ...song?   I am currently addicted to the latest from  urlLink Beth Orton – “Pass in Time: The Definitive Collection” .  It’s a hybrid of greatest hits and rarities, and she’s won me over again (even if most of it’s not new to me) after the debacle of “Daybreaker”.  There are two songs (both in the “new to me” category) that I’m obsessed with – “Where Do I Begin” (a collaboration with the Chemical Brothers), and “Don’t Wanna Know About Evil”.   2. ...food?  On Saturday night I had a great, great meal at a place called “Azia”.  I got Vietnamese coconut curry with tofu on brown rice.  It was good enough that I’m still thinking about it today.   3. ...tv show?   Who are we kidding?  My  urlLink Alias  obsession is rock-solid and well documented [closed circuit to BB: season 2 is at the ready].  That said, the funniest thing you will ever see on television is  urlLink The Office .  Mr. Fur gave me the DVD for Christmas, and it’s yet another reason I worship the Duf.  Yesterday, The Office won two awards at the Golden Globes (Best Comedy and Best Comedic Actor) and even the acceptance speeches were hilarity.     4. ...scent?    I got a new hand soap that I like, it’s lavender scented.   5. ...quote?  “GAAAH!!!  I just puked in my space helmet.”, or “You guys can’t reenter the atmosphere until you develop a cure for AIDS.  Get crackin’.” Or just about anything else from  urlLink this site .  And aside from all the nonsense above, I saw  urlLink this flick  this weekend, and I'm still depressed.  What a downer.  But that Sean Penn can act.

       At this moment, what is your favorite...     1. ...song?   For some reason, “Hey Ya’” by Outkast has made a return to my CD changer.  TinyE loves it, and I think her admiration for it is contagious. I am rocking it non-stop right now.  I also like this version of "Simple Gifts" that traditional Quaker song by Yo Yo Ma and Alison Krauss.   2. ...food?   The Javanese tofu at Whole Foods.  Deeeelish! I'm also way into  urlLink these wraps .    3. ...tv show?   CBS Sunday Morning:  they just had their 25th Anniversary show, and it amazed me how many episodes I’d seen.  I know I come off as nerdy for having that as a favorite (other favorites are 60 Minutes and The Simpsons), but if you ever watch it, you will be amazed by how they put together a phenomenal show every darn week, 52 times a year.    4. ...scent?   Honestly, I have been sick for so long, that I can’t really detect any scents.  I don’t have a strong sense of smell to begin with, and you add nasal and sinus congestion to the mix, and forget about it.  Past favorites:  puppy dog breath, new car, and napalm in the morning (it smells like victory).    5. ...quote? “We have discovered dozens of weapons of mass destruction- related program activity.”  President George W. Bush, State of the Union Address.

       At this moment, what is your favorite...     1. ...song?   "Something's Missing" by John Mayer   2. ...food?   the chocolate chip raisin cookie bars my friend Jenny had at her party on Sat. night. She brought the leftovers in to work today and they are absoultely delish. I'm enjoying one right now, so it definitely qualifies as the favorite this moment.   3. ...tv show?   Alias. HAL, I'm due for the second season on DVD. I'm excited just thinking about curling up with another 22 episodes back-to-back. (can we say BB needs a date or two?)   4. ...scent?   Aveda oils...mmm...they are so good.   5. ...quote?   "I'm going to do it...I'm going to do it!"  urlLink FEZ --  That '70s Show  I see the preview for the reruns on Fox 29 all the time, and every time they show FEZ dancing and saying this line in his little accent, it cracks me up. So it's my favorite quote at the moment.

       Finally, Some Peace & Quiet Saturday Five     At this moment, what is your favorite...     1. ...song?  "Answer" from  urlLink Sarah McLachlan's  most recent album,  Afterglow    2. ...food?  The chocolate chip cookies in my work's cafeteria...right out of the oven.  I can't resist them at least 3 times a week.  My ass is surely paying the price.   3. ...tv show?  The sexiest (and most intriguing) show on TV:  urlLink The L Word , on Showtime.  My co-worker has taped a couple for me and I'm hooked.  Speaking of my coworker, she started a couple weeks after me, and mentioned moving here from L.A. to be closer to her in-laws.  Naturally, I asked her about her husband.  I should have known better - she said she has a "partner."   But she's cool, since she's opening my eyes to the world of lesbian love.     4. ...scent?  White Musk by the Body Shop.  Men can't get enough of it.   5. ...quote?   "A woman has got to love a bad man once or twice in her life to be thankful for a good one."  ~Mae West  Bonus Link:  urlLink This made me crack up .  Especially considering what year it is.

I'll e-mail his picture to you all.  That way, you'll get to enjoy it for yourselves.  (Hint: For maximum effectiveness, cut picture out, tape onto monitor and read my post from this morning.

       Meet Ruffy   The old codger up above was on the front page of the news paper in that 'Frozen Hell-Hole' also known as Rochester New York.  Yeah...that was the kind of stuff HAL and I had to put up with whilst traveling for bid-ness.  Yeah, it was cold there, but Jesus Christ.  This is front page news?  HAL and I joked that ol' Ruffy Rodgers (his real name, no shit) looked like he was saying: 'Please...make it stop.'  Doesn't it look less like his ears are cold and more like they've been seared off with some sort of hot branding iron?  Word of advice, pal.  Be careful how you show your displeasure with the elements.  Otherwise, your wimpy ass will end up on the front page of the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle.  Or the very least, Pandyland.  Anyway, since I ruined the whole picture thing last time when I removed that creepy monkey, I thought I'd make up for it with a new mascot of sorts: Ol' Ruffy.

       A Fine How Do You Do!/Caught Up in the Stupid/Dealey Rememberances  By Duf "Left Eye" Fer  This morning, my daughter, TinyE, a child who I carried in utero for 40 weeks (not the 9 months of rumor) and labored 27 hours and 16 minutes to deliver, a child I nursed for 13 months, four days and two feedings, punched me in my left eye with gusto.  It's still watering...  There was a small girl who punch my eye.  I don't know why she punched my eye, perhaps I'll cry.    Last night I watched that new reality show, My Big Fat, Greek, Obnoxious, Fat, Loser Fiance.  It will not hold my interest, but it did for about 23 minutes.  Last week I caught a minute of "The Apprentice" and saw the Donald fire someone.  That was engaging.  I would watch it again, but there is no way I will remember when it is on next.   For some reason I kept thinking that we all should be on that show.  I would win for sure.  Sorry Landahz', I'm corporate like that.  HAL and I are returning to Dallas and perhaps to Dealey Plaza where apparently there was some assassination or other.  Last time we were there we got milked for a 3 hour tour (a 3 hour tour) and conned out of 5 quid (all we had) by our tour guide.  We both felt lousy, but HAL was the only one with cash (I get no miles when I pay cash, you feel me?).  Anyway, HAL should we go back to give a proper tip?

       To Quote Wil Farrell:   "I'm in love, and I don't care who knows it!"  Now, on to our regularly scheduled program...   1. What does it say in the signature line of your emails?    Don't have one.  We probably have the oldest version ever of Lotus Notes here at work, and there's actually not the capability.  But in all honesty, I think they're a bit pretentious.  Plus, I never understood why people put their e-mail addresses in them.  Aren't you already sending the person an e-mail?  Don't get it.   2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?   I used a weird Chinese proverb: "Do not use a hatchet to kill a fly on your friend's forehead."  Don't ask me why.   3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?   I remember when my little brother slaved over what he wanted on his plates.  He eventually settled on "MUEGLFN" (Marquette University Eagle Fan.)  What a chach.  I would probably choose MNKYLVR or U24EVAH.   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?   I got a pen for high school graduation with my name on it.  Dumb gift.   5. What would you like your epitaph to be?    I'm totally ripping this off from  Moulin Rouge : "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."

      I am overdue to log on and give a shout out to my fellow 'landaz.  So here goes...  ...  *tumbleweed*  ...  Unfortunately, not much to shout about.  Yes, Vegas was a nice time.  I think we showed some sinners the right path, and they are now on the road to redemption.  That feels good.  Then last week I spent some time with Mr. Shovelpants in Rochester, NY, and that felt, well, cold.

       Monday Five...Brought to You in Part By: DJ Shovelpants    1. What does it say in the signature line of your emails?    - DJS  DJ Shovelpants Training / Communications That Place He Works Phone: 555.555.5785 Fax: 555.555.4387 dshovelpants@tphw.com    2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?  Yeah, I did.  It wasn't anything inspirational or even very nice at all.  I think it simply said: 'I never liked you.'  I guess at the time, I used to say that to all of my friends.  They'd say something I didn't like, even in jest, and I always came back with those 4 simple words.  Back then, it was comedy platinum.   3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?  I did have some vanity plates.  Thankfully I got them before Duf got his mitts on them.  Mine were: PSTLWPD, which was short for 'Pistol Whipped' which was what I called my fictitious production company.  I thought they'd look great on my Plymouth Breeze (please kill me now) but sadly they went the way of a passing breeze, which is to say: I don't have 'em any more.  I would like:  FIREGUY VIDS YO POWERUP WNGAME DJSDJLZ BLLSOUT DLISHUS LASTWRD UDNTKNW   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?  Not sure if this counts:  When I was 5 years old, I was one of those poor kids that were in those paegants and I ended up somehow winning the top prize, which meant I was forced to ride in parades all year long and give speeches at stupid events.  For my trouble, I won a bunch of crap or what we like to call gifts.  One of the things I got was a bracelet that had my name on the front and it said: 'Junior So-an-So 1978.'  Lame.   5. What would you like your epitaph to be?    That DJS hasn't been around Seriously...nowhere to be found I heard the other day He went off on his way Now he's planted in the ground.  (Actually, I probably won't have one.  I've got a real problem with the embalming process and all of the weird decorative things our culture does with dead bodies, so I hope to be melted down exactly as I'm found.  No fuss...no muss.)

       FF by BB    1. What does it say in the signature line of your emails?    ****************** Bass Babe, Project Manager Company  Address Phone | Fax Work email addy web site URL   2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?   Yes, we did have quotes. If memory serves, I believe mine was a line from a poem about music, something like "music is the neccessary luxury for all" thought it was kind of a cool line. I think I also referenced an inside joke that I had with a couple of friends.    3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?    I would go with: JSKO  or  BASBABE  or  BBROCKZ   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?   Yes, one. I took a date to a big, fancy black-tie ball when I was 18 and he brought me flowers with a gold heart attached to them, reading: "BB & Ryan, Charity Ball 1993" I thought it was sweet at the time...actually it's still sweet cuz he made a nice effort, and my standards are pretty low right now with men and their nice efforts.   5. What would you like your epitaph to be?   Gee...I dunno if I can top Duf's, but here goes:  Bass Babe A girl who liked things of many such sorts Travel, exercise and time spent with cohorts. Loyal, honest, a friend through and through Tears and laughter when things were so blue. She enjoyed much music, dance and song Could rock that bass all night long Concerts, Vegas, the nightlife was fun Gigs at the church, she rose with the sun Now that she's dead, look to the sky Rockin with God, yo, no need to cry.

      I can't do it at work (right now I'm on the sly), so you'll be getting limited posts from me here on out.  Unless I get the corner office sometime soon.  Then I can do whatever I want.  Then I will invite you all over for Chipotle burritos.  And I'll have my limo driver come and pick each of you up.  No, make that my private helicopter.  Until then, no posts.  I'm still a peon.

       Film Strip Time    urlLink Fanta Shokata Movie   I wrote the dialogue for that!  It's like my 2nd attempt, but I plan to do more.  You can go onto  urlLink this  website and make up the subtitles for little snippets of film.  It's supposed to advertise a Fanta-type soft drink, but who cares about that???  It works best if you gots sound, yo.

       Gotta Get Me Some Kids   Friends, yesterday I had the opportunity to do a Public Education-type thing with the fire department.  We went to a school out in Woodbury and got to talk with little kindergarteners about firefighters, trucks, etc.  I probably looked like a smiling buffoon because I really, in all seriousness, think little kids are the funniest creatures walking the planet.  They sat 'on their pockets' (a new term for indian-style sitting) and looked up at the other guys and I like we were superheroes.  That alone, has been worth all the work and stuff I've done to become a legit fireman.   Some highlights:   - When asked if they had any questions, 10-12 little hands shot up.  'How hot does in get in those fires?' 'My grandma had surgery on her knee last month.' 'One time my dad was driving and he saw smoke coming from his car.' 'Do you catch bad guys?'   - When brought outside to have a look inside our fire truck:  'I've never been in a fire truck before!'   Yeah?  I said.  What do you think?   'It's good.'   'Aren't we going to drive around and put out fires?' 'I want to climb the ladder.'   (note: the ladder is 75 feet straight up in the air)  As I helped the kids down from the truck, I told them to be careful because it was slippery.  As I led the group of 5 kids back toward the school, I noticed a little hand had grabbed mine.  I looked down and this little girl was holding my hand.  Awww....  I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea: I can't wait to have kids.  Side note: I should be getting some pictures of the event soon.  I'll be sure to share them, yo.

      We're going to Vermont over President's weekend (aka Valentine's weekend) and we're staying  urlLink here .  Yes, the dog is cheesy, but so is the in-room jacuzzi.  I can't complain, but I can't help but compare it to  urlLink Sybaris .  No slide, however there  is  a wood-burning stove.  We vowed not to do any activities with "couples" in the title.  For example: "Couples Skiing", "Sleigh Rides for Couples", "Couples' Snow Angel Contest"....you get what I mean.  That stuff makes me wanna ralph.

       "You will find your paper, sir, in the middle of your snowy lawn."  By Duf "Alright, alright already" Fer  After repeated days of finding my newspaper in the middle of my mid-shin high snowy lawn, I finally relented and sent a nice holiday greeting (a.k.a. "tip") to my paper carrier.  Some call it Minnesota nice.  Some call is passive aggression.  Some call it blackmail.  Either way, I am looking forward to finding my paper on my stoop again.

      Thanks, DJS, for putting up that pic of me and my boyfriend.  Yes, it's true.  I like older men.  Since there was no Friday 5 put up, I went back into their archives to the first FF ever.  Enjoy.   1. Where were you born (city or state or just country)?    Madison, WI.  I was the first born and an apple of my parents' eye.   2. What is your favorite number?   Who cares?   3. Vanilla or chocolate?    Is this a reference to my taste in men?  They are both appealing and I have had fun with chocolate, but usually go with standard vanilla.  Wait, flavors of ice cream?  A mix of both, of course.   4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in?    Travel...I'm constantly planning where I'm going to go next.   5. What kind of mattress do you have on your bed? soft? firm? water?   Can you believe I still sleep in a tiny twin bed?  It's not that I can't afford a bigger one, and I also have the room, but the twin (w/o box spring) is so damn easy to move, I can't part with it.  And it's the comfiest, not-too-firm, not-too-soft mattress ever.  Waterbed?  What is this, 1972?

       Christ.   Speaking of which, I really want to go and see the new Jesus movie, but it seems I'm in short supply of friends who feel the need to see it.  I mean, sure I know how it ends with everyone's favorite bearded son dangling from the crossbeams, but that doesn't necessarily ruin it, right?  Oh.  Sorry if you didn't realize how everything turned out in the end.  *SPOILERS!*  But seriously, I'm thinking this is going to have to be one of those movies I go and see myself.  Just like when you talk about politics with people, religion has a tendency to cause massive rufflings of feathers and I won't be able to help but talk about some of the stuff I've seen.  It's too bad, really.  I'm usually very interested in where people draw their beliefs and what kind of background brought them to the faith (or non-faith in my case) they currently hold dear.  Why do people have to get so worked up over it?  Believe what you want, how you want, whenever you want.  It's simple.  For Chrissakes...

       Get Ready for Rampant Same Sex Marriages!  By Duf "It Just Took a Celeb" Fer  I'm sure  urlLink this  will turn the national tide.  When a mega-celebrity like this has a same sex marriage, it will have the effect of making an overwhelming number of Americans support same sex unions.  Won't it?  I'm sure it will, right?  But then again...

       Something every consumer should know.   Last night I saw Frank Vascellaro (sans Amelia Santaniello) at church.  I'm not much for conspiracy theories, but after reading Duf's earlier post, I see it as undeniable that Pandyland is about to be exposed by an in-depth undercover report.  I have a feeling it has something to do with the seemingly innocent everyday item that is really a death trap lurking in each of our homes (I'll tell you what it is in a later post... stay tuned).  The sad thing is, Frank wasn't even trying to disguise himself (I can't speak to his run-in with Duf).  Enjoy your last peaceful days of anonymity, Pandylanders.

      Quick comment to Duf - it's clear that you don't watch enough reality television if that "Obnoxious Fiance" show is one of the "best tragedies ever displayed on television".  I recommend regular viewings of "The Bachelor(ette)" and "The Real World" (emphasis on the Las Vegas season).  Although I didn't see any of "MBFOF", I don't think anything there tops Trishelle having a three-way in the hot tub (with the other roommates watching) as an act of rebellion directed towards her dad.

       Ash Wednesday - more than just Dirty Ashes   Today is the day I give up cookies and ice cream. (Also, my mother reminded me - "No meat today!") And, for 40 days and nights I will try (my hardest) to get to bed by 10pm (weeknights only -  I'm sure the Lord will accept the fact that I need to whoop it up on Friday and Saturday).  Tonight Hal and I plan on going to the Basilica to get our ashes.  I tried to encourage her to go this morning in order to be able to walk around all day with a dirty forehead (and, in turn, be an example to all the pagans), but she wasn't for it.  (In all seriousness, I always laughed at the clowns who did this in Chicago - what's next...a crown of thorns and stigmata on both hands?  Good grief.)  So if I get a little irritated over the next 6 weeks, blame it on lack of sugar.

       Is it Just Me?  By Duf "the Lone Blogger" Fer  Here's my thing about  urlLink this .  My whole philosophy is that all groups of people who pay for services ought to be able to avail themselves of those services.  So, the money that supports civil services (roads, sewers, and marriages) is paid by all manner of people:  American Indians, Women, the poor and people who are gay and lesbian.  So, if they contribute money that supports those services, they ought to be able to use them.   I don't buy (at all) the argument that allowing our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to marry undermines the sanctity of a union between a man and a woman.  First, it is damn near impossible to further undermine the sanctity of marriage.  You can buy a bride on the internet; you can marry someone you have never met; you can get married while you are intoxicated; you can marry a cousin; you can marry someone so they can stay in the country; you can marry someone so that you can stay in the country; you can get married at the end of a shotgun; you can get married if you are a minor; in some counties, you can marry more than one person.  Also, divorces are through the roof (you can get them for $99) (although the federal government is spending $15 billion to promote marriage, so divorces should go away pretty soon).  Plenty of men and women don't get married at all, they just sleep together (I'm for it) or live together (would advise against it - long story).  So don't give me the sanctity of marriage routine.    Second, if something is sacred, the failure of others to regard it as such should not diminish its sacredness.  It's like arguing that noble Christian churches are undermined by ignoble pagan worship centers that also call themselves churches.  When you are within your church it should hold exactly as much meaning as you assign to it.  The fact that others assign less meaning or regard it differently should not (and in my view therefore does not) matter.  Within my marriage, it matters not to me that other marriages are imperfect, I know that mine is flawless.  If only she would give her toothbrush a good shake before putting it away.  I heard an argument on talk radio (sports radio no less) that the real reason some Republicans oppose gay marriage is that it will open up a big old group of people that corporate America has to insure.  Ah, yes, the old bottom (no pun intended) line rears (no pun intended) its ugly head (no pun intended).  But does anyone think that big corporations will just absorb the costs?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Also, here's a quick flaw.  If you have two people who are of the same sex that live together and that would be married if they could, there is a chance that they both have jobs and within that a high likelihood that at each job they are insured (unless they are like the growing number of working Americans that have jobs but no insurance - but I'm pretty sure all gay and lesbian people are rich).  Anyway, are you with me?  So, here is my theory.  People oppose same sex unions because they don't like to see men kissing men or women kissing women (okay, a lot of people like to see women kissing women, but they need to know that when it's all over, the women will be kissing men again - it needs to have a fun, frolicky nature to it, a porno quality, not like getting married and stuff - that is definitely NO fun).  Anywho, anything that promotes men kissing men is just not going to play in Peoria.  That's my theory.    Last point. I really think Bush (pun intended) could give one shit whether women marry women and men marry men.  I think, like Governor Arnold, he was told to raise a ruckus so he is doing it.  It's good for politics.  If it weren't, he would not care even a little bit.  With that in mind, let's leave the constitution to an expression of how our freedoms apply (as in "insur[ing] the blessings of our liberty for ourselves and our posterity" and not turn it into a document that curtails freedoms ("every body is free except the gays and well the poor and well immigrants oh, and also..." it's just not Constitutional).  It didn't work for the prohibition of booze (great a parties), and it won't work for the prohibition of the gays (also great at parties).

       Big, Fat, Obnoxious  By Duf "Big, Fat, Obnoxious" Fer  I watched the big, fat, obnoxious finale of MBFOF (My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancé) last night.  I thought it was one of the best tragedies ever displayed on television.  A family from Colorado (BTW at the barbershop this weekend, one of the topics was:  what's wrong with Colorado?  Witness:  Columbine, Kobe, Jon Benet Ramsey, and now the football scandal) was absolutely exposed as egomaniacal, elitist, and not terribly cohesive.  The family almost fell apart because their daughter (a prize, sure, but not exactly the woman of the year) was going to marry a guy who was obese, and worse, uncouth.  Of course when it was all over and the $500,000 checks were cut, everything was fine.  Literally, her brothers were going to disown her because they did not approve of her choice of a husband.  What a pair of assholes (someday they will make fine upstanding members of the community who just happen to beat the living daylights out of their wives behind closed doors (you can't count on women to make good decisions, sometimes you have to raise your hand) - they will marry quiet girls who will take their beatings quietly because it just wouldn't do to have a private matter aired out in public)!  Here's what they didn't approve of:  the guy was fat, he burped a lot, he told crass jokes and was clumsy.  Deep down though, he was a nice guy.  No one would imagine him to be the type of guy to hit her or turn to drink or even run around.  But it  just wouldn't look good  for their sister to go around with this loser.  Better to cut the sister loose than to say that cad was a brother-in-law.  The substantive, the thing you want to focus on for a lifetime commitment, was completely secondary to the stylistic.  The whole family looked ridiculous, even the daughter.  It all left me asking what is bigger, fatter and more obnoxious, the fiancé or the family.  The answer is simple.  I bet you can all guess where I come down.

       Random Rants  By Duf "New and Improved with Extra Links" Fer  1.  I feel sorry for  urlLink Ralph Nader .  He's going to get creamed, and he is going to look like a traitor in the process.  As a (Big D) Democrat, I have to tell you, the one thing we Dems need this electoral season is unity.  We have to be singular in our focus, and any divisiveness is against the plan.  Our friends across the aisle have done a masterful job of keeping their team together behind one goal (even though there are two very different types of conservatives (social conservatives versus fiscal conservatives) they stay together.  Fight and make deals behind the scenes, but in public, have one party, one platform, one message).  We need to match that togetherness.  My main man Nader is tearing that down.  Ralph is running without a party affiliation.  He had no chance of winning in 2000, and he has even less of a chance now.  I really want to see his issues highlighted (especially universal health care and 100% publicly financed elections), but running for President when you have ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE OF WINNING is not the way to do it.  It comes off as an exercise in ego.  Personally, I don't think even Ralph can derail the donkey this November, but why try.  Why run the risk of having as part of your resume "delivered 8 years of Bush"?  So I feel sorry for Ralph and fear that all he is going to do is end up tarnishing the memory of a man whose legacy should be safer cars, OSHA and the EPA.  2.  I saw  urlLink Frank Vascellaro  and  urlLink Amelia Santaniello  at Target in Edina.  I didn't speak.  3.  If you live in MN and you have any free time at all, I beg you:  run (don't walk) run to see  urlLink Hairspray .  I saw it yesterday afternoon, and it is wonderful.  It is racy (double entendre - pun intended), but the cast has so much fun, and the fun is so contagious that you can't help but have a blast.  Also, the music is great.  I must confess, that as one of a very, very, very few African-Americans in the audience, I found it ironic that this play talking about integration in the 60s has not yielded perhaps as much progress as we sometimes think we've made.  For obvious reasons, I know very few people who choose not to spend time with others based on race, but, for some reason, you don't see many events or communities that are truly integrated.  It really stood out at the show.  4.   urlLink Vacation on Friday .  Can't wait.  5.  What ever you do, no matter how desperate you get to save money on goods you buy every day.  I urge you to stay away from  urlLink this site .  I have become a total junkie, and I would hate to see it happen to you.

       Lame F Squared    When was the last time you...    1. ...went to the doctor?  A week and a half ago.  I’m a big procrastinator when it comes to doctors visits.  But I was pretty sick, so I went to urgent care.   2. ...went to the dentist?  Last fall.  I’m on the every-six-months plan.   3. ...filled your gas tank?  Dunno.  Within the last week?   4. ...got enough sleep?  I almost always get enough sleep (8 hours/night).  I do poorly without it.   5. ...backed up your computer?  Never.  I don’t have a computer (unless I’m at work).

      The Friday Five Obsession (with HAL references) By Duf "Co-worker of HAL" Fer   When was the last time you...    1. ...went to the doctor?   This morning.  I have fluid in my middle ear (like middle earth only not as trendy), and it won't come out.  I say "huh?" all the time now.  I'm supposed to do this pressure manuever 10 times and hour.  So far, I'm about 28 behind schedule.  Earmaster HAL says "Duf, don't mess around, go to a specialist."  I am obsessed with fear that I have an ear infection though.   2. ...went to the dentist?   Oops, I'm a little overdue. I think it was August for a cleaning.  I was told I have a very clean mouth.  My reply?  "Kiss my ass you fucking bitch!  Shit!" Seriously though, I am an obsessive flosser.  And I promise to stop cursing on my blogs starting [whore!] now...   3. ...filled your gas tank?   I think it was just before I left for Columbus, so Monday the 16th.  I am obsessive about filling my tank when it gets to the half tank point.  My friend Jeff Schrag (from McPherson, Kansas) taught me that obsession.   4. ...got enough sleep?   That's easy, August 21st, 2001 (the day before my daughter was born).  I am the worst sleeper ever, so it doesn't matter.  I obsess too much and cannot fall quiet enough to sleep.  Rumor has it HAL is also a poor sleeper.  I heard that she goes to bed around midnight, then tosses and turns until about 5:00 a.m and eventually gives up.  That's what I heard anyway.   5. ...backed up your computer?   This backup computer thing.  How does that work?  It sounds interesting.   You would think that I would be obsessive about backing up my computer because (a) I have lost documents before (ask HAL), and (b) I sometimes put things that are very important to me on my computer (like poems and short stories).

      Our power was out this morning in our office (giving me the glimmer of hope that I could go home and not work today), but it just turned back on.  Drat.   When was the last time you...    1. ...went to the doctor?   I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, and my doctor back in Chicago understood that since I went to her for 5 years.  The last time I saw her was in the fall.  I still have to find an understanding doctor here.  That's almost as hard as finding a good hair stylist.   2. ...went to the dentist?   Last summer.  My dentist was the best and gave me good teeth self-esteem.  He could have totally been lying, but he was always commenting on how great and healthy my teeth were.  "Aw, shucks, Dr. Goodman.  I'm sure you say that to all the girls..."   3. ...filled your gas tank?   2 weeks ago.  My Toyota has the best gas mileage.   4. ...got enough sleep?   I cannot tell you the last time I had a good-night's sleep (more than 6 straight hours).  Even on weekends, I can't sleep past 6:30.  I think something is wrong with me.   5. ...backed up your computer?   Never...this is something that is always nagging me in the back of my mind.  But now that my computer's burner is broken, there is no backing up anything.  Boo-ya.

       Every Word in the Following Blog is Gospel Truth  By Duf "Still in Shock" Fer  Okay, you know how I was in cloud nine when they announced that Radiohead and the Pixies are headlining The Coachella Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, May 1st and 2nd?  Okay, I just read that the day one line up is (in reverse order and stopping at the 4th band):  Radiohead The Pixies Kraftwerk  and...are you ready for this...it's like I wrote it up myself...  Wilco  I am not kidding you, I actually felt a little light headed when I read that.   I am going to square it with HQ tonight, but if I don't go, some part of me will die.  I'd love to stay for night two and see The Cure, The Flaming Lips, Air, The Crystal Method (although they are best when it is dark - lasers you know), and Dizzee Rascal, but I am going to find some kind of way to go to day one.  Some kind of way.     urlLink Go here!

       Well I'm Movin on Uu-up...to the East Siiide...  Well if it isn't little 'ol BB checkin in on the Pandy tip...sorry to have been MIA lately, just been a busy BB is all. I'm happy to announce that within the last couple weeks I've confirmed that I'll be makin the move to ATL in April. It's been pretty exciting to start telling people for real and my jobs (except the for the Day Job, that's to come in early March) and I feel solid about it. I'm confident that this is a super-good decision for me, and it's refreshing to think of the future in a new light.   But never fear, BB will still live in Pandyland. I'll be the official "Roaming Reporter"...the beauty of the web...  All Pandies are invited to what's being called the "We'll Be Waiting" party in early April. Details to come soon.  rock.

       I'm Back...   and I'm not a bit happy about it.  You know you've had a good time on vacation when the whole time you're there you're either thinking how great it would be to  live  there or at least come back every year.  Yep, Vermont was great.  And, as expected, I took lots and lots of pictures.  Y'all will get to see 'em, so just hold tight.   1. Are you superstitious?   Hmmmm...when I was little I had the superstition about stepping on cracks in the sidewalk - you know "step on a crack and you'll break your mother's back."  My mom already had back problems, and I did not want to be responsible for making her a paraplegic.  No way.  Now I become superstitious during desperate times...I especially like praying to St. Jude, the patron Saint of Hopeless Cases.  Lost your keys?  Praying to St. Jude will guarantee a safe return.   2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition?   You hear about people who wear certain clothing for an extended period of time.  There was a girl in Chicago (when the Cubs were on a streak) who would wear the same pair of underwear as long as the team was winning.  The interviewer asked her what her co-workers thought of this superstition and she said they didn't care.  I can't imagine this girl had many close friends.   3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?   I'm with Hal, as far as "knocking on wood" goes.  I don't like to talk too much about something I do or don't want to happen for fear of the jinx!   4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?   Luck, fate - are these the same?  I definitely believe in fate...I believe that everything happens for a reason, but we do have control over our own choices.  I have rituals, but not necessarily to bring luck.  For instance, I always check my door to make sure it's locked before I go to bed.  And I wake up to NPR every single morning.  But I don't think any of these things make me a luckier person.   5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?    I once had my palm read.  It's so easy to read into all that shit and believe that what is said during a reading is unique only to you.  It's easy to rationalize and think of specific things the reader  must  be referring to in your life.  My friend got her hand read by the same person and we found out she told her some of the same stuff she told me.  Moral of that story: palm reading and the like is a huge crock.  But I still read my horoscope most days and find some things surprisingly accurate...I'm a Taurus (bull-headed, needs structure, loyal) through and through.

       I think of it like insurance...     1. Are you Superstitious?  Yes.  What good Catholic isn’t?  I'm superstitious enough that I don't like to hear other's superstitions, for fear I'll pick it up myself.   2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition?  Have you ever watched someone at bat during a baseball game?  I think it’s the cause of all OCD.   3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?  Knocking on wood.  I think it’s good to be aware that nothing is absolutely certain, and not to take things for granted.   4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?  No lucky number, per se, but I do like odd numbers, especially “3”.  As far as clothing, I have a lucky t-shirt that I wore to my first real concert (U2).  And since we’re talking about luck, I should mention that I got those tickets from a tour crew member the day before the show.  I wore the t-shirt again when I didn’t have tickets for the Minneapolis (U2) show in 2001 – I went to the arena the day of, and got floor tickets from a scalper.  I ended up close enough to Bono to check out his dental work.  But the good news is, I only use the t-shirt’s power for good.  Never for evil.  And when it comes to rituals, they’re pretty much limited to travel, especially airplanes.  I’m far too superstitious to blog about exactly what I do before and during a flight.  Don’t want to jinx myself.   5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?  Only a little bit – You know how each sign describes a general personality type?  Well, I think I’m very much a Leo (my sign) and I know many people with similar feelings about their sign.  However, I don’t read my horoscope, and I wouldn’t bother with getting a “reading”.

       There Is Superstitious...  By Duf "Writings on the Wall" Fer   1.  Are you Superstitious?   Yes, in some ways:  (1) Whenever I drive over railroad tracks, I lift my feet of the floor of the car; (2) If I go through a light too close to when it goes red, I swipe ceiling of my car near the rear view mirror; and (3) I only blog in the nude (sorry about the visual).  No, in one way:  while I think it is fun, I don’t really believe it.   2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition?   I once heard of a guy who would only blog in the nude.   3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?   During the NCAA Men's basketball tournament, I wear my lucky KU hat (which I’m starting to question) and I watch all the games in the same place.  I still think we lost last year because I watched the Championship game in Columbus (work related) instead of at home in St. Paul where I watched all the other games.   4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?   Sure, a little.  My lucky number is 65. When I was a kid, I needed O – 65 to win bingo.  I got it, and I won $100 dollars.  For a 12 year old, $100 is a mighty heap of cash.  Also, without luck, how do you explain the career of Bob Hope?   5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?   What a dumb question.  Of course I do.  That's like asking if the earth is flat.  Think of some of the famous astrologers through history.  DaVinci, Benjamin Banneker, Stephen J. Hawkins. Think about the planets and quarks.  Think about string theory and chaos theory.  Think about NASA.  How can you discredit a science that is studied at every major university as part of the physics department?    What’s that?...Oh, the one with the star signs?...Oh…yeah, that’s a load of crap.  I still read my horoscope most everyday, I just don’t believe what it foretells.

       Time to check in.   Hiya, all - this post marks one of the first times in the past week or two I've felt good, even healthy, so I'm celebrating with a post.  I had a flu-like thing going on, and I made the mistake of going to the doctor earlier this week.  After 3 hours and many pleasant tests (nothing like a nasal swab to put a smile on your face), the doctor told me she didn't know what I had, but it wasn't strep throat, mono or the flu, but it could be the early signs of a chronic and/or degenerate disease [insert joke here].  Nice.  When I asked for more detail on said diseases, she asked if I had "internet".  I guess it's silly to ask the doctor sitting in front of you to discuss your health, what with all the computers around.  So, I go to a few web sites to check out the details.  I've ruled out everything she suggested, but regardless, I'm pretty sure I've only got a few good weeks left in me.  Nothing like WebMD to bring out the hypochondriac in anyone.  A little known fact - "fatigue" is a symptom for literally everything.  That's the last time I go to a doctor.  I'm all about acupunture, chanting and herbal tea from here on out.  ANYWAY... now that I'm feeling better I can get excited about the trip to London I booked last week (for the first week of March).  Yeah, I know, there are so many places in this world, blah, blah, blah.  But the fact of the matter is, what better place is there to be drunk and disorderly?  I love that I'm not judged there.  Besides, I need to live it up before my unnamed disease takes over and I can't leave my bed, much less the country.

Looks like it's going to be a balmy  - 26  degrees on Sunday  without  wind chill.  Guess that cancels our snowshoeing expedition.  Other options: Ben & Jerry's tour (yay), Day-Long Pub Crawl (yay), Spa treatments (except for the "couples massage") (yay), or a one-on-one Yahtzee marathon (nay).  Valentine's day should be  freaky  considering I just got the "goods" from the party I attended a couple weeks ago.  But it's a good thing we don't live  urlLink in Texas .

       Hiatus/NERD alert!   Hey guys, long time no see!  Why is that, you ask?  Well, I kind of got internet-spanked.   How so, DJS?   Well, you see, there's this guy that works at another office associated with ours.  For the sake of confusion, we'll call him Moses Oatmeal.  He and I like to stir things up a bit and it helps us get through the slower times here on the J-O-B.  Another guy who we used to work with, basically manages a company website from another office.  On this site, they list the birthdays of people who work for the company(s).  Well, since anyone can type in any birthday, we decided to have some fun.  Moses started it.   February 14: Val Entinesday   I went next.   February 21st: Stan Keebottom   And so on.  Well, the one that got people's attention was this:   December 25th: Christ Jesus Our Lord and Savior   Yeah...I guess the IT guys didn't think that was so funny.  Our IT guy (who is a friend) had me in his office and told me that some other IT clown was up in arms and wanted justice for the atrocities committed on the site.  He went so far as to jump into MY computer and look at some of my 'Favorites' and informed our IT guy that I'm a menace to the internet.  He wanted to bring it to HR.  Yikes.  So, I have since cleaned out my favorites and destroyed any incriminating evidence.  I've warned Moses of the same and we're in hiding until all of this shit blows over.  Hence, the lack of posts and such.  Side note, if you guys want me to post any new pictures, let me know.  Send it to me and I'll upload it to my account and get 'er up there.   Closed Caption to Duf:  N*E*R*D* is coming to the Quest in April with the Black Eyed Peas.  If you want to go, get some tickets!  I've got mine, but I don't think they'll last, yo.  So far Dirty and DJ LZ are on board for the good times.  It's a Wednesday night.  Boo ya!  And I'm out, DJS

       Phases and Transitions  By Duf "Proud Papa" Fer  You will all someday know the joys and pains of your children's transitions.  Everyone talks about the first words and the first steps (that is when your life  really  changes).  Few people talk about when your child finally learns how to open the refrigerator (no kidding, TinyE has eaten about 15 clementines in the past 3 days).  Here are two more:  last Saturday, we went to our first swimming class, and it was so much fun watching her have so much fun.  She was easily the least obedient kid in the class.  We are very proud.  Last week, we got word that TinyE is moving up to the next class in her montessori.  She will stay there until she is four (basically until kindergarten).  So, she is growing up right before our eyes as they say.   Ah...tranistions...

       It was Square and Iridescent Like a Pearl  By Duf "Masher!" Fer  What tipped me off that I was in a trance is that she crossed her arms and then scowled at me.  Yesterday I was invited to make a presentation during an officer's call.  I was in the room with our Comptroller; we'll call her CD.  Now, CD is really nice, and she is the quietest person I have ever met.  Last year, she had to reprimand me for consistently exceeding my travel budget, and it was high comedy:  (high squeaky voice) "um Duf, Bossman wanted me to talk to you about your travel..."  CD is demure and mouselike except that once a month or so she gets in a screaming match with her husband.  HAL and I think there are dark secrets under the surface.  Dark secrets. Dark. Secrets.  Anyway, CD is also, in my eyes, the protypical soccer mom.  She lives in Woodbury, and I imagine her existence to be well-ordered on the surface.  Her hair is never in disarray, and she has a well-washed SUV.  There's two danger signs right there.  So, she was in this meeting yesterday, and at some point I started to stare off into the distance (it is something that I tend to do since returning from Operation Desert Storm).  Then, I realized that within my gaze (I had been focused on a point a thousand miles away, you understand) was CD's sweater button, the one that rested right in between her small but ambitious breasts.  What called me out of my reverie was when she crossed her arms and then scowled at me.   I swear I was not staring at her chest on purpose.  Still, in the words of Radiohead "I'm a creep."

       Road Trip! or NDO NE1 (a.k.a. "Indio Anyone")?  By Duf "May Day, Mayday" Fer  Pandyland'z DJS publishes our company's newsletter, and it is a work of art.  Each issue features an interview with an employee, and it is always the same questions.  It's like a Proust Questionnaire for our company.  Anyway, one of the questions is something like:  If you could see a concert by any performer or band, dead or alive, who would it be?  I always go back and forth on the answer.  I sometimes go the Bob Marley route.  Sometimes I think I would like to have seen Vladimir Horowitz in concert.  Led Zeppelin comes to mind.  A Tupac and Biggie double billing is not without its charm.  But when I think about it, the two bands that top my list are now playing in the same place on the same fucking night (no, it's not Kraftwerk, although I remember an entire summer spent listening to "Computer World").  I have seen one of them (in KC opening for Love and Rockets and it changed my life) but I have not seen the other and boy do I want to see them.    As a friend of mine would exclaim:    urlLink Owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!

       Back in the MN Five  By Duf "It Was Just a Breast" Fer   What's the most daring thing you've ever done?   It’s a really long story, but while I lived in D.C., I watched a man get beaten until he was comatose.  It happened in the middle of a pick-up basketball game that I was playing in with a group of strangers.  The ambulance came and so did the police.  It was clear that everyone planned to say nothing, but I talked to the police in front of everyone and gave the best description I could.  I hoped that they would call me to a lineup or to trial, but they never did.  Still, I was so scared that I walked off without my roommate’s basketball.      What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of ?   This is super lame, but it is my true answer:  I would like to get a motorcycle and ride it all over the place (maybe even open it up to see what it would do).    On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)   It’s low now.  I would say a 3 or a 4.  I have people counting on me, and I can’t really live my life without considering that.  Having said that, I really believe that some of the things we do that seem the riskiest are really (in retrospect) not so risky at all.  I am a big one for trying to minimize risk, but when all is said and done, if you want to cut, measure twice and then, f it, cut.  Last, I don’t really desire things that are really risky.  I have dreams that I want to pursue, but I am fortunate and have ways to pursue them without much risk.     What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?    I wonder if some of the biggest risks we take aren’t related to love.  About five years ago now, my girlfriend of 7 plus years asked for a separation.  I moved out of a duplex I co-owned with her and another couple and rented a room in a house in St. Paul (I even lived with a smoker, no lie).  As I look back on it, it was a trial separation.  I was going through a really rough time in my life.  I was transitioning out (or being transitioned out – depending on how you look at it) of the law profession and living a fairly reclusive existence.   There was this part of me that felt the easiest thing to do would have been to go back and try to make it work.  I hold no illusions about whether I would have been able to do that – “it takes two to make things go right” and I probably would not have been welcomed back anyway – but in the middle of a time when I wanted to go home more than anything else, I didn’t.  As a result of enduring the darkness (with loads of help, natch), I met my future wife.  As a result of meeting my future wife, I have the true love of my life, my daughter.  I would have endured many more times the risk and heartache if I had any idea how it would all turn out.   ... and what's the worst?   Here again, the answer goes back to a love story.  I once explored a relationship with a dear, dear friend.  In spite of both of our efforts, the relationship did not pan out, and although the friendship is still there, it is changed, and the change has not always been for the best.  Worse, we can’t even look back on it and say “well at least we got to answer that question that (heterosexual) friends (of opposite gender) sometimes wonder about each other.”

       It Can Stop Snowing Already Friday Five    1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done?  Cancelling my wedding a month before the big day.  I think there are a lot of girls out there that would have just gone along with it.   2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of?  Ever since I cancelled my wedding (which, in turn, cancelled my honeymoon trip around the world) I've wanted to volunteer either in Africa (specifically in Tanzania - in a village at the foot of Kilimanjaro) or India (in Dharmsala).  Even at the time I told my mom I wanted to do this, she did not approve.  It's not that she didn't want me to help people, she's just a worrier.  I'd like to try a more non-corporate/creative kind of job...rock star, artist, fashion designer, whatever.  But I have a feeling those that are close to me would wonder why I'm not being more practical.   3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)  7 - perhaps I sometimes make decisions in haste, but I try to never look back.   4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?  I've lived in some amazing cities - London/Chicago/practically New York - and am thankful for these experiences.  Travelling in general has opened my eyes to a lot of different ideas and people.   5. ... and what's the worst?  I tried some weird-looking food on the street in Thailand and got a severe case of the trots.  Sorry...TMI.

Not only do I have my own here, but it has a (working) CD burner. (P.S. - my burner at home has recently died.  Moral of that story: Don't buy a computer from Gateway.)

       This Will Be It...I Swear   Now, I'm no spokesperson for the Catholic church (the Pope would probably be appalled by a lot of things I've done in my life), but I do know a good parish and a bad parish when I see (or read about, in this case) one.  Unfortunately for you and your  fianc?, DJS, you stumbled upon a bad parish.  Regrettably, it's the bad/extreme parishes, priests, bishops, etc that we hear about on the news and from disgruntled ex-Catholics.  And all of these episodes, for most people who hear about them, give the entire church a bad rap.  I'm not saying the Catholic church is perfect.  Not even close.  But it's parishes like the one you experienced that are making people leave the faith.  I definitely know more people who have abandoned Catholicism than have embraced it, and for that I am saddened.  For me, Catholicism should be synonymous with acceptance and embracing of all types of people, forgiveness, holy traditions, the belief in only one God...all the basic Christian ideologies.  Instead, what we hear about are condemnations, the rules associated with "this is right/this is wrong", corruption, pedophilia, etc, etc.  I went to Catholic grade school, college, and grad school.  I have met some amazing people (priests as well as lay people) who embody all things good about the church.  I just wish more people had the positive experiences with the church like I have.  I also think my parents had a lot to do with that.  DJS, I do not categorize you with my ex - the only way I could do that would be if I thought DJ LZ really cared about the Catholic faith.  Like Duf mentioned before, we all are fundamentally good people who want good things for others.  Whether or not you go to a building every Sunday for an hour doesn't change that.

       Just To Clear Some Stuff Up  By DJ "Hey, hey now" Shovelpants  First off, I don't want any of y'all, Christians or otherwise, to think I look down my nose at you and the choices you've made spiritually.  Religion, like politics, is one of those walking-on-eggshell topics that you can really piss someone off or even alienate them with an opposing point of view.  Personally, I like to talk about where people are coming from and why they believe what they believe.  When everyone can agree to just talk and not judge, some pretty interesting dialogue can occur.  So yeah.  I don't hate anyone for their beliefs nor do I judge anyone for following the path they've chosen.  One of my good friends from work here is definitely on the 'God Squad' full time and he and I were able to talk about where we're coming from.  He 'gave his life back to Christ' as he says 3.5 years ago and I can totally respect that.  If it works for you and it makes you a stronger person (which in his case, he claims it does) more power to you.  I admitted to him that I thought he'd cancel the friendship if he knew that I wasn't really a bona fide Christian anymore.  He thought I was crazy.  I'm agnostic.  During high school, I was pretty sure I was athiest, but I know better, now.  I've basically been a non-believer to a 'I-don't-know-what-to-believe' kind of guy since 7th grade.  Crazy, eh?  Like I said to the mentor couple we met with, I think understanding a higher power is not something we as puny self-important little humans can comprehend.  Christ, we can barely drive a remote control car on Mars and we're supposed to understand something as big as a higher power?  Some people say the good book lays it all out...well, if that works for you:  Sure, friends.  I didn't mean to say NOTHING good came out of our Jesus-filled weekend.  There were some high parts, interrupted constantly by the lows.  DJ LZ and I got to talk about stuff that hadn't occurred to us and we got to see that we're alike in a lot of regards and we really do compliment each other in different ways.   The Bad List  (truncated out of respect)  - Having the priest tell everyone that any church 'worth its pulpit' wouldn't perform same-sex marriages. - Being told that if you don't have kids, the Catholic church won't marry you. - Having the most un-sexy couple in the world explain how to have sex.  'Measure the temperature, and check the muccus for constistency...'  Yeah.  Really put us in the mood. - Being told that if you're in a mixed-religion marriage, that you're asking your Catholic counterpart to SIN if you don't allow him/her to go to mass every Sunday. - Listening to some financial guy tell you that you MUST give at least 20% of your earnings to the church. - Having to hear that the marriage isn't about the couple.  It's about getting closer to God. - Getting the speech: 'If you don't pray together, your marriage is doomed to fail.' - Having to explain to our 'mentor couple' why I'm not a Christian or a Catholic anymore.  As for the church and why we're getting married there...  Personally, I feel the whole wedding thing is basically a formality.  The guy up front all dressed up in robes, people kneeling, squatting, doing dance moves with their hands.  Technically, I'm pretty sure you're married when you fill out the marriage license.  Have a witness sign it and you're good to go.  The church thing is a means to an end for me at this point.  I know that no matter what, I want to marry this woman.  Maybe this lumps me in with PB's estranged ex-fiance, but I don't care if Charlie Manson has to marry us or I've got to jump out of a plane to do it.  I just want to marry her.  If that means I need to bite my tongue and go through rituals that really don't mean much to me other than making me feel the tiniest bit like a hypocrite, then so be it.  That's not to say I don't understand how important and what a huge committment getting married is.  It's not something I'm going to take lightly.  Having done this once before, I can see where things fell apart the first time and I know that this time, things are different.  Final chapter, so to speak.  So, all in all, the weekend was an eye-opener to both DJ LZ and me.  She's decided that our little DJ's won't be baptized Catholic and that after the wedding, we'll have nothing to do with that church.  I'm all for it.  I was just happy that she got to see the church's true colors without any outside interference on my part.  "I've been a blind Catholic," she said at the end of day one.  "Tomorrow is going to suck."  That's my girl.

       DJS and Panda Are My Heroes  By Duf "Not in an idolatry way" Fer  Best...blogs...evah!  When I was in college, I was kind of sort of exploring this idea of dating a girl who was Jewish.  She was and is a very close friend, so I naturally thought about what it would be like to be her boy toy...er...boyfriend.  Okay both!  Geez.  Anyway, as part of my ruminations, I wondered what I would do if things got serious.    She was Jewish (did I mention that?).  I was not.  I knew her faith was important to her.  I knew that she would much prefer (if not require) a husband that could celebrate faith traditions with her.  During most of my college years I was a practicing Catholic.  So, I was looking at abandoning my faith to pursue a life with a true friend (a soulmate acutally) and someone I thought I could build a life with.  In the end, I did not pursue the relationship, but not for that reason (another blog for another day).  A few years later, I stopped being a Catholic right after a mass at the St. Paul Cathedral (another blog for another day).  I was free to be anything, including Jewish.  When I met Mrs. Duf, she had four cats (she still does).  I wondered what would happen if I was allergic to cats.  I'm not, so I will never know.  She married a vegetarian, but one who does not care if she eats veal everyday.  She might wonder what would have happened if I did care (I'll ask her).  The long and the short of it is...dear 'landahz.  You may reach a point where you have to balance.  If you love someone and they love you, but they don't love your traditions or your God, then you have a choice to make.  For me...now...if I fell in love with someone who was a devout _____________, and I was not a devout __________, but I loved her, and she loved me...I would try to make it work. I would go to _________ services and try to raise my children in __________ traditions.  It might work for me, because my only strong view on religion is that we should respect all sincere religious beliefs.  Those who walk a spiritual path that feeds their soul are lucky.  Even if that path does not have a deity at its center.    Still, my approach would only work if I had  some  regard for those traditions.  So, for the Judeo-Christian tenets and for the Ahimsa based belief systems I would be fine.  But for those religions that deviated from that, I might struggle (I say might because there is a lot about religion I don't know).    My view is that we are all basically Christians.  We don't value lying, stealing, killing or coveting, etc.  We might not want to go to Ash Wednesday services, but...at the basic level, most reasonable people are in the same place.   So here is my point.  The second most difficult thing I have ever done is be married (and I've only been married for 3.5 years).  The most difficult thing I have ever done is co-parent (and I've only been doing that for 2.5 years).  What matters most (in both arenas) is love.  What matters second is accord on the essential things.  What is essential is up to each person.  If religion is, then it is best to know that it is.  If it isn't, then it is best to know what is.  What matters third?  Compromise.

       For What It's Worth...   ...before I cancelled my wedding, I went through 2 (I guess you could call them) "counseling" sessions.  One kind of wigged me out (the one with the over-the-top priest who was going to marry us), and the other was with a married couple from my parish (if you haven't already guessed, I'm of the Catholic tradition.  DJS, don't hate.)  The priest meeting didn't really affect me too much.  The whole time I was like "C'mon, man.  What the heck do you  really  know about being married?"  But I listened, since I know he had talked to many couples before us, and probably, as an outsider looking in, could give us a different perspective.  Plus, he agreed to do part of our mass in Latin (which is very out-of-the-ordinary and unusual in a cool way since he was only 26 years old), so I tried to give him a bit of our attention for that.  What I thought was really valuable, though, was the meeting with the married couple.  Sure, we had to take a lame multiple choice test with No. 2 pencils and all, but then we had the opportunity to discuss our individual answers and whether or not they matched up (very revelatory, btw.)  The couple pretty much told us straight up that their own marriage had been difficult...(obviously, every marriage is).  It was no walk in the park, but, in the end, they had a spirituality that connected them.  They asked tough questions (not just of the "God" variety) that I think, ultimately led me to ending it all. Please don't assume we never discussed serious topics in the 2 years we were together before this, but it did bring to light some underlying issues even the strongest couples may not think about.  I believe for most couples, if they share a faith, it's just another thing they have in common.  The more you have in common with someone, the more you're likely to get along.  I don't think being of the same church, religion, culture, hair color, hometown, food tastes, etc, necessarily makes 2 people a  better  couple, but it does give them yet another thing they can relate to.  They can understand where the person is coming from when one of them, let's say, insists on saying grace at dinner.  They don't think it's weird when, at Christmas time, you want to put out a manger under the tree and tell your kids about the Baby Jesus.  They can gag together if cranberry sauce is served at Thanksgiving and they both hate it.  These things may not make or break a relationship, but they can definitely bring a couple closer together.  I know my ex-fiance was marrying me in my church because I wanted him to (he could have cared less if we got married on a beach in Guam).  Looking back, that should have been the big tip-off.  In the future, I wouldn't want anyone to just "go along" with something that serious (to me) unless they felt as strongly about it as I did.  In my experiences, doing something solely to please someone else always leads to resentment.

       Couples Counseling  By Duf "Dr. Phil" Fer  DJS...when Mrs. Duf and I were preparing to take the walk, we met with one of the ministers at  urlLink my church  (for those of you who don't know, I am  urlLink Unitarian Universalist ), and she interviewed us about our readiness for matrimonial bliss.  It was very low key, and Mrs. Duf dreaded it like a coming famine.  Mrs. Duf is the introvert of all time, and she literally cringed at questions like:  "why do you love duf?"    For some reason, I have a consitution that kind of likes retreats and couples counseling and all that stuff.  I think it is insightful and challenging and all that stuff.  Having said all that, I'm not sure I would like one that was focused on a faith that was not of my choosing.  DJS, I'm dying for details, so let's burrito soon.

       Friday on Tuesday   by DJ "Even Tardier" Shovelpants   1. What is your favorite time of year?   Fall.  Gotta be.  Even though it's the shortest season of the year.  That frost and shit that sneaks in around early November?  That's that S.O.B. winter trying to ruin the dry and moody crispness that is fall.    2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   I'm a sweatshirt and jeans kind of guy.  So, I did seasons where I can wear that and only that when I'm out and about.  Plus, my birthday and Halloween are tossed in for good measure.  If October isn't the coolest month around, then I don't know what is.  There.  I've said it.    3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Christmas time.  Humbug!  While I like being with the family and such, it also ends up being the biggest stress-pool ever for me.  Don't get me wrong, I like giving gifts to people, but I just hate BUYING the gifts for people.  I second-guess myself to death and I hate fighting the throngs of idiots out at the malls and the stupid drivers and the snow.  Ugh...what's with the snow?  So, yeah.  F Christmas.   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   Do a little dance.  Make a little love.  Get down tonight.   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   I like being at a cabin.  I love tearing through the woods one minute and then skimming across a lake the next.  That's fun for me and one of the reasons I'd have a hard time ever leaving Minnesota again.  The northern part of our great state is worth all the B.S. we put up with down here.  Also, I like to grill out on the patio with some friends and enjoy a nice refreshing bottle of Miller High Life.  Ah...let the good times roll.

       It Was Worse Than I Thought   Hello Kiddies.  That Catholic Pre-Cana retreat thing I went to over the weekend?  Much, much worse than I thought.  So much so, that DJ LZ is ready to shed her Catholic upbringing like a pair of soiled pants.  Makes me wish we would've had the 'talk' about religion a few months, hell...even a year ago.  Now, we're getting married in a Catholic church and neither of us are in the Catholic state o' mind.  You know?  She's ready to jump ship and become Lutheran (or something) and I've let my membership lapse since sixth grade (I never got confirmed, yo.)  Anyway.  I won't sully the site with what I encountered, but let's just say that I feel good about my decision to not fall prey to the pitfalls of organized religion.  Sure I'm getting married in a church, but that's the last of it...

       Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, All you Think about is Sports  By Duf "Channel Surfing" Fer  So, my beloved Jayhawks lost to a Ramblin' (and hackin') Wreck.  They will not make a third consecutive Final Four.  Other schools have all the luck.  Why don't my teams win all the time?  There is no God.  Also, f*&^ Georgia Tech and all they stand for.  The South will NOT rise again.  I would rain curses on Atlanta, but a certain hot chick I know is fixin' to move there, so I will hold of on my plague of frogs...  The University of Minnesota Men's Hockey team will not win a third consecutive national championship.  God has forsaken us.  I rain curses on the city of Duluth (but somehow I hope they win it all.  It's weird).  But,  the Gopher women are NCAA Division I hockey national champions , and, thank God, there was no rioting in Dinkytown (the students either feel blah about women's sports, or they are finally understanding that a sports victory is not a cause to burn and loot).    Also, kudos to the Gopher Women's Basketball team (and Lindsay Whalen who I totally have a crush on, totally) for making it to the elite eight with impressive wins over UCLA, Kansas State (there IS a God) and Boston College.  Closed circuit to Duke:  watch your back.  Also, you suck.     The lesson here is that Chicks Rule!   One a final note:  I rode my new bike on Saturday for about 40 minutes.  I am in horrible, horrible shape.  My heart was pounding on me like a Georgia Tech forward.  Midway through my ride, it started to rain.  I was drenched.  Then the wind picked up, and chilled me to my very bones.  My very bones.  But, it was a little slice of heaven to be back in the saddle after the heartbreaking loss (cursed thieves, I smite thee) of my beloved bicycles last year.

       Friday on Monday  by Bass "Tardy" Babe   1. What is your favorite time of year?   Summer. Without a doubt. No question. No f-f-f-foooolin.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   I like it hot, hot, hot. What can I say...I'm a hot chic.   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Winter. Since it's been over ten years that I lived in a home with a sledding hill in my backyard. I grew up in house that was next to a golf course. (no kidding, Duf!) There was a large hill leading into a tunnel that went under the street that was in my backyard. Hours of sledding fun. and since I always tell myself that I will go snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing in the winter and I never do, leads me to believe that I'm just not that crazy about Old Man Winter. I'm breaking up with him next week.    4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   This year, I plan on packing up everything I own, pack it real tight in my little car and driving for 20 hours. Nothing sez "Celebration" than moving.   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   I'm with the gals on this one, boating on a lake. simply the best. I also enjoy exercising outside. Running when I'm feeling fit, biking at a leisure pace, and walking around the neighborhood. Another top runner is having drinks on a patio bar on a warm summer evening at twilight.

       Here we go...    1. What is your favorite time of year?  I have an appreciation for all the seasons.  But I typically like the first part of each one.  For instance, I look forward to the leaves changing and the first snowfall, but after awhile I get sick of the same-old and I’m waiting for the next change.  This is why I couldn’t live in California.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   Let’s just consider this the Friday Four.   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Um… the end of each season.  Maybe the Friday Three?   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   Friday Two?   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   I love, love, love being lakeside on a beautiful summer day.  Like the Duf, I also enjoy swinging a golf club.  And I love bundling up and taking a walk at night, right after a big snowfall (as long as it’s not -20).  Nothing like the sound of crunching snow under the feet.

       My Five    1. What is your favorite time of year?   Christmas time.  I absolutely love giving people presents.  I like receiving them too, but that's not what I look forward to all year.  I love the smell of Christmas trees and this past year I got to set up my fake silver/aluminum tree from the 1950's (it was my nana's - no real aroma except a little mustiness).  Plus, Christmas means a couple days off, which is always welcome.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?    I'm confused.  I think I already answered that.   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?    The dead of winter sucks because you can't go outside for even 5 minutes, and all I want to do is sleep and eat cake and cookies (yes, cake and cookies...in winter I have an unbelievable craving for both).  Dead of summer is the worst too.  Not only do I hate being sweaty, but at work we can't wear capris or shoes with open toes, so I'm not looking forward to July.   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?    In spring I usually get my shorts, sandals, and T's out for easy access. And I love the first day I can open all the windows in my house.   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?    To go boating.  When you're in a boat, it truly feels like summer (and without the sweat and ickiness because you can go swimming, and there's the wind factor).  Last summer I dated a guy a few times in order to have access to his speed boat.  That's how much I like being on the water with the wind in my face...I didn't even like the guy.

       A Five From the Past  By Duf "Here's How I Felt in 2002" Fer  Our friends at FridayFive.org had all week to come up with five easy questions, and they come up with bubkus, nada, zero, zilch.  So, I went back to the week of March 22, 2002, and this is what they were asking:   1. What is your favorite time of year?   No question about it:  fall.  I love the change of colors, the return of college football, the crisp, cool nights, and the hint of winter in the air.   2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season?   Oh, I couldn't really say...   3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why?   Summer. Because it's too darn hot.  I don't like to be hot.  I like to be cool.   4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons?   I have been known to go to a solstice celebration or two with some of my pagan friends.  Who's askin'?   5. What's your favorite thing to do outside?   Have sex.  No, I kid...I kid.  It's watch people have sex.  Again, with the kidding.  Actually, it's film people...no, really, it's play golf.  I also like to ride bicycles.  But if I had to pick one thing, I would pick play golf.

      it's funny how things converge at the same time... I stayed up past my bedtime last night to catch none other than our beloved David Brent on  urlLink Letterman  last night. Ricky Gervais is just the cutest  ;)

       Destiny fulfilled.   I think I speak for everyone here when I say that Pandyland is a different, more complete place now that all the ‘landaz have see The Office.  In celebration of this event, I share  urlLink this link .  Reading those quotes brings it all back *sigh*.  COCK!

       Damn It   Well, I can thank HAL for totally sucking up my evening last night.  She let me view her copy of  The Office  (on BBC DVD) and I watched every single morsel in one sitting.  Everything.  I'm talking about the documentary, the deleted scenes, everything.  I guess that makes me a 'fat git nerd' who watches these types of things 'with the shades drawn on a sunny day.'  Oh boy.  In a word: brilliant, actually.  I couldn't get enough of this show and like PB & BB before me, I was disappointed that there weren't six more episodes ready for my immediate viewing.  Six shows in a series?  What kind of rubbish is that?  Admittedly, I didn't know what to expect with this show.  I thought it was going to be extra-dry Brit humour (notice the extra 'u' in humour) with a dash of skullduggery.  I think I initially judged this DVD set by it's cover, with the very stern-looking twat on the front who looks as though he's sizing you (or anyone else looking at the product) up.  Imagine my surprise when Ricky Gervais turned out to be nothing like that.  While I liked the movie 'Office Space' this show beats the living crap out of it.  Excellent stuff.  Add one more show to the pile of shows that are the exception to the rule.  I'll be buying this and Series 2 in no time.   Favorite bits:  -  'Get the guitar.'  -  'That's good.  I'll give her an 'A.'  -  'Biting...biting.'  -  'Why're you in so early?  Did you shit the bed again?'  -  'Who all has seen this picture?  Joan, you don't even have a computer...'   How sad is it that there are little parts of Tim that I can totally relate to?

       A Few More Details   Before I forget, I wanted to add a few more gems to what Duf mentioned below.  I'm not going to lie to you, the party was a huge success, but with each success comes some mishaps.  Take for instance, the poor  urlLink Big Unit  (who from now on will be referred to as "The BU").  He got asked by a (heterosexual) couple to go home with them.  I never thought I'd date a guy that fits the "swinger" stereotype.  Luckily, he had no idea what they were talking about and didn't take them up on their offer.  (He told me later that after he turned them down they left, but then 5 minutes later they came back inside and asked him again...so either this really happened, it was deja vu, or the appletini I made him was too strong.  Regardless, they propositioned him at least once.)  Then there was BB's roommate who stumbled across some cheatin'-style hanky-panky in the coat room.  They had politely put all the coats outside the room, but unfortunately for BB, her purse remained inside.  Her roommate entered the room and survived to tell the story.  I'm not going to bother you with the details.  Use your imaginations, sickos.  I also met an interesting couple who were not convinced I could make them a good cocktail.  The leather pants clad husband grabbed the shaker (from my hands), and said "let me do it."  I was not happy.  Then the wife said "We always bring our own lemons."  Huh?  WTF is that?  How pretentious can you be?  I couldn't be too hard on them though.  The husband looked like he was wearing a Hefty bag with legs (fashion tip reminder - leather pants are supposed to be  tight ), and in her skin-tight skirt, she looked like two basketballs stuck in a sausage casing.  I guess these 2 never heard of age-appropriate clothes.  Good grief.  Finally, I was forced to kick out an unruly substance-abusing neighbor.  He wasn't what you would call a "happy drunk".  After he spilled wine on the birthday boy's new rug, I thought he had enough.  "Hey neighbor, you don't look well...why don't we go outside for some fresh air."  He responded with a very bitter and slurred "no."  "Ok, neighbor, why don't we have a smoke then? [btw - I don't smoke, but was using Hal's cigs as bait]."  Now he was irritated: "I know you're placating me..."  "Alright then, neighbor, instead of placating you, I'm telling you to get the f- out of here."  "Absolutely not."  Obviously, this was going nowhere, fast.  In the meantime, he knocked over the stereo and stood (more like barely balanced) in the middle of the room, on the verge of going completely postal.  Finally our friend J got him to leave.  I guess as he was being walked home (barefoot - he forgot his shoes), he told the guys - "That blond girl was a real bitch."  Oh, friend.  Don't you know you won't remember a damn thing in the morning?   Kind of like Hal.

       80% of Awesome  By Duf "Token" Fer  Four out of five (80%) Pandylandaz (don't hate) were in attendance at a house party on Friday night in the Highland section of St. Paul.  DJS was missed a great deal, but we still brought mad flava to the gathering.  Mad flava.  It was all good.  I had a grape jolly rancher drink, and it was smooth and sweet, a tasty treat.  I got to meet R, the divine Ms. PB's gentleman date.  I reconnected with friends I have not seen since my BUNKO days, I did not look at BB's cleavage (BB, you are leaving the Twin Cities at the height of your powers), but I was tempted, and HAL poured red wine all over my white turtleneck.  In other words, a good time was had by all.

       The Five with Flava  by Duf "St. Paul Style, Yo" Fer   1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  Like HAL, I would want a bar with snacks.  But with my snacks, I would want vegetarian food that no one knew was vegetarian.  Nachos with no meat, cheese pizza, fries, artichoke dip, stuffed mushrooms and deviled eggs, stuff like that.     2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  I would sell weed and paraphenalia you could use to smoke weed.  Just kidding.  I would sell space suits and space suit paraphenalia for the upcoming citizen space exploration.  No, really...I would own a store that sold high end electronics.  Stuff that you really can't find at Best Buy or Ultimate Electronics.  Either that or I would own I would own a golf store.     3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  American Literature.   I still dream of writing a great American novel one day.   4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  How to be a pimp.  I would call it the St. Paul Pimp University.  I would get TA's for Big Pimpin' 101 Basics of Pimpin' and Big Pimpin' 102 Pimpin' Redux, but for Pimpin 501 Master Seminar on Pimpology, I would teach that bad boy myself.     5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  American rock and roll...the kind of music that Wilco makes, the kind of music the Flaming Lips make.  That is what I would make.  That, or a hardcore rap album about my life as a pimp in the upper Midwest.  Picture me on the cover with Flava Flav sunglasses and a sable coat...rings on every finger and a cane topped with a diamond.

       F Me...It's the Friday Five a la DJ Shovelpants     1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?   Delicious food, of course.  No, I think I'd have the kind of restaurant that doesn't have any sort of seafood, white sauce, mushrooms or anything else that I don't like in it.  If you've got a sophisticated palate, dine elsewhere friends.  Oh...I'd also call it The Insult Cafe.  I'd love it if when people come in, the host or hostess would say:  'Christ.  You want to eat here?  How many pricks in your party?   I think the people are ready for a good ol' dose of comedy with their meal.  No?  You don't think so?  Dine elsewhere, friends.   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?   Nostalgia.  I'm all about the nostalgia.  I would have vintage Star Wars posters, old Dukes of Hazzard lunchboxes, Stretch Armstrong dolls, Garbage Pail Kids stickers...the works.  Basically, if there was something you remembered or liked as a kid, I'd have it in stock.   'Where are the Easy-Bake Ovens?'   Right this way, ma'am.  3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?    4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  Creative writing.  I want to get to these kids at an early age and basically help them develop ideas and come up with kick-ass stories.  I'm one of those people that believe that everyone can write and I'd like to be there to unleash that potential from some of these little whipper-snappers.  I'd run it kind of different too.  Instead of just saying  'Write a book, kid.  Now.'   I'd get kids together to do cool activities that inspire and encourage the kids to keep going and learn to love it.  Not sure how it happened with me, but...   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  Well, I'm big on lyrics...so it's hard to say.  While most people are looking for a good beat or a particular guitar riff or chord to get them going, I like to hear the story or the way the words are piled together to form the song.  That being said, I think my music would probably fall somewhere in the EELS realm.  The benefit of the EELS is that they're lyrically sound and their music kicks ass.  Can't lose, in my book.

       Alrighty...    1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  I would have a hole-in-the-wall bar with unremarkable food and cheap beer.   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?  I would have a music store (yeah, I know, a very dying breed) with listening stations.  I would lose money on the shop, but it would be kick-ass.   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?  The only book I would ever end up writing is a memoir, and that would only be after my affair with a world leader, or after I stumble across a cure for cancer (whichever is first).  And I would use a ghost-writer.    4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?  I really wouldn’t like to be a teacher.  But since this is a Friday Five question, I’ll say 20th Century History.   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  When you say recorded, you mean burned?  Right?  If I burned an album today, it would have some U2, The Smiths, Beth Orton, Flaming Lips, and Wilco on it.  But ask me again tomorrow.

       Not a bad Friday Five, folks.     If you...     1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?   Indian-French fusion.  You know - duck confit with curry?  Hey, it would work!   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?   Oooo...this is a good one.  I am a lover of chotchkies (although in my rather barren apartment, you wouldn't know).  I love stupid shit like candles, funky photo albums,  urlLink Paul Frank  t-shirts, Asian-inspired jewelry, my list could go on and on.   urlLink This  was my favorite store in Chicago.  I would copy it...but I'd also sell CDs from local artists and play their music in the store.   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?   I would definitely write my own travel book about cool places I've been...this kinda ties into my love of planning.  I always enjoyed showing people around Chicago, and in essence, through a book, I could do the same thing, but with a wider audience.     4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?   I'd teach a film class - it would be like a book club, except you have informal discussions about a particular film.  I'm no expert on film-making, but I know what I like and what I don't like.  I also would not allow any testosterone-filled mainstream films (ie - The Mummy Returns, Men in Black, Terminator 3, or XXX).  Boring.   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?   Hmmmm...a mix between the Indigo Girls, Alanis Morissette, U2, Tori Amos, and Blur.  Hey, it would work!

      My life, as I know it, is now over.  I am officially  urlLink addicted to this .  Sign up for $20/month, make a "movie wish list" and let 3 movies at a time come to your door...with a SASE and no late fees!  It's almost too simple!  BB filled me in on it (I'll have to have a word with her), and I've been adding movies to my list all day.    I may never leave my house again.  And I thought I saved myself by cancelling cable?

       Putting My Money Where My Mouth Is  By Duf "McGillicuddy" Fer  Yesterday, I sent some money to John Kerry (an Irishman - it's his day, St. Patrick's Day) in support of his goal to raise $10 million dollars in 10 days.  I have never sent money to a Presidential candidate before (a few state legislature candidates), and it felt good to do it. If you have the inclination and the means, you should help  urlLink John Kerry meet his goal .

He is normally unafiliated and votes for candidates not parties.  You will see that my brother is a huge proponent of a multi-party system (excellent).  You should check out  urlLink his blog  (scroll down past the cool photo of my niece) regarding his caucus experience.  It is vey, vey interesting.

I can't wait for Series 2 to come out on video, and I will do everything in my power to NOT READ the episode guides on the website before  urlLink April 20, 2004 .  BB loved it so much, she left me a thoughtful voicemail about it over the weekend: "COCK."  Thanks BB.  I love you too.  But not as much as I love  urlLink Gareth .

       The Five to Make You Sleep  By Duf "If I know my answers are boring, am I blameless that they are boring?" Fer   1. What was the last song you heard?     Don’t Know Why  by Norah Jones.  And I'll Bertuzzi any of you punk-ass bitches who thinks that makes me a little girl.     2. What were the last two movies you saw?     Finding Nemo  and  Ice Age .   3.

Here goes:  JM, a manic depressive manager in our office who is in a depressive frame today (and mad at your humble blogger to boot); TR, a Brit who works for one of our technology partners and is one cool bloke, I wish we were mates; CK, our training manager who is somehow nerdy and cool at the same time; HC, who works as part of our Interactive Division in CA (her favorite restaurant is Outback Steakhouse, no, I’m not kidding); and SK, also part of our Interactive Division – a former rocket scientist at NASA who is brilliant but is the worst dressed woman I’ve ever met.

       Friz-iday Fiz-ive by Dizz-e-Jay Shiz-ovelpants    1. What was the last song you heard?   "Scared of You" by Nelly Furtado.  I know, that makes me a little girl, but I don't care.  She's more talented than any of those fake teeny-bopper groups like Shitney Spears, Crapstin Timbercrotch, or Slutstina Aguiholycrapisshedisgustingera.  Wow.  I need to calm down.    2. What were the last two movies you saw?   Starsky & Hutch (eh...it was okay) and Tommy Boy (on DVD).  Some asshole called me Tommy Boy in class last night.  I don't know if he was just playing off of my name or if he thought I was Chris Farely-esqe in my fatness.    3. What were the last three things you purchased?  Jesus.  I can't remember.  I plan on buying a burrito and Futurama Volume 3 on DVD today.  Does that count?  Oh...and maybe a memory card for my PS2.  Wow.  I really sound like a dork.  No wonder I'm going to get voted off of this site.    4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  Study for my test on Monday, have a High Life or two, go to my EVOC class tomorrow morning (8am!), and get fitted for my tux with Dirty Sunday night.   5. Who are the last five people you talked to?   DJ Laura Z, Teddy (a guy at work who loves the vids, too), Jan (our bloated receptionist), CK2, and Jeremy the IT Mastermind.

       Like   urlLink The Passion   but with a Happy Ending   Mark, Bassy, and I (sans wimpy Hal) went to see  urlLink Touching the Void  at the Uptown theater last night.  It was, simply put, amazing.  We all felt like a bunch of sissies after seeing it.  The  urlLink way Kevin MacDonald filmed the documentary  and the true story aspect was  urlLink astounding .  The movie touches on the physical and spiritual dilemma of facing the unknown and overcoming one's fear in order to emerge "reborn on the other side". But the real reason I liked the film is that it's just one of those stories that catches your breath. (I think Bassy was a bit short of breath herself...)  However, I think Mark summed it up best.  Throughout the whole film all I could hear him mumble was "un-fucking-believable."

       More than you ever wanted to know...   I had a great, great vacation.  There are so many places in this world that I hope (and plan) to visit.  But London is just...  very hard to not visit at least every couple of years.  For me, it's a combination of nostalgia and new discoveries.  I had some worries that this trip would be a flop - we were only going to be there 4 nights, we had a Mom with us, we all had our own "must do" list, etc.  Thankfully, my lowered expectations paid off.  My cohorts were Angela (lived with us for about 2 months while we were in the UK, and also my roommate for this stay), Christine (a roommate the whole time I lived there), and Susan (Christine's Madre, truly a good sport when it came to our antics).  Without further ado, here's the blow-by-blow:   Wednesday  We landed in the A.M. and made our way into town and hotel.  The plan was to stay up until at least 8 or 9 pm (easier said than done), so to resist the urge to nap we dropped our bags off and headed down  urlLink Oxford Street  for shopping.  The main mission for Christine and I - getting bras at  urlLink Marks and Spencer  (it's kinda a cross between Target and Marshall Fields).  It's a sad fact that American woman cannot find quality undergarments.  Luckily, we can supplement with trips abroad and no one does it better than M&S.  Mission accomplished, we went next door to  urlLink Selfridges  (closest equivalent here - Bloomingdales) and wandered around to a cafe for coffee and cigarettes.  Revived by caffeine and nicotine we stopped in a few other stores and then headed back to the hotel to unpack and put our feet up (promising we'd keep each other awake).    I should mention here that we had the blessing/curse of forethought, and as a group decided to buy a CARTON of cigarettes when we were going through duty free.  Cost savings?  Check.  Waking up each morning questioning our sanity?  Check.  That said, here?s my closed circuit to DJS - dirty cigarettes in Europe are absolutely delicious.  Formally checking into the hotel was a bit of a fiasco (there's a reason the U.S. gets raves for customer service), so Angela and I went to the other room 'till ours was ready.  Christine, Angela and I watched  urlLink "Father Dowling Mysteries"  on the telly (get it??  I was in England! "telly" - he, he, he!!), while Susan napped.  Nothing like random American television (with  urlLink Tom Bosley , no less!) to add to the surreal world of jet lag.  After Father Dowling figured out the mystery of the maid being held prisoner by her employers, our room was finally ready, so we got our keys and unpacked. Quick showers and slaps to the face were administered and we headed out to dinner.  When I was buying my  urlLink Tube  ticket the (initially crabby) man on the other side of the glass asked me if I was American.    "Yeah" I replied defensively, expecting a rant.   "What do you think about  urlLink Kerry " the man asked, "I think he's going to go all the way!"  I paused, completely taken aback.  Sure, I know Tony Blair, but I couldn't guess who the opposition leader is.  "I, uh, don't know much about him.  It looks like he'll be the one to challenge Bush, though."  Way to put that Political Science degree to work, HAL!! "I think he is just like John F. Kennedy!!" the man excitedly exclaimed. "Well, they are both from Massachusetts" I weakly replied. "I hope he's got what it takes to beat Bush" "Yes, he is like Kennedy, he will beat Bush!" the man smiled.  I then asked the man where he was from.  "Bangladesh" he said.  Then I went and caught my train, guiltily making a mental note to look up Bangladesh on the map when I got home.  Back from dinner we went to the "Glenn Miller Bar" at our hotel for a night cap.  It quickly became our trip tradition to start and end each evening there (it was open 'till 7am, while pubs close at 11pm).  Back in our rooms by 11pm we congratulated each other on staying up past our goal our and fell asleep watching "Sex And The City".  God bless the BBC.   Thursday  Day 2 was our sight-seeing day.  We started at the  urlLink London Eye  - a new attraction for all of us.  Basically, it's a huge Ferris Wheel on the Thames, very close to Big Ben.  It takes about 25 minutes to go around in it and you can see just about everything in London from it.  It's ironic that a city with very few clear days would create such an attraction, but it worked out for us - from there we walked to the  urlLink Tate Modern  (art) gallery and crossed the Thames on the "wobbly bridge" - the  urlLink Millennium (pedestrian) Bridge , a feat of British engineering (installed as part of the millennium celebrations) that was closed for much of the time following the grand opening because it shook and became unstable in wind.  Recently "fixed" we braved it and lived to tell the tale.  That night we went to the play  urlLink "When Harry Met Sally" , recently opened and starring  urlLink Luke Perry  and  urlLink Alyson Hannigan .  It was a crap show (but the good news is, it only cost $75 apiece to see it) with some smart bits.  I thought Luke was (surprisingly) good and Alyson (surprisingly) not good.  However, Luke's performance was greatly improved when he jumped out of the post-coital bed and flashed us his ass (sorry, 90210 aired during a seminal time in my life).  I'm here to tell you - Dylan's still got it!!  After the show, we went back to the hotel bar.  Around midnight, Christine and Angela pulled the lightweight routine and went up to bed.  I stayed down with Susan and we were joined by a drunk Irish dentist named Paul (he was in his mid-fifties).  He bought us a round and started hitting on Susan.  Then he asked us what we thought (or as he'd say it, "taught") of John Kerry.  He also added that he thought Kerry was like John F. Kennedy.  Not surprisingly, he's just as popular with the Irish as he is with British immigrants from Bangladesh.  After an hour or two of Paul telling us how much he loved American woman and making love to woman (one assumes nationality is not important), Christine came down in her pajamas looking for her mother.  When we introduced Christine to Paul, he said, "aye, Christine, I think your mother is a luhhv-ley woman".  Figuring we were alive and relatively safe, she headed back to bed, but not before Paul could ask, "is your father upstairs as well?"  Once we safely untangled from Paul, we called it a night.   Friday  I was on a mission to get stilton cheese as a gift for dad, so Susan and I grabbed breakfast at the hotel (and managed to avoid a hung-over Paul, eating there as well) and headed to  urlLink Harrods .  Once there, we also stopped downstairs and saw a creepy Princess Diana/Dodi Fayed memorial (Dodi's dad owns Harrods).  The memorial consisted of pictures of the two, flowers, the diamond ring (very bling) that he gave her the night they were killed, and most bizarrely, the dirty wine glasses "preserved" from their hotel room.  It was almost like a religious shrine with relics.  Very "ewww".  Afterwards, we met up with Christine and Angela and did a little more shopping.  Then we did the ultimate girly "four girls go to London" thing - we had high tea next to  urlLink Kensington Palace .  After that, we were ready for a night of true (non-tea) drinking.  Last year Angela met 4 blokes from London (get it??  I was in England!  "blokes" - he, he, he!!) while on a trip to Spain.  We met up with them (and a few of their friends) at a  urlLink pub  and then we went to a  urlLink club  full of Eurotrash.  The music was loud and bad (I distinctly remember ?Ice, Ice, Baby? being played).  I talked to a guy from Russia who?s lived in the UK for 9 years.  When I asked where he was from, he said "Moscow".  "So, NEAR Moscow, then?" I replied.  "Yeah, it's sort of the New Jersey of Moscow" he said.  I asked him if he'd been to the States, and he said no.  I guess that they show "The Sopranos" on the BBC.  I made the mistake of going to the toilet, sorry, "loo", that made the toilet in " urlLink Trainspotting " look spotless by comparison.  As if the floor wasn't bad enough, the attendant kept screaming about a girl who had just thrown up all over a stall.  Lovely.  The oddest thing about it all was that all I could think of was "I'm too old for this" and "I don't do this enough anymore".  After many more drinks we left the club and I introduced our British hosts to the distinctly American tradition of the pinky-swear (as a sign of their commitment to visit us in the States, presumably so we can return the hospitality, though we don?t have an exact translation of the evening over here).  In the interest of full-disclosure I am told by my traveling companions that it?s at this point that I announced (or screamed, depending on who you ask), "Bloody Hell!  Where's our cab?"  My question must have gone unanswered as we then started the walk back to the hotel (graciously accompanied by our hosts), stopping half way for take-away Chinese food and eating it in an alley.  Is there anything better?  Then we finally got in a cab for the rest of our journey (serenading our cab driver on the way).  At this point, the wise choice would have been bed, but we went with plan B - the hotel bar.  After another round there (hollow legs, I guess) I said good-bye to the last two of our hosts.  When I got up to my floor the newspapers were already there and I thought to myself, "God, I love London".   Saturday  When I awoke the next morning, I thought, "God, I hate London", and Angela looked at me, laughed, and said, "Bloody Hell!  Where's our cab?"  I returned a quizzical look, and shortly afterwards we had a knock at the door - someone nicely pointing out that the room key had been left in the door the night before.  Just like anyone who's hung-over, I was thrilled at the prospect of hopping a train to  urlLink Borehamwood , the town at the north end of London where we lived oh-so-long-ago.  But nostalgia tour '04 was going forward.  We went to  urlLink St. Albans  first (a little north of Borehamwood) and walked around in a daze, still trying to shake off the night before (or maybe it was just me).  Then we headed to Borehamwood and ooh-ed and ahh-ed as we passed each shop, reciting each memory, and certainly coming across as insane to the locals.  We had a pint (alright, a half-pint, we were trying our hardest) at our old pub,  urlLink The Hart and Spool .  We walked by our old house, and then back to the train and to London.  Earlier that day, the  urlLink big rugby match between Ireland and England was played (in London) .  We knew this because we almost saw someone killed in the Tube over it (Ireland won).  There was also some very foul language, too harsh for me to publish here (plus, I have no idea what they were saying - the British have very elaborate words for "cocksucker").  In my humble opinion, there are better ways to die then getting beaten to death over a rugby game.  There is a reason why the UK has very restrictive gun laws.  We had half of Ireland staying at our hotel, so later that night the bar was like St. Patrick's Day times 10.  For our final night, we headed to the other side of London for an Indian meal (in the east end there is an area called  urlLink Brick Lane ).  We got horribly lost, and it wasn't the type of area to get lost in.  Thankfully we managed to figure our way out before the restaurants closed for the night.  On the Tube ride home, Angela started talking to a group of dread-locked teenagers.  They bonded enough for her to start dancing on a train platform while one of them did a beat-box.    Sunday  On our final morning, we sleepily and almost silently caught our cab to our train and our train to our airport.  And that was it.

       How you doin?  hey folks, sorry to have been a lame-o poster lately. what can I say but...i got my money on my mind and my mind on my money...that's sorta true if only I had more money to actually think about...but I have been preoccupied as I start in on the home stretch here in the land 'o lakes. I give notice on Thursday, folks....I have to admit that it's a little scary but I'm happy to be moving on from here. And besides, I love traffic. ;)   Other things:   DJS  -- not enough room on Pandyland for ya, huh? Or did the hazing finally get to you? I know Duf takes his hazing duties seriously but c'mon...a little stroll through the grocery store naked while tied to Duf who insists you dance for him in the freezer aisle never hurt anyone...  HAL  -- let's spill the London deets, yeah!  Panda  -- the land of no cable isn't all that bad...wait, I'm back in the land of cable again. what am I saying? it rocks!  Duf  -- Hi. don't really have a side note for you, but didn't want to leave you out.

       Fledging Site/Shameless Plug/Ego Stroking   Kids.  I've started a new solo blog (not to say that I won't continue to post here occasionally).  I missed having one of my own, so I did it.  Have a look.  It's called  urlLink I'll Be Dashed...   I'm going to try and maintain it as often as I can (yeah...right).   Side Notes:    Panda  - How can you give up cable?  What about the Sopranos???  Duf  - How's that tux fitting going?  HAL  - It feels like you're leaving out the deets from your trip.  Spill it!  Bass Babe  - Atlanta?  Crazy.  Hope you like traffic!

       My Ass Has Reached Its Threshold   So I'm fighting back...I have cancelled my cable service and have joined the ranks of Hal with "basic" only.  Hopefully this will get my ass off the couch and I'll get to bed at a decent hour.  Plus, I just got a DVD player so I can now rent movies to my heart's content.  What I'm saddest about: no more Queer Eye, E! True Hollywood Story ("The Saved By the Bell Cast" was on last night), and Biography.  What I'm happiest about: no more Newlyweds (that inane show with Nick and Jessica), endless Real World reruns, and The Home Shopping Channel.

       Being back is good (I’m officially broke, and my liver and lungs can only take so much abuse) and it’s bad (seriously – I don’t think I’ve ever had so much fun on a vacation).   I'll have more about my trip later (hands down highlight - Luke Perry's ass).  Breaks my heart to hear I missed the snow… suckers!   Here’s my FF:    1. ...your first grade teacher's name?   How bad am I?  I can’t remember.  I think it was Mrs. Scarp.    2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?   Muppet Babies.  Dunno why, but I just remember being really, really excited about watching it.   3. ...the name of your very first best friend?   Amy Flood.  But she moved away and changed schools.  That’s when I learned the world is cold and cruel.    4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?   Cap’n Crunch WITH Crunch Berries.  Or, Peanut Butter flava.  Also, Lucky Charms and Flintstone’s cereal were perfectly acceptable to the palate.  I once had an allergic reaction (broke out in hives) to Rainbow Bright cereal.     5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?   I grew up within walking distance of my first elementary school (I went there K-3 and was bused somewhere else 4-6).  Every day, school would let out and I’d start the brief walk home.  About half way there, I’d stop, have a seat on the sidewalk, and eat my lunchbox leftovers.  Mom would then pick me up (in a car) where I was picnicking.  To this day I’m not really sure why she picked us (my brothers went there too, but we didn’t attend at the same time) up on the way home vs. at school, or even not picking us up at all.  Typical of most of my weird behavior, it’s only recently that I understand why everyone thought my picnic habit was funny or odd.

       A Friday Ago Five  By Duf Fer   1. Where were you born (city or state or just country)?    Kansas City (I'm going to stand on the corner of 12th Street and Vine).   2. What is your favorite number?   65 (I needed it for Bingo as a lad and got it).   3. Vanilla or chocolate?    Is this a reference to my taste in women? They are both appealing and I have had fun with chocolate, but usually go with standard vanilla. Wait, flavors of ice cream? Vanilla.   4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in?    Fiction (make it classic lit if you got it).  Speaking of which, I am reading "Frankenstein" right now.  Mary Shelley wrote it when she was 19, and it is amazing.  Very beautiful and extremely well written.     5. What kind of mattress do you have on your bed? soft? firm? water?   It is medium.  The main thing is...it is too small.  It is a full size bed, and it is fine for me and Mrs. Duf, but when TinyE joins the show (bed hog of the century), it's too crowded.  We need a King.

       Hey, I Had to Shovel as Soon As I Got Home  By Duf "I miss you all" Fer   1.  ...your first grade teacher's name?   Here is a little secret about Duf.  I skipped first grade.     2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?   I really liked Underdog (and that is cheating because it was not a Saturday morning cartoon).  On Saturday we usually watched Looney Tunes.    3. ...the name of your very first best friend?   Chris.  He is the coolest guy in the world.  Check out the Vitae:  Duke (still sucks) undergrad; Iowa Writer’s Workshop for a Master’s.  Harvard Law.  Ouch.       4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?   I was not allowed to eat pre-sweetened cereal, but I WAS allowed to sweeten my cereal.  Anyway, my favorite cereal was Raisin Bran.      5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?   Play outside.  Kickball, baseball, football, tag, cowboys and Indians, etc.

       I've Had It.   Panda, I hear you.  This snow shit is for the birds.  That's the one thing I hate about March.  Sure, it's all nice and the snow starts to melt again and you start looking for your shorts and what-not, but then BAM!  Like a sack of bricks, another 18 feet of snow jostles you in the cash n' prizes and you slap your head like some backwoods yokel.  'Well, shucks!  I guess winter ain't over after all!'  I'm telling you, if it wasn't for DJ LZ, my family, all my friends, my firefighting gig and a few other things, I'd be on the first road out of here.  That ain't the case, kids.  I'm here for the long haul.  Triple gay snow or not.  What time is it?  3:30-ish? Shit.  I've got time.  Here's my Friday 5.   What was...    1. ...your first grade teacher's name?    Miss Gazda.  This was in Catholic grade school, but man she was smoking hot.  I'm telling you.   I was only six years old (or so) at the time, but I couldn't help but wonder what her boobies looked like.  Is that sharing too much?  Sorry.  These are the things my little church-y schoolboy head thought of.  No wonder I wasn't cut out for this Jesus shit.    2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?   This is going to sound totally ass-wonky, but I really, really liked the Disney cartoon 'The Gummi Bears.'  You're thinking:   Man, DJS.  What's so cool about Gummi Bears?   Well, I'll tell you.  They weren't like the adventures of little pieces of candy running around.  They were like...Medieval Bears and they lived in a forest and they went on adventures and quests and stuff.  It was very cool.      3. ...the name of your very first best friend?   Some kid in my nursery school named Mike.  I can't remember his last name, but we were friends until I moved to a different school to go to kindergarten.  I think I even invited him to a birthday party, but the asshole never showed.  I'm still upset about this.    4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?   Oh, that's easy.  I liked Cap'n Crunch.  Like Panda, we didn't get too much sugary cereals, but when my parents removed the sugar prohibition, the flood gates opened.  From then on, I kept turning to the oval-headed captain in blue for my cereal delight.    5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?    Another easy one.  My little brother Dr. Rob PhD and I would immediately head downstairs to either play Legos or play Atari 2600 until my eyes burned.  Come to think of it...not much has changed.  Well, except for the Legos, my brother and the Atari 2600.

      Let's just say I'm pretty damn jealous of Duf and Hal right now.  Not only did we get  dumped  on last night, but I have to drive through this crap all the way to Beer City in Sconie.  F- me.  This is  almost  as bad as my trip to Duluth for work this past Wednesday.  Almost.  One more thing - I'm already sick of the political ads on TV.  How many more months until November?  Count 'em - NINE.  Thanks, G Dub.  Now finally, a decent FF:   What was...    1. ...your first grade teacher's name?   Miss Hirsh.  She was definitely my favorite teacher in grade school.  She was the kindest, most patient woman I have ever known.  And I remember her very straight teeth for some reason.   2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?   The Smurfs, hands down.  I especially liked the evil Smurfs that would bite the Smurf tails to infect the other Smurfs.  That was Smurfy.   3. ...the name of your very first best friend?   Amy Trudeau.  I hear she has 2 kids now and is living in northern Sconie.  We used to ride bikes everywhere together and played Barbies and Cabbage Patch Kids.  We also were on my swing set all summer long.   4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?   When Star Wars, etc was big, my little bro and I really got into the cereal "C3PO's".  It was kind of like Alpha-Bits.  I also liked Cocoa Krispies.  My mom didn't allow sugar cereals that often, so these were real treats.   5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?   I would always eat a thing of yogurt for a snack (I'm a creature of habit) and then I would watch "Saved By the Bell" with my brother and we would laugh and laugh about how much of a dork Screech was.  Hmmmm, maybe the dorks were the kids watching that gay-ass show?

       Weekend Recap   1) Do not use the valet service at the Loring Pasta Bar.  I got my Toyota backed into and the front bashed in by an out-of-control valet trying to quickly park a Lexus SUV.  They took full responsibility, thank God, but what a pain to find the time to get your car fixed.  The woman who owned the Lexus was typical (picture Edina native, lots of gold and make-up, and a Gucci bag).  After I told her she didn't have anything to worry about since she barely got a scratch, she put me in my place by telling me "my husband owns 2 dealerships and honey, if you get a scratch on a car like this, you get it fixed."  So what you're saying is, you're husband is a swindler and you're a gold-digging whore?  Got it.  2) "The Lord of the Rings Show" (aka "The Oscars") was a snore.  I heard Billy Crystal got good reviews.  He's gotta be paying someone off because he made me groan through the whole show.  As Randy said, "The Oscars wouldn't run so late if they didn't give all the time to no-talent-ass-clowns like this guy."  Yep.  3) I saw  urlLink The Passion  on Sunday (my version of going to church).  The movie kicked my ass.  Hard.  We had to stop at the bar next door for a couple of margaritas afterward.  Here's my take:   Was the movie overly violent?   Yes.  The worst part was 11 minutes of JC being scourged by the Romans.  You can go to the bathroom or close your eyes during this part.  Mel definitely takes it to the limit.   Was it an accurate depiction of the Gospels?   Yes.  Dead on.   Was it an accurate depiction of actual history?   Probably not. You see "Mel's version" of Pontias Pilate who, historically, was a sadist who routinely crucified people without trial.  Mel made him out to be almost compassionate.   Will it make some people reaffirm their faith?  I think so.  I left the theater thinking I really needed to make a better effort and go to church more.  Some people need tragic experiences to reassess their faith.  Some only need a powerful movie.   Is  The Passion  a good film?   It is a great film.  Granted, I may never see it again, but I'm glad I experienced it at least once.  There wasn't a dry eye in the house.   ps  - you'll enjoy it more if you have some knowledge of the Gospels and the Passion story.  Gibson doesn't introduce each character that well, so even I had questions about who was who.   pps  - I liked how Mel took liberties with involving the Devil in the story more than the bible does.  It shows how JC had a choice to stop everything during the entire ordeal (he was tempted more than just once to call it quits), but he  chose  to follow through with his sacrifice.  Ok.  I'm off the pulpit now.  Back to our regularly scheduled lighter program.

       Sometimes I Go Into eBay Looking for a Microbus  By Duf "Right ON" Fer   Here is a "Terms of Sale" description from an actual microbus auction:   Ok put DOWN the haki-sak and listen up. I'm trying to SELL this car. The convention is that the person buying something will hand over some scraps of paper that were imprinted by the government with the words  FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE. They have numbers on the corners. Look around...You HAVE some of these? GREAT! Now look at the numbers and see if when you add up one number from each paper that the total is equal or more than you are going to bid on this. No cheating, only use the number in one corner! Don't count each one 4 times. All set? GOOD! Perfect. You can go from being a bidder to a buyer. That's really cool. What is really UN-cool is bidders that go from being bidders to DEADBEATS. You bid, you buy, you own. Any other way gets you bad feedback and maybe a visit from Rocky and Guido. "Get in da caa, Da boss wants ta talk two's ya...." Make sure that you have your finances in place BEFORE bidding. Don't plan on making a killing with your stash after the fact. Make your deals and have cash-in-fist.  I've got all the woodstock items a person could need so no trades. Once you become the winning bidder you need to grab the skateboard and rumble over to fedex and get me a 10% nonrefundable deposit within 3 days of the auction end. THEN you will have 10 days to get me the rest of the money and I would prefer that you collect your car. CAN it sit here a bit longer than that? Yes but if that is your plan, let me know before bidding. Ask your questions BEFORE bidding! Yes I can take other photos and like that. It is sold as is and all the good stuff and any bad stuff is equally YOURS. Buyer will have to suppy own leather headband,tiedye and purple granny glasses. Buyer is responsable for shipping. Possible delievery on the central east coast for expenses. Check on this before bidding.  Far out......................................

       I'm alive...  getting my ass kicked in my workouts on a daily basis this week has been awesome. I'm tired as hell, but I seem to have no problem getting up an hour early and getting a cardio workout in before class starts (we workout as a class in the afternoon too.) I can say without a doubt that this is where I'm supposed to be. ;)   now if y'all would just move on down here, life would be complete.

       Uprising of the Oldies   Not sure if I've told y'all, but I've been taking a community ed watercolor class every Tuesday night.  Needless to say, I'm the youngest in the class by about 40 years.  It's ok, though, because it gives me a creative outlet and a chance to relax.  At least that was the intent...  Last night's class was a little disturbing.  I got to the classroom early so I helped our cute little 68-year-old German teacher with setting up the room.  A couple oldies trickled in and they were not shy about sharing bodily function stories. "Oh Gladys, I just got my pictures back from my colonoscopy...they look beautiful."  First of all, I didn't know anyone would ever have the desire to see photos from a very invasive butt test, let alone describe them as "beautiful".  Gross.  Then one of the more outspoken students (if you could be any more outspoken than talking about your ass) brought up politics out of the blue.  "If 'that guy' buys his way into the presidency again, I'm moving to Canada."  I heard some mumblings and then some "uh-huh's" in agreement.  One of the women referred to G-W as "The Next Hitler" and someone said "who would be dumb enough to vote for that guy??"  The oldies then went off on a tirade, which I don't really feel like repeating here.  Needless to say, I kept my mouth shut during this whole episode.  OK, let's get a few things straight.  First of all, I took an art class to do just that - art.  I did not sign up to get politically blasted by some 70-year-old liberals.  Everyone has a right to his/her opinion, but what makes me so damn mad about people who get antsy about politics is when they don't take into account that they may be talking to a mixed audience.  I'll admit, I voted for Bush in the last election (I'd consider myself more fiscally conservative than socially).  I'll also admit that I don't think he's the smartest guy to ever sit in the Oval Office, therefore I don't know if I'll be voting for him again.  However, I would NEVER go off on a politician I didn't like in front of people I didn't know.  To me, that's just plain rude.  Especially since I just want to paint a picture of some f-ing sunflowers for cryin' out loud.  Go on, move to the so-called utopia you call Canada.  Then maybe I could paint in peace.

       So A Woman Comes Up to Me...  By Duf "How much money do you have in the bank?"  Fer  I was listening to a radio program last week, and a reporter who was interviewing a rancher asked this question:  "How many cows do you have?"  The rancher replied:  "Enough to eat all the grass.  What, do you work for the IRS?"  The point is that it is rude to ask overly personal questions of people (sometimes even if you know them well).    Anyway, a co-worker gave me a survey and asked me if I would complete it for her class at North Hennepin Community College.  I said sure, without reading it.  Here are the questions...with my answers  SA = Strongly Agree MA = Moderately Agree NAND = Neither Agree Nor Disagree MD = Moderately Disagree SD = Strongly Disagree  Age = 36 Sex = M Marital Status = married Non-marital relationship = no  It is important for men to be masculine.  MD  It is important for women to be nurturing and sociable.  MD  I cry to relieve tension and stress.  SD  I am an emotional person.  SA  I have been abusive to others when I have been angry.  MA  I am competitive when I play sports.  SA  My significant other knows my deepest feelings.  MA  I hold my feelings in when I am with people I don't know well.  MA  I enjoy cooking.  MA  I enjoy the company of children.  MA  As a child I played with dolls.  MA  I think it is acceptable for a woman to smoke a cigar.  NAND  I think it is as acceptable for a woman to smoke a cigar as a man.  SA  I prefer a short hair style for men.  NAND  I think men should shave all of their body hair.  SD  Women should be allowed to be priests.  SA  I feel that it is important for women to know how to cook.  MA  I find muscular women unattractive.  MD  I feel uncomfortable seeing two men holding hands in public.  MD  Men who pierce their ears tend to be more feminine.  MD  Men who get their fingernails manicured tend to be more feminine.  MD  I think women should shave their legs.  NAND  I have less respect for men who have traditionally feminine jobs like being a nurse or secretary.  SD    What do you think is an ideal job?   An ideal job is one that is satisfying, rewarding, challenging and varied.  It is one that provides responsibility, authority and adequate compensation.  A job that provides independence and allows for a balanced life (accommodating other priorities like family and leisure time) is also ideal.   If women held all or most of the political positions, do you think the country would be different?  How?   I don't think the country would be different.  Over the past few decades, a lot of women have occupied leadership roles in government and in business.  I work in an industry with a comparatively large number of women in executive roles.  They are governed and limited by the same success criteria as everyone else (profitability).  It is also true for women in government though the criteria are different (the "greater good", the "will of the people" and re-election).  England did not change under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, and India was largely the same under Indira Ghandi's rule.  Changing the percentages so that women held all or most positions might influence issues or governmental structure, but I don't feel it would change the country.   What do you like or dislike about your gender?    What I like about my gender is...   ...some of the physiological advantages of being a man:  our systems seems less complex, less finicky, and less impactful on our day-to-day physical well-being.  We don't have menstruation or menopause, and our maintenance requirements don't really get invasive until we are 40 or so years old.     What I don't like about my gender is...   ...the same thing I don't like about gender in general.  The role is so weighted down by  constructs and stereotypes - by societal expectations.  Women should comport to Cosmopolitan notions of beauty.  Men should be strong (physically and emotionally) and they should provide (well).

      I know we all get strange requests at work from time to time...from our bosses, customers, and even the mail guy.  I was thinking of what mine have been over the years, so I thought I'd turn it into a Tuesday One.   What has been your strangest work request(s)?   This had to have been during my year stint with a MN-based company where I ran incentive programs.  The first program I ran (for a certain high-profile investment company) was in San Francisco.  It was a trip all the top sales people had won - all expenses-paid.  I was in charge of the VIP's for the 10 days (the CEO, his wife, and everyone in between).  The CEO was not happy with the toilet paper at the hotel.  Guess who had to get him some Charmin?  The CEO's wife had to go shopping.  Guess who had to hold her purse in the couture shops?  On a different program to Beaver Creek, CO we encountered a trip director's worst nightmare: virtually EVERYONE on the trip had lost their luggage.  It didn't matter what part of the country they came from - No one had clothes on the first day (some even went the whole week).  Of course, this was tragic to the women who had no make-up (or dresses, for that matter) for the first night's black-tie dinner, but we heard the biggest stink from the guy whose wife's BREAST PUMP was in their suitcase.  "I demand someone get us a new breast pump.  My wife and kid are dyin' here!"  I thought I'd vomit on the spot.  Guess who got elected for breast-pump-searching-duty in the middle of a resort town?  Yep, yours truly.  After searching all over town, we finally went to a local hospital and got your ol' run-of-the-mill breast pump.  When we gave it to the guy, you'd think he would have rejoiced.  "Thanks, but this doesn't look like the one she had.  I'll let you know."  I had no idea there were so many varieties?  Needless to say, he came back unsatisfied.  "My wife demands a better one.  I don't care what it takes.  This one is killing her!"  Then I heard the best "get your ass fired" quote from my coworker: "Listen, Mr. So-and-So.  If you're expecting us to find a fur-lined breast pump it just ain't going to happen!  Tell her to deal with it."  I promise if I'm ever rich, I will treat all people with dignity.  Or at least I'll never demand a better breast pump or softer toilet paper.

       Some highlights from the best Mankato wedding of the year (considering it's the only one I've been to this year (and the only one I'll probably ever attend), it automatically qualifies):   A most delicious buffet - meat and potatoes shut me up for a full 20 minutes  Duf dancing with me during the 5-years-together-only couple dance (he didn't hear that announcement)  The fruit punch (Duf or Hal could elaborate on this)  The white wine (all I'm gonna say is, I only had 3-4 glasses and couldn't feel my extremities - either I was actually drinking vodka, or someone slipped me a mickey)  Bon Jovi/DJS karaoke - w/air band  Wake Me Up, Before You Go-Go - Molly Ringwald-inspired dancing ensued  My hand ended up in some guy's mouth at the end of the evening.  I guess that's how I said good-bye...in front of his fiancé?  Political debates - did you know  urlLink "The Manics"  are Socialist?  You better.  Retching out of Hal's car window in the rain on the side of the highway.  That was pleasant for all parties involved, I'm sure.  Luckily, Duf was sleeping (but NOT snoring).  DJ LZ sliding on her knees (in her wedding dress - hard core) across the dance floor into DJS' arms.  Dropping all the contents of Hal's bag - whose cell phone is this?  Speaking of cell phones, Hal ended up with 2 extra at the end of the night.  ....Looking back on it now, we should have just stayed in Mankato.  A loud HOLLA goes out to Hal for driving our asses home.  Quote from her: "I've never received more spoken and e-mailed apologies after a wedding, ever."  Photos coming soon.

       Like a Good Neighbor   I'd like to go into detail about the wedding of DJS and DJ LZ, but Hal and Duf would have to fill in the last 2 hours of that event.  It's a little hazy (plus, I caught some weird stomach bug.  The delicious buffet food must have gotten the better of me...).  A month or so ago I got a knock on my apartment door.  This by itself is weird since no one can get into our building without me buzzing him/her in.  I first thought it was my building manager, but to be safe I asked "who is it?"  "It's your neighbor from downstairs."  Immediately I thought "oh crap, he's coming to complain about me making too much noise or something."  So I sheepishly opened the door.    Neighbor:"Hi, I'm Brian.  I live in the apartment underneath you.  I play my guitar at night and was wondering if I make too much noise." Me: "No, I haven't heard a thing." Neighbor: "OK, well if it ever bothers you, let me know."  I think he wanted me to ask more about his guitar playing or about him in general, since after he asked about the noise he awkwardly stood there for what seemed like minutes.  Me: "Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something.  It was nice to meet you."  Door closed. (and double-locked.  Something wasn't right about this guy.)  Last night I got another mysterious knock.  Again, instinctively, I asked "who is it?"  "It's your neighbor from downstairs."  So I thought he had come back to make sure he really hadn't been making more noise.  I told him "I haven't heard a thing.  You're fine."  Neighbor: "Oh good...actually I came up here because I was wondering if I could borrow your vacuum cleaner." (kind of an odd request) Me: "Um, sure.  Is yours broken?" Neighbor: "It's kind of in a transitional phase."  (Yes, he actually said that.) Me:"Ok, here you go." Neighbor: "I'll bring it back in a half hour."  He knocked again in a half hour, and when I opened the door I asked what his name was again.  "Pria."  Me: "'Pria'?  That's an unusual name.  Where does that come from?" Neighbor: (he looked like he didn't want to answer) "Actually, it's my Buddhist name.  But I try not to tell too many people about it.  I picked 'Pria' because I thought it sounded more American.  I try to keep it under wraps." Me: (I'm thinking, 'This guy probably took one yoga class and decided he'd be Buddhist. He's as Minnesotan as the Vikings.')  "Ok, whatever.  But I thought your name was Brian.  Are you the same guy who came up here a few weeks ago?" Neighbor: "Oh, well, sometimes I slip and give people a different name.  My peers have much more Indian-based names, but 'Pria' is my name." Me: "Alright.  Later, then, Pria."  Again, I closed my door and double-bolted it.  "Pria" scares me.

       FF on the Lord's Day    1. Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?    that would be me. but maybe after "Buff Camp" I'd be able to take him.   2. What's your favorite movie line?   ooo boy...digging around in my mental archives...I'd have to say that I don't remember a whole lot of lines from movies so I don't know if I have a favorite, persay....actually the only lines that I can remember right now are from movies that I watched over and over and over when I was growing up, the classics like "Breakfast Club" and "Sixteen Candles". Here are a couple of gems from both:  "Soooo....are you two like boyfriend and girlfriend? steady dates?...luv-ahs?" -Bender "Breakfast Club"  "Dong...where is my automobile??" Dong replies, drunk as a skunk on the front lawn: "Automobile?? (makes car crashing noises) lake. big lake." -Grandpa & Donger "Sixteen Candles"    3. What's your favorite line from a song?   one of them is: "And all this time the river flowed.  In the falling light of a northern sun If I had my way I'd take a boat from the river Men go crazy in congregations But they only get better One by one... One by one..." -Sting from "All this Time" on The Soul Cages   4. What makes a wedding fun and memorable?   the people definitely. and an open bar.    5. What do you daydream about?   Right now it's trying to picture my career as a personal trainer. But a constant daydream I have is playing in a wildly successful and hugely popular band, playing in huge venues to thousands of people knowing our music. to be financially secure in doing that would be just awesome. Or I would also settle for being in a band that opens for bands like U2, Sting, John Mayer, Pete Yorn, Travis...the list could go on and on.

       Odd FF    1. Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?    His bark is worse than his bite   2. What's your favorite movie line?    Gosh, a tough one.  Gotta agree with Panda, “Clerks” has some gems… basically anything Jay says.  For the more obscure yet still close to my heart, I’ll go with “Lorna!” or “I know what you are… you’re a hustler!” from the classic “Mystic Pizza”.  You’d be surprised at how quotable that movie is.   3. What's your favorite line from a song?    Impossible to pick one.  But I’ve always loved the following from U2’s “Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses”:   Took a drive in the dirty rain/ To a place where the wind calls your name/ Only the trees and river laughing at you and me… Hallelujah, heaven’s white rose/ The doors you open/ I just can’t close   You hear lyrics like that when you're 16… and it’s like you invented angst.     4. What makes a wedding fun and memorable?    The people, hands down.  The dress, the centerpieces, the music, the flowers, the booze - all nice, but it really all depends on the happy couple and their guests – are they fun?  Just like any other party.   5. What do you daydream about?    Better question – what DON’T I daydream about?

       Yes, Let's Start Our Own Five!  By Duf "Power to the People" Fer   1. Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?    Oh, it a great play, and I like the movie with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton too. Albee is a genius.  It is perhaps his finest work.  What?  Oh...   2. What's your favorite movie line?    First I have to say that when I read Panda's blog and found out that she was in high school when  Single White Female  came out, and then I thought of where I was at that same time, I felt as old as the hills.  Pause for bone creak, take Geritol.  My favorite movie quote comes from the Woody Allen movie  Crimes and Misdemeanors . One subplot of the movie is that Clifford Stern (the Woody Allen character) is making a substantive documentary that he hopes to sell to PBS featuring a minor philosopher, Professor Levy, who has amazingly profound insights on life (but ends up killing himself, natch).  At one point, the professor says:  "We're all faced throughout our lives with agonizing decisions, moral choices. Some are on a grand scale, most of these choices are on lesser points.  But we define ourselves by the choices we have made.  We are, in fact, the sum total of our choices.  Events unfold so unpredictably, so unfairly.  Human happiness does not seem to be included in the design of creation. It is only we, with our capacity to love that give meaning to the indifferent universe. And yet, most human beings seem to have the ability to keep trying and even try to find joy from simple things, like their family, their work, and from the hope that future generations might understand more."  With a nod to imdb.   3. What's your favorite line from a song?    I literally could pick at least 100.  There are so many lines from so many artists and so many songs.  I will pick a few:  From Wilco's "Reservations":  ...I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say How can I get closer and be further away From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie  I've got reservations about so many things but not about you...  From Bruce Springsteen's "Ghost of Tom Joad":  ...The highway is alive tonight.   But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes.   I'm sittin' downhere in the campfire light  with the ghost of old Tom Joad...  From Atmosphere's (a.k.a. MC Slug) "Shhh" (which is an ode to Minneapolis):  ...got trees and vegetation in the city I stay The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space The women outnumber the men two to one Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day And the jobs ain't really too hard to find In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme...    4. What makes a wedding fun and memorable? (good luck, DJS!)   Play "Summer Nights" and "Brick House" all you want:  never, ever, ever play "I Knew the Bride when She Used to Rock and Roll" and don't ever, ever, ever, ever play a Meatloaf song.  Ever.  I have been to weddings that cost $500, and I have been to weddings that cost $500,000.  For me, what makes a wedding more than anything else, more than the reception, the food, the dress, the DJ, the band, the amount of booze, the fact that the party went on and on until the break of dawn is that there is some moment during the ceremony when the love that the couple feels for each other overwhelms the room.  If that tender moment is present, and it is sincere and palpable, then the wedding, to me, is both fun and memorable.    5. What do you daydream about?    Lots of things.  Golf, travel, writing and ideas, my daughter, my wife, food, friends, co-workers, violence, art, sport, but mostly sex.  If I am being totally honest, then I would admit that I daydream about sex a lot.  In fact, my mind is starting to wander now...

       Our Own Friday Five    1. Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?    Most humans who encounter a wolf would probably be afraid of it, especially if it were big and bad. So the answer is: most humans.    2. What's your favorite movie line?    This is totally random but in high school a friend of mine and I really got into the movie  Single White Female .  I worked at a movie theater during the time it was out, and it was playing at my theater, so we probably saw it at least 10 times.  There was a scene where the psycho roommate, Hedy (Jennifer Jason Leigh's character) dressed up as the normal roommate, Allie (Bridget Fonda) and gave Allie's boyfriend oral pleasure (weird and gross, I know).  Afterwards, when the guy finally figured out it wasn't actually his girlfriend (like a guy wouldn't know...c'mon) Hedy whispers very eerily in his ear, "Hey, Mr. Sleepy Guy."  I actually used that as one of my quotes in my senior yearbook.  Of course, no one got the reference, which is probably for the best.  Another one would be from  Clerks  and is very appropriate for the impending weekend: "Time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!"   3. What's your favorite line from a song?    Not sure if this has been asked before...I think mine would be from the song "So Cruel" by U2 - "And you need her like a drug."  I mean, how HOT is that?   4. What makes a wedding fun and memorable? (good luck, DJS!)   Not too formal, good music, decent food, and an obviously happy couple.  The best weddings I have been to were ones where the bride wasn't going ape-shit over the details, but having fun with the guests.  Oh, and they can't play the 2 dumbest wedding songs ever: "Summer Nights" and "Brick House".  I'll sit those 2 out, thanks.   5. What do you daydream about?    A world made only of chocolate...but what would happen during the summer months?

       Two Episodes In   I couldn't wait.  I cracked open  The Office Series 2  last night and tore through 2 episodes.  All I've got to say so far is this:  Painful.  The stuff that happens in the first couple of episodes made me cringe and then subsequently laugh uncomfortably.  Sheer genius.  I can't imagine what's going to happen in the next 4 episodes, but I'm sure comic hilarity will ensue.  We definitely have to get a group together and watch these things.  They might be coming with me on the plane to hot n' dirty Maui.

       The Extent of My Boredom   You know when you're so keyed up for something (tests) and then when it (midterms) finally comes and goes and the stress has fallen (practical exams) and you're kind of left on idle for a while?  You know how that feels?  Well, that's what I'm going through now.  I was so stressed out worrying about my midterms for my EMT class.  Now, I'm on the other side of them and I've felt the weights lift from my shoulders, only to be replaced in a few weeks with a heavier set (finals) and then after that an ever heavier set still (national registry exams).  So, I needed a diversion.  I found one.  Please see below:     The banana's name?  Nanny.

       I've noticed a theme.    Panda  - moved to Chicago from Mpls. by her lonesome.  Had a hell of a go at first.  Ended up loving it, but eventually came to her senses and moved back to Mpls.   DJS  - moved to L.A. from Mpls. on his own.  Had a hell of a go at first.  Ended up loving it, but eventually came to his senses and moved back to Mpls.   HAL  - moved to London from Mpls.  Had 3 dear friends with her, and still had a hell of a go at first (I didn't know my tear ducts could be put through such strenuous use).  Going there was the best choice I've ever made.  Eventually came to my senses and moved back to Mpls.   Duf  - moved to D.C. from Kansas.  Can't speak for the success of the move, but we all know where he lives today.  Point is, homesickness is not just for 12 year-olds at summer camp.  And it's not all bad.  I think that you'll be feeling a lot better in the next few weeks (unless, of course, you're made ill by traffic).  In the meantime, I prescribe much blogging and phone use.  And cut yourself a break, fight the frustration of not being able to fast-forward.  Bask in the uncertainty (how great is it that you're not staring a cube wall right now?!) and scary-ness (I don't think "bored senseless" comes to mind right now)!  Some day, what you've done this past week will seem unthinkable.  And I think it's pretty great to be in the part of your life while it's all still possible.  My biggest concern... Bobby and Whitney live down there.  They are bad influences.  Please avoid them at all costs, BB!!  I don't care how badly you seek "new friends"!

      So I've got a bit of insomnia this evening. Can't seem to shut the ol noggin down. having some anxiety-causing thoughts about moving, career change, loneliness..you know the usual stuff when you make huge life-altering change(s). I just want to fast forward through this down cycle and get to where I'm going to go, you know? gimme my instant gratification. I made the leap and I want to be rewarded...now. Of course, I know that life doesn't work that way but it's uncomfortable to be uncomfortable. I know we learn a lot about ourselves when we're taken outside our comfort zones, and it's good to really challenge yourself, yadda, yadda, yadda...but those principles aren't all that comforting at 1:43am on a Thursday morning in a strange city without friends and all you wanna do is go to sleep. but this will pass and I know I will arrive at where I'm supposed to be one day. I guess it's just a normal evening of insomnia...

       Scripted Press Conference  By Duf "Trying to be Fair" Fer  I need to start by saying that I although I am a (Big D) Democrat (always have been, always will be - well unless a Socialist Party gains momentum), I do have a healthy list of Republicans that I have liked.  Arne Carlson has to go down as one of the best Governors Minnesota has ever had, and I quite admire John McCain.  Eisenhower and Ford were not so bad, and (believe it or not) I find much to admire in the policies of George H.W. Bush the elder (a multilateralist who was moderate and broke his promise ("read my lips no new taxes") because it was for the good of the nation - in other words, he put our interests above his own, the definition of leadership) and Nixon (he opened relations with China and took us off the Gold Standard).  Teddy Roosevelt basically started Presidential environmentalism and must be credited for the strength of our national parks system.  So I feel I can be somewhat unbiased in evaluating Presidents.  I must also add that my favorite quality in a President is intelligence.  Vision is a very close second, and charisma is a somewhat distant third.  That is why I absolutely adore Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter (not a terribly effective President, but the best former President of all time).  That is part of Dick Nixon's appeal to me.  Yes, he was icky in a lot of respects, but he was brilliant too.  Same with Clinton (who is intelligent, had a vision and had oodles of charisma.  Boy did he have charisma.  He had, as it turns out, too much charisma).    The lack of intelligence that I perceive in George W. Bush and that I perceived in Ronald Reagan is the center of my issue with them.  You cannot lead if you are not able to master the information, retention, strategic and diplomatic requirements of the job.  If you are not the master of all the facts and figures, you cannot grasp complexities and subtleties, and you cannot  connect the dots .   Here is one part of my point.  Reagan used to clear his calendar for two days in advance of a State of the Union address (just as an actor memorizes lines...). Bush, returned from "vacation" last night to hold a "scripted press conference" (not my words) where he visited with the press for one hour and took questions after a 20 minute speech.  The questions were (for the most part) submitted in advance, and the answers were scripted.  When one question was asked off the script, the President replied, without humor, that he "wished you would have sent me that question in advance so that I could have prepared a response."  The question was (paraphrasing)  you once said that the biggest mistake you made was trading Sammy Sosa.  Now that you have been President for three years, would that still qualify as your biggest mistake?   It hurts my heart that our leader does not have the ability to think on his feet and master a wide arrange of facts and information (I wondered during the press conference what he would have done if an unscripted question on Uzbekistan was asked.).  Yes, the mistake question is a tricky question.  Bush cannot admit mistakes related to 9-11 if he wants to be re-elected, and, in order to be responsive, he needed to come up with something that would qualify as a mistake (how about  hiring Paul O'Neill?).   Presidents who don't think on their feet and who lack their own ideas are not able to govern or lead.  They are essentially figure heads.  It all reminds me of the Wizard of Oz when the curtain gets pulled back and you find a diminutive man speaking into an amplifier.  Presidents like Reagan and Bush Light are at the mercy of their advisors.  No modern President can succeed without counsel, and I don't want to be misunderstood, but ultimately, we all do better when the President seeks input and then makes the final decision on what course we will take (see, e.g. President Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs Incident).  I'm sorry, Presidents who spend days preparing for speeches and Press Conferences do not inspire that kind of image for me.

       Fuh-fuh-fuh Friday Fizzy:   By DJS    1. What do you do for a living?   God, I hate answering this question.  I'm a #!$@ing trainer, okay?  Happy?  Oh, but I'm also an on-call firefighter/EMT, so I guess that makes it a little better, doesn't it?   2. What do you like most about your job?  Main Job - Mad freedom - Get to do the 'creative' things around the office (videos, websites, newsletter) - The peeps I work with (Duf, HAL, Hawkeye, The Josh, DJ LZ)  Other Job - Saving lives - Breaking down doors - Putting out fires - Talking to/comforting patients - Driving the big trucks - My new firefighting friends - The list goes on...   3. What do you like least about your job?   For my main job: I honestly don't care about the company.  Really.  I care about the people in the company, but that's it.  I don't get excited about new technologies or new changes in management or name-changes or any of that unimportant crap.  It's hard to get excited about making some big fat slob, that I've never met, rich.  My Other Job: I'll get back to you on that.  So far, I like just about everything about it.  I even like washing the trucks and ambulances.    4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...   Main job: I showed up.  Other job: Someone (especially kids) didn't make it.   5. What other career(s) are you interested in?   Duf's got me pegged.  I want to write for my full-time job.  I don't even need to be rich.  I'd be happy making what I make now writing.  That way I can raise whatever kids Laura spits out and I'll feel more fulfilled career-wise.  In lieu of that, I might pursue becoming a paramedic so that when I jump ship here to fight fires and save lives full-time, I'll be F'-in irresistible.

       ATL in da hizzause  by Bass "Not so Hot" Babe  hiya pandies...it's BB coming atcha live from Hotlanta. (although 55 degrees ain't friggin hot. wtf? I'm movin back) I'm somewhat settled and looking forward to starting "buff camp" next week. it seems a bit surreal that I'm here and this is "home" for the next 6 mos. You think and picture what it will be like for so long that it's strange that the moving day has actually past already. But I think good 'ol Pandyland and all the Pandies will keep me feeling like I'm right next door.   Closed circuit to PB: thanks for the super list, really made my day...right back atcha on #10 :)  FF y'all:  1. What do you do for a living?   hmm...good question. I guess technically the title would be "student/part-time musician/part-time jobber/part-time moocher"   2. What do you like most about your job?   A number of things: Learning new things about something I'm very interested in: fitness Not going to work and sitting in a cubicle all day.  part-time musician gig: I love performing in bars and clubs. part-time jobber: little to no responsibility at work.   part-time moocher: I like the house I'm living in for the next 6 mos (thanks, bro!)   3. What do you like least about your job?   Student: can't say yet. maybe the commute. Musician: hauling gear Jobber: not making enough money for bills  and  savings Moocher: not giving my bro and sister-in-law as much cash as I would like for letting me stay here.   4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...   I'm tired and running late.    5. What other career(s) are you interested in?   Once school is done, I'll be participating in the career I'm interested in right now.   Other careers I might explore in the future: host of a travel show on the travel network. that's a sweet gig, imho.

       The Five - sometimes it seems these questions never vary...    1. What do you do for a living?   My official title is "Project Manager", but doesn't everyone essentially do that?  You're given tasks and need to manage and prioritize them until they're completed.  What a load of horse shit.   2. What do you like most about your job?   I finally have a boss who respects me and thinks I have some semblance of intelligence...although I haven't had a performance review yet.  My company has been known to be a bit passive-aggressive and she may secretly hate me but I won't officially know this until a year from now.  The other thing I like is my vacation - I started with 23 days and plan on using every single one.  Carry over some to next year?  I don't think so.   3. What do you like least about your job?   The industry I'm in isn't exactly the most thrilling.  Case in point: here are a few subject lines from my e-mails..."Renewal Appeal Time Study", "Document Imaging - a Cost-Benefit Analysis", and "Medical Underwriting Statistics."  All sleepers...Case closed.   4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...   ...I'm bored out of my freakin' mind.   5. What other career(s) are you interested in?   If I could do it all over again I would have done something related to medicine - either a pharmacist or dermatologist (the only type of doctor who can't outright kill someone - unless, of course, you misdiagnose skin cancer).  And they make a damn killing by just prescribing skin cream.  If I'd start something new with my current skills/education, I'd go into sales.  I'd have to find something to sell that I really believe in - maybe I'd try dabbling in real estate.

       Friday Five on Monday  By Duf "I needed time to think" Fer   1. What do you do for a living ? I am living the dream, yo.  I'm in middle management!   2. What do you like most about your job?  Hands down:  I like the people I work with.  I also like that I have a lot of autonomy, but the people are what I love about this job.  I work with DJS and HAL, and they aren't even the coolest people here!   3. What do you like least about your job?  I would take a raise if I could get one.  My California counterpart makes more than four times what I do.  I know cost of living is different there, but it ain't that different.  Not that I'm bitter or anything.   4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...  I lose perspective on what is important and what isn't important.  I get frustrated with the machine.   5. What other career(s) are you interested in?  If I leave the real estate world, it will be to become a writer.  DJS and I have the same dream there.

       More Lists - Ode to BB  and  what I've seen with Netflix so far (with ratings!)   As most of you know, our dear Bassy has left the state (temporarily).  In honor of her, I'd like to list the things I love most about her*:  1) She's a kick-ass rock chick. 2) She's the most tolerant person I know (I wasn't the easiest to live with for 5 years). 3) I've never known anyone more forgiving. 4) She got me to like music I never considered before (ie - Sting). 5) She's a great drinking buddy. 6) She always laughs at my dumb jokes (no matter how many times I've told them). 7) She introduced me to a great hair stylist and dog. 8) She's stronger than she thinks she is. 9) Maybe someday she'll kick my butt into gear and be my personal trainer. 10) She will always be one of my best friends.   Netflix?  Go: 1)   urlLink Valley Girl: Special Edition , 1983 (3.5 out of 5 stars) - Nic Cage w/ f-ed up teeth and new wave hair    urlLink Talk to Her , 2002 (4 out of 5 stars) - so weird (there's a scene where a tiny man jumps into a woman's vagina), but very intriguing.      urlLink The Virgin Suicides , 1999 (4 out of 5 stars) - Oh, Sofia Coppola...how I love thee.    urlLink 84 Charing Cross Road , 1986 (4 out of 5 stars) - very "Shadowlands"-esque    urlLink Requiem for a Dream , 2000 (3 out of 5 stars) - made me physically ill and deterred me from drug use for the rest of my existence    urlLink Happenstance , 2000 (3.5 out of 5 stars) - our dear Audrey Tautou is as cute as a button, but the ending is lack-luster.    urlLink Camp , 2003 (4 out of 5 stars) - like musicals?  Then you'll love this.  Awesome score and what talent!    urlLink Pieces of April , 2003 (4 out of 5 stars) - not great until the last 15 minutes.    urlLink Raising Victor Vargas , 2003 (4.5 out of 5 stars) - the Latino grandmother steals the show.   *not in any particular order.

       I Need to Respond, This is My Forum  By Duf "More Discreet than Condi" Fer  Okay, so no doubt you have heard Condoleezza Rice's denial that our affair from August 2nd of 2001 through November of that same year, have any impact on national security.  You also probably heard Dr. Rice's dismissive explanation that "opposites attract" in response to questioning about how she could have a liaison with me when my views are not aligned well with the administration.    First, I want to say that both Condi and I never imagined that our time together would become a focal point for the 9/11 Commission.  We both wanted our love to be a quiet storm, an undetonated bomb.  If either of us felt that there would be national security implications, we would have stopped immediately (although, I must say, we were both powerless to stop it at the time, powerless I tell you, powerless).    Second:  yes, it is true, we are political opposites.  However, in the bedroom.  I cannot tell you the extent of our accord.  There, my friends, we were perfectly aligned.    Perfectly.

       The Greatest American Rock and Roll Band of All Time  By Duf "I've Studied for More than 20 Years" Fer  As you all know, I love The Pixies.  When they were making music, they just had a way of really reaching me.  I still listen to their work, and it still rocks me.  I'm thrilled that they are reuinited.  If only they had longevity on their side.  Many of you also know I love R.E.M.  Steeped in a rich history, and they have been making consistently good music since 1979.  Their live shows are good too (not great, but good)  The Talking Heads were touched by God, there's no doubt about it.    The Ramones, the Beach Boys, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Velvet Underground, The Allman Brothers, Metallica, The Grateful Dead (and perhaps Crosby, Stills & Nash - but not Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (Neil is a dirty Canadian), The Mamas and the Papas on  California Dreamin'  alone), and The Doors all deserve much praise and mention.  I can't ignore Pearl Jam and Nirvana either.  I also have a soft spot in my heart for the Replacements.    I thought about The Strokes, Foo Fighters (was Dave Grohl the genius behind Nirvana?  I'm starting to wonder - no disrespect to Kurt C.) and The White Stripes, but they are a bit too new and until they emerge from the category of artists with two or three really great albums (Soul Coughing and Cake are in this happy place), they will not rank as the greatest.  They have potential though...  I also am not terribly studied on The Flaming Lips, but I like everything that I have heard - how do you start with a discography that long?  You have to give them props for longevity and for being from Oklahoma (quick, name something better to come out of Oklahoma...that's what I thought).    Many people like Steely Dan, Bon Jovi and Van Halen, but I'm not there.    So, the Greatest American Rock and Roll Band of All Time is Wilco.    Think about it. From  AM  to  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , to their collaboration with Billy Bragg on the Woody Guthrie songs, to their collaboration with Minus 5 last year, everything they touch turns to pure art.  When was the last time you listened to  Being There ?  Have you ever seen them live at First Ave?  Ohmigod they ROCK!!!  Also, they never sold out, and they challenge their listeners and take their music and all of music in new directions without really changing who they are.  They pretty much started the Alt Country subgenre.  Their lyrics?  Sublime.  Their sound?  Immediately indentifiable as Wilco.  For this reason, I am nominating Wilco as the Greatest American Rock and Roll Band of All Time.  When I think of American rock and roll, I think of Wilco.  Do you disagree?  Here are the rules for disagreeing:  1.  You must pick a band.  No solo artists. 2.  It must be all American.  Friends, Led Zeppelin was a British band. 3.  They must be a Rock and Roll Band (or else I would have included De la Soul and the Beastie Boys and Parliament).  You will arrive at the same answer I did:  Wilco. Wilco.

       Angels in America  By Duf "Art Lover" Fer  If you have a chance, I urge you, nay…I plead with you…see  urlLink this movie .  I saw the play(s) when it (they) was (were) in Minneapolis several years ago.  This version was on HBO, and I watched it on a video tape that my in-laws lent me.  It is six hours long, so I would encourage you to take it in installments.  Still, this play (these plays), this movie (these movies)…are art.  Kushner won a Pulitzer for the plays, and you can see why:  they are art, pure art.  The conversations about religion, sexuality, race, patriotism, sickness, convalescence, history, politics, conservatism, liberalism, addiction, parenthood, marriage, divorce (togetherness, separation), mortality, immortality, gain and loss, freedom and slavery are simply amazing.  There are moments when it becomes a bit too arty and perhaps too literary (if that’s possible), but it succeeds on so many levels that you are left slack-jawed and amazed.  As I watched it, I kept thinking “I can’t believe one person wrote this.”  The writing is so rich (maybe too rich sometimes) that you imagine some of the ideas were a lifetime in the making.  The acting:  Emma Thompson is great.  Al Pacino is magnificent…has Meryl Streep ever done a poor acting job?  I’ve never seen it.  But the show was stolen (stop, thief!) by Jeffrey Wright (Basquiat) who has to be among our nation’s best actors.   Art lovers, see this film!  Panda, you especially must find a way to see this movie.

      Here's my Taurus horoscope for today:   You're in the mood for some monkey business. Your overwhelming animal magnetism gives you a head start these days, and that's your cue to start swinging. If the man or woman of your dreams isn't available, you'll have no trouble amusing yourself with some passing fancy. Excellent grooming is essential, but it comes naturally. Even if you're just being casual, others see you as a picture of style and elegance. Get an early start on your weekend. With all that you have going for you, there's a lot of ground to cover.

      I've been watching  a lot  of movies lately.  Call it escapism.  Oh, and Netflix is a God-send, people!   urlLink Coupling: Season 1 , 2000 - 1.5 stars The worst!  Ever see "Friends"?  This is a wanna-be, except with stupid talk about sex.  People may think a show could be improved with British accents...not the case for this Brit sitcom.  Also, they weren't even that good looking...don't know what all the hype was about.   urlLink He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not , 2002 - 4.5 stars So damn clever, and with Audrey Tautou you can't go wrong with the cuteness factor.  A different side of her here, though.    urlLink Little Voice , 1998 - 4 stars Jane Horrocks of  urlLink AbFab fame  - the girl can sing EXACTLY like Judy Garland.  Unbelievable.    urlLink Swimfan , 2002 - 3 stars A "Fatal Attraction" for teens.      urlLink Life as a House , 2001 - 4 stars I bawled (but take this from a girl who's cried while watching  urlLink Colonial House  on PBS).  Great cast.    urlLink She's the One , 1996 - 3.5 stars A good sequel to The Brothers McMullen.  Some sub-par acting and predictability made me rate it a little lower.  But Eddie Burns is in it and he's hot, so...    urlLink The Opposite of Sex , 1998 - 3 stars  Lisa Kudrow is great, but I couldn't really get into this film.  It didn't seem to be leading anywhere (not that each film should, but it felt like this one wanted to...does that make sense?).  Forgettable.   urlLink Beyond Borders , 2003 - 3.5 stars  I am surprised I haven't heard more people talk about this film.  It has an importance, but only if you look past the Hollywood-ness of the cheesy love story.  What fascinated me was that it was filmed on 3 continents with a limited budget and they did not try to make the poverty look pretty.  When Angelina Jolie's character was in Africa, she held a boy who was truly starving to death.   urlLink Devil's Playground , 2002 - 4 stars  OK, don't laugh.  This is a documentary about the Amish.  For some reason, I am so curious about this culture - this film highlights the time in a young Amish person's life where he/she must decide whether to embrace or leave the church.  Excellent.   urlLink Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown , 1988 - 3.5 stars  I liked the last Almodovar film I saw (Talk to Her) so I thought I'd give this one a try.  It's hysterically Spanish and Antonio Banderas is young and squeaky clean!   urlLink Tom & Viv , 1994 - 3 stars I'm a fan of TS Eliot, but not a huge fan of this movie.  It was extremely difficult for me to watch.    urlLink Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! , 2004 - 3 stars  Don't hate...I had to throw a teen romance in here  somewhere .  Plus, I love Topher Grace from That 70's Show.  He's so my type.   urlLink All About My Mother , 1999 - 3.5 stars  Yep, you guessed it...another one from Almodovar (no, he doesn't make every successful Spanish film).  What do you want - transvestites, love, death, birth?...you get it all here.   urlLink The Ring , 2002 - 3.5 stars Freaked me out.  Is still freaking me out.  It's freaky....although, when I found out it's a remake from a Japanese horror flic, it didn't seem quite so scary anymore.   urlLink Casa de los Babys , 2003 - 3 stars Terrific cast, but too many characters (or too little time?) to develop even one of them appropriately.      urlLink Italian for Beginners , 2000 - 4 stars Ever hear of  urlLink Dogme 95 ?  This was Lone Scherfig's first attempt at this rather pompous way of filmmaking.   Dancer in the Dark  also attempted to adhere to the Dogme 95 manifesto, but is considered "Dogme lite" because of some "cheating" - it's use of music, the director's mention in the credits, etc.   Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself  is out now, and, from what I've heard from interviews, Scherfig was happy to go to the opposite side of Dogme.  She described it as going up to a buffet line and being able to eat all you want again.  Filmmaking aside, IFB is a touching story about friends and relationships - and it's Danish!  It's amazing when you take the unnatural beauty away from a film, how easier it is to just focus on the characters.    urlLink Ma Vie En Rose , 1997 - 4 stars  So sweet.  And so heart-wrenching.   urlLink L.I.E. , 2001- 3.5 stars  Difficult and disturbing subject matter - not for the faint of heart.   urlLink Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her , 2000 - 3 stars  I didn't love or hate this movie.  It was blah.   urlLink I Capture the Castle , 2003 - 3.5 stars  There is no action, no suspense, and it's a little contrived at times. It is, nonetheless, an absorbing and enchanting film.   urlLink Love Liza , 2002 - 3 stars So, so, so depressing.  Perfect part for Philip Seymour Hoffman who always seems so defeated anyway.

      To keep my mind from wandering (into a black hole of despair) I've been distracting myself by planning some fun into my life.  What's on the schedule?  Let me tell you...   This weekend:  1 day @ Great America + 1 day of skydiving = one dangerous weekend.  I've been skydiving before, so I may just take pictures in the cockpit while my crazy bro and sis-in-law jump to their deaths.  I like taking photos, you know.   June:  Hal and I are flying to Hot-lanta to see our very own Bassy.  We're going to spend a couple days in Savannah (pool or sea-side) and it will be a kick-ass time, I'm sure.  Plus, it's going to be cheap which you can't beat.   Labor Day weekend:  going to London - for FREE (staying with my friend Ian and using miles)!!  We'll also take a detour to Paris for a day or two.  Owwww!  Back to work.

       Bat Mitzvah :  I had a really cool weekend.  I went to my friend Sarah's Bat Mitzvah, and it was deeply moving and very beautiful.  The synagogue really embraced her as an adult member, and her parents and others joined in saying really great things about her.  I have thought about it over and over since I was there.  Two thoughts continue:  everyone should be celebrated that way at least once in their life (and when better than at age 13), and it was amazing to see Sarah carry the Torah around the congregation to receive mazaltov from friends and family.   Cultural Reviews :  I also saw "American Splendor" which is a wonderful film.  Highly recommended.  All the actors do a great job, and it was just a very creative presentation of a wonderful story.  Karen liked it too. Four stars (out of five).  We also saw "The Cooler."  I thought it was uneven, but, for the most part, well done. What the hell, see it.  Three stars.  We also saw "Something's Gotta Give" with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton.  I did not care for it. The script was horrible, and while I appreciate the "bravery" Keaton exhibited in 2 seconds of nudity, I thought she did a horrible job and turned in a thoroughly unbelievable performance.  I cannot believe she was nominated for this work.  It stuns me when I think about it.  One half star.  The artistic hit of the weekend, for me, was the new Morrissey album, "You are the Quarry."  The first three tracks, "America is Not the World" "Irish Blood English Heart," and "I Have Forgiven Jesus" are sublime, and the rest of the disc does not disappoint.  If you don't like Morrissey, this disc will not convert you, but if you come to it as a fan (or with no preconceived notions), my prediction is that you will be favorably impressed.  The opening track is a wonderful love song to America (that is also, like all true love songs, lovingly honest and somewhat biting).  "Irish Blood, English Heart" is the high point of the disc.  So much conflict, so much honesty.  It's amazing.  Track three rocks.  It is Morrissey forgiving Jesus for making him gay in a world that will not allow him to express his love.  Amazingly beautiful.  This disc is Morrissey in a microcosm.  "I Like You" is also a great song.  You laugh because, on the surface it seems maudlin, but as you let it works its magic, you realize that songs have a depth and candor that is rarely seen and that Morrissey is amazing if only for his refusal to change from being who he is even as he knows that most of the world is not ready for him.  Anyway, the album, its production, its music, its lyrics, and the whole package are just very darn good.  Five stars.     Work :  We packed more boxes and prepared to move (coming this Friday).

      I joined a discussion group (yes, an Internet Discussion Group) a while back called 'Movie Geek.'  Gee...can't imagine why.  Well, I haven't been on there for a while, but I thought I'd check in to see what was going down.  Hoo boy.  It's like a virus hit the message board.  What kind of virus you ask?  A porn site virus.  There aren't any 'Movie Geek' posts anymore, just subject lines for very suggestive sites geared to entice you into visiting them.  I'll keep this on the PG-13 tip (and censor when necessary), but here are some favorites:   - I'm not as fat as your girlfriend  - Why have an imaginary GF when you can find a real one?  -  i like to be wacked in the face by c@*k  - P#$%y! Free to good Home  - My boobs are dripping milk. Do you want a drink?  - I’ll brush my teeth with your c@*k   I think you get the idea. I can't imagine someone stumbling across these ads and saying: You know, I would like to brush some lucky lady's teeth with my manhood.  WTF???  Ah well.  God bless America, eh?

       Here's the Skinny   As a couple of you know, I never received a letter from the BU.  So I thought I'd send him a Dear John letter, telling him, basically, we're through.  I sent it (via e-mail, no screwing around here) yesterday.  He responded with a heartfelt note saying how he was so sorry for his recent behavior and how I was still special to him, and he knows he has trouble expressing his emotions, yadda, yadda, yadda.  I thought what he said was all very nice, and at one point I actually thought to myself "maybe I've been too hard on him".  But then at the end of his little note he asked if he could call me on Sunday.  I responded with something like: "Sure, call me, but why wait until Sunday?"  "Because I'm busy every night until then."  Oh, I see.  "Don't you see I'm STILL not a priority to you?"  "I can try calling you tonight..."  To which I responded (as an ode to DJS, these are my exact words, no lie): "Can't.  Busy."  Finally, I just picked up the phone because I thought "How dumb is it that we're having this lame convo via e-mail."  PB: What is it that you have to say to me? BU:  I wanted to see how you were doing.  PB: Ah, isn't that  apparent ??  So what you're saying is, you want to call me so  you  feel better?  Hmmm, selfish again. BU:  I'm not meaning to be selfish.  PB: No, BU, you never have.  How very sad.  When I broke up with someone exactly a year ago, he had some surprisingly wise words to say at the time:  "Unfortunately there's never a good way for these things to end...just varying degrees of bad.  If we were able to see how they'd end, though, I suppose we'd never bother to give them a try in the first place."  True that.

       Facelift?   Friends, I don't know if you're aware, but Blogger has a new version out and quite simply...it's sweet.  I'm wondering if you'd all be adverse to giving the ol' blog a much-needed face lift and adding some of the new features it's got.  There is the potential that we'll lose some of our links and such, but hey...it's a whole new day, eh?  If you give me the go ahead, I'll try to find time in my busy schedule to tinker with it.

       459 Pictures...About 5 of Them Worth A Damn   You know how at weddings they have those little cameras that encourage people to take pictures and such?  Well, we had 'em at our wedding and we went and picked up the photos yesterday from Target.  Now, I'm not saying I'm a pro photographer or anything, but holy jumped-up bald-headed Jesus Christ...people do not know how to take pictures.  Sure there were a few that were pretty decent.  There even happens to be one with 4/5 of the Pandyland Crew that turned out all right...but for the most part?  Absolute shit.  Examples:  - Here's one with DJ LZ's mom in the lower left hand corner looking off into space.  The rest of the picture?  Black. - Ah yes.  The famous split-shot technique.  This happens from not advancing the film completely before snapping another shot.  One half has my uncle's crotch, the other half?  A big spud nose that I don't recognize. - Oh...what's that black blurry number?  That's right.  Someone didn't think it necessary to use the flash...IN A DARK ROOM.  Crazy Kodak.  When will they get it right? - Or there's the DJ LZ's Friend Show, in which every single photograph on the camera was of her friend in the purple shirt.  Hey, that's great.  Now we've got a whole album's worth of pictures featuring her goofy mug. - Oh, cool.  Looks like someone got a picture of everyone jamming on the dance floor.  Wait never mind.  They shot the picture directly in the back of someone who was standing by watching.  Of course, even if it was an accident, you think they'd try again.  Nope.  Can't.  Busy.  Okay, I realize I sound bitter, but I don't mean to be.  It's just I guess we were expecting some sort of composition or consistency in the pictures.  Yeah, they're throw-away cameras in the hands of mostly-intoxicated people, but still...it was kind of a disappointment.  $110.00 to develop the pictures and they were pretty bad.  Let's just hope the real photographers took some decent shots, eh?  Or even the shots off of the PandyCam?

       Exactly a year ago today...   I experienced the same exact relationship woes as I am experiencing now.  I thought a repeat of my post from May 6, 2003 would be appropriate.    Keep On Truckin': Why Not to Waste Your Energy on People Who Suck     Some people are energy vampires. When you are with them or after you depart, you feel drained or depressed. They are emotionally insatiable; no matter how much attention or time you give them, there is always one more thing they need. If you try to help them feel better, they resist and argue for their problems. They don't recognize their ability to generate joy, love, or prosperity for themselves, so they look to others to sustain them. Watch out for anyone who says, "I have so much love to give and no one to give it to." Immediately translate that into, "I am the emotional black hole of the universe, and I will suck every ounce of life force from you if you let me."  Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt.

       Oh What A Night...   Yeah, I realize it's old news now, but I gotta say...the wedding (or the reception, anyway) was a blast.  Crazy times, made even crazier by all of our fun and kick-ass friends.  I have to admit, I was worried at first.  You always get that way, when you throw a party or what-not.   Is anyone going to come?  Will everyone think it sucks?  What if no one dances?   Call me biased, but I think it was one of the most enjoyable wedding/receptions ever...and I wasn't even drunk!  I'm not kidding, I had 2 beers all night and just conveniently forgot to drink any more.  So yeah, the singing and the stupid, stupid white-guy dancing?  All whilst sober, baby!!!   Highlights:   - Seeing our IT guy from work plowed out of his gourd. - Those two crazy asses Nick and Big J in their Superman t-shirts - DJ LZ sliding in her wedding dress.  I was waiting for her to do a backspin, but alas... - The weird Guns N' Roses air-guitar concert that kind of became a much bigger presentation than anyone had thought - The DJ suddenly discovering that it was possible for him to spin the Black Eyed Peas 'Hey Mama' - My friend Benedict informing me that some of the ladies at his table were heading off to the bathroom to 'take pictures of their vaginas.' - The impromptu Bon Jovi karoake...guess I didn't need the lyrics afterall - Dr. Rob PhD (my bro) giving his 'speech.'   "I love my brother and now that DJ LZ and he are married, I guess I love her too."    Lowlights:   - My little cousin that wouldn't well...just leave me the $%$& alone!  Thankfully, she retired early.  So, yeah...great time.  Hawaii was incredible and I wish I lived by the ocean and all that jazz.  I'll give more 'deets' soon.  I'm kind of playing catch-up here at work, y'all.

      Dear Mary,  I don't envy you.  You are either compelled by love of your father or hatred of yourself to act against yourself.  You are denying yourself to support your father (or worse to make a big salary).  I cannot imagine what it would be like to suppress who I am in order to maintain the approval of my father, and I won't even try to imagine what kind of father would ask a child to do that.  I wish for you that your father would love you for who you are, that he would support you as you, and that he would recognize the impact of his policies on his family and on families all over America.  I am an African American, and I am married to a white woman. To understand what you are doing, I imagine that my mother is the Vice-President, and that she was advocating for the return of anti-miscegenation laws.  I can tell you that if that happened, not only would I not support my mother's campaign (how could I?  To do it would be self-hatred, and it would be an acknowledgement that the love I feel for my wife is wrong), but I would work for her enlightenment.  If that failed, then I would work for her opponent, and I would be public about it.  Feel free to use my strategy if you want to do so.  I’m sure that John Kerry could meet your salary expectations.  The big flaw in your approach is that you are not just denying yourself, you are denying others.  It would be one thing if you made the choice to deny yourself in order to maintain peace at home, but in supporting your father, you are furthering an agenda that is aggressively anti-you and therefore detrimental to those gay and lesbian brothers and sisters with whom you share community.   I wish for you clarity and conversion.  I wish that your father would discontinue his hypocrisy (he can’t love you and hate you at the same time – he can’t love you privately and hate you publicly either – to love you, he must love you for who you are and he must do so in all settings), and I wish that, as you channeled your energy into supporting your father, you would work twice as hard to get him to provide for you the full blessings and rights to which you are entitled as a human being.

      Either he's really perceptive or I'm really obvious.  This just in from The Dentist:   I really enjoy being with you.  I would enjoy being with you this week some more, but if your schedule is too busy I understand.  I'll wait to hear from you next week.  If, however, this is a round-about way of telling me you are not interested, I won't call or e-mail and be a nuisance.  I apologize if that isn't the case, but it seems becoming "busy", particularly after a second date, is a favorite way for women to give me that hint.  If it is all the same, I hope I am wrong about that.   It kills me that I find absolutely no spark with this guy considering he could give me everything I ever wanted (houses, cars, stay at home with the kids...the works).  I can't bring myself to do it...as much as I try, I'm no gold-digger.  I'm all about planning certain things in life, but this guy is on a relentless wife hunt and actually told me he couldn't date a woman 35 or older because she would be too old to bear his children. ("You know...date a year, get married, no kids for a year, and by that time she'll be 38 and this decreases my chances of ever having kids.")  The irony in this whole method of thinking would be if HE had slow swimmers.

      In a binge purchasing extravaganza two weeks ago, I went into Best Buy naked and walked out cloaked in PJ Harvey, Sonic Youth and the Beastie Boys.  As I was working my way through each one, I realized it was like visiting with old friends who just came back to town (with a nod to Panda) all the while sneaking some time in with your new best friend (Modest Mouse).    All three discs are immediately recognizable as attributable to the artists who produce them.  PJ sounds like PJ, Sonic Youth sounds like Sonic Youth, and the Beastie Boys haven't changed since they decided to stop fighting for their right to party (not strictly true, Paul’s Boutique is very different from Check Your Head, right?).   The PJ Harvey disc, Uh Huh Her, is fine and dandy until Track 5 when it suddenly decides to get really, really awesome.  My God I want to sleep with her (have you seen the picture in Entertainment Weekly?  It is very, very compelling to a certain mindset which apparently I must have).  Polly Jean just seems so mean and damaged which (for some damn reason) is right up my alley (Mrs. Duf notwithstanding).  But I digress...Track 5, "Letter", may be my song of the summer (which is different from my song of the year which will undoubtedly come from the Modest Mouse CD "Good News for People Who Love Bad News."  Early favorites are: “The World at Large” and “One Chance”) it is just amazing.    If you like Sonic Youth, you will like their new album, "Sonic Nurse."  If you don't, then you really won't.  I like Sonic Youth.  Sometimes I love them.  My biggest problem with Sonic Youth is that I am totally in love with Kim Gordon, and I love them so much more when she is singing lead (which is about 50% of the time).  Still, the album is very solid, and to me, represents the best of Sonic Youth – which is to say a strict adherence to making the kind of music they want to make and (as near as I can tell) for doing it in a vacuum.  I know of no other artists who eschew accessibility and popular appeal as drivers for their art more than Sonic Youth.  Their album “Goo” (“fear of a female planet, fear baby”) was probably the closest they will ever come to radio play and it’s not that they don’t care, it’s more that they don’t consider it.  Best song:  “Dripping Dream.”  God I want to sleep with Kim Gordon.  Do any of you know her?  I do not have a crush on any of the Beastie Boys.  I suppose Adam Yauch comes the closest to my style, but I don’t swing that way (with nothing but love in my heart for our brothers and sisters who do).  But I digress…the Beastie Boys album "To the Five Burroughs" is clean. “Ch-Check It Out,” y’all. There are some rhymes that miss, but that is the risk them Boys take for rhymes that are just plain fierce.  They have an anti-Bush song that I respond to politically, but not musically or lyrically, and there are some misses on the disc (it is hard to rap about post 9/11 New York apparently), but overall, the joy that is apparent as they ply their craft, the intelligence and maturity behind the rhyme, the old skool homage (Ruinite on ice references? E.F. Hutton references?  C'mon that's fresh y'all), and the background beats and bass and sampling is so worth the trip, that when the ride is over, all you remember is the good times.   Just like when an old friend visits after a long time away, right?

      So, my little brother just got from Hong Kong yesterday.  This morning, I got an e-mail from him with 'SARS' in the subject line.  Knowing how funny I think SARS is, I opened it like a fat kid opening his fifteenth candy bar.  Inside was a message that said: "Check out these pics of me in Hong Kong."     Maybe I'm a sick bastard, but I think this is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.  There was another picture (in a different location) where he's doing the same thing.  Yep.  That's my brother.

For BB and Panda, who have not seen me VERY recently, my afro is out of control. I swear to all that is holy that I was going to get a haircut last week, but my stylist was out of town for vacation.  I even tried to go to a barbershop in (gulp) St. Paul (on Selby Avenue no less), but it closed five minutes before I got there.  My daughter's teacher has commented on my hair twice.  I actually try to pack it down before I enter elevators so as not to scare the other passengers.  But it's no use...my 'fro just grow and grow. This week has been the week from hell at work, and I literally cannot sneak away for a trim.  But, today (good Lord willing and the creek don't rise) my last meeting ends at 4:00 at which time I will race to Dinkytown for a much needed bone fade (down to the scalp, ya heard me?).    Until then, right on soul brothers and sisters, and remember, Black is Beautiful.

      OK, here's the thing.  I can't say I liked this movie (critics be damned) although I do admit to liking the message and getting a good laugh.  Michael Moore takes risks.  Michael Moore is over-the-top.  Michael Moore is unabashedly biased, unsubtle, and hates G-Dub with all his heart.  Michael Moore has been blessed with the release of his film being impeccably timed.  He has also been blessed with getting his hands on some amazing live footage of the president, soldiers, and other politicians doing and saying some stupid, stupid things.  However, Michael Moore is not the greatest film-maker to ever live.  This is a film about a man who hates the current administration.  He is not offering solutions to the problem (i.e. - who would make a good replacement).  He is not apologizing for taking things out of context.  He is merely presenting his stream-of-consciousness ideologies.  Good ol' Mikey lost the focus in Fahrenheit 9/11 that he had captured in Bowling for Columbine.  He presents footage in a way that does not flow smoothly, and  IMHO, the film is at least 15 minutes too long.  If it wasn't for the comical music and his dubbed-over voice, I would have become bored during some parts.  I do recommend everyone (except for my father, a Vietnam veteran) go see it, but bring a barrel of salt with you.   ps - If I would have written a real review, it would have sounded something like  urlLink this .

      Of course it was great, because it started out with The Darkness.     What was good:  Justin Hawkins' jump suits, lil' DJS knowing all the words, the eclectic crowd, and enjoying some beverages after the show (thanks, friends, for keeping it all on the DL).   What was bad:  the opening band (sorry...me no likey), the acoustics (thank God for earplugs), and the fact that my stupid ass was in the bathroom when Justin got up on someone's shoulders and played his guitar through the crowd.  F-me.  I ended up having a date on Saturday night: dinner/drinks on a roof-top patio and riding his motorcycle around the lakes.  It truly felt like summer.  Since I was concerned about him driving his motorcycle back in the middle of the night (and at bar time, no less), I let him sleep on my couch.  The dilemma there was: how do I get him out the next morning since The Dentist was coming to get me for brunch?  I told myself I'd be honest with each of these guys throughout this whole process.  But I couldn't bring myself to tell him why he needed to be out by 8am on Sunday.  So I lied.   "I'm going to church."   Let's hope the God I believe in is a forgiving God, otherwise I'll see y'all in hell.

      I thought it would be funny if I put a picture up of me with the Oscar Mayer wienermobile. Big mistake.  I've been getting an assortment of responses because of it, the most recent being:   "You want to see a REAL Wiener?"   Thanks, but no thanks.

      Just to clear things up:   The Cuddler  = the guy who has his fingers on his mouth in his picture, aka "cuddlingryan", aka "are you still interested?"   Drama Queen (DQ)  = the guy who's coming to the show tonight.  I've seen him the most, but mostly because he asks me out the most and bugs me a lot.  But he likes cool music, so I'm trying to deal.   The Dentist  = if any guy is going to "rise to the top" so to speak at this point, this one seems like he has that potential.  He's got his stuff together, and he helped me put on my coat last night.  Plus, I gotta get DJS invisalign.   The Pilot  = the guy with the fake photo below who is too incredibly well-rounded to be for real.  We may go out for a drink next week.   Apple Guy  = works for Apple computers.  He's probably e-mailed me about 10 times or so...I'm sorry, ask me out already, otherwise I don't have time to e-mail you anymore.  can't. busy.   U2 Fan  = in my profile title, I make a kind of obscure reference to my favorite band.  This guy is the only one who got it.  We've e-mailed, but that's about it.  There are a myriad of others, but I don't feel like typing anymore...plus, I have a stupid meeting I have to get to.  Hope that helps.

      No, I'm not talking about the Carlos Beltran trade.

      I needed to post before this site became "all Panda, all the time". :)  Georgia was great fun, though not as low-brow as Panda makes it sound.  We got a Styrofoam cooler with an American flag on it, reflecting our deep love of country.  We gladly held the elevator door for fellow hotel guests, certainly preventing unnecessary death/decapitate - it was a very angry door.  And we spent Sunday morning checking out the proud historical sites of Savannah.    Upon returning, I went to  urlLink The Streets  show at the Fine Line on Monday night (along with Panda and Markie-Marc).  It was a good show... amplified by Marc's massive enthusiasm.  Incidentally, I picked up the  urlLink second "Streets" album  whilst at the show... I am LOVING it -  A Grand Don't Come For Free .  I thought the first album was fun, but the latest kicks ass.  It's a "concept album", a phrase which instantly turned me off - "concept album" being a pseudonym for "indulgent crap music".  But this is cool - the whole album tells a linear story that takes place (one assumes) over the course of several weeks/months.  Each song stands on it's own, but reference situations in other songs.  Plus, it's odd to hear such a heartfelt love song such as "Dry Your Eyes" from a young, cocky, drug-fueled rapper (though I think he's better described as a "spoken-worder").  Tomorrow night is  urlLink The Darkness .  Can't wait.

      I think I may wait a day or 2 to respond, but next week should be real interesting.   Hello,  Yes, I live in Stillwater, and yes I go to Minneapolis all the time. I work in Plymouth, so I pass through it every day to and from the office. I also like going out downtown with friends to clubs, restaurants and sporting events.  Maybe we could get together for a drink after work next week.   Let me know,  Jeremy   It's amusing how he makes a point to let me know he's soooo well rounded.  Oh, and I'm supposed to go out with a dentist tonight.  Anyone need a teeth cleaning or bleaching?

      Remember "cuddlingryan" (refer to Friday, June 11th archives)??  Well, I just heard from him again.  All he said in his note was:    Are you still interested?  Ryan    Translation: I'm bored with these other hussies I've been meeting, how 'bout it?   So, in order to stay true to my mission here, I told him "Why not?".  The sacrifices I make for you people.  Egad.

      he already responded!   Hello,  Funny you should ask what my favorite destination is because you just moved back from there. Yep, the windy city tops the list in my book, well, Wrigley field to be exact. I'm a huge Cubs fan. I used to live in Schaumburg, IL. for about two and a half years from 1995 to 1998. I was a restaurant manager for the Rainforest Cafe at the Woodfield Mall. Like yourself, I moved back because I missed Minnesota, my friends, family and the great camping, boating, downhill skiing, state parks, waterways and trails here. I'm a huge outdoorsman and do a lot of camping, hiking, and backpacking as well as running the trails at Taylors Falls and hanging out on the St. Croix river near my house. I loved Chicago for the entertainment and night-life, but it has nothing to offer in the way of esthetics; it's really not a very pretty state. There are no hiking trails, forests, downhill skiing hills, and little water besides lake Michigan there either. I think it's a great place to visit, and I try to get back there a few times a year, but I don't think I would never live there again, unless I could live accross the street from Wrigley!  Anyhow, I also like to travel to Hawaii, Mexico and Colorado and have been to each of them three or four times.  I really like your profile and it looks like we have a few things in common. Would you be interested in meeting sometime? Maybe we could get together for a drink after work sometime.  Talk to you soon,  Jeremy   So I told him I'd be up for that.  My coworker let me know that if we ended up meeting, she'd hide out at the bar with a camera to get his dirty mug on film.  Hoo-ha!

      Like this guy:   "Pilot seeks copilot"       I am new to this whole internet dating thing, but it seems like the only decent way to meet people at my age. I am extremely active and enjoy boating, downhill skiing, motorcycling, rock climbing, kayaking, bicycling, lifting weights, running, playing softball, basketball and golf. I own a house near the St. Croix river, but I'm rarely home as I travel often and spend most of my time outdoors in the summer, either out boating or just hanging out by my pool.  My friends would describe me as an outgoing, athletic, hard-working, driven, succesful, loyal, grateful, generous, educated, fun-loving guy who takes nothing for granted.  I am looking for a girl who likes to have fun, doesn't take life too seriously and is not stressed out. Life should be fun, and you should love to laugh, travel and just enjoy all that life has to offer.    But what is even more unbelievable than his profile is his picture.  Where did he get that chach shot, from the Sears catalog?  Sheesh!  I just got a note from him - should I reply?  Any suggestions?

      Wow - we had a great time.  But I have to say, put the three of us together (Bassy, Hal, and yours truly) and it will lead to sick, sick behavior.  I always knew I had the inclination to take situations/conversations to the limit, but Hal and Bassy sure gave me a run for my money.  Our talks turned filthy, vulgar, inappropriate, uncouth, and downright smutty.  We also really enjoyed the Waffle House and the Huddle House restaurants.  Grits, anyone?  Here are a few examples of our obscene conduct:  1) Before we went out one evening in Savannah, Hal was hanging out on our hotel porch (second floor, overlooking the pool) for a while by herself (with a cocktail, of course).  After a half hour I went out there to see what was happening: "What are you doing out here?"  Hal: "Oh, I've just been watching that dry-humping couple in the pool."  Believe me, we couldn't stop staring - it was foul, and there were young children nearby.  The term "dry humping" later became the theme phrase for the rest of the trip.  2) After it gets to a heat index of about 110, one may find it difficult to describe that kind of heat (especially while sitting on the beach with no umbrella).  But I somehow found a way to explain it just right: "It's hotter than a sweaty ballsack after a long run."  Now, I don't actually  have  a ballsack or anything, so I could be wrong.  3) We found a great sign at a gas station in Dublin, GA: "Wash and Lube: Enter in Rear".  That got at least a half hour of hearty chortles, especially after Hal took a picture of me in front of it, with my back to the camera.  4) Our beloved Bassy met a fella (at a place called "The Bar Bar" - huh?) and on our drive home something happened in the backseat of her Mazda that is too risqué to even describe here.  :)  However, that incident was perfect for us to bring up the term "dry humping" again.  5) We watched Zoolander before we went out one night and I was dared to go up to a guy and say "You can dere-lick my balls cap-i-tan."  I chickened out.  And we also couldn't get Bassy to holler "The South will rise again!" (in a thick Southern accent) - even through that would have been completely appropriate during her backseat escapade.  It was fun and laughter for 3-1/2 days straight.  Thanks, girls.

      I just got a note from a couple creeps.  It's interesting to figure out how to translate these things after you've seen a few of them.  Title of his profile: "Attractive guy wanting attractive girl!!"   Translation: shallow   User Name: "athleticbusyman"   Translation: only wants to have fun; no commitments   Marital Status: "separated"  Translation: I'm cheating on my wife.   No Photo listed.  Translation: I don't want my friends and/or wife to see I'm using this to get chicks on the side.   Profile: "I'm looking for a fun, attractive, and fit girl who is looking to have a good time and not looking to force something to happen. My ideal date would be to hit it off with a girl who has a mutual attraction to me, while not leting her shyness stand in the way of something great. A physically intense relationship is ideal, so please don't be affraid to e-mail me if you like to rattle the headboard from time to time. I'm an honest, good-looking, nice guy,(not a sick-o), and hope that you don't pass me up. I'm pretty sure I'm worth the effort. I look forward to talking to you soon!!!!!!!!!!!!"   Translation: None needed...it's obvious he's a perv. (physically intense? keep on truckin'.)   A different guy's profile: "I'm a nice guy, so deal with it! Your going to have to accept me the way I am! lol! I just can't be mean to women! Not in me! I like to treat them like a lady, not dirt! I have 2 kids, 1 by my ex and 1 by a previous relationship, so yes I have some drama in my life but nothing I can't handle! I love my kids and am not willing to move far from this area. I like going to movies(sappy and romantic is good with me!) dance(slowly so I can hold you close), play pool(I'll teach you if you want me to), sing karaoke(not always in tune but much better than some drunks that get up there and do it!), and most of all, I love to snuggle! I'm a teddy bear made of cushion on top, and steel underneath(ask me about that). If you are interested, please respond to my ad!  My ideal match? hmmmm.... I guess she should have a heart and a pulse! lol! But truly, no control freaks! It's a major peeve of mine! Neither one of us should be in control, we should be equal partners and be rule our kingdom together. I love a woman whom can dish out compliments as well as receive them, not deny them and tell me they don't deserve what I'm saying,that's a peeve of mine as well. She should be confident in the way she looks, whether she's overweight, too tall, or whatever, I am a man of internal values, it's what's inside that counts, the outside is just the shell of your soul. So show me what your made of!"   Translation: Too many exclamation points = trying too hard.  If a guy uses the acronym "lol" -especially more than once- no thanks.  And we found ourselves yet another snuggler, but at least he has low expectations (a heart and a pulse??).   Snugglers and cuddlers abound on these sites.  That is the one thing that I'm sure of.

      Without going into too much detail, here's the breakdown of my Friday night date-o-rama:  1) We did a little bar hopping: Uptown Bar & Grill, Figlio's happy hour (choice), and Bilimbi Bay for a view and a margarita.    2) Along the way we also stopped at Tonic - since there wasn't a line, we went in.  When we found out there was a cover, we turned around to leave, and ran into Lee Jeans and friends.  In an awkward moment, I hugged Lee and his buddies and then introduced them all to my date.  First dates are stressful enough, even without running into ex-boyfriends.  3) On the drive home, my date expressed a desire to go to the bathroom.  I suggested we pull over by Lake Harriet...hey, I could care less and it was dark enough.  Unfortunately, it was a little too dark, and he ended up almost taking a swim - he fell into the lake up to his knees.  Hilarity ensued.  4) We went out again on Sunday.    Not sure what to do with the others who have expressed interest, but this guy seems to be a-ok.  Despite my preconceived notions of meeting some real clowns, I seem to be enjoying myself.  As an interesting side note, a friend of mine in Chicago ran into stupid ol' Randy yesterday, and boy did she let him have it.  It's great to have good friends who will rail your ex-boyfriends for you. :)

      I just got an e-mail out of the blue from a guy who calls himself "cuddlingryan".  I have never e-mailed this guy before, so I was quite shocked to read he already wanted to take me out.  Ya think he wants some skin?  Um, yeah.   I love your profile! If you would be interested I would like to take you out sometime. I'm romantic, athletic, and love to cuddle, not to mention give great back massages! Well hope to hear from you soon!     Ryan oxoxoxo   What's with all the xoxoxoxo's??  And it sounds like he  really  likes to cuddle (aka get women in the sack) considering he can't stop talking about it.    (note the inquisitive "finger on mouth" look)  So...I responded saying "when and where?".  Folks, this one should be good.

Anyway, I'm actually kind of excited...this is a very strange world I've entered into.  I've also been "talking" to some other fellas...one in particular who works for Apple.  Perhaps he can get me a deal on the computer I've been dying to have?  Deets next week.  Over and out.

      I am growing a beard.  It will meet its premature end on Sunday night.  I like beards.  Left to my own devices, I would have one all the time.  Why? Because I like them.  Also, they are much easy than shaving, and I don't have to worry about ingrown hairs, razor burn, etc.  I also think that I look a wee bit better with a beard than without.  That's just my opinion.    Beards are not doing well in America these days.  It has been the case for a long time.  Mustaches are fine.  Goatees are de riguer, but beards for some reason are not favored.  I don't know if it is because of a tie to fundamentalists, or mountain men, or what.  I do know that the company I work for has a policy against beards.  This always amazes me.  No other hair policy exists.  Theoretically, I could come in sportin' braids, but I should shave.  I could dye my hair blond, but I better come in with a hairless chin.    My boss is not much for beards either.  I could tell by the way he looked at me when he first saw me this week.    Mrs. Duf hates a beard with the best of them.  Which is, of course, encouragement in the other direction.    I once saw a 60 minutes piece where Ed Bradley was profiled in an airport because he bought a ticket the day of a flight, was black, paid cash and...that's right...had a beard.    It just seems odd to me that multiple Presidents have had beards.  Jesus had a beard, and so did the entire Allman Brothers band.  Yet for some reason, they are frowned upon.  So here's my plan: as soon as I retire, I'm growing it out.  Big, bad and beautiful.  Just like nature intended.

      Our little Panda is going on a date.  What a difference 24-hours makes.  I've had several clowns contact me (one of them had a picture of himself with a hockey jersey on giving the thumbs-up...it was hard to see, but I think his teeth were yellow), but there have also been a few gems in the rough.  One of them just asked me out, and since he used the word "libations" in a sentence, I might just have to go out with him.     "Perhaps we should get together and pontificate over the merits of our lovely metropolitan area here, or maybe even to enjoy one of the interesting local shows along with the requisite libations and such?"   How could I say no?  And to make it interesting, I may have to get back to yellow-teeth guy too.  You know, just to mix it up.  Wouldn't want to let my readers down and all...

      No, this isn't another link to something Jesus related.    I'm just thinking it's high time we put together another Pandyland Burrito Jamboree.  I mean, what's the deal?  Panda has been back in town for months and we can't seem to put anything together.  I think we need High Life (okay, maybe just me), karoake, and a dirty, filthy bar.  Who's with me?  Oh, I guess 4/5 of us are going to see these guys in a couple o' weeks:     You know...I really do believe in a thing called love.  Don't believe me?  Just listen to the rhythm of my heart.

      Sometimes I think the moment I become single, "I AM SINGLE" is immediately emblazoned on my forehead for only assholes to see.  I was out with my charming lesbian friends on Friday, making me the token single hetero woman in our group for the weirdo guys on the prowl to talk to.  It was like flies on shit.  Asshole: Do you mind that I smoke? Me: If you're asking whether or not I think it's gross, I think it's gross. Asshole: But honey, don't worry.  I won't smoke while we're in bed!  Heaven help me.  I'm surrounded by idiots.

      When I was in high school, I had the great good fortune to be among a group of 100 young men who participated in a mock government program in Washington D.C.  As part of our week in Washington, we laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and we saw one of those precision military rifle groups. The high point of the week was a visit to the White house where we met Reagan in the rose garden.  I spent the early part of the visit day waiting to see him so that I could pound him with difficult questions and prove that he was an empty suit.  "Mr. President, you claimed that ketchup is a vegetable..."  "Mr. President, you indicated that there is no homelessness in America, I wonder if you would accompany me..."  "As regards your Star Wars missle defense system, Mr. President..."  We got to the White House, made it through elaborate security, and waited for him in the rose garden where I had the best lemonade I have ever had in my entire life.  He finally came up, and I walked toward him to ask a question.  When I got there, he shook my hand, looked me in the eye with those piercing blues (by the way, he smelled great, and had the broadest shoulders I have yet seen) and started telling a story about young men and horses (I missed his point).  There are few men that I disagree with more than I disagreed with Reagan, but I have never met a more charismatic man in my entire life.  I walked in wanting to slay him with my rage, and, had he asked me, I would have campaigned for him that afternoon (within a few days, I reverted to form, but still).  I will never forget that meeting.   The new Modest Mouse CD "Good News for People Who Like Bad News" is out.  It comes recommended to me by my friend Brian B., of Columbus, Ohio.  I have only given a few preliminary listens, and I will promise a full review later, but I can tell you, it has potential to be my album of the year.  A little Wilco, a little Flaming Lips, a little Frank Black.  I particularly admire track two:  "The World at Large."  I went to Perkins for lunch.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich to go.  The good people at Perkins were kind enough to include a little cup of cole slaw.  It was great. I know there are some haters in the land, but for my money, cole slaw is the best possible presentation of cabbage.

      I think we need to add a little more spice/interest to the site.  Or maybe I'm just bored.  Regardless, I have a proposition to make.  I thought about joining Match.com.  Not to meet "that special someone", but to go on (mostly horrendous, I presume) dates, and then spill all the gory details here.  Would anyone be interested in that kind of journalism?  Just wondering.  Signed, PB

      It's not me wearing a mullet, but you still must  urlLink check this out .  And do yourself another favor by clicking on the " urlLink clown " and the " urlLink truck driver ".  Is it just me, or does Jesus seem to be pissing off most of the people in the pictures.  For instance, I don't think the  urlLink carpet layer  appreciates Christ's technical advice.  I think the  urlLink bank teller  is about to turn around and go off on him.  And c'mon, he's blatantly getting in the  urlLink barber's  way!

      All right, it's been some time since we got a picture all up in here, so I present this nugget from the past:     There was a time when mullets were king.  There was also a time when I bought my car for $300.  This time was captured on film and will haunt me for eternity.  Here I posed with my beloved 74 Oldmobile Cutlass Supreme which I affectionately named 'The Missile.'   DJS, why the wistful look?   I had to 86 the car for my blue pickup.  Moments after the picture was taken, a scrap collector came and took 'The Missile' to that great automobile graveyard in the sky.    Alas, old friend, I hardly knew ye.

      It's like  urlLink everything I know is wrong .  Does this mean that Bono DID NOT die for our sins?????   U2 is yet another very worldly, ungodly band claiming "Christianity". Their lifestyles reflect their music full of promiscousness, drinking, depression, base profanity and cryptic, double meanings that leave their listeners wrapped in a "what does this song mean" mystery.

      As rainy as it was, we still ended up having a grand ol' time in Wisco.  My little brother and sister-in-law forced me on every major rollercoaster at Great America.  We, of course, saved the best for last:  urlLink Superman .  You are strapped into the seat and then literally turned head-first into a "flying" position.  I just about crapped my pants as we inched up (your whole body faced the ground) to the first major drop.  At one point the ride goes through a loop that has you riding on your back, facing the sky.  That's so not right.  How my brother summed it up: "Dude, your body is definitely not made to be subjected to that kind of G-force."  It was killer.  We wanted to go skydiving the next morning but our plans were foiled with the incessant rain.  So we all went to a  urlLink movie  instead.  This was not my first choice, but I wasn't paying so I had to go along.  Now, I'm all for the latest action/thriller/destruction flick with cool special effects, but this film had some "dramatic" parts that were so over-acted it was comical.  I know going in I shouldn't expect Oscar-winning performances, but I did expect more from Dennis Quaid.  Here's a quick break-down...   What was good:  - The special effects - the realism of the destruction of the cities and the progression of the storm was great.  Seeing the Statue of Liberty get pounded by a huge tidal wave had terrific entertainment value. - Jake Gyllenhaal = eye candy - The guy who played the Vice-President of the US looked a lot like Dick Cheney - just a little taller, and just as big of a weenie.   What was bad:  - The token bald kid with cancer with the unresolved ending - you know, because for a drama to be heartwrenching, some kid has to have a terminal disease! - As my very nurturing mother kept pointing out during the snowstorm scenes: "Dennis Quaid is never wearing mittens!"  Bundle up, fella! - After Dennis Quaid's character figured out the potential end-of-humanity storm was on its way, he took the time to make a couple of cups of coffee and talk about "the good times" with his wife.  Yeah right. - How they tied in 2 love stories was so damn contrived.  But at least it gave the movie some other subplots to distract me from the kid with cancer. - The wild wolf scene - so fake it was funny...plus, they didn't need this scene anyway.  But who cares!  Take this one for what it's worth...a summer movie with entertaining visual effects.

      Every few weeks or so, when I'm on my way to work, I notice a certain car and groan.&nbsp; It's a very&nbsp;expensive, flashy&nbsp;Lexus convertible with a vanity plate that says "hotluvr" or "sexguy" or something on it.&nbsp; The driver is a short (we're talking head barely over the steering wheel), bald, very tan,&nbsp;middle aged (is 55 still middle age?&nbsp; Or is it just old??) man.&nbsp;   No, I'm not making this up.&nbsp; Yes, it is straight out of the short/bald/sad-man mid-life crisis book.   Anyway, yesterday I noticed a new touch.&nbsp; He got those spinning "dubs" or rims, or whatever they are called, put on his car.&nbsp; By doing so, I think he's crossed into a whole new world of pathetic.&nbsp; If he has kids, they must be mortified.

       This pretty much sums it up...taken from today's L.A. Times.     A turning point for the nation    By Barbara Boxer    EVERYWHERE I go, I hear the same thing: "This is the most important election of my lifetime."   I think I know why. We are broke, and current policies are digging us deeper into debt. When President Clinton handed the Oval Office keys to President Bush, we had a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion. Now we have deficits and debt. Our-go-it-alone policy in Iraq has isolated us from our allies and placed the burdens of the war on the backs of American taxpayers and our men and women in uniform.   The rollback of more than 350 environmental policies and regulations is leading us toward dirtier air and water, more cancer, more asthma among our children, and a loss of our pristine lands. The No Child Left Behind Act is turning into a hollow, empty promise to millions of children.   Then there are the terrorist threats -- this administration holds a press conference about these threats on almost a weekly basis. But where is the plan to protect our people and to catch those who would do us harm?   Congress is ready to move on Homeland Security. There is a rail security bill that is waiting for full Senate action. There are also port, nuclear, and chemical security bills that the Senate Majority Leader can call up whenever he pleases. Surely he would focus on national security after Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned that Al Qaeda was planning another large-scale attack.   But no. Republicans and the president want to talk about an issue they consider more important than saving American lives from another terrorist attack: more important than education or deficit reduction, more important than our kids getting asthma or our sons and daughters losing their lives and limbs abroad. The issue: a constitutional amendment on marriage. Yes, this is the most important election of our lifetime.   We need to get our priorities in order. We can start by electing John Kerry president.    Barbara Boxer is a US senator from California.

      hi folks,  the resident Atlantan decided to actually post! I've been checking the site most days and glad to&nbsp;read you all are holding up the web site discussion group quite nicely. this will just be a brief update from my neck of the woods:    1.  I got myself a job. So it's the end of&nbsp;the "After School&nbsp;Couch Project"&nbsp;officially. God I loved it while I had it, but it's time to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;and get some cash in the dwindlin bank account. and I'll also be getting some fitness work for the 'ol resume.    2.  I went out for my first night on the town with  friends  last night. That's right, I said friends. we did some boozing in the Virginia Highlands part of town&nbsp;and had some good times. Although I am generally not a "go out all the time" kind of gal, I miss being able to call up people to hang out for some drinks, music and conversation. So it felt pretty nice to enjoy the evening. And the Atlanta men were quite the sight for sore eyes...which leads me to #3...    3.  I'm done with stupid internet dating. I signed up to meet people when I moved here and if I hadn't met Isaac (drinking and band buddy) it would have been a total bust. Jebus. I suppose my rules of not dating Confederate-flag-totin, ZZ Top-beard-wearin, guys-who-can't-form-a-coherent-sentence really limited me. I'm an independent babe and if I think someone is attractive, I have no problem initiating the conversation (this is over email, for crissakes) but so far NOTHING.&nbsp;Are the girl/guy roles are different in the South??   Anyways, things are going real well here. I miss the 'landahz very, very much and look forward to a jamboree soon (pending airline prices!) take care y'all.  -BB

      Perhaps F9/11 just&nbsp; urlLink whetted&nbsp;your appetite  ?   Check&nbsp;this one&nbsp;out at a Landmark Theater near you on July 30th.  &nbsp;  With regards to F9/11: I&nbsp;never said&nbsp;F9/11 is not an important film (it is), but&nbsp;as a documentary-junkie I couldn't live with myself and&nbsp;say it was the&nbsp;greatest  documentary  ever.&nbsp; IMHO, it is an entertaining and powerful FILM only.&nbsp; Go see&nbsp;Winged&nbsp;Migration, Spellbound, Capturing the Friedmans, Touching the Void, or even&nbsp; urlLink The Lost Boys of Sudan   for examples of some top-notch documentaries.&nbsp; (Side note: I hear&nbsp; urlLink The Corporation   is not to be missed.&nbsp; I plan on RUNNING out to see it.)  &nbsp;  With such a powerful subject at hand in F9/11,&nbsp;I believe it is difficult for those so vehemently&nbsp;in agreement with Mikey&nbsp;to also be&nbsp;opposed to his method of filmmaking.&nbsp; He is crafty and clever, yes, but I wouldn't say he is artistic.&nbsp; His documentary is more ranting and raving than effective filmmaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is&nbsp;sloppy, illogical and formulaic,&nbsp;which&nbsp;begs the question: Can a hatchet job actually elicit  sympathy  for its sitting-duck target?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I do understand that wasn't his point (to be artsy).&nbsp; I'm just sick of&nbsp;reading reviews&nbsp;declaring Moore to be the best documentarian in the biz.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Let's see if The Hunting meets my high standards. :)

      In a scene that typifies the entire film Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore shows a stereotypical All-American boy talking about winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people and teaching them about freedom and democracy just after a harrowing scene involving a late night (pitch dark) raid into an Iraqi&nbsp;family's home.&nbsp; We don't know why the raid was done or whether it was appropriate or not.&nbsp; We can intuit that since the beginning of the war, some raids have taken place without justification or with ill-founded justifications because we know that war is hell, but this scene, which makes it extremely easy to empathize with the set-upon family, is bone-chilling.&nbsp; As humans, it's impossible to watch without feeling for the family and without being thankful that it's not happening to you.  &nbsp;  I say it typifies the movie because the emotional impact of the scene and therefore the movie is undeniable.&nbsp; Michael Moore has made Fahrenheit 9/11 with the purpose of affecting a response, and he does it.&nbsp; I laughed out loud several times during the film, I cried at least twice, and I left awestruck and outraged.&nbsp; Presenting the material as he does is extraordinarily manipulative.&nbsp; It is propaganda (in the way that the word, divorced from pejorative connotations, just means to share information in a way that persuades people) of the highest order, and I understand why he has drawn comparisons to some of the great propagandists of all time.&nbsp; Moore uses slight of hand, juxtaposition, irony and maybe commits the sin of omission from time to time,&nbsp;but&nbsp;he is not dishonest.&nbsp; It is one of the finest movies I have ever seen, and I am convinced that it will change the world.&nbsp; It may not lead to regime change here (the film might be so incendiary that it actually makes those who are not inclined to see it Mike's way even more recalcitrant - or, gulp - even more motivated); but it will change the way campaigns are carried out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have seen two of Michael Moore's other films:&nbsp; "Roger and Me" which I thought was unique and engaging, but ultimately more tomfoolery than substance, and "Bowling for Columbine" which I thought was brilliant at times, but lacking in subtlety, and filled with poor decisions (he ends up looking like he was picking on Charlton Heston.&nbsp; Yes, Chuck Heston is an asshole, but the effect Moore wants is not for us to feel sorry for the asshole, and even an asshole comes across as sympathetic when that asshole is about to go down to Alzheimer's. &nbsp;Asshole).&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I tend to judge those I agree with more harshly than those I don't agree with, and Michael Moore earns more of my criticism than he should.&nbsp; In this film, he seems to have invested his heart and soul into its message, his mind and energy into it preparation, and his connections into its distribution and promotion.&nbsp; It is so direct an attack on a sitting President, I had the thought, as I drove home, that Mr. Moore might end up dead here pretty soon.&nbsp; It is that powerful.&nbsp; One review I read said it best: &nbsp;"as the man said, if you shoot for the King, you better kill him."  &nbsp;  It seems that just about every decision he made was the correct one (and yes, logic tells you some things are a bit far fetched. For example, George Bush is criticized for removing the name of a fellow soldier from a medical report that he issued.&nbsp; That soldier goes on to become powerful and connected and corrupt (tied into the whole Carlyle thing).&nbsp; The implication is that Bush removed his name so that we would not see that connection.&nbsp; However, I know from my days in the trade, that when sending records out related to a particular person, it is routine to delete references to private information concerning other persons who are not covered by the authorization to release records.&nbsp; Yes, it is possible that at the Presidential and media level, the rules are different (the media may want to know that soldier’s name so that they could interview him about “W” in his National Guard days), and no, Moore could not go into that level of detail and still have a watch-able movie, but you get the sense that motives are being attributed when they shouldn't be.&nbsp; By contrast, much has been made of Minnesota's own Mark Kennedy who, when confronted about signing up a child to fight in Iraq, apparently said to Moore that he had a nephew in the military (but not in Iraq) only to have his response edited out.&nbsp; When you see the film and you see the look on Kennedy's face just before they cut to another scene, you will know why – I would have ended it right there too, if I had Moore’s flair and talent).&nbsp; I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that for me, the end result will be stunning for some.&nbsp; My life was changed forever, but as I was busy quoting my&nbsp;dear friend HAL who said "if even 1/10th of it is true, Bush should not be President," I looked&nbsp;over at Mrs. Duf, who, at some point during my 45 minute tirade, had fallen asleep.

      I had another weekend of music combined with some liberal politics, fresh air, beer-drinking, and frisbee. We headed up to the Green Man Festival in Duluth on Friday afternoon and were greeted by throngs of hippies camping out at the festival for the weekend. My version of camping out was booking a hotel room for under $100/night. The festival was kind of dead since Willie Nelson (the headliner for the fest) cancelled at the last minute, but we stayed anyway and played glow-in-the-dark frisbee and stopped at some political and environmental booths and drank Rolling Rock and ate Jamaican jerk chicken. Spirit Mountain was a cool-ass place to throw this party (what a view of Duluth and the lake below!), but unfortunately hippies are no good at running events of this magnitude. Their hearts were there, but the business acumen was definitely lacking. I'd love to whip that group into shape and take over this event for next year. Alas, I have this other crappy day-job to attend to.   Cracker was great, aside from the drunk fool who stood next to us and requested (more liked bellowed) "Low" after each song. We also watched this really impish, quirky folk singer named  urlLink Haley Bonar . Not bad at all.   Saturday was spent driving along the North Shore and stopping for smoked fish and seeing the lighthouse and waterfall. We stayed at the festival until about 10:30pm and then drove back to the TC (after first stopping at Black Bear casino to try and get a room and some nickel slot gambling in - no vacancy).   Sunday night was First Ave's  urlLink Rock for Democracy  show. All proceeds from tickets, T-shirts, etc went to the DFL party and they had tables scattered throughout the club to register voters. (Duf, I'm  this  much closer to voting for Kerry, I swear.) Mayor RT Rybak was there wearing a Wellstone T-Shirt. Before the Flops hit the stage, he gave a little speech about getting the current guy out of office, etc, etc...and then he did a stage dive into the crowd. He said he wanted to be the first mayor ever to stage dive at First Ave. So excellent. The Jayhawks all showed up at the last minute to play a 20 minute set. Dave Pirner (formerly of Soul Asylum, now Golden Smog, sans dreads) walked on-stage during Jessy Greene's set and sang a fantastic rendition of "Black Gold". Dan (Semisonic) and Matt Wilson (the  urlLink Flops ) sang "Made to Last" together. It was local music overload (in a GOOD way).   *whew*

       1. What color ink pen do you like best?   &nbsp;  I’m true to blue.&nbsp; Like HAL, I use black the most, but I would use blue if left to my own devices. Still, 90% of my pens are black.  &nbsp;  “I don’t buy cheeba; I grow it.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;   2. Do you prefer plain paper or paper with lines (notebook paper)?   &nbsp;  Paper without lines. Yes.&nbsp; It is difficult to write in straight lines, but the end result is much better.  &nbsp;  “If you’re drinking, don’t drive, and if you’re driving, don’t drink.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;   3. What's better: books from the library, or reading online?   &nbsp;  It ain’t even close:&nbsp; the library hands down.  &nbsp;  “Hey ladies in the place I’m calling out to ya’…there’s never been a city kid truer and bluer.&nbsp; There's more to me than you'll ever know...”&nbsp;  &nbsp;   4. Which would you rather get, e-mail or snail mail?   &nbsp;  This is a total blow out.&nbsp; Give me the snail mail.&nbsp; I get e-mails from friends everyday, and I love to receive them, but getting a letter in the mail…there’s nothing like it.&nbsp;   “All you trekkies and TV addicts…don’t mean to dis’, don’t mean to bring static…all you Klingons in the fuckin’ house…grab your backstreet friend and get loud.”    5. Do you have a paper weight on your desk?    I have a weight of paper on my desk, but not a paper weight.   “I looked out the window and seen his bald head.&nbsp; I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg.”

       Alright, so I've missed the FF... even if more often than not it sucks.    &nbsp;   1. What color ink pen do you like best?   I prefer blue, though I use black the most (more widely available??).&nbsp; Red is always fun,&nbsp;and it reminds me of my AP European history class, senior year of High School... Mr. Wurst always had us read photocopied text and underline important passages with a RED pen (no blue ink, and absolutely no highlighters).&nbsp; Teachers are, by definition, eccentrics.  &nbsp;   2. Do you prefer plain paper or paper with lines (notebook paper)?   All about the lined paper!&nbsp; Plain paper is for people who sketch strangers in bus stations.  &nbsp;   3. What's better: books from the library, or reading online?   Hands down, books from the library...&nbsp;why spend more time in front of a computer?&nbsp; Though I can't remember the last time I checked out a library book.  &nbsp;   4. Which would you rather get, e-mail or snail mail?   Beggars can't be choosers.&nbsp; But snail mail is always nice.  &nbsp;   5. Do you have a paper weight on your desk?   Nothing that is a paper weight per se, but a bunch of crap that could be used as a paper weight in case a wind storm comes through the office.&nbsp; I like nick-nacks.

      Yesterday I stopped&nbsp;at the Dairy Queen on West 7th in St. Paul.&nbsp; The best part about the trip?&nbsp; On a nearby power-box, someone had spray-paint-stenciled the image of Tim Pawlenty with the words "Republican Lapdog" under it.&nbsp; Sadly, recent&nbsp;state funding decreases&nbsp;for the&nbsp;City of St. Paul will mean that there&nbsp;are less resources to clean unsightly graffiti.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;Timmy's face will be there for some time.&nbsp; Suddenly, my cone tasted 100x better.

      TinyE is really stepping up the potty training.  There are three concerns related to this wonderful happening.  But first, some background:  When you have a child, there is a phenomenon where friends with children who are older than your child will tell you what to expect with a milestone for your child (like learning to walk or learning to talk).  Intuitively, you think that the days when your child is potty trained will be wonderful because, you imagine, you will be done with diapers which are decidedly unfun.  Here's what you learn -  The nice thing about diapers is that they catch stuff better than underwear does.  Enough said?  I can elaborate.  TinyE, as part of her progress, now proclaims a need to potty when it is very inconvenient.  For example, you learn very quickly how few restrooms there are at neighborhood playgrounds.  So, while she is swinging or enjoying the slide or monkey bars, you can count on her needing to go, and you can also count on her not being able to hold it while you drive to the nearest Hardee's.    Last, for you penny pinchers out there:  you are going to lose a lot (and I mean a lot) of toiler paper as your child unrolls it, and puts in in the toilet for no damn reason.    Just a heads up...

      Apparently our conceal and carry statute has been ruled unconstitutional by a district court judge.  Now, that does not mean that it's all over, but it could be the beginning of the end.  The Court of Appeals is the next step unless the Supreme Court wants it on a fast track. The grounds are somewhat technical, but if it works, it works.  I will say that it is worth doing.  Any police officer or firefighter (ahem) will tell you:  we don't need more guns on the streets.  A good friend of my just lost his job as a teacher in the Minneapolis Public Schools.  So, HAL's blog expressing outrage at the layoffs and the Governor's pathetic nonchalance has now hit close to home.  My friend, DS, works with children who have behavioral disorders, and the thought that he won't be there doing that good work is amazing and sad to me. It all comes down to this:  as Americans and as Minnesotans we can afford to do better.  Those who are aggressively opposed to tax increases (NOTE:  as incomes rise and as inflation rises, the cost of government (its administration and the provision of its services) rises too) can keep plenty of money, drive ridiculous SUVs, have lakeside cabins and lead lives of opulence, while still supporting our schools, libraries, environment, infrastructure and way of life.  We can afford to prosper and support government services at the same time.  Don't make the mistake of seeing it as an either or proposition.  Look, I don't want to overdo anything - I don't want to have overfunded schools or libraries, but I want to have an adequate number of teachers and good student/teacher ratios.  But hey, if we are going to provide core services, let's at least do a good job of it.  Anything worth doing as my grandpa used to say...anything worth doing...   BONUS FEATURE (Two 3 Word Paragraphs as an Aside):   I miss BB. Bush must go.

      It's not that I don't agree with  urlLink some of the things Bill says .  It's just that I see them as exactly the type of generalization that is emblematic of ignorance.  Is it stereotyping to say that stereotyping of this sort is for morons?  Yes, there are people (of every culture) who are undereducated and say and do ignorant things.  There are folks out there who are not model parents.  But, it seems that they get more attention than they are due.  There are plenty of hard-working Americans who have less but strive for betterment.  The connection that Bill draws between the poor and the ignorant is a bit to cozy for me.  Yes, there are many folks (African Americans among them) who cry discrimination too easily.  But, Bill's statements here can be sloppy to the point that they undermine legitimate claims or get co-opted.  I'm not sure I wouldn't trust an Affirmative Action opponent not to leverage this same argument and cite Bill Cosby as the source.    Also, take special note of Jesse Jackson in the background.  Is he sleepy? Does he disagree?  Is he dreaming of that extra-marital affair he had that one time?

      And what a weekend it was...   Friday:   They Might Be Giants  at First Ave.  Never really heard them live before, and don't even have any of their albums, but we had free tickets and damn if they weren't funny and entertaining!  Kinda like Barenaked Ladies lite.  Afterwards we headed over to the Marshall Field's Music Days free show at Orchestra Hall.  Gary Louris (lead singer of the Jayhawks),  urlLink Brenda Weiler  (cute as a button), and Adam Levy (of Honeydogs fame) each sang 35 minute acoustic sets.  It was dreamy.  Gary singing "Stumbling Through the Dark" (just him, his guitar, & his harmonica *sigh*) made me well up.   Saturday: The Basilica Block Party.  We went to the stage where Dan Wilson (lead singer of Semisonic) was playing.  Other than the annoying drunk floozies who parked their over-tanned, over-siliconed selves right next to us, it was heavenly.  Danny Boy sang only a couple Semisonic tunes ("Secret Smile" and the overplayed "Closing Time") but the rest was his own original stuff.  Made me want to go out and buy his album ASAP.  As we enjoyed some fried cheese curds, we heard  Five for Fighting  in the distance on the main stage. (or as I like to refer to them as - "Five for Fucking Horrible") They weren't really that bad, but if I hear that stupid song "100 Years" again, I'm going to barf up my cheese curds.  Later on we saw Hal, with a few drinks in her, wearing a leather skirt at a gay bar.  She can give you the details on that outing herself.    This Coming Friday night:   Cracker  at the  urlLink Green Man Festival  in Duluth.

      Probably one of the most fun things about dating someone new is figuring out all the cool/interesting/kinky(?) places you can go to on dates.  I was perusing the "Best Of" lists on Citysearch, and found the list for  urlLink "Best Date Spot" .  Most of the choices made sense: Zelo, Loring Pasta Bar, WA Frost, etc.  But then I got to the bottom of the list.   The Olive Garden??   I'm sorry.  Am I a snob if I say I'd dump a guy if he took me there on a first date?  Not to say the salad/bread stick deal isn't a good idea when you're short on cash...but Holy Christ!!    Word to the single fellas: even a cheap bottle of wine in the park would be a better choice.

      Whilst (nod to HAL) I digest the new Wilco album  A Ghost is Born , I wanted to take a moment to say what an exceptional year this has been for music.  First of all, the return of the Pixies.  That alone would make for a good year.  But these albums are great, and if you don't have them, let me know, you can burn mine (my burner is on the fritz).  Modest Mouse  Good News for People Who Love Bad News  (my album of the year so far - almost as good as Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (my album of the decade so far))  Morrissey  You are the Quarry  (solid, a grand return)  Sonic Youth  Sonic Nurse  (vintage SY)  PJ Harvey  Uh Huh Her  (good until track 5, Letter, then AMAZING)  Beastie Boys  To the 5 Burroughs  (filled with hooks, cuts, beats and rhymes)  Wilco  A Ghost is Born  (a quiet storm with my song of the year so far, Spiders (Kidsmoke))  Loretta Lynn  Van Lear Rose  (what you've heard is true: this disc is amazing)  Any other recommendations out there?

      I was telling Hal and Bassy yesterday how you can look up profiles that are similar to one you may be looking at by clicking on "View Similar Profiles".  I'm not sure how it works, but when I did that to Mr. Pilot, it came up with a few similar fake-looking guido types.  For example:  1) Freakishly  urlLink tight abs !  2) I love the fake  urlLink corporate shot .  3)  urlLink Pixels  anyone?  4) "The more physical the better", yet he's not looking for "Mrs. Right Now?"   urlLink I'm confused.

      ...and I wrote the pilot guy back saying I'd like to meet up with him, but would like to see some other pictures of him.  Instead of calling him on his obviously fake glamour shot, I played dumb:   Hi Jeremy, Sure - I'd love to meet up next week.  But in the meantime, I was wondering if you have any other pictures of yourself.  Since you have only one on your profile, I was curious to see others.  :)   Most likely, I won't hear from him again...but I guess you never know.  If he sends me others (probably cut out of an  urlLink International Male catalog ) then Monday will be the big day.

      Remember  urlLink this guy ?  Well, I hadn't heard from him in weeks, but just received an e-mail from him asking me out  again .     Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, I was out of town for a few days.   Maybe we could meet up next week. I am free on Monday night or Tuesday.  Let me know,  Hope to hear from you soon. Jeremy   Here's my quandary:  I've been dating one of the guys I met throught the site almost exclusively.  He's great.  But I feel, for the sake of this "project", I need to at least get one last date/meeting in with this weirdo pilot chachi - at least to let y'all know what he REALLY looks like (I'm curious too, of course).  How do I explain this to my fella?

      I don't hate anyone, and I have an especially hard time truly despising anyone that I've never met.  But in the past couple years, I've found two politicians that I'd sooner punch in the face than shake hands with - our President, and our Governor.  Pawlenty has done lots of things that I find insane and unacceptable (our concealed weapon law and apparent hatred of expendable public services like a police force quickly come to mind).  And while it's not surprising, I read stuff  urlLink like this  and wonder how anyone can support this guy.  As a product of the Minneapolis Public Schools, I can say that I envy anyone who can teach in them.  Putting up with what the teachers must tolerate each day, all for a sad excuse for a paycheck... only to get laid-off at the end of each school year (like a friend of mine who is an outstanding teacher at a district elementary school and has lost his job each year for the past four years), well, I couldn't do it.  Then to read crap like that from your governor?  I dare that man to enroll his kids in the largest school district in his OWN STATE and have the same cavalier attitude.  What a fucking idiot.

      That's what Hal said to me today since I'll most likely (contingent on financing and other such hoopla) be living in the building she used to live in by the end of November.  A bigger and cheaper place just opened up in the same building, but it ended up being about the same cost for me because they only would accept the list price.  So there you have it.  I'm going to be a homeowner.

      ...or something like that.  I'm in the middle of the biggest financial transaction of my life. I've made an offer on a place by Lake Harriet (totally low-balled it by about $11,000). It's not the end of the world if I they tell me to take a hike, but it would be pretty sweet if they accepted. They can suck it if they think I'm paying 12K just for the parking spot.  I actually had a dream about it last night - I dreamt they accepted my paltry offer with open arms. And then I dreamt I had a PBJ there to celebrate.  Maybe it's a sign that all my dreams will someday come true.  Anyway, I called my agent this morning to ask her to add something to one of the forms in the purchase agreement. Her roommate answered: "She's actually sleeping right now."  Great, I've got my life savings on the line and she's taking a snooze at 11am. That makes me feel  real  secure.  It's hard to comprehend why others in the whole process (realtors, attorneys, title companies, closing companies, mortgage brokers, etc) don't take the whole thing as seriously as I do -- because to them it's just another day at the office and another day at work.  So wish me luck...

Oh...and by the way: thanks to everyone who said nice things about my upcoming date with Fatherhood.   Well, except for Duf.  He said my kid's going to have a huge head.  Ouch baby.

      well the streak had to end...I received my first traffic violation today for failure to come to a complete stop at a stop sign in a neighborhood with absolutely no moving cars in sight, which meant that I had to basically stop, turn off the car, maybe do a Chinese fire drill upon arriving at said stop sign to qualify as a  complete  stop. it's slightly pathetic that my 13 year streak has to come to end with this flimsy citation. at least pull me over for something real like cruisin' or maybe a little reckless driving. but alas, I need to keep the insurance rates on the down low...  and the Pandyland anniversary shindig sounds like a ton o fun, I sadly have to send my regrets. :( Any chance you all could come down to Atlanta for the event??  take care BB

      Yo Pandies...  In one week, this here blog will celebrate 2 years of internet discussing.  That's right!  I think to commemorate this historic event, we should do something.  I don't know...take it back to the old school, have a pub crawl or maybe go out and do some karoake and enjoy the Champagne of Beers:  Miller High Life  What do y'all think?  We blew it last year when the 1 year mark came and went without nary a mention.  I also think this celebration should break the myth that Duf and I can't appear at the same place in public at the same time.  Just sayin'...

      Duf, where the hell have you been?  Well two weeks ago I was vacationing on Lake  Mille Lacs  (don't hate) with my mother (REALLY don't hate) and my wife's parents (really, really, REALLY don't hate).  A good time was had by all.  I golfed quite a lot and would have golfed more if the man wasn't keeping me down.  I lost to my father in law (age 71) 6-0, 6-0 in tennis (trust me, he would take all of you in the same fashion - and by the way he plays with wooden rackets that he buys on eBay).  And, when I least expected it, I found the  urlLink love of my life .  I will never stray or cheat on you, baby.  You are everything to me.  Then I come back to work, and my  acc es s  to the net is down.  I called our IT guy.  Here's a replay of our conversation.  Duf:  My computer won't access the internet. ITG:  It's not your computer, it's Wernham Hogg's computer. Duf:  In any event I can't use explorer. ITG:  Have you rebooted?  Then, no kidding, after three days, he gets explorer to work again, and then everytime I type the letter "i" or the letter "p", my stupid computer (age 1 month) adds the letter "o."  It was poretty weiord.   After the last two weeks I've had, there is only two remedies.  First, you must blog (done).  Second, you must drink as least two  Jack  Daniels based cocktails (pending).  I missed you all, and here is a note for each of you:  HAL - I swear to God your gift is coming, and what 'til you see the retailer who is fucking me over on the whole thing (for the thousandth time it was NOT an eBay purchase.  I'm clean now).  DJS - You are going to be a phenomenal Dad.  I mean, one of the best of all time.  Your child is going to be loved and cool and it is going to have a big head.  Good on ya' mate.  Panda - I want you to love me even though I'm flaky.  It always goes from endearing to annoying, but it usually goes back to endearing.  Hang in there with me.  BB -  Best wishes on your exam.  Please send me a few ab workouts.  My situation is desperate (but not serious)!

       I've been here for almost 8 months now, and all I can add to my resume is that I've developed super-human hearing.  You see, I sit in a cube farm next to probably one of the busiest areas of our office - the bathroom. So, if everyone goes to the bathroom the requisite 2 times a day (some more, some less), and approximately 100 people in my area use this bathroom, that means about 200 times a day someone walks past my desk, with my computer in full view.  Yet, I am still able to read tons of newspapers, goofy websites, and view/download photos on the internet without being detected. How?  It's the super-human hearing. It's become so well-tuned in fact, that I can tell exactly who is behind me, just by the sound his/her shoes/clothes make. My peripheral vision is not too shabby either. Flip-flops? That's Babs. Rustling-sounding suit? Easy - that's Jean. Pastel shirt out of the corner of my eye? Ha - that's our director.  What's especially nice: in the mornings, our boss uses this rolly-cart thing to bring her laptop in and out of the office. When she's rollin' on in, she's making a lot of noise. This gives me and my coworker enough time to stop gabbing (which we usually do for the first 1/2 hour we're in the office) and get in our seats and look busy. We both have developed this keen sense of sound detection.  It's brilliant!

      Hi.  I'm DJ Shovelpants.  You may remember me from my occasional posts on this here site 'Pandyland.'  Yeah, it's kind of an internet discussion group.  You know.  Well, I haven't been posting much.  Why?  Probably because there hasn't been much news for me to share.   Then why are you posting now, DJS?   Nice set-up.  Thanks for that.  Well, I've actually got some news.  Coming this February, there will be an addition to the Shovelpants family.   You're getting a new dog?  Oh, that's great news!   Nope.  Around February 11th or so, I'm going to be a dad.   Wait, let me do the math.  You were married in April, that's....carry the 3, minus 2...plus 6.  Wow.  You guys didn't waste any time.   Oh, shut up.
