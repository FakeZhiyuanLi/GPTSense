       This is the product of idle time. Usually phone support during queue time does not give us this much idle time, that is until you are one of two who have a direct customer service split. Then you get to sit around and do nothing but wait for one of two tiny lights to come on for you to answer the phone. Lucky for me this phenomenon does not happen very often on weekends. Therefore I am left here contemplating the future, browsing for new platform games, twiddling my thumbs, and feeling a little guilty because the rest of my team is busy taking calls. Not that I really mind the rest, but you kind of wish everybody else was resting with you. Right now I really wish I were home already inflicting pain upon my thumb by pushing on a little analog stick on my PS 2 but then again I come in and work all night so I can pay for my little electronic addiction. Of course I think I'm rambling now because I really just don't have that much to do, so if this were a piece in English class I would probably flunk because of the lack of coherence in this post. Then again since its not then I think I'll ramble on, that is if I get to think of anything more to ramble about. Hmmm, the light came on interrupting my train of thought, but I'm back now. Now I'm wondering how I'm going to fund my CD habit. I really want to get my own copies of so many discs now I think I'm going to drive myself crazy thinking about where all my money went. After I get my credit card bill gets to me that is, but then again at least CD's are tangible and they happen to be mine. I think this is enough rambling for this first foray into the world of blogs lets just see what happens next.
