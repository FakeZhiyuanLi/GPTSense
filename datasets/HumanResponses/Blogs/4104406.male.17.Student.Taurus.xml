						    Hi Sara - Lee!   Yeah this Rocks!!! Oh, Dont Ask about the address title or anything,&nbsp; I'm just going through a phaze where&nbsp;"rug" seems to be my favourite word... Like i said, rather not ask!!   Anyway, I suppose there aint much to tell you,&nbsp;except, i want you to read these lyrics by a band called The Verve Pipe and the song is called "The Freshman". Pretty Wierd Lyrics... Awesome Song too!     When I was young I knew everything     And she a punk who rarely ever took advice     Now I'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor     Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice       &nbsp;   I can't be held responsible     'Cause she was touching her face     I won't be held responsible     She fell in love in the first place       &nbsp;   For the life of me I cannot remember     What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise     For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins     We were merely freshmen       &nbsp;   My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her     His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept     Now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his head on the floor     Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says       &nbsp;   I can't be held responsible     'Cause she was touching her face     I won't be held responsible     She fell in love in the first place       &nbsp;   For the life of me I cannot remember     What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise     For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins     We were merely freshmen       &nbsp;   We've tried to wash our hands of all of this     We never talk of our lacking relationships     And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our heads on the floor     We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say       &nbsp;   I can't be held responsible     'Cause she was touching her face     I won't be held responsible     She fell in love in the first place       &nbsp;   For the life of me I cannot remember     What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise     For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins     We were merely freshmen!
