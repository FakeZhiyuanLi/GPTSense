       Well today was an ok day considering the following: A. James is still sick B. I don't think i did well on my grammer test C. I was about ready to take a nap in half of my clases D. I don't like the band music E. I stepped in a huge ass wad of gum, now stuck to my k-swiss. F. Since James was sick and Brooke is gone i have rarely a chance to stirke up a good convo. BUT!!! 1. I enjoyed my walk to Covenant talkin to Kevin and listening to Early Days, (note the title of the post) 2. The opener for Covenant Connection was a good time. 3. I got to see Ross, Anne, Heather, and the 2 new people Nick & Laura. 4. I got a free meal. 5. The meal was good. 6. I had barely any homework. 7. I get to right to you people who read this, i feel important. lol  Soo... good times bad times. eh... it was ok.  Cya tom, bright and early Oh, yeah, AAAHHH A CHAINSAW!!!!!!!!!!  EZ

       Since my pro is sooo wacked up i'll put some lyrics on here   Rock And Roll  (Bonham/Jones/Page/Plant)  It's been a long time since I rock and rolled,  It's been a long time since I did the Stroll.  Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back,  Let me get it back, baby, where I come from.  It's been a long time, been a long time,  Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. Yes it has.   It's been a long time since the book of love,  I can't count the tears of a life with no love.  Carry me back, carry me back,  Carry me back, baby, where I come from.  It's been a long time, been a long time,  Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.   Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight,  Making vows that just can't work right.  Open your arms, opens your arms,  Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in.  It's been a long time, been a long time,  Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.
