      I was recently on msdn and i was looking through all the pages on all the different programs they have for the different languages. I was looking in the Visual Basic page and i found this thing that said there is a way to get a free copy of VB.NET 2003 Standard edition. I found out that all you have to do to get this software is to watch five movies from any of the topics they have listed. After you watch the movies you then have to rate it. It was very easy. So if you want to have a copy of VB.NEt then i suggest you go and check it out  here is the link  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/atthemovies/  -Aaron

      I just got my new gmail account. My Cousin was so nice as to invite me to have one. It is really cool, 1 gig of storage for e-mails. You also get to use the power of googles search to look for e-mails in your archive.  Aaron

      Well this next week is the last full week i have to go through untill schools out. This week will be all five days then the next will have one full day and then three half-days which will be finals. We were going to get out this week but since we have been through two days of no power and three days of snow we had to push the end of school back a week. One of the many good things about the summer is that i will be able to update my website more ofen and if i feel like it update my blog everyday or more than i have been.  -Aaron

      Well I finally got my cop of VB.NET and I tried to install and it wouldn't work, but I also knew that I could already make VB programs with my Visual Studio .NEt. Anyway, pretty soon i will have some programs i made tonight in VB. They aren't that great but today is my first day with VB. The onething i like about VB is that it is so easy to make a program. I made all of the ones that will be on my site in about 10 minutes.  Peace, Finley

      I&nbsp;was recently at a site and one of the ads was for AOL, and i thought to my self, AOL always says its service is so good, yet they are the only ISP togive you&nbsp;1099 hours free, or any for that matter if you were to sign up. I don' t&nbsp; get it. I mean if they are really as good as they say they are then why do they need to give people 1099 hrs. free. They wouldn't but they do because they know they suck and don't want to give up because they know that it annoys everyone or at least it annoys me, and they like to annoy people,&nbsp;but whatever.

Sorry for not posting for a while, I have been busy with other things

      I have been waiting so long but now I have it. The game is probably one of the best ever. The storyline and graphics are great. The one thing that suprised me was that you still can use the chainsaw as a weapon. One thing that i didn't really like was that it is really dark so i had to use my flashlight a lot but other than that it was great.  go out and buy it now  -Aaron
