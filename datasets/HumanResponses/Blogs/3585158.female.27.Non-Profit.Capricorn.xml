      I love men – and I love women too.   I pop my eyes out ogling at the cosmo men, but that didn’t stop me from staring at Angelina Jolie at capacity 24/7...  sometimes I wish I were a man but clearly most of the time I simply marvel at myself being a woman.  But then this wish of being a man just comes from this double standard society that I grew up on, or maybe because when we were all young we were taught to distinctly differenciate a woman from a man, thus…the world of difference.  I really don’t understand.  I’m also not a firm believer of religion.  I had this mistake of telling my lack of sexual preference in a partner to a friend and I was looked down as the perforator of the destruction of Soddom and Gommorah. What I’m saying is that, c’mon, this society is still wary of my kind and they are definitely NOT ready to embrace my belief.    Imagine there’s no gender… life would be much easier.  Of course I also think this is not a sexual perversion.  Have you ever really enjoyed talking with a girlfriend that you simply want to kiss her on the lips?  Not a smack but really kiss her?  Just because.  And not because I want to have sex with her.  Come to think of it--- I’d come out unscathed if I kiss my best male friend… but my best girl friend????  As  much as I want a genderless society, I am still respectful of the differences between a man and a woman.  I just want NOT let these differences restrict our actions in any situation and restrict our preferences in any relationship, or be judged  wrongly and be misunderstood in any boy-boy, girl-boy, or girl-girl relationship we establish .  I hate the machismo of men not wanting to get caught in a tight emotional embrace with another man,  or the ultra-feministic view of  this colleague getting all worked up just because a guy suggested that women should be at the back of men in a blockade simulation.   I mean  no matter what this guy’s intentions were, we have BREASTS to protect and their balls are much less likely targets, right?  I wouldn’t waste my energy fighting something that is for my own good.  I am not that stupid.    Maybe some may think that I’m rebellious because things are not made up my way… not the way I would like things to be.  Yes, I respect everybody else’s opinion, but that does not and will not stop me from reacting and questioning  why things are as they are.  I still THINK and INSIST that women and men were made for both men and women, no matter what relationship or level of relationship they would want to establish. And no matter what certain feminists would say, If a man offers me a seat, I’d take that seat offered to me; not because I am a woman but because sitting in a crowded train is much comfortable.…plus I’d really like to believe that if it was offered, it was out of good intentions.
