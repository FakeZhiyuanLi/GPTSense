      I have seen Michael Moore's newest film titled "Fahrenheit 9/11." I think it was a well made documentary as well as an entertaining film. I laughed very much throughout; I also became very sad at times.   Without becoming bogged down with clich√©d media footage of the actual terrorist acts (the media's portrayal has become so overused that the terrible images are invoked for inappropriate things; I mean no disrespect), Moore's film presents an alarming amount of detrimental facts about our current President and the Government as a whole. One would be wise not to believe this movie as gospel but rather reflect on it's undeniable truths: The Government did in fact lie to the American people. George W. Bush is not a good leader. The bloodshed in Iraq is more severe and consequential than the greater public knows.   It is also clear that "Fahrenheit 9/11" does not mean to endorse one political party over another or place all the blame with one man. It also refrains from being preachy as pertaining to what should have or should not have been done. I choose to think of the film as an informational one; there are things, surprising and disquieting things, that we did not and were not supposed to know and this film attempts to inform the public as such.  The only negative aspect I derived from this movie is one that accompanies most of Mr. Moore's work that I am familiar with: He never seems to want the person to whom he is directing his dissent or criticism to be able to respond. Not that many of them ever choose to respond, but it is almost as if Michael Moore simply wants acknowledgment of fault but never gives an opportunity for explanation. That is just my view of his work and it does not take away from the finished product.  If for no other reason I will recommend this movie because it is truly comedic. It allowed me to laugh at things in such a way as to appreciate the gravity of the situation yet pull some modicum of humor from it. It was almost necessary to do so; the more drama that is around us it seems we need to laugh that much more and this film proves that.   My personal rating is three stars out of four possible.

      I just wanted to say how much I like this site. I have been trying to get people to notice my writing for a while but there is only so much noticing that can be done while everything is scattered about my house in notebooks and on floppy disks. So here I am, Blog; thanks for having me.

                I love television. But American television is in a sad state right now. Not that I've seen a lot of foreign television, but I would imagine that the Arab-speaking countries of the world are going to be a whole lot more entertained this fall than we are here in the U.S. I mean, at least Al Jazeerah takes chances. Who knows if Osama's latest taped message will be a ratings boom or bust let alone trying to discern its authenticity. And kudos to those feisty Europeans who love to watch their Soccer players and naked people bounce across their screens. TV Networks in Europe don't worry themselves over censorship or taking risks in their entertainment. They realized a long time ago that parents were meant to censor what their children watch, not the government. And a show that deals with "hot" topics or even attempts to break away from the norm won't be hindered there. And they are so close to the Vatican! What is our excuse?       There is no excuse! Why do viewers with some modicum of intelligence have to wallow through 3 or 4 seasons of terrible shows just to find that  one  good program only to see it cancelled or marginalized by the network? Here's what we have to look forward to this fall: 'Gee, 30 million people like "CSI" so let's make 3 of them. The awfully written sitcoms we ordered last year didn't do as well as we'd hoped so let's only order a couple of awfully written ones this year. While we're at it, let's make another "Law and Order." Those millions of poverty line straddling Americans who don't actually get 300 channels won't mind watching another edition of "American Idol." Say, what ever happened to that pretty little Kelly girl or that big black guy? Oh well; we need to pick the next big pop star for the 4th time.'         Now that we "echo boomers" aka "generation Y" aka "we need a better moniker" are coming to the REAL age that we can start spending money that we don't have, ABC, NBC, FOX, and CBS will be quite surprised to learn that OUR lowest common denominator isn't as low as our predecessors. Not that I have anything against our predecessors. Without our predecessors where would we be? Love those predecessors. I call mine every Sunday. It's just that, well, they would and still will watch ANYTHING as long as it's on. We are smarter than that. And we have limitless sources of entertainment. We don't need to watch network television. But we used to enjoy it. Do you remember?      We grew up watching reasonably decent TV shows. Can "Yes, Dear" even be considered a sitcom when measured against "Roseanne?" Does Jerry Seinfeld laugh to himself knowingly whenever he catches a rerun of "According to Jim?" Somewhere in Florida the three remaining Golden Girls won't even turn the television on because they know that the sitcom died when Sophia did. So sad.        But there are a few good shows on right now which give me hope that all network executives aren't in the wrong career field. "Everybody Loves Raymond" is deservingly the number one sitcom right now. (Patricia Heaton is so hot.) "Alias" lets those of us who willingly suspend our disbelief relish in otherworldly exploits of espionage, sexual tension, and gadgetry every week or so. "Will and Grace" will be remembered as the one Gay themed show that could make it, and with another shot of creativity, could again. But these few examples of quality programming in the midst of characterless and soullessly written storytelling, when compared to the annals of television as a whole, don't account for much.        Advertisers have been trying to woo us since we were in the womb and the desensitization is almost complete. I don't watch television to see advertisements. I want to be entertained! Commercials are just a part of life. If television networks think they are doing everyone a favor by airing commercials during cheaply produced profit driven prime time garbage they are mistaken. I know what I need to buy and I know what I want to buy. Television doesn't really play that big of a role in our spending habits anymore. It used to be that the better a show was the more people would watch and the more sponsors would sponsor. Now the means have overshadowed the end: as long as a show can get sponsors, no matter its quality or content, somebody somewhere will watch. Well that's not going to cut it anymore. American Network television is losing viewers at an astounding rate: 20 years ago three quarters of every television set in the U.S. was tuned to a broadcast network show. Today, during the average prime time block, maybe a third are watching a major network. And veiwership along the whole television spectrum is down as well. And it's not because of the internet. It's not because of the DVD. It's because there really, truly, and honestly isn't anything good on TV tonight.        What can the networks do about this sad state? It's actually quite simple. Make a good show! How hard is it to read something, decide if it's good and make it happen? "Seinfeld" got on the air through some mysterious divination. Some years back an exec discerned that Bill Cosby was a funny guy and should have a show. During some freak accident a network executive actually okayed a show about six single people in a rather large city that was pretty funny. Go figure.       When the day comes that the networks figure out that the audience made up of our generation is intelligent, articulate, independent, and inherently able to discern the truly good from the rubbish, it will be the next golden age of television. Until then I will wait patiently. Or maybe not.  Writing for TV seems like a noble profession under the right circumstances. Maybe this writing thing could take me places...perhaps Los Angeles?
