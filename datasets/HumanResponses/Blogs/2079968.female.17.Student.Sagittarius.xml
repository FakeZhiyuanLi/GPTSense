      The "How Funny Are You?" quiz results :-P    SATIRE: You love making fun of stuff. You probably have every issue of "Mad" and "Cracked" magazines. If you don't, you should. You could probably WRITE for thos publications. Nothing is funnier to you than taking a large serious and boring situation and twisting it into a wild and crazy scenario.     urlLink   How funny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Huh. Odd. The picture of John Cleese is funny though.

      well.      My inner child is six years old!    Look what I can do!  I can walk, I can run, I can read! I like to do stuff, and there's a whole big world out there to do it in.  Just so long as I can take my blankie and my Mommy and my three best friends with me, of course.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I guess that's somewhat accurate.

      How now, brown cow?  Oh, for those wondering, I was Mary Poppins for that church  halloween party thingy.  Story: found a funny hat at goodwill, a long black skirt...sanitized them both, and voila! Mary Poppins.  Well my original idea was Eliza Doolittle from My Fair Lady...but...  Anyway...andrew and i won the costume contest thingy (he was mr. bean) ...we got a bean bag chair thingy. also we had the goriest pumpkin :-P it was cool. it had guts coming out of its mouth and eye and top of its head. haha.  Problem: there was only one (chair, that is) :-P  Pictures are on the way as soon as they develop and i finish using my roll of film :-P (wait...other way around)  i realize i talk too much.

Went to the doctor...nothin' wrong...just stress/anxiety as far as my doctor can tell...we'll find out after my blood test comes back...  yeah...about that...i had a flu shot AND had a blood sample drawn in the same arm...i can't even type well...  The guy that took my blood...haha...he said: "I have 2 rules...ready? OK...first...don't throw up on me...second...don't pass out on me...if you decide to do either one...i'd rather you throw up on me than pass out...don't handle that well..."  anyways he forgot to tell me to unclench my fist...haha..so i was very tensed up...  and my left arm freakin' hurts.  the end.

      Man I am so lonely.  So bored.  There's nobody to talk to right now...Obviously.  It's almost 1 AM.  Idk it just seems like the times I'm most talkative nobody seems to be around or not many even care to talk.  Idk...whatever.  Gah I'm so whiny.  I've noticed that the times i'm most talkative are at night...idk...i think everyone's thoughts unfold and their true selves are unmasked...idk if that made sense to any of you, but it did to me. So that's why it's being documented now.  Hmm...I need to write more.  This is a nice release of thought and it feels...healthy.  It's been a while since I've done any kind of writing for myself...  Obviously I'm just rambling on...there are so many thoughts in my brain.  Enough for now.

I'll get back to yas on this...I have a lot of thinking to do on this issue.  All because I wanted a hamburger.

I've not been to school for about a week because of being really sick, then because of really bad weather.  Haha...Andrew gave me an early present today...i got  Punk'd   on dvd...something I didn't expect to get :-P But i liked it nevertheless. We didn't know the language wasn't edited...oh well. At least they left "Naked Shopper" blurred. Not a sight I care to see.  So be happy happy happy, ok?  And if you're not, think of...nothing. Because ignorance is bliss, my friends.

      I wonder if it will snow tonight or tomorrow...  As nice as it would be to get outta school tomorrow and all...usually whenever everyone starts getting all giddy about snow...  ...it never snows.  Which is why I'm gonna be all "don't know, don't care" about the snow.  Moving on...  The "ernie" thingy...(if it's still on that sesame street character) on the right is a "terror alert" thing. I thought it was sort of funny.  Terrorism isn't funny. At all...but seeing ernie over there makes the orange level not so threatening.  Don't worry, be happy.  I'm either gonna try to go get some sleep or go watch some tv.  Until next time...

      Thanks for your post, Steven. :-) I liked it a lot.  And now...moving on to...  What being an adult means: You can...  -Legally buy cigarettes -Legally drink alcohol -Finally have access to porn and other sexual materials  It just doesn't seem logical either...in South Carolina, with parental consent, a girl can marry at 14 and a guy at 16...you can legally have sex at 16...and without parental consent, marry at 18.  People who make laws are stupid. There is absolutely no logic to any of that stuff above.  And if those things qualify becoming an adult, then I think i'll pass and stay a child at heart, thank you very much.  Brought to you by Veronica Alexander for the person who makes laws in 2004. (a member of congress...or president.)

      I feel like doing something stupid...like playing board games or with Barbies or something geeky...  When I was a kid...I turned my barbies into crash test dummies. I'd take the purple convertible and the pink jeep and run 'em into walls...the barbies would fly out.  I thought it was neat.  I didn't quite think of it as being morbid or anything...it was just fun. Odd.  Also I got them ready to have fashion shows and picnics.   I wanna play Hungry Hungry Hippos or Candy Land.  I'm in this sort of weird childlike state of mind.  Probably because my mom recovered some old McDonald's toys from our basement.  Does anyone remember McNugget Buddies?  Those were truly awesome...I had the old 80s ones...and also these neat halloween ones you could change the costumes.  You also got the little Trick or Treat buckets...and then there were those sort of "transformers"...the dinosaurs that turned into cheeseburgers and that sort.  Dude...I seriously miss my childhood.  I reflect on it so often.  I think once people start getting a taste of the cruelty of the real world, they wish they could go back to innocent times...where everything is about hope...security...fun...  It just doesn't make sense to me...that we're considered "children" up until we're 18...and for the rest of our lives we have to be grown-ups.   Am I having some sort of crisis? Knowing that this is my final year of being considered "child" in society's eyes?  Lots of thinking to do...I'm not at rest with this subject. It seems that I am in a constant state of reflection and confusion.

      Interesting tidbits! Hooray! (Well they interest me because I'm rather boring!)  Yes I think I'm getting back on track. I've been really tired lately...which creates a sense of laziness. School is getting somewhat hectic. Not bad, but you know, sometimes things get annoying after a while.  There's so much I need to do...I missed the last SAT sign up date, so I need to do that, and school ends in May...so I gotta prep for AP exams and all that good stuff. I can't believe I'm almost gonna be a senior.  I have so much to think about...such asapplying for even more scholarships and visiting campuses, and finalizing what I'm gonna major in (even though I have a good idea of what that's gonna be. More later on that topic, because I've gotten WAY off track!)  Blindside's new album:  About a Burning Fire ...(for anyone that's listened to it), like or dislike?  I like it :) I can't determine favorite songs yet...because I've had a chance to listen, but not REALLY listen in depth, but they've made some interesting developments as far as their style as compared to the last albums.  Oh, I'll need to post my paper once I add some stuff to it! I turned what I had in and got an A, but there are still some categories I personally want to add in.  For anyone who doesn't know, it's a paper classifying high school students.  I was rather stereotypical in classifying groups, mainly to make a point.   Everything else will have to wait! I have stuff I need to do...

      Ah...being out of school from weather today was...relaxing I guess.  I really hope we're out tomorrow.  Gah sometimes I really hate school.  I like learning, don't get me wrong...I just hate boredom and being surrounded by annoying people all day...  Some people aren't annoying, true...but still.  I'm just so tired of being in high school. Senioritis already, perhaps?

      I have a problem. Well...lemme rephrase that. I have problems. Plural.  First of all...I still have to sneeze.  Secondly, I have 2 papers to do. Rough drafts...but still.  Thirdly (?), I have some strange addiction to chocolate.  Well...I don't crave it. But when I have chocolate in my possession I sort of lose control.  I went to break off a piece (I have a giant, hollow Hershey's Kiss)...and one became two...and two three...and a few more.  Then I forgot the INITIAL reason I came into the room: to get my books to begin my homework.  I also had difficulty turning off the light switch.  Something is not right with that picture.  But, more later. I have papers to write!

      Props to Steven and NBC's "The More You Know" for this quote:  "Unless you have a gavel, you shouldn't judge anybody."  It makes me so angry that people attack others based on two facts they know...the fact that they've never met the person and are talking behind their backs just don't seem to matter anymore.   Whatever happened to decency?  Have we just decided to all attack the innocents without evaluating ourselves?  Are any of us appointed to be the judges of souls?  Do we believe that as mere human beings, we have that sort of divinity?  Think about things very carefully before you say them.  Think about the way they impact others, and also think of yourself.    When true judgement comes, let us not be condemned for our hypocrisy.

      Since everyone else is jumping on the "let's all talk about the super bowl half-time show incident"...then for once, and probably once only, I too will jump aboard...  How PLANNED was that? I mean...look at the song lyrics, and the fact that her (as timberlake put it) "wardrobe malfunction" was...well...it ripped off a little too perfectly.  Not to mention that they were all over each other, had this suspicious gleam in their eyes, and nobody in the media seemed too sorry about it.  Excuse me for having morals, America. But whatever happened to decency. Oh, that's right. It's been dead for 50 years. I'm sorry, but I and several others don't care to see Janet Jackson's partially exposed breast.  To me, boobs aren't very attractive. Perhaps that is simply because I am of the female species, a Christian, and not a lesbian, so that's something I don't care to see.  But if I may comment, it was excruciatingly ugly. All things of that sort aren't too pretty, as I said above. But STILL.

Mingo!"...some of you have seen this idea...so if any sounds good to you then tell me...or if you have other suggestions. If I remember my other ideas i'll post them.

      Oh, also tomorrow or Saturday I'm gonna post ideas I have for my new blog layout...so you can help me choose. Another option I can allow is for you to offer your own suggestions. Tell your pals that may enjoy this blog.  If they don't like me then you can tell them anyway so they can read my blog and be ticked off just because it's mine.  Or ignore that because it's really irritating and childishly mean.  Off to study.

      Quote for the week, rather than day.  It's property of me and Laura...so don't take it unless I grant you royalty to do so.  Hah. I'm a queen. Because I can grant royalty. I am also an idiot.   "They're just not the brightest tool in the shed." --Veronica, during AP Language.  Oh, the irony of that comment. Times two.  Gah I'll never get to my list of stuff to talk about!  I've been sick again...so that's thrown me off schedule...  Well I'll try to get to most of it. I AM sorry.  Kind of.  Oh, but I should get to the Salute Your Shorts stuff, while I remember...  Does anyone remember Ben Stein being on that show?  Haha...yay!  Also, the guy that played Budnick was in these two bands...one was called (get ready) Bad4Good.  It was like...some metal band in the early 90s composed of teens...which, is really weird.  Apparently he was the vocalist.  I wonder if he sang such charming lyrics as he did in the opening theme of the show...anyway he did a bunch of cartoon voices too...like Invader Zim...i can't remember who he was. Oh well.  I wonder what happened to Donkey Lips and Sponge...i've seen "Ug" in a bunch of commercials and whatnot...hmm...Salute Your Shorts was NOT wonderfully-written or even a show that had great acting. However, when I was younger I thought it was the greatest thing since string cheese.  Well, maybe not THAT good.  But I enjoyed it. Classic Nickelodeon...those be the days.  Now, I feel a little old.  I'm 17, yet still...I feel a bit old.

So here's yet again...another itenerary...can't promise that that will be fulfilled...see below for a prime example...  But wait before you see below see this below...the list: 1) Review of the school play 2) My "quote of the day" for today 3) Last night's ep. of HM 4) Recent anxieties and/or annoyances 5) Writing pieces  You may not know what some of the things are on the list but I sure will remember what they are when I see that list.

      Argh...My 2-year old nephew just bit me. Wonderful.  This afternoon I stopped by and talked to my history teacher from my sophomore year, Mrs. Crossley.  We had a great conversation...She was asking me about the year...She even helped recommend colleges and pointed me in some directions involving journalism. She suggested taking a summer photography course at tech just to get a feel for that. She's an awesome teacher...One of my favorites by far.  She was one of those teachers that worked you to death, yet later you learn to appreciate them because you figure out they were trying to prepare you for reality.  I even told her that, and I hope she knows I meant it sincerely, and I wasn't sucking up or anything.  It felt rather like a "Mr. Feeny-Student" moment.  It really helps to have people out there that you know are truly on your side and you know can give you practical advice that will be beneficial in the end.  Hooray for awesome teachers!  Now I need to study for my AP Psychology test.  It's about mental disorders and stuff.  Everytime I had to read for that chapter I felt like I had every single disorder.

      My eye itches! Arrgh it's driving me crazy...I feel like jabbing a pen in it to stop the itching!  Anyway...I've had a lot on my mind lately...It's just been swimming.  It's like I can't even organize anything into being coherent.  Mmm...maybe I should do some stream-of-conciousness writing.  That always works quite well.  Oh, and I never posted my thoughts on The Passion like I meant to a few days ago. I've still not seen it...I'm waiting for some of the crowds to die down a little...and I'm also waiting until I have money...  But yeah...I can handle violence/gore, but I'm not one of those people who like to see that thing.  A lot of people don't wanna see the film because of the gore, but to me, seeing such a vivid depiction would make people understand and appreciate what Christ did even more...also, America just does not understand what true suffering is...we sit in our little comfort zones, thinking if we get fat or ugly or if we get a papercut that we're going to die.  If people think life is bad now, myself is included with those people...I hope more people see...I hope more people believe. But that's just me.  I have a lot more to say about this whole thing.  In fact, I'm sure after I see it I'll have a great deal to say.  But now I need to finish homework.  Signing off.

Secondly, if anyone wants a link to their weblog or website, let me know! I'll be glad to review the content and add it, as long as you link back to me! (In this, I'll create banners/buttons just in case).  Also, I'll be using a different service for comments...because the one I'm using now just isn't working out well. Idon't know if anyone has had problems...but I could have the new comment counter up today or possibly this weekend...(I'll most likely save all the old comments because I like them).  So that's it...If you have any suggestions or if you want a link to your page, just let me know. Comments are welcome!

      It's amazing how you can just be so close to being able to physically touch someone but feel as if their heart is a million miles from yours...  I guess that's the way it goes sometimes.  I merely want to know that you're there...and know that I won't lose you.  The question is will things remain the same?  I'm trying not to let these things infect my heart, mind, and soul...so for now I guess I'll stay in constant prayer for a brighter day and keep my heart on constant guard.

      Who knew that something as beautiful as Love could hurt so much...?  As I think I have found some calm in this storm it brews yet again...I see him and think of him with her...how I long to be in her place again...the wounds are still fresh and the hurt is too...  It's hard to know that you're truly a woman now...you don't feel as if you're ripped at the seams of childhood and adulthood anymore...you know that you're an adult...you feel the heaviness of it in your heart as you look back and long for the solace and innocence of your youth and beauty...who knew that at 17 you could feel so old and so weary? Has my idealism lead to my ultimate heartbreak? Will this confusion ever end?  This time I know i'm not being overdramatic...I'm fighting the bitterness and hurt of lost love and praying for the strength to have dignity through all of this...God is my only hope now.  But in my darkness I know I'll see the light again...I'll find my inner picture of beauty and love and peace...It waits for me and I will wait too.  I'll try not to search when it isn't time for the scavenger hunt to begin.  I will let it run to me in due time, and until then my arms will remain open waiting to receive my peace.

      It's strange...the heart...  The heart can suffer so much yet find comfort in truth... It can be stabbed with pain yet love so much as the knives keep coming... When it feels as if it may freeze over, with a grain of faith it can burn brighter with hope and passion...

      Words of comfort...  "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always preserves."  -1 Corinthians 13:4-7

      Hey hey...  Still pretty sick...went to the doctor twice and I'm on 3 medicines...yaaaay...  But anyway...I promised to talk about USCS...  I liked it there, honestly...I felt comfortable and...idk just mainly good feelings, I guess.  For those that don't know, I got an award from the college for grades, etc...I can get early acceptance, and opportunites for scholarships...sooo...yay!  But anyway...on a serious level...which the above WAS...but on a more...idk...emotional level, i guess...  Why is it that everytime you suffer physically, something happens that makes you suffer internally/emotionally...not suffer, per se...but it just sort of plagues you?  I know that we're supposed to be tested in our everyday walk, etc...but still...  I don't feel like my body can tolerate so much stress at once...vague, yes.  But all I'm saying is pray for me...that's all I know to say for now.  I don't feel like going into much detail for the moment.

      I'm sooo worn out right now...  Went to my aunt and uncle's for memorial day dinner...went swimming there, too...chlorine makes me so sleepy.  A very paraphrased version of yesterday: Church was awesome yesterday morning b/c it was Pentecost Sunday...good stuff :-) Very uplifting! Obviously it touched on the book of Acts, which keeps coming up daily for some reason now that I'm studying it...it's awesome!   urlLink RON  was awesome...they rocked. I bought 2 copies of their CD...good stuff. Anyone want a free one?  If you let me know how to get it to ya you're welcome to it.  Gonna rest up a little...maybe I'll put up some photos or something interesting later.  Do I say awesome too much?

You guys are such a blessing to me...I know God put you in my life for special reasons!  All I can give is my love and gratitude...God bless you guys! I'm here if you need me :-D

      I've been studying the Book of Acts...for some reason this one just stuck out to me. Thought I'd share:  "But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things which I will yet reveal to you." --Acts 26:16  I found it encouraging...daily I begin to realize more and more my purpose for this life :-)

      Today's been a pretty busy day...don't read this if you want to be bored. I'm really tired.  Went to lunch with my mom at Ansley's, a restaurant my sister works at downtown. The food there is fantastic! Mmm...lasagna...  I took some photos downtown...so I might put them up later. Stopped into Poor Richard's and bought my summer reading books, The Illiad and Ethan Frome. Should be interesting...  Later I went to rent Big Fish and The Battle of Shaker Heights...I'll have to find some time to watch 'em...looking forward to it. Almost rented The Last Samurai and Down with Love, since I've not seen 'em and people keep telling me I should watch 'em...but I felt like watching the other two.  So later went to the mall with my friend from church, Ciji...we shopped and talked about some really cool stuff. I found stuff I wanted but didn't need :-P So I bought nothing...  Mmm I do need to go back to the bookstore and get some books I've wanted to read for a while...also should try to do a devotion before I go to bed...  I've never realized how random I truly am until now. Or how tired I am.

      For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you. --Matthew 10:20  One of my life verses :-) God showed it to me years back when I wasn't sure what to say when witnessing to others...how to approach them without frightening them off. As I grow older, and a little bit wiser, I realize how powerful this verse is...I don't know where I'd be without it today.

      My friend Laura and I wrote a script the other night over AIM. We probably had a little too much fun with it. It sort of was a very exaggerated romantic comedy...so exaggerated we might as well just call it parody. It's probably not that funny to you unless you really know us well, hehehe.  Lines from the script...both are coming from our female lead. (a very rough version because of our boredom/tiredness/geekiness...well my geekiness)  Laura (screenname withheld): "kevin and i were engaged to be married but i realized how it wouldn't work out because i still had feeling for someone and i didn't realize it until i saw you when i came home for christmas vacation"  RuminationsOf17: "you were wearing that reindeer sweater i knitted you when we were teenagers...sitting by the firelight...i saw you and my heart was rekindled with passion"  One day I might put the whole script up, if we ever finish. Why on earth we would, I don't know...  You know, Larua and I are gonna start a production company one of these days...haha.   Anyone willing to give us funding?  I didn't think so...

      Right now in my life, my young, unexperienced life, finding Love is the last thing I'm doing.  I'm just seventeen, going on eighteen in December...there are more important things to life, I realize.   I'm so content with being in love with God right now...I'm content in taking time to figure out who I am. I'm full of laughter once more...who knew a broken heart could heal in such a short time?  Do I continute to search for true love? Not now. I've got a lot of things to do, a lot of people to meet and places to see. Maybe love will find me again one of these days. I'm prepared for whatever God has for me...whether it be my future mate standing, waiting with arms open...  Or if it be a life of singleness. Being single doesn't have to mean being lonely, I now realize.  As long as I have God, I have peace.

      Today was the final day of my junior year. It's just weird to think that I'm not gonna see some of my senior friends again. I know there's the summer...but, still...  To think that I'll be in the same boat that they are in a year is unsettling. It's nice to know that God will be leading me to a new path...closer to His mission in life for me. But at the same time it's strange to know that I may be leaving behind the town I grew up in...the people I love. But hey, I know that you never forget where you come from...it's always a place close to your heart.  Hey, I still have some growing up to do...I have a lot to seek in the year to come as God guides me. As long as I'm closer to Him and His desires for me, that's all that matters.  But in case I forget I want to say congrats, Class of 2004! God bless you guys...to my friends, I love you all. Don't forget me, I know I won't forget you.  On a totally different note, I feel like I'm getting sick...I hope and pray I stay well, haha.

      Why does it have to feel like a tragedy to be such a romantic? I see couples embracing one another and I want what they have...the happiness and the thrill of new love, the youth and beauty of it all. At the same time I want to stay in a safety zone, all because I remember the day my heart was crumpled and thrown away like a piece of trash. I'm not sure if someone will retrieve it, as much as I hope for that to happen one day.  And then again, I'm not sure that I want them to.

      Ugh...today has been slightly tiring.  Had my English IV final today...glad to get it out of the way. It was tough, yet not as bad as I expected.  Today I had lunch with a good friend of mine. I've not really had a chance to talk to him in a while. It's nice to catch up. But sometimes things seem so strange between us now. We get along great but it's strange to see the different people we've become.  Well enough about that. I think I'm gonna fix some pics, write a little bit, and then I'll try to post some stuff later.

         Oh, narcissism. I need a better pic of me on my profile.  The full-size looks a lot better, but still it's a little creepy and weird.  But anywho...yeah...I wanna do something creative...write or take photos or...i'm not sure.  I'm just so incredibly restless. I have this energy inside me and I need to do something productive with it.  And everytime I try, whether it's taking photos, trying to play the guitar, or write, I just can't sit still.  I had the most fun ever making Ryan's present with Laura and Rose.  We made the "I *heart* Ryan" tees w/ the pic of his face...his expression was priceless.  I love doing stuff like that.  Why don't I more often? Not doing creepy stalkerly things like make fanclub shirts for my friends, but just...making t-shirts and designing stuff. Hmm...

      Life is good. I'm just happy to be here, that's all. That's all that matters. Being content with yourself and who you are is one of the best things there is, and wanting to get closer to God is always helpful in the process of becoming a better person and knowing what you want out of life.  I've chosen to be happy and not care what other people think and it's taken a realization that I can't control people and what they do, I can just be there to give advice and a empathetic nod. I can't change others, just myself. And i've changed into a happier, more fulfilled person. Thank God.

      My photo host must be down...hmm.  I'm gonna meet Laura at the school tomorrow, get the stupid senior photos taken that I probably won't buy, and we might hang out. Dunno what we'll find to do, if anything. Only reason I'm getting portraits done is so I'll have something to laugh at in the yearbook ten years from now.  There's this buzzing sound coming from the wall. It's annoying...either it's a messed up clock on the other side or there are bees in the wall. Or i'm just crazy. Maybe that's it.  A lady from Anderson College called me yesterday...caught me totally off guard. She was talkin' about how she "received my SAT scores...congratulations they were great, especially for taking them in June!"  Don't lie to me. They were awful. Maybe not AWFUL awful, but nothing to brag about, definitely.  She did some sort of phone interview, asking about extracurricular stuff...I hear typing in the background, got nervous I do believe. I guess I didn't do too bad though, 'casue she said I could have a good chance of early acceptance scholarship if I wanted to take it. I felt like a geek the whole time.  *sigh* I just don't know though...all this college junk is driving me crazy. I want it over with...too much to think about. I used to know where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do, but I've changed a lot even in the past few months.  Going to sleep, goodnight.

      After listening to my audio blogger post, I've realized how much it doesn't sound like me, at least I don't think so.  For some reason my accent sounds thicker recorded...what the heck?! Maybe it's 'cause I talked slower than I normally do...huh. Odd thing is I'm the only "southerner" of my family, hehehe.  Enough obsessing over it though 'cause it's too late. I'm gonna post another tonight or tomorrow 'cause I have interesting stuff to say, plus I'm much more relaxed about it. How stupid...it's just a phone call.  I was supposed to have senior portraits done today but I didn't...I'm going another day for them. My blood sugar dropped and I just felt really sluggish. School portraits are so cheesy. More on this later, though. My head hurts.

I take too many. It's like a disease.  Oh, so far the C.S. Lewis book is pretty interesting, for those who care to know. All about the temptation of man, a very good read.  I've decided to take a trip after graduation next year. Dunno where. Any suggestions? Know that's a way off, but still...  I have a lot of stuff to do, a lot of things to think about.

Oh, you have license to make fun of my hat if you'd want. I was just having a terrible hair day. I inherited the hat from my mom...she used to wear it back in the day.    Uhh...no kiddin' buddy.    Just HOW forbidden are these caverns if they have giant billboards advertising them? Oh, check out the "Elvis and Friends" billboard, too. How cheesy.    View from the cabin. It was pretty hazy that day...but still a lovely view.    One of my cousins. He looks like The Thinker. I like it.    Squirrel that terrorizes my house.    I met the Colonel! I chose the small version because I hate the big one. I look weird in it. I was tired and still sick that day. But, it was an amusing photo, I think.  That'll do for now.

      Guess who's home?  Why, it's me, Veronica...aren't you excited?  Yeah, I didn't think so...  I am so tired. The family reunion was the craziest thing ever. All the women sounded like a bunch of cackling hens in the kitchen...it was terribly loud. My dad literally went to talk to a wall, 'cause nobody would answer one of his questions! It was pretty amusing.  We had a lovely cabin, though...  It really sucked 'cause I got sick one day. I mean terribly, horribly sick. Thank God it was just for one day though...I would have died if it were longer. We're not sure if it was the heat or what...  I took a few photos...It was really too hectic to take a lot, so I may put up a couple of good photos in a little while.  Oh, I tried to do an audio post, but my cell phone had no signal in those mountains :-/ Maybe later, just to make up for it though.  More on my trip later, see ya!

      Allow me to rant on the horrors known as packing. Let the rambling begin...  Alright, so I know packing for a four day trip isn't nearly as bad as moving. Moving is this horrible pain all on its own...but back on track.  I never know WHAT to pack...and I don't want to be like my sisters and pack my entire closet. I just DON'T KNOW WHAT TO PACK. I don't want to overpack but I don't want to leave stuff behind, you know?   But I think I've found a balance...just throw in some jeans and t-shirts and I'm set. As long as it smells clean it's fine. Kidding, it WILL be clean, seeing as I've done 3 loads of laundry. Ahh, no need for personal style on a trip like this...it's all vanity, anyway (But I'll probably wear some of my crazy shoes or throw in some of my more amusing shirts. LAURA! I could wear the "Ryan" shirt! Hahaha! I'm kidding). Throw in some CDs, a sketchpad and pens, and a camera, and I'm set. Oh, and books too. Man, if ever stranded on a desert island I'd be hopeless.   --end of rambling--  So anyway...if I don't get a chance to say bye before I leave...then bye, kids. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Oh, and if you want me to bring you back a surprise, tell me before noon tomorrow!  Look for an audio post while I'm gone.  This is gonna be humiliating.

      Hey, sorry it's been a few days...  I've been kinda busy getting ready for the reunion...I have to clean my room and do laundry and pack...finish some shopping. *sigh* The reunion is gonna be super crazy. Almost everyone on my mom's side of the family, contained in two cabins. It'll be fun too, I suppose.  Oh, today I finally purchased a copy of  urlLink  The Screwtape Letters   by C.S. Lewis! I've been wanting to read the book for a while now...Lewis's other works are awesome, and I'm looking forward to reading this...  Anyway, there's still much laundry to be done and packing...a little more shopping as well. *sigh* More later, folks...

      Hello, everybody!  So I went to Ciji's and stayed last night...we had a blast talkin' about music and crazy stuff. Then we got some sleep, woke up for the ACT. Ah, the ACT...  It's much easier than the SAT...I took both just to see if I'd perform better on one than the other. I think I did okay on them both, but I want scholarship money! I know I took them both a little later than most juniors do, but this is the only time I really could this year.   Shooting for at LEAST a 1200 on SAT; 24 on ACT. I will just be so relieved once I finish applying to schools and get an acceptance letter. Wow, I realized how much I'm rambling. Forgive me, it's tiredness.  Maybe I'll write more later, but now I'm gonna go chill out a little.  Hey! Keep suggesting CDs, ladies and gents! I love getting feedback!

      I'm about to go to Ciji's and stay for the night...we both get to take the ACT tomorrow.  We're both a little nervous...ah, slight nerves have always helped me a little, though.  Pray that I use my brain, guys...  Oh, if I have time, I may go CD shopping sometime before Wednesday so I'll have something fresh and new to listen to on the trip...  Even though you guys have no idea what's in my CD collection now, I want suggestions :-) Who knows, maybe I'll unearth some CDs I have already (just not listened to in a while) and give them a spin...

      Tomorrow I'm going to take the ACT. I must say, I am very jubilant about the whole thing. *sarcasm* Well...at least I don't have to drive an hour and a half to my test site.  I've got a lot of stuff to do...I need to review, I've gotta pack for the family reunion. I'm leaving Wednesday morning...we're holding the reunion in Tennessee so everyone can meet halfway. *sigh* Oh boy...I need to take the Illiad and Ethan Frome and work on those on the way.  Ah, I also need to learn to drive. I'm seventeen years old and I don't even have a license. I have a car, I just can't DRIVE it. The logic in that? Umm...I'd say none. I know people worse off that I am, however.  More later. I'm gonna go eat, which is what I do best.

      This is really odd...  Today's the 2-year anniversary of my journal...  I originally had a LiveJournal, of which I found today...and it's still up. I was gonna link it, but it's horribly embarassing.  So, anyway, I just find it incredibly weird that of all days, I find it today, 2 years after my very first post.  Anyway...moving on.

No Holiday is complete without watching a special...and I loved the comic strip.  Schroeder...a character I've always liked. I guess the description is a lot like me, especially the neurosis part, hahaha. I'm halfway joking, but anyway...I've always thought of myself as a Charlie Brown, but I guess this is more fitting for me.   Wow, I sure did ramble.

      I promise, I do not watch Dr. Phil or Oprah. Unless my mom is watching TV in the same room as I am, ugggh.  Laura, was it you that suggested that Dr. Phil looks like a gopher? Hmmm...  Oh, but I digress! This list was on my own accord. This is more for my personal remembrance, but feel free to comment or ask me to clear up anything, 'cause I know I can be somewhat confusing.  Veronica's List for Self-Improvement: 1) Say "dude" and "awesome" less often. It gets really old. Expand the vocabulary. 2) Be a little less shy when meeting new people 3) Help others more often...do some good in the community!  4) Take more time to talk to God (this is actually top priority on the list, I'm just typing as I think) 5) While I'm on that topic, I think I need to learn how to better express my faith. It's hard to explain...I'm sure that is really gonna get misintepreted. See what I mean? I'm much too vague. I guess on a broad scale I need to be less vague. 6) Take a photography class, in other words, improve certain skills. Think about maybe even brushing up on guitar...hmm. 7) Be more empathetic 8) Laugh more often.  9) I always say, "There's always room for improvement". This list could get longer, so I'm going to stop.  Just a little taste of what goes on in my head.  Trust me, you don't want to see the whole thing. It gets quite messy. Plus, there are cobwebs in certain areas, I believe.

      Always room for improvement, I say...these could certainly use some.    Taken on the way to my aunt and uncle's house...a nice place. Wish it would have turned out a little better.    A few on the shops on Main Street. I have tons of shots of downtown...I'll have to put them up one day.    Taken in the car. It's okay I guess, considering I was in a moving vehicle.    Another macro. Ew, you can see an ant in the flower, hehe.  I originally had a photo of myself up here but took it down because I thought it was ugly. Come to think of it, I think all photos of myself are bad.

      I'm a little worn out. I got up around 5:30 to get ready to take my SAT. I had to go all the way to Newberry...nearly an hour and a half. A very nice drive I've gotta say, despite the longness...I don't think I did TOO terribly on the thing...  Anyway I took a few pictures on the way to and from Newberry. This was one of the more...umm...interesting ones. This will be the only one I put up for now, 'cause I don't feel like resizing the others (yes I HAVE to resize them. I dunno why). I'm extremely tired...more next post, that's a promise.     So tell me, what is that thing? I know it's something spraypainted on a rock? Is it a poison potato? Or something that I don't know of because i'm very sheltered? Hehe...Hmm...It's weird. And quite stupid.  Anyway...yeeeeah. So we ate at the Cracker Barrel and they had the most amusing Hangman game there. You actually hang the body parts onto the noose. Very disturbing, and suprising that it was a replica of a '50s game. I almost bought it for show since it was only five bucks.  Went to softball games w/ Ciji...just basically getting home. So tired. Gonna wind down now.

      Yeah...I think I promised some photos.  These are just some two of the MANY photos I took today...I'm gonna have to have a separate blog or website for all my photos. I think for the month of May I have about a hundred...It's terrible.  But now enough talking! The photos:    I was sort of playing around with macro...I dunno. It's an okay picture, I guess. I took several shots of the flowers that grow near our house...this was one of the better ones, I think.    This was sort of accidental...I didn't mean to get such a close up, haha. I was trying to get my dog, Molly, to sit still but ended up with this. Thought it made for a very interesting and amusing picture!   So there's some pictures...I'll put up a few of my town later on if I can't sleep...I was supposed to a few nights ago, but those who know me well know that I forget to do stuff. A lot.  "I'm really gonna have to get up a webpage for my photos soon..." thought the procrastinator.

I blog for my personal enjoyment.   Boy, am I a geek.    urlLink Public photo album!    That's right...now I'll just start saying "new photos are up" and you go there. I'm not sure why, really.

      First off, I guess I should say that I have that song stuck in my head. If you've not heard it, it's by  urlLink Sondre Lerche . I personally enjoy his music. But that's just me.   Secondly, I dunno...things have been odd lately, rather odd indeed. It's like communicating with people has become, well,&nbsp; daunting. I'm not sure if that's the word I'm searching for, but&nbsp;for now&nbsp;it seems fitting.&nbsp; Everyone seems so "bleh", and I hate it. I wish&nbsp;I could do something to remedy everyone, but I guess that's quite impossible for any human. All I can do is offer a listening ear and a bit of advice, but that's only if you ask for it (the advice part). &nbsp;I guess my feelings have been mixed...a lovely blend of joy and melancholy, much like a yogurt of emotional sorts.&nbsp; Missing people is never fun, it just seems as if several of the people I care for so much is far away from me, whether the distance be measured in miles or in mindset. I hope that makes sense. Tonight I feel like playing with words a little, maybe not in a poetic sense but, rather getting away from my droning "Veronica-ish" tones.   As of late I've felt like listening to music, walking outside in white linen dress, and just taking photos of friends, having a picnic,&nbsp;maybe reading a book under a tree, and just sitting under the stars talking about life with the one&nbsp;I love.&nbsp; The idea of simplicity really is appealing to me in such a complicated timeframe. My desire conflicts with reality, it seems. Everything in reality is just so...well, I'm sure you know the word I'm looking for. I'm not saying everything is bad, but I have a feeling that maybe a few of you know what I'm getting at.&nbsp;     ***  &nbsp;  On a very random note, I had a dream last night that a fluffy white cat with a smushed face latched itself onto my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I was wearing a late 50s-early 60s style dress walking from a school or a college. In the dream it wasn't too fun, but waking up and thinking of it was quite funny.      ***  &nbsp;

       urlLink Laura  wanted me to give her a shoutout, so I will.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though, the term "shoutout" annoys me because I think of stupid people calling the radio stations asking the sleazy Deejays to let them give "a shoutout to their homies in Greeeenviiiile!"   I dunno.   Anyway, Laura, you are the coolest. I wish I could be more like you. Dangit, we still have to make shirts.  So, I'm really starting to itch to see  urlLink Garden State . It looks gorgeous.

Or at the time, I just really wanted to draw a stick person. Come to think of it, I draw stick people a lot. No wonder I'm in an artistic slump.  I still have to upload pictures from vacation.

      So, I came back home Sunday. I just wanted to have time to recuperate from travelling. &nbsp; I'm not sure why my posts have really been lacking lately...I guess I just have times where I sort of like to keep everything to myself and just not really share. I'm not sure why... &nbsp; Anyway, so here's some really cool news...my cousin, technically my 2nd but whatever...well anyway he and his wife are moving to Seneca, from Florida! I'm very excited...because they will have opportunities at a church there...United A/G! Stephen will be doing music ministry and Natalie will be doing children's ministry...they start in September, which is great. I can't wait to go out there to support them... &nbsp; I dunno...it just seems that God is opening a door for me when I needed one most. I've been on this constant search for a church...maybe this is it for the time being. I am not sure. &nbsp; My vacation was ok...we walked through this little old town, Hendersonville...it's wonderful...little antique shops and such. I know we have stuff like that here, but it's just good to get away from everything... &nbsp; I think I'm doing better...I know I may not make much sense now. &nbsp; School starts August 5th, though. Bleh. At least I graduate in May, though. I went for registration...the principal was really nice, which was a little shocking. She swapped my schedule for free. I just went up there for her to clarify it and she offers to change it, which, is awesome! Now I only have to go for a full A- day:AP Lit, TA, Physics, and Internship.&nbsp;B-days I only have 2 classes: Calculus and AP Gov't/Econ!  &nbsp; More to say, more to think about. Maybe I'll put up some pictures.

I have a lot to say, I think. I just think I'm suffering from a mental overload and I need time to just...chill out? I dunno.  So, armed with my camera and my last bit of sanity, I bid thee farewell.

Well yeah, not now. I'm happy...none of that stuff I said matters so much. I think I was highly delusional...or something. I dunno. But yesterday I had one of the best times ever...with a really great guy.  Oh, I fell this morning...my leg is so disgusting. It's all scratched up and the knee is all gross. Guess I can't wear shorts or skirts for a while. Also cut my hand and scraped my arm. It's gorgeous. Not really. More like disgusting.

      So, got my ACT scores back. They were really good! I especially mastered the verbal part, hehe! Then again, ACT is much easier than SAT. Anyway...  So I've been wondering whether I should cut my hair again or let it grow...I don't have any really good pics of me up here, so nobody can really determine that for me...  I feel like making something...presents for people...mmhmm. I really don't know.  Relationships...courting or dating...whichever, no matter for this discussion. Someone once said to me "God gave you seven years to be a teenager".  So yeah...seven years, seven years to develop ourselves into men and women of God. Why are teenagers focused on such frivolous things as boyfriends and girlfriends? Right now, I'm gonna leave it at that :-) I'm still very much in thought...

Then again, who would be? I still have a little bit of my summer work to do, but it shouldn't be bad...writing essays is never THAT bad...  Okay, so I'm lying a little.

      I was standing in the kitchen, making fried okra with my mom...I cook and stuff, but I never really realized how relaxing it is until today...  Maybe I'll make some fritters later on...mmm...  I don't know, I'm just in the mood to cook.  So, I never wrote about yesterday. I went up to the store Daniel's family owns, because his mom wanted to take pictures to send to Daniel. Laura and her sister Emily had nothing better to do, so they came and picked me up. I should probably explain that Daniel's in the army, hehe. When I got there, my friend Craig gave me such a big hug, I thought I was going to die. I couldn't quite breathe. But it's always fun to go in there...  Craig snapped a few shots of me looking stupid, then Daniel's mom came 'round the store to show off hilarious pictures of the guys sporting fake mustaches and other various cheap goods they'd ordered from some catalogue. Also, there were a few shots of gummy bears playing football, just something you need to see at least once before you die. Ah, such greatness.  Craig then thought it would be a good idea to raid Daniel's room...so he asks for permission to get off work for a second and we walk down to the house...Laura and Emily decide to run up to the theatre. When we got to the house, Craig and I ran up to Daniel's room to reminisce a little and look through his stuff. See, it wasn't really RAIDING! It was...kind of nice...but at the same time sad...  I should probably put up that picture of that sign Laura, Emily, and I saw...I won't describe it...it's just something you must see.
