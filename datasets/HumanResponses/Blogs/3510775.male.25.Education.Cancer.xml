       urlLink   I read an interesting  urlLink blog  that discusses the relationship between freedom and passion.  Isn't it nice to know that there are  urlLink people out there thinking  about topics like this?? :-)  I found his statement that we are "only prisoners of of our past choices" to ring true.  You may have noticed that I was also delving into the idea of choice (problem solving) in my last  urlLink post .  For some reason, it's been on my mind lately.  It just seems to me that we all get caught up in a fatalistic view of our lives.  We tell ourselves that we can't do this or that, or we "have to" do something, when what we really need is to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps and get in gear.  Our own mental wishing and negativity seem to prevent this from happening.  Take me, for example.  I  urlLink whine and moan  to myself inside my head. "I should give up  urlLink smoking  for good." "I should  urlLink exercise  more." "I should  urlLink eat to fuel  my body." "I should  urlLink date  more girls."  You get the idea.  It boils down to this:  You must choose to do it.   urlLink Then you do it .  Period.  So, I mean to pick myself up by the bootstraps and start living my own life.  Inspiring, isn't it??  I'll keep you updated on how it's going.  Until then, enjoy  urlLink this little morsel...

      I'm leaving On a jet plane (on Sunday). Don't know when I'll be back again.  Actually, I do.  I'll be back in a week.  I think I can handle a week with the fam-damily.  My buddy  urlLink James  was kind enough to offer to care for  urlLink Mr. D.  while I'm gone.  What can I say?  Santiago es la bomba otra vez.

      What to do, people?  What to do?  Little bro's b-day on Sunday... Little sis's college graduation a week from Sunday... but I gotta take care of my dog, and I hate running around on my vacation.  Should I just go up for the graduation?  Should I go up for the birthday too, and spend a possibly excruciating 10 days in Michigan?  Let me know what allsyalls think.  And step on it!  :-)

       A word on the topic I'd like to mention When it comes to [hacking Linksys] Whoo!  I'm representin'.  Foolio neighbors set up a Linxis wireless netwerk somewheres on our strizeet, yo.  Running channel 6ix.   urlLink Inte__eer_ng w__h ou_ con_____on .  The center of the BBH was smack dab on our couch.  It was a total eclipse of the Big Dark Cloud.  So we changed our channel!   What's up now?  Punk!   I also changed their channel just for fun.  If you want to change it, the IP is  urlLink 198.162.1.1 .  The login is admin and the passphrase is admin.  Try to preent stuphs from their preenter, stuphs lyke  Stupid Link-sissy!  We loathe your channel 6!  Stop tormenting my Xtreme G!  AAAAAAGHHHHH!

      James and I have a theory that most people think of the Internet as a Big Dark Cloud.  The original BDC came from the box of our  urlLink D-link wireless router , where the  urlLink handy set-up diagram  showed the computer connection. Oh!  The computer bone's connected to the router bone! The router bone's connected to the cable modem bone! The cable modem bone's connected to the - you guessed it - the Notorious B.D.C. bone.  :(  I thought it would be fun to search Gügel for the BDC (is that a metasearch?), and this is what I came up with.  I haven't really read it, but I think he's putting forth a concerted effort to wax comical.  Post your r(ants/aves/iots/esidues) and let me know what tú piensas.  Also try looking up his new words  urlLink potatos  and  urlLink moreso  on Merriam-Webster.  You'll find that they don't exist.  Unfortunately, what do exist are his comic book collections and critiques of poor UK movies.  All in all, I rate it Ph - for Phuglerific.  PS Nice beer bottle, Mikey Boy.

      You realize that the one you love very much isn't for you.  You walk the brink and you learn to fly, you break free of your Self, you break free of your awful past, you see a new Light. Salsa dancing.  Who knew you could dance so well, Casanova? Melding of minds, tippy-tap go the dance steps.  Better than you imagined.  And when you let loose, nothing but Sky raining down on Earth.  As it should be. I am all men.  As it will ever be. All mankind from these loins.  As it ever was. We saw it coming.  Nothing: kissing bliss and a shy raccoon.  Life is renewed.  Reconciliation without penance.  Night.

      Back home, I keep noticing the smallest details: how thin the blades of grass are; how good the house smells with coffee brewing; the way my Dad grills the tri-tip; how my toilet flushes with just one push.  When I went to push down the handle, I think I almost broke it; I'm so used to more resistance!  Even with the cooler weather and the grey days, I miss being home.

      The revelation of )(, which was given to him to light the path of peace to his disciples; and was made known through his angel at the Trial to his servant Xenophilus, who testified to the practice, even to all that he IMed.  Xenophilus to the seven clubs that are in Europe: Abiding peace and focus from )( that is, was, is to come, isn't, wasn't, and will never be.  Look at )( but do not see it; speak )( but do not say it; take )( but do not )(.  Glory through non-glory, name that is not Eternal Name, forever and never, Amen.  "I am non, I am always not myself," says )(, that is, was, is to come, isn't, wasn't, and will never be.  To )( non-glory fornever and ever, Amen.  I, Xenophilus, your brother who share with you in )( the State (that is non-state), was on the peninsula called Iberia because of the path of )( and the testimony to )(.  I was seated in focus, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a subwoofer saying, "Blog on the Internet what you see and post it for the seven clubs, for Joy-Eslava, Kapital, Ministry, La Habana, Las Caballerizas, Oxígeno, and Yo-yo.  Then I turned to see whose voice it was, and on turning I saw seven golden turntables, and in the midst of the turntables I saw one like the DJ of Joy-Eslava, clothed in a black suit with a golden buckle on his belt.  His head and his hair were white as a strobe light, white as snow; his eyes were like laser beams, his kicks were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of Niagara.  In his right hand he held seven lit mouth candies, and from his mouth came a mic, and his face was like the spotlight shining with full force.  When I saw him, I fell down as if ODed.  But he placed his right hand on me, saying, "Fear not!  I am the wasn't and the isn't, the is and the was, the maybe.  I was unfocused, but now Satori.  I have the key to )(.  Now blog what you have seen, what may be, and what did take place after what's about to happen.  As for the mystery of the seven lit mouth candies that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden turntables: the seven lit mouth candies are the angels of the seven clubs, and the seven turntables are the seven clubs."
