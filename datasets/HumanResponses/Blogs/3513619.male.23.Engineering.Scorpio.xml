       tommy was here this weekend. kinshu was also here. they reached here at 12 on thursday and I could not go to meet them. finally i left office at around 9 in the night (after dropping gopi's frnd at prasadz.com) and decided that the next day would be a leave for me. took the boston tickets also, as the fares were going to be hiked...as per the thomas-cook guy! after some pleasantries and dinner, myself and kinshu left for my house...where kinshu thought arora was hiding from him becos he was smoking (arora and ashwini were in the balcony)!!!! then he told about aunty finding our suttas in tommy's jacket and all the related stuff...bacardi ka dhakkan and ash in ghar when tommy and aunty went back last time...we talked about a few things after the futbol match...portugal won in that. woke up early and went to recieve nanaji. back and went to hospital, back to guesh house and slept and lunch and then back to TV - hospital - paradise - GH - dinner - hospital - GH - futbol (greece defeated france!!) - back to madhapur. what happened after that in madhapur is history...more about that later! ;-)  next day, reached GH at 1.30 and then charminar and then paan shop due to which nanaji almost fainted after the paan (although "it was very tasty"). anyways, got biscuits from karachi bakery and then after tp, slept and then biryani from hyd house. left them at begumpet station...somehow i felt that tommy was getting senti that this might be the last meeting...well, it might be but there is nothing to get senti about. phir to milenge hi baad mein. senti hoke bola ki chennai ka trip banao, kinshu would be cutting a AR Rehman CD for me, tommy was asking the duration of journey from chennai to hyd!! aunty asked ki bby to aa rahe ho na!   went to dhiru's house after that. they had bought a comp the last weekend (good one) and then we were just chatting. tried to reason out things with dhiru about his love life and needless to say, failed in that. he is one utterly confused man! i tried telling him to make an effort to come to normalcy, but he does not understand at all. he is hell bent on giving his own fundas - avishek, hum itna commitment diye....blah blah blah...jindagi aise thode hi chalta hai - gyanesh has already stopped giving fundas to him, it seems. came back but could not meet moti - was damn tired. bipin mamaji came yesterday with mamiji. i thought i might not recognise him, but i did! went to golconda fort - sound and light show - fourth time. rained a bit, but it was fine. enjoyed. found mamiji and mummy to be so similar in some respects - yeh nahi karna, wo nahi karna, bike se yahan nahi aana, bahut bheed hai, etc etc. baap re!! got up late today (the alarm wala cell was with mamaji) and came to office. sharada ka last day tha...met her and bade her good bye.  lakshmi pathi itha sent a detailed mail about "exit procedures". now this has also started! till now, the feeling has not sunk in that i would be leaving hyd and the people here and would be going to a totally different country!  sm told that swapna, monu and chandini were waiting for her near her office. swapna was there for her visa..she sent me a very senti message when tommy was here and i chose not to reply! an senti hain hi nahi hum to mere ko pretend karne ka man nahi kar raha tha! she feels i am not keeping in touch with her these days and all! what i feel is that, all these things cannot be decided conciously...if this is happening, that means the relationship is like that and if you try to twist it purposefully, the purpose is not served!

       well...this will be a more fresh post...have been in the MS/US mode off late...went to see the movie Dev last night...i bought a watch in prasadz complex when we had entered the shop for window shopping. came out and asif ended up buying another pair...we decided all this was getting a bit costly and so went out and bought a baaja and were playing with that...ha ha ha...masti aayi! got all the travel tickets today: hyd - vijaywada - ranchi on 30th June and ranchi - bby on 23rd august - damage was 3312 bucks. next al italia tickets for bby - milan - boston on 27th aug - damage: 31799 bucks!  bhagwaan bachao..well...about the topic of the post today, the less said the better ;-)

       well...lots of thing to write...lets see, how many things i can recollect. will start from chennai and then hyd and then bby and then back to hyd.  chennai...the visa day. reached there on tuesday morning and was cursing chennai...na bijli, na pani and i was just sitting there...finally i could sleep. muthi came and we went to the beach...we started talking about many things - deepti, monu, tommy, swapna, job, oracle, l&t..lots of things. i found that we think the same way, but in the end i do one thing and muthi does the opposite. Perhaps that was the reason why muthi stopped feeling comfortable with me sometime back. Went to see the US consulate while we were coming back. I could actually feel my heart skip a beat when i saw that building! well, came back and muthi's housemate started giving fundas and those people started some damn arguement over some equally damn topic. I took a bath and thought that I should recheck the documents...for the nth time. i was actually memorising the things...just as i used to do before the exams...only this time, i was lot more nervous. xxx lakhs in savings account, yyy in pf, zzz in fd and so on. rattofied the prof names as well...ha ha. messaged monu and moti (rhyming names!!) to wake me up...went to sleep at 1:45, i remember seeing the watch at 2:30 also. woke up again at 4:00 am and then at 5 and then at 6 from missed calls. took a bath and then was ready, muthi was getting late and i irritated. finally, we could clear the traffic jam and his combing sessions at 7:30 - i had thought of 7:00, for an appointment of 8.45 - and went to his office to swipe the card and then to embassy at 8:00. surprisingly i was not too nervous...other people were very veyr very nervous. anyways, went inside at 9 and could come out at 10 with the VISA power!! was very very relieved and called a lot of people to let them know that i got thru...could feel some people getting really happy for me and some people thinking ki they missed the bus. i will put in the order in which i called people...maybe thats an indication of their relative importance in my life...ha ha...this is callled over-analysis...!!! went online, talked to bhaiya. came back, after lunch, muthi to office and me back in house. i started calling and messaging people (again relative importance!!). Pummy m called up after getting my message and she was asking the program, duration, general haal chaal and it ended with me saying that i am going to bby and she telling me that "monu bhi bby mein hi hai"...11001 lag jayega kya - again over over over analysis...considering what happened in bby! anyways, back to hyd by the evening train.  reached here and deepti wished me for the visa. then in office, it felt nice to come back beaming with a smile. went to palace heights for team treat and when i came back, the passport had already reached the travel desk..collected that and 5 years, multi-entry visa...whoa! thought of going to bby on thu only, but rain and Birla temple were the hurdles. Sorry :-) went to birla temple the next morning with moti and got the bby tickets. had a nice onward journey...they showed the movie jodi no 1 and the movie was actually good in some scenes! reached bby at 8 in the morning. was just chatting till 11 and then aunty came and told with a wink in the eye that swapna and monu were coming to see me...!!!! swapna wanted to see me...but that was fine with me...maybe because of the reason that tommy knew what was there between us...maybe aunty also knew ;-) anyways, we did not talk much, we all were seeing 'friends' for most of the time! then we played carrom and then off to juhu. mota came there...his condition is equally pathetic...bahut kharaab haalat hai bhai! apne saath bhi waisa hi kuch hone wala hai! anyways, we went to mocha, had hooka in the mocha and then back to the prithvi thater to see the play..seeting arrangement and the ambience was too good. had a nice time. after the play mota went back to college to study for the sunday exam and we came back to juhu beach :-D was there till 3 and then woke up at 7 to go the mud island beach. bhendu ki ma'am ke husband ka buglow....ufff....the less said the better!!! anyways, we had a nice time there as well...tommy was getting senti in the end that this might be the last time we will be together...but i did not think so and so was not overly senti! milenge hi yaar...milenege kaise nahi! maybe the frequency will be less but we will definitely meet. his statement was "masti to bahut aaya lekin yahi soch ke chaat lag raha hai ki this might be the last time"...he said almost the same thing in the mail the next day!   papa rang up after i reached here and was stressing that i should get the tickets and all..only later i realised that i was already VERY late...papa ko pata chalta to maar hi daalte mere ko! :-)  anyways, rest in the next post..whenever that will be. this was lying as a draft for a long time and i thought that as i was waiting for the damn adpatch to get over, i might as well post it! jayant m rang me up expecting to talk to tommy, but abhi tak office se hi nahi nikal paye hain hum to!!! :-(( kal chutti maar hi lenge ab to! bahut hua...but i dont want to neglect this office work as well...you never know! leave at a good note :-)

       going to bby...have to write about a lot of things when i am back...next update on monday!  ****************************** -------- Original Message -------- Subject: Resignation from Oracle Date: Fri, 18 Jun 2004 15:01:52 +0530 From: a v i s h e k   To: kkinoshi_US   CC: RAMANATHAN  , "Sawant,Ravindra"     Hi,  This mail is to let you know that I am putting down my papers in Oracle. I wish to pursue higher studies and so I am resigning from this job. I dwelled on this decision for a long time but I feel this is the correct time for me to do my specialization. It was a pleasure working in this organisation for more than two years and would surely like to repeat my stint provided my skill set matches the company's requirements at some point in future. I would like to leave Oracle by July 30th to be able to join my university. Please let me know if it is ok with you for me to leave by that date.  Thanks and Regards, Avishek.  --   O God!!, Give me patience.....n n.....Give it to me soooon!!    --   O God!!, Give me patience.....n n.....Give it to me soooon!!    ******************************

       hello people....  abhi manager aaya and uske saath conversation: manager: hello sir! how are you? me: fine manager: can we talk for a minute... me: ya...sure manager (in his cabin): hi...whats up? me: everything fine (smiling heeee heee...) manager: so, how are things going? anything positive? anything decided (in the morning he had scolded my team lead that if he knew about my plans, why didn't he tell this to my manager in US) me: ya...almost... manager: what almost. got any admission? me: ya...University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth manager: good. where is that? me: Massachusetts (i could not believe he was asking where Univ of Massachusetts is...he was asking the state where the univ is!!!!. he has been in US for around 3-4 years and uske baad yeh halat...) manager: stamping done? (he knew i had gone to chennai for that) me: ya...waiting for passport... manager: they gave you funds? me: ya...full funding manager: great..good news. me: hmm....(smiling all the time) manager: so, what are your plans? me: (ab aaya oonth (camel) pahaad ke neeche)...am waiting for the passport with the visa stamped and then was planning to talk to you. i want to get relieved from here on July 22nd manager: actually there is a girl who we want to offer a position in the team. so, it would help if you could make your plans clear. Dont mistake me (whatever this meant) me: ya, i understand. there would be a smooth transition if she joins before i leave manager: ok...good man. so, you can start shopping :-) me: ya manager: what about the tickets? me: ya...i asked a couple of people. I was thinking of asking the rosenbluth people (oracle travel agents) for the fares.... manager: no yaa ...dont do that. they will quote higher prices. go for little known airlines...you have to go through europe only...ask Italian airlines, sri lankan airlines, etc. dont think about the route they will take, but they will be cheap. me: ok...i will find out about that. thanks manager: good yaa...good for you. hope you are coming back.. me: ya...i dont see any point settling there... manager: no, i was talking about you joining oracle me: (smiling ha ha ha) ya...maybe. as such my family is there in blore, so i would like to come back to blore manager: great...so all the more reason that you join oracle...! me: heee heee heee manager: heee heee heee. me: i will send a mail for this...to make it official... manager: ya...sent it to ravi (team lead), ken(US manager) and siva (our director here) me: ok. manager: hey...dont mistake me yaa..(he was virtually asking me for my resignation, so thoda guilty feel kar raha tha!!) me: no, its fine, i understand your dilemna. manager: great.  After that i talked to the US manager also. He asked the univ name and said that he was happy for me and that he appreciated that i chose to talk to him about this, when i came to know about this (he thought that i came to know about my admission today). I told him that we might be getting the new person in the next couple of weeks and so it would be a smooth transition without having much affect on team's productivity. He congratulated me and told that we would talk in more "details" later...i said fine.  so, after spending 2 years, 29 days in this organisation, i have finally resigned...first resignation mail type karna hai abhi...hopefully many more are to follow :-))  siva in raj's room now...masti :-) siva bula na le!

       me back after a break. was not able to post anything since the last few for one reason or the other...came back from blore, met her one night, roamed about and departed after a bit of "saalu saalu"...ha ha ha, i dont think i will ever forget this word!   talked to vishnu yesterday and came to know that his visa was rejected..became really upset after that...are these the signs of things to come! talked to ravi, tarun, shruti, and lots of people about this and when i saw that nothing was really helping me, thought that i should stop thinking about it. actually, there is little that anybody can do in this case. I mean, ultimately you have to reason it out yourself. well, told gyandu that i would be coming to his house in the evening..actually wanted to run away from all this.   saw "day after tomorrow" last evening...pretty dekheble movie. good graphics...to put it on record here, everytime i say something like this, i start thinking about the opinions of the people in front of me..as in what are they thinking and all, are they thinking the same way or not. But then, this is MY oponion...maybe, this shows the level of confi the concerned person is having at that moment, and i am surely nowhere near my peak of confidence as of now!! he he...maybe i am overanalysing things while i write blog, but then there is nothing wrong in that... :-)  nothing more than all these to write actually...the feeling in the stomach is getting stranger and stranger as the D day is coming nearer and nearer!  well...yes, the subject. 'n' number of centuries back, people used to communicate by 'kabootars', then came the stage where emmisaries were sent, then came the concept of writing and letters came in the vogue. write your message on a piece of paper...put a stamp (or dont put it) and post...viola! the other person gets it in some days. simulataneously came fax, telegram, private couriers etc etc. then came the internet revolution and with it came the e-mail. was pretty fast, convinient.....and a good timepass!! then came the messenger - the instant messenger..was still faster...now i guess the latest entrant is our very own blog. read the other person's blog, make your own comments in your blog, the other person reads yours and replies (for convinience you can paste the blog you are referring to, in your own post!)...with the tacit understanding that this will never be discussed in person...ha ha ha....way to go! lets see what new things come up ;-)

       Was going thru one blog and found this entry...strange, why people, at times find it so hard to come to grips with the reality! come on, accept it and do what you really want to, rather than always trying to keep yourself in check and thinking whether this is right or wrong! *********************************************** I am really surprised at my self.In the past 2 weeks I am actually done a lot of unexpected things...which i never could believe that i could do.  Idon't know..I feel I cannot trust any man.I keep wondering how can girls allow any stranger to come close to them and actually let the men own them.I used to think I would never allow any man to touch me.But, I am so surprised that I actually let somebody to do it(!!!)..Not sure why I am writing this here.I hope nobody ever reads this. I had promised God that this will never happen again..like this illegally. but,yes I dont know how i feel so comfortable with him..I take him equivalent to Ragini..Like I ask my girl friends to kiss me, cuddle me...the same way I want him to do that..I actually asked him yesterday...I showed him my cheek and asked him (mujhe pyar karo)..Surprise...  I still have not told his name and i think i will call him cutie in all my future references.In fact, I call him cutie now also. ***********************************************

       he he he...i dont know why i put that title for this post, just felt like putting it there...  had been to blore this weekend...and it was QUITE eventful, to say the least...!!! ;-) up and down, both ways by bus...did not sleep while going (the co-passenger was so restless and did not let me sleep the whole night!! ha ha ha!!!!) well, the trip as such was pretty laid back and though did not take much rest in blore, we did not do anything worthwhile as well. jiju was alone and we were giving company to each other. did some shopping on sat evening and then came back. One interesting thing was mummy ka call. Will write about that in detail later. came back to hyd on monday morning. came to office a bit earlier than usual. went to the bank to deposit money and get the statement...mere account mein kitna paisa hai, wo batane ka bhi 100 bucks...he he, but then this is the price you have to pay for all their service and anytime money and all!! anyways, its fine. If you expect professionalism, then you ought to be ready to pay for that as well. but as was to be expected, for giving a simple statement, those duffers need a day...will have to go to them again today. slept early last night (12:30) and came to office earlier than usual(10) after a hair cut (guess i have started getting prepared for the interview/fight/duel on 16th!!) abhi not much work...so got down to update my long-forgotten diary!  well...about mummy. had called her up on sat after reaching blore to tell that i had indeed reached there...told her about a few bandis i had seen - one in hyd and another one in blore. Ofcourse, ammaji ne socha ki i have 'seen' them for myself or something like that. next day, papa calls up, just like that (which in itself is pretty unusual), tried to talk about this thing or that thing and then ammaji was on line. after sometime came the big question - bhumiyar hai na?? (me smiling now also, as i write this...ha ha ha). i said, ofcourse (i think i heard a sigh of relief also!!) and then it turned out that they were thinking that i wanted to marry!!! then came the SUGGESTIONS - karna hai to kar lo, dont think about bhaiya and many other things. I think i got an idea about how people are forced to marry...ofcourse, i was not being forced here, but then i got an idea about how the scene could have been, had that been the case! well, i said no, but i guess, mom-pop ko dar lag raha hai ki pata nahi kya kya karega amrica jaake! in a sense, they are right also..who knows what might happen ;-) lekin abhi shaadi.....naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!! no way! abhi to chota sa nanha sa munha sa bachcha hoon main!  mom called up last night also...to ask if papa ka courier (passbook and all) mila ki nahi. i told her that i got it and had just slipped from my mind to call up after that. well, the real reason came after that..."kal venus ka kuch to hai - MAT DEKHNA" ha ha ha...i immediately remembered the scene of some 90s...total solar eclipse, me trying to see the sun and mom pulling all the shades so that not even the reflected rays come inside! she knew that i wanted to see and she made sure that i did not...abhi bhi she is sure that i will try, and maybe try kar bhi len! :-D mom was very happy ki "anju aur sanju to bach hi gaya...US mein to kuch nahi hai..."...ek bechara tutu hi phas gaya! i guess she is still concerned because this thing will happen again after some 12 years. Uske baad 120 saal, no tension! well, to think from her point of view, she is not entirely wrong. but then you got to expect that people are responsible enough to take these decisions, that people are mature enough to understand the implications of all these things. but then mummy to mummy hi hai!  bhaiya buzzed me on the messenger in the morning. i guess, he had an idea that i was a bit tensed about visa and all. he started talking about that and then we discussed about lots of other things, as we did never before. nothing as such, but perhaps an indication that we are more at ease with each other now. he was giving a few ideas (he did not want me to use the word non-immigrant visa..etc etc). I dont know why but as the D-day is getting nearer, i am feeling something strange in my stomach...the way you feel when as a 12 year old, you have to read the news to the whole school in the morning assembly!!! i know that i should not be feeling this way - as bhaiya says - koi galat kaam thode hi kar rahe ho to dar rahe ho - but then i cant help it. i cant see my entire mehnat and expectations and dreams becoming null just because the person in front of me does not think the way i do. it all happens so suddenly...20 second mein 4 saal ka mehnat barbaad! lets see....and lets hope and lets pray!! 8 days to go....  hmm....thats it for today, i guess. checked my bug queue and saw that there was an addition in that...thoda kaam uspe bhi kar len...  well, how can i end without mentioning about the incident which want to write about and still dont want to write about. I want to write because, i believe i should mention that here, dont want to write because i dont know what to write!! badi mushkil hai! well, to say the least, i dont know whether that was right or wrong. on the one hand i think that its not such a thing that you give so much importance to it, but then if the other person has to say sorry to God and is so much disturbed about that, then you have to think again about the whole episode, which started from "saalu saalu" and then ended at the place where it did (hey - it ended with saalu saalu as well!!!). i would like to think it this way, if it is the natural thing to follow, then let it be...why try to control yourself so much. but, then "everything should be in limits"...and the differnce in opinion is there because of the difference in this LIMITS...to put it on record, i think it was fine with it, but then ofcourse this was not the case with the other person. perhaps this is the reason why i wanted to write, but still did not want to write!!

       well....its friday again and it has been long since i have been to blore..ummm...almost a month! i had nothing much to do this weekend and so decided that i might as well go there and do nothing...jiju would be alone and so i could give him some company...besides i have some company for going to blore as well...too many companies...am sure the economy is on a rise ;-)  had a pretty bad/rough/pathetic 4-5 hours last evening...first i got an sms from HER on reliance that she was third in the college...69 percent and all. i had a feeling that she was trying to get in touch with me. Anyways, it was then that i realised that my nokia cell was missing...told the security, searched everywhere, but to no avail. went back home (after giving mota's samaans to gopi and rajeev) and was feeling pathetic. Started seeing a movie on our multi-purpose comp! thought ki theek hai, movie dekh ke bhool jayenge and bingo...the comp got hot and with it went the plans of seeing the movie (run). was playing with the small ball - chotu (rubber one, bought in bbazaar) and asif threw it somewhere and it was lost somewhere in the house. then went to play cricket, and the tennis ball - motu - went into some hole and was lost in the most un-explainable manner. rolling on the ground and suddenly gayab! came back, had dinner (was sure that something wrong would happen in that also...for a change nothing happened)..food good but less. went to have some juice and saw a nasty accident. was coming back and chinki almost rammed into a truck...kitni baar samjhayen hain ki bade bhai se panga nahi lene ka, touch bhi kar diya to "happy b'day" ho jayega! lots of things had happened and i decided to call it a day. was lying down on the bed and banged my head on the wall..then i realised that something was surely wrong and i decided to just lie on the bed and read something. then exchanged a few sms and slept at 3. was reading a novel...dont remember the name though.  came to office and ravi asked me to talk to frontdesk and raj about the lost cell. was just about to send the mail when ashish gave back the cell (was in his drawer - jbommade fogot to tell me about that)...i was sure that i would get chotu and motu also if i search for that now! anyways, i would have expected them to feel a bit guilty for all this...i had approached the security people and they were searching the cell on their own. after all this, where does my credibility stand! i tell something is lost and find it the next day..the impression will be that i did not search properly. next time something happens, obviously less people would be believing. anyways, theek hai, jyada tension nahi lene ka. i guess, i was a bit senti on the cell...am not using it but cant think of losing it as well! while writing this, i remember the time when the burglar came in mallika, i first checked if my first salary notes are still there or not! when i found that they were very much there, i was not feeling bad, even though that duffer took my walkman!  baaki sab theek thaak...everybody has been calling me to find out if i am alright or not! kya chaat hai baap  sent that manager wala mail to bhaiya, didi and jiju and they seems to have enjoyed that! :-) was not sure about their reaction earlier though...  signing off...got to leave office for blore in half an hour...rest after that blore trip...

       my earlier post about a conversation with him would have brought forth my feelings about him. He comes to know that i am "upto something" because i sent a mail to "sharinginfo_hyd" asking about ECNR (for which, ofcourse i did not go to the passport office) stamping...that duffer does not know that you dont need an ECNR stamp for going to most of the countries!  anyways, he asks my TL, what is he upto and all. actually, he wants to recruit another guy and he has one in his hands it seems, but he cant do that because niether ashish, nor myself are leaving....as of now. then he says that, i will screw those guys...now what can i say for that! i join the office on say day 1, he comes back after 60 days to tell me what my team is all about, i ask for a team change after sometime, and then after wasting two years he has the audacity to tell me that he will screw me...i want to leave on a good note, but seems that these people wont let me do that. I dont know how i will react when he says something like this infront of me! i did not press for a team change thinking that i should not be acting like how kapil acted, i knew that i would leave sooner or later, and so i should not waste their time and energy in training me, but what do i get in return....THIS!!!! as i am writing this, i realise how they have played with my career and this can happen to anybody, if you are not proactive!  anyways, ek din ke liye bahut funda ho gaya!  ya...the subject has "meri fnnd" mentioned as well...swa was online and when the current went out (most probably) she had an excuse of calling me up...and while talking i felt that she was trying to get to know how i was feeling after that first day of april (seems first day always is so "special for me"...april and then many things happened on 1st June as well). At one point she asked, how many girls are there in the office and then how close i was to them...then she actually mentioned that she had to "pass" that info! i am sure she wanted to convey something to me..i felt like shouting at her at that very moment, but then i did not. I dont want to get into the same thing again...i remember now, i fought with her on 1st feb...and now that i am at it, i hugged HER on 1st Jan for the first time! swa has this habit of trying to act as a messenger and then trying to influence the way people feel. although she might have noble intentions, this is none of her business. if somebody wants to talk, come to me directly rather than thru somebody! i would rather be more comfortable in that...swa tries another time and she will have it from me...uff...zaalim zamana! aaraam se raho na bhai sabkoi...har jagah naak ghusana zaroori hai kya!

       had a nice and maybe useless discussion with chinki last night...  the "conversation" started when we tried to play cricket and found that almost none of the lights were ON and we had to go the terrace instead... there also, we were at peace and discussed things like when will people from our batch start marrying and how girls are made to adjust so much and all such things.  we both were sort of saying the same thing...but with "little" differences...he said they have to make such a huge adjustment, they are coming in the new family and all that shit...i said they are mentally prepared for that from a very young age and that with nuclear families in vogue these days, the adjustment is not all that much...if at all there is any, same has to be done by the guy as well...  then we talked about the difference between being literate and educated...how people in places like oracle also are doing things which being educated you should not be doing...if people like us are not putting in the 5 rupees token in the pantry...because the pantry guy is not looking at you - then there is little that you can expect from other people. the change in atitude has to come from within and if it has to start, then why not with us!  after that, somehow the bofors topic came in. chinki was of the opinion that the case should be snapped shut, since it has already been 20 years and if you prove somebody wrong/right now, what difference is it going to make. rather than spending money on that, we should be making investments for future...make sure that such type of people do not reach there and things like that. he was of the opinion that money was allocated for getting the guns, we got them, they are working, you got what you wanted, rajiv gandhi is dead..fine...get ahead and work for future rather than sulking about what might have happned in the past! i told him that if such a thing happened, there HAS to be some defect in the system or whatever it is, and if something is wrong, there HAS to be a solution for that, and this might be one of the reasons why you want the case to come to a logical conclusion. Just because the case did not end in the last 20 years and rajiv gandhi is dead, it does not mean that you close the case. i am not in a position to decide what was wrong and what can be done to rectify that...there are people qualified to do that thing...this can be one of the reason. Moreover, if it is closed now, then what stops a guy from assuming today that whatever i do, nothing is going to happen to me...eventually the case will be closed for the sake of looking towards future. it is unfortunate that something like this was so much influenced by politicians, so unfortunate but that does not mean that you close the case. If you convict some X number of people then that sets and example for the others to follow (this can be another reason why the case should be followed). ultimately you have to bring accountability in the system and for that a start has to be made and if a start has to be made, why not from here. what chinki suggests might make sense, but then you can never take extreme cases and then work for that...a middle path has to be taken...i was suggesting to go from top..chinki was suggesting to start from bottom...what i realised later was that both were complimentary...it has to be a parallel process. you cant take the extremes. although bofors is just a symbol, it represents that you are trying to bring in accountability and it sends out the corresponding message to the masses. like chinki himself said at one stage, he wanted to make 7 into 8, i wanted to make 3 into 2(if there is 3 parts corruption in the system out of 10)...as is evident, both are complimentary! as far as bofors guns working is concerned, they were SUPPOSED to work, if you spend some crores of tax-payers money on that, then you cant boast about the fact that they are working...damnit, they are supposed to work, thats why we spent that much money on them!  while talking with chinki, i realised at one point that we both were actually trying to prove the other guy wrong and so were repeating our points over and over again! i have had this feeling while talking to mota as well...both of them are so passionate about their view points (often based on very little facts - i feel) that i feel like opposing them, whatever is the case, and so sometimes, i start arguing just for the sake of arguement. but this time, i believed in what i was saying!  there were a few times when we thought that the "conversation" could come to an end (and let the people sleep - we were literally shouting!), but then it used to pickup again :-) what i felt in the end was - is there any hope - realistically speaking. i mean, as of today, who is going into crucial fields like politics (who would be governing the country), teaching (for the so called future of India)...mostly those people who dont have anything to do and failed in other fields. Ofcourse there are exceptions but we have to look at the majority. I also admit that myself as an individual  is not doing anything and it is so easy to sit on a terrace and lecture about it...but who is doing anything! i dont see anything happening...in such a scenario, what is to be expected! i dunno!

       ya...feels nice to think that i did not forget about this blog after starting yesterday! well...went to eat pani-puri last evening and then was chatting till 1 in the office and then till 3 with arora we decided that we should go a bit early to the office...11:30 was getting a bit too late..you have to go for lunch before you start the day's work - not that it is any different today, when i managed to enter office at 11! but we can take solace in the fact that we slept real late and then also manager to "improve" by half and hour! chinki saw yuva last night and we were talking about how vivek oberoi and kareena had ruined the movie...ofcourse i did not think so, but then chinki always has his ideas and zillions of arguements to support that! then we discussed why investing in a house in ameerpet (7.5 l for 2 bhk acc to chinki) will not return much but then the same thing in kondapur will! again, as usual chinki had lots of things to say for this as well. he bought 700 shares of andhra bank at 42.10 per share and he was explaining us why he did so! its nice to fight over non-issues! i remember bhaiya's comments for these things..."movie ko movie ke tarah hi dekho...jyada dimaag nahi lagane ka!"  i got to office today at around 11 and have worked hardly till now...got to start work...  people getting senti over what they did yesterday and what i think are petty issues(do i want to say non-issues???)...but you got to respect people's opinions (do i have an option here?!!), you cant change the way other people think...! but then if you want to tell everything that you are doing to your 'well-wishers', then there will definitely be problems. a strange gap developes sometimes between people and its not so easy to overcome that by means of explainations or anything else! being so independent and living separately, you are bound to do things which you will find difficult to explain to other people... thats why...jyada load nahi lene ka! but then, this is the way i think and i cant make other people to think this way...can i???

       well...i had created my first blog in rediff, arora told me that rediff had this blog facilty and as it is I have become used to feeding on the data given to me rather than searching for another place, i created it there. but there were lots of probs in rediff (koi bhi kaam theek se nahi karte hain yeh log), i could not see my changes and so i started looking for another place .. arora had told me that there were lots of sites offering this and so i knew that some other sites should also be offering these.. then i went to sidin's blog URL and got this ...BLOGSPOT.com..dont know how many people know about this...advertisement plays a good role in your success...jangal mein mor nacha, kisne dekha!  well....here i am, copied everything to this from rediff, not sure if i would be able to add the counter in this site or not! that was one reason why i left rediff and came here!

       wow!!!!!!!!!  i have already started thinking about the size that blogspot people have assigned for this blog thing. its my first day and this is already my third post!!  well, i HAVE to admit that i cant understand a certain species within homo sapiens...most of the time, they are called - girls!  there is/was one person, with whom i thought i could spend my remaining life...and then she says that i was not the ONE which her oracle had predicted! i could not make out any more sense out of what she said that day, but in the end i thought everybody had a right to his or her opinions and then they should be respected (as if I had any other option!!)...but in the end i realised that this is also good for me in a way...due to this ONE relationship, numerous other relationships were getting affected and thanks to her, now i can get back to normal in those cases. and i am already feeling better...i talk more regularly with my friend...i am not looking at eternity these days, i am not planning my life for the next 30 years, 10 times a day now and many other things like that.  I dont know whether I want her to read these blogs or not...i really dont know. I think that is one of the reasons why i have started blogging! Whatever happens will happen for the good...  hey...i have already started rambling...i can see the scroll-bar getting smaller and smaller! but i have to complete what i wanted to say. After April 1, i thought that maybe we would be in less contact from now on.. but then she has just got back from her home to her college place and has started giving me missed calls...i dont know what she means by that...should i call back or was that only to tell me that she was back! i dont know and in the confusion, i already gave her a missed call...she is silent now...in a way i am happy that i would be out of all this soon, GOD..I WANT THE VISA!

       well well...now that i have posted my FIRST BLOG, I feel so dash! but i have to admit that there were a lot of spelling mistakes in the earlier post...but then i dont think anybody has ever spell checked his diary entries ever :-)  well, today one of my friends mailed me asking what happened to dhiru. i replied to him, saying there were three phases...first phase: bandi ready, banda not ready, second: vice-versa, third: bandi wants to come back...and complete the circle.  while writing that i realised that i am starting to get immune to all these things. i mean, i sometimes feel as if i have started to value certain relationships less as compared to what i did some 4 months back (to be precise, exactly two months back!). Is it because of what happened on April 1...?? I would surely like to know a definite answer to that but whatever it is, i think it surely helps me. I dont believe in living in an imaginary world and certain relationships were surely imaginary.  Ultimately everything comes down to my single philosophy in life: "Jo hota hai achche ke liye hota hai!!" whether i get a favourable decision on June 16 or not, and there are so many other things like this...whatever will happen, will happen for the good!

       hi (to myself!) this is my first post on this site...as of now, i am not very sure about how it should be. somebody told me that a blog is something where you can write whatever you want...so here i am...am starting to write here, assuming this was my diary (although i would not like anybody to read my diary, i dont know why i have made this public!)  well, the idea to start my blog came while reading the blogs of one of my seniors, Sidin. He was my senior in REC trichy. Its not as if i am trying to compete with him in this, but still, one can start anywhere :-)  today, i have completed my office work and am trying to do some thing useful. Am actually preparing for my visa interview (june 16) and i think i should be a bit tensed about that (atleast thats what i am telling everybody) but then have i ever done anything before the 11th hour!! Hey...wait a minute, i got reco letter from my manager. chalo kuch to kiya!  In office here, everybody has an idea about what i am upto...and everybody tried to wriggle out some information as to what are my plans and all. today, during lunch, one guy came up and asked "what happened to your gate score?"... could only say - GATE?????? well, i told him the truth - partly! i cant lie so bluntly :-D

       as far as what i did in blore, i will copy and paste from one of the mails which i sent to the core group, bahut baar repeat ho gaya same cheez ;-) ************************************************  GM all... back to hyd now :-) came at 8 in the morning... mera weekend kuch aisa raha...sat ko subah blore pahuche. didi boli ki shopping karne chalte hain. khana (khichdi, chokha and tamatar ki chatni - yum yum!!) ke baad ek shopping mall mein raid maarne ghus gaye :-D - "the forum" was the shopping mall. kaafi der ke baad nikle wahan se, and then we went to see bhaiya ka jameen....sarjapur road mein hai...near madiwala... uske baad frnd log se milne ka plan tha...lekin baarish ke karan ja nahi sake. sunday subah ko mile...and then mera treat due the...wapas indranagar chale gaye frnd ke ghar. shaam mein 7 baje ki bus thi...5 baje koi to bola ki kahan jaoge...ek din chutti maar do...hum bhi soche ki kahan jayenge and ek din chutti maarne ka decide kar liye :-D phir shaam mein ek aur bande ka treat tha....ghar mein khana mangaya gaya and chuki barish ho rahi thi...to ghar bhi nahi ja sake...raat bhar gap shap hua. subah 6 baje didi ke ghar gaye. bhaiya ka ek bag se samaan nikalna tha apne liye...wo sab kiye, MG road chale gaye din mein TP ke liye...and shaam mein didi ko senti hoke bye bye bole and back to hyd. bus mein mast hoke soye ekdum....hyd mein ek banda uthaya mere ko...as usual :-)  this was my weekend...a long weekend :-)  ************************************************  hmm...this was the mail. other than this, there is nothing much to add on. while saying bye bye to didi, i was actually getting senti...i think getting "goose bumps" is the word used for this :-(  i was feeling very strange, as such when she was in jsr, we used to meet at an interval of 1 year only and i would be coming back next dec, but still this feeling comes in. i dont know how i will feel so many people at the same time...as in when i would be leaving hyd/ranchi/bby :-( anyways, all good things have to come to an end so that better things can start...this was what i reasoned out in the auto when coming to the majestic stand and then the tension about whether i would reach majestic before 8:15 or not overpowered all other feelings ;-)  didi gave me half a grand (USD)...i wanted to pay her back but then she said that kamane lagoge tab de dena! abhi to jitna tumhara hai, utna hi rahega na, there wont be any addition till you start earning, so keep it now, you might have any emergency and all and there should be money for that. keep it now, and pay back later :-) jiju was also stressing the fact that in case of any help, feel free to ask...

       quite a punctual update to the blog - i must say....updated it yesterday and i am back here again today :-)  Went back from office at around 8, had an almost stomachful dinner..left just enough for deepti and told arora to have his dinner and come. Started burning CDs on Asif's comp and after burning one CD, it started malfunctioning...ek CD barbaad ho gaya and then went to Sukku's place to burn the remaning 5 CDs. went to shruti's place to give her the CDs for her frnd and then we went on a long bike ride..gachibowli - lingampalli - mehdipatnam - madhapur! had a nice time, feels nice to drive at that time of the night on such wonderful roads :-)  came back to home at aound 3:30 and arora and ashwini came from somewhere just after me. was doing tp with shruti after the long ride :-)  going to blore today...this will be a hectic weekend...ritesh wants to get a "few" CDs but am busy in the office and would not be able to go home to collect the CDs. so many failures in FND.H and then framework checkin and family pack is still left. got to leave office at 4:45 also :-(  ravi keeps asking why i am so particular about my work, even after i have resigned...i believe that if I am working for oracle, then there should not be any difference in the quality of work before and after i resigned.   lots of politics going on in the team these days. ashish has some prob with his work and does not want to do certain tasks...Ken is very particular that he will HAVE to do those...lots of complications coming up. i guess, because of these only he got an A grade and had i stayed here in the same team, me getting A+, Ashish getting A and jaya getting B would surely have created tensions!!!! baba re! I asked ravi today and he says that the grades were given by ken and not ravi. feels good to know that Ken thinks of me like that :-)  FND.H over.....hurrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i guess, had my plans of leaving oracle not materialized, i would also have been frust with the work here, but letting it out the Ashish way - i dont think i would have done that. but then maybe, i would have been in some other company itself...honeywell ka to interview dete tab pata chalta, but now that i did not go for that, i can think that it was a gud option - eee graduate with database ideas...ha ha ha! then the TI option was also there....theek hai, jo hota hai, achcha hi hota hai :-D

       well, i am back after a long long time...many things have happened in between...of very grave implications - greece have won the euro 2004!! ;-)  anyways,am enjoying my life to the hilt these days, come at your own time to the office, kaam karo and then back. ghar mein bhi masti hi chalti hi rehti hai. but everytime there is a feeling that so much prep needs to be done and i am not doing anything...postponing everything for the future!  got to return the amex, era and uhc cards to lakshmipathi itha now.  saw the movie 'thoda tum badlo thoda hum' one day...we actually came down to the parking lot in the intermission and were about to leave when jyoti felt that there was a certain 'twist' in the movie and that we should check it out. i was ever-ready and so shruti and asif followed us back to the movie...jaani dushman ko takkar de degi yeh movie!
