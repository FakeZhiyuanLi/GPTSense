         Lemon.      They've clipped my wings again tore them apart and then left me no use to fly away to my yesterday of freedom my eyes died back that day seeing the hurt I may have done beat my instead of them pain is my only zen of fun.      I'll go where secrets are sold    Where roses unfold    I'll sleep as time goes by      So hurting here is where I belong singing a sond blood on my hands to stay strong the flowers in the graveyard are all gone I don't belong there is no right to heal the wrong soup's on hot feelin' like a do or die I can't throw up don't think i even want to try      You still can't make me cry you've pinned this butterfly down my fire's burning out kill my flame without  a frown and starving hurts the soul when you're hungry for some love so if I close my eyes I can really fly above.      I'll go where secrets are sold    Where roses unfold    I'll sleep as time goes by      So hurting here is where I belong dreaming a song blood on my hands to stay strong the flowers in the graveyard are all gone I don't belong there is no right to heal the wronge soup's on hot feelin' like a do or die I can't throw up don't think I even want to try.
