      So a few Saturday nights ago, this chick had a going away party.  Per her going away request, there was a chocolate pudding wrestling pit in the back yard.  I mean for real there was, I really can’t make shit like that up.  Anyway, a few chicks wrestled and threw each other around, then after they were all good and chocolaty, got naked.  There was a LOT of alcohol for consuming and it was a generally good time all around.     urlLink    The Puddin' Pitt   urlLink    Heavy consumption of liquor and pudding, I don't think anything else mixes quite as well    urlLink    Soon after this a few more girls joined the fray, then they all started taking their clothes off.  And sure they were all lesbians, most of which could pass for guys, but it was still a knee-slapping laugh-happy time

      Living in Atlanta can be tough, one minute you are alone in your car driving to work, the next minute BAM you are surrounding by pissed off blood thirsty ninjas.  Why is Atlanta such an attractive place for ninjas to hang out?  I have no idea, and that’s why I decided to investigate the matter.  Below are some of the pictures I took when I infiltrated one of the local ninja clan’s secret training facilities.  It was really dangerous for me to even be there, I had to steal an entire ninja outfit so I wasn’t discovered, and I’m lucky to even come away with the small amount of photos that I captured.  You’ll notice how quick these ninjas are, my slow camera could barely capture their lightning quick movements.  After I witnessed one of the smaller ninjas kill the pizza delivery guy I decided it was time to leave; I’ll let someone else uncover why they like Atlanta so much.   urlLink    I need to learn how to change my shutter speed so action shots aren't so blury.   urlLink    Iron Hammer Monkey Fist!!   urlLink    The headless ninja is a deadly force   urlLink    Super Meca Head Smash!!   urlLink    Lou Cheng shows off his power move, which is usually only used to get women into bed, however, when there is a crowd Lou just likes to get on top of anybody close by   urlLink    Many on-lookers gather as Ken gets in to position to have Lee Zheng thrust his fist into somewhere I'd rather not think about

      I decided to walk aimlessly around one  day  evening, camera in hand, and these are a few of the pictures that I took. These were taken in the downtown Atlanta area. It was a nice day, not too hot by the time I was on the streets. Although I’ve had my camera for a while now, I can’t help but feel oddly like a tourist when randomly taking pictures of buildings and other things I’ve seen 100 times. But then again, it’s not like I live in Stickville; Atlanta does have a healthy population and I’m sure tourists are fairly popular so I don’t think I looked that much out of place.   urlLink    This fence looked like it wanted its picture taken   urlLink    Building in downtown Atlanta   urlLink    Close Up   urlLink    Music, Dance, Theater, Film and Lucky Street   urlLink    There were soooo many people at Olympic Park when I took this shot, only two of which are pictured here.   urlLink    Do you think having a car on the side of your buliding draws more of a crowd?
