       	well today we all went to the Opry Mills mall in Nashville.  it was a very nice mall.  pretty big.  lots of stores.  i didnt get to go to all the ones i wanted to but thats ok...there were 6 other people with me so we couldnt really go everywhere we wanted.  i got a frozen cafe mocha from ghiradelli's chocolate shop!  OH MAN IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD!  OH DANG!  i did stop at Sketcher's and picked up 2 pairs of shoes.  just cuz i was bored.  hahahaha!  my legs hurt real bad cuz of all the walkin.  well actually its more cuz of the standing.  the walkin made it feel better.  anyways.  feelings again have not changed much.  it's gettin easier to hide them.  but not much has changed.  i dunno...they arent bad feelings.  just natural i guess...to miss someone.  i cant say im depressed about it.  cuz im really not.  ya just miss it....yanno?  yeah.  Alias is on in a bit.  mom and i will be watchin it as we usually do.  i love my mom.  i should tell her i do more often.  i really do though.  she's one of the few people who understand me.  well at least a little.  anyways. kris is gettin a bit emotional now.  must go.  au revoir.

       	i dunno what to talk about today.  we went out for some of it.  not a good idea.  EVERYONE IN HUNTSVILLE WAS OUT!  it was absolutely crazy.  i must say i've been feeling a lot better than i did a week ago.  i still miss Mal though.  i try not to think about it.  i dunno what it is.  she is one of the sweetest people on this planet...when she wants to be.  oh man...there are no words to describe how much i miss her.  i cant help it.  i mean im not depressed about it anymore.  but i guess you cant help but miss someone you love.  course i still miss Kari.  but gosh i miss Mal hugging me.  or just tellin me she loved me.  and i miss her lookin at me the way she used to.  there is nothin that can replace that.  unfortunately.  its a strange feeling im having.  like i feel so calm and relaxed cuz i know that God is there.  i know he's watchin me.  but at the same time i miss people.  i miss someone who loves me.  i dunno.  i guess i like to be able to feel a person...or hear their voice.  i dunno..guess im weird like that.  i didnt watch Nemo today.  rather sad.  didnt have time.  but thats ok.  6 days in a row...i can skip a day or 2 here and there.  hahaha!  im feeling rather lonely right now.  Marbles has abandoned me for my brother.  gosh!  after all the attention i give her this is what i get?!  my brother hardly even notices her!  its not fair!  aww well!  she's just a player cat!  well gonna go to bed.  goodnight.

       	the girl found out last night.  that both us guys liked her.  yeah it was very confusing.  basically we both found out that she didnt like either of us.  so yeah.  im not hurt i dont think.  i have to say i really didnt expect for her to ever consider me.  but i had hoped she would have at least given the other guy a chance.  he's a really good guy and he's been kinda lonely.  i dunno.  i guess i felt bad for likin the same girl he did.  cuz i've had 2 great gf's...yeah they both hurt me but they were still wonderful...and he..he never reallly did.  well once that i know of.  i dunno.  i guess i felt he deserved someone like her more than i did.  its ok with me.  im not really hurt.  im just kinda sorry for her.  she's not exactly havin the easiest time.  i know exactly how she feels.  i know how hard it is for her right now.  ok i probably jsut confused everyone there.  ha!  dont worry about it.  yeah.  well life goes on.  so...yeah.  dunno what to do now.  im bored out of my mind.  blah!  i think i shall go and try to find somethin to do.  instead of sitting in front of this computer screen.  adios.

       	well its thanksgiving.  we just got done eating.  Beke and Claire are here from England.  we're havin a great time.  im gonna watch Nemo later tonight i think.  of course!  hahaha!  i like this girl.  someone else likes her too.  we both know that we both like her.  its confusing.  i actually think its funny.  its not awkward or anything.  which is awesome.  cuz i hate it when people are all awkward around eachother.  i dunno though.  i personally doubt she'd like either of us.  but ya never know.  im actually more skeptical about me.  i dont think she'd ever like me.  im more of a friend to her.  and thats probably all ill ever be.  i seem to stuck with that alot.  there have been plenty of girls that i've liked but that wouldnt go out with me...or even consider me cuz i was just a friend.  i guess it can be frustrating.  but then again...i can always be there for them as a friend.  ha!  there's this one girl who i've really liked for a long time.  she'd never give me a chance.  i even asked her out twice.  well sorta...the second time was kinda indirectly.  but still!  she's like someone i'd wish would give me a chance but she just wont.  she likes other guys and im just a friend.  which doesnt really bother me that much.  i mean i guess its sorta better bein her friend.  i've always been there for her just like she's always been there for me.  so i guess it worked out the way God wanted it to.  anyways.  slightly complicated.  but yeah i like this new girl.  she's very nice.  of course so does he.  i feel guilty.  like i do like her but i feel maybe he deserves her more.  i dunno.  im trying to decide if im even going to attempt anything.  i dunno.  AHHHHHHH!  SO CONFUSING!  ok well im going to go have dessert!  oh yeah!  adios amigos!

       	i dunno what to write about?  i honestly dont.  i feel better.  i feel comforted.  but im still sad.  i guess i dont really have to feel better yet.  im still hurt but at least i can find comfort in God.  it will be ok.  i still need time to hide my feelings...but i will be ok.  God will make it ok.  thats where my comfort will always come from.  i've learned that the hard way.  twice.  ha!  i took me 2 times to get it.  but i did.  after all of that i realized that God is the only thing that will ever truely remain constant.  the ony one who will never turn their back on me.   and when the rest of the world does he will always be there with his hand streched out to help me.  that is one of the greatest feelings ever.  i still have to get used to it though.  its so hard not to depend on a person.  i still miss her.  even though i do feel better.  i guess thats ok.  i mean i do love her and i dont really want it to be this way...but i know its what God intends.  so why try and stop it.  i will survive.  i will be ok.  life will go on.  and God will guid me and give me the strength to keep breathing...no matter how cruel the world becomes...

       	well its rather late.  11:03 to be exact.  i dont wanna go to bed.  i cant sleep.  lots of emotions today.  happy but still sad.  lots of people made me laugh today.  and i played the piano.  my piano teacher is so cool.  she's so hilarious.  omgosh she just makes you laugh so hard.  i have so much fun practicing there!  yes and "she" is so funny!  ahhhhh!  i was laughin so hard!  "she" is sucha goober!  hahahaha!  still sad.  still depressed.  L was really gettin on my case today.  ha!  i love her...she is just so honest.  and she'll just get up in your face and tell you the truth.  which quite frankly i do need to hear sometimes.  i dunno.  she just kinda said that i really had an issue with letting people go and that i really needed to fix it.  i dunno it kinda made me mad.  she's right i need to try and let go.  but its so hard for me.  cuz its never like i lose the feeling.  its never like im the one who's leaving.  its always them.  and im always the one left with feelings.  i wish i knew what it was like to lose the feeling.  L said it was much easier to let go when you're on that side of the break up.  anyways.  ok im in alot of pain.  my chest...is killing me.  i dont even know how to describe it.  im havin a very difficult a conversation.  im going to leave now.  goodnight.

       	i know you believe that i am not alone.  and maybe im not.  but i still have not met anyone like me.  never.  i know one person who can understand the pain that i feel everyday.  and even she doesnt understand it completely.  can you imagine a massive boulder crushing your chest all day?  not bein able to breath?  not having any relief from it?  it never goes away.  and now imagine living your whole life that way.  every waking moment in pain.  every laugh...every smile...every expression hiding that pain.  that's what everyday is like.  dont try to tell me you understand.  you dont.  and no im not trying to be harsh.  im telling truth.  you cant understand the feeling.  just one day being able to be happy.  do you remember the first time you felt happiness?  i do.  the first time i smiled without that pain.  there are no words to describe that feeling.  nor the emotions.  tears from being so happy.  tears from being free.  it was like i'd been missing out on life for so long.  and finally i could feel what people feel all the time without even noticing it.  and do you know how i discovered this feeling?  how i could be free from all that pain?  she cared.  she listened.  she talked to me.  and maybe for a short time she loved me.  and then i lost that all.  in an instant i lost the shield that hid me from the pain.  and in an instant all of  it was back.  and this time it was so much worse.  i was like a knife had been stabbed through my chest.  and when i talk about this pain i dont mean it figuratively.  thats really what it felt like.  but after her it just all fell apart.  all that control i had over this pain.  it was all gone and that pain attacked so hard.  no mercy at all.  and i fell.  i sunk so low.  and i know you know how low i got.  and thats when someone else showed up.  and she too cared.  and believe it or not she lifted me.  she showed me that it would be ok.  and then even she left.  thats when i realized...only about a few days ago that i cannot rely on people to help me.  as much as i love people they cannot give to me what i can give to them.  people will reject me.  people will hurt me and i cannot control that.  even the people that i love will hurt me...which i've learned the hard way.  i rely on God to ease the pain.  so far he hasnt which must mean that i am meant to bear this.  im not mad because i have to.  only upset.  only because it hurts so bad.  and it wears away at me.  its like having to drag around somethin.  somethin heavy.  but if i must then will bear it.  as i said once...i know that bearing this pain and not giving up takes pain away from people i love.  all those people who would have to bear a pain of sadness if i were to give up in life.  i guess that helps me go through each day.  knowing that by living i am protecting the people i love from a pain.  even if the people i love cause some of my pain.  i dunno...i guess thats just that side of me that thinks that i owe God somethin.  like i feel so guilty that i almost took my life and wasted Jesus's gift.  anyways...this getting waay to personal.  i need to go.    to Drew:  i tried talkin to the only person that could really help me.  she showed me no sympathy or pity and gave me no comfort.  i know you mean well but there are very few people who have ever been able to make me feel better.  thank you though for caring enough about me.  i will be ok.  i will live...

       	who cares?  bout any of this...who gives a crap bout me or the way i feel?  i've decided to clam up.  i cant solve this problem.  no one seems to care enough to help.  its ok though.  im not mad at anyone.  im just going to pretend like everything is ok.  and maybe someday God will make it all ok.  maybe by saying this some people will know the truth.  that i am not happy.  and that what you see is an elaborate act.  and that i still am crying.  quietly behind my wall.  God give me the strength to breathe...through all of my tears...

       	today hasnt been to great either.  erik got yelled at and mom and dad got upset and were yellin at him and it was not fun at all.  it stresses me out when they yell.  i hate it so much.  i was crying.  they didnt see me i dont think but i was.  i just wanted them to stop.  it was like too much goin on.  all this stuff in my life and then all that on top of it just made me burst.  i dunno.  im not ashamed that i cry but i wish i didnt have to.  i wish that i wouldnt.  im so tired of everything.  im tired of bein hurt and tired of crying and tired of...EVERYTHING!  i want comfort so bad.  i want to talk to someone who wont be afraid to listen.  where is L when you need her?!  ha!  i should talk to her.  i havent in a long time.  she usually helps.  im so messed up with talkin to people.  like the people that i always get the most comfortable talkin to are like my gf's and i tell them everything. and then they break up with me and its not comfortable to talk to them anymore.  and then i have no one to talk to.  except L...i've always been able to talk to her.  she's never done anything mean to me...she's never hurt my feelings...she's never hurt me at all.  ok well i g2g!  church time!  bye!

       	well its like 10 or so.  im watchin Finding Nemo.  i love this movie.  they're stuck inside the whale right now.  gosh this movie makes me feel so good.  its so silly.  a kids movie!  i love it!  its bittersweet though.  it reminds me of Mal.  good memories.  but it hurts that there will be no more memories made with her.  i miss it.  sigh.   	anyways.  dunno bout this other girl.  dunno if i wanna have feelings for her.  my feelings are still so strong for Mal...and even some for Kari.  i dunno.  just blah.  my feelings are all so screwed at the moment.  i need more time to sort them all out.  and figure out how to handle all of them.  ok.  dont feel like writin much anymore.  i spent all day workin on my chemistry project and im very moody right now.  so yeah...

       	ok well here i am.  its like 10:26.  i just got back from Cow's party.  i had a good time.  just bein able to laugh was great.  i have to say there were times when i was really just quiet.  i kept on remembering Mal.  specially when we watched part of Nemo.  only part cuz SOME people wouldnt stop bein loud!  but yeah.  i was a bit sad at the time but i still had a good time.  and then...ok yeah wait not gonna say that.  it would be too obvious.  anyways!  im tired.  exhausted.  im still not sure bout this girl.  i dunno if i really like her.  guess im just interested.  dont really think she is though.  kinda disappointing.  i mean maybe she'd give me a chance.  time will tell.  not quite yet though.  im not ready for anything right now.  the wound is still fresh.  it will never close but at least maybe ill get used to the pain that ill be able to be back to normal again.  or at least as close to normal as i can get.  well im goin to bed.  night...

       	blah!  today wasnt cool.  im still hurting from Mal.  very badly.  its almost like i dont believe it happened.  like it was so good and so real and then in like a couple of days it just fell apart.  and its so unbelieveable that it could be lost like that.  and she really wasnt upset about it or anything.  like i meant nothin.  it was just like "sorry its over".  i almost feel like i was used.  except i dont want to believe that she would do that to me.  so yeah.  i miss her very badly.  i really miss how nice and sweet she used to be to me.  and i miss talkin to her.   	i have to admit though.  there is someone else who's caught my eye.  she's really funny.  oh my goodness she makes me laugh!  which is like great right now!  im not startin anything though.  its too soon.  i dont want to do anything stupid.  the only problem is that i dont think she'd ever think of me like that.  its like i've known her along time and i think im just a friend to her.  its very frustrating.  i dont think she'd ever give me a chance.   	ha!  someone told me that other day that i was a really sweet guy!  and that i was one of those hard to find kinda guys!  lol!  that made me feel better for awhile when i heard that.  then i just thought really?  it doesnt seem that anyone else thinks so.  or maybe no one else really cares.  it wasnt enough for Kari or Mal.  i mean  gave them both all of my heart.  i doesnt seem to help.  i doesnt seem to be enough.  what more can i give?   	oh im goin to Cow's party tonight!  so i wont be writing tonight.  anyways...

       	today wasnt any better than this whole week has been.  i looked at her today and i could just feel all that pain just rush over me.  all the regrets and the good memories.  she is so beautiful.  and she is such a great person.  i just looked at her today and i was just so upset at what i lost.  it was like she was so perfect.  i just felt like i didnt deserve her.  i actually i was felt like that.  i felt like i wasnt good enough for someone like her.  i know i wasnt good enough for her.  i mean come on...someone like me...a weak pathetic little boy who cant even control his own pain...me with this wonderful beautiful girl.  i dunno.  it felt so special when it all started.  it made me feel so good that she wanted to be with me.  somebody as good as her wanted me.  it made me feel like so special.  so blessed.   	i love people just noticing me.  like the other night when i came to church.  L just comes out and says "hey kristopher" right when she saw me.  she probably doesnt know how good that made me feel.  just the fact that she was happy to see me.  or when ashley made a little hand stiched thingy!  that made me feel good that she did that for me.  yanno i like it when somebody notices me without me havin to try to be noticed.  like when someone just says hi and just starts talkin to me cuz THEY wanted to.  they thought about me and thought i was important enough to talk to.  makes me feel wanted.  its a great feeling.

       	i give up.  i have no hope left.  that feeling is gone.  Mal's feelings for me are lost.  i realized today that it was gone.  that sweet girl that i fell in love with.  she wasnt there anymore.  that tenderness was no where to be found.  the understanding was gone.  the assurance and the comfort from her was gone.  and that look she would give me was gone.  her love for me was lost.  and now i have deal with the pain and the hopelessness.  the cruel reality.  i have to live with a love that will not be returned.  a love without hope...

       	i dont like discussion questions in chemistry.  they are so stupid.  im feeling very sad today.  i miss Mal terribly.  yanno what the really sad thing is though?  i dont think she really misses me.  as Ashley put it "she did what she had to do".  i dont understand why she HAD to do this.  she told me that it wasnt my fault.  but im the one who has to feel hurt.  funny isnt it?  the innocent ones suffer for the decisions of others.  but like i said i dont think she misses it.  she seemed just as happy and fine today as she usually is.  she didnt say a word to me.  i felt terrible...i felt totally ignored.  i just want it to be like it was.  it was just starting to get good.  i was really happy.  and then just out of the blue she loses the feeling.  i dont understand how it was lost.  maybe thas a good thing..i dunno.  i still love them.  yeah both of them.  i hid my love for kari.  that was the only way i could get over it.  well actually it was more just moving on.  but i still love her.  she was a great person.  and now i have to try and hide Mal.  cuz i cant stop.  i cant lose it.  you cannont lose love.  if you do then you never loved in the first place.  sometimes i wish i could fall out of love.  it would make alot of the pain go away.  but then i guess my love wouldnt be as true.  actually i dont believe in falling out of love.  i dont thinks its possible.  cuz if you really love then it will never die and you can never fall out of it.  i guess thats why im screwed...all these teen relationships where people think they're in love..but it ends up not bein real.  i cant be like that.  i cant help falling in love.  and everytime its for real.  and i dont lose it.  it doesnt go away.  all i can do is hide it.  burrying it deep in my heart.  do you know how much i envy married couples?  i want that so bad.  i want someone to be devoted to me.  i want someone who will not leave me cold and alone.  and i wnat someone to love me in return just as much as i love them.  yeah im willing to wait.  im willing to wait all my life if i have to.  but im sick of bein hurt by people.  because im not like other people.  other people can just leave, break up, be hurt, and whatever and they can go on in life just fine.  i cant.  it doesnt go away.  i always remember it.  and it always hurts.  how long has it been since kari?  i still hurt from that.  it will never go away.  people around me dont understand that.  and i dont blame them.  but they affect me so much.  its why i hate people bein mean to others.  cuz i know that there are other people out there like me.  people who are affected so much by cruelty.  its not like we just get over it.  it sticks with us.  some of us its there forever.  its why i try so hard not to be cruel to anyone.  cuz i dunno how much that will affect them.  one little thing i do to someone could be stuck with them forever.  i know cuz im that way.  and i still have that pain.  even my best friends have done it to me.  most people dont even know they do it.  im not one of those people who just tells ya when you hurt me.  i keep it locked inside.  im too afraid to tell people.  i hate people not bein happy with me.  its funny that even with all the pain that people cause me i still love them.  i love people.  so much.  i dunno why.  i love to help people.  its what i want to do with my life.  i want to grow up and help teens like me.  teens that think that there is no one in this world who understands them.  or that think they are alone.  i dont want them to be alone.  i want them to know that they are not alone and that their is at least some person on this world that understands.  or that can understand.  i want to give them what i didnt have when i needed it.  i want to give them what i dont have still.  i want them to have someone who they can talk to and who will care.  my gosh i'm already loving people that probably arent even born yet.  ha!  i dont care though.  i know what i want to do with my life.  well i dunno if i feel any better...but oh well!  at least i said it.  yeah i still feel pretty bad.  im so tired.  physically, emotionally, mentally...i want comfort...i need comfort...  oh and here's a great song...Ashley reminded me of it with what she said...she did what she had to do...  Do What You Have To Do by Sarah McLachlan  what ravages of spirit conjured this temptuous rage created you a monster broken by the rules of love and fate has lead you through it you do what you have to do and fate has led you through it you do what you have to do ...  and I have the sense to recognize that I don't know how to let you go every moment marked with apparitions of your soul I'm ever swiftly moving trying to escape this desire the yearning to be near you I do what I have to do the yearning to be near you I do what I have to do but I have the sense to recognize  that I don't know how to let you go I don't know how to let you go  a glowing ember burning hot burning slow deep within I'm shaken by the violence of existing for only you  I know I can't be with you I do what I have to do I know I can't be with you I do what I have to do and I have sense to recognize but I don't know how to let you go I don't know how to let you go I don't know how to let you go

       	well i guess it hit me today.  i miss her.  terriblly.  it hurts.  i mean i never was dependent on her to be happy.  i can be happy without her.  and i guess in a way i am still happy.  its more content i guess.  but its like i want her because of who she is.  because i love her.  not because im dependent on her.  not cuz i need her to make my pain go away.  God does that for me.  its a genuine feeling.  i love her and thats why i want to be with her.  i guess i couldnt complain.  maybe at least for a little while i could feel what is was like to be loved in return.  cuz i know she loved me.  even if she lost the feeling.  at i could feel it for a little bit.  and lemme tell ya it was great.  it was a wonderful feeling.  gosh i love her so much.

       	well nothin's really changed.  im still upset.  its such a weird feeling.  its like im sad and upset and i wish that it could be different.  i wish she didnt have to go.  i wish we could be happy together.  but i know that ill be ok.  even though i am not happy with what has happend.  i already miss it so much.  i dunno if my faith has been strengthened at all.  im just...emotionless.  i have none left.  i have nothing left to give.  no more tears.  no more cries.  no more pleads.  i am so tired.  so tired of this world.  im so tired of getting what i want and then having it taken from me.  but i guess i at least still have my soul...i still have my Lord.  and i know that no matter what people do to me...no matter how they hurt me he will still be there....unwavering...and that gives me comfort. and the fact that in heaven i wont have to  cry and more tears...

       	and so it's happened again.  i've lost what i love.  and i dont know how to feel.  i am so depressed and upset.  i've been crying none stop since last night.  but oddly im not as hurt.  maybe its cuz i have some hope that its not over forever.  maybe God will give me a second chance.  oh but how i am going to miss it.  it had barely even started and now its over.  and i feel as if all the love i gave was wasted again.  i mean i give all of my heart and i always think that they love me in return.  but then they "just dont feel the same way anymore".  and i dont blame them.  they are only human.  but it hurts.  even though its somewhat easier this time it still hurts.  it feels like i've been lied to again.  but i dont want to believe that any of them did that on purpose.  cuz i know they didnt.  but the pain is easier this time.  i spent all night praying and crying.  and now i know that my God can give me the relief from the pain that i have endured all my life.  and that gives me hope to live one more day.  and each day.  and someday he will give me rest...

       	well its bout 8:23...im listening to the new Sarah McLachlan album...its pretty good.  i dunno guess its nice to hear such a beautiful voice.  yeah well i dunno what im feeling...serious stuff goin on right now that i just dont feel like writing about.  im trying so hard to trust God...and i know that whatever he decides will be right...but im so afraid of what that will be...what will happen?  WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!?!?!  you dont know how scared i am.  how come now when i need someone the most they arent there...i mean have you ever felt like you love someone so much and they're right there but you cant reach them?  man it's the worse feeling ever!  i feel alone and seperated again.  even though i am not.   	yanno what one of the hardest things for me?  ok now this is gettin real personal and you're lucky im sharing it cuz right now i dont mind gettin personal.  the hardest thing for me is to put all my trust in God.  i mean i know in my head that no matter what happens to me in my life that there is a reason and God knows what he's doing.  but then there is my heart and that deep dark corner of my heart that doesnt want to trust somethin that it cannot see.  or maybe its that what God wants may not be what i want...and that scares me.  of course i know he knows what he's doing but my stupid puny human heart doesnt want to accept that if its not what i want.  i know that's so selfish.  maybe its cuz im scared that ill have to climb the mountain i've already climbed.  the mountain that i dont want to climb again.  that was the worst thing.  i dont want to have to do that again.  my God just give me another chance....please?  dont take away from me what i love...please? 	gosh life can be very hard sometimes.  on top of all of this i also had to go get blood taken.  NOT FUN AT ALL!  i almost fainted when they took it cuz they were just suckin it out and i didnt have much sugar in my blood and then the vein clamped down so they had to stop.  i had to like get back to normal and then they had to get the rest of the blood from the other arm!  so now i have 2 holes in my arms!  sheesh!  not fun at all...im not EVER doin that again!  anyways...not lookin forward to tomorrow...i gotta lots of work to do and then all that other stuff i've already explained (sorta)...i want everything to be ok again...i want it to be good again and i dont understand why it cant be...and how things can just change...i dont understand...

GOSH!  and geez i finished all my homework so i cant go do any of that...hahaha!  im pretty happy though...things are very nice right now.  im somewhat relaxed.  rather odd.  i cant wait for this weekend.  dunno what im gonna be doin...anybody got any ideas?!  yes well its 9:14...i dont wanna go to bed but i got nothin better to do...so i guess ill just stay up for a bit.  i probably wont even go to sleep till like 11 or 12.  its hard for me to fall asleep.  course it's easier when Marbles is in my bed.  i dont like to be alone.  its a whole bunch easier to sleep when she's around.  of course she takes up a ton of space and then i wish she wasnt there and then when she leaves im like "no come back"...hahaha...im so messed up!  im a picky little child.  anyways.  i think im gonna go find somethin to do.  ttyl.  bye.

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  i want to break somethin.  ok lets see what else is there that's botherin me....ummmmmmmm....im so broke its not funny....i have to try harder in algebra 2...and i have to get blood taken.  oh and then there is my license which i guess i need to get...but i dont feel like it.  cuz i dont have a car to drive and its not like my parents will actually let me drive one of their cars around.  so i'd have to buy myself a car and then get a job to pay for gas and insurance...which i cannot handle!  i just started to be ok with all this anxiety disorder and junk cuz i've learned how to deal with the anxiety i've had and now its like i got a new kinda of anxiety to deal with!  its not cool at all!  ill probably end up in counseling again before this year is up...which i really dont wanna do!   	im so like...FRUSTRATED!  i just want to go lie down and take a nap.  but thats impossible cuz i've never been able to nap.  and where is mal?!?!?  she's not online.  i was gonna call but she said she probably wouldnt be able to talk anyways so i didnt even try.  didnt wanna get my hopes up.  did you know that i saw her today at school like i do everyday...but right now i am REALLY MISSING HER!  i wish she was here.  that would be very nice.  its like i can relax when she's around...and everything kinda goes away and i feel ok.  life is so sweet when she's with me.  she really is an awesome person.  if you dont know her then you should.  i swear if there were more people in this world like her then life would be so much easier!  I LOVE HER!  i'd love her alot more if she was online right now...and i love her a whole LOT more if she was here!  hahaha! 	ok i guess im kinda feelin better.  not really but hey life is not perfect.  i learned that lesson already.  so im gonna try and not be upset bout it.  ha!  yeah right.  i guess ill be ok.  ok well dunno what to write bout now.  i think this is sufficient for now.  haha!  big word!  ok well yeah!  bye!

       	today started out pretty good...school felt great...i was havin fun...and i was like overly happy today!  it was very strange indeed.  course i didnt get to talk to mal really all day so i was not too happy bout that...but yeah.  made my french project.  got it right the second time cookin it!  hahaha!  its very good...a bit spicy but i like it spicy so its all good.  called Mal just a few min ago.  she was kinda busy i guess her and Ashley were doin stuff.  so yeah.  she had to go help cook Ash's french thing.  and i kinda feel guilty.  it makes me mad.  cuz like alot of times i want to talk to Mal or somethin and she'll be too busy.  and it just drives me insane.  course i dont wanna hog her either.  she does have other friends and i understand that...but yeah.  i guess i just dont like bein put second or anything...and i just hate not bein able to talk to her.  and i get depressed when she doesnt have time for me.  which i guess is stupid.  ill just deal with probably.  it'll be ok hopefully.  ha!  she's probably reading all of this too.  hahaha!   	oh yes i do have some good news!  no more psychiatrist appointments!  thank goodness!  thursday was my last one!  i went and we decided that i had really improved and that our goals had been reached.  my chest doesnt hurt anymore...which is awesome!  and yeah i get stressed some but i can handle it a bunch!  hey i g2g!  life's great!  ttyl!

       	ok well its sunday...been kinda slow today...not much happenin.  went to the movies last night.  mal and i saw school of rock instead of radio cuz it was sold out.  my gosh i love mal so much.  she makes me feel so good.  and yanno what?  its funny to me...cuz i always thought that no one could make me feel as happy as kari did.  but then again...kari didnt love me in return the same way that mal does.  man thats a great feeling.  just that someone loves me.  some stranger who loves me because they choose to.  i swear that is the cure for all hardships in the world.  just being around her can make all my problems go away.   	i hate to admit it but...i think im dependent on people.  if there was no one but me on this planet i dont think i'd survive.  i have to be around people.  and i love people.  sure people can be jerks now and then.  people are the cruelest creation that God ever made.  but people are also the most loving creatures God ever created.  but people on this earth have such terrible times.  human lives are so hard.  and most people dont know how to handle the hardships in their lives.  i didnt know how to and look at what i almost did.  i almost threw everything away.  and how many others are there like me out there?  how many people are so desperate that they would take their lives?  after what i went through i decided what i wanted to do when i grow up.  i want to help people.  people like me.  people who have no hope.  people who are sad.  people with no one to turn to.  i want to be the person they can turn to.  i want to show them that they are not alone.  that there are others in this world who experienced what they are.  i dont want them to go where i went.  i dont want them to ever get that close to the line.   	well im getting rather tired at the moment. i gots to go to church later so maybe ill write some more when i get back.  course Alias is on so i dunno...hehehe!

       through my tears  it is done.  i give up.  it is over.  i surrender.  my last breath of hope is gone and i have nothing left to hold on to.  my grip slips and i fall...back into the darkness of my pain...to the cruel world i know all too well...where there is no relief...where there is no mercy...and where there is no one to hear my cries...where i am alone once more.  i go quietly.  i dont fight.  i dont scream.  my tears fall silently...and all of this i accept...all of this i endure without fear.  for love sustains me...love lets me move on...and love lets me live each day.  and every night as i go to sleep at least ill know that i loved enough to let go...and ill find peace knowing she'll be happier.  and at least ill still be able to see her smile through all of my tears...   _______________________________________________________  This is my journal.  Most of this has to deal with my anxiety or the pain caused by my stress.  If you're reading this please dont feel sorry for me.  I dont want your sympathy.  I just want to be understood and i thank you for caring enough to read.  9/18/03 	Today was kinda weird.  I was content...sorta...i still miss kari...and getting to be around her.  i dont like the fact that seth and kari are close.  i hate not getting to be close to her...we hardly ever talk anymore...she seems to have moved on.  i kinda screwed up our friendship.  i kept on bringin up how i missed her and all...and i really do...but i dont think she understands that...she never loved me...not like i loved her.  love never dies and what she felt for me died...it was never love.  that hurts but i guess there really is nothin i can do to change that.  she seems so happy around seth now...and i guess that helps me...cuz now she can be happy...and that makes me happy. 	i've kinda moved on.  im talkin to mallory.  she's an awesome person.  she's not like anyone i've ever met.  her outlook on life just makes me cry.  its like someone i've been lookin for all my life...she doesnt worry bout anything...she can always find somethin good in everything that goes bad.  she makes me smile.  she makes me just think bout stuff totally differently.  i wanna say i love her...and i do in a way...maybe not as a girlfriend just yet... but there is hope and that helps me.  its kinda weird for me...i mean i really dont need someone to be happy but my gosh it makes things so much easier if i do have someone.  and mallory seems to be that person...its kinda weird...i still have feelings for kari but in a way i think that mallory would be better.   	i think the major problem for me is that i dont want a girlfriend like everyone else wants.  i have many friends...and all of them care for me...they all care about me and love me...but there is a problem...i guess its not a real problem...just a personal problem for me.  all my friends are here for me...usually...but then they get boyfriends or girlfriends and i suddenly become second.  i cant help that and i dont blame people for that...they are only human...but it hurts and its happened to me alot.  like all the sudden people dont have time for me.  thats why i want my girlfriend to be my bestfriend...cuz then i know that my friend will never not have time for me.  she'll always be there when i need her.  thats what i want from her...thats all i'd ask...and i'd give her whatever she'd want from me...i gave kari my heart and i think that i might be able to give that to someone else since she didnt want it.   	so now its mallory...she's great...wonderful person.  i was worrying about her today...i was worried bout what i should do bout our relationship.  we both know that we're interested in eachother...and she's wise to tell me that we should wait.  and i was also worried that now that she's starting to get scared of me.  cuz like i tell her bout how i am and how i worry bout stuff...and about my chest pain...and i was afraid she would just not like me anymore cuz im so messed up.  but she said that it was all ok and that she still likes me and that she thinks i should take more time to get over kari and work on my problems.  but she said she'd wait for me and that she'd be here...and my gosh that makes me feel so good that someone would wait for me...that she cares enough to wait.  makes me feel great.  cuz im wanted and somebody cares.   	well gosh this is long...and its only the first day...this is gonna be huge in like a month!  hehehe!  yanno now that i think bout it this is kinda nice...i get to just write everything down and its nice to let out...of course you cant talk back...but thats ok at least you're reading...well thats bout it for tonight...im tired and talkin to L...probably goin to bed soon...ttyl bye!  9/19/03 	today was ok again...nothin great happened...mallory was kinda quiet today...dunno why...she's really sweet when she talks to me but then she's like mallory when we're around everyone else...she likes to joke around...its great...i need the time to let out some stress.   	i kinda realized today that i do still love kari...i really miss her bad.  she doesnt talk to me anymore really...she's hurt or somethin and that just really bothers me.  she's so happy with seth now...she's always so happy and smiling around him...i dunno if maybe she just doesnt want him to see her upset...she always seems to be upset or somethin around me...or she's just not happy...i hate not being able to make her happy anymore...it stinks so bad.  and its still hurts to see seth flirt with her...she doesnt see it but he is...im a guy i so understand.  she just thinks he's bein a good friend but it so obvious that he likes her that its not even funny.  i feel so sick...makes me feel like crap that she doesnt love me anymore...well she never did like i said yesterday but yanno what i mean.   	i just dont get it and she cant give me an answer.  WHY NOT ME?  WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?  HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME AND YET TELL ME YOU DONT WANT TO BE MY GF?  DONT YOU MISS ME?  DO YOU HURT LIKE I DO?    she has no answer for me and i just dont understand.  i just hurts so bad.  my gosh i love her so much and yet i know i will never have her.  im trapped in a cage where im gonna have to spend the rest of my life knowing that she doest love me and that i will never be able to have her...and ill have to watch as other guys get to be close to her when i cant...and i will feel alone...not that thats new to me but its not a feeling i want to go back to feeling...which again leads to more pain.   	i guess i have some bittersweet happiness...cuz at least she'll be happy and i know that i loved her mor than anyone else could....i dont think she saw that but thats ok cuz at least she'll smile again...at least i loved her enough to let her go so that she could be happy...thats what true love is...being able to let go.  but its hard to truely be happy without her...cuz she could make all my pain go away and for once in my life i could feel happiness without the pain still raging...i dunno if you could understand what its like...for it to never go away and never give you a moment of peace...no relief...nothin...just always there...and then you meet someone that lets you feel somethin that you've never felt before...somethin you take for granted cuz you can feel it whenever you want...you can be happy...you can truely be happy...you dont have to laugh while still feeling pain...you dont have to smile when inside you feel like someone is ripping your heart out.  and i finally was able to experience that with kari...she showed me happiness...and for once i could smile and be happy.  and now that its gone and that im back to the way i dunno what to do...i want to feel that again...i want to be happy.  i wrote this bout 2 weeks when ellen and i were talkin and she thought that it was stupid cuz i couldnt be happy without someone...i wrote this to put it into perspective for her...  am i stupid cuz i want someone to cry to? am i desperate cuz i want someone to hold me when i dont think i can go on? do you think im silly cuz i want to be loved? do you think so?  you try living like me for a day...you try to live with my pain...every minute of everyday...you try to find comfort...you wont find it...you wont be able to feel peace or happiness...nothing...and no one will be able to understand you...you will be alone...and you will have no one to turn to...then after all of this you tell me if you still think im silly for wanting some comfort...  	kinda depressing...but its the truth...and i dont want to complain...i dont want you to feel sorry for me...i want people to understand that all those stupid things that you worry bout...all that stress you feel...just remember it could be worse...i know it could be worse for me...i dunno how much worse but i bet i could be...i really dont think people have an idea of what stress is like...i always laugh when people say "oh im so stressed" and yes maybe they are...but they dont know what stress is...you never understand what stress is until it starts to affect you physically and it wont go away...that is stress...stress that stresses you...that is what real stress is...what you feel is more worrying...its not stress...and i envy you...i wish i could be like that...like only gettin stressed sometimes...i wish i was normal...that would satisfy me...i wouldnt mind only have a little stress instead of stress 24/7.  yeah well im ramblin now...goin to the MA homecoming game with amy & aaron later...ill be back tonight to probably write some more...till then...au revoir!  after the game...same day... 	just got back from the Madison Academy homecoming game...lots of fun...lots of screaming!  i saw brandon, haley, kate, nadia, katie goode, katelin passon...and a ton of others!  it was alot of fun...a nice kinda.   	but now im back home and all the stuff is back...all that junk that is called my life...im talkin to mallory...and kari at the same time...kinda weird...the 2 girls i love...once that rejected me and hurt me and then the one that makes me feel like ill be ok and that ill get to keep goin on...i really want her to be mine right now...i dunno if i want that cuz i want just someone...it kinda feels right though...she's like the EXACT person i'd need...she could so help me with all my problems...but she dont wanna be like a fallback girlfriend...and i so understand cuz i wouldnt want to do that to her anyways...she doesnt deserve that...she's too great of a person to probably even deserve to be with me...im just a person full of trouble and problems... 	im really confused bout now bout my feelings!  i dunno what to do!  i still love kari..i still will forever...even if its in the deepest depths of my heart i will still love her always...but ill never have anything in return for that love so i gotta move on...and i want to move on to mallory and i know i could love her too...maybe even more than i ever loved kari even though i dont think thats possible but ya never know...but i dunno if im ready just yet for anyone new...but then i want someone new...someone to keep my mind off of kari...but i dont wanna just do somethin without thinking cuz if i do that then ill hurt someone...ill go out with someone and then realize i dont really like them and then ill just hurt someone...just like kari hurt me...and no one deserves that...even though it happens all the time i guess.  but still i dunno what to do... 	wow!  its 10:51...tiz very late...i should go to bed...but all i'd do is think some more and i kinda like writin it all down.  jennifer love hewitt is a cool singer...she's pretty good...sorry just thought i'd throw that in there.  yeah well im going to bed...if it's late when you're reading this then you need to go to bed too!  lol!  bye bye!  9/20/03 	saturday...its been an ok day so far...nothin too terrible has happened.  im goin to Madison Academy's homecoming party tonight with amy...i need to go change for that in a little bit for that...im supposed to look nice...dont really wanna go but hey i thought i'd be nice since amy's been so nice to me.   	i went to bed happy last night...mallory said she really was starting to like me more...WHICH IS TOTALLY AWESOME!  im pretty happy bout that...im starting to like her more too...even if its not as much as i like kari still...but kari has nothin more to give me so i need to move on to someone who does.  so im ok with this i guess...im still tryin to tell myself to forget kari cuz she'll never be there again...but my heart doesnt want to...this is so very hard...i know im in love...cuz even now...5 weeks later im still not ok...i still want kari so bad...and its not fair that i cant have her.  of course she might not be "the one".  would the one cause you this much pain?  what do you do when the only person who can stop your crying is the one who made you cry?   	pain hasnt been too bad today...mallory has helped that i guess...OH YEAH!  MADISON ACADEMY WON THEIR GAME 14 TO 6!  sorry i forgot to tell ya last night...hehehe!  oh yeah back to pain...not too noticeable...more of a sore feeling again.  i do feel very BLAH now.  i just want to not do anything...i just want everything to go away...I NEED A BREAK!  i want to like not go to school and dont wanna go and do anything...unless its with mallory...then i wouldnt mind...but EVERYTHING else needs to just go away!  of course i do have my senior high retreat in 5 days....that will be lots of fun....that's probably gonna be the only break ill be getting...and even that probably wont be a break from the pain...but hey i cant always get what i want so im not gonna complain.  I DONT WANNA GO TO THIS PARTY!  IM TOO TIRED! AND I WANT A BREAK!  ok there i said it!  lol...i wasnt gonna type that but then i thought hey this is MY journal ill type whatever i want to!  ok well...im goin to go change into some "nice" cloths for this party thing...ill be back later tonight...till then adios!  after the homecoming party...same day... 	back from the party...kinda boring...but hey i got to get out so it was fun.  hehehe.  talkin to mallory again.  i dont wanna go to bed...i've kinda wasted away my weekend but hey it was fun so im good...i kinda dont know what to say.  i was talkin bout my break up with kari...amy and i were talkin and she said that kari told katie goode a different story than what i told amy.  i really dont like that its been botherin me...i want to know what kari tells people so that im not tellin a different story cuz i dont wanna be that type of guy where kari's friends look at me and say "oh there goes kris...that jerk that hurt kari".  i want to be remembered as the guy that fell in love with kari but that was just not loved in return.  i dont our breakup to be anyones fault.  i want people to just know that it wasnt harsh or mean.  she just didnt love me and so it ended.  nothin mean or anything.  cept i kinda didnt let it happen that easily.  i fought for a little bit.  i didnt want to give up...in a way i still havent given up and i still do have hope.  but there isnt much there.  i did hurt her...and i feel so bad bout that...it was cuz i didnt let go so easy.  i wouldnt give up and eventually hurt our friendship.  so now i feel bad bout that.  i guess i cant help that now.  i've got to move on.  oui.  well i think im gonna go to bed now.  its 10:56.  late again.  night.  9/21/03 	well today is the day that i can legally get my license....but its a sunday so they're closed...ill just have to wait till another day...not like i have anywhere to go or anyone to go with or anything to go in.  hehehe!  im goin to the Junior High Devo tonight at L's house.  its gonna be fun!  L's the bomb!  and so is bay bay!  im not supposed to be goin cuz im in the senior high...but hey who would dare stop me!  im all powerful! MUHAHAHAHA!  ok fine!  geez...let me have my moment without think im an idiot!  hehehe!  yanno i wonder whose gonna read all of this!  they're gonn be like man he's really messed up.  aww well!  you just have to get over it!  lol!   	hmmmm...not what has been botherin me today.  i havent gotten to talk to mallory today.   she hasnt been online all day.  YANNO IT IS SO HARD TO STOP LOVING SOMEONE!  i still dont wanna let go of kari...at least a part of me doesnt want to.  but i really like mallory.  sometimes i wish i could just forget bout kari and just move on.  but its SOOOOOOO hard!  i mean for cryin out loud im in love with her!  i hate to admit it but i still am!  and i dont know how to stop!  am i supposed to?  it just doesnt seem right...but she doesnt love me!  i with there was a book on how to handle this.  like that told me "if you love someone and she dont love you, then you...."  and whatever!  wouldnt life jsut be great if we had a book on how to handle everything!  that'd be awesome!  i mean the bible is cool...its got everything i NEED to know to live....but like it doesnt have some of the stuff i'd like to have.  i guess thats where friends come into the picture.  L's nice...she kinda reminds me when to turn to God when im just too like stressed out to remember to do that...she's like my best Christian friend.  she's awesome!  i love her to death!  she helps me soo much!  of course she's also one of those girls that would never consider me as a bf cuz we're such good friends!  i've asked TWICE!  and she's said no both times.  i guess thats ok...i really am content with what she is to me....i like it how it is.  there are other girls.  there was kari...but now there's mallory.   	i kinda wonder if mallory's got a sweet side.  i havent really seen to much of that.  not sayin that she isnt nice cuz she really is.  but yanno i like girls who can be real sweet to me.  not that i wouldnt go out with a girl who wasnt...i mean i wanted to go out with L!  hehehe!  not too much sweetness there!  mallory has been pretty sweet to me...maybe not as sweet as i'd like...but hey i might as well see what she's really like....i guess ill find out over time.  sweetness isnt exactly a priority for me...its more just will she love me back.   that'd be sweet enough for me!  hehehe!  well im bout tired out of writing for now.  ill probably be back after the devo....MISS ME!  9/23/03 	well i didnt write yesterday...was i monday?  i guess so...yeah it was...wow its only tuesday...thats crazy!  i thought it would be like wednesday already.  gosh...i want this week to go by quicker!  IM READY FOR MY RETREAT!  of course L wont be there and thats not gonna be cool at all....L is so awesome!  i love her to death...she's like the person i go to when i need to just like get away from everyone else...just like free time... 	well mallory are like this >  after piano lessons...same day....  i still hurt....and there is still no relief...i still cry....and still no one hears...and i am still silent...still bearing what i must...still wondering why...still wondering what is to become of me...i hide among the crouds...so not to reveal my pain...i hide behind a wall to hide the cold scared confused boy...who knows not what to do...where do i turn?  who will come and tear down that wall?  who cares enough to notice?  who cares enough to hold me?  who will love me?  	wrote that a couple days ago...i was really kinda feelin it again...that missin kari thing...it came back full force.  well i put it in my profile...which i usually do...and mallory read it and she said she'd love me...it was the sweetest thing...almost made me cry...she's so sweet!  i love her to death!  she really does make me feel good.   	chest hasnt been hurting too much since i found out that mal likes me.  maybe that just gives me comfort...to know that someone loves you...even though yanno they dont have to...its like a choice they make.  not like a parent or sibling which kinda "have" to love you...but some stranger who decides to love you...that makes me feel special...and i love that feeling and it kinda hides my pain...its wonderful to be able to truely feel happiness.  ok well im happy so im gonna stop writing...so i dont accidently stir up old feelings...cya tomorrow...  9/24/03 	well its wednesday.  2 days till the senior high retreat!  im so ready to go!  i kinda wanted to go to the big spring jam but hey i'd really rather go to the retreat...it would benefit me more.  well...kari asked me today why i dont like talk to her at school.  and i told her the truth...it just hurts to talk to her...it just so many good memories...it brings back all the memories that i miss...and the makes me think bout that stuff that im not gonna be able to experience with her.  and i dont wanna think bout that now.  cuz i really want mallory now and i think she'll really care for me and i really hope she'll love me back.  i would love that right now.  specially from her.  yeah. well its late and i dont feel like writing any more.  9/25/03 	SENIOR HIGH RETREAT TOMORROW!  woohoo!  i cant wait!  im so ready to go!  oh yeah!  go kris!  gettin out of here!  i had my choir concert today...i thought it was ok...most people thought it was great and it was...we were very good.  chest pain hasnt been to bad this week...i guess thats been good...im still just so emotionally just AHHH!  this is journal thing is starting to get short again.  i guess im not thinkin too much bout my pain so im not complaining about it...its so much easier just to ignore it.  yes...again im leaving...im too busy talkin to mallory to write!  so cya MONDAY!  ill be gone ALL WEEKEND!  10/4/03 	well its been a LONG time since i've written in this.  alot has happened.  senior high retreat was fun.  i wish ellen had gone it would have been alot more fun with her.  she's my closest true friend.  she's so awesome!  its too bad i cant take a piece of her and just stick in here.   aww well.  leavin tomorrow for california.  goin to see Grandpa probably for the last time.  he's supposed to die in bout 2 months.  i dont seem sad do i?  i dont feel sadness.  i dunno why.  i want to say that i find comfort in knowing that he'll be in a better place...but i cant cuz he's not saved.  i think its just me.  i dont feel much anymore.  all i can feel is my pain and anxiety which focuses around my relationships and around my pain too.  i dunno if somethin's wrong with me. maybe im just too depressed and strained right now.  i just dont feel sad.  maybe i dont realize what is happening.  or maybe i just dont wanna accept it.  i dunno.  i think im just so past emotions right now.  im so sick of them.  arent emotions an amazing thing?  they can take you to highest peak and then can drag you to the darkest depths.  lol.  you can tell i've had a lot of time to think bout all of this.  i like to analyze feelings.  probably why i wanna be a psychologist.  feelings are the coolest things.  and the most terrible things too.   	mallory and i are goin out now.  yep we sho are!  it was so funny.  we like to play the question game and all.  of course i tend to ask most of the questions but hey thats ok.  well the other night i asked her to ask me a question.  she asked one.  and i said yes.  LOL!  thats right!  she asked me out!  she took my job away!  lol!  it was pretty cool.  yes well now the hard part comes.  im still so in love with kari.  this is the biggest dilemma i've ever had. i love kari so much but she doesnt love me and probably never will (not that i dont have hope) and then i have mallory who is so loyal to me and likes me alot.  but it is so hard to have feelings for her.  it doesnt feel right...kari and i feel right.  my gosh i miss her so much.  but i miss mal too!  i like her and really i think she's the person i like the most after kari.  this is so hard!  what am i supposed to do?  stop following what my heart tells me is right and follow what makes logical sense?  is love logical?  why must it be so unpredictable?  why cant love work when i need it to?  why cant i be loved by the one i love?  i really hope you never have to experience this.  its not fun at all.  it hurts so bad.  especially if you're like me. 	i had an epiphany the other day.  i think thats how you spell it.  i realized after 2 whole yrs that ALL of my anxiety and pain revolves around 2 fears.  the fear of rejection and the fear of being alone.  that is the root of everything.  i finally figured it out.  i dunno if it makes me feel any better but at least i know why i feel this way now.  but it just makes sense.  this really all started at the end of school in 8th grade when Courtney, Vickie, Aaron, and Trey and their group (which included me at the time) started to get closer.  and i was slowly pushed out.  i felt rejected then.  and scared taht i was losing a friendship.  all that built up and i threw up on the 2nd to the last day of school from all the stress.  then in 9th grade in our first semester kari and maria were like bestfriends so they were always hangin out and trey and kari were gettin close for reasons that i cant tell you...and i just felt left out and rejected again.  and thats when i went into a depression and stopped eating and just got really low.  and of course all the "little" incidents all revolve around my fears.  but then there is the worse rejection.  the one from kari.  my gosh that was and is the worst.  cuz not only was i rejected by someone i had given my heart to but i was also left alone.  with no one.  and i sunk.  really low.  and i got really depressed.  it was bad.  worse than anyone could have thought.  kristopher.  the good christian boy.  the boy who is always so happy.  who loves bein around peopel and jokin around.  nobody ever sees the real kristopher.  the cold scared boy who hides behind his wall as he cries.  nobody sees or hears him.  one because he hides it and 2 cuz they dont wanna think that someone around them is unhappy cuz then they get upset.  kari doesnt even know how low i got...i probably couldnt tell her anyways.  i dont want her to feel guilty.  its not really her fault...she caused it but its not her fault.  and now you're askin how low i got?  you really wanna know?  you might regret that...did you know that there are 18 knives in my house?  18.  did you know that at around 10:00 everyone but me goes to bed and im alone?  can you figure out how low i was?  i had it all planned out.  im not gonna make  you listen to that.  you probably dont want to.  but i was really close.  have you ever thought bout that?  well probably not...most people dont get that low...i wish i were like them...oh i would give so much just for a day like them.  but no have you thought...isnt it amazing how such a simple device, a blade, can take everything away.  a blade could make my pain go away and my stress just disappear.  isnt it funny how people cant help themselves but simple little things can help them.  somethin so simple could stop such a complicated problem.  man i was close.  so close.  but then i thought...if i go then what bout the people that depend on me?  what bout mallory?  she loves me...why should i put her through that pain.  or ellen...what would she think...she'd be disappointed in me.  or davida?  she doesnt deserve to be put through that.  or kari?  she doesnt deserve to feel that either or to feel guilty.  and someday she might need me...and i wouldnt be there for her.  or my family?  that would be so terrible for them.  and Jesus?  he would be so disappointed that i couldnt have faith enough to keep going.  and i couldnt kill myself because of Him.  He died for me...He gave me a gift and i would be throughing it back in his face.  i could not bring myself to do that.   	but now i have to say to all of those out there that are suicidal.  if you are reading this listen to me.  this world is cruel and terrible place.  it shows no mercy to you or anyone else.  and it will never let you rest.  but think...if everyone in the world killed themselves when they got down what would the world be like?  it would be whole lot worse.  it would be hell.  you and i...we are important in this world.  all those people i mentioned above depend on me.  they depend on me to be happy at least somewhat.  they would be really sad if i killed myself.  i carry some of their pain.  they will never experience it for i am the one who does but in a way it is their  pain.  you see people who are suicidal...they are the people that carry the most pain in this world.  they are the ones who bear what others cant.  they bear the pain of the world.  but if you are one of those people dont lose hope.  dont feel alone.  dont feel cheated out of life.  there is hope.  and there is a way to feel what others are blessed enough to feel everyday.  you can be happy.  just have faith in God.  He will never leave you.  You will never be alone with him by your side.  He will ALWAYS be there.  and with Him you can live a life like everyone else and even a better life than most.  cuz what can this world do to you if you have God on your side?  and remember this verse...it is the my favorite verse in the Bible and it helps me live each day.   "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." -Matthew 11:28

       o holy night...the stars are brightly shining.  it is the night of our dear savior's birth.  long lay the world...in sin and error pinning...til He appeared and the soul felt its worth.  a thrill of hope.  the weary world rejoices.  for yonder breaks...a new and glorious morn.  fall on your knees.  o hear the angel voices.  o night divine.  o night...when christ was born.  o night...divine...o night...o night divine.  truly He taught us to love one another...His law is life and His gospel is truth.  chains shall He break for the slave is our brother.  and in His name all oppresion shall cease.  sweet hymns of joy...in grateful chorus raise we...let all within us praise His holy name.  Christ is the Lord...oh praise His name forever...His power and glory ever more proclaim.  o night...divine...o night...o night divine...

       	goodness i feel so much better than i did a couple of days ago.  i feel like a big weight has been lifted off me.  im so at ease.  its like i dont have to worry about anything.  i can feel that ill be ok.  that my life will continue as it was meant to and that everything that has happened to me had a purpose.  and that everything has just helped make me stronger.  gosh i feel so much stronger.  i havent felt like this in a long time.  its so relaxing.  but like i said everything has really helped make me stronger.  and i was thinkin about that lastnight.  and i started remembering what i almost did such a long time ago.  and yanno...that was a terrible thing and i am so ashamed that i came that close.  but i realized how much having that experience benefited me.  i have totally different outlook on death.  im not afraid of it.  it doesnt scare me to die...instead death is simply a reward.  because when you die you are free.  free from all this cruel world.  death is like God's second gift to the world.  you need his first gift of Jesus if you want to truly enjoy his second gift but when you do then death will be your reward for living a Christian life.  i said the other day that i long for death.  and yes that is true.  i dont want to kill myself.  i wont make that mistake again.  but i still cant wait to die.  because i know that when i die i will be free.  i wont have hurt.  i wont have to cry.  ill get to be with my God.  but until the day comes for me i know i can trust him to take care of me.  i've been looking for so long for someone i can always depend on.  and i have been crushed by so many people.  so many people that couldnt...because the are only human.  and that whole time He was always right there.  reaching out to me.  and i never reached out in turn.  i was so blind.  and then someone helped me see.  funny though.  i love her so much.  and even though she was one of the people that hurt me she was still able to help me.  and i am so thankful that God let me know her.  she is such an amazing person.  and i adore her.  i know now that God will make everything ok.  and that God will hold me when no one else does.  i will still cry.  i will still miss them.  and i will never stop loving them.  because i cant.  but God will hold me up.  everything will be ok.  and i will always be able to lean on Him...through all of my tears...

       when i am down and oh my soul so weary...when troubles come and my heart burdened be...then i am still and wait here in the silence...until you come and sit awhile with me...you raise me up so i can stand on mountains...you raise me up to walk on stormy seas...i am strong when i am on your shoulders...you raise me up...to more than i can be...there is no life...no life without its hunger...each restless heart beats so imperfectly...but when you come and i am filled with wonder...sometimes i think i glimpse eternity...

       	ok all the sudden i feel like writing.  i cannot explain to you how im hurting.  gosh.  its like im so just emotionally upset and destroyed.  just like all my feelings are so screwed up.  i dont know what im feeling anymore.  im sad.  im mad.  im just dead inside.  im so overwhelmed that i cant...i cant handle this.  and all of this is stressing me out which in turn is making my chest hurt.  its hurting really bad right now.  and its hard to breathe.  i feel like im bein crushed.  God why do i have to be this way?  why?  i think im having a panic attack.  im scared.  i havent had one since i had to go to a dentist appointment and Kari was there.  hold on.  i need to go lie down.  ok.  my chest is still hurting.  but it hurts most of the time nowadays.  its just really bad right now.  i dont know where to start.  im trying to sort out my feelings so i can write them down.  but its really hard.  my gosh i miss them so much.  i cant stop crying.  i love them.  and its so hard to accept the fact that they dont.  its just like they threw it all away like it meant nothing to them.  that everytime they said they loved me...it all meant nothing to them.  it was nothing.  but i was silly enough to love.  and my love was not worthless.  it was not fake.  i meant something.  and its not fair.  why do i still have to love?  i know that they didnt mean to hurt me...they would never want to hurt me...but they did.  im so stupid.  i become so attached to people who can be there for me always.  and i always get hurt.  i should have known that Mal would eventually, unintentionally hurt me.  i did know.  i didnt want to believe that would ever happen.  yanno what the hardest aftereffects of attempted suicide is.  once you've tried...it is so easy to try again.  because there is no longer the fear.  because you know that you CAN do it.  the only thing that stops you is yourself.  i hate this world.  i hate it here.  i hate everything about it.  i hate it.  im not afraid to die.  i am sixteen years old.  i long for death.  ill never make the mistake of trying to take my life again...but i still cant wait for relief.  for rest.  oh gosh.  its happening again.  i cant breathe.  im tired.  i do feel somewhat better.  L has been tryin to talk some sense into me...she does a pretty good job....  gosh my chest is killin me.  freakin anxiety disorders suck!  im so confused right now.  i dont know what to feel.  wow.  confusion.  i need time to rest.  and pray.  goodnight.

       	dont worry Drew.  im not making that mistake.  not again.  im just very tired.  emotionally that is.  it might have to do with the fact that im sick and thats really draining me.  but mostly its just all my emotions and the lack of emotion at the same time.  yanno.  there is just so much pain and its starting to really affect me.  i mean i know ill survive.  i have no doubt about that.  i did it once i can do it a thousand more times.  right now is just not a good time for me.  i've reached my low point.  but at least now i know that the only place to go is up.  but thanks Drew.  you dont know how much it means to me that you cared.  we need some more people in the world like you.  you're really a great friend.  hope i see ya around next semester.  now i must go and rest.  bein sick sucks.

       	well today the choir went to sing for some of the elderly people in the nursing homes.  that was fun.  i loved seeing their faces when we were done with a song.  they were all smiling and happy.  and they would sing along.  and dance along.  and it was jsut fun.  and even after all that fun im still not feeling good.  today just has been a good day for kris's feelings.  everything just kinda crept up on me when i wasnt paying attention.  or maybe i just didnt have the strength to fight it off.  but whatever.  im too tired and strained to deal with this.  ok.  done now.  goodnight.

       My Immortal by Evanescence  I'm so tired of being here,  Supressed by all my childish fears, and if you have to leave, I wish that you would just leave, Cause your presence still lingers here, and it won't leave me alone,  These wounds won't seem to heal, This pain is just too real, There's just too much that time cannot erase,  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears, When you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears, and I held your hand through all of these years, But you still...have...all of me,  You used to captivate me, by your resignating mind, now i'm bound by the life you left behind, Your face it haunts,  my once pleasant dreams, your voice it chased away, all the sanity in me,  These wounds won't seem to heal,  this pain is just to real, there's just too much that time cannot erase,  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears, when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears, and I held your hand through all of these years, but you still...have...all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that your gone, but though you're still with me, I've been alone all along,  When you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears, when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears, and I held your hand through all of these years, but you still...have...all of me

       	i got pissed.  i lost it.  bad.  it was erik.  he just pushed me over the edge.  he pushed karin.  he hit her and pushed her.  and that just really pissed me off.  omgosh.  i just got up and told him not to touch her.  and he just got real pissed like he usually does when someone tells him what to do.  and he was just like you couldnt touch me.  and man i just lost it.  i pushed him and just yelled "wanna bet i cant touch you?!"  he thinks he's just so big and bad.  he's 13.  he's a foot and half shorter than me and about 40 pds lighter.  and i've never been a brother who's ever picked on him.  i dont like bein mean to people or hurting people.  i dont think i've ever really hurt him.  and i didnt just now.  i just scared him i think.  but i know he's hit her more than just once.  she told me that he's hit her more than jsut then.  and she was crying.  and i couldnt stand that.  he's treated her like crap since the day she was born.  he's always hated her.  and anything she says he'll automatically say somethin diragatory about it.  and im so sick of it.  he doesnt understand what he does.  yeah sure afterwards its like...oh ok lets just go on with our lives.  but its not that simple for her.  i can tell how fed up with it she is.  i can see how much it hurts her.  im so sick of him hurting her.  i told him that if he touches her again i will hurt him.  and i plan to.  i dont care what happens to me.  no one is going to touch her.  no one is going to hurt her.  cuz i know what happens to people who are abused.  i am a living example.  the funny thing is that...i didnt have anyone picking on me.  i just didnt have anyone to turn to when i was upset.  i didnt have anyone to understand me.  i was and still am haunted by a pain that doesnt show mercy.  you dont know what that can do to someone.  well if you know me very well then you might know what it can do.  but yeah.  i dont wanna talk about this.  im going to play the piano.  oh joy.  IM SINGING O HOLY NIGHT WITH CARISSA!  OH ITS GONNA BE SO COOL!

       	it hurts.  it really hurts alot.  i've always had some hope.  some wish.  that maybe...maybe they'd still miss me.  just a little.  maybe deep down somewhere there was a part of them that missed me.  that still loved me.  so that i might be able to find some comfort in that little love that was left.  so that it wouldnt hurt when i breathe...

       	its friday.  oh yes.  much fun.  i went and saw The Haunted Mansion with Tenea, Cow, Donkey, and James!  it was so much fun!  Donkey screamed!  hahahaha!  it was so funny!  ok yeah enough bout that.  came home.  finished watchin X-Men 2.  i dont like that movie.  its so sad at the end when that girl dies!  very sad movie.  it also brings back Kari memories.  i remember we were watchin it when i fell for her.  we were just in the theater and she said somethin to me that just made me melt so bad.  i swear that was one of the happiest moments of my life.  i miss that feeling.  where a person just makes you feel so helpless cuz they are so sweet but at the exact same time you feel so secure cuz you trust that person so much.  because you love that person so much.  you what some of the happiest moments now are?  when, just for a moment, i can see a flicker of that love in their eyes.  and then i melt all over again.  its nice to feel it again...even if it's for a second.  and even if its not really there.  its still great.  gosh...THE CANON IN D IS THE BEST SONG EVER!  before i die i WILL play this song!  i promise!  oh goodness it makes me so happy.  its like one of those songs that is both happy and sad at the same time.  its so wonderful.  sigh.  i've got it on repeat.  i can already play some of it.  i must say its not as hard as i thought it would have been.  OMGOSH IT IS THE BEST!  ok.  enough of that.  well i guess im done writing for tonight.  have a goodnight.  bon soir.

       	i read ashley anne's book today.  goodness the girl almost made me cry.  every feeling she described i understood so well.  it was almost like i was reading my thoughts only someone else had written them.  ASHLEY I LOVE YOU!  you are an awesome person!  and you are beautiful ashley!  dont ever think that you arent!  anyone who tells you that is blind!  i feel like i've found someone who can somewhat understand me.  even though i dont talk to her as much as i would like...she is such a good person.   	yeah well i do feel slightly better now.  actually im more in one of those moods where you dont feel anything really.  im too tired of feelings to feel anything.  im still sad about Mal.  i miss her sooooo much.  i cant even describe how much i do.  im very upset about my family.  erik and dad just stress me out!  and they have forever.  they dont even know it.  i talked to my mom a little.  it helped.  somewhat.  at least it was nice to talk.  she's like the only person in my family i really talk to.  i guess its easier to talk to her cuz we have so much in common.  we're so much alike its almost scary.  i dont talk to my dad much.  it bothers him i've found out.  i never knew he really cared.  or that he wanted me to talk to him.  i've never thought about askin him to help with my emotional stuff.  i dunno.  he's not like me at all.  he's not sensitive or anything.  i dunno.  i guess i just dont think he'd be able to understand as much as mom does.  yeah well...ok.  im done.  blah.  i swear i dunno what im feeling.  its like...nothin even though i know what feelings are there.  im so screwed up.   too tired to feel.  aww well.  this is it for tonight.  off to watch 24.  goodnight.

       	i am proud that i dont let go.  that i cant let go.  i am proud that my feelings are not meaningless things that i can just throw away.  i am proud that my love means something.  i am proud that the way i feel is real.  i am not ashamed of the way i am.  and i am sick of people makin fun of the way i am.  i am sick of being called stupid or hopeless or pathetic.  im sick of it.  dad and i just got in a fight.  well actually it was while i was writing this.  he gets so pissed at things sometimes.  just whenever somethin doesnt work the way he had hoped.  he just gets all mad and he displays his anger to everyone.  it drives me nuts.  i guess it cuz im one of those people who hides his feelings.  you dont know how much pain it puts me in when someone is upset.  whenever my brother gets pissed at somethin.  oh gosh it makes me so upset.  or when dad gets mad at somethin.  or the family gets mad at eachother and starts yelling.  i can not describe how much pain i was just in when dad and i got mad at eachother.  i just came out and said that im sick of him gettin mad whenever somethin didnt work (in this case the printer didnt work correctly).  which he always gets mad at us kids for gettin pissed at somethin and he does the exact same thing that we do.  and i really dont do that much cuz i just choose to keep my anger inside.  but gosh im so SICK OF IT!  im so sick of all these things.  its like you're home shoud be a place where you feel safe and secure.  i dont feel safe here...gosh most of the time i just wanna be away from this place.  my home is more of a challenge to live in then what you'd really call a home.  thats why im so tired.  home.  on top of everything else.  sigh.  i want to go away.  i want to curl up in a ball and just disappear.  blah.  im going to bed.  goodnight.

       	i am soooooooo TIRED!  mom and dad are just stressin me out.  they dont even know it.  erik is really stressin me out bad and he's been doin it forever.  he doesnt know it.  karin doesnt really stress me out.  i dunno.  she doesnt do anything to bug me or anything.  she doesnt usually make life complicated.  then all the feelings i've talked bout a few days ago.  i still miss Mal.  i cant stop really.  its not like Kari where i got super depressed.  its just i ache.  so bad.  i thought it'd be easier to see her and all after we talked on like last tuesday.  i dunno...just seein her brings back all those old feelings.  all those questions of why?  where did the love go?  i dunno how to describe it.  i guess all i can say is that i miss her.  i miss what i had.  blah.  we're gettin to emotional again.  im goin to disappear.  au revoir.

       i've been crying.  which you probably already know.  im so overwhelmed.  its not like im stressed...well i guess in a way i am.  but its not really Life this time.  its my feelings.  my emotions.  i have never felt like this before.  when you've wanted something so bad you'd do anything for it.  yeah thats right now.  even if its not forever.  my gosh i just cant stop.  yanno...i just feel like crying.  so why not.  im sick of trying to hold my feelings in and hide them away.  i cannot describe how much my heart aches.  i hate crying alone.  i want...nvm.  i just...i am hurting so much.  i so just wanna come out and just spill everything and say it but im too scared to.  im afraid of what will happen.  which is so stupid...because as long as i wait i will hurt.  GOSH!  this is so hard.  i just wanna talk to someone.  well anyone.  ok i've said too much already.  im goin to bed.  tiz late.  bon soir.

       the cries of a weary soul.  unable to stop these tears of anguish.  these tears of a longing that will not die.  they fall and no one hears.  no one sees.  they are the tears of a lost heart.  a heart that hopes...that dreams.  a heart that lives...haunted by the memories.  please Lord...help me...hear my prayer...

       J'ai compris tous les mots, j'ai bien compris, merci...raisonnable et nouveau, c'est ainsi par ici...que les choses ont changé, que les fleurs ont fané...que le temps d'avant, c'était le temps d'avant...que si tout zappe et lasse, les amours aussi passent...il faut que tu saches...  J'irai chercher ton coeur si tu l'emportes ailleurs...même si dans tes danses d'autres dansent tes heures...j'irai chercher ton âme dans les froids dans les flammes...je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m'aimes encore...  Fallait pas commencer m'attirer me toucher...fallait pas tant donner moi je sais pas jouer...on me dit qu'aujourd'hui, on me dit que les autres font ainsi...je ne suis pas les autres...avant que l'on s'attache, avant que l'on se gâche...je veux que tu saches...  Je trouverai des langages pour chanter tes louanges...je ferai nos bagages pour d'infinies vendanges...les formules magiques des marabouts d'Afrique...j'les dirai sans remords pour que tu m'aimes encore...  Je m'inventerai roi pour que tu me retiennes...je me ferai nouvelle pour que le feu reprenne...je deviendrai ces autres qui te donnent du plaisir...vos jeux seront les nôtres si tel est ton désir...plus brillante plus belle pour une autre étincelle...je me changerai en or pour que tu m'aimes encore......

       there was a time...oh so long ago...when you longed just to be with me.  there was a time...a time of joy...when you dreamed of only me.  a time...when you loved me....and all you wanted was to hold me.  a time...when you could dry every tear.  and once upon a time...you could see into my heart...and into my soul.  and then i blinKed and you were gone...lost in my greatest mistAke.  oh how i long for just one more time.  one moRe chance.  one more heven.  i have missed you everyday.  and i still cry....i still cant sleep at nIght.  and i still die...each time i see your face.  i still hope...for one more moment...for another chance to love.  i breathe to see....just one more smile.  because i have to dream...through my tears...

       i cant descibe what im feeling right now.  i dunno.  all the sudden i just felt like crying.  i dunno why really.  im not sad.  im not depressed.  just lonely.  if that makes any sense at all.  i've just been remembering alot lately.  yanno the time between when you get into bed and you fall asleep.  thats my time.  the time when i think yanno...when i remember...when i dream sorta....cuz i dont dream when im asleep...i dream to me is more me living a perfect moment in my head.  its the closest thing to a dream i have.  but those moments...gosh i never thought they could ever feel so real.  maybe im just desperate for the feeling that i long to feel...loved.  i dunno.  was there anything i could have done differently?  i dunno why i keep thinking its my fault...i just have always felt that there must have been something i could have done.  i want her right now.  i've been fine for awhile...but i need to feel it again.  well its more that i want to feel it again.  funny isnt it?  my undoing, my weakness...my love.  i miss her...and she probably doesnt even know it...she cant tell anymore...and i cant tell her.  no matter how much i cry...she wont see.  its so crazy everything that has happened between us.  i remember the day i found out...ha...that was a great day...it seems like it was just last week.  she still is my everything...   ...i still cry...i still can't sleep at night...and i still die...each time i see your face...and still i know ill love again... ...through my tears...

       what lies before me.  what stands between.  no one can tell me...what i have seen.  some see the tarnish.  i see the gleam.  i have to wonder.  i have to dream.  one dream can change you.  one dream can make...all the difference...one heart can take.  i dream of flying.  im in midair.  i have to wonder...what's out there.  the skies the limit.  today's the day.  heavens are still there...when skies are gray.  someday's are better....than they seem.  someday's are better...because you dream.  on rainbows...two rainbows.  i know what i see.  i have to wonder.  i have to dream...

       here is a great poem that James wrote!  be sure to check it out in this year's Lit Mag!  Only me, hope and wish These days there's nothing to do there is only a me and never a you i wished i was loved like i wanted to be i wished i was loved by more than just me I feel all alone only emptiness in me my family always moans and refuse to treat me as i am, grown i know i am not grown but i am more than a ball to be thrown from wall to wall of this family of mine my rope of hope is almost gone now mearly a twine my only wish is to feel like a family this constant war is hell in my life going back and fourth not knowing what to believe, but then i remember it is only me me who is not loved by anyone else me who wants to hug, but never has felt the love i want to feel from more than just me they all have love, a family of one. i hope for one day a normal life and for all those putrid souls i spit at them with spite and hope that the night of my departure will be taken as easily for them as it will be for me

       	well just got the iLife '04 software for the Mac.  its totally awesome.  my favorite app is the GarageBand program!  its like this thing that lets you make your own music.  i've been using included loops of instruments playing to make my own music.  i posted the ones i have so far on my iDisk.  just click on the "GarageBand Tunes" link over there on the right!  there you can download the files.  oh my favorites are Falling Keys and Flowing Tears.  they are in MP3 so most everyone should be able to hear them.  if you need a jukebox to play them though you can get a free download of iTunes for the Mac and PC by clicking on the "iTunes Music Store" link.  enjoy the tunes!

       	i have never really just been close to my dad.  i mean its never been like i dont like him.  he's just nothin really like me.  i dont have much in common with him.  but yanno he still cool and all...i've just never been really close to him.  i've always been closer to my mom.  cuz she's alot like me.  her personality is alot like mine and we think alike...cept on cleaning my room...hehehe.  well gosh...my parents have been gone for a week.  and i really miss them.  my mom wont be coming home for a few week or two...but dad's comin home monday morning.  and i cannot wait for him to come home.  i swear i am gonna give him the biggest hug when he comes back.  this has just been a whole lot to handle.  i mean i've had to just take care of my brother and sister the whole week.  its not as easy as you'd think.  woulda been alot easier if it was just me.  and then my grandparents came and they arent really sure what's supposed to be goin on cuz they dont live here so i have to still make sure everything gets done.  its like takin care of 4 people.  its not the easiest thing ever.  I NEED A VACATION!  well i guess if i just wait till spring break and i get to go to Paris, Versailles, and London!  OH DANG!  got my passport papers all worked out and im leavin on like march 17!  i cant wait!  oh yes and my sister is so cool!  i just realized it today that she really isnt as much of a loser as i thought!  hahaha!  she's a pretty awesome person.  yeah i love her.  thats right i said it...I LOVE MY SISTER!  hahaha!

I will be...strong on my own...I will see through the rain...I will find my way...I will keep on...traveling this road...till I finally reach my dream...till I'm living and I'm breathing...my destiny...  it comforts me...it keeps me...alive each day of my life...always guiding me...providing me...with the hope I desperately need.....well I gotta believe...there's something out there meant for me...I get on my knees...praying I will receive...the courage to grow and the faith to know.......  that I will be...strong on my own...I will see through the rain...I will find my way...I will keep on...traveling this road...till I finally reach my dream...till I'm living and I'm breathing...my destiny...

       	i do feel better now.  so many people are happy around me.  so many people that i love dearly.  i dunno if i did anything for them but it doesnt matter...as long as they're happy.  its so wonderful to see people you used to be close to...and they're happy...and smiling....it hurts too but its still wonderful.  i dont mind hurting if they are happy.  ha.  i doubt any of them even read this anymore.  i love them.  some of them probably dont even know it...or just dont want me to.  i've been wallowing alot lately.  maybe its that grandpa died.  i dunno.  i've just been remembering everything.  reliving everything i've experienced...the good and the bad.  reliving the bad hurts...but in a way i want to relive it again.  i dont want to forget them because they make me stronger.  and the good...they make me smile and cry at the same time.  i cant even explain how real they are...the memories...i can just bring them back to life...and i can feel everything...its like im there again.  i wish i could just stop in those moment and never leave.  just to hold on to that feeling forever and never let it go.  but its like holding your breath...you can hold it for awhile but eventually you have to let it go.  i just hope that its the feeling i hold as i someday take my last breath: peace

       	i feel so helpless.  i cant help any of the people i love.  i cant.  i dont know how.  i try hard but it just never helps.  it hurts so bad and its so frustrating.  its like all around i can see all these people hurting.  and i cant make them feel any better....no matter how hard i try i just cant.  i'd do anything to help them...to help her.  she's always been there for me and i cant help her.  i promise that i try.  but its not helping.  i just keep screwin things up...i cant make them happy.  and now comes a new pain.  one i havent felt before.  my chest pains have come back but this is new.  its not physical at all.  even though at times its caused physical stuff.  its like a torture...its kindness.  a kindness that tortures me.  sometimes i feel it again.  just for a moment.  a few seconds.  but in those seconds i feel so good....so relaxed...i feel loved.  its there.  just a flash of it in the eyes.  that look that just makes you melt.  and you're at peace.  and then its gone.  and you realize that it was only a shadow.  just a false hope.  and that is the worse form of torment.  the kindness that tortures me...and the kindness that makes the rest of the world just disappear...

       	he's gone.  i found out this morning when i woke up and my mom was crying.  now i can feel how much everything that has happened to me has just sucked out my emotions.  i havent cried.  i know im going to miss him...and im sad.  im not really that sad though.  i dont feel much at all.  i dunno if thats a bad thing.  i've only cried for everyone i know who is sad.  i've been doing that alot lately but especially today.  i just want to make my mom feel better.  i want my Dita to stop crying.  and i cry because i cant make them happy.  im always upset whenever i cant help someone.  its cuz im a freakin codependent.  i cant be happy unless everyone else around me is happy...sorta like that.  i feel just so...nothing....there is just nothing.  i just want to go into a corner and wallow...ha.  ya ever just wanna just lie around maybe on the couch or on your bed and just hear someone you love talking...just their voice...i want to hear her voice...

"i am so tired of the tears shed at night"...Drew i still cry...even though i know God will make it ok...and i am not ashamed of it.  maybe it will prove to so many people that my feelings are real and not mere shadows...

       	well back from Florida.  dont i sound just thrilled.  ha.  actually i am pretty happy to be back.  i like home.  notice i didnt say i like Alabama...hehehe.  didnt really do much that i enjoyed while we were down there.  i dont really like goin much anymore.  it was cool at first but then it kinda became a family tradition and it lost all the excitement.  i dunno.  my dad loves goin down there so i dont say anything.  if it makes him happy then i guess i can stand it for a week.  really the best part about it was walkin on the beach.  4 MILES!  TWICE!  and i was alone!  and it was quiet!  well sorta.  i didnt have to be around anyone in my family so there was no one around to stress me out!  ah heaven!  well for 2 hours.  yes thats right 2 hours...i enjoyed my walks.  cept for the old ladies in bikinis.  oh man that was nasty!  YUCK!  yes well needless to say i didnt really just love my vacation.  it was more of takin my family (which already stresses me out...cept for Karin) and puttin them into a smaller space.  oh yes lemme tell ya it was just peachy.  i need a vacation from my "vacation".  aw well.  at least i have my piano again!  i've been makin up my own Canon in D.  i just listen to different parts from different versions and put 'em together.  its lovely.  i think i shall be off to bed in a bit.  im runnin on caffeine.  i think thats how you spell it.  and Marbles is outside.  she better come back before i go to bed otherwise she'll be havin a camp out.  aw well.  she deserves it.  she played me!  she was all nice a sweet and we loved eachother and then she just ditches me!  now she sleeps in Erik's bed!  i was just one of those one night stand things...that was actually more than one night but thats besides the point!  its ok.  we still make out occasionally hehehehe!  ok enough bout my personal life!  GOODNIGHT EVERYONE!

       im so tired beyond belief.  man.  im exhausted.  i tried to take a nap earlier but that didnt work to well.  i can barely sleep at night let alone during the day.  goodness.  talk about emotionally strained.  yanno emotions can really be a pain sometimes.  they really can screw you up.  emotions are really kinda cool.  they're just feelings but look at how much they affect us.  somethin happens and we can get mad and that anger will drive our actions.  or somethin terrible happens and we get sad.  and that sadness will just bring ya down.  or maybe someone tells a joke or somethin just awesome happens and nothin can ruin the happiness you feel that day.  thats just amazing how emotions can take us to the highest peaks and deepest depths of life.  sometimes i hate it.  cuz i hate feeling that im not in control of what is happenin around me or not in control of my feelings.  ha! unfortunately i let my emotions affect me too much.  i guess it can be a good thing but lately i think its been bad.  im feeling so much right now.  frustration.  anger.  fear.  confusion.  desperation.  and all of it is just really stressin me out.  blah.  im falling apart...piece by piece...note by note.

       hmmm...well today is thursday.  yep.  sho is.  pretty boring.  choir was awful this morning.  i couldnt sing crap.  i got all this congestion ((betcha really wanted to know about that)) and i can barely squeak out the notes.  we did absolutely nothin in health.  we all had to go down to the gym and sit on the bleachers for a fabulous 96 minutes.  oh yes it was just loads of fun.  so what did kris do...?  well i put together this silly research paper folder thing for mrs yarbrough and then i slept.  sorta.  i "rested".  history we took a ton of notes.  b-o-r-i-n-g!  yarbrough just made us go to the library to work on our paper.  thats bout the most fun i had that day.  lol!  Veronica, L, and i sat at a table and talked bout OCD!  aww man it was funny!  and then on the way back we pretended like we had OCD and we couldnt walk on the lines in the floor and if we did we had to go back!  oh man!  lol...we would some pretty stupid OCD people!  hehehe!  lets see...then after school there was a rehearsal for our Orlando trip/competition.  ha.  it was nice to have a decent guy section that could sing!  finally!  for once it didnt sound like i was singing by myself!  course im not really lookin forward to goin on the trip.  i dunno.  it doesnt sound like its gonna be that great....mainly cuz we have some musical theater "cliques" coming.  i know that sounds kinda negative...and yeah it probably is...most of the musical theater people are really nice...but there are a few that are really stuck up and think they're just sooooo cool.  it drives me nuts.  like i said...its only like a couple of them...not all of them.  but it bugs me...specially since some of them used to be my friends.  its so funny how quickly they forget you.  aww well.  it happens.  anyways...so im not really jumpin to go.  but hey might as well.  yes.  well.  im as confused as ever.  and im frustrated cuz im confused which is probably my fault which is probably what i deserve cuz im really stupid sometimes and half the time im a jerk and GRRRRRRRR!  ok.  yeah.  like i said im frustrated.  so im gonna go and do i dunno what...adieu...

       im feelin real frustrated.  i dunno.  maybe i should just give up.  i really dont want to.  but yanno how when you try so hard to do somethin and then after trying and trying you just get worn out.  im tired.  im worn out.  im tryin not to give up.  i cannot give up on what my heart tells me.  i need to pray.  man.  anxiety level is up again.  hasnt been like this in awhile.  but i cant complain.  anxiety comes and goes.  and i havent started havin chest pains or panic attacks yet so i'd say im actually handling my fatigue and frustration fairly well.  better than i would have a couple months ago.  i was just thinkin about that.  i've come a long way since before.  it hasnt even been a year since i was severly depressed and stressed out and i am so much better.  i am so thankful for that.  i hope those people that helped know that i am so thankful that i know them.  ha.  half of them probably dont even know that they helped.  yanno...sometimes just talkin to someone...just bout nothin at all...can really help them.  you dont know how much it means to a person when you notice them.  when you smile at them.  when you hug them.  just when you say hi to them.  i can still remember a few months ago when L said "hey kristopher" when i walked into church on that wednesday.  it was during the time when i was really depressed.  and you dont know how much that meant that she noticed me.  like Carissa said "you just dont know...".  i love Carissa.  she reminds me of myself.  she's such a good person.  it makes me sick when these bad things happen to good people.  well i've said a lot so im gonna go to bed.  i dont wanna go to school tomorrow.  ha.  what else is new.  well goodnight everyone.

       Days of Our Extraterrestrial Lives Written by Kari Doubleday  With regards to Kristpher Bjorkman   	Once upon a time, as the sun faded from sight on the planet Bronkitius, a knock on a stained, wooden door echoed into the coming night.  A squeak.  Silence.  Slowly, a small, blonde head peeked out of the slightly opened door.  A look of utter annoyance spread over the sapphire blue face of Daelix Smith.  She opened the door wider, but still continued to stand inside the house.   	 “What do you want, Hubo?”  she asked, not hiding the fact that she clearly did not what him on her doorstep.  “Please, Daelix, cant we just talk like civilized Quivos?”  he pleaded, not wanting to give up.  One of Daelix’s five hands lifted and slapped Hubo’s ugly green face, leaving a purple imprint of a three fingered hand.    “WHY DID I DESERVE THAT?!”  he asked in utter rage.    “Oh, you thought that I wouldn’t find out about you and VIRDE, did ya?  Oh yes, mister, I found out that you two slept together and that your carrying her baby!”  she shouted and the proceeded to slam the door in his face.  Hubo shouted a few choice words at the closed door, and the stormed off down the street.  Daelix, on the other hand, walked calmly into her bedroom, where her own lover was laying.  “You tell him, girlfriend!”  he said, an impish grin on his handsome face.  Daelix sat down on the bed, they kissed, and well, night came.  The sun crept up the ever so slightly opened window.  Daelix and her lover took no notice.  Around midday, Daelix awoke, took a shower, got dressed, and went to the kitchen to make coffee.  A torn piece of paper lay on the counter.  Written in pink ink stated that Daelix’s lover had gone back to his house so his wife wouldn’t be suspicious.  Also written were words of romance that one other than Daelix herself would not want to read.  As Daelix went to sit down on the couch and watch her favorite soap opera, there was a crash through the skylight and glass shattered all around her.  A man dressed in a black cape put a sock in Daelix’s mouth and a mask over her eyes.  Too much was happening at once, therefore causing her to faint.  The sun went down again on planet Bronkitius, but Daelix did not know for she was on a space shuttle headed for the deep depths of space (dun dun dun).  As the confusing cleared from Daelix’s mind, a face appeared in front of her.  “You thought you could hide from me, Daelix Smith.  I think not!  You are now in my grasp and the entire world will obey my every command! Well, once we get to Caladone!”  an evil laugh rose from the creature.     “Who are you, sir?” she asked, afraid for her life.   “Oh of course! I always forget introductions!  My name is Verboosta, the evil villain that you always hear about that always ends up losing with the hero, but no this time! NO NOT THIS TIME! I will prevail!” an exotic gleam rose in one of his fifteen eyes.   Daelix sat in wonder, contemplating on what she should do next.  There was no one to save her now.  She was somewhere unknown to her.  A lively tune played over the intercom, singing “Lost in Outer Space,” and sung by the famous Christoph Clar.  Daelix banged her head against the wall, trying to block out the sound.  The door then sprung open and the most unlikely person came into the room.  It was none other than HUBO!  Daelix’s jaw went down upon seeing her ex.  She noticed the faint colour of a bruise across his face, although he had tried hiding it with some green paint, which he failed miserably at.  Trying to put two and two together, all Daelix could muster was a few incomprehensible words.  “Yes, Daelix, my dear, it is me.  I tried to warn you that Verboosta was after you, but no, you just wouldn’t listen.  I can stay here and rescue you, saving the universe from utter destruction, or perhaps I can just leave you here to be ruled by Verboosta.”  Hubo nodded toward Verboosta.  A look on Verboosta’s face showed no shock.  He stepped out of the corner, with a twinge of laugher on his face.  “Ahh, Hubo! You too, I see.  Finally, I can have the whole family here at last.  Well, except for your mother, God rest her soul.  You have met your sister, Daelix, I presume on that planet you have both been dwelling,  Bronkitius, I believe it was called.”   Disguest spread over Daelix and Hubo’s faces.  They looked at eachother, then at Verboosta, then toward the painting of the glamorous Quivo woman hanging above the fireplace, and then back at eachother.    “Family?  Us?  What? Are you trying to tell me that HE is my brother, and that you…you are my…father?”  Daelix managed to get out of her shaking lips.   “Why yes, of course we are family! Sorry I couldn’t get to you sooner, but you know how it is, blowing up planets here, blowing up planets there.  Hard work being a villain.”  Verboosta said like it was the obvious thing.  He looked once more at his two children, and then left the room.  Daelix and Hubo shivered at the thought of them being siblings.  They had been a little too close that what brother and sister should be.    “I think I’m going to be sick.” Cried Daelix.  She ran into the bathroom and vomited.   “Me too.” Hubo agreed.  He too ran to the other bathroom.  Many minutes passed before they both came out of the bathrooms, feeling a little better than before.  They made there way to the control room where there father was conducting his evil master plan.    “Well, kids, we are planning on resurrecting your dead mother.  It should work now that I have you two!”  he turned back to his controls and continued working.  Daelix and Hubo shrugged their shoulders and went for some coffee.

       it is now but a memory.  a memory that has passed...and yet it still lives.  alive only in me.  a haunting reminder of what was almost to be.  an undying memento that i loathe.  it will forever breathe within me and though i try to forget...it will never leave.  never will i forget the agony of the pain.  nor the silent tears that fell.  nor the desperate cries for help in the shadows of the night.  never will i forget the despair of a desperate heart.  nor the cruel menace of a hopeless soul.  i shall never forget my crimson desire.  yet this strife was not in vain.  for through this trial i have felt the solace of my Lord.  the unending peace that He freely gives.  and though i know that i will fall...i can forever trust that He will always catch me.  and through the fires and the storms i may know that my everlasting Sanctuary will not forsake me.  for when i am weary with sorrow...He will give me rest.  and when i am weaping with anguish...He will wash away my every tear.  and when i slip into the the darkest depths of grief...He will raise me up.  and so in silence i will relive my memories of hopelessness.  in the quiet of the night i will still cry.  but they will not be tears shed in despair.  instead they will be tears shed in joy.  tears of hope.  and faith will see me through...and i will live to hear His symphony everyday.  His symphony entitled Life.  and i will not regret...i will breathe each day remembering...my tear-filled requiem...

       today has been ok.  nothin really great.  but nothin really bad so i cant complain.  i said the other day that i wanted to talk about some stuff.  i guess now's as good a time as any.  the retreat was absolutely wonderful...but it brought back memories.  one of my friends...someone who i really care about had been...hurting himself secretly.  i wont name him.  but he had been cutting himself.  and he showed me.  he was upset about it and he really regretted doing it.  but seein that just brought back so many terrible memories.  and i cried when i could find a place to be alone.  i dunno.  just seein cuts on someone's arms...i mean he wasnt trying to kill himself at all...but it just reminded me of what i almost did such a long time ago.  its scary.  i mean so many people have asked "how could someone ever want to kill themselves?"...most of them dont know that sitting right across from them is me.  trust me.  they dont wanna understand how.  i wish that i didnt know what it felt like.  i mean i dont feel that way anymore...but the memory of that hopelessness is still there.  i have you ever thought about hopelessness.  to have no hope.  its the most terrible feelings ever.  to not have any dreams.  no desire.  nothing.  as far as i am concerned there is nothing worse.  im done.  i dont wanna talk about this anymore.  not in the mood.  i've been in a really good mood lately.  no sense in ruining it.  well i think ill be off to bed.  bon soir.

       Between the Plaque By Kari Doubleday With Regards to Kristopher Bjorkman February 8, 2004    	The note under the pillow stated:  UNDER PENALTY OF LAW THIS TAG NOT TO BE REMOVED EXCEPT BY THE CONSUMER  The fairy’s wings fluttered slightly in confusion.  Humm, she thought, for some reason, I don’t think this is the note.  Henrietta flew back under the pillow.  Finally, she found the rather large piece of paper folded around a small wooden box.  Well, small wouldn’t exactly be the words Henrietta would describe it.  Only being two and a half inches high, the box was about the size she was.  Sighing softly, she took out her wand and said a few words.  The box and the paper shrank to a size where she could pick them both up easily.  After prying them out of the young boy’s fingers, Henrietta read what was written on the paper:  Dear Mis Toof-farie, i lost mi first toof today.  mommy told me to put it uder mi pello.  she too said dat u wood gime a dime! THANK U, TOOF FARIE! wif luv, Billy  Awe, how sweet!  Henrietta whispered softly.  The little boy’s hair slid gently over his sleeping face.  What a cute little kid!  Being the tooth fairy and all, Henrietta often got letters similar to Billy’s.  They were no big surprise, and yet, each time, she wrote back.  Henrietta drew out her small pencil and paper.  Being careful to use words he would understand she began to write.  She wrote a brief reply and placed it under his pillow.  Next, Henrietta opened the small wooden box and swapped the tooth with a shiny dime, as promised.  Well, I guess I’m done here, she thought.  With a light kiss on the cheek, the fairy disappeared into the night.    Henrietta traveled back to her home at Pearly White Estates.  It was where all tooth fairies lived.  She flew up to her one bedroom apartment and opened the door using the star at the end of her wand as a key.  Once inside, Henrietta let out another soft sigh, took out the many wrinkled pieces of paper consisting of misspelled words and random drawings of fairies and put them in her “Letter Trunk.”  It was already getting rather full of the children’s notes, but she didn’t care.  They were what made her job bearable.  A loud knock thundered, knocking Henrietta out of her thoughts.  When she opened the door, a fairy dashed in.  Agnus, again.  “Hey, Henny! How was your night?  Mine was great! I can’t believe I’ve been a tooth fairy for almost a week! It’s so amazing! I couldn’t imagine a better job than this in the world!  One kid even wrote me a letter! TO ME! Can you believe it?! Oh, also, Victor is mad at you.  He was rambling something about you not bringing in the teeth right away.  You may want to go and talk to him.  Henny?”  “Yes, Angus.  I’ll go talk to Victor.  I’m glad you’ve had a good week.”  Henrietta sighed.  Poor Angus.  He didn’t understand how boring the rest of his life was going to be: going out every night, gathering teeth, and coming home again.  At least the Cavity Council was considering changing the job rotations to every other day, due to the immediate interest in Tooth Fairying jobs.  “Okay Henny. Guess what?! I’ve thought up a new name for us Tooth Fairys!  Take a guess!”  Angus spoke so fast that it was hard for even Henrietta to understand him some of the time.    “I don’t know Angus.  Why don’t you tell me?”  “THE MOLARINATOR!”  he cried excitedly.   “Yeah, Angus.  You should really bring that up to Victor next time you see him.  I’m sure he’d love it!”  Henrietta laughed to herself.  Victor, the Vice President fairy of the Cavity Council had no sense of humor at all.  He also had no respect for new innovations that the Council proposed.    “Wow, you really think so?”  Angus asked, a look of confusing spread across his face.  Before Henrietta could reply that she was joking, a bell rang throughout the Estate.  “What’s that?”  Angus whispered.  “I don’t know.  We had better go find out.”  Henrietta answered worriedly.  They don’t usually sound the bell unless something dreadfully bad has happened, she thought.  The two fairies flew down to the square where everyone was gathered, all confused.  Victor wavered above them, speaking in a loud voice.  “Quiet everyone.  What has happened here today has taken us by complete and total astonishment.  Never before has any fairy had the nerve to contradict the Council’s power.  I will promise you all, that he will be punished in the strictest matter possible.”  “What happened, Victor?”  a voice spoke up.  “Well, to be completely honest, I don’t know what the motivation of the crime was, nor do I know how long it has been going on. I ---”  “Geez, man! Just tell us!”  A fairy yelled, with many others around him nodding in agreement.  “Okay okay!  Everyone here is aware of Marcus, right?”  Victor asked the people.  Marcus was a fairy that every other fairy knows.  You couldn’t miss him.  He was always getting into trouble somewhere, somehow.  “He has been caught selling teeth on the Plaque Market.”  Victor told the group.  Dead silence.  So many questions were running through Henrietta’s mind, and yet the most important one was what where they going to do?  “The D.L.E. will be sent out to capture Marcus and his team before they can sell anymore teeth.  We will need everyone’s help.  Half of you will work double shifts to ensure that the world of children will not know of our crisis.  The other half will be split into groups to help resolve this.  I need two volunteers to go with the D.L.E.  Anyone?”  Victor waited as the group soaked in the information.  Angus raised his hand high.  He was willing to go with the D.L.E ((Dental Law Enforcement)).    Henrietta thought for a few seconds.  If Angus can do it, so can I! Anyway, he’ll need me along.   She raised her hand.  Victor said a few more words and then motioned Henrietta and Angus to follow him into Colgate Hall.  After the group was settled in to a conference room, and many more people joined them, the meeting started.  “Now, you two are going to be joining a group of the elite D.L.E. forces.  You will be led by Agent Kristo.  He will give you a briefing in private with the other D.L.E.’s.  Good Luck!”  Victor along with the other fairies left the room.  Dressed in a black tuxedo, Agent Kristo stepped into the room as the last fairy left.  He gave a small nod to Angus and Henrietta, and then sat down at the end of the long table.  Several other fairies, all dressed in black, filed into the room and sat at the table as if they knew exactly what they were doing.  When everyone was seated, Kristo made a small cough, and spoke.  “Well, we are all here.  Let us begin.”  And so it began.  The most perilous and daring adventure two simple Tooth Fairies undertook.  Well, Henrietta thought, maybe being a Tooth Fairy wasn’t such a bad idea after all.

       Five For Fighting's "100 Years".  its an absolutely awesome song!  i love the piano.  makes me cry.  great song!  I'm 15 for a moment  Caught in between 10 and 20  And I'm just dreaming  Counting the ways to where you are  I'm 22 for a moment  She feels better than ever  And we're on fire  Making our way back from Mars  15 there's still time for you  Time to buy and time to lose  15, there's never a wish better than this  When you only got 100 years to live  I'm 33 for a moment  Still the man, but you see I'm a they  A kid on the way  A family on my mind  I'm 45 for a moment  The sea is high  And I'm heading into a crisis  Chasing the years of my life  15 there's still time for you  Time to buy, Time to lose yourself  Within a morning star  15 I'm all right with you  15, there's never a wish better than this  When you only got 100 years to live  Half time goes by  Suddenly you're wise  Another blink of an eye  67 is gone  The sun is getting high  We're moving on...  I'm 99 for a moment  Dying for just another moment  And I'm just dreaming  Counting the ways to where you are  15 there's still time for you  22 I feel her too  33 you're on your way  Every day's a new day...  15 there's still time for you  Time to buy and time to choose  Hey 15, there's never a wish better than this  When you only got 100 years to live

       ok so here it is.  this the plan that tenea (and i added some parts) came up with so that we can live happily ever after.  ok.  this is what happens.  tenea and i go to an Aerosmith concert with backstage passes.  Then we meet Stephen Tyler, the lead singer.  Then we tell him that I'm interested in his daughter, Liv Tyler (the hott elf from LOTR!).  and then when i do Stephen will say "RIGHT ON!" and then he'll pay for our plane tickets to go see her.  and when she sees me she'll be like "oh kristopher!" and I'll be like "yeah i think we should go out babe" and she'll be like "of course" and then I'll be like "hey babe we gotta hook tenea up with Orlando!" (Orlando Bloom).  and then Liv will be like "oh i have to call him tonight!  i've finally found the perfect person for him!"  and she'll call him and he'll be like "omgosh! i have to meet her!" and then Tenea will go fly to him and marry him and they'll live happily ever after!  as for kristopher...well he'll marry Liv Tyler and they're gonna live happily ever after.  and everynight Kelly Clarkson will sing songs to them cuz her voice is awesome and then Alicia Keys will play the piano and recite poetry cuz i love the way she talks and then Norah Jones will wake them up with her soothingly wonderful voice.  and life will be perfect.  WELL THATS THE PLAN!  isnt it great!  WELL OK I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA!  it made my day just a little better!

       well i went to piano lessons last night.  i was really excited.  i had a new song i wanted some help with learning.  well i get there and show her the piece i wanna learn and she said she wouldnt help me out cuz its above my level.  and she was all like "i have to teach the theory before i can teach you that" and i was just thinkin  i have learned every freakin' bit of theory you have ever taught me .  so now what am i learning, besides my practive book?  FUR ELISE!  what the crap is up with that.  fur elise is like so much harder than the song i wanted to learn!  its such a bunch of crap.  and then she was all like oh you're so much better than i was when i was a senior and you're only a sophmore.  the way you can learn music is incredible cuz you do it by ear and you're so much more gifted and blah blah. but i have to teach you the theory."  BUT SHE ALREADY HAS!  now yeah i dont know everything. but i know what she's taught me so far.  and half of that i learned in choir before she taught me.  grrr...it just makes me so mad!  so im just trying to learn the song on my own.  without her help.  it's My Heart Will Go On.  i can play the beginning.  which i think is pretty good.  course i am doing it by ear but she wont teach it to me the right way so what choice do i have?  goodness!  im so ticked.  im gonna go play this song.  adieu.

       life.  what a long journey it has been so far.  and to think...its only starting.  life is so amazing.  we go so many places.  so many avenues.  we meet so many people.  we form so many friendships.  many that last a life time.  we touch eachother's hearts.  and yet there are so many friends that we never see again.  so many that were so dear to us.  each person we meet...each friend we make.  we affect their lives.  we leave with them a piece of ourselves.  that they will carry until they die.  what pieces are we giving them?  the good...or the bad?

       i woke up this morning with a smile on my face...and nobody's gonna bring me down today...been feeling like nothings been going my way lately...so i decided right here and now that my outlooks gotta change...that's why i'm gonna say goodbye to all the tears i've cried...for everytime somebody hurt my pride...feeling like they won't let me live life...and take the time to look at what is mine...i see every lesson completely...i thank God for what i got from above...i believe they can take anything from me...but they can't succeed in taking my inner peace...they can say all they wanna say about me...but i'm gonna carry on...keep on singing my song.......i never wanna dwell on my pain again...there's no use in reliving how i hurt back then...remembering all of the hell i felt when i was running out of faith...every step i vowed to take was towards a better day...cuz i'm about to...say goodbye to every single lie...and all the fears i've held too long inside...everytime i felt i could try...all the negativity i had inside...for too long i've been struggling...i couldn't go on...but now i've found i'm feeling strong and moving on...i believe they can take anything from me...but they can't succeed in taking my inner peace...they can say all they wanna say about me...but i'm gonna carry on...i'm gonna keep on singing my song......

       im over it.  ha.  that simple.  those feelings are hidden away...and hopefully they will stay that way.  i said i was stronger now...and i am.  i can move on.  ((i have moved on very well...WINK WINK! LOL!))  i dont have to be upset.  i know it will be ok.  so i didnt get what i wanted...its ok.  maybe what i wanted wasnt right for me.  you dont have to wait for me.  i understand.  but i will still be here, as i always have been, for when you need a friend.  goodnight, dearest friend.

       i wanted to believe you were worth it.  you were all that i wanted.  but i guess it just wasnt meant to be.  i dont understand why.  i never did.  not at first and not now.  and i guess thats the worst thing.  i want to be able to let go.  to move on.  but my heart needs answers.  i have to know why.  what is wrong with me?  and if you cannot give that to me...then i understand.  but you must understand that it will never be the same.  i will never be the same.  you have slowly lost all your comprehension of me.  you can no longer read my like an open book.  because you closed it before it was done being written.  the boy you once knew is gone.  i am not the sad pathetic scared person i was before.  i am stronger now.  and wiser now.  i so want you to know the real me...the me now.  not the me you once knew.  the me that is not hidden by anxiety or depression.  i will try to be what you want me to be.  i will try and give you what i have always given you...me.  the friend.  i need time.  please...wait for me...

       i'll make you smile.  i'll make you laugh.  i will give you the joy of life.  i'll show hope.  i'll make you believe.  i will dream your dreams.  i'll hold you when you cry.  i'll raise you up when you are down.  i will love you.  and then i will crush the last of your humanity from existance and leave but a broken shell of what you once were.  i will be your reason to cry.  and all that i will leave you is this...my requiem of anguish.

       im so extremely tired.  i should go to sleep...but i dont think that it will help.  im watchin this show bout Princess Diana.  its soooo sad.  she was such a beautiful person.  a beautiful person who was misunderstood and lived a depressed, upseting life.  its such a shame.  she could have been so much more.  she had so much more she could have given to the world...had she lived.  my gosh.  "I like to draw out the darker parts of people."  she said that.  Princess Diana said that.  its almost frightening...the similarities.  it is something that is fascinating...the darker, deeper parts of people.  the parts that no one will show  you.  the parts they dont want you to see.  the parts that define what you are.  if could have anything in the world...i would have the gift and curse of seeing those dark depths of people's souls.  and i wish i could show people me.  the real me.  underneath everything.  i think only one person still knows me.  and slowly...slowly she is losing her understanding.  its kinda sad knowing that it is dieing.  but everything must come to an end.  someday ill let someone else read me like an open book.  but for now ill just keep me tucked away.  dunno why.  no point in lettin it all hang out.  im not the kinda person who just lets everything out...i have to trust before i share.  well yeah.  i really miss talkin to someone i trust.  not that i dont trust anyone.  thats not true i do trust people.  but only in a certain way.  only to an extent.  my trust has been violated too many times to trust people completely.  show me your darkest part...then i will trust you.

       for so long now you have captivated me.  for so long my thoughts have lingered on you.  the memories of what once was still live within me.  the memories that i relive over and over again.  the dreams of what i could have.  there are times when i wish that i could stay in those dreams...forever.  where my soul is at peace and nothing can harm me.  where i am safe...and not alone.  i have searched...and there have been others...yet my heart could never let go.  and though i have been crushed so many times...i still cannot let go.  and so now all i have left are the memories and the dreams.  haunting shadows of hope.  tormenting me with every glance...with every laugh...every smile...and every tear.  welcome to my haunting requiem.

A real friend tells you to get over your selfish pettiness and get on with your life.

       well... its a wonderfully overcast friday afternoon.  nobody is online.  no one to talk to.  i was hoping i'd have some alone time tonight but no... Erik &amp; Dad's little camping trip got cancelled so they're gonna be home... so much for some nice quiet time.  i am VERY disappointed.  but whatever.  im not really in the best of moods.  man i wish their thing hadnt been cancelled.  that sounds terrible i know.  but i really need some time where this no NOISE!  and they are the main people that cause noise and just get on my nerves!  yeah.  well the past 2 days have just flown by.  i really cant even remember what has gone on.  i am so upset with where i am in life at the moment its not even funny.  i never thought i'd feel this way again.  i thought i was stronger since the last time.  just goes to show you how weak people really are.  i am a perfect example.  torn apart by emotions, rebuilt by logic, and now destroyed again by passion.  its amazing how the mind works.  how your feelings can affect you so greatly.  ha... whats really amazing is how powerless i feel when it comes to my emotions.  blah.  ya anyways.  im spilling too much.  we shall save the rest for another time.  for now its out to eat.  au revoir...

       my darling "milkshake" wrote this for me... she's so great... she's an amazing friend and i love her to death...   I know you can't feel and it hurts inside and all you can do is sit back and cry but when you least expect it she'll be there for you standing right by your side and you wont have to hide anymore Cause the pain leaves when the love's around and what is lost will soon be found You just gotta stand strong and believe that one day, one day she will see.

       just let me cry... i have nothing left to do.  no where to turn.  i dont know what to do other than cry.  gosh i love the Canon in D.  i cant even describe to you how it makes me feel.  especially now.  i am so pathetic.  i am so hopeless.  so pathetic.  I FEEL SO ALONE!  i have felt alone for so so so so long.  i cant even remember the last time i felt... content?  i guess thats what im lookin for.  i guess happiness too in a way.  i want love.  i want it so bad.  i am depressed.  i can feel it all again.  ha... its all to familiar now.  in away it does feel different.  i feel stronger than i was before.  i can still stand.  but at the same time i feel so weak.  i havent felt this sad in such a long time.  i cant freakin cry like i need to cuz my mom is sittin here.  i wish she'd go away.  i want to be alone... its better to be alone and feel alone then to feel alone and yet still have people around you.  i guess it makes it less frustrating.  goodness... i am having such a hard time even tryin to describe how i feel.  i just cant stop crying.  i want so bad to be held.  i want so bad to be different.  i want support.  i want to feel loved again.  i want to trust someone.  i want to feel special.  right now all i feel is... nothing.  God, please just let me cry... hold me...

       i long for her stare.  so much.  i just want her to see me.  just to notice me standing there.  i wish i could be somethin to her.  i wish i was more than just a friend.  i am so sick of being just a friend.  to everyone.  thats all i am.  i dont mind of course... i love being friendly... but then when i like someone its always someone that i am friends with.  and what happens.  im ignored.  not cuz anyone is tryin to be mean... but i guess there is some "rule" that if your friends  you guys cant go out.  its so freakin stupid.  i WILL NOT go out with anyone who is not my friend first.  grrrrrr!  anyways.  im rambling and probably not makin sense.  in the words of Trey, "i know what im talkin about and thats all that matters!"

       is she worth all the pain?  is she worth all the lies?  is she worth all the tears?  is she worth all the cries?  is she really worth... all of this?  you must answer for yourself.  feelings...?  are they really feelings or just desperate attempts to justify your hopes?  you are young.  your emotions are still so fragile.  like mine once were.  i know what you feel.  i know the frustration and the desperation.  you have to learn to let go.  though you feel it is right... you must realize that it is not.  it is not worth your heart.  you deserve better.  let go.  just walk away...

       its been 2 years... since everything started.  so much has changed.  so much has happened to me... good and bad.  so many choices... so many dreams.  i still cant believe how far i have come.  and i remind myself of how far i have left to go.  but even now... through all the storms.... these questions remain in my head... was it worth it my darling...?  all of this...?  could i have made this easier for you...?  could i have made it easier for myself...?  did i have to sarcrafice my most precious possession to ease my weary soul...?  was it worth losing you...?  these questions have haunted me for so long and continue to haunt me.  but one haunts me more than any other: will i ever have the answers...?

       well i had an AWESOME time this morning at our Choir Pancake Breakfast!  it was absolutely crazy and i loved it!  it was great!  oh yes.  i so wanna do it again!  hahaha!  course wakin up at 6am isnt exactly the best thing bout it but it was worth it.  hmmmm... dunno really what to talk about.  church tomorrow.  i love church.  especially singing.  oh and im gettin good at playin You Raise Me Up.  some of the chords are kind hard to hit quickly but more practice will fix that.  yeah.  i love that song.  anyways.  not really feeling that much better emotionally.  right now jokin around with James is keepin me from thinkin about it.  anyways.  im gonna go.  goodbye.

       lets see.  today...?  ummmm... i dont really know what's been happenin today.  nothin really spectacular.  im feeling very strange at the moment.  i love night time... its like when i feel the most alive.  the most... calm i guess.  at ease.  but there are times when it is the most lonely time in the world for me.  like right now.  i just... i dunno.  i feel so so so sad.  i really shouldnt cuz i have nothin to really be sad about... maybe to be frustrated about but not sad.  yeah.  its so hard to explain.  i dont really want to just unload since i dont know exactly who reads this.  BUT I WANT TO SCREAM IT ALL OUT!  i hate having stuff locked up inside me... but it helps when you know how to let that stuff out in an appropriate way.  knowing me i'd probably just get everything off my chest and then realize that i didnt wanna say all of it.  speaking of my chest!  i've been havin some chest pain lately.  but what else is new.  it actually did go away for a long time.  but then i guess i let its slowly creep back.  its rather annoying but at least i havent started having panic attacks and anxiety attacks again so im not gonna complain.  anyways.  i think im just gonna post and then go wallow.  goodnight.

       oh goodness im so confused.  my little secret is slowly spreading.  i dont like it.  i dont like people talkin bout me and my little crush behind my back.  its bothering me.  and i dont like that L is avoiding this subject with me.  i mean... i know why... she's too closely connected.  but she's like my best friend... well one of them... and i talk to her about everything and now i really cant cuz she wont.  i dunno what to do.  or where to turn.  not that i dont have other friends or anything... just none that i trust as much as her.  I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!  and yanno what i really dont like... people tryin to "help me" or whatever.  i mean its nice at times and can be a good thing.  but when they start takin my life and my feelings into their own hands i dont like that.  i dont like feeling out of control.  GRRRRRRR!  i am VERY VERY frustrated!  bye.

         The Knife  by Davida Yarbrough   She ground the knife against the wall. Life was all in vain. She was sick of dreaming and hoping. She was tired of wishing and getting horror in return. Why could know one see that behind the happy child was a child shredded and ripped by the hands of life. She was afraid and alone. She was tired of trusting and then getting deeply hurt. With each flick of the knife the decision grew easier. Only a few would know she ws gone. Not many would care. Though the world did not revolve around her, her existence would not really effect many. No one would miss her in their life. So , she raised the knife for one last plunge.. for one last breath.   it scares me to think... it could have been me... one more moment... and all i would have had left was... one last breath... i love you Vida...

       well i had a pretty good day.  this mornin the choir sang for the 8th grader's parents.  oh yes.  tons of fun.  then we all changed and got on a bus to go to Florence to compete in some state festival thingy.  we did pretty good.  we got and "excellent" rating for our prepared pieces and then a "superior" for our sight-reading.  that cuz Mrs Rimes gives us a freakin sight-reading practice sheet every day!  we practically breath Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti and DO!  goodness!  ha!  but it was fun.  yeah then we got back to school at like 4:15 or so and i went home and had pizza for dinner.  then L picked me up and we went to church to get interviewed to go to Rainbow Omega.  we got to have our interview together!  woohoo!  two perfect people in one room!  goodness its tough.  ha!  some of those questions!  like the one where we had to brag about ourselves!  those were hard!  haha!  oh and Brandon said i couldnt wear any halter tops, spaghetti straps, short shorts, and nothin with Bud Light on the front!  darn!  there goes half my wardrobe!  lol.  jk!  well yeah.  then my day got wrecked by my mom's insensitivity.  first time i've ever seen my mom like that.  i usually expect it more from my dad.  as a matter of fact i always expect it from my dad.  but man.  she shocked me.  couldnt have come at worse time when im already sick of my family and just ticked at all of them.  this just reinforces that they dont understand... cuz i was just tryin to explain to my mom why i was so upset and she just got mad and tried to make it like this was all my fault and that i was a weak push-over and.... gosh.  im so not happy.  and next i have to go to Orlando with choir and my dad is goin too.  i wish he wouldnt.  i wish he would just leave me alone.  he does such a good job of ignoring me and my feelings most of the time it shouldnt be that hard.  but whatever.  and now i have what little trust i had in my mother is gone.  she proved tonight that she doesnt understand.  she's too... defensive to notice anything wrong with me.  to even see my unhappy.  i feel so pushed away.  i want so hard to talk to them... but everytime i try to drop a hint they automatically go into parent mode and just try to prove that its my fault.  i want to leave.  i want to go anywhere.  just away from them.  i need a distraction.  i dunno bout ******.   i have such a crush on her.  she's the cutest thing.  but she doesnt see me.  im just kristopher.  a friend.  i am always just a friend.  im so sick of it.  why do i have to just be kristopher?  why cant i be more?  what have i done wrong?  i cant figure it out.  i am so freakin stressed out.  this is one of those times where i wished i had said yes to the pills.  maybe they could have helped me handle all this better.  i dunno.  i thought i had learned so much from the psychologist.  its so much harder to handle in real life.  but yeah.  im blabbing.  ill just pray.  for something.  anything.  bon soir....

       i realized my biggest mistake in my relationships.  it kinda just came to me the other night when i was talkin to L.  we were talkin bout my family and how i dont feel... well how she really isnt a huggy person and i am.  and how i live in a very not huggy family... and it bothers me.  i dont like it... but i cant really change that... its just the way they are.  but yeah.  its weird... i like to FEEL love.  yanno.  like physically.  it like helps support the mental emotion.  i know its weird.  goodness you dont have to remind me.  but i realized what my biggest mistake was in my relationships... well mainly with Kari.  not so much Mal.  i couldnt help that one.  that was her choice.  but with Kari.  i was young and stupid.  i let my emotions take too much control.  i became too attached.  i've realized that i look for the love that i cant find at home in my relationships with other people.  that was my biggest mistake.  i expected too much.  i still do.  im trying sooo hard right now to fix that.  its hard though sometimes.  i dont feel... well ok i do feel loved.  i know people love me.  but... i just dont FEEL it.  are ya gettin me here?  maybe just a little?  yeah ok... i think i've just totally confused you guys.  i think im just gonna shut up now and go and wallow.  bon soir...

       hey.  i have nothing to say.  lol.  here's a first.  nothin really.  i've been too busy worrying bout my friend's problems to even notice mine.  i kinda like bein able to forget my problems...even if it is just for awhile.  well i cant say i actually forget.  i just get occupied with other things.  i've still been rather bothered.  i dunno why i put myself through this.  its actually rather stupid.  but yeah.  i guess i really hope these problems are worth it.  i think they are...but yeah.  lol.  i use that "but yeah" phrase alot.  i am trying so hard to not be sad about all this crap in my life right now.  its really hard.  i have to be so careful.  i can feel it again.  i can feel it trying to pull me down.  it is so heavy.  all this stuff.  i am weak.  not like i used to be.  every since that night...when i almost took my life.  i have never been the same person.  everyday has been a fight.  a battle to not let that control me again.  that was the most frightening time of my life.  can you imagine what it feels like to have no hope?  to think that you will never be better.  that you will never be able to fight back at depression.  i know now that you can never be the same again...but i know that you can be better.  i refuse to let that overcome me again.  i dont care what it takes.  but i am not going down.  i am not giving up.

       well i signed up for an interview to go to Rainbow Omega with church.  i gave into some serious "peer pressure" from Ellen.  ha.  she made me go.  actually her interview is right after mine.  maybe she can pick me up and we can go together...hint hint L!  yeah.  it should be fun.  and its away from my parents and Erik.  ok maybe thats kinda mean.  but whatever.  yeah.  we have to sing the National Anthem for the 8th graders comin to tour the school.  gonna be great.  it sounds really good.  but Rimes said she might make us wear our tuxedos and dresses.  i really hope she doesnt.  i just wanna wear all black.  its alot easier and A LOT more comfortable.  yeah.  she didnt say anything to me tonight.  i feel so invisible.  maybe its not worth it.  i dunno.  im so just blah.  lol.  in the words of L: "i'm just mad, sad, happy, and just stooopid!"  hehehe!  she's such a spaz.  ha.  ok well now is my time to go crawl up into my corner.  so im pressing the post button....

       today has been very....boring.  yeah.  i was like running on autopilot the whole day.  so...yeah.  i dont feel any better.  but i dont feel any lonelier either so i guess i cant complain.  ****** is frustrating me.  its almost like she's ignoring me.  i think im imagining it.  she kinda signed off on AIM when i was talkin to her.  she probably just had to go.  i dunno.  ha.  i have this tendency to overreact and think somethin's really wrong and it ends up bein nothin.  yeah.  i need to work on that.  probably help with my anxiety level.  but whatever.  im feeling so very lost right now.  i dunno where to turn or where to go.  i hope God has got somethin planned.  and i hope i'm so blind that i miss it.  this is another one of those times when that little thing God does would be great.  yanno...when he makes it all ok.

       a lone grand piano stood in the center of the stage.  all the lights fell upon it.  it was a beautiful sight for him.  almost as beautiful as she was, her head resting on his shoulder.  they sat their together, holding hands, in the empty hall.  he kissed her lightly on the forehead.  he rises from his seat, leaving her to wonder where he has gone.  he approaches the stage and takes his seat at the piano.  there he plays the song that defines him.  the song that conveys every emotion he has ever felt.  the Canon in D major.  and as he sits their playing he glances to see his lovely darling smiling at him from her seat.  a single tear falls, landing on one of the ivory keys of the piano.  never had he felt such comfort.  never had he felt so safe.  never had he been so happy.  all he could ever want...captured in this single moment.  he never wanted it to leave.  he wished so bad to be able to capture this moment in a song.  and he realized that he had always had this moment.  it was in the Canon that he was playing now.  it would always be there.  it was the music of his life.  the music that had brought him from the depths of an earthly hell to the heights of heaven.  it was his music.  and this was his moment.  his dream in D major.

       i dont know why im writing in this thing.  i really dont feel like it but i have nothing better to do.  im extremely stressed out with a ton of things.  i dont know who to talk to.  my parents are too busy being "parents" to listen.  others are mad at me.  others just cant understand.  others dont care.  my piano lessons suck.  my mom is mad at me cuz i dont like to play outta the silly piano book.  i'd rather play somethin i ENJOY to play.  i dont want to not enjoy playin piano.  and being forced to play these boring songs and getting people mad at me when i dont makes me hate to play.  i dunno.  im rambling.  none of this is really important.  i just hate...i regret so much in my life.  i wish things where different.  i wish my dad was different.  i wish he was more like me.  i wish we shared more interests together.  i wish my mom would stop being such an instructor and try listening for once.  i wish they would ask if they thought something is wrong.  i wish my parents knew me.  they cant see it now.  they cant see me hurting.  maybe they dont wanna, maybe they dont care, maybe they just dont know what to do.  i wish i had been a better friend to so many people.  i wish i hadnt even thought about killing myself.  i wish i wasnt the way i am.  i dunno.  maybe i would be happier.  maybe people could be happier with me.  maybe i wouldnt be such a disappointment.  all i want is to be happy.  and i try so hard to find somethin that makes me happy and eventually all it does is let me down.  whether its a person or a hobby or an accomplishment.  something always goes wrong.  i think i always do something stupid that makes it go wrong.  no matter how hard i try.  something goes wrong.  i wish i had someone.  someone to support me.  someone that i could cry to now and would listen...and care.  someone to hug me now.  i've only known a few people who could do that for me.  and they have never been my parents which i know sounds terrible.  they arent bad.  but i think they spend so much time being parents that they forget that while they're teaching me how to live, i am having problems in my life.  and they dont see it.  they are so blind.  i've always envied people who have someone...anyone that they trust their lives with.  a friend maybe.  just someone.  i've always envied people who can talk to their parents bout anything.  who feel like their parents are their friends.  whose parents like the same things you like.  where you feel comforted in what you call your home.  i dont feel comforted in my home.  my home is a whole other set of problems.  more stress.  more hurt.  welcome home kristopher.  i want so bad to scream to them that im not happy in MY OWN HOUSE!  but what would they do?  nothing.  how do i know?  i've tried... i got nothing.  i dont know what to do.  ill admit it.  i am so so sad.  all i have is my piano...and now even me playing that is bad cuz im "not practicing the right music".  well here's news.  i play because it is one of the few things that makes me happy.  i mean.  if i were only allowed to take one thing from my house...it would be my Grandfather's piano.  because it gives something back to me.  it brings me comfort where no person could.  granted it can never take the place of a person...but it has helped me when people refuse not to.  i love that about instruments.  people can be mean.  but can an instrument be mean?  you play it and it makes a wonderful sound for you.  it wont hurt you.  i love my piano.  i love to hear it so much.  i love the notes.  the notes that compose my requiem of tears.

       im really in a bad pissed off mood right now.  its not cool at all.  im so stressed bout all this crap.   first there is the P department.  i've got my Dad who doesnt understand me at all, which he does try to a little but he just cant.  so yeah just bout everything he does is stressing me out.  course he has no clue cuz im too scared to speak up.  my mom, who usually understands me, has just been real moody.  i dont feel like talkin to her about anything.  erik is being his regular self, negative and an absolute jerk to be around.  karin is being her nice sweet little self.  she's the only one who never really makes me mad or stresses me out.  yeah.  well then there is the R department.  yeah.  thats a confusing one.  i like this girl, right?  and she doesnt know i do.  i dont really know how to...make it more obvious.  yeah and then there is this little connection ((person)) that her and i share that is kinda getting in the way.  which is actually my fault cuz im sorta scared of what this "connection" would think if she knew who this girl i like is.  so yeah.  yeah.  and then im not totally sure i like this girl.  i mean i do.  but its more like a crush...i guess.  grrr.  this is why everything is so confusing.  i dunno what to do.  im so overwhelmed.  my chest has started to ache a little.  man its been a long time since i've felt that.  im kinda scared that its coming back.  i think i can handle it though.  i hope.  anyways.  im gonna go now.  yeah.  not feeling too good.  adieu.

       i can still remember that night.  it is such a vivid memory i doubt i will ever forget.  i remember her calling me.  i was dreading whatever it was coming because i knew something was wrong.  and then she told me why she had called.  all i could do was start crying silently.  she wouldnt have known had i been able to control my voice.  but it was the sound of my voice that gave me away.  i can still here her gentle voice say, "Don't worry, Kris.  Everything is going to be ok."  she was gentle with me.  she knew that i needed to be held up during the hard times.  and even though we were not together...she held me that one last time.  she gently let me go.  like a mother putting her child to bed.  she put me to bed...and i cried myself to sleep.

       well except for the fact that we didnt have school this hasnt been a great day.  it's kinda sad...im starting to see a pattern.  ha.  i've been feeling really alone over here.  i miss everything!  everything i had!  its so frustrating to look back...cuz it was great back then.  now its just...blah.  i miss all the friends that used to be so close to me.  its so incredible how our lives change so quickly.  its incredible how my closest friends have drifted so far from me.  they are all doing great.  even Christina out in San Diego is doing good.  its me that has been left behind.  which is probably most definitely my fault.  but whatever.  anyways...im getting better at playing You Raise Me Up.  still needs alot more practice though.  yeah.  i think i shall go practice some more.  i've been spending ALOT of time on the piano lately.  guess i got nothin better to do.  alright well bye!

       i despise what i have become.  i despise what you have made me.  sometimes at night i myself to forget...yet in my heart i pray to always hold our bittersweet memories.  how stupid i was to trust.  how stupid i was to love.  how could i expect anything from you?  i do not blame you for you made your choice.  i only blame myself...for letting you break me.  for letting my walls come down.  i blame myself for not protecting you from my emotions.  for not protecting myself from my own emotions.  i wish i could go back and correct my error.  but i wish for so many things.  too many things.  all i can do is dream a silent requiem.  this requiem of a tortured heart.  my tortured heart.

       hello people.  i feel very tired at the moment.  i dont think its cuz im going to bed too late.  but i havent been sleeping very well lately.  well...i never really have...but this week has been especially bad.  i just cant go to sleep.  i just lie there forever.  im so glad that we have friday off.  hopefully ill sleep in.  you can never tell with me.  sometimes i wake up at 7am even during the summer.  just depends.  so yeah.  tomorrow.  last day of school this week.  rock on.  i cant wait to go to church tonight.  for numerous reasons.  to worship God OF COURSE.  thats a given but other than that...just to hang out.  i need some of that relief.  the few people that do i still trust go to church with me.  lets see...i think thats what...two?  i dunno.  i can trust most of the people there...just some i dont have the chance to.  its tough to talk to 60+ people in one night.  anyways.  lets see...anything else i wanna say?  hmmmmm...argh.  i feel so hopeless right now.  its extremely frustrating.  i have like no chance with her at all!  and it just makes me wanna scream!  GRRRRRR!  ok thank you.  i think im gonna go and practice You Raise Me Up some more.  adieu.

       im feeling quite lonely today.  maybe its the Alicia Keys' music im listening too but whatever.  yes today has been...peachy i guess.  just another boring day.  i feel kinda left out right now.  a WHOLE TON of my friends all have bf's or gf's.  i know it sounds really childish...but i think im jealous.  i guess its really cuz im frustrated with relationships at the moment.  ha.  i've had great relationships but in the end they've just disappointed me.  sometimes i wonder if it was all worth it.  i know that sounds terrible.  probably is.  i should be thankful...and i am.  i guess its just that...its just that i get hurt so easily.  each time it was terrible.  i dunno.  its like...i hardly even talk to my ex-girlfriends.  i mean i do talk to Kari more now.  but its not really "talk".  its just friendly chatting.  its really a shame cuz we used to be so close.  even before we started going out.  she knew everything about me.  i was like an open book to her.  and then Mallory.  i dont even talk to her at all.  just an occasional smile when we see eachother in the hallway.  and its not cuz im mad at either of them.  not at all.  its just...it still hurts.  alot.  and i even just seeing them makes everything hurt again.  i mean its alot easier to just hide it now then it used to be..but still i does hurt.  and thats not their fault and they shouldnt feel guilty or anything.  its my problem...not theirs.  its just i dont know how else to handle it.  i mean...i still have the feelings.  and i know that sounds stupid.  and i've been told so many times that they would go away.  but they havent.  all thats happened is that they are hidden a little deeper inside me.  and i dont mean that i can never talk to them.  thats not true i can.  and like i said i do talk to Kari.  but its takin somethin like 4 months or so to get to the point.  yeah...i feel really stupid writing this but hey its my blog and i can put anything i want in it! yeah but its just that they all got what they want and i just feel forgotten i guess.  thats all.  i've been feeling very pathetic lately.  sometimes i get so mad at myself cuz i have such a hard time controling my emotions.  i can hide them pretty well...though some people would disagree...they see what i want them to see.  but yeah.  i really need to work on controling these emotions.  i guess i have EMD:emotion management disorder.  haha!  ok ok...at least i thought it was funny.  well i think im gonna go play some good mellow sad song on the piano.  pianos are so cool.  au revoir.  je t'aime ma belle.

       she looked so beautiful today.  all the memories of us were stirred.  memories of what we once were.  they are beautiful memories.  precious memories.  how i love to get lost in all of the memories.  to dream those memories and never wake up.  she is so lovely and i miss her so much.  i miss the confidence i felt with her by my side.  i miss the way she could make it all just disappear.  i miss her loving me.  this is what i still have...these memories of that wonderfully beautiful lie.  the best lie i have ever known...for it made me feel so at peace.  all of this i will never forget...for she meant so much to me.  i will never forget...this requiem of her loving lie.

       High above the mountains, far across the sea  I can hear your voice, calling out to me  Brighter then the sun, and darker then the night I can see your love, shining like a light  And on, and on,  this hurt spins like a caroussel If I could travel ‘cross the world, the secrets, I would tell....  You and I... were meant to fly Higher then the clouds, we'll sail across the sky So come with me and you will feel That we’re soaring, that we’re floating off so high ‘Cause you and I were meant to fly  Sailing like a bird high,  on the wings of love Take me higher then, all the stars above  I’m burning, yurning, gently turning, round and round I'm always rising up, I never want, to come back down....  You and I... were meant to fly Higher then the clouds, we'll sail across the sky So come with me, and you will feel That we’re soaring, that we’re floating off so high ‘Cause you and I were meant to fly....

       well its mom's birthday today.  and its graduation day for our seniors.  i had to go to the practice at the VBC.  it was totally pointless.  the choir got set on the risers and we were supposed to STAY in our positions.  well we go down and find out that in the corridor that we are backwards so we gotta swing a u-turn and get the other end of the line to go out... and what happens... not everyone makes the u-turn.  so we're outta order.  we all scramble up onto the risers when we go out there and we're all mixed up... we sing the national anthem.  we get off... and they were so freakin slow gettin off the risers!  so basically we "practiced" gettin on and off the wrong way and messin up.  then after we sang we found out that we would have our own corridor cuz we had been squeazed into one with some of the seniors.  so now we're in a totally new place!  its great!  so the practice was utterly USELESS!  i have to go in bout and hour and a half or so.  i really dont want to... its mom's b-day and i dont wanna be at a graduation for it.  so Mrs Rimes said i could leave early... so when we're done singing im just gonna walk straight out the exit and leave.  so yes.  it will be ok.  so yes... i must be gone.  so... good day to you.

       went out tonight and saw Shrek 2 with Ellen, Bailey, Claire, Ben, Julie, and David... it was a great movie!  i loved it!  lots of laughs!  afterwards L, Bailey, Claire, Ben, and i went over to L &amp; Bay Bay's house.  i played some tunes on the piano... L got served!  i can so play the Canon better than her!  lol!  i just got back... i did have a very nice night.  i felt kinda lonely for most of it though... even though i had all my friends around... it was just.. weird.  i think L could tell cuz she was bein overly nice to me... or maybe the fact that Ben was there put her in a really good mood... ill try and be positive and say she was just tryin to be nice to me... not that she's not nice ever.  she's just sarcastic and stuff alot with me... its really our joke... but it bothers me sometimes.  i guess it was nice to have a nice Ellen this night.  she's actually started to be nicer and less sarcastic lately.  i like it.  but yes... anyways.  Bailey was downstairs sittin next to me while i was playin the piano... but she kinda disappeared after awhile... i think she went upstairs... but i was wonderin where she had gone.  well... i think im off for now.  its late and like Claire said "church tomorrow!"  goodnight everyone.

       its funny how life repeats itself.  its the end of my sophmore year and i feel like i did at the end of my 8th grade year.  alone and rejected.  now i dont believe thats true... but i cant help but feel like it.  i feel so left out... like some of my friends are ignoring me.  of course maybe that means i need to rethink who my friends are.  but i dunno.  its all very confusing.  i really should just stick with the friends that arent gonna hurt me... and i know who they are... its just i dont wanna have to let go of my other friends... cuz i love them sooo much.  this is very hard.  blah...

       well im home from school at the moment.  i didnt go cuz i have Mrs Rimes 1st and 2nd period and she isnt there today so she "indirectly" hinted that we didnt have to come to her class... so i didnt.  and then history i'm already exempt and our teacher doesnt care if i dont come to class.  i have the highest grade in there its not like he cares what i do.  so i didnt go to 3rd period either.  unfortunately i have Mrs Yarbrough 4th period and i  HAVE  to go to her class.  man... i almost had it made where i didnt have to go the whole day!  i was sooo close!  well i had BK ((Burger King)) for lunch today.  twaz very good.  tomorrow i think James and i are goin to Brittany &amp; Ellyn's dance recital... still not sure but maybe.  and then after that i might go with L and some kids to see Shrek 2.  but thats another iffy thing too.  but i'd really like to go and get out and see a GOOD movie... not like ELLA ENCHANTED!  yucky... it was funny but girly.  major chick flick.  anyways... i think im gonna go play some tunes on the piano.

       well... our choir concert went pretty good.  we sounded ok... but man we had a time gettin on and off that stage.  Mrs Rimes decided to mix up our pieces between the Concert Choir ((me)) and the Mixed Choir.  it was crazy cuz everyone was talkin back stage and WE WERENT SUPPOSED TO CUZ EVERYONE COULD HEAR!  anyways... other than that and the fact that i hate most of the songs cuz i'm  SICK OF THEM .  but yeah.  other than that... i really dont feel like talkin bout anything else.  its easier to keep my private life, well private.  so yeah.  maybe another time ill let you in on the woes of the life of Kristopher.  but for now im off cuz there's a good show on tv and i dont feel like starin at this computer screen.

       the wounds will never heal.  constantly they will be reopened.  you can never feel the same.  all your trust and faith is lost... and you have nothing left to do but cry.  you wonder if you will ever be free of this pain.  you have to let go... and though you will never be the same... you do have hope.  just wait awhile... your hope will come to you... and then the flowing tears of this requiem will not be in sadness...

       i need a new song to learn for piano.  lately i've been workin alot on the Canon in D and You Raise Me Up.  i got the Canon pretty good... You Raise Me Up could use a little more work... but i can do that later.  i'm thinkin about startin to work on Five for Fighting's 100 Years.  i really like that song.  its a very nice sound.  anyways.  thought i'd through that in there.  goodnight everyone.

       today was very boring.  choir was terrible.  i dont really like any of the songs we're singing.  cept for Daemon and thats not even really a "choir" song.  and now Mrs Rimes has this idea of adding these idiotic movements to Bohemian Rhapsody.  COME ON!   WE ARE THE SPARKMAN CONCERT CHOIR AND WE ARE STILL DOING CORNY MOVEMENTS!?!?!?!   im sorrry.  im rather moody.  and that was just really buggin me.  then there is this issue of friends... none of which i feel especially close to.  nows about the time for Dad to get transferred again.  yeah... 12 yrs in one place... its bout time to leave.  i dunno if i'd really miss anything.  there is nothin really to miss.  cept for maybe Ellen... oh and James cuz he's hilarious.  well i guess i'd miss the whole youth group at Church.. all 70 or so.  i love those kids.  anyways... i'm not movin so there's no use dreamin.  Tina and i have to go into school early tomorrow to make-up some quizes for Mrs Yarbrough's class.  i really dont feel like it.  im so ready to be out of that class.  oh man!  and we almost got to the part in Julius Caesar where I GET SOME LINES!  and we stopped for the day.  i was like man i wanted to be Octavius.... oh well.  maybe tomorrow.  oh and that part where they kill Cinna the poet cuz he has the same name as Cinna the traitor guy!  oh now  that  was funny!  anyways.  i think i should be off to make some dinner since im rather hungry.

         Remember When  by Bailey Hester   Remember when on May 16th you first rushed to the hospital,  And you almost had me in the elevator at 4:00 that morning.  When you looked at your beautiful 2nd child and now you recall,  How you knew at once that I was a special thing.  Remember when I broke my leg by stepping in that hole,  At eighteen months before I could barely even walk!  How we made cookies together and I licked the bowl.  And all those important lessons on how not to stare and gawk.  Remember when you used to pick out my cute matching outfits.  And at preschool graduation how you thought time was flying!  How I've grown up so much since then bit by bit,  And now look where were at, you're reading this and crying.  Remember all those great achievements,  My first grade poster award, the talent show in 3rd, and now debate team.  Don't forget all the fun we had on our Disney land trips and family camp-out in tents.  And the four fun years of my life being on that basketball team.  Remember when I used to have that blonde curly hair,  And when I looked like a hippie with glasses in 5th grade.  How I used to do your hair up in pony tails everywhere,  Look at those special memories we've made.  It's only 8th grade graduation, but I'll be gone before you know it,  Off to collage, marriage, and my own life.  So I wanted to take a moment to make sure you know it,  For all that you've taught me and for sticking with me even through the strife,  Thanks, and I love you!

       i had a grand time at the area-wide devo tonight.  it was FABulous!  Ellen and i joked around almost the WHOLE time!  oh goodness... the singin was awful!  we had some problems with off-keyness!  Ellen almost cried it hurt so bad!  and then we had like an Oreo party!  we were twistin oreo's to see who was the best... i got beat.  oh and then there was FABIO!  but ill leave him out of this for right now... hehehe!  then on the way back Ellen called Ben and i told him his new nickname!  ha!  that was funny!  and Brandon raced the other 2 vans home and WE WON!  so yes... i had a wonderful time.  im still kinda down bout my current woes... but im tryin to just not worry about it and let God take care of it.  i mean whatever is supposed to happen is gonna happen so why should i get so upset about all this... ha!  its alot easier to say that than to live it... but i shall try.  anyways... im very confused with life but it will be ok.  i really want to talk about this to someone... but i cant decide who... i mean everyone seems to be too busy.  which is fine... i dont expect people to stop everything for me.  but yeah... anyways.  i think i need to be off to bed now.  school tomorrow... oh joy.  but only for 8 more days i think.... man thats great... and then RAINBOW OMEGA!  uh oh!  this summer is gonna rock!  well goodnight world.  sleep tight.

       i just wanna cry... i dont know how else to feel... life just sucks.  everything that i want... i cant have.  no matter how hard i try... i cant have it.  i have looked so long for someone to be close to.  someone to trust.  i am so... just exhausted.  i want a friend so bad.  and its not like i dont have friends... cuz i do.  its just... i am always second best.  and i feel so alone.  i feel unappreciated.  course that might be that there is nothing to appreciate.  if thats the case then i am to blame... but i dunno.  argh... i feel so terrible.  have ever wished you could go back and do somethin over again?  yeah... i wish i could go back and live the past 2 years over again.  i have learned so much.  i am wiser... i'm smarter now.  im not a stupid little boy anymore.  it makes me so mad that people judge eachother on the past... but i guess thats the way life is.  i cant really complain cuz i do it too.  i wish it were different.  i wish this world gave second chances.... i wish people gave second chances.... ha!  dream on Kristopher...

       fear is a very interesting emotion.  i was thinkin about it today.  there were a bunch of quotes on fear on the front of the literary magazine at school.  and i was just thinkin about it.  fear is very powerful.  thats probably the hardest thing for me to cope with.  as a matter of fact... all of my stress is caused be fear in a way.  its really frustrating when i cant control how that fear affects me.  grrrrrr... i hate stress.  yanno... i thought that after the past 2 years and all the counseling that i'd just be ok again... but NO!  its so freakin hard to try think differently ((in less stressful ways))... man i just wanna scream!  i mean im not like in pain and i havent really had any chest pains in a long time.  so yeah... anyways.  thats enough of that.  i think it's time for bed.  yeah so just go to bed... ill be there in a second to tuck you in...

       i havent really made a nice insightful entry into the life of Kristopher.  im feeling especially stressed bout my nonexistant R department.  it is very frustrating... i want  her  to just give me a hint.  i want to see somethin.  i want somethin to give me some hope.  its kinda hard being around  her  and everytime she smiles at me or laughs at somethin i say im just hopeing that it means something.  that maybe she likes me... even just a little.  it wears you done... gettin your hopes up and then havin them smashed.  i dunno why i keep doin this to myself.  i should just give up.  but i soooo dont want to!  blah.  can you feel the STRESS!  anyways... i think im done being insightful.  bedtime.  goodnight.

       UGH!  i am so ticked off!  i hate who i am.  i cannot stand myself!  why do i have to be so darn sensitive!?!?!  why do i get my feelings hurt so easily?!  WHY CANT I GET OVER IT?!  i dont know what else to say.  i dont think i've been this upset in a long time.  goodness.  i want someone to relate to.  i want someone here that i can talk to... who will just understand me.  and i hate... yes i hate being judged.  being stuck into a category simply because i am what i am.  and yeah its probably stupid.  it really is.  i really should just ignore what people say and just live my life, but sometimes it just hurts so bad.  i guess its not the fact that i am being judged.  its usually what i am thats being judged.  and i despise that.  not so much because its mean... more because it makes me feel so bad.  i dunno.  not many things can lower my self-esteem... other than my Dad and this.  i feel so terrible... and i shouldnt!  AHHHHH!  I DONT UNDERSTAND MYSELF!  ok... i'm gonna stop before i hurt myself.  goodnight kids.

       hmmm.. i think i'm about sick of the family.  i need a vacation.  thankfully our Ocoee trip with the youth group is this weekend.  but really... everyone in my house is just really annoying me.  mainly Erik and Dad.  Erik though is at boy scout camp so i dont have to deal with his insanity and anger.  Dad on the other hand has been here... he left today to join Erik up at the camp.  but goodness.  my Dad is a very emotionless ((unless is anger or annoyance)).  he likes to joke around and tease and stuff.  of course i doubt he ever thinks about how his "teasing" affects his children.  but if maybe i lash back and tell him to leave me alone or get irritated then he goes into this big speech bout how teasing helps prepare you for the real world.  i can see that.  but maybe people need to STOP TEASING to prepare themselves for the real world where NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO BE TEASED!  ugh.  i have so much built up anger.  its terrible.  after all the time with the psychiatrist i've been able to handle my emotions and feelings better... of course to me that's involved hiding them away.  i dunno.  alot of times its easier for me to hide how i feel.  maybe i'm just scared to.  it DOES seem that everytime i voice my opinion or try and talk bout how i feel that my parents or siblings get hurt or irritated.  i dunno.  its just so frustrated.  my parents want me to talk to them... but i feel so "pushed away" by them.  and i know this is probably just some silly little teenage attitude that will most likely pass... but sometimes i wonder if i'm not just bein a crazy teen.  but yeah.  Dad's real insensitive.  to him emotions get in the way and its easier to keep them to a minimum.  to me emotions are life.  i admit that i do let them control too much of me at times... but i try not to appear controled by them.  course i guess thats not "managing" them.  but whatever.  i remember one time my psychiatrist asked me "You talk about how you're very similar to your mom.  Are there any similarities between you and your dad?"  i remember that so clearly.  i couldnt answer her.  i could think of nothing.  and i know its sad.  but i dont feel like his son.  i mean half the time i'm afraid to talk to him.  i hate askin him for things too.  i feel so guilty askin for anything.  but yeah.  done with Dad.  lets talk bout the brother.  Erik.  man.  that child is outta control.  not really.  but his attitude and temper are outta control.  he makes this house to be a living hell.  i despise this house mainly because of him.  Dad i can handle i guess cuz he's not home half the time.  but Erik... goodness.  it is so frustrating living with someone like him.  all he does is complain.  all he does is be totally negative.  all he does get angry.  and just bein around him stresses me out.  i know that its really just the codependent side of me.  if i cant help him or makin him happy or just stop him from bein so negative then i get so unhappy with myself.  yes i know its stupid... but i've always been that way.  i've heard all the little explanations as to why i shouldnt feel that way but i cant help it.  i've learned to handle or hide the stress but i cant stop bein codependent.  ha.  at least not yet.  yanno.  i've been thinkin ((i know shocking!)).  i've always thought that you're home is like your safe place.  you're place to rest and just be away from all the stresses of the world.  i feel happier and safer in the world.  give me the stress of the world.  i can handle that.  i can live with that.

         Through My Tears    by Kristopher  It's been so many years Since I gave that ring for you to wear We vowed to never part And I still love you that way  You're the one God gave to me You're all I'm dreaming of You've always believed in me With you I am free    Chorus   Its time to say goodbye Time has just slipped away, and I Know that I'll be OK You'll be forever mine, and I'm Sure that I'll smile again Through all my tears  You gave four lives to me And I could not ask for more  Together we've grown old Each day a blessing from above  You're the one God gave to me You're all I'm dreaming of You've always believed in me With you I am free       ((Chorus))       And now its time for you to leave I'll miss you every single day But I know you that are not far, and I'll see you in eternity  You're the one God gave to me You're all I'm dreaming of You've always believed in me You'll always be here for me       ((Chorus))

          Every Storm    by Kristopher &amp; Karin       Sad days have past. I smile again, and I have no fear with you by my side.  Life was so dark until you appeared. You brought me light where I was alone.   ((chorus))  You take my hand, and I know no sorrow. You give me faith to rise high above every storm  I was so lost, but you pulled me through. You held me close, and I hurt no more.  (( chorus ))  Ooo.... Oooo... Oooo... You came to me when all turned away. You gave me hope  and I knew I'd live through the storm.  (( chorus ))

       well i'm feeling very lonely tonight.  its pathetic.  i've had a crush on a girl for like past 2 months and i dunno if i'm hurting myself cuz i dont wanna give up or if i'm helping myself by stickin in there.  ugh.  blah.  i dunno what to say about this.  i really wanna just tell her but i'm so afraid.  it really stinks.  i mean i think it would work.  i'm pretty sure i could.  but still i'm so scared.  i just wanna scream.  AHHHHHHHHHHHH!  ok thank you.  oh and L made this terrific post tonight bout how she feels bout dating.  its excellent.. she put what i think into like perfect words.  course i didnt always think that way... but after 2 relationships that ended with me gettin hurt i've learned to look at dating a different way.  L's way.  its so much easier.  anyways... off to bed now i guess.  have a nice night.  sleep tight kids.

Victor Nivorsky is the bomb.  other than that i'm ticked... at life.  dunno why... i just feel like bein mad.  well.. its more like disappointed.  or frustrated.  oh goodness i dont know.  i'm ticked cuz i'm mad, disappointed, and frustrated!  there that makes sense!  so yeah.  i really cant complain.  its not like life is terrible or anything.  its just not goin exactly the way i'd like it to.  but whatever.  what's supposed to happen is happening and i cant change that.  anyways.  we'll see how it goes.

       i was taught not to run away... cuz raindrops will always fall on your face... when it seems like all hope is gone.  gotta get thru the storm... before you can see the dawn.  this is all i am.  this is all i know... and i won't never ever let go.  no i won't let go.  i walked thru the fire.  fought thru the raging storm... til i found the peace... that's inside of me.  i've got to be strong.  i stand for my dreams.  i was made for this moment.  take me as i am... or nothin at all.  i'll keep holdin on.  raindrops will fall...

       deep thoughts time.  everyone take a seat!  ok.  i was thinkin about like all these cute little couples i know.  friends from church or school.  mainly from church since i'm really not seein too many from school.  but anyways.  i like watching those couples.  its so interesting to watch people you've known for awhile behave totally different.  like people you used to think were so sarcastic and "tough"... those people who are now softened by a boyfriend or girlfriend.  its amazing.  even the toughest, coldest people can be brought to their knees.  i guess i like seein couples around cuz it reminds me of the feeling.  i mean yeah it does kinda make me sad... but on the other hand it makes me happy to see people together.  it makes me happy to see people happy.  ha.  there's that codependency within me again.

I find love again... and life just keeps on running... and life just keeps on running... you look at me and life comes from you.

       well... i'm back from Florida.  i had an ok time.  really the only thing i enjoyed were my long walks down the beach.  that was the actual vacation.  the hour or 2 away from my family.  those were very nice.  other than that... it was a just as stressful and irritating as it is at home.  probably more.  anyways.  i had alot of stuff i was thinkin about.  but i cant remember it all... my mind is just a big jumble.  i'll probably post some more "deep" thoughts tomorrow when i'm rested.  cuz right bout now i'm totally exhausted and ticked at some members of my family who dont actually know... but whatever.  goodnight kids.  sleep tight.

       this is like my first REAL day of summer.  its been pretty calm.  ha... ok its been boring.  but dont tell no one!  lol.  well its offical... we're goin to Florida next week.  not sure if im too happy bout it.  i mean i do love it... but it gets old fast.  but hey!  i get to take my long 4 mile walks down the beach... i do love that.  cuz i get to be ALONE!  well mostly... cept for the 60 yr old women in thong bikinis which is not absolutely disgusting.  it is very nasty.  hmmmm... i really wanna write about somethin deep and emotional... but i can't think of anything.  oh i got one!  ok... actually this irks me.  are girls thinkin that guys are totally emotionless and stupid.  i've always hated bein marked with that stigma.  here lets give an example shall we... the other day i was offering to help a girl who was havin trouble with her guy.  i didnt think i could help save a relationship... personally i didnt think it needed saving.  i was offering help with how he might react to a break-up.  since... well there were some very scary similarities to the situation and my situation with Kari.  i kinda had a good idea how he would react... since it would probably be the same way i had reacted.  so far...it actually has been.  but im gettin off topic... she didnt accept my help... which was fine.  it was actually cuz she couldnt with her mom over her shoulder... but anyways.  the next day we were talkin and it was a few of us and she told me that she had broken up with him... and i said that i could help.  and this other girl just comes out and says "but you're a guy."  oh my goodness... almost passed out again i was so mad.  its like HELLO I KNOW WHAT IM TALKIN ABOUT!  ITS THE FACT THAT I AM A GUY THAT COULD HELP!  grrrr.  really made me mad.  anyways.  that thing were guys are automatically characterized as emotionless, mean, stupid, etc. just really bothers me.  now i'll admit that MOST guys do have at least one of those qualities.  but not all.  i hate being discriminated because i'm guy.  i've never really felt comfortable around guys.  like... i've never met a guy like me that i could be friends with.  all my friends are girls... save for maybe one.  but even he is like a stereotypical guy a little.  i mean... im emotional... i cry... alot.  i get attached... i'm very intellectual... and sensitive.  i dunno.  ha... then that is connected to my frustration with girls.  i always thought that those were qualities that girls liked... and i guess they do since ALL of my close friends are girls.  but i wish i could be more than a friend to one... blah.  anyways.  dont wanna talk about that.  i think this post is PLENTY long enough.  i just had to get that out.  oh i do wanna say that Emma is awesome!  she's like exactly what i'd want a sister to be!  great minds think alike!

       well lets see now... today has been pretty good.  i have a terrible headache though.  everytime i bend down to pick somethin up my head just hurts soooo bad.  not fun.  this morning i was a bit irritated.  i think its cuz im tryin to get used to livin with my family again after bein away from them for a week.  personally i rather enjoyed bein away from them.  having to go back and be all patient and quiet like i usually am is not cool at all.  but thats life.  we were talkin last night at Casa Blanca and somehow we got on the subject of my brother.  everyone there was like "oh he's so cool and he's soo funny" and all this stuff.  and honestly what they saw of him... he really was cool.  when we went on our Joint Retreat at church and he went... i mean.... i had never seen act that way.  he was cool and he was funny and he was just neat to be around.  it's like he was a totally different person.  he is nothin like that at home.  well anyways... i was just sayin how i really dont enjoy his company... cuz he really is not a fun person to live with.  all he does is argue... he cannot be corrected cuz he thinks he's always right... he treats my sister like crap and always has since she was born... he's loud... he has no temper at all.  now i want to say that he in no way is overly mean to me... not meaner than any other brother in the world.  but just living with him is not fun.  in fact i despise it.  its why i like to get away from my house.  yeah true my dad isnt much better... but i can live with my dad.  he's alot like my brother... in fact i think my brother is like dad when he was young.  but dad isnt as obnoxious or hardheaded as my brother... i think its cuz he's an adult and has learned how to be a little different.  like i was saying... i said that i didnt enjoy his company... and some of the people there were like "you need to be a brother to him!"  and i about died.  it hurt my feelings so bad.  like its my fault that he's the way he is...?  i mean i'm nice to him... i dont do anything to him on purpose.  i rarely talk to him cuz whenever i try to really "talk" to him about anything important... he just gets all mad and tells me to stay out of his buisness.  and like im so upset.  cuz i've always wished i'd have someone close to me.  in my family.  so far the closest people to me have always been outside of my family.  i dunno.  alot of people have really good relationships with their siblings.  i have no relationship with my brother.  its like... all he is someone who lives in my house.  other than that i have nothing to do with him.  and its not cuz i dont want to .  i try to be friends with him... but its like tryin to hug a cactus.  all i do is get hurt everytime i try to be nice to him.  it always backfires.  he always does somethin to hurt my feelings.  and its like... i dont do anything to him!  there is no reason for him to hurt me!  it is very frustrating.  and it just really made me mad and REALLY made me feel terrible when they told me to be more of a brother to him last night.  ugh.  i'm not mad at them really... they know only what they've seen of him.  and what they see of him is someone i have never seen before... someone totally different than what he really is.  i was shocked on our retreat.  it was like i'd lived with him for 13 years and never seen the boy who was there.  he was totally different.  and it made me so sad... cuz i so wanted him to be like that all the time.  i mean... that would be just so cool to have a brother like that.  man... he was just so funny.  sometimes i wish my sister were older... i could so talk to her.  i mean... like share experiences... talk about my problems.  i've always wanted a sibling close to my age.  i wish it were Karin.  ha... this is so stupid... but sometimes i dream of having a sister or brother maybe like a year younger than me.  that would be so great.  well actually i dunno... im just assuming it would be.  but whatever... they are only dreams.

       ok Rainbow Omega was a BLAST!  it was sooo much fun!  we worked hard... we had a great time... and it just rocked!  i have to admit that the first 2 days or so i didnt fully enjoy myself... mainly because i was distracted.  but after that i really started to get into it...  so many memories... BURGER KING!  "so many injuries, so little time", GEOLOGICAL MASTERPIECES!  YASE!  NAME THAT BOOTY!

       random thought time.  altos are so sexy.  ha!  i know i know... kinda strange topic, Kristopher.  but its true.  i cant resist those altos.  not that they sound any better than sopranos... sopranos sing wonderfully too.  but those altos...  WOW !  i've always loved the alto part for songs.  it sounds sooo cool... and even better when they sing it.  its great... i could just listen to an alto all night... sigh.  i love singin with altos too.  tenor and alto parts sound so cool together cuz they're so close in harmonies.  whew... i just love it.  ok enough of that.  i'm feelin very lonely.. probably why i'm talkin bout strange stuff like how sexy altos are.  hahaha.  everyone i usually talk to has gone to sleep.  David Thomas is too busy with his poker... ha!  no crazy funny convos tonight.  church tomorrow...  YAY !  then cookout at the Brodies and i think a senior high devo later.  it shall be fun.  i'm listenin to Kellie Coffey's new version of Luther Vandross's "Dance With My Father"... sad song.  it makes me cry ((again probably cuz i'm in a strange mood.. oh well and i'm too sensitive)).  but it really is sad.  it reminds me of my grandma.. she's so sad after losing grandpa... its been 6 months.  but she's still so sad.  i know i remind her of him.  its freaky how much i look like him when he was young.  and i play piano by ear... just like him.  i even have the first piano he ever owned... the one that the San Francisco Conservatory of Music gave him.  its a beautiful upright piano.  i love it.  i played "My Heart Will Go On" for grandma on it when she was here.  she was in tears afterwards... i shouldnt have played that song but she asked me to.  when i was done she looked at me and said "That piano still sounds beautiful." and then she broke down.  poor thing.  there's no way i can understand how that feels.  to be married 45 yrs and then lose the one you love.  its beyond me.  but the devotion she showed to him over all those years touches me.  love is so beautiful.  i could see that beauty in them... just like i see it every other couple.  its so lovely.  makes me shed some tears.  i cannot wait to find the person i will spend the rest of my life with.  its weird to think about it... but somewhere out there is the person God intends for me to marry.  she's out there somewhere... just waiting.  gives ya somethin to live for.  it gives  me  somethin to live for.  goodnight kids... sleep well.     my iTunes  >>   urlLink Dance With My Father

       yanno whats really sad... people who are critical.  people that just find every little bad thing about something or someone.  its so sad.  cuz most of them really will never end up too happy.  they're always gonna be lookin for somethin to criticize.  but there's somethin even sadder!  people who find joy in criticizing.  the kind of people who just pick things apart till there's nothin left.  i feel bad for those people.  cuz they just dont do nothin but criticize.  i mean why cant we  stop  criticizing and maybe try  APPRECIATE .  people would be so much happier if we could maybe compliment instead of criticize.  try it.     my iTunes  >>   urlLink In The Still Of The Nite (I'll Remember)

       dont judge the book that you never bothered to finish reading.  you have no clue where it goes.  you have no clue what happens next.  it just became too much for you.  and maybe the author should have thought about that when writing it... but still you couldnt handle that book.  you closed it.  and never opened it again.  its a shame... you never got to the best part.     my iTunes  >>   urlLink I Will Remember You

       went and saw The Village tonight with my favorite kids!  the movie was... not as scary as the previews made it out to be.  but it was a typical M. Night Shamaylan movie:  weird setting and opening plot that eventually has a twist.  all of his movies are like that.  which is what i love about them.  so yeah... the movie was good... i was just expecting some scary so i was slightly disappointed.  i really wanna see i,Robot... and the Bourne Supremacy... but i'll probably wait for that to come out on DVD... but i've heard i,Robot is really good so yes.. that will probably be the next movie i go see.  so yes... after the movie we went of to L's house... Todd and i  TRIED  to make up a song about L's hair... didnt work to well.  L made some cheesecake which was good by the way.  the kids upstairs played poker... kinda disappointing since i dont like playin poker and i really would have liked to spend sometime with some of them.  thats ok cuz L, Todd, and i went outside and talked about stuff and such.  yase.. then i went home... lol.  ok enough bout what i did.  time for somethin different.  i was thinkin bout my current problem ((which i discussed with Ashley at the lock-in)).  where the  majority  of my friends are girls... but thats  ALL  that i tend to be.  extremely frustrating.  yeah.  sometimes i feel like the background in the some beautiful painting.  its wonderful... it brings out all the important things in the picture... but people really dont notice it... they always focus on whats in front of the background.   i hate being a background .  i wish some girls would look past what is in front of the background... i promise i'd try not to disappoint.  but whatever... i cant change the way people are... only dream.  oh yes... i've decided to start posting a little "my iTunes" thing at the end of my posts.  i'll put a link to the  urlLink iTunes Music Store  for whatever song i'm listenin to... so yeah.  goodnight kids.     my iTunes   >>    urlLink Nemo Egg (Main Title)

       this second of day of school was just as boring as yesterday.  i was worried that i had parked in some senior's spot this mornin... cuz they're already started assigning spots for seniors.  crazy.. i dont get to turn in my application or whatever till tuesday.  i have a question though...  how are we supposed to know which spots are already assigned and which ones arent ?!  huh!?   think bout it!  so confusing.  our school is so messed up.  i dunno.. its always been pretty stupid but so far this has topped all.  so yes.. very strange.  choir is gonna be fun this year already i can tell.  and guess what!   MRS RIMES SAID I WAS LOUD !  lol.. you dont understand!  i have  never been loud ... the past few years they've had to tell me to sing louder... now i'm like the only guy who is singing loud!  i am so proud of myself...  i am loud .       my iTunes  >>   urlLink She Will Be Loved

        does He still feel the nails?   man that question hit me really hard tonight.  Jason did a lesson on the song "Can He Still Feel The Nails?" and man.  it really makes ya think.  it puts a different perspective on it.  like... everytime you sin you're basically hurting Jesus.  you're sayin "hey bud, You died for me but i still wanna have fun, do what i wanna do, so i'm just gonna yanno put ya on hold for a bit."  i cant imagine what Jesus thinks sometimes.  when i screw up.  there is no way i could ever understand what He feels... when i hurt someone's feelings.  ugh... just the thought that Jesus hurts because of my mistakes makes me sick.  makes ya think bout how you're living... doesnt it?

       people seem to have a problem with judging others.  everybody does it.  i do.  but man its so stupid.  and pointless!  i mean really... people judge you on what they see of you or what they hear.  then they judge you.  its really kinda sad.  cuz they have only  ONE  side of the story or situation.  only what they see... and even that is biased.  and so then they judge you... and you're not too happy bout it and you guys get all annoyed with eachother.  and its sad cuz the person judging is really a nice person.. and if they knew the whole story they wouldnt be judging.  so lets make this simple.  dont judge.  lets try not to be so critical of eachother and try and be more understanding.  make the world a better place... be nice.   1  "'Do not judge so that you will not be judged.   2  For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by you stand of measure, it will be measured by you."  -  Matthew 7:1-2

L and i ran up the stairs!  yep!  we were workin out!  buildin stamina and what not.  we even got some others to come join us.  twaz great.  it was very long and we didnt have much to do.  cuz we were "locked-in" to the Madison Room.... who would have thought!  but yeah.  i did get to talk to some kids bout my current woes in life.  man that was fun.  i felt very open and comfortable.  it was nice.  so i wanna say thanks to Laura Beth, Ashley, and Bailey...  i love you ladies !  and dont forget the "friends" meeting on thursday!  hehehe!  oh yes!  and i'm so thrilled!  some nice person from our lodge at Ocoee found my lost wallet and mailed it back to me!  so nice of them!  i am  VERY  thankful!  yase.  well i'm gonna go get my hair cut since these curls are just  killing  me!  hahaha!

       ever since i tried to kill myself i have felt so guilty.  i guess its cuz i live while other  good  people suffer and die.  i know that its not fair.  there are people out there that would never dream of throwing away God's gift and yet they are many times the ones that hurt so much.  and here i am... i tried to kill myself and yet i am blessed.  i am blessed because i was givin another chance.  i guess thats why i feel so guilty.  i want to help.  i feel like a debt to the people.  and i want to help those with troubles so badly.  i think thats why i wanna be a psychiatrist.  i just want to help peopel so bad... and i feel bad if i cant help someone.  which i guess isnt really good.  i shouldnt be so critical on myself... but the guilt is enormous sometimes.  sigh... anyways.  there's a lock-in tonight at church.  tiz gonna be fun.  the last big thing to do before school starts on Thursday.  yuck.  we're gonna go bowling... but i really am not much into that.  i dont like bowling.  L said we should just skip and go swinging so maybe a couple of us will do that.  i sure wouldnt mind.  then maybe some movies and stuff too.  so yes that should be fun.  i think i shall hit the post button.

       why cant i have what i want?  i dont know what i'm doing wrong.  i pray to God and keep asking, "what is it You have for me?  what do i do, Lord?"  maybe i'm too blind to see His answer, but i still have no clue.  i dont know what direction i should be going in life.  i know what i want, but no matter how much i beg i never seem to be able to grasp it.  i'm so confused.  for all i know i am getting what i want and i just dont know it.  i wish God could slap a little " This is for you, Kris! " label on everything he intends for me.  that would be nice.  sometimes i really wish i could see my life from God's perspective.  i wish i knew what he wanted me to do.  i'm really gettin sick of all this confusion.  i want to  understand .

       a simple hello.  thats all it takes to brighten up a sad person's day.  or maybe just a little smile can stop someone from going home and taking their lives.  i try to think bout that as i walk around places where there are strangers.  or when i'm with people whom i might not be very good friends with.  something i do could have a big impact on someone else's life.  i dunno bout anyone else... but sometimes all it takes is someone sayin hi to me and they've just brightened my day.  i remember once a long time ago when i was depressed... i walked into church wednesday night and one of my friends who hadnt really said much to me in awhile turned around and just said "hey kristopher!" in the most exstatic voice... like they were happy just to see me.  that helped me so much.  just that  ONE  time.  another nice friend did the same to me today.  i've been feelin really down lately... ha just look at these sad depressing posts.  and this friend just said hey to me.  and it just made me happy to know i was noticed.  that i was singled out!  and really it didnt take that much effort for this friend to say hi.  he/she probably didnt think it was much.  but that one hey has just made me feel good all day.  you never know.  you never know what  YOU  can do.  you can change someone's day with such a simple thing.  you can save someone's life with just a simple thing.  a simple hello.

       quite lonely tonight.  i've been moody all day.  just bout everything has irritated.  it would have been great to have some nice long quiet time today... but instead we went to Chattanooga so instead i got to ride in a van with Erik &amp; Nick bein loud almost the whole time.  i nearly lost it.  i feel so stressed about my friendships... or lack of friendships really.  i dunno.  its weird.  cuz like i thought i had all these friendships and now all of the sudden i feel... nothing.  i guess this is one of those times where you find out who you're real friends are... who the ones are that will remember you.  but i feel so upset about it all.  i really should just get over it and move on.  but its hard... its like you know that its not their fault... its my fault for seein somethin that wasnt there... but at the same time i feel betrayed... but then i dont cuz i wasnt betrayed.  haha... i'm confusing myself and probably everyone who reads this... if thats anyone.  lol.  so yeah.  i really dont want school to start.  its not gonna be cool.  all i'm lookin forward to choir which i found out is 2nd period.  better than 1st period last year.  i havent ready A Raisin in the Sun for Honors English 11 and i dont really plan to... so hopefully i dont have english first semester... which isnt very likely... i've never had english first semester.  yep... well i think thats it for tonight.  night kids.

       i've realized that i made a big mistake.  ha.  and i even just mentioned it yesterday as a mistake that people should never make.  i put too much faith in people.  in friends.  i did it with Kari... and Mallory... and i got hurt both times.  cuz while people are awesome... some people are so nice... and Kari &amp; Mal both were great... but they are only human.  i shouldnt have put so much of my faith in them.  i thought i was gettin better at it since i used to be that way all the time... but obviously i still have a ways to go.  i used to rely on people so much... for my happiness.  in a way i still do.  but this time... this time i was relying too much on someone to make me feel good about myself.  and as with all the times before i was disappointed.  its not this person's fault really.  its mine.  i expected too much.  never expect too much of people... you  WILL  get your feelings hurt.  ok... i think i'm done.  goodnight kids.

       yanno i really envy kids i know that grow up having their whole family bein Christians.  living here in the South there are tons of families that have gone all been Christians since the beginning of time it seems.  half their family are either ministers or elders or deacons in the Church.  which is great.  they have so much support.  they have an easier time being solid in their Christianity.  because they're surrounded by it even when they go to see their family.  not all are so blessed.  i am only the second generation in my family that is Christian.  well.. i'm the second generation that can truely call themselves Christians.  cuz we have others in our family that  SAY  they are Christians but they really dont follow the Bible.  there seems to be alot of people like that.  people who dont follow the Bible yet call themselves Christians.  its like they only follow the parts that they agree with.  only the parts they want to follow.  is that really Christian?  its more like  Me -stians.  its all about them.  what  THEY  want.  not what  God  wants.  and some people dont realize they're that way.  they just believe whatever they've been raised to believe.  they're so blind.  i mean they're preacher could get up and preach some crazy thing like "its ok to commit adultery!" and they'd probably believe it.  its like they're not independent at all.  they dont believe in God or the Bible... they believe in their preacher or whoever they respect.  one of the biggest mistakes is to put your faith in a man.  because you  WILL  be disappointed.  but now thats gettin back to what i started talkin about.  i guess its a blessing to not have all your family Christians... in a way.  cuz i can see all these different beliefs.  these examples of what not to be.  others mistakes.  still... i wish i had  REAL  Christian grandparents to visit.   REAL  Christian aunts and uncles.  that'd be nice.  it would be some great Christian support.  i would really just like to know what it feels like to be surrounded a Christian family.  sigh.  that'd be nice.  instead of feeling alone as a Christian.  i mean my parents are both Christians... but you know what i mean... my extended family.  that'd be great.  but awww well.  cant have everything in life.  gotta settle with what ya got.  anyways.  gonna go do somethin constructive... haha yeah right!  whatever!

       i feel like the past 2 years have been stolen away from me.  i am  older than my years .  i know that it was my fault that i wasted away... but it still upsets me.  i mean... to tell ya the truth i havent enjoyed the past 2 years.  between anxiety, depression, family, and everything else i havent had much time to just slow down and have fun.  not that i havent had fun... just... its alot easier to have fun when you dont have terrible stressful things on your mind all the time.  again.. thats my fault.  i wish i could go back and just live it all over again.  i betcha alot of people wish that.  but i regret so much.  and i know that the me of the past 2 years wasnt me.  it was me takin control by all the stress in my life.  it makes me sick to think of it.  cuz i know i could have been so much better.  i could have been better to Kari.  i could have been better to Mallory.  i could have been better to Erik and Karin.  i could have been better to all my friends.  i could have been better to God.  we were talkin at church tonight about people who blame God for their problems.  like everything that happens to them is God's fault.  i'll admit that i've wondered.  " why did you make me this way?  how does this benefit anyone?  why do i feel this way, Lord? "  and i know its a stupid question.  i am the way i am because it is a test.  its a reminder.  Paul in the Bible often refers to a "thorn in the flesh".  no one really knows what this "thorn" was.  the most likely theory was that Paul had poor vision.  but Paul asked God 3 times to remove this "thorn".  God declined... he told Paul that this "thorn" was there to remind him that he was human.  that he must have faith in God.  in our weaknesses God is made strong.  my weakness... my anxiety.  all the worrying... all the stress... this is my "thorn in the flesh."  it took me 2 years to realize that.  ha... talk about slow.  but now i know that where i am weak God will be there to make me strong.  in Him i feel strength.  honestly... thats what keeps me alive each day.  God's love.. and His strength.  the love of God... the most awe-inspiring thing ever to exist.  my eyes water just thinkin about it.  goodnight kids.

       am i just plain screwed up?  is that why i have so many ridiculous problems?  i mean lets think bout this for a moment.  i have generalized anxiety disorder supposedly.  i have some symptoms of social phobia.  thats kinda screwed up right there.  all because of this constant fear of rejection and loneliness that i cant seem to get over.  again... very screwed up.  i tend to have this codependent reaction to certain situations.  i feel bad when i cant make somethin right.  or when someone else messes up.  once again.. very screwed up.  i also tend to screw things up.  first my relationship with Kari.  which of course was my fault.  i was so stupid.  she knows it too.  though i wish she had told me... but it was still my fault.  my depression.  my fault again.  i let all this stuff get to me and it really brought me down.  Mallory?  well honestly i dunno if that was my fault or not.  but i do kinda feel guilty for that one.  ha.  it seems i always find these great girls then somehow i lose them.   i think its probably my problems that mess up this stuff.  like i said... i'm screwed up.  it just makes me sick that i cant go back and fix this.  i mean... i know Kari probably thinks i'm just so messed up after all that i did.  ha... she has good reason to think i am.  but i dont wanna be remember by anyone as the sad little pathetic boy who couldnt control his feelings.  and so far i feel like thats all i've given people.  sigh... thats it for my sad pity post.  night kids.

       random topic time.  man i'm just on a roll.  alright.  this has bothered me about girls since Kari and i broke up.  its the buttering you up before they let ya down thing.  all that "oh you're such a good person.  you're so wonderful!  blah blah blah etc."  and they're all complimenting you and junk.  and then they're like "so yeah with that said... SEE YA!"  goodness that really bothers me.  and girls wonder why guys dont take the hint.  its cuz you butter them up with compliments before ya break up with them.  then when you do the guy just doesnt get it, right?  yep.  he's all thinkin "so wait a min... she says all this great stuff about me.  tells me how good i really am.  and then she breaks up with me.  what is up with that?"  and lemme tell ya it eats away at them.  at least it ate away at me.  its like the ultimate confusion.  she says your wonderful... but obviously not wonderful enough for her.  same thing with just friends in general.  they're all "oh you're such a good friend.  i trust you so much and i tell you so much and you're just a great person that i like to be around.  blah blah blah etc."  and then they go and dont even treat you like that.  its like everyone is so full of compliments cuz they're afraid of hurting people's feelings.  compliments that dont even mean.  but in truth all they're doin is makin it hurt more.  cuz now they havent just hurt your feelings by break up with you or not treating  you as a friend... they've lied to you... which hurts your feelings even more.  so yanno how we can solve this problem?   cut the crap .  dont lie.  tell the truth.  you break up with someone.  dont tell them how wonderful they are.  because to you its obvious that they dont mean enough and all you're doin is settin them up for disaster.  makin them feel worse.  if you arent friends with someone... dont pretend to be.  dont lie to them and make them believe that they are.  cuz when they finally realize they arent... then its just gonna hurt them so much more.   just stop .  stop lieing to yourself and to them.  stop building people up only to bring them down again.  get a life and while you're at it.. a heart too!

       i'm feelin quite terrible.  actually i'm feelin horrible now.  but what else is new?  this too shall pass.  anyways.  i forgot that a day or so ago i posted somethin bout how its strange that people can make you feel so much better even if they're not tryin to.  someone left a comment on that one "you do that for me everyday."  i am so so so curious about who that is.  i must know.  its been buggin me.  and since i'm feelin so down at the moment i decided to write bout it.  lol.  if i can do that for this person everyday then maybe they can do the same for me just this once.  lol.  ok thats really cheesy.  hahaha.  but i do wanna know who it was.  so yeah.  another random topic.  on sunday Mike preached a lesson bout how Christians ought to act like Jesus.  ((hence the word christian: Christ-like)).  he said that people should be look 2 places if they want to actually see Jesus Christ.  the bible and Christians.  that really just hit me.  like it was just a great point.  as Christians, people should be able to look to us to see how Jesus would be.  we should be walking Jesus's in our actions.  what really bothers me are all these people that call themselves Christian yet dont even attempt to be  Christ-like !  and then they come up with all these excuses like "oh well no body's perfect".  the bible doesnt say you have to be perfect.  God doesnt expect you to be perfect.  but come on!  at least put some effort into bein a Christian.  dont just say it and  DO  nothing.  oh and my favorite excuse!  "i'm not Jesus."  oh thats a good one.  if you dare call yourself a Christian ((remember  ONE WHO IS LIKE CHRIST !)) then dont you have to be  LIKE  Jesus!  goodness.  ok.  lol.  i'm done preachin it.  that kinda stuff just really bothers me.  not sayin i'm perfect or anything yanno.  but i do know that i try.     21  "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven  will  enter.   22  Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?'   23  And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness." -  Matthew 7:21-23

       man i'm just full of random thoughts tonight.  it must have been all the singin i did today.  anyways.  here's a good question.   what is normal?   i mean lets think bout it here.  everyone is always talkin bout whats normal.  people judge eachother sayin "hey thats not normal!"  well really... what is normal?  who defines normal?  what i may consider normal maybe be considered abnormal others.  everyone has different thoughts as to what is normal.  so really is anyone normal?  is there such thing as normal?

       so yeah... i was thinkin the other day about how this world has totally corrupted the idea of love and made it somethin that is almost shunned upon.  i mean look for example.  all the movies out with these "explicit" scenes in them!  and even on TV for cyin out loud!  where is the decency in that?!  i mean... first off the people involved are not portrayed as married and while they try to make it look like there is some love involved there isnt.  its all lust.  thats the problem nowadays.  people get love and lust so confused.  oh and goodness dont even get me started on stuff like pornography.  i dunno bout you but porn to me is just not attractive.  its disgusting.  i mean God says that sex is ok... he condones sex  BETWEEN A HUSBAND AND WIFE !  not with whoever you want.  and pornography is just that.  its all built around lust.  its disgusting.  and the people who make them!  what kind of sick perverted freaks are they?!  they have no respect for themselves nor anyone else.  they just put there body out there and use it for perverse things.  it really just makes me wanna puke.  ha.. and then there's the people that watch it!  you notice no one wants to be associated with porn but they sure have no problem watchin it!  hyprocracy.  get a life.  ugh.  our society is so sexually driven.  that really bothers me.  and it gets worse every day.  before yanno it you wont be able to turn on a Disney movie without having to worry.  who knows!  maybe they'll just throw out the G-rating since there are hardly any movies left that can be rated as such.  oh its pathetic.  and then there's all these people ((girls mainly)) and they way they dress.  ooo man that really gets me.  they think its soooo attractive to have their boobs hangin out... or to have a shirt so low that you can see there butt cheeks.  i mean come on.   COVER YOURSELVES PLEASE !  i honestly find none of that attractive.  what i  do  find attractive is a girl that respects herself enough to cover herself.  a girl that knows about this little thing called  MODESTY !  now thats hot.  all this stuff... porn, movies, clothing.  its all based on this sexual thinking that this world is tryin to shove down our throats .  its all this lust.  and its sick.  so do yourself a favor.  just say no.

       so yeah... i was talkin to L earlier and we were talkin bout how sometimes people want somethin so bad that they kinda get sucked into this fantasy world where they know they wont get what they want but they keep believing they will.  its just so crazy.  and i guess in the long run its really just hurting you.  cuz you're gettin yourself all hyped up and all hopeful but you know nothin will ever happen.  you know you're not gonna get what you want.  but you let yourself get all wrapped up in it anyways.  and then when you finally decide to stop livin in your stupid fantasy world it ends up hurtin really bad.  like right now.  i've come out of my dreamworld.  i've given up on Bailey.  and yes... the mysterious "other girl" was Bailey.  i have no fear in admitting it.  she is a great girl... and she always seems to make me laugh which is absolutely adore.  i'm glad that she is my friend... and i guess its probably better that we stay friends.   friends are friends forever .  like i said i knew it would never happen... i just needed a little kick to get me out of my fantasy world.  and i will thank my trusty L for givin me that kick.  lol... i love L, she's a great friend.  she can always tell me whats best for me.  she gives me just a totally different view on life.  i wish i were more like her.  i wish i thought more like her.  she's helped me so much in past year or 2 even if she doesnt know it and she's such a good Christian support for me.  anyways... i'm gettin too sappy.  lol.  i'm in a very strange mood.  well, goodnight kids.  sleep well.

       well i was told to write about somethin happy.  so i was thinkin bout places i like to visit.  one of my absolute favorites is the  urlLink North Californian coast .  its so beautiful there.  well some people might not think so but i love it.  just the dark rocks and cliffs and the waves smashing up agasint them.  all the white foam from the waves.  i just love it.  its so beautiful.  i really would just love to live there someday.  like have a nice, quaint little house on a cliff overlookin the water.  oh that'd be lovely.

         When She Loved Me    by Sarah McLachlan   When somebody loved me everything was beautiful. Every hour we spent together lives within my heart.  And when she was sad I was there to dry her tears. And when she was happy so was I. When she loved me.  Through the summer and the fall we had each other, that was all. Just she and I together, like it was meant to be.  And when she was lonely I was there to comfort her. And I knew that she loved me.  So the years went by. I stayed the same, but she began to drift away I was left alone. Still I waited for the day when she'd say "I will always love you."  Lonely and forgotten, never thought she'd look my way. And she smiled at me and held me just like she used to do. Like she loved me. When she loved me.  When somebody loved me everything was beautiful. Every hour we spent together lives within my heart. When she loved me...

       all along the road less traveled, i have crawled and i have run.  i have wandered through the winds and rains until i found the sun.  the watching eyes asked me why i walk this narrow way.  there may never be a reason for the hope i have today but... i am blessed.  from when i rise up in the morning until i lay my head to rest.  i feel you near me.  you soothe me when i'm weary.  for all the worst and all the best... i am blessed.

       had fun at VBS last night.  twaz great.  especially, Hollye, Todd, and Casey's cabin.  they had  ONE KID .  it was sooo funny.  they had so much fun.  tonight they said if they have one kid there just gonna take him to get ice cream!  lol.  ((they wont though cuz thats against the rules! hehehe!))  oh yes.. i spent all last night takin pics with Mike Baker's camera for the slideshow tonight... and i had my camera too for takin my own pics.  so it looked pretty funny.. me walkin around with 2 digitals around my neck.  i need to get some new batteries for tonight.  the ones in mine right now are runnin low.  i'm feelin better bout everything as of now.  well cept those stupid miniscule things that i mentioned yesterday.  but as far as friendships go... much better i think.  the girl... ?  well someone told me to "get over" her.  sigh.  that really got me thinkin.  i dunno.  ugh.  it almost complicates things.  cuz now i have to decide whether to follow my feelings or my mind.  yanno i think thats one of the biggest problems people face.  following their emotions or their logic.  more emotional people follow their emotions and more logical, realistic people follow their minds.  but both types sometimes must choose to follow what they are not used to following.  i know i'm one of those emotional people.  really i'm too emotional.  and i try to incorporate my logic into my decisions.  i want to balance.  i think thats what all people really want... to balance the logic and emotions of life.  i need more time to think about my decision.

       night two of VBS went alot smoother than the first night.  people knew where they were goin so it was better.  i'll put up some pics of the whole week on thursday or friday.  after VBS last night a bunch of us from the youth group went to the Passon's house.  we had ping-pong, air hockey, and lots of food!  we watched Dumb & Dumber cuz Jason wanted to.  very funny movie.  when it was over there was a bad storm goin by so we all just hung around and chatted and watch some tv.  then around 12:15 we all went home.  twaz late and i was tired.  only when i get home i couldnt go to sleep.  i've noticed that over the past week or so i havent been sleeping well.  i actually dont ever sleep well but it was especially bad this week.  i dunno.  i'm very stressed.  all this stuff is really driving me crazy.  i'm worrying about these friendships that might not be as close as i'd think.  then there's this girl.  and my family and my home that i'm STILL not happy with.  then there's all these miniscule little things.  i say miniscule cuz really they're not that important but to me they are very important.  so yeah.  uh huh.  now its off to see what i shall be doing today.

       have you ever looked into the eyes of someone without hope?  someone finds no joy in life?  somone overcome with the empty feeling of worthlessness?  i have.  i used to see those eyes everyday.  everytime i looked into a mirror... there they were staring back at me.  i cannot forget how they looked.  it makes me cry to remember how that felt.  to wake up every morning and feel nothing.  to have nothing to live for.  i cannot describe that feeling of desperation.  i live ashamed everyday because of what i almost did that night.  that night when i let go of everything.  there is no doubt in my mind that i would have killed myself.  had it not been for guilt i might not be here.  but what i felt that night is so indescribable.  i want to say empty or hopelessness but that does not even begin to describe how terrible i felt.  all i had to do was pick one of the 18... and i could have ended everything.  i could have been free.  but it was guilt that stopped me.  guilt.  how could i look into the eyes of my family on the day of judgement?  how would i explain myself?  or what about my friends?  how would i tell them?  it was guilt that showed me by killing myself all i would be doing is causing more pain.  and was that not what i was trying to escape?  how could i tell those people that "  i just couldnt stand the pain... so instead of living with it i gave up.  and thats why YOU had to cry for me.  thats why i wasnt there when YOU needed me... because i was weak.  "  and what would i say when i came face to face with my Lord on that day?  what would i say to the one who bore the sins of the world?  "  i'm sorry, Lord.  you died for ME.  you gave ME salvation.  you gave ME hope.  yet i was too blind to see.  i just couldnt live with the pain of life.  i couldnt handle it.  though you bore the pain of the world on that cross.  i couldnt bear the pain of one single lifetime.  this is how i repay you, Lord.  this is the fruit of your sacrafice.  me.  the weak pathetic soul that gave up.  "  how could i do it?  how could i spit in the face of the Christ by giving up the gift he gave to me?  my guilt saved me that night.  and i now live each day with a different view of life.  i am not afraid to die.  nor am i afraid to live.  i am thankful for what God let me see.  i am thankful for the experience of near suicide.  it has made me stronger and wiser.  but i still feel the guilt of what i nearly did.  i live everday with the shame.  i feel so terrible that i live while other good people die and suffer.  people who never would have through God's gift away.  why cant it be me?  why cant i suffer for them?  i was the one who threw away His gift.  they dont deserve the pain.  i have known for so long now that i would die for anyone.  to save one life... i know i could give mine.  i feel so humbled in the presence of my friends from church.  because i know that most of them would never dream of throwing away their gift.  i feel so ashamed to call myself one of their friends... and i have never told anyone.  ever since that night... i have felt so unworthy of the second chance i have gotten.  i am blessed.  because i now can see both sides of life.  i've seen the joy of life and the emptiness of life.  and i can now help.  and thats what i intend to do.  i want to spend the rest of my life helping those who have no hope.  i want to give them a reason to live.  that is my goal in life.  if i can help just one person... then this second chance God has given me was not in vain.  all that i have just told you is my darkest confession of what i almost did.  it is what haunts me everyday.  deep inside... in the back of my mind i know its there.  this that i have shared is  my requiem .

       VBS was fun.  i guess.  i'm  REALLY  upset about missin everything my youth group did last night.  especially since Todd and i had been talkin bout it FOREVER!  ugh.  anyways.  i'm feelin so sick.  my head hurts.  i'm exhausted.  i really am not feeling much... emotionally that is.  if anything its loneliness but i doubt even that is what i'm feelings.  its more just like nothin.  not sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing.  but yeah.  right life is really confusing.  i dunno.  man i'm just like all messed up.  its so hard to describe how i feel.  i just cant think of a good word.  blah.  no thats not the word.  i guess broken works.  yeah.  broken.  hmmm....

       i've decided to start learning Eric Clapton's  Tears in Heaven  on the piano.  it doesnt look too bad... course i decided to use the easy version and not the hard one but i'll get to that sometime.  my fingers are kinda sore.  they tend to feel like that after i play for a while.  Mom's gone at the moment.  i think she went to the pottery place to work on these bowls she's makin.  they're actually pretty nifty.  Erik and Karin are bein quiet for once.  well Karin is usually quiet... but thankfully Erik is too today.  earlier he was yellin at the computer cuz he couldnt beat some silly game.  i hate video games.  i KNOW that this house would be alot more peaceful if we would get rid of all these stupid video games he has... i mean for goodness sake he has them on both computers plus his PS2.  and its like when he gets sick of yellin at one he'll move to another.  i mean really... arent these games supposed to be fun?  all he does is yell at them.  and Mom & Dad say they're trying to get him to stop.  i dont think they do so as well as they say.  half the time he's yellin and they just ignore it.  but i dont get it.  whatever.  he's not my kid.  psh... all i have to do is live in the anger he creates.  and i cant correct him or stop him cuz it will just make him mad.  and i'm not his parent so its not my place either.  its a rather impossible situation.  anyways.  VBS starts tonight.  i am a "camp counselor."  its gonna be fun!  take the kids around to the different posts and stuff.  course i think they already have a ton of counselors... it sure seemed like it and i dunno if they're gonna need teams of counselors so i might just end up walkin around with the digital takin pics for the church website.  i wouldnt mind though.  well off to make tortillas.  yum.

       another random topic from me.  oh yes i know you all are just soooo excited.  so yeah.  i want to address this issue of "liking" someone or whatever.  and this "oh i dont like you anymore" stuff.  one thing that i think i've had a hard time explainin to everyone is that, for me, its not somethin that just ends.  ok hold up.  i think i've already confused you.  i'm trying to say that i never really  STOP  liking someone.  i just  CHOOSE  to pursue someone else.  a good example is Kari.  we both went through alot.  and we both got hurt i think.  well i know i did.  but i still like her.  its not somethin that just stops.  the attraction is still there.  same with Mal.  i've just chosen to not pursue that attraction.  especially since both would go no where.  there is one more attraction i've had for someone else.  i dont wanna name names.  just cuz.  but its like... i still like the girl.  i always will.  there is that attraction.  but i dunno.  its just i've chosen to keep her as a friend.  and not pursue that attraction.  not that i couldnt ever.  just that it seems to be better to leave it alone.  true i will always like her... i probably dont seem like it.  its not somethin that is just active in my mind.  but in the back of my head its there.  sometimes it makes look at her different just for a second... she really is a great gal.  and like i said i do like her... i think there is always that attraction between guy's and girl's that are just friends.  at least for one of them.  i mean is not friendship an attraction?  thats why i really think that friends can date.  friendship is the first step into more serious relationships.  and personally... i like my relationships to be with friends.  it makes it more fun... at least i think so. anyways... those are my thoughts on friendship and "liking" a friend.  so yeah.  as far as my current life goes... i'm still in this relationship dilemma.  for right now i dont have to deal with it... i can focus on what i truly want for now.  but i know that eventually i will have to confront this.  ugh... not lookin forward to that.  so yeah.  friendships... those have been cleared up.  well.. any doubts i was having were definitely takin care of and its all good now.  so yes.  i actually cant complain much.  life is pretty good.  ha... life is actually great.

       today was mostly boring.  what am i saying.  it was all boring.  cept for maybe cooking which i love to do.  that was probably the highlight of my day.  other than that i was absolutely bored.  i was thinkin bout my friendship issues.  i think i've realized what the problem is.  its my fault.  i guess i feel alot closer to these people than they feel to me.  so when they dont treat me the way i'd expect them to i get my feelings hurt.  so yeah.  i know i cant blame people for that.  its my fault that i didnt realize that.  but oh well.  i need some ice cream.

       ok just an off the wall topic that i was thinkin bout this morning.  its all this trying to impress people stuff.  it bothers me.  cuz really what are people who try to impress doing?  they're building a lie.  they try so hard to impress that the person they appear to be is not who they really are.  its sickening to me.  i mean i think its good to make good impressions but not to overdue it and always try to impress people.  i mean think about it.  you try to impress people because you want them to like you or whatever.  but really... i mean come on.  doesnt that mean you're just unhappy with yourself.  why do you have to impress these people to make them like you?  why dont they just like you for who you are?  i dont get it.  not that i've never done that before.  but not in a long time.  maybe i should... maybe that would make my current relationship woes just a bit easier.  but i refuse.  i will not become someone i am not.  i will not live a lie to impress people.  i hate it.  people need to come less dependent on other people.  its something i struggle with everyday.  i am far too dependent.  blah.

       man.  i am so bored.  i really wanna talk bout somethin deep and meaningful.  but i cant think of anything.  i've become so fed up with all this relationship stuff.  its so just... ugh.  i mean... the girl that i like doesnt even give me a second glance.  granted thats probably cuz she has no clue.  but still... you'd think i might get maybe some more friendliness even if there was a small remote chance.  maybe some openness.  just something!  its so frustrating because i just cant stop thinkin bout her.  i mean i'm not obsessive... even though it sounds like it.  its just that she is just sooooo funny.  and her personality is just so attractive.  its people like her that make me happy to be alive.  they make the world fun.  then there's this other girl who i think likes me.  and she's really nice and all.  as a matter of fact she is probably one of the sweetest people i know.  but like i dunno if there's a connection.  and we like dont talk bout anything really.  and thats important to me.  i mean... i have to be able to have a decent, meaningful conversation with any girl i'd call my girlfriend.  but i dunno.  i am so so so so  CONFUSED !  grrrrr.  sigh.  anyways.  these are my current relationship woes.  i thats it for tonight kids.  goodnight.

       went to see Spider-man 2 yesterday after church.  it was the 9:45pm showing so i didnt get home till like 12:30am.  twaz very late.  i enjoyed the movie though even if it was a bit corny.  on the relationship front... i'm still very confused.  i'm almost just sick of it all.  so yeah.  friends.  i'm also frustrated.  the number with whom i felt close to has dramatically dropped.  very depressing.  but c'est la vie.  i'll get over it.  i'm quite bored at the moment.  feeling very lazy.  or maybe i'm just ticked and i dont feel like bein messed with.  either way i dont wanna get up and i know my mother is gonna ask me to go with her to go get somethin real soon.  how this is relevant to you... i have no idea i'm just typing  whatever comes into my head.  so yeah.  anyways.  gonna go poof and just disappear.  POOF!

       today hasnt really been that great.  i've been really kinda upset all day.  for many reasons.  my current feelings towards some of my friends... thats really got me pretty ticked.  and sad.  like i wanna be mad at them but i really cant.  i have no right to be... so i'm just sad bout it more than mad.  and then there are a ton of other personal stuff that i dont wanna complain bout it cuz its stupid.  but yeah.  not too happy.  i did pretty much nothin today.  i'm workin on a website for my Mom's soap buisness thing.  she needs one desperately.  i need to get the second book for our summer reading stuff.  i read The Great Gatsby.  it was pretty good... especially at the end when everyone started gettin killed.  lol.  that sounds terrible.  but really it was pretty boring besides that.  and it took place on Long Island... sigh.  Dad said yesterday that we arent goin up there this summer.  we're gonna wait till Fall break.  so that should be fun.  i really dont wanna go back to school which we must do on July 29 i think.  it stinks.  hmmm.. it looks stormy outside.  it was pretty bad last night.  i loved lookin at the rain though.  it was cool cuz the wind would blow it and you could see like waves of rain move accross the road.  lol.  well i thought it was cool.  yeah well... lol.  i really have nothin interesting to say so i'm just gonna go.

       ok the plans changed.  i went to the DMV and got a new license... instead of goin outside and raking up some grass.  which i think i shall do tomorrow.  anyways.  i did say i would post somethin bout my current feelings as to some friendships.  i've had this terrible feeling lately that some of the people whom i consider friends may not think of me as close to them as they are to me.  i've noticed that some people talk to me and all... they're nice to me and all.  but only when i talk to them.  otherwise i'm nothing.  then all these other people get all their attention.  kinda makes me feel crappy.  especially when i "thought" that i was at least somewhat desired as a friend.  it hurts.  but whatever.  its probably more my fault for seeing somethin that really wasnt.  but still... i really thought that these people considered me a good friend.  course then they treat these other people so differently... they treat them better than me.  one of the things that i just always remember is that they'll say goodbye to certain people and then like not say a thing to me.  i mean... yeah its really no big deal.  but  HELLO?!  I'M HERE TOO!  WE'RE FRIENDS REMEMBER?!   ugh.  i love people... but sometimes they can be so mean.

       so yeah... i'm sittin here.  all bored and stuff.  and then i think.. HEY i gotta good idea!  i'll post somethin on my blog!  ha.  man now you know i'm bored.  i hardly ever post stuff in the middle of the day.  well i guess its not really the middle of the day.  its 3:13 here at the moment.  hot outside as usual.  Dad wants some stuff raked up outside.  i think i shall go out there when i'm done.  i've been tryin to be nicer and more understanding of my parents since the other day.  lemme tell ya... its kinda difficult.  but i'm trying.  i just keep thinkin before i respond to anything.  to make sure i dont sound irritated or anything.  but yes anyways.  i need to get my license replaced cuz i lost my wallet and everything.  i guess Mom and i will go down to the DMV and get that fixed tomorrow or somethin.  we're not sure if we're gonna go to NY anymore.  i really want to but none of our friends up there would be there so Dad's thinkin bout waitin for October.  that would be cool.  i havent been back to Long Island during the fall in a LONG time.  hmmm... what else.  i'm a little upset bout some friendship stuff but i think i'll write bout that tonight.  so yeah.  time to hit the post button.  au revoir.

       well kids... lets see what interesting though Kristopher has today.  first off.  i last night i told my mom &amp; dad what it was bout our home that made me unhappy.  we had a 2 hr conversation bout it.  i dunno what shall become of it.  they listened though i dont think they will be able to change any of the problems.  i know i cant change people.  my dad told me that i could always talk to him and that he can be just as open and emotional as i am... even if i hardly ever see him as such.  i dunno if i've really accomplished anything.  i mean sure it was probably good to tell them how i feel.  but i dont expect things to change.  i mean they cant change the way Erik acts... at least not in the time that i will still be living in this house.  i really cant expect them to change their personalities.  so yeah.  i think this is a problem that i cannot fix.  i'll get over it.  but i did realize somethin the other day.  it was actually pretty funny cuz it was somethin i had never thought about.  so here's what happened.  i was thinkin bout Kari &amp; Mal and how i got attached and too serious with both of them.  i was too demanding.  i asked for too much.  and i realized what i wanted was love.  not just any love.  i was looking for something to make up for the love that i cannot get from my home.  someone to remember me and hold on to.  i honestly thought i was "in love".  but that wasn't what i wanted.. though i thought i did.  i wanted to be hugged.  i wanted to be wanted.  i wanted to feel appreciated.  it was the affection that i could not find at home.  that was the love that i longed for.  i'm smarter now.  i know what to expect and what to not ask for.  i'm wiser.  sigh.  that's it for now.  i'm done.

       this is a random topic.  ha!  wow.  kris?  random?  who would have thought!  anyways.  i've noticed alot that people always have to tell me "hold up, i gotta restart!" or "hey my comp is messin up!" whenever they're IMing me.  and i know... its terrible but i laugh.  my computer never messes up.  it hardly ever crashes.  as a matter of fact i dont think that the computer has EVER crashed... i've had a few apps go out on me but i've never had the computer crash.  so what sets me apart from the others.  oh i use a Mac.  lol.  i know everyone's like "eww yucky Macs!"  typical answer.  i really think people misunderstand Macs.  especially today's Macs... i must say they are very nice.  most people actually shun the Mac even though they've never used one.  i can say i've used both... i still do.  and after lookin at both for awhile i've come to the conclusion that my Mac is so much less of a problem.  the Dell laptop?  crashes all the time.  constantly havin to restart and it hasnt even been plugged into the internet.  that thing is virus clean and has none of these buggy programs on it... but it still crashes.  my eMac?  everything just works.  i turn it on and start goin.  i have my email client, browser, instant messanger, my iTunes, and whatever else i want open and the thing just doesnt crash.  i mean even if i tried i probably couldnt make it crash... i'm sure someone smarter than me could eventually crash it but so far i havent figured it out.  of course this all boils down to what your computer is running.  My eMac runs Mac OS X Panther.  where as pc's usually are running Windows XP.  i can honestly say that Mac OS X is MUCH more stable and gives MUCH less problems than Windows XP.  now some people say "Well I can do more on a PC than I could on a Mac!"  lol... obviously someone who has not used a Mac lately.  granted there are things that PC's can do that Mac's cant... but those things are usually just stupid little useless functions that no one uses.  personally, i'd rather have a computer that can actually DO the basic stuff than one that has a bunch of bells &amp; whistles but still cant do my basic functions without crashing

       sang  Beyond The Sea  today... got a standing-o too... made me very happy.  but other than that i'm feeling very drained.  my emotions hurt.  if that makes sense.  ha... probably not... i dont make sense.  i dont really mean that i'm hurt.. though in a way i am.  but i just mean that i'm so emotionally drained that it hurts.  oh there!  that sounds so much clearer!  i'm really sick of all my feelings.  and i'm tired of being "sensitive".  supposedly this is a good thing.  i must be missin somethin cuz i see absolutely no benefit in being a sensitive guy.  course what am i gonna do?  its the way i am.  i think everyone has this problem where they wanna be part of something.  to feel wanted and belong to somethin.  i cant say that i dont belong to anything.  but it feels alot like i dont.  very lonely.  its no one's fault... its just that everyone has their bestfriends.  everyone has their group.  not that i dont have friends... but i dont feel really that close to any of them.  i mean there is L... and i can always talk to her.  but even she has those other people she's probably closer to.  oh and Laura Beth is a great friend too but still... not as close as i've had before.  ha... Kari was the last person i felt totally open with.  she was a great friend... the closest friend i ever had.  i guess thats what i'm lookin for still.  someone to fill the void left by her.  not to say that i havent had great friends... cuz all my friends are wonderful.  i just want more... that sounds selfish i know... but everyone seems to have that one person who they tell everything... that they trust with anything.  i want that so bad... again.  man.. i sound so depressed.  i think its time for some Canon in D... its good for the soul.

       i really have nothin to write about tonight.  no one is talkin to me online cuz they're all busy.  it seems that lately everyone is "too busy".  not that i'm complainin.  cuz its not like i have a right to have anyone pay attention to me... its just nice, yanno?  so yeah anyways.  my throat hurts still from singin today.  in choir we had like me and this kid Nathan singin tenor and the rest of our section didnt!  i was like come on guys!  i shouldnt have to hurt my voice to give us some volume.  if we  ALL  sing then we will sound good!  it makes me mad cuz like we are the  advanced  choir and i cant hear any  advanced  tenors besides myself and Nathan!  ugh.  come on.  i've been real moody lately.  i've started to become a kind of mad person.  i dont like it.  like everything makes me mad.  including myself.  i'm really very mad at me.  i wish i could just like take myself back to the drawing board and redo me.  make myself differently.  top of the list.. we're gonna get rid of this pathetic fear of rejection.  ha... i need one of those extreme makeovers for my personality.  that'd be great.  i guess i should be "happy" with the way God made me... man that sure is tough one.  its frustrating.  but anyways... i did pretty good for not havin nothin to write about.  ha.  i think its time for some zzz's.  night.

       i'm watchin this thing on ABC about Jesus and how he  MIGHT  have been married to Mary Magdalene.  and man its makin me sick.  i hate these tv shows where reporters interview "experts" about religious stuff and they just make Christianity to be stupid.  they are so full of crap.  it makes me so mad!  they try so hard to make Jesus like a man.  here they're saying that Jesus was married to Mary who was a "loose woman".  its like they're tryin to say that the  SON OF GOD  was married to a prostitute.  and this whole story is based on some research that was done for that book  The Da Vinci Code .  but i mean really.  this is so stupid.  the  INSPIRED WORD OF GOD  never says they were married.  now if some of the book says so then wouldnt that fall under that part of the Bible that says that anything that contradicts the Word is false.  now sure the Bible doesnt say that Jesus wasnt married to Mary... but it does say that Jesus was sinless.  that he was pure.  now name me a pure man that was married to a whore.  and yes i just said whore.  i am really fired up bout this.  it makes me so mad when people try and analyze all this and start makin stuff up just cuz they wanna good story.  but what other purpose would it serve to know that Jesus was married than to undermine his divinity.  oh my goodness!  now they just said that there are holes in the Bible!  who do they think they are!   THERE ARE HOLES IN A BOOK THAT GOD WROTE ?!  ugh!  some people!  goodness... just wanna take some people by the hair and just shove their face in a Bible... maybe they'll read it!  oh wait its gettin better!  now they are talkin bout other "gospels" that are not in the Bible.... hmmmm wonder why?  you think maybe if they were inspired by God that they would  BE IN THE BIBLE !  ok thats it... i'm done for now.  i could go on for hours but i'm gonna have to go to bed.  so yes... night kids.  sleep well.  oh and by the way.. on this show full of crap, they are now saying that Mary Magdalene was an "apostle".  can you spell S-T-U-P-I-D?

       so today was awful at school.  it was soooo boring.  i had a precal test... i'm pretty sure i did good... it was easy thankfully.  and then in ap history i thought Mr Reynolds would jsut never stop talkin... i was about to fall asleep it was so boring!  and he repeats himself like 50 gazillion times.  i honestly think he just forgets what he's already said cuz he's like  ANCIENT .  choir was fun as usual.  we're singin some weird song that i dont like though... its called  White Horses  and its just plain weird.  the lyrics make no sense.  then we're singin an old jazzy song called  Stormy Weather .  i love it.  mom likes that song... so i've heard some of it before.  i love all those old songs.  especialy the old jazz and blues stuff.  i love that music.  after school Davida and i have decided that we're just gonna hang out in Mrs Rimes's room till the parking lot clears since its a madhouse out there.  So we just go and play some piano.  well i play piano.  ha!  Davida walked out for a minute and i started play  100 Years  on the piano and she comes runnin back cuz she thought i was Mrs Rimes playin the piano!  hahaha!  talk about a compliment!  well then i got Mrs Rimes to play  Beyond The Sea  from Finding Nemo.  she said i could probably sing it as a solo for our next concert.  but i sang it... the first time i sang it i guess i wasnt too loud cuz she asked me to sing it again with more force... so i did.  she said it sounded really good.  so yase.. i'm excited bout singin that song.  i love it.  one of my new favorites.  anyways.  cant wait for church tonight.  i absolutely love church.  sigh.  God & piano.  what i love in life.  the 2 most consistent things i know of.  they never fail.  well piano's might sometimes.  but still... they never fail to make me happy so that works.  i think i shall go play some piano now.

       i couldnt be a cop.  no way.  i know i'd probably just lose my temper and kill someone.  i was watchin this "reality" tv show about NYPD cops.  oh goodness... the where tryin to catch some gang members that gang-raped and beat a 15 yr old retarded girl.  ugh.  it made me so mad i was crying.   why do people do that ?    why  ?  i just dont understand!  where is the respect in this world?  where is the decency?!  how can people be so cruel!  so  selfish !  they just use people like that.  abuse people like that.   INNOCENT PEOPLE !  its not fair!  it just makes me sick.  but i dunno if i could control myself i was one of those cops.  i promise it  would  cross my mind that i could kill this person... man.. just ticks me off.  blah.  anyways.  i bought the "Beyond The Sea" song from the end of Finding Nemo.  i love that song!  its awesome!  i wanna sing it as a solo at our next choir concert.  hopefully the Rimes will let me.  well i think its time for some Zzzzz's.  night.

       random topic time.  woohoo!  ok now dont get tooo excited!  tonights topic comes from television.  well really its more like commercials.  ok.  when i'm watching my shows... which is rarely... but still when i'm watchin my shows i  DO NOT  wanna see some commercial bout tampons or bras or anything else!  ok... i mean really.  why do they have commercials for those kinds of things?   WHY ?!?!  come on!  every girl who  wants  to use a tampon knows which kind she's gonna buy... or she doesnt really care and just buys whatever she picks up first... so  why do we have tampon commercials ?!  and yeah i know the "tv people" try and put  girly  commercials with the  girly  tv shows... but really... do they think that i wanna see those silly tampon commercials when i'm watchin CSI?  uhhhh... how bout not!  oh and then there's those bra commercials.  like the Victoria's Secret ones.  now do i really need to be seein a bunch of girls in their bras talkin bout how "comfortable" they are and how much "support" they offer.  i mean  PLEASE !  i dont wanna know!  and i mean honestly... when they make those Victoria's Secret commercials are they makin them  only  for women?  or do they have guys in mind too?  sex sells... remember?  oh yeah... and i  think  that most girls probably already have decided what kinda bra they're gonna where?  why do we need commercials about them?  girls  ALREADY  buy them... who else are they tryin to sell bras too...  huh ?!  so the bottom line?  can we just cut all these  girly  commercials... there is really no point for them.  they are just  waaaaaaaaaaay  too much info.  goodness... just please  spare me .     my iTunes  >>   urlLink Beyond The Sea

       oh yes folks... its random topic time.  tonights topic kinda popped into my head last night.  have no clue why... but it was one that irked me so i thought i best write bout it.  ha.. you're lucky though cuz i almost forgot about it during the course of a horrid day at school.  anyways... here goes.  alright.  it really really  irks  me when guys refer to their girlfriends as "my girl".  i dunno.  maybe its just me.. but that almost makes them sound like property.  or like they're somethin that is yours.  and girls are  not property .  again... this all may just be me.  girls are just as independent as guys.  they can make their own decisions.  you dont have to lord over them and try and "protect" them.  now i dont mean that you dont try and protect them if they're gettin bullied around or somethin.  but there is such thing as  overprotective .  thats kinda where it gets a bit outta hand.  where a guy totally freaks out if his girlfriend even talks to another guy.  i guess this kinda goes back to that gettin too serious stuff.  yanno... people get all "oh i'll love you forever" and junk and they get this idea in their head that their girlfriend/boyfriend is "theirs".  i dunno bout you... but i am  no one's  till i am married.  that girl will be the only one i ever call  my girl .  so yeah... lets cut the "my girl" junk.  they are  not yours .  you have no right to be with them.  they are  giving  you a chance.  they are  letting  you be there boyfriend.  so show some  respect .  give them the respect they deserve.  and dont say they're "yours".  dont treat them like they are somehow bound to you.  cuz they can leave you  whenever  they want.  there's nothin stoppin them.  if anything is... it sure isnt you.  so yes.  and i'm not sayin that guys should be insensitive or anything like that.  lol.. you will  never  here somethin like that come from my mouth.  just try and be a better guy by not bein so overprotective and possessive.  well thats it for my ramblings tonight.  well actually i may post somethin else later... but whatever.       my iTunes  >>   urlLink Come On
