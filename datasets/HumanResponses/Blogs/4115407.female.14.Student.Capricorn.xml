       Today freakin sucked, i couldnt get my ears pierced because my dad and step mom was in a accident, nobody was seriously hurt but i was put off for one day. U might think that im being selfish about this but u dont get it, every time i want sumthing, or want to go sum where sumthing always comes up, and im so sick of that. I never get to do or get anythin its like it always happens to me. I mean wut did i do to deserve this, and this is not even about my ears anymore, it never really was im so fed up with this. It has been goin on as long as i can remember which is a while. I dont wanna say im ready to grow up but i am so nobody can stop me from doin sumthing, ill be able to drive so nobody cant say they tired or maybe next week or sum like that. I can do whatever i want when i want oh wow im starting to stress myself out again, im just ready to go home so i can go to school and get out of school and move out of new jersey, im not concered about leaving friends i mean i will keep in touch and visit them, i think the only thing i would have a problem with is that if i still have the boyfriend i have now or get another one ( im not sayin im am, i mean anythin can happen, but i dont want it to anyway) but he is either coming with me or im srry to say its over unless he is like in nevada or sum state close. But ima be real i cant have a long distance relationship, i mean wuts the point of havin a bf when u can only talk to him on the phone, u would never be able to kiss him or hug him or do anything else i mean thats gay thats y i think thta goin out with ppl over the internet is dumb to, srry no offense to anyone, but there is no point. I mean sum ppl probably can but i cant cause its dumb. And u kno wut else is dumb cybering and phone sex, i mean that is the most dumbiest thing. Its stupid there is no point y would u want to want to talk about it or even type about it. I mean if u got the nerve to do that u might as well do it. I mean y would u wanna talk about to make u horney, i mean doesnt that make it worse, i mean im sure there are other ppl just like u, i wouldnt kno im jus usin common sense. And u kno wut elseeverybody blames all the rappers and stuff for having girls in they videos and men and strip clubs and stuff, i mean dont they realize that women are not forced against their will to dance or be on tv half naked its their choice, they make the desicion to degrade ( if u dont kno wut that means look it up) themselves, so all the falut shouldnt be on men, even though they are not in the right either for encouraging it. I mean videos and men have put alot of girls self esteem down. I mean all they talk about is having a "fat ass" and all these curves and everything thing else i mean girls are using butt implants as if breast implants wasnt enough, girls feel they have to look a certain way to impress sum body or fit in, like they have to wear degrading clothes for boys to notice you, i mean im not talking about me or nobody else i kno, i dont have to dress half naked for nobody and i dont or look a certain way 4 nobody and im fine ppl dont think im ugly and i really dont care if they think i do or not, nuthin is wrong with me and every girl should feel like that, the only person they should be pleasing is themselves and if they have a boyfriend or husband, but only if they accpet u 4 who u are and are not makin u go through sum surgery to look a certain way or change the way u dress to show more or sum stupid stuff like that, men are such dogs sumtimes, but not all are like that and ull be lucky if u find sumbody thats not. And the bad thing is u cant live with out them unless ur a homosexual ( Faget and lesbian are not nice to say)

       Today i was bored i thought i was getting my ears pierced but i am tom. so today i was just on the computer and thinkin as u can c i think this is my 3rd blog today, lol. Sometimes i think too much and then the stuff i was really happy with all of a sudden i wasnt cause i thought of all of the bads things that can happen, i always done that, i sumtimes i wish i didnt cause i might can lose sumthing really good. Like with relationships, i thought about got happy and was ok ima do it, then i kept thinkin and was no, jus like with health science tech. i thoguht of all the work and stuff, but i mean i lost an oppertunity. I have to stop sumtimes, cause im doin it this very second, i dont know why, but maybe every time i thought sumthing good was gonna happen, it didnt, sum 1 didnt keep their promise or sum crap like that. I keep thinkin about all the possible bad stuff that can happen 2 me at franklin like i could get stabbed, or even jumped by sum gang but im not scared im just worried i mean if i get shot then wut. Then i keep thinkin about how im not goin 2 the same high school as none of my friends and that they will forget about me cause that happens 2 me alot, they stop calling or inviting me places, but then again i do to. But if i really wanna keep them then i wont. Im worried that since me and my bf arent goin i mean i trust em, but i mean wut if he finds naother girl there and drops me like he did to this other one, if i was her i would have tooken that out on him, but then again i cant take it out on no one, because im sure he didnt want to like the person on purpose, then again i dont kno that either, i wouldnt kno wut would go on in school, i would jus trust the person hope that they woudnt do me like that. But im not a jealous person i dont care as long as hes not cheating i dont care. I do but, no to that point where u can talk to no girl at all. I jus need sum 1 to talk 2 i wanna go home so i can talk 2 my momma ( yea i call her momma, so wut sue me). Im making my self sad lol, but then again i jus laugh it of which i hate doin sumtimes cause ppl dont always take u seriously. Im happy im leavin friday i cant be away from my house for to long, i dont like stayin down here with them except for my aunt or godmom, but i mean i cant do stuff my way, i mean they claim its my " second house" but i mean i sumtimes have to ask permission to eat, i mean give me a break, but i think thats because its two babies in the house but that doesnt mean that. And i cant really ell them i dont eat stuff like pork, i dont eat pork cause its not healthy, ( except 4 bacon once in a while, but not often) and i member i told them that and they looked at me like i was crazy, i dont eat hot dogs either, but my mom respects that, if she cooks and i dont like it, she'll let me eat sumthin else, but here its different, i dont care im not movin back down here, cause im stayin in nj for high school then im goin 2 califorina, so my dad can keep dreaming. I miss my mommy, i mean she is so easy to talk to, and she is nothin like my dad i, he is so like over protectingmtimes. But if i have any kinda problem i can talk to her, i mean even about my chores and stuff, she says im sneaky sum times cause i dont tell her everything at once, but im not i can be sneaky but in a bad way, like sneakin food in my room way. well i was kinda when i started having a bf, she didnt ask so i didnt tell her, but i guess she got the clue w/e its not big thing. I mean she like gives u all the freedom like a 14 yr. old can have only because she can trust me and she kno i wont do nuthin stupid. And its sad cause i never go no where, i mean there is no 1 2 play with outside, it always my sister goin 2 new brunswick, i couldnt cause i had 2 babysit. And im glad that if i do sumthin or left sumthin that she will be there, like the time when i had left my cap and gown at the lib. me and xianne thought we were goin back but then i went sumwhere and saw my mom to ask her if i could stay, she was like yea, then i was like but my cap and gown is at the lib. so she was like well go back and get it when u pick ur sister up so i said ok. So i got there and i wasnt there i was like omg where is it so i was up and down new brunswick lookin 4 it. I finally c my mom and she was all quiet, and i didnt wanna tell her yet until i called xianne to see if she had mine, well i get home and was like oh ya cap and gown in the house, i was like wut! omg u had me in this car worried when u had it. I was so relieved she always finds a way to get me, and she always fins out wut im doin, i mean she could be an 1 hr. away from me, i mean in a different state, btu she still kno, not the exact details, but she kno sumthin, thats kinda scary. Im not thinkin no more but im still worried, and i need to stop worrying my self about stuff like that cause its nuthin compared to other stuff like me being pregnant or getting a std or disease or sumthin serious like that.   But im gonna listen to my music cause that helps me out.

        Ok, just to clear up things on my last blog, I am obssed or w/e with vampires, and I dont have a problem with the govenor being gay, i mean i dont have a problem with them at all male or female, i have a problem with them not respecting my sexuality and tryning to turn me gay, thats not cool at all, i wont try and make u from not being gay, so dont do it to me. Also alot of people call me mean, i am not mean i just have a opinion like every one else i am not cruel in any way, and people to think that i am, i am also well, im still tryna figure out werid, well i really dont care i mean apparently im not that weird if i have friends and a boyfriend that claims there not weird, lol anyway im not shy either, i hate when ppl say im shy im not shy im just quiet until someone's sparks the conversation, as u can see i dont have the greateset social skills but i can really care less. Another reason is that ppl always think im getting smart, but being smart and sarcastic are two different things, i dont get smart and im not mean i just state my opinion and yea so wut i always got sumthing to say i wouldnt be anisa if i didnt. And it pisses me off or when ppl say me and my sister look alike cause we dont at all and we are nothing alike, ppl think im always mean to her, trust me im not, usually the big sister always has the mood swing problems and gets attitudes with the little sister, well were opposite she always like that 2 me with the attitude and mood swings, but i let her it doesnt matter to me as long as she doesnt touch, cause as soon as she does its over and she cant win an argument well not with me, and if she wont do sumthin that i told her to do i tell my mom yeap ima snitch well im not like that, but with her i have to, cause her little friends got her like that thinkin she grown and that she dont gotta listen, so i tell my mom to get my way, cause my mom already kno how she is, and they is no other way for her to stop unless u hit her hard enough to kno that ur not playin, if she pushes me to that point i have to do that, hey she asked for it. one teacher was Ms. Powell she assumed that i was sum quiet little girl to myself, but she assumed and didnt kno me and misunderstood me and thats her fault 4 assuming. And my dad id kinda like that, he's not around me long enough to find out how i am so he thinks all this stuff, but still i really dont care. And im glad that im "weird" w/e that means and i have karina and shanae to thank, because if i would have hung out with ashley or buddah or any of them any longer they probaly would have drove me crazy with all that crap they talk and then all the back stabbing then look u right in ur face and say im ur friend omg that will drive any 1 crazy. And then my coach, he didnt kno me either, he thought that i was sneaky because i didnt really talk in front of him then with my friends i would and he called me nonchalant, w/e that means i dont feel like looking it up. So as u can c im really misunderstood, oh and after 4 yrs. of negociating ( my spelling is off today srry, cant think) i can finally get my freakin ear pierced, now im not goin another 4yrs. for the top of my ear, nope, im slicing the time in half or sooner, i hope.   Oh any my legs hurt so bad, this working out thing is not cool at all.

        Omg i am like a horror movie fien this summer usually half the stuff i watched i could never watch but its like a breeze now nuthin scares me or gets me thinking about stuff anyway, i have fell in love with vampires, i mean like i want to be a vampire so bad sumtimes, like if sum 1 would give me a choice i would be one. I mean like usually boys in movies woudnt be cute or anything at all to me, but if theyre a vampire then like all of a sudden they are, like being a vampire is like soo wuts the word um, sexy thats it, i sound like a total idoit right now but i really dont care and no im not sum vampire freak or anythin i jus think that being a vampire is cool, wut is wrong with me, im like turning white no offense, i dont care if i am just because i like to listen to sum rock and pop but that doesnt mean anythin so stop stereotyping me! ok, anyway.   Have u ever ever like seen ur parent kiss, omg that is soooooo nasty even when i was little i would run to the other run, but i mean my dad and step mom is jus like ewww, i mean like ur old now u still cant do the same things i mean especially in front of me, i mean him grabbing her a** was jus so un nessesary, i mean i kno ur married or w/e but i mena old ppl shouldnt be allwoed to do it after a certain age limit, its ok for every 1 under 30, in my opinion i mean, they can kiss or w/e but the stuff they do its like not needed for other ppl to see. And our governer is gay, lol, thats not funny but i mena wut is the world comin 2 i mean seriously.

I mean that is too much, i want well i think i wanna have kids, im not sure about that, but if i do i want to have them in my early 20's, and i cant do that if im always in school, but i am not having kids after 30, 30 is the limit. But i think i wanna be open to other things, i wanna find sumthing that i wanna be happy doin. I wanna love to go to work every moring i dont know im just confused.

       Today i saw my high school schedule, and i was disapointed, they only classes they gave me that i wanted was geometry, but they didnt give me any of my advanced classes that i should have got, im really pissed cause im not about to do the same crap over, and i wanna be on the same level as all my friends i dont wanna be behind, i wanna be ahead of them, but im gonna tell my mom to go up there and fix it before i start school, so it wont be any problems im going with her this time and bringing my new brunswick schedule show where i am suppose to be. Beacuse if i dont get any of my advanced classes or credits, then what was the whole point of me being in TAG, i mean Ms. N said that i doesnt matter what high school i go to i should still get my credits and classes.

       i've been hearing about alot of relationship provlems lately, and im not talkin about only u karina, i mean i watch how my dad and my stepmom relationship is, i hear about my other friends problems. I mean i hope i never have to deal with a physical abuse relation cause if i do im kickin his butt first then im leaving him lol, but im glad that i have a bf that wont well he said he wouldnt and i believe him, that wont hit me, i mean when i hear that girls have been killed by their boyfriends that pisses my off, cause they shoudnt hace stayed in the abusive relationship to the point where he killed u, im mean u may love him, but he doesnt love u if he is willin 2 kill u, y would u want a man that puts his hands on. There is also the relationships where only the boys want sum, but dont want u for ur personality, i mean a girl can be attractive but dont waste a girl's time 4 that, im glad he isnt like that either, i dont think he is, i hope he isnt. Im jus glad i found sum 1 that would treat me right, i mean this summer i think i saw him like twice, but that was because i was doin stuff, and he wasnt here, then i wasnt there, but i think i kno him enough to kno that he wouldnt do that. Even though he can get moody and ignore me but, im sure he doesnt do it on purpose and i dont mind if he does, i mean i do, but i dont it a big deal, i rather him ignore me than yell at me, or abuse me mentally or physically. I hope that it works out, but even if it does during high school will it during college, cause im goin 2 college and im goin 2 california, and i dont think his parents would want him follwong sum girl, but maybe we will move together, i hope, that would be cool, if we did. But im greatful, and i hope that all my friends and family could work out or meet the person who would treat them right.

       This blogger thing really works, i got sumthin i can write my ideas or w/e im thinkin on here, anyway lol. There are good things and bad things about being a girl, and it sucks cause there is nuthin really bad about being a boy when u think about. But nooooooo there had to be alot of things bad, i mean girls have to get this dumb period well im gonna be mature and use the proper word " menstral cycle " thing which is soooooooo stupid cause it just gets a whole bunch a young girls pregnant cause they think their grown, then they have to push a freakin body out of this tiny hole, i mean see this is all adam and eve's fault, if she wouldnt have been dumb to eat that freakin fruit, we girls, women w/e would never have any pain but nooooooooooo she jus had to do it, and dumb adam went along with it, anyway lol, being a girl sux so much, we get like no respect, sum boys just think of us is to cook for them and to clean and to freakin have their kids, which sum dont even take care of, sum dont think that were weak and that we cant certain stuff as them, but if u look at it, we have the babies and thats alot of pain doing that, i bet they couldnt do that now could they. We had to fight for all of our rights, and today we dont even get respect, then we get pregnant at liek 16, were considered a hoe, but nooo they dont pay attention to the boy who went    right along with her to get her pregnant now do they, nope. Even though, we dont get treated right sumtimes, and we have to go through alot of sh**, we still have sum ups, we can get out of alot stuff, we can talk our way into getting anything we want from men, and sum people go easy on us, (even though that still sux), but if u look at it, it is kinda nice knowing that u are bringing another life into the world, i guess? U kno wut it is kool being a girl, ( well kinda, depends on how the way u look at it) we are much smarter than boys i dont care wut nobody says and stronger, cause if they were so smart then they would take care of their freakin kids, and think twice b4 they get sum 1 pregnat, ugh now that i think about it, sum boys are such dogs,  i mean all they want it sex, not all sum, so i happy im not like that. Im sure im not the only girl that has felt like being a gurl sux .

        when i was  little  i was insecure with my self, but now im not, and im glad to have a name that freakin people couldnt get right for the past six years, and then when i get to a class who can say my name right, they didnt want to call me that but im not gonna get into that. As for me......... im fine with myself. I like to play sports and get dirty but im not a tomboy, i dont like dressing liek a boy, or acting like one, i jus like proving a point that sumtimes girls and better and stronget than boys thats all lol, i still like to go shopping, but im also not a girly girl, i dot go to a pool and sit in it and scream if my hair gets wet, or dress up and wear skin tight jeans when im goin to the movies or go to a game, i mean like its really not that serious u can look nice but sum of the people i used to hang out with took it over the extreme, sumtimes outside of school they would wear sumtimes jeans and shirts sooo tight it didnt even look like they can breathe, anyway, i cant do that i have to able to breathe, and if im not comfortable in it im not wearing it, thats y i never wear dresses( except for sum summer dresses) or wear shoes with heels, im fine with sneakers.... My friends, well associates, the people who automatically put me int their little clique which i really wasnt in, was bad influences but i never got influenced i dont think, no or i would be sum where flirting and always lookin for sum boy, thats all they ever talked about that and how theyre onn their freakin perios d like i really wanna hear that, then when i saw sumthin or make a face they be like wut u didnt get it yet, its not that but i mean who wants to sit there and talk about, i kno i dont, and i mean there like kinda the best hypocrites u will ever meet, im not talking about them im jus tellin the truth, they will sit there and talk about this girl when she is not there and then the next day they smile in her face like it was nuthin, then when she do sumthin, they all say we aint to her, but at sumbody's swimming party who were they all over. And they are the same way with sex i mean they talk all nasty liek they experts, but when they find out that sum 1 really did it eww u nasty i would never go that far, or they a hoe, i mena give a break, anyway im jus glad that im away from that, and i didnt wanna hang out with the other girls cause they was all stuck up and to tell the truth, u kno wut no ima be quit, about them cause they just make them self look really stupid not likin me and callin god knows wut over sum dumb boy that dont freakin like u, ( no offense to the dumb boy lmao, jus saying, ur not dumb, dont take it offensivly) i mean sum girls are jus so ignorant, i would never do that to another person jus because he like another girl and not me, u didnt do it on purpose i dont even think u can make a boy like u, well i dont know, but they shoudnt hold grugdes on me they should hold them on him, or be like a mature 14 yr. old and get over it, hey that sounds like a good idea! Sum girls can be soooo immature, and im goin to stop cause im not being right either talking about em but so freakin wut, ok im done. lol

           This world has changed so much our socitey is so different and more riskful. Most adults say oh please i was 15 once, yea um that was about 40 yrs. ago, i mean society has changed so much, kids and teens have changed. Now we just dont have to worry about maybe just getting hit by a car, we have to worry about rape, drugs, AIDS, STDs and alot more. Adults dont have the slightest idea wut it feels like to be a teen in this society now, they never walked down the street and had grown men yellin at them, i mean grown men give me a break, sum men are just dogs. They have no idea wut it feels like to go to school have have boys just come up and touch and talk to you however they like, ( just from wut i see, cause if they touch me they kno they getting their a** kicked) they never know how it feels to be presseured to have sex, or to take drugs, they dont even know the conversations half of us teen even be talking about. I just hate when adults try to compare their lives and say they know how we feel, because they dont have the slightest idea of wut goes in school, and after school, if they would just take one day in my shoes or any other teen now, they would give us some slack, well my mom probably wouldnt even let me out of the house again lol, but this world is sooo dangerous, i mean now i see why u should wait till have sex until ur married, no i havent done anything, but my friends have made mistakes have gotten theirself into problems, first of all, u cant even find a boy to trust, boys now jus wanna (excuse me language but this is a real quote) "hit it" and go tell their friends. And now girls have to worry about getting pregnant, or catching aids or sum nasty STD..... anyway, its jus my opinion that adults dont have the slighteset idea of wut their talkin about, and i wish they could stop assuming and judging us without even seeing wut we have to go through everyday.

       When I entered TAG sometime happened, I heard, someone had a secret crush on me ( well not for long) but I was just as clueless, then I heard rumors, but I thought no he has a girlfriend, later I found out that he broke up with her over sill little me (lol). Now the next year the secret had spread like a nuclear bomb over some stupid little juice. And I had made some enemies and which I still don't really know why. Anyway I found out and to be real I didn't know what to do, so when he asked me out as a clueless person would do I said no, i didn't even know we never talked at all, so its like the boy down the street who u have never met before coming up to you and saying I like you a lot would you go out with me? So I started talking to him, I started to get to know him a little better, he asked again and I said no, then he told it was because I was afraid of a commitment and a relationship and now that I think about it I was because I have never had a real boyfriend before. So we continued to talk he still continued to like me and I had no control over that. Then there was a last time that he he asked me, I was like no im srry and I know I really pissed him off that time, (im not gonna go into details cause this person doesn't even know im writing about him). So we contiued to talk and I continued to convince myself that I didn't like him, but after a while when ur hangin out with sum one u cant help it. So the eighth grade dance came up and I convinced myself that I wasn't going with him, but then I thought its the least I can do so we went. Then we went to the movies the movie was whack so I fell asleep tthen i woke up and he was on my shoulder i guess it was ok cause he was sleep so i left him alone. Then the next we went to the movies again, and like right in the middle of the movie he just like asked me out. So i guess something persuaded him that i kinda felt sumthing for him cause he dont it again, and if i felt like i said no that i would be acting really stupid, so i said yea, after months and months pf saying i didnt feel for him, i found out that i did, i said hey i never gave him a try so let me. So i was a big girl and said yes and stopped being afraid of a commitment, and nuthin's wrong with me im still alive and now i have a boyfriend. (who better still like or im gonna kick his a** , lol, jp) Even though we are not goin to the same school we will be fine i have to get my friend to watch in case he gets any ideas cause i know have girl's boyfriends get when they are not around.

       I was born Anisa Nicole Williams, i was named after my aunt who was mentally retarted.... ...great huh? I am now 14 years and getting ready to attend highschool. When i was younger i really didnt like who i was, i wanted to be somethiing else or to look like something else. I always wondered why couldnt i have soft and long hair like her, or why couldnt i have hazel eyes, or why it was always me to be the tallest or the biggest one in the class. I was never greatful for what i had, i was never greatful for always making good grades. I' ve done alot of dumb stuff in my short 14 years, i've played around with serious stuff that shouldn't be played with, i never took oppertunities that could have helped me later on. I was never able to accpet myself for who i was i always wanted to be that skinny girl on tv, or that girl who was mixed with something else besides being all african American. I always hated my name and think why couldnt i have a simple name like ashley or jessica. But now as i am maturing mentally ive come to realize that my eye color my height, my weight, my name were all fit for me, god made me not to always be the skinniest or to have the least common name, or to have the nappiest hair, and now i can accept that am i am glad to be that i am glad to be "weird" or to be quiet, or even to be misunderstood. So like it or not because this is who i am.
