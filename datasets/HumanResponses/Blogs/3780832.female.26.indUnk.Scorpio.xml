      Dear you,  I don't know why it is easier to start these off as letters but it seems to keep the words flowing I think. I hate the human resources lady at my job. I don't think she understands people. She is by the books though strictly. But so much that she has trouble comprehending that people are real and they have feelings as well as breathing.   I should be asleep right now. It's 1am but i am too worried about getting my kitchen clean! So what am I doing here? Well I'll tell you. I am the type of person that has trouble getting ideas out of her head. They nag and nag me until i do somehting about it. Of course if I was cleaning I wouldn't have time to think about anything other than cleaning. I hate to clean. I let it build up too much.  I need to paint the walls in this house! I need to get the extrerminator here also. I need this I need that. Does the list ever end? I don't think it does. My kitchen sink needs to be fixed as well. It keeps getting stopped up.   Some day I might be ready to write some personal things here. But I am too worried about someone I know reading it then telling someone else and so on. Is it worth the trouble?   Well i am actualy going to get off of my butt now and go do the main thing I need to do which is the main reason I am not in bed! CLEAN! Arg. Ugh.  Goodnight maybe. I might be back.

      Dear you,  Well I was in bed last night unable to sleep and I came to a decision. I am going to start a blog and just write down whatever I am thinking about or how my day was, is or will be going, my plans, my dreams.. In general whatever I am come up with when I feel like it.  I attened a friends wedding reception over the weekend. She looked so happy. And so thin!. I am happy for her and I can't help but feel a little bit of jealousy. It's like I want to be her but I really don't. It makes me wonder if I am ever going to have it. The reception was nice though even if a bit disorganized. I had a good time.  I get confused about life sometimes and I often get accused of not paing attention. I do pay attention but there is more than one thing to pay attention to and I don't think some people realize that. There is a list in my head of things that need to be done. Maybe a bit of day dreaming to do as well. But I am constantly thinking of a book I need to write. I have the talent for it and I think I am pretty creative but I have trouble putting my immagination into words that appear intresting. This my dear friend is where you come in. I am hoping to write and write and write until I can overcome this situation. Plus I think it will help me sleep at night.  Feelings are not something I am very good at discussing with others. I think maybe I might not trust them or it could be something else. I'm sure I need therapy. Anger is something I can do very well. Often I am accused of bottling up my feelings and hiding them away. Maybe so. My mom threw me in therapy every time I skiped school everytime I got into fight or when I yelled.  So maybe I just got tired of someone analizing me all the time. Or maybe I got tired of getting told everything is my fault. It's something I'm sure I need to figure out. In therapy. *laugh*.  Well maybe it's time to look at other things right now. Like cleaning the house. So i will write to you more later.

      Dear you,  I've been toying around with the idea of finishing a story I wrote long ago but I've never been ispired enough. Or maybe I am just lazy. No details about it here though until I at least have a first rough draft of a chapter! I am working on profiles now because I need to define the characters so I have somnething to run with when they appear. Then I will likely start into it. I dunno I might change my mind and not even have an outline. Who knows!

      Dear you,  For the past few months I have been trying out various different color types on my hair. I've been blond, red, white.. orange. I've decided that the only color for me is beau-TI-ful brown! I need a haircut now.My hair is entirely too thick and needs to be layerd or I look like one of those cartoon kitty's who has just went through the dryer and had been fluffed! Just call me fluffy!  My foot is still broken. For some unknown reason last night at work I felt a pain race up the bottom of my foot through my ankle. It felt like I had stepped on a stick pin and it stayed that way for about fifteen minutes.    SUPRISE! An old online friend of mine contacted me through a message board the other day. I was so excited I don't think I stopped smiling for quite a while. Another friend recently described him as a Casanova. He definatly has a lot of charisma! We are now writting each other again by e-mail.    Well I have things to do and rest to get so I'm going to go for now. sorry that it has been so long.

      Dear you,  Have you ever thought what would happened if you had died? Or how you would die? I have dreams about my death. A car will crash into mine, while crossing a bridge it would collapse. My house would be getting vandalized and I would get shot. The worst one is me walking off a a high cliff or building. I'm not suicidal but that is the dream I can recall vivdly. One day soon I think I will write my will or a pretend one and tell you about it.   I was sitting with my two best friends a few months back having some drinks and we were talking about how our lives might have been different had we stayed close together in the same town we grew up in. I told them we would either be rich or in prision.! *laugh*  I went to see the firworks display last night. It lasted a good thirty minutes and i must say i can't remeber seeing one I had enjoyed more. Maybe it is because I am older now but I found new meaning in them other than pretty lights. The shapes were awesome. I wonder what they would have looked like if I was intoxicated.  I'm going to be late for work today. It's rather ironic because I had just told my boss I needed more hours or I would have to find another job. I feel pretty embarassed about the whole thing right now.   Well I have a few things to do. I also need to eat I am pretty hungry. I just need to find out what to eat! Yum!
