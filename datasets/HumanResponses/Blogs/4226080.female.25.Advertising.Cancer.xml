      Now that I've decided to post my wounds for all to see I migth as well get the introduction part out of the way...  Gosh, I act like someone is actually going to read this rubbish. Hhm...eh, what do I care, in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king, so nyah nyah.  Okay - um...yeah and GO!  Riiight...frick, this is like getting naked infront of someone for the first time. You giggle, you look at him (in my case him, sorry I dig dudes), and you think is he going to think my ass is big? Hhm...should I take off my bra? Hhm...then you say oh fuck it, he's so not thinking about that, he just wants to get laid. At that point you throw him down, take off his shirt start making out like a teenager and forget that you think you're J.Lo's lost cousin.  Right. Okay, commencing intensive making out - ahem...  So you come here often? Ugh.  Maybe tomorrow I'll get this. Today I'm rambling.  Rambling, to the point of insanity? Good question. Seeing as no one knows of my existence it doesn't matter much now does it? I suppose not. See that alone should be a motivating factor to let one rip, but how exactly does one give oneself persmission to do so after being all stingy like with feelings. What babble. Even I wouldn't read this crap.  Onto something interesting. Let's see...  1. No pets - fishy died 2. Sisters (33, 31) 3. Parents & Grandma 4. Cousin 5. Multiple dork friends  Yay - getting somewhere - I think. Is this a preamble towards some point? You wish - ha.  Lil something on me I suppose:  Height: 5'6.5 ft Weight: haha. Are you daft? I'm a girl, no dice. Eyes: Greenish Hair: Redish (not naturally though, but eh, being blond is boring) Body shape: Hour glass. Is that still acceptable these days? Fav bands: Radiohead - Thom have my baby Fav ice cream: Cherry, Mint chocolate chip, peanut butter...oooh Fav time to nap: 2pm. Napping is important, people should do it more often, I'm up for syncronized napping, or power couple napping. It ought to be a sport. Fav food: Chap chae bap. Korean noodles kick ass. Fav shows: Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, American Gothic (though it was on for like 1 season), Sailormoon, Unwrapped (food network show). I hardly watch tv, but when I do I find it's either cartoons or cooking. Semi warped I suppose. Shoe size: 9.5 - I got me them there canoes Likes: British rock, 50's-now popular crap. Trance, Electronica, Hip Hop...err..Hip Pop. None of this slow jam business, or rockabilly stuff. I think my ears would bleed. Yet I do like CSNY, so hhm...it's a fine balance I suppose. Camping, dancing, sleeping, eating new foods, trying new things, running through the mall with a paper bag on my head. Dislike: Poor grammar. Dear Lord, make it stop. Smelling bad, bad teeth, poor posture, dangerous behaviour inflicting pain, peppers - eww, cunts who think they're right and other lovely things.  Okay I've had enough - perhaps you have as well...funny that.
