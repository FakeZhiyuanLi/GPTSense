          Juz back from Sunday school. What fun. My friend told me a lot of jokes and i can't stop laughing. Some of the jokes i can say is dirty. But, mostly it is so funny. Lol. I will share with you some of the jokes:-   Little John (Part 1) &nbsp;   One day, Little John came to school. His teacher ask him, "There are 5 birds on a branch. If you throw a stone at one of them, how many birds will there be at last?" John said, "None. All the birds will fly away." The teacher thought for a while and said, "Hmmm. I like your way of thinking."   The next day, Little John came to school and ask his teacher a question, "There are 3 women eating ice-cream, one of them is licking it, the other one is sucking it and the remaining one, biting it. Which one of the women is married?" The teacher thought really hard. At last she said, "The woman sucking the ice-cream must be married."   Little John shook his head and said, "Wrong. The one wearing a wedding ring." Without pausing he continued to said, "But I like your way of thinking."   Little John (Part 2) &nbsp;   One day, Little John carrying a balloon, went out to see his garden. There, he met Sally, his next door neighbour. He teashed her about him having a balloon and she did not. Sally cried and went inside. Minutes later, she came out carrying a bigger balloon. "Haha, mine balloon is bigger than yours." Little John was so jealoused that he went back inside.   The next day, Little John rode a blue tricycle to his garden. Again, he met Sally and teased her about riding a bike and she didn't. Sally cried and went inside. Minutes later, she came out riding a pink bicycle. "Haha, I can already ride on two wheels but you needed three. Little John felt so humiliated that he went back inside.   The next day, Little John came out wearing nothing. Again, he met Sally and said while pointing at his private part, "I have this and you don't." Sally didn't cry this time but she came inside for a few minutes naked. She quickly point to her private part while saying, "I have this and my mummy said that I can have as many&nbsp;as your tail as&nbsp;I want when I grow up."   There you have it guys. Funny right? Haha. No offence.&nbsp;But, i will&nbsp;tell you more the next time i update. Cya.&nbsp;

          Yo guyz...sori for not updating since that lame joke tat i told ya. Life has been very interesting lately. Creating a football team doesn't seems easy with fuck up boys. They are so fark-up and i hate them. Wad a bunch of ass. The captain like shit. Whoever one of my boys reading this, hope u tell the others. They said that i create the team but i can't have a say in any matter. Wad a fark rite. Nvrmind lar, fuck those farkfaces. I don't care 'bout them anymore. Once i get my jersey numered 11, i'm going to quit for good. Later, i'll post a pic of a boy that i hate most. Fuck his ass lar, curry sauce. They think they so good. Juz now training, feel like beating him up sia. All play like fuck. No teamwork. My bo's team better. Nvrmind bout them. No mood to talk much...i mean type. Bye :(    He's the one in the green waga jersey untying his boot. I'm the one with the spiderman game.
