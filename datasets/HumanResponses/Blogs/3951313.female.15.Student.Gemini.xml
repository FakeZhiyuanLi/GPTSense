       Together Forever It's said in many forms with letters, numbers, symbols, whatever.  But do people really think of the meaning that it has?  Together yes we all know what it means One + One Two people Sharing their lives  Forever for all eternity never parting  Together Forever we say it whether it's friendships family boyfriends girlfriends  But do we really mean Together Forever?

       Love  It's true  I know it  I don't want to lose it   But  the pain  If it wasn't for him  I would do it  I would get lost  In the pain  Not enduring it  Just letting it  envelop me

       Happy.  It's a feeling  that I no longer recognize.  An emotion  that I have no contact with.   Numb.  I know this feeling.  Extremely well.  This emotion  I feel all day every day.   But the numb is lifting.  The happiness isn't coming through.  The pain is.   Pain.  It hurts.  Kills.  I wish.   I want to feel more.  I want the pain  to kill...  Me.

       I wonder  what's wrong with me  nowadays  I'm happy  and I laugh   I'm not so numb  It's starting to fade  My body, my soul  is reawakening   My friends notice  They smile and laugh  along with me  is this real?  Am I truly happy?  Or will I awake  just to find it all  to be a dream?  A glorious dream.   I wonder...

       He holds me  I never wanna move  He kisses me  it blows me away like the first time  He tells me he loves me  I wanna melt   You hold her  I'm sad  You kiss her  I'm angry  You tell her you love her  I'm crying   But I'm over you  I love him  He loves me  And you don't  I guess  It just sucks to be you   Your loss  I'm sorry

       She picks up the edge of her dress  He slips his hand in hers  And so it starts   They begin to move  across the floor  Every move reflecting  grace and beauty  Some not perfect  But they don't care   It's no contest  There's no prize  They just enjoy  Gazing into the others' eyes   They slow down  and will soon stop  this&nbsp;lovely dance   They'll then part  Taking separate paths  But you and I know  they will always remember  The look in that one's eyes   The one that said  "This won't fade,  I shall always love you"  And so it ends...  this beautiful dance,  and off they go.   Not crying, yet not smiling.  And so it ends...

       I see them  standing there  together  wrapped in each others' arms   I feel my insides dying  I want to cry  I want to scream  I want to explode into a million pieces   I run, as fast as I can  away from the scene  crying harder than ever   I walk in the room  See her standing there  Her lips still red  from his touch  The images rush back  and I burst into tears   I run again  I just want to run  and run until  my legs ache  and my heart pounds.

       Why did he say it  Why did he do this  He told me he loved me   Love  Why  Why damnit!  Why did he use that word!  WHY?!  That just made me  fall for him  even more   She said  she'd always be there  for me  That I could go to her  to talk  or vent   But now  She's with him  Love  I'm sure  he'll say it to her  It will hurt  I can't do it  I won't listen to him say that  not to her  Love...  WHY?!

       Suicide  Why don't I do it?  I come close  Oh so close  But I don't   Maybe I'm a chicken  Maybe I just don't want to  But I think I do  *sigh*   I don't know anymore  I guess I'm just...  weird  odd  strange   I don't know  I just want out  No matter how  I get there  Wherever "there" is  *sigh*  I don't know anymore  Strange, isn't it?

       I thought I was in love  I never thought I'd get hurt  Why would he lie?  Why can't I cry?   I want to be loved like never before  No more lying, no more crying  I don't want to be hurt anymore  I just want to be loved...   What's wrong with me?  Am I really that ugly?  Am I a whore or a bitch  or any of the other things he said?  Am I just not good enough?   I want to be loved like never before  No more lying, no more crying  I don't want to hurt anymore  I just want to be loved...   Maybe if I wear more makeup...  Maybe if I lose more weight...  Maybe if I just wear less...  Maybe he'll want me back...  Maybe...Someday...He'll love me again   I just want to be lovedâ€¦

       I watch it drip and flow  Slowly, Steadily  I know when to stop  But it feels so good   Who really cares if I am alive  Who really cares if I die tonight  Who really cares what I decide  There's no one to stop me  I'll end it tonight   I see the red  It doesn't hurt  They say it's bad  They tell me to stop  But they don't know  The feelings it brings  My life's not spinning  all over the place  I'm in control now   No one understands  No one cares  So no one will know...  I'll end it tonight...   No one will cry  No one will grieve  No one will notice  I'll end it tonight...

       I see him smile at me  I see the care in his eyes when he looks at me  Even though he hides it from others  I know he loves me   But why me?  Why must I be blessed and cursed at once?  Blessed with the gift of love,  yet cursed with two lovers  Why me?   He hugs me and kisses me softly  The warmth of his body envelops mine  He loves me and tells me often  openly, Unashamedly   But again why me?  Old words of truth come to mind as I ponder...  "My only love sprung from my only hate  Too early seen unknown &amp; known too late  Prodigious birth of love it is to me  That I must love a loathed enemy"

       Wipe away my tears  Don't make me cry  Kiss away my pain  Don't hurt me  Hold me in your arms  Don't push me away   I don't want perfect  I just want love  I don't want sex  I just want you   Relieve my stress  Don't cause it  If I'm not pretty  Don't judge me  We should fight  But let's keep it small   I'm shaking  Hold me  I'm crying  Hug me  I'm scared  Pull me close to you  I'm nervous  Kiss me  I'm stressed  Calm me  I'm in love  Love me in return

       What is love?  Is it shivers and goosebumps?  Is it kisses &amp; hugs?  Why do people lie about love?  Why do they jump to say "I love you"  I just don't get it  Love isn't a word to throw around  It's sacred, special, secretive  When you're in love, you don't get jealous  You don't focus on sec, or making out  You are kind, merciful, forgiving  You would sacrifice anything for that person  Love can come in many shapes &amp; sizes  Friendship love, Family love, Romantic love  Why do people rely on lying, cheating &amp; hurting  others just to get some materialistic treasure?  I'm not saying I'm perfect, I know I've made mistakes  But I try, I fail, I cry, I hurt, I love  Blood, sweat, &amp; tears...'tis life for some  But for others life is love, butterflies, &amp; flowers  who doesn't like presents &amp; gifts?  But should you really focus your life, love  &amp; relationships on getting presents?  I just want to know why people walk on eggshells  Why do they hurt others for their own benefits?  Why can't they realize what they're doing, who they're  hurting?  I hope I never deliberately hurt someone to make  myself feel better  I wish people would just live, without worrying  about who's hot and who's not  I guess I'll just sit here, in love, &amp; wonder why  I love you

       You look at me  I glance back  I see the sweetness in your eyes  The special caring look that you save just for me  My heart flutters &amp; I can feel my face heating up  as a blush makes its way across my cheeks   I melt at your touch  I'm jelly at your smile  My eyes seek your deep brown depths  and my knees go weak  You whisper to me,  the truth echoing your words,  as you say "I love you"  I sigh contentedly  I wish I could spend forever in your arms,  with these feelings of comfort, care  &amp; above all else, love   Your lips brush mine &amp; a spark  sets fire to my body  I slowly let my eyes close as we kiss,  it's sweet, innocent almost, &amp; yet  I still shiver in delight  as I feel your body pressed against mine  I know that you love me,  I can see it in your eyes,  And I know that I love you,  I can feel it in my heart  My very soul aches for your warm smile  when we're apart...

       Tears blur my vision  Slashing at my body  When will it end?  When will I feel the relief?  When will the pain go away?  I don't understand  I'm cutting  It always helps  But not this time  This time it does nothing  I feel nothing  No relief, no pain  so I cry harder  Pushing the blade deeper  I scream as I feel an excruciating pain  3 seconds later...  It's all over...  And I'm gone...Forever...

       He holds me in his arms  You look at us with a longing in your eyes  You want to be the one holding me  He sees our looks and pulls me closer   Why does God torment me so?  I'm safe in his arms  yet you look at me like that  And I yearn to be in your arms instead   He kisses me and you turn away  You can't bear to watch,  the pain is too much  But I try and ignore this and kiss him back   why does God tempt me so?  I wish I could break away from him  And kiss you instead, you stand off,  but I wish you'd come near  I can't this torture anymore

       I feel the pain  In my heart  Don't tell me that you love me  I don't believe you   Love isn't real  All it does is hurt  or make others jealous  So don't tell me you love me   People who say "I love you"  Lie, cheat, and hurt others  I just wish they'd stop  But they won't  Because they have found  "True love"   It's bullshit  It doesn't exist  So all they're doing  is hurting themselves  &amp; eventually they'll realize  what they're putting themselves through   So don't tell me you love me  I don't believe you

       The tears flow  Almost quicker than the blood  But not quite  I slashed my arms  My legs  My chest   I've tried to cut out my very heart  And almost succeeded  But pictures of my friends  Come into my mind  And I stopped  For awhile   Now I'm crying  And my insides are dying  My heart is breaking  And you are laughing   I just want you to be with me  But I can't always get what I want  so I'll just slash at things  Like my body  try and recreate myself  Or just destroy myself   So just leave me to my own devices  Leave me alone, please  Well, I'm not entirely alone  I have my tears to help me  And my knife to comfort me

       Red  Pain  Relief   I love these words  They bring on a rush of emotions  &amp; I love them   Blood  Tears  Scars   These words bring joy  They don't let me sleep  So I stay awake  And watch the blood flow  And feel the tears fall

       I long for him when I'm with you  But when we're apart  I want you back  Being in love means you would DIE  for that one person   But what if you have 2?  Would I die for both of you?  I think I would  But I'm not sure   I'm content with you  But ecstatic with him  Should I give you up  Just to break my heart?   You won't hurt me  He could  So what to do  Do I go  with  or without  you?

       Do I love you?  Do I want to be with you?  Do I truly care for you?   What of my feelings for him?  Do they not matter?  Why can't they just forget about me?  Am I really what they say?   I want these questions answered  I want my thoughts to calm  I want my questions to go away   But we don't always get what we want  And questions don't always get answered  Even though I beg  And plead  They still linger in my mind  Constantly plaguing my thoughts   I feel like I'm drowning in questions  without answers  without help  without anyone   Do I love you?  Does love exist?

       Walls  Everyone has them of some kind  Mine keep others out  Others keep themselves in   But do I want to let him in?  If I do, I can get hurt  I know this   But he's so true  So in love with me  As I am with him   But the walls...  I'm not sure I'm ready  to let them down  to expose myself  to give in to vulnerability   But he doesn't want me  Unless I let him in  &amp; I'm not sure if I want to   He says I hurt him  &amp; I know I did  &amp; I never wanted to  So I hurt myself in return  All the pain I caused his heart  I inflicted on my body  So I don't know if my walls  Should come down

       Freedom  Such an amazing thing  Everyone wants it  yet not one human being ever born  Will receive it   Religion, Clothes, Personality, Friends  Our parents, teachers, country  Everyone we know  Chooses for us   So don't tell me that I have my freedom  because I know you're lying  You just give me a false sense of security  So you can control me   But you won't  I won't be broken like some colt  Our harnessed like a donkey  I will be free  No matter what it takes   Freedom  Everyone wants it  No one has it  But I will  I swear, someday, I'll be free, from it all

       Don't tell me  that you love me  or that you care  I know your lies  I know your tricks  So why then do I fall for them?  Why do I always return to your arms?  When I know all the dangers lurking there  Don't try and comfort me  When you're the one who made me cry  Don't try and give me a kiss  When a few hours ago  you were smoking weed with the guys  I know your lies  I know your tricks  So why do I give in?  Why don't I just get rid of you forever?  It's so simple  One little word  But I can't  I'm too scared  You know so much  Too much  So I go back  I always go back  &amp; maybe someday  I'll say NO  &amp; you'll leave  for good  But until then...  I just keep on going  Back to you

       I keep them out  I know I shouldn't  But I must  For my own safety  For their sanity  I'm too complicated  They don't want to get to know me  So I won't let them   But I know them  Its easy to tell  Honestly.  You can't go off gossip,  Or first impressions   Look in the eyes  Check out the soul  They eyes are your only key to that   Deep Brown eyes  They show me love &amp; compassion  Yet a hidden pain as well  Hazel eyes  They hold back  It's hard to read them  I see pain, love, confusion, &amp; suffering  But they both mask it well  With smiles and jokes   I can do it better  I could make them think I was deliriously happy  or suicidally sad  So don't try and read me  Because no one can  So don't try  Because you can't

       He says he's hurt  He says I broke his heart  He says he's lost &amp; confused  He says he doesn't know anymore  &amp; yet he says he loves me   But I got hurt too  My heart was shattered  I was lost &amp; confused as well  I didn't know what the fuck was going on  &amp; yet I don't know if I love him   Thereâ€™s nothing to use  Nothing in sight  Nothing at all  I can't do anything  No sharp items  No knives  No scissors  Nothing  Fuck  I need it now  I need the relief  I need to feel the pain  But there's nothing  Nothing at all...

       I want to bleed  I want to hurt  I want to feel   No one understands  They think I'm insane  or suicidal  I don't want to die  I just want to feel   I sit and cry  But there's nothing to use  Suddenly I spy my razor  I grab for it &amp; place it against my skin   I feel the familiar sting  And let out a deep sigh  I didn't even realize I was holding my breath  I see the light trickle of blood  but it's not enough   I find a space clear of scars  I press the blade up against my skin again  Deeper &amp; harder I press it  The blood flows  I smile through my tears  The words of a song float towards me from my radio   "I hurt myself today, to see if I could feel"  As I listen, I smile sadly  and press the knife against my skin once more

       Numb.  Such a small word  yet such a huge feeling.  "Void of all feeling"  Nothing.   That's how I feel  when I cut  Like there's nothing there  Like I can't feel anything  and all the outside world  fades away   But people's natural instinct  tells them something's wrong  that I shouldn't be acting like this  so they talk to adults  tell them their worries and cares  and I get called in to "talk"  I know what they want me to say  that I need help, that they'll find help   But I just block them out  and tell myself that everything's going to be fine  They tell me to talk to people  To open up  But I just keep them out  I go home and sit here writing   Numb.  Such a small word  yet such a huge feeling...

I feel these things  I want out  I want normal  I don't want to be with my dad  I want to be with my friends  They love me, they actually care  I want to be free  Just hold me please   Kiss my fears away  Hold my shaking form  Tell me everything will be okay  That we'll get through it all together  That you love me  and will no matter what   Emotions running all over the place  Love hiding fear  Questions hiding scars  Going numb  Help me  Love me  Save me

Don't  I'm fine  I like hurting  Pain is my friend  It's what I live for  And I won't give that up  No matter what  I love pain  I live for pain  I couldn't survive without it  So don't even try and take it away  I've heard all the excuses  So don't go there  Because I love pain  I live for pain...

       Music.  Such a blessing  Such a curse  Humans don't realize  just how glorious it is   But I know  Now that I have nothing else  Music is my only way  To escape  To get out  To be free  For awhile   Music sets me free  It takes me places  I could only imagine  And I long to share it with someone else  I wish I could just  float away  beyond space and time  with no rules and regulations  Just all by myself   Alone  Free  One   Music is my savior...

       It's funny  Pain that is  It's so unpredictable  So open &amp; wild  I love it   But I hate loving it  I should despise pain  Just like everyone else  but I don't   I treasure it  That one feeling  That just for a second  I can drift away  From everything   I love it  But I shouldn't  People think I'm suicidal  or depressed  If they find out  how much I love this pain   so I keep it inside  This continual hunger  to feel the burn  the rush of emotions  that pain brings  to me...  I love pain  But I shouldn't...

       I sit in your arms  Safe &amp; sound  You tell me you love me  I look to the ground  I look up at him  And yearn to be free  Your arms were once comforting  Now they feel like chains  I want to feel his arms around me  But wait...  Everytime I leave your arms  I feel so insecure  So I always run back  To the safety in chains  And I break his heart  Everytime  I must get out  I must get away  Why does humanity always wish to be free from their chains  yet always run back to them once they are free?

       You're through with me breaking your heart  You're finished with waiting for me to start  You want me now  To be all yours  To share me with no one  Especially not him   I know you are bruised, broken, confused  I ache inside to heal those wounds  But I stand back  Stay in his arms  and watch as you suffer  Killing myself slowly   He doesn't know how I feel  He wants me to open up  &amp; stop blocking him out  But I know what he'd do  If he knew how I felt  We'd be over and through  He'd be with someone new  I'd be killing myself slowly   Killing myself slowly  I do it a lot  I feel my heart breaking  As red turns black  Killing myself slowly  I guess I love dying...

       Drip, drop  Smoothly flowing  Gorgeous color  Soothing, stressless  Pain reliever  Oops  Little too deep that time  Oh well  Who cares?  I don't  You don't  No one does  So maybe I'll go deep again  It won't hurt at all  So let's go deep...

       Why does he hate me suddenly?  It makes me sad  What have I done  to make him mad  I havenâ€™t said a word  nor given a look  but he took my gift  &amp; my art  and destroyed them both  for no reason at all  I just don't get it  I've done nothing wrong  So why does he hate me  it makes me sad...   He probably expects me  to destroy all his gifts  but I'll just hold them  even closer to my heart  I wish I could just  make him happy  But I know I can't  and that makes me sad...   Why me?  Why now?  Why him?  Why us?  I just don't understand  It makes me sad...

       Bleeding  Crying  Healing  Scarring   Same old  story  Same old  pain  I want to feel  something new  New pain  So now I take walks  Hop in front of cars instead  But still  I like bleeding more   But still  it's old  I need something new  Some way to bleed  Without this  But I still like cutting  So I don't know...  But it's the same old   Bleeding  Crying  Healing  Scarring

       Pain  God no  He accuses  and bruises  It cuts deep  deeper than any knife  ever could wish to go  I wish he'd stop  I don't know why he started  It hurts  Why?   Death  I'm gone  and he doesn't even care  I shouldn't have thought he would  But I hoped   Agony  In hell  You see the ones you love  Loving others  forgetting about you  Not even caring to begin with  And it hurts   Pain  Death  Agony  I love thee...  He hurts...  He cuts me deeper  than any blade could ever  wish to go...

       I've lost him  I love him  But he no longer loves me back  Why  Because I hurt him  I tore out his heart  &amp; now he's come back  To do the same to me  I see him standing there  flirting with her  Turning on that charm  that adorable sweetness  I just want to be with him  But he's through  He wants out  He doesn't want me  I've lost him  I love him...

       He wants me to open up  He wants me to be his  But I never will be  I lost my heart  A long time ago  To one who doesn't want it  Anymore  He did once  But no longer  He begs and pleads  "Please talk"  But I just block him out  I love you  I belong to you alone  So don't hurt me anymore  Please

       I cried  I cut  I went deep  Deeper than I've ever gone  It didn't help  I still saw you  Standing there  Laughing at some joke  Completely carefree  With no thought of me  I wanted to scream  I wanted to run  up to you  But I stayed where I was  Taking off your gift  I wanted to hold onto it until the day I died  Which I assumed would be today  But I couldn't  So I gave it back  Although I felt desperately alone and cold  As soon as it left my neck  I looked at you one last time  before making my way to the car  I stepped in and the tears streamed down my face  The tears that I had been holding in all week  The ones that came out full force every night  into my pillow  Millions of memories racked my brain  this night  as I held the blade in my hand  Memories of you, inches away from me  Memories of us, of you holding me  of me seeking comfort from your sweet words  But none of this brought comfort or consolation now  Just more pain  Because I knew that those memories had no meaning  to you  That's all they are  memories  Which can easily be forgotten  But I will never forget  I loved you before you loved me  I loved you as you loved me  I loved you when you stopped loving me  And I love you now  I pushed the blade deeper  But couldn't do it  As I saw that last fleeting image  The look on your face  As you watched me  The one that told me  That you didn't like me  That you most certainly didn't love me  But that, in some fucked up way,  you cared  So I stopped  I was covered in blood  My blood  I came out  Called my grandma  She screamed  Phoned the hospital  They came by  "Patched me up"  But I still had those fleeting images  Of you and me  Holding  Hugging  Kissing  Comforting  Consoling  Love  I thought it was us  I thought it was true  But I was proved wrong  By you  You said it wouldn't fade  You swore this was new  But I should've known  You'd break my already broken heart  I guess all I can do  Is keep loving you  Praying that someday  Your feelings will return  So I just sit here  Crying  Not cutting  But loving you.

       I walk in  Other girls do to  So this is "Group"  I sigh  Great.  I'm officially a freak now  But wait  these girls,  A few of them  have scars too  My breath catches in my throat  Could they be like me?  I dare to hope  Maybe I could actually talk  Spill my story  These girls could relate  Maybe  I'm not such a freak  Maybe  I'm not so stupid  Maybe  When I get through with  "Group"  He'll love me  Like he used to  When I was better  Maybe  I can tell my story  To these very similar  New friends...

       Scared  Add an "r"  Scarred   Both of these apply to me  Scared to talk to others  Scarred from opening up   But why?  Because I was hurt  Because I was abused  Because I want out   But no one cares  No one gives a shit  So why should I?  I shouldn't  I'll just end it   Right now  Right here  Scared...  &amp;  Scarred...

       He says  "Actions Speak Louder Than Words"  Well I've talked  all about this  So let's do it  He's even encouraging me  It's like he's telling me  to do this  Like he cares anyways  If I were dead  He could date whoever  without "that bitch"  annoying the hell out of him  I've tried everything  to get him back  I was sweet  I wore cute clothes  &amp; I even stopped eating  Atleast I can control that  How much food I eat  Or how little  But nothing matters anymore  You don't care  about me  at all  So maybe I'll take your advice  "Actions  Speak Louder  Than Words"

       A teardrop  It can stand for  Joy  Pain  Anger  Sadness   But for me  Tears no longer  have any comfort  They no longer  console my feelings  No matter what  these feelings are   My knife  Is my only comfort  Taking walks  Is my only consolent  My poems  Are my only confident   Because no one cares  and those who do  will not remember  With time  A teardrop  Those who love me will lose two  One for sadness, &amp; one for joy...  A teardrop...

       "Do you know  who's that girl  who's all alone?  Do you care  enough to see  she's in pain &amp; misery?"  &nbsp;  No one cares  I've lost him forever  I've cried many tears  but they won't bring him back to me...  &nbsp;  "Dig my grave  Dig it deep  Dig my grave  from head to feet  And on the top  place a dove  and remember this:  I died for love"  &nbsp;  I wish I would die  Why can't I do it myself?  Because a part of me hopes  That he still cares  Because I love him  and am literally  dying without him  But,I've lost him forever...  haven't I?

        I can't believe   The words you used   "slut", "whore", "never again"   The tears sting my eyes each night   falling into my pillow.   But each morning, it's the same deal.   Happy face, cheery, bright, and smiling.   Some know   Some don't   But no one cares   I act like I don't either   But each night   The tears fall   Upon my pillow   as I stare at your picture   remembering every hateful word      In the shower   the tears are again disguised   your words cut deep   as does my razor   But no one knows...Or cares...

       Pain   It hurts   Kills even   But not me   Why not?   I wish I could simply   let go   and let the pain   grab a hold of me   enveloping my soul   instead of teasingly tormenting me      Pain   It hurts   Kills even   But not me...   Why?

       The thunder crashes The lightening flashes The rain pours down Upon my face It disguises my tears Which fall from my eyes  My eyes Sad Blue   and yet no one knows  I walk through the storm Slowly, letting it envelop me The tears cease in team AS does the storm The clouds clear And my cheeks return to their rosy pink And so the storm ends...      (reprise)   But I know   When the next storm comes   The tears will too   reminding me of you   all our memories   more good than bad   what happened?   Maybe the next storm   will give me answers   instead of empty questions.
