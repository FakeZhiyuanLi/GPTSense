      Another day, another bored message.... Spent last night scanning the first batch of new photos to go on the Suspects site. It's looking pretty good so far, figure I really need some sort of script to manage the photo gallery though, but I don't have the knowledge or ability to write one yet - or the facility, since my webspace doesn't allow CGI scripts. Thankfully I'm going to be learning Perl in one of my uni modules, so I'll doubtless pick up the skills there. Might be able to claim for any work I do on the site too :)  Today's quite an easy day, no uni. Still got to go to work though, and I'm really really looking forward to that :P Ah well, that's life, as I so often tell myself. Suppose I should really get on with scanning the other photos in a minute, but it isn't even 9am yet so I can't be bothered!

      Well.... ummmm.... where do I start? Suppose the beginning would be good, but that suggests the use of logic, and I'm much too bored to do things in a logical, straightforward way. Let's face it, if I wasn't bored, I wouldn't be doing this in the first place! That and having a stupid amount of free time, at least until my full uni timetable kicks in, are the main contributory factors to me bothering with this.  I'm a student, ok? Just started at the  urlLink University of Teesside , which for you international folks out there, is based in Middlesbrough, England. Not on another planet or anything, though with some of the people I've seen wandering around, I've seriously got to wonder where the HELL they came from - or which hell, for that matter. I'm studying for a HND in Computer Studies, biased towards Software Development, which means I get to play with computers a lot. Next year I'm hoping to move onto a degree in Games Programming, but whether that happens or not, I guess we'll all find out in approximately 12 months time. I know I can do it, it's just convincing myself it's worth the effort.  Think I'm starting to make a few friends, not too bad by my standards, it usually takes a lot longer than this. I suppose I'm helped by the fact that only a few of the others have been to uni in the past, so EVERYONE is trying to meet people and form friendships. Unfortunately for me, the people I'm meeting so far are all on different modules - but at least I can go and get pissed with them, should the opportunity present itself.... I'm confident that it will, we are meant to be students after all.....  As well as this site, I have another two. One is my personal site, which I haven't yet gotten much done with - that's located at  urlLink www.mrtufty.co.uk . And the other is a site I'm developing with my friends, to show the world how mad we are - that one is at  urlLink www.alltheusualsuspects.co.uk . Both are still very much under development, and are likely to stay that way for a very long time, or at least until I've achieved the correct balance between my personal life, work, and university. I never was much good at juggling....

      I'm at home now.... long day over with. Shattered now like. Whoever decided a 9-hour day at uni was a good idea needs shooting. Only got to do a 2-hour practical tomorrow though, and it's an easy one cos it's only Visual Basic. Everyone thinks I'm mad cos I'm learning C, Perl and VB all at the same time - but it's not really that hard. With C and Perl the syntax is almost identical, and VB is just good for learning how to handle events and objects, stuff like that.  I've started mentoring for one of the other students today as well, he's struggling with Perl a bit. Think personally he's concentrating too much on the wrong things, he was going on about how he runs the scripts from home - basically uploading them to his uni webspace and running it from there.... and on that side of things, he just lost me. Talk about making life difficult for yourself! Maybe I'm just lucky, cos I  get  it.  Because our tutors only stay with us for the first hour of each 2-hour long practical session, we're unmonitored a lot of the time. So I wound up helping yet another student, who's missed most of the sessions up to now, with her work. I seem to be becoming the sort of person other students come to for help, which is cool - glad I'm appreciated! I just wish I was better at explaining stuff, sometimes I think that the points I'm trying to make are just going straight over their heads - but hell, I'm not a tutor!  Hopefully going to be playing Max Payne 2 by the end of the night. If it's anywhere near as good as it's meant to be (and as good as it looks), then I'm going to be needing to change my pants. I'll write a review of it if I can be bothered, and upload it to either this site or my main one.  Anyway, that's it from me for now, catch you all later.

      What can I say, I'm bored! Sitting here at uni in a C Programming tutorial.... Trying to get my head round why C doesn't allow a simple way to convert a number to a string. Guess what, I can't figure it out.... maybe it's cos they were stupid or something? Never mind. Been having fun with the course so far, I live and breathe code so those aspects of it have been soooo easy to get my head round. Networks and Communications ain't quite so easy, but I think I'm even getting my head round that.  Oh well, limitations of the language aside, C is pretty cool. Can't wait to get onto C++, but I have to wait until next year for that. Shame really - I'm fairly sure they've got better string support!  We're all having a Halloween party over at Darron's. Fancy dress. Buggered if I know what I'm going as, guess if I didn't shave until then I could go as a werewolf.... but I don't think that'd be such a good idea, really, do you? Ah well it'll be a good night, loads of people have been invited, we're all going to get very very drunk and do silly things, and you can pretty much bet that the photos will end up online. I wouldn't mind setting up a webcam for it but people would probably object, or at best make obscene gestures to the camera.... actually that could be quite fun!  One of the other modules I'm learning here is Web Programming - covering Perl (which I think is a damn sight better than C, owing to it's scalar variables - if you don't know what that means, don't worry, it's not important). And I get 15MB of webspace on which I can run scripts..... hmmmm can anyone say testbed? Nowhere near enough to upload my photos and stuff, but at least I can check out the functions of the sites I'm working on before I pay out for a hosting package.  Also I get to open my Student Bank Account today. Going with Natwest, cos they offer the best deal by far. Can't say no to a £1250 interest-free overdraft.... and based on my projected spending for the next 5 years, I shouldn't even get that close to the limit, which also will rise each year. I think my maximum, or minimum depending on how you look at it, is going to be around £800, and then only at the end of each year when my Student Loan is all spent. See, going to uni needn't cost the Earth.... so long as you've got a part-time job - and how else did you think you were going to pay for your drunken parties?  It seems this post has turned into a completely freeform thing. I don't seem to be able to concentrate very well today, didn't sleep much last night. I'm probably coming down with something, it seems everyone else has been wiped out by a nasty bug the last couple of weeks, it's probably my turn now. Damned if it's going to stop me doing what I want though, only way that'll happen is if I literally can't move as a result.  Anyway enough weirdness for now, I'll probably post again later, when I'm sitting in my practical session for Web Programming - back to Perl again. I'd go for an early lunch but I have a meeting here at 1, so I've got to stick around for a while longer. Damn.  Later.....

      I'm drunk. Dunno why I'm typing this, cos I am drunk. It's good :) Just got back from a party at Darron's, another good night. I'm moderately drunk, still tipsy, but god the cheap vodka fruit drinks from Asda are class (£1.28 for 700ml :D)!  I feel the need to do odd things, but there's nobody here but me, so I'll probably just go to bed, once I'm sure I've gotten past the hangover stage. Not the first time I've done that, stayed awake until I'm completely sober just so I don't wake up with a bad head. Doesn't always work though. For more interesting experiments in drunkenness, just wait until I can get into the proper student lifestyle.....  Night all!

      Just spent a good part of today (well, yesterday now) updating and redesigning  urlLink AllTheUsualSuspects.co.uk  to make it more in theme with the season - and overall, better graphically - well I think so anyway. I invite everyone to check it out, bearing in mind that at the moment, there's only one page of photos, and none of the other navigation categories have anything there yet. I'm working on it. Feedback is very welcome, and should be directed towards the link at the bottom of each page (click on the copyright notice, that'll do the job).

      It can't just be my imagination..... I must be God, or something. At the very least, a minor deity. Don't worry, I'm not all that interested in taking over the world - well, I am, but in a nice, minimal-violence way (as opposed to slaughtering millions of people, cos all that really does is piss them off).  It's about time for the assignments to get handed out now - got one of them today, in fact, the one for my Web Programming module. The other one (for C Programming) I've seen, but hasn't officially been handed out yet (mainly because we haven't covered all the topics we need to yet). However, I've tackled bits of each, and they both seem pretty straightforward. Even to get Distinctions. A few of them will come in nicely!  For C, I have to produce a command-line program that outputs a 12-month calendar to the screen, 3 months across and 4 down. Already got the basic principles in there - I have code that outputs placeholders for the days, in 3 month blocks. All I have to do now is integrate the functionality of my earlier program, which only outputs the calendar in a single column. I reckon I'll have it done for next week :-)  The Web Programming one is a little more involved - produce an ordering system for a company selling Elvis memorabilia, of all things. Track stock levels, award free gifts, and produce an order confirmation page before squirting the completed order to a text file for processing. All using hidden form fields, we haven't (unfortunately) covered cookies - although I reckon hidden fields are more appropriate to this use in any case, so no reason to complain.  Also, we did a sample test for Networks and Communications the other day. 20 questions out of the real test's 50, about all we can reasonably expect to get right since we've only just started to cover the actual Networks side of the module. I got 17 out of 20 right - in other words, well on target for a Distinction grade there as well!  And as for the Visual Basic module :-P No problem. End test here we come (although not until the middle of January)!  So I guess I'm either a god, or at the very least a seriously smart guy :-P I know I probably don't compare to those people who know Java and stuff like the back of their hands, but I don't care :-P  Oh, and I love my girlfriend - Jade, if you read this, I LOVE YOU! She's practically a goddess, and I'm really really lucky to have someone so special in my life :-) Everyone should have someone like Jade in their life - but you can't have her, she's mine :-P  Ok, I suppose I should get on and do some more funky coding tricks now, so I'll end this here!

      2 posts in 2 days.... aren't you the lucky ones?  This is just a quick update - the web server is back online. It's not running Gentoo. After all my problems with it before, it seems that it still doesn't like my little Linux box. Complains time and time again. Segmentation fault, it says - I say, what the hell is one of those? Apparently it can sometimes happen if your system memory or hard drive is developing a failure, but every other piece of evidence I have seems to indicate they're both fine. Guess the only way to find out is if it burns a hole in my carpet.  So the box is, for now at least, back to running Fedora. It does the job, it's not as customised as Gentoo would have been, but as long as it works, I don't really care. Some of the parts of the site I was working on while on my breaks at uni yesterday have been uploaded, and they seem to work fine as well. As a bonus, it looks ok under Windows as well. Just wish the default Windows fonts were as nice as the Linux ones. Suppose I could fix the fonts, I know there's a way to do that, but on the whole I think keeping it simple is the best idea.  Anyway, sometime over the next few days I'll be implementing the features for proper logins (at the moment it's hardcoded while I test it, so I've got to swap that back out to MySQL again - couldn't code that at uni, they just don't have the facility - or if they do, they're not telling the students :P), and then news posts. Any comments on the site, be they technical, artistic or otherwise, should be redirected to webmaster@alltheusualsuspects.co.uk. Best you tell me any problems now, while it's still relatively simple to fix them, than later on when I have to wade through 4 miles of PHP code to work out what's gone wrong!  Anyway, bye for now people!

      Well hello there. I know it's been a while, but I've been rather busy, and updating my blog hasn't been a priority.  Mostly, I've been at university - the first semester has now ended, the second started (for me at least) today. A whole new group of modules to get through - Principles of Computers, Database Development, Systems Analysis and Design, and Principles of Visual Programming 2. If those titles sound scary, then you're not as much of a nerd as me (who is?).  In the time I haven't spent studying, I've been working on my other website, at www.alltheusualsuspects.co.uk. It's down at the moment, because I'm now hosting it on my own server and ummmm, I kinda broke it. Well actually I didn't break it, just overlooked something EXTREMELY stupid. I've been trying to install Gentoo Linux on it, because I wanted a nice, clean installation with only the basic tools I need. So, I spent a couple of days downloading one of their LiveCD sets, which are meant to make installing and configuring a cinch. They do work, by the way. Unfortunately, I downloaded the version customised for Athlon XP CPUs. Why unfortunately? Well.... I made the daft mistake of failing to remember that while my main system is indeed powered by an Athlon XP, my Linux box is NOT. It is, in fact, powered by an ageing Pentium III chip. So the 2 days I've spent trying to get Gentoo to work have been in vain, because I was a dumbass, basically. The problem will be rectified when I finish downloading another LiveCD set, this one customised for Pentium III chips :P Oh well, nobody's perfect. I suppose I could have gone for the basic version and saved myself this problem - but given my very basic knowledge of configuring Linux, I figured, what the hell, customisation and optimisation can't hurt (hopefully).  Anyway, that was me going slightly off topic. Got so much to think about, I'm just talking bollocks. The website, when I get the server box back up and running, will look just a tiny little bit different from the version you've seen before. As part as my goal of world domination (well everyone's got a dream, right?), I've commenced writing my own CMS (Content Management System) for it. It's by no means finished, and it's certainly not as polished as the professional ones - but I don't care, cos it's mine! And it gives me the opportunity/excuse/whatever to get my head around PHP, which so far has been great fun, if occasionally of the head-scratching 'why the hell isn't this working' variety. MySQL is running as the database backend behind the whole thing, and that also has proved to be a confusing, yet ultimately rewarding experience.  What can I say, I told you I was a nerd!  If very little of the previous couple of paragraphs has made sense, you're probably not a very technical person. Don't worry, it's not for everyone. There's other things I'm not nearly as good at - I'm sure.  At the moment, projected timescale for getting the server up and running ranges anywhere from 2 days (probably absolute minimum) to about a week. It could be longer, but I reckon I can get it going by then, with at least the basic features of my site there.  In other news, I painted my bedroom. It's nice :) It's actually wrong to say I did it, cos I only started it, my grandad did most of the work - he was complaining that I wasn't doing it very well (see I told you there were some things I couldn't do :P) and took over the job. It's a bit of a pit at the minute because we're waiting for some nice new beds to be delivered. Could be up to 3 weeks until they get here though, and at the minute I have a mattress on the floor - around which is a bombsite, which I have plans to tackle tomorrow. Wasn't my idea to make this much mess, it's just cos I had a load of stuff under my bed out of the way, and now.... there's no bed to hide it under. Never mind.  Anyway, I think I might just sign off now. This has been pretty much the longest post I've ever made to this, or any blog. Soon the functions of this will be moved across to the other site though. I'll stop in more often for a while anyway, just to keep everyone updated on what's happening.  Bye for now!

      Today was a really bad day. The worst in a very long time in fact, and that's saying something considering what things have been like lately. I don't want to put my entire personal life on here though (I hear people saying, "but it's a blog, you're supposed to!", but I don't really care what you think, this is my life, not yours) so I'm not saying any more about it. Suffice it to say that it was a really bad day.  I'm so unfocused at the moment. I was furious earlier, now I'm just down. I'm hoping to be happy again tomorrow, but we'll see. If I was a Jedi, I'd be seriously heading towards the Dark Side right now. Not convinced I'm not anyway. Taking a more direct route than general though. Skipping right through the whole thing and going right to anger. There's a certain person out there tonight sitting there gloating, when he should be coughing his last breath. If I could get to him, he would be. Those of you who actually know me will know I mean that.  I'm listening to music to calm me down (it is supposed to soothe the savage beast after all, and that describes me right now). It's not working terribly well. I could do with a punchbag. Thought about punching the wall or the door or something earlier, but that would hurt and wouldn't go very far towards solving the problem in the first place. Could get drunk, but that won't help either.  Fuck it. Why am I even bothering writing this shit anyway? Nobody reads it.

      Y'know, I'd forgotten I had this :)  It was only when I was searching the web for any help that I can find with implementing my own blogging system for AllTheUsualSuspects.co.uk that I came across it. Yes, that's right, my system still isn't done. In fact, it's a long way from done. But what the hell. I'll get there in the end.  I keep looking at other software for running the site.... all seems nice and friendly, BUT in 99% of all cases either costs money, or is far too powerful for my needs. That doesn't preclude me stealing ideas left, right and centre however. I'm at user specification stage for the site backend now, with a little bit of sample code having already been done. Chances are I'll have to do a rewrite at some point - the current system doesn't allow for templating, which is a big deal since there won't just be one blog on the site, but several (possibly as many as 10 if all of my friends want one of their own)...  Eventually I will get the site up and running. It works now, just not as flexible as I would like. Visit it, stop by our forums - we don't bite, honestly....

      Today has mostly been a low level sort of day; I've come up with a few ideas for the terrain generator, but putting them into code has proved more challenging than I would have expected.  This morning was spent implementing an interpolation function. Actually it only took me about 15 minutes. Basically it just takes a start value, an end value, and the number of steps you want to spread the change over, and returns the amount by which you need to increment each time to reach the end value. Simple really.  This afternoon I took a break, and tried to figure out some more ideas. It came to me that one way to do it would be to have a list. Each time I need to add an inbetween point, I can bump all the later items down a notch to make room for it. This would be an elegant solution to my problem, but for one thing: The support in DarkBasic for lists seems to be broken. There is a function to do EXACTLY this job, and it's called ARRAY INSERT AT ELEMENT. Supposedly, it creates a new element after the position you specify, and bumps everything after it down a bit. BUT, when I've tried it this evening, it manages to create the new element, but wipes everything after it. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, or maybe it's a bug in the system. I'm going to do a search on the DB site and see what I can turn up.  There's probably easier ways to generate terrain. But I can't think of any :)

       Well, hello there. This is the first post in the developer diary for Chaotic Tanx. Over the coming months, I'll do my best to keep this up-to-date with the latest work I've done on the project. Hopefully that'll be enough to hold your interest until the game's ready for release, which is still a fair way in the future.     &nbsp;   Ok, so what is Chaotic Tanx? It's a remake of the Amiga game Scorched Tanks, which was in turn based on the PC game Scorched Earth. There's a whole history of this type of game, most of which I haven't dug out yet. For this version, I'm borrowing ideas and features from many different games, although the core remains unashamedly Scorched Tanks in execution - so far, anyway - even this might change as the project continues.     &nbsp;   At this stage, the game's coding has barely begun. I'm trying to get away from my usual habit of plunging straight into the code and then getting confused about halfway through (I'm not known for commenting my code very well either). Originally the plan was to create the whole thing in C++ and DirectX, but that meant writing all of the basic code as well as the game. So, for the moment at least, the game is being written in Dark Basic Pro. Another advantage of doing this, is that the game is eligible for entry into The Game Creator's programming competition - providing I'm finished by the end of October, when the competition closes. At this stage, that seems to be an insane goal.     &nbsp;   As of this morning, I'm working on the terrain generation functions. You can't have a tanks game without a playing field, and in this case you don't really want a  level  playing field, so I've got to figure out how to generate mountains. I've previously written a function to do just that, but that was done in Blitz3D - and as I mentioned before, my poor commenting has made it pretty much impossible to know what's it doing :P Looking back at it, I've realised there's quite a few errors in it anyway.     &nbsp;   The terrain generation uses a form of midpoint displacement to create a suitably jagged set of mountains to blow up. So far anyway. There are other techniques which may provide better results, which is something I'm looking at. Once this stage is complete, I've got to figure out texturing the landscape. Then I can work on blowing it up :)     &nbsp;   So there's loads left to do, plenty of cool ideas to implement. You never know, I might even make the target. And if not, it'll still be good evidence I can put in my portfolio for the Games Programming degree I'm due to start in September :)     &nbsp;   If anyone has any advice or extra features they'd like to see in the game, get in touch. If your idea is used, I'll stick your name into the credits :)

      Or, I did no work on CT today. Apart from thinking a bit more about how to proceed. It's clear that my programming skills are vastly reduced from what I thought they once were. Maybe it's a sign of progression that I am able to recognise this. Back in the good old days of the Amiga I was able to produce some moderately impressive stuff from studying other people's work and imitating it, even sometimes creating my own original (or semi-original) concepts. But back then I was little more than a hacker, feeling my way along more through blind luck than anything else. Now I know a little more of the theory, it's harder to just sit down and hack. At the same time the "Eureka" moments seem to have pretty much disappeared from my life. I'm unfocused about so many different things that it's hard to concentrate on anything to the exclusion of all else. It doesn't help having to share a bedroom with my younger brother either!  In many ways I equate this situation to the same one I find when I draw. Back when I was only about 9 or 10, and hence in junior school, I used to be capable of drawing in many different styles. A lot of them were renditions of places I had seen - rarely 100% correct, but well done regardless - or so I thought anyway, perhaps my memory has obscured them. But after going to secondary school and learning more of the theory behind art, especially at GCSE level, I found that my basic drawing skills were less than they were. I'm not certain whether it's a result of learning too much and thus my talents being obscured - that could be more than a little presumptious of my own skill level, and it's certainly immodest - or a result of other factors in my life since. For all my experiences - some of which I'll undoubtedly recount later in this blog, as I add more of my personality to it - I was a remarkably naive child. It could be that life experience has pushed these other things to one side, or just blocked them off from me. I know that I'm a very self-conscious person. I'm very much aware of that, and of how much it holds me back sometimes. I also know, or suspect, a lot of the reasons for it, although I think that the truth might be closer to an excuse than I am comfortable with. Perhaps I'm holding myself back for fear of attempting too much and failing, so I do just enough to make it look like I'm doing my best. See what I mean about an uncomfortable excuse? Maybe I really am screwed up.....  But there you go. That's life, and I challenge anyone to come through it without any scarring whatsoever. I've survived this long, and I'm certain if I can survive long enough I can be the person I want to be, that I always believed I would be when I was younger and foolish enough to believe that I could accomplish anything if I simply wanted it badly enough.  Anyway, enough on this for now. To be honest, I'm uncertain about the wisdom of making a post like this in a blog I set up for covering my work on Chaotic Tanx, but I'll let it stand anyway. It doesn't hurt to let people know how I'm feeling I guess.
