      Doin nothing this long weekend.....just looking out the window, watching the rain. Need to get back to the city today and back to work from tomm. Lots of stuff to do besides the usual mundane work. but for this post its about today.....after many months, I had authentic bengali food. shukto, khichuri, labra, aloo bhaja and for the grand finale goat meat. I've been sinking further down into the depths of vices...eat more non-veg than ever..smoke sometimes, drink like a phish. Other useless things that I do and which takes up a lot of time, is spend hours watching losers chat and discuss their miserable lives...guess that makes me one of them, the passive participant. but its kind of sad how they think that their lives has a lot of meaning when they can get someone to like them and how vicious they can get once they have been spited. another curious bunch of ppl are those posting MC's on craigslist. either they have always aimed too high and succeeded or they are just having delusions of meeting the mystery girl/guy they glimpsed once on the street and who smiled back at them. aah well....its fun to read when the simulations are running.

      Done with commencement.....was fun with the hecklers interrupting the president's speech....reminded me the need to be idealistic. I seem to have lost it somewhere along the way.

      Damn.....how much time i spend day dreaming of stuff that isnt even remotely related to my life. i put it all down to being a piscean. I dont have any romantic life worth talking about....but i go on travels with someone...movies, dinners and more, all in my mind. in reality i like to think that i dont believe in the cliched relationship of being with someone but more in having lots of space to yourself but also friends to spend some time with in between. more than half of what i think doesnt make sense to me and dont even ask about what i dream off.  as usual nothing great about today. the usual grind, getting to work, trying to work....not much getting done. might go to see 'control room' today or maybe tommorrow. saw 'day after tomm.' on friday. my friend trashed it with the usual highhandedness of an engineer who thinks everything should work within a specific set of rules. its a movie for cryin out loud. his grouse the science was not right. who cares....the director didnt and neither did the general audience to which it was directed. if u start picking the nitty gritties of each movies u see, you are better off watching indie movies. this one was catered more towards letting ppl know the effects global warming, since we all tend to be forgetful of something which is not explicitly tangible(redundant?) to us. the director, roland emmerich, hoped to do this with graphic images which ppl understand better and retain more.he did an ok job with the usual hollywood masala of having a saviour american battling against all odds to save his loved ones and he like always succeeds. aah well....his film, his money. he can do whatever damn well he pleases and we can criticize all we want like my friend. time to get back to work and do some logistic regression.

      I am getting on to be an amazon addict.....this sucks. I see a book I like and then try to find another one that will take me over the $25 mark. Bought 1000 places to see before you die and the da vince code. think i will save it for the long plane ride to india. dont think i can hold out that long. my idea of having a good time is to read a good book. guess thats one hallmark of being a geek.
