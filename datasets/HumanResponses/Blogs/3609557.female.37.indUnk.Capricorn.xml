						   It hasn't been the most interesting day to start a blog, but, hey!     Its been dark and cloudy all day and rained a bit.  After I walk Austin to school I took a 30 minutes walk up through the park and through our neighborhood.  Its wonderful to be outside after our long hard extra cold winter, and our cold damp spring.  I was about 7 minutes from home when it started to rain.  I just felt like napping on the couch all day, the weather just makes that seem like the best idea in the world!  Instead I did laundry, hung out at my favorite internet sites, cut the boys hair after school, and cooked chicken for supper.     I'm really quite glad to be home this evening.  We've been out the last three nights in a row ... and this home body is just looking forward to a night of nothing in front of the TV!  Tuesday night we went to hear Steve Bell sing and Adrian Plass speak.  He was very funny and it was so good to laugh hard!  We went with Mick and Helen.  Wednesday night Jason and I went to the YMCA, we walked around the track for about 15 mintues, then went to a fitness orientation class with a couple of 15 year old boys!  The instructor was a very nice young woman.  After that I spent 30 minutes on the treadmill and Jason did his work out (steppe and weights).  I made an appointment for Monday night to have a personal program set up for me.  I'm hoping to get out to the Y at least 2 mornings a week and hopefully 3.  Thursday night we went to Prayer meeting at church, there were 5 of us there.  Afterwards I did a pile of photocopying for Ethan's therapy.  I've been trying just a little bit to get back on track with my eating and exercise.  Today I'm feeling a bit more positive and optimistic, but most of the week I've just felt like a failure who starts and stops and loses and gains over and over.  I've been hesitant to start again only to think that I'll fail yet again.   My eating has improved.  Mostly I'm just trying to get my meals healthy and I will worry about omitting  snacks and fine tuning in the future.  Baby steps, as we like to say!    Ideas on things to write about:    Simple Living thoughts for the poor or at a moderate income.  Seems so much simiple living stuff I see is targeted at the middle and upper middle class and wealthy, and some of the things they think to give up in terms of simplicity just seem like "duh" to me at our income.    Being content, decluttering, recycling, and such can apply to me too, but living on less of our income at this stage just isn't going to happen.    How to Pray for your pastor.  How to get more our of church.  The creative battle to prepare a sermon or teach.  Okay, that's it for today!    Signing off!
