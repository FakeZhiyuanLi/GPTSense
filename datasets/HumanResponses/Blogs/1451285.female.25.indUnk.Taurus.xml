      It's weird how sometimes you can be in a quiet place or even in a loud place for that matter and totally just come to a realization about yourself that never thought existed. I don't know what it is but everytime I come home I learn something new about myself. It might be the age and I'm growing up even though I HATE to admit that but tonight I came to the realization that at this moment I am not the person I thought I would be when I reached the age of 24. I'm not saying I've been living some kind of weird fake life for years but I just think that situations and people in my past have influenced me to live a certain way and be a certain kind of person that I never was. The person I am now is what I always was it was just hiding deep inside. It just took the right people and the right course of events to make me realize that. Who knows maybe I'll be saying the same exact thing about how I am now in another 4 or 5 years but for once Jennie finally has a smile on her face. It's fucking hot in West Palm Beach, thought I would mention that. I had fun tonight - went to dinner with the family and then went to see some old friends of mine and they took me to Friday's for some belated "Brownie Obsession". Why do people my age find it weird to go to a Friday's at 11 o'clock on a Friday night and NOT order alcohol. Chocolate is just as good. The server was pissed! WELL SORRY MR. FRIDAYS FLARE MAN BUT IT'S MY FUCKIN BIRTHDAY AND I WILL SPEND IT HOWEVER I CHOOSE. KISS MY BIG FAT BROWNIE OBSESSION ASS. By the way Jaime and Amber got me the coolest zippo with a robot on it ! Domo Arrigato Jaime and Amber. I love it to death (and thank you Jeff and Allison for taking me to Walgreens and buying me some lighter fluid) I'm gonna go to bed now - I'm poop diddly ooped! I'll have more to say tomorrow after I runaway with John Mayer and get married!  - J ps - this one goes out to my cousin Karen up in Auburn! What up lady? you kickin' it old school or what? you still ridin on a 1/4 tank of gas cuz you so fly? Keep on keepin it on and remember, Life's a Garden, Dig it!

      It's 7:35 in the morning. I'm sitting at my desk at work and avoiding the stack of charts sitting next to me. I havent had my first sip of the 7-11 French Vanilla Cappuccino to my right. I'm totally super duper excited about going to West Palm after work but I can't think of that now or my day will go by too slow. Today is Greg's graduation. I know he doesnt want to go but I want to just say I'm so proud of you Greg even though graduations are cheesy and I never went to my lame ass graduation for Keiser but I love you like a big brother and you have made your little sister proud today! See ya tonight!

      Wow, this has been quite the week! I never thought Friday would come as soon as it did. I had some relief tonight talking to Jen about the Boston thing. We agree on pretty much everything when it comes to me going there and when. My mom brought up a good point. I should probably go visit there in the winter so I can see if I could deal with the snow. I don't know snow at all and I don't know if it will accept me as the caring and loving person that I am. We all know I don't know what to wear in cold weather...ie: Neon orange jacket (Harris finds this one pretty funny. I'm not laughing) But, I've talked to alot of my friends about all these plans I'm making in my head and I'm not one to be able to come to a decision on my own about anything. I find it very hard but Jen brought up a weird point on the phone tonight. She said that she thought that was strange since everyone usually comes to me when they have a hard decision to make. Ironic? Don't you think? Lyndsay came in from Tampa today and we went to dinner. It was refreshing to see her again and have  a good ol' chat. She had a lot of relationship problems to discuss and even though I REALLY REALLY wish I was in one, Lynds made me rethink the whole thing ( no offense Lynds, if you're reading this) God I dont think I could deal with that kind of stress right now in my life.I miss the good parts of a relationship but I forgot how insane they can make you.  I was thinking about all the relationships I've had since James and I broke up almost 2 years ago ( man, I just realized how long its been - weird) and I wanted to make this dedication to all you fuckers who have ripped my heart out and stomped on it. I know I've done the same to at least one person and I apologize to whoever that may be but here it goes....good ol' Jeff Buckley tells it like it is  Last Goodbye    (Jeff Buckley)  This is our last goodbye  I hate to feel the love between us die  But it's over  Just hear this and then i'll go  You gave me more to live for  More than you'll ever know   This is our last embrace  Must I dream and always see your face  Why can't we overcome this wall  Well, maybe it's just because i didn't know you at all   Kiss me, please kiss me  But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation  You know it makes me so angry 'cause i know that in time  I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye   Did you say 'no, this can't happen to me,'  And did you rush to the phone to call  Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind  Saying maybe you didn't know him at all  You didn't know him at all, oh, you didn't know   Well, the bells out in the church tower chime  Burning clues into this heart of mine  Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memories  Offer signs that it's over... it's over     so yeah, anyway, I get to see my long time friend JOHNNY MAYER this Saturday! Maybe he'll be giving me a special birthday surprise...mmmm yummms!  Thats it for now! thanks for listening and thanks for taking the time to know me. -J

        APRIL 30, 2003 So I have some stuff to say damnit and it's all going on here. If you don't want to hear get the hell out ;) j/k So my birthday was 2 days ago. I'm 24 now. I thought it would feel different but in actuality I'm just more stressed out than usual. My lease is up in July. I am very confused about what I'm going to do. I really want to move to Boston. I was there visting one of the COOLEST GIRLS EVER (her name is Jen) she's a cool gal. But when I was there I realized that I haven't been as happy as I was that past week in months. My life is pretty pointless right now. I think I might move back home and save some dough. I wish everything was planned out for me so that way I would never have to make a decision that I regretted later on. But I guess maybe that's what life is all about. oh yeah and if it is then LIFE SUCKS!  Other than that I'm totally psyched because I get to go see my secret boyfriend JOHN MAYER this weekend in west palm beach. I better wear a bib because I'll be drooling hardcore. I'm totally excited about seeing my family too. I haven't been home in awhile and I miss everybody alot. THEN check this out - May 23rd I'm going to see "The Rock God" (Butch Walker) as Jen likes to call him at Will's Pub! ummm ok ..... I'm gonna be on stud muffin overload! What will I do with myself...? This is gonna be crrrrrrrazzzzzy! Maybe I'll meet me a little rocker of my own and get some sugar! ;) I have very high hopes apparantly. OK so I'm out for now! I hope you enjoyed the first sneak peak into my pathetic life. More to come.......keep checkin. -J ps - If you don't know who Jason Mraz is - check him out because I want to be his crazy power puff girl!

      I don't even feel like writing since I'm so bummed out and all. I figure I should say something at least. Well, I'm broke, yet again! I hate life. This time it's pretty bad! I joke about living off of Mac and Cheese but I'm serious this time. We're talking zip, nada, nothing. I had to buy a new monitor because my other one got blowed up. As for everything else in life. Times are a little confusing in my head! Everytime I think about moving back home I get really scared. I don't know why. I  guess I'm just very used to living on my own that I feel like I'm depriving myself of something. But saving money is going to benefit me in alot of ways and I know deep down its the right choice. I hope I can find a good enough job so I can pay my bills and actually be able to save.  James called me 4 times in the past 2 days. I shouldnt really blow that out of proportion because he was just trying to get ahold of me since I was never at my phone. He's going to bring Freddy over on Friday so I can see him. Its been months since me and fred have hung out. James seemed really sad or depressed about something on the phone. I hope everything is alright but it's really not my place to worry about that anymore. Even though it almost comes as a natural instinct. I did it for so long. James' birthday is on Sunday. I bought him a birthday card even though there really isnt any reason for me to do nice things for him. I really do care about him so that's why I did it. I can pretend that I hate him and call him an asshole as much as I want but I know deep down inside I'll always be thinking about him and hoping he's alright. AND if any of you think I'm crazy for that , I'm sorry. But it's really hard being me. I'm gonna go do something else now... probably call the bank and cry Love you guys, JENNIE

      So the window is fixed on the car. It's always nice to actually be able to see while you're driving. I've had a major headache all day! Too much stress. I'm just gonna be like the guy in Office Space and not care about anything. Things seemed to work out for him in the long run. I'm still pissed about my cd's though - grrrrrrrrrrrr..........So, I was at Target today and this little kid decided to point out that I had a "big butt". If I wasn't on my period I would've ignored it but since Aunt Flow got the best of me today I turned around and said "hey thanks for pointing that out but surprisingly I'm fully aware of how big my butt is since I've had to live with it all my life". I guess 8 year olds get very surprised when adults actually talk back to them because he gave me a look like he was about to piss in his pants then ran off to his mom. He's gonna grow up to be a nice guy, I can tell already. So, besides the headache and all the stresses from auto glass repair men and 8 year olds, I had a wonderful dinner with my friend Justin. He took me to Chili's for a belated birthday dinner. Good times! He's a great kid! I'm gonna miss the hell out of him. What a fox! He's another Full Sail kid who I'm hoping won't forget about me when he gets all big and famous and starts making movies. I'm always the person who knows the cool people but never the cool one themself.  Oh yeah, one more lovely thing that happened to me today. On my way home from Target I passed the Blood Mobile and thought I would do the world a great favor and donate. So it took me about 10 minutes to wait at the stop light to make my U-Turn. I spend about 20 minutes waiting inside the trailor filling out paper work and all because I took Ibuprofen for my headache this morning (god forbid), they refuse, yet AGAIN, to take my blood. If I have to walk out of a blood mobile without giving blood and looking like someone who has AIDS  one more time I might scream!!!! Well, EXCUSE ME for trying to do something nice. See ya in another 3 years Blood Bank. I'll remember next time to not breathe all day before I come in because god forbid I do something else to contaminate it for you!  Can you tell I'm a little frustrated today or what? -Jennie "Pimp Juice" Schnirel

      Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me Oh things are gonna happen naturally And taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side  And balancing the whole thing But often times those words get tangled up in lines And the bright lights turn to night Until the dawn it brings A little bird who'll sing about the magic that was you and me   Cause you and I both loved What you and I spoke of What you and I spoke of Others only dream of the love that I love   See I'm all about them words Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive Now you and I, you and I  Not so little you and I anymore And with this silence brings a moral story  more importantly evolving is the glory of a boy   you and I both loved what you and I spoke of and others just read of and if you could see now well I'm already finally out of  and it's okay if you have go away just remember the telephone works both ways and if I never ever hear it ring if nothing else I'll think the bells inside  have finally found you someone else and that's okay cause I'll remember everything you sang   you and I both loved what you and I spoke of and others just read of and if you could see now well I'm already finally out of words.   -Jason Mraz

      It started out as a good weekend! I finally came to the conclusion that I WILL be moving back to West Palm Beach once my lease is up. It's going to be hard to adjust to but it's just something that needs to be done. Then Saturday night , oh yeah ,  I saw Mr John Mayer and I HAVE IT ON TAPE. Marie and I did some sneaky camara smuggling into Sunfest and got it recorded. Its only bits and pieces because we had to shut it off everytime we saw a security guard but yet still very cool. OH and I brought my rebel and got some awesome close up pictures of him...... those of you who are thinking "damn I want a copy of that" are gonna be gettin some in the mail so don't you worry your pretty little heads off. Now , in case most of you haven't realized this, whenever something really good is going on in Jennie's life something really BAD is going to happen very very soon. It's inevitable. There is no stopping it. This morning I went to get in my car to take my pictures of John Mayer over to the one hour photo, when to my surprise my driver's side window had been busted in. Jennie's immediate response..."FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK". Then I proceed to call the cops , file a police report and vaccuum out my car because there was glass everywhere. The only thing stolen was about 20 of my cd's. Now most people would think I got lucky. I'd have to say "lucky" is not what comes to my mind. Lucky is something I will never be. Not only did the fuckers steal my Butch Walker and 2 of my John Mayer cd's, they took one of my cd books that had every cd I bought while I was away in Boston. Even the white stripes cd that Harris bought me for my birthday (sorry panks). Luckily the Guster mix Jen made me was in there. My mom mentioned this morning that she hoped those thugs "choked on their breakfast and died this morning". That just about sums everything up. I guess Jennie can't smoke in her car OR see where she's going because there's a big piece of FUCKING PLASTIC DUCT TAPED TO MY DAMN WINDOW. I'm not angry, really.......  -J ps - James called me to say Happy Birthday (I hate when mean people try to be nice)

      So, how's it going guys? This has been one of the craziest months I've had in a long time. It's like the problems just seem to never end. I finally got my internet fixed but I had to do it myself! AWW yeah check out these skills. Well, anyway, my car shit on me again so Dad wants me to trade it in this weekend. SO that is what I will be doing! I was supposed to have a relaxing weekend with my family but now it's going to be totally stressfull. I do appreciate everyone's help in making this new car possible. I don't seem appreciative sometimes but I really really am thankful for all the effort.  I'm meeting Pete Yorn on Monday! thought I might toss that one in there!!!!!! A really weird thing happened this week. My friend Amanda who works with me had a cousin die this week. He was found dead in his car on Monday morning. He was only 24. I had to drive her home from work because she had too many tears in her eyes to drive. On my way back to work that day I got to thinking about how much we take for granted everyday of our lives. We spend so much time letting little things annoy us and making us angry. We spend too much time fighting with people we love and not having enough pride to apologize and make things better. We spend too much time holding grudges on things that don't really even matter to us in the long run. This guy had been through alot in his life and had decided to change things and make his life better and even though we don't know why he died we do know that dying was the last thing he wanted to do. Especially at the age of 24. If anyone I know has taken the time to read this blog, I just want to let you know that I love you very much and appreciate you being in my life.  You are the people that have made me the person I am today. We don't get the time to say things like this alot but just know that it is felt no matter what.   - J Take care SUCKAAAAAAS! (Be good to eachother ! )  *Cd's I've been listening to *  Jack Johnson - On and On  Pete Yorn - Day I Forgot  Jason Mraz - Waiting for My Rocket To Come (don't I wish)  Ben Harper - Diamonds on the Inside  Butch Walker - Left of Self Centered  John Mayer - Any Given Thursday ( it makes me feel like I'm at the show again)   and I wish I was listening to Liam Lynch but some thug stole it from me!

      Man, I don't even know where to start. This has been the week from hell. I don't know how many things can go wrong in one week but I'm sure I could win an award for it. After my car getting broken into, the monitor on my computer blew up. I thought that was the end of everything going bad. For a couple of days everything was getting back to normal. The only thing I had to stress out about was seeing James when Fred came over. I knew that would be hard and it was. I don't really want to get into that but I will just say he looks better than he did in a long time. Good for him. grrrrrrr.... So I spent some lovely time with my precious little baby Fred. I love him so much! I hope I get to see him after I leave. OK so now for the bad stuff. After James left I went to get online and look up some shows at the HOB (house of blues for you losers) and my internet was down. That was Friday and this is Sunday! So I had to force myself to go to the public library downtown for some internet access and just as I suspected, hotmail deleted e-mails because my account was over it's limit. Maybe it wouldn't be over the limit if I didn't get 104 pieces of junk mail in the past few days! PEOPLE we need to band together and do something about this. I have had enough!!! So , yesterday I had a super duper fun day with Charlie. We met at the mall and then went down to virgin records , where TO MY SURPRISE, If i bought the new Pete Yorn cd for 9.99 I got a free backstage pass to the show!!! hmmm I wonder who is going to meet Pete Yorn on May 19th?? Which Pete Yorn Fan is it? I think it's this one! Then we have Mr. Butch Walker on the 23rd.(ps - Thank you Jen for calling me Friday night and playing some live Butch for me! It made me smile on my bad day. I knew Harris wouldn't call so THANKS ;) So, as for the shows coming up, I'm glad I have something to look forward to! It's refreshing for a change. AND Apparantly, Charlie is going with me to both shows. EVERYONE CROSS YOUR FINGERS!!!! ;) Other than that I can't really think of much more to say. I'm planning on going home and watching some blockbuster movies and sitting in my hot apartment for the rest of the night! Feel free to call if you want to chat. Everything is going ok I suppose until I leave the library and  I get out to my car in the parking garage and find out that I don't have enough cash to pay for parking. Look for me in the news! I'll be the one driving the shitty black toyota corolla waving a parking ticket out of the window screamin' "HELL YEAH SUCKAAAAAAS YOU AIN'T MAKIN ME PAY FOR THIS!" :)!!!   We'll talk soon! I HOPE :( Love, JENNIE

      I'm at the point in my life right now where everything seems to be coming together and falling apart at the same time. Its a very confusing place to be and I don't recommend it to anyone. Here's the dilly. I finally traded in my piece of shit car (even though it was sad to say goodbye) for a brand new 2003 toyota Matrix - Oh yeah, you guessed it. Everyone wants to be like me. I really need to get some tint on my windows so people will stop staring at me at stoplights thinking "God I wish I was as cool as her". So this has made me very happy. Its one step closer to moving back home and saving money and just getting restarted on things.That's how things seem to be coming together. On the other hand, I'm leaving a place where I've gotten comfortable, a job I love and people who I will miss very much. Am I making the right decision? Who cares at this point....Everything turn out ok for me in the end. Its the trauma in between that I have to deal with. I CAN DOOOOOOO IT! So, I was told by an unnamed friend that I was slackin' on the blog entries. You guys want to know about PETIE OR WHAT? Oh I will tell you! So the show was awesome . Grandaddy and Year of the Rabbit were there too. Charlie thought that Grandaddy was "snoozeville" but I enjoyed it.  Then it was Petie time. He definately blew me away. Not so much with his energy (or lack there of) but with his style and talent. He covered some awesome tunes too! "I wanna be your boyfriend" By the Ramones which he dedicated to me. ;) Then it was time for the meet and greet. I thought I was gonna fall asleep in line I was so tired. Finally, it was time to meet my future husband. Charlie got to go first and he played it all cool. Pete thanked him for being a fan and signed his cd. Then here comes Jennie...all Fro'd out because we got caught in a storm on our way into the House of Blues. I have the goofiest smile on my face. Just like they let me off the special bus. I walk up to the table and say.......*drummm rollllll* "Hi" (blank stare), Pete is like "uhhh hey" then i proceed to shove my  hand in his face so he'll shake it. I'm taking reservations for anyone who wants to stop by and look at my hand because YES I HAVE SEEN GOD AND HE HAS TOUCHED ME! So Luckily someone interrupted him and I just had time to tell him my name so he could sign my cd and then we were dragged apart from eachother. I wonder if he's thinking about me? Probably not. And If so he's making fun of the "crazy fro'd out retard at the show monday night" Well at least he definately has some recollection of me. Maybe he'll write a song for me !!!  Tomorrow night is BUTCH!!!!! I'll be callin' ya - don't worry! AND NEXT MONTH THE WHITE STRIPES!!! SUCKAAAS! As for everything else, well my life is all weird and stuff. Love, Friends, Roomates, Family - its all a big tangled web. I'm really frightened of moving back home at this point. I miss things like seeing the ocean, and coffee gallery on Lake Ave, and Dada in Delray. But, the scary thing is going there and not knowing where I'll be living. Can't stay with mom since there is no room. Marie won't get off her ass and find a house. I'm gonna be living out of the Matrix...Hey thats not a bad idea ;) So if anyone wants to give me some emotional support right now on the whole thing I would gratefully accept it. Oh yeah, I hope my friends dont ditch me once I go. I'm gonna miss them alot. I hope they feel the same way about me. OK , now for the good stuff:  Things that make me happy: (1) making someone laugh and watching milk come out of their nose. (2) seeing Freddy getting really excited as soon as he sees me , no matter how long it's been. (3) knowing that there are some people in your life who will never leave, and always be there on the other end of the phone when      you call. (4) getting on I-95 just to get off on the next exit - do you know how much time that saves? (5) a pack of smokes, a little place called patsios, some meatballs , and some good conversation.  Things that I can't stand : (1) Knowing there are people out there who would actually want to be with you if "the timing was right" or "if things were different" (2) cleaning dirty, grimey, soap scummy hair in the drain *shivers* . (3) listening to one of these two things : Doctor Pacheco twisting and turning his squeaky ass pen while he talks to you OR Doctor  Pacheco's annoying cell phone ring , which he seems to like since he never picks up his goddamn phone !  (4) Having to tell someone the truth when you know its going to hurt them but will be better for them in the long run. (5) Not being able to have hair that is just ONE COLOR ARGHHHHH  more likes and dislikes and overall nonsense to come later! Take Care of Eachother and Love you all!!! Jennie

       I say way-hey-hey, it's just an ordinary day and it's all your state of mind At the end of the day, you've still got to say... it's all right.   *YAWWWWWWN* I forgot what it was like to stay up until 5 am and do absolutely nothing and then for some reason wake up at noon. I think I should still be asleep. It's ok, I have a cup of coffee and about a million mp3's downloaded from last night to listen to. I was talking to Justin online all night. It's nice to get two really sad people together and just talk about how sad you are. Sounds like fun huh???? One of my favorite past times. The only downfall is you're still sad in the morning because as you were sleeping it made you dream of every single person you loved and miss to this day...good times. I TOTALLY SAW BUTCH WALKER ON FRIDAY NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!! Man, Will's Pub is about the size of an asshole. It smelled like one too. In this incidence it was perfect because when Butch came down into the audience to sing to us Jennie got to stand right next to him. I want to thank you Butch Walker for picking me to stand right in front of when you bent over to play your guitar because you rubbed your ass all over me. I did not let this chance go to waste. I put out my hand to cop a feel. But to my dismay there was only a saggy piece of jean where an ass should be. Yes ladies, Butch has absolutely NO junk in that trunk. Charlie got to cop a feel himself, but only on Butch's guitar strings ! SUCKAAAA! It was a super cool night though . ROCK! I have the whole weekend in the apartment alone. Jaime and Amber are away . It seems a little strange but I'm definately enjoying the Jennie time. I really wish I had more to say but that's it for now.  Until another day!!! Be great to one another! JENNIE

      I realize I am a big slacker and I apologize. I would've written sooner but I didn't want to bore anyone. It's 7:10 am and I'm sitting at work so I apologize for however lame this blog entry appears. Is it really necessary for the radio station to play "Mambo Number 5" this early in the morning? Even in the middle of the day the song makes me want to throw up and since I haven't even eaten anything today I feel like I might blow chunks all over this chart in front of me.OK lets get off the subject of irritating music first thing in the morning since I have the whole day to listen to it. There's no need to get upset about it right now. Let's see....what have I been up to? hmmmm NOTHING! I do wanna give props to the boys for taking me out to the Ale House the other night. As Sean referred to it as "Girl's night out" YOU GO GIRL WITH YOUR BAD SELF. It was nice to get out and see people actually conversing on a social level. I wish I could have more opportunities to go out with Richie and the boys but as luck would have it I don't since I'll be going back to West Palm Beach soon. It was all good while it lasted. *sniff sniff* My office manager is a piece of shit. I asked her last week if I could get an increase in pay since my lease was up and the only way I could stay was to either get paid more here or get a higher paying job. After working my ass off to the bone at this hell hole she tells me "the best we could probably do is 25 cents more an hour" As Jen would say , " Oh great, maybe I can get myself a tootsie roll!!" How bout them apples? So needless to say, I gave up on the idea of staying here. Maybe I'll come back, maybe i'll go somewhere else, I don't know. I'm a wanderer.....(umm yeah or at least I would liketo think so). Home won't be so bad...as long as I can move my bed into my mom's room because if anyone has ever laid in my bed they know that it's the best part of my life ;) Comfy as a cloud!   I have a question for you guys. My friend Charlie recently brought to my attention the great trucker hat phenomenon. Does anyone know what this is about or where it came from? I'm a little confused about the whole thing. I think I was unconciously accepting it before Charlie pointed it out to me and it made me think. It's just as bad as "the mullet" and the smart people stopped that all together. You still get the mullet stragglers roaming around every once in awhile who either have not "gotten the memo" or are just "too cool" to stop. Poor guys. But as Jaime said " these trucker hat people look like my family in Virginia" She didnt know whether to be offended or not. I have to agree because I saw a hat that looked just like Uncle Ralph's and ironically he lives in a mobile home and has one of those trucks that beep when you put it in reverse. Is this whole thing hitting a little close to home? I think so. For all of you cool guys out there with big ass hats sittin' about 2 feet off the top of your head with the mesh on the back, I only have one thing to say to you....."KEEP ON TRUCKIN' BOYS! LIFE'S A GARDEN, DIG IT!". What up M.R.A.Z? Hop in MY truck crazy POUND PUP! I'm so retarded! sorry no lists of cool things right now - Boss decided to actually come into the office today. Bye bye for now SUCKAAAS! Love you guys - Be good to eachother! - Jive Turkey

      My entire reasoning for moving to Orlando was not only because I needed a new start in life but it was also because I had more friends in this town than I did back home and I felt I needed to be around them. Since I've been here for the past year and a half most of them have left and moved to other cities and I suppose now it's my time. I didn't realize I'll miss this place as much as I'm going to. Ever since I decided to leave I've realized how much I really enjoy living here and how much I am going to miss some very important people in my life. So here's a little piece of sappy crap where I'm gonna make a list of all the people and maybe some other things that have made me very happy since I've been here. I wish I spent more time appreciating these people than I did complaining that I didn't have any friends. I didn't realize how many I actually had.    George  - I don't even know where to start with George. He was one of the first friends I made when I moved here. He's also the first person I thought of when I decided to move and one of the only people I would actually consider staying here for. He has such an amazing heart that he never lets anybody see and I'm so privileged that I could see through all the craziness and find that in him. I believe in him very much and have faith in everything he does. I know he feels the same way about me. He is the piece of gold that flashes on my soul. I know that no matter how far away we will be from eachother we will still feel close. At least I hope so because he is one cool motherfucker who I love very much!    Mark  - If I could have an older brother this guy would be my first pick. Mark is probably the coolest guy I know, or at least he likes to think that he is (The whole "Buffy" thing sort of throws people off a bit) .George and I like to call him "The Great OZ" because he has all the answers but for some reason nooone ever sees him. We have fun taunting eachother when one of us actually sees him or talks to him. Then the other one goes "NO WAY , THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. HE'S THE GREAT OZ" . Ok, I never said I was the cool one. I love evenings with Mark when he makes fun of everything I do. It makes me feel special in some sick, sad sort of way. I will miss him very much even though I don't see him very often. I know I will talk to him as much as I do now. Just knowing that he's not close anymore will be sad. He'll probably just tell me to "get over it". So, just for you Mark, I'm gonna try. ;)    Justin  - MY favorite pisces man in the world!!! ok this is a hard one...There are some people in life that you meet and you know it was just some strange fate that you were brought together. Thats how I  describe Justin. He's like my , for lack of a better word, twin ?!? We just share so many things in common and really understand eachother. That is such a special thing to have with another person. I met him online on one of the very first days he moved here. After we talked for awhile we found out that we lived in the same apartment complex ( like 3 buildings down from one another). And we've been friends ever since. There are so many things I'm going to miss about Justin. Listening to sad music late at night and sharing our sob stories about love lost, going out to the pub and drinking ourselves into oblivion, justin's "authentic irish toasts" , the smell of Aqua Di Gio in the air, his hugs, his fox like grin...the list could go on for days! i'm gonna miss the suckaa ok? I love ya sweets!    Richie  - How fun is THIS GUY? LAUGH IT UP ! It's Richie Russo. GET ON IN HERE GIRL! I am so grateful that Jen introduced me to Richie, i'm sorry , did I say Richie? I meant Pete. What do you expect from a half italian, goodluckin, fun lovin, orange car drivin, kick ass guy? nothing ..just hours of constant laughter and someone you know will be there to listen when you have guy troubles. I'm gonna miss this suckaaaa so much but I know one day all the half italians will be reunited in one  place where  we will all live happily ever after...stalking bands , getting rained on, hauling fruit over the border, and making those oh so famous road trips. Peace out my brotha man! THERE'S NO MOVIN! (I wish)   Amanda  - She was one of the only people who actually took the time to get to know me when I started my job. I  thought she was older than me and then come to find out she was only 19 years old. I was so baffled. She has such an amazing spirit and I love her to death. I'm going to miss her most of all out of everyone here at work. Plus I'm losing my workout buddy *sniff sniff* oh yeah I had to cancel my gym membership so I guess it doesnt matter!   Adam  - ok everytime I refer to anything that has to do with meatballs and conversation this is who I'm referring to. I haven't really known him for a long time but words can't explain how much I'll miss this fellow! He's gotten me through some really stressfull times in my life and always lifts my spirits. I try to do the same for him, I hope it works. I've always said that I've been the person that everyone comes to with their problems and when I'm having one myself I never want to talk about it because I feel like noone wants to listen. Well now I have someone who I completely trust, admire and respect and wouldn't give him up for the world! Thanks sweetheart!  VIVA LA PATSIOS!   Charlie  - aka Coolio McCool. The brotha of all that is Cool!!! Charlie Bird!!! I'm gonna miss yo crazy ass! why are you leaving? Oh wait I'm the one who's bailing out. Sorry man. I really wish things were different from the beginning. We could've been hanging out so long ago! Charlie is the coolest guy ever. He gives the greatest hugs too! If you ever get a chance to meet him ask him for one of those infamous hugs! They make you smile! ;)   Jaime & Amber   -  oh yeah , these two! haha j/k  Friends ? roomates? both? I don't know but we've  had some really great times. You guys know how much you mean to me and Thanks is all i need to say. Why be sappy when  you can be happy??!!!??!!! Love you guys!     Kathu aka CHAOS!  - Chaos rules!!! I'm gonna miss you girly! GOOD TIMES!! But theres no need to talk about missin! We will see eachother all the time!! I wish her all the luck in the world because if anyone needs something good to happen for a change it's her. And she definatley deserves it!!!!    Anthony Demaris   - If you would have only called.........   Chuck  - I've saved the best for last hahahah! Chuck is the all time scorpio bastard. We have a strong love / hate relationship. No matter how much we hate eachother I can't go a day without calling  him at least 18 times. That won't change either so I hope he doesnt get too excited that I'm leaving. Chops,  you're the best! I'm gonna miss you vewwwy vewwwwy much :(   Ok that's about it. I don't want to leave...............  _- J ( take care of eachother guys!)

      Top 10 things I would like to accomplish within the next 5 years......( too many things to list for a lifetime) (oh yeah and these are not in any special order)  (1) Pay off my $9,000 credit card bill...I know I know I don't need a lecture right now.  (2) Lose approximately 500lbs - I think that would just about do it.  (3) See Third Sale play a show and/or hear their album - Its getting really frustrating to be such a big fan when you've only recently    heard ONE song....come on boys...hook a sista up!  (4)  Travel the world - HA HA HA HA  (5) Grab a couple friends, hop in the Matrix and take a really long road trip!!!! that would sooooooo ROCK!  (6 ) Become a write or photographer, live in a shack in either Chicago or Boston, drive a black mini cooper (or blue matrix) and marry one of 5 guys I listed on my MASH game. (which I cannot reveal the names on that list or I would have to kill myself , or you? I dont know)  (7) Meet Dave Attell and spend the night with him. (on the show "Insomniac" of course) Let's see I think me and Dave should roam around umm SEATTLE , yeah that would be cool. Oh my god, I'd probably be laughing so much I'd die! We're getting married! I just know it.  (8) Receive just ONE e-mail from Anthony Demaris? maybe? please?   (9) Learn how to play guitar and start my own band like Tegan and Sara and be a "Rockin Chick" *mental note* we must complete number 2 before this happens .  (10)  Have a monkey sleepover , stay up doing our hair and making banana splits!!!! ahhhhhhhhhhh thats the good life!

      I haven't written in my blog since June 18th? My oh My what is my problem? I'm sorry about that. Well, I guess today is what? July 6th? I'm leaving on the 25th. I started packin' my shit up this weekend. I haven' t really been in the mood to leave my house or see anyone lately. I think it's because I'm starting to realize that it's all going to be over soon. But like I heard in a movie once "Every minute that passes is another chance to turn things all around". I guess that's the way I have to look at things. I'm just about ready to get on with it. Right now I feel like I'm living in limbo between packed boxes and resignations and resumes. My only savior is Jack. He takes me away when I can't stand still anymore. Oh yeah by the way, Jack is what I named the matrix. Sorry for you readers who thought that I finally found love. HA ! That's a good one ;)  Ok, I'm sick of carrying on here's some lists to pass the time.................  Top 11 places I will miss in Orlando and surrounding areas : (not listed in any specific order )   (1) My bedroom, besides the fact that it gets extremely hot in here and I wake up sweating like an asshole every morning. Other than that it's perfect.  (2) Urban Outfitters - I don't know why there isn't one in every city. That's sin in my eyes.  (3) Kobe' Steakhouse - The best japanese restuarant EVA!!!!  (4) Lake Lilly - when I first moved here and started my job I was very lonely and didn't really know anyone. On my lunch breaks I felt very uncomfortable sitting in the kitchen with strangers so I'd hop in my car and drive around for an hour. Then I found Lake Lilly and I started going there everyday. It's not much to look at. Just a lake. But I did alot of thinking there watching the little white ducks harrass people for food. An hour at the lake really got me through some very emotional times. I'll never forget it.  (5) House of Blues and Hard Rock Live - ok I realize these are two different places but I'm going to miss them for the same reasons so I've combined them. I had the pleasure of seeing the following people at these places : The Strokes, Longwave, Incubus, Better than Ezra, Gin Blossoms, Coldplay, Oasis, The White Stripes, Henry Rollins, Har Mar Superstar. ...hmm I think thats about it. let me know if I forgot any. Why don't we also go ahead and throw Virgin Megastore in there. Just a great place to be....  (6) The Econ trail............. had alot of fun walking down there with Jen and Kelly. Good times. I remember after Jen left I used to go down there alone with my walk-man and think about alot of things. Mostly about how I wanted to be anywhere else but where I was at the moment. It's funny. All I ever do is want something different in life but when things are about to change all I want it do is stay the same. Damn stubborn taurus!!!!!!  (7) Cold Stone Creamery - HELLO!!!!!!!!!!!! CAKE BATTER ICE CREAM!!!!1  (8) Hotties - HELLO!!!!!!!!!!THE BEST DONUTS IN MY LIFE!!!!!!! (plus the juke box rocks my world) I HEART HOTTIES!  (9) Park Ave Cd's -  The best cd/record store in Orlando in my opinion. Even though a bunch of arrogant pricks work there. It's ok though. I'd be the same way if I owned my own record store....ahhhhh John Cusack!  (10) This one is special. There's this street called "Primrose" that a special person lives off of. I'm gonna miss driving by his house and honking my horn. I rarely ever stop by but I think it's cool to annoy people!  (11) Fiddler's Green - my second favorite pub in Florida - plus I have a lot of memories going there with Justin, drinking, and getting wasted until the point of no return - Justin is a bad boy!  FYI this week Jennie has been listening to :   * Counting Crows - Across a Wire - Live in New York  * Tegan and Sara - If it was you  * Rooney - Rooney  * Radiohead - Hail to the Thief  * Longwave - The Strangest Things  ( please add these cd's to your collections - especially Longwave - if you hate them you are free to kick my ass)  Be good to one another!!! - J

      And the count down begins.....11 days left. I can't believe it's here and I'm still in denial. I just got up the nerve to pack my videos last night (ONLY VHS) I haven't been able to make the step over to DVD packing.....that's too sad. Tonight the dishes go! I cried for the first time about it this past weekend and I've been crying ever since. I'm going to dedicate this blog to letting my good friends Jaime and Amber know that I'm really trully happy for them, that they get what they've wanted for a long time and If I ever appear to be mad at you just know I'm extremely jealous but by no means does that mean i'm angry. I'll get over it. I hate change, being a Taurus and all.....  Top 10 Things I regret doing in the past year and a half :   (1) Spending too much time focusing on the negative things happening and not enjoying the positive. (2) Dwelling on the past. (3) Not seeing Freddy as much as I would have liked to. (4) Fighting with friends over stupid things. (5) Not telling someone exactly how I feel about them until it's too late. (6) Not going to the Enzian more often. (7) Settling for "good enough" instead of looking for something better. (8) Not buying a turtle. (9) Letting people who've hurt me in the past get the best of me. (10) Failing in the whole "being independent" thing...who was I fooling?  ps - Can I be a pirate when I grow up? ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  "Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's our time to make the most of it.  How could we ever know that this would happen to me. Not that easy. No.  All along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it.  Well it's for sale go make your offer, I'll sell it for no less than what I bought it for.  Pay no more than absolutely zero." - M.R.A.Z.  -J (Be good and don't forget me)

      It's really funny when you think you've found something great and it turns out to be just as shitty as all the other times you got your hopes up. Just like a friend of mine said : "I thought I could change lanes and make the light , but I was wrong" ..... Is that not the story of our lives , or what? I spend too much time rushing to get through the light instead of sitting there and waiting it out and finally coming to the destination where I was meant to be. Fucking analogies at 11:45 at night really messes with my sleeping patterns. So what have you been up to mr blog? waiting for me to write an incredible , exciting story about my life.. well you're gonna be waitin' a while.....  Keep it real!  Jennie

      An April Day  Shoes hit the pavement and I see you scatter and run I come pounding through the grass , I'm only having fun And if you could speak I know I'd hear you scream And if you could think I know you'd wish this was just a dream But I'm only here to play and run , skip and jump, and swallow the sun I never meant to scare you away I thought maybe we both could play But it wouldn't be right You'd put up a fight  You'd squiggle and squirm And you'd toss and you'd turn But I would say in your ear, quietly so you could hear "If you only knew, Lizard dear You're the one the giants fear".    For April! I love you to the moon and back!!!!!

      "THIS IS BUDDY ELF ,WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR? " Hey guys, I'm writing you from Happening town Orlando! Aww yeah ! So I had a fun weekend re-grouping and hanging out with some friends. "some friends" meaning George and Richie. Richie and I  saw an awesome band Friday night , they are called "OUT"heheheh - If anyone wants to check them out you can at www.outrock.com! I haven't heard good music like this in a LONG time! Check out their song "Widow in the Circle Court" It's my favoooorite! If you like the lead singer you have some competition because Richie and I are already fighting over him. I'm thinking Richie might have one up on me considering the name of their band... I could be wrong though! Other than that , not much happning in the life of Jennie. Just chillin being me ....OH YEAH a Big Hell yea to George for making  me that kick ass 80's compilation! It makes me want to shake it like a polaroid picture! The only thing wrong with this weekend is that my friend Justin had to be gone! I hope you come back soon Mr. Man, I miss the hell out of you! Even though the Peacock Room was wonderful, we all know it wasn't the same without you. Alright for now I'm out! Talk to you later suckaaaaas! Be beautiful to one another! Love, Buddy Elf

      You know what really sucks? When people tell you that you are a good listener because then you end up becoming everyone's goddamn diary and when it's time to talk about yourself, then everyone seems burdened. No one calls just to say "Hi" anymore .... there's always a problem that needs to be fixed and for some reason they think I have all the answers! The amazing Jennie will be able to tell you why he's not calling, or why he calls you everyday but won't take you to dinner, or why he likes hanging out with his friends more than you. Call now and for the low price of $19.95 you can make my life a living hell like so many others already have! The funny part is I don't know why people think I have the answers when I'm sitting at home alone waiting by the phone wondering why "he" hasn't called, but do I burden others with my pathetic excuse for a life? No , I just keep it to myself and wait to hear from a friend about their problems because at least I know I'm not the only pathetic loser on the planet.   - Jennie ps - Sorry If I offended anyone.....at least you didn't have to hear me rambling about it on the phone. Be good Guys!

      Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue thought I heard you talking softly I turned on the lights the TV and the radio but still I can't escape the ghost of you What is happening to me crazy some would say Where is the life that I recognize, gone away  And I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive  Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say pride will tear us both apart Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops runaway Left me in the vaccuum of my heart What is happening to me crazy some will say where is my friend when I need you most gone away  But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive  Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and grief Fear today forgot tomorrow beside the news of holy war and holy need Our's is just a little sorrowed talk, just blown away  And I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive Every world is my world (I will learn to survive) Any world is my world (I will learn to survive) Any world is my world, every world is our world, every world

      So I didn't think it could happen again, or at all for that matter. It's funny when everything seems to be going wrong and you feel you'll always be alone, living vicariously through the lives of others and then all of a sudden..BAM! it hits you like a ton of bricks! Well, I've been hit alright, by a boy named Brandon. I can't put into words how much he means to me. It'sindescribable ,but I will say that I've found what I've been looking for and that makes me the happiest girl alive. Oh how the times have changed....  COLLIDE The dawn is breaking A light shining through You're barely waking And I'm tangled up in you Yeah  I'm open, you're closed Where I follow, you'll go I worry I won't see your face Light up again  Even the best fall down sometimes Even the wrong words seem to rhyme Out of the doubt that fills my mind I somehow find You and I collide  I'm quiet you know You make a frist impression I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind  Even the best fall down sometimes Even the stars refuse to shine Out of the back you fall in time I somehow find You and I collide  Even the best fall down sometimes Even the wrong words seem to ryhme Out of the doubt that fills your mind You finally find You and I collide  You finally find You and I collide You finally find You and I collide  - Howie Day

      YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.....   Hello there, the angel from my nightmare the shadow in the background of the morgue the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley we can live like Jack and Sally if we want where you can always find me we'll have Halloween on Christmas and in the night we'll wish this never ends we'll wish this never ends  (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you)  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always this sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting every time and as I stared I counted webs from all the spiders catching things and eating their insides like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason will you come home and stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you)

      GET YOU IN - EZRA  I sit and watch your flowers wilting in the kitchen I felt like I was one of them gasping for air.

I understand that you are going through a hard time But what you need to recognize I'm in one too You say that maybe we should take some time apart But you go your way, I'll get by, and you'll go get high You just see if I mind.

      So I finally get a chance to sit down at work and write in my bloggie doo. It's been so long since I've actually said anything substantial in this thing. I hate to admit it but I just came across a blog from and old friend who I don't talk to anymore. It made me really sad to read knowing I'm not part of her life anymore. Seems like things were happier then. I guess things were happier in Orlando all the time. I've been having dreams about moving back and living on my own, I've been driving around west palm beach and almost getting lost thinking that I was on an Orlando road. It's really freaking me out! I should see a psychic because I have no idea what to make of these things. It's just not the same here. BTW- Low and Behold I saw James Loller's wife driving next to me yesterday and let me just tell you she is definately a Gayla and a half - too much icing over at the CinnaBon ?? I think so..... alright I'm out for now Peace in the Middle Crease...Jennie
