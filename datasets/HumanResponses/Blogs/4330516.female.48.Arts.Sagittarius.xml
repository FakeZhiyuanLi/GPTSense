						   Its my second favorite kind of day in l.a., overcast, cool and cloudy. my favorite day in l.a. is when its raining cats and dogs and the whole city goes quiet and clean and the trees lose their layer of dust and shine w new green-ness.... yeah, that hasn't happened in a long f**king time.... anyway, my husband adam sent me this blogging info and i decided to set this up. i have, for awhile, wanted to be able to extend into a larger forum some of the ideas and discussions that regularly take place in my classes w actors. i am consistently blown away by what happens when a group of artists (and know this about me, my reference to actors as 'artists' is about as artsy as you'll catch me being... maybe.) are encouraged to dialogue about their craft. the conversations rarely stay within the contained topic of acting and almost always veers into discussions of life and its participants, i.e. all of US, you and me... i know that we live in a media obsessed culture. the question is, seemingly, no longer  when  will i get my fifteen minutes of fame, but  what  am i willing to do to get my share... acceptance, being permission to move ahead, i accept this era and my part so that i can explore what is available to be learned by being born here and now. nostalgia be damned! i say  these  are the 'good old days' if we know how to live in them both as an observer  and  a participant... the person who chooses acting as their career is choosing, quite often, a difficult path. from the p.o.v. of a person who works with everyone, from those whose trophies were presented on a global stage to those whose only trophies were recently presented on a quickly fading high school stage, the fears and concerns of the actor/artist are universal. the disquieted ,unsatisfied nature of the artist seems inherent, rarely finding a place to rest for too terribly long. the inner critic rages as mercilessly and as loudly as outer critics, parents, casting directors, who, under pressure and with no understanding of how delicate the artists sensibilities are, will issue thoughtless feedback through an agent or manager... now, this is a rash generalisation, many casting directors have moved from the career of being actors themselves into the world of casting and miraculously have retained a love and respect for actors andther processes. from where i sit, i wish these casting people could see the difference when an actor is going in for someone they feel respected by vs. those who forget that ultimately the actor is creating their art not from a canvas or piece of marble, but from themselves... so vulnerable. perhaps i will put some effort into collecting the names of casting people who live the love... we should come up with a name for and give them awards for retaining their humanity in a business that says don't take too long with no names, but do find the next julia roberts and do it now! now let me be clear, i do not recommend coddling, i recommend clarity and the actors who have studied with me through the years know that i prize clarity in my communication above all else... that said, i see no reason to EVER lose sight that an audition, or an acting class is nothing more than a random grouping of chaotic elements that enters and exits the life of an actor with such speed and repetition that if the experience be allowed to morph into barnacles of cynicism seems too counter productive... and often appeals to the perfectionist that is keeping score along with the inner critic... i work with an actor who is a veteran of television shows and films, her career has soared and crashed and is now in mid soar again. we rarely have a session where she doesnt cry about something or another... is she self indulgent? are the tears not authentic? NEVER.  she feels it all and expresses it all. i actually envy her. and if she ever stops feeling everything, because she does laugh as loudly as she mourns, it will be a sad day for actors everywhere because the inspiration to feel,  to actually feel,  is few and far between . i often times challenge actors as to why they would take classes with me when they so rarely inquire as to my perception of good acting... i ask what would you do if you'd studied w me forever and then found out that i thought the best acting was some sort of self conscious acting that made you want to leave acting forever and open up a bakery somewhere... well for those who care, my version of the best acting is when it doesnt feel, smell or taste like acting, it feels like life. and that is to say, it feels unpredictable, spontaneous and free... who do you think fits in this category? i gotta run, jonesy needs a walk and an up and coming actor named cam is on his way to my office to put an audition on tape... tonight is a fundraiser for my friend andrea's documentary about the march for women's rights on washington last april... you should visit their web site and purchase a couple wax bush tee shirts, instant classics, even if we dont agree w the questions , i still feel the need to support the question ask-ers and my friend andrea is one hell of a questioner. the website is  urlLink waxbush2004.com   and with all the preparation going into burning man, leaving on monday the 30th, not back till the 7th, i dont know when i will have time to write but will try. i promise. just know this about me, the reason i have a career in hollywood is because I DO NOT DROP NAMES, i believe in the privacy of my relationships w artists and so please dont ask and i apologise in advance for any frustrations... and yet, i look forward to your questions about whatever and whomever. i am only as good a teacher as i am a student... so lets get into it!
