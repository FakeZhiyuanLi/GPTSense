       Hi Again, Today I went to the library. I go to the library about once every 2 months which isnt very often, but when I do go whell lets just say my bag is a  lot  fuller than when I went in. For example I got about 3 large books on PHP/MySQL for my student to which I am teaching programming. Also I got a very large book on linux which I have always been interested in but never really got enthused into. So pretty much I just had the most boring day in history. But tommorow may be a little more interesting but that reamins to be seen so until tommorow its dinner time and i'm not one to waste food :D.

       Today was a pretty standard, holiday day, I watched some TV, listened to some Music, plays on the computer and well just pretty much wasted the day. But one really cool thing I found whilst browsing the net was this artice in the NZ Hearld  urlLink Couples' nervous system linked by implants in limbs , I know, I was initially mystified and amazed when I read this article. I especially liked the idea that  most human brains will be linked electronically through a global computer network That would eliminate the need for school, YAY. But also eliminate the need for workman etc as if one needed to fix a stove then all thatperson needs to do would be to think about it and learn how to do it. This also raises another question about how will people get money apart from those people maintaining the computer systems. This all sounds too matrixy now that i think about it. So to finish i will quote a very famous quote  The Matrix Has You Neo

       OMG!!! I was just reading about the European Union's court case against Microsoft asking them to remove their Media Player from being shipped with Windows. They should just get over it, obviously if there is a better Media Player than WMP (Windows Media Player) which personally I think that there is, people will just get it. Jeez they should just let Microsoft do its thing. I mean they are moaning about WMP now but a while ago it was Internet Explorer and they still are not happy with Internet Explorer being shipped with Windows, but when Apple ships Safari with its OS no one complains do they, I think its just the general hate of Microsoft and people should get over themselves.

       Today, well today was kinda  odd  you mite say. It's the school holidays, so as usual i'm hoping to get lots done but about 98% of that stuff wont get done until ages later. And today was no exception, I was hoping to get a lot of my program writing done today and not have to worry about it for the rest of the holidays, But as it turns out I woke up thinking it was 8:30AM but alas it was actually 1:45PM, and from the vast reaches of my house there were screams of anger and hatred as I realized that the day was virtually wasted. So I decided to start on something that I could finished without being awake until the early hours of the morning so I made this, my blog, I had actually been meaning to do this for a while but never got around to it. So here I am and here you are and that's about it, so over the next however long I will talk here about my trials and tribulations as an "ordinary" New Zealand College Student.
