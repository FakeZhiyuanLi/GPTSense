      Ha! I'm printing report off now, just in case anyone cares. Does anyone care either about the printing or this whole blog? Doesn't matter to me, I'm just doing it for shits and giggles y'all. Anyway, I consider my work done for the week now, and it's only ten to four. So, got an hour and a bit to piss around on the net. Kinda like i've been doing all day. No - less than an hour - got a training exercise on the lifeboat at five, so I'd better leave here about four thirty... sorry, just thinking aloud... Roll on weekend! Yay!

      Done some deep breathing, and had a mug of tea (BTW: that's teabag in, hot water in, splash of milk - any milk, couldn't give a fuck if it's negative fat, decaff, no carb, from a holy cow on the banks of the Ganges, or just boggo UHT - and stir once. leave teabag in to ensure strength, an admirable attribute in tea) and relaxed. Since last post, I've finished my progress report but not printed it. I'm hoping for some kind of inspiration to strike, so I've got some more to put in, but in the meantime, I'll make do with triple line spacing and margins the size of the M6. Never mind, apparently it's nothing to stress about, so I won't. Stress? Me? Never! I reckon stress is an over rated artifact - i seem to do quite well without any at all.... which is nice.

      Gah! Why do people feel compelled to tell everyone about their deepest introspections all the goddamn time? Just flicking through some blogs, there's a whole heap of people out there who just seem to want other people to recognise how fucking profound they are... Why is it not considered 'cool' to just be happy and piss around? But no, it's cool to wallow in misery. Well, there seems to be two camps who have offended me today:  1.  'I'm so mature and have such responsibilities you'd never believe' Instead of bitching about how you're sooo busy working all hours God sends to fund your shoe/designer clothes/Laura Ashley paperweight addiction, why not ditch the job, and lighten up? This life is about fun, not getting a big number in your bank account and a house either so full of objet-fucking-d'art you can't move or so minimalist there's nothing to do but count how much money you spent to have nothing in your house just to impress people how cool you are as to not need anything to sit on. Dammit! Wankers! And then, they have the gall to look down their nose on someone who's out enjoying themselves - 'Yah, like, it's like, sooo not, like,  cool to like, do things that are, like, fun. Like, we just, like, hang out, like, drinking coffee, like, and being, like bored, cos, like, it's the cool thing, like, to like, do.'That brings me onto another thing - coffee. It's just a sodding hot drink, not a work of bleeding art! It makes no difference if it's got steamed milk bubbled through it and chocolate shavings from Nepal scattered on top - it won't make you any better a person, because I'll have had to wait behind you for ten fucking minutes while it's been stirred seven times clockwise, chanted over and had vaporised fucking mung beans wafted over it. And all I want is a cup of tea - bag, hot water. Dammit! Where was I? Ah yes. Like. Can people not leave this poor word alone for more than six seconds? Like, it's so, like, annoying at the end of the day. And if I hear that one once more, there's going to be actual physical violence. At the end of the day. To be fair - that really gets on my nerves as well. Can people not formulate phrases themselves? I know we're supposed to recycle stuff, but not what David fucking Beckham and stick woman say... dammit. RIght, now I'm going to move onto the second bunch of people who have annoyed me today:  2.  I hate the world and I want to die. What is with these people? Why do they wallow in their own misery? Don't tell me it's depression, it's not, it's teenage angst (which is understandable at 14, but in your mid twenties, c'mon) coupled with a want to be different and somehow special. Do these people enjoy living in gloom? Yeah, like, I was up all night, thinking about death, like, I'm so profound, I can see there's no point to living, so I'm going to dwell on death and misery until I grow out of it. It's true, there is no point to living, no ultimate target, so why not lighten up and have some fucking fun while you've got the chance? Man, these people get to me. I'm sure they just want to be miserable for some reason. Do they want sympathy? Because they're not going to get it from me until they stop listening to backwards organ music. Dammit. In fact, I find it downright offensive - there are thousands of people out there who genuinely suffer from depression, and you wouldn't know it until they tell you - they're just doing their best to get by and not wallow (i know, i've used that word a lot today) in self-pity.  Right, better stop here before I get too carried away... later!

      Work? Work? What is this? It's amazing, I find work so fascinating - I can stare at it for hours on end, but sadly it won't do itself. Which is a shame, because the weather is STILL lush! It's been a whole week of pleasant weather here, I'm frankly astounded. Or is it just normal for this time of year, but the bleakness of winter blocks it out? Who cares, it's ace and I'm not taking it for granted. Sadly, though, the swell has dropped off and the wind moved onshore and freshened, so this weekend isn't looking too hot for surfing. Maybe I should take OneHand out for a sail... haven't for quite a while now. That's maybe a good saturday afternoon activity - think saturday morning is going to be fairly hangover based.... Was having a slightly-under-the-influence contemplate last night about stuff, but didn't really come to any conclusions about anything drastic. But, it passed an hour or so waiting for sleep. But what is a bit odd is I decided last night that I would wake up a bit earlier than usual today to go for a run. And it worked, without setting my alarm clock - woke up at seven, unprompted. OK, so it's not that fantastic, but it made me chuckle into my weetabix after my run - went along sea front, up Consti, down to Clarach and back, and was very pleasant. Stopped at the top of Consti to look at the sea for a couple of minutes. No ground swell at all, but there's wind swell. Still useless for surfing tho, as it's from the north... There had been a fire on the cliff just north of Consti - bracken and grass all burnt, but trees still standing. Not sure when it was, but it still smelt smokey. Right, best get back to the 'W' word...

      The last few days here have been mighty sunny, and up until yesterday we'd been pretty lucky with the surf, too. Lushness has abounded in many forms. Nice waves, the water's warming up - have ditched boots and gloves, and have started wondering where my shorty is - and some good sessions with a bunch of people. Stayed in till nearly eleven the other night, guessing when the next wave would be. Surfing wise, it wasn't a massive success, but I reckon the solar euphoria from earlier in the day had carried on with us. In fact, everyone seems cheery this week. Must be the weather. I always think the warmth from the sun  feels  wholesome somehow. I don't understand it. It's a bit like cold air in the morning feels cleansing when you're hungover, and cool water feels soooo nice after you've been sweating all day in a sweat and fart smelling office... nice. Righto, back to it..

      Have now cycled up Penglais hill twice in one day. Am feeling close to death but strangely noble. Might go and get something to eat, I'm a little peckish now.  It's also come to my attention that the weekend is taking an inordinate amount of time getting here. It's still only Thursday afternoon. I seem to have spent an entire month at work this week. Progress has been slow. Send reinforcements. Shoot the messenger. ETA 1635UTC. Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo this for a game of soldiers. Only an hour before I can sneak off home, i reckon. Barbie on the beach tonight, should be fun. It's ace, however grown up, jaded and cynical everyone gets, it takes a real old misery to not enjoy eating incinerated sausages. The magic of barbecues. If someone cooked you sausages under the grill and they came out with a thick layer of carbon, reeking of petrol and frozen inside, you'd think they were trying to kill you. But given an identical sausage from a heaps of burning charcoal, and yummy! Ah, the fickleness of the human nature....

      I've just actually read what the quiz said about me... "kinky isn't a feather...its using the whole damn chicken! and you kno it. you are so kinky that even you are afraid of yourself sometimes." a whole chicken? How the hell do you persuade a chicken that it wants to join in the party? But ok, i get the picture. Afraid of myself? Shit, i'd better go hide, i can see me creeping up behind me....         Here, chicken chick chick chicken.....

      On my rich and varied travels through blogland, I've come across a phenomenomnoemeomen. Quizzes. Every other person has a link to a quiz, and so, after seeing a whole load of these i decided to have a look... Well, i can find out what care bear i am (forgotten) what 80's toy i am (spirograph), but mainly i've found out that all the quizzes are done by kids who think they're vampires. It's true. Go to quizilla.com and see for yourself - find out what vampire you are....what colour is your vampire cloak...But there's a few funny ones, once you can sort out what is and what isn't written by some 13 year old kid who tries to be pale and interesting... And then, you can post your result anywhere you like, just so everyone can find out your Sesame street soul mate, or whatever...F'rinstance:     kinky isn't a feather...its using the whole damn chicken! and you kno it. you are so kinky that even you are afraid of yourself sometimes.    urlLink     What type of SEX do You enjoy?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     I created a quiz myself, just for shits and giggles. It tells you what kind of fool you are. It's mainly (mainly? pah! entirely, more like) non-complimentary, but if you don't like it, don't take it.  urlLink What kind of fool...  So, what kind of fool are you?

      Seems that there's a frighteningly large number of people around who think that they're vampires... What the hell is that all about? Never mind, to each their own, i suppose. Have discovered a new hangover cure - cycling up the hill to uni - by the time you get there, you no longer have a hangover, you have multiple organ failure and are in danger from drowning in your own sweat... still, it's free, faster than walking and riding down again is ace. In fact, riding down is quicker than driving, which is handy to know, especially now i've got my lifeboat pager - wahoo, get to actually be useful now!! - and a whole bunch more fun. Went wakeboarding yesterday, after a fashion - we didn't have a proper rope so we borrowed a spinnaker sheet and tied a paddle on the end. Success was limited, but it was a bit of a giggle, especially when it cam to get the boat out the water again - the tide had dropped, so the steep part of the beach was out the water and the slipway winch bitched moaned and carped until the rope snapped. After that, Fairy (my car) came to the rescue and hoiked the boat up off the beach. What a palaver, tho. Cheesus. Then went out and got drunk, but the pier was poo. Rammed to capacity, sweaty as i was after getting up the hill this morning and playing shite music. Last week, it was ok, but last night, they played half of one good tune, which then skipped so the dj tried to placate everyone with Justin Fucking Dumbass Wet Timberlake. Man. Maybe I just wasn't drunk enough...?

      Sometime within the next 48 hours.... It's going to be sooo nice to go for a surf again - haven't been for about a week now, and that's frankly too long without a surf. How is someone supposed to cope with that? I think it's going to be a fairly big swell so the trap might get busy. Maybe I'll head up the coast for a sesh on thursday eve... Will have to assess the situation. The weekend's looking good, surfwise which is a good job, seeing as we're going on a surf trip....Gennith here we come!

      It's hot. Waaaaay hot. I've opened all the office windows in the hope of enticing some movement of the air, but to no avail. It's like breathing treacle in here, and that isn't helping my productivity, which is never anything to shout about anyway. My task for today is to come to grips with an ion optics simulation program... fun, huh? The dude who wrote it must have spent, ooh, minutes over the interface, which is vaguely reminiscent of the kind of interface you'd get at a soviet nuclear power station in the seventies... but, the rest of the program seems to work well, if I could just wrap my head round it... At least it comes with a book. Well, it could probably be better described as a tome. It must have taken an area of rainforest the size of Australia to produce and is full of obscure little snippets of what would be information if I could understand it... 'Click the TOB button in the CWF panel...' I can see nothing that says 'TOB' or 'CWF' anywhere on any screen that i can find. I think it's mocking me... How can a computer program instill such a level of paranoia in an otherwise sane person? (OK, there's a fairly major assumption in that last statement, but just let it go, yeah?) I think some contemplative beard stroking is in order...

      "Phthalocyanine masturbation" There you go. Only one page on the whole of googles database has those two words in it. However, I can't seem to take any feeling of fulfilment from this discovery. That is probably a good thing, i reckon. Anyone finding satisfaction from this fact, or indeed the act (whatever that entails, i hate to imagine) must be a pretty odd person. Not necessarily a bad or stupid person, just an odd one.  I quite fancy some toffee at the moment. Maybe I'll go and find some.

      In a sentence - the most miserable, pretentious pile of crap i've ever had the misfortune to sit through... Is it somehow cool to not enjoy watching happy films? Is it the done thing to be miserable? (this sounds a bit familiar....) OK, let's ignore the fact the film had no uplifting elements to it whatsoever and was an epic of gloom... the characters - i warmed to none of them. They were all either two dimensional or thoroughly dislikeable. The scene sequence - what the fuck were they thinking? Did they mean to put it all in a random order or had they just dropped everything on the cutting room floor and stuck it together any old way? The random order gave nothing to the film whatsoever. It just made it suck more. Was it trying to be intellectual? Am i just too stupid to appreciate the depiction of whatever the hell it was they were trying to depict? I don't know, but if they think you have to be miserable to be cerebral, then fuck 'em! All in all - pile of crap. If i hadn't been in a foreign city with nothing else to do i would have walked out after ten minutes. How long was it? It seemed like a week...  I am feeling:  Glad i've never got to see that heap of horsecrap again  I am listening to:  Faithless  The surf here is:  Still pants

      I think it's some time about now that marks my beards first year anniversary. I've gone a whole year without shaving (except the occasional trim) and to be honest, i haven't missed it one bit. I've got to a stage where i couldn't imagine life without it. It's kept my chin warm through winter and been indispensible for winding up Rachel (a friend of mine, who has a facial hair phobia... and a seaweed phobia... and a whole collection of odd phobias... still, she gets through the day ok...) I'm now trying to decide on a beard strategy - do i continue as i am going, just maintaining it, or do i go for a change? Maybe getting it really long....? Maybe as i am: since i've hit upon a way of keeping it tidy(ish) i haven't been asked if i'm in the taleban... Also, i now have a whole bunch of friends who have never known me without the beard... they'd only be confused if i got rid of it.... Maybe it needs a name....  It has also come to my attention that i've managed to keep a beard longer than i've ever managed with a girlfriend... could the two factors be linked?

      It's been over a week since i last went surfing, and that is just too damn long! Where has the surf gone? When is it coming back? Is this the start of the flat summer? It's just not cricket. Which is good, because I'm not that keen on cricket. It's ok if it's a stupid game on the beach, but watching it on tv... why would anyone do that? and golf? that has to be the most boring thing on earth to watch... darts, bowls, snooker... why? Football and tennis i can understand, even tho i'm not keen myself, and rugby's not bad to watch, but golf? golf? and why will the bbc happily pull all normal programs for six hours of golf, but not even squeeze in three minutes of surfing? ever! bastids! And, while i'm ranting, what's this not-having-the-simpsons-on-at-six horsecrap all about? The Simpsons was virtually the only thing worth watching! Tried watching Big Brother for a bit last night. What a sack of wank. I think i managed two minutes of pretentious, yet moronic, conversation before i'd had enough. If people are stupid, they should just accept it and not attempt to psychoanalyse themselves. No-one can psychoanalyse themselves, it's impossible to be objective. It's like trying to open a box with a crowbar that's inside it. And here's a clue for the inmates - a valid philosophy of life probably won't, like, have the word 'like' making up, like, half of it. Or end with 'innit'.  I know, like that does sound, like very snobbish, but, like it drives me up, like, the fucking wall, innit. See what happens when i don't get to surf? Dammit.

Although i have no idea what kind of traffic volume this gets, so i could just be talking to myself... Well, makes no difference to me. I shall pretend that this is read my millions of people round the world and hope it inspires them to leave their computer and get outside ;-) If we'd been meant to stay in and play computers all day, we'd have an RS232 data port built in. We haven't, so get outside and do something cool. I recommend surfing. Or mountain biking. Or sailing, or camping in the hills. Get out there and enjoy it!  It makes me sad how many people just don't appreciate the world outside. Maybe i should be grateful that there's more space for those of us who do.... Ah well, to each their own.

      It's mighty damn warm today. Just thought I'd share that with people. If anyone out there reading this is cold, i'd email you some warmth, but i don't think present technology will allow me. Sorry about that. I have the feeling my weekend escaped me... Was on a first aid and firefighting course both days, so i didn't have much time left for kicking back and doing fun stuff. Don't get me wrong, the course was very good, but relaxation has been thin on the ground. Still managed to get out for a few beverages on Saturday, and then watched Hannibal. Or at least, Anne watched Hannibal. I watched ten minutes then went to sleep. Apparently, though, i have comforting snoring. It's been called a lot of things, but never comforting. In fact, it was once described as sounding like 'two diesel powered warthogs mating in a huge bowl of trifle' by some poor dude who had to share a caravan with me... Now that is something i'd like to hear, although i reckon i'd pass up on the opportunity of seeing it. Trifle. That'd be nice. My Mum makes great trifle, although not living at home i don't get to eat it all that often. Never mind, am probably going to go and see the folks in august.  I'd like to know something. I'd like to know just what it is that i'd like to know. I think after statements like that i should be condemned to a life of not knowing a whole awful lot. But, so long as i'm having fun, that's all i need, really. Wisdom is an optional extra. Maybe i'll have a contemplation session tonight, or maybe i'll just get drunk. Or maybe, i'll combine the two. I reckon thinking is a bit like training for the lifeboat - it's all very well being able to do things when it's calm, but you need to be able to do it when it's rough. Therefore, you need to practice when it's rough. Ditto thinking. If you want to be wise when drunk, you have to... what is this pish i'm spouting? Now all i need is for someone to throw in 'wisest is he who knows he knows nothing'. That'll put a cat amongst the pigeons... It's all very well saying 'hey, i know nothing, how wise am i, huh?' but how do you know you know nothing? I imagine knowledge about things like where i've put my car keys (don't know, last seen in kitchen cupboard) and who the prime minister of new zealand (Helen Clarke) is not included in the knowing nothing. But does knowing that statement mean you know too much to be wise? Or once you know you know nothing, are you allowed to start re-building your knowledge? I just wish i knew what i..... oh, bollocks, this is confusing me. Just have fun. That's my theory of everything. That and use some fucking common sense. That's what the world needs. Fewer laws and more common sense. i think. But, i could be wrong.... &lt end transmission &gt

      Whilst not exactly a world-shattering change, this week I dj'd on Thursday evening instead of Wednesday. You know what? The change was virtually unnoticeable. Instead of being bushed on Thursday morning, I am now bushed on Friday morning. Which isn't too bad a thing, as it means it's now nearly weekend! Wahey! It was an entertaining evening. I think the best bit was when I went to the bar to get a tasty drink. Or at least, one of the times I went to the bar...  As I was at the bar, quaffing away, Becky (one of the bar dudes) turned round and looked at me as if I'd dropped out of a flying saucer "You're over here." she said to me incredulously "Yup. This is me. Here. By the bar. Me. Here. Yup" I think the stilted speech was due to the shock of someone obviously feeling the need to tell me where I was. "No, I mean, you're not over there,"  Concern started to grow. Had Becky gone mad? Was she dangerous? Should I run? I decided that maybe I should humour her a little... "No. I was over there, but now I'm here. Needed a drink." I demonstrated my possesion of a pint to back up my story. I felt proof would be a handy thing to have if Becky was going to start cross-examining my every move for whatever reason. "I thought she was talking to you?" "Who was talking to me?" Things were getting weird. I eyed up an escape route. "That mad woman,"  Maybe in most establishments, that would be a useful thing to tell me. However, Rummers is not most places. There are not just three mad people there, there are three classes of mad people there. The resident mad people, the itinerant mad people and the one time only mad people. The resident mad people are there most nights, and range from being gently eccentric and often likeable to outright fucking crazy. The itinerant mad people are generally just fairly odd and show up on a fortnightly basis. I think they like to circulate round town, spreading their oddness. I'm not sure if they have a set route, or just make it up on a daily basis. I believe that they work out where to go and be odd from observing the stars and flocks of birds. These people are in the main harmless, so long as you don't make eye contact. Now, the one time only mad people only ever show up once (hence the name) and 90% are stark staring bonkers. It could well be that Rummers is on an escape route from a secret home for the crazy. But anyway, you can see my dilemma. At any one time, there are at the very least five mad people in the pub. There can be up to fifteen on a busy night. Last night there were about seven, as it was fairly quiet. I asked Becky which mad woman was it that she meant. "That one, there." Becky pointed to the DJ box I'd vacated to get my drink. Inside was a woman, chatting animatedly to a CD player. Shit. I wandered back, trying to give off an air of calm. I thought a friendly approach would be less likely to end in disaster than an outright ousting of the mad woman from what is undisputedly my domain in the pub. "Hey, hello, you alright there?" Good start, I thought. Friendly and verging on helpful. "Ha ha, yes, as I was saying to Sonny here, we need something to dance to," OK, so on the one hand, it seemed like just a request for some dance-to-able music. However, on the other hand, it seemed she was under the impression that there was someone called Sonny in the box. "Sonny?"  "Yes, yes, Sonny" she pointed to a CD deck. Ah, Sony. That's ok, I thought, she just wants some music and to befriend some audio equipment.  "What kind of music would you like on?" I asked. Ace, the situation was coming under control... "Ooooh, maybe some mweer-me-menerr" Poor woman, to lose power of speech mid-sentence. "Some who?" "Some menerr-wemenerr-uhh-meerrr" Shit. She's gone mad. She's going to vomit over the amplifier. I hit upon a plan. A cunning plan. "Sorry, I don't think I've got any mweer[cough]mehurr with me. I've got a playlist with me, have a flick through that and see if there's anything you fancy." This was a lie. I had  two  playlists with me. One was one the bar, at the other side of the room. The other was on top of Sonny. The CD player. Right in front of her. Still in the DJ box. I didn't want her to have that one. I wanted her to have the one on the bar, merely because it was on the bar and not in my little enclave. I needed to hide the playlist before she noticed it. At her present rate of cognition, I estimated I had around a minute for things to sink into to her addled mind. How to hide an obvious bright pink ring binder surreptitiously. I mulled over the situation. "Where's your list?" the madwoman asked me "Over there, on the bar," don't notice the other one, don't notice the other one, don't notice the other one... She looked around, spotting the one on the bar and sadly the one right in front of her. Dammit. "Is this it?" This was when I had my moment of inspiration (thank you Muse, whoever you are) I would beat her at her own game. "No, that's my bedurrr-bedunga," "Your what?" Suddenly she seemed less crazy. No matter, I would brazen this one out. "My bedurr-bedunga," She looked at me, as if to say "You what? Are you mad?" Instead, she said "OK, I'll go and have a look at the list." And left. My little area of pub was once more mine, and safe from the ravages of crazy people. Ten minutes later, she returned and asked for a track, which I played despite the pitying looks I kept getting off her and her equally crazy friends. I couldn't help but think they were talking about the poor fool-boy DJ who kept going on about a bedurr-bedunga...

      I've decided that as part of my work (computer simulation of hemispherical electron analysers) that i should write about the repairing of surfboards. Obviously, it's not directly related, but it's going to act as mental chewing gum, and get me salivating (mentally) before i write a geometry file for a Herzog plate... less said about that, the better methinks. Anyway, onto the issue at hand...  You will need: 1. A surfboard, dinged 2. Resin, either polyester or epoxy... epoxy is better but more expensive 3. Catalyst 4. Glass cloth or tape... 5. Numerous other bits that you'd never suspect you'd need. Just go round the house with a bucket and collect whatever catches your eye. Pins, cutlery, a mug, CDs, stuffed toys, bog roll, cushions, tomatoes and a bunch of keys are all good things to collect at this point.  This is what to do: 1. Find a suitable location in the sun, out the rain, preferably well-ventilated 2. Put the board on the ground. Squat next to it to appear professional 3. Rummage through your bucket of stuff. Hopefully, there will be a sharp knife in there 4. Use the knife to pick off any loose bits of resin around the ding 5. Have another rummage in bucket. Find sandpaper 6. Sand around the ding - this is to provide a rough surface the resin can stick to... 7. Chase away next doors cat who has come to watch 8. Find a pot. Or a mug. If you can't find a pot, find some pot and give up for the day 9. Have a guess at how much resin you're going to need for the repair. Double it, then double it again. Any surplus will be distributed about yourself, most of your possesions and the cat that's just come back 10. Put a few drops of catalyst in the resin. Again, this is a guess, and must once more be quadrupled 11. Find something like a spatula. Butter knives are good, tv remote controls are not. 12. Splat some of the resin on the ding, and work it in quite well. Make sure to leave at least one air bubble in it. This is so anyone who inspects your work has something to point out. If you omit the bubble, people will get annoyed at you for being too good. If you have no friends, by all means get rid of the bubble. 13. Scratch around the yard for some grit and other cack. Sprinkle onto the resin. This is for similar reasons to the air bubble. 14. Lay the glass cloth over the ding. Prod it with your spatula type thing to ensure it gets (mainly - unsoaked bits are similar to the bubble and cack) soaked with resin. Slop more resin on top of it, and work that in, too. 15. This is a good time to notice that it's started raining, and also that next doors cat  is stuck to the pot of resin. 16. Carry board indoors, making sure you pick it up by the wet resin, and liberally spread it around the furniture. 17. Attempt to separate cat from pot of resin, get bitten for your efforts. Bite the cat back if you're feeling energetic. 18. Wait for board to dry.  19. In the meantime, leave resiny fingerprints around the house. This is a good time to read a book, make some sandwiches or just sit and stroke your beard. If you don't have a beard, consider growing one. They are indispensible for containing half-set resin. 20. Is the repair set? It will not be. Leave for a bit longer 21. Find the sandpaper again and sand the repair smooth. And the big dribble of resin next to it. 22. Clear up. This will involve leaving the resiny mug outside for a week, and hiding the remote control and swearing you haven't seen it for a few days. 23. Admire your handiwork, drink some beer.

      After some research, i've modified yesterdays recipe... You will need:  Left over glop from previous day Pasta No vodka chilli powder  This is what to do...  1. Cook pasta 2. Reheat glop in microwave 3. Sprinkle chilli powder into glop 4. Eat 5. Feel smug 6. Talk pish with buddies all evening, concentrating on the joys of lego....  Ah, the joys of  urlLink lego ...  I remember building towers as high as i could. The best way to do it is to start with  urlLink duplo  to build a wide base. Once you've run out of duplo, move onto standard lego bricks to build a tapered tower. Once you've used your entire supply of bricks, get out the technics and build a pylon stylee structure.  But  before you do that, build a horizontal cross piece... this is where you'll attach the rigging to for the bit that comes after the pylon stylee bit - a single, vertical stick... you'll probably have to put rigging to various points on the stick section as it gets taller. I remember building towers that were not just taller than me (not all that tall at age 7 :) ) but taller than the rooms in the house - had to move into the garden! Is it cheating though, using the rigging? String isn't really lego. It's quite an issue at seven, when your sense of morality is just developing. I puzzled long and hard over it and am still not certain now...   I am feeling:  like some kind of seven year old engineer  I am listening to:  Bob Marley  The surf here is:  0.5m @ 4s :(

But... it's a .wma file with schneider protection, digital non-stealing protocols, anti-theft thingummies and fun limitation codecs... meaning it'll play on Windows-pile-of-shite-media-player, but nothing else... And no - it won't go onto my mp3 player (well, it will, but it won't play) as promised by this soft drink companies music site...

      Meaty tomatoey gloppy stuff... You will need: A tin of tomatoes (chopped) A tin of tomato soup (not chopped, but you can try if you want) A tin of sweetcorn (not a big tin. a little tin.) A bunch of random vegetables (frozen, or in a tin. couldn't care less. Hell, if you're trying to impress someone, you can even use fresh) 500g of mince Oxo cubes (red, two of) Pasta of some sort....  This is what to do: 1. Start feeling hungry 2. Decide to do something about it 3. Rummage through kitchen, find the above stuff 4. Keep rummaging for garlic, find a shrivveled clove, throw in bin in disgust 5. Defrost mince in microwave 6. Pop mince in a wok and cook it.  7. Wop in oxo cubes 8. Chuck in everything else except the pasta 9. Realise you don't actually have pasta 10. Ferret through everyone else's cupboards until you find pasta 11. Boil some water for the pasta 12. Forget about the pasta, admire Kate Humble on TV for a bit 13. Remember pasta, and in fact the gloppy stuff which is now stuck to bottom of wok 14. Wait for pasta to cook, hoping the gloppy stuff won't burn much more 15. Pile onto plate 16. After two mouthfuls decide it's minging, but soldier on anyway... 17. After half an hour of picking at it, put remainder in fridge and try to persuade yourself that it's going to be appealing tomorrow 18. Feel disenchanted with your cooking skills 19. Fancy some toast 20. Discover lack of bread 21. Mobilise to Spar for bread, stopping at Rummers 22. Have pint, chat to Ngila, Al and Alice for a bit 23. Go to spar, get bread 24. Also spot ham, milk, and hmm, maybe a bit of vodka 25. Retreat to house, having now gone off the toast idea 26. Realise vodka was not a sensible thing to buy and commence disposal 27. An hour later, go skateboarding along seafront 28. Retreat to house, watch DVD (September sessions) 29. Finish vodka, attempt to roll joint 30. Complete joint after half an hour's fumbling 31. Smoke joint, read some harry potter 32. Go to bed. Fall out. 33. Wake up on floor next morning 34. Make porridge 35. Eat porridge, go to school, stopping on way to buy birthday card for grandmother 36. Sit in office, feel vaguely stupid  Some recipe, huh? Reckon it could do with improvement...

      Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit.  If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love, for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.  Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.  With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

      Monday. Again. Dammit, the weeks are so long and the weekends are so short! I vote for a swap - a two day week and a five day weekend... that'd maybe give time to recover from friday night - the Lifeboat AGM lasted half an hour, and the drinking went on till one - ace! Then on Saturday night, it was the Sandancer in Barmouth - he he he! If you ever want a safe place to keep a ten pound note, stick it to the floor there - no-one will be able to remove it due to the amazing adhesion the floor has... Not even you. OK, that's a pretty dumb idea, but you get the idea. The DJ hadn't got any better - halfway through the one and only, the classic, the anthem insomnia, he changed it for some piece of wanky pop shite. What was he thinking? Gah! There ought to be laws against mistreatment of generation defining tunes. And laws against saccharine musical mogadon. Ah well, was a good evening all the same. Last night saw me skating along the seafront, at midnight, with Nigla (hopefully i've spelt that right) and her housemate, (Laura) which was fun - midnight is the time for skating - no cars, no old ladies with ratty dogs and no fat red brummies expressing their disbelief at a skateboard that's longer than, well, a normal skateboard - as longboards go mine's fairly short (but lovely and responsive :) )'hoi jim, look at the funnai skaaaiitbuuurd'  Brummie accents are remarkably hard to spell... It has to be the most unfortunate accent in the world - if Einstein had been a brummie, no-one would have listened to a word he said - "spacetime curved? don't be daft" Although he probably would have spent his spare time by coming to welsh seaside towns every bank holiday, stealing all the parking spaces, riding a jet ski (wankers wankers wankers), feeding fucking seagulls (double double double wankers) and being offensively fat and red.  I'm going to stop right now before this becomes a brummie rant, and i know not all brummies are red, fat, jetski-riding, seagull-feeding, parking space-stealing theoretical physicists... Probably only as few as 80% fit that category, so i don't wish to offend the other 20% who are normal people.... Peace out chaps...  I am feeling:  Hot. Temperaturewise, not randy. Although....

      Have just caught myself saying "G'day" to people. Am i turning into an Australian? Will i be blond and called Troy in a week's time? What's more worrying is that the other day, flicking through the FHM's 100 sexiest women of all time (yup, sexist, but i'm not complaining) out of my four favourites, three had been in Australian soaps (Holly Valance, Kylie Minogue; both in Neighbours, Isla Fisher; Home and Away. The fourth was Cameron Diaz) But, i like the idea of New Zealand a bit more - all ecosystems, terrains and ace sports on one (well, two) island...

      Apparently, that's what's passed over. Storm 35. Sounds like a band...  Am moving house next week, to superlush new flat... Huuuge windows, by the water in the marina, can check the surf, the boathouse is spitting distance away and the lifeboat station's just across the water. Spot on. Moving date is the 30th. Today is the 23rd. Not long to go... Apart from that, not much else is going on. I get up, check the surf and am invariably disappointed, go for a run, have breakfast and a shower, go to uni, go home, check surf, become disappointed again, hang out with buddies, go to bed... Apart from uni and the lack of surf, it's not bad actually...  Last night I was stood just outside the front door, having a smoke and watching the *pissing* rain, and a car went past with a surfboard on the roof. Oho, i thought, does this mean surf? I grabbed a coat, and scampered to the end of the road, neglecting shoes. When i got to the end of the road to see the sea, I realised three things: 1. No surf 2. I hadn't left the door on the latch 3. No doorkey Shite. Lucky me, there was an open window. On the first floor. Not the ground floor. Also luckily, there are a couple of boards from a climbing wall in the back yard. Everyone should have them. I managed to scramble, bare-foot, up the climbing wall and into the bathroom window. That was the third time the walls had been used. The first was when we got them, from an unspecified source, the second was at houseparty #2 and the third was me climbing through the bathroom window. I make that about two hours of use, in total. They have been there for 9 months. Or 6480 hours, give or take a few for 31 day months and 29 day months and so on... That means that the climbing walls have been useful, or at least used for 0.03% of the time. That makes them as useful as a wheelbarrow with no wheel. We have one of those, too. We used it for about two hours as a drinks cooler. It leaked. Ah well, maybe I'll use it to break into the house next time i lock myself out.

      What ho, the network's being shechty today... So I'm going to bide my time and post this next time I manage to connect... And today, I'm going to be talking about.... MAGIC! Magic is something that makes us feel warm and fuzzy and deleriously happy. Magic is not turning people into frogs. Magic is something that happens every day. Magic is not recognised by most people. Magic is still magic even when you know how it works. Magic is not rare. Magic is us living on a tiny ball of rock hurtling round a ball of glowing gas.  It's a shame not everyone can maintain the feeling of childish wonder at even the mundane... A speck of grit was once part of a star... as was everything you see... even you. Yes, you...

All that remains to do is go back to SVP and:   Take rubbish somewhere   Take random wetsuits and barbeque to boathouse   Take bike and anything else I've left to new flat   And that's that. Can't wait till it's done!  I am feeling:  Starving. Really damn hungry. I'm still in lab at about six and haven't had any lunch yet today. Really damn hungry.

      George got a new toy yesterday. A lovely longboard.of the skate variety. Naturally enough, I wanted to play on this lovely new longboard, and after leaving Fishers house (where we'd been, catching up on Fishers French exploits) we found a nice place to try the board. Edgehill Road. Let me describe Edgehill Road. Steep as the north face of the Eiger, with a crossroads at the bottom. After i found a suitable starting point, (about here... maybe a little further down....at the next car... here...bugger, it's a long way down...) George went on ahead with Bong to provide a traffic report at the crossroads. "All clear, do it!" I hopped on the board and went skeeting down the hill, trying a couple of carves to get the feel of the board. As I shot over the crossroads, I thought I'd try a good, big, fairly aggressive carve to try and scrub off some speed.... Eyes: Hey, don't know if you guys have noticed, but we're stonking along here... Brain: Hey man, I don't know.... there's beer inside y'know... Ears(Balance Department): Dude, Eyes are right, we're going yay fast! Yeeeah! Brain(Self Preservation Department): Shall we do something to reduce velocity? Bollocks: Nah, this is cool! Pussy. Brain(Self Preservation Department): No, it ain't. Mummy! Brain(Diplomacy Department): Got a plan - do a huge-arse cave. That'll slow us down *and* look cool at the same time... Brain(Self Preservation Department): I'm in... Bollocks: Hell, why not, so long as it looks cool. Brain(Motor Control): Initiating carve... Knees: Bending... Ankles: Moving... Ears(Balance Department): Maintaining equilibrium... Brain: So far so good... Do we look cool? Everyone: Hell ye...... Brain: What's happening? Talk to me... Ears(Balance Control): Fuck me, we're going sideways... Eyes: Don't like this, shutting down... Brain: Do something, do something, do someth... Hands: Ow! Elbows: Ouch! Oooh, bugger! Back: Yowch! Knees: Mummmm! Ears(Balance Department): Which way's up? Don't know, don't know.... Brain: .......................have we stopped yet? Ears(Balance Department): Think so....nope, still rolling... Union of all bodily extremities: Stoppit stoppit stoppit!  Later inspection revealed that the huge-arse carve had coincided with what is possibly the smoothest, slickest manhole cover in the western world. I'm not sure if it was the front or back (or maybe even both) wheels that had gone over it. If you're not familiar with skating, this event can be described as trying to drive a car on oily ice. With ball bearings on top. The only difference being, your car will spin round and round. On a skateboard, you'll spin round, then fall off. That's what i did. Luckily, the beers i'd had probably made me relaxed as i hit the road, so i just rolled and escaped anything worse than peeled palms and elbows... No harm done, except maybe to the pride, I thought... George and Bong came running up... "Dude, that was sweet! That's going in my top ten of longboard stacks ever!" [If you don't know, a stack is a crash...If you ride something, or drive something, you can stack it] I'd had the honour of the first stack on Georges new board...   Bollocks: Yeah, we rock!

      Right then, have got most of my crap in boxes ready to be put into car... Mostly. At about ten I decided to go for a pint. Just the one, you understand. Anyway, who should be working there but a certain young lady. We chatted a bit, and then after closing went to the Bay... and then to a dude's houseparty (he looked quite a lot like Jesus, btw) and left at about four... it was getting light...And up at school for nine. Nine minutes past eleven, that is. Ah well, all good fun. Plus, said young lady (dammit, think I'm becomming quite keen!!) offered to help me move house and get drunk tonight! Ace!!

      The end of my occupation of Sea View Place is nearly here, for tomorrow, I move to the Marina!! Yay! Can't decide what'll be best... maybe the panoramic view of the harbour and marina... or the fact that i can get into the water in about six steps... Or the boathouse being within spitting distance? In any case, i've developed a three stage moving plan, outlined next...  Stage 1. The preparation. Scheduled for Tuesday 29/6/04 This step consists primarily of chucking all my wordly possesions into boxes. Unless it's crap, in which case it'll be disposed of without remorse. Things like the 30m coil of BNC network cable I've had for four years because 'it'll come in handy some day' It hasn't.  Stage 2. The move. Scheduled for Wednesday 30/6/04 Put boxes (see above) into car. Drive to new flat (yay) Keep returning until there's nothing left. First estimates show this may take up to seven trips. With a Landrover pickup. Maybe I just have far too much crap? Stage 3. The cover-up. Scheduled for Thursday 1/7/04 Return to Sea View Place. Remove all signs of occupation. Some would call this cleaning. However, cleaning sounds dull and makes me disinclined to perform said act. Therefore, I shall refer to it as the cover-up stage. Remove contaminants from kitchen, bathroom, hall stairs landing, and anywhere else. If contaminants cannot be removed, they shall be painted over. Also, reattach attic hatch. Fumigate sofas. By the end of this stage, the house will resemble a house that was occupied by people who deserve to get their deposits back... hopefully...  Also, at some point, I'm going to have to unpack. Dammit. It's times like this that I'm tempted to sell everything i own and live a life of ascerbic simplicity....  When faced with questions like this, i always solve them by thinking what the Lone Ranger would do in said situation. I don't always do the same, but i feel his perspective is often handy. Him and Steve Irwin. And Han Solo. And Rab Nesbit. It's a good team to have, because in any situation, i always have the options of: a. Hide out in the hills b. Poke it with a stick c. Shoot it d. Get drunk I find these cover most situations i encounter...  I am feeling:  Like a drunken inter-galactic crocodile wrestler. In the old west.

Was first there, on the boat and halfway down slipway before the coastguard phoned and told us not to bother. Dammit! Still haven't been out on a real mission yet. Unless you count the sheep.

      Last night, the lifeboat assessors were here. I was to do a high speed navigation exercise. It went not too badly (except for the stopwatch reseting itself at one point) except for one thing. I was asked to set a speed for us to go at, and told 'not too slow' as we had a lot of things to cover. Looking at the sea, it seemed fairly flat, with a moderate northerly breeze. The Atlantic 75 can do 32kts on the flat. I settled on 25kts. We left the harbour.... the first minute or so was ok, then we left the shelter of castle point. As navigator, I'd elected to sit on the side just ahead of the helmsman, so I could talk to him easily. Now, in rough weather, the back end of the boat is relatively sedate. The bow is not so sedate. I spent the next half hour or so, hanging on grimly, being bounced around, trying to hold a stopwatch, a passage plan, and also whatever handles or other proturbances I could reach to stop myself getting catapulted out the boat. It wasn't comfy, but I damn well wasn't going to say anything. I carefully chose an expression to say "Yup, I knew it was going to be like this when I said 25 knots. I'm happy sat here. It's all good." I eventually managed to brace myself between the sponson and anchor reel, and only sustained minor bruising. It was mighty good fun! But next time, I shall remember Father Teds words of wisdom: "Now Dougal. These cows are small, but those  are far away ..."  I reckon the same applies to waves...  I am feeling:  ready for the weekend  I am listening to:  I'm not at the moment  The surf here is:  stop asking me!

      Do you use it? Probably, it's pretty handy to have. After a bit of de-microsoftation. Like getting  urlLink rid of those fecking adverts . And the addition of a handy  urlLink plugin . But those adverts. Dammit! They're everywhere! Just yesterday, a window just appeared of its own volition on my computer. Imagine a human helicopter. That was me as I took of vertically, powered by pure apoplectic rage. The sheer fucking cheek of it! It's the equivalent of being sat at home, minding your own business when some bugger pops his head through the window just on the off chance you wanted some herbal viagra. Do the people who do these adverts think we're all too stupid to be able to find something we want by looking? (Pause in writing to savour the rage) Even if I did want their product, I'd decline just out of principle. And herbal viagra? Puh-leese! One, I'm fully functioning, two, at the moment, well, let me be crude here: I'm not seeing a whole lot of action. Oh yes, and three, let's just imagine I did need a little 'pick me up' (as 'twere) would I get it from some fly-by-night website (probably .ru) that would then go on to sell my email address and card details before infecting my computer with something to show me more adverts? And, oh yes, let's not forget, had the sodding temerity to just pop its advert up without so much as a by-your-leave. No, I would not. Neither do I want to see a video of a woman being, shall we say, intimate, with a great dane. Well, not again, at any rate. In any case, my computer is now sat behind a firewall that's the digital equivalent of the Great Wall of China, and any unwanted programs lead very short lives before being terminated with, not prejudice, but righteous indignation and even vengeful wrath. Incidently, how to protect your computer from 80% of viruses - don't use MS Outlook. To protect yourself from the rest, use Linux. (woah, slipping into geek mode here) Back to the adverts. No, dammit, away from the adverts, they're just winding me up, even by being just a memory. The fact that someone thought I'd just take the shite they're foisting upon my computer laying down. Well, no. I'm going with the theory that the best defence is attack. I want a firewall that will not just block crap, but actively track down its source and, well, RAAARGHHH!!!  I've completely forgotten what I was going to say in the first place. Ah well, it probably wasn't all that exciting.  I am feeling:  Satisfied, having vented my spleen.

      I am currently in my office in the physics building on campus. If you don't know Aberystwyth, the campus is up a hill. Not a giant hill, a medium sized hill. But it's still big enough to make you think twice about going down and back up for a less than essential purpose. Let me explain the purpose I have in mind. As outlined before, I am in my office. I am also hungry, having not eaten since breakfast. This morning, before leaving my flat (which is at the bottom of the hill, and across town) I made some ham, pickle and tomato sandwiches. Said sandwiches are still on my kitchen table. Is it worth my descending the hill to get at them or shall I just wait it out until five, or shall I go and buy something hideously inflated and clad in plastic from the union shop? Today is not going well. Also, have just found out that we're not likely to see an awful lot of our deposit back from previous house. After spending three whole damn days cleaning it. I would have happily eaten from the kitchen floor and both toilet seats when I left. I used an entire bottle of Febreeze on the sofas (Febreeze = spray on white-trash dry cleaning). I filled eleven bin bags with assorted rubbish. And did I leave them by the back gate? No, I did not. I put them into my car and took them to a huge bin. My car still stinks of it. I reattached the hatch door to the attic. Which incidently was only held on with one screw when we moved in. I spent an hour vacuuming the whole fucking house. I dusted. What fucking more is required of me? Dammit. I should have just torched the fucking place and had done with it.  And I'm DJing tonight, so can spend the whole evening playing shite for pissed-up wankers (OK, and some cool stuff for cool people) and wondering if I'm having my mind fucked with by, well, you can see where this is going.  Dammit.  I am feeling:  Given up on optimism. I shall purge all feelings and live as a Vulcan  I am listening to:  Linkin Park  The surf here is:  shite.  I'd love to go surfing right now. To a nice A-frame point break, glassy clean and about 4-5 foot. I'd surf for a few hours, then sit on the beach with a joint and not think about anything all evening.

      I'm no geneticist or psychologist or any other medically-inclined professional, but I doubt even they can understand, much less explain, the differences caused by having an X, rather than a Y chromosome in combination with another X. What bizzare information is encoded in that extra arm? Sure, the physical aspects are obvious - no facial hair, generally smaller and, of course, an all-round more pleasing shape. But the mental (and by mental, I of course mean  mental ) effects of this genetic difference seem to manifest themselves in all manner of peculiar fashions. Examples would illustrate this point nicely, and I have one to hand.... "Playing hard to get"  Girls do it, boys don't. There's a reason for this. Boys, being more analytical, decide that if they like someone, they don't want to put it off until later. Girls do. Why? Is it so they can verify that they are actually seriously persued rather than an evenings entertainment? I doubt it. I think it's something more sinister. They want to see us suffer. They want to see your face slide about an inch downwards when they say that they're busy that evening. They won't say what they're busy doing, just so you can lay awake at night wondering who they're having a better time with. You know they're probably not; they'll be watching some girly pish on TV, but you're never sure. And the worst thing about this is.... they don't all play these mind games all the time. Just so you can spend hours torturing yourself by going through the list of options:   Does she just want me to fuck off?   Is she actually busy writing a dissertation?   Does she want me to keep persuing her?   Does she just want to hang out occasionally, but nothing more?   Is she just playing mind games with me?   Maybe she does want something to happen, but not at this time for whatever reason?    As the night wears on, you can come up with more and more options to prolong the exquisite agony of not knowing what's going on. I'm sure any blokes reading this will know exactly what it's like, so I'll stop there. If any girls read it, take pity on us, we're... well, not stupid*, just more simple. *You might argue the point, but we can set the video, parallel park and understand the difference between engine oil and gearbox oil.

      Once again, it's Monday. The weekend has come and it's gone. What do I have to show for it? One flat instead of two, a lump on my head the size of a wine gum and an ache which i assume is coming from my kidneys. Lower back, that kind of region... I assume it's something to do with Saturday night's expedition... Andy was crashing at my place, and as we went back, it got light, the tide was waaay out (springs at the moment) so we took a shortcut across the harbour -there's a row of rocks across the river at the top of the marina, visible at low tide - so we went over them. It took forever. It would have been quicker to go round and over the bridge  on our hands and knees . Drunk people and slimy stepping stones are not a combination that lends itself to expediency. Plus Andy fell in. I used my sure-footed goat powers and only got wet up to my neck. We had some more beer and went out to the end of the south harbour wall for sunrise, only there were clouds in the way. Never mind, it's still a magical time of day. So magical in fact, I went to bed. At ten i got up to go to lifeboat training, but decided that i would be a liability on the boat in my state, so i went the hell back to bed.  I am feeling:  like it's Monday  I am listening to:  Norah Jones  The surf here is:  Finally!! went out yesterday, 1-2ft chop

      Whilst at the supermarket last night (Safeways - needed sausages and diesel) I occured to me just how many damn slow people there are. Slow fat people, who just meander along, with not a care in the world, gleefully blocking each and every aisle as I try to trot round the shop. All I wanted was a packet of sausages, and some milk. That's it. I also needed to be relatively hasty because my laptop was in my car, and my car don't lock. I was in such a rush that I ignored my standard checkout choice protocol (find the prettiest girl, queue there.) and queued at 'Mark's  (I'm never sure if they have real names on their badges - when I worked in a hotel bar, I was known as Bruce, I shit you not.) checkout, declining the delights of 'Antoinette' in the next checkout - her conveyor belt was loaded, almost to the rafters with what seemed to be mainly pies, cakes and lard. Oh, and a low-fat yogurt. Sure, that'll help it's owner's pounds just fly off, especially after that pork fat flavoured ice cream... Anyway, I digress. Whilst 'Mark' dealt with previous customer and her cheque (No, I don't want it printing, I'd rather spend a week writing it very slowly, and pissing off anyone who had the sheer cheek to think they could just rush in and out so their car hasn't got time to be broken into...) I spotted, on offer, a pack of that stop-smoking-gum. What the hell, I thought, now's as good a time as any.... After leaving the main store, I stopped at the filling station, as my poor (thankfully, non-broken into) car was thirsty, and incurred the wrath of about six people queueing to get fuel on the left hand side of the pumps. How did I do this? By opting out of the 'wait on this side and ignore the other side club' and reversing to the (unoccupied) pump on the other side, so I could fill up there. For my efforts, I recieved a handful of dirty looks, and some guy I think wanted to give me a handjob. I declined, as he wasn't my type, being a 'he' to start with. Was I delaying any of them? I reckon they just took offence at being made to look stupid. Moral of the story - if you don't want to look stupid, don't be stupid... Back to the gum. It's one of the most horrible things I've ever encountered. Imagine chewing soap laced with creosote. It makes me want to have a smoke afterwards to get rid of the foul taste. Dammit!  I am feeling:  Give me a cigarette!  I am listening to:  Leftfield  The surf here is:  on holiday

      Was just checking to see if there was anything worth watching on TV tonight. On S4C, at 2320, is 'Animal Passions'  Five years ago, director Christopher Spencer made a film for Channel 4 about people who have sexual relationships with animals. Featuring extraordinary case studies, Animal Passions revealed that these people are forced to the very margins of a society that can neither understand nor condone their actions. After the film was shown a number of zoophiles, as they like to be known, wanted to tell their stories and open the lid on a strange and often shocking sexual subculture where these passions are not limited to lone individuals, but include women, couples and even animal relationships within families. So Christopher returned to tell their stories and talk to experts about the deep forces and early frustrations that push these people to break such a strong cultural taboo. Mark lives with his 'wife' Pixel, a pony. He has paid a high price for his chosen relationship, shunned by society, friends and family. Michael and Laurie's marriage foundered when he continued to have sex with horses, although Laurie had lost her virginity to a dog and enjoyed a relationship with their golden retriever, Baby Golden. Ken and Ellie's first date culminated with her having sex with her horse. And Sarah gave up her comfortable middle-class married life to live with her dog.   Oh, my fucking spleen, what the hell is going on? Michael's marriage foundered when he continued to have sex with horses? Is he surprised at this? And Ken and Ellie; first dates should not involve having sex with a horse. No. That's just plain wrong. And how do you marry a pony? Did Mark carry Pixel over the threshold? I rather doubt it.... How did the ceremony go? "Do you?" "Neigh..." See, an in-built safety feature to prevent anyone from marrying horses. That's why they can't say "I do."  I am feeling:  I want to scrub my mind...

      Spotted a new crazy person in Rummers last night. I shall call her Crazy-yogurt-pot-eye-starey-woman. She stood perfectly still for about three hours, silently (and malevolently) observing everyone's activities. Her eyes looked like dark, empty yogurt pots recessed into her skull. Now that's a new one on me. I've seen all kinds of crazy starey people, but never one with crazy-dark-recessed-yogurt-pot eyes. I'm sure she was keeping watch for some nefarious purpose of her own. At risk of sounding like a crazy-new-age-space-hippy, it seems crazy people generally have some kind of aura around them. It's probably a psychological thing, based on their general demeanour and in some cases, smell. Crazy-yogurt-pot-eye-starey-woman seemed to radiate a kind of low-grade evil. Not the kind to make you start pleading for your life, but the kind to make you feel nervous and get a headache after about an hour. In the end, nothing untoward happened, and she left, presumably back to her coven on a bleak hillside, to chant and screech weird spells to bring about the fall of civilisation and the rise of the crows. Maybe. Also saw YKW there last night. Reckon that whole thing's going nowhere any time soon. Never mind. Plenty more surfers in the sea. Oh, did I mention going drinking with the  urlLink Roxy Girls  next week? Oh yes. Poor old me, I think not!  Finally, for now, you'll remember my  urlLink problems with my chair  in the office. Well, after that, I retrieved my old chair - a swivelly, tilty, up-and-downy kind of thing. I'd brought it over from my old office, but after a while swapped it for the directors chair. After languishing, unloved, in the corner for a while, the swivelly, tilty, up-and-downy kind of thing was appropriated by the morose Spaniard. Said morose Spaniard has been away for a couple of weeks, and after my directors chair died, I retrieved the swivelly, tilty, up-and-downy kind of thing from his side of the office. Morose Spaniard has returned. He's not mentioned anything, but I keep catching evil looks off him as he wanders round the office, making a point of not sitting down. Perhaps he's in league with Crazy-yogurt-pot-eye-starey-woman. In fact, my milk had gone off this morning. I suspect supernatural intervention from the Crazy-yogurt-pot-eye-starey-woman's and Morose Spaniard's coven-of-perpetual-misery-and-crow-fanciers-club. Suddenly, a whole lot of things are making sense...  Off to buy some garlic, a crucifix, some silver bullets, a Walther P99 for the silver bullets, a ducking stool, and a stake. Maybe a steak, too.

      Had a major breakthrough in drunken philosophy last night. Life is like a kebab. You see, you get the salad, which isn't the most fun bit but it's good for you, the pigeon meat, which is yummy but not terribly good for you. The pitta bread is just plain dull but essential for containment. And there's the chillis which offer a roller coaster ride of flavours and mouth burnings. So how does this become a useful tool for the understanding of life rather than a fairly half-arsed metaphor, Forest Gump stylie? (Incidently, that really bugs me when people quote the box of chocolates line and stand there, expecting applause for such a critical, yet useful, appraisal of the human condition. Let's put some credit where it's due, though: it is true, but doesn't tell you how to handle, for example, a toffee penny when you were expecting a fudge finger. And whilst on the subject, quoting the quote in a poor attempt at Forest's accent doesn't make it any better. Everyone's heard it far too many times for it to be funny. OK, that bracket thing's happened again.) Well, the kebab comparison, when considered, can tell us a lot. For instance: Garlic and chilli sauces. They're not essential, but improve the experience vastly. This tells us that non-vital fripparies, for want of a better word, improve life. So, go surfing, drink beer, jump into rivers. If you want rid of the pitta bread, you have to use, most likely, one of those polystyrene trays. By getting rid of the boring bit, you're relying on something else for support, and creating waste to dispose of somehow. Therefore, put up with the shit, because if you don't, there'll be bother. Meaning, don't be sodding feeble. Do things for yourself. But, there are times when you need help. This is the plastic fork. You work together with the fork. I'm still a bit unsure about this bit, but it made perfect sense last night. And that, rather handily, brings me onto the final point, for today, of the kebab analogy - you only have kebabs when drunk.... make of that what you will.  Went to the pier last night. Good company, but the music was pants. I wouldn't call myself a connaisseur of music - quite a fair proportion of what I like isn't well recieved, but at least it's got  character . So much 'music' now just has no character, or anything at all to recommend it. It's just non-entity musical magnolia paint. Once again, style triumphs over substance. Is it a growing trend, or am i just becoming more aware of it?  ...moving on...  No word from my good buddy Sesay... will go back to my tribe on Borth Bog.  It's graduation week this week. This means: 1. Lots of people in Aberystwyth - all the graduates with parents positively bristling with pride and relief that little Jimmy is about to start paying his own way. Bless 'em! 2. Because of the influx of parents, the parking permit scheme on campus is suspended for the week. This means I can park anywhere. So I have. Yesterday, I parked in the big car park below the Union, and today I've parked in the car park between Physics and Comp.Sci. Anarchy! BTW: new flat has two parking spaces allotted in the car park. At the last count, we were using seven. Which isn't bad, seeing as there's only officially two of us living there at the moment...  Went to Safeways yesterday to get bread and cornflakes. Not very exciting.  I am feeling:    I am listening to:    The surf here is:

So here's my reply:   Dear MR.SESAY MASSAQUOE  I am become very troubled to the vexatious depths of the beast of BORTH BOG to read of your spectroscopic strife.

      Today's a big day.... At some point a shiney new vacuum chamber is being delivered to test  urlLink detector arrays  in. Leaving aside any scientific concerns, this event has had, so far, two tangiable effects upon my day. The first is the prospect of hoiking round heavy things. This doesn't cause me too many worries as I like to tell myself that I'm reasonably fit. I have, however, elected to exchange my standard footwear (sandals - in a kind of outdoor activity sort of way, rather than the sandal/sock combo. It's moments like spelling this out that makes you realise just how damn vain i am, dammit. Thought I'd got over that. But does realising something bad about yourself go some way to negating it? But does harping on about realising it negate the first negation? From here, we can go into an ever expanding sphere of negations that never quite reaches closure, if you see what I mean. I once started on this train of thought after unwittingly consuming what I thought was standard flapjack, and was stuck in a mental loop for some hours. Enough of this. Where were we? Oh yes, still in the sandal brackets. Righto, just close them and move on.) for slightly more substantial boots in case of any heavy items landing on my toes, which I'm quite keen on keeping. This has resulted in sweaty feet. Why is this worth mentioning? Well, it stems back to a day last winter, when I was driving to my parents' for Christmas. The heater in my car wasn't working and a gale was blowing round the doors (Landrovers, eh?) and I couldn't feel my feet. I found I couldn't imagine ever having sweaty feet ever again. And here I am, with sweaty feet. Just goes to show, huh? Had the same effect at the weekend: after consuming  urlLink THE BEAST  I couldn't imagine ever being hungry ever again. Lesson learnt. Just because you can't imagine something happening, ever, doesn't mean it won't. That's great, it opens the door for all kinds of possibilities in the future. The other effect on my day? I got to school at 9am today. This is a monumental event, if only to me. Eleven is my usual time. (Got into work late? Compensate by leaving early.) Now, most mornings I need a couple of hours to wake up (drink tea, watch news, check the surf on teletext, drink more tea, check the surf for real, even if I *have* to go to work, drink tea, roll cigarette, have breakfast, smoke cigarette, drink more tea etc) but today, these two hours of warming up were denied as I *had* to be there for the chamber to be delivered. Sadly, this meant that my breakfast has been reduced from my standard porridge, toast, banana, apple and tea to the more miserly biscuit and tea. One biscuit. With the result that it's now half eleven and I'm starving. Well, not starving in an African famine way, thankfully, but mighty peckish. My packed lunch is sitting on my desk looking tempting, but if I eat it now, I'll get to about three and be in the same situation. Darn it all to heck. But you know what really rankles? No vacuum chamber yet!!  What else? Oh yes, the  urlLink tracker feline .

      Well well well, what a weekend. I think some form of summary is in order...  Friday Night  Drove to Swansea with Andy, in Andy's car. That sounds like I drove, doesn't it? Well, I didn't. Andy did, it being his car we went in. Maybe I should have said "Sat in car while Andy drove to Swansea" That would be better. In any case, we got to Swansea. Just before leaving the M4, we decided that directions would be a handy thing to have: neither of us knew where the house was in Swansea, and a door-to-door search would probably take too long. I called Sally. "Sally, hey, we're nearly there, can you give us directions?" "Sure thang, y'all! Where are ya?" Sally doesn't actually come from West Virginia, but it'd make this story a wee bit funnier if she did. "We're on the M4, coming up to junction 29." "Have y'all passed Lampeter yet?" "....!" If that sounds like a reasonable question to you, dig out a map of Wales. If you can't be bothered, a brief synopsis of the journey we were making would be: Leave Aberystwyth Drive round little Welsh roads for half an hour Drive through Lampeter Drive through more Welsh roads for an hour Drive along M4 for ten minutes Do seven laps of Swansea for the sheer hell of it Get to Sally/Anne/Nets house. And let's not forget, Sally knows the way we were going, having been a student in Aber, and living in (well, near) Swansea. And whilst on the subject, Lampeter is a special kind of place. It consists of a roundabout, two chip shops and a man holding a piece of string. On the other end of the string is mid Wales' most bored cow. There's a university there, too. I've met the student. But that's by-the-by. We eventually got to Sally/Anne/Nets house and got buckled. As the evening progressed, my memory got progressively less reliable, so we'll fast-forward to half-six the next morning. Daylight had started to prod me, and I reached that not-awake-not-asleep-barely-even-alive hungover state. Eventually several things dawned on me: 1. My brain had obviously been scooped out and replaced with glue and feathers 2. Every time I moved even so much as a finger, a beer bottle fell over 3. The continuous cascade of beer bottles was hurting my glue and feathers 4. I was on the living room floor 5. My contact lenses were still adhering to my eyes and had turned into sandpaper 6. I wanted my Mum. I got up, removed the sandpaper disks from my eyes and got into my sleeping bag and went back to sleep on the living room floor. Or to be more accurate, I laid my sleeping bag over myself because I couldn't work the zip. Some hours later, after finally drifting off again (I'd knocked over all the beer bottles there were to knock over) a few of us surfaced and went for breakfast to The Uplands Diner. I used my usual breakfast plan and ordered "Just the biggest fry-up you do. With a bucket of tea". Nine times out of ten, this results in me becomming human, and content, with a full belly. This was the tenth time. Alarm bells should have rang when I was told I'd ordered "THE BEAST" The Beast? That's not a healthy name for a breakfast. Nor did alarm bells ring when regulars came up to me to give me tips for eating THE BEAST. Leave the chips till last. THE BEAST came out. Far from being a fry-up suitable for someone with a healthily large appetite, THE BEAST was fit for an army, to use a well worn cliche. In fact, wars have probably been fought over lesser things. To my horror, THE BEAST consisted of: Bread and butter Toast AND fried bread Beans 6 rashers bacon 4 sausages 3 eggs Chips (lots) Tomatos Hash browns Mushrooms (yuk yuk yuk) Spaghetti And probably lots of other things I've forgotten. In short, it was a farmyard massacre on a plate. I didn't manage to finish it, but left feeling very well fed. It's just dawned on me that I've forgotten the heading for  Saturday  so there it was. After a suitable recovery time, we mobilised for a surf. Langland was flat as ironed roadkill. Caswell was showing some form of life, so we extrapolated our findings and went to Gennith. There was a foot or so of chop, which was more than adequate for our feeble selves. After a few hours there, we went back to Net/Sally/Anne's house for more partying (why?).  Travelling in convoy has its advantages. It also leads to great moments of comedy. For instance.... from my vantage point in Andy's car, I could see Sally driving the car in front of us. I could also see a police car behind us. Now, I'm sure that at police school, on day two, they probably say something like "Cars with surfboards on the roof are invariably full of scamps. They may well be likeable scamps, but scamps they are nevertheless." This means that any journey of length with surfboards on the roof will, at one point or another, entail being followed by a patrol car as its occupants decide which sub-category of scamp you belong in.  We reached a roundabout by the student village in Swansea. Sally, being one to enjoy a giggle, made a complete circuit of the roundabout, with us behind. And another. Waiting, at the front of the queue to get onto the roundabout was our friend in the police car. Sally didn't spot this and went for another lap before finally carrying on. I'm not sure about what scene was being played out in Sallys car, but in ours was one of impending comedy, whilst trying to look as if we were victims too. As the road widened into two lanes, Andy (man, he can be shrewd at times) slowed down enough for the police car (once again, directly behind) to overtake us and sit behind Sallys car.... you can see what's coming...3...2...1...flashing blue lights. Sally pulled over. We didn't, as we had to start drinking. Plus we were in imminent danger of losing bladder control. Sal managed to wriggle her way out of bother: "I was just showing a friend in the other car where the Student Village is." (quick thinking, huh?). Finally, we got back. After assembling the flat-pack barbecue (minus a handle due to missing bolt) the drinking (etc) began... Have you ever tried red wine and coke? If not, try it once, then leave it the fuck alone! Also, do not combine with beer, pro-plus and so on. It'll lead to retardation. There were more people there that night, and more of pretty much everything. There was chicken to be barbecued, but not before being defrosted. Unfortunatly, it was that particular variety of chicken that when placed in the microwave to defrost, becomes re-animated and runs around, spreading juices up the sides of the microwave. Ah well. Evening turned into night, which turned into early morning, over the course of which I learnt several things: Apparently, I bore several similarities to a guy called 'Mong-head'. Fair enough. No, actually, that's the only thing I learnt. YKW was there, but we only swapped about two sentences. I'm not sure what to make of the whole situation. In fact, here's a conversation I had re:the situation earlier:   jenny says:You make any progress with certain young lady? singlefin.blogspot.com says:bugger all. don't think she's interested   jenny says:Bummer dude.  But it was her who asked you out for the drink... singlefin.blogspot.com says:troo.... must have put her off somehow jenny says:Perhaps she is playing hard to get? Or doeesn't think that you are interested.... singlefin.blogspot.com says:well, dammit! how the hell do I know what's going on?  How indeed? Anyway, long story short, more drinking, pass out which leads us to:  Sunday  This was pretty much the same as Saturday, but with smaller breakfast and bigger surf. Still not big surf, but just right for hungover piss arounds. I invented a new move - the Windmill cutback - it involves doing half a cutback, waving your arms like the name suggests, then falling in. Then we went home. Back to Aber, and guess who we gave a lift to... yup.   I think I need some answers, and I don't think anyone's going to give them to me. Maybe some kind of fact finding mission...?  I am feeling:  Still hungover  I am listening to:  The Kinks  The surf here is:  onshore mush  but I don't care today because I had two good sessions at the weekend! Yay!

      The weekend is approaching, as it inevitably does... Hopefully something exciting will happen. I've been bored most of this week. Ah well, that's life. Got a letter today from the landlords, bitching about a friends vans and another friends car being parked outside the flat. Has anyone else been unable to park? No, there's still plenty of space. Are the vans blocking anyone's windows? Yes, mine, but I couldn't give a rats arse - I'm never in my room. (well, apart from sleeping). What this world needs is fewer rules and more common sense.

      If you've got half an hour to spare in the middle of the night ever, go and stand by the side of a quiet motorway. For extra points, do this when there's a gale blowing with a healthy dollop of drizzle. After a while, a car will come along, quietly at first.... bbbbbbbbbrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEE-  OOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww and recede into the night again. That's my weekend. I can hear it coming from about wednesday, it gets closer, then all of a sudden, whoosh, it's gone in a doppler-shifted streak and it's Monday again.   Well, as this weekend passed, I caught a glimpse of some surf on Friday, a lazy Saturday followed by DJing in Rummers, and a bit of a sail on Sunday.  The surf was about 1-2 foot lumpy and confused, but better than a poke in the eye with a shitty stick. So that was ok.   Lazy Saturday was between Friday and Sunday and not too active. This too was ok, if a little unsatisfying. DJing was, umm, well, I can't make my mind up about it. You know when something happens and you can't decide whether it was a good thing or a bad thing? That. Rather predictably, it involved a young lady. (Although I think she was a little older than me...) we chatted for a while about music. Introduced her to Jack Johnson, she liked him. Finally, though, it was last orders, and she had to go, and I had to pack up. Which sucked. And no, she doesn't live here. Well, bugger. Never mind, c'est la vie. She was very nice, though. Actually, she was lovely.  Got woken up on Sunday morning by a lifeboat call - a charter fishing boat had managed to catch it's own propellor, by Patches bouy. I didn't get to the station on time, because I had to spend about five minutes looking for my car keys. It's most vexing - I live probably 20 metres from the station. Across the harbour. As it is, I have to go all the way round, at least until I find some kind of stand-by craft. We had a photo shoot for the local newspaper, Cambrian Times, which wasn't an unpleasant experience. I'll try and find some pictures. {Edit:  urlLink here they are !}  After lifeboat, I went for a sail to Borth and back. On the way, I saw a pair of gannets, which I'd not seen round here before. And about eight jetskis. I was itching for them to come near enough for me to be able to justify hurling some abuse, but they didn't. They just went round and round and round and round..... nnnnnnnggggggg-nnnnnnnnnnnggggggg Officially the most annoying noise on Earth. I sailed into the beach, adjusted my outhaul, chatted to a bloke on the beach for a while and sailed back. And that was pretty much my weekend.    And now it's Monday morning. The Morose Spaniard has stolen my swivvelly-tilty seat again, so I'm once again on the directors chair, very precariously. The aura of smugness he's giving off is palpable. A plan, methinks....

      Monday, again... Never mind, I've had as good a weekend as possible without any surf. Let's see....  Mountain Biking -  urlLink Nant-yr-Arian  with Nigel. First time I've been for ages - was really slow and riding like some kind of wuss, but was good fun all the same. Managed to not fall off, which is novel, to say the least... Then we went for curry - all you can eat. Oh yes! Got my money's worth there, I think. Yum. Anyway, Saturday night. The highlight of the weekend.... DJing. The band had cancelled, so Huw called me in to play some tunes and off I went, expecting a normal, quiet, Saturday night. Hell no, it was rammed. What's more, it was rammed with relatively normal people. Oh, apart from a lady I shall call AC-DC-Bouffant-woman. She looked relativley normal, apart from hair that was bothering the rafters, and asked for AC-DC. Now, I don't have any AC-DC in my collection and told her so, politely. Man alive... before my very eyes, she turned into a cross between Lord Voldemort and an enraged Klingon. The glare she gave off conveyed such evil I wanted factor 50 sunscreen on my face. "No, I suppose you wouldn't would you..." What the hell was that meant to mean? If anyone can shed any light on this remarkably cryptic comment, please let me know. She scared me. And I don't scare easily. She'd make Darth Vader want his mummy once she reached what-do-you-mean-no-AC-DC-mode... However, this tale of woe has it's Yang. Assuming AC-DC-Bouffant woman was the evening's Yin, of course... Several times, I'd been badgered by a young lady for tunes. I say badgered, but Hell, I wasn't complaining. Not one bit. Anyway, a while later, one of her friends came up, with a look of mischief.... "This is a bit cheeky, but can I have your number for my friend?" I assumed this was a wind-up - I'd been caught gawping at the lovely lady, and they thought they'd wind me up. But, I'm not one to spoil a joke, so I wrote my number and gave it to her. And that was the end of it. Or so I thought until a text message landed on my phone yesterday evening. Going for drinks Tuesday night...   /  =  stoked beyond all recognition    =  The Kinks    0.8m@5s

      I refuse to believe that I'm the only one that gets irritated by these  urlLink stupid formulae  for anything and everything. Nine times out of ten, they mean nothing. Let's break this one down...   SCARY MOVIE FORMULA (es+u+cs+t) squared +s+ (tl+f)/2 + (a+dr+fs)/n + sin x - 1. Where: es = escalating music u = the unknown cs = chase scenes t = sense of being trapped s = shock tl = true life f = fantasy a = character is alone dr = in the dark fs = film setting n = number of people sin = blood and guts 1 = stereotypes   Right then, first off, as any well-behaved scientist will ask, what are the units? Is fantasy measured in Tolkeins? Is the unknown measured in milliwhats? By dimensional analysis, we can see that escalating music, the unknown, chase scenes and sense of being trapped have the same dimensions as the square root of shock. Clearly, dimensional analysis is going to get us nowhere with this. OK, look at the end of the formula, we see 'sin x' surely that means the sine of x? Oh, no - look at the table of variables, we see that sin = blood and guts. Right, so 'sin' is a variable now rather than an operator. OK, that we can cope with. But x does not appear in the table. Hmm. Could it be that x is the measure of blood and guts (presumably in Kilobuckets) and it should actually be the sine of x? Maybe, but it's a dumb mistake to make. And what's this? Looking really closely, you see that at the end is - 1. Now, it can be hard to tell the difference between 'one' and lower-case 'L' at times, so copy and paste into whatever word processor you use and change the font. Yup, it's a one. And looking at the table of variables, we see: One = stereotypes. Fools. Now let's look at the term (tl+f) True life plus fantasy. Now, let's assume that these refer to the proportion of the film that is true to life, and the proportion that is fantasy. (Of course, this is a guess at what the variables mean, but if you don't define them, researchers, then that's your lookout). If the whole film was true - a documentary - tl would be 100% and f 0%. Now, if the film was entirely made up, tl = 0% and f = 100%. If the film was equal parts fact and fiction, both would be 50%. In other words, tl+f  always  equals 100%. What a pointless bit of formula. Next, we have (a+dr+fs) or, (character is alone + in the dark + film setting). Now, either the character is alone, or he/she is not. From this, I take it that a is a boolean variable, being either 0 or 1. Very well. Similarly, it's either dark or it's not. (well, ok, there are shades of grey, but that's not going to help explain this formula any better). Now, if these are boolean values, they need a boolean operation. But wait, there's another variable co-habiting with them in those brackets... fs. 'Film setting' Now, strictly, this should be a boolean value too if it wants to shack up with 'character is alone' and 'in the dark'. And, as we know, boolean variables can be 0 or 1. Or, if you prefer, false or true. So either the film has a setting or it does not. Explainations for a possible non-film-setting? Oh yes, the 'researchers' who came up with this are actually trained monkeys. I'm surprised they didn't throw in an integration symbol for good measure. And finally, where has the equals sign gone? What does this formula come out with? Scariness? Number of cushions you need to hide behind? Intensity of nightmares afterwards? [Note: the SI units for these values are, respectively: Milliskidmarks, just a number, and Centi-wake-up-screamings]  And these people call themselves scientists? They should be run out of town, immediately.   /  =  Better  now I've got that off my chest   =  The Corrs    =  0.4m@5s

      Hey, how's that for a title? Rotcypesw. Rot cy pesw. Sounds Welsh, but it ain't. "Return of the   urlLink Crazy-yogurt-pot-eye-starey-woman ". Yup, she put in an appearance last night at the pub. To be more accurate, though less concise, she put in three appearances, although the first two (at 2118 and 2134) seemed to just be to come into the pub and do a quick head count before ducking out again. The purpose of these elude and terrify me. Is she performing some kind of census of potential hex-ees? Luckily, she didn't seem to hex anyone in too overt a manner this time, but I'm sure she's only waiting for an opportunity to let rip on some unfortunate sod. Hope it's not going to be me. Luckily, I don't think she's in league with  urlLink AC-DC-Bouffant woman  who I think is trying to kill me. Also, for good measure last night was the Spanish girl who said she was going to punish me for not having any flamenco music. Now, is that punish in the kinky spanking kind of way or in the somewhat less enjoyable cricket bat in a dark alley kind of way? I don't know. After work, I helped C move house, at two in the morning. Strange time to move house, you might think, and you'd be spot on with that. It's not the most extreme house move I've ever been involved in, though. Sometime last year, I had the delights of helping a buddy move house at five in the morning. Does stuff like this happen to everyone?  Finally, for now, you'll remember the  urlLink Chip and PIN debacle  at the union shop... well, yesterday, I went for a spot of lunch, having left my lunch at home  again . Well, the promised new chip and PIN system was nowhere to be seen, and as I scribbled my signature, I inquired after it... "Well, we didn't like it, so we swapped back." Never mind customer security and card fraud protection, if the staff don't like customers typing in numbers rather than signing bits of paper, well, stuff it. There seems to be a certain type of person who takes great pride in being clueless about technology. As if it marks them out above the common herd because they can't set the video. It's usually the same ones who believe computers to be a passing fad. The rise of the ignorati. It's my firm belief that people shouldn't be allowed machines/gadgets/stuff like that if they don't understand, even at a basic level, how they work. OK, this means a large proportion of the population won't be allowed anything more complex than a stick, but if they take pride in being stupid, that's their lookout. ...when I rule the world... Actually, if I did rule the world, I'd set up a committee of wise people to do the running, and go off surfing. Maybe irresponsible, but I'm sure a few wise people would do a better job of it than me. I'd ban politics, though. Well, not politics, but  Politics . Politics you need, to run countries, but it should be transparent, in the sense that what needs doing just gets done without people trying to score popularity points or power points. It definitely should not be combined or linked in any way with philosophy, or religion. It should just be a thing that gets done to make sure all the public services work. That's all it is. Everyone seems to think it's the be-all and end-all of everything, but it's just a tool to make sure doctors get paid and bad people get arrested. It's just got too big for it's boots. So has money. Money isn't the ultimate end, nor is it evil. It's just a tool. Without some kind of standardised exchange system, we'd all have to be subsistence farmers. It's a means to and end, that's all. Ditto politics. OK, I've rambled on for far too long now. Off to do some work - today: setting up SIMION 3D with Wine and SUSE 9.1 I'll need the anorak for this one, methinks...   /  =  Just fine    =  nada    =  on it's way...  we love you Hurricane Alex (now a cat. 3, I believe)

      Managed to survive the whole horse experience... I chowed down on plenty of anti-histamines before hand and only sneezed twice and I think that was due to the tail end of the cold I've got going on. I was riding a horse called Smokey (although I kept calling him Stoner) who was both chilled out and anti-social - he kicked out at other horses a couple of times, and that's fun if it's only your second time on a horse, ever! I didn't manage to find any bearskins and stuff, so the local Orcs were safe, this time. Next time, however, I shall go on a Tolkeinesque orc slaying mission and bring peace to the foothills of Cadair Idris. See, it even sounds right. My only other exciting news is that I finally managed to beat Andy at chess the other night. It took forever.   If things carry on like this, I'm going to have to start making things up to put here...   /  =  bored    =  Evanesence    =  0.9m@4s

Tropical Depression 1 (he he he, sounds like sadness somewhere warm) has turned into Hurricane Alex out in the Atlantic and looks like he (or she, could be either...) is going to push some swell up for the weekend.

      I have actually reached melting temperature. All that's needed now is for me to absorb just enough more energy then I shall turn into a little greasy puddle on the floor. Ah.. I must have exaggerated a million times today already. It's hot and sweaty. My shirt is sticking to my back and I've just been sat down most of the day. I hope there's a thunderstorm later, it feels close enough. If there is, I'll get raging drunk and go and join in. Actually had quite a good weekend, managing to combine surfing (one foot and very weak), lots of drinking, all you can eat curry, paddling boards from the harbour to the Glen. Umm... cake... think there was some Haribo at some point... Which was all good because I'd managed to get myself into a foul mood last week. I can't have been pleasant to be near, so if any of my buddies read this, *sorry*.  Tonight, I reckon laziness will occur, and today will be the day that I finally beat Andy at chess. I came sooo close yesterday, but after deciding to move a rook somewhere which would give him the choice of losing either his queen or his queen and a knight (I think) I then moved my rook to somewhere completely different. Truely, I can be a retard.  Horse riding tomorrow. I'm torn between indifference at the horsey set, or cladding myself in furs and chain mail and galloping around mid Wales brandishing a sword...    /  =  ignoring certain questions    =  Elvis!    =  flat

      That's my new word. Ponderation. I am in a state of ponderation. I imagine it to be similar to Utah, but not as hot, although I'm not sure, having never been to Utah. Wide roads. Anyway...  I've hit upon a plan to answer the list of questions I have at the moment. I shall take a sheet of paper and cover it with bizarre heiroglyphics. Then, all that remains to do is translate the heiroglyphics into English, reducing my list of ponderances (another new word, on a roll today...) to a mere linguistic problem.
