      Hey again people, I am havinga day off today as my neighbours ( the flat next to us) were having a domestic and me and mum had to look after the lady as she was shaken up but will not go into anymore detail on that bit.&nbsp; I didnt get to sleep till like 4am and am quite shattered so am posting on here then back to bed.&nbsp; I am going to work on some of my school work at some stage but also have to pack my bags as i am going back to dads tonight.  It is raining here and am rather glad I cna stay home inside and in bed while it rains it is just so neat. :-) You think I'm wierd?  I think I sorted things out with Ed last night, I am unsure but I know kinda what I need to work on limiting, I got answers to most of my questions after talking with andre then talking to Ed. I have a question for everyone out there that reads this blog,    why do we as humans always ASSUME we know everything about everything and everyone?????          &nbsp;  Crap I broke the writing!lol. well I think that is about it, my neck and throat are extremely sore today and i dont know why.    &nbsp;  Well I will write again soonish.   cya    Peace        &nbsp;

      Hey People, relating to the title of this post mum and me are goin to ishaya's essention. ( I dont wanna go) I dont even know wat it is.  On a happier note I showed my poem about bill to some of the teachers at school and they liked it. Older people appreciate my work more.:-)&nbsp;&nbsp; The counselor( to whom I am good mates with) wants to publish and laminate it. I have had many of my poems published in a book in America.  I spoke to Ed ( an awesome friend of mine), he wasn't ina very talkitive mood as he has been soooooooooooooooo busy with some computer stuff. It is wierd i havent spoken to him on the phone all week except just then. :-o that is kinda scary, but good because I am not obsessed with him.lol.&nbsp; I still want to hit verity because she is still making fun of Ed and I GRRRRR, I hate it wen people make fun of my friends especially ones that I know have beent hrough a lot. well I guess that is it, I will leave you and go adn eat as I am starving.:-s  Peace Out  &nbsp;

       Death is a hard thing to deal with.&nbsp; This poem is how I felt when I heard of my friends death.&nbsp; I miss him more than the world and wish I could of at leaast said goodbye and this is my way of expressing my feelings.     This guy was close,     He made me laugh and cry more than most,     Just the other day,     The death angel took him away,     I look over my shoulder,     A shiver makes me colder,     Knowing he is there,     that guy still is close,     I will cry in grief of him almost as much of his brother,     His mother and father recieved a call.       &nbsp;   A call which I also soon recieved,     My mind could not comprehend,     A silence&nbsp;soon exsisted&nbsp;between the people on each line,     A staggering broken heart,     This heart tears,     Through the shredder it goes,     Another tissue,     Another tear,     I know he is near,     This friend to whom I was close.    &nbsp;

        Hey again,     I know it is great that people are being sympathetic about Bill's death because it has affected me quite a bit.&nbsp; Mrs Stoner ( ex-tutor teacher) came up to me after school and said ashley wats wrong you look down and I told her why and she offered her shoulder to cry on basically and that is great because she is just lovely.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   On a happier note today at lunch 2 me and karl were playing on this skateboard we found and kept fallin off it was awesome! lol I guess you are all thinking F**k your dumb! Yea I knew you were. I got a txt from ed so yay i guess.     i also played badminton tonight it is gay but meh i dont really care.     I wont my single 15-13 or sumthin and me and JennyJ lost our doubles but who cares lots? You do? Oh well you will live I am sure.     I guess that is about it. must fly as dinner is nearly ready.     PEACE and out

        Well today has been quite different.&nbsp; I told whaea Monga about Bill and also told Mr Sartin.&nbsp; It was soooooo annoying today as Verity,Antz and Jamie mainly Antz and Verity have been bugging me about Ed and me and Jamie were talking about Ed and Mark. That girl is definitly in love with Mark.&nbsp; It was quite funny/awkward today because I saw the teacher that is the grandad of Ed and we spoke it was quite strange but it is sweet he is a wierd but cool teacher. I also had english today and our speech draft was due so that sucked but oh well she says she will call home tomorrow if it isnt finished but none of the class care. Well I dunno wat else to say.&nbsp; Oh yea I have training tonight am unsure i think it may be the last one so that means I will be going to the gym more often because it takes away my main training source.&nbsp; I am listening to Usher's song Burn and writing this hope it gives ya sumthin to read. I also have a referee meeting tonight, so shal be a lil boring.     Im out.     Peace

      I wrote this poem for you dad:  Today another year is added to your life, Day after day, Night after night, Your Birthday draws close, Today it is here, In the present, Receiving presents is what you’ll do, This is a small gift, But is my gift to you.  Hip hooray another Birthday day, Over the hill you slowly climb, A shot of tequila and a squirt of lime, From cows to trucks, You live your life, Not giving a care to a duck, Enjoying, Loving, Another Birthday and another year, Added to your file up there, Up there in the sky above, A place that is full of Birthday love.  Hope you had a great birthday. Love you. Happy belated B'Day

      Well today I discovered what blogs are, and that they are quite awesome.  Heres a poem for the first blog of mine.         Yea we used to be tight,  Sharing all sorts,  Now we turned the friendship down a notch, Put downs were present, Our friendship again descended, Slowly spiraling down the drain, This problem is becoming a major strain. I know this poem doesn’t make sense to the old brain.  Where to go what to do, This relationship takes another twist to soon, June 2005 will come to soon, Leaving, Returning, You never know this friendship misleads you.  peace Out
