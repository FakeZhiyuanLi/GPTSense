      As of now I cant even check my blog out   so I'll just post some meaningless toast up in this piece.  I'm pretty bored atm.  A little background: I manage a self storage warehouse.  I also live in the apt. suite upstairs.  I spend a .....LOT of time here.  SOOO when 7pm rolls around and its quittin time in these parts I'm on the phone sniffin up a drinkin partner.  I'm 25 and went through my party phase kinda early so I've been on a drink/party/debauchery/livin-in-sin hiatus for a few years now.  So I think I'm overdue some indecency. Plus hitting 25 didnt do a whole lot for my already dismal outlook on getting older.  I 'spose I should count my blessings since I could pass for Shaggy off scooby doo circa 10th grade ( thats when he was still kinda cute in a goofy way ) ..  ( believe me ).. so I gots youthful graces but still feeling the 3-0 creepin up quick-like and a in a hurry.  But I digress.  The reason for all this is as aforementioned, I'm fucking bored.  I tried reading which was nice for a spell.  Gonna learn a few new tricks: Open source operating system, the bass guitar, polish up web design and drawing skills, and learn that crazy yoga trick Will Ferrel does on that SNL sketch with Tobey Maguire.  That should keep me busy but in the downtime maybe I'll be posting here.  We shall see.  Anywho....anyone else out there burning as much time as me feel free to peruse.  I'm privvy to just about all sorts so you might say ... I'm Jesus???

      I decided to try and choke out any and all grievances I have with Staci so I can start writing something thats interesting or fun or not stupid.&nbsp; This will be kinda free-based so it might get you more fucked up than usual.&nbsp; Hickies.&nbsp; Once again I shall reiterate (as hard as it is to believe with how much its mentioned) I really dont care that she's fucking around, but what struck me today when she came by to pick up some stuff was hickies.&nbsp; Now this would be a trivial thing for anyone else on earth but me.&nbsp; Why? During the 2+ years we dated I was never allowed to put a single hicky on her not even in unseen places.&nbsp; She would get furious if even hinted at giving her one to the point of ending sex or pushing me off and storming out if we were casually making out.&nbsp; Now I dont think I can recall more than a couple times in the last few months she hasnt had one or more shiners on her neck.&nbsp; Could mean many things.&nbsp; She's tryin to make me jealous (hopefully she's not sinking that low), she's sexually liberated all of a sudden (even thoug without any delusions I know we had great sex), or maybe she's taken a shot to the ole pride and she'll give/receive anything from guys who mean only to get whatever they can out of her and bail.&nbsp; There are other possibilities but these seem the most likely for her specifically and the 1st and last scare me especially the latter which is honestly the most likely.&nbsp; She took a similar blow after we broke up when a "white bread oatmeal" kinda guy rejected her and she slept with a scuz unprotected I might add.&nbsp; Not her finest moment, but that leads me to believe its more of the same thing.&nbsp; Now to finish my rant.&nbsp; I really wish she'd leave me alone.&nbsp; She keeps buggin me tryin to "salvage our friendship" which I dont really care for anymore.&nbsp; The only thing I can come up with is its a superficial need.&nbsp; She doesnt really like me ( she treats me like shit ) but she would like to keep up appearances to the tune of "see me and my ex are the best friends aren't we/I good people?? I'm very proud of myself".&nbsp; Which also disgusts me to think that it could be true.&nbsp; She would obviously never admit to that not on her dying day, but I believe its a strong possibility.&nbsp; Or maybe not that extent but to a lesser one she wants to hold on to "us" since I was her first real love (she was barely 19 when we started dating) and things were blissful very quickly and for a long time.&nbsp; I think and hope thats the reason she's clinging to us so desperately, but I'm afraid my rejection is driving her to do things to herself I wish she didn't.&nbsp; This in turn makes me want to step in and do something, but I can't and I won't.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish her friends would.&nbsp; She doesnt strike me as happy, but someone desperately grasping at straws trying to find it.&nbsp; I for one am not a happy soul, but with age has come a little more patience.&nbsp; I'm content to wait for it.&nbsp; dammit.&nbsp; Time escapes me.&nbsp; I have to leave to drive 9 hours so I'll not be finishing this.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Oh yeah last rant.&nbsp; Females should be the ones with the testicles and testosterone.&nbsp; They can get laid 100 times easier than a guy with just a wave of their ass but we're the ones burdened with the throbbing sexual drive.&nbsp; Dont bother arguing i realize many women have ravenous sexual appetites but its not quite the same.&nbsp; Anyways give them the testicles thats all im saying.

      But everybody already knew that.&nbsp; Last night went out for a little Go Bar Dance action.&nbsp; It was fun while it lasted, then Staci showed up.&nbsp; Not to say she made it suck, but things always get weird.&nbsp; I really feel like a huge asshole b/c she makes an effort to be nice and&nbsp;I know it really hurts her when I'm reluctant to talk or hug her goodbye, but its the only way I know to distance myself.&nbsp; Otherwise, I fall right back into the worn ass groove that is so hard to get out of.&nbsp; I start thinkin "yeah we can hang out, we can be cool...then wow things are fun why did we break up?...then maybe we could get back together??....then OOOOH thats why we can't, why am I such a dumb ass for doing this shit all over again???" Meanwhile she is having fun with whatever guys she wants to which I have no problem with, and it is my fault that I get lulled into that; however, in order for me to remedy it I have to cut her out completely and not give her an inch which is not what she wants.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; She doesn't know how bad it hurts me to do it to her but if i dont im gonna go postal and cut down some small shrubberies, fish in someone's pond w/o asking or me and huck are gonna put fleas in that snooty Ashley Merriwether's knickers.&nbsp; I really need a distraction.&nbsp; Putting my hands in mittens full of bumblebees would work.&nbsp; I may have a short summer romance with a local crackwhore just to see where our love would take us and what walls of oppression we would break down together.&nbsp; Any takers?

      The more i spend of my life learning about computers the more i come to realize i would skin the flesh off the mother and boil the children of the man who invented them.  Computers that is.  I suppose the same could be said for my syntax, but to that i can only say to you the annoyed for which i write these ramblings give your anger to the blowing winds and shit where you stand.  Also I dont believe in paragraphs.  I think they were made to blister my mind.  I gotta stop being such a i-dont-give-a-fucker.  I'm getting pretty hot under the collar and need a willing outlet. Preferrably one that's softer than me, lumpier than me, prettier than me, dumber than me, more desperate than me and more adventurous than me.  While these are not reflective of what i typically look for in a girlfriend when it comes to good old fashioned sweaty pat robertson sex those attributes help.  I'm just too lazy/shy.  More of the lazy than the shy.  I'm like a sex camel.  I can store up a lot of sexual activity in the palm of my hand to sustain me through the drought months.  Because of that i usually say, "eh..she's with her dog.  I dont want to come between them.  That'd be wrong of me and she'd tell all her friends i was rude enough to try and take the place of said dog and then all her friends would tell their friends i beat her and then i'd never have sex again." And then i find myself home with my Linus blankie only i dont wanna cuddle with it just clean up a lil bit, and i dont mean cum i mean the little stray animals i catch with my traps downtown then bring back home to twist and mangle their wee bodies into beautiful marionettes.  I need a hobby.  I swear to god i'm on the verge of something but i just dont know what.  I can feel it though.  There's a cliff face coming up thats a sheer drop for 300 feet, but there may be a slide at the top of it.  I just dont know, but i can feel it comin up.  It'll be fun or it may claim my mastercard and buy a hot tub filled with baby oil and then not let me use it.  But it is coming.  p.s. MESOHORNY  buhbuhrent

      it definitely sucked.  It was really awesome to end the whole thing with another fight.  I dropped a final email and we spoke for about 3 minutes on the phone one more time.  The last wasnt quite as bad, but it sure as fuck wasn't good.  I dunno what I was hopin for.  Maybe I was hopin she'd say "okay thats fine..whatever", that would have been easier to deal with.  Instead she thought I was jealous of her latest exploits.  She really had no clue what was goin on.  Still doesn't I'm sure.  My prediction.  ::drumrolls:: We will never be friends again.  I will never speak to her b/c I no longer care to risk the let down of her assaulting me again.  She wont contact me b/c she left the ball in my court.  She told me basically that I could come to her anytime and she wouldnt mind.  Which would be cool if I thought I was the one with the problem and needed to come to her to apologize, reconcile or whatever.  So there you have it.  There's no doubt I'll be seeing her from time to time in a town the size of Athens and a social circle as similar as ours, but the days of us are over.  I know I'll never approach her trying to reconcile things though and I'm fairly certain she will do the same.  I could be wrong but thats really the only way things will be mended.  She's gotta make the move.  It'd be nice, but then people lose friends all the time.  Thats just how it is. How melodramatic :) I swear to God I dont usually talk like this. Except my blog-gimp.  I keep him in a box and he serves me well.  Well she leaves today to go out of town and I leave sat. to head out of town.  I'll be enjoying a few nights worry free of running into her.  Should do me some good.

      Well I've decided to split my blogs.  Here is where the saucy shit will be though.  Lucky you if there is anyone reading ;)  Today will be interesting.  It might suck, it might be awesome and freeing, but either one it will be interesting.  My ex and I are goin to have a lil convo and I KNOW its probably gonna suck.  I've had issue with her for a while now and it's finally come to a head.  Basically the story goes we dated for 2 years.  Much like other relationships it was awesome for a long while...the last 6 months or so were increasingly bitter until we decided to call it quits else we lose everything.  We did the friends thing and obviously much like many other relationships we cont'd to have sex for a few months after the breakup.  That eventually ceased which was fine.  The one thing that didnt stop was the bitter arguments.  We still have good times but the bad times just outweigh them in mind as of late.  I know she won't dig this but thats the good thing about being single.  You dont have to ask permission anymore.  This is strictly for my own personal sanity.  I personally feel that she treats me like shit, but of course thats everyone's excuse.  I don't really care who's fault it is anymore all I care about is not feeling like shit anymore and not being depressed.  It's been 6 months since we broke up and I've not really felt good about her or myself in much longer than that.  Other things in my life have been working out nicely which has helped to offset the shit, but I'm tired of tryin to counterbalance shit.  I just wanna be happy.  This is gonna really sting.  For a long time.  I'll let you know how things turn out.

      My little sister is coming up this Friday to visit.  I'm throwin a little party for her.  Things have been a bit better in all aspects of life.  I'm almost inclined to believe im receiving my comeuppance (spelling?).  Karma may actually exist.  The weekend should be fun.  It will definitely be expensive so I'm hoping there will at least be some good times to make it worthwhile.  I dont think I've ever partied with my little sister so that should be interesting.  It's a costume party and we happen to have matching outfits.  Oh luck be a lady.  My computer is still possessed.  I'm not computer illiterate by any means and my friends are certified geniuses on the subject and yet my computer ailments always get the same reaction from them "I have NEVER seen that before".  I dunno what it is about every computer I own.  I think it may be a cursed name.  I've always named my comp's Grendel 1.0 2.0 etc and they are all pretty nasty machines once i've finished putting them together, but all are cursed to inexplicable problems.  My jobs goin good these days.  Things are lookin up in that respect.  I have actually run across a Plan B in case the promotion doesn't go through.  Best case scenario for either one would leave me close to, at or over the 100k/year mark so thats not too bad.  Lots more Pbr for damn sure.  On that note I've recently been awarded the frequent drinkers (aka alcoholics) discount at Engine Room.  Funny, I've been loyal and ever-faithful in my good tipping there for the past oh 5 or 6 years and only now that they have changed names ( I have to still call it by its true identity ) and only now do I receive accomodation.  I still get carded by their newer door staff though :) I have long given up on being annoyed by that.  I can't imagine there will ever come a day when I'm no longer carded.  If all else fails in the work force I plan on posing as a 18 yr. old runaway and cleaning pools for some rich baroness and becoming her beast of burden in exchange for a healthy weekly stipend.  I've always wanted an older woman anyways.  I believe I'm gonna go for now.  Sorry dear blog that I've neglected you for a while now.  You know I'll never stray too far.  To do: make a website, con a friend into teaching me guitar, finish dark tower series, squirrel money away for future endeavors, take my vitamins, dont do drugs, and stay in school.
