      A party of people at Exun want to change the exun logo. I ask why? They say because a new logo will give it fresh appeal. I tell them that the logo was changed two years back. They say so what?  Why should the logo be changed? Does microsoft or sun change it's logo every year? No, ofcourse they don't. There's a need to maintain continuity and remain similar. Customers and clients identify with a logo. A logo should represent the brand and mean the brand. It is the true essence of a brand. Signing off Dhruv

      I don't know why but I have nothing to say at all. I'm to full of my own nothingness. It's overwhelming. I feel like a bag of nothing. I'm full of nothingness. You can see that I've got nothing to say as I keep repeating the same thing over and over again. I am so so bored. Now I feel like I'm full of boredom and nothingness. What bothers me is&nbsp;that this world lacks innovation. People like and appreciate innovation yet there are very few innovative people. It's an&nbsp;interesting observation.  Also something about these IQ tests.  I gave an IQ tests, randomly filling options without even reading the questions and guess what, I got a score of 106! Without reading a single question! I'm bored so I'm signing off

      Hello humans, Yess-ter-daayyy, was not a great day, tomorrow might be better, if i get marks that are better, which depends on the exam, that i wrote like a clam, i will be filled with joy, when i get my sst marks tomorrow.  90% i shaall not get, cry i shall till i feel not wet! long before the next exam,  to make promises to myself  of doing better,  and of workin like savinay, and still not do as well as him!  C'est un pathetic self composed poem. It describes my mood as sorrowful, and nothing can be closer to the truth. I am totally disappointed with my marks. I shall have to work harder the next time around. I actually thought my exams were going well till my maths exam (the second exam!) That's when disaster struck. I messed things up and that's the reason for this poem.  Now.... My performance seems to be dismal though i did well in science. How come geeks always do so well? Because they're geeks! duh! Okay silly question. How come normal people don't do well? Because they're not geeks! duh! Okay another silly question. Conclusion: I hate geeks! Geeks stay away from this website! I'm planning to put an anti geek filter! I've been working on it for a while. After having expressed my hatred towards geeks I must ask another question. Why must we get our results? Why can't the parliament ban exams, results, geeks, teachers, principals and schools? Okay i know the answer don't mind telling me. S'all for now fellow humans.

      Adsense makes a lot of sense for webmasters like me who have websites that get very little traffic. The fact that you don't have to invest any amount at all is great. Get paid for clicks. It's great. But the only problem seems to be that they have a very tough method of selection. My website didn't get through. They didn't select it, (though the reason is unknown to me and i feel that my website is the site ever made!) I tried some other pay for click ads but none of them got me any money at all. I joined this program (name witheld) where i was to be paid 25 cents per click nd the minimum amount for a cheque was 100 dollars. It took me about 8 months to collect 12 dollars. That was three years ago and i still haven't earnt a hundred dollars. It is wierd. I do hope google is better with their pay outs, though i am in no position to comment on it. I don't see why they have such a tough method of selection. What harm could accepting my website cause to them. It isn't asking too much. Or am I too 'low' for them. It won't cause any negative publicity to them. (My website is harmless. It is JUST about some computer related topics) I'm applying again and do hope that i am selected this time.

      In a dark, cluttered and small room a knock was heard. A lean man about 6 feet of height and 30 years of age walked to the door and pulled it open. "who is it?" he said in a hoarse whisper. "It's me, Brian" came the reply. Brian walked in and seated himself on a table cluttered with books. "What's the progress like?" asked Brian. "It's just about done. I'll finish the rest in about half an hour" "So doomsday is near!" "You could say that if things go according to the POA." "Why do you sound doubtful. It's seems to be easy enough. Just email it in 'harmless' packages" "Emailing a virus isn't that easy, you know." "why not? Just make it an attachment." "There are many problems" "Like anti-virus software, scanners and stuff? I thought you found a way through them?" "As a matter of fact, I did. But I overlooked a seemingly unimportant detail. That is, the internet" "what do you mean" "I mean i've been trying for the past half hour and haven't been able to connect till now. And unless I can connect I can't get through the anti-virus software or the scanners and such."  You see what a barrier the internet has become. Dial-up is a curse on man kind. It's like knowing where heaven is but not being able to go there because it takes too long or you can't get a connection. Though in this case it might have been for the better of mankind in most cases we mere mortals just wish to get some info for our school reports or cheat codes or some info about a shoe or a comp. I think I must stop chattering on and on, so that's all for now, folks!   Note: I'm not obsessed with the internet and it's numerous problems but I do like writing about it.

      Broadband internet is a boon. I got a cable connection last week and it works like a dream(I was using dial-up before that, that explains it doesn't it?) I wanted DSL or ADSL but unfortunately DSL wasn't available in my area and ADSL turns out to expensive for my kinda usage. SO i got cable. Howcome the rates aren't slashed. The rates for ADSL are the same as they were about a year back. Cable has got down by 50%. Dial up is cheap in any case. DSL seems to be pretty affordable though. I do hope costs go down in the near future to get these excellent services in the reach of the common man(hello humans! that's us!)

      I love this! I feel like the whole world is listening to me with bated breath (don't care to tell me you don't care one bit) I recently read something about the menace of camera phones. I don't see what the problem is. Okay okay i see what the problems is but the solution (not given by me, but some brilliant mind) seems to be equally conclusive. The solution is to get a sort of beeper like sound whenever an image is snapped. This sound should be played irrespective of the speaker volume and profile settings and such. Banning these useful devices in public places won't help. We can't expect the cops to start making sure that people aren't using camera phones. It seems a total waste of public funds to me.  That's all. (lets see for how long)

      This is my first post on blogger and i don't seem to have much to say. I plan to post something as often as i can, though it may be of no interest to anyone at all. But it's my right to freedom of expression and i plan to use it. I don't care whether anyone cares to read, listen or reply. This is my birth right and i'm lovin' it! I don't know what impulse led me to call my blog hellohumans, but it seems to be a fairly unique and expressive name, so it should do for me. I've never been to innovative so this is the best i could come up with. Innovation doesn't have much to do with me. That's all for now, fellow humans

      This is the Adsense FAQ. It is immensely long and boring.  1. What is Google AdSense?  Google AdSense is a fast and easy way for website publishers of all sizes to display relevant, unobtrusive Google ads on their website's content pages and earn money. Because the ads are related to what your users are looking for on your site, you'll finally have a way to both monetize and enhance your content pages. It's also a way for web site publishers to provide Google search to their site users, and to earn money by displaying Google ads on the search results pages. Find out more about AdSense for search. The program is free, and Google pays you for valid clicks on the ads on your site or search results pages. So go ahead and try this program. If you comply with our  urlLink program policies , just complete our  urlLink online application  and select either or both of AdSense for content pages and WebSearch plus AdSense. One application gets you approved for both AdSense and WebSearch – you can decide to use any combination of these products on your pages. We'll review your application and follow up with an email within 2-3 days. If you are accepted into the program, you can log in to your new account and get the HTML code to insert into your web pages.  2. How does Google target ads to my website?  Simply put, we provide you with AdSense HTML ad code to place on the web pages on which you want to display Google ads. Then, we take care of the rest by leveraging proprietary Google search and page-ranking technologies to deliver relevant Google ads to those content pages. We go beyond simple keyword matching to understand the context and content of web pages. Based on a sophisticated algorithm that includes such factors as keyword analysis, word frequency, font size, and the overall link structure of the web, we know what a page is about, and can precisely match Google ads to each page Our technology can also determine the primary language of a page. If your content is in English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, or Spanish, AdSense will target ads in the appropriate language to your content. In addition, Google ads are  urlLink geotargeted  to your visitor's location.  3. What makes Google AdSense different from other ad networks?  This innovative new Google business solution will help you unleash the true revenue potential of your site. Here are just some of the advantages of our program: Run ads that will interest your users. Google AdSense delivers easy to read and text and image-based ads targeted to the content of your pages and WebSearch queries. Leverages Google search technology. The proprietary Google search and page-ranking technologies are the foundation for AdSense. We understand the context and content of web pages and precisely match Google ads to your pages. Filter unwanted ads. Google combines an editorial team, filtering technology, and your input to create a robust set of filters that are right for you. Getting started is fast and easy. Getting started with AdSense is easy and requires no engineering resources on your side. We give you a few lines of HTML that you add to any of your web pages. It takes just minutes, after which you'll be serving Google ads on your pages - and generating more advertising revenue.  4. How do I sign up?  To get started with either AdSense for content or WebSearch plus AdSense for Search, all you have to do is check that your site(s) complies with our  urlLink program policies . Then, when you are ready to join our program, just go to the  urlLink Google AdSense home page , and click Click here to apply. Complete and submit your application, and check for an email from us to verify your email address. Once you verify your email address, we'll review your application and follow up with you via email within 2-3 days. If we approve your application, you'll be able to log in to your AdSense account and get started. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  5. How quickly will Google ads start appearing on my site?  After being accepted to the program and successfully pasting the AdSense HTML ad code into your web pages, ads will start running on your site within minutes. If your site is not yet in our index, it may take up to few hours or more before we are able to crawl your site. Until we are able to crawl your site, we may display public service ads or your specified Alternate Ads, for which you will not accrue any AdSense earnings. Adding the WebSearch code to your pages will instantly generate a WebSearch box. As search results are displayed on Google-hosted pages, relevant ads will appear immediately, if ads are available for the particular query. Publishers have sole responsibility for the operation and maintenance of their sites. Google shall not be responsible in the event that the AdSense HTML ad code is implemented incorrectly or we are technically unable to serve ads on a site.  6. What if I have questions or comments about the program?  We aim to make participation in Google AdSense a seamless process. However, we know we aren't perfect, so if you have questions, just email us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com . We are happy to provide you with any help or information that you may need. Also, please don't hesitate to send us your comments. Your feedback is vital to us being able to provide the service that you want. For technical support, you can view our  urlLink technical implementation guidelines  or email  urlLink adsense-tech@google.com .  7. Am I a Business or Individual account?  Business account payments will be made payable to the Company Name, while Individual accounts are paid out to the Payee Name of the account holder. In addition, publishers in the United States will be required to provide a Social Security Number for their Individual accounts, or an Employer Identification Number (EIN) if they've selected a Business account. There’s no difference in the services or payment structure between Individual and Business accounts. For more information about EINs, we suggest visiting the IRS website at  urlLink http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98350,00.html . Should you ever need to select a new account type, our specialists will work with you to close your current account and to open a new account with your updated information.  Program Basics   1. How do I start running ads?  If your application is approved, you'll be able to log in to your Google AdSense account with the login information (email address and password) that you submitted with your application. Then you'll be able to copy-and-paste AdSense HTML ad code into your web pages and begin serving ads. If your site is not yet in our index, it may take a few hours or more before we are able to crawl your site and serve the most relevant Google ads. Until we are able to crawl your pages, we may display public service ads or your specified Alternate Ads, for which you will not accrue any AdSense earnings. Please note that website publishers have sole responsibility for the operation and maintenance of their sites. Google shall not be responsible in the event that our script is implemented incorrectly. However, if you do have trouble, we would like to help in any way we can. You can read our  urlLink technical implementation guidelines  or contact our technical support team at  urlLink adsense-tech@google.com .  2. How do I optimize my site for the most relevant ads?  Our ability to target ads to your site depends on the content and structure of your site. Here are some basic guidelines for optimizing your site: Place ads on pages that predominately contain text -- only text is used to determine a page's context. If you have a robots.txt file, you'll need to remove it or add the following two lines to your robots.txt to allow our content bot to crawl your site: User-agent: Mediapartners-Google* Disallow: If your page contains frames, select the ‘Framed page’ checkbox when generating the ad layout code for that page. Place ads on pages that don't require a login. Place ads on content pages that don't change frequently. By following these tips, we can better serve the most relevant Google ads on all of your content pages. If we are unable to crawl or understand the content on your site, we may serve public service ads or your specified Alternate Ads, for which you will not accrue any AdSense earnings.  3. Can I filter which ads are displayed on my site?  Yes. To create and manage a filter list of websites whose ads you'd like to restrict from showing on your site or WebSearch results pages, simply log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense/  and click on the Settings tab. You can create separate filter lists for your content pages and for your WebSearch results pages. Ads for the websites that you add to your URL filter list typically will not run on your pages, but remember that filtering sites may decrease the number of ads that can appear on your pages as well as decrease your potential earnings. We also combine an editorial team and filtering technology to maximize the quality of the Google ads on Google and publisher sites: Review: Across the Google network, ads are reviewed using a combination of human and automated processes before they are shown on publishers' sites. The review process takes into account a variety of factors, including the quality of the ad and whether the ad is suitable for all audiences. Sensitive content filters: At times, certain ads may not be appropriate to run on all pages. For example, Google automatically filters out ads that would be inappropriate on a news page about a catastrophic event. Please note that Google does not commit that all ads for the websites that you add to your URL filter list or ads containing objectionable content will be prevented from display on your site.  4. Can I show ads on more than one site?  The HTML code we provide you with is valid for any page in any site on which you want to display Google ads. However, you may only place the AdSense ad code or WebSearch code on sites that comply with our program policies and that you own or are legally authorized to act on behalf of for the purposes of Google AdSense. We also monitor all sites in AdSense to ensure that all pages displaying Google ads comply with our  urlLink program policies .  5. Do you guarantee to have relevant ads for my site?  Since the ability for us to serve ads on your site depends on a number of factors, such as our ability to crawl your site, the content of each of your web pages, and the availability of related Google ads, Google does not guarantee that we'll always have relevant ads to display. If we don't have relevant ads for a given page, or if we haven't yet crawled your site, we may display public service ads or your specified Alternate Ads, for which you will not accrue any AdSense earnings. Similarly, if Google does not have ads for a search query, or if the query will return non-family-safe advertisements, we will not show ads.  6. How does participation in this program affect my site's position in the Google search results?  Participating in Google AdSense does not affect your site's rank in Google search results. Google AdSense will not affect the search results we deliver. Google believes strongly in freedom of expression and therefore offers broad access to content across the web. Our search results are unbiased by our relationships with paying advertisers and publishers. We will continue to show search results according to our PageRank technology. Adding the Google AdSense ad code or WebSearch code to your site will not queue your pages for crawling by our main index bots. While our bot (Mediapartners-Google/2.1+) does crawl content pages for the purpose of targeting ads, this crawl is not associated with our main index crawl.  7. Can I cancel my Google AdSense account?  You can participate in Google AdSense for as long as you wish, and currently, you can cancel at any time by removing the AdSense ad code and WebSearch code from your website pages. If you no longer wish to receive correspondence from us, please notify us of your account cancellation by sending an email to  urlLink adsense-support@google.com . For complete cancellation terms, please see our Terms and Conditions. You'll receive your final payment from us approximately 30 days after the end of the calendar month. Please note, however, that Google will not make payments for any earned balance less than $1.00. If you wish to cancel, we encourage you to let us know why our program didn't work for you. Please email us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com . We'll carefully review your feedback. Our goal is to constantly improve our program, so we hope you'll try it again in the future when it may better suit your needs. In accordance with our Terms and Conditions, Google also reserves the right to terminate a publisher's account and refuse payment. Termination will apply to all selected products on an account (AdSense for search and AdSense for content). For complete cancellation terms, please see our  urlLink Terms and Conditions .  8. How do you prevent click and page impression spam?  Any method used to artificially and/or fraudulently generate clicks or page impressions is strictly prohibited. Google monitors clicks on Google ads to prevent abuse of the Google AdSense program. Google's proprietary technology analyzes clicks to determine whether they fit a pattern of use intended to fraudulently drive up an advertiser's clicks or a publisher's earnings. Clicks deemed by us to be invalid should not be included in your earnings. These prohibited methods include but are not limited to: repeated manual clicks, using robots, automated clicking tools, or other deceptive software. Please note that clicking on your own ads for any reason is prohibited, to avoid potential inflation of advertiser costs. All clicks must be generated as the result of a user clicking on the ads. We therefore require that Web pages do not include incentives of any kind for users to click on ads. This includes encouraging users to click on the ads or to visit the advertisers' sites as well as labeling the ads with text other than "sponsored links" or "advertisements." Please be assured that there is no need for test clicks in order to verify the validity of the ads. Our AdWords specialists review ads to verify that the destination URLs of the ads are working and lead to a valid website.  9. Can I display ads on search results pages?  Google AdSense now will allow ads to be placed on search results pages through our Online AdSense Program. Alternatively, Google WebSearch plus AdSense for search offers publishers the opportunity to provide search to their users, and to earn money from Google ads served to the search results pages. By simply adding a WebSearch box to any web page that meets our program policies, publishers can offer web search (and, optionally, site search) and benefit from Google-hosted, customizable, and monetized search results pages. For more information, please read the ' urlLink Getting Started ' section of this FAQ.   10. What are 'Alternate Ads?' Alternate ads allow you to utilize your ad space in the event that Google is unable to serve targeted ads to your page. By specifying an image, HTML page, or ad server of your choice, you can make sure that your advertising space is always being used effectively, either by targeted Google ads, or by your own choice of content. You can also select a solid color as your alternate ad, if you prefer not to display other advertisements or content when targeted Google ads are unavailable. Alternate ads count as page impressions like any other ad. Google does not keep track of clicks on alternate ads and you will not receive revenue for them. Alternate ads, if specified, will be shown when there are no targeted ads available for your page. The ad space will not be branded as 'Ads by Google.'   11. How do I Specify an Alternate Ad? You can specify an alternate ad URL from your Ad layout code page. Simply enter a fully qualified path to any image, HTML page, or ad server, and that URL will be loaded in the event that we cannot serve targeted ads to your page. You can also enter an HTML color code, to show a solid block of color when targeted ads are unavailable. 1. Log in to your AdSense account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense/ 2. Click Settings3. Click Ad layout code4. After selecting a color palette and ad format, enter a fully qualified path to your image file, HTML page, or ad server in the Alternate Ad text box, or click Choose a color to select an HTML color code5. Copy and paste the ad code into your site pages Your alternate ad can point to any of the following formats: Static Images Clickable Images: To load a clickable image, specify an HTML page containing the link information for your ad. An example of code to include in your HTML page is below:  urlLink    Ad Server: You can also enter the URL of your ad server. For more information on linking to a third-party ad server, please contact your ad network directly. HTML color code: Enter the hex code for any color to show a solid block of color as your alternate ad. Please note that the target image or ad will be cropped if it is larger than your selected AdSense ad format.   12. Do my users see the same ads that I see? The AdSense program uses geotargeting to serve Google ads to your pages - ads are specific to a user's region and language, based on their IP address. This means that the ads that are served to a user from Australia may be different than those that appear for a user from Canada. Geotargeting makes the ads even more relevant for visitors to your site, and also means that you may not see all of the ads that can be served to your pages. If you'd like to see what ads your users from other regions are seeing, our AdSense Preview Tool gives you the ability to preview the ads that would show on any web page, from a number of different locations. For more information, please read the  urlLink AdSense Preview Tool FAQ .  Eligibility   1. Are there eligibility criteria for my site in order to participate in Google AdSense?  Yes. There are  urlLink program policies  that you and your site must comply with in order to participate in the AdSense program. Please review our policies before submitting your application. Please note that we may change our policies at any time, and per the Google AdSense  urlLink Terms and Conditions , it is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with and adhere to the posted policies.  2. How do you enforce the program policies?  All publishers are reviewed for policy compliance when they submit their application. Also, we randomly monitor sites in Google AdSense to check for continued compliance with our policies. If we find sites that do not comply with our  urlLink policies  or  urlLink Terms and Conditions , we will suspend or terminate the accounts. In some cases, payment for clicks may be refused.  3. If I am a Google AdWords advertiser, can I sign up?  Yes. We are excited to help you find yet another way for you to increase your revenue. You can even use the same login name and password so you don't have to keep track of multiple Google logins. Editing your login information in one account will edit in the other as well.  4. Are non-English websites eligible for Google AdSense?  Yes. Google AdSense supports publishers in several different languages. Applications for participation in the program can be for sites with content primarily in: Danish Italian Dutch Japanese English Norwegian Finnish Portuguese French Spanish German Swedish You can select your site's primary language during the application process. If you're approved, AdSense will serve relevant ads to your pages in the appropriate language, even if your site contains multiple supported languages.  5. Can I sign up if I am already a part of an ad network?  Yes. However, we do not permit Google ads to be published on web pages that also contain what could be considered competing ads. This would include all content-targeted ads as well as text-based ads. Text-based ads, for this situation, can be loosely defined as ads that mimic Google texts ads or appear to be associated with Google text ads on your site. We do allow affiliate or limited-text links. If you already display Google ads on your pages via an ad network, you can still join AdSense and run ads on your site through our program. Multiple ad units may be displayed on each Web site page, but no ad unit can contain any advertisement in common with any other ad unit. It's your responsibility to work out any contractual issues that may arise with your ad network as a result of serving Google ads directly.  6. Can I sign up for more than one account?  Publishers are not permitted to maintain multiple AdSense accounts.  Payments   1. How much will I earn through this program?  The Google ads you are able to display on your content pages and WebSearch results pages are cost-per-click (CPC) ads. This means that advertisers pay only when users click on ads. You'll receive a portion of the amount paid for clicks on Google ads on your website. Although we don't disclose the exact revenue share, our goal is to enable publishers to make as much or more than they could with other advertising networks. We'll send your payment for your account balance in accordance with the  urlLink Terms and Conditions . You can view your earnings at any time by logging in to your Google AdSense account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense/  and clicking the Reports tab. You'll be able to see the total number of page impressions, ad clicks, clickthrough rate, effective CPM, and your total earnings so you can get an idea of how well the program is performing for you and how much you can expect to earn over time in the program. Please note that these reports and the information contained in them are confidential. However, we do understand that you may have a need to report yearly or quarterly total earnings from Google AdSense for tax purposes.  2. Does Google guarantee revenues?  Since the revenue that you may earn through Google AdSense depends on the content of each of your web pages or the search terms entered by your users, as well as the availability of related Google ads, Google does not guarantee that you will earn any revenue amount.  3. What form of payment will I receive?  Currently, AdSense participants will receive payments via check in US Dollars. We hope to add additional payment options in the coming months. Please check back here to find out when we release more payment methods.  4. When do I get paid?  Google will mail you a check approximately 30 days after the end of each calendar month that Google ads are running on your site or WebSearch results pages if your earned balance is US $100 or more, unless otherwise agreed to in writing (including electronic mail). If your account balance is less than $100, we'll send you a check approximately 30 days after the first month that your balance reaches $100. Balances include the combined earnings of AdSense and WebSearch pages. Please note that if a publisher's account is found to be in violation of our  urlLink Terms and Conditions  or  urlLink policies , we may at any time withhold payment (beginning from when Google initiates its investigation of potential violations), charge back the publisher's account, and/or refund advertisers for clicks received on the publisher's site or WebSearch results page. In addition, if a publisher is past due on any payment to Google in connection with the Google AdWords program, we reserve the right to withhold payment until all outstanding payments have been made. For a complete description of payment terms, please refer to the AdSense  urlLink Terms and Conditions .  Tax Information    1. Will I have to pay taxes on my AdSense earnings?  It is the responsibility of each publisher to understand and adhere to the appropriate tax rules. Google is required by United States tax laws to collect certain tax-related information from you. However, we are not able to provide you with tax advice. Any tax-related information provided by Google is not intended as and should not be construed as legal, tax or investment advice. You should always consult your tax advisor to help answer specific questions regarding how tax laws apply to you and/or your business.

For general questions about submitting your tax information to Google AdSense, you can email  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  2. Does Google have to collect my tax information?  Yes, if you are approved to participate in the Google AdSense Online Program, we are required to collect certain information from you for tax purposes. For U.S. publishers, this will include a tax I.D. such as a U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or a Social Security Number (SSN). International publishers will need to submit Internal Revenue Service form W-8, Form 8233, or certify that they do not have U.S. Activities. We have provided an easy-to-use interface that will help you to select the appropriate form for your tax situation. The tax information interface is available from the 'Tax information' page of your publisher account, below the Account Information tab. Google uses industry-standard SSL (secure socket layer) technology to protect this and other personal information you provide us. Please read the  urlLink Google Privacy Policy  for more information about what we do to protect your privacy  3. What if I don't have a tax I.D.?  If you do not have a tax I.D. such as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or Social Security Number (SSN), and are either a U.S. business or individual, or a non-U.S. business with U.S. Activities, as described on our AdSense  urlLink Tax Information Page , you'll need to acquire one. We suggest that you obtain your TIN as soon as possible. Please note that the process of obtaining a TIN may take several weeks. You can visit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website for more information on obtaining a U.S. TIN:  urlLink IRS information page .  4. How do I submit my tax information to Google?  We have provided an easy-to-use interface that will help you to select the appropriate form for your tax situation. Most of the forms are available to submit online, and instructions for submitting any other forms offline are also provided. The tax submission interface is available when you log in to your AdSense account. Please note that the tax information collection interface and any tax-related information provided by Google is not intended as and should not be construed as legal, tax, or investment advice. You should always consult your tax advisor to help answer specific questions regarding how tax laws apply to you and/or your business. The tax summary we have provided is necessarily incomplete, and the tax laws and regulations are subject to change. Therefore, Google does not guarantee and is not liable for the accuracy or completeness of any tax information provided, or any results or outcome as a result of the use of this information.  5. When do I need to submit my tax information?  Google began collecting tax information from all publishers on November 13, 2003. New publishers after this date must submit their tax information through the 'Tax information' page of their publisher account before any payments can be sent to them. If tax forms have not been submitted, you will still be able to access your publisher account, show ads, and register earnings. You'll collect all revenue due to you under the Google AdSense Online Program Agreement once you have submitted your tax information. Google will try to make such payments in the first payment cycle following your submission of this information (provided that you have met the $100 earnings threshold referenced in the Google AdSense Online Program Agreement).  6. What is an EIN and do I need one?  Publishers holding Business accounts may be required to provide an Employer Identification Number for tax purposes. To find out whether you need an EIN, please visit the IRS website at  urlLink http://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/ch01.html#d0e626 . In addition, all U.S. publishers applying for a Business account will be required to provide an EIN during sign-up for verification purposes. There are 3 ways to get an EIN: Online: Click the EIN link at  urlLink http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small . Your EIN will be issued immediately once the application information is validated. By telephone at 1-800-829-4933 from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the local time zone. By mailing or faxing Form SS-4, "Application for Employer Identification Number," to the IRS.  Format   1. What are the layout options for ads on my web pages?  Google lets you select the colors and layout that best fit your site. Ad ColorsYou can select from pre-defined color palettes, or you can create up to 100 of your own. Color palettes allow you to make sure that the ad text, background, and border colors complement your website. For added variety and freshness, you can even choose to rotate through up to 4 different color palettes at a time. To take advantage of this feature, you'll need a newer web browser with JavaScript functionality (Internet Explorer 5.5+ or Netscape 6+). However, the color choices will be visible to users of most web browsers. Ad LayoutsYou can choose from multiple ad layouts, designed to suit a wide variety of page designs. Examples of each format are available on the  urlLink Ad Formats  page. Please show only one ad unit per page.  2. How do I know which ad layout works best on my site?  You can use channels to track the performance of different ad layouts across your pages. Channels allow you to specify groups of pages for reporting purposes, and provide a detailed look at your clicks, impressions, and earnings. In addition, please read our  urlLink Tips  page for help with optimizing your pages for maximum AdSense revenue  3. Can I display more than one set of Google ads on a web page?  Only one ad unit may be placed on any web page, regardless of its layout, color, or ad type selection. Our  urlLink Terms and Conditions  state that multiple ad units may be displayed on each Web site page, but no ad unit can contain any advertisement in common with any other ad unit. Currently, there is no mechanism in place to ensure that duplicate advertisements will not be served to a second ad unit – consequently, only one ad unit may be placed on any web page at this time.  4. Can I alter the AdSense ad code?  No. Please paste the AdSense ad code into your web pages without making any modifications.  My Account   1. What reports can I view?  You'll be able to view reports for a specific day or date range, on an aggregate level or broken down into your defined  urlLink channels . You'll see the total number of page impressions, ad clicks, clickthrough rate (CTR), cost per thousand impressions (effective CPM), and your earnings. Aggregate reports are typically updated hourly, with an occasional delay of up to 24 hours. Channel report data is delayed 2 days to allow for synchronization of information across all channels.  2. What is a page impression?  We count a page impression when our AdSense JavaScript is actually executed by a user's browser and ads are displayed. This is generally the equivalent to a page view, but as described in question 3 below, there are instances that wouldn't execute the ad code and that would cause a discrepancy between the page impressions you register and the page impressions that appear in your AdSense account.  3. Why do I detect a different number of page impressions than what shows in my reports?  We count page impressions only when our ad code is executed by a user's browser. There are therefore several factors that would cause a discrepancy between the page impressions you register and the page impressions listed in your AdSense account. Instances that wouldn't execute the code include: Spiders, robots, or crawlers from other search engines Browsers that don't have JavaScript enabled or don't support JavaScript Browsers that don't support the   tag Programs that people may have written to grab website content  4. How do I change my password?  Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Account Information tab Click Login Information Click Edit login information Enter your old and new passwords in the fields provided Click Save changes  5. How do I change my payment address?  Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Account Information tab Click Address Information Click Edit address Edit your information Click Save changes If you require an update to your payee name, please contact us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  6. How do I edit placement of the ads on my web page?  Delete the AdSense ad code that you currently have on your page Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click Ad layout code under the Ad Settings tab Copy the ad code for the new layout you want Paste the new code in the appropriate place in your web page Save your changes, and the new layout should take place immediately  7. How do I customize the color of the ads on my website?  You can select from a number of built-in color palettes, or you can create up to 100 of your own. When you select a color palette and an ad layout on the Ad layout code page, the appropriate ad code is generated for you. You can select up to 4 palettes that will rotate randomly. To take advantage of this feature, you'll need a newer web browser with JavaScript functionality (Internet Explorer 5.5+ or Netscape 6+). To generate ad code with the palette of your choice: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click Ad layout code under the Ad Settings tab Select up to 4 color palettes by holding down the Ctrl key Choose the ad layout Copy-and-paste the AdSense ad code into web pages To create custom color palettes and manage your palette list: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click Ad colors under the Ad Settings tab(or click the Manage Color Palettes link on the Ad layout code page) Select a pre-existing color palette to start with Choose the color you want for each area of the ads (border, background, title, text, and URL) Name your new palette Click Save  8. How do I add sites to my filter list?  You can add up to 200 sites to your filter list. The URLs you enter into your filter list can be the actual URL of the website or the URL that is displayed on the ad for that website. Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click URL Filter List under the Ad Settings tab (for content pages) or Search Settings tab (for WebSearch results pages) Click Add / Edit Sites In the appropriate text box, enter the URLs of the sites whose ads you would like to filter from your site or WebSearch results pages Save your changes  9. How do I know the URLs of the ads on my site?  If you would like to add a URL to your filter list but the path is not visible, please do not click on the ad to retrieve the URL. Clicking the ads on your site will artificially drive up advertiser costs. We suggest using the AdSense Preview Tool to view the ads that will show on each of your pages. The Preview Tool allows you to click through to the advertiser's site without generating invalid clicks, and provides an easy way to display the target URL of all ads. For more information about the Preview Tool, including a download link, please read our  urlLink AdSense Preview Tool FAQ .Alternatively, to view the URL of ads directly from your web pages, you can also follow these steps: Right-click on the ad title and select either 'Copy Shortcut' (IE) or 'Copy Link Location' (Netscape). Paste the selection into a text editor for editing. The destination URL of the ad includes the text between 'adurl=' and '&'. As an example, the copied URL will appear as follows: http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/adclick?sa=l&ampamp;(...)&adurl=http://www.blogger.com&ampclient= or http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/adclick?adurl=http://www.blogger.com&sa= The destination URL in the example above is 'http://www.blogger.com'. You can view the ad by entering the URL into your browser's address bar. Adding 'blogger.com' to your filter list will block ads originating from this domain.  10. How do I add more sites to my account?  The scripts on the Ad layout code page and Search code page are valid for any page in any site on which you want to display Google ads. Simply add the code to any page, and we'll automatically detect the new site.  11. How do I cancel my account?  Currently, you can cancel your account at any time simply by removing the AdSense ad code and/or WebSearch code from your web pages. You will receive your final payment within approximately 30 days of the end of the month, or at the end of the year if your earnings balance is less than $100. Please note, however, that Google will not make payments for any earned balance less than $1.00. For complete cancellation terms, please see our  urlLink Terms and Conditions .  12. What is the Framed page checkbox?  Select the 'Framed page' checkbox if you will be placing your ad layout code on a page that uses frames. Selecting this option will tell our crawlers to gather content from the appropriate frame, thereby enabling us to serve relevant ads. Please note that your ad layout code must be included in the same frame as your page's main content.  13. How do I change my display language?  To change the display language for your AdSense account: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Account Information tab Click Login Information Click Edit Information and select a language from the Display Language drop-down list Click Save Changes This will update the display language for your account pages as well as for online resources, such as the FAQ and  urlLink program policies .  14. How do I change my payee information?  In order to protect your account, the payee name cannot be changed. Our program policies also do not allow the transfer of accounts. If you need to change your payee name for any reason, please contact  urlLink adsense-support@google.com . Our specialists will be able to cancel your current account so that you may submit a new application with your updated payee information  Image Ads   1. What are image ads?  Image ads are graphical ads offered initially in  urlLink 4 major formats . Unlike traditional banner advertising, Google's image ads are precisely targeted to the content of a publisher's web page using our AdSense contextual advertising technology. Advertisers target image ads by selecting keywords related to their product offerings, and Google matches the image ads to the content and context of your web pages. Running a combination of image and text ads expands the available ad inventory for your site, and offers the potential for increased revenue. Google's technology determines on a page-by-page basis whether text ads or image ads are likely to make you more money, and serves the appropriate format to your page. Google image ads are currently in beta and are not available on WebSearch results pages. Please send your comments and questions to  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  2. Do I have to run image ads?  The decision to run image ads is entirely yours. You can choose to run image ads in addition to text ads, or you can show text ads alone. You can decide which types of ads to run across your entire account or make your selection one page at a time. You always maintain full control over the types of advertising that show on your web pages.  3. How do I enable/disable image ads?  There are two ways to enable image ads: you can select a radio button in your AdSense UI to enable image and text advertising for all of your pages, or you can enable image ads for individual pages. Enabling image ads for individual pages will always override any selections you make on an account-wide level. Enabling image ads across your account: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Account Information tab Click Products Click Edit information To include image ads in the inventory for all pages, select Display text and image ads in all ad units. Please note that any page with a specific manual selection, as described below, will not be affected by changes to this setting. Enabling image ads for individual pages: Enabling image ads on individual pages is easy. Simply make your selection when generating your ad code and replace your existing AdSense code as described below. This is useful, for example, if you decide to include image ads on all of your pages, but don’t want image ads on your home page. Log in to you account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Ad Settings tab Click Ad layout code When generating your ad layout code, select either Text ads only or Include image ads from the Ad Type drop-down menu. Copy and paste this ad code into the appropriate pages of your site. Your manual ad type setting will remain in effect despite any changes made to your account-wide setting, as described above.  4. Will I earn more with image ads?  While we can't make any guarantees about the earnings potential of image or text ads, we believe that image ads will prove to be a high-performing option for publishers looking to monetize their pages. In fact, we show image ads when they have a higher value to you than the corresponding set of text ads that might otherwise run in the same slot.  5. Can I run only image ads?  At this time, we are only offering publishers the ability to select image ads with text ads on a given page. This allows us to serve the most targeted and highest revenue generating ads to your pages, providing a better user experience to your site’s visitors and potentially increasing your AdSense revenue. Also, because this is a beta feature that is new for advertisers as well as publishers, the available inventory of image ads may initially be low.  6. How are image ads reviewed?  Image ads are reviewed using a combination of human and automated processes before they are served to your pages. This review considers many factors, including image quality, the content of the image, and whether the ad is suitable for all audiences. If you see a Google image ad that you feel is inappropriate or misleading, please click the Feedback: Ads by Google link below the image ad. Using this link will flag the ad for additional review, and will also allow us to review your comments and suggestions to help us improve our AdSense program.  7. What are the formats in which image ads are available?  At this time, image ads are available in the following four formats: leaderboard (728x90) banner (468x60) skyscraper (120x600) medium rectangle (300x250) You can see examples of each of these formats on our  urlLink AdSense Ad Formats  page.  8. Can I customize the appearance of image ads on my site?  The border color of image ads can be customized using your color palette options. The border color will be the same as the border color that you have selected for text ads.  9. How can I track image ad performance?  Your AdSense reports will not show image ad clicks separately from text ads clicks at this time.  10. Will image ads slow my page load time?  Google image ads are limited to 50KB in size, and should have a minimal effect on load time for most sites.  WebSearch   1. What is WebSearch plus AdSense for search?  WebSearch is for publishers who wish to provide web search for their users, directly from any web page. WebSearch results pages use Google's search to provide relevant results, and the search results pages are customizable to fit with your site’s theme. In addition, results pages are monetized with Google ads that are targeted to the user's query – providing useful information for the user, and a new revenue stream for publishers. To add WebSearch to your web pages, simply complete our online application. If your site is approved, we’ll provide you with code to insert into your web pages that will generate our WebSearch box anywhere on your page.  2. How do I sign up?  The program is free, and Google pays you for valid clicks on the ads on your search results pages. So go ahead and try this program. If you comply with our  urlLink program policies , just complete our  urlLink online application  and select either or both of AdSense for content pages and WebSearch plus AdSense. One application gets you approved for both AdSense and WebSearch — you can decide to use any combination of these products on your pages. We'll review your application and follow up with an email within 2-3 days. If you are accepted into the program, you can log in to your new account and get the HTML code to insert into your web pages. Existing AdSense for content publishers do not need to apply again - simply activate WebSearch from the Products link below the Account Information tab in your AdSense account.  3. What is SiteSearch?  SiteSearch is an optional element of WebSearch, allowing users to search within the pages of your website. SiteSearch results also benefit from Google pay-per-click ads, allowing you to earn revenue from user searches of your site. Because SiteSearch uses Google's search index to return the most relevant results from within your domain, SiteSearch will not be able to search any pages that have not been added to the Google index. Please note that adding SiteSearch to any page will not queue that page for crawling by our bots. If you would like to manually add your site's main URL to our crawl, you may do so at  urlLink http://www.google.com/addurl.html . Submitting your site in this manner does not guarantee inclusion in Google's index.  4. How is WebSearch different from Google Free search?  While both search products offer Google's search to web publishers, Google WebSearch also offers the ability to monetize user searches from your site. Using AdSense technology to target Google ads to WebSearch results pages, we can provide publishers with relevant web or site search results as well as a new revenue stream. In addition, while both Google Free and WebSearch use Google-hosted results pages, WebSearch results pages are customizable and can carry the publisher's logo and colors. Both products are free for web publishers. Google Free code can be copied from www.google.com/searchcode.html. WebSearch code is only available to publishers who meet our  urlLink program policies  and  urlLink Terms and Conditions . If you’d like to submit a program application please visit  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense .  5. How does Google target ads to WebSearch queries?  WebSearch uses Google search to return search results to end users. The search results that appear on a WebSearch results page will be very similar to those that appear on Google.com. Google ads are targeted to these results based on our targeting algorithm, which takes words and phrases included in the query and matches them to relevant ad campaigns. Ads are also matched to the language of the query – for example, a search using a French query will generally return ads in the French language. Ads in other languages may appear, due to advertisers' targeting decisions.  6. How do I add WebSearch to my pages?  Providing WebSearch to your users is a simple process. If your application is approved, we'll provide you with WebSearch HTML code to paste into your web pages. You can paste the default code into your source to start providing search instantly to your users, or spend some time customizing the WebSearch box before pasting your code. To get the WebSearch code: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Search Settings tab Click Search Code Select your site encoding from the drop-down list Select the desired additional search options: SafeSearch and/or SiteSearch Choose your style palette. You can choose from our standard color palettes, or customize your palette to include your own colors and logo. Copy and paste the WebSearch code from the 'WebSearch Code' box into your HTML pages.  7. Is SafeSearch available for WebSearch?  Many Google users prefer not to have adult sites included in their search results. Google's SafeSearch screens for sites that contain pornography and explicit sexual content and eliminates them from search results. While no filter is 100% accurate, Google's filter uses advanced proprietary technology that checks keywords and phrases, URLs and Open Directory categories.  8. Can I display WebSearch and Google ads on the same web page?  Yes. You can place a WebSearch box on any page that meets our program policies, even if you're already showing Google ads on that page. Searches from the WebSearch box will lead to a Google-hosted results page that is also monetized with Google ads, allowing you to monetize all aspects of your site.  9. Can I use other internet search services with WebSearch?  We require that publishers do not add other internet search services to sites displaying the WebSearch box. Publishers using the optional SiteSearch feature may also use alternate site search products on their pages.  10. Are WebSearch clicks separated from content impressions and clicks?  Your reports are separated for the purposes of tracking AdSense for content clicks and WebSearch clicks. To view your WebSearch data, click the Search Performance link below the Reports tab in your publisher account.  11. How do I customize my WebSearch results pages?  WebSearch results pages are customizable to include your own color schemes and logo. Your logo can also be configured to be a clickable image, linking to the URL of any page that complies with our program policies. Your custom colors and logo are saved as 'style palettes,' allowing you to use different color schemes for results pages from different pages of your site. To customize your WebSearch results page: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense  Click the Search Settings tab Click Styles Using the color palette and the page element radio buttons, select a color for each element of your search results page. The example page will be updated with your new colors as they are selected. Enter the URL of the logo you'd like to show on this page. If no logo is selected, a transparent box will be displayed. If you've chosen to display a logo, enter the height and width (maximum 50 pixels) and the target URL of the image. Name this custom style palette and click Save. The style palette is now available for selection from the 'Search Code' page of your account.  12. What are the fees mentioned in the Terms and Conditions?  The WebSearch fees that are referenced in the AdSense  urlLink Terms and Conditions  will not be applied to all publishers. Google incurs a cost for each search that is performed through WebSearch, and generally we cover this cost through our portion of the earnings from advertiser clicks. However, publishers with very high numbers of searches in relation to their revenue may have an amount deducted from their final WebSearch earnings. We expect the number of publishers to be impacted by this to be very small – less than 1% will be affected. The WebSearch fees will never be greater than the publisher's WebSearch earnings, so no publisher will owe Google at the end of the month as a result of these fees. Earnings from AdSense for content clicks will not be affected. The adjustment will take place at the end of each month, when earnings are calculated.  Channels   1. What are channels?  Channels provide you with a way to view detailed reporting about the performance of your pages. By pasting channel-specific ad code into any combination of pages, you can track a variety of metrics across your sites. Track your leaderboard performance versus the performance of your towers, or compare your motorcycle pages to your automobile pages, by assigning each group of pages to a specific channel and comparing results in your custom channel reports. You can even assign a channel to each of your separate domains, to see where your clicks are coming from. With up to 50 AdSense channels, plus 50 WebSearch channels available for each publisher, you can use channels to gain the insight you need to optimize your site's performance. It's easy to add, deactivate, or rename your channels, and customized reports are simple to generate.  2. How do I create channels?  Before creating your channels, you may want to take some time to consider how channels can best be used on your site. Think about which metrics you would like to track – are you looking to compare performance of various ad layouts, or do you want to find out which groups of pages are generating the most clicks? When creating channels, we suggest that you use descriptive names for each channel, so that they are easily identifiable in your reports. Once you've decided how you're going to use channels, there are two steps to creating them: first, the creation of the channel name; and second, adding the channel-specific code to your web pages. To create a new channel name: Log in to your account at  urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense   From the links below the Ad Settings or Search Settings tab, click Channels Select the Create new channel radio button, and enter a channel name in the text field. We suggest using a name that will help you to identify this channel later. For example, carpages or blue_skyscrapers Click Edit/Activate channel. Your new channel will be added to the Active Channels list. To add the channel-specific code to your page: Click the appropriate Settings tab and click Ad Layout code or Search code, or click Continue to Ad Layout from the Create Channels page From the Channel drop-down list, select the appropriate channel for this code Copy-and-paste the ad layout code into your web pages. The channel identifier within your code will track performance on these pages. A page can be moved to a different channel by updating the code on that page. A page can also be removed from all channels by specifying No channel selection when generating the code.  3. How do I deactivate a channel?  Channels can be deactivated at any time from within your publisher account. Data will no longer be collected for deactivated channels, but you can always pull up the historical data for a deactivated channel when generating reports. You also have the option of reactivating the channel at a later date. Deactivated channels do not count towards your total allowed channel number. To deactivate a channel: Click the Settings tab Click the Channels link From the Active Channels list, select the channel(s) to remove Click Deactivate. To reactivate a channel: Click the Settings tab, or click Continue to Ad Layout from the Create Channels page Click the Channels link Select the Reactivate Channel radio button From the drop-down list, select the channel to reactivate Click Edit/Activate channel The channel will be reactivated, and added to the Active Channels list.  4. How do I view channel reports?  Channel reports are accessible from your Reports tab. After selecting a date range and breakdown type, select the Channels Data radio button. Choose any number of Active or Deleted channels from the channels list by holding the CTRL key while selecting. Click Display Report to create your custom channel report. Your channel reports will show data for all selected channels, including page impressions, clicks, and earnings data. Please note that data for channel reports is delayed 2 days before being displayed, as described in the question below.  5. How are channel earnings displayed?  Numbers for channel reports are not displayed in near-real-time as they are for aggregate reports. To allow for the data to fully synchronize across all channels, your channel information will be delayed for two days before being shown. These days will show No data available in your channel reports. Aggregate reports will show up to date information on an account level, which includes all channels as well as pages that are not assigned to any channel.  6. Can I download my reports?  Yes. AdSense offers downloadable reports in comma separated values (CSV) format. To download: From your reports page, generate the report that you would like to download When your report has been created, click Download CSV file from the header bar of your report A download prompt will appear - enter a filename and location, and click Save. CSV files can be easily imported into common spreadsheet applications. Downloadable reports make it easy to chart the results of your channels, as well as historical data from your account.  Copyright   1. What is your policy on copyright infringement?  It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). For AdSense publishers, if we receive a notice or otherwise have reason to believe that your site is infringing, we may terminate your participation in the program. More information about our DMCA process is available here  urlLink http://www.google.com/dmca.html .  2. What is copyright infringement?  If you have a question about whether what you are doing is copyright infringement, you should consult with a lawyer. Generally, copyright infringement involves making a copy of someone else's work without their permission. For more information on this Act, please refer to the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site at  urlLink http://lcWeb.loc.gov/copyright/ .  3. How do I report a copyright infringement by an AdSense publisher?  If you believe that another site is illegally copying the contents of your site, you may send a notice of alleged infringement by following the procedure at  urlLink http://www.google.com/dmca.html . When you have sent the notice, please notify us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com , and we will take appropriate action.  4. What do I do if I have been falsely accused of copyright infringement?  You may file a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA, at  urlLink http://www.google.com/dmca.html#counter . When you have done this, please notify us at  urlLink adsense-support@google.com .  Privacy and Security   1. Does Google collect information about my site?  We securely collect and store the information you provide us through your Google AdSense online account. We will also crawl your site periodically to serve the most relevant content ads on your site's pages.  2. What does Google do with my personal information?  First, we make sure that it is securely processed and stored as stated in the Google  urlLink Privacy Policy . We use your personal information solely for the purpose of running your account and communicating account information to you. Please note that Google may disclose to third parties personally identifiable information about you for the purpose of approving and enabling your participation in the AdSense Program as described in the  urlLink Terms and Conditions .  3. How secure is my account information?  We understand that completing an online transaction requires a great deal of trust. We take this trust very seriously, and make it our highest priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information you provide. Google uses industry-standard SSL (secure socket layer) technology to protect every interaction you have with us. This protects your tax I.D. and other personal information. Please also read the Google  urlLink Privacy Policy . Extremely boring!

Don't be daunted by the sheer numberof ways you can approach musical performance - most people find a few goodtechniques that fit their creative needs and build from there.  Have fun! The Producer setup will automatically uninstall any existing versions ofProducer found on your machine. It's recommended that you close Producer before attempting to install. The DirectX8 version of Producer defaults to a different folder than previousversions, so if you have a shortcut pointing to the old location that shortcutwill no longer work. Producer requires the DirectX8.1 version of DirectMusic, as Producer functionality is built entirely on top of DirectMusic. (The Producer installation process will prompt you to install the DirectX8.1 runtime bits, if they are not already present.)  DirectMusic Producer also requires IE6.0 (or higher).  Attempting to access Producer Help documentation will result in scripting errors with versions of Internet Explorer before IE6.0.  Note that Producer is very memory-intensive because of all of the editing, displayand undo information that is processed.  The overall authoring experience will be improved by having machines with a significant amount of memory.  Note also that DirectMusic runtime performance is much more efficient by comparison. DX8.1 Producer is not intended to be an authoring application for DX7 content. Demo8 Sample Content--------------------A project of sample content can be found on the SDK CD at "\dxf\dxsdk\essentls\dmusprod\democontent\dmpdemocontent.exe".  The project will install to "My Documents\DMUSProducer\Demo8\" on your hard drive. New in this Release-------------------1. Super low latencyThis option is defined via the MIDI/Performance Options button, enabling much lowerlatency, low enough to input notes from a keyboard in real time.  This is only available if your soundcard uses a WDM driver, and actual performance will vary depending on the speed of the machine. Note also that the threshold for auditioning the software synth while recording MIDI in Producer has been increased to 60 milliseconds.  If the total latency (as displayed in the Synth Status toolbar) is under 60 milliseconds then you'll hear the software synth play back notes while recording.  If it is over 60 milliseconds, then the software synth will be muted; in this case it is recommended to enable the local output of a hardware synth for recording MIDI input. 2. Wave capture streamlinedWhile the 'File Output' DMO is still available, it is no longer required for wavecapture.  Users can simply turn on "super low latency" (see #1) and set up wave capture in the wave/MIDI export toolbar. 3. DLS/wave editinga. The user has the option of selecting L, R or stereo files when selecting wavesfor DLS regions (stereo waves are still 2 mono waves under the hood though). b. "Replace" functionality for waves in DLS.  Right click on the wave to be replacedin the Waves folder, then select the new wave to take its place. c. Text labels provided on DLS regions (listing the wave used per region).d. Many more edit boxes (in addition to sliders) are writable in DLS. e. Insert Silence option in Wave EditorRight click in the wave editor, specify amount to be inserted at cursor.f. Resample WaveRight click in the wave editor: Resample, specify the new sample rate.  4. Segment Designera. Multiple waves imported as segmentsThere is a new item in the File menu: Import>Wave File as Segment.  In the file requester, users can multiple select wave files via Ctrl or Shift keys.  The resulting segments are clocktime segments that match the length of each wave.  b. Ability to edit segment length based on clocktimeIn the segment property page, users can now set length based on minutes, seconds and milliseconds. c. Wave Track objects can be multiple selected via Ctrl or Shift Clicking.d. Ability to start/stop segment while editing DMO in audiopathKeyboard shortcuts (Alt+<>) are functional while the DMO property page is open. 5. Project Tree sort by Name, File Type or File SizeRight click project name: Sort Tree>Name, Type or Size6. Direct Connection to Band per partApplicable to pattern or sequence tracks in segments, or patterns in styles.  Thereis a new band icon on the left side of the part.  To the left of the icon is the current instrument name (based on current position of the cursor) which enables the user to define a new instrument without opening the band.  By clicking the icon itselfthe user can select Open Band Editor, Insert New Instrument (position based on cursor)or Locate Band (which is helpful if you have a number of bands in a segment). 7. Cosmetica. Strip shading: strips in segments have a little more 3D look to them. b. Customizable wallpaperUsers can use custom bitmaps for the background area in Producer.  To edit, open DMusprod.ini and specify the path to the custom bitmap, for example: [Custom]Wallpaper=C:\WINNT\yourpicturehere.bmp8. Bug fixesMany performance and usability bug fixes are in this Beta release, too numerous to mention here.  One of the most egregious bugs that limited the size of scripts has thankfully been fixed. 9. A new transition flag: Don't Cut Off Secondary Segments, which allows secondarysegments not to be invalidated (or stopped) when switching to a new primary segment. New in DirectX 8-------------------------------------1. ScriptsOne of the major new areas in DirectX Audio is the ability to create scripts, giving the composer or sound designer much more control in actually implementing music and sound effects in interactive scenarios.  There are examples of scriptingincluded in the Demo8 project and in a DirectMusic sample. 2. AudiopathsAudiopaths provide users with a number of new capabilities, including the ability to create mix groups, route mix groups to specific buses, and to set up effects.  Audiopaths in most cases should be created as independent files. Audiopaths canalso be embedded in segments.  Right click the segment object New:Audiopath.  In order to be heard, "Play on new instance of embedded audiopath" must be checked in the segment properties.  However, the user is cautioned not to rely too heavily on embedded audiopaths as it is not economical - generally use global audiopaths and reserve embedded ones for situations where it is essential. To create a new audiopath, select File/New: Audiopath. At this point you'll be prompted to create an empty audiopath or one based on an existing one.  Next you'll be prompted to add pchannels to this mix group.  You should create a new mix group for each set of instruments that you wish to have independent control over the effects. If you wish to add more mix groups or add/remove pchannels to an existing mix group, right click under Mix Group. You can right click the Mix Group and select Properties to change the name of the Mix Group and to specify the Synthesizer.  Generally you'll want this to be the Default Synth. The default Audio Bus is Stereo (L+R), although you can right click to change it to a number of possibilities.  Note that you can insert additional buffers and specifystandard Reverb or Chorus send.  These sends can be modified via CC 91 (Reverb) andCC 93 (Chorus). One of the most exciting aspects of the audiopath is the ability to include a new format for what are commonly known as DirectX plug-ins.  The new format is calledDirectX Media Objects (DMO's), and allows for real-time control via the ParameterControl track in segments.  Standard effects as well as third-party plug-ins can be integrated.    On the right side of the audiopath editor is the effects palette.  These effects canbe dragged into an audiopath.  Each instance of an effect can have unique properties (as defined in the property page). To integrate effect sends, create mix groups with no pchannels, then insert sends in the Effects List.  The destination mix group, as well as a standard reverb send, will appear in the dropdown of the send property page.   IMPORTANT: To make an audiopath "active" as the default audiopath, select the audiopath file in the Transport Options toolbar. 3. DLS2Editing of DownLoadable Sounds level 2 files are supported in this release.  DLS2  includes layering of waves (with velocity mapping), a low pass filter, six segment envelopes and conditional chunks. To get started, select File/New: DLS Collection, and right click Insert Wave...  (stereo or mono).  Double clicking the wave icon will open the wave editor. Right click the Instruments folder: Insert Instrument.  After renaming the instrument (if you wish), double click the Instrument icon to open the Instrument editor.  To work in DLS1 mode, just use the bottom layer above the piano keyboard (marked DLS1).  Use standard resize and move icons to define regions.  Select the Wave (in the Wave dropdown) that you wish to use for each region in the Wave, and redefine Root if needed.  In this release, Stereo files can added to a DLS region (although under the hood they remain two mono regions that are linked).  Stereo files can also be broken into Right and Left when assigning to a region. To add other layers (DLS2 only), right click Insert Region in the 2nd layer above the piano keyboard.  Define the waves and resize the regions as previously described. If you wish to define regions by velocity, use the Velocity Range spin controls. DLS2 provides a second LFO, as represented by the Vib LFO tab in the InstrumentArticulation.  While the Mod LFO allows pitch or volume low frequency modulation, the Vib LFO only allows pitch.  To enable filtering, uncheck the DLS1 checkbox on the top right of the Articulation editor and check the Enable Filter in the Filter tab.  Here you can define the InitialFilter Cutoff, and Initial Q (resonance).  You can map these to Envelope 2 (the Pitch Envelope).  MIDI control of filtering is also enabled via CC 74.  One of the features of the DLS2 specification is to be able to define certain conditions under which a particular region or articulation would be downloaded. Select the Edit button to the right of the Condition dropdown (in the region or articulations list property page) to open the Condition Script Editor.  Right click in the editor to find the Queries and Operators supported.  By using the DLS Conditions (audition) toolbar, you can test out various conditions asdefined for each DLS2 region (or articulation).  Click the icon to the right of the dropdown to create a new configuration.  Give a name to the configuration, and set values for each of the queries. Regions and articulations that are not supported bythe current configuration (and therefore not downloaded) are displayed with a circle/slash ("verboten") symbol.       4. New segment track types in DX8 · Wave track Enabling one shot or streaming waves placed on a timeline.  File/Insert Files into Project and select your waves you wish to use.  The wave editor is available for basic cut and paste functions on the wave files (they become .wvp design files).  File/New: Segment, then right click in the editor Add Track(s): Wave Track. Double click the wave track to expand, then position the cursor at insertion point, right click Insert.  Select the wave in the Wave dropdown of the Wave Properties.  Drag and drop waves anywhere in the track.  The initial setting of a wave part is a single layer(a) and the next unnamed layer below.  As you insert or drag waves into the unnamed layer, this next layer is automatically created (b), and another unnamed layer is added.  For each Wave Part, 32 variations are available via the variation buttons at the top of the Part. Wave track is one of the tracks that currently supports clocktime (as set in the track properties).  When in this mode, editing and performance is done on a clock basis using minutes, seconds, grids per second and milliseconds.  Music time tempo does not affect the track in this mode.   · Parameter Control TrackParameter Control Track enables users to control the parameters of DMOs (DirectX Media Objects) in Audiopaths or tools in Toolgraphs over time. File/New: Audiopath, then edit the Audiopath  (or create an embedded Toolgraph) to contain the desired DMOs or Tools. Select the Audiopath in the Transport Options Toolbar to make it the active one. File/New: Segment, then right click in the editor Add Track(s)/Parameter Control Track. This creates an empty minimized track. Right click on this track and select Add New Parameter. This brings up the Add Parameter dialog which enables adding parameters for DMOs and Tools from the active Audiopath, an Audiopath embedded in the segment,  or a Toolgraph in the segment. Maximize the track once the desired parameters have been added then right click on the track: Draw Curve.  Draw the parameter control curve on the track by dragging a bounding box. The curve properties can be set through the property page. The start and end values and the position on the timeline can also be modified graphically by dragging the bounding frame for the curve or by dragging the curve across the timeline. Note that while there is a Toolgraph Designer shipping with DX8, there are no standard tools available with this release.  However, custom tools can be created by developers.  If you wish to integrate tools, please consult the documentation. · Script track Script tracks allow users to reference scripts at specific points in the timeline.  See the scripting section of the help file for more detail.     · Pattern track The Pattern track is essentially a sequence track that takes advantage of style note functionality and variations.  While it doesn't provide new functionality per se, it is a very quick way to create variable content that responds to chords.  File/New: Segment, then right click in the editor Add Track(s): Pattern Track.  Add Parts, define Bands and enter notes just as you would for the Sequence Track, but keepin mind that you have 32 variations available, and that the notes respond to chord changes based on their functionality.  (If you have a chord track in the segment, you can right click in the function bar on the left to define Keep Contant> MIDI Notes or Functionality.) · Segment Trigger track, allowing users to cue primary or secondary segments (both segments and motifs) along the timeline.  Note that triggering a primary segment willcause the currently playing primary segment to stop.  File/New: Segment, then right click in the editor Add Track(s): Segment Trigger Track.Right click Insert on beat boundaries in the timeline, then select either a Segment or a Motif in the Segment Trigger Properties.  If you choose a motif, then you must first select a style that the motif belongs to.    · The Lyric track already existed in design-time only Producer files, and is now enhanced to be an actual DirectMusic track type, allowing the user to use text cues for notifications.  5. Segment enhancements · Groove ranges (as opposed to groove levels)Notice in groove tracks that a range of values can now be defined, permitting anotherlevel of variability in performance.  If there are multiple patterns possible for a given groove definition, then a number of options for pattern repeat are available, including Random, Repeat Same, Sequential from 1st, Sequential from Random, No Repeats,and Shuffle (all possible will be played before repeating any patterns).  · Bypassing activity levelPreviously in template property pages, the Activity Level is now defined in the properties of the signpost track.  The activity level defines how many chords should be composed from the chordmap and signpost combination.  There is now an option to bypass this activity level, and simply choose a valid chord path at random.  This is now the default setting for activity level. 6. Expanded Style functionality · User defined embellishmentsIn addition to the standard Intro, Break, Fill and End transition patterns, custom patterns can be assigned a number between 100 and 199.  Segments can also be designatedin the A/B (Transition Options) button as transition segments.  · Embellishment destination levelIn DX7 a transition pattern looked at the previous pattern and played a transition that matched that groove level.  In DX8 a transition pattern can (in the property page) be assigned both a groove range (previous) and a destination range (next pattern).  This greatly enhances the possibilities for continuity in performance. · Enhanced variation performanceIn addition to the previous Play commands for variations (in random order and in order from first) there are three additional available: in order from random, with no repeats and shuffle (all possible will be played before repeating any variations). · Variation switch pointsIn DX7 a variation could only play in its entirety.  In DX8 the user can define specificenter and exit points for a variation.  These switch points are defined at the bottom ofeach part in the pattern editor, between the piano roll and the CC tracks. Switch pointscan be defined on grid boundaries (right click for options).  They exist in two broad categories: normal switch points, or switch only if a chord change warrants it (in conjunction with the Variation Choices Window). · New variation order optionsIn parts included in patterns, motifs and pattern tracks, previously only two modes were available: play "in random order" or "in order from first".  Now there are new options for ordering variations, including play "in order from random" (starts at a random variation, then proceeds in numerical order), "with no repeats" (won't play any two variations in a row) and "by shuffling" (won't repeat any variation until all variations have been played). · New flagsThere are a number of areas that expose new flags (or options) for performance.  Some that are notable include: the option whether to invalidate the segment when you cue a new primary segment, and the ability to regenerate the note when you encounter a new chordchange while the note is sounding. 7. ContainersContainers exist to allow users to package up all of the files used for a given purpose into a single parent file.  Files can be referenced or embedded, or any combination of the two.  The container is populated by right clicking and selecting "Add/Remove Files".You can also drag files from the project tree into either the Embed Runtime or Reference Runtime folders (design files are always referenced). There is a right click Locate in Tree function that allows the user to quickly find the source of any file in a container.  Container files also exist in script files as a way of referencing multiple files.  Theyappear in script files as Script Content, and also have Embed Runtime and Reference Runtime options. Compression-----------· Generally ADPCM compression types have the most flexibility in regard to sample rate.  You'll find the most success with MP3 and WMA when you compress at the same sample  rate as the wave file.  · Wave tracks do not support WMA compression.  They do, however, support other mono and   stereo ACM codecs.  DLS supports mono compression only, and does support WMA.     Can lead to performance problems:---------------------------------· Generally, it is bad practice to write script routines with large loops.  Doing so   could cause the routine to take a long time to execute.  If such a routine is used in   the script track, it could stall the performance, causing the segment’s playback to   stall or skip.  Once a routine is called, it cannot be stopped-even if a segment that   triggered it (via a script track) is stopped.  If such a routine is called directly   from the application, it could stall the application, preventing it from performing   other important tasks.· Setting the read-ahead value for streaming waves below 500 ms can cause part of the  wave to fall silent before it loops back.· Curve reset duration is longer than the curve's segment by default.  In most cases  this will have no impact but if you have problems with reset values it's something to  watch out for.  · In some hardware (e.g., Yamaha DS-1) changing the synth properties in the audiopath   property page can cause the pchannels to affected to play back as monophonic.  The   workaround is to reopen the property page, touch one parameter and close.· When there are tempo changes in the vicinity of a wave in a wave track (e.g., via   controlling segments or starting in the middle of a segment) the wave length can   be affected and may not play for the full duration.  Not intuitive:--------------· While audiopath is "active", adding or removing effects will stop the performance  and recreate the audiopath.· When creating a new audiopath based on an existing audiopath, the volume and pan  information does not get copied.  With this release, however, a new GUID is assigned  to the new audiopath. · DirectSound always sorts the Bus IDs so that they are always in ascending order.   In this release we have prevented the user from creating busses that are inappropriate  based on DirectSound ordering.  · Transitioning a segment with an embedded audiopath back to itself will cause playback  to revert to the global audiopath. · If you're compressing with WMA, append the sample with blank space at the end -   otherwise the sample may get truncated.  Also note that WMA compression is supported   for DLS, but not for waves in wave tracks.· When authoring DLS1 files, there are two checkboxes that need to be checked, one in the  articulation (on by default, next to the ADSR display in the instrument editor) and one   in the articulation list property page (off by default).  Note that the "Check for DLS1  Compatibility" function does not check for both checkbox states.· Lyrics and script error messages will not appear in the Message Window if the segment   playing does not have pchannel 1.  · If any referenced segments in a segment trigger track fail to load, then the entire   track will fail to load (or play).  Likewise with wave tracks: if any referenced waves   fail to load the entire wave track will fail to load (or play).· If wave edits are made in the Wave Editor while a segment references that wave in   a wave track, the wave will fall silent.  To work around this, force a redownload by  stopping the segment and making another edit to the wave (alternately by reinitializing  the performance by changing the number of voices for the synth).  · If your soundcard does not have WDM drivers (and hence, no "Super Low Latency" option),   Wave Export in the Wave/MIDI Export Toolbar relies on the "FileOutput" DMO to capture   and record music. To use the Wave Export feature you must create an audiopath that   contains the "FileOutput" DMO, which can be found in the audiopath designer's Effect   Palette, and then select this audiopath as the default audiopath.  If the performance   you are recording creates more than one instance of the "FileOutput" DMO, your recording   will span two or more .wav files because each instance of this DMO creates a separate   .wav file and records only the audio data that enters it.  Note that multiple mix groups  can have sends to a mix group with the FileOutput DMO. · Tip: if you have trouble with particular ports failing to create, switch to no audiopath  in the dropdown in the Transport Options, then to one of the Standard audiopaths.  Another  effective workaround is to switch to no input ports in the MIDI/Performance Options, then   reselect the port.· Under certain circumstances recording, playback and/or cursor timing may become out of sync.  A workaround is to change the default audiopath in the Transport Options Toolbar.· The user can set latency for the DirectMusic synth in the MIDI/Performance Options  dialog, but DirectSound latency is added to this number.  Depending on the speed of your  machine, it may take some tweaking to find the point where latency is low enough for real-  time input but high enough for solid audio performance.  With the Super Low Latency option  the DirectSound latency is greatly reduced. Other things to watch out for (from DX7):-----------------------------------------· You can usually switch to other music and sound applications without any  conflicts by hitting the "toggle MIDI" button (it's in the Transport  Options toolbar - the icon has music notes and is to the left of the MIDI   Options button).· Saving Producer files to a network share is generally not recommended.. It is recommended that waves placed in DLS collections have sample rates  between 4kHz and 80kHz. If a wave's sample rate happens to fall outside of  these boundaries its pitch will be incorrect on playback.· Be very cautious when referencing files to external projects, as links can  be easily broken (e.g., if the external project is not open at the   time that the referenced file is opened). · Watch out for MIDI files with GM or GS resets at the start of the file.  Bands created from MIDI files are given a tick value of -1 (to start  before the notes), and a GM/GS reset will override the band at that point.· When two events are placed at exactly the same point in time, DirectMusic makes   no guarantee about which will occur first.  With this in mind, very often   Bands in segments should have a negative offset to ensure that the proper   instrument settings will occur before the note start times. By default, bands   inserted into segments will have a start time of -1 in relation to the beat. · Selecting Voxware codecs for DLS compression may cause your machine to hang.  If this occurs, the only known recourse is to reboot your machine.               As i said, more crap.

(For information about how to get Service Pack 5, go to http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/).  To install Age of Empires II  1.   Turn on your computer and start Microsoft Windows 95 or later or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 5 or later. 2.   Place the Age of Empires II CD in the disc holder (if required), and insert it into your CD-ROM drive. 3.   If AutoPlay is enabled, click Install, and then follow the instructions that appear on the screen.       -or-       If AutoPlay is disabled, double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop, double-click the icon for your CD-ROM drive, and then double-click the AOESetup.exe icon. When the Setup screen appears, click Install, and then follow the instructions that appear on the screen.  B. Starting Age of Empires II  You must have the Age of Empires II CD in your CD-ROM drive to play Age of Empires II.  Age of Empires II will not launch or join a multiplayer game from the MSN™ Gaming Zone lobby if the player does not have the Age of Empires II CD in the CD-ROM drive. All players must have a CD inserted at launch time.  You can connect only to multiplayer games created with the same Age of Empires version you are using. For example, two players cannot play a multiplayer game if one is using Age of Kings 2.0 and one is using Age of Kings 2.0a.  To start Age of Empires II  ·         Place the Age of Empires II CD in the disc holder (if required), insert it into your CD-ROM drive, click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Age of Empires II, and then click Age of Empires II.  You can skip the opening cinematics by clicking the mouse or pressing ENTER, SPACEBAR, or ESC.  C. Getting Help  Information about Age of Empires II is in the in-game Help, in the printed manual, and on the foldout provided with the retail version of the game.  To display in-game Help  ·         Pause your pointer over any button or interface item in the game and Help text automatically appears on the screen. (To turn off in-game Help, click the Help button near the mini-map in the lower-right corner of the screen.)  The manual is also available on the CD in the Docs folder in .pdf format. You can view and print the file using Adobe Acrobat Reader.  To install Adobe Acrobat Reader  ·         Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop, right-click the icon for your CD-ROM drive, and then click Install Adobe Acrobat Reader.  D.   Changes to Formations and Manual Corrections  The following changes were made to improve gameplay in Age of Empires II after the manual was printed:  ·          Page 42: There is no longer a Select Formation button. ·          Page 43: There is no longer a Horde formation. You cannot control or disband a custom formation.  Manual corrections and clarifications are as follows:  ·         Page 107: Building Attributes table, Bombard Tower – 25W should be 100G. ·         Page 108: Non-upgraded Pikemen receive 0/0 armor (not 1/0 armor); Berserks have 55 hit points (not 48); Huskarls cost 68F, 34G (not 80F, 40G); Elite Huskarls cost 60F, 30G (not 80F, 40G) Elite Berserks have 72 hit points (not 60); Janissaries have 53 hit points (not 35); Elite Janissaries have 60 hit points (not 40). ·         Page 109: Non-upgraded Elite Mamelukes receive 10 attack (not 8 attack). ·         Page 131 and on foldout: Saracen Transport Ships can carry 10, 15, and 20 units depending on technologies researched (not double (2X) the number with each technology researched – for example, the Dry Dock technology). ·         Page 137 and on foldout: Viking Docks cost 25% less, not 33% less.  E. DirectX Troubleshooting  DirectX® 6.1 or later must be installed on your computer before you can play Age of Empires II. If you do not have DirectX installed on your computer and you chose not to install DirectX when you installed Age of Empires II, you will receive the message "A required .dll file, Dplayx.dll, was not found." To fix this problem, reinstall Age of Empires II and install DirectX 6.1.  If Age of Empires II installed DirectX but could not update your video drivers to be compatible with DirectX 6.1, when you restart your computer you will receive the message "Age of Empires II could not initialize DirectX. Make sure that DirectX 6.1 or higher is installed and contact your hardware manufacturer for a video driver update." To fix this problem, either get updated video drivers from your video adapter manufacturer or install DirectX in safe mode, which will replace the video drivers.  To install DirectX in safe mode  1.   Copy the DirectX directory from the Age of Empires II CD to your desktop. 2.   Click the Start button, and then click Shut Down. 3.   Select Restart, and then click OK. 4.   When your computer restarts, press and hold down the F8 key until you see a Windows Startup Menu. 5.   When you are prompted to enter a choice, select Safe Mode, and then press ENTER. 6.   After Windows starts in Safe Mode, open the DirectX folder on your desktop, and then double-click Dxsetup.exe to install DirectX.  If you experience sound or video problems using DirectX, go to http://support.microsoft.com/support/directx/ to get the latest troubleshooting information.  You should also check with your video or sound card manufacturer for the latest DirectX-compatible drivers.  F. Gameplay Troubleshooting  ·         Saving Games – You cannot name a saved game using certain operating system terms, such as COM1, LPT1, etc.  ·         Uninstalling Age of Empires II – If you uninstall Age of Empires II (to save disk space, for example), but you want to save your Age of Empires II campaigns and scenarios, you must click No when the uninstall program asks "Do you want to delete all user-created files?”  ·         Moving Campaigns and Scenarios to a Different Computer – You can move the files for your Age of Empires II games to another computer. Age II files have a .gam file extension – for example, Age2.gam.  To transfer your campaigns, move the *.cpn files from the Campaign folder where Age of Empires II is installed to the same location on another computer. Then transfer all of the scenarios in that campaign and the Player.nfo file as explained below.  To transfer your scenarios, move the *.scn files from the Scenario folder where Age of Empires II is installed to the same location on another computer.  To transfer your player name and progress through the campaigns, move Player.nfo from the folder where Age of Empires II is installed to the same location on another computer. If you are moving the Player.nfo file to a computer that already contains a Player.nfo file, you may want to rename the file on the computer to which you are moving files so you do not overwrite the existing Player.nfo and lose the campaign information it contains.

This is a limitation of some older video cards and will not affect game performance or stability.  If you notice screen corruption when switching to a high in-game resolution, this may be due to the limitation of certain monitors or some older, lower-end video cards that do not support higher resolutions. Use ALT+F4 to exit the game, restart Age of Empires II, and then use the Options screen to switch to a lower in-game resolution.  H. Audio Troubleshooting  ·         Aztech Direct Sound Driver – You may experience choppy sound on this driver. If this occurs, contact the manufacturer for an updated driver.  ·         DirectX – If you experience audio problems using DirectX, connect to the DirectX Web site for the latest troubleshooting information, as explained in "DirectX Troubleshooting," earlier in this Readme file.

If this occurs, exit and relaunch from the Zone.  Command Line Parameters  You can add parameters to the Age of Empires II command line to customize startup or resolve problems with certain hardware configurations.  To add parameters to the command line in the Age of Empires II shortcut  1.   Right-click the Age of Empires II shortcut, click Properties, and then click Shortcut. 2.   In the Target box, type the name of the parameter after the existing command line text. For example, if you add the parameters NoStartup and NoTerrainSound, the command line will read "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires\Empires2.exe" Nostartup Noterrainsound. Parameters must be separated by a space; capitalization is not important.  To add parameters to the Age of Empires II registry for multiplayer games using the MSN Gaming Zone  1.   Click the Start button, and then click Run. 2.   Type Regedit, and then click OK. 3.   Double-click Hkey_local_machine/Software/Microsoft/DirectPlay/Applications/Age of Empires II/CommandLine. 4.   In the Value data box, type the name of the parameter after the existing command line text. For example, if you add the parameters NoStartup and NoTerrainSound, the command line will read "Lobby NoStartup NoTerrainSound." Parameters must be separated by a space; capitalization is not important. Do not remove the word "lobby" from the command line.  The command line parameters include:  ·         NoStartup – Skips all cinematic sequences before the game starts.  ·         800, 1024, 1280 – Sets the screen resolution to 800 ´ 600, 1024 ´ 768, or 1280 x 1024. For example, 800 sets the screen resolution to 800 ´ 600, 1024 sets the screen resolution to 1024 ´ 768, and 1280 sets the screen resolution to 1280 x 1024. You can also set the screen resolution by clicking the Menu button during gameplay and then clicking Options. If you use a command line parameter to set the screen resolution, the game always starts at that resolution, even if you use Options to choose another resolution. Note that the interface screens before the game will always be displayed in 800 x 600 mode.  ·         Mfill – Fixes horizontal line problems and black screen areas that may occur with some video adapter configurations.  ·         NormalMouse – Replaces the custom mouse pointer with a standard mouse pointer.  ·         NoSound – Turns off all sounds, except those played in cinematics.  ·         NoTerrainSound – Turns off all terrain sounds.  ·         NoMusic – Turns off all music.  ·         Msync – Fixes lock-up problem that may occur with some SoundBlaster AWE configurations.  Poor Frame Rate  ·         Voodoo 3 Video Cards – If you are running Windows 2000, you may experience poor frame rate. If this occurs, contact your video card manufacturer for the latest drivers.  J. Multiplayer Troubleshooting  ·         Best performance – For best performance, connect to the Internet before starting an Internet multiplayer game.  ·         Age of Empires Versions – In a multiplayer game, all players must be using the same version of Age of Empires. For example, if you are using Age of Empires II version 2.0a, only Age of Empires II version 2.0a games appear in the multiplayer list, not Age of Kings 2.0, Age of Empires, or Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome Expansion games.  ·         Serial or Modem Connections – You may have difficulty joining a multiplayer game or you may be dropped from a game before it starts when playing over a serial connection or a modem connection. To fix this problem, all players should install DirectPlay® 6.1A.        To install DirectPlay 6.1A        1.   Open My Computer, and then right-click the Age of Empires II CD.       2.   Click Install DirectPlay 6.1A.       3.   Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.  ·         Multiple IP Addresses – If other players are not able to connect to a game you have created by typing the IP address that appears when you click the IP button on the Multiplayer Game screen, you may have multiple IP addresses. You can display all of your IP addresses by running Winipcfg.  To run Winipcfg  1.   Click the Start button, and then click Run. 2.   Type Winipcfg, and then click OK. 3.   Select PPP Adapter. The correct IP address is displayed in the IP Address box.  ·         Multiplayer Performance – If you experience performance problems during a multiplayer game, try playing at a lower screen resolution or have the host set the game speed to Slow in the Multiplayer Game screen.  ·         Computer Players in Multiplayer Games – It is not recommended that computer players play in a multiplayer game over the Internet as it may slow the game. If you would like to add computer players to a multiplayer game, make sure the player with the fastest computer and fastest connection hosts the game.  ·         Connection Type – Always select Internet TCP/IP Connection for DirectPlay when starting a multiplayer game over the Internet. (Select the Local (LAN) TCP/IP Connection if you are playing on a private or home network.) If you choose LAN and you are playing on the Internet, the game may hang. If this occurs, restart Age of Empires II and select Internet TCP/IP Connection for DirectPlay.  ·         Joining a restored game – If you attempt to join a restored game via direct IP and the game was launched from the Zone, you will not be able to join the game. If a Zone restored game fails, all players should exit the game and rejoin through the Zone.  ·         Different modem speeds – If two players have different modem speeds, they will be unable to play with each other. To fix this problem, use the same modem speed as your opponent.  ·         Home networks and dial-up connections – If you have a network card and you dial in to the Internet via modem, you may have trouble launching multiplayer games. To fix this problem, unplug the network cable from your network card before connecting to the Internet.  K. Map Editor  You may experience problems when creating your own background art for campaigns in the Map Editor. If this occurs, do not use the first or last 10 colors in the color palette.  L. Recorded Game Version Compatibility  Recorded games can only be played using the same version of Age of Kings that was used to record the game. For example, you cannot play an Age of Kings 2.0 recorded game using Age of Kings 2.0a.  M. Balance Changes in 2.0a Update  Town Center – The following changes have been made since version 2.0:  ·         The resource cost to build a Town Center has been increased by 100 stone. ·         The time to build a Town Center has been increased. ·         Missile technologies available at the Blacksmith (Fletching, Bodkin Arrow, and Bracer) no longer increase the range of the Town Center. ·         Teutons: The Town Center no longer has increased range. ·         Britons: The 50% decrease in the cost to build a Town Center now applies only to wood, and this reduction in wood cost is not available until the Castle Age.  N. Enhancements and Bug Fixes in 2.0a Update  The following improvements have been made since version 2.0:  ·         Single Player Performance – The performance of single player campaign games has been improved, especially on lower-end computers.  ·         Limited Pauses – The total number of pauses available to each player in a multiplayer game is now limited. The total number of pauses remaining is displayed each time the game is paused.  ·         Display Name of Out of Sync Player – In a multiplayer game with three or more players, if a player goes out of sync, that player's name is displayed in the out of sync message on all computers.  ·         Stability – A number of crashes and multiplayer out of sync bugs have been fixed, resulting in improved game stability.  ·         Computer Player Resigning Bug – The computer player will no longer resign after a few minutes of play. (This fix was previously available in the AI Update.)  ·         Fish Trap Bug – You can no longer build a Fish Trap on top of an existing fish resource.  ·         Fishing Ship Bug – You can no longer use a Fishing Ship to construct buildings other than a Fish Trap.  ·         Flare and Waypoint Bug – The game no longer crashes when you set a flare or waypoint location at the Southern-most point on the map.  ·         Cooperative Farming Bug – When you take over a Farm foundation built by an ally, you can no longer extract more than the standard amount of food from that Farm.  ·         Farm on Forest Bug – You can no longer build a Farm or wall on top of a partially cut section of forest.  ·         Units Ignoring Orders Bug – Units no longer ignore orders under some circumstances.  ·         Multiplayer Restore from Zone Bug – The ability to save and restore a disconnected or out of sync multiplayer game on the Zone has been improved.  ·         Foundation Outline Bug – Building foundations now have outlines, so you can now click them when they are behind trees or other objects.  ·         Trebuchet Firing Bug – Trebuchets no longer miss targets that are on a different elevation.  ·         Single Player Campaign after Regicide Bug – A single player game will no longer automatically end immediately after a multiplayer Regicide game is played.  ·         Computer Player Bugs – The behavior of the computer player in multiplayer games has been improved.  ·         Scenario Editor Bugs – A number of Scenario Editor bugs have been fixed.

       A friend of mine actually took out time to write this trash and then actually sent it to me.        Microsoft® Age of Empires® II: Gold Edition Version 2.0 © Microsoft Corporation, 2001. All rights reserved.  Microsoft Age of Empires II: Gold Edition Version 2.0 contains both Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings and Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion—as well as the new features explained in this document.  Custom Random Maps Play using one of the many random maps custom designed by Ensemble Studios. The custom random maps may not work effectively for certain types of games or when you are playing against a computer opponent. Computer opponents assume that all custom maps are Coastal. So a map with terrain that is vastly different may decrease the typical skill level of computer opponents.  If you play a regicide game using the custom map ES@Pilgrims_v2, you do not start the game with a Castle. If you play a regicide game using the custom map ES@Metropolis_v2, you start the game with three Kings and three Castles. Also, if you play ES@Pilgrims_v2 with 7 to 8 players, some players may instantly resign.  To play using a custom map, click Single Player on the main menu, click Standard Game, set the Map Style to Custom, and then select one of the following maps as the Location.  For a full description of each map, go to    urlLink   http://www.ensemblestudios.com/aoeiix/docs/rms.shtml     .  ·         ES@Canals_V2.rms -- A network of canals creates a spider web effect as they try to connect every player's starting town.      ·         ES@Capricious_V2.rms -- Starting food, gold and stone might be at normal levels, in short supply, or in abundance.  Starting trees will always be the same     . ·         ES@Dingos_V2.rms -- Villagers shepherd their flocks while avoiding rampaging wild animals. Lots of sheep, lots of wolves, no Scout. ·         ES@Graveyards_V2.rms -- Control weed-choked graveyards packed with scary trees and abandoned buildings that conceal resources and ancient relics. ·         ES@Metropolis_V2.rms -- Control three Town Centers, three sets of villagers, three Scouts and three sets of resources! ·         ES@Moats_V2.rms -- Each player's town is surrounded by a narrow body of water with several land bridges for access and moats narrow enough for ranged units to fire across. ·         ES@Paradise_Island_V2.rms -- Start on a tropical island with your enemies. The map is loaded with fish, boars, and berries. Find the three relics at the base of the volcano in the center, but beware of the guardians! ·         ES@Pilgrims_v2.rms -- Your starting island may be small, but there is a whole new world to discover! Hop in your Transport and race your enemies to the new world! ·         ES@Prairie_V2.rms -- Food is often scarce and there aren't a lot of natural defenses, but your two Scouts can cover a lot of ground. ·         ES@Seasons_V2.rms -- Based on the 4 seasons in a year, with a 25% chance of loading up a Winter map, Spring map, Summer map, or Autumn map. ·         ES@Sherwood_Forest_V2.rms -- Multiplayer only.

Start out with some familiar heroes. ·         ES@Shipwreck_V2.rms -- A few bruised villagers and their waterlogged sheep stranded on a desert island. ·         ES@Team_Glaciers_V2.rms -- In the frozen north, each team must defend its own hunk of ice and snow against frequent enemy raids. Bad weather makes ships and walls rare, though strangely, this has led to a bumper crop of deer. ·         ES@The_Unknown_V2.rms -- Everything is random. Everything. From the moment the game starts, you have to scout (with a random number of Scouts, of course) to figure out whether you are on an island, a mainland, or inside a clearing of trees.

To play a blind random map, click Multiplayer on the main menu, and then set the Map Style to Blind Random.  Turbo Random Map In turbo mode, all buildings work 2.5 times faster except when building economic units (fishing boats, trade ships & carts, villagers).

Advanced Tutorials Take the next step beyond the William Wallace learning campaign. Watch these recorded games played by expert players and learn the strategy behind a great game.  To play the advanced tutorials, click Single Player on the main menu, click Saved and Recorded Games, and then select a recorded game to play. A Narrated Battle Recommended settings: Fog of War ON and View Lock ON so you see exactly what Maimin_Matty sees as he explains his moves.  Maimin_Matty narrates his strategy as he builds a strong economy and advances to the Imperial Age to defeat his two opponents. In the Dark Age, he explores for resources, creates villagers to build a strong economy, gathers food (to build more villagers and advance to the Feudal Age), and gathers wood to build Houses to support the growing population. In the Feudal Age, his goal is to gather enough food and gold to advance to the Castle Age and enough stone so he can build Town Centers. In the Castle Age, he immediately begins building Town Centers to protect his gold and stone mines and creates lots of villagers. He also researches all technologies that improve villager gathering capacity and the amount of food Farms produce. Then he cranks out the Farms and villagers and gathers enough food to advance to the Imperial Age. In the Imperial Age, he researches technologies to improve the attack strength and armor of his infantry units and then concentrates on upgrading to Champions. Then he moves his campaign forward onto enemy ground to defeat his opponents.  Castle Age Warfare Recommended settings: Fog of War OFF and View Lock OFF so you can watch both players.  A battle between two ancient foes. Maimin_Matty’s Feudal Age rush falls short as The Sheriff speeds to the Castle Age. The Sheriff’s economy is weakened, but as his advanced empire expands, Maimin_Matty is forced to advance to the Castle Age or die at the hands of The Sheriff’s superior army. After reaching the Castle Age, Maimin_Matty uses his forward villagers to build a Town Center and Castle and establish a forward base in The Sheriff’s land. The Sheriff invests a lot of resources into Cavalry Archers, but loses his main base in a devastating battle. As the Japanese foot soldiers begin to flood the map, the game quickly comes to an end.  Feudal Age Rush Recommended settings: Fog of War OFF and View Lock OFF so you can watch both players. Maimin_Matty and The Sheriff both use an early-rush strategy that leads to a prolonged Feudal Age fight that draws the lines of battle for the game (The Sheriff is on the defensive). In the Feudal Age, it’s infantry vs. archers. In the Castle Age, siege weapons and knights come into play as the players struggle back and forth. Which unique unit or civilization attribute will turn the tide in the Imperial Age? In the end, Maimin_Matty triumphs with Huskarls.

       This is what I was reading:    ProjectExport to HTML Help allows you to export your help project to Microsoft’s new HTML Help format. The export will: • Convert all topics from RTF to HTML, saving each topic in a separate HTML file. • Convert all BMP and SHG files used in your project to PNGs or GIFs as you wish. For SHGs, an image map will be inserted into the HTML file of the topics using it. Note that GIF files can have no more than 256 colors, so true color images may lose some color information. But since most images in help files are screen shots, GIF is the appropriate file format to use. PNG is definitely the better choice than GIF, unless you want the HTML output to be compatible with ancient browser versions. • Convert the data from the Contents Editor into an .hhc HTML file. • Compile all your keyword footnotes into an .hhk HTML file. • Create an .hhp HTML Help project file Things to note: • Since HTML Help does not support popup links, all popup links will be converted to regular links • WinHelp macro’s and the like will not be converted, since there are usually no equivalents in HTML Help. You can open the exported .hpp project into Microsoft’s HTML Help workshop and compile all those files into a single .chm file, which you can distribute along with your application. You can download the HTML Help workshop from http://www.helpscribble.com/helpcompiler.html. Note that the user of your help file will need MS Internet Explorer 4 or later and the HTML Help support files. These come with the HTML Help workshop package and are also included in Windows 98 and 2000. Export to Web Help ProjectExport to Web Help will export your help project to a series of HTML files that you can upload to your web site to provide online documentation. There are several options to choose from. You have three choices for the layout of the HTML pages: •Simple pages: create one HTML file for each topic, with no navigational aids besides the links already present in the topic text. •Simple pages with navigation header: create one HTML file for each topic with a navigation header added at the top. This header has a link to an HTML file showing the table of contents and a link to an HTML file with the index. If you have used the browse sequence editor, Next and Previous links will be added as well, implementing the browse sequence. •Contents in frame: Create a frameset page showing the contents or index in the left frame (both with a link to each other), and the topic text in the right frame. The topic text will have the navigational header as in option 2. You can choose whether images should be converted to GIF and PNG format. PNG is the best choice since it does not have GIF’s 256 color limitation and, more importantly, is free of any kind of patent issues. Choose GIF if compatibility with ancient (Netscape 3, MSIE 3) browser versions is important to you. Since you cannot be sure if the person reading your documentation on your web site has all the fonts installed that you have, you may want to use the Font Substitution grid to automatically substitute fonts. In the left column of the grid you need to put the name of the font you want to substitute. In the right column, place the alternative font names, separated by commas. The web browser will first try the fonts from left to right, until it finds one that is installed on the reader’s computer. It is a good idea   I fell asleep reading this good for nothing manual and when I woke up started reading from another page. The boring text is given below.   The merge function allows you to merge two HelpScribble projects. That is, you can add the topics of another HelpScribble project to the current project. When you pick ProjectMerge from the menu, HelpScribble will ask you which project you wish to merge with the current one. Then, a dialog box will show up. First you must select which topics from the project you are about to merge with the current one, must be added to the current project. You can select to merge all the topics, only the topics within a certain Topic ID range, topics which are part of a certain browse sequence, or topics which have the status property set to a certain value. With the last two options, the marked browse sequences or topics with a marked status property will be added. Topics with no browse sequence or status setting will not be added. In a Windows help file, each topic must have a unique Topic ID. So, you will have to tell HelpScribble what to do if one or more of the topics you selected to be merged with the current project, have a Topic ID that is already taken in the current project. You can decide to have the topic in the current project replaced with the topic with the same Topic ID from the project to merge. The second option is to skip the topic with the taken ID and thus leave the topic in the current project as it is. When you select the third option, the topic from the project to merge will receive a new, unique topic ID (the first one available following the one it had). Links to that topic will be automatically updated. The merge function can be very handy in several cases. One situation could be that you need to have your help file translated into different languages. When you update your help file, it would be handy that only the updated topics would have to be translated again. You can do so by storing version numbers in the Status property of each topic. When you have updated your help file, open the translation of the old version, select ProjectMerge and select to add only the topics with a version 2 status value. The status field will also help the translator to quickly locate the topics that have been changed.    If you right-click on a topic in the grid, a context menu will show up. The context menu always shows these commands, which apply to the entire topic. If you right-click on certain footnotes, you will get additional commands (see below). • Edit topic • Insert topic • Delete topic • Footnotes • Cut • Copy • Paste • Create link • Create popup link • Bookmark Right-clicking on a title or keyword footnote will offer you the commands above. However, if you right-click on a status or build tag footnote, you will see that some items have been added to the top of the context menu. Selecting one of those will change the value of the footnote to the selected context menu item. This is a handy way of setting these footnotes for a large number of topics. Right clicking on a browse sequence footnote will add a command that starts the Browse Sequence Editor. Title: Click the Title button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of title footnotes in the Topic Grid. Keywords: Click the Keywords button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of keyword footnotes in the Topic Grid. Browse sequence: Click the Browse Sequence button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of browse sequence footnotes in the Topic Grid. Build tag: Click the Build Tag button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of build tag footnotes in the Topic Grid. Status: Click the Status button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of status fields in the Topic Grid. A-Keywords: Click the A-Keywords button above the Topic Grid to toggle the display of A-Keyword footnotes in the Topic Grid. Edit topic: Edit the topic you selected in the Topic Grid. Insert topic: Insert a topic in the help project, after the topic you selected in the Topic Grid. Delete topic: Delete the topic you selected in the Topic Grid. If you mistakenly issue this command, pick TopicUndo from the menu. Footnotes: Edit all the footnotes in the topic you selected in the Topic Grid with the Footnote Editor. Cut: Deletes the topic you selected in the Topic Grid and puts it on the clipboard. This action affects the whole topic. If you only want to cut a part of the topic text, double-click on the topic in the Topic Grid to activate it, select the text you wish to cut, and press Shift+Del on the keyboard or use the Cut command from the Text menu. Copy: Puts a copy of the topic you selected in the Topic Grid on the clipboard. This action affects the whole topic. If you only want to copy a part of the topic text, double-click on the topic in the Topic Grid to activate it, select the text you wish to copy, and press Ctrl+Ins on the keyboard or use the Copy command from the Text menu.  I am so bored. I just don't know why I've been forced to read this. Will post after I finish this manual. That's all for now

       I'm bored.   What should I do now? I don't know. I don't know what blogging is all about. I've seen people who can write something every single day, churning out good quality posts. I'm not able to come up with a good post even once a month. It is sad.   Nothing can be done about. Now, if you go to gudiblog.blogspot.com you'll get to see an interesting type of a blog. It's like Gursartaj is being forced to blog. While if you go to  urlLink www.karanmisra.com  or  urlLink www.thepanda.org  or bloodfistklan.tripod.com, you get to see experienced and expert bloggers in action.   It's interesting how the mind of a blogger works.   I'm not a blogger so i don't know. There were two reasons for my setting up a blogger account. One was that I heard all blogger members were getting gmail accounts so i thought it was worth a try. Secondly, it was also required to post anything on  urlLink www.exunclan.com/logexun     I havent received an invite from google for over a month now, so i've kind of lost hope of receiving one now. Though I know feel that if I become a faithful and loyal blogger I may receive one. But if anyone has a spare gmail invite please send it to me. Please, i beg of you, spare me the effort. I need a gmail account real bad.   As a faithful and loyal blogger member I've tried to long a relatively long post though my post sort of gets overshadowed by those of most experienced bloggers. Maybe writing more often will be equal to one really really long post.   That's all for now   C'est moi

       For the first time, I think Exun has been made an official school body. Along with the appointments for 2004-05, yesterday the Exun appointments were also announced. We'll be having dual-Presidency this year with me and Maanick. The third official post is that of 'Head of Programming' and Prateek Rungta is taking it up.  Of course, everyone isn't happy with this decision. It's also not all that good for us. I wanted to be a member of the Editorial Board, but now that Exun is an appointment and one person can have only one post, that will never happen. Also,  urlLink some alumni  don't like the idea of Exun becoming official. It has its advantages and disadvantages, but I hope it's all for the best.  Cheerio --Karan

       Right, this is an easy one. All you have to do is write a program.   Here is what it does:  The user is given a list of cards which are arranged in columns. He/She must choose a card and keep it in mind. Through repeated shuffling, the program will ask him/her to identify the column in which the card is. In the end the program tells the user his/her card. The cards in the columns are randomly selected into the column, that is, you can't decide the column in which a perticular card goes.   WARNING-- I have the source code that's available on the net for this, so don't try to give me gum.    ---- Bloodfist out.

        SpokesBlah Logs On   Greetings from your officially unoficial SpokesBlah. I would just like to point out that I'm not planning to sit on my ass and do nothing. I shall, indeed, be quizzing, speaking for exun, and I shall also be assiting in Talent Hunts, along with Presidents Sirs.

       Let's keep it plain and simple. Most of the members showed up. This log was discussed and the URL was given to all members, and if anyone's smart enough to log on to www.exunclan.com, they'll be able to make their way here.  So, anyway, this site serves the following purposes: - Serve the Exun members with news about upcoming events and competitions (including intra-school events and meetings) - It's a place where we will post Quizzing, Programming questions so that Exun members can hone their skills.  - Submit Reports like this one for the Exun community (and basically anyone else who cares to read) - A place where any Exun member can post an entry and be heard by everyone else. Comments help to communicate between authors and readers.  Apart from that, we announced that each Class (from VIII to XII probably) would be having a Domain Square representative who would be incharge of advertising and promotion for that class. This will help us make Exun kind-of object-oriented and easier to handle, especially in these gaming events in which the participation is large. By object-oriented, I mean to say that each person at his/her level gets his/her duties done and then reports to his/her superior. Just that. The superior shouldn't have to know what the person is doing or how he's doing it.  Maanick Nangia discussed his Project Billboard which should see growth over the next few months.   Exun made a call for new talent for the group, people who are not only skilled at what they do, but more important, sincere, assiduous and interested.  Oh yes, quite an important thing was that member photos got taken and the member list got updated, which shall be reflected on the website soon.  Mukesh Sir stressed the importance of the fact that Exun members need to keep interacting with each other, not only for the sake of it, but also in that it gives meaning to the fraternit&eacute; and everyone learns something or another from someone else.  Every Exun member shall be delegated tasks and given deadlines. These tasks and deadlines will be posted on ln(exun).  That's all folks --Karan President, I say

       Quite sad and sorry. Before I start with the bad, let me start with the good. The MJKPS Band is excellent, no mistaking. Those little kids play really really well. They played the National Anthem so well that it put some patriotism back in me, and I realised that yes, I did know all the words of the National Anthem, which I was muttering under my breath. For those who don't know, I really am not a very patriotic person, and neither am I religious (I'm practical an atheist, an unbeliever).  My only event today was the last event, so I had to pass my time in the Pandal watching Senior Declamation, which was good, I must say (it was on Outsourcing and how it's evil), but firstly, it wasn't a Declamation as they promised, but it was actually more of a Debate because some people were for, and some were against the motion, and secondly, all of the speakers (save one) missed two big fat important points (which I don't really want to discuss here) and that was just pathetic. Plus, I could see from their speeches that each of them had typed in "Outsourcing" into Google and they were all saying  exactly  the same things and quoting the same figures. That was that.   Senior Quiz  started a bit late, as expected. The quiz-master was an alumnus of the same school and it was obviously his first quiz (either that, or he's generally pathetic) and he was sweating like hell. This quiz even left Mr. Quizzer Outsourcer dazed (but not speechless). To answer each question, one was given a whopping  5 seconds!! For logic questions, 10 seconds. So, basically most teams weren't able to answer. The rapid fire round was 15 seconds each and at max. one could get three or four questions. Let me cut to the chase, we ended up getting second position. The quiz-master first announced us as the winners, then their scoring software coughed up a hair-ball and suddenly put this stupid school ahead of us by three points. With their Ahlconian attitude (long story about Ahlcon Public School... they disqualified us from the overall trophy for some null reason - basically, people who don't listen to reason), they didn't listen of course. I'm also very doubtful about their home-grown scoring software because it had previously added (right in front of the whole audience) 5+5+10 = 10. We didn't have a chance for the Overall anyway because numerous morons (namely: Gursartaj, Dhruv, Abhishek Suri, Abhisheyk Gaur, Manas Gautam, Mohit Taneja, et al) either didn't show up for this event or they didn't win anything (all but the last name are people who didn't show up because of pathetic reasons and they should be lynched in my humble opinion); hence, I chucked it and walked off carrying a 2nd Position trophy, which is extremely pathetic because I think that in a quiz, one should either bag the event or get nothing.  We won  Senior Programming !! I am so happy that SP is working out well because I didn't want Exun to lose its fort&eacute; while I'm in Presidency. I would obviously never want Exun to disregard its crux, but if it ever does, let it not be while I'm, uh,  in power . Mr. Azgez went home carrying two first position trophies from his first symposium, which I consider to be quite commendable.   --Karan Misra President, Exun  We take printouts

        Arrive at Mata Jai Kaur Public School: drum-guy of the marching band wearing the exact same sash as our head boys and head girls - totally ditto, same  chatai  material, colour, knot and everything. This school calls its computer competition Cyberfest (as you would probably have noticed), but wait, its computer club is called WHIZKIDZ. Next, they don't even have an auditorium; we were seated in a  Pandaal , which would be more suited to a  langar  than a computer competition. The chief guest looked like he was the school's peon, with his  chaprasi  clothes and simply horrid grammar. We did ourselves the courtesy of not listening to him, and instead munching on our lunch boxes (in my case, of course, munching on  other  peoples' tiffins).   The first event was Senior Quiz Preliminary Round. I was quite pissed off because it started an hour late, and Bhavya was even more pissed off, because after seeing the question paper, he realised that it was all technical. I managed to get sixteen out of twenty questions  pucca  right, guessed on three and left one.  Result : We got the   first position   in the written preliminaries.  The second event was Linux Programming. I've always thought of myself as a seriously pathetic programmer at computer symposia, who couldn't program even to save his life. That changed today. It was Linux programming of course, which means that there's less of logic and more of "knowledge". You have to "know" the arcane commands in Linux. For example, in normal computer languages like C++ and BASIC, 'if' statements are either if...else, if..then..else, or if...then...else...end if, but in Linux, it's if...then...elif...fi. Sorry to geek you people out, but it simply looks stupid. Here's where we prospered. You see, Mr. Azgez (Exun Programmer 2004-05) agreed to learn these arcane commands and so he did, and with efficiency, over the weekend. Hence, we were the only team to actually type something meaningful on the computer. The logic for all the questions was easy, but we couldn't attempt one question due to knowledge and time restraints.  Result : Came   first    Third event was Extempor&eacute;. I'm really not good at it. I got a topic like "Computers have destroyed writing form and expression." I occupied two minutes of the judges' time and got out.   Result : Nothing  In totality, both the quizzing teams qualified, no one qualified for extempor&eacute;, we bagged Linux but those hapless tenthies and ninethies couldn't win a thing, neither the digital imaging competition (apparently, in which, they  lost  their file) nor in hardware assembly (in which they put in the CD-ROM drive upside down).  --Karan Misra President, Exun

       Ahha! Bloodfist has finally been added to one of the busiest clans in our school... lemme give him a briefing ... Exun has now taken the lead in printing documents, producing perfect jackasses and all other sorts of useless stuff. Nevertheless Exun has been appreciated before . I recently met an alumni of our school who was a commercie. She was the Spokeperson of Exun.. Helped in organizing Exun events once or twice... She had only 1 thing to say : "I had never seen such loyalty of the members in a DPS club.. One comment against the club and all Juniors were ready to Murder you"  That was Exun of 1998. Its 2004 now but Exun has actually deteriorated. We have some of the biggest loonies of our school in Exun now. Exun now entering officialdom is now gonna go down even further. Next year is a 'Big Worry'. We have no suitable successor to presidentship (even this year, one of the presidents is a perfect jackass.No prizes for guessing who it is). What shudders me more is that in 2007 Exun will go into the Hands of (Gulp!!) Gursartaj and Gang.. Then i think the club will be fit for dissolution. Exun scaled many heights but now signs of wear and tear are showing. We need a Fresh Approach .. A new Beginning.. We need to do something or else we might go the Intercrap Club Way  Thanks for Listening to my crap which is nevertheless important

       You were expecting maybe Ben Kingsley??   Yes Ladies and Gents, believe it or not after years of deliberations and months of haggling with exun bureaucracy (our hon'able head of programming), I am finally here.   They have us going to this cyberfest thingy. We need someone for linux programming and up until now, all the presidents are in agreement. We don't have a linux programmer. So if anyone has any secret skills with linux, you will please disclose them now. Better yet, talk to Rungta (you know, the H.O.P.). Oh and Karan, if you read this, why don't you put up who is doing what (who goes for what event)  up here, God knows this blog needs purpose.  --Bloodfist out.

       This log shall have to be make more esoteric as nobody really cares to post on general matters, or at all. Shame on the other President and the other thirty or so members.  In the news, the three of us Exun appointees have to go for the March Past just like the rest of them appointees. I wouldn't really mind doing it, because it's not really something that involves a lot of physical exertion or anything, however, it does require me to miss classes, something that I'm vehemently against. Fortunately, the Investiture Ceremony is now in August (assumably on the day of the Independence Day assembly). We did get our badges. I'll probably scan them or take a photo of them and post it on either this log or my blog. They had the option of choosing from a Rs. 20 and a Rs. 25 badge, they however, went for the Rs. 5 badge or so I like to call it. It's plain bad, and looks CHEAP - made of cloth, golden border, sickly green background and Orange text.  The school has been getting new PCs recently, and I'm glad to say that Mr. Mukesh has finally got a beautiful black HP PC (though crap config, 2.8 GHz and a paltry 248 MB RAM, 8 MB shared with Video). As expected, I knew he'd be sad because he has to run Windows XP now, and like, Windows 98 is the second love of his life. He never fails to tell me (whenever I touch this topic) that Windows 98 gives you full control while Windows XP and all seem to control you. I'd usually tell him that it's a load of bull and that's what I did today as well.  --Karan

       Will you teach me what are message boards and forums.At one time i was the most frequent posters at thinkdigit.com/forums and forums.anandtech.com . Also i am a member at blog.chip-india.com and pchardware.com . If you know people post posts for 2 reasons,they want to help the other person out:tell him waht all above mentioned things are wrong or right and be to the point.Secondly it could be to continue with an incomplete conversation,as time passes it doesn't remain a formal post but a 2-3line amedment and conversation or sometimes even joking and not really that rude as i was with Mohit.

       This Story is from MSNBC.msn.com    The Ultimate Computer   Earlier this week I wrote about the ongoing addition of feature after feature to cell phones-most recently, satellite TV. I suggested we're at the start of a dramatic period of rapid technical evolution, wherein our information and communications devices are going to morph into all kinds of new combinations. One reader commented:   Name: Joe Hometown: Fort Worth When you continue to add all these features to different sorts of devices, I can see everyone in the not-so-distant future carrying their "life" with them in the form of some electronic piece of equipment. Just another thing people will be slaves to.  Exactly right, Joe -- although, I think it's up to us as to whether we're the slaves of these devices, or vice versa.  However, besides cramming next-generation computing and communication into a single personal device, there's another element we need: massive information storage, so we can archive everything we do in life, from e-mail to photos to videos, and have it all available at our fingertips. And that's exactly the direction that Google's one-gigabyte, highly-searchable GMail could take us.  About ten years ago I asked Steve Jobs for his vision of the ultimate computer -- the machine that might be possible midway through the 21st century. He said it would be a flat, tablet-like device that you might get as a child; you'd unwrap it, and, via speech and voice recognition, it would ask your name, where it was and then begin learning everything about you.  You'd carry it everywhere: do your homework on it, store all your books and correspondence, and it would subtly integrate itself into your life. It would ask, for example, where you were going and you'd say, "To my tennis lesson," and it would respond "Would you like me to remind you about your tennis lesson at this time every week?" And then finally, Jobs said, you'd be 17 or 18 years old, sitting on your bed talking to your computer, and you'd mention that you'd just broken up with your girlfriend. And the computer would say, "Steve, it's the third time it's happened that way. You want to talk about it?"  Perhaps that will always be science fiction. But this decade we're seeing the elements of that vision start to come together. Our computers still need to get much smarter, of course, but the ingredients of constant connectivity, massive memory and friendly interface design are on finally on the way, and it's going to be an interesting ride for the next few decades.

        Mohit : Please Stop Torturing Us ; Why do you want to put such a long post , noone can read it + you have used boring Tahr and Tamil Nadu.

       Question 1  The Nilgiri Tahr  The Nilgiri Tahr is a mountain goat that lives in the Nilgiri hills on the border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The tahr lives along steep rock cliffs where grass does not grow easily. The tahr is a very good climber and can balance itself even on the steepest of cliffs. However, since it is a rather short animal, it cannot jump from one rock to another if the difference in height between the rocks is more than one foot. One such tahr finds itself at the top-left corner of an M x N rectangular grid of rocks. There is a clump' of grass at the opposite (bottom-right) corner. The tahr would like to find a way from its current position to the grass. The tahr cannot jump over rocks and can move from a given rock to only one of its four neighbours (left, right, up or down). The tahr must of course always stay within the grid. Further, remember that it can jump only one foot up or down, so it can move from a rock to its neighbour only if the difference in height between the two rocks is at most one foot. Your task is to help the tahr find such a path to the grass, if it exists. If there is more than one valid path for the tahr to follow, it is sufficient to identify anyone path. For example consider the following grid of rocks, where the number at each position in the grid indicates the height of the rock, in feet, at that position.    7	9	8	5  6	3	2	4  5	4	1	5  2	6	1	1  Here is a path that the tahr can follow to reach the grass. The path follows the rocks labelled by the letters (a), (b), ..., (i), in that order.    7 (a)	9	8	5  6 (b)	3 (e)	2 (1)	4  5 (c)	4 (d)	1 (g)	5  2	6	1 (h)	1 (i)  Input format The first line of input contains two integers M and N, specifying the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively, where 1   Output format. 	. If there is no path for the tahr to reach the grass. print out a single line containing thenumber O.  . If there is a path, the first line of output should be the integer 1. After this, you have 	to print out anyone path that the tahr can follow to reach the grass. The path is  1 described by a sequence of lines. Each line should consist of two integers. The integers Xi and Yi printed out on line i indicate that the ith step that the tahr takes should be to row Xi and column Yi. Since the tahr always travels from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid, the first line of the path is always 1 1 and the last line is always M N.  Example Here is sample input and output corresponding to the example discussed above.  Sample input  4  4 7 9 8 5  6 3 2 4 5 4 1 5  2 6 1 1  Sample output  1 1 1  2 1  3 1 3 2 2 2 2 3 3 3  4 3 4 4    Question 2 The Rajah's Wrestlers  Once upon a time, there lived a Rajah who was extremely fond of wrestling. In those days, wrestlers had supernatural powers. To win a match a wrestler relied not only on his own strength but also on a magical ring that he wore while fighting. This ring allowed a wrestler to gain additional strength proportional to the strength of his opponent. The strength of a wrestler and the magical power of his ring are both positive integers. When wrestler A fights wrestler B, the fight index of wrestler A for this match is given by A's own strength plus the strength of wrestler B multiplied by the magical power of A's ring. Each match is won by the wrestler whose fight index is higher for that match. For example, suppose that wrestler A has strength 10 and wears a ring whose magical power is 3 and wrestler B has strength 18 and wears a ring whose magical power is 4. If these two wrestlers fight each other, wrestler A wins. This is because A's fight index for this match is 10 + (3 x 18) = 64 while B's fight index for this match is only 18 + (10 x 4) = 58. On the other hand if A faces a wrestler C with strength 15 and a ring whose magical power is 5, then C wins. In this match, A's fight index is 10 + (3 x 15) = 55 while C's fight index is 15 + (5 x 10) = 65. Similarly, in a match between Band C, C wins. The Rajah organised a wrestling festival once a year. During this festival, each wrestler fought every other wrestler exactly once. At the end of the contest Rajahh honoured all the wrestlers by inviting them to his court and giving them gold coins. It was the job of the Minister to decide the order in which the wrestlers got to meet the Rajah. This was an important task, because our Rajah was rather eccentric. He had declared that the number of coins to be given to a wrestler was determined by the number of matches he won and his position in the sequence: a wrestler was given one gold coin for each match he won and one gold coin for each wrestler whom he defeated but who was ahead of him in.the line to meet the Rajahh. For instance if the Minister had presented the wrestlers A, Band C described above in the order A, B, C to the Rajahh, then A would get 1 gold coin (for the match he won against B), B would get 0 gold coins (since he won no matches) and C would get 4 gold coins (two for his wins against A and B, one because he beat A and A met the Rajah before him and one more since he beat Band B met the Rajah before him). Instead if the minister had presented them in the order C, A, B then C would get 2 coins (for his wins against A and B), A would get 1 coin (for his win against B) and B would get 0 coins.	. The Minister is concerned about the finances of the kingdom. and wants to minimise the number of coins handed out by the Rajah to the wrestlers. Your task is to help the .Minister decide the sequence in which the wrestlers should be presented to the Rajah so that the number of gold coins handed out is minimum. You are provided with the strengths of all the wrestlers and the magical powers of their rings. You may assume that these values are such that no match. results in a tie.  Input format The first line of input is an integer N indicating the number of wrestlers. Each wrestler is identified by a unique number in the range. {1, 2,. . ., N}. The next N lines each contain 2 positive integers. For 1      Output format The output consists of N lines, indicating the sequence in which the wrestlers should meet the Rajah to mini mise the number of gold coins handed out by the Rajah. Thus, each line of output should be an integer between 1 and N and every integer between 1 and N should appear exactly once in the output. If the integer on line i is j, it means that wrestler j is the ith wrestler to meet the Rajah.  Example Here is sample input and output corresponding to the example discussed above.  Sample input  3 103 184 155 Sample output   3 2 1   ps if doees not make any sence it is because of ocr email me and i will email you the jpg's mohittaneja@gmail.com

       I, Srajan and the gamers of the sections of Class 8th entered Computer Lab 6 in the 7th period. We were here for The Domain Square Gaming Competition which was for class 8th. The game to be played was Unreal Tournament. I saw the gleam in their eyes when the game was disclosed. The sections were divided into 2 batches comprising of 6  gamers each were from sections A-F and 6 from G-L. We (me and Srajan)gave them a practice session of 10 minutes and that is the time when we were bombarded with queries and to think Karan Misra entered at that time. But after that the competition went smoothly.   In the first batch (A-F) the gamers played in DM Stalwart map where you had a time limit of 10 minutes and you could kill as many people as you could. The 3 gamers who killed the most were to be selected from each batch for the final round.  The gamers who didn't make the final 3 went back to their classes with a heavy heart but with a smile.  In the second batch(G-L) the gamers were given DM Curse map. We selected 3 gamers again for the finals and said a goodbye to the other gamers after 10 minutes.   Now, call it luck or curse a section of X came for their class i.e. the eigth period(it stretched a little bit as we were giving tutorials to the gamers for playing the game). But everything was in control. The finals were played in the Deck 16 map where the six finalists got 15 minutes of play time where they could slaughter each other as many times they could in the time limit.  The gamers who came out victorious were- 1. Digvijay Singh of VIII-A 2. Aviral Goyal of VIII-G 3. Aman Gupta of VIII-F  It's upto Karan to decide what happens to them. We hope we would see more competitions in the near future. Special thanks to Karan Misra and Mukesh Nagpal and Mukesh Kumar sir for making this event possible.

It is also facing a trial in court for giving so much space i.e. 1 GB. It will most likely win. If gmail runs successfully for 6 months then it can be signed up by everybody. Except the fact of 1Gb MAIL free of cost gmail will also edit ur original messages by giving photos of whatever is written in the mail i.e. if a camera is typed then a colorful picture of a camera will be seen.

       For one I am incapable of making 5 pieces, and well I can't classify the three that I have, ergo these shall be forever be three pieces... Now as for these questions, at a minimum I expect Rungta, Azgez, and "the dormant female programmer in 12th/11th" (taken from somewhere on this blog, probably) to solve these, though if neone else does it, well &amp; good... If neone outside of Exun gets all three done, then well while I can't promise ur inclusion into the club (alumnus, can't really do that), however I can wud recommend that u be taken in, and well my recommendation wud probably work. For lack of time, and effort I haven't put the problems into a more succinct form, so ur gonna have to work around that. So there that gets the preliminaries out of the way.  Now for three simple rules   Contrary to popular belief, I do not have access to a grid or a super-computing facility, so make sure ur code can run in sane amts of time.  Some of these questions r solvable by a single mathematical equation, some by recursion. Now I am  not  a fan of simulations, so if u get the these done without simulating the actual process, then well u get more points in my book, not all that useful, but well u never know...  In code u submit to me, umm pls don't use a void main(), since as of  6 or 7 years ago,  ANSI regulations state that void main() is not a valid main funtion, use int main() instead, and return a value of 1.     The Questions     Throughout this question, the term line and ray are supposed to take on their usual mathematical meanings, which is to say that a line extends infinitely in an infinite two dimensional plane, and a ray starts of at a particular point, but directional extends unto infinity. The question assumes that ur working on an infinite 2d plain. Now the question itself is pretty simple, so there r two parts to it.  a)  Given n (n&gt;2) lines, what is the maximum number of regions u can divide ur 2d plain into?  b)  Now instead of lines if we used two rays at an angle, in a sort of V formation, what is the maximum number of regions with n (n&gt;1) Vs then?   There's a room with n walls (2&lt;n&lt;10), shaped like a regular n sided polygon, with a mirror on each wall. The first wall contains a light source, for which you have a given x coordinate and the angle between the light beam and the wall (horizontal angle, the light beam is so arranged that the beam itself lies on a plane parallel to the floor of the room), and given the x coordinate extents (two coords each) of each mirror, predict the number of reflections that take place before the beam is absorbed. Assume that walls themselves are perfect absorbers of light, as is the light source. Also predict the number of times the rays intersect....   A lil bit of military strategy. Umm well let's have this as a story. Ur in one of those essentially violent central African countries, a part of a rather underfunded UNPKF, and the only possibility of survival rests in understanding rebel attack strategies. Now the rebel army follows some very peculiar rules, for one they always conduct battles with 12 units, and all battles last for 16 hrs. The rebel army is strictly hierarchal, so much so that on the pain of death, each subordinate wud do whatever his superior's unit did and relay his superior's commands to his subordinates immidiately. Unfortunately the rebel army relies on an extremely slow, though highly successful means of communication, and each message takes an hour to relay, which is to say that each subordinate does what his superior did an hour ago. Now given that 1 represents attack, and 0 represents retreat, and given an hour by hour analysis of rebel movements, ur program shud figure out the hierarchy of the rebel army.  Every commander has a minimum of two subordinates.   For instance if the movements read something like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2  1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0  then u shud eventually find the following hierarchy Unit 3 commands Units 7 & 12 Unit 7 commands Units 1, 4 & 5 Unit 5 commands Units 2, 6 & 8 Unit 12 commands units 9, 10 & 11     Neways best of luck doing these, mail me the solutions at  urlLink aurojit@gmail.com , and well I'll test them and get back to u....

         urlLink      Today, Apple has previewed Mac OS X v10.4 codename "Tiger". Many of these features were supposed to be included in Microsoft's next version of Windows codenamed "Longhorn" due in 2007, but unfortunately Microsoft has withdrawn plans for some of the most salient features. To my surprise, Apple has managed to conquer the goal that Microsoft declared as too tough to make it even by 2007 - this was the searchable File System (also known as WinFS). Apple touts its new Search backbone as  urlLink "Spotlight"  and like Expos&eacute; was for Panther, Spotlight will be for Tiger. I shall not mention much more than what you can find out from  urlLink Apple's Tiger Website . However, it should be duly noted that Spotlight will be using metadata as one of its many criteria for searching.     Other important improvements in Tiger are Dashboard and Automator. Do check out Apple's website for more information if you so desire. In other important announcements, the most important is the announcement of a 30" LCD screen by Apple which would run at a resolution of 2560 by 1600 (very very very very big) and would need not only the most powerful graphics card available for the Mac platform but also two DVI connectors instead of one to feed it with the graphical data it so hungers for. Notice that it towers above the Power Mac G5 (which is much bigger than a normal tower PC itself).       --Karan

       I hope all of u are aware of 8 queens problem on the chess board ..   IF NO!!!  8 queens problem is - to place eight queens on a chess board i.e. on a 8x8 matrix in such a way that none of them clash each other.  (those who dont know how to play chess - queen can move in all the directions horizontal/vertical/diagonal)  So, now I am looking forward to a program written in any language - C++/Basic/VB/Pascal to provide all possible places on a chess board where 8 queen's can be placed.    Please do not submit downloaded program (from Web)! Only original entries will be entertained!!

       hi this is udit. we reached darjeeling on the 31st after a long drive ion the rain and fighting with a stupid taxi driver coz he couldn't find our hotel. the hotel turned out to be alright not very great. at least that's what i thought. it turns out they have 1 tv, 1 telephone and don't serve dinner a' la carte. they don't even have cold drinks. we were woken up at 4:00 to go to tiger's hill to see the sunrise but then it was raining and we had to go back to sleep. otherwise, darjeeling's a nice place to be. lots of places to visit. today we went to the zoo (fantastic), the tea gardens again very nice, japanese temple, peace pagoda- the buddha statue was huge, ava art gallery- you gotta see this. this lady has embroidered or painted pictures on velvet silk etc. and they look fantastic. there are plenty of nice places to eat and plenty of cyber cafes and bakeries. they have a huge mall too. everbody has got umbrellas thrice the size of normal ones. that's all for now. if anybody thinks this is pathetic just post a comment. udit

       In my humble opinion, the Class XI Domain Square has been the best-organized and best-performance Domain Square yet. Not only did the players fight each other like pros, but also there was very little chaos even though the computers had loads of viruses, and we did not have to resort to rude language with anybody. Also, just the right number of people showed up and were finished in just one batch.  The game was timed (15 minutes) and the aim was to get the maximum number of frags. In this case, the winner managed to get 63 frags: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Sunny Kumar Aditya (XI-K)    I hope that the Class X Domain Square on Monday will be as successful. Now that I think back, we had almost cancelled today's event this morning because of the profusion of viruses, but we fought back the viruses (quite literally) and prevailed victorious.   Thanks to Souvik Das Gupta, Maanick Nangia, Siddarth Nangia for help in organizing the event,  --Karan  PS: Without critics like Souvik who ask for perfection, we can never improve. Perhaps Souvik's eternal expression of "the sky is falling down - do something!!" just might prove to be useful.

Currently we have only a handful people who have said they're interested in learning PHP, so eGurucool Lab should be the perfect place to have it.  Please post comments regarding any queries and be quick so that we might be able to make appropriate changes.

       The test took place smoothly without any serious system problems. But to be honest, we expected them to do much better. The paper was simple but they made it look difficult, even though the time limit was extended to 2 hrs from 90 mins. Only three people had some clue about the paper. The rest..?? Infact one or two walked out of the test saying that they could figure out nothing. Fine now lets come to the result:     Nikhil Agarwal (XI-H)  : He came first. Had extremely clear logic and solved two questions. Also knows web designing and flash animation. He has been selected.   Swati (XI-I)  : She also has been selected. She managed to figure out the logic of crypting question and almost made the program.   Niharika Mittal (XI-L)  : She almost managed to figure the logic behind Aurojit Panda's question.    Well you can also attempt the paper. You can download it  urlLink here . Do post your comment on the difficulty level of the paper. In case you manage to crack any of it, send it to us by e-mail at  urlLink souvikdg@gmail.com  Please do not post the solution as a comment due to two important reasons. Firstly, because the comment becomes too long and secondly, because some people have been given this paper to try at home.   Schedule for programming test of class VIII-IX has not been finalised. It shall   be posted on logexun whenever it is ready.

       This is quite a simple problem primarily for the newcomers into Exun's programming team (basically for class VIII or below). Vampire numbers are four digit numbers in which the two numbers multiplied are in the product - for example, 15 x 93 = 1395. Write a program, as short as possible, that finds every vampire number.   -Abhijit

       The event for Class IX was an absolute nightmare. Only 5 machines out of 20 were functional because the rest had been devastated by viruses, and kept shutting down spontaneously. I have no idea how we dealt with the 30 or so kids there.  Results anyway: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Shankhayan Dutta (IX-K)   In the wake of virus epidemics, the Class XII event has been moved from Wednesday the 28th to  Wednesday the 4th of August .  --Karan

       A few basic and even advanced (for the well versed) lessons in my mother tongue, PHP.  I have certain obligations uptil this Wednesday, 28th July 2004. From then onwards, I am more or less 'free for academic oppurtunities'.  The time and venue can be decided. Most probably school seems the best fit, you know something like after school, or Barista also works out. Depending on the audience ofcourse.  Preferable if students can bring laptops. Hmm.. I guess this is asking too much.  Anyway, post comments to this post for any more information.  &nbsp;

       No, we didn’t win anything because for winning, there’s this important clause that one must participate in the event, and we missed out on that little clause.  When we reached St. Xavier’s School after a 90-minute drive (and a lot of direction-asking on part of Mr. Goswami), we were told by their teachers that we cannot participate as we did not send our registration by Fax. We knew of this, and hence, two days earlier Hema Jain Ma’am had called up their Head of Operations and informed him of the situation. He had told her that on-the-spot registrations were allowed and that we need not send the form now. However, their teachers there did not care to listen. I called up Hema Ma’am and explained to her what was going on around here; since all their teachers had scurried inside, we got their President to talk to her on the phone.  This person was extremely rude to her on the phone and denied that their members gave any such information to her (outright lying), telling her that she must have misunderstood and that it’s not really his problem.   There was no longer any reason to stay there and talk to these people. I have never seen a school so insolently and disrespectfully treat a guest school, not to mention their teacher. They certainly haven’t heard the “ Mehman Bhagwan ” saying. I would like to request our Principal to ban their school from participating in not only all Exun events this year, but also all DPS events in general (and if Mukesh Sir permits, I’ll write her a letter myself).  I would also like to make a final note that at least three people, namely Sanchit Bhatia, Arjun Agarwala and Shrinjan Khosla had sat and prepared hard for this competition and it was very painful to disappoint them in such a way.

       Is your pocket money not able to keep up with your expenditure? Now here's an idea to utilize your brains for a 'good cause'.  During the summer vacations I got to know about a site acting as an interface between programmers and buyers from around the world. Buyers (reffered to as webmasters on the site) post their projects on this site and programmers (like me) get paid for what we like to do best.  On my first project, I got $90 for a couple of days work. The amount (though quite a sum for me) was very small according to the webmaster I worked with!  The payment method was also very convenient. The site (namely Scriptlance) charged $2 for sending the cheque to my home and $5 as a commission. The commision was not a problem as the webmaster paid it for me!  My project was related to Flash Animation. But there are various other categories of projects that are present such as WebSite Designing, Flash Animation, PHP, Data Entry, Search Engine Optimisation, Content Writing etc. Webmasters post their projects on the site and lots of programmers bid on the project. Then the webmaster chooses the programer he thinks is the best and pays him to do the job.  Winning of the bid is a very important and not so easy&nbsp;task and having your own site is a great advantage (as I found to my expense).  Now to get more details and to start earning straight away all you have to do is to sign up (free)with Scriptlance by following the link given below :&nbsp;    urlLink www.scriptlance.com    The biggest reason for getting quite a good sum for small projects is that most webmasters are of US origin and they count there money in dollars. Even if we get a cool Rs 5000, they see it as just $100!  I don't know how many of you know about freelancing, but I hope that those who don't, don't think that I am joking.   Hoping freelancing won't reduce the involvement of Exun members with the club,   -Abhijit

The best ones will be selected as senior (from class XI) and junior (from class VIII-IX) programmers in Exun. The test will be held after school hours during stay-back. Existing programmers in classes VIII, IX and XI are requested to announce about the test in all the sections. The names of interested candidiates along with their class, section and email address should be given to any one of the following:-  Prateek Rungta (XII-H) Nisheeth Sharma (XII-H) Souvik Das Gupta (XII-I) The details of candidates may also be posted as a comment to this message.

       Can we have an online chatroom exclusively for exun members? It will be great if we could manage that. Exun members online can interact and share ideas with eachother even during holidays. Also online meetings can be conducted. MSN etc. cannot serve this purpose as&nbsp;every one then needs to know eachother's id, include them,allow them....etc.etc.etc. No complications at all, just login and if there are members online start chatting immediately. We can have username and password to control entry into the chatroom. Do comment on this idea, folks.

       Exun has only been taking print outs in school. Don't you people think that we can organize competitions in school. The quizzing club and the debating&nbsp;society have already organized many and I think its time for the computer club to do something. Ofcourse we have the d 2  coming up, but it is not exactly an inter section competition. We have good quizzers, web designers,&nbsp;programmers etc. and can easily make quality questions. So why not hold an intersection event?

       This is in reply to Sir's recent request pertaining to the use of alternate names on exunlog. First off, I have no intention of keeping my name secret, but it must be realised that my blogger account has my name listed as "Azgez" and not Nisheeth and I do not wish to change that. I will therefore, in my  attempt to to comply to the request, sign off as Nisheeth everytime I post anything. Blogger will however, still say that the post was " posted by Azgez".     Sincerely,  Nisheeth.

       Hello all you friends out there. Our more-efficient president has finally invited me to join the blog. It feels really good to be out here. I would like to share an idea&nbsp;in my very first post. Why dont we try to increase the&nbsp;number of members&nbsp;in Exun? After all there is no shortage of talent in&nbsp;our school. We can ask the all the teachers of computer department to give the names of good and talented students to us. We can then hold tests&nbsp;and judge them. The best of the lot can be a member of Exun. Howzzat!!

       Some new information has emerged. Ordinatrix is actually a non-competitive event and though they encourage you to make and bring both web sites and movies for their Web Designing and Movie Making events, they say that even if you don't make and bring, you can go there and learn because they will be calling experts from each field and conducting workshops.    Exun members who are interested in going for Ordinatrix to learn Web Designing or Movie Making, please post your names in the comments.    --Karan

       Hey Guys  Domain Square 2004 will take place next week. As this will be an all-classes event, we need the cooperation of more Exun members. Those who work also get to play, and those who don't will get left out, so sad.  Anyway, we need Representatives for Classes VIII, X, XI and XII. The position of Representative for Class IX has already been filled. In addition, we will have two Representatives for Class VIII instead of one because they will also be incharge of Classes VI and VII.  The job of the Representatives is quite simple. We have posters, and they have to make sure that the Domain Square announcement is made in each section of their respective class.  Domain Square will take place over 6 days starting on Wednesday, 21 st  of July and ending Monday, 2 nd  of August. There will only be one round for each class. Each class from VI to XII will have its individual competition on one day each between 21 July and 2 August. There will be  one  winner from each Class. We will take between 16 and 20 people from each Class on a first come first serve basis.  Announcements will start tomorrow and posters will be posted. The Domain Square website is operational at   urlLink www.exunclan.com/d2  .  After each day of Gaming, Domain Square Reps will have their own LAN gaming party till 3:30 PM (time when buses leave). So hurry up and join as a Rep by posting your name in the comments. Discretion of choosing members for D[2] lies with me.  --Karan

       Not a revolutionary idea, but let me outline it.  I've wanted to learn ASP and PHP - web languages basically - for a long time now, but the books are hundreds of pages thick and I don't have the resolve to open and read them. Similarly, I have read books on topics that others would like to know about but do not have the patience to sit and read them for themselves.  I suggest that when a significant number of Exun members want to learn about a specific topic, they can post a plea on ln(exun) titled "Sessions@Exun:  " and ask other members who also want to learn about the same topic vote in the comments. It would also request any member who is versed in the topic to come forward.  When a knowledgable person comes forward, s/he can be asked to conduct a little class during stayback outlining the topic, giving the basics, and referring to appropriate books and reference material on the Internet. This privilege could be extended to accept non-Exun members into the Sessions who might get interested and want to join Exun.  I would, as I mentioned, like to learn ASP and PHP, and I know a person (namely Maanick) who is versed in the  subject, and I would like it if he conducted a Session on it. And, for example, I've read this book on cryptography, which is very interesting yet is highly repetitive. So I could mash it down and conduct a Session on cryptography.  Please post your comments (votes) on whether you like the idea, or whether it should be dismissed.  I, am, at your service, --Karan Exun We take printouts

       Hello,   urlLink exunclan.com  will be going through a server transition on July 7th 2004, at 9PM IST.  In case anybody is using the current IP to connect to the website, you will require to update your records, or just be smart and use the domain name.  However, no other significant changes will be made. Karan will still be able to leave the current settings for Blogger (i.e. FTP).  An important change however is how email will be handled on the exunclan.com domain. Most exun members are entitled to getting an email address, and can request the names they would like. There is obviously a limit on how many users the system can accomodate, hopefully everybody gets atleast one address.  In an ongoing effort to make Exun members more net savvy (woah!), most of you (if not everyone) will be able to get a personal URL in case you need.  I haven't decided what it'll be, but I'm likely to attend the meeting on the 7th of July to discuss some possibilities.  Just a thought :  urlLink http://members.exunclan.com/~username   Anyhow, Cheers.

       This is your President. Listen up.  There's a competition on the aforementioned date. Here are the details.  They have four events (highly convenient):    Computer Symposium (basically, speaking on a topic)  Quiz  Gaming  Web Designing    Events are taking place starting at 9.30 am and ending at 2.30 pm. One day only, again highly convenient.

If the files that I've posted aren't readable for some reason, leave a note in the comments, I shall clarify doubts. One highly noticeable omission from this event is that of any programming event. I shall say no more. There are more eyes on this log than I'm comfortable with.  Those who wish to participate, please leave a note in the comments (with email address).  Have a good day and best of luck with the exams, --Karan  PS: They've given a contact name and number for clarifications: Mrs. Simmi Kher Ph: 25814084 Email:  urlLink springdalespusa@vsnl.com

       A little head start on the password protected Exun Members Only download area. All download URL's that require to be password protected can be stored in the directory "downloads" in the "logexun" directory on the FTP server.  I understand not everyone has access to the FTP server. But indirectly (through blogger) you guys can upload material into the directory. Just make sure, it's "logexun/downloads" in Blogger.  For example  urlLink http://logexun.exunclan.com/downloads/MYFILE.DOC  (yeah, logexun.exunclan.com works just like exunclan.com/logexun) is not accessible without the password, but after you've supplied a correct password, you're on your way to downloading the file.  A PHP solution to this password protected thing is  urlLink http://logexun.exunclan.com/download.php?url=http://logexun.exunclan.com/downloads/MYFILE.DOC   For those interested, the  urlLink PHP source  is also available.

       Sorry to delay Entrance Test for junior programmers. A logic test will be conducted for students of class VIII on 18 th  August 2004 (Wednesday) during stay back hours. Students who want to give the test may or maynot be familiar to Basic/C++ programming language (though it would be better if they have some knowledge about programming). Students will be tested only on their logical and analytical skills. They wouldnot be asked to write any programs. Exun members of class VIII or IX are requested to announce about this test in all sections of class VIII.

       If you've been keeping up with Windows Longhorn or Mac OS X, you will see that ever since Apple released OS X in 2001, both companies have been trying to make their operating systems look "prettier". Although Apple completely rewrote the millions of lines of code comprising the Mac OS from scratch for version 10, I think that both Apple and Microsoft have moved in a terribly wrong direction.   urlLink    Mac OS X  To a certain extent Mac OS X's interface is very good indeed. For example, the buttons for closing, maximizing and minimizing a window are marked with distinct colours. Also, Exposé along with anti-aliasing make Mac OS X a really sweet sight. Now many of you may disagree with me on this, but I find two very basic things in Mac OS X to be fatally flawed:      The Dock     Minimizing and Maximizing    By default the dock is at the bottom of the screen where it takes up more than 1/10th of the screen, and that vertical space becomes completely unusable. Secondly, the bouncing action of the icons (by default, it can be changed) when an application starts is really kiddish and one gets fed up of it pretty soon. Minimizing: firstly, all software don't support the standard Apple-M keyboard shortcut for it (for example, FireFox doesn't) and secondly, once you send a window into the Dock, there's no way of maximizing it again with a keyboard shortcut. This is, in a word - bugging. These are not all of the GUI troubles with Mac OS X, there are many more, but these tend to bug you a lot in regular everyday use.   urlLink    Windows  There's no point in arguing that Windows XP wasn't  inspired  by Mac OS X, because it definitely was. I have no qualms with the Windows interface. In fact, I happen to believe it as being one of the most well-designed and most accessible user interfaces, beating Mac OS (elegant though it may be) and Linux (really not a challenge) in many many areas. When I see the Windows UI, the word that comes to my mind is "efficient" - this is the UI you want to work on, compared to the word "cool" that comes to my mind when I think of Mac OS X. Windows XP was supposed to look cool; however, I think that if you ever get around to doing serious work on XP, you almost always switch back to the Classic (Windows 95 to 2000) look, simply because it's just more efficient, and those jazzy animations, shadows and transparency really don't help at all.   urlLink    Mac OS 9  "Ultrafast, Efficient" come to my mind. The OS 9 (or Classic) GUI beats the Mac OS X, Windows and Linux GUI in every area. It is  the  most usable thing on this planet. In fact, it's always been a major reason for the fact that Macs were used extensively in graphics and video development (Intel's ads were until recently made on Macs). Not only that, but with all its efficiency, it's also much better, more space saving and easier to use than the current Windows or Mac OS X GUI. If somebody could just slap the Classic GUI on top of Windows or Mac OS X, I would be the happiest person on this planet.  --Karan

       Seeing that you guys cracked the first code pretty easily, I'm giving a second code, obviously difficult than the previous one. I found it quite difficult to crack but I don't know about the rest of you.  The following scriptures were actually found in the diary of a 16th century englishman. You have to decode this. It decrypts (obviously) into English.     Frankly speaking I wasen't able to decrypt it without looking at the hint. Mail me at  urlLink abhijit89@gmail.com  for a big hint  Best of Luck! Hopefully you'll find this more time consuming than the previous one.  PS: Please don't check up the solutions from anywhere. Also please don't mail solutions on the blog.

       Techedge was at Birla Vidya Niketan on 3 August , the round I was pretty simple, but the second question for round II involved GRAPHICS for which we required the "help file".I apologise for posting the questions so late, and thanx Souvik for ur help.the questions are : Round I Question 1: Make a program which sort a 2D matrix according to the following example    9          1            4            2                             1            2            3            4 11        10            16            8                           5            6            7            8 5          12            17            15            à            9            10            11            12 6          3            13            14                          13            14            15            16 Question 2: Write a menu driven program for encrypting, decrypting and splitting files. Round II Question 1: Write a program to make an asterisks bounce on the screen such that it moves with variable velocity. The asterisks should increase velocity on hitting the edges. Also the initial acceleration and initial velocity should be user input. Question 2: Make an analog clock with least count=1 second(using graphics complete with hour hand, minutes hand and the seconds hand)

       This cipher uses a  common key for encryption and decryption  which is kept secret and is known to only the sender and reciever of the message.  The following is the cipher text encrypted using the key "vigilance" "hmkb xe bp xpmylly rxiiqto lt fgzzv" This when decrypted reads "meet me on tuesday evening at seven"  So the challenge is to decrypt the following text which has also been encrypted using the key "vigilance" "opoa nicjim qy kllygh vtvplbrv gdxnmc aaf ava sioe oa pzeoa naeqp"  Best of Luck!

       Hello,  Once again. I invite you to another session of PHP. As usual everybody is welcome ... but with a few prerequisites : simple programming knowledge + basic PHP syntax which we covered last time in the session.   urlLink Sessions@Exun Website  has a slightly more refined version of the above text.  The tentative date is 13th August, this coming friday. We'll work with time conflicts, but this day seems perfect. Let's stick to it if we can.  The scheduled time is 1PM. We'd like to wrap up early, so we start early.  However, comment to tell us your problems.  Thanks, Mukul  P.S. - string Advanced; Advanced = "Basic PHP ... beyond syntax";

       This is an appeal from the junior coordinator of EXUN It has come to my notice that several exun members loiter around in the eGurucool Lab without any reason I would like to request these people to please not to waste time in the lab unless you have a reason or if u have been called. Also, I would also like to ask the president to look into the matter and see what best can be done This entry specially refers to the juniors i.e. 9thies and 8thies who are constantly seen in the lab when they have any free period

       I don't know the programming results yet, but we won the Quiz, came third in Crossword and Web Designing and second in Gaming. I will be posting all the Quiz finals questions but first...   Intersection Quiz for Class X   Exun has to organize an Intersection Computer Quiz for Class X next week, this week is preparing time. Now, the Class X Exun members (according to Manisha Ma'am and Mukesh Sir) cannot take part because they are the ones who will be organizing the Quiz. So, right now these are: Gursartaj Singh, Dhruv Kumar, Abhishek Suri and Mohit Taneja. Abhisheyk Gaur, Karan Misra (me) and Maanick Nangia will help in making the questions for this event. Manas Gautam (IX) has agreed to help in the organization of the quiz.  So, let's see, this week is preparing time, and next to next week we have to do the Quiz on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Tomorrow, we shall prepare the plan of action. Members whose names have been mentioned please take note and meet in the eGurucool Lab in the Break tomorrow.  --Karan

       Today was the big day, The Columban Open Quiz Finals. The Columban Open Quiz, this year for us , had been great. In the prelims,we came first, thanks to some computer related questions which came , which Karan had earlier asked me. In The quarters and the semis, we had the same result,1st. We had obviously shocked everyone, as no one had expected a team like ours(comprising of me, Ishaan, Aakash,Akshat), to reach the finals with a continuous winning streak.But today , disappointed befalled on us , as we couldn't even manage to get in the first three.We came fifth, ahead of Bhavya's team but behind 'DADA KI ARMY' , another DPS RKP team, which came 2nd. But I think it was quite a good experience, as I am quite young and reached so far ,and I encourage EXUN members to particiapte in this quiz as it consists of many many computer related questions, ought to come in Computer Quizzes.eg:- We were asked ' Which country's domain name is .ch' and '.pt' and what does Error 405 signify etc.

       This is not just another proposed logo. In fact I think its good not(only) because I made it, but because ..... it is appealing and exun-type. Check it out.     Now ofcourse the logo will not be in black and white. I want you to suggest the color of the logo.    Note: If you like it, comment on it. If you dont, suggest changes, I can also give you the .psd file. And if you think that you can do a better job - DO IT.

       Technologists ("computer people") like to use this word 'powerful' in peculiar ways. Compared to BASIC, C++ is more powerful and compared to a 266 MHz computer, a 2.66 GHz computer is more powerful. Today, I say: PHP is not simply powerful, PHP is Power (with a capital P that is).  Mukul used to talk about PHP a lot, how he loved programming in PHP and how it was so generally fantastic. I never really understood. After all, I said to myself, it's a programming language... what can be so great about a programming language? Today I found out. PHP is the most flexible language I have ever seen (I have not seen much, but still). 'Flexible' is just the right word, because you will find the same power in C++ as well. Of course then C++ is not used as a Server Side Scripting language, so you can't make a fair comparison. I won't explain here how it's flexible because that's what the Session@Exun was about.  Mukul was disappointed that he did not get much done, and didn't really go into the 'good stuff', but we all (me and some friends) expected this, especially because not everyone there knew C++ (which would have meant easily skipping about half the topics we went through). The small gathering was an enthusiastic one, many doubts were asked and all were answered. It could be easily seen that everyone thoroughly enjoyed the Session as a) no one wanted to leave and b) those who had to leave 20 minutes early begged to stop the class and continue it some other time.  If Mukul finds free time next week, we can arrange a second Session in which perhaps we can apply some of the power of PHP. However, if there is to be a next Session, Mukul has advised that everyone should know about PHP syntax, so that that does not have to be explained [again]. If there is another Session, information will be posted on this blog.  --Karan

       It's no secret that a lot of people have been trying to get into Exun these past few days because of an unexplained surge in publicity. We've decided that we will state in a lucid manner what we are looking for and what we are not looking for. This log entry shall get a permanent link on the sidebar so that we can easily point people to it. Let me get to the point now.  We want members in the following categories:      Senior Quizzing (Class X to XII)     Debating, Declamation & Group Discussion (Public Speaking - Class IX to XII)     Software Display (Programmers in VC++, VB  who have made some kind of software )     Junior Programming (Class VI to VIII, knowledge of QBASIC)     Senior Programming (Class X to XII) applicants   please read:  We have many good senior programmers in Exun already and quite frankly we're saturated at the moment. Our priority right now is to send the existing programmers for events and competitions. Taking new programmers at this stage will do nobody any good. You may still apply for Senior Programming but be assured that unless you're really brilliant, your chances of getting in are low.   Junior Programming  Since QBASIC is no longer taught at Class VIII level (instead Visual Basic is taught), the Programming Department of Exun is planning to conduct a Logic Test for Class VIII very soon, from which promising students will be trained in QBASIC.   Software Display  Students who have made software in Visual Basic or Visual C++ (any software with a GUI) are invited to come and show their software to us (see below). We're looking for good software that can be sent for Software Display competitions.   Senior Quizzing  The toughest amongst them all. Hop along if you think you know about computers and we'll test you (see below).    Other categories  are:      Digital Imaging     Flash Animation     Web Designing    For these three, students are expected to bring a piece (or pieces) of original work and show it to us. We can judge you then. Again, see below.   See belows  Wherever See Below has been mentioned: Exun members are present in the eGurucool Lab (F-Block) during Break time everyday. Look for the Presidents (Maanick Nangia or Karan Misra) and if you can't find them, try to locate Mr. Mukesh Kumar. You can also email at  urlLink exunclan@gmail.com  or comment on this post if you have any queries (or if I forgot to mention something).  --Karan

       Hello,  This is to let people know of an artificial intelligent bot that runs on MSN, and talks to people.  OSI (initially) meant - Online Status Indicator. I undertook the project about a week ago, when something Aurojit Panda said, sparked my interest in making this bot. It has gone beyond reporting status for people who have added OSI to their contact lists.  It now uses the ALICE engine to generate AI responses over the MSN network. Feel free to add her to your list.  The MSN id is "osibot@hotmail.com", minus the quotes ofcourse. You can enjoy OSI's benefits as soon as you add it to your contact list!  Enjoy.

       linux has tux pixar has luxo GNU has a gnome  exun should have something too!!!  i mean, i think its a cool idea  to have a little exun mascot , doesnt has to be something real .. could be anything, uhmm.. nice!  i stumbled upon the idea while collecting some fonts from  urlLink www.1001fonts.com  the font is called creatures , though it has been discussed earlier in my batch with the very obvious conclusion that exun mascot HAS to be a panda...*ahem*  anyways coming back to the font, it has a collection of cartoon-type-little-critters for every alphabet...kinda cute..maybe we could have one of em ... otherwise there's always the mystical legendary drooling panda ;-)

       The competition took place on 2nd August 2004 and 27 people took part.  The winner, with any ado, was: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Varun Vasudevan (X-B)   Since Gursartaj has already detailed on the topic, I shall say not much. There were two Preliminary Rounds and one Final Round. A few Class X Exun Members also took part, but they weren't much good at gaming, to be honest. Hence the need for these competitions.  --Karan

       We participated in only three events out of a total of five as we neither had a participant for Group Discussion nor a software to submit for software Display. The events which we did participate in were Gaming, Web Designing and Senior Programming. Souvik could not make through the qualifiers of the Gaming event due to keyboard problems. The game was Unreal Tournament and the frag limit was just 10.  Vansh and Rasagya were declared third in the Web Designing event. Swati and myself won the Senior Programming. We did not think we could have won the programming event as the last (fourth) question we had to do was to make an analog clock with the hour, minute and seconds hand. The clock had to work i.e. show the time. Neither of us (me and Swati) had any idea about graphics in C++, but with the C++ help file we were able to make a pretty nice clock which worked! As we were the only ones who had got all the questions right, we won. I don't think there was a trophy for the overall winning school.

Project Billboard is still alive but due to some really ineffecient senior programmers(seems they are following my example) , the project is stalled... All those who have any knowledge of ASP.. Contact me . You might just be a part of one of the most successful ventures of Exun after Exun (The Event) and DomainSquare  Zzzzzzzzz....

       Hello Fellow exunites. this is an unofficial post on Domain Square-2nd aug I do not know who the winner was. I dont even know who cleared the first round. But i have found out that we have a new computer teacher, Mr. Ankit Wadhwa. well i shall tell u how. well u see that we had the domain square competition for class 10 today and who wouldn't like to fire a few rounds? so we had this extremely irritating guy, who is also in my class, wanting to play games. He asks Ankit, the one who hath the 6600, if he can play or not and Ankit allows. We received certain complaints that somebody is playing without registering, looking into the matter we found out that it was that same person. On being interrogated he replies that he has asked the teacher. WHICH TEACHER???????? answer: Mr. Ankit Wadhwa, who was happily chatting on his phone a few minutes later. I hope Karan posts an official entry on Domain Square thank you

       Did you know that Intel EEs(Extreme Edition) are based on the Galatin core , that is,they are Xeons in the disguise of P4s. Also,they have 2mb l3 cache,512kb l2 cache , so that accounts to 2.5mb cache(we all know that intel cpus don't have much l1 cache,so that is neglible).  Amd officially announced that the prices of the amd athlon xp will be raised from 10-30% depending upon the model and the prices of the amd 64 to go down by the same , globally.

        OK, rescheduling again, this time because of dear old  urlLink TechEdge . So, we have two tentative dates now, which are  Thursday the 5th and Friday the 6th (same time : 1.30pm) . I would like comments from the people who want to attend so that we can decide on the most favourable date.  A recap for those who haven't read about  urlLink Sessions@Exun  or more specifically  urlLink PHP . The idea of Sessions@Exun was conceived so that interested people may learn a specific skill in computers from people who have already learnt that skill and are experienced in it. This helps because reading big, fat books is tedious and sometimes if the book is technical, then confusing as well. Teachers are always better than books anyway.  More specifically  PHP  ( P HP:  H ypertext  P reprocessor) is an HTML-embedded scripting language, which means that it is used for serving dynamic content on web pages, just like ASP. The only difference (usage-wise) between ASP and PHP is that ASP is a Microsoft product and needs a Windows Server to run on while PHP is Open Source and can run on any OS. And since Linux is being more widely deployed these days, it makes more sense to learn PHP if you're doing Server-Side Scripting. I am told that PHP is tougher than ASP, but since I have no knowledge of PHP (I'm counting on this Session myself), I can't say anything about that.   About  Mukul : Many people have asked me who Mukul is, so let me introduce him. Mukul is an Exun alumnus, currently studying at Iowa State University (US). He is here in Delhi for his summer break and has found time to give us an introduction to PHP, which he says is his mother tongue.  Please comment away people. We want to know who's coming and what day is more favourable - Thursday or Friday.  --Karan  PS: Any student of DPS RK Puram can attend, not just Exun members.
