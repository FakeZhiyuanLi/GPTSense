        Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile     And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved She will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved  Please don't try so hard to say goodbye         -- She Will be Loved (Maroon 5)        . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    How many times have I told him that if he wants to, he can come by anytime he wants. My door's always open. He even has the key, for God's sake.

      I have never been good at writing things down. All through the day, thoughts freely weave in and out of my head but once I set myself in front of the PC and begin to type, I find myself mentally tongue-tied, wondering if the words I put out there are interesting enough. Here I am, thinking I have an okay kind of life but after reading what I have written, I get the feeling that my life is bland and uninteresting after all. Nothing exciting seems to be happening. After days of not having anything good to write about, I wonder if I'm in a rut. I am now faced with a choice of writing about nothing or doing something just to have something to write about. Either way, it isn't good.

      Today was not a good day. To start off, my mom told me she doesn't like going out with me coz I get mad at her easily daw. She'd rather hire someone to go shopping with her than go with me. It came as a surprise to me coz here I was, thinking everything was okay between us and then ... So I cried. Which I really hate doing coz my eyes would get all red and puffy and my face would be all splotchy. And I really really had an important appointment today. I couldn't just leave with splotchiness and all so I had to wash my face with ice-cold water for a few minutes. Needless to say, I was late for the appointment.  Later, while shopping at SM, I saw bJ with a girl. They were sweet together. To quote Avril Lavigne, "so much for my happy ending"...

      She wiped my tears when I was a child and loved me more than life itself. I saw her as a strong and independent woman who gave me wings and taught me how to fly. Today, she is my dearest and truest friend. She encouraged my dreams, applauded my accomplishments, understood my shortcomings. She has always been so proud of me, inspite of what I cannot do. She's my mom and I'm so proud of her, too.  Happy Birthday, Mommy! I love you.

      My friends and I had our rare lunch-together at MaiTai's house. Between bites of lasagna and grilled pork belly, we were catching up on each other's lives. It seems as if we've come so far from being the little shrimps we were way back in grade school. Mai, who always had ambitions of being a writer, is now a pediatrician. Dewdrop wanted to be a surgeon. Now she's married and heads the family business. No matter how much you try to plan your life, things always go a certain way. It's as if everything is predetermined.  Just when things were getting on the serious side, the rain came. Not in drizzles but a heavy downpour. We were all looking at the rain outside, thinking how nice it would be to play in the rain like little kids. To forget about the problems we, as grownups, have to face everyday. To not have to make life-altering choices and decisions. To go back to that point in our lives when all we had to think about was whether to go out and play in the rain or not.  We looked at one another. Maybe we were stressed out, or maybe we just wanted to have some fun. Whatever the reason, one by one, we stood and hurried out onto the driveway and got soaked. We were drenched to the bone but we were laughing.  We just stood there, palms up, enjoying the rain. In that shared moment, we let the rain wash away our problems and it felt good. For that moment, anyway, we were free.

         Magic must lie in the attempt to understand another person; the answer to relationships must be in that attempt.      In the movie, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is an American who went to Spain intending to stay with his girlfriend only to find she's dumped him for someone else. The movie opens with him on a train to Vienna to catch a plane back to the States at dawn the next day. By chance, he meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a French woman his own age. Somewhat shyly attracted, they start talking about whatever comes into their minds and when he gets off in Vienna, he persuades her to join him.  Consisting of little more than a long stroll and stimulating, intelligent, flirtatous and frank conversations about everyday get-to-know-you topics like parents, love, sex, childhood, life, death (and the meanings of such things), the film couldn't be simpler -- or more absorbing. They walk about scenic Vienna, get to know each other, and fall more and more in love.  One of my favorite scenes was when they encounter a disheveled man by the river; he seems to be homeless, but he's obviously not just a common bum -- because in exchange for a little money, he offers to write them a poem including a word they give him. ("Milkshake") When they return later, they're both surprised when his poem turns out to be quite good. Jesse assumes that the street poet already had a poem ready into which he inserted their word. Celine doesn't care; she loves the idea itself.  Jesse, though, is generally more naive than Celine; he's extremely open and unguarded, perhaps more than a little on the rebound from his collapsed relationship. However, he's over-cautious about being suckered by those they meet. Celine is more sophisticated, but she's willing to go along with the predictions of the psychic they meet, and with the poem the street poet writes for them. It's not that she believes the psychic, it's that it's more entertaining, more touching, more romantic to play along with the predictions.  The ending doesn't say whether they meet again or not. The whole story occurs within 14 hours after all. It's basically a simple, honest movie and its lowkey way of unfolding makes it deeply romantic yet still believable. I just love the beauty of open-ended stories. It gives you hope, somehow.

      Working part-time at the gym and managing my own business, my days are flexible. In that sense, I can pretty much do as I want and it's easy for me to rearrange my schedule around him. He's busy with his business and it's difficult for him to find some free time but he's been making the effort to be with me, and I appreciate that.
