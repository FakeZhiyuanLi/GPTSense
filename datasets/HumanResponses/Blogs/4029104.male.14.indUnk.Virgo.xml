      " Out of order, I show you out of order. You don't know what out of order is, Mr. Trask. I'd show you, but I'm too old, I'm too tired, I'm too  f**kin' blind . If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a  FLAMETHROWER  to this place! Out of order? Who the hell do you think you're talkin' to? I've been around, you know? There was a time I could see. And I have seen. Boys like these, younger than these, their arms torn out, their legs ripped off. But there isn't nothin' like the sight of an amputated spirit.  There is no prosthetic for that . You think you're merely sending this splendid foot soldier back home to Oregon with his tail between his legs, but I say you are executin' his soul! " -  Liutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino),   Scent Of A Woman , during the trial of Charlie (Chris 'O Donnell) in university for something he didn't do. Guilty meant the loss of his scholarship.   *Nothing interesting happened today, so I just wanted to share this quote from one of my most favourite films of all time. ;) By the way, has anyone watched this film?

      Honestly, I just created this blog at Blogspot so that it would be more "public" than compared to my  urlLink tabulas  one... whether most of the time, only tabulas users would actually bother to even read what I'm posting. :) This one won't have&nbsp;a proper design.... I'll just use the defaults given. For now, at least. Anyway, here's my first post... taken from my tabulas. Heheh.  ----  I'd written a song last week... out of frustration, actually. here it is:   Nevermind  [1st Verse] I feel so cheated so hurt inside I'm  so sick  of you and all your lies I forgave you once and forgave you twice I trusted you too much Gotta pay the price.  [Chorus] Why can't I just step out of these lines Why have my heart's eyes turn so blind You've betrayed my trust for countless times and all I do is turn my back and cry nevermind.  [2nd Verse] You look at me You say you're sorry But just  keep that mouth shut  if you don't mean it. I forgave you once and forgave you twice Guess I trusted you too much well I'm paying the price  [Bridge]I &nbsp;don't want to hearyour  shit anymore  Cos I don't knowwhat the hell it's for I'll only show youthe way out the door Cos your apology is not what I am looking for.  [Chorus] Why can't I just step out of these lines.Why have I...  turn so blind.     -------  I wrote it after I found out some shit about one of my supposed friends... then I got so pissed because I realised that sometimes I tend to forgive people a bit too much that they take advantage of it. It's happened so many times already... I just don't learn my lesson, do I? Sigh... sometimes I really don't know why I just feel that I should help people, even though I know that they don't even appreciate it. :S   This life is funny.
