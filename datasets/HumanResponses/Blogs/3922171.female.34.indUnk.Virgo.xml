             to be six years old   and unable to dream   to only be able to remember   but never to project hopes and wishes   to live in a wonderful world of makebelieve   while awake   for sleep brings only   night terrors and heartache   to never be able to reach that wonderland of dreams   to skip through meadows   to swing higher and higher on the swing   giggling as your daddy pushes you higher and higher   to imagine bouncing off of clouds made of candy   and soaring high as you see yourself flying   to meet everyone in the&nbsp;perfect light   no fighting or yelling   or hurting   to be six and to never have dreamed   that is a sin

             i give up   nothing i can say or do   will impact    our relationship   i feel like yelling   from the highest peak   please hear me   please listen   i notice my voice    travels around his head   without ever entering his ears   i can repeat myself over and over   two feet from him   and he doesnt hear me   he will see the tears in my eyes   and never see that he caused them   he will cause my heart to break    and just step over the pieces   he will sleep and play   and never offer to lift a finger to help   he will sit and stare   at the television   but only takes notice of me   when i am naked   i am nothing to him   but a pair of tits   and a pussy   he doesnt know me   doesnt see me   doesnt hear me   i see him   i hear him   i know him   i want him to at least attempt   to know me   to hear the things on my mind   to see the things that touch my heart   i am nothing to him   and he is everything to me   i give up   i cant reach him   i give up   i am done

      how can i love him so much and hate him a tenth of a second later i want to strangle him  and watch his eyes bug out and then i want to hold him and snuggle up close he infuriates me  i feel the blood start to boil within i long to connect with him like we used to what happened to us three kids new job weight gain weight loss new friends old problems i want my life back how it used to be when he was there for me when his homecoming elicited a smile now we hide from each other in the same house we are roommates who fuck basically we just happen to be married and are parents to the same children the emptiness between us is vast communication is non-existent it hurts deep down in my soul i wait with bated breath to tell him things he cant hear me or doesnt want to what do i do i try and fail and try something else i am drowning in loneliness and grief do i love him hate him or even care

      there is a place not far from here where the only walls are the ones within people where new beginnings take place and old friends are seen where the sound of laughing children echoes all around a place where strangers smile when you walk by and even if they are paid to be nice you don't care because it just feels good to be around  happy people the air is cleaner you come home so tired yet refreshed as if god himself breathed new life into you you are free to be exactly who you are you don't have to expose your weaknesses but you are free to if you so desire you walk around and notice that this place is so inviting the butterflies seem to dance as they travel from each flower as if they know that this place is the only place they want to be the stars at night seem to shout your name bringing a sense of calm to your soul the moon in its brilliance beckons you to savor each second that you spend in this piece of heaven when you leave all you want to do is run back to the safety of innocence to the calling of truth to the friendly people who greet you with smiles on their faces and love in their hearts but that is not your reality for one week of the year you make the trek the rest of the time you are stuck here in oblivion away from that one place you'd rather be
