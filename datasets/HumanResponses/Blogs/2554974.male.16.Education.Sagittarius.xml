      ----------------------------------------   Hell Day!  --------------------- Diz morning i woke up at 0640! It would be my first ncc training after my promotion 2 a CLT. I came down with e company of fairul, yasir and hafizuddin. It was fun.. i think. E attendance as usual was horrible. We juz laid some ground rules for them that we tot was needed as e standard was steeping down. Fairul was bothering us with his date later on with hamizah but in e end hamizah came down 2! ahha.. well.. it was fun we did an average PT and den on 2 e GAMES!! We CLTs drawed with e SSCs! It would have been a real shame if we had lost man! haa.. Den as usual e drills where hamizah showed us some slapping skills!! haha!! well.. after training we went on 2 banquet after being joined by alfiyan, izzat and dadly. Surprisingly, we met Nuh dere!! ahah.. den we told him abt e outing later on Monday 2 bigsplash! Erm.. still haven't contact all e 46th malays yet. Will do dat 2nite. Hamizah had 2 get home b4 4, so fairul seperated from us for a while. Den we hanged out at bedok reservoir with 2 guitars and a deck of cards. We sat nbear e fitness corner and played ard wif e pull up bars dere and watched pple playing takraw and jogging and doing pull ups.. ahaha. kinda fun.. Erm.. well.. den talked on e phone wif hayati and talked crap abt our voicemails! haha.. btw yati.. urs is nice. But passed e phone on 2 alfi coz he wanted 2 have a chat wif yati. I was abit jealous lah.. he talked like abt 30mins. I den took my guitar and went outside our shelter and played 2 myself. I noe i shudn't be feeling all diz.. but i juz do. Coz diz is my blog, all dat i feel will be noted down. Well.. kinda pissed wif alfi coz he din even bother 2 pass e fone 2 me. In e end my fone batt. left 2 bars and yati had hanged up. Gosh.. den juz played a tune and sang wif my most horrid voice. After a while we got bored and all of us left. Still feeling abit pissed.. but yeah.. mayb its juz me. Sorry alfi..

So wad if i say sorry.. i'm a jerk 2 start wif rite. I noe and understand dat she has 2 go thru diz shit and its not on her own choice, but i also noe dat pple are expecting a gd design. But if u tink u can do a good job.. den fyne.. If u tink i can't help den fyne.. if u tink u can do it alone n please all.. den fyne.. It would be better if dere was a committee hu was doing it.. but no.. a person can do it alone.. so fyne...

She muz be street-smart and versatille. She is of high intellectual and has a good platform of vocabulary. She muz be interersting and sporty. I muz not be able 2 see thru her or break her easily. She is tough mentally and has a very strong standing abt her principles. She muz be loyal and not e kind hu is a player.

      ----------------------------------------   Sad Story   ---------------------  Today had a discission wif twiggy. He said dat i'm now much closer wif my ncc clts. So much so dat its better for me 2 juz go wif dem. Any ncc clts hu hangs out wif me would noe dat i talk abt my band like all e tyme. Even 2 fairul's brother. Even he noes abt Omen dolls. Even talked 2 him abt recording and gigs and how 2 improve e band. Spent half my savings 2 make e omen dolls polo t-shirt. Spent alot of tyme trying 2 improve my guitar skills. Spent so much tyme trying 2 get 2 noe more abt punks and all other music concepts. But hu cares rite, i'm ncc onli rite. I'm not even a good guitarist. I'm not even a gd musician. Ncc made me diz way rite? So juz leave me out lah k. I'm juz ncc rite. I'm nothing 2 omen dolls rite. I'm juz shit rite. I'm juz a sensitive faggot rite. i shud juz be better off wif my ncc clts rite? so be it!

      ----------------------------------------  Back From CO! --------------------- I was delighted by e response of e Sec 1 students of Junyuan Secondary School 2 NCC. It was seen as e best CCA to most of dem. I juz hope they dun regret joining e CCA later on. My small sis was dere 2. She was damn irritating.. toking and toking and toking as if her only goal was 2 irritate me. Errgghh! Den I went 2 Pasir Ris Sec. Met up wif Yasir, Hafizuddin, Faiz, Fairul and Hamizah dere. After helping out abit by talking 2 e sec 1 students we left. Our early departure was due 2 one reason. CLT Sulaiman of Pasir Ris Sec. He said dat he did not need our help and it was strict orders from e CO. Well.. The CO wasn't dere in sch, and the other officers were fine with it. I was sooo pissed off man. We went dere on e onli basis 2 help out and diz is e appreciation we get. I was so mad dat i went straight 2 e pull up bars and began doing pull ups.  We den went off 2 TM. Met up wif alot of old pals from NCC and ex-secondary sch. We den went on a tiring journey ard dat area. Dragging ourselfs 2 carry on. After a while it got realli boring and we went off 2 e Library 2 mit Fadzilla. She was bz studying wif her friend, so we Yasir cudn't interact wif her alot. Well.. borrowed some books and talked 2 her abit den we were off again! Now 2 e interchange 2 get home. While waiting for e bus wif yasir, we bumbed into Yati. She was wif a guy. As soon as i saw her, my face changed. I dunno why. I was suddenly emotional. I juz kept quiet, afraid dat i would say sumtink wrong. I juz gave e reason dat i was tired so dat she wun worry 2 much. I'm too into her now. Its either i give it up and get less hurt or go all e way and get deeply hurt again like wif haswani, which took me 4yrs 2 get over. I'm confused. I told myself not 2 like anybody anymore but i'm doing it again. Well.. dun worry abt me. I'll be fine.

      ----------------------------------------  Early Morning.  --------------------- The first thought i got this morning when i woke up was, SMS yati. Wads happening 2 me... But i didn't of coz. She got sch, so i dun wanna disturb her. I realli dunno wat 2 do. I am aware dat she has a guy already, but.. i dunno.. She's kinda diff. She sticks 2 my mind. She's sumone hum i can have an intellectual tok wif. Sumone i can share my problems wif and actually give a damn abt how i feel. Sumtimes she's so sarcastic and bitchy dat i get worked up, but it only lasts for a while and she noes when i'm not alright and bothers 2 ask. I dunno.. she juz gives me dat warm feeling when i'm near her. Well.. OK.. 2dae's plan is 2 go 2 my ex sec sch after friday prayers and helpout wif e cca orientation prep. Meeting fairul, alfiyan. izzat and yasir first. After dat mayb dinner and Home sweet home!

Coz wif yati, u dunno wads gonna happen! haha.. Well.. so she was like sarcastic at first.. but later she simmered down. We went 2 watch diz movie, Bollywood Queen. Proceeding on e 2 cinema, she tugged on my sweater. Dat made me feel a lot more relaxed, coz dere was sumone 2 guide and hold me. Haha.. i so find e story lack of an original story line. Kinda boring actually, coz u can predict wads going 2 happen next. She was like entertaining me and talking and trying 2 keep me awake. Haha.. kinda cute actually. I kept looking at her when she narrates e movie 2 me. Den i got my ear pinched and my face pushed coz looked at her 2 long.. Haha.. Well.. but it was worth it. I den felt more comfortable wif her and her friends.  Ok getting boring reading diz rite? Haha.. ok i'll cut it short. Erm.. went 2 have dinner den, at Kmpg Chai Chee restaurant. Well.. dere, we talked and joked ard. I was feeling more like one of dem. Well.. one thing dat i noticed when i'm wif yati, i dun get e lust feeling.

      ----------------------------------------  My Dream.  --------------------- 2dae I had a dream abt my mother. While i was having fun at Shariffah's place, my uncle called me. He announced dat my mother just died. I was filled with anguish. Tears started trickling down. Visions of her started flashing through my mind. Visions of becoming an orphan was eminent. My head became heavy. I quickly rushed 2 e hospital she was in. Dere she lay lifeless. I regretted not treating her better when she was alive. I regretted dat she went away too soon dat i could not ask for forgiveness from her. I regretted dat i did not hug her or kiss her or cuddle up 2 her. I was petrified. Speechless and juz shocked. After e burial, I had 2 move on. Living w/o a mother. Living alone with my father and siblings. Alot of trouble arised. Alot of fights emerged. Well this goes 2 show that i need 2 improve on myself. Mayb diz is god's way of telling me, Treat my mother better. Mayb this is a sign that humans dun live long. Mayb this is a sign dat mothers are important. In short, girls are important in this Men's World. I love u mom.   Den in the shower, while waiting for e water 2 warm up, it had me thinking. Abt a girl. She has a boyfriend. And i'm like chasing her. It would be such a chaos in her life. Mayb i should juz leave her alone. Maybe i should juz give her space 2 breathe. Like wad i learnt from liking haswani, it doesn't mean dat if u like dat person, dat person muz like u back. I tink i'll juz leave her. If u love sumbody, juz let her go and if she wants u, she will return. Let fate do e toking. And if she doesn't want u, dere are still alot of ladies in e world. Dun lose hope.   Ok now i have 2 get ready.. Meeting Fairul soon.. ahh.. i hope i get 2 eat a gd breakfast..haha.. he's loaded 2dae!! yeah!! haha.. ok.. Chill out!

Den met up wif yasir, faiz, alfiyan, izzat and iqbal at small mac at ard 6.45. Well.. den we boarded bus 19 on a 30mins journey 2 changi airport's cargo terminal. When we reached e bustop we were supposed 2 alight at, a security personel boarded e bus. I was like.. why is he staring at me? I raised my hand.. Den my finger came out. haha.. din notice which one.. e middle one almost seemed apparent! haha.. luckily i went down quickly. We den went 2 e guard room 2 exhange our ICs for a visitor's pass. Den we were screened and boarded e bus again 2 our workplace. When we arrived, we had 2 change 2 another pass! It stated..'CONTRACTOR'!!! haha.. Den we went in n change 2 our uniforms. It said 'Aircraft Appearance' at e back.. so chim! E cargo place was a hanger. There was a big top airplane dere. We were given a tin filled wif turpentine and a brush each. Although excited n curious on wad our job was gonna be like, we sat dere n waited for our assignment patiently. Den we were seperated. Me, alfiyan n izzat in one cargo cabin n e other 3 in another. Den we got 2 work. We were joined by an uncle and another kid abt our age. We started entusiasticly. We had 2 brush e metal parts of e cabin wif turpentine and wipe it clean. The place was like filled wif ball bearings, rollers and tracks! Well.. the young guy was like 4ever staring n daydreaming.. N he always went down 2 take a break. E uncle was like.. hey.. u missed a spot!! Grrr... In the end we did most of the job for e kid. Actually we didn't noe wad was next so we juz did our job quickly. We finished e whole cabin at ard 11. Den it was like.. erm.. wad do we do now? haha... we juz sat ard n acted like we were cleaning.. Lunch break!! haha.. our canteen was closed, so we went over 2 e next building's. On e way, we met up wif some of e other cleaners. E 'makciks' were like damn talkative! So 'BISING'! Talk Talk Talk! Den.. Laugh Laugh Laugh.. wah... cannot tahan dem sumtimes. We were told by e guard for dat building 2 take away our food n eat sumwhere else coz we were actually not allowed 2 enter. But we ate up dere anyway.. She was pissed at us of coz. Dunno how 2 eat 2moro!! Den we 'lepak' ard abit n went back 2 work. There was like nth left 2 do.. We finished e job 2 fast. We were given e whiole day, from 8am -3pm 2 clean one cabin. So we juz touched up abit, n of course e other kid was like Missing In Action AGAIN! Den when we were satisfied, we went down for a drink. But, alas, e supervisor spotted us n reprimanded us. He said "Awak nak kerja baik kerja betul2. Saper kasi awak turun dari cabin?! Awak baik jgn turun sampai kul 3. Last warning!" Sumtink like dat lah.. haha.. which means, why were we slacking in short. Haha.. soo we went back n stayed dere.. half asleep juz playing ard wif our brushes.. Time passed soo slowly den.. Den at ard 2.50 an old man went up n said.."Nanti Kul 3, awak bawak semua barang2 turun. Kul 3 ah" Haha.. he held up his 3 fingers.. n were like.. read btw e lines!

      ----------------------------------------  HAHA!! READ DIZ!  --------------------- The boss of a big company needed to call one of his employees about an urgent problem with one of the main computers, dialed the employee's home phone number and was greeted with a child's whisper, "Hello." "Is your daddy home?" he asked. "Yes," whispered the small voice. "May I talk with him?" The child whispered, "No." Surprised, and wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, "Is your mommy there?" "Yes." "May I talk with her?" Again the small voice whispered, "No." Hoping there was somebody with whom he could leave a message, the boss asked, "Is anybody else there?" "Yes," whispered the child, "a policeman." Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked, "May I speak with the policeman?" "No, he's busy", whispered the child. "Busy doing what?" "Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman", came the whispered answer. Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the earpiece on the phone the boss asked, "What is that noise?" "A hello-copper" answered the whispering voice. "What is going on there?" asked the boss, now alarmed. In an awed whispering voice the child answered, "The search team just landed the hello-copper." Alarmed, concerned, and even more then just a little frustrated the boss asked, "What are they searching for?" Still whispering, the young voice replied along with a muffled giggle: "ME."

Den we had dinner at KFC, Den headed back 2 bedok. On e way. I called charlene.. i was like.. so nervous.. my heart was beating so fast. I nvr get diz feeling when talking 2 other girls.. Ahh.. i totally lost it 2dae!! Well... dere's still a lifetime 2 do it.. i'll get her.. in time.. But alas when we got 2 bedok.. yasir realised dat he left faiz's pair of ring back at KFC. Den we decided 2 go back 2 orchard n search for it. We flaged a cab n went dere straight away. E cab had diz tv at e center spacing which was great coz e journey was quite long. When we got 2 e KFC, we got e manager out n talked 2 her. Our faces were all like so damn fierce n angry. Den dey searched e dustbin where dey threw our trays. Nothing. So we asked dem 2 bring us 2 e main rubish dump. When we got there, it was like impossible 2 find it already. We got back down. Den we asked for compensation or dey help us find it. The manager told us dat she will contact e area manager. She took down my number n claimed dat e area manager would contact me later 2moro. Lets see if dey do it.. Of not.. i'll go down 2 dat outlet n realli charge dem. Ok.. Den we went back 2 bedok.. tired n angry. We went 2 diz shop. They were charging onli $1 for one hr for CS! So we vented our anger on killing ourselves!! Haha.. we got so addicted 2 it dat we went off onli at 10.50pm! Haha.. Den now i'm back home.. ahh... Gotta rest... Will blog again 2moro! Hang Loose!!

Well.. we played terribly dat day and not discrediting e fact dat pasirian was gd technical wise. No use regretting now though. Juz have 2 wait for e next competition till we have a chance again. Schools been ok. I've been thinking abt alot of things lately. Retaking Maths O level in November, Promos in October.. Common test next wk! hahaha.. alot of things.. no time for play. Last saturday i went 2 diz party at inez's place. Well.. it was great and all.. but e music was not 2 my liking thus i din really dance..

But unfortunately or fortunately, she's only 13. Well.. she's attached anyway, so i shall not do anything.. yet! haha... Floorball's been facing alot of problem. The principal was suggesting dat we shorten our training time coz some players blamed fb as e excuse 2 why dey did not do well for e mid yr. Dey said training took up alot of their time. Haiz.. w/o mr amir here, fb is going 2 get pushed ard already. Really crazy.. I juz hope dat i can pass my promos later. N yeah.. RoCK oN Guys!!!

      Well.. i'm at e sch library now. I'm in e middle of my 3rd free period! Kewl man.. come 2 sch with so many free periods. My second free period was spent wif my darl. Haha.. it was kewl.. Have 2 look out for teachers and stuffs. U noe how teachers are right. Not all of dem of course. Only some. 2dae, we'll be having a rehersal for the national day performance on friday. The 'Outdoor' parade and also the indoor performance. You can't exactly call e observance parade an outdoor parade in my sch coz its done in e gymnasium. An enclosed area. So.. ahhaa... Its bartley campus.. wad do u expect man? Going 2 wear e No.5 J! My first time wearing dat. Very seldom does and ncc cadet get 2 wear such a ceremonial uniform. No.1 uniform gets so dull and boring after some time. So i guess its gonna be kewl. At least i get 2 show pple myself in uniform. Haha.. Afterall, which girl doesn't love seeing a guy in uniform! Haha.. I did another video for this event. ANOTHER! But.. i've realised, my video editing skills aren't dat good. Its still juz at e low level stage. But with a good word from miss gan, my mgt tutor, the principal wants me 2 work wif the technicians from both toh tuck and bartley and produce videos for Graduation Ceremony and stuffs. It would definitely be a learning experience for me. Getting 2 work wif real professionals. Its gonna be a blast. Yeah.. Life is good.. Its all good!

      Its funny how 2 people who have been arguing for 1 month be having feelings for each other a month later. Its funny how much e blizzard coldness of cold war can turn into life's most wonderful bliss. Well... i'm here 2 say that these things can come true. It came true in my life. I believe in it. Sometimes, e person dat is suppose 2 be with you can be juz right under ur nose. Its juz a matter of realising it. Juz a matter of accepting it. Juz a matter of seeing it.   My Story   When i first started in Millennia Institute in late March this yr, i met a few good friends who were by me thru thick and thin. I was kinda acting stupid for e first half of the yr as they would say. Always merajuk n stuffs. Well.. there was diz one particular girl in the group that was always nice 2 me and vice versa. But when i started 2 merajuk and stuffs, she would be scolding me and we would be arguing like crazy. I would call her 2 apologise nite after nite but we kept on arguing abd another case. After a while, i started hating her. I despise her. I Loathe her. But during e June break, I was away from dem, from her. I thought about wad happened and reflected on myself. When sch reopened, My friends said that i've changed. Although i din realise it, but i've changed. Well.. The girl was having diz WIP(work in progress) with another guy, but they always seem 2 be encountering problems. Slowly, nite after nite, we talked on e phone abt her problems and my problems and soon, we were kinda ok. Soon after dat, her WIP kinda betrayed her. He was a JERK. TOTAL JERK! But she was ok after a while. Soon after dat, we began getting close. Den.. it struck me... wad are we? I mean.. we were like more den friends.. but wad are we? I den realised dat i liked her. I really liked her. Now.. we are.. haha.. WIP.. and after dat.. mmm.. we'll see how it goes. The girl.. My Girl, Inez... God... i love saying dat.. Inez... haa..  Peace Out!
