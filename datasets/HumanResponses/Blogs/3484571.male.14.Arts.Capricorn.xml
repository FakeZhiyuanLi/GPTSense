      Ok, I'm holding here in front of me a check for $4,000. I don't know what to do with it. Comment if you have any suggestions. And no, I will not give it to you. In part or in whole. -Bruno McC.

      My friend David Vining from Walton won the lottery on friday. It's something like 2.7 million and he says that with that cash, he's leaving the Falklands next year. So congrats Dave! He gave me four thousand because he thinks i saved his life. Once, in an electrical storm, i went into the basement as switched on the breakers. The lights came on and because he is so afraid of the dark he thought he'd die if they didn't go on, i guess he thinks i saved his life. So here I am with four grand. Below, there's a picture of Dave packing up his liquor. No matter how rich a man gets, his wine's his best feature.

      Today's so uneventful. I got up and was confused about when i had to be at work. That happens every weekend. I'm done with my 300 names. The list is done. My lifes void-ful now. Yep, fulla voids. Work tomorrow too. Even earlier, what a bonus. I never keep these things because i don't ever know how to keep them interesting. As you can see I've already lost that race. DumbCrap, signing off.

      Day off today for some...thing of a holiday. How are you all doing today? I have Monday off as well. Isn't that something? I'm feeling like i don't know what to write. It's an eloquent feeling, aint that ironico? I'm going to resume my prior activity of scouring my computer for good songs. You're not invited.   Go away,     -Now.

      Got hit by a bus today. I broke my left leg and knocked out the bus driver. I'm not suing. I had some really good soup today. I gave the four grand to this homeless guy I know. Don't you have someplace else to be?

      I had a strange day at work today. Someone stole my Top Ramen. I had it on the stove and when i came in to check on it, it had dissapeared. Not a trace. But Donner and Dasher sent me a letter of apology, so i checked the return address and sent them an envelope of mice turds. Happy eating and mice turds, -Bruno.

      I haven't blogged for the past couple days, but don't worry, I do have an excuse. Two men who called themselves Donner and Dasher broke into my home last night and took my cat hostage. They took her to their hideout where they made untraceable cellphone calls to my house, demanding a $29 ransom. I refused and they returned my cat. See? You can deal with criminals in a calm manner and they won't kill your cat. They did steal my Jewel CD though. I mean, my boyfriend's Jewel CD. I mean, my boyfriend's Aimee Mann CD. I mean, my girlfriend's boxers. Crap...Nevermind.
