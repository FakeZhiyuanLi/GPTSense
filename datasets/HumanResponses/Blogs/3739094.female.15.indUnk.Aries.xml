      How come, we don't even talk no mo', And you don't even call no mo', We don't barely keep in touch at all, And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo', And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now, After all the years we've been down, Ain't no way, no how, This bullshit can't be true, We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you -eminem  lower villa ppl- i miss u all lots but im sick of the one always calling u...time for u do pick up the freakin phone and call me...u always said bff and kit...what the hell? were u on crack? i guess so cause u didnt mean a damn word of it...

      ok so alaina and i went on a trail ride [hudsons first ever] and he was good...cept for the time i scrapped my arm in pricker bushes and got suck in the branches...and so we went to this neighborhood and hudson wanted to gallop and i was like 'no' and so he got mad so at the end were coming out of the trees and all to this opening were the house is and then u need to go through a tiny trail to get to the barn. so while we're coming into the opening tigger[tubbsy] spooked at deer so hudson[bubbsey] spooked and hes not the spooking type so when he spooks he spooks...so i fell of and he galloped towards the barn and tried to find the path to get to the barn and he couldnt find it so he stopped and ate grass...i was like 'my smart horsey' but for his first time...he was good....THANKS AGAIN ALAINA!!

       whoever does not agree w/ the statements below is sum1 i dont want to be in contact w/...      1. Brandon Cole Margera [Bam as he prefers to be called] is the most awesome person in the entire world...even though i did not like some of the stuff shown w/ him and jenn in cky4...however, jenn sucks and thats it. The way Bam feels about Tony Hawk is the way i feel about Bam...Bam is my hero.      2. Shaun White [aka-Senor Blanco] rocks. He is amazing in all he does. He is a pro skater, pro snowboarder, & amazing surfer...and is only 17. Shaun is also my hero.      **last n foremost- I   Y   BAM &amp; SHAUN**    var chatterbox = 'no';         urlLink   Talk  in my  urlLink flooble chatterbox, a free javascript chat tag board / shoutbox / tagboard program for your xanga, diary, blogger or weblog  Free  urlLink animated text javascript script      if (!chatterbox  chatterbox != 'ok') { document.write('This  urlLink flooble chatterbox  is'); document.write(' temporarily unavailable.
