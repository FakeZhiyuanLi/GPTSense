      I'm picking Eileen up from the Airport tonite. I'm skipping our Monday morning meeting because I'm dog tired. I have to take my UNIX final today. I still have a 4.0, but I've only taken 2 classes.

      I went to my distant cousin's going away barbeque today. He makes some good taco burgers. He's going to Korea, and his family will be waiting for him to get back at Fort Drum. I'm hating life at work. Weekend and nights suck. Eileen gets back Monday. Finally. And we're off to the Bahamas. Also I forgot to mention on Thurs Tigger and I got our White belts in Tae Kwon Do. Don't mess with us. We'll beat you up!! I'm not playing.

      I saw the movie Monster tonite. What a powerful film. Life can be really ugly. Well I started thinking about some things, after I watched the movie. Life is put into perspective when you see someone else's destroyed. I Wish I could take my grandmother to visit Japan. She is Japanese, and hasn't been back since the 50's. I know that would rock her world. I spoke with my Mom, and she wasn't feeling well. Worrying about everyone, but herself. If she could quit smoking, go back and finish her degree ( 8 Credits away!). If she could just think about herself for a change. I think my Dad is doing OK. It was his B-day today. 47. I think he's going to run with me in the Marine Corps Marathon. He's got to quit smoking too. Gina, Julie, Rita, Patty, and my Mom (sisters) have not been on good terms since my Grandfather died. He and my grandmother were such a presence that when they died the sisters could not stick together. I worry about my Aunt Mary also. Drugs have gotten the best of her in resent years. I hope she can overcome, I know it's difficult, and understand where she is coming from. Only a few of us are dealt the best cards. I have been so fortunate. I had the best of all my family growing up, and the reason I have been successful is because, everyone in my family gave me every building block that I needed to insure it.

      I had an interview today at Matigan's Grill, after I got back from the gym. This was the first time I ever interviewed at a restaurant. I asked for 90K. I got a free meal out of it, and their supposed to let me if they want to proceed by Friday. I have about three more interviews scheduled this month. I'm going to try to have them compete, so I can ask for more money.
