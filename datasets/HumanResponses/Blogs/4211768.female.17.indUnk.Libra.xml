      Me here again,feeling really down early in the morning! What happen loz... It's all because of Wenjie again!Last nite, while we were chatting in the msn, he suddenly offline. This morning, i called him and he told me that something's wrong with the computer...  Is that true?I can sense that he is angry with me for not chatting with him.Now there giving me loads of lame n just lame excuses. Are these lame excuses or just beautiful lies?I cant differentiate!I can also be very sure that he was still online and did not wanna chat with me,he's simple too BUSY. Busy chatting with all his taiwanese babes! I dont think my feeling is wrong!Anyway why is he always so honest,telling me that he went to date gals.Although it's nothing but i will be JEALOUS.I am his girlfriend!Yes, thanks to his honesty,for telling me all these...but how do i feel!Cant he just control himself?Likes to flirt so much in my absence!>....... Never even spare a tot for my feelings. Always clain that he misses me....should i believe?I reali wonder...  Always so sad.....wanna rite out my sorrows here cuz i haf nobody to talk to....its hell........

         Currently in a relationship and i love my boyfriend very much!He is non other than Wenjie!       He cares,worries for me all the time, i have always been a failure. I always make my darling worry! I like it! Isnt it good to have someone care for u? Love is ultimate! U can never estimate love! For me, i need love, lots of love from Wenjie especially!! He away in malaysia now. Just now we met out for a while...I was idiotic, made him angry again! I donno why my hp always haf this problem, send message to the wrong person. Initially, i was supposed to send a message to a fren but when i sent, it automatically sent to Wenjie. Then i really dont want him to read the message as it was not meant for him and thats why i wanna snatch it away from him. He was so mad at this. I think i know why....he must be wondering why he cant read.Is it some kind of secrets...? Or....haiz..ok the problem is settled after all...!              This guy here is really scary when he gets angry.But i always make him angry!!so sad!! Sometimes i ask myself...why n why.. But he is really good to me!That is why i have to treasure him more than anybody...I have been asking myself,have i been a gd gf to him..but whenever i ask him,he'll say that i m ok still perfect but for me i dont think so lah!haha!! anyway, he's gonna be my one n only!the very last bf!i must try very hard to maintain...
