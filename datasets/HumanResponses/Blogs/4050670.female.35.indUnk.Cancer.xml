      I would have Piglet hanging off of me for 20-30 minutes every 2 to 3 hours while she would eat 2 to 3 ounces.  This is, after all what she does while I'm at work.  Instead, she nurses for 5 minutes, falls asleep for 30, nurses for 5 more minutes, plays for 15, etc.  I try all the "tricks" to get her to quit doing this, but nothing works.  The only time I am a "bottle" is in the middle of the night.  Then she takes care of business like she should so she can spend the next hour or so laying there in Mommy's lap making cute faces.  I cannot get over the change in Piglet over the last week or so.  She's had a major growth spurt - I finally got to take the newborn head positioner out of the car seat and out of the swing.  She's getting stronger and much more alert.  She's started growing up...and I want her to stay little...  I think we're going to have blue-eyed-girl #2.  I know that 2 months is WAY too early to know for sure, but her eyes are really lightening up.  She still looks like Tater did when she was newborn, but she's much more dark complected than Tater is.  I tried to take pictures of them yesterday and today in matching outfits.  Piglet lays there, not necessarily happily all the time, but she at least will let me snap a picture.  Tater...sigh.  She's over this picture taking business (and it's driving me crazy).  I just want one picture of my girls together -- when both of them are awake and in matching clothes.  Is that too much to ask?  One of these days Kuntree's going to get tires.  Hopefully it's before the bald front passenger-side one blows.  I honestly do not remember ever buying tires for a vehicle.  Granted, I have kept each of my last 5 cars less than two years yeah, but Kuntree has had his truck for around two years and this is set of tires #2.  Maybe it wouldn't bother me so much if he could put $60 Wal-Mart tires on it!  I guess given the choice of new tires or a wrecked truck, I'll gladly give in for the tires.  Tater's at Grandma and Papa's tonight with my nephew.  It's so quiet here.  I miss her and she's only been gone for 6 hours.  Speaking of my nephew, he has grown up this summer!  Nephew will be 13 in October.  He has definitely gone from boy to teenager...complete with peach fuzz above the lip!  He's my first baby...and is all grown up...

      Thank goodness it's just about over.&nbsp; It's been a very long week...   I hate going to the courthouse.&nbsp; I tried to get my tags and drivers license switched to Alabama yesterday afternoon (since I've been in the state since 1 December and my tags expire tomorrow).&nbsp; I struck out on my license, I have to go only on Monday or Tuesday to the examining office to get a slip of paper.&nbsp; Seems my Alabama license had expired while I was living in Las Vegas or Texas.&nbsp; I won't have to take a test, but still have to go back.&nbsp; If it wasn't for not having insurance in Texas where my license is from (which makes sense given that the car lives in Alabama) and wanting to be able to vote in November I'd say screw it!&nbsp;&nbsp;   It was so weird to see&nbsp;Kuntree getting ready for work this morning.&nbsp; Today is the first day he has worked since December 18th, 2003.&nbsp;   It's strange sometimes how God works things out.&nbsp; If Kuntree had been working we wouldn't have had the time to talk the Aunt into watching Tater so she would have been in day care all this time (we really wanted family to be with her if one of her parents couldn't be)...I wouldn't have had him to wait on me hand and foot and take care of Tater while I was pregnant with Piglet and simply couldn't...he wouldn't have been able to be with FIL after his surgery...he wouldn't have been able to take off to B'ham when Piglet was in the NICU...I wouldn't have had the 8 weeks to spend with him after Piglet was born...&nbsp;   Financially it's even more amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuntree's unemployment ran out at the end of June. &nbsp;I went almost 3 weeks without any pay and&nbsp;4 more weeks of only 60% of my pay,&nbsp;we spent well over $1000 in B'ham after Piglet was born, yet all the bills are paid, we've had plenty of food to eat and haven't had to ask anyone for anything.&nbsp; The job he now has is the first one that the company had advertised since January.&nbsp; He applied for it at the beginning of July and is at work today.&nbsp; It simply amazes me.&nbsp;  Our internet at work is pissing me off.&nbsp; We have outages every single day.&nbsp; Instead of getting a T1 line, they've got us on cable internet.&nbsp; This is the same internet I get at home that doesn't have a problem.&nbsp; I don't know what it is, but it's really hard to do&nbsp;my job when the damned internet is down!  I've gotten 5 calls from the Aunt so far today (it's a little after 11 as I type this).&nbsp; It's been 9 years since she's had one Piglet's age and her kids were both bigger than Piglet when they were born so she's a little nervous.&nbsp; If I could tell her that Piglet eats 3 ounces every three hours it would be different.&nbsp; I told her that we feed on demand...don't worry about how much she eats or how often...if she's got her distinct "I'm hungry" cry, feed her.&nbsp; If she doesn't want it she won't eat.&nbsp; Now I'm waiting for the call that says she's ready for me to come home and feed her.&nbsp; The other part of that is that Tater isn't napping for her.&nbsp; Hell, Tater doesn't nap for  me .&nbsp; Wait...call #6 from the Aunt.&nbsp; "You  do  have sugar, right?"  I should probably be working...

      8:15 pm last night they finally call.&nbsp; Kuntree starts at 8 am Friday!&nbsp; He'll be on days for 2 weeks and then he'll go to his normal shift.&nbsp; I'm kinda sad because it's been very nice having him as a SAHD for the last 7 months.&nbsp; I think he's ready to go back to work and Tater and Piglet enjoy their Aunt's company.  At 8:50 Tater asked to go to bed.&nbsp; Kuntree took her and stayed with her for a little bit, since I had Piglet attached.&nbsp; I went in about 10 minutes later.&nbsp; By 9:15 she was sound asleep.&nbsp; She woke up at between 2 and 3 and Kuntree went in and gave her the dang paci and she was out...till 6:30 this morning!&nbsp; WOO HOO!&nbsp; She did it!  Piglet went to sleep at just after 10.&nbsp; She woke up at 1 (we were up till almost 2), and again at 3 for just a couple of minutes (until I put her in bed with me).&nbsp; She woke me up at 5:15!&nbsp; Mama got a good night's sleep!  It's amazing what sleep will do to your attitude.&nbsp; I didn't get nearly as pissed as usual when Kuntree&nbsp;told me at 5:45 am that his parents would be&nbsp;at&nbsp;our house&nbsp;"any minute".&nbsp; FIL is going to Florida to fish today and MIL is spending the day with Kuntree and the girls.&nbsp; No, he didn't tell me that they were coming, though I did suspect it.  Let's hope new improved attitude makes it through the day at work (it's not looking good)!

      but I finally got&nbsp;a great night's sleep!&nbsp; Piglet and I went to bed right after my shows went off.&nbsp; She lasted 15 minutes in her cradle before she woke up and was in the bed with me.&nbsp; Kuntree came to bed at some point, though honestly I can't say I knew he was there (I don't think he had much room...the littlest ones take up the most space it seems).&nbsp; When Piglet and I woke up at about 1:30 he wasn't in bed and the monitor was off.&nbsp; Seems he and Tater slept most of the night on the floor in the living room!&nbsp; Anyway, Piglet only woke up twice between 10 and 4:45 and went right back to sleep each time.&nbsp; Well, I say she did...I did anyway.&nbsp; Too bad she couldn't have waited till 5:30 when the alarm went off.   Tater's started asking to go to bed.&nbsp; She'll start whining, say she's sleepy and off we go.&nbsp; Kuntree or I sit next to her bed and sing/ssshhhh her until she goes to sleep, but, hey, it's a start!&nbsp; Monday night it only took an hour to get her to sleep (only - ha!), last night we were down to about a half hour.&nbsp; I can deal with that.&nbsp; Now if we can just keep the big girl in the big girl bed all night it'll be awesome.&nbsp; Maybe when the remaining 3 molars she's cutting finally come through...&nbsp;   Kuntree's feeling poorly, sinus problems.&nbsp; I know that there's nothing worse than feeling bad and having to take care of two little ones all day.   I've been keeping it quiet, and I'm hoping it'll be official before I post this, but it looks like Kuntree's not going to be a SAHD much longer.&nbsp; He's completed the application process with a major employer in the area (AmICrazyYet - the one across from Flowers Hospital).&nbsp; He's done the application, interview, testing, allergy testing, drug testing, and complete physical.&nbsp; Now he waits for the phone call to tell him what time to be at work...possibly as early as   tomorrow  !&nbsp; He'll be working 6 pm to 6 am, 7 shifts a pay period (every two weeks).&nbsp; He'll be on two/off two/on three (Friday-Sunday)/off two/on two/off three (Friday-Sunday).&nbsp; My sister has agreed to watch the girls until my mom retires at the end of September.&nbsp; Then Aunt will watch them one week (for pay) and Grandma will watch them the other (for free).&nbsp; I don't exactly know how I'll do being a single mom at night.&nbsp; It was easy with just Tater, especially since she was younger, cosleeping still, and Kuntree didn't leave for work until 9 pm.   Female boss is on vacation through next Tuesday.&nbsp; I get to be boss.&nbsp; Fun.&nbsp; I get to babysit four men for the next week.&nbsp; People create so much extra freaking work.&nbsp; We have these aircraft clocks that go to get repaired locally, but on a blanket purchase order.&nbsp; I just found out that male subordinate #1 has been tracking them on an Excel spreadsheet...when they're already being tracked on multi-hundred-thousand-dollar logistics program.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Do you do these things to feel important?&nbsp; And talk about overload!&nbsp; Doing both our jobs makes me a very unhappy girl.&nbsp; (For the record, she didn't do mine while I was out...male subordinate #1 did the  little  bit that was done.)  Dang it...Amish in the City starts tonight.&nbsp; We don't get UPN.&nbsp; I'm sure Kuntree will be delighted that I won't be watching.  Off to get some more work done...

      A queen-sized bed is not big enough for 4 people, even if one of them is only 8 pounds.&nbsp; Tater is supposed to be sleeping in her big girl bed.&nbsp; She does great until about 2 am when she wakes up and Kuntree brings her to our bed.&nbsp; Piglet is usually already there (isn't she supposed to be sleeping in the cradle?).&nbsp; And speaking of Piglet...one day I will be able to convince her that 1-3 am is  NOT  time to lay in Mom's arms with eyes wide open.&nbsp; I just  knew  that she'd sleep better last night after her shots.&nbsp; I couldn't have been more wrong.  Pumping at work sucks.&nbsp; The building we're in now is a WWII-era building, probably one of the original 1500 buildings that they built in the first 120 days of the Camp in 1942.&nbsp; We have cubes, not offices that luckily&nbsp;have 8-foot walls.&nbsp; After a week and a day of pumping at my desk and hoping that when someone walked in (as they have every day) that I was totally covered, I bought a shower curtain rod and shower curtain to make a door.&nbsp; I pump twice a day...mid-morning and mid-afternoon.&nbsp; This morning female boss opened closed "door" to ask a question...male assistant reached arm in to put something into my in box.&nbsp; Screw them.&nbsp; I'm not going in the stinky filthy bathroom (which I won't even  USE ) and there aren't any other options.&nbsp; I must feed my child.

      This is my blog and I'll brag if I want to... I've got to get this one "on paper" until I find Tater's baby book. Last night she was playing with some of her too-small sandals. I heard her talking but wasn't paying close attention.  She came running up to me holding this shoe, "4 Mommy, 4 Mommy, 4!"  I had no freaking clue what she was talking about, "4?"  "4 Mommy, 4 Mommy!"  I then see the "4" on the inside of the shoe...the size! I praised her and told her how big she was and she went off on her way.  As she walked away I heard, "Whatcha doin in there 4?" I bout wet my pants from laughing so hard. As Hooni would say, she slays me.  Kuntree got the weekly call from his parents last night (wait...they call every day, but the weekly question). "Could you meet me halfway on Monday and let Tater stay till Friday?" He lost it. Basically he told her that after he got on his new shift and we got into a routine she could go stay for a night or two, but NOT the first week on the shift. We are just getting her into a routine, after 19 months, and she needs some structure! After he hung up he told me that he was getting sick and tired of hearing "you're never going to let her come stay with us again, blah blah blah."  I asked finally if Kuntree was going to tell them that we were going out of town this weekend. He said, "Yeah, I'm going to tell them." I told him that I was scared they'd show up. He said, "Yeah, that's why I'm telling them after we're already there and it's too late for them to get there!" I love my husband.  I had to take Piglet to the doctor on Tuesday. She had a few spots from a rash when I left the house Tuesday morning and I really didn't think anything about it. By the time I got home for lunch it had spread all over her body. I called and got an appointment for 2 hours later. Turns out it's viral and it'll go away in a couple of days.  My little tiny baby is hardly tiny anymore...she weighed 9 pounds 11.5 ounces! 2 1/2 ounces and she'll have doubled her birth weight! She actually has a roll or two and chubby cheeks. She holds her head up and smiles and "talks" to you. Sigh...I couldn't ask for anything better than my husband and girls.  Smiling in Alabama, Mrs. Redneck

      It looks like Kuntree finally goes to nights starting Sunday night! Our child care with the Aunt watching the babies isn't too expensive, but it'll be nice to be able to pay less every week (and the Aunt has mentioned that she'd really love a day off).  I was gathering up some of Piglet's preemie clothes to send to the friend of a friend last night. It amazes me that she was that small. I didn't realize just how much she has grown. I got a bit weepy remembering all that happened and all that she (and we) went through. I'm so thankful that she did so well and that she doesn't seem to have any problems now. Heck, she's actually  on  the growth charts (well, 3rd percentile for weight, but that's ON). She's holding her head up some...looking around...smiling (she even has a dimple like Tater). Ok, stopping now...getting weepy again...  Tater thinks everything is hers.  I guess that goes with being one, but she's going to seriously injure herself climing into Piglet's swing!  I'm trying to get her to put her dolls in it instead.  It's not like she doesn't have toys (OH MY does she have toys) or a rocking chair of her own, etc.  She has to sit in Piglet's car seat (imagine a 3-foot child in an infant carrier), she's tried to get into her bouncy seat and now, the swing.  We're definitely progressing into dangerous territory.  One day Tater will learn the word "no."  I really must work...

      I have the hardest time getting motivated on Mondays! Kuntree woke me up at 6 and, like a teenager, I begged for 5 more minutes. Piglet decided that 2 minutes was enough and that it was time for her to get up. She's been sleeping incredibly well. I can't get over it! Tater didn't sleep more than 2 1/2 hours at a time until she was over 6 months old.  I walked into work this morning and someone had cleaned my desk. Well, straightened my piles anyway. It kinda freaked me out. Thank you, but please don't mess with my desk. I think it was male subordinate #2.  Today begins operation get rid of all this fat! I can't  diet  persay since I'm nursing. Instead, I'm cutting back portion sizes and cutting the sugar-filled drinks and tea. I need to lose an average-sized person, but if I could just drop 50 pounds I'd feel tons better. That would take me back to pre-Tater weight (which is still  far  too much). I'll never be skinny, but I do want to feel good enough about myself to get my picture taken!  We're going to  urlLink The Parks at Chehaw  this weekend. Kuntree doesn't know it yet, but he told me to decide where I wanted to go, and this is it! We're not going to camp...South Georgia in August isn't quite condusive to camping, in my opinion. I think Tater will love it...I think I'll just love being  away . The backyard can wait one more week to be mowed.  Work calls!

       How the fuck  dare  that woman sit there with that "I'm better than you" look on her face holding my precious Piglet.  I just said that when I'm home she usually wants me, that's why she cries when FIL holds her...that's why her Daddy couldn't get her to calm down.  MIL takes her away from FIL right as I was about to get up and get her...and after some bouncing, etc., has her asleep.  I want her to get her uninvited self the hell out of my house and her hands off of my daughter.  She's already ruined my first born...she has her calling her "Mama" and has her where she won't give me the time of day when MIL's here.  She wouldn't even give me a goodnight kiss.   (To Kuntree's credit, he stood up to her when she told Tater that she would put her to sleep.  He's in there doing that now)   I will not give her my Piglet.

      Piglet and Tater must both be going through growth spurts.  Tater went on an eating strike this week.  She's eating next to nothing and laid around all day yesterday.  She didn't want to play, just laid on the couch.  That' so  not  like her.  She went to bed at 8 and slept till 6.  She's more herself today, thank goodness.  Piglet is trying to make her mom's boobs explode.  She slept from 10:30 till 4.  She ate, went right back to sleep and slept till almost 8.  I'm not complaining about sleep, don't get me wrong, but OUCH I hurt!  The inlaws are here again.  They were supposed to call yesterday to let Kuntree know if they were coming...he didn't tell me that.  They didn't call.  Kuntree called them this morning as they were just about to leave the house.   That  is when I found out they were going to be coming down.  I asked him if they were spending the night.  "I have  no  idea."  Guess what.  We are going out of town next weekend.  I'm sick and tired of unannounced company.  Mama just   ain't   happy.

      I hate pop-ups, as I am sure everyone does.  So on a normal basis I tolerate them.   However , there are two new types of pop-ups that make me want to scream...the ones that pop up where my favorites list is (over   We got no rain from the storms yesterday, not even a drop.  Of course, I'm glad that we didn't get wet, but I worry about my friends down in Florida.  I hope the damage is minimal!  I'm thinking about you today.  Kuntree has to do another week of days.  This sucks for several reasons...the biggest of which is our money spent to provide adult supervision for our daughters increases  and  he's not getting his 9% shift differential.  Don't mess with the pocket book!  Our stupid cable company is supposed to be getting the DVR cable boxes.  They were supposed to be here at the end of July.  They won't be.  Getting the Olympics events that I want to see on tape is going to be a logistical nightmare...  Finding the time to watch them is something else.  I suppose I should be a productive employee and get some work done today!  Thank goodness I don't have to do this again tomorrow.  First I think I'll get some coffee...

      Since we moved to this new building (they moved while I was in Birmingham with Piglet), our air conditioning has sucked.  We  might  have air blowing, it  might  be cool.  Well yesterday took the cake...the air blowing was  hot .  It was hotter in our offices than it was outside, and just as humid.  Today...we have the sweet feel of cold air blowing and it's almost cooled off the room.  Aaaaahhhhhh  Tater slept all night in her bed...Kuntree didn't even have to go in and check on her once.  She was so cute when she got up this morning.  He'd cracked her door so she could get out.  She comes prissing into the living room in her little nightgown looking like such a big girl saying "I'm not sleepy, I'm not sleepy."  She even left the dreaded paci in her bed.  And sweet darling Piglet...SLEPT FOUR HOURS!  She went to sleep at 9:45 and woke up at 1:45, was back asleep at 2:15 and slept till 5!   And  it was all in her cradle...no sleeping in bed with Mom and Dad at all!  I didn't ask Kuntree this morning how he slept, but  man  I feel refreshed!  I wouldn't dream of holding my breath that it will happen again, but for  today  I feel great!  Piglet's up to 9 pounds something.  She's getting so TALL!  I cannot believe that one of her 0-3 month footed-jammies is starting to get short on her.   And  she finally fits into the clothes that my wolfie friends sent, even her PRR stuff.  I get to take pictures this weekend!  Maybe Tater will cooperate this time.  Sorry for the excessive use of "!"...I'm in a "!" mood today.      Jase leaves the Big Brother 5 house tonight!  Woo-hoo!

      My little talker :)  For a few weeks we've been doing Jack and Jill like this:  Me - Jack and... Tater - Jill Me - Went up the... Tater - Hill Me - To fetch a pail of... Tater - Water Me - Jack fell... Tater - Down Me - And broke his... Tater - Crown Me - And Jill came tumbling... Tater - After  She does the same thing with Humpty Dumpty.  Well, last night we were doing One, Two, Buckle Your Shoe and she started interrupting me.  So now we do it (Tater's lines are in italic)  One  two  Buckle  my shoe  Three  four  Shut  the door  Five  six  Pick  up sticks  Seven  eight  Lay  them straight  Nine  ten  A big  fat hen!   I am so proud of her :)  She also started sing "Shake shake shake booty" last night as well.  We had the best time being lions crawling around on the floor roaring at everything.  Then we played with her mega blocks "car" and "beep beeped" at everything that got in our way.  We laughed....  All while Piglet slept.  It was great to actually be able to get down and play with her.  My knees are killing me today (I  must  lose weight or I'm not going to be able to walk), but it was  SO VERY  worth it.  (While we were doing this Kuntree was making homemade peanut butter cups...man, I love him!)  Kuntree's taking Tater to the Big Buck Expo Saturday.  I can just see when she gets a little bigger her getting ready to go hunting with Daddy.  (I was 5 the first time I went deer hunting with my daddy...and talked so much the deer wouldn't have dreamed of coming within 10 miles of us.)  I'm so glad that Kuntree is such a good daddy and takes her with him places by themselves.  I mentioned to him that Saturday evening or afternoon I wanted him to take Piglet so Tater and I could do  something  by ourselves.  He told me that he'd take Piglet to the Expo if I wanted him to.  (I can imagine how sore my boobs would be by the time they got home.)  Off to get a little bit of work done!

      I did it.  I got that stupid license.  I decided to go ahead up there again today so I didn't have to think about it next week.  Good thing, too, 'cause the last day for voter registration before the local elections is Friday.  I just want to vote AGAINST our former mayor in his city council bid.  I've been swamped at work.  I would say that I didn't know why, but I do.  I just wish that each of my contacts would realize that they are not my  only  contact.  I do support 53 other people!  Female boss keeps giving me tons to do and male subordinate #1 isn't working as quickly as I like and male subordinate #2 is just plain slow.  It took him and hour and a half to do one order.  There's just no sense in that!  If it wasn't so freaking hot and humid in this room my mood would improve dramatically!  Kuntree may be on another week of days.  I'm not ready for him to be gone at night, but I'm ready to find out what normal is going to be.  Boring day, sorry.

      I need a driver's license that says "State of Alabama".  How difficult should that be?  When I moved to Vegas, I handed them my Alabama license, they handed me a Nevada license.  When I moved to Texas, I handed them my Nevada license, they handed me a Texas license.  My Texas license is no where near expiring.  I only need an Alabama one because my car is now registered in Alabama and you have to have an Alabama license so that they can check your insurance...it's weird.  So I can't just go in and hand them my Texas license...I have to go to another building - which is not in the same place it was back in 1987 when I moved here the first time - to the Examiner's Office.  I take her my birth certificate, my Texas license and she asks to see my social security card.  Um, don't have it.  The only things I carry around are my driver's license, my contractor badge so I can get on post and my ATM card.    Do you have a letter from the Social Security Office?  No, why would I have that?  Do you have a military ID?   No, but I have a contractor ID with my social on it.   That won't work.  Do you have an insurance card with your social on it?  I sure do, but it's in my kids' diaper bag.  You can't take my contractor ID?  It's issued by the military?  No, that isn't on the list.  Why don't you run home and bring it back.  I'll just hold your license and birth certificate.  No, I can't do that.  I live in (another town, about 30 miles from the driver's license office) and I have to go to work.  Ok, well we'll be here tomorrow.  I won't.  I have to work.  I'll try again next week.  This sucks.  Now I'm pissed off and have to deal with idiots at work.

      Tater.  I'm glad she's a talker, she's gauranteed to keep me laughing.  Tonight she comes up to me pointing at the back of one of her Dora books.  She's saying something that sounds like "supper"...and she's saying it OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER...  Upon inspection of the book, I find that she's saying "Swiper".  We practice the word for a few minutes, she's got it just about perfect now.  Anyway, as she's walking away she puts her hand out and says "Swiper no Swiper" (ok, so she's a little off, but I'm sure Swiper gets the just of it).  After a second I hear "Aw, man."  I laughed so hard I cried.  If you've never watched Dora you won't get it...and you're missing out on a really good story.

      They've been here for about 20 minutes.  I was feeding Piglet when they came in (Tater is taking a  much  needed nap).  Piglet and I had a really bad night...Kuntree ended up getting up with her...she wouldn't take a bottle for him...he had to wake me up to feed her less than an hour after he took her...really bad night (yes, my tears were involved).   Anyway , I was feeding Piglet when they came in (we didn't know what time they'd be here so that involved sprinting to the bedroom with a kid attached to my boob)...she didn't eat much, seemingly can't decide whether to sleep or eat.  I gave up, got her dressed, passed her to FIL.  He, held her for seconds before MIL took her.  Piglet did not burp when she ate.  When she needs to burp she makes a certain "fussy" noise.  MIL had Piglet on her shoulder and she started making that noise.  I told MIL that Piglet needed to burp.  "Oh."  After a couple of seconds, the noise started getting louder.  MIL says in a baby voice "You don't like that?  Are you hungry?"  She looks at me and says "Does she need to eat?    Do you have a bottle?  "  WHAT THE HELL?  WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?  I told her that she didn't need to eat, that sound was her trying to burp.  She again said "Do you have a bottle?"  I told her that she was protesting bottles, she wouldn't even take a bottle for Kuntree last night.  Ugh.  Please, Lord, don't let them spend the night.

      Mom sent an email to the Mayor of our small town yesterday complaining about the speed of traffic in the morning and afternoon commutes.  She got a return email within 30 minutes.  I was quite impressed!  I have noticed through the day today that there seems to be more police patrolling the street (yes, there is one main street through town).  Only in a very small town will one person emailing the mayor show results.  Speaking of mayor...this is an election year.  Actually, this is the election month as elections are being held on the 24th.  I noticed today that the former mayor (for MANY years) was running for City Council.  This man held back the town, in my opinion.  There was talk of Wal-Mart trying to buy some land and putting a store in the town (we're right outside of a military base so this was the perfect location...the others are too far to go to during lunch).  He stopped it.  He stopped a lot around here.  He "retired" from being mayor 8 years ago.  Now he wants to get his grimy paws in it again.  Please, let him not be elected, please.  In other news...it seems the Trooper on the corner got an unmarked car.  Hmmm...  We really need to get down and meet them - no, not because he's a cop, but because they have a little boy that appears to be just older than Tater.  For that matter, there's a child that lives immediately next door that might be around Tater's age.  All I've seen is the car seat so I'm really not sure!

      Another good night, finally.  Piglet went to sleep at 10, up at 1, up at 3, up at 6.  Tater went to sleep easily at 9:30, up at 1 and in bed with us, and up again at 6.  Really, this is good for us!  Kuntree took Tater on a date last night - to Wal-Mart to get groceries.  Tater came home in the best of moods!  Kuntree said she was really good (and so far she always has been in public).  He, however, was pooped.  He's not used to working (outside of the home) and it's pretty much kicked his butt this week.  Funny, but the Aunt's butt's been kicked, too.  She's never had two really little ones (her kids are 4 years apart) and it's been 9 years since Niece was a baby!  Niece will be going back to school on Monday so Aunt's going to  really  get her butt kicked next week!  We are bad parents.  Kuntree was coming up the sidewalk after work yesterday, after he'd stopped at Little Caesar's for $5 supper and Kallie was watching out the window.  She screamed, "DAADDDYYYY - AND FOOOOOOOD!"  My child really shouldn't know that food comes in pizza boxes or out of drive-thru windows (she goes insane when we pull up to order).  Oops.  I haven't gotten the guts to ask Kuntree if inlaws are coming.  If I don't ask then I can deny it's going to happen, right?  Why does my c-section scar hurt today?  I mean HURT?  Piglet's over 2 months old and it's been totally healed for a month now.  Freaky.  Dang work's getting in the way today...thank goodness it's Friday, though I'd much rather it be Saturday!

      He stood up to them...his parents, I mean. Apparently, MIL called yesterday wanting Tater to go to their house next week. Without hesitation Kuntree said no. He told MIL that he'll be starting nights and that Tater has got to get on a routine. Every time she goes to the in-laws she comes back not wanting to go to sleep, wanting someone with her all the time, etc., and now is not the time for us to have to undo things. Kuntree said she started sniffling, but he told me that Tater is  not  going to go to his parents every other week! I was so proud. I guess I've finally gotten through.  Is it just me or do web pages with black backgrounds and white letters kill your eyes? Maybe I'm forgetting to blink or maybe it's due to Lasik, but I can see the lines from the pages for hours after reading them. Ok, that sounds psycho, but maybe you know what I'm talking about.  Dang Big Brother updates getting in the way of work today.  I am a Big Brother addict.  I must get a life.

      I have been waiting three weeks to have some alone time with Tater. All I want is for Kuntree to watch Piglet for a couple of hours so Tater and I can go -- somewhere -- and be together just the two of us. I'm sure that part of her behavior problems are that Mom and Dad simply aren't giving her enough attention. It's hard to get home from work and nurse the Piglet and get supper and everything...and have time to focus 100% on Tater. And I'm failing miserably. Anyway, since Tater spent weekend before last at the in-laws and last Saturday night with my parents, I told Kuntree that I wanted him -- this weekend -- to let me have some time alone with her. He said sure. HA!  FIL's birthday is Monday. I nonchalantly asked Kuntree last night if he was going to his parents' this weekend. He said either that or they are coming down here. In other words, screw you and your plans to be with our daughter...again. And screw asking you if it's ok with you if my parents come down AGAIN. And screw your parents who Kuntree invited over Saturday for barbeque. The IL's coming down has become an every other weekend thing. You know, I would LOVE to have a weekend with JUST us, the four of us. And I would LOVE to have TWO FRIGGIN HOURS with my oldest to show her that yes, her Mommy DOES love her.  And for the record, someone better start correcting Tater when she calls the MIL "Mommy" and when MIL says "Maw-maw" it doesn't sound any different than "Momma". That's enough to get  Mommy  a bit pissed. I'm sure it has something to do with her refering to herself as "Grandmama" and "Grandmommy". And quit footing confusing my daughter by calling others "Paw-paw." Paw-paw is my dad. We went over this before Tater was ever born. Ok, rant over.  Aunt is back at work today, which means I can actually put in a full day at work for the first time this week.  Thank goodness I'm a salaried employee - if I'm at work  at all , I get the full 8-hours pay.  Aunt's eye is back to almost normal looking and her fever is gone.  She's being a very good girl with the hand sanitizer so I'm pretty sure my girls are safe from pink eye.  Female boss is also back today.  She got here at 10 and has already been wound up four or five times.  I have lots better to do than settle her down!  Lunch calls.

      Aunt Velma (pronounced "Velmer" in true Southern fashion), my grandfather's sister, died yesterday. She had emphysema and heart problems and was on life support. When they unplugged the machines, Aunt Velma died instantly. Uncle SD (who is also my grandmother's brother) and their living children were with her when she died.  Aunt Velma is part of the  other  side of the family. You know that side - the ones you don't really claim and never see. The ones you leave out when you're talking about your relatives.  I remember when I was much younger, Aunt Velma and Uncle SD would come to my other grandmother's house (not the one related to her) to visit my family when we were in town. I remember saying hello, but I don't remember us ever having any conversations. I'm sure that over the years we've met in the grocery store when I was visiting Grandma, but I cannot recall any specific instances.  The last time I saw Aunt Velma was at a family reunion several years ago (I honestly do not recall exactly how many years it's been). Again, I remember seeing her, saying hello, but I don't think I had anything to say after that.  I ran into Aunt Velma's son at Wal-Mart last year when I was in town. If I hadn't been with Grandma he wouldn't have had a clue who I was, and I'd never have known him either. We talked briefly and went our separate ways. This and other similar meetings are the extent of my interaction with her family.  My mom and I talked about needing to go visit Aunt Velma and Uncle SD since they were both sick. We've never gone.  Uncle SD once said that he only had one brother or sister, my Uncle J. He was the only one that ever went to visit them. My Grandma didn't do much more than talk on the phone with them every now and then.  Now that it's too late I wonder about my aunt. I wonder what kind of a person she was. I wonder what she liked, what she disliked, what made her happy, what made her laugh. I wish I had wondered about her years ago instead of being a snob.  Aunt Velma had no insurance and her family has no money. The funeral home needs a $1000 deposit on the $3500 fee before they will have a funeral. In lieu of flowers, the "family" has decided to take up donations toward the funeral. My $100 contribution is significant - her son would have to pay it if I didn't - but so incredibly insignificant considering she was my aunt for 35 years.  Aunt Velma will be laid to rest tomorrow. I am sad - for Uncle SD, for Don and his family, for Ann and her family, for Carolyn's kids that she raised after Carolyn died, for Uncle J.  I am sad because I have no right to grieve.

      Talk about a Monday!  The Aunt came down with pink eye.  I came home about 9:30 or so to take care of Tater and Piglet then my mom took off work at 2 so I could go back to work.  Today I'm going in at lunch, Mom's taking the afternoon off.  You know, it wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't the supervisor this week and if this wasn't just my third week back.  Dang, I've been back 3 weeks!  I have got to find alternate arrangements for the kids.  I went to one day care center yesterday afternoon and decided that my kids wouldn't go there.  Of course, now I find out that it isn't really EASY to get them enrolled, either!  They both have to have Alabama immunization certificates which you have to get from the health department.  I don't know how they're supposed to get the information other than from their shot records, which I have.  Anyway, to get that I'll have to have birth certificates.  I never ordered one for Tater (I love that Alabama automatically sends you one for FREE!).  Now we've sent off for it so we wait.  I'm hoping the Aunt will be better tomorrow.  She's already gotten the talk about using the hand sanitizer before she touches the kids.  I know y'all get tired of reading about Tater and Piglet's sleeping habits...but I must share.  Tater went down at 9:30 or 9:45 last night.  Kuntree figured out the secret.  You have to go into her room and shut the door behind you so she's not interested in what's going on in the living room.  She slept till 7 - the first time in her life she's slept till 7!  Piglet went down at 11, woke up at 2, was back asleep by 2:45.  She woke up at 5, was back asleep by 6, and at 8 is STILL asleep!  I had time to wipe the counters and sweep the kitchen before I fixed my breakfast this morning!   Right after I typed this sentence Tater went into the bedroom hollering "Wake up baby!"  She did.   Ok, what is it with Tater?  She's hitting and it's not play.  She hits her toys, furniture, us, and has gotten Piglet once.  Last night she smacked Kuntree in the face and caught her finger in his eye.    We have tried stern "no, we don't hit, you'll hurt Daddy or Mommy."  She seems to be thinking "good".  We're trying not to hit back, especially since it would be in anger.  Any ideas?  Also any ideas on how to keep her from ripping pages out of her books (short of taking them away) would be much appreciated!  Mom just called.  I'm getting leftover red beans, sausage and rice for lunch...YUM!  While watching the Wiggles I was reminded of something cute that happened last week.  When FIL came back from fishing he brought his uncle, who has Down's Syndrome.  Uncle is in his late 50's.  He'd never met Tater or Piglet.  Tater took a minute to warm up to him, but you would not believe how Uncle BEAMED when Tater held out her hand and told him, "come on!" and took him into her room to play.  When she blew him a kiss bye you'd have thought he'd won a million dollars.  I was so proud of Tater.   Gotta calm the Piglet...

      My goodness, how I love Kuntree.  Piglet was up around midnight sometime then at 2.  And she didn't go back to sleep.  She wouldn't nurse, wouldn't burp, was clean and dry and cuddled between Mom and Dad in bed.  She would not sleep.  At 4 Kuntree got up with her.  I heard her crying and told him to bring her back...he said "I  told  you I'd take care of her now you go to sleep!"  Somehow he got her to go to sleep for a little while (on the floor next to Daddy...what's it with my girls?).  At a little after 7 he brought her in and told me that she was ready to eat.  After nursing her I ate cold pizza from last night (yum) and sat here yawning.  Piglet was asleep in her swing.  Kuntree told me to go to bed.  I went to get her out of the swing and was told, again, "I  told  you to go to bed."  Yes sir.  I heard Tater about 10 so I got up.  I miss her like crazy when she's gone.  Now Kuntree's telling me to go on to bed and he'll put Tater down for a nap.  Maybe this afternoon...
