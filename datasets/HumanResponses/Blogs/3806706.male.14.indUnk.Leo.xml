      I think I did just kick my own ass for even thinking about being depressed.  But then I realized, I wasnt depressed. I was just thinking and worrying too damn much. And about what? My own stupid mistakes. Stuff I never shoulda let happen. Thankfully I didnt let things get worse than they did. Im gonna stay focused on one. ONE. Ill kick my ass if I ever let things happen how they did again.  So I guess I just went through a transitional period. A moment of massive thinking.  And yes, I realized all this when in a  car  ride while listening to guilty gear. Good music neh?  Andy is stickin to his goal. And aint no one gonna interfere.   Fuck depression. I aint got no time for that shit.

      The carnival is in town. Woohaw. Not like Im gonna go on any of the rides though.  There is no way in hell anyones gonna get me to go on that big ass spinny one. No way.  They ran out of funnel cake. I was pissed. Damn Carnies.  We got scammed on the annual hillbilly band. They were FREAKIN playin nelly up there. I was pissed.  Josh punched me because I said ICP sucked. He was pissed. I laughed. Even though it hurt.  Me and Tyrone are gonna make one badass movie. Im telling ya. Its gonna be the great slasher of our time. What with the cheaply designed dummies being thrown in front of  car s and jumping off roofs.... Itll be great. Cheap, but great. Someones will get killed while washing a window. Yup, good stuff.  We went to Dennys and me and Jayjoe ended up payin for everyone.... Goddamn seniors. Cant bring their own money. And those damned chicken fingers didnt come with the sauce. I was pissed. Tyrone stole my chicken. So I put debri of chicken in his water. And he drank it.   Yup. Good stuff. I think Ima go watch the good the bad and the ugly now.   Dennys must burn.
