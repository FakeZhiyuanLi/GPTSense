      Well, alrighty. Here it is, like 8:30 at night or whatever, and I'm so bored, and got to thinking about none other than...me! Haha...When I think about it, I go out of my way for people who don't really give a shit about me. Is that cool? I think not. Thought you'd agree. Anyway, I just think about stuff that I go through & not tell anyone, cuz I don't want to burden people. Sure, I talk about problems & stuff with friends, but who wants to be depressed all the time? I guess praying is the only way to go these days. Sometimes I like helping people with their problems, but when that's ALL they ever wanna talk about, I feel stupid. Is that the only reason they're talking to me? Hell yes it is. It's hella annoying. Then you've got your people who never give a shit...and that's even worse. Kind of...they're just complete opposites. So, in realizing that I care too much about other people, I'm thinking...I need time for me. I need to say what I want to say. I'm gonna say what I want to say. I'm gonna do whatever I want, cuz it's about damn time I did. I've got the bestest friends in the world..they know who they are, and they come first. Other than them, I don't care about anyone else :D. How boring am I? Don't answer that...but hey, I never said I was exciting. I mean, I am. Just not right now. And now that I've said it, you can argue. Whatever. :) So...this Friday night is gonna rock, cuz it's me and my peeps again...Carly, Josh & Megan. We had an awesome time last weekend...goin to Movie Gallery for 3 hours..haha..:P..and Carly MAKING me and Josh go wait in the car. :( Oh, did I mention walking down Carly's road is a lot of fun? Except Megan & I got skeered...creepy stuff! It was foggy out..Oh, and there's no telling what's gonna happen this weekend. :| hehehehehe...*evil grin* Peace & All that shit... SiLaS

      Have you ever noticed how easy it is to call someone your best friend? It seems like people call total strangers their best friend anymore and that's kind of sad. I've known my best friend since 5th grade, except...we haven't been best friends all along. Really, we haven't been really great friends until about a year ago. So see? Sometimes it takes time to get to know a person. If someone asked me what makes a best friend, I'd have to introduce you to my best friend Carly. :) There's a million qualities you can list, but there's just something about Carly that I can't quite define. Sure, she's like everybody elses best friend & you can tell her anything, she keeps secrets, and she helps you through hard times. But that's not all there is to her. She's not there just through the good or bad, she's there all the time. :) (Like that makes sense, but...you know :P) If you're with Carly, you're guaranteed to have fun. Nobody's left out and you're not judged. We've got the bestest inside jokes in the world and no one knows that the hell we're talking about. Everytime we're together, we laugh & have the greatest time ever. We have other awesome friends too. It's so crazy how we're all so much alike..and yet, we're so different from a lot of other people. Carly's the sweetest ever...and just knowing she's there & care's about me is enough...and I have more than that..so I'm the most grateful happy guy there is. :) I've got the greatest best friend ever, I've got some other kick-ass awesome friends...and a billion other things that are going for me right now. I couldn't be happier and I wouldn't trade any of these moments for jack. And I know Carly loves me :D...not just cuz she says she does, cuz I know she does. She's the best. Just knowing Carly makes me want to be a better person. :) She's always going for what she wants & tries her best to get it & succeed. She's smart, beautiful, and my best friend. Plus, there's a billion other things about her, that make her who she is...:D Peace, Love & All Good Things ~ SiLaS

      So, here I sit this morning. Bored out of my mind. Breakfast is ready, and I'm not eating..yet. So what the crap am I supposed to say? I've always got a lot of things to say..and not a lot of ways to say them. Hmm. Let's start with an obvious. Life is so confusing. Don't you ever wonder if someone had told you life was this difficult that you would have gave up trying SO hard long ago? I don't mean give up completely, I mean just stop trying to impress everyone. Sure, our parents gave us this advice and they're always right. *Rolls Eyes Til They Get Stuck* If our parents were SO right about everything, they should be psychics. But, they're not. Well, maybe some of them are, but you know... And as if it's not bad enough with parents, you've got just regular everyday people making your life worse. Then you've got your WONDERFUL friends. I can honestly say, I've never had any better friends than I have right now. These people are so permanent and really care about what I'm saying and me. It's so cool when you don't have to ask a friend if they care, because you already know. You can feel it. I always have fun when I'm with my friends...I use to always feel like the outcast. The guy who had nothing to say. The guy who was afraid to speak up. Now you can't get me to shut up! But...just some thoughts for now. I didn't really know where this was getting me, but I got somewhere. Or maybe I didn't? I just rambled on about how life sucks, but what else is a guy like me supposed to do?  ~Love, Peace, & All Good Things~ SiLaS

      This week has been so boring & so lonesome. :( I went to my dad's for the 4th. Can we say ugh? How about UGH? I know I can. Nothing exciting at all. Well....uhm, no I guess not. lol After I left I went out to eat w/ my mom and Carly was there :D I missed her lots :) So...Thursday is my birthday. Can't wait! I have no idea what I'm gonna do. Can't expect much, I guess. I'm not feelin' this whole birthday thing anymore, really. I mean, by expecting, I mean...I don't expect to get anything out of being "16". Big deal is what I'm saying. It's just a number...and everybody else has already experienced it. lol...I'm all alone in that one, too. Tomorrow I'm babysitting my nephew...but...my mom is helping of course..so...woo! lol Thursday I wanna hang out w/ Carly before she leaves...hope it all works out. Cuz I'm gonna miss her while she's gone. :'( Everybody's leaving me this week. For real. I'm supposed to be leaving next weekend, but I think I'm staying. I guess something exciting is supposed to happen (RIGHT Carly! :P) But Carly will be back then & so will Megan so it's got to rock somehow. :) We've got to get our group back together: Carly, Josh, Megan, and me. :) I miss 'em all. We're kind of like...family...but not. haha It's crappy weather outside right now. Kinda. I hope it doesn't rain this week, especially on my birthday. My birthdays have always sucked, so I want this one to rock. Ugh...and I have to get a job soon...haha...Crazy. Not that I mind. Sort of. Anyhoo ~ I'm off.... *All of it* -- SiLaS

      So today was an interesting day, to say the least. Actually, it was boring, but...I'll say it was interesting so I won't be boring. I burned my finger today :( I was trying to cook. HaHa. Loser me :) Why are people so strange? Snuggles knows what I'm talking about :P lmao... I love havin' my Snuggles around. :) Last night I went out to eat with my mom, nephew, sister, her fiance and her fiance's dad. It was so weird. Just out of the blue at 7 o'clock at night, my sister called from her cell @ my house & asked my mom and I to meet them in town to eat. So we met them in town & went in to eat and everything. My sister and her fiance fight all the time. It's so annoying. They're both gonna be 20 soon and they act my age. I'm only gonna be 16...but I swear my sister's age and mine need to be switched. They argue for NO reason. Seriously. No reason at all. Everything's going fine then all of the sudden: boom, they start arguing. Why do people have to argue just because they're with someone? I don't mind going out with people...but I couldn't get that jealous about someone. If you're gonna be with someone you've got to have trust..or what have ya got? Exactly...not shit. Sometimes I feel like I've got this huge understanding in life...but just as I get that feeling it goes away. Someone proves me wrong. But it's cool. :) I'm fine..no complaints or whatever. So, tonight I'm hangin out w/ my favorite peeps...that'll be great as always. :) Friday nights are THE night. Oh, six days until my birthday! Woo! Big deal. lol...:D Birthday's are birthdays. After a while you get tired of them. I think I'm the one who makes a big deal out of it..and every year there's a disappointment. lol...This year's gonna be cool, though. It is. I know it is. If I want it to be cool, it's gonna be. Okay, anyway....I'm off to get ready so I can go with Carly. I'll write more later. ~SiLaS
