      if u tink s'pore is hot..then HK must be VERY, SERIOUSLY, HONESTLY  HOT ..like goodness, it's 35 degrees ??!! n it doesn't get any much cooler at nite..  i must say the service is gd though..my mum bargained for a wallet (dunno if it's gucci or christian dior, all the same to me newayz) from HK$150 to HK$70 in less than....30 seconds? it's lyk..HK$70..no-go?..fine, we're walking off..n b4 u noe it, the stallholder says 'ok'...i jus stared at my mum in disbelief n gave her the o-my-goodness-how-did-you-do-that look..i guess  good things do come cheap   k lar, hk's not tt bad..food's good, the MTR is very convenient, the harry potter posters in the MTR stations were beautiful (okok..out of point) the buses up n down the mountains are so fun..it felt like being in the Knight Bus n it certainly was "a bumpy ride"(okok, out of point again)..the airport was veri spacious but not as gd as singapore's in my opinion..yar..  after 4 days n 3 nites in HK..sorrie 2 say, but here's the conclusion:  i won't go to HK 4 the nxt 10 yrs, unless it's a free trip or sth..so yar..sorrie 2 my hk frens out there..but yar..    k tt's all 4 now..priscilla, OUT!
