      Ok well you know this whole week is Achievement tests and all well Hannah comes in and is soooooooooooo hyper!!!! Ok normal people just aren't that happy on this week....I love you girl!! No one like you!! Well today has come to be an over-all good day..I mean I thought that it was great and then it got mediocre and then it went waaaay uphill again...so yeah it was good.....OMG did you know that people think that Brittany Crosby and I look alike??? Hmm I thought that was intresting!! We're the next Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen!!! Aha I think it's funny...I was lookin in a magazine and saw them and I was like hey there's me and Brittany,mama, look there we are..aha just a funny moment but yeah some people just weren't in a good mood today.....And I mean maybe it's just me but I kept feelin like people were so mad at me and so I kinda just got depressed or liek there was something that they thought about me and wouldn't say anything about it and that kinda got annoying and I just wanted to go home but by 5th period when Mrs.Anderson called me "Sweetcheeks" in the middle of class I was just like ok never say that in a large class!!! B/c we were in there with a different class so that we wouldn't miss out any of the Romeo and Juliet stuff (Oh darn!!) But yeah and so now Colby calls me Sweetcheeks everytime that he sees me and I'm just like uggggh!!! But hey it's Colby so it's ok....He's already convinced me that I', stupid so who cares what he says aha....This past weekend Adam and I went down to the river and it was soooo much fun!!! Gah was it fun!!  But yeah I'm goin to eat now talk later!! Byebye!!!!

It all started at church tonight with this GREAT message and it really spoke to me adn made me think about sooooooo many things and I realized alot fo areas in my life that have GOT to change! adn then afterwards I got home and got on the internet of course and I started takling to a friend of mine and she's going through one of the suckiest times right now so please help me just pray for her that things will get better but one of the things that made me feel so good was that I was able to reach out to her adn make her feel better as a person just letting her know that I was ALWAYS going to be here for her and I think that's what alot of people these days lack...I mean my 7th grade year sucked jsut how hers had and then I finally founda couple of people that I could confide in adn my life got so much better..but please just pray for her............but anyways now to one of the greatest guys in my life!!!!! Garrett Barber!!!!!! ahah Just want to let you know that I love you!! and I'll always be here for you!! just as you have been for me!!! I've always been able to talk to you!

      So today was.....well It was ok but I've just been thinking about things and lately I don't really know what I want. I mean I know some things that I definatly want in life but I can't have like half of them. I guess I'll just take one thing at a time. I'm just so confused on so many situations right now. and half of them I wish I would have never gotten myself into.... why can't things be as simple as they are in fairy tales? They make life seem so fun adn easy to deal with and the girl always gets the guy of her dreams at the end and they live hapily ever after....I guess if life were like that it would be too easy..I don't know but I just want to say thank you to soo many of my good friends who have been there for me, You know who you are but I want to recognize you anyways.....Jenni Lynn, you are so awesome! No matter what comes into your life I am always here for you no matter what time call me whenever you need someone. I'm always here for you....Colby, wow where to start..gah you've always been there for me whenever U just had to get things out and I've told you so many things you prob. didn't wanna know aha and I know that I've let you down sometimes adn I'm so sry about that but I want you to know that I love you so much! Don't ever change....Brittany, we've SO had our ups and downs and lately you and I haven't talked like at all and I don't know what your deal is I mean I call you and you're always pissed off, I'm always here for you and you CAN talk to me, I've just been kinda worried about you lately and really want to talk to you so please if you read this then call me I love you like you were my sister,not that,even closer I really care about you and don't want you to get hurt....Adam!!! Gah, You are sooooooo awesome!! I don't knwo how to thank you enough...we've had so much fun ever since we met! aha you didn't knwo what you were getting yourself into once you asked me to come mudriding that time! aha that's great!........ I know that there are so many more people, but I gotta go now I'll write more next time or just maybe later on I love you soooo much!!! Have an awesome day! Turn to God in all your doubts and he will make you stronger!! Believe me He helps out alot whether you get your response right when you want it or later on down the road just wait everything will work out for the best... I love you bye!

      Wow!!! Tonight was soooooo much fun!!! I went to the movies with Cato!! Like there was supposed to be this like medium sized group but noone showed up so we had so much fun! We saw Shrek 2!!! Well, when we first get there my mom is kinda skeptical about leaving me with Austin b/c she just met him like last night and then so she made us sit there until we saw someone and she was askin him alll these questions and then out of the blue "So what do you want to be when you grow up??" He like busts out laughing! It was hilarious I was like please make her leave!!! So then she was like well I'm bored ya'll go on, I'm goin to Wal-Mart.. So then I was like I am SO sorry about that..He just laughed about it. It's kinda funny but I don't knwo I was thinkin the whole time he is never going to want to go somewhere with me again!! Aha we had fun in the movie..I was sittin there and he looked back and then was writing a text message so I'm thinkin hey he saw some people and he was gunna send it to them well her hands me the phone and told me to turn around so I did and there's these 2 people like ALLLL over each other I mean it was gross! but hey obviously they couldn't o it anywhere else so we let them be.....wel, then the movie ends and he saw some friends of his and was like uh oh Austin's on a date with a "hot little white chik" I was liek we aren't dating he goes oh you gotta friend? I was like uhhh no? then we jsut walked over to applebee's and ate and had more fun it was great except these people lied and said they were us so they got our table!! kinda funny in a way but hey guess they were really hungry ..who cares aha we had fun then I came home and he went to another movie with those guys so we had fun it was a blast! Look forward to more outings with Cato! It was great! He's a great guy he's hilarious! Gotta love him!! ok well bye!!

      Gah, this whole week has been so hard..just so many things have gone wrong..but last night was so much fun! I just didn't think about anything that had gone wrong and I had the most awesome night ever...ok,so I go to Brandon Day with Justin N. and had a blast! It was nothing but mud! I mean could it get any better? aha So we're walkin around barefoot in the mud and rode some rides and it was great! And then we saw Kelley, Natalie,Jacob, and Justin B. So we walked around with them the rest of the day and had so much fun...Well then I see my cousin so I went and hung out with him and his g/f and alot of his friends for the rest of the night (Austin, Andrew, Melissa, John, Shane, and I don't know the others) So I'm walkin around with Melissa for a little while b/c Tris.(cuz) was like a dog the whole night and went and got free cotton candy it was a funny have to be there moment and I saw this guy from like forever ago that I went to school with named Zach Polzin!! I was like whats your name? and He was like Zach and then I said OMG!!! And punched him on the arm and said I'm Ashley Nowell!!! He was like wow!! Really??? It was funny b/c at our old school Power APAC we saw each other everyday and he was short and stubby and I looked totally different and we called each other like every summer just to see what the other was doing and now he's tall and dark and looks pretty good...aha so then I just walked away with Melissa and we found Tristan and we went and rode the zipper..we were all 3 in there together gah it was hilarious we had so much fun so then we get back off the ride and I'm tlakin to Austin whose uncle or cousin one or the other is Luke Andres!! That's William's cousin!

      Today was just the weirdest day ever!! Mom is gunna be gone until late Sunday afternoon so therefore I'm stuck here at my Daddio's house....how much more boring can it get??? I mean seriously!! Somebody please save me!!! Today started off pretty ok..it was raining and I spent the night with Britt and then this morning she and I went to the Donut Shop for breakfast and Shane dropped by..I swear they can't get enough of each other!!! THey just saw each other last night!! and then again this morning!!! I can understand like on the weekends or something but on a school day seemed somewhat weird to me...maybe thats just me but yeah..aha anyways so we get to school she takes Raegan t oher class and we go to the Highschool and drop off the donuts for the Basketball Teams party thingymajig and then we went to class soaking wet basically aha but it was fun and so the day was just the greatest and then all of a sudden this "moody spell" hit me and whew there went my day..or so I thought.....I was just not a happy person throughout the end of 5th period 6th period 7th period and part of Driver's Ed. I don't know what it was I mean I just like had so many things pop into my head and I started thinking about all of them at once and thats just a hard concept aha so then I don't know I got happy again in Driver's Ed. b/c just some things couldn't have been more perfect....Colby was in there and I got my hug!! aha during one of the breaks...I was happy from there on out.. He's been really sweet to me lately which is definatly a good thing...aha he and I have been talking a heck of alot more and I'm opening up to him alot more now so that's another good thing well I was goin to go to the movies with them tonight to see Van Helsing but NOOOO my Dad said that he was too tired and was like tell them to come to Tinseltown it's closer! I was like no it's not then of course he went into this whole long drawn out thing explaining how it was closer or whatever I didn't listen to the majority of it...and then I just sat in his chair the rest of the time thinking "I could be at the movies right now with COLBY!!! but Noooo Daddy has to be a meanie!!!" so yeah ahha but hopefully he'll get on later on after the movie..I hope he does...well anyways I gotta go so I'll talk later on!!! today has just been so eventful aha there's alot more but I think it's long enough for now aha Love you!!! Bye!

      Allrighty, well lately things have been so weird up and down up and down but I don't know I've been spoken to ALOT through this whole situation...well anyways today was just great It started off awesome!!!! then in 5th period I just went through this whole depressing stage adn I don't have a clue why I just know that I'm moody aha but anyways back to today I was just soooo hyper when I got to school and everything was going so great and then once 5th period came I was so freakin quiet I just had nothing at all to say and then 6th it was about the same but then 7th came around with COLBY and Stephen......WOW those guys are GREAT!! They always make me smile and make my day better.....I love em to death.... Gah lately God has spoken to me so much and I'm acctually being able to figure out the things I need to do with life I mean ok I've been single now for like 7months! Wow that's basically a record for me I mean I've always had some odd guy there that I was dating and now I look back on some of them and regret them but hey that was the past......I figured out that God is showing me that I don't HAVE to have a guy I mean yeah they are great and all but I don't have to have one there for me all the time I can just be best friends with them without having to be there girlfriend I mean Colby is my BEST guy friend!! and so is Adam and Matthew I mean I love them all to death and they all have always been there for me adn I mean just to put the spotlight on Colby for a little while I mean he adn I dated like 3 times and it was truly special and I loved him and all and thoguht it would never end but then it did all 3 times and he's ALWAYS been there for me to just go and talk to about ANYTHING! I mean I've told him things that I would tell just anybody and I don't know he's just so awesome and I've mis-treated him so many times ans now I realize that but he's ALWAYS forgiven me!! I mean honestly if I were him I would just hate my guts but he's always forgiven me and tried to helo me move forward in life and just being able to open up to him makes things so awesome! And to be totally honest I'm really starting to like him ALOT again but I don't wanna just jump into it I wanna take things a little slow if we do start dating b/c if you go too fast in a relationship that just ruins the whole thing and then eventually you get sick of each other  where-as if you take it slow then there's more to look forward to in hte future plus it brings you closer and easier to talk to each other...but yeah that's a little more then a tad but about him but I mean thats just how awesome of a guy he is he makes me smile when i'm having a horrible day and i can tell him anything and he is just great. He makes me laugh alot except when he makes fun of me then I just feel stupid but hey thats ok everybody just needs to learn to laugh at themselves every once and a while. Over-all he's just made me a happier person and I love him to death. I love you Colby! anyways this is pretty long and so I'll write later on I love you alll soooooooooo much!!!!!!! byebye

      Ok well lately I've had plenty of time to just sit and think about things.......well I've realized how much I take for granted in life...I mean lately sooo many good things have been happening and some bad things here and there but I haven't let them get me down.....b/c I mean life would be too perfect for EVERYTHING to be goin right you know?? And I'd rather some different things to be goin wrong but you know I can't really decide on all of it.....but ok well Austin Cato and I are in this fight and I mean I've told him I'm sry and everything and I have NO clue what else to do to make it better...I mean I love him to death as a friend! and just I don't know it bothers me that he and I aren't talkin....and then twice I've really messed up..I don't want to go into detail about those but they're getting better slowly but it's not going quick enough!!!.....then I got some pictures back last night I was just kinda goin through em over and over and couldn't get enough of em....I love em! aha but they were of mainly me and Jenni Lynn....gah she's SUCH a great friend! I mean she's ALWAYS been there for me and then I got to thinking...where would I be now if she hadn't come into my life?? I mean honestly she's like the only girl-friend that I have that I would trust with anything and would just tell my entire life to! I mean I was sittin there thinkin about like the future ahha and I was takin this quiz and I sent it to just her and well alot of my answers were based towards her...and I mean she's like a sister to me...I can tell her anything and everything... I love her soooo much! and I mean when she and I are together....we are SOOO weird!! ahha It's really funny! aha I mean we can just be ourselves and can let everything out! I mean the true me...only Jenni knows that girl....I wish everyone did but it's hard to always just be yourself but I've set a new goal for myself...."I am my own hero and I'm reachin for the stars"....so I mean I don't know life is great and I'm hopin it'll stay this way although I know there will be some hard times along hte way but hey I have Jenni and with Jenni and God I can get through anything.....I love you so much Jenni Lynn Tabb!! You're the bestest!!! Here comes Elroy!! ahhah Love you!! BFF!!!!
