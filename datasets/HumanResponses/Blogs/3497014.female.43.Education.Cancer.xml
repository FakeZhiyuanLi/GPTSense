						   OK, so let's address some of the things that I know people will say to the idea that religion and science are (or should be) pursuing the same end.  Many people of faith find science threatening, because it suggests a lack of faith.  In other words, you ought to be able to believe without proof.  (After all, isn't that what Christ said to Thomas?  "You believe, Thomas, because you have seen; blessed are those who believe who have not seen.")  True enough.  But in my view, faith is that which you hold on to while you are seeking proof.  And when I say "you," I mean the human race.  As I intend to discuss herein, many of the things that we have been admonished to do - and not to do - as a matter of faith or religious belief, turn out to be firmly grounded in science.  Over the hundreds or thousands of years that passed before those things could be proven, faith in the rightness of those admonitions kept people healthy and society strong.  By contrast, there are those in the scientific community that look upon everything that cannot be proven (now, yet) as mere superstition.  It is this, more so than anything else, that brands Christians and other believers as "ignorant," "backward," "stupid," etc.  But there is a critical difference between faith and superstition.  "Faith" is a belief in things that (in theory) CAN be proven, but which have not YET been proven.  "Superstition" is belief in things that can be (and/or have been) DISPROVEN.  Big difference.  Thus, there is no inconsistency between being a person of faith and a person of science.  Indeed, even in purely secular matters, there are scientists who pursue their theories despite their colleagues' insistence that their research is pointless, or futile.  In the absence of proof, what keeps these vigourously curious men and women going, if not a form of faith?  What I hope to do here, is to arm persons of faith with the scientific and rational support for some of the views they espouse.  In the arguments about issues we face in the present day, the more support one has, the better.  To a lesser extent, I hope that the scientific skeptic who finds himself or herself visiting this site might be able to admit of the possible existence of spiritual realities, the proof for which we simply don't have at present.  We shall see.  More tomorrow! /Prairy P.

						   Hello, and welcome to SPRT -  Science in Pursuit of Religious Truth .  That's the name of this blog, and here's our slogan:  "The only thing keeping you from seeing SPIRIT here is two i's."  Rather catchy, huh?  It just came to me a couple of weeks ago, and I decided it was worthy of a blogspot.  Let me tell you a little bit about what this weblog is for.  The name may sound counterintuitive, but it is born of my own personal experiences.  As an educated woman, an attorney, a professor, and a free-lance writer, I have often found myself struggling to explain and justify Christian (and Catholic) positions on various issues on the basis of science, rather than tenets of any particular religious faith.  I've always been amazed - and disappointed - at the "conflict" between science and religion.  Why should these two be at odds with each other?  My thought is, if, as we believe, God is the Creator of all things, then God is also the author of the systems by which all things work.  From gravity to psychology to nuclear physics, God would be behind it all.  To seek the truth, then, through science, is a profoundly religious quest.  And to test the validity of religious beliefs through the scientific method is neither blasphemously skeptical nor an expression of impermissible doubt.  Instead, it is utilizing the faculties that God gave us.  Any religion that claims to have the truth should embrace science, not fear it.  For to find truth is to find God.  If the beliefs of a particular religion cannot withstand scientific scrutiny, then those beliefs will of necessity be discarded, or else the religion itself will eventually wither and die.    (Galileo's proof that the earth revolves around the sun - and not the other way around - comes to mind immediately.  The Catholic Church excommunicated him for this.  But it was proven to be true.  And lo and behold, the Catholic Church survived this "revelation".)  Religions that depend upon their members remaining uneducated or ignorant cannot survive.  Humans cannot remain deliberately ignorant indefinitely.  It is against our nature.  Our Created nature.  I can already hear the heated objections of the scientific skeptics and the believers.  And I intend to argue my points against these objections, one by one.  Additionally, I intend to use this weblog as a place to find scientific evidence in support of positions taken by those of religious faith on social, moral, legal and political issues wherever possible.  I have a number of thoughts that I intend to post later tonight - or perhaps tomorrow.  But this is enough for now.  In closing my very first weblog posting, I welcome all persons of good cheer, benevolent intent, and sincere intellectual curiosity, whether you consider yourselves to be persons of faith or not.  More later! /Prairy P.

						   I still haven't finished part II of my earlier blog, entitled, "Who Do You Work For, Good Or Evil?  And How to Tell..."  But if you've read that far, you know that I've said your first test is whether or not you are telling the truth.  Good has nothing to hide; evil always does.  So, telling the truth is the best indicator of who you're working for.  As the title of this weblog indicates, my objective here is to find scientific support for beliefs, conduct, moral values, etc., that are considered to be purely "religious."  And I maintain that one need only look for the truth to find this support.  Science should be firmly on the side of truth.    In matters of life - and abortion - it is.  The more people who find out the scientific truths about conception, pregnancy, gestation and fetal development in the womb, the more they reject the lies that the death advocates pump into the public consciousness.  They refer to themselves as "pro-choice," but like everything else, this is demonstrably untrue; they systematically and categorically oppose any and all efforts to get more information into the hands of pregnant women considering abortion.  But truth never sleeps, and science marches on.  In that vein, let's get some good news out on the table right away.  There is a news article in the BBC today about a new ultrasound scanning technique that shows elaborate three-dimensional images of unborn babies in the womb.  Here is the link to the story:  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3846525.stm    As a follow-up, if you'd like to see some of these images, here is another BBC link:   urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/3847319.stm   These photos show quite clearly that unborn babies in the first trimester have what the story called "complex behaviors": they yawn, stretch, swim, "walk."  Weeks earlier than doctors originally thought, we now know that babies in utero can open their eyes.  Doctors have believed that infants could not smile until weeks after birth, and yet the photos produced by the London researcher show babies smiling in the womb.  Widespread access to this technology would - and WILL - have a dramatic impact on women considering abortion, especially those who continue to believe the lie that it's "just a clump of tissue" or "a mass of cells."  (Ok, who ISN'T a 'mass of cells'?)  Abortion advocates will oppose the access to this technology.  Indeed, with their characteristic deceit, they already have.  Alison Herwitt, the Director of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in response to a proposed bill that would distribute these "4D Ultrasound" machines to crisis pregnancy centers all over the country, was quoted as saying, "They don't want women to go to Planned Parenthood, where they'll get their full range of options. They just want them to go to crisis pregnancy centers, where women will be exposed to this weapon at taxpayers' expense."  Fascinating.  A curette, a suction vacuum tube, a pair of Metzenbaum scissors are just "choices."  But a picture of a baby sucking her thumb in utero is a "weapon"?  Well, if the truth is a "weapon," then so be it.  Let's face it.  Abortion advocates  cannot  tell the truth.  They have to lie, dissemble, obfuscate, and (when all of that fails) scream obscenities to deflect attention away from what abortion really is.  The callous and gruesome testimony [much more on this later] of abortion "doctors" in the recent federal cases challenging the Partial-Birth Abortion Act stands as the best evidence of what they are really doing - butchering tiny human beings by the millions, not only in that particular procedure, but in  all  abortions.  Which is precisely what they are afraid the public will find out.  So they lie.  Here are just a few examples ...  The "pro-choice" movement says that the PBA Act is unlawful because it gets in the way of a decision that should be made by a woman and her doctor.  Their first line of attack has been to say that the procedure is sometimes "medically necessary."  Lie.  Members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have testified before Congress and in federal cases that this procedure is  never  "medically necessary."  Then, they argue that so-called "partial-birth abortions" (the official name is "dilation and extraction") are "safer."    This is not exactly a lie.  But it nevertheless begs the question: safer than  what?   This is a harder question to find the answer to, because  they don't want you to know.   They never tell you.  Unless, of course, they are asked under oath and forced by Congress or a judge to answer.  The answer is, "safer" than the usual methods of abortion at that stage.  The usual methods of dilation and curettage involve dilating the cervix and ripping the unborn baby's body to pieces with a sharp curved blade called a curette.  In the second trimester and later, the baby's body is more fully developed - the cartilege, bones and tendons are tougher to cut, and in addition to the butchery of the unborn child that is going on during this procedure, there are apparently risks of (amongst other things) perforation of the woman's uterus from bone fragments, and infection from piece of the baby's body that could be left behind - a real risk, since the doctors cannot really "see" what they are doing.  Obviously, this is not a problem if the doctor pulls the baby's body nearly completely out of the woman's body, pierces its skull with a pair of Metzenbaum scissors, vacuum suctions out its brains, crushes its skull and then pulls the dead baby all the way out.  Much safer.  Unless, of course, you're on the receiving end of the scissors.  More lies.  The "pro-choice" advocates scream about the Partial-Birth Abortion Act that its advocates are simply maneuvering to "take all abortion away from women."  But what they are  really  afraid of is that by virtue of the testimony in the cases  they themselves filed , women will find out what goes on  in the other abortion procedures; in the abortion procedures in the first and early second trimesters.     Because as soon as women find this out, they may not make the choice for abortion.  If you consider yourself pro-choice, don't you find it curious that the so-called "pro-choice" movement doesn't want you to have any information about abortion except for its availability?  Don't they have any confidence in your ability to make an  informed  choice?  If they are all in favor of choice, why do they oppose informed choices?  If truth is on their side, why are they so afraid of it?  (1)  Doctors - even "pro-choice" doctors - have demonostrated a link between abortion and breast cancer.  Lawmakers try to pass laws requiring doctors to inform their patients about these risks.  "Pro-choice" advocates oppose this.  (2)  Lawmakers attempt to pass laws requiring a minimal waiting period, so that women will consider the decision they are making, which is permanent, irreversable, and fatal.  Thounsands of women attest to the regrets they have about their abortions.  Who could oppose taking 24 hours to consider taking the life of your unborn child?  "Pro-choice" advocates, who say, "women don't need any more time."  (3)  If "every child should be a wanted child," as "pro-choice" advocates claim, then there should be punishment for killing a wanted child, should there not?  And yet, when Congress was endeavoring to pass the Unborn Victims of Violence Act ("Laci and Connor's Law"), "pro-choice" advocates opposed it.  So, the "pro-choice" advocates oppose any and all information, laws or technologies that might provide women with:  (a)  information about what their unborn children really are, can do, look like in the womb;  (b)  facts about what is really being done to these children in the name of "choice";  (c)  time to consider the decision to take the lives of their unborn children  (d)  punishment for those who commit acts of domestic or random violence that take the life of their unborn child.  And these people claim they're for "choice"?  As I said above, demonstrably untrue.  Oh, but this latest technology will throw an even bigger wrench into their works.  If you go to this link:   urlLink http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/03/special/politics/sp_politics_herwitt060503.htm   You will be able to read the transcipt of an online interview with Alison Herwitt of NARAL Pro-Choice America.  In this discussion, she says, "When considering this debate, it's important to remember that most abortions happen very early in pregnancy. Ninety-nine percent take place before the 20th week."  The 20th week is halfway through the pregnancy, and two months into the second trimester.  These are the abortions that Herwitt and others want the public to believe are less troublesome than the nasty, gory, bloody, ugly partial-birth abortion that is the subject of so much debate at present.  But, as I indicated, it is precisely because the advocates of death do NOT want anyone to know what happens during  any  abortion that they dissemble on these issues.  "Dilation and extraction almost never happens," they say (as if that somehow makes it acceptable).  "It's dilation and curettage that is used 99% of the time."  So - go take a look at the 4D Ultrasound pictures in the BBC article above.  Then ask yourself - is it any less bloody, gory, gruesome, monstrous or murderous to take a curved blade to those tiny babies in utero and cut them apart limb from limb?  Of course not.  But you don't have to take my word for it.  The proof is right there before your eyes.  And that's the scientific truth.

						   Here is an article some of you may find interesting...    urlLink http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/1684_0_2_0_C/    I saw the Oprah show in question.  (I hasten to add that I never watch Oprah, but I was at my health club on the treadmill, and it was on.)  The description is right on the money.  Isn't this great?  Someone or something creates a sense of sexual or gender confusion in your child, and instead of getting to the bottom of the trauma/problem, you'll have government officials, school administrators and media celebrities advocating that you get your child a sex-change operation.  (And here I thought it was rather scandalous that people are buying their teenage daughters boob jobs!)  Watching the show, it was so clear how desperate the parents were.  They would believe and do anything at that point.  Those of you with your children in public schools had better pay close attention to what they are being taught.  Not what they tell you they are teaching the children; what is actually in the materials themselves.  And what those who write and espouse these materials really have as their primary objectives.  It is not education, it is indoctrination, brainwashing and yes, recruitment.  Sad, but true.  And we have proof, although no one wants to talk about it.   "Sex education," as it has been called in this country in the public schools for the past 30 years, has produced little besides precocious promiscuity, teen pregnancy and abortions, the rapid spread of STD's among teenagers, and a staggering rise of infertility in women in their 20's and 30's that is directly related to sex with multiple partners at a young age.  (When was the last time you read an article by an OB-GYN describing this?  But it is true, nevertheless...)   It was bad enough when these self-proclaimed experts were arguing in favor of distributing condoms and demonstrating their use to high schools students.  Remember that at the time (and still today), the argument was that, "They are doing it anyway, so we need to teach them how to do it safely."  Uh-huh.  Sure.  And now, it has moved to middle school.  And why?  Because, of course, "they are doing it anyway."  How many of us have NOT heard a horror story of an 8th grade co-ed party involving alcohol and fellatio (just to give one example), or the exploitative sexual experimentation that someone comes across in a public school bathroom?  (If you haven't heard anything like this yet, you are either very lucky, you have no friends with middle-school-age children, or you live in the woods and homeschool your children.)   If "they are doing it anyway," it is because they live in a culture that does nothing but advocate irresponsible sexual conduct, and then abortion to pick up the pieces (if you will excuse the extremely ugly and unintended pun).  Isn't it ironic that all across the country, middle-school-age children are engaging in oral sex, and telling those who catch them in the act, "we thought it wasn't sex"?  Remember where that one came from?   In the 1960's and 70's, the "sexual revolution" was for adults and college students.  But that wasn't enough.  In the 1970's, and 80's it was high school students.  But that wasn't enough.  In the 90's and today, this insidious mindset has moved into middle school.     And they will not stop there.  As those on the Oprah show and the sex education experts touting gay marriage themselves argue, it is time to move into the grade schools.   What I am telling you, my friends, is that there are people out there with their sexual sights set on your children - the younger the better - and if you think this isn't true, you are deluding yourselves.  It is NOT about educating them or making them "safe," despite all that obfuscating blather to the contrary.  (Check out the journal Paedika if you don't believe me or think I am exaggerating.  That is, if you can stomach knowing what the paedophiles' social and political agenda really is.)  It is about increasing social tolerance for deviant and destructive conduct by indoctrinating the youngest among us.  You may say, and with good reason, that this does not describe  your  beloved teachers, or  your  trusted administrators.  But if  your  beloved teachers or  your  trusted administrators buy into the whole, "they're doing it anyway, so now we have to teach them how to do it safely," or "we have to teach them not to discriminate," shtick, then they are the sexual predators' and social "engineers" unwitting pawns.   You cannot depend upon the schools to keep your children safe.  You have to do it yourself.  We all do.  And it is getting to the point where  school  is what we have to keep them safe from.  God help us.

						   I am still working on Part II of the "Who Do You Work For?"  blog.  The rest will come.  But in the meantime, I have other things to say.  As you can tell if you've read what I have written so far, it's clear that I am setting up a scientific argument in opposition to abortion.  Or, more specifically, an argument that demonstrates that the theological arguments opposing abortion have a scientific basis.  So, with that in mind, any chance I get to write something about abortion, I will do.  With that in mind, here's today's post:  I always read Ben Shapiro's columns on www.townhall.com.  (Actually I read ALL of the columns on TownHall.com.  Even Bruce Bartlett's.)  And I am constantly impressed with his cogent analyses.  So impressive for someone so young!  His  urlLink recent column  , posted today (June 16, 2004) on TownHall, piqued my interest.  Please read his article.  Here is my response...  Dear Mr. Shapiro:  I am an administrator and lecturer in law at [a university somewhere in the midwest], I appreciated your recent column on the issues that the American Jewish population needs to address and be realistic about.  As a Roman Catholic and a strong Israel supporter, I was gladdened to see an Orthodox writer speak out for the support American Christians give to Israel and the Jewish faith generally.  I was also glad to see one Jewish person tell so many others that the political party American Jews seem best to identify with - the Democratic Party - has long since abandoned the principles that drew people to it in the early part of the 20th century.  But the problem, it seems to me, is in the distinction between persons practicing the Jewish faith, and those who have identified themselves as "cultural Jews," (as my non-practicing Jewish colleagues have termed it to me).    I feel as if I am watching the same sort of divide take place among Jews in America as I am seeing among Roman Catholics.  There are those who continue to adhere to precepts that are thousands of years old, which take their meaning from Scripture.  And then there are those who want to define their beliefs for themselves, even when this means accepting conduct that is abhorrent and clearly contrary to common decency - much less Scripture.  There are any number of examples, but I am referring specifically to abortion.  As you know, the official position of the Roman Catholic church is and always has been in opposition to abortion; that it is a grave evil, justifiable only when so doing would be necessary to save the life of the mother (which is extraordinarily rare).  But many Catholics are abandoning this position, calling for "choice."  How many other Christian church leaders/members are still staying strong on this position?  Many of the mainstream Protestant denominations are going to an official or unofficial "pro-choice" position.  Where is the Jewish leadership on this issue?  Where is the American Jewish voice on this issue?  What is profoundly disturbing to me is to see the number of American Jews who are intimately, integrally, visibly, vocally involved in the abortion business.  How many ACLU lawyers suing on behalf of Planned Parenthood are Jewish?  How many abortion practitioners, or clinic owners?  How many so-called "feminist", pro-abortion spokespersons?  (At least, as they might say, "culturally.")  This is heartbreaking to me, to see so many of the children of Abraham; so many who have inherited the mantle of Holocaust survivors, bathed in the blood of innocent unborn children.  Abortion is America's holocaust; where are the Jewish voices decrying it?  There are some, thank goodness.  You and Dennis Prager, just to name two.  I receive the World Jewish Digest (based out of Chicago) and read it faithfully - there are many Jewish commentators in it who support life.  But on the whole, it appears that far too many American Jews - whether because of their loyalty to the Democratic Party (which has become a one-issue party; they will brook NO disagreement on the abortion issue), or for some other reason - seem not only comfortable with the deaths of 40+ million unborn children, but committed to it.  I hope, Mr. Shapiro, that you will continue your vigilance on this issue, as well as the others you address so articulately.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, [my name]

						   All of the recent legal activity surrounding the Partial Birth Abortion Act has had me thinking.  (I am a lawyer and a professor; I think about things for a living...)  Abortion is bad law because it is bad science.  And of course, because it is bad science, it is horrendously bad morality.  It is evil, pure and simple.  And in my opinion, it is the  single greatest evil facing American civilization.   Yes, worse than poverty, worse than illiteracy, worse than racism or discrimination - all of which abortion supporters throw up as straw men to distract from the real, more basic issue.  And none of which even become relevant unless one is allowed to live.  You can bring yourself out of poverty.  You can overcome discriminatory preconceived notions others have about you, your race, your color, your culture.  But you can't do any of this if you are dead.  The writers of our Declaration of Independence knew this, and said so explicitly.  That is why the Declaration of Independence says,  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness..."   Note how this has been phrased:  1)  "We hold these truths to be  self-evident "  In other words, the rights that are described in the D/I are not subject to debate and not in need of proof.  The writers wanted to eliminate the possibility that anyone could come behind them and argue that some people are  not  entitled to life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness.  2)  "... that all men are endowed by their Creator..."  "Men" here means mankind, despite what some have tried to argue.  And the fact that the rights articulated in the D/I are "endowed" by a "Creator" means that we are not permitted to take these rights away from other people without grave justifications.  Furthermore, note that although the writers mention a "Creator," they do not name any specific deity.  Whether they believe in one (or many) or not, all persons are deemed to have these same rights and protections.  3)  " ... and  among these ..."  This is terribly significant, and often overlooked.  Lawyers use language like this a lot.  This is to say that the rights articulated (in this case, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness) are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all of the rights to which human beings are entitled; merely that these are the most important ones we can identify at the moment.  4)  "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  The order here is critical.  LIFE IS FIRST.  Liberty is second.  And neither the Declaration of Independence nor any other document or law guarantees happiness.  But the D/I at least acknowledges that we have the right to  pursue  it.  As long, of course, as in so doing, we are not infringing someone else's right to life, or liberty.  The writers of the Declaration of Independence maintained that the above statements are TRUE.  It stands to reason, then, that the test of whether a law is a good one or a bad one, depends upon whether it is consistent with this TRUTH; with the nature of humanity and the proper role of government.    In law, as with every other science, the objective should be the pursuit of TRUTH.  And to pursue the TRUTH is to pursue God, whether that is one's intention or not.  So, in order to answer the question, "Who do you work for?" the first thing you need to ask yourself is whether you are telling the truth.  More about this in Part 2.  /Prairy P.

						   I received a lovely, thoughtful response to my second post.  Many thanks to that first visitor!  They identify themselves only as Simple Simon.  Here is what they said:  ****************  At 12:33 PM, Simple Simon said...  "I don't want to call into question the entire premise of your forum here, but where do you go in your specific pursuit if your faith leads you to the conclusion that, with the appropriate faith, you can suspend the laws of nature and science -- (to quote Christ) with faith the size of a mustard seed you can ask a mountain to get up and move and it will obey you?  If a law of science that is discovered or proven in 2004 confirms the faith held by people for 2,000 years, and then a prophet or other messenger of God asks God to suspend that scientific law for some purpose (say conversion) and God grants the prayer, then what is the ultimate value of the particular scientific law in your ultimate pursuit?  Have you considered whether it is an unproven scientific fact that all laws of science can be suspended with the appropriate faith?"  /Simple Simon  *****************  And here is my response...  Dear Simple Simon: I suspect that many who might visit here would call into question the entire premise of this weblog.  That's okay.  I do not have a simple (if you'll excuse the expression) answer to your query.  But what I'll try to do here is to craft an answer consistent with my theory that science and religion can be reconciled.  I don't purport to be able to translate Christ, but it has often occurred to me that much of what He said two thousand years ago has a scientific foundation that is demonstrable today.  Take, for example, His statement that "the sins of the fathers will be visited upon the sons until the fifth generation." This statement disturbed me profoundly as a child.  I could not understand why God would punish children for things their parents or grandparents did.  Later, when I was studying psychology in college, I came across the established research showing that children who are abused are much more likely to become abusers themselves.  Just to use one example.  What if Christ was not making a statement about God's punishment, therefore, as much as he was telling us about human nature?  It would seem to be an admonition to (amongst other things) raise our children properly, to avoid the emotional damage and psychological disease that could take generations to eradicate.  According to my theory, Christ would not have told the people of that era anything about human psychology, or the "hard-wiring" of the neural network in a child's brain, or behavioral patterning - this would have made no sense to them.. What he COULD do, however, was to put it in terms that they could understand - sin.  His phraseology is significant, to that end.  He says, "the sins of the fathers will be visited upon the sons."  It is a statement in passive voice.  He speaks of an  effect.   Christ does this in other places as well.  Recall the story where the crowd brings a crippled man to Christ. (I am going to have to paraphrase here…)  He says to the man, “Rise – your sins are forgiven.”  The crowd begins to mutter in astonishment, and Christ hears them saying things like, “Who is this man, that he thinks he can forgive sins?”  And Christ says to the crowd and to the man, “Which is easier, to say ‘your sins are forgiven’ or ‘take up your bed and walk’?  But, so you will understand that I have the power to forgive sins,  Rise – take up your bed and walk – your sins are forgiven.”   And of course, the man does in fact pick up his mat and leave the crowd on his own two legs.  Thus does Christ show us the connection between the spiritual and the physical.  The people gathered there cannot understand how a “sin” – which is unseen – can be forgiven.  They can, however, see the “miracle” of a man physically cured of a visible disability.  By showing them things they can see, Christ wants to get them to believe in the things they cannot see.  So, let us turn to your quote about having faith the size of a mustard seed, and moving mountains with it.  Is Christ speaking literally?  Is He speaking metaphorically?  Is He using terms or expressions that make sense in the context of the culture in which He appeared, but which we might understand differently?  My short answer to your question would be that if "faith" can "suspend" natural laws (or science, as we know it), then there is some scientifically demonstrable scientific law behind that suspension that we do not yet understand.  Some of Christ’s other comments are instructional in this regard.  He says in one place, “All things will be revealed,” and in another, “Be not afraid.”  And how many times does He say, “Love one another”?  We must put ourselves in the position that Christ’s contemporaries were in.  Would they have thought it was possible for hundreds of thousands of pounds of steel and fuel to fly?  What would they have thought if they had seen a commercial airliner?  And if a “prophet” in their day were to have said to them, “Believe!  If you only have faith the size of a mustard seed, you shall one day be able to fly like birds” would this not have sounded like an absurdity?  Would people not have fallen into two groups – those who thought this “prophet” was mad, and those who thought that flying was physically impossible, but with enough “faith,” they could do it anyway?  But both groups would have been wrong.  Flying isn’t physically impossible.  Two thousand years later we see it every day, and do not much marvel at it, because we understand aerodynamics.  How many other commonplace things in our culture would the people of Christ’s time have thought were suspensions of “natural law”?  Laser surgery?  Space flight?  Antibiotics?  Robotic machinery?  Roller-ball pens?    Never did Christ say that our faith was to be separated from our study.  Did he ever tell the scholars in the temples not to study?  Or the doctors to stop trying to heal their sick patients?  To come back to the present day, then, is it not plausible that there are phenomena today that we do not understand, only because we still do not have the technology to see, identify, measure them?  I would draw your attention to recent studies that have been discussed extensively in the medical community, looking at the effect of prayer on healing.  These studies compared the healing and cure rates of patients who were not being prayed for by others, with rates for patients who WERE being prayed for.  The study's results were interesting in at least two respects:   First, the patients who were being prayed for healed faster or were cured at a higher rate than those who were not being prayed for.  And secondly, this was true even when the patients DID NOT KNOW they were being prayed for, and when those praying for them were at a great distance (physically) from them.  We have just begun to scratch the surface of things like nanotechnology and the study of different types of energies.  What will the future bring in these sciences?  Isn’t it possible that the things we call “miracles” today – inexplicable things like spiritual healing, or extra-sensory perception are just types of energy, the properties and functions of which we do not understand?  I want to be clear about what I am not saying.  I am not saying that if something is explicable, then there is no God, or that Jesus Christ was just a really nice man.  To me it is not inconsistent to believe that God would take human form to show us who He is, who we are, what we are capable of, meant for, and that death is not the end.  Would I be skeptical of anyone who claimed to be a messenger of God, and who wanted to show it with “signs?”  Yes.  Would I pay attention to what he or she said and did?  Of course.  “By their deeds ye shall know them.”  My standard operating line in this regard is that God gave me a brain and He expects me to use it.  You must use your brain  and  your heart.  Faith and reason.   Fides et ratio.   A thousand years from now, we may be able to heal with a touch, as Christ did.  We may be able to move large objects with our mere thought.  If we believe.  If we are not afraid.  If we love one another.  And if we don’t destroy each other first.  Particularly in the name of our religions – a fate looming before us these days.  But that is a blog for another day.  And that’s My Take On Things.  ******************  On a completely different note, I have much to say about recent events.  I hope to start blogging about those this weekend.  More later! /Prairy P.

						    I haven't had much time to blog lately.&nbsp; A busy one-year-old doesn't leave much time!&nbsp; And yet I wouldn't change it for the world.&nbsp; In fact, when we first got pregnant, I had hoped for twins.&nbsp; Oh, I knew first-hand how much more work that would be - my sister has twin boys.&nbsp; I have always referred to them as "a baby and a buddy."&nbsp; They seemed to come into the world pre-packaged with a friend for life.&nbsp; How lucky for them!&nbsp; And how lucky for their mom and dad.  Seems rather&nbsp;appropriate to start with that this morning, as I address the article "everyone's talking about" - the cold, calculating and murderous admissions of the (now) infamous Amy Richards in the New York Times a few days ago.&nbsp; You all know the story - she got pregnant with triplets - a set of twins and a "stand-alone" and opted to abort the twins and carry the third baby to term.&nbsp;&nbsp;The article is an abomination.&nbsp; Richards expresses no hesitation, no regret, no remorse.&nbsp; If she has any grasp of her others childrens' possibilities as human beings, there is no proof of it in her writing.&nbsp; Her tone throughout is whiny, smug, defiant and callous.  Her castrated boyfriend seemed to want all three children, but she dismissed that possibility out of hand, hissing that that would condemn her to a life buying big jars of mayonnaise at Costco.&nbsp; (I frankly think this whole article is an insult to Costco, and if I were the President of that company, I'd go on record saying so.)&nbsp;   Isn't that just peachy?&nbsp; A father has no rights - only responsibilities.&nbsp; He wants his children.&nbsp; But the woman's "choice" trumps everything else.&nbsp; But why should this surprise us?&nbsp; If these two childrens'  lives  don't prevail against her bodily discomfort and inconvenience (however severe), why on earth would a father's interest in his own sons andor daughters mean anything?  I can't add anything meaningful to the chorus of horrified voices that have spoken out about Ms. Richards' actions.&nbsp; But I do have a different perspective that I would like to add.  Does anyone wonder  why  The New York Times published this piece?&nbsp; Does anyone wonder why on earth Richards-the-Baby-Butcher wrote it?&nbsp; If abortion is supposed to be this deeply private decision between a woman and her doctor (*chortle, snort, cough, gag*), then why the hell does a women choose to publish that story in one of the most widely-circulated newspapers in the world?  Is it just because controversial stories sell more papers?&nbsp; I don't believe that for a second.&nbsp; Is it to provoke the ire of pro-lifers everywhere?&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Pro-lifers already oppose abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;And even&nbsp;under dire circumstances, such as the (admittedly rare) conception resulting from rape, or a severely-deformed child, the most consistent among us still maintain that abortion is the wrong response; that&nbsp;you don't punish a child for his or her father's sins; that&nbsp;you don't destroy a human being because he or she is less than&nbsp;"perfect."&nbsp; How much more, then, would your garden-variety pro-life American cringe at this story?  No, the purpose of the story is to create support for poor, poor Ms. Richards.&nbsp; And yet I wonder if it won't create precisely the opposite reaction.  In that vein, it's interesting to note what  urlLink poll after poll  is showing these days - that more Americans think abortion ought to be more limited than it is.&nbsp; Some polls show that a majority of Americans think abortion should be illegal after 20 weeks (or "viability," the definition of which continues to be earlier in the pregnancy, thanks to technological advances).&nbsp; And overwhelmingly, Americans do not support abortion for whimsical reasons like sex selection, or for minor problems like cleft palate.  But - even in these polls, the results seem to indicate that a majority of Americans are uncomfortable criminalizing or outlawing abortion in all cases - or very early in the first trimester.&nbsp; ( urlLink New advances in ultrasound technology  may change that collective view, as well.)  The point is that even the majority of those Americans who consider themselves "pro-choice" have limited - and even conflicted - support for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if you look at polls conducted over the past five years or so, increasing numbers of Americans oppose abortion in ever greater circumstances.&nbsp; And this is  in spite of  abortion's easy availability.  This terrifies the hard-line pro-abortion movement.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have always wanted complete support for abortion on demand for all 40 weeks of pregnancy.&nbsp; Knowing full well that they would not get this right away, they started with the "hard cases" - rape and incest.&nbsp; Then, it was for deformed or otherwise "imperfect" children.&nbsp; (After all, who would mandate such a hardship as caring for a "special-needs" child?)&nbsp; And whenever a child (or more than one child) would cause a possible detriment to a mother's health.&nbsp; Including, of course, "mental health."&nbsp; Or personal inconvenience.&nbsp; And then they threw the lovely slogan, "Every child a wanted child," at us.&nbsp; Oh, boo hoo.&nbsp; We are supposed to feel better because the mother had her child killed.&nbsp; And this is preferable than being born unwanted (whatever that means).  Some of the voices of the pro-abortion crowd are more forthcoming than others.&nbsp; The so-called "Center for Positive Sexuality" (thanks to Ashli from  urlLink The S.I.C.L.E. Cell  for pointing this one out) proclaims proudly that  any  reason to have an abortion is a  urlLink good enough  reason.  CPS may be one of the few that says it out loud.&nbsp; But their position is the ultimate goal of the pro-abortion movement.&nbsp; The first step was to get a large percentage of Americans to accept the inviolability of others' "choices."&nbsp; Having done that, they continue to try to whittle away at American' discomfort with certain types of abortions, or with abortions for certain reasons (viewed, perhaps, as frivolous).  There have been&nbsp;two ways to approach this.&nbsp; The first was&nbsp;by  urlLink lying , dissembling, covering up the truth.&nbsp; There is no question but that the pro-abortion crowd has kept pregnant women and the American public at large deliberately ignorant about the number of abortions, the nature of the procedures, the percentage of late-term abortions, the level of fetal development, and other significant facts.&nbsp; But the  urlLink testimony  in the recent cases challenging the Partial Birth Abortion Act has made that a more difficult challenge.  So, the other approach has been&nbsp;to desensitize Americans to abortion - at all times, using any and all methods, and  for any reason whatsoever .  It's the old "camel's nose under the tent" approach.&nbsp; Once you&nbsp;agree that an unborn child has no rights under the United States Constitution, once you&nbsp;agree that a woman's right to "privacy" encompasses her "right" to have her children killed, once you agree to the premise that one's "personal morality" cannot be legislated (the consummate absurdity) -  you have lost any basis for objecting to any abortion at all.   The Richards piece is just the next link in a long, long chain.&nbsp; The purpose of writing it, and the purpose of publishing it, is to continue to push the envelope of acceptance for abortion.  But even if, as the polls cited above seem to indicate,&nbsp;Americans' support for abortion is waning, not waxing, the advocates of death will not be still.&nbsp;&nbsp;As many have already argued for years, it will not stop&nbsp;with abortion.&nbsp; If we are expected to be "tolerant" of a woman's unilateral decision to have a shot of potassium chloride administered to the hearts of two unwanted (but&nbsp; completely healthy) unborn children, then why not born but "imperfect" children?&nbsp; Why not Grandma, suffering from Alzheimers'?&nbsp; Why not Uncle Carl, paralyzed in a motorcyle accident?&nbsp; Why not Mom, who is incontinent?  We are becoming a nation of nice Nazis.&nbsp; "Nice," because we presently couch our decisions to terminate people's lives on high-minded premises like being deformed or unwanted, rather than racial supremacy or  lebensraum .&nbsp; And (in the case of the so-called "right to die" movement) on apparently compassionate grounds like "a life worth living" or "ending someone's suffering."&nbsp;    Oh, how dare you draw that comparison! , the death advocates charge in a fit of false indignation.&nbsp; The eugenics and genocide policies of the Third Reich were imposed from above!&nbsp; Against people's will!&nbsp; While we,&nbsp;only do away with the unwanted!&nbsp; We harvest their tissues not to make lamps, but to help the disabled!&nbsp; And we enlist the support of the doomed in their own demise!&nbsp; And even where  urlLink they haven't spoken their intent to die , we have self-interested, unfaithful spouses, ready and able to testify in court on their behalf!  I am not persuaded.&nbsp; The spirit of the Nazi death camps is alive and well in this country, insidiously&nbsp;pervading every aspect of our culture like&nbsp;smog.&nbsp; We've been&nbsp;living in it for so long that we can't even see it anymore.&nbsp;  We already have hundreds - perhaps thousands of our own Mengeles.&nbsp; They are in my town and yours -&nbsp;the doctors willing to cut little babies up into pieces.&nbsp;  We have the political supporters - the Democratic Party has sold its soul to the pro-abortion movement, and virtually no one in it has the balls to stand up to them anymore.&nbsp; (And I am not exonerating the "pro-choice" Republicans, either.)  For those who need religious sanction, we have&nbsp;some  urlLink established American churches  which have come out in favor of "choice."  We&nbsp;have a well-oiled propaganda machine.&nbsp; Witness the New York Times - and 90% of the rest of the media.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Go ahead and try to&nbsp;name five newspapers from major cities that have a stated pro-life editorial position.)  Why, we even have our very own  urlLink crematoria !  It's true that we&nbsp;don't have&nbsp;Hitler.&nbsp; But with people like Amy Richards, we don't need him.&nbsp; For the moment, anyway, we seem to prefer to create our Culture of Death from&nbsp;the ground up.  &nbsp;

						   You know, one of the things that I think needs to be mentioned is the frequent use of the Bible quotation, "Judge not, lest ye be judged."  My (now former?) friend closed her last e-mail to me with that quote.  I see it used all the time by people who want to hide behind it - to avoid taking a position on a controversial topic.  Sort of like, "Abortion?  I'm personally opposed, but I wouldn't impose my morality on anyone else."  If there's nothing wrong with abortion, then why be personally opposed?  It's like being personally opposed to spaghetti or shag carpet.  People who say that want it both ways - they want acknowledgment of both their higher moral standard and their "tolerance."  Because, in this day and age, "tolerance," is the  only  universally-mandated virtue.  But there is a big difference between not evaluating someone's - or your own - culpability before God, and not evaluating the rightness or wrongness of particular conduct.  Let me offer an example that cuts the other way.  In this day and age, we have explanations for certain types of wrongful conduct.  For example, we know that people who were abused as children are far more likely to abuse their own children.  Some charge that that is just an "excuse."  But there is a big difference between an  explanation  and an  excuse .  Just because we understand what might drive someone psychologically to abuse their children doesn't mean that it isn't wrong, that we don't try to protect the children, or need to punish abusers.  By the same token, even if we are not to "judge" someone in the eyes of the Creator, we are still able to identify conduct that is destructive.  And certainly conduct from which we want to protect our children.  My friend's fury at my June 28th message stunned me.  Particularly because she oddly characterized it as being about homosexuality, when I was speaking largely about heterosexual promiscuity in middle-school-age kids, never even discussed homosexuality, and made only a passing reference to legal scholars discussing gay marriage.  I don't know if I will ever know what made her go off like that.  But, in the interests of closure, this was my response: ******************** "Ohhhhhhh-kaaayyyy.  Whatever.   I will take you off of my e-mail list.  But since this is the last e-mail you will get from me, I will set the record straight about a few things.  For starters, I don't know where you got the idea that my last e-mail had anything to do with being gay, per se.  Most of the behavior that I was decrying - particularly the promiscuity I know of that is going on at the middle school level - was definitely heterosexual.  Otherwise, the political movement I was describing was among pedophiles.  If being gay is a sensitive issue with you, well, okay.  On the other hand, if you're trying to tell me that we need to be sensitive to the needs of pedophiles, we will have to agree to disagree.     And you can spare me the righteous indignation - I am not claiming to "know everything," or that I am "right" and everyone else is "wrong."  What I am telling you, I am telling you as a lawyer.  I did not bring up anything about gay marriage in the last e-mail.  But regardless of how you feel about gay marriage (for example), the polygamists, polyamorists and pedophiles are already crafting the constitutional Due Process and Equal Opportunity arguments that will analogize their sexual preferences and civil rights to those of homosexuals.  And I can tell you as a lawyer that there is no meaningful distinction between the "civil liberty" and "privacy" arguments made by homosexuals in favor of gay marriage, and those which will be made by the others.  And for those who claim that consenting adults ought to be able to do as they please as long as it does not hurt anyone else (an argument with which I agree as a Libertarian, by the way), so this will knock out pedophiles, I can tell you that that argument is a house of cards.  They will argue that there are already laws which have eliminated statutory rape, and which allow children under 18 to get judicial emancipation, as well as laws that allow girls as young as 13 to get abortions without their parents' consent.  These laws, it will be argued, are justification for the elimination of age-of-consent laws.  Once those are removed, pedophilia will have to be stricken from the penal codes, removed from the psychological literature as a pathology, and taught as just another "sexual preference" entitled to respect and compassion.  I have read the law review articles; I know what's coming.  It has nothing to do with being "right," and everything to do with being informed.  If you're cool with that, that's your deal; I am not.   But, once again, nothing in my last e-mail dealt particularly with being gay.  I will tell you that there are gay people in my life whom I love dearly.  I was raised by "Christian" parents to be that way.  I would raise my children to do the same.  And of course, if one of my children was "born" gay, then they would still be my child, and I would still love them, of course.  But if you read any of the social science (and I am not talking about "Christian" social science, but psychiatric and psychological journals), you will know that an enormous amount of homosexual conduct - and yes, even perceived orientation - is a direct result of childhood sexual abuse.  So, incidentally, is heterosexual promiscuity.  (And don't tell me I don't know what I am talking about.  [A member of my family] was sexually abused as a child, and he is a rampant sex addict as a result.  He didn't turn out gay; he certainly could have.  His particular pathology just didn't happen to manifest itself that way.)  Instead of eliminating the abuse, as a society we are moving toward legal protection of it.  And you think that's okay?   My indignation has nothing to do with "judging" gay people and everything to do with my firm belief that it is the role of  parents  to inculcate children with their beliefs - parents who are in a position to put all of their teachings about love and tolerance in a context - not the role of government schools, who teach the latest social theory du jour, unattached to any morality of any kind, "Christian" or otherwise.  It is precisely because the schools have become unmoored from any particular moral code (pick one, I don't care - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, whatever) that things have gone as far as they have.  Because the alternative is not a different, equally firm,  secular  standard of conduct; the alternative has been  no  standard.   I am not blindly mouthing some bullshit that got forwarded to me from some crackpot URL.  I have been in education for 13 years, ****, and in that time I have seen a steady decline in academic standards, as well as standards of conduct.  By way of example, one of [my sister's] friends teaches here at [a local middle school].  He told her about an incident in which a mother who was there for a parent teacher conference walked into the girl's bathroom to find a girl fellating one boy while taking it up the a** by another.  Tell me what this has to do with being gay.  Tell me there is not a significant problem in our public schools.   Instead of addressing the problem, the response has been to castigate those who want to maintain strong academic and conduct standards and a healthy environment for all children - black, white, poor, wealthy, whatever - as "racists," "sexists," "religious bigots," "judgmental all-knowings" and, clearly, the other sorts of labels you would like to saddle me with.  Fine.  At 43 I have seen plenty, and I can deal with what others think of me, rightly or wrongly.  But the fact is that it is the very poorest citizens who suffer most, because they are not in a position to pay taxes and tuition at any sort of private school.  If what I am describing is not the case with the public schools in Milwaukee, then you can consider yourself very fortunate.  (Although I know that the school voucher movement has a very strong leader in an African-American woman from Milwaukee named Polly Williams, so I suspect things are as bad there as they are elsewhere.)   I also have good friends (whose politics are significantly different from mine, if that makes you feel any better) and who are schoolteachers in the public school system here.  They admit to me - reluctantly - that there is not enough time in the day for math, science, reading, geography, etc., because their time is consumed with other so-called "social" programs mandated by the school system - self-esteem training, sensitivity training, "diversity" training, sexual orientation training, and related irrelevant nonsense.  In their more honest, even desperate moments, they confess that they cannot do what they were hired to do - which is teach - because they are expected to do what parents used to do, and they can't.  More and more children are coming to school unprepared, hungry, dirty, sexualized and sexually-abused, violent, uncivilized and amoral.  There was a time when it was parents' responsibility to feed their children, bathe them, wash their clothes, help them with their homework, teach them right and wrong, protect them from exposure to materials they were not emotionally and psychologically prepared for (and yes, I think that other people's sexual practices and sexual orientations are among those).   But since the parents aren't doing it, schools think they should.  And there's the problem.  Because without any moral context (which legally, they cannot give) and only 7 hours in a school day, this is doomed to failure.  The result is a system where diminishing academic effort has given way to ineffective - and in many cases, oppressive - social programming.  (Speech codes come immediately to mind.)  Parents are irresponsible, schools are ineffective, and everyone is gradually giving up civil liberties with little or no thought to the consequences.   If, in all of that, all you saw was some homophobic rant, then you read it with blinders on.  Clearly I hit some nerve for you.  Or maybe I am just bearing the disproportionate brunt of all the ire you have saved up from the "99%" that you've deleted and ignored.  I am sorry about that, but that's the way it goes, I guess.  You and I have known each other for 18 years, and shared many a story about intimate and painful personal faults and failings - ours and others.  You know me well enough to know that this "judge not" nonsense is just that - nonsense.  If one misperceived e-mail is all it takes for you to respond by saying, "maybe it's time I chose those I keep close to my heart more carefully," then you are obviously reacting to something other than that one message from me.   As per your request, you will not hear from me again.

						   Well, this was a complete surprise.  I have a good friend whom I have known for 18 years.  We were at each other's weddings (well, receptions - she married on a Caribbean island!)  I sent her a copy of my post from June 28th ("On sex education in the public schools"), and received this e-mail from her in response: *****************  "You cannot depend upon the schools to keep your children safe.  You have to do it yourself.  We all do.  And it is getting to the point where school is what we have to keep them safe from.  God help us."   God help YOU, ****. And God help your children if they ever realize they were BORN gay.  I saw that Oprah show (I hasten to add, it just happened to be on one day while I was ironing). In my opinion, you strongly misrepresented it.   I always knew we had differences of opinion on certain things, but this dissertation that you so desperately needed to send to "educate" the rest of us is an insult to me and, quite frankly, is infuriating.   I really could go on, but I TRY to make it a policy not to mix politics/religion and friendship. I have many friends who feel differently on issues than myself, but there is an unspoken rule that you keep these things to yourself.   I do not fill up my friends' mailboxes with my opinions (yes, they are your OPINIONS, yet spoken as fact) but am bombarded daily with those who choose to preach to me through forwarded emails and who basically use this forum as their soapbox at my expense. 99% of the time I delete them and ignore it, but this mail enraged me to my breaking point.   After going over this for two days in my head (...do I write an equally long dissertation and send it back to you? ...do I write it and send it to ALL of my family and friends in order to set my "beliefs" record straight? ...do I write it and send it to all my like-minded friends? ...do I write it just to get it out of system and then delete it? ...do I really have time for this kind of thing at ALL?), I have come to the conclusion that I have to say to myself: "I have a lot of friends; maybe it's time I chose those I keep close to my heart more carefully."  I'll end in saying that although I no longer follow a structured religion, it is for this very reason: I cannot associate myself with judgmental, all-knowing, so-called "Christians" who feel they have the right to tell myself and others how right they are and how WRONG others are.  So here are my bible quotes: "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone" and "Judge not others lest ye be judged." Think about those...  Please take me off your email list."  ********* How very sad.  I did answer.  My answer is in the next post.

						    Part II:  Have you been educated?  Or brainwashed?....   I know it's been a few weeks since I wrote Part I of this essay.   But I want to take some time with this one, and time is a scarce commodity in my life these days.  Be that as it may, let's review here for a moment.  I ended Part I by saying that the first thing to ask yourself in order to know if you're working for good or evil is whether or not you're telling the truth.  Sounds simple enough.  But of course, it isn't.  Over the past 40 years, the very idea of truth has been systematically attacked by our educational institutions.  Students are no longer educated.  They are indoctrinated.    To be educated is to be taught  how  to think.  This means how to challenge, to question, to test, to prove and to disprove.   To be indoctrinated is to be taught  what  to think.  This, of course, obviates the necessity of doing any of the above things.  As an initial matter, students are being brainwashed into believing that there  is  no such thing as truth.  They are fed examples of how great thinkers, theologians and philosophers have been factually wrong on any number of issues.  And these examples are used to shore up the idea not only that there is no such thing as truth, but that to believe in truth is to be "narrow-minded," "provincial," "judgmental" and (oh condemnation worse than all others) "intolerant."  So, in order to be tolerant, one must accept the proposition that Person A's "truth" is no different than Person B's "truth" - neither better nor worse.  Just different.  (There are all kinds of inconsistencies even within the faithful believers of this movement, but more on that at another time.)  The consequences of these teaching methods cannot be overstated.  When young people are indoctrinated into believing that there is no such thing as truth, they are left completely vulnerable to every passing fancy, every dangerous falsehood, every specious argument.  And they are utterly unable to defend themselves, argue against it, or attack it on its merits.  No matter what they say, they are met with a "well, that's your  opinion ."  Having taught law at the graduate level, I was under the impression that this was limited to students who received degrees in the so-called "social sciences."  (I say 'so-called,' because the methodologies I am referring to are the most unscientific possible.)  I found out recently that I was terribly wrong.  I now teach an Introduction to Law class to undergraduates in engineering.  Last year, during the first day of class, I asked my students whether some laws were more "valid" than others.  And if so, on what basis one could make that determination?  All of the students believed that some laws are valid, and some are not.  But when pressed to say why, they could not.  Or would not.  The reason, I discovered, is because to do so would invalidate the ONLY tenet that they have been brainwashed to believe - and that is that there no such thing as "truth."  Everything in their world view was relativistic, a "matter of opinion."  So, for example, if slavery was "wrong," it was because a majority of people thought so.  "And if a majority of people come to think it's right, then is it?" I asked.   "And anyway," I continued, "who decided that what the  majority  wants is the right thing?  Why shouldn't I make you all do what  I  want?  By force, if necessary?"  Oh, they all disagreed with that, of course.  Because force means violence, and pain, and death.  And we can all agree that those are 'bad' things.  "Says who?" I countered.  " I  don't agree with that.  And you've already told me there is no such thing as truth.  That everything is relative and a matter of opinion.  So it's only your  opinion  that inflicting violence and pain on others is a 'bad' thing."  I held up a black folder.  I asked them, "Is this black?"  One student said, "It's your  opinion  that it's black."  Another said, "I  feel  that it's black, but I can't be sure.  No one can ever be sure of anything."  I tried one last time.  "Ok," I said.  "Let's say you go to the emergency room with an enlarged appendix that needs to be surgically removed before it explodes.  Do you want a surgeon who says, 'No one can really know if this is your appendix.  Maybe it's your heart.  Or your spleen.  Or maybe I  feel  I can cure your appendix by taking out your brain.'"?  They just looked at me.  Their positions could be debunked logically.  But it didn't matter to them.  These students were completely unable or unwilling to question or let go of an empty philosophy.  They clung to it the way abused children continue to cling desperately to violent parents.  And these, mind you, are  science  students.  This demonstrates the difference between  education  and  indoctrination .  An person who has been  educated  to believe a particular theory - as well as being taught a scientific method for testing and challenging that theory - will have no difficulty letting go of it once it has been disproven.  A person who has been  indoctrinated , on the other hand, will be emotionally attached to whatever he or she has been brainwashed to believe.  He or she will only let go of that belief with the greatest difficulty - if at all.  So you see, answering the question, "Who do you work for, Good or Evil?" is a bit tougher than you think.  I'm kind of on a roll here.  So I think I will continue with Part III next time.  In which we will  assume  (at least for the sake of argument, and ever finishing this essay) that there is such a thing as truth.  And then move on.
