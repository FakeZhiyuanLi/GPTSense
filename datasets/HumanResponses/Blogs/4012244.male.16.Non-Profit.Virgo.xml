      hoho.. saw joyce @ macs today.. and she looked awesome man..! simply gorgeous..~ hah but i guess i never really liked her.. and yes shes tall.. v tall.. da tallest in the girls' volleyball team..  and guess wad? today i saw kaiting twice and she smiled @ me.. oh wad a great feeling her smile induced!! LoVeLy.... simply LoVeLy...~  Oh wad bullshit.. i couldnt care less really.. but its always nice to have someone smiling @ you.. and it happened to be her.. (go gUrl!.. smile @ me more!)  and exactly wad shit is goin on btwn me and xiaofang? i mean i have never liked her man.. wads up wif the world.?? yeah shes pretty pretty and yes shes keWt.. but tt dozen mean i have to like her man.... anyway i take such things as a compliment... i mean to be the talking point means i have to be really good.. and moreover to be assoc. with a chiobu like xiaofang tops it all off... haha jus kiddin alrite..  she aint bad.. in fact shes a great gurl .. but we jus aint got the chemisty... the chemisty is as bad as a b4 for o levels.. haha wad rubbish!  and wad abt the rumour abt me and yuqing?.. yea its all jus plain bullshit! shes a nice gurl too but the chemistry is worse.. i would say its a c6 ... hah i reckon it aint gonna work out.. and i dont bother dwellin on it any further..  BUt ...as for yu lin.. now tts a totally different case man.. i mean yu lin may not be as pretty as yuqing or xiaofang.. but shes a real sweetheart.. and shes really adorable and our chemisty is awesome !.. gradin it an A1 is an understatement...!! but too bad we don get to see each other often .. as ironic as it may seem considering that we live less than 10 sesonds away... i mean i kinda miss her man.. i reckon she likes me but shes probably waitin for me to make the first move.. and i jus cant bring myself to do it.. not tt i don have the balls but it jus dozen seem right cos we are somehow not that close? and on top of tt, im a BuSY maN! im fatalistics, i believe if we r fated 2 b together... we will b together... shes a wonder... tts all i can say.. a real wonder... and i mean it.
