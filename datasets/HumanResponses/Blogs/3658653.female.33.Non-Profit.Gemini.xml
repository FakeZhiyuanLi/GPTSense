      So, there's a book out in retaliation of Michael Moore's movies/books/political stand.  Here's the  urlLink link     Below is a review of the book on Amazon:     "What I do not undertand is how a book that came out less than 2 days ago has soooo many reviews. What I feel is that many liberals are afraid of what the book might reveal and are trying their best to discredit it. Come on people us conservatives are smarter than you and Micheal Moore. The truth is Micheal is a scary man and this book finally exposes him, as will the movie Micheal Moore Hates America. I can't wait to see how Couric, Rather, Chronkite and the rest of the liberal media will cover that one. Probably as little as they covered this book. Oh I love to see liberals so sturred up. And you claim to be the smarter, better party. Let's see how much influence Moore has in November."   Don't you just love when someone tries to discredit the intelligence of others, yet hasn't even mastered the basics of simple spelling?  Ahhhh, looks like reading isn't the only thing that's fundamental.

      Went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  last night.  I walked out of the theatre feeling a strange mixture of pain, anger, deflation and to some extent humiliation.  Of course, most people can understand the first three--they're basic human reactions to seeing the strife, loss, foolishness, etc. that has been so prominent in this country and because of our leadership over the past 3-4 years.  The humiliation is the fact that I voted for GWB.  I'm ashamed-that is an understatement.    But, as in the past election I see that I will be voting in this one with the same attitude--that of picking the lesser of the two evils.  Neither candidate makes me feel proud to vote, proud to be American (how cliche)~they both insight levels of frustration, disgust and pity for the American people.  But, one of them does make me feel less of those emotions than the other, so I guess that's where I throw my hat.  I know that Michael Moore will always throw his biased bent into his films, as is his right when making them.  But, I found so much of the footage to be dead-on in one way or another.  From the mother who lost her son, to the Iraqi woman who was pleading with God to make things better and make us go away, to the backslapping, good ole' boys club that is our current administration and cronies, it was almost too much to take in via one viewing.  I think I need to see it again, I need to take more time to decipher components instead of considering the whole.  It makes me wish I had more time to be more political--because I do miss the political work I did in Iowa, even if it was for the 'dark side'!

      I've noticed lately that I'm in a pathetic rut with making sex oriented jokes as they relate to political candidates.  Sad, but true--even sadder, I'm having fun with it!  Anyway I went to the Pride Parade on Sunday and had a smashingly good time.  I really liked the fact that I sauntered around all day, even at the  urlLink Magnetic Fields  show, with a sticker on my ass saying "George Bush, You're Fired!"  For some reason I was very proud of myself for that.  I've actually even considered sticking one on my car.  The parade this year was a bit more low-key than in the past.  I saw no boobies and no penis'--yes, it's true.  Oh well....next year, I think we're planning a little soiree at my abode beforehand and then having another rousing good time at the parade.  Now, the MF's---great show, excellent performance.  I could rave on and on, but I won't for fear of making all of you jealous for missing it!  I will be seeing the  urlLink Old 97's  next week.  I haven't had the pleasure of seeing them as yet, so I'm highly looking forward to it.

      Well, the long awaited unveiling of Jack Ryan's custody documents has arrived.  (Drum roll please)  It looks like ole' Jack has a thing for the kinky sex clubs and 'made' his wifey go along with!   urlLink  Now seriously, if someone took me on one 'surprise' trip to such a place and then proposed TWO more 'surprise trips' in the same year, I think I'd be forcing a little disclosure because some surprises aren't always good ones!  My theory--she liked it, but doesn't want her dirty little sex fun to ruin the acting career.  Well...the porn industry is losing people right and left, there's probably a place for her 'acting' there if all else fails!  On another note...Bill Clinton's book hit the shelves today....I'm not sure if I really want to read nearly 1000 pages of info. on Bill~he really just doesn't seem THAT interesting.

      First, let me state that overall I'm ok with public transportation, I understand the trials and tribulations (to some extent) of running a mass system such as the one Chicago possesses, BUT there are moments when I get seriously upset with their utter stupidity and lack of proper planning.  Last night and this morning are prime examples.  I hop the 146 last night at Belmont.  We go a mere three stops when a disabled woman in a wheelchair wants to get off.  She wheels to the front..lo and behold, the chair lift doesn't work.  The damn thing won't even lower.  The driver messes with it repeatedly to no avail and meanwhile this lady is sitting their patiently waiting to extract herself from the hot and muggy bus (because the A/C doesn't work either-of course). Now seriously, wouldn't it be prudent to do checks on such things as chair lifts on a very regular basis?  I'd think so, but obviously CTA doesn't see that it's necessary to handle routine maintenance to ensure things such as this don't occur.  This a.m. I get on the 135. People try to exit and the back door won't work, which really is par for the course with many buses and not really a traumatic issue.  The issue arose when the driver decided to repeatedly stop and try to fix it, instead of sticking to her route and getting passengers to their destinations in the appropriate timeframe.  Wait, it gets better....in the midst of her 'repairs' she somehow jars the door so that eardrum blasting buzzer gets stuck and will not stop.  We were serenaded by a buzzer symphony all the way to our destination at Union Station.  Again, a little common sense and reasoning would've gone a long way...but, alas, I really must quit thinking that we actually do live in a logical world!  Either way, if you feel the need to complain to CTA about their shoddy service on public transport, here's the  urlLink CTA link ---post away to them, maybe someday this little grassroots (ha) campaign of mine will ensure my bus has working doors and A/C.

      There's something really cool about starting a new blog....that is something cool besides the fact that my old ones tend to get bogged down with a bunch of shite that I really don't care for the masses to read and it's easier to create than to delete.  So, here it is....yet another new one.  Hopefully this one will stick to the 'not so much about me' theme that the other one was supposed to.  Wish me luck with that ok?  And since I'm in a bit of an 'all about me' mode right now...well, I'm going to stop typing and come back when I can give you some real food for thought or at the very least a good rip on Geedubya!

       urlLink Minister: Saddam Suffers Prostate Trouble    Maybe this is where the  weapons of mass destruction  are hiding!  Told you it was tactless.....  On a more serious note, it seems as if  urlLink Obama  has risen to the height of his 'fame'.&nbsp; I didn't hear his speech merely because I fell asleep instead-oops, but from all I've read thus far he's the man of the hour and probably one of the better ones ever picked.&nbsp; Sad that his speech will again upstage Kerry's!

      I have this saying attached to the top of my   computer   "Accept what you cannot change".&nbsp;   Now, this is truly a lovely sentiment---one I wish I could live by more earnestly.&nbsp; Over the course of the past week, I've gone through some excruciating personal experiences, all toppled onto one another.&nbsp; I'm still alive and kicking, though I wonder how much of a 'changed person' I will be at the end of this journey.&nbsp;   I have learned what true friends do in the face of ugly situations and I've learned that the 'ideal' of friendship and caring can be very, very deceptive.....hard lessons that maybe I should have learned long ago, but never internalized enough to think they'd actually pertain to me *gasp*.&nbsp; Sometimes I amaze myself at how much I think I'm above the standard human emotion---now, I don't mean above in the egotistical sense, but just that I feel I shouldn't 'own' emotions such as that.&nbsp; I've now duly learned my lesson that I encompass such things just like the next guy or girl.  Anyhooo....the one final conclusion I did come to in all that has occurred is...I am taking one year, repeat ONE YEAR, off from the dating game and focus my attention on much more introspective and important things like my career, my finances, going back to school (you know, so I can completely annihilate my finances).&nbsp; Sounds kinda drastic, don't it?&nbsp; But in the scheme of things....drastic measures may be needed!&nbsp; Actually, drastic measures are needed.  So, there it is--my declaration of independence!  &nbsp;

      I tripped  And fell  &nbsp;  Back into the depth of a quagmire I thought long gone  My breath comes in short, desperate gasps  As I try to break free of the ropes and chains of my mind  &nbsp;  The pain I feel is parasitical  It hurts in recesses I never knew existed  It wraps around my fright like a blanket not needed  &nbsp;  I know this will last  It goes beyond the reasoning of my mind  Breaking into the emotional walls I’ve constructed  &nbsp;  My fear eats at me  It wakes me at night and makes me sleep at day  No longer can I be rational in thought  &nbsp;  The emotions swirl about  Creating a tempest that swells strong  Leaving a shell of the person who used to be

      Amazing how we can actually convince ourselves that we know someone, and know them fairly well, but when the chips fall down and adversity gets in the way----you see a side of them you never thought imaginable.&nbsp; Now, if you already had a fairly low perspective of a person's integrity, I guess this wouldn't be such a shocker, but if you actually thought that even though they had flaws and foibles and incompatibilities they were still basically an overall good person who maybe just had some "self-work" to do....well, it's a bit of a&nbsp;cold-water dousing&nbsp;to see that underneath it all they really aren't that good of a person after all and you've been disillusioninig yourself for quite some time. Then one get's into all the questions and second-guessing of one's self (or at least I do) and one's ability to judge others accurately.&nbsp;  &nbsp; OK, that was my little bit of rambling for the day...probably doesn't make much sense to the masses, but maybe it's just some stream of conscious blather that could prove to be thought-provoking to someone, somewhere.....

      OK, I admit it--I SMOKE THE OCCASIONAL CIGARETTE!  There, now that I've said it, I can also say that I think the whole smoking ban in bars is ridiculous.  Drinking beer and smoking go hand in hand---it's almost like taking Old Style out of Wrigley Field, it just isn't right.  Thus I think the owner of  urlLink Fibber McGee's  in Ireland has the right idea!  Such an anarchist aren't I!  Supposedly the ban is to protect employees from passive smoke....hmmm, maybe you just shouldn't work in a damn bar if you're worried about it!

      Minimalistic coversation over lunch today:  Patti  "Here, smell my can"...  Michelle--"WHAT????" and guffaws as she shoots chili out her nose, then realizes that Patti is holding out her Diet Pepsi can of which had been in her car with a melted candle, so it smelled like the inner realm of some nasty mix of  head shop tainted with patchouli and a Yankee Candle store---I just happened to miss this portion of the conversation.  I'm sure this is just one more example of WHY I need to start paying more attention to things around me.

      Not those kind... urlLink the band ! Oh yes, they're comin' back to town and my happy ass will be planted happily at their show! They're playing at the  urlLink Vic  on October 23rd and excited is my understatement today. I mean how estatic can a girl get knowing she's seeing The Cramps and  urlLink The Pixies  within a month of each other! Life IS good......sigh.  This weekend will be very uninspired...I'm heading to the Farmer's Market in Evanston at the butt-crack of dawn tomorrow and spending the rest of the weekend cleaning the pigsty known as my apartment. I may, if time permits, make a jaunt to the  urlLink Geek/Comic Book  extravaganza in Rosemont...we'll see.

      Rick James has passed away....this saddens me.  I'm not really sure why, but I have a feeling it has something to do with the fact that a guy I dated in college deemed it appropriate to nickname me 'Super Freak'.  Now, I probably shouldn't even mention that in a public forum, but hey, it's almost 10 years later so now it can be filed away in the "past amusements" category.  I let you draw your own assumptions as to why this existed.  Anyway......back to the topic at hand, Rick James.  I think this guy had some talent that was duly wasted.   Now  his talent may have been for serious cheeze factor, but hey we're all creative in our own ways, right? Fifty-six seems an awfully young age to die.  I hope he's have a disco/funk good time wherever his soul may be.

      I truly don't feel like doing much work today, so I'm playing here instead....  First up on the list of crapola:   urlLink Prisoner glues himself to girlfriend .  Now this is classic....guy and girl glue themselves together to avoid his extradition--now that's solidarity!   urlLink Source: Keyes will challenge Obama .  That whole sentences is a load of shite!  Please....does anyone think that at this late of a date the GOP has an remote snowball's chance in hell of actually defeating Obama?  The part that really grabs my goat (well, figuratively because I don't actually own a goat) is that the guy doesn't even live in Illinois, but only has to set up residency by the election.  Wasn't this the same guy who totally cranked fantastic on Hillary Clinton for not being a NY resident?  (to the tune of OPP) The g-o-p and their hy-poc-ri-sy...sorry, that was lame.  Oh, but in case you think the GOP actually has brain one in their head, try this one on for size:   urlLink Unabashed Racist Wins GOP Primary in Tenn.    urlLink Proposed Dutch law would ban unsolicited toe-licking .  Huh?  Need I say more?  And in case you're lacking for a toast on this lovely weekend:  Our lager, Which art in barrels, Hallowed be thy drink. Thy will be drunk, (I will be drunk), At home as it is in the pub. Give us this day our foamy head, And forgive us our spillages, As we forgive those who spill against us. And lead us not to incarceration, But deliver us from hangovers. For thine is The beer, The bitter, The lager. Forever and ever, Barmen.

      Oh yes, George has done it again. Like another George who said "I cannot tell a lie" (well, supposedly--we've all heard that this was a fictional account).  The latest and greatest from our fearless leader....  "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we," Bush said. (excerpt from  urlLink here )  Spoken like the educated man that he is! Will someone please save us from this...PLEASE?????

      I'm sitting at work today, surfing around on people's blogs just to see what I can come up with. What did I come up with you ask? Well....a true find my children, a true find. Somehow, someway I stumbled onto a blog for Roger Avary. I will be the first to admit, I don't know a damn thing about Roger Avary, but his blog looked interesting and CV even moreso, especially when I found that he directed a movie (which landed on the Sci-Fi channel quite a few years ago) that I thought was brilliant in the cheezy b-grade way that I love. The movie is  urlLink  Mr. Stitch   .   Now, I couldn't remember the name of the movie (how I forgot I'll never know), but I distinctly remember seeing it at a friend's house right after I moved to Chicago and I wanted to rent it because they wouldn't let me watch the whole thing (bastards!). Well, I've found it---VHS and DVD! I also found a website about it, which was a little bizarre, but worth a peek.  See, it's things like this that truly make me happy in life......seriously. Granted, about $20,000 would make me extraordinarily happy right now, but hey-beggars can't be choosers!
