      Okay, so I bumped the Revo in a careless mishap. That's what I get for driving a family SUV, I guess. But seriously, i'm fine, although the repair costs more than I expected it to  : /  A little context, to begin with: I spent my teenage years in Hong Kong and Singapore, in case you didn't know. Both cities have a 'world-class' public transport system, so there's neither a practical security risk  or  a social stigma about commuting there. And so I did.  When I moved back here in '97, I just didn't bother immediately learning how to drive -- I was far too busy for that, and eventually I kind of fell into the habit of being comfortably driven around (my family employs a driver).  Skip forward until early May, when I finally got around to signing up for driving lessons. By this point, I had two factors working against me:  I've got a mild fear of driving that's been ingrained by pop cultural images of fantastic vehicle accidents: pedals slammed violently, brakes screeching, windows shattering, steering wheels flailing wildly, entire car bodies flung sideways off the road, leading to the head-turning spectacle of the flaming car wreck. So yeah, blame Hollywood.  But punk rock also takes part of the responsibility for my aversion to driving. There's a well-documented history of  urlLink resistance to the fuel industry  (in general) and  urlLink car use  (in particular), which finds much resonance within the subculture.  The arguments against oil consumption obviously hold a lot of weight -- from the atrocities committed in the interests of gas companies (think:  urlLink private armies  in resource-rich 3rd world nations), to air pollution, and over-crowded roads. No matter how critical I am of Earth First-style  urlLink direct action tactics , or celebrity enivronmentalism ( urlLink pro-vegan supermodels , anyone?), or  urlLink 'green imperialism' , it's difficult  not  to be influenced by the basic, fundamental practices of the movement/s against automobiles.  Unfortunately, the most common alternatives proposed -- walking and  urlLink bicycling  -- are just not very feasible in Metro Manila. Fact.   You can use a bike to get around subdivisions, or your local barangay, quite easily. However, once you start hitting the main thoroughfares -- EDSA, C5, atbp. -- the noxious emissions from the other vehicles, not to mention the reckless drivers, make long-distance biking a thoroughly unpleasant experience (at best) and a life-threatening habit (at worst). And even if, like me, you can cycle to MegaMall or Shangri-La Plaza without ever passing any major roads, what happens when you make it there? Few, if any, considerations have been made for parking one's bike.  Likewise, being a full-time pedestrian is not a sustainable option, unless you want to deal with the ongoing mental burden of guarding against snatching, mugging, and/or simply being hit by some inconsiderate asshole, when the sidewalk inevitably disappears underneath your feet.  Driving seems like a necessary evil, unless you have the budget, time, and resources to commute. Which brings my over-confident self to the damaged Revo: broken signal light, warped body, folded inwards by a low-impact collision with the entrance to Pioneer Center supermarket. (Yes, go ahead -- snicker. It  is  dumb.)  I refuse to let my disgust with car  culture  -- the reliance on gas, the vanity of collectors, the machismo of drag racers -- get in the way of my personal mobility, even if it means extra Sunday driving time, and learning to put up with speed-demons on the highway.   But I'm still holding out for the pipe-dream of a more walker/bike-friendly Manila, in the long term. And for  that , it means we ALL recognize the practical unacceptability of a car-dependent society.

        And I want life in every word To the extent that it's absurd  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clark Gable", The Postal Service  New blog. Another chance to make it good.   Hopefully, I can be more substantial on a regular basis, now that I've excised myself from the  urlLink other big online journal server  (along with its pseudo-'community' aspects that routinely made things uncomfy over there).  If, for some insane reason, you prefer my overly verbose entries -- the ones that read like mini-essays, or even op-ed columns -- then you're in luck. I'm feeling a bit more articulate than I've been in a long time, plus my new daily schedule gives me a little more time for updates, so I might just get back into the habit of extended ranting. But don't hold me to that promise, just in case ;)  So, uh... I'm not sure how many of you will bother to read this (periodically, I mean). No obligation to leave a comment informing me of your presence, for now -- just share your ideas, whenever you feel like it. It's nice to know that i'm not *completely* alone here either, okei?

      I've been having my own private Ironic Sci-Fi Dorkfest this weekend, between the  urlLink  Johnny Raygun   comic that Jetpack Press  urlLink offered gratis  on  urlLink Free Comic Book Day , plus the bonus disc on  urlLink Liam Lynch 's  Fake Songs  album/video, and the  urlLink  Futurama   season one DVDs that  urlLink Matthew  bought.   The former is a zany black-and-white comic styled as a loving parody of Flash Gordon-esque galactic hero pulp (bad hair, worse sense of machismo). It kinda reminds me of Mike Allred without the hints of art-school pretension. Athough creators Rich Woodall and Matt Talbot are somewhat transparent about their influences -- one hard-ass character is named  urlLink "Grist Kane"  -- they succeed at finding that fragile equilibrium between fanboy reverence and ironic detachment. That's not easy when you're dealing with subject matter that's so patently ludicrous.    The less I write about  Futurama  the better -- I'm ashamed of how woefully long it took me to finally watch this hilarious cartoon by  Simpsons  impresario  urlLink Matt Groening . For those of you who are similarly removed from the proverbial loop, I will only remark that the initial pair of episodes boasted a spot-on Disneyland satire, a fun send-up of interplanteary expansion as the new 'frontier' (think: lunar rednecks), capped off with an oddly touching gag about the sense of wide-eyed wonder associated with interplanetary travel, in the present day. Matthew agreed with my gut assessment that it captures the same quirky dystopian vibe of  urlLink  Transmetropolitan  , sans the overbearing cynicism that made  urlLink Warren Ellis ' series occassionally difficult to read in extended doses.  And finally, the Liam Lynch DVD. Well, a lot of it was... um, predictable. Fun, but predictable. It was basically a live-action version of a  urlLink Jim Mahfood  comic, in a lot of ways. The  urlLink "Rapbot" video  looks *exactly* how I imagined it would, complete with Lynch as a silly-acceented mad scientist, and a classic, boxy droid wearing pre-bling-bling urban threads. And the  Lost In Space  spoof would have been unbreably indulgent in its amateurishness, had it not been given a very sincere bookend with Lynch explaning the stressed-out conditions that lead to its creation. Maybe i'm a sucker, but I could totally relate to Lynch's description about being in over his head with side-projects, and  rakets , and freelance work. But it was the puppet-based "FLYZ" skits that won me over, and has prompted me to add 'sock puppet vignettes' to the list of media that I'd like to dabble in someday.

      This year's Big Cancerian Natal Weekend -- highlighted by celebrations for  urlLink Claire  (July 2),  urlLink Matthew  (July 3),  urlLink Pao Vague  (June 30), and  urlLink Anna  (July 2 rin), not to mention  urlLink Free Comic Book Day  -- is over, at last.  It felt kinda like a jumping-on point for 'new readers' of my life-story. While it may not represent the beginning of a major arc, there were follow-ups (if not resolutions) to relationships that were first brought to my attention exactly four years ago (Pabs and Tiff,  urlLink Fletch  and  urlLink Kimmi ), a few new 'characters' making cameo debuts (well, at least in *my* personal narrative), plus a couple of surprising returns, with some folks looking significantly different from their previous appearances (Ben de Vera, Fatima). And in true crossover fashion, it featured a shitload of 'guest stars' living within a common social universe.  Like a good stand-alone issue of an ongoing series, it had multiple colorful locations (MegaMall,  urlLink CCHQ ,  urlLink Kalayaan College , Makati Cinema Square, some bar called Dusk on Kamagong, and um... Claire's house). There was a consistent mix of action (pick up  urlLink Grace ! find Dusk! rush to Jack's diner before the last order!) and talking-heads sequences, with occasional snappy quasi-Bendis conversation.   Of course, there were a few subtle changes in the status quo, the most significant one being the Dumpling Press team's shift from being mere critical readers of sequential art, to self-published Comic Creators, with the release of our 32-page   Monochrome Fiesta   -- yes, complete with two collectible variant covers, in keeping with the premature ' urlLink 90s/kewl comeback ' vibe that's been happening lately *rolls eyes*     There were also hints of new alliances being formed, with the possibility of regular team-ups with recurring 'members', in addition to the core 'team' of myself, Claire, and Matthew. But I won't 'spoil' that prospective new sub-plot, lest I jinx it, or needlessly raise expectations.  I guess it's a good time as any to kick off this new blog. It would be nice to be a few pounds lighter (and with significantly reduced blood-cholesterol level) in time for the next 'trade collection' in my life-story, and the matter of my academic status has become waaaay too 'decompressed' for my liking. But otherwise, the plot is shaping up quite nicely, in convenient singles-friendly format. Hope you all decide to stick around for it.   Um... Excelsior?

         I gave Jim Mahfood's  urlLink  Stupid Comics  #1  an embrassingly favorable review in issue 2.5 (sic) of my former zine,  urlLink  Dysfunxion   (release date: September 2000). I'm not one to recant on what I penned years ago. However, I must say that my interest in his work has somewhat fizzled, bottoming out after  Grrrl Scouts , Vol. 2:  Work Sucks  ended.  I was about to speculate that perhaps I've outgrown it. But that's not quite right: lately, i've been rocking out to the  Fake Songs  album/DVD by  urlLink  Sifl & Ollie   creator  urlLink Liam Lynch , which is as proudly immature as it gets.  It's not that Mahfood has 'gone soft' with age -- his work just kind of stagnated, really. But a certain degree of repetition has never bothered me. For example, when I open a new  urlLink Mark Millar  or  urlLink Warren Ellis  comic, I anticipate a certain degree of crass, shock-value humor: bowel disruptions! superhero penis gags! I've seen it a million times before, and it rarely fails to elicit at least a few guitly chuckles, every time.  So it can't be latent prudery, either. Case in point: I'm still vaguely amused by writer/director  urlLink Kevin Smith , the 'Food's partner-in-crime on the  Clerks  spin-off comics.   But even without considering Mahfood's  urlLink terminally slack  pal, it was very easy to come up with a diverse rogue's gallery of Straight(ish) White(ish) Male celebs whose material is as seemingly offensive as it is hip and (potentially) funny: Adam Sandler, Tom Green, Jack Black, Ali G, the Farrelly Brothers ( There's Something About Mary ), Trey Parker and Matt Stone ( South Park ,  Orgazmo ),  urlLink Lloyd Kaufman  (Troma Films), Mike Judge ( Beavis and Butthead )... heck, even Matt Groening. How come I'm willing to cut those guys more slack than I am prepared to give Mahfood?  ------------------------------------ Ever astute,  urlLink Matthew  offers the following partial explanation:   The aforementioned who's who of infantile parodists have enough self-deprecating wit to suggest that you're laughing  at  their comical intolerance and narrow-mindedness. By subtly owning up to their complicity in the mean-spirited and often petty schadenfreude (be it toilet humor, or meathead impersonations, or poking fun at 'retarded' kids), they makes themselves into the butt of the joke as well, rather than inviting you to laugh along  with  them. In comparison, Mahfood's work falls short of that reflexive auto-mockery.  Moreover, the subjects of Mahfood's  urlLink grafictional output  -- 'fake punks'! stoners, maaaaan! wanna-be ganstas! -- have become so ingrained into mainstream pop consciousness that ridiculing them feels like emptying rounds into a barn-door target. It's futile to label someone a 'poseur' for being enthusastic about something that has no subcultural 'authenticity' to begin with. He's not offering anything different from the surly joker huddled in the corner of the lecture room, making snide remarks about his more outgoing classmates.   It might be amusing when you're a frustrated college kid, but it's just grating when you have more 'adult' responsibilities to deal with.  Perhaps I would be more charitable, had Mahfood's art style improved over the years. But no, the essential formula remains: one third blunt-object fuck-you attitude, one third urban/graf-influenced posturing, one third cartoonish mayhem.  Furthermore, Mahfood's aestheic influence is disgustingly prevalent on open-membership art websites like  urlLink DeviantArt . Amazingly, many of his copycats somehow manage to be even more insenstive and bereft of imagination than he is.  All these reservations didn't stop  urlLink Claire  from buying  urlLink  Bad Ideas  , Mahfood's latest collaboration with Wayne Chinsang and Dave Crosland. However, our curiosity about the project had more to do with its format, completed in week-long period, after last year's San Diego Comic Convention. (I have yet to read it myself, but a quick flip-through seemed promising enough.)  ------------------------------------ Before we leave the subject of mindless irreverence altogether,  may I recommend  urlLink  Spider-man Without the Comic Code Authority  ?     link courtesy of  urlLink Matthew  -- sino pa?

      I absolutely love  urlLink  The O.C.  , in spite of its glaring flaws. Yes, I jokingly refer to it as   urlLink Ultimate  BH90210 , but really, it's its own animal. It's a bastard hybrid. It has the shamelessly over-wrought drama and conspicuous wealth of 80s soap-operas like  Dallas  and  Dynasty  (both of which I used to half-follow, when my  yaya  tuned in religiously). But it also captures the post-WB, post-Whedon teen formula of snarky inter-personal dynamics, quasi-hip soundtrack, and 'mature' themes.  Maybe it's not as ironically witty as Jamie Babbitt's lamented, short-lived  urlLink  Popular  , but there's something to be written about how it produly, whole-heartedly owns its ridiculousness, and unapologetically puts its fakeness on display.  Never mind brooding Ryan and his cloying down-home working-class earthiness. At the center of the fun is  Seth Cohen , played by the wonderfully boyish  urlLink Adam Brody .   For the most part, he occupies a time-honored role: vaguely adorable boy-next-door who is inexpicably ostracized as a misfit loser, to a certain degree. It's a storied heritage that includes everyone from  urlLink Xander  on  Buffy , to Harrison on  Popular , even David on  BH 90210 , and Gordo on  Lizzie Maguire . It usually provides Brody with a chance to display the geekish charm that made him so popular duirng his stint on  Gilmore Girls , but that's not the be-all end-all of Seth Cohen's appeal.  The value added is that he's television's most prominent emo boy/punk rock fan. At first, the show's writers don't make a huge issue out of it -- Seth pops in a Death Cab for Cutie album into the CD player on a road trip to Tijuana ["The Escape" (1-7)]; a Ramones poster appears visibly in his bedroom, etc.  However, by "The Telenovela" (1-20), it's a full, ridiculous plot device, as Seth gathers up the cojones to declare his love for both emo music and the  maarte  Summer (uh, I guess that counts as a spoiler for other viewers in the Philippines. Sowee!)  For what it's worth, this aspect of his character never seems too contrived. Adam Brody's  urlLink profile  at IMDB claims that he's genuinely into the same music as his character -- it's not just a performance. In fact, he supposedly plays drums in an indie-pop outfit called  urlLink Steven's Team .   In contrast, the  other  prime-time punk-rock teen, Peyton from  One Tree Hill , doesn't fare quite so well. The script gives her all the necessary trappings: she listens to vinyl records, draws a black-and-white comic (just like  The O.C. 's Anna), and wears, yes, Ramones and Dashboard Confessional tees. But actress Hilarie Burton's overall performance doesn't match up; it's like watching young Kerri Russell after a week-long stint in the  urlLink Hot Topic  marketing boot camp --  it just doesn't ring true.  The fact that punk/emo/indie rock enthusiasts -- 'fake' or not -- are visible during prime-time, in the first place, honestly surprises me more than it probably ought to. I still don't have an easy time believing that emo has 'gone mainstream' when I still have to place a custom order for, say, the new Jets To Brazil or Hey Mercedes album.  (Frankly, it's a subject i've beaten to death  urlLink elsewhere , so I don't want to get into it yet again.)  I'd find it unlikely to see a character in a  urlLink  G-Mik  -style program rocking out to Jimmy Eat World, and I'd be even more skeptical about local 'talent' -- say,  urlLink Joross or Hero  -- playing one on TV.  With that in mind, I now present this kick-ass t-shirt design from the the merchandise section of  urlLink  Cat and Girl   (recommended, as usual, by  urlLink Matthew ):

        urlLink Angelo de la Cruz is a free man again.   Well... relatively speaking.    For now, this little bit of information takes precedence over anything else, is seems. More important than rent-paying, and celebrity gossip, and traffic jams, and overdue papers.   It's framed as a subject that you can't  not  be concerned about. Expressing indifference towards the former hostage's ordeal is met with the kind of guilt-inducing tsk-tsk-ing usually reserved for those who forget to observe religious holidays.   With that in mind, let me recount this brief anecdote:    urlLink Claire  and I were having lunch at  urlLink California Pizza Kitchen , some time near our anniversary this year (early June). We sat at a counter near the open grill area, separated from the employees by a high panel of frosted glass, so we couldn't make out any of their faces. From behind this partition, we overheard snippets of conversation, spoken in tones loud enough not to be considered 'private'. I couldn't even decide how many voices there were, but the gist of their discussion went something like this:     "Do you know why Arabs are so hostile towards Filipino workers?  It's because they're afraid we'll steal their jobs."   "That's why terrorists mark OFWs as targets, in particular."   "Have you been to Riyadh? Parang little Manila rin!"   "We can't help it if we're such hard workers,  no matter where we are in the world."

       "I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday.  I've begun reminiscing events before they even occur.  I'm reminiscing this right now."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Max,  urlLink  Kicking and Screaming     All profound changes in consciousness, by their very nature, bring with them characteristic amnesias. Out of such oblivions, in specific historical circumstances, spring narratives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benedict Anderson, from  urlLink "Memory and Forgetting"   Nostalgia isn't just about revitalizing stupid fashion trends, or bad haircuts, or washed-up child actors. It's not even about recovering the memory of angsty teenage diatribes, or notes passed in classrooms, or the names of crushes scribbled onto Trapper Keepers. (But that's certainly an important part of it). More than anything, it has to do with selectively filtering the best parts of one's individual history, and stripping them of context and power relations, so that only a distilled, wistful joy remains. It's necessarily a conservative thing. It's the practice of personal historiography, minus the sense of responsibility it ordinarily entails.    urlLink     I mention this because I recently watched a copy of  Reality Bites , saved from a discount VCD bin. Ten (ten!) years after it was first released, I still don't get a lot the Ameri-centric 70s pop culture references. However, I find myself far more forgiving about the dialog and characterization, which I had previously found grating and whiny. That's not to say that I now  empathize  with the protagonists. But there's a feeling of guilty recognition in their petty bickering, their mundane workaday concerns bloated into grand tragedy, and their cloying sense of their own hipness.  My awkward, flannel-clad teenage self always found Lelaina and Troy so impossible to relate to. My view of what post-collegiate life would be like was filtered through the lenses of the  urlLink "Asian economic boom" . I was living in Singapore's robust, newly-industrialized polity. Each vacation home to Manila gave me the image of a lively 'tiger cub' economy, teeming with new MegaMalls, and a thriving Pinoy rock scene, and grand Philippines 2000 infrastructure projects. I honestly didn't believe that it could ever go to shit, in the naive, indefatigable way that young men are wont to do.  The Cold War had ended. The Forces of Democracy won, but now America was paying for the cost of victory, mired in a prolonged recession. It was time for us former colonies in  urlLink ASEAN  to rise to greatness. Fuck dependency theory; it was  urlLink Soros  a go go for me, in 1994. Enter the  urlLink global village , the borderless world... oh how thrilling it seemed!  What happened instead was a messy confluence of dirty tricks, speculative capital, wrong-headed macroeconomic policies, and good old-fashioned corruption.  urlLink Crisis on Infinite Growth .  A decade later, the  urlLink "Gen X mentality"  has belatedly caught up with us, as if cultural phenomena too runs on  urlLink "Filipino time" . Burgis can-affords like myself are on the 'slacker track', diverted from the others, who valiantly hold on to ideals of dot.com success and making their IPO before 30.  In present day Manila, college grads with 'irrelevant' liberal arts degrees are reduced to being glorified receptionists, and telemarketers, and  urlLink  "may I help you, sir?"  . Their body clocks and daily schedules must be readjusted to Pacific time, or East Coast time, or Central time. Mentally warping the hours, the minutes, the seconds, night becomes day. Does the free internet access help to forget the absence of sunlight?  "How about those Yankees?"   No, we don't need  urlLink 'tutelage'  or military bases or PX goods to pretend we're living in America.    urlLink Borderless world , indeed.  Walter Benjamin on  urlLink "The Angel of History" :  His face is turned to the past. Where we percieve a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe, which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is brewing in Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. This storm irresistably propels him to the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.  And progress is not intelligently planned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  urlLink "Progress" , Bad Religion

         By now, I think most people have read about  urlLink  Buy This Dream  , the fund-raising initiative of  urlLink Pia Faustino , which began with a  urlLink simple journal entry , asking people to donate P300 towards paying for her airfare to the  urlLink World Youth festival 2004  in Barcelona. In exchange, she will carry out a good deed of their choice. It has now grown into a full-blown testament to the power of community networking (or, if you're more skeptical, the willingness of people to vicariously perform acts of kindness).  Admittedly, I began as a skeptic, initially uncertain about Pia's  urlLink background  and intentions, but once she made these public, I was convinced of her  urlLink positive goals ,  and  her capacity to act on them. Furthermore, she's completely transparent about her self-interest in all this: I never intended what I did to be inspirational or noble. I needed help, so I asked for it.  I don't think I'm doing anything unethical. All I did was ask for help in exchange for good deeds. If I were selling material things like cookies or magazines to raise funds, fewer people would have probably questioned my ethics. But just because I'm offering something intangible in return, people call it unethical? Would it perhaps been more ethical just to go ask my mom and dad for the cash? Or to ask some corporation to sponsor me in exchange for my endorsement that they are a socially responsibile company?  I think that asking one's community for support is just as valid, if not more meaningful, than approaching any other source. Really, who can blame the girl for chasing after her own personal, idealistic dream, in a somewhat novel, unconventional way? It's a little more Ayn Rand than Rousseau, but so what?  However, I never opted to pledge any money to her. There was always a nagging sense that I could put my P300 -- and my *own* time -- to a more  fulfilling  use; it could be petty and selfish (buying myself a new comic, or a nice meal), or it could be time-consuming, "meaningful", and benificial to the causes that matter to me (say, designing a flyer about socially responsible trade programs, or volunteering for  urlLink Freedom From Debt Coalition , maybe organizing a benifit gig). Either way, I don't need an intermediary to get the end result I desire.  Still, I can't deny that  Buy This Dream  has prompted me to reassess the ways individuals (generally) and Filipinos (specifically) put their money to use. It almost sounds trite to claim that 'meaning' exists in every purchase, every financial transaction, in what you buy, and what you own. But each Peso spent represents an investment in social beliefs and cultural attitudes. It has  value , in both the economic and moral sense.  On top of that, Pia's experience has given us new insights into what one might call a "network community" (to borrow a phrase from  urlLink Manuel Castells ). In fact, she believes Pinoys are  urlLink especially adept  at forming them: The success of this project perfectly showcases some of our greatest strengths as Filipinos-- our sense of community, our trusting nature, our willingness to nurture and participate. Our potential is so great, if only we knew how to harness it. Taken out of context, that might read like platitudes being farted out in a reaction paper about a one-day immersion outreach. But if one understands it, in terms of the  excess of P50,000  it has earned her, we begin to see the formation of a vital way of generating income  and  fostering goodwill.  The challenge now is to make it work for  all  of us, without it degenerating into  urlLink pyramid scams  or glorified panhandling. But you know what they say about paving the road to Hell...  If Pia's experience means anything to you, kindly link to her blog, post about it, tell others about Buy This Dream... anything to let the greater public know about her exceptional project.
