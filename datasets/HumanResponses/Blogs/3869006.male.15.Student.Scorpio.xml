      I love ashleigh, I havn't updated in a while... so here it is. Ashleigh is the Greatest, and I would do anything for her... umm... today I woke up at like 10:30am so I missed ashleigh buy a bit ;). I spent the night before last night at Ashleigh's grandparents house, while they were house sitting :D. When I got back I went to Ashleigh's house and we watched a movie, she fell asleep and then her mom gave me a ride home... at 2:30 in the morning. Well I didn't do anything terribly important today... Lovingly Loving you, ~Sean

      I just had fun shoping with Ashleigh, Kayla, and their mother Cath for more than 5 houres! I had fun walking around Wallmart, and pushing the buggy. Ashleigh picked out some shirts for me, a crazy Garfeild shirt, a blue BUM equiptment shirt, and a (hot)black shirt. Then I got to watch as Ashleigh, and all picked out night ware, under ware, and the such. Ashleigh found these kickin shoes on sale for just $5.00! Then I got to guard the clothes while Kayla and Cath tried them on 6 at a time. All together I had a great day, on the way to Ashleigh's the rad almost overheated, and then after casing a house for it's water we went home, and I got to model my 3 new shirts, Ashleigh says I look hot in the black one ;). Tomorrow I get to go to another wallmart with Ashleigh and Kayla and Cath to pick out some casual dress pants to go with the shirt they got me! Hooray! Well, I'm going to go to bed now. Lovingly Loving Ashleigh ~Sean

      Had a weird day today,  I got to go bowling with ashleigh today :), I beat her the first game, then she beat the crap out of me the second time, she insisted I threw the game, but naa, i really suck that bad. But after that things started getting weird :(. I guess she was just tired or sick or something :(, I wish I knew what was wrong so I could help her... After bussing it to her house we relaxed on their new super comfortable couch. I love her so much, and I hope that she tells me if there is anything at all I could do to help her. I'm going to bell fountain tomorrow, but I really just want to go to wild water works and spend some time with Ashleigh, but I guess that I'll be able to see Ashleigh soon enough I love Ashleigh so much, and I would never do anything to hurt her on purpose, and I am so sorry if I have done anything to make her feel anything less than the perfect person she is. -p.s. Ashleigh is probably the only one that is going to read this... so if this is Ashleigh reading this, I LOVE YOU ASHLEIGH!
