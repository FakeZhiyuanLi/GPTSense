      In the year of 2004, many people find themselves alone and without the support of family, either by choice or by situation.  This website is here to provide the support you need for your homelife that others get through their families and/or extended families. The people who contribute belong to a close group of friends that met on the internet and have been providing support for each other through their weblogs and through emails.  We don't claim to be professional advice givers.  We are merely people with a lot of life experience that are willing to share it with those who need it.  We hope to help people with problems that aren't serious enough for professional counselors and social workers but those that you might get help for from a family group.    The recipe part comes from the administrator's wish for closer ties to large groups of women that you might find in a small village or large family living in the same house.    So, come here if you are looking for a fun recipe.  If you don't see something useful feel free to email us as we are just getting started.  If you have a question that you are too embarrassed to ask your co-worker or your own family, email the question to us. We promise to respect your privacy.  We will answer relationship questions or questions about the home.  As the administrator I will look at your question and see if it is soft enough for our group of non-experts to handle.  If it's too serious, I'll see if I can point you in the right direction for help. Once your question is posted, the individuals who contribute to this web log will cut and paste your question at the top of their post and give you advice as best they can.  Being that there are several people fielding questions, chances are you'll get varied and solid advice, enough for you to choose   I'm looking forward to hearing your questions. I'm looking forward to seeing how this project turns out.  Best Regards,  The Administrator

      Nothing new to review today. I am going to see 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' tonight so stay tuned for a review of that. I don't even find current TV much of interest. I usually tune into reruns on Nick at Nite or TV Land, or catch some Golden Girls on Lifetime. There is nothing more comical than when the ladies are at the supermarket shopping for items to bring on a cruise and they decide on an economy sized box of condoms. Rose, as always, doesn't catch on and Dorothy says "we need those" and points. Rose says,"what, toothbrushes?" and Dorothy replies calmly, "No Rose, those" and Rose asks,"What, soap?" and Dorothy says less calmly, "No Rose, THOSE!" and Rose says "What, shampoo?" and Dorothy yells, "No Rose, CONDOMS! We need CONDOMS, Rose, CONDOMS!" and the checkout clerk says, "Take it easy ladies, where have you been, prison?" Golden Girls really was an early version of Sex and the City with Dorothy as Carrie, Blanche as Samantha, Rose as Charlotte, and Sophia as Miranda. However, if I was a character on Golden Girls I'd be Dorothy though I'd secretly yearn to be Blanche. The Golden Girls consume cheescake in the manner that the Sex and the City girls consume cosmos. I hate cheescake and I don't drink, so my cosmo would have to be plain cranberry juice. It would be interesting to create a fictional posse of 'Sarahs' who sit around drinking Diet Cokes 12 at a time and eating pita bread and babaganoush.  For all of you dog owners out there I suggest you check out www.dogster.com. It is like Friendster for dogs. My pup Zoey has a page. http://www.dogster.com/dog_page.php?j=t&i=23564 If you have a dog on Dogster, make sure you add Zoey. She is seriously lacking in the pupster pal department. Also, Zoey and I are participating in a Dogswalk for Cancer event in Riverside Park on May 2nd. To support online you can go to   http://www.dogswalk.com/site/TR?pg=personal&fr_id= 1041&px=1023146&s_tafId=1033&s_oo= qlrmR0Byu3CPLhYs3lnipg..  and see the site I created with Zoey's adorable picture. I'd like to thank Phil Abramson (who is the only person besides my parents and my boyfriend) who has donated so far!! The NYC AIDS walk is coming up and as I will most likely not be participating in that one (Frank and I are trying to plan a getaway to Florida that weekend for my birthday) you know I'll support you guys if you walk!! Close-up on Homer J.Simpson...tax deductible contributions...mmmmmm.

      I fell asleep last night during Average Joe "Adam Returns" (still not sure on official name). So I can't tell you one way or the other who he eliminated or if there were any comical plot twists. I seem to have developed this sleeping condition where I fall asleep really early (like around 10pm) and then wake up around 4am, check my e-mail and play on the web, then go back to bed at 5 and wake up at 7. It kind of sucks. However, as I was doing my 4am e-mail check (note, due to the hour of the morning, I was doing this in a slightly woozy state), I recieved an e-mail from a 'Clump S. Alloys'. Sounded like a literary name to me so I opened it. It was titled 'yogacat apart'. I thought, if this is junk, maybe I am at least being offered some kind of new age yoga package. Worth a read. It then said something in small type about 'cheatinghousewife' (all one word). In my bleary,sleepy eyes, I assumed this said 'clearinghouse' (as in the publishing company) and the e-mail contained one sentence-- "clock pagan the peace faced wiser shark macaw sever goose throw tower happy". Boy was I surprised to find nothing literary at all connected to the link. Moral of the story. Do not click on links at 4am.  Also at 4am I got a message from my friend Danny whose new movie 'Mean Girls' is coming out soon! I watched the trailer on line and it looks great. Way to go Danny! I encourage all of you to go see it. I know I will.  Sunday night I ordered a movie on Pay-Per-View (or shall I say Movies On Demand) called 'House of the Dead' because according to my boyfriend, I had a dream that I was in it.The film is based on a video game. The premise of the plot is a bunch of kids go to a rave on an island off Seattle that is haunted by spirits and they all die. End of story. I never would have considered seeing it if it wasn't for this dream. Frank tells me that I woke up screaming that I was trapped on this island (this was all before I saw the film, and let me mention that I have never played the video game) and that these spirits were trying to get me and I was using weapons to kill them.I explained all this to him in a half awake state but I guess I was very specific about the names of the weapons and the people in the dream, the boat, and some guy with a raincoat and a hook. I was so intrigued that I somehow had knowledge of this in my subconcious that I ordered the movie. I ordered it at 9pm Sunday night and at 9pm Monday night (as I was trying to finish it) the movie cut off "your movie order has ended". How rude. I never did see if anyone survived. Damn 24 hour rentel. The movie was unbearably horrible, so I am not too perturbed. I can only assume that I overheard a kid at the museum talking about the video game, the characters, and the weapons, and hence, it got into my dreams. My memory has an endless capacity for useless information. Now, to train myself to remember the important stuff...

      Monday again. Yesterday, Zoey and I went to a 'dog birthday party' for her poodle friend Munchkin. It was adorable. Zoey had quite a blast flirting with all the boys. Good thing she is spayed. Spring is in the air and I love it. I hope it keeps up. More later.

      Mom weekend continues in full force. I want to mention that one of the main reasons she came to town was because we had tickets to see Assassins.Unfortunately, the opening date has been postponed due to further Studio 54 rennovations. The show was originally scheduled to open in September 01 and did not open,for obvious reasons, as the plot revolves around the assinations of presidents. I love the show dearly, but feel that it still might be a bit too soon.  Yesterday with the Momster (who is in the Marge club) included an apartment cleaning and a shopping excursion. An adorable Kate Spade jacket was purchased that I am absolutely in love with. We went to the Angelika and to see ‘Dogtown’, the third Lars Von Trier installment. Frank respectfully declined as he had very little sleep on Friday and he was hesitant about having a variation of a ‘Ross/Joey nap’or alternately a ‘Lars Van Trier slumber’ as the film is over three hours. So the Ackerman women settled into the underground theater, clad with diet pepsis and I must say, I enjoyed this film very much. Maybe ‘enjoyed’ is the wrong word. I don’t think I could sit through the entire thing again straight through but I certainly plan to get the DVD and watch it chapter by chapter. Conveniently, the story is told in an ’Our Town’, theater-like, fairy tale way. I should  point out that I am a fan of his previous films and was very much looking forward to seeing this one with Nicole Kidman as his female martyr. The movie is shot entirely on  a soundstage, with the town of Dogville depicted with chalk lines representing houses (like the chalk lines that outline corpes). He adds furniture, the dead-end mountains, and tree props, but keeps the setting Brechtian. I was too wrapped up in the lilting voice of John Hurt as the narrator and the amazingly underscored performance of Ms. Kidman to pick up on the entire allegorical meaning of the story (plus, with easter on the near horizon and the Passion of Christ perhaps I chose not to focus on that). But the general theme of mob mentality and small town communities rang true to me. Especially since we are innundated with this every day with Martha Stewart, Princess Diana, and Caroline Bisset Kennedy. Its particularly true with women. Society loves to build people up only so they can tear them down. The film is pretty much split between the two. Enter Nicole,a stranger running from the mob. At first the town is wary of her beauty and nice clothes. But they accept her into their community until she becomes to adored. Then they tear her apart; turn her into a chained dog, the women mock and shun her and the men rape her. Nicole (who's character is aptly named 'Grace'), remains a true martyr, like Von Trier's other female characters until the very end when the audience learns that Grace has a devilish secret of her own. The film's ending is a complete turnaround from Von Trier's previous films (Bjork in the electric chair accepting her fate for her son). The ending takes a nasty twist (which I was very pleased by) and I will mention here that I applauded as the credits rolled. The film was dedicated to Katrin Cartlidge who until yesterday,I was not aware had passed away. She was in such great films as Von Trier's 'Breaking The Waves', and also 'Tospy-Turvy', 'Career Girls', and the mini series of 'Crime and Punishment'. She passed away from pneumonia at age 43.  Thai food last night. I am limiting myself to salad only this week.

      Dinner last night at Atlantic Grill. More lobster was involved. Claire shared with us her hilarious 'Marie Antionette lobster story' which I would love to share with my readers (or more specifically, I would love to steal for a novel one day) but it is her story to tell. Basically, it involves her teaching abroad in China, inedible fishhead soup, and the fact that lobster is considered a true delicacy to her dining companions comprised of Chinese and British people.  Conversation led to gay marriage and health benefits for unmarried people. Claire pointed out that we women in  professions such as writing, teaching, the arts, etc, are at an extreme disatvantage in terms of health benefits and I fully agree. We are working in jobs we love, where we may not recieve full benefits, HOWEVER, if we were  married, we  would be on our husbands' health plans. Finacially, this would open up more possibilities and freedoms for us career wise. 30 years ago, we all would have been married to our college sweethearts (which is certainly not the suggested route to take). Equal benefits for all, we suggest! Yes, this is moderately socialist, but shouldn't we all have health benefits, regardless of marriage??  On this note, I am going to post a review I wrote of a novel called 'Starting From Square Two' by Caren Lissner. Spring is here and chick lit reigns supreme. The theme of this page turning gem of a novel, by author Caren Lissner, is change and the consequences brought about by it. I found myself wiping tears from my eyes at the end of the book not from over sentimentality but due to Lissner's ability to get her point across simply and poignantly, without being overly wordy. First off all, this book is too beautifully written to be placed in the romance section. I hardly consider it a typical 'romance' novel. The concept of 'change' is frequently a topic I read about but rarely do I find it written about in such a universal way that it can connect to a wide array of women. I loved the metaphor of Todd working on a train and studing history (past connecting with present and constant movement, etc.) and the fact that while change is often difficult, painful, and hard to accept, it is a part of life, necessary and unavoidable and good in fact can come from it even when one least expects it. I love the comparisons between generations (if we were women in the 50s and 60s we all would have married our college sweethearts whether or not it would have ended happily or not)...rather like Laura in The Hours. Women have choices now, like we see in character of Erika, which only causes a entirely different type of pain. Do these choices allow us freedom, or only cause us more confusion and unanswered wonders? I found the character of Erika extremely compelling and she was with whom I most identified with. I loved reading the lack of understanding between Gert and Erika and towards the end how Gert came to almost empathasize with Erika's situation. When an ex boyfriend cuts you out of their life (even when the breakup is on your part) and the only contact you have with him is an abprupt and cold e-mail or info from the new girlfriend's website it is like a death and hence you have to mourn the loss, as I believe Erika learned. While this is very different from Gert's loss, Gert came to understand that everyone's pain is in fact, painful to them, and I liked seeing her slowly shed her judgements. The Gert/Hallie relationship was also very well developed and kept in tune with the theme of change. Hallie was nicely created and the dynamic between the three women was very realistic. The references to 9/11 are subtle, are go along with the theme of change. The world is changing along with us and we must keep up or die trying. I found this novel comforting in many ways. Life goes on, regardless of tragedy. Like an unstoppable treadmill, we all must tread through and learn to find to see the good in things. This book is certainly a fantastic place to start. Overall, I thought the book was truly phenomenal. I loved the mix of seriousness and humor and the message was hopeful and positive.   I want to thank those who have given my site mentions and links! You guys are awesome. I also want to thank those who have sent me e-mails. It's always a pleasant change from the ads for viagra and porn sites. You can always e-mail feedback to Sackerman519@aol.com. I'd love to delevop a network of fans so I can become Norma Desmond and wear a turban and get ready for my close-up.

      Don't have time to critique much today. Mom is in town. Ate some lobster last night! Getting ready for work.Made it home last night to catch the end of ER and was disappointed to see that it didn't follow last week's rerun of Romano's helicopter accident. I missed that the first go round and was sort of interested to see the follow up. I don't mean to laugh, but it was funny last week how Romano was on this tirade, then had a flashback of a helicopter ripping his arm off, and then was crushed by one. Poetic justice. Ah well, I'll  catch the aftermath in a rerun at some other point.  My mom's museum sold a painting (for a nice price)! Yay mom! I gave away a sample project on organic  shapes (a la Matisse cut outs) to a homeless man on 14th street, that I made while demonstrating a project at P.S. 64. Yay me!

      I heard on NY1 that Garbage Pail Kids have made a return. Remember those cards made by Topps? They were a joke on Cabbage Patch Kids with names like 'Adam Bomb' and 'Up Chuck' and contained disgusting images of bloated children? They were very popular on the playground and turned children (including myself) into pint sized hustlers. In my parents house in San Francisco I have series 1-4 neatly boxed away. I really should check how much they are worth now. Apparently, new cards have been released and the teacher in me forsees them as being contraband. The child in me still thinks they are pretty neato.  My Mom is coming to NYC for a visit this weekend. Woo hoo! This means good food, some shopping, and a spotless apartment by the time she leaves.  Frank and I were eating dinner on Saturday night (take out again) and found ourselves glued to 'Average Joe--Adam Returns' (which is probably not the official title). 'Adam Returns' couldn't be right. I don't know why, that just sounds so much like an action movie sequel. I have been trying to abstain from reality tv but we really couldn't tear ourselves away from this one. Even during the commercial breaks. Each was afraid that the other would flip the channel and NEVER change it back and god forbid if we never knew who Adam eliminated on the first episode. How to describe this show? Well, for those who didn't catch the original 'Average Joe', Adam is a 28 year old NYC stock broker who Melena deep sixed for Jason, some sort of waiter/model type with no wit and nice lips. Adam was cool and mature about the whole thing, returned home to NYC, promptly set up a website/dating service and recieved zillions of hits a day (apparently). He was invited to film 'Average Joe 2' or whatever its official name actually is, live in a house in Palm Springs and date and eliminate women (and I'm sure tricks and plot twists will be thrown in as they were before such as Melena in the fat suit). The women he was introduced to (and my boyfriend backs me up on this) can most definitely be described as 'Average Jills'. I find this makes the show far more interesting because the women are using personality, rather than looks to win this guys affection. By far the best part of the show was the use of the term 'real'. Adam said over and over 'Man, this is all so real. I mean, it's on me now, it just feels so real.' And the Jills seemed to be in agreement. 'This house is so real. I mean, Adam, is real.' Okaaaaaaaaaay. If 'real' means a made-for-tv mansion, cameras and crew everywhere, and a dating situation  that follows a script, sure. Also, Adam seems to have developed quite an ego after his last stint. Another point of humor was that several of the ladies chosen where actually  'fans' of his! Ha!

      A few weeks ago, while on my lunch break, I was cruising down Broadway and was stopped by a guy in front of a movie theater asking if I was interested in seeing a free movie.Never being one to turn  down free entertainment,I gladly accepted his two free passes to a screening of Jersey Girl, which conveniently happened to be playing in my neighborhood that Saturday night. Frank is an avid fan of Kevin Smith and happens to find Liv Tyler very attractive so he was more than eager to line stand an hour and half before the actual screening began. We, as the average movie fans, looked on  as press were catered to and let into the theater and given those neat press packets. This was a show unto itself to listen to the people in line try to to upgrade their status by saying things as ludicrous as, “Well, my brother’s friend writes for an internet site in Houston…can youlet me in first?” Because Frank and I were polite and non chalant the pimple faced AMC worker did, for some reason, invite us to the front of the line where we rode the escalator, purchased some sodas, and then were instructed by a rude authorititative woman that we had to sit in the very front because all the other seats were reserved for press. I was too tired at this point to complain,  but she then noticed thepresspacket I had casually swiped while Frank was buying concessions and directed us to seats in the press section. Yes kids, I know. STEALING is wrong. But they had so many kits. And it was just a folder made of paper.  And I didn’t MEAN to keep it. I was just perusing it while Frank got food and forgot to put it back. Yeah…that’s it…riiiight. Anyway, the guy next to me (who I must add was extremely nice and friendly) began asking me what paper I was with and I have absolutely no talent for improvising on the spot. Sorry mom and dad, all those acting classes must have gone to waste. I think I muttered something about being a teacher and writing about censor ratings. I don’t remember. In terms of the actual movie…I liked it. I really did. For the die hard Kevin Smith fanatics, this film lacks his (in my opinion immature) Jay and Silent Bob-ish dialogue and comedy, but the film proved to me that Mr. Smith has grown up both as a person and as a writer and director. He still includes fun filled cameos and I can assure you that J-Lo dies in the first 10 minutes (no worries about this being a 'Bennifer' film like 'Gigli'). Whether or not one empathizes with the film will really depend on one's views of Ben Affleck. If you loath him for personal reasons and are so sick of his 'Bennifer over exposure' you will not like this film. He is the driving force of emotial change and connection. If you like him, or are neutral to him (as I am) you just might be moved by the 'family' theme. The Liv/Ben subplot is extremely minor. The movie is about fathers and sons and fathers and daughters. and as always, change and growing up (both from an infant to a child and from a husband to a widowed father). I loved the girl who played the daughter (Iamalways won over by sassy, spunky Sweeny Todd loving tykes). I believe she is not real and they simply put J-Lo through a shrinking machine. George Carlin gives an excellent performance as Ben Affleck's father. After the film, Frank told me that he thought my eyes and smile looked like Liv Tyler! Aren't boyfriends the best? I'll have to wear my Liv glasses more often!  I just found out that Marcie "Marge" Hume will be coming to NYC to renew her visa so she can return to Iceland. This means that for two weeks I can say things like "I like to build ships, my son would rather sail them", "My son's only talent is spending his allowance", and "I think jazz is just noyyze, just insolent noyzze" and not feel like a crazy person. I am accepting applications for the Marge club since Marge Hume is on sabbatical. interviews are required. On that note, I recently purchased 'Nothing That Meets The Eye' The Uncollected Stories of Patricia Highsmith. It is said that Nabokov based 'Lolita' on one of these stories.   I am still midway through the third Harry Potter (yes, I am slow on that trend) and Erica Jong's 'Fear of Flying' (quite possibly the original 'Chick Lit'). I am eager to finish it so I can write my review. I am loving it so far. In terms of Harry Potter, I find these books very slow and overly wordy. I think Ms.J.K. could have done a closer editing. Her characters seem to spend a lot of time reviewing and analyizing the actions at hand which I  find entirely unneccessary to read about. If I read what happens, I don't need the characters to recap it for me unless they are going to put their own spin on it. This may be one of those instances where I prefer the film versions to the books. Then again, wizardry, magic and sorcery have never been favorite topics of mine.  Two writers I  must strongly encourage everyone to check out are Caren Lissner (Carrie Pilby, Starting From Square Two) and Jennifer Belle (High Maintenance, and Going Down). Reviews on these two exquisite women to follow.

      After the disappointment of 'Secret Window', I had high hopes for 'Taking Lives'. After seeing the previews thecast looked great : Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Keifer Sutherland, and Gena Rowlands.In general, I amnot a fanof Ethan Hawke but everyone  knows I'm a complete sucker for books and movies involving serial killers (I'm the girl who watches documentaries on the most famous cannibal killer of the 20th century and can sit through 4 hours of footage about Charles Manson and watched with interest every special special on my 'Capturing the Friedmans DVD'. 'Taking Lives' was obviously not 'true crime' but all the same, the story looked highly appealing based on the preview. And we all know that I could sit in a theater and watch Angela Jolie read the phone book fortwo hours. She is so sexy. I was also excited to see Angelina and  Gena Rowlands working together again sincethey were both 'anger balls' in 'Playing By Heart'. I really don't have a lot to say about this movie. The plot was predictable. Like 'Secret Window', it was not suspenseful. I jumped twice at some clever film making tactics. Keifer Sutherland was a waste and was in the filmfor about 2.5 seconds. And why was the FBI in Montreal?? Much  of the movie did not make sense such as the point of Gena's character and the small amount of background we got on Ethan. But by the end of the film, I found I didn't really care. I was hungry, fidgity, and whispering to Frank about what I was planning to order from Chinese take out. This movie falls into the between category - neither good nor bad...in my mind, the worst type ever. I say, wait for cable.  I must print my first retraction. I mentioned earlier that the EW review of Princess Diaries was Claire's publishing debut, when in fact, it is NOT. Let me quote Ms. Lui herself -- "I have been published before. It's true! Readers of the Queens newspapers and various other exciting magazines have seen my work before!)  In highschool, Claire and I used to play a game where we would pick a TV show or a book and  decide which character  we would be. When doing 90210 (popular during our highschool years) Claire was always too hard on herself and determined she would be Nat who worked at the Peach Pit. Claire, I officially promote you to Donna status (trust me guys, she *wanted* to be Donna over Kelly) although Claire could  never really *be* Donna because she did well on her SATs and got into Columbia whereas Donna freaked  out and ran  out of the classroom. I believe I was actually given the honor of being Kelly which is so not  true. I'm much more Andrea. I even looked like her in highschool with the messy brown hair and glasses. I was  also a total kiss-up (especially in American Lit!) and was the editor of the literary magazine and since I now work at CMOM, I  think my Andrea status has remained. It's more fun to play the game with the Sex and the City characters. I used  to think I was Charlotte,but now I am beginning to see myself more as Miranda. Hmmm.

      I need to take a moment to point out here that my beautiful G4 laptop is suffering from a rare spacebar disease, where rather frequently, even when I press her spacebar several times she does not comply. (yes, my computer is a she). This is not me being sloppy. I blame my computer entirely. As for typos...yeah, thats 100% my laziness.  I had a rather disappointing afternoon. I teach an outreach program in the Bronx at P.S. 64 and my lesson plan was the fabulous children's book 'Olivia', about an energetic pig (picture Eloise with a snout). Olivia sees Degas and Pollock paintings in the museum and then decides to try to paint a Pollock on her wall (because it is so easy) and gets in trouble). Her mother reads her a story about Maria Callas before bedtime and she dreams of being an opera singer. Note: these references are subtly placed in the illustrations but do play a large part in the art project we did afterward and the class could not have been more bored with the story. They didn't indentify with a single part of it. I didn't create this lesson plan (it was created by the museum where I work) and is mostly used amongst the the 4-7 year old upper west side crowd. I should have had a counter plan but I didn't. The class did seem to enjoy drawing pigs with chalk (which I brought in from museum stock) because chalk is a rare commodity at P.S. 64. Bloomberg doesn't seem to deem it necessary to provide funding for chalk in the Bronx schools when dividing his education budget. Makes no sense to me. On a more humorous note, I brought along a 'toy' property of CMOM (Children's Museum of Manhattan) where I work (so I don't have to make this reference again) which was a 'Dress Up Olivia' doll complete with evening gowns, swimwear, pajamas, playclothes, shoes, etc. I kept the toy safely concealed in a CMOM bag on the D train so I was surprised by the strange looks I was recieving. Midway through the ride, I realized, this huge, red, feather boa was poking out like a painted cats tail and I had a laughing attack at the 125th street station!

      It's great to have friends with connections. My co-workerand friend Sarah R. has a friend from college who now works for Clearchannel (boo them for their right wing views and for cancelling  Howard Stern but yay them for free things!) He managed to score 10 tickets to the Bette Midler concert ( titled 'Kiss my Brass') at Continental Arena in NJ. I know what you're thinking guys and that was my first impression too. Bette Midler? In NJ? But let me tell you, I had an excellent time. She put on a spectacular show. Yes, I stifled alaugh during 'Wind Beneath My Wings' just because it  is so overdone (also because my aunt and uncle have been known to perform a strange and comical country-western guitar/vocal version of it at family gatherings) but Ifound myself wiping a tear from my eye during 'I think It's Gonna Rain'. Memories of the 80's cameflooding back. Bette threw in a lot of stand up comedy including many jokes about Dubya and oneparticular funny one about Rush Limbaugh's oxycontin addiction..."he's not just a moron...he's an oxymoron!" There was a bizarre 20 minute  segment in Act II where Bette dressed as a fish/mermaid and rode around in a wheelchair singing fish themed broadway parodies. Tres bizarre. But a fun time was had by all. The woman looks damn good. Still and always. Up close and 'from a distance'.

      I seem to have found myself in a rut of seeing movies that appear (at least in the previews and in terms of the cast) to have potential. But that potential then deflates like a balloon after my second sip of diet coke. I will begin with my review of 'Secret Window' which I saw a week ago.  'Secret Window' (no connection whatsoever to Hitchcock's 'Rear Window') is actually based on a Stephen King novella. I can only assume he wrote said novella pre-Shining, as the similarities are certainly there. To a humorous degree, in fact,in so far as the plot centers around plagerism and I had to wonder if the Master of Horror was plagerizing himself (which in the film, the character is). The similiarities are there but Secret Window is predictable, lacks suspense, and is actually cringeful at times. The film is presented in a such a way that the 'clues' (if you can call them that) are shoved down your throat in every scene and only a person with shortterm memory loss would not have guessed the outcome. The movie was not a total waste, however, due to the always outstanding talent of Mr. Johnny Depp. He was as loony as Jack Nickolson in The Shining and seemed to be marching to the beat of his own drummer, sand director.He went nuts with his character development and it was disarmingly psycotic and comical. He also manages to look sexy with disheveled hair and a ratty bathrobe. But overall, the film was a huge disappointment. Large chunks of it don't add up. Timothy Hutton made me laugh as a 'red herring' type character and the illustrious and talented Maria Bello (of The Cooler) was sadly misused as Depp's ex. In summary, Depp=good, movie=bad.  In other news, my friend Claire wrote a review for Meg Cabot's latest installment of her popular adolescent series 'Princess Diaries' (Princess in Pink). Though Ms. Cabot may have been drunk at her book signing, I have great respect for her writing and I look forward to reading her latest. I look even more forward to picking up Entertainment Weekly (note: Hugh Jackman is on the cover) to see my friend Claire published for the first time!!

      Zoey is in training for the dogwalk on Sunday. *theme music from Rocky plays in background* She is jogging, stretching, and pawing through her rolodex to get all of her canine friends involved. Zoey and her friends have raised a good amount of money and Sunday should prove to be quite social for her. I guess its her version of the Costume Ball.   ER was rather dull last night. Now that I can't blog about Romano and his burnt fake arm I just don't know anymore. But the teacher in me wants to warn the kiddies to 'Just Say No to Ketamine'! (that little side plot was comical yet scary).    urlLink Tamara  is coming to NYC in a month! She has a great blog and I hope I get to meet her during her whirlwind trip.

      "WHO'S BEEN PLAYING WITH MY PEACHES?" We have an exhibit called 'Monkey King -- A Journey West' which teaches children the fabulous Chinese folktale of a mischevious and magical monkey who is sent on a journey by Buddah. On the way, he gets into some trouble with the  Jade Emporer for eating some magical peaches. In the exhibit, the children can touch the peaches on the peach tree and the Jade Emporer pops up and says this line in a loud and booming voice. Perhaps I have been working too much or perhaps its just that we educators have dirty minds, but we find this line very funny.  I bought a copy of Plum Sykes's 'Bergdorf Blondes' and as cringeful as it may be, I can't put it down. It doesn't pretend to be anything that its not...pure, guilty pleasure.  I fell asleep around 8pm last night. That was nice. Very, very, nice.

      The Ball was amazing! Never would I have imagined dancing to Beyonce and Outkastt in the lit up Temple of Dendur. I am much too tired to blog today and Cindarella has to go and teach the rugrats at CMOM. But if Prince Charming reads this, I was wearing the 8 1/2 burgandy Manolo Blahnick heels. I need my shoe back.  Claire went home with Jude Law. Sssh...don't tell her that it was actually a caterer *pretending* to be Jude Law. He was hot. Wait, was he a caterer? I think he was a security guard. (I'm only kidding!!!!) Claire looked stunning.  Also, I will quickly add that there is a costumed manequin in the exhibit who is collapsed from the fatigue of consumption. It was fascinating!  It was nice to see John Gordon (in from Boston) and Amanda Miller.  And yes, Nicole Kidman looked luminous beyond belief.

      The Queen Mary 2 leaves today. No more pretty shiny lights to keep me up at night. I sort of wish I was leaving with it.  So I liked Kill Bill Volume 2. While I am not a conouissour of kung-fu movies, I did appreciate Tarantino's tribute and his clear love and admiration for said genre resonated throughout. Now we now the entire story. It is explained chapter by chapter, like the first movie, chronological order notwithstanding. The fight choreography is excellent, as it is in the first film, but contrasting in that these fights are dirty and gritty unlike the slick and elegant nightclub scene with O-Ren Ishi in the first. I don't want to give too much away in case you haven't seen it. I think the two parts put together make for one of the best films of the year.  Still formulating my list of people to seek vengence upon...

      What a gorgeous Saturday! Several people have pointed out to me that the title 'Sarah's Entertainment Spot' sounds like a porn site. But it's not. And its free.  I am seeing 'Kill Bill Volume 2' tonight and am very excited. The concept of 'an eye for an eye' has been around for a LONG time (since the New Testament...there wasn't so much revenge in the Old) and I've been thinking a lot about Hamlet, and other such characters who have sought vengence upon those who have wronged them. Three films that come to mind are 'In the Bedroom', 'The Limey' and 'Memento' and 'Taxi Driver'.

I just got back from a massive sushi dinner at Planet Sushi and am feeling a bit MSG logged. Nancy is coming over in a bit for some girl gab and we may possibly watch some chick flicks. Refer to  urlLink The Anonymous Blogger  for his interesting Friday comment section on said topic.  For those who are wondering, I did not wear the Miffy suit today. The Museum hired a NYC actress to do the bidding. I did, however, try on the head piece. It was very heavy. No Danish Bunny dress for me.

They had spent the morning at work with mom or dad and spent the afternoon putting on a news show at the Museum with me. So basically, 30 kids came to work with me. I wish there was a bring your pet to work day.  I'm glad the weekend is here.

      I have a fantastic view of the Queen Mary 2 from my balcony. In fact, I am looking at the shiny lights now as I lie in bed typing this. I could post a sleu of commentary about Cunard, how the Greenleafs are personal friends with the Cunard family, and how Mr. Greenleaf likes to build ships but his son would rather sail them, but you'd have to be a 'Marge' to be in on the joke. I'm sure you are all sick of hearing about the 'Marge Club'. But applications are still being accepted.  'In Touch' magazine features a fascinating article asking the question,'Is Mary-Kate Olsen too Thin?' Okaaaaaaaaay. Apparently, she is much thinner than Ashley. They showed several pictures of the twins and to me they looked exactly the same, minus the fact that one is taller and blonder (is that an adjective? I think not)

      I taught classes today that were back to back to back to back...I have hardly had a moment to breath. I taught in the media center where older kids learn how to operate cameras and other equipment and put on their own news broadcast. Very busy day. I'm so used to teaching younger children that middle school kids are a big challenge for me. I find myself accidentally saying things like 'indoor voices' and they look at me as though I am some sort of alien.  If I don't do some laundry I am going to have to go to work naked tomorrow. Which might be okay because tomorrow we are doing a special 'Miffy' presentation and SOMEONE has to wear the life size Miffy suit. By the way, Miffy is a Danish Bunny who looks a bit like 'Hello Kitty'. How much do you want to bet its going to be ME in that suit? Now THAT would be funny!

      Ross: Funny Old World Susan: Funny Old World? Dog My Cats? Ross: Dog My Cats, indeed (David Mamet, Spanish Prisoner)  A frantic mother lost her child in the museum today. He was found on the 4th floor, completely unphased. The mother, however, was hysterical. I remember when I wandered off in a department store at age 3. I most likely was taking myself on a jolly ole shopping spree. I'm sure my mom had a panic attack. My mother also likes to remind me that I once peed in my pants in Macy's linen department. I was probably about 2 1/2. Then there was the time when Erin, Gina and I were...oh wait...I was 23.   so is it going to rain or not?

      "Remember, the shadows are just as important as the light" -Jane Eyre  Jane is one of my fictional heroes. Described as 'homely and plain', she gets the brooding stud using no manipulation other than unknowingly playing by 'The Rules' (which in the 20th Century are silly) but Mr. Rochester couldn't keep himself away. Got to beware of those seemingly quiet 'bookish' types.  I've planned a trip to the Bahamas in July and now am counting down the days until I am lying on the sandy beach in the sun. I really want to go parasailing but my friend Desiree told me a funny yet scary story. Is it safe? Has anyone done it yet? E-mail me if so and let me  know if I should attempt.

      Another long work day and I apologize to all the people whose e-mails have gone unanswered. I am getting around to it, I promise. But since I am no longer consumptive, I am a busy bee (much like the toy that could not be found for Beatrice the weimerainer).   Nancy and her pug Willie Bean are joining me and Zoey in the Dogwalk! Zoey is smitten. A true love connection has once again been established through a charity event. Since the conclusion of Sex and the City, Nancy is currently working on a new musical and I will post a link when workshops begin this summer. Stay tuned.  I may have found a potential enemy to wreak havoc upon 'Kill Bill' style. Problem is, he/she is someone I don't know masquerading under an AOL alias. Under normal circumstances, a random IMer may have been amusing but I've had a long day and it was just plain rude and annoying. My supervisor told me today that when she was in Japan she studied Japanese martial arts and purchased some Japanese fighting sticks (similar to swords). Forgetting she had them, she neglected to declare them in customs. Needless to say, when she did remember and told security she had 'weapons', chaos ensued! I need a trip to Tokyo.

Apparently, my version of Blogger may not be up to date. So much for owning the latest in Mac technology. Hmpf.  As I have mentioned before I am having a very busy week so I can't blog in depth too much. I am reveling in the glorious weather. I will most likely not have time to watch any new movies to critique.  I overheard an interesting conversation on the B train yesterday. A pregnant girl had just been shopping in the Bronx for 'Baby FUBU clothes' with her friend and they were discussing how 'the baby's daddy' had offered the girl a promise ring. She accepted the ring but pawned it in order to buy the unborn baby some clothes. She rationalized that she would have kept the ring had it not been for the unfortunate fact that she heard her 'baby's daddy' had also slept with one of her cousins. I was listening to this tale with my eyes closed until the other girl mentioned that *she* had in fact also slept with the guy. A large argument ensued and when I opened my eyes I saw that these girls must have been in highschool. THAT was the true eye opener. Kids having kids...it still astounds me.

      A simple Lester Burnham quote will some up how I'm feeling today.  "I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me...but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst...and then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my simple little life...You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry...you will someday."

      'Map of the Human Heart' is a good movie about tuberculosis. And now it's time for me to finish reading 'The Glass Key' (I was in a mysterious mood). Not only was Dashiell Hammett an alcoholic but he had tuberculosis. 'Angela's Ashes' is another good tuberculer read. I also reread the Helen death scene in Jane Eyre. Now THAT'S a tear-jerker. I'm in the mood for a little Sylvia Plath tonight. Haven't read 'The Bell Jar' in awhile. Didn't Buddy die of tuberculosis?  Actually, many authors I love had tuberculosis. Emily Bronte, Poe, Dylan Thomas, Robert Louis Stevenson, Tolstoy, and Thomas Wolfe to name a few.

      The pink Ugg boots I was on a 4 month wait list for have just arrived at my apartment in time for Spring. *rolls eyes*. I have caught a different trend on the rise, however. Over the summer when I was visiting relatives in Wyoming I wanted to purchase a pair of moccasins. Of course, they didn't have them in an 8 1/2. Now I hear they are this Spring's Uggs. Great. But take note...I wanted them BEFORE any celebrities were photographed in them. Recently I've been all about comfort.  Nice day to emerge from my death bed and go cough in public. Mr. N is coming over to 'talk'. And to watch Kill Bill Volume 1. I better go polish my sword. I was thinking about enemies and how I have none which then led me to think about the upcoming film Mean Girls (which you should all check out because my friend Danny is in it!). If I harbored ill feelings to certain 'Mean Girls' who did me wrong in Junior High, I could name one. Ironically, said 'Mean Girl' is on my Friendster list. We'll call her 'Ally' for the sake of anonymity. Though we were 12 at the time, she caused me embarrasment and resentment. She still resides in SF, dropped out of college, and would be an unsuspecting victim if I arrived at SFO equipped with my sword and vengence. Eh, it takes too much effort and energy to harbor ill feelings. 'Ally', consider yourself lucky, sweet pea...this time. You will most likely end up in one of my unwritten novels. Now THAT is the ultimate revenge. Sadly, I  don't think 'Ally' is a big reader.

      Big work week next week and god forbid I should pull a Satine and collapse mid lesson plan or something so I am staying in and catching up on my rest. Ijust finished watching 'Cold Creek Manor'on Pay-Per-View. It was bad. Very bad. Terrible. Thank god Stephen Dorff was shirtless or I would have wasted $3.95. Devil's throat, oh please. First of all, if you find yourself with a psychotic neighbor in upstate New York...GET A RESTRAINING ORDER!! Do not solve the mystery on your own. The best line in the entire film was toward the climax as Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone are about to discover a few buried corpses and of course it is dark and stormy and late at night. Dennis is all gung ho about getting answers stat and Sharon (who might I add made a reference to feeling 'trapped like a 19th Century wife') yawned and commented 'Can't we go home and deal with this tomorrow in the daylight?" My sentiments exactly!  I wonder if it actually is possible to purchase a house of such magnificance for only $250,000. Crazy Stephen Dorff and all. Compared to the prices I see in the Times that seemed very inexpensive. Not that I'm contemplating buying an upstate mansion. Maybe Mike Figgis confused pounds and dollars. Although with all the necessary renovations... Why am I even talking about this?? Bottom line. Avoid this movie. Watch Wings of a Dove instead.

      In my 'condition' (shall we call it that) I watched a movie that I never would have seen had it not been for my need for a mindless piece of entertainment easily accesible on Cinemax on Demand. 'Malibu's Most Wanted' turned out to be a lot better than I ever would have given it credit for. It was poorly marketed and I made sure to avoid it like the plague (pardon my poor pun) in theaters but I am glad that I gave it a shot. It's not too bad. I even laughed. The premise works and is sadly kind of true (a white kid from Malibu who thinks he is black). The true humor is Anthony Anderson and Taye Diggs, who play actors hired (respectively from The Malibu Playhouse and Juilliard) to car jack B-Rad (Jamie Kennedy), show him South Central and 'scare the black out of him'. Diggs and Anderson know nothing about the hood and their performance as actors pretending to be thugs is truly funny. Well, at least I laughed. Which made me cough. And I'm always a sucker for a good Juilliard reference! Yay J-Yard!

      I fell asleep last night reading the 'Death Bed Edition' of 'Leaves of Grass'. And I woke up this morning certain that my bronchial condition is on the mend. Seriously, apart from my lingering death rattle of a cough, I do feel better. This is a very good thing. Now I can unloosen the corset and strap into a leather suit, and fondle my japanese crafted sword before seeking revenge on my enemies. I am in serious Kill Bill mode. I don't have any enemies to exhault revenge upon so I suggest staying out of my war path, at least for the weekend.  So it looks like Bush is having a spot of tea with Tony Blair today. They want to send MORE troops to Iraq to 'ease the British/American burden'. Good God. This makes me have yet another consumptive coughing fit. With a touch of gout. Where's my snuff?? Also, could Rumsfeld quit being quoted as 'expressing surprise' at the number of casualties? If I knew how to do a sketch on my blog, I have a great one to go along with this image.

      I'd like to thank 'Clarence' for pointing out that I might ostensibly be suffering from 'scurvy'. I am so pleased that my readers have taken such delight in my 19th Century illness sagas. I most definitely have scurvy today.  Happy birthday to Greg, who told me that his office provided him with 'Fauchon' desserts. Nice. The countdown to my birthday has begun. But remember...I don't eat chocolate. But I like flowers.  I wonder how I can score a date with the Anonymous Blogger. Think he has an interest in diseases of the 19th Century? I could share with him my latest death bed poetry.

      Is it still considered 'dating' if only one person thinks he is in the relationship?? Just wanted to throw out that random question. My life is slowly evolving from a 19th Century novel to a Carrie Bradshaw column. How do we tell 'Mr. Nice for 5 months' that he may be Mr. Wrong? And can we do so without breaking his heart? (By the way, Mr. N does not read this blog)

      I feel change is in the air, and I don't just mean the weather or my daily 19th century illness. Certain people are not choosing to listen to certain message and basically things are kind of 'nutsy'. But I'm keeping my cool. I wish I could be more specific about this.   Who is seeing Kill Bill 2 with me this weekend?

      I am including a death bed poem/monologue and then the obsession with disease will be truly out of my system (both literally and figuratively). The antibiotics are working. Here is a poem by Arabella Eugenia Smith (1844-1916)  If I Should Die To-night                If I should die to-night,                My friends would look upon my quiet face                Before they laid it in its resting-place,                And deem that death had left it almost fair;                And, laying snow-white flowers against my hair,                Would smooth it down with tearful tenderness,                And fold my hands with lingering caress, --                Poor hands, so empty and so cold to-night!                I am now leaving the topic of 19th century diseases to move on to Kill Bill Volume 1 which I watched last night. If there’s anything that will make you want to exchange your corset and cough for a sword and leather jacket, it’s Tarantino. This film was fun, stylish, and entertaining. And Uma kicks ass!! Now I am eagerly awaiting to see what she has in store for Elle and Budd. This seems to be the year of women fighting back and I love it!

      I think I have officially run the gamut on films and novels involving consumption and have now moved on to poetry. I knew my collection of anthologies would come in handy on these rainy nights as I cough and cough.  In his modest room, a 25-year-old "lapsed" medical student in 1820s Great Britain wakes from a sudden fevered sweat and finds a single drop of blood on the sheet. He has known many patients who spit such bright blood. “It’s arterial blood…that blood is my death warrant, I must die,” he confides to a friend. One of England’s greatest poets, the medical student John Keats, never wrote specifically about phthisis. But his life and his works became a metaphor for generations of patients, a metaphor that helped transform the physical disease "phthisis” into its spiritual offspring, "consumption."   Keats’ life was defined by tuberculosis. At 14, he nursed his mother as she died of phthisis. A few years later he watched his brother die of phthisis, and by age 23, he had symptoms of this “hereditary" ailment himself. Yet, as the best remedies (bleeding, diet, red wine, opium) failed, as his work was savaged by critics and he was forced from the woman he loved (he could not marry because of the disease), Keats feverishly wrote his greatest poems: Ode to a Nightingale, Ode on a Grecian Urn, Ode on Melancholy.   He died only months after he first spit blood. Autopsy found his lungs completely destroyed. He was 26. To be dead himself within the year, Percy Bysshe Shelley, another young poet with phthisis, compared Keats to “a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished,/And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew/The bloom, whose petals nipped before they blew/Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste;/The broken lily lies—the storm is overpast.”  Shelley’s tribute expressed what would become the central metaphor of consumption in the 19th century, the idea that the phthisic body is consumed from within by its passions, “the bloom…Died on the promise of the fruit.” Shelley also likened Keats to an eagle that “outsoared the shadow of our night,” and “could scale Heaven, and could nourish in the sun’s domain.” These romantic notions contrasted sharply with the actual demise of tuberculosis patients, poets or not. As death neared, Keats himself contradicted Shelley. In “On Seeing the Elgin Marbles” (published posthumously), Keats wrote, “My spirit is too weak—mortality/Weighs heavily upon me like unwilling sleep,/And each imagin’d pinnacle and steep/Of godlike hardship, tells me I must die/Like a sick Eagle looking at the sky.”  In succeeding decades, Keats’ illness came to exemplify the so-called spes phthisica, a condition believed peculiar to consumptives in which physical wasting led to euphoric flowering of the passionate and creative aspects of the soul. The prosaic human, it was said, became poetic as the body expired from consumption, genius bursting forth from the fevered combustion of ordinary talent, the body burning so that the creative soul could be released. Keats’ great poetic output during his last year was considered a direct consequence of consumption.   Spes phthisica, which sought to make sense of the senseless and give purpose to purposeless suffering and death, came to be viewed as a prerequisite for creative genius. French author Alexandre Dumas fils wrote, “It was the fashion to suffer from the lungs; everybody was consumptive, poets especially; it was good form to spit blood after any emotion that was at all sensational, and to die before reaching the age of thirty.” Dumas’ colleague, the poet Théophile Gautier, wrote, “…I could not have accepted as a lyrical poet anyone weighing more than ninety-nine pounds.” A subsequent alleged decline in the arts was even blamed on decline in tuberculosis incidence.

      Earlier when I clicked on my blog one of the advertisements read 'Asian Bird flu news'. My first thought was that possibly I am going too far with my excessive new obsession with 19th Century diseases. My second thought was 'what is Asian Bird flu'? Is it something I can get? If so, I have it.  I bought a dress for the benefit. I am very happy. Picking out black tie dresses can be such a hassle. No where near as bad as bathing suits, though. I also bought Kill Bill on DVD.I haven't seen it yet but I'd like to before Friday so I can be up to date for the second one.  Tower was closing out 'Homies' so I had to buy series 6. I also found 'Palermos', a gang of Italians to compliment my collection. I love David Gonzales. Check out the Homies website. http://www.homies.tv/home.htm This summer, Mr. Gonzales is creating a set called 'Trailer Park'. I can't wait!

      By the way, my disease of the day is 'legionaires'. I know neither the symptoms nor how to spell it but it might be a nice break from gout and consumption.  My dad took a day off from work today and went to Pac Bell park and saw Barry Bonds hit his 660th home run. Bonds is now tied with his godfather Willie Mays.   I learned some interesting things about tuburculosis during the 19th century. Benjamin Rush believed that the disease could be caused by tobacco smoking (among other things) and cured by using opium, or by vigorous horseback riding, and eating a meat diet, as well as his bleeding and purging remedies.  Other "quacks" prescribed equally strange cures, including smoking cow dung, drinking a mixture of elephant's blood and milk, eating butter made from the cream of cows that grazed in churchyards, and eating mice boiled in salt and oil. Naturally, all of these suggestions were ridiculous, but tuberculosis victims were desperate enough to try anything! Some people believed that the disease was a punishment from God, and most doctors felt that tuberculosis could not be cured.  Tomorrow's disease is AGUE: Many books or diaries written during the 19th century indicate times when people suffered from an ailment called, "ague". This was an all-encompassing term for symptoms of fever, chills, aches and pains, nosebleeds, and a cough. What people actually had was Malaria. Malaria was spread by mosquitoes, and caused severe fevers, chills, and weakness. Victims suffered outbreaks of the condition throughout their lives, and were vulnerable to numerous other potentially deadly diseases.

      I want to give a plug to my friend Alison Muh who is designing bags which are making quite a smashing appearence on the West Coast. They are targeted for actors/directors/screenwriters/filmexecs, etc, to carry around accoutraments of LA film neccesities. But these bags are really cute and come in all styles and sizes. She is sending me some samples and I plan to carry on the style to the NYC fashion scene. Check out her website. http://www.surlygirlstudios.com/main.html You can order directly from the site.

      For a holiday that I don't usually celebrate, Frank and I had a fantastic Easter. Our turkey dinner went off without a hitch, we exchanged baskets of plastic colorful eggs and small gifts, and experienced a tryptophin (sp?) attack and fell asleep during the 90 minute Simpsons marathon. Eventhough it is raining, it was a beautiful way to welcome spring. I am calling in sick from work today because the bronchitis continues. I am on the mend, but as schools don't start up again until Wednesday,I really need the extra day of rest. And I have a note from the ER doctor.   A bad, bad movie is coming our way and I am counting the days. http://newyorkminutemovie.warnerbros.com/ Okay, laugh at me all you want but I don't hide my fondness for the Olsens. And come on, Eugene Levy is in it! May 7th folks!  On this week's disease list - ebola, anthrax, west nile, and elephantitis. Powerful death bed monologue to follow.

      The turkey is baking! It smells good. From what I can smell with my stuffy nose. When coming up with diseases (a la cholera, scarlet fever, consumption, etc), I decided that my new disease of the day is gout. Wasn't there a Medici who was referred to as 'The Gouty'? I like that. I believe that is treated with snuff. Perhaps one day I shall recover.  Interestingly, when women in novels are dying from such consumption-like diseases, men are always rushing to their death beds and lining up. Take 'Wings of a Dove' and 'The End of the Affair'. Isn't tubuculosis highly contagious? Why don't these fellows suffer the affliction given to them by their beloveds?

      I realize that I probaby talked to many of my readers on the computer not to long ago. For the past two nights I have been sleeping terribly. Yuck. I've been up on the computer doing some writing but mostly just visiting random websites. Thank you Phil and Gabe Anderson for helping me with blog settings.I need to test those out!  Yesterday I watched a movie called 'Identity'. It starred rain. Lots and lots of rain. And John Cusack. Who was very wet from the rain. The movie was called 'Identity' so the plot twist (if you can even call it that) related to multiple personality disorder. Kind of like Secret Window. The multiple personalities all got very wet. Can rain machines be nominated for Oscars? I swear, that machine was in every scene. Perhaps all the rain was a metaphor for the washing away of different personalities. I doubt the writer was that clever. I think the director just had a lot of fun with the rain machine. Mmmmm....water. What is it that women see in John? He is not as cool as his dramatically zany sister. Joan rules. I loved her in 'School of Rock'  Happy Easter. Frank and I are actually cooking an Easter lunch today...baking the turkey and all. Well, Frank is. If I was in charge, it would turn out like 'Pieces of April' (which I have not yet seen but want to).

      Can anyone help poor little me who is new to blogging?? I just want to find out how to add links into my text so they look neat and underlined (and not appear like long and rambling website addresses which they are). I've seen other blogs, also powered by Blogger who do this and I'd like to know the secret. I've also seen blogs with pictures directly in the text. Is this very hard to do? Please, please help! Oh, and how do I change the 'edit me' on the side of my page? I click on it and it says 'unavailable'. Hmm. If anyone has any answers please e-mail me.  Still getting over bronchitis. I had a great time last night staying in, reading, watching movies, and observing a party from my balcony at the Intrepid Museum. It looked like quite an event.  I am nauseated to report that a 13 year old girl was beaten and raped this morning in the Belleview Hospital pediatric ward by a man posing as a hospital employee. Apparently he had been prowling hospitals for a while. Is there no where we can feel safe?

      I'd like to thank my reader 'SI Resident' for e-mailing a correction to the story I posted re: the dog biscuit throwing leading to a car chase killing a teen in Staten Island. The girls did NOT in fact have baseball bats in their car. They called relatives who did (but we are not sure if they were aware bats would be involved). These relatives were called after the boys allegedly made 'kissy faces' at the girls and THEN threw dog biscuits. I still think most articles I've read are harping on the dog biscuit factor of the story (hence assuming the boys were conciously making some sort of 'final insult' which is just plain silly in my opinion). All I can say is that I'm sorry that a youth had to die but perhaps highschool students should be contemplating other forms of entertainment rather than car chases and possibly unintentionally offensive flirting with girls. How about a nice trip to the library? If teens can hold out for a while longer I may just get some of my adolescent lit published!! Not to make light of the story, however, and again, thank you, SI Resident. Keep the e-mails coming.  I want to keep this kind of secret (many details are still being ironed out) but I am working on a book as a co-author with someone that many of my readers may know and I think this story has true potential. It is a fictional novel loosely based on an event that happened in 1997. I really can't say much more. Sorry! But stay tuned!

      I was coughing so bad yesterday that I made a trip to the real life ER. I feel the need to specify 'real life' because I do so much commentary on NBC's ER. Boy oh boy oh boy. First of all, the good news. I have neither tuberculosis, consumption, cholera, scarlet fever, the plauge, or any other Jane Austen disease one might fantasize about whilst on one's death bed. My prognosis is acute bronchontis, so I will not be staging any martry-like death scenes a la Beth in Little Women. The ER at Beth Isreal was quite an experience and I did in fact feel like I was on the show. My ER doctor was very attractive and had even visited CMOM a few times (with his 3 year old daughter). I am in a relationship, plus I was woozy and sick but if any of my single friends happen to find themselves in the Beth Isreal ER ask for Dr. Jason Baumgarten and check and see if he has a wedding ring. He looks like Noah Wyle and has a perfect bedside manner. Maybe I just watch too much ER on tv. Anyway, I spent a while in triage, partly reading and partly watching the people who came in who were clearly sicker than I. Nothing beat the drug addict who shed his gown and ran around streaking the entire waiting area. They then put me in the 'coughing' section, amongst others with my symptoms. Did some more reading until it was time for my chest x-ray where I was led to what I refer to as the 'scary place'...the place where people are in beds and very sick and the gun shots wounds to the heads and heart attacks came rolling in. This was no fun at all. I got the x-rays done, got some antibiotics and was home in time to watch ER on tv. Needless to say, I slept until noon today and am STILL sick.   Happiness is a warm Lhasa Apsa. Zoey has been such a good medicine pet.

      The newest trend in Amsterdam? eyeball jewelry. Yes indeed. Six women and one man have been surgically implanted with eyeball ornamentation in their mucus membranes. Yikes.  Still working in Public Programs this week while schools are on holiday. Public programs requires less of my teaching skills, but as I experienced yesterday, in includes more heartbreak. Fox Five News aired a segment yesterday morning (which was actually taped last week) featuring my coworker Mike, dressed as a Mad Scientist,announcing that Dora the Explorer was going to appear...LIVE...TODAY!!! So Fox Five told an unintentional falsehold which henceforth made my morning of working at visitors services depressing. Dora was in fact at the museum last weekend but image my morning as I had to inform sad faced children clad in Dora merchandise that Dora was not in the museum. Sadly,she will not make another appearance until November. New Spanish word, kids...can ya say,"Luego"? But seriously, I really hated disappointing the little ones.  I'm thinking of seeing 'Passion of Christ' this weekend. I might as well see it in the theater. Then again, maybe I'll see 'Ella Enchanted'.  And yes, I'm STILL sick. If I don't have cholera then its most definitely scarlet fever.

      Cutting. From where and whence did this strange psychological phenomenom arise and become so prevelent? I made the mistake of watching the San Diego Real World tonight and before the show began a semi-professional looking man (either an MTV rep or a doctor?) announced the show was about cutting and that viewers should be aware of what a serious problem it is in our society. Now I have seen Thirteen, and as an aspiring writer of adolescent fiction I am sort of familiar with this disorder (is it a disorder?). I was disgusted by the way MTV handled it and exploited it for entertainment value. Yes, I know, this 'cutter', Frankie, has signed a zillion contracts with MTV and they own all rights to her mental disorders (disturbing point A), but they send her to a shrink and she says she is going to stop and thats it?? The end?? When Ruthie on Real World Hawaii was drinking too much MTV put her in rehab and the girl has been sober and healthy for 6 years. But back to cutting...has this always been an issue? I know anorexia and bulemia date back to the Romans and their 'vomitoriums' and I remember Princess Alexandra of Sweden in the late 1800s refused to eat and had a makeshift gym set up in her palatial bedroom...but cutting? This is new to me. I better do some more research.

      How Satine managed to perform her nightly shows plus do her *side business* at the Moulin Rogue all while suffering from tuberculosis, I'll never know (Indeed, while the film was fictional, Satine was in fact, a historical icon in Moulin Rogue history). I have a common cold and it was effort yesterday to walk the dog and work all day. I am feeling a bit better today.   I fell asleep early so I missed any news or tv reports. The cover of the Post this morning reads 'Fatal Insult' and describes how a 16 year old Staten Island boy was killed in a car chase last night after allegedly throwing a dog biscuit at the car of a group of girls and instigating a car chase. Was this really intended as an insult to the girls in the car or was the owner of the car a dog owner? And why did the driver of the car carrying the girls have baseball bats? Hmm. Let's get the facts straight before we blame dog biscuits as death promts. The boys are being blamed for throwing a dog biscuit but no one seems perplexed that the girls were armed with baseball bats? I am sorry for the death of this young man but the Staten Island feminists need to chill.  Speaking of dog biscuits, Zoey has 2 dogster pup pals! And thank you Debbie Norris and Family (and all cats) for donating to Zoey's Dogswalk fund! My little Lhasa has managed to raise a lot of money so far!

      Ugh, I feel that loss of an hour. Still feel sick but am going to work. The only reviews I can provide you with are of the tv shows I saw over the weekend in a feverish state. I did catch one more bit of humor on ER involving Romano setting his arm on fire while making tea. Is it just me, or is the stuff with his arm just plain comical? It's better than a French farce. His arm burns whenever there is a fire. If M. Hume was here she would blame it on his nervosity.  I apologize in advance to the patrons of CMOM on whom I may cough, hack, and sneeze upon today. I also apologize in advance to the exhibits department...I'll try not not to get my germs on the art. If this sickness keeps up I may leave early.  Happy Passover to all my fellow Jews and Happy day after Palm Sunday to all the Gentiles!

      Yesterday was awful. I stayed in bed all day coughing and hacking and watching my temperature rise from 99.0 to 100.2. I did manage to catch pieces of Jamie Lynn DiScala as Heidi Fleiss in "Call Me" on USA Network. Terrible movie yet it was funny because there were at least 5 different Rodeo Drive makeover scenes with 80s music playing. One might get the impression from watching tv and movies that if they decide to quit their jobs and hook in Beverly Hills that they are guaranteed a Rodeo Drive makeover with a neato soundtrack to go with it. And I must confess, soundtrack or no, a Rodeo drive makeover has always registered high on my top 10 wish list. I just don't see what you guys find so attractive about Ms. Jamie Lynn. She reminds me (appearance wise) of the Jamie from MTV's Rich Girls (who thought Ben Franklin invented the light bulb). She also looks like half the female population of Vassar. Why she made it in TV, I can't figure out. I don't watch Sopranos, however. Maybe she shows some magic charm there. I watched the Kids Choice Awards on Nick last night (Frank is such a good sport!) and the Olsen twins got slimed! Still sick today, but getting better. More rest and I'll probably make it to work tomorrow.

      As you can see from my double posting error of yesterday, Sickfest 2004 continues. The sore throat turned into a broncial like cough and being a semi drama queen I have been showing signs of both Camille and Satine (in Moulin Rouge). Come to think of it, Nicole Kidman would make a very good Camille. *cough* *hack* *cough*. Scuse me.   I plan to continue my routine of Robitussin and bedrest. I was invited to a press screening of 'Mean Girls' tonight for which I had to respectfully decline. How like a serpant's tooth it is to have a thankless cold.   Frank made me some chicken soup and Zoey has been alternating between licking my face and chasing her tail.  I heard on the news that Kelly Osbourne is now in rehab. Is this really news worthy? Can't the girl have some privacy? Anyway, I'm sure she has tons of family support (wasn't Jack just in rehab?)

I'd also like to point out that Claire is going to be my date for the black-tie Costume Institute Benefit at the Met on April 26th. I am looking forward to finding a new dress and rubbing elbows with all the costumes (and possibly certain members of the benefit committee). The theme is 'Dangerous Liasons'. As Jude Law is the dance chair, I wouldn't mind having a liason dangerous avec lui.

      Last night I felt a sore throat coming on and today it has developed into a full fledged nuisance (picture that adorable child in the Tylenol commercial who sweetly tells his mom "it'll huwt if I swawwow") which is exactly how I feel. Plus I have a headache and I'm freezing. Yucky.  Good day to catch up on trashy reading and daytime tv.

      Chapter 4. Sarah kindly asks her friends for a favor. (narrated by John Hurt) While the town of Dogville at first had no place for Sarah, the myseterious, well dressed stranger, they soon came to realize that she had many skills that could be utilized in the small town. All Sarah asked for in return was permission to post a blog entry pleading to her friends who may have more connections than she herself to help her in her search to find a copy of the film script of 'Dogville'. While the community was occupied in a town meeting, Sarah absconded to an internet cafe and posted  to her friends to help her find a said script. Perhaps by reading the ending, Sarah can know the outcome in advance.  I'm serious folks. Anyone know how I can get a copy of the script?

      So Sarah, what did you do yesterday? Well, since you asked, yesterday I conversed with a best actress Oscar award winner in my place of employment. To quote Ouisa in Six Degrees, I am not a star fucker, but it was still pretty exciting. Jodie Foster and her son were visiting the Monkey King exhibit at the same time I was teaching a school group and her son caught the gist of my spiel on Buddah and the Jade Emporer and the Journey West from China to India. She and I had a brief chat as my school group and her son eagerly played at oneof our 'video game' like exhibits and she said to me "You have a fabulous museum here. It must be such a joy working in this fantastic place". I smiled and replied "Yes, it is". What I REALLY wanted to say was, "It must be such a joy to win Oscar awards and  wear designer dresses". And for those who I know are wondering, yes, she is tiny. Very small indeed. And her son is adorable.  So I saw  'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' last night. I really liked it. It is not as witty as 'Malkovitch' and not as sharp as 'adaptation' but it contains an emotional content that the other two lacked. This effect is mostly created through the cinamatography (rather than the script) but I found myself feeling tearful as we watch Joel's (Jim Carrey) memories being erased from his mind. I haven't liked Jim Carrey this much since 'Truman Show', and Kate Winslet (who I normally don't enjoy) was  perfectly cast as Clementine. It is clear why these two characters where drawn to each other. Her impulsiveness and indecision balances his dullness and the development and eventual decline of their relationship (though it is seen backwards through memories) is very realistic and believable. The concept of the film is a great one and the message is clear. Even if it was possible to erase a painful experience/memory from our lives, would we or should we? Every experience, no matter how awful or painful, is something we learn from and grow from and it makes us the person we are today. Both characters realize early on that the memory erasing process was an impulsive mistake and in some humorous scenes midway through the film they try to elude the process by escaping to early memories. The brain is such an interesting muscle. I thought we could have done without the Kristen Dunst subplot. The ending of the movie takes us back to the beginning, like the revolution of the sun around around the earth...blah blah blah...eternal sunshine...I have to quit with these metaphors. Kaufman throws many of them at us, like he did in 'adaptation'...'Clementine'...orange, sunshine, etc. But watching Joel's memories being taken from him was really hard to watch. Anger initially made him want the process but when he begins to visit the loving and tender moments he shared with Clementine, it's pretty gut wrenching to watch that being ripped away. I give it 3.5 out of 4 stars.  I also learned yesterday that Dogville is part of a trilogy called 'The American Grace Trilogy' (Nicole Kidman's character is named Grace) and that Lars Von Trier may be making the next two installments. Giving credit where credit is due, I learned this from my friend and coworker William (who I might add seems to know everything about everything and everyONE). If I need a trivia answer...I ask William. If any of my readers have heard anything further about this trilogy (such as, is it published and can I buy it at B&N?) please e-mail me. By the way, I give Dogville 4 out of 4 stars.  Also, thank you Liz Jacobs for contributing to my Dogswalk fund! Your contribution is very much appreciated and Zoey will give you a big kiss!

      Sarah -- The Early Years  So how did I come to be who I am today? Strangely enough, I am fundamentally the same person I was when I was a wee child of the 80's in San Francisco (give or take a Master's Degree and some romantic heartaches)  Why do I insist on having red hair? Because Daddy Warbucks prefers red headed orphans. I was a method actor as a child. Either that or I had early signs of Disassociative Personality Disorder. I told my friends in nursery school that my name was Annie. When I started Kindergarten at my all girls prep school I pretended that my green jumper was my 'orphan rags'. Then I would come home and insist on wearing tutus or dress up ball gowns to dinner. It wasn't just Annie. One of the few temper tantrums I recall having was at Disneyland when my mom refused to buy me an 'Alice in Wonderland' dress. I even spoke in a British accent so people would think I was Alice. I also was Cinderella, Guenivere, Eleanore of Aquitaine, and Queen Elizabeth. Yes, my family traveled to England quite a bit.    And the shoes you ask? Carrie Bradshaw Jr.? My romance with Manolo Blahnick and Jimmy Choo was simply waiting to happen.

      I watched a movie called "Session 9". It reminded me of 'Identity' minus the rain machines. I guess making suspensful films about Multiple Personality Disorder must be more difficult than we think. Because this was just silly. I hate when the ending is guessable and the final montage is built up to be some kind of shocker. Come on Mr. Director and Mr. Screenwriter...we are not stupid!  New question. If I was a character in a movie, who would I be? You can answer whether you know me (in person) or by my writings. This is not based on appearence at all. This is for an assignment I'm working on for my class. Post answers in the comments section. Or e-mail me. Thanks for helping out.  Today is errand day. After a manicure and pedicure I plan to schedule in a nap. I just love long weekends.   Apparently, The Pope had dinner with me and  urlLink Sydney  on Friday! Click on the link to see the photo. I have no memory of him being there nor do I recall reading that he was in town. Did I dream this? Does Sydney really exist? Maybe I have Multiple Personality Disorder and I am actually Sydney as well as Sarah. Maybe I am the Pope. This might explain why I seemed to dislike 'Session 9', 'Identity' and 'Gothika'.

      It's funny. When I first started blogging the idea of using a psuedonym never occured to me. My name is out there for everyone to see. Type in a search for 'Sarah Ackerman' on Google and this website is the first one you'll find. So far, I have found this has not limited me in the topics I post about. I refrain from posting about dating experiences, a) because I don't date a lot (by choice) and b) because even if I did I don't think that it the type of thing I'd write about. I'll leave that to Cindy Chupack. Yes, my mother does read my blog. But you know, if I posted something about the rabbit pearl versus the pocket rocket she'd probably be okay. She's a very cool mom. I'm actually surprised I haven't written about porn yet. Everyone else has. I'll save my thoughts on that for next week.  SO...I had dinner with  urlLink Sydney  last night. Don't know who that is? You'd better click on the link.  Today is a gorgeous NYC day. I swam laps this morning and went sunbathing on the roof of my building to begin to rectify my paleness.   And now I'm off to the gym...  Happy Memorial Day from Sarah and Zoey!

      Today I am posting an e-mail I recieved from Marcie Hume (aka Icelandic Marge) and let me say it is so absurd. I just had to share the wealth.  Pros and Cons of John Kerry's Top Twenty Vice-Presidential Candidates BY JOHN MOE  1. John Edwards, Senator, North Carolina  Pro: Charismatic public speaker Con: Not likely to deliver home state, may outshine Kerry  2. John McCain, Senator, Arizona  Pro: Independent thinker, veteran, may draw Republican votes Con: Is a Republican, disagrees with Kerry on most things  3. Bob Kerrey, former Senator, Nebraska  Pro: As 9/11 Commission member, earned reputation as tough but fair Con: May be considered nepotism for John Kerry to nominate his own brother  4. Bill Clinton, former President  Pro: Oh man, that would be awesome—could you imagine? He'd be all like Yeah, I'm back, so suck on this, y'all and everyone would be all No way and he'd be all Way Con: None  5. Bob Graham, Senator, Florida  Pro: Decades-long career as America's most popular evangelist could deliver Christians and conservatives Con: Invented the graham cracker, which, frankly, isn't that great  6. Max Cleland, former Senator, Georgia  Pro: Close Kerry confidant, fellow Vietnam vet Con: Got ass kicked by a guy named "Saxby"  7. Paul Tsongas, former Senator, Massachusetts  Pro: Fiscal conservative, appeal could cross party lines Con: From same state as Kerry, died in 1997  8: H. Ross Perot, businessman, Texas  Pro: Hilarity Con: None  9. No one; anywhere  Pro: Would allow voters to concentrate on Kerry Con: Would not deliver a state, raise money, or do anything, due to lack of existence  10. Nancy Pelosi, Representative and House Minority Leader, California  Pro: Could lure disenchanted liberal voters who might otherwise go with Nader Con: As a liberal, hates America, would make religion illegal, raise taxes by 500 percent, move Capitol to France  11. Blanche Lincoln, Senator, Arkansas  Pro: Combines best elements of Blanche DuBois and Abraham Lincoln Con: No Democrat from Arkansas has ever won national election  12. Bob Menendez, Representative, New Jersey  Pro: Could solidify shaky support in New Jersey, lure Latino voters Con: Along with brother Lyle, murdered parents  13. Dan Quayle, former Senator, Indiana  Pro: Possessed of Robert Redford-style good looks, energetic Con: None  14. Ann Coulter, columnist  Pro: Flattering position would silence her exposing of the true evil liberal agenda Con: Is composed entirely of spiders and deadly snakes writhing beneath a latex "skin"  15. Shaquille O'Neal, basketball player, California  Pro: Can clog up the middle, blocks shots, requires alteration of opposing team's game plan Con: Free-throw shooting still an issue, recalcitrant  16. Joseph Biden, Senator, Delaware  Pro: Articulate speaker, respected among Democratic leadership Con: Delaware is a protectorate, not a state, therefore constitutionally ineligible  17. Ashton Kutcher, actor, California  Pro: Could "punk" Bush campaign with crazy pranks, make them think their president plane got stoled, and then he could yell "Punk'd!" and it would be funny Con: Sucks  18. A big pile of fudge; all over  Pro: Tasty, particularly enjoyed by women and increasingly obese nation Con: Perishable, nonsentient, lackluster in debates and speeches  19. Fourteen dogs from Ohio; Ohio  Pro: Everyone loves dogs, each dog could be different, like one's a mean dog and one's a cute dog and one wears glasses and looks like a computer-whiz dog, could deliver swing state Con: So many dogs could mean diluted message, can't talk  20. Jesus, Messiah, Nazareth  Pro: Would put Bush in uncomfortable position of attacking his personal Lord and Savior, could redefine Christianity instantly for political gain, likable Con: Mythical   As promised, here is a glimpse into my apartment!    For those going away this weekend...be safe and enjoy yourselves!

      I watched the 2003 remake of 'Peter Pan' (because Tamara had mentioned it on her blog) and I was impressed with what I saw. Even as a child I was never pleased with the animated Disney version and I was even less pleased with Robin Williams tromping around as an adult Peter in 'Hook'. This new version is mostly loyal to J.M. Barrie's writings with one major change...the sexuality of Captain Hook. Peter Pan is a creepy story. In Barrie's writings, Peter Pan and the Lost Boys are technically, well, desceased, seeing as how Barrie describes a 'lost boy' as 'a baby who has fallen out of his pram when the nurse is looking the other way" and who, if not claimed within seven days, "is never to be seen again". The film veers from the original story by taking creative liberties in combining the characters of Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. I found this descion to be very clever. Mr. Darling (in the original story) is very emasculated. The anger and the feeling of impotence, which lead to childish outbursts, become modes of social regulation that ensure that middle-class men will not enjoy consistent identities within the public and domestic spheres. Put another way, the full title of the play is Peter Pan or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up. “Would” suggests agency and choice. In Mr Darling’s case, the contradictions of masculinity may amount to the man who could not grow up. Faced with the impossibility of coming to terms with the eroding sense of masculinity as the demographics of the workplace shift and women perform clerical tasks but the imperative remains for middle-class men to be the “bread winners” of the family, Mr Darling “plays” the child at home. The play rehearses this regression when it moves to Never Land, the world of childish adventure that is an escape from the pressures of adult life. Captain Hook is almost always portrayed as a 'dandy' (probably because it was written in 1895 in the wake of the trials of Oscar Wilde). He is the only adult in 'Neverland' and well...he 'plays' with Lost Boys. And, come on, he lost his arm and wears a hook. Paging Dr. Freud! Don't we all agree this has to be some sort of compensation? In this new film, there is a great deal of sexual tension between Wendy and Hook (who remember, is the same actor as her father). The sexuality between Wendy and Peter is true to how I imagine it would be. Finally the audience can see why Tinkerbelle is so jealous. Add Tiger Lily to the mix and budding hormones reign supreme. Yet Peter Pan is oblivious. But isn't it true that girls mature faster than boys? Overall, I thought this was a great film about growing up (or the fear of doing so). A story filled with adventure but also endearing and touching. And yes, moderately creepy.

      Today is a very sad day. And it is strange that this morning I posted my grandfather's poem. As a Juilliard alum, I send my deepest condolences to the friends and family of Sarah Fox and the entire Drama Division, who's lives have been forever changed. I feel utterly shocked and in disbelief. There are no words to express how deeply sorrowful I am.

         Birth is a beginning and death a destination; But life is a journey. A going, a growing from stage to stage: From childhood to maturity and youth to old age.  From innocence to awareness and ignorance to knowing; From foolishness to discretion and then perhaps, to wisdom. From weakness to strength or strength to weakness and often back again. From health to sickness and back we pray, to health again.  From offense to forgiveness, from loneliness to love, From joy to gratitude, from pain to compassion. From grief to understanding, from fear to faith; From defeat to defeat to defeat, until, looking backward or ahead:  We see that victory lies not at some high place along the way,  But in having made the journey, stage by stage, a sacred pilgrimage. Birth is a beginning and death a destination; But life is a journey, a sacred pilgrimage,  Made stage by stage...To life everlasting.     ---Rabbi Alvin Fine  My grandfather, Rabbi Alvin Fine, was a wonderful man. Always poised and never judgemental, he encouraged me to pursue my dreams. He passed away during my junior year at Vassar but I think he would be pleased with my descion to become a teacher.

Teen angst and all.     urlLink Caren  discusses taking a walking tour of Dorothy Parker's old haunts on her blog. This sounds utterly fantastic! I once saw her ghost while at the Algonquin. I hope it shows up in the photo below. We shared martinis and reveled in stories while sitting among the round table.   "I like to drink martinis, two at the very most. Three and I'm under the table. Four and I'm under the host." -Dorothy Parker

      I taught a 1st grade class today about what a 'riot' is, and I don't mean the term in a humorous sense. Subject: 'Smoky Night' illustrated by David Diaz. Objective: To discuss Diaz's stamp illustrations and create our own. I was in such a rush to get to the Bronx today that I completely forgot the story revolved around race riots and an apartment fire and a young boy worried that his cat did not survive. Serious subject matter for 7 year olds. "Miss Sarah, why do some people only want to hang out with others like them? Are they scared of those people who are different? Why would they hurt each other? Why do so many people hate each other? Just because someone acts mean why do people think everyone else like him will?" These are questions I have been struggling with for 26 years. Some days I just feel like crying and saying "Listen kids, the world can be a shitty place and people can be deceptive and cruel".  Still feeling flu like. I think it must be spinal menengitis due to the fact that my back hurts. Does Noah Wyle make house calls? I think I need a physical.  So much to do at work this week. Professional Development seminars, summer planning, exhibit changes, end of the year school groups, enrollment classes, outreach, and arts festivals. Absolutley no way I can call in sick.

      I'm going to work today, flu-like symptoms and all. If I hold out until mid June I'll be on summer schedule which should (hopefully) be much calmer and I'll have more time to pursue my interests (currently napping, standing on one foot, roller skating on my hard wood floor, and playing the 'paw' game with Zoey). Isn't my life entertaining?  I read a book last night about high school angst. It's funny how as we get older our problems change and become more complex but our base emotions stay the same. The book made me remember how certain things in highschool felt like the end of the world to me. Ah how things change.  Today is my second to last time teaching the kids at P.S. 64 in the Bronx. I am really going to miss those guys. It's hard to say goodbye to a class.

      I am sick. I think it's the flu. It could be scarlett fever. Or typhoid. But a case of terminal illness never kept me away from work. I slept most of the day today and I still feel like sleeping more. *Yawn*. The kids in the Bronx are counting on me tomorrow.  My hairdresser sent me an e-mail today from rehab in Arizona. He discovered by blog in a search online. He writes that he is doing well but is innundated with affirmations and sing alongs. He also notes that he is one of six hairdresser in the facility. Isn't that funny? He writes, 'Everyday, someone always reads that poem about the footprints where some guy is walking on a cliff and there's like 2 sets of footprints. and then this guy gets to a really steep part, and when he looks back one of the sets is gone. And he goes, "oh, my father, why did you forsake me in my time of need?" and God says "Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, I was carrying you, don't you see? I hate this poem. Please make it stop!!" I have no idea what he is talking about but it sounds funny. I guess you have to know my hairdresser. I have been with him for 9 years now. He is from Berlin and tells me now that his life as 'The King of the Pah-tay' is over. He'll always be the King of my hair. Get home soon, Kristoff! Keep flirting with the cute male nurses! And keep reading my blog!

      Birthday weekend is over. But my apartment looks like a florist shop (or a hospital room) with all the flowers! Here is a photo of me and my mom from yesterday   and then plain old ME    A third-year drama student at the Juilliard School disappeared after leaving her upper Manhattan apartment in workout clothes, police said.  Sarah Fox, 20, was last seen Wednesday at about 5 p.m. wearing black spandex and a white T-shirt and carrying only a CD player and keys, police said.  "She told me that she was going to leave and that she would just see me later," said her roommate, Patrick Dall'Occhio.  Police said she may have gone running in Inwood Hill Park, near her apartment in the Inwood section of Manhattan.  Paula Mlyn, a Juilliard spokeswoman, said about 40 students and teachers from the school had combed the area around her apartment Saturday in an attempt to find her. Very scary.

      I saw 'New York Minute' last night. It's no secret that I've been *wanting* to since it opened. General opinion -- it was a children's movie that, like the rest of the Olsen's ventures, should have gone direct to video with no publicity. If you look at it in terms of a children's flick, it isn't terrible. The 6-11 year olds I teach would most likely adore it. From an adult perspective, I found the film to have some funny moments but over all, it was very unsettling. First of all, there is a bizarre undercurrent of racist humor not found in the other Olsen flicks. Sure, the direct to video movies contain the typical stock characters found in all children's films (ie. foreigners with accents), but 'New York Minute' was different. Andy Richter plays a white man who thinks he is Chinese and is a criminal involved in piracy (watch out boys and girls, he actually sells illegal DVDs and CDs!). He speaks in a Chinese accent, has an adopted mother (who actually IS Asian and *SURPRISE* is a manicurist!). And he knows some Asian kung fu moves on the side. The film also contains a scene set in a store in Harlem called 'Big Shirl's Bling', where the girls get a 'black' makeover. The script is bad--beyond bad. But most unsettling of all are the girls themselves. First of all, they are simply not actors. They smile for the camera as if they are being photographed by the paparazzi. Which in the 18 years they have been alive is all they know. There is something eerily 'beauty queen' like about them. It is as if they are not real and are some sort of digital creation. It also troubles me that they are so marketed...they are a concept rather than real people. I am going to pretend Eugene Levy was never in this movie and watch 'Best In Show' now. But I admit to laughing a few times. The hairless dog was funny. And I could detect (to some degree) a bit of Denise DeNovi's touch. Particualrly in the opening credits.  I had a dream last night that my very hot doorman, Bart, was the secret admirer who gave me the apple pie. He had a long chat with my mom last night (in reality, not in a dream) about computers and AOL. Now I have to find out his screenname. I'm only kidding. It's funny how much doormen know about the tenants. Bart has seen me come in and out of the building for 4 years now. Let's leave it at that.  UPDATE: A friend of mine in the film business just called. He and I organize kids screenings together (since I teach I know many children). And in return, he gives me passes to films I like. We organized a screening on Wednesday for a new kids movie called 'Spy Mate' (like Primate...it's about a monkey). Anyway, blah blah blah...he gave me passes to 'Stepford Wives' on Monday night and 'Bridget Jones 2' on Tuesday night. Both are at 6pm. Who is going to be my date? Yes, sadly I will miss trivia on Tuesday but come on...It's BRIDGET!!!

        Here is a 'sultry and pouty' picture of me. Two words almost never used to describe me. But compare this picture to the South Park picture in yesterday's post and you will be amazed by the resemblence!!!  I feel as if everyone around me is in love. Those people who are not engaged or getting married this weekend all seem to be blissfully happy in relationships. And you know, their happiness is rubbing off on me. It’s nice. I have a secret admirer! Someone anonymously left me an apple pie from the ‘Little Pie Company’ with my doorman in honor of my birthday. No card, no note, nothing! If this was a gift from someone I know, they certainly would have acknowledged themselves. So if this anonymous pie giver happens to read my blog, I say thank you! My friend Ben pointed out the enormously sexual innuendo of an apple pie. I must say I hope the giver did not have Jason Biggs in mind when he or she purchased this pie. Also, I have been compared to ‘band camp girl’ more than once. Probably because I am a dork. Except I don’t play a band instrument. Maybe I should pretend that I do. I’ve always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. Plus, I have a talent for impersonating people.   Dickie Greenleaf: You're so white! Have you ever seen a guy so white, Marge? Grey, actually.  Tom Ripley: It's just an undercoat.  Dickie Greenleaf: Say again?  Tom Ripley: You know a primer.  Dickie Greenleaf: That's funny. Margie likes that 'cause she's so white too.  Marge Sherwood: Yes, I do and you're not funny.   Like the original Marge, I am also very pale. I’m hoping to rectify that this summer. I’m not sure how sexy I’ll look holding a trumpet and eating apple pie being as pale as I am.  I need to sail away to Mangiobello and leave America behind. Maybe Dickie’s father will pick up the tabs.

        This is a picture of me when I was 3. And yes, I am on the potty wearing mittens and a hat and a bandaid for dramatic effect (there was no boo boo involved).  I had the most fantastic birthday. I want to thank everyone for making it so special. 2004 has been a fantastic year. Last year at this time was very difficult for me in terms of my personal life and while the difference between 25 and 26 is not so great, emotionally,I have really grown a lot in 12 months.   Work was blissful yesterday. Lots of focused children raising their hands, being courteous and respectful, and showing a keen interest in learning. I received flowers at work (from a friend who shall remain anonymous) and that made me feel like the top of world. Not that I have been to the top of world. Where exactly is that anyway? I received many cards and greetings (including beautiful hand made cards from the kids) and interestingly, I received a beautiful sticker-clad card from the grandma of my ex who I broke up with a year ago. (Does that make her my ex-grandma?)  One of the saddest parts of breakups is that not only do you break up with the individual, but you also break up with his family. It’s very unfortunate. I love his grandma very much. She is a wonderful and amazing woman who I still think about often. I e-mailed my ex back in January hoping to establish some sort of friendship (we were together for 2 years and he is someone I would like to keep in my life as a friend), We have shared so much…vacations in Italy, San Francisco, holidays, inside jokes…I just felt like enough time had passed and we had both moved matured and moved on from any weird or angry feelings we might have toward one another. And we were both seeing other people. Anyway, he sent me a response basically saying that he never wanted me to contact him again, never wanted to hear from me, did not want to be my friend. I had to accept it like a death. When someone cuts you out of their life it is as if they no longer exist and that also is true for ties to their family. Then along comes this beautiful birthday card from his grandma. It was really touching. Do I write back? I’m not sure. It seems rude to respond (for the ex’s sake) and it seems rude not to respond (for his grandma’s sake). What do I do?  I had a fabulous birthday dinner with The Marge Club which included my mom, Claire, and a brand new inductee (who I will refer to as code name : ‘New Marge’). I am very pleased to have accepted a new member to our club (our meetings usually take place over lobster dinners). New Marge has all of the Marge Club requirements. She is smart, well read, talented (a definite Marge prerequisite), and extremely funny. Dinner was great. And Claire managed to get her lobster bib stuck in her ear. THAT was funny! Once again there were Australians at the table next to me. But this time they were old business types. And they were also kleptomaniacs. One of them tried to steal my cell phone case.     urlLink Candeee  created a South Park character for me!!!! Those who know me will marvel at the resemblence, It’s astounding. I am very impressed!  Second birthday dinner tonight at the French Culinary Institute!

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I woke up a bit later today so I am sort of in a blogging rush. My team, The Felix (Six Feet) Ungers, came in first last night at Trivia. Perfect way to kick off the big 2-6. The table next to us contained a team of boys (men?) who resembled an Australian boy band. I kid you not. And one of them taught me the theme song to 'The Monkey King' TV show (which airs down under as well as in China). My co workers will appreciate this as will anyone who has 'played with the Jade Emporer's peaches' at CMOM. Of course, I have now forgotten the tune. Dammit. I was hoping to teach it to the kids.  My mom is coming into town tonight so a Marge reunion is set to take place. And consumption of lobster will be included. Not 19th century consumption. I got over that a month ago.

        I have two more weeks of teaching outreach in the Bronx before the school year comes to an end. I'm really going to miss those little guys. I'd like to think in some way I've inspired them. If only by amusing them by extreme lack of Spanish pronunciation (I tried to teach them a song and basically they ended up teaching me how to sing the words) and by the game they seem to love where I have them clean up by finding colors on the floor based on the colors of whatever wardrobe ensemble I have chosen that day. Seriously though,if even one of them chooses to go to the library and borrow one of the books on my curriculum, I will be so pleased. Or if they spend an afternoon making a collage of found materials, that would be nice too. They all have potential to be future Picassos.  So Gwyneth Paltrow named her baby Apple. Regis pointed out that if she changed her last named (Martin) to Italian she'd be Apple Martini.  Remember to wish me a Happy Birthday tomorrow!!!

      I finally got around to seeing 'The House of Sand and Fog' and I can't believe it took me so long to watch such a riveting and dramatic piece of cinema. I have not yet read the book but I'd be interested to know how the film compares. The story shows the American Dream turned upside down. An Iranian immigrant (Kingsly) buys a piece of wrongly siezed property at 1/4 the value so he can turn around and re-sell it at market value. The piece of property he has chosen belongs to Kathy (Jennifer Connolly), a recent divorcee and recovering drug addict, and to her the house represents her only link to her past; memories of her father and everything he worked hard to give her. Not to mention the house was indeed mistakenly taken from her by the county tax department. What ensues is a dramatic series of events spurred by both characters' selfish motivations for their entitlement to the house. The only character who maintains a sense of dignity and selflessness is that of Nadi (Kingsly's wife) played by Shoreh Aghdashloo. While she is trying to escape the immigrant lifestyle, she never loses compassion for other humans; an emotion dismissed so quickly by the ongoing battle over who is 'right'. The ending of the film is riveting. For anyone wondering what to get me for my birthday, this DVD would make a great gift!  Work yesterday wasn't so bad. The weather was gorgeous. There have been street fairs galore all over the West Side.  This is my birthday week so I am in a good mood!

If I wear the Miffy costume today, I will most definitely let you know. Most likely I will be outdoors seeing all goes well with 'City Splash'.        Last night's thunderstorm was fun. But I couldn't sleep last night. I bet everyone is sleeping in as I am drinking coffee and getting ready for a long day:(

      I'm very busy this weekend. That about sums it up.   A friend and co worker of mine is leaving New York to go to grad school at Georgetown and is having a going away party. I hate saying good bye to people I like. Sarah Redmond, I will miss you, but we will always have memories of Bette Midler in a mermaid costume singing in a wheelchair.  Movie scene that brings on laughter: The 'going into town' montage in 'Wet Hot American Summer'  Movie scene that brings tears: The end of 'My Dog Skip'. The inevitability of growing up and leaving childhood behind gets me everytime

      Was last night the season finale of ER? Do I now have to wait to see how the court rules on custody of Weaver's baby and the outcome of that crazy car chase/shooting with Mekhi Pfeiffer?  Something that has been weighing heavily on my mind got cleared up last night (having no relation to ER) and I feel like an anvil has been lifted off my shoulders. I love that feeling.  Yesterday I read a book called 'Star Craving Mad' by Elise Abrams Miller, an actress and former private school teacher. I was laughing so hard that I actually fell over on the N train. The book is about a single NYC 1st grade teacher in her 30s (with an active fantasy life) who finds out that the daughter of Hollywood's hottest couple is in her class. Her fantasies collide with reality and hilarity ensues. As a teacher myself, I thought this book was a clever and sharp parody, and it certainly made its point about our celebrity obsessed culture.  After reading it I was reminded to two months back when we first got our class lists for our Spring enrollment classes. I noticed parent 'Melanie Griffith' and daughter 'Emma' on my list. So of course, true to form, I was secretly hoping a dazzling blonde with skinny legs (or alternately her hunky Spanierd of a husband) would walk in with little Emma in toe. Turned out to be a different Melanie Griffith (still a beautiful and fascinating woman) and if her little Emma is not already modeling for Gap Kids or Benneton she should be. Emma asked me one day if I would cut the tag out of her blue velour summer dress because it was bothering her and when I checked the tag it was Juicy Couture!! Yes, little 4 year old Emma wears designer labels.  Friday is here! Oh wait, is it Friday? I am working this weekend. I wouldn't know.

      I am absolutley nauseauted by the beheading of Nick Berg. Iraqi's say it is retaliation for what happened in Abu Ghraib prison but that aside they would have found some other excuse to retaliate (perhaps for capturing Saddam). I'm finding that I can't even type much more on the matter because I feel the coffee I drank slowly coming up. Who would watch this beheading?? I pray no American did.  A recent national poll states that 46% of American students admit to cheating on tests. Many students have stolen copies of tests before they were administered. Maybe these children can steal a copy of the 3rd grade test so Bloomberg won't make allow one silly test to determine whether or not they repeat 3rd grade. So many schools have had to cut art,music, and drama from the curriculum due to funding (Bloomberg's cutbacks) and due to lack of time in the new designated curriculum (all they do is prepare material for standardized tests). It's very unfortunate.  This has been a very long week for me. And it only gets longer. Feel free to post me cheerful and upbeat comments. I need it.

      I think I finally figured out how to turn off my ichat (or IM feature) on my computer. Basically all I have to do is click 'block everyone'. I don't mean to sound anti computer chat social because I do believe IM is a fast and easy way to communicate with my friends (particularly the ones who live far away) but as I am not on the computer during the day and set my message to away, it's a hassle to come to home to zillions of IMs. And when I turn my IM off, the messages go to my cell phone as they did today. Some people don't give up. For example. Berdahl620: Sarah? Berdahl620: Hello? Berdahl620: u there? Berdahl620: Hello? Berdahl620: Sarah? Berdahl620: u Busy? Berdahl620: Guess ur busy Berdahl620: lol Berdahl620: hello? Berdahl620: what's up? Berdahl620: u there? Well, you get the point. And my phone beeps everytime this happens. Stupid me for forgetting to turn it off. And why do people say 'lol'? Can't that say 'ha ha' instead?  I got drenched in the rain today. yadda yadda yadda.

      This weekend marks the opening of our museum’s outdoor water exhibit ‘City Splash’. It also means I will be working Sunday and possibly Saturday. Things have been very busy at CMOM as the school year comes to a close. And I am tired tired tired. (Eloise’s Nanny always says things three times).  Last night I went to Tuesday Night Trivia at  urlLink The Baggot Inn  and our team The ‘Yo Ho Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rumsfeld (I’m Sorry)’ came in second! I’m still laughing at the team named ‘Naked Iraqi Prisoner Twister’.  My wallet has noticed NYC’s cab fare increase and I am not pleased. Yet another bone I have to pick with Bloomberg. At this point, I have an entire skeleton to pick with him.  I watched ‘Wrong Turn’. It’s like ‘Deliverance’ with teenagers. Terrible yet entertaining. This is what Netflix is all about! And lead actor in it is hot. I don't know who he is but I hope to see more of him.  One week until my birthday!

      I finished 'Win A Date With Tad Hamilton' and I must say, for a fluffy romantic comedy it was pretty cute. I know Josh Duhamel from our days of being dressing room neighbors at AMC (I would occasionally help him out by running lines with him and we would always laugh over the cheesy dialogue). His part as movie star Tad Hamilton is funny. Tad is a bad boy making an attempt to pick up some values but doesn't know how other than by spewing pathetic lines from his blockbuster films. It's still not difficult to see why Rosie, a small town girl from West Virginia, is smitten with him after winning a contest to be his dinner companion. After all ladies, wouldn't we jump at the chance to go on a date with Brad Pitt eventhough we know nothing about who he really is? Topher Grace loves Rosie as well (lucky lady) and she must decide between the hot Hollywood hunk who wants to date her and become a better person, and the boy next door who *truly* loves her. Who does Rosie pick? If I was any character in this film I'd be the advice spewing bartender. She was great! Nathan Lane makes another annoying appearence as, well, the same exact character he always plays. My overall review, this film has heart. Definitely worth watching.  Next up, 'The Cooler' with Bill Macy, Alec Baldwin, and Maria Bello.  Monday again. Back to work. My birthday is in 9 days. Don't forget!

      HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!!!  urlLink Click Here  to see a picture of me and my mom! Sadly my wonderful mother is in California so I will be spending mother's day with Zoey (after all, I am her adopted mommy). My mom will be in NYC in a week and I am very excited!  UPDATE: A couple was asked to leave the "Chuck-A-Rama" buffet restaurant in a Salt Lake City suburb recently after consuming 12 slices of roast beef, saying they are on a low-carb diet. Buffet owner Jack Johanson said that "Chuck-a-Rama" is not an "all-you-can-eat" establishment, even if "a-Rama" sort of implies that quantity is a big part of the menu for the flat $8.99 cost. The real question is, just what kind of low-carb diet allows someone to eat 12 slabs of roast beef? And shouldn't the fact that the roast beef and prime rib in such places usually is guarded by a fella with a big carving knife in a chef's outfit sort of a hint to pace oneself? The Leotas have said they won't be back to Chuck-a-Rama. Johanson's competitors must be delighted to hear it …

      I had a perfect NYC evening last night. Ate some wonderful sushi at Citris (the rolls I ordered contained mangos and bananas along with the  fish which added a sumptuous flavor) and I saw Envy 2004. The weather was divine and after a very long work week it was nice to be able to have conversation where I don't accidentally slip into 'teacher voice'. "Teddy, if you don't stop using your chopsticks as swords I'm going to have to give you a time out."   So the movie did not make my list of favorites. Jack Black (who I adore) and Ben Stiller seemed to sleepwalk through their roles as neighbors, torn apart by 'envy' when Jack Black invents 'VaPOOrize', a spray which miraculously makes animal feces disappear. Christopher Walken makes a bizarre cameo as a man Ben Stiller meets in a bar and helps Ben disguise the fact that he killed Jack Black's horse. Sound strange enough? Yeah. I say you can skip this film. Walken has been making some B-A-D choices (didn't he have a part in Gigli?). This movie had some funny lines but bottom line, it didn't succeed. It was directed by Barry Levinson who has no knack for comedy. The script was weak and film seemed rushed and thrown together at the last minute.  It seems I still cannot round anybody up to see Mary-Kate and Ashley with me. Come on...Eugene Levy is in it! I'll treat!   California Marge, who likes every fraternal twin, and also every red head who is turning 26 on May 19th, will see it with me. I may have to wait until she comes to visit me in two weeks.

      Isn't it amazing that the government can track a cow born in Canada almost 3 years ago, right to the stall where she sleeps in the state of Washington. They can also track all of her calves to their stalls as well.  Why then are they unable to locate ll million illegal aliens wandering around America.  Maybe the answer is to give each illegal a cow.  I went to a housewarming party last night for my friend Joanne who recently moved into a new high rise. It also happened to be her dog’s b-day so Zoey came along. We discussed whether or not I should attend the singles party for   urlLink Leashes and Lovers  on May 18th. I think it's shameful to set up single people using their innocent canines but the general consensus seems to be that I should go, simply so I can blog about it. If there are pitbulls present, Zoey and I are Audi 500.  Even better than discussing last night’s episode of ER, I shall mention that Noah Wyle, and his beautiful wife and child came to CMOM yesterday. Quite a thrill for me since I have had a crush on his character, Dr. Carter, for 10 years.   We tuned into Friends while gawking over Joanne’s amazing new apartment but I didn’t pay enough attention to comment on the ending.  Busy weekend ahead.

      I have to leave for work early today because I'm teaching in the media center. (picturing me as Nicole Kidman in 'To Die For' educating youngsters on the importance of media in society and having them put on a newscast in our tv studio). Unfortunately, our media center tech guru is in Belize and I have to work the equipment myself which is causing me a small panic attack this morning.  I love Netflix. What a great invention. Although I fell asleep watching 'Tad Hamilton' last night.  I'd like to give a plug to my friend and designer Alison Muh. Check out her collection of bags at  urlLink Surly Girls . She sent me some samples and I am currently sporting the pink director's bag. She designed with an LA based film business crowd in mind but I am trying to spread the style to NYC.  So no one wants to see Mary-Kate and Ashley with me this weekend? No one? Guess I'll be going alone.

I usually dislike her as a heroine so it was fun to watch her scream and flail and need to be sedated.

      Signs you have been living in New York City too long  1. You get very annoyed with out-of-towners who think the subway is unsafe.   2. You actively avoid bars that people from the outer boroughs frequent.   3. You figure that a date costs at least $200.   4.

You haven't "called shotgun" in a long, long time.   7. You think that New Jersey seems really far away.   8. You plot the Barney's Warehouse Sale on your calendar.   9.

At least one meal each week consists solely of drinks, olives, and nuts.   19. You eat Thai, Vietnamese, Indian and sushi at least once each week.   20.

You take $150 with you every night you go out: $20 for cabs, $20 for cover, $60 for dinner, and $50 for drinks.   23. You have gone out on 3 dates with 3 different people in the same week, but haven't spoken to any of them since.   24. You wear Prada shoes, Gucci sunglasses, a Cartier watch, and cashmere, but claim to be poor.   25. You think the only places you could ever live are New York, Paris, London, San Francisco or on an island in the Caribbean.	  Despite number 20, many of these are true for me.   Graduation is approaching and for those of my readers looking for a perfect gift I encourage you to purchase a copy of  urlLink Carrie Pilby . It's about a recent college graduate figuring out life in NYC.

      Yesterday at the dogwalk we happened on a booth titled 'Leashes and Love'. Assuming that it was quite possibly a brand new store selling designer dog leashes we fought our way to the front of the line to check it out. Turns out 'Leashes and Love' is a brand new dating service intending to match single, DOG OWNING New Yorkers. Now I have seen it all. This service plans mixers where you actually *bring* your dog and I guess true love is supposed to follow suite. Hmmm.   An action figure of Uma Thurman as The Blood Spattered Bride is soon to cross the pond and I will most certainly be purchasing one. I think McDonald's should endorse it and stick them in kids' Happy Meals. Nothing like a blood splattered toy to make a meal more appetizing! I already ordered a 'Pussy Wagon' keychain. Now I need a 'Pussy Wagon'!  A neighbor of mine won the 'Dog Look Alike' contest yesterday. He really does look like his dog. I think he reads my blog so I mean no harm in saying this!! His dog, Sheldon, is very cute.

      The Dog Walk this morning was incredible. I piled into a cab with my friends Nancy and Fay and their pooches Willie Bean (a pug) and Munchkin (a poodle) and off we sailed to 80th and Riverside to socialize, frolic, eat, drink, pee, and poop (the pups at least) with hundreds of other canines all out to raise money for a great cause. I can't thank you enough (those who donated money) for your contributions. There was an agility competition (turns out Zoey is great on the balance equipment), a doggie kareoke contest (she's not much of a crooner), a costume contest, free play in a fenced in area, lots of free give aways, and of course, the walk itself. It was like Disneyland for dogs.  Yesterday I saw 'Mean Girls' and I really liked it. Tina Fey did an excellent job with the script and really got to the heart of the issue -- girls manipulate and hold grudges while guys use force and it is over and done with. She used the comparison of the social heirarchy of highschool girls to that of primitive jungle animals. Her conclusion, girls act this way due to insecurity. The tragic ending- there is no answer or solution. I think the film is marketed wrong. It's not your average teen fluff comedy. For those interested in the subject of female bullying I'd like to direct you to fellow Vassar alum Rachel Simmons' book 'Odd Girl Out'.  I had dinner with aliens on Mars last night. No really. I did. One can take a shuttle to Mars from 50th and Broadway.

      I decided to join the ever popular trend of Netflix. I'm surprised I didn't jump on this band wagon sooner. Blockbuster stopped working for me years ago when I realized I owed more money in late fees than the DVDs initially cost. Because I purchase a lot of DVDs anyway for my library I am going to use Netflix to rent movies that I know will not be 'quality' films. My first two selections...'Win A Date With Tad Hamilton' and 'Gothika'. I guess now I have to wait for them to be mailed to me.   To avoid making eye contact with people on subways I focus on the advertisements. Most are for technical colleges around the Tri State Area. Some are for  Dr. Zizmore, who promises to give you clear skin in 6 weeks. Others are Poetry in motion. There is a poem about clouds that I like to read. Sometimes I make the mistake of catching someone's eye. This apparently gives them permission to tell me about how CPS is about to take away their children/their spouse is leaving them/they are religious converts who have found Jesus...I wish I could just disappear into that cloud poem. Maybe I need to take more cabs.

      Take the quiz:  urlLink "Who is your famous soul mate? (For Girls)"     Orlando Bloom  Gwrrr...you've gotten Orlando Bloom! A romantic English man that loves to recite poems..how lucky can you get?  Okay. I think I've hit an all time low. I actually took *another* quiz to see who my famous soul mate is. And even worse, I posted it. Have I no shame? Apparently not. I am here in my apartment watching Aline (the French dog groomer who makes house calls) work her magic on Zoey while I take quizzes on the internet. This is sad.  I don't even want to date a celebrity. After I left Juilliard I swore I would never date another actor. All I want is to meet a smart and funny guy who makes me laugh. Okay girls...remember in highschool when we'd develop a crush on that gorgeous senior and plan our outfits according to when we knew we'd see him in the halls? And if he spoke to us, even a brief 'hello', we'd get that 'tummy turning' feeling of giddiness that could make or break our day? Yeah. I miss that feeling. I want to go through my vast closet and decide I have nothing suitable to wear (even if I have plently of decent clothes). I want to look forward to the phone ringing if a guy I like is going to call. I want to feel as though I am having a heart attack and that I am tongue tied when I see him from across a room.   I am swearing off internet quizzes for awhile.

      Somehow my team won first in Trivia last night. I'm still not quite sure how that happened. But I'm not complaining.  Congratulations to Mrs. Alison Lindland (formerly Alison Albeck) on last weekend's nuptuals. Single in the City no more...  I really have nothing to say today. THAT is scary. Usually I can't shut up.  Today's Post headline: 'KEYSTONE CAPOS - Mob rat: I was comical klutzy killer'

      I'm going to let my readers in on a little secret... I am a subscriber of the New York Post and have been for a year. Yes, I recieve a lot of slack for this from my friends once they find out my guilty pleasure. But hey, I am a slave to page 6 and I eagerly await the brilliantly contucted headlines each morning. My #1 favorite still remains 'Splitney' (in regards to Brit's annulment). 'Tit for Tat' is a close second (Janet and Justin at the Superbowl). This morning the cover of the Post is divided. The majority reads 'Spidey's New York - Reel Life vs. Real Life' and in a smaller box at the bottom we see 'Liberty! Iraqis Rule Their Nation After Early Handover'. You know, at 7am when I am drinking coffee I openly admit to wanting to learn more about Spidey's New York hangouts. Ooh, I just LOVE the Post!! But if you're wondering, I do subscribe to the Times on weekends when I have a bit more opportunity to sit down and read the paper.  Trivia tonight! Hope to see some of you there!

      Overnight surprise -- Iraqi handover of sovereignty completed. It happened 2 days early. A free and democratic Iraq sounds nice but I still feel we all may be bracing ourselves for the summer of our discontent.  Sightings!! A friend of mine saw Fahrenheit 9/11 on Friday night at Lincoln Square Cinemas and reported that Michael Moore was hiding out in the back. (To read comments and discussion on the film see my posting below). I thought Jon noted an important fact -- it was Richard Clarke who made the desicion to fly the Bin Ladens out of America. Moore obviously ceases to mention that in his film. That aside, I reiterate that I really liked Fahrenheit 9/11.  Another Monday, another week.

        You are going to Marry Josh Hartnett. He is really shy, but don't let that fool you. He is really outgoing and sweet with those he loves and will be loyal to them for the rest of his life. Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry? (14 choices now!!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    According to this quiz I am going to marry Josh Hartnett. I think I'll take him over Orlando Bloom. I better call my wedding planner and let her know the change in the plan. By the way, this is a much better quiz. What am I saying? All these quizzes have silly and unrelated questions. Yet I take them and post them anyway. Go figure.

      At the Cyclones game yesterday they were giving away free American flags and hand towels with the Cyclones emblem and an ad for the U.S Army. Due to the heat, people were putting the towels on their heads under their baseball caps, etc. Yes, there were many 'towel heads' in the stadium. I turned over my towel to read the tag and found out that it was 'Made in Pakistan'. Interesting.

      The Manhattanite left her borough yesterday! Yes, I get a lot of slack from my friends for being 'lazy' and not venturing out of Manhattan for social events but in the past few months I have been to concerts in New Jersey, and Staten Island, and now I can add to the list a ride on the F train to CONEY ISLAND!! I also had a nice lunch at Two Boots near Prospect Park.  I ordered a rootbeer float which was served to me in a boot.  urlLink Phil  and I went to the Mermaid Parade at Coney Island which really was a lot of fun. The weather was perfect. The scantily clad merpeople must have been pleased.   Mermaids driving by!   And then some butts appeared...   She was one of the contestants  After we watched the parade we walked down to the beach and I was amazed by the lack of pollution. I was also amused by the number of pirates, sea creatures, and pre teens wearing glitter. But here is a photo of me on the beach.  The amusement park itself, called 'Astroland' is a mix of creepy yet intriguing, which is the way I feel at most carnival atmospheres. We rode the Wonder Wheel which provided some amazing views and also a ride called the Thunder something or other which blasted loud music as we spun in speeding circles. And you know what? Although I may need a chiropractor it was extremely enjoyable!     Phil and I went to a Brooklyn Cylcones game and the Cyclones won! They were playing a team called the Scrappers and I seriously thought the team's name was the Crappers. Not because they were terrible players or anything. Just because after a long day in the sun...well, my mind starts to go.  I did the reverse commute back to Manhattan and met up with some friends of mine who are in town. We went to a place called the Ava Lounge. A place where I hope to never go again. It was packed with college age kids and I felt OLD. I am not old. But I was tired and when a frat boy asked me where I went to school and what my major was I just had to laugh. I didn't stay long.

      I saw Michael Moore's 'Farenheit 9/11' last night.  urlLink Phil  provides a nice write up of the film's content on his site. I don't want to blog to in depthly about my opinions on the film until more people have seen it. But I will say this. I started crying about 5 minutes into it and didn't stop until I fell asleep last night. And I am still troubled by it today. It was really provacative and once again I commend Michael Moore for his sharp and stylish work.  It appears that  urlLink The Funayama Waitress  does, in fact, have a blog! hee hee! I can't wait to go back to the retaurant to provide her with more juicy morsels to blog about.  I'm off to the Mermaid Parade in Coney Island today and then to a Cyclones game.

      Take the quiz:  urlLink "Which sexy man will you marry?"     Orlando Bloom  your going to marry Orlando....he's a real sweetheart but he isn't a wimp! He loves taking risks!  Apparently Orlando Bloom is my future hubby. We all know these quizzes have 100% accuracy. I better start picking out my dress and deciding who my bridesmaids will be.  Yesterday, I was stuck in traffic on 23rd Street with a crazy cabbie who occupied the time by telling me a joke about office sexual harrasment involving a blond and a midget. Only later did I realize that in telling me this joke he was sexually harassing me.   I am so glad it is Friday.

      Last night I went to  urlLink The Knitting Factory  to go to  urlLink Ned Vizzini's  party for his new book  urlLink 'Be More Chill' . I utilized my networking skills to get on the 'private party' list for the open bar from 7-9 but once I got there I saw that Ned is such a great guy he probably would have let anybody in. It's public knowledge that I have a little crush on 23 year old Ned. I mean no harm to his girlfriend in saying this. I hear she is a great person. Anyway, he signed my book, "To Sarah, Thanks! Enjoy the book! Rock on!"  urlLink Dave  pointed out that in writing this Ned assumed that I already 'rocked', thus I would I have to continue my alleged rocking by keeping on with it. It is debateable whether or not I already rock. But if I don't. I'd certainly like to start. I'd hate to disappoint Ned.  At the party  urlLink Caren  and I met a friend of Ned's named Daryl who is a fellow blogger. Check out his site. I like it.  urlLink DarylLang.com . We had dinner last night at Funayama. We closed the place down. I'd like to give a mention to  urlLink Michael Malice  who may or may not read my blog. Caren says he introduced us to the fabulous Funayama. I am not going to blog about out dinner conversation. I'll leave that to Dave or Caren. Or perhaps the Funayama waitress with the clear braces. For all I know she could have a blog of her own.

I'd like to give a White Chick SHOUT OUT to my friend Jen Carpenter who is appearing in the new Wayans Brothers film opening on Friday. Yes, it is called 'White Chicks'. She is the girl in the middle of the photograph above in between my friend Will and me.

      This morning on NBC's 'The Today Show', Al Roker waved his arm toward the crowd standing outside Rockefeller Center and proclaimed "Good Morning! What a crowd! We have people here from all walks of life!" This may be true but from the camera shot all I saw were tourists waving signs and eager for some camera time.   Check out  urlLink Ned Vizzini's  book 'Be More Chill'. And while you're at it buy his other books. I recommend them. Yes, I really do.   Farenheit 9/11 opens on Friday. I overheard my neighbor having a conversation about it in the elevator and he kept saying "I can't wait to see Roger Moore's new movie!!" Perhaps he was confused because Michael Moore also made 'Roger and Me' or maybe he was just clueless.

      Change is slow. Sometimes positive changes feel too slow and then I find myself frustrated that I can’t become a one-woman army and take on all of life’s causes myself. Those who know me know that I tend to keep my political views  to myself and those who know me well know my reasons for this. But if anyone is curious I am a registered democrat. I often fall asleep at night fantasizing about what charities I would give money to if I had a million dollars. Yes, I know, money doesn’t solve everything. But I have spent a big part of my past 4 years in NYC volunteering for benefit committees which is my little way of doing my part. I know. I’m not Angela Jolie off rescuing women in Cambodia or bringing food to Somalia. But I try to do what I can.  I saw the revival of The Normal Heart at The Public Theater and I was thoroughly riveted. My friend Alison Miller, who is stage managing, was able to give me comps and I am so glad to have seen such a fabulous and moving production. I think I audibly gasped in attempt to hold back a sob during the last scene (which was embarrassingly apparent from our seats in row A). I was just an infant in San Francisco when an unnamed virus began claiming the lives of gay men. As I grew older I remember family friends dying of ‘cancers’, but information was still very scarce and nobody knew exact details. And in 1985, Larry Kramer (who is the founder of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis) wrote The Normal Heart, expressing his anger and rage toward the government and the gay community for ignoring the disease and thus perpetuating it. The 10 deaths from Tylenol received more media coverage and worry.  The play’s relevance today is abundant. While governmental organizations have become significantly more attentive to HIV (largely due to Kramer’s revolutionary second organization, ACT-UP), the rate of infection is rising rapidly in New York City, in the United States, and around the world. New medications have become synonymous with a cure for an increasing number of gay men who hubristically dismiss condoms as archaic. The Bush administration prefers to pour billions of dollars into the wrongheaded practice of encouraging kids to remain abstinent as opposed to teaching them how to safely manage their own burgeoning, bewildering and undeniable sexualities. And the same establishment that ignored the “homosexual cancer” less than twenty years ago, now shuns third world countries as AIDS ravages their entire (largely heterosexual) populations.  It was really an amazing evening of theater. If anyone is interested send me an e-mail and I can hook you up with tickets.

        HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!!!  I wish I could be with my dad to celebrate but he is perfectly content because the Boston Red Sox have been in San Francisco (which I guess is a rarity). My dad (Lloyd Stuart Ackerman III) has several names : Lloyd, Lyd, Lydia, Steven (with a 'v'), Steve-O, and California Homer. He is an asbestos lawyer and works very hard during the week so he enjoys relaxing on weekends. My mom takes him to all sorts of cultural events such as the theater (he likes musicals), but he has nice snoozes through non musicals, the opera and the symphony. His favorite thing to do on weekends? Go to Pac Bell Park and cheer on the SF Giants. And during football season he goes to 49ers games. He has season tickets. While I am not a fan, these tickets made me very popular with the boys in highschool. My dad is also a novice snorkeler and can be found falling down while wearing flippers and a mask on the beaches of Hawaii and the Bahamas. (I wish I had a picture of that!) Best of all, my father is the least judgemental person I have ever met. He has a very open mind. He also has a knack for making silly jokes. 3 out of 10 of them are funny. Here's to you daddy! I love you.

      In between phone calls and e-mail checking I managed to watch the following movies last night. I'm not sure they can be classified as 'tear jerkers' but I had to go with the selection I had on hand because Netflix only sends me 3 at time. And I currently have 2 of the Season 4 Simpsons DVDs checked out.  American Beauty Suburban anybody Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) spends the entire movie beefing himself up and transforming himself into the kind of guy his daughters jailbait best friend would sleep with, suburban anybody Lester Burnham stares at a picture of his wife and child and realizes that for all of his efforts to make his life so much better, he’s had the potential for never-ending happiness from these two people all along, so distracted by their beauty that he doesn’t even notice until the film’s climax. This film reminds me that beauty is all around us if we simply take the time to stop and look closer. I love this film so much that I can't even describe it.  Edward Scissorhands  As our blade-fingered protagonist (Johnny Depp) delicately carves away at an ice sculpture, the angelic Kim (Winona Ryder) dances in the descending flakes. Visually arresting and almost dream-like in its execution, you’ll never be hard-pressed to find a more accurate image of what love is all about.  Leaving Las Vegas  Drunk and on the brink of alcohol-related death in a seedy hotel room Ben Sanderson (Nic Cage) weakly fumbles around his crotch in order for one last hit of sexual pleasure. Having tracked him down, mentally-and-physically-exhausted prostitute Sera (Elizabeth Shue) slowly moves his hand away and climbs on top, easing him through his dying moments and ending a whole films worth of tender but as yet unexplored love. As she climaxes, he shuffles from this mortal coil and she is left with nothing to do except hold his lifeless corpse for what seems like forever. That breaking sound you hear? That’s your heart. Well, it made me cry. Bleak and terribly depressing.  Stella I watched the remake with Bette Midler and not the original. Mother/daughter movies always make me cry. And the scene where Jenny is all dressed up in the pretty pink dress that Stella worked so painstakingly to make and then nobody comes to her birthday party makes me cry. Also when Jenny is about to leave for New York to see her father after fighting with Stella and then Stella comes to meet her at the airport with a new sweater and they hug and cry and apologize and tell each other how much they love one another. There is nothing like the mother/daughter connection.   So I cried a lot, went through a lot of tissues and now feel utterly cleansed. But I ended the evening by watching Marge Simpson star in 'Streetcar The Musical!' That is such a great episode. Maybe it was my mood by even that made me cry. Homer's conversation with Marge in the last scene was so touching when he tried to tell her that he liked the play!  Okay, off to South Street Seaport.

      Al Pacino came to the Children's Museum today! I was walking back into the office on the 4th floor and there he was with his 2 kids (twins?) and the nanny. He seemed almost more excited by the place than his children did. He was playing with all the exhibits while his children looked on curiously. I thought it was sweet that he was so adament about having them hold the handrail as they were on the stairs. He asked to use the staff bathroom (which is in our office and closed to public) but obviously much cleaner than the public bathrooms used by the kids. It is a one room one stall bathroom which he entered by himself. He was immediately followed by my coworker Peggy who claimed he peed all over the seat. Hmmm.  I learned today that Sephora has ceased carrying Phytodefrissant (the anti defrizzant hair gel I use after showers). First Sephora discontued Philosphy Memory. And now this. It is all a plot so I can have a big ongoing bad hair day this summer. I am very peeved. This means I will have to sclep my ass to Barney's and I just have no time to do that. So bad hair days it shall be. I guess I'll just wear it curly for a while. But trust me, cute it is not.  Okay, time for my tearjerker movie fest! Thanks for all the great suggestions. I'll let you know what I chose and how it registered on a sob scale.

Please update this information in your palm pilots. I would except that I don't use a palm pilot. I hate them.   I'm looking to rent some movies that will make me cry this weekend. I'm in the mood for some good tear jerkers. Any suggestions? I have 'Stella' on hand just in case. That one always gets me. My Friday night plans are as follows:  -Come home from work  -Walk dog  -Put on comfy 'apartment pants'  -order food  -watch depressing movies that will make me cry  -cry  -blow nose repeatedly  -make microwave popcorn  -check e-mail  -watch more depressing movies  -cry more  -blow nose even more  -go to bed   Sometimes a girl just needs a night to herself to 'recharge'.   I am involved in a work related 'Fox and Sox' performance at South Street Seaport on Saturday. Please avoid seeing me be 'Seussical' at all costs. Unless you have small children and are interested in a CMOM membership.

      In answer to the question posed by Howie and Peter in my comments section, 'Omar' is Omar Gooding, one of the hosts of Nickelodeons 'Wild and Crazy Kids'. I didn't even realize that was an option in the quiz. (I was sort of hoping Peter would be 'You Can't Do That On Television' because he is Canadian) I never watched 'Wild and Crazy Kids' when I was growing up but I catch it every now and again on digital cable because my friend  urlLink Donnie Jeffcoat  was also a host. Donnie is my age, all grown up now, but still likes to do 'wild and crazy' things such as dress up and attend Renaissance Festivals. I believe this picture of us was taken on 'Ye Olde Kissing Bridge'. And yes, those are cups of meade we are drinking. There is an inner renaissance in all of us.    I am scheduled to teach some groups from the Lyfe (Living for the Young Family through Education) Program today and I am very excited. LYFE centers provide day care facilities for the infants and toddlers of students still attending school and provide for their specialized needs. So basically I will be teaching a group of girls from Brandeis Highschool AND their babies and toddlers...ooh, I just LOVE babies!! I know the babies are going to have a blast at the museum.

      After much annoyance, I have finally figured out how to post pictures in a more viewable size.   This is a photo of my friend Nancy (looking very Judy Davis-esque) and Zoey in my red walled apartment. Nancy composed the music for 'Sex and the City' and is currently working on an upcoming musical set to be workshopped on July 26th. I'll certainly be in attendence and I hope some of you will come and support her new work as well. Michael Patrick King (Sex and the City's Executive Producer) is collaborating with her so I have great expections for an entertaining show. I'll post further details as the date gets closer. Nancy is the owner of a pug named Willie Bean who is one of Zoey's closest compadres.  I ate way too much today. My team came in first at trivia tonight. Interestingly, there was a guy named Bob who knew quite a few of the answers in the audio round. Could this have been *the* Bob?? He also knew many facts about 19th century diseases. I was unduly impressed. I was also amused when the new waitress Emma told me that *her* name was Bob. I think some sort of Bob club has taken over NYC. I wish Tamara and Allie had been there. They would get a kick out of trivia. I won some Mardi Gras beads and I didn't even have to flash my tatas!

      Today is the Tuesday of my friends doing cool and amazing things so I am going to give them both plugs and hope that my NY readers will be able to check out either of these excellent events.  1)  urlLink Ned Vizzini  hosts the Reading Series at Barbes in Brooklyn with (my friend)  urlLink Caren Lissner ,  urlLink Jackie Corley , and  urlLink Jeff Sommers . 7pm. 376 9th St. @ 6th Ave. (F to 7th Ave. in BK, walk downslope 1 block). It's free! The theme is summer camp. As young humans get shipped off, the authors will share camp- and summer-related tales of woe and triumph. And there will be shtick! Readers will come armed with questions about the author's work and maybe Caren can win a prize!!  2)  urlLink Sydney  is cohosting trivia tonight at 7pm at the  urlLink Baggott Inn . She may blush, she may make ME blush by mentioning Farty Pants. Her questions are sure to be good ones. And her prizes will kick ass.  So where will I be tonight? Busy with important FBI business. Because I am Agent M.B Switzerland and I am in the process of tracking down a...(oh wait...my agenda is top secret). But perhaps it shall lead me to one of these events. It's difficult being an undercover agent.   Par-tay today at work!! Pray for no rain. Let's do a reverse rain dance.

      If anyone feels like buying me a gift for no good reason they could get me a copy of 'My So Called Life' on DVD. Yes, that would make me truly happy.  We are having a summer par-tay at work tomorrow. Since I have been working at CMOM we have never had a staff party. I must say I am very excited. It is set to take place in our outdoor water exhibit 'City Splash'. I hope it doesn't rain.

      The weekend is over already. Today I went in to work for a few hours to edit some lesson plans that have to go to the printer tomorrow, had a get together with some friends and their dogs (yes, Zoey has a social life too!) and had dinner with  urlLink Sydney .  If I was in the FBI my name would be Agent Marge Bronte Switzerland. Remember that. It may come again later.  I've always known the writings of  urlLink The Anonymous Blogger  to be cynical, particulary when it comes to women and dating, but his views are really beginning to surprise me. I am an avid blog reader. I like to read other people's blogs and hear what other guys say about women and dating. And mostly I understand where they are coming from. Usually I can relate due to situations I have been in (from previous relationships) and I always appreciate the unsolicted candor and honesty found in blog writing. That being said, I give Bob kudos for stating his opinions and speaking his mind. However, I am as shocked by some of his posts as I am when I read editorials in highschool newspapers -- lots of strong opinions but few facts or experiences to back them up. For example, he writes that if a woman uses subtle means to ask a man out, she is just using a safety net to avoid rejection. This is not true. Not everybody fears rejection so strongly. I think rejection is only hurtful if it comes from someone I have invested emotion in. Not someone I have met once. I am not afraid to ask men out. I simply choose not to. I have been the agressor before and it has only brought me indesicive men who aren't given the thrill of the chase. A lady has to leave a man wanting more. I just want to say to Bob that not everything related to dating has to do with fear of rejection. I think we get over that in highschool. As we get older, we date different people (try them on for size, as it may be) in order to find the one that fits perfectly. There are obviously exceptions to this of course...people who date for religion, for social background, because of their biological clocks, etc. but in general I think we are all searching for that comfortable and perfect fit. Now as to whether or not there is a perfect match for everybody, I don't know. I'd like to think so. You married readers will have to answer that for me. I thought I found the perfect fit but I was wrong. Rejections will happen along the way but the pain stems from the break up, not from someone turning down a request for a date. That is small potatos compared to what could be lost by not even trying. So here is my point (yes, I really do have one!) If you are the type of woman who is down with asking guys out, go for it. I happen to be a bit more old fashioned. And Bob, this doesn't mean that I walk 10 paces behind my dates, don't wish to own property, or am not a registered voter. Why does everything have to be all or nothing with you? There is a happy medium, you know.

      So, I like totally just got back from an Aaron Carter concert in Staten Island. Seeing as how I was somewhat pretentious and bratty in highschool (who, MOI?!) I find that I need to live out youthful fantasies of 12 year olds now that I am 26. I watch Degrassi Junior High, I watch The Olsen movies, I see all Lindsey Lohan films (are they films?), etc. And I am fortunate to have friends such as  urlLink Caren  and  urlLink Valerie  to induldge in these guilty pleasures with. And indulge we did. We met for sushi at Funiyama and from there we headed to the Staten Island Ferry and observed some MTA guard dogs who seemed eager to sleep on the job. If I was an MTA worker, I'd want to have a big ol' pit bull. Or maybe a lhasa who looked gentle but was secretly very vicious. Anyway, I hummed the theme song from 'Working Girl' while looking at the NYC skyline and pretended that I had some hot shot investment banking job and Harrison Ford was my lover.   We reached the stadium and were greeted by peals of screams. And some opening acts featuring scantily clad young preteen girls who seemed like they were warming up for a Playboy video shoot. It was kind of disturbing. I became distracted by playing a hypothetical question game involving the sketchy looking pierced and tatooed sound guy who happened to be operating the sound system which was right next to me. "Would you rather spend 5 years in prison or sleep with the sound guy once?" I am easily amused. Caren and Valerie and I 'got jiggy' to the tunes of the BAHA men (remember, this show was sponsered by Radio Disney).      Hulk Hogan and his daughter made an appearence.His daughter, who is a Britney Spears doppleganger is Aaron Carter's new fling. Anyway, Aaron was adorable. He had tons of energy and we stood on our chairs along with the rest of the 5th graders and grooved to the tunes of a pop star whose career is looking for a pick me up. Poor kid. Age 15 and he is already needing a career boost. Good thing his manager Lou Perlman was there.   Lou Perlman is the former manager of the Backstreet Boys and Nsync as well as being the owner of Transcontinental Records. JC Chasez once claimed that Lou put the 'con' in Transcontinental and apparently he is correct, because Perlman is the owner of the Wilhemina Scouting Network (also known as Options Talent and Transcontinental Talent), which was exposed as a scam on NBC's Dateline show. I must say, meeting him was quite exciting. Folks, never underestimate the fun that can be had at an Aaron Carter concert. Three NY/NJ girls had a blast and it is an experience I will never forget. Aaron Rulz!!

      Eventhough today was a new holiday of the Reagan variety, I still had a full day of work which meant no time on the computer to respond to the fabulous comments I recieved from my ever wonderful readers. Blogging can be so theraputic. I taught the mo  of 3 and 4 year olds today from The Brick Church School. I was giving my normal spiel about important rules to follow while in a museum ("Okay boys and girls, who can raise their hands and help me think of some rules we want to follow?") and this 4 year old with big brown eyes blurted out "Turn off all cell phones!!" It was hilarious! Only in New York.  And speaking of New York...I met  urlLink Tamara and Allie !!! Yes, THE Tamara and Allie, in New York from LA for the weekend.    A blogging friendship has been made. It was really amazing. I feel like I have known them forever (and not just because of blogging). We are very similar people with similar interests and after awhile, I forgot that I had just met them and they did not, in fact, live in NYC. We lounged in an area with several names (was it Bleeker and Jones? Or Thompson and 4th? No wait...I think it's Father Demo Place!!) And if you are wondering, Father Demo is the patron saint of stolen sunglasses. Allie's entire world was colliding (I met her friends from highschool and college) and she was having a glorious New York evening galavanting with firemen (do they have Master's Degrees, Tamara?) and 16 year old boys. But hey, I got hit on by a 12 year old busboy who was sweeping the street. (I'm getting into character for my evening with Aaron Carter tommorrow!) Allie and I posed with a Red Bull car   I had an evening of laughs and I hope to see them again before the weekend is over.

      I've been accused several times of being 'selfish'. Never 'insensitive', or 'incompassionate'...simply 'selfish'. Usually this word is used by my ex boyfriends (which is understandable) but it has also been used by family members (later revoked and apologized for) and a few close friends with whom I have argued with. I pride myself on being a good and considerate friend, sensitive to what others are feeling, and a genuinely hospitable person. But it's sometimes hard for me to balance the line between being a good friend and taking care of my own needs. Sometimes, rather than going out on a Friday night, I'd rather stay in by myself and read or watch a movie. Is that being selfish? Or sometimes, I simply cannot attend the events my friends participate in because I have a class or have to work late. That isn't selfish, is it? My compadres seem to think it is. I am one of those people who when I commit to something, I give 100% of myself. And if I can't give 100%, I feel like I am letting people down (be it at work, in my classes, in my friendships, and in my relationships). Phrases I've been hearing a lot recently..."Sarah, WHY are you so busy?" or "WHAT is it that you DO all the time?" I find this really frustrating particularly because these questions are usually asked rudely and begging for some sort of sarcastic reply. "Well, actually, my part time job at the Penthouse Club seems to keep me fully occupied on weeknights so unfortunately I won't be able to help you out with your relationship trauma tonight". And then I hear, "Sarah, you are SO SELFISH!" And in case you are wondering, I work full time, take extra curricular classes, am involved in various arts organizations around the City, and try and balance some semblence of a social life while trying to be a good mommy to my lhasa apso. Anyway, it really hurts my feelings to be called 'selfish'. Maybe I don't always put other people's needs first, but I try my damndest to be a great friend. And I am greatful to those in my life who do, in fact, consider me a loyal and caring friend.  Should I blog about what  urlLink Caren  and  urlLink Valerie  I are doing on Saturday night? Should I? Should I? Or should I keep you in suspense and let you know the details after the fact? Maybe I'll keep you dangling. For selfish purposes of course.

      Considering that Bush has declared tomorrow a holiday, it was interesting to return to the leopard carpeted Studio 54 last night to watch a musical about presidential assassination. The show was already delayed once (after 9/11) due to it’s sensitive subject material and I wonder if it is still too soon for Broadway audiences to listen to presidential assassinators (some successful and some not) sing a ballad called ‘Another National Anthem’ as they are the ones who “can’t get into the ballpark”.  The show is not controversial in any way, but America is facing perilous times. Then again, when is it not? That being said, I did like the production. The fact that I love Sondheim’s show goes without saying. The set design was great – a scaffold-like contraption that looked as though it could break at any minute,  Much like the perishability of American ideals. Unfortunately,  as much as I like the music and the book, I felt the direction was lacking…well…passion. And that disappointed me.  Some of the actors were great and some were just plain misguided in their roles. Or seemed to lack the drive needed for the audience to understand their character. So I give this production 2.5 out of 4 stars.  After the show I went to a going away celebration for my friend Leanne who is returning to England today after spending a year here in NYC. She has helped me with my British accent (though I sound Australian no matter what I do). I am planning on visiting her in the fall. I'm sure the Jade Emporer will miss all the times she played with his peaches. She is a fabulous educator and a great friend. I miss you already, Leanne!! Have a safe flight!  In his comments section,  urlLink The Anonymous Blogger  mentions an improv game where one person says a word and his/her partner says another word to create a story. This is a game I play with my students in classes at CMOM. In my acting classes I used to do an excercise where my partner and I told a story together, *at the same time*, completely improvised. Now that was a great deal more difficult. However, my friend and former senior year Vassar housemate  urlLink Bradford Louryk  perfected the art of the excercise. We told amazing joint tales about fascinating people doing prison dances down on their knees. There wasn't a dry seat in the house. I think living together can greatly help with that excercise.

      My team came in 5th last night at Trivia. Eventhough my parents took me to opera after big juicy opera as a kid, I could only name a few of the composers during the audio round. Sorry mom and dad...hope those tickets didn't go wasted on young Sarah! One of the questions last night -- 'Who was the horse who beat Smarty Jones?' My team simply did not know. So we came up with an answer of our own. 'Farty Pants'. Smarty Jones' stinky brother! Chalk it up to a long day but this answer made me laugh so hard that I had tears in my eyes. And it also prompted  urlLink Caren's  team to throw a paper airplane at my head. Which only made me laugh harder. Farty Pants inspired me to create artwork.   The rest of the collection will be on exhibit at the Whittney next month. And here is a picture of me in my Kate Spade jacket a la the South Park character of me created by  urlLink Sydney     Do I go to Trivia next week or do I go to a reading? South Park Sydney vs. South Park Caren. Not sure what I'm going to do. If I go to Trivia I'm tempted to create a one person team called 'Farty Pants'. If I go to the reading I can eat some beans before hand and well... (I'm only kidding). Seriously. My Tuesday night plans are yet to be determined.  I'm seeing 'Assassins' tonight.  It seems the key to getting people to comment on my blog is to write about dating. I didn't do that today so I can expect about 2 comments, if that. Perhaps I should start opening up about my personal life. This is an 'entertainment spot' after all.

       urlLink The Blogette  brought up an interesting question. If you go on a date with a guy and he e-mails you a few days later to say he had a good time but makes no implications of scheduling a second date, do you pursue it further? Personally, I don't. And Bob can disagree all he wants. Yes, I have been known to ask guys out. Never formally, as in through e-mail or over the phone, but I have suggested at parties that we 'have dinner some time'. I think that counts. Now if I recieve an e-mail where a second date is not suggested, I don't pursue it. My dating values are still very 19th century (no wonder I get cholera and tuberculosis) and I find myself in the Jane Eyre/Rochester situation -- be yourself, don't pursue, let the guy pursue you. I know it's old fashioned, and may not be the solution if you are a girl who is desperately seeking immediate romance. But it works for me. I am not looking to date just anyone. I have high standards and chivalry is important to me. I like it when guys open doors for me, help me with my coat, etc. And guys who were raised with this value also tend to call or e-mail a girl for a second date if they are interested. If I don't hear from a guy in a couple of weeks, I take it to mean he is not interested. Even a simple cell phone message or a 'how is your day' e-mail keeps me smiling. One could argue that I should be doing these things in return if I am interested. I would and do, but never first. I respond to e-mails and phone calls but never make the initial ones. Basically, I think I have to agree with the 'Sex and the City' Girls on this question. I'm not shy in the least. I just am rather old fashioned when it comes to dating. Also, I have been in relationships for so long that this is my first time being single in New York. We'll see how it works out. We all have our different ideas about dating.  See you at Trivia tonight!

      So that 'big desicion' I referred to a few days ago...yeah. I made it today. I went with my gut instinct. As I knew I would. I weighed the pros and cons but mostly I just went with what I 'felt'. I haven't slept much so I'll give you more details later. But I made a choice and I think I feel good about it. Anyway, it's too late now. The desicion refers to my professional life. Nothing to get too excited about, folks! I'm not absconding from New York and fleeing to Tibet. On the contrary, I am remaining at CMOM, which is where I belong and where I am happy.  Today was my last class in the Bronx and I cried all the way home on the A train as I read the 'goodbye' cards my students wrote me. They were so beautiful. Many of my kids speak English as a second language (if at all) and their sentence structure was amazingly well done. And these were only cards! I can't believe how much they have grown and matured in only one semester. Two kids used 'alliteration' in their notes. 'Miss Sarah is a Super Splendid Special Teacher! Thanks for teaching us about books!'  Today is one of those days I feel blessed to be a teacher. When Jose eagerly showed me the copy of 'Cat In the Hat' that he bought with the money his uncle gave him for his 7th birthday and asked me to sign it for him because I am 'his favoritist reading teacher' I sobbed all over again.

      A quick recap of the Tony Awards. Some people dressed up. Some people took limos to Radio City. Some people won some awards. And some people like myself are sick of theater. Okay, not all theater. That's a lie. I'm still fascinated that Puff Daddy is on Broadway. And I was pleased as punch that Audra McDonald won. And Idina Menzel is married to Taye Diggs and he is hot. And Nicole Kidman is a goddess. But well, I'm sort of tired of big splashy dance montages. I'm very happy that Avenue Q won. That was an excellent show. I encourage everyone to see it if you haven't already. But I think we can all do without yet another revival of 'Fiddler on the Roof'. It's time for that sun to set.   Here is a picture of my cousin.    And here is a picture of me and Audra McDonald    I have more to blog about but my computer is running out of battery charge and I have to get some sleep. Zzzzzzzzzzzz.

      Sometimes a girl feels like seeing a natural disaster movie. After stuffing ourselves at an Italian restaurant, my friend and I went to see a very late showing of 'The Day After Tomorrow', or alternately, the Day After I Decided to Shoot Myself In the Face For Seeing A Natural Disater Film. I remember now why I usually don't like these types of films. Let me tell you, this ain't no 'Ice Storm'. Although Elijah Wood would have been a much more fitting casting choice than Jake Gyllanhaal. Global Warming strikes and oddly enough it has led to a cooling trend. Quick Americans! Flee South! Get your asses to Mexico! Ice storms are a comin'! The main characters cannot flee, of course. The 'son' (Gylanhaal) needs to stay in Manhattan to first woo his teenage sweetheart and then save her life. The 'dad' (Dennis Quaid) must walk in snow shoes from Washington DC to save him. And the 'mom' (Sela Ward) must stay in a hospital because she is an oncologist and has to read Peter Pan to a young chemotherapy patient (don't ask). Jake and his friends find safety in the New York Public Library and guess how they keep warm? That's right! They burn books! Isn't that a great message? And to complicate things, the wolves escape from the Central Park Zoo and give them a chase. Oh, and Jake and his sweetie both get a rare blood infection from wounds they have recieved and need to find penacillin. But no cows fly across the screen a la 'Twister'.  RIP Ronald Reagan. Team names will follow this Tuesday.   Tony Awards tonight. Do I care who wins? No. Have I seen the shows? Some. Am I excited? No.

        Todd Barry is a funny man. And this picture captures his droll and laid back attitude quite well. For me, he certainly was the highlight of the benefit for  urlLink 826NYC , hosted by Sarah Vowell, with  urlLink They Might Be Giants  and  urlLink David Cross  at  urlLink Southpaw  in Brooklyn. Just for Todd, I am writing jewforever. Yes. All one word. jewforever. do a google search, Todd. Find my website. jewforever. Not two forever. Unless 'two forever' refers to us, Todd. You and me, Todd. Two jews. Together forever. I'm all yours, babe. (Note, I am saying this in Todd's monotone comic delivery). And Todd, hey man, check out the picture below. A watermelon yarmelke. For a head, or a picnic table? Mmmmm...tasty watermelon.    I went to the benefit with  urlLink Sydney  and it was nice to have a Tuesday Night Trivia reunion of sorts. Funny to see such a turn out of trivia folks in Brooklyn on a Friday.

      Nothing like a good Bush joke to start out the day  There's a teacher in a small Texas town. She asks her class how many of them are Bush fans. Not really knowing what a Bush fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher, all the kids raise their hands except one boy--Johnny. The teacher asks Johnny why he has decided to be different. Johnny says, "I'm not a Bush fan." The teacher says, "Why aren't you a Bush fan?" Johnny says, "I'm a John F. Kerry fan." The teacher asks why he's a Kerry fan. The boy says, "Well, my mom's a Kerry fan, and my Dad's a Kerry fan, so I'm a Kerry fan!" The teacher is kind of angry, because this is Texas, so she says, "What if you're Mom was a moron, and you're dad was an idiot, what would that make you?" Johnny says, "That would make me a Bush fan."   My cousin's plane arrived at Kennedy at 12:30am. She got to my apartment at 1:30am.I was already   I woke up when she arrived and showed her around my tiny apartment. She is now sleeping while Zoey sniffs her curiously.  I'm going to a benefit concert tonight in Brooklyn featuring They Might Be Giants and comedian David Cross. I'm bringing my digital camera and I promise to take pictures of things other than myself.

        Me and Zoey (aka My Life Partner)  I ate a lobster dinner last night and it was scrumptious. Mmmmm...lobster. I still have the leftovers in my fridge.  My cousin is coming in to town from LA tonight and is staying with me through Monday. I'm very glad she is a dog lover. Zoey will be thrilled to have the company.   Over the weekend I saw Frankie from the San Diego Real World at an Indian Restaurant. I was surprised by how attractive she is. I also decided that eating curry late at night is not wise.  A male friend asked me if I am getting married anytime soon. I told him that at this point I'll probably settle down with my lhasa apso. Is that legal yet in Massachusetts?

      Take the quiz:  urlLink "Which type of pie are you?"     Cherry Pie  Woohoo! You are CHERRY PIE!!! You are fun and exciting; you are the life of the party! Popular in your own way, your influence motivates everyone around you. You are a party animal and you have oodles of fun in all of your endeavors. Yay for you!  I posted this morning about change. I have been feeling changes very subtley...in the weather, in the museum exhibits, in the way the kids are behaving in class, renewing my lease...but something rather major cropped up today. Perhaps my morning post was a signal that I have a sixth sense for these big descions regarding change. Today I find myself faced with a choice. Its interesting. In my life, I always find that things happen for a reason. I don't regret any of the desicions I have made so far. I am not one who 'obsesses' over choices or even calls multiple people to ask for opinions and advice. I relax, think for a couple of days, and then go with my gut instinct. Things have always come relatively easily for me in terms of making descions. This is not to say that my life has been all sunshine and rainbows, because it hasn't, but if I make a desicion that I am meant to do something, or if I want something badly enough, I usually get it through the power of positive thinking rather than my actions. We all know I have a lazy streak. I realize this probably makes no sense but I promise to keep you 'posted' (pardon the pun) once I settle on a desicion.

        Major changes are in the air. The school year is coming to a close and the kids are firecrackers waiting to go off the minute class lets out. They are a jumble of summer energy and excitement which makes a teacher's job even harder. One of our major exhibits is changing -- and coming July 1st is a fabulous interactive world of Dr. Seuss. As excited as I am for Suess, I hate watching the current exhibit being ripped out. I had a particular fondess for the work of William Wegman.  It's such a beautiful morning. Very hard to believe that another storm is in the forcast for tonight.

      "Onct I see a princess...she was pink all over-gownd an' cloak an' flowers an' all." A Little Princess Frances Hodgson Burnett  THINK PINK! I changed my template. Yesterday I killed Blogger. I required the aide of a friend to help me fix the template and I chose this new pink shade. It's actually more suited to my personality. It reminds me of the 1957 movie 'Funny Face' which stars Audrey Hepburn, Fred Astaire, and Paris. Funny Face is a delightful dance and music movie with pure charm. It is also the ultimate fashion movie, and a wonderful account of the fashion magazine zeitgeist. Hepburn stars as a gamine Greenwich Villager working in a dusty bookshop studying the newest Sartre-like philosophy called "empathasism." She is discovered by Astaire, who is the great intrepid fashion photographer of the moment (utterly based on Richard Avedon, who consulted on the picture). With Givenchy clothes for Audrey Hepburn, the rest of the cast costumed by Edith Head, Gershwin tunes, cameos by the super-models of the day (like Suzy Parker and Dovima), wit, elegance, romance and sheer fun, Funny Face is a joy to watch.  My favorite scene is at the beginning of the movie. The formidable lady editor of THE fashion magazine, Quality, Mrs. Prescott (played by the great Kay Thompson – don’t forget, not only a singer and actress, Thompson wrote all the beloved Eloise books!), arrives at the office and declares the upcoming issue is dead as a doornail, dull. Mrs. Prescott is barely disguised as the ultimate fashion editrix of all times, Diana Vreeland. Notorious for her sweeping statements and bon mots, the number Thompson sings in this scene, Think Pink, is pure Vreeland. She decides, upon glancing down at her desk at a swatch of peppermint pink cloth, that every woman in the United States is to think and wear pink. "Banish black," she sings, "Down to the kitchen sink. Think Pink!" The song and dance number is great, with bolts of pink cloth rolling and rippling into the camera, and Mrs. Prescott’s 6 crisp, efficient, and perfectly coifed young lady-like assistants fluttering about. It’s the best send up of the whims of fashion dictums to date. At the end of the scene, her art director, who is rather shocked by this whole pink craze, says to Mrs. Prescott (who is dressed in elegant, matron dove gray), "But Madam, what about you?" "Me?" she says, "I wouldn’t be caught dead in it!"  Busy week again. My cousin from LA is coming to stay with me from Thursday through Sunday.  A response to  urlLink The Blogette  regarding her Saturday's post. I completely respect anonymity. One blog I particularly enjoy reading is  urlLink Indigo Blues . She is anonymous (I believe so friends, family and co-workers don't discover the blog) and her writings are amazingly honest and heartfelt.

      'They Might Be Giants' was awesome!. I paid a suggested $3 to get in, but was semi angered when I realized I had to pay $2 for a can of Diet Rite. Isn't that, like, 25 cents in supermarkets?? The weather was glorious and it was relaxing to picnic on the lawn and listen to some good music.    CELEBRATE BROOKLYN!!   urlLink Caren  and I arrived very early and waited in line (we set up our picnic blanket in the line while we waited and chatted with another Sarah from trivia). We were soon greeted by  urlLink Daryl  who came in a straw hat bearing a pie. His friend Annie brought cupcakes from the Magnolia bakery!        Due to the heat and humidity I was having both a bad hair AND a bad skin day!    Claire joined us.     urlLink Phil , 'Daisy', and  urlLink The Anonymous Blogger's  subsitute rounded out our group nicely. Note, 'Daisy' and TAB's Subsitute are not featured in the photo.      urlLink Sydney  sat right in front of us and I admired her big hands as we pumped our fists to my favorite Robot song! She is so the one!     Today is Saturday!! Yay! The weekend continues. And now to return those calls and e-mails...  Zoey says 'woof'!

It's my second time seeing them this year. My friends and I are having a picnic. We'll 'copasquat', as Julia Roberts says to Richard Gere. And yes, I'll be armed and ready with my digital camera.  And the weekend is here!! Time to see movies! Napoleon Dynamite has been calling my name. And I HAVE to see what happens when Harold and Kumar go to White Castle.  Plus, sitting in my apartment are 'City of God' and Bertolucci's 'The Dreamers'. Movies galore.  Don't forget.  urlLink Caren  and I are hosting trivia this Tuesday (August 3rd). I don't have the fabulous graphic design skills of  urlLink Sydney  so I can't make a neat South Park logo but you should all come anyway. It will be my first time cohosting.   Happy, happy FRIDAY!!!

      Well, well, Miss  urlLink Claire ! Think you can start a blog and not tell your friend of 24 years about it? (even it is only a test?) Keep blogging! Post more! It becomes addictive...you'll see. In a few weeks you'll find yourself leaving the topic of Gellhorn and discussing our adventures at sea on The Wacky Jacky. Or The Japanese Mafia Man at the restaurant in London (remember how I thought we should leave him a big tip eventhough our food came 4 hours after we ordered...DON'T mess with the mob!). Or you could write the Marie Antoinette lobster story and have me laughing for hours!  See you tonight and welcome to blogging!

      Today is my last day of teaching July session classes but I can hardly get sentimental because August session classes start on Monday. In August I'll be teaching Dramarama again, H2O (the class about the properties of water) and a class called Kooky Creations, which introduces students to concepts of art such as line, color, form, shape, etc. We about modern artists. I am also starting my early childhood classes (yay! babies and mommies!) on Wednesdays. I am going to be very busy. I am not going to San Francisco as orginally planned but I do have two weeks for the Jewish Holidays in September (the Museum is closed and there is professional training seminars). I will not be going to all of the trainings so I may take a local vacation. What am I saying. I just got back from the Bahamas. I can't complain.  I'm sure I'll see a lot of you in Prospect Park tomorrow night at 'They Might Be Giants'! I'm very excited.

      Thanks to  urlLink Gen X'er , some Wild Things came home with me last night. For 6 hours I was their Queen. They are coming to work with me today because I think there are some positions available for them in the Literary Department at the Museum. They are such handsome creatures.  Congrats to my friend Catherine Parker on her recent engagement!

      I love this thunderstorm outside! I enjoy storms when I am in the comfort of my apartment.  The difference between blogging and keeping a personal journal is that I know people will be reading this, therefore if I do what I would normally do in a journal and jot down a list of notes about the funny things that happened to me today, people I don't even know would read it and think I am crazy. Well, I probably am crazy. But people I DO know will read it and think I am crazier than they already think I am. I had a lot of laughs today.  Things that were funny: Me telling Mike D. a semi leud story not realizing I was holding a jar of vaseline (which we used for a science project today...REALLY!), Edward and number 2, "I don't know what 'riot' means but I know what 'diet' means", drawing pictures with Eric, and BIG HANDS, urlLink Sydney !!!   We came in 2nd at Trivia. Mike did a sing along.  urlLink Caren  plays a mean tambourine!

      My response to  urlLink The Anonymous Blogette  and other thoughts on dating...  I can only date guys who have a college education. This may sound snobby but it is an absolute requirement. I have been on dates with guys who graduated from 'The School of Life' and no matter how attracted I was to them physically or emotionally, the education thing always got in the way. Usually, the guy thought that my referring to Vassar, Juilliard, and NYU was 'elitest' when in fact I was just telling stories about my life. I also find that spending 4 years at college is a shared experience that is important for me to have in a mate. It is often where people meet their core group of friends, begin to discover their interests, etc. Bottom line...I will not compromise on this issue.  A more sticky situation...guys who live with their parents and are 26 or older. Yes, I understand why someone would find himself in this predicament. If I date a guy and he complains about being in said predicament, I am hesitant but I can understand. I have dated guys who live with their parents and have no qualms with it nor think it's weird nor have plans to move out anytime soon. Usually, I prefer dating guys who live on their own, away from the parental units, do not sit down to family dinners, pay their own cable and electric bills, and pay for laundry. This is not a rule set in stone. Perhaps I'll be swept off my feet by a wonderful guy who lives with the 'rents. If it happens, I'll let you know. But in the past, it has never worked out for me. I like a sense of independence in a guy.  Though I have a tatoo I prefer no body art on men. Ditto for piercings.   urlLink Sydney  mentions cleanliness. Yup. Very important. MUST smell nice. Clean laundry is important and daily showers go without saying.  She also mentions pets. All of my ex's have treated Zoey with the utmost love and respect. I have never dated a non animal lover. This could be a possible deal breaker. Zoey is my baby and any man in my life should know to treat her as such if he is to have staying power. I don't know. Zoey is very lovable. I've never been faced with this dilemna.  As for physical appearence...those who know my ex's know my type. I'd rather not put it writing. But yeah...there is a look. I tend to be attracted to guys who are fair (blue/green eyes, etc).  Zoey has some deal breakers too when it comes to men I date. I'll let her post that at a later date.  Dating. *Sigh*

      Yesterday was a rough day. It was hard to be back at work after being gone for a week. I'm redoing my August schedule in order to stay in the City and I am postponing a trip to San Francisco. August is going to be a very busy month at the museum.  I went from a hectic day at work to my writing class which was particularly emotional last night. When I got home, I was exhausted and emotional. I was greeted by a sleu of e-mails saying things "Poor baby...sucks to be you...no sympathy for the girl who just got back from the Bahamas". Okay. The joke is old. Yes, I just had a fabulous vacation but that doesn't make my day yesterday any more or less complicated and defeating than yours. So let it go already. I guess I just needed to hear something encouraging.   Anyway, today is a new day. And tonight is trivia! See you guys there.  Better Things  Ray Davies   Here's wishing you the bluest sky And hoping something better comes tomorrow Hoping all the verses rhyme, And the very best of choruses to Follow all the doubt and sadness I know that better things are on their way.  Here's hoping that the days ahead Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you Be an optimist instead, And somehow happiness will find you. Forget what happened yesterday, I know that better things are on their way.  It's really good to see you rocking out And having fun, Living like you've just begun. Accept your life and what it brings, I hope tomorrow you find better things. I know tomorrow you'll find better things.  Are You Out There? Dar Williams  Perhaps I am a miscreation No one knows the truth, there is no future here And you're the DJ speaks to my insomnia And laughs at all I have to fear Laughs at all I have to fear You always play the madmen poets Vinyl vision grungy bands You never know who's still awake You never know who understands and  Are you out there, can you hear this? Jimmy Olson, Johnny Memphis, I was out here listening all the time And though the static walls surround me You were out there and you found me I was out here listening all the time  Last night we drank in parking lots And why do we drink? I guess we do it 'cause And when I turned your station on  You sounded more familiar than that party was You more familiar than that party It's the first time I stayed up all night It's getting light, I hear the birds I'm driving home on empty streets I think I put my shirt on backwards  Are you out there, can you hear this  Jimmy Olson, Johnny Memphis I was out here listening all the time And though the static walls surround me  You were out there and you found me I was out here listening all the time  And what's the future, who will choose it? Politics of love and music Underdogs who turn the tables Indie versus major labels There's so much to see through Like our parents do more drugs than we do Oh...  Corporate parents, corporate towns I know every TV set that has them lit They preach that I should save the world  They pray that I won't do a better job of it Pray that I won't do a better job So tonight I turned your station on just so I'd be understood Instead another voice said I was just too late And just no good...  Calling Olson, calling Memphis I am calling, can you hear this? I was out here listening all the time And I will write this down and then I will not be alone again, yeah I was out here listening Oh yeah, I was out here listening Oh yeah, I am out here listening all the time

      Ugh. It's Monday. And I seem to have either flesh eating virus or lepresy. My forehead got sunburned in the Bahamas and it is now peeling and I look like a freak. Looking like a freak makes me feel sick which leads me to believe I may have contracted malaria from some tropical mosquito.   Back to work, life, and reality. It's harsh. I was happily dosing off on the flight from Atlanta to NYC when I was awaken by a flight attendent screaming "IS THERE A DOCTOR ON BOARD???!!!" (and no, she was not referring to my made up conditions!). A woman three rows ahead of me fainted. It was scary. Apparently she was in diabetic shock. There were 4 doctors on board. None of them looked like George Clooney, Noah Wyle, Anthony Edwards, or Eric La Salle.  I had a nice Sunday. I went to a friend's BBQ where I ate a hot dog. Mmmmmm. Yummy hot dog...   It was nice to see my friends again after a week away and be outside on a terrace on the Upper West Side.  There are some funny signs in the Bahamas. For example, we never did find out what went on in the 'it room'    Maybe you have to pray to get in.    This store had some 'reli' cool things at great prices!    Better keep this parking space clear    I'll let you guys discuss this sign    Happy Monday

      I am now back in my apartment in NYC cuddling with Zoey who I missed very much. It's pathetic, but I also missed blogging. I used to keep an avid journal which has been replaced now by this new cyber writing technology. I would have jotted down some notes while on my trip, but I was...well...busy. Busy relaxing and having fun. Which I really needed.  I have to take a moment to say that sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and I still see a small child. I am convinced my friends and I are 16 and not 26. Here is a picture of Michelle, me, and Erin when we were teenagers   and here we are now   and a picture which shows we are certainly not young girls who use floaties to swim in the deep end.   Yet I still see myself as the 7 year old who never learned to dive yet thought she was a mermaid princess. I remember practicing handstands and backflips in the pool for hours.    Okay, enough being sentimental. The Bahamas was amazing. I swam with dolphins which was so exciting.     The resort was gorgeous.           I went parasailing!!     And on a crazy banana boat ride     The sunsets were beautiful   And our evenings were lots of fun!       Some guys should not wear speedos.    Some quotes from the trip... "Oops...I fell" "Ouch" "I need it" "See ya in about a half an hour" "I'm going to pee in my pants...wait, I'm not wearing pants" (pants said as pahnts in a British accent) "Group schmoop, bring on the air conditioner" "I'm going to take a picture of myself in an unsuspecting moment" "If he doesn't hurry soon I'm going to have no clothes on" (in regards to chef Volunder S. Volundarson)  Okay, I'm exhausted. I'll post more pictures as the week progresses. But now I must get some sleep. Tonight I will be lulled by the sounds of sirens and traffic and not the waves.

       This is our last day here on Grand Bahama so I thought I would write a quick blog entry. We are having a blast. I don't want to leave this beautiful island.   We have been parasailing, jetskiing, banana boating, on the waterslides, swimming with dolphins, sunbathing, drinking mucho pina coladas and miami vices (don't even know what's in them), and meeting lots of cool people.   I'll post photos when I get back tomorrow night.    &nbsp;  Hope all is well in NYC. Miss you all!    &nbsp;  Sarah (aka Bahama Mama)

      This is my last post before I wake up in a few hours (if we go to bed at all) and fly from La Guardia to Atlanta and then switch to a teeny tiny airplane to fly to Freeport on the Island of Grand Bahama. I have a major fear of flying (no surprises there for anyone who knows me and my control issues). I'm all equipped with Xanax and Clonipan (thank you Dr. Kron).  I have to admit I enjoyed 'Cinderella Story'. I'm a complete sucker for a modernized fairy tale and of course this version adds it's own politcally twist. The handsome football player gets to know the clumsy diner girl via IM and text messages and doesn't like her solely based on the fact that she is Hilary Duff. Go figure. And the moral? Be yourself. Don't conform to social pressures, parental pressures, etc. Dare to dream and fantasies can come true. Sound hokey? Well, Jennifer Coolidge has some zingy one liners involving fish and botox that come from nowhere. She cracks me up.  What do girls do after they have gossiped about boys, sex, and relationships? They eat. And after that? They dress up in crazy outfits. I had a great time in Astoria tonight with Krute and  urlLink Sydney . I was going for the Scarlett Johanssen in Lost In Translation look.   Syd and I were very color coordinated.   Krute went for the 80's look    I'll be checking e-mail when I'm away and I may post a blog entry or two. Have a great week.

      Things have been good so far. We're working together...building together. Measuring diet coke and aluminum cans. My life is one big museum art project. And my vocabulary has been reduced to that of a guest speaker at a museum educator's seminar. Which I learned today I will be attending the last 2 weeks of September.  So this will be one of my last posts before my trip. While I am not working tomorrow, I have a zillion things to do such as laundry, packing, picking up some extra items, a quick meeting at the Museum to make sure I have everything covered, etc.  I am going to a screening tomorrow evening for Cinderalla Story. Laugh at me all you want but I am very excited. I love Jennifer Coolidge and well, I am in the mood for a fluffy preteen flick. A mutual friend of mine and  urlLink Ms. Sydney  is in town so I may actually venture out of my borough and live it up in Astoria.   I'll post again before I leave. If you e-mail me your address I'll send you a tropical postcard!

        Today is most definitely a 'glasses day' seeing as how my eyes were too tired to keep contacts in. I'm not quite sure if I look mysteriously intelligent, or like an overly tired dork.  Are any of you guys looking for prescriptions for Phentermine   Vicodin   Xanax   Cialis  Levitra  Viagra Soft Tabs   Viagra   Lipitor   Zocor   or Propecia? Because according to the millions of e-mails in my AOL junk folder "You ssaqve BIG mponeyy atnd getfast delivery!" Looks like I can get you some bargains.  I went to bed last night at 10pm. That was nice. I fell asleep watching 'Pirates of the Carribean' and had pleasant dreams of Johnny Depp as a drunken pirate. In my dream I was at some carnival with him. It was like an R rated Disneyland. I'd blog more about this dream but it's not my style. I'll save that for Brandi's site. If you don't know who Brandi is, it's your loss. Or maybe not.  I still have so much to do in the next 2 days.

      Work is really getting to me this week. I am desperately scrambling to do a million things in preperation for my vacation next week and I have such a small amount of prep time. I need a break so badly but preparing to go away is piling stress upon more stress. By Friday I should be relaxed and calm and ready for some fun in the sun.  Yesterday in my Budding Bookmakers class I did a unit on Africa and Anansi The Spider. We made Adinkra stamps and one student became over zealous in his stamping glory and came at me with his art. After much scrubbing, I still look like I made a trip to an African tatoo parlor. I have ink stains on my ankles where I was marred by stamping Edward in his artistic enthusiam.  The Prince Concert was truly amazing. I was so thrilled to see him live. Such a great mix of old and new stuff. I'd blog more about it if I wasn't doing internet searches for my next week's Dramarama classes which I won't be teaching. Ah well, the kids can do without Ms. Sarah for a week.  I am also beginning to feel sad about being apart from Zoey for a week. She is staying with my friend Nancy and her pug Willie Bean and then my friend Fay and her poodle Munchkin. Zoey is going to have a great time with her friends. But I have never been without her for more than a weekend and I am going to miss her so much. Tonight I am going to spend some quality time with her. Am I too obsessed with my dog? Am I too anal about my job? Do I need to loosen up? What is wrong with me?  I'm going to the Bahamas on Saturday. Shouldn't I be relaxed and not stressed???

      I have a 7 year old student in one of my classes who practices Kabbalah because Madonna and Britney do it. And who says kids aren't interested in religion? I was introducing sound waves and I hit a pitch fork. Apparently, this inspired little Ariel to meditate and then chant rather than concentrate on the physics of sound.  Yesterday was such a typical Monday that I am not even going to write about it. I am going to direct you to  urlLink Sydney's Site  where you can read all about What A Girl Wants.  I'm going to see Prince tonight at Madison Square Garden which makes me very happy! I'll blog all about that tomorrow.

      All I have to say is sometimes a girl really wants a Diet Coke even though the timing may seem comical or inopportune. Also..."I just wanted to see how much there was!!"  Matt and I ate a trio of dips (I just love the way that sounds) and some very interesting sushi rolls (some which contained banana and other fruit) at Citrus on the Upper West Side. We sat outdoors and enjoyed the Sunday evening weather while complaining about the upcoming work week. Okay, I can't complain. In one week I'll be on the sandy beaches of Grand Bahama reading trashy novels and working on my tan. Our hotel does have internet access, so nerd that I am, I will be checking my e-mail and will squeeze in a blog posting or two.  This is a very busy week. When is it not a busy week? I've recieved some comments about 'name dropping'. I don't mean for it to be obnoxious but this is my blog dammit and if you don't like it then don't read it. I'm not changing my blog style to suit anybody's preferences but my own.  So is it official yet that Mary-Kate Olsen has a cocaine addiction? Does anyone besides me care? We all know that I love celebrity gossip. I don't even cringe to admit it.  Happy Monday.

        Here is a picture of me and Matt at Sibera on Friday night. No jokes please about how cold it was. And yes, I am smoking. Sorry to disappoint my readers who may have thought otherwise, but I am a smoker. I will take this moment to mention how proud I am of my friend  urlLink Gen X-er  who is in the process of detoxing herself cold turkey from the evils of nicotine. She has my full support and admiration. I actually have tentative plans to quit smoking myself this coming Thanksgiving. The date has some significance to me. Don't ask me why because I won't tell you but it is just as good a time as any. We'll see if I stick to that or not.  Yesterday  urlLink Dave  and I went to see Tom Stoppard's Jumpers on Broadway. Here are the Tom Stoppard plays I have been able to understand: 'Rosencranzt and Guildenstern Are Dead' and 'The Real Thing' and of course the film 'Shakespeare In Love'. Here is what has made me feel out of the pseudo intellectual loop: 'Arcadia' and now 'Jumpers'. I liked the relationship between Dotty and George. Both characters were crying out for help.but are unable to do anything for each other. They have both reached that stage in a marriage when love has turned sour and isolation has set in, and though an ache of mutual tenderness remains, it is not enough to save them. The two actors capture this perfectly. Russell Beale brings a palpable sense of hurt and desperation to the stage as George, sweating copiously in his baggy professorial cardigan, and longing for sexual intimacy withh is wife, even as he struggles with his lecture on the existence - or otherwise - of God. Just the sight of his clumsy hands, as he ineffectually strokes Dotty in a doomed attempt at comfort, brings a lump to the throat. As for Beale's lengthy philosophical monologues...well...I felt lost. The audience was laughing and I was clearly left out of the joke. The satire on the absurdities of academic philosophy, and in particular on relativism where lost on me. I think maybe he was suggesting that concepts of good or bad are entirely dependent on one's point of view. As always, Stoppard was trying to cram a lot into a 3 hour show.  Last night I went to a party at  urlLink Sin-E  for  A night of music and readings from  urlLink "Kill Your Idols - A New Generation of Rock Writers Considers the Classics" . Great bands, some readings, and fellow blogger  urlLink Dawn Eden  wrote a chapter but had left before we got there.  And now it is Sunday. This is my last week in NYC until I fly off to Grand Bahama for 7 days in the sun! I am so excited. But that leaves me with a lot to do this week. I am going to the Prince concert at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday!!  Update on members of the Ackerman clan. My Grandmother seems in good spirits, new wheelchair and all. She even told me that she would send me a check for the Prince tickets because she loves me so much. She is expecting a detailed letter with photographs decribing the concert. My father sat next to former SF Giant Darrell Evans at a game over the weekend and they became fast friends. My dad is very pleased by this.

      As I was leaving my apartment to walk Zoey yesterday, I ran into my friendly 30 year old next door neighbor Simeon who took one glance at my pleated short skirt and summer heels and declared I looked like Lolita. Amused by this, I was inspired to photograph pieces of my outfit which I think would either make a great cover for a chick lit novel or would make a wacky summer greeting card.      I met my friend Brad at Union Square and we saw 'Saved!' which I really liked. I could have done without Macaulay Culkin's new and affected 'actor' voice which he seemed to develop while preparing for 'Party Monster'. My quote of the week remains "I am FILLED with Christ's love!!". I was overheard saying this last night all too many times and as a Jewish girl I'm not too worried about going to hell for using the phrase incorrectly. Or for quoting a Mandy Moore character. Then again, I am the girl who went to an Aaron Carter concert. Seriously though, the movie is good. It gets it's message across without being overly sappy or preachy. However, Mary-Louise Parker is an ingenue. She should not be play a mom. *Sigh*. After the movie Brad and I were standing outside the theater and we saw an androgynous person who greatly resembled SNL's Pat! I tried to take a picture. Look closely at the background. Yes thats right. The person crossing the street behind Brad. Look Closer.    My friend J had a birthday/going away party at Ruby Foo's last night. He is off to Australia for 6 weeks. A bunch of us sat at a round table and food was spun around. Lots of food. But with NO MSG. Caren won't eat MSG. No siree. Matthew, however, asked for a heaping serving of MSG on the side. This was never brought to him. We had an interesting-ay onversation-cay about-ay elking-gay in Pig Latin. Yes folks, Gelking remains a hot topic.   After dinner Matthew took Caren and I to a Blogger party at Siberia Bar. I kid you not. A Blogger party. A place where Bloggers get together, wear name tags and socialize. But by the time we got there most of the Bloggers had left. Oh well. I met a Blogger named  urlLink Stephanie  who will be posting pictures of last night's festivities.  Oh  urlLink Anonymous Blogette , the stories I could share about unrequited love! There was a guy I really, really liked in college. We'll call him 'JT'. He was perfect for me. Smart, funny, cute, Jewish...I was smitten. We were in the same social circle, hung out at parties all the time, smooched a few times whenever he was single, but well, my feelings were just never returned. I was always in his 'friend zone' and he liked it that way. He lives in Brooklyn now with his stunningly beautiful girlfriend and my stomach flips still whenever I see him. Friends giving advice about never experiencing this feeling of not having your feelings of l'amore, toujours l'amour returned certainly deserve the 'B' word. I hear ya, sister!  I'm seeing Tom Stoppard's 'Jumpers' today. Happy Weekend!

        The Monkey King exhibit has left CMOM but I was able to abscond with a souvenier! That's right! As I was leaving work the other day I saw oneof our lucite Monkey King pieces sitting in the garbage. It was too sad for words. His plastic was slightly cracked and his staff was broken but I picked him off and off we went into a cab. He now resides with me in my apartment. I love free art. Even if it is semi damaged. I will miss the Monkey King exhibit as I can no longer 'play with the Jade Emporer's peaches'.  Tonight, my friend J and I went to a party for the opening of the Seuss exhibit. We unschlumped a mighty borphin and I am not going to even explain what that entailed. You'll have to visit the museum and find out for yourselves. We also flew hot air balloons with some Sneetches, played with trick photography, dressed in Seuss costumes and admired our insanity in carnival mirrors, walked on a balance beam, rode The Green Eggs and Ham train, sat on a Who (but didn't hatch it), and captured some words on this amazing computerized word wall. Oh yeah, there was also a 'speech' and lots of food.   Al Pacino visited CMOM again yesterday. He walked into my Dramarama class with his kids and asked where they could make Suess hats. I wish he would sign his kids up for my class. I told my kids that eventhough they didn't realize it, they had just met a very famous actor. Then I taught them to say 'HOO-AHH'.  Today in my Gross Biology class we studied digestion and we made poop with oats, cocoa and water. Yup. That's what a girl with a master's degree does -- she creates crap. The class loved it.  I still have not seen Spiderman 2. I hear it's a lot of fun.

      Never underestimate the importance of a diet rich in calcium no matter what your age is. A calcium-rich diet as well as consistent physical activity is essential to building and maintaining strong bones and staving off bone-related disorders such as osteoporosis later in life.  My bones were aching today and I diagnosed myself with early osteoporosis. I drank a frappacino. It was a small start. I conducted an experiment today in my Gross Biology class with 5 and 6 year olds all about calcium depletion. We soaked eggs in vinegar and let them sit overnight. Today, when we checked the results, the eggshells had been completely depleted of all calcium. All that was left was a rubbery shell coating the raw egg which could be bounced on the table. Cool experiment, but scary for hypocrondriacs such as myself. Unfortunately, my 83 year old grandmother's bones are not doing too well. She is in extensive pain and I just found out that my mom is making a trip to Salt Lake City to visit her this weekend. My grandmother has very weak bones and can no longer walk and is being put in a wheelchair. This is not an easy thing for her. She also uses oxygen tanks to help her breath. None of this has stopped my grandmother from being the belle of the ball at The Millcreek Retirement Center, where she is living. As a 'get well' present, my mom is giving her copies of  urlLink Caren Lissner's   urlLink Carrie Pilby  and  urlLink Starting From Square Two . I know my grandmother is going to love them. She likes to read and she enjoyed my last gift which was Sex and the City on DVD. Knowing her, she'll start a Caren Lissner bookclub at the Retirement Center! I love my grandmother and hope she feels better very soon. Making a switch to a wheelchair cannot be easy.

      I am reposting my further comments on kissing that I originally posted in  urlLink The Anonymous Blogger's  comments section. I think it is a good thing for all to read.  Kissing just happens, It isn't something that should be planned. If the feeling is mutual and the setting is right both parties involved will just 'know'. I was referring to kissing style, not uninvited kissing. It can be the right time for a kiss, just not the right time to shove your tongue down someone's throat. I think a kiss should begin softly with light caressing of the lips, some soft stroking of the hair and the face. Eye contact, a shy smile, or a knowing look. Many guys skip this step and assume that when it's time to kiss a girl it's time to open mouth and insert tongue. That is gross. Pre kissing flirtation that gets me going - slight caresses of the hands or back and anything involving my neck or hair or If a guy touches my hands in a sensitive and caring way (particularly a gentle stroking) I am definitely receptive to a kiss if I am feeling attracted to him. But please. Oh please. No tongue shoving. I adore French kissing but there are good kissers and bad kissers and the bad ones really cannot be worked with. However...if you follow these first steps accordingly...you'll have me purring like a kitten... Sarah | Email | Homepage | 07.05.04 - 5:37 pm | #

        A few years ago I was out with Jackie Zeman of ABC's General Hospital, her husband, and some friends and I was complaining about my boyfriend at the time and how we always fought about the small stuff. My ex (who I will refer to henceforce as SB...these are not his initials but some of you may know what this moniker means) and I constantly had full on oscar award winning arguments about the most trivial things -- who's college experience was more competitive, where we would go for dinner, whether or not we agreed upon a movie and who was right. It was all very silly. Often we would argue about more pressing issues - SB was a young republican and Ayn Rand made him as happy as Homer with a beer and a donut. That being said, I asked Jackie how she and her hubby had kept up such an amazing marriage for so many years. She said whenever she or her husband got too dramatic and began to bitch about the small stuff they simply told each other to 'put a cork in the whine' and then they disolved into laughter. I thought this was funny at the time but I now I can see how this is significant...on many levels.  2nd day of summer classes today and more new students. I hope it goes as well as yesterday.   Trivia tonight! Start thinking of good team names. No doubt it will be something about Kerry and Edwards vs Bush and Cheney. Once again I hope to see some of you there!

        It is raining today and my hair isn't behaving as nicely as it was in the 48 hours post haircut. Ah well. The perks of teaching small children is that 5 and 6 year olds think I'm beautiful no matter what my hair looks like.  So here I am, the former child star of 'Romper Room' and the 'Milk - It Does a Body Good' ad campaign, off to teach an enrollment class for young children called 'Dramarama'. I am very excited. You can take the girl out of the entertainment world but you can't take the entertainment out of the girl!  I was pleased to see that  urlLink The Blogette  made a post. And it was a good one! Kissing is very important and it can make or break the dating process very early on. If a guy kisses in the style she describes (and yes, sadly I have experienced this on all too many occasions), I have to end the courtship process unless I have a very strong attraction to the guy and have some confidence that his kissing style can be worked on. Note: this has never been the case. There is nothing like a great kiss.  Happy Monday.

      I have to work today. No 5th of July celebration for me. But I hope the rest of the America is enjoying a lovely day off.  I had a great Independence Day. I met my friend J and his brother for brunch at Route 66 and I had an egg white omlette with grilled chicken which was certainly of super sized portion. I also had a banana wheat germ smoothie made with fat free frozen yogurt which tasted rich and creamy to me.   urlLink Dave  and I cooked up quite a 4th of July meal! (If J posts any comments about a mysterious errand I ran at Whole Foods he is mistaken. I simply needed to pick up ingredients...and spices...and...stuff...yeah...stuff...you know...not prepared stuff)    We had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, potato salad, fruit salad, macaroni and cheese, and strawberry shortcake.   It was very delicious. We watched fireworks from my roof though our view was slightly obscured. We still had a marvelous view of the City and of New Jersey and saw many a fireworks display so I felt festive. I also laughed at a woman who was wearing light up themed Independence Day bracelets and necklaces. We spied on another party taking place across the street and basically the fireworks just keep going. People fire and run. Then the sirens wail and basically I'll probably get no sleep.  I recieved some tragic news this evening. A friend of mine from Vassar, Erin Schlather, was killed in a car crash on Saturday. I worked with Erin on a production of Stephen Sondheim's 'Company' during my junior year. She was a talented singer, full of energy and enthusiam and always had a smile and a hug to give everyone. She will be greatly missed. This is a photo I took of her during rehearsal.

      I realized last night after seeing 'Super Size Me' that I really don't spend much time in the real 'America'. My life has been spent in a bubble. San Francisco, Vassar, and New York City have been environments where I am usually surrounded by people obsessing over what NOT to eat. Mary-Kate Olsen's situation is much more common to me than stomach stapeling surgery.  However, I think Morgan Spurlock had a great idea and set about to prove his point that Mc Donald's is making our nation obese in a very humorous and also very frightening way. He decided to conduct an experiment in which he would subject himself to a diet of nothing but McDonald’s fast food for a month. He only allowed himself to eat what was available over the counter at the restaurant (including water), he couldn’t super size unless asked (he ended up being asked 9 times all told), he had to eat every item on the McDonald’s menu at least once, and he had to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Throughout his descent into the maelstrom of crappy food, he visited doctors and health professionals to track his decline in health. At the beginning of the experiment, Spurlock clocked in at a svelte 6’ 2” tall and 185 pounds. His cholesterol was a healthy 168, his blood pressure 120/80, and his body fat measured 11%. A month later, Spurlock’s weight had shot up to 210 pounds, his cholesterol was 230, and body fat had increased to 18%.  He interviewed advertising executives, cafeteria workers, and children who fall prey to the 'Happy McDonald's Clown' they see on TV. I had nightmares last night about that clown.  Needless to say, neither my friend nor I wanted to eat dinner after the movie. And with several fast food chains within walking distance of the theater we had ample opportunities to Super Size.  I'm getting a haircut today. I'll post photos later. Now Zoey and I will both be stylin'!

      Zoey is all set for the summer heat with her new 'do. She has been prancing around the apartment wagging her tail and spinning in circles. Oh yeah. She knows she's stylin'. And she even had her own personalFrench stylist make a housecall. I, however, was in shock at how LONG the haircut took.    Here she is with her short cut. I like the way Aline styled her ears into a 1920's 'bob' look!  I forgot to mention that on Tuesday night before Trivia I stopped at collector's store and finally found the 'Kill Bill' action figures I had been looking for. I purchased The Bride and Go Go. I think this store is really great. They have all sorts of fascinating collectors toys from various eras. They also sell a wide array of comic books which I have no interest in, but the guys who work there are extremely chatty and helpful and will find you almost anything you need. I simply asked if they had 'Kill Bill Action Figures' and I left with a free bubble tea from the tea place across the street. Perhaps the guys in the store are *that desperate* for business.   Here is a photo I took of the Bloody Bride. I don't want to take the figures out of the packages so it was hard to get a good shot without reflection.  I realized this morning that I could create a weather blog simply by taking photographs daily from my bedroom window. As you can see, this morning it is very hazy. I can barely see the buildings outside. Humidity reigns supreme.    I can't believe I have the day off today. I hardly know what to do with myself. Perhaps I'll go see a movie.

      Today Zoey and I send our deepest condolences to  urlLink Sydney  for the loss of her dear cat Maxine. My beloved cat Kitsa was put to sleep when I was 16 (she had cancer) and I am confident that she will show Maxine around, in whatever beautiful Kitty Heaven they may now be in.  It's July 1st and at long last I am on summer schedule at work! I begin teaching my enrollment classes on Monday. And don't get jealous guys...I have Fridays off!!! (well, some Fridays). I went to a preview for our new Dr. Seuss exhibit yesterday and it's a lot of fun. Seriously. There is a hall of mirrors, a computerized word wall where you can catch letters with your hands and body, a Green Eggs and Ham train, trick photography, and oh so much more! I hope my New York readers will come and check it out.

      I'm having severe problems this week making small and unimportant decisions. I spent practically my entire lunch at Zabars trying to decide which sushi lunch special I wanted, much to the chagrin of the rushed people behind me. It was like I was in some kind of daze. After about 20 minutes, I decided I didn't want sushi after all so I left and went next door to get a frozen yogurt but couldn't decide on a topping so I neglected the yogurt and walked to Felictea where I spent another 20 minutes debating which flavor of bubble tea to order. It was my 10th purchase so it was free. But a simple choice like what to have for lunch should not be so hard.  My friend sent me an invitation to join her network on tickle.com. Lots of new quizzes and other such fun! I'd post one but of course I can't decide which.  What was I talking about?   urlLink See if you can find the difference between these two pictures  It's difficult. Take your time and look closely.

      They say the first time is a little painful but as you get going it starts to feel really good. Yes, I am talking about hosting TRIVIA! Thanks to all who came last night. And I apologize that I didn't know the 9/11 Commission Report was a paperback. When I'm not reading Caldecott Award winners to the kiddies I teach, I am usually reading one level up...teen angst novels. Or 18th/19th Century death bed poetry. But, to a certain Anonymous chap...was it really necessary to throw things at me? I think not. It was my *first* time after all. Thank you Eric for your support and for not being offended that I used a photo of your wife (ex-wife...did ya get that annulment?) for #8 in the visual round. I recieved a 'hilaaaarious' marriage proposal. Always a nice Tuesday night surprise. My favorite team name went to the winners 'Paris is Bruising'. Simply delightful. Caren chose 'Tits and Ass' from Chorus Line as one of the audio selections. Niiiice! I have quite a number choreographed to that little ditty. Perhaps when I host again you'll get to see it.  "I tricked them. People are going to think it's a lhasa but it's really a shih-tzu." -Sarah (said to Caren in snide 'Mean Girls-esque' way)  Princess Diaries 2 opens this weekend. Okay, whatever. So maybe I have 'low standards' when it comes to these teen flicks. But I'll be seeing this one.  Garden State - I hear great things. I'm definitely seeing it this week/weekend  Lorenzo Pisoni is in Shakespeare in The Park. Last weekend! Can't miss that! Claire...where are there people from? Where are these people from? Where are these people from? Are these people from somewhere?

      'Napoleon Dynamite'. What a peculiar movie. I give props to Jared and Jerusha Hess for getting this short expanded into full length feature. What it lacks in plot, it makes up for in character development. Napoleon is almost too brilliantly eccentric to laugh at (though I adored his 'Farty Pants'-like drawings of flatulent unicorns). His older brother, Kip, who chats with women online, his quad racing grandmother, his friend Pedro, and his ex football playing uncle...comical. Not something I will buy on DVD but not a waste of $10 either. I hope I didn't gross  urlLink Sydney  out by eating my pretzles/mustard/ketchup combo. We both drank A LOT of diet coke.  And post cinema we had virgin pina coladas complete with umbrellas! We had to postpone our pedicures. I won't say why. And Zoey's anus will never tell. We both became fascinated with a collection of housewares called Mister Pee (was that it?) sold at a store in my neighborhood.   This is the lamp. They also make some interesting coasters.  In other news, I finished 'The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things' by fellow Vassar girl  urlLink Carolyn Mackler . Winner of the Michael L.Printz Award For Excellence In Young Adult Literature, I highly recommend this book. I love teen books that don't sugar coat anything and Mackler's writing is as honest as one can get while still maintaining a youthful sense of humor. It's about shattered illusions and change, self realization and feeling inferior. I now need to go read her other books.  Happy August. Don't forget to say 'Rabbit' thrice. Or as Mary Ping's mother would say, "It's Bunny Bunny day!"
