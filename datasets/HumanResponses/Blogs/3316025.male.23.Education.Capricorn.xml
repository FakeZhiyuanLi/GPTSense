      Last Sunday, my friends & I went to Planet Hollywood to watch  Misha Omar’s  performance... and I can say that she really pulled some crowd down there... there're even some artistes to give their support to Misha.. among them seen were  Dayang Nurfaizah  (my fav local singer),  Ezlynn, Sheila Majid  (surprised to see her supporting a much younger singer.. I salute that!),  Amy Mastura, Ezad of Exists, Cham & Zaf of VE , TV3 personalities ( Zakiah Anas, Ally Iskandar, Maria Tunku Sabri ), etcetera..  Now, on the show.. simply put… superb !!! Well, I don't normally can give a standing ovation to a local artiste.. but this young lady is just amazing.. although she's quite new in the music industry, she took the stage like a pro.. her choices of songs also goes well with the crowd.. from the evergreen Malay song (Ku Pendam Sebuah Duka), to the English oldies (Nothing's Gonna Change My Love For You), to the infectious newly remixed version of Complicated (Avril) and of course her haunting Bunga-bunga Cinta, she really did her thing.. but the best part is when she did a rendition of her counterparts' songs.. Dayang's, Anuar Zain, Sarah, Ning & Siti.. and she even called Dayang & Ezad to come on stage to sing a duet with her spontaneously..  All in all, I could say that I'm really impressed with her vocal prowess.. she nailed every single song with full emotions and confidence.. she really did a great job.. not everybody have a chance to perform on the prestigious stage of Planet Hollywood.. As a new singer, Misha proved herself as one of the new faces in the music industry with a great talent and a new force to be reckoned with... just watch out for her... hats off to you Misha!

      Last night, me & my friends (teera, aloy, ewea, teefa & dziehan) went to see one of most anticipated play of the year,  LORONG NERAKA , at MTC, KL.. with a tempting title, it sure does pull some crowd.. helmed by three of the most credible theatre activists, erma fatima, ellie suriatie and adlin arman, i can simply say that it's the best play of the year.. i was mesmerized by the entire cast.. the ensemble was just perfect.. from the 'Drug Otai' - yasir (who has been to the so-called 'Festival Dadah New Zealand 1987' - is there even such a thing?!), to the wife who was forced to be a prostitute by her own husband played beautifully by betty benafe, to the 4 transvestites (kajol, milda de vega, sarah) who really got the crowd going wild, all of them cast a perfect spell.. with Lorong Hj Taib as the background, this play revovles around the dark side of KL.. how drugs ruled the street.. how a kid had to struggle the life as a son of a bitch.. etcetera.. eventhough it's hard to believe (more likely we don't want to believe), but we can't deny that what was portrayed in the play is the real thing that happened in the dark streets.. sometimes, i felt really mad to them for destroying our kids.. but at other times, i felt sorry for them.. it's not totally their fault ending up that way.. who wants to live life that way..? hmmm.. i don't really know.. have a little think....  p/s: for theatre lovers, Lorong Neraka is not to be missed..!   urlLink  LORONG NERAKA     'Lorong Neraka disifatkan sebagai sebuah teater yang mengangkat kisah pahit dan sengsara di sekitar Lorong Hj Taib. Berkongsi luahan rasa bersama pengarah muda Ellie Suriaty dan aktivis teater Adlin Arman Rahman, Erma yakin Lorong Neraka bakal memberikan kesan yang mendalam ke atas diri remaja. Membariskan pelakon handalan seperti Ellie Suriaty, Rosnah Mat Aris, Betty Benafe, Nabila Huda dan pengambilan istimewa dua pelakon kanak-kanak iaitu Eric dan Sarah, Lorong Neraka mampu tampil sebagai sebuah karya yang penuh kritikan sosial.'    urlLink "dari isi hati pandangan mata dan rakaman lensa seorang sultanmuzaffar"

      First of all, thanx to 8tv esp Izham for bringing American Idol (AI) to our shores.. as a person who is obesessed with music, singing, and great vocals, i've to admit that this is my favourite show to date.. and my friday night is sure ain't complete without AI.. anyway, the final 4 results show was just aired in the US.. (we're 2 days late).. and i'm definitely outraged when a chat pal of mine from canada told me that one of my favourite contestant, LaToya London was eliminated this week.. this is so INSANE..! i don't know how america voted, but it's clearly not based on talent and the people voting are not using their mind..!! this is totally bullshit..! ooppss.. sorry for that people.. it seems that i'm turning crazy every since Jennifer Hudson was booted out 3 weeks ago..! anyway, bygones...   p/s watch out for me in the malaysian idol..!! hehe  Judd out !

      Wow.. it's been such a long time since i last updated my blog.. initially, i planned to update the Euro 2004 matches daily, but it seems that my schedule was too tight to do so.. actually, i just came back from penang.. so this is my 1st day in office after outstation.. a lot has happened since then.. esp the Euro.. i even missed some important matches due to tiredness.. one match that i missed with much regret is the England - Portugal clash.. actually, i was already prepared to stay up that night.. and i even planned to pack my things up while watching the tv coz the next day i'll be going to penang.. and the last thing i remembered was that it's 2.30 am and i was watching Ball Talk on TV3.. but the next thing that i realised was that it's already 8 o'clock in the morning !! my God !! what happened to England ?? My stuffs were not packed up yet !! My flight is at 11.50 am, and i am scheduled to go to the airport at around 10 o'clock !! And there were still some stuffs not settled yet in the office..!!! warrgghh....!! i tried to calm down, had an expressed bath, packed my things.. and by 8.30, i was in the office.. and 1st things 1st.. the Eng-Port match.. I was so shocked to learn from my colleague that it wasn't England in the semis but the host.. it was such a dissapointment for me.. not only England lost, but i didn't watch it ??!! warrgghh.. but at least Holland makes it to the semi.. now that England was booted out, my total support goes to Holland.. U go Ruud..!! Tear those Portuguese apart !   urlLink  The Quarter-Final Clashes     urlLink Portugal 2-2 (6-5) England  (how can this be???!!)   urlLink France 0-1 Greece  (Haha..!!)   urlLink Sweden 0-0 (4-5) Holland  (u go Holland.. bring that title back!)   urlLink Czech Rep 3-0 Denmark  (the rising of Czech !!)  My prediction for the final will be Holland vs Czech.. and Holland's gonna win hands down with 3-1 !!

      Well, the American Idol season 3 has finally wrapped up.. and without much controversy,   urlLink Fantasia 'The Lips' Barrino   was crowned as the new Idol, edging out the shcoolgirl with an old soul,   urlLink Diana DeGarmo  .. mmmhh.. although i don't quite like Barrino, (compared to DeGarmo), but i've to admit that she's a total professional when it comes to performing.. every single song comes naturally to her, as if she's been doing it for a lifetime.. the same goes with   urlLink LaToya London   and   urlLink Jennifer Hudson   who were voted out earlier in the season.. (which got many people angry, including me!!) .. however, my American Idol has got to be   urlLink Camile Velasco  .. actually, at the beginning of the show, my 1st favourite contestant was the powerhouse vocals of Jennifer Hudson.. but as the show progresses, i fell in love with Velasco.. with her subdued performances and great personality, she really captured my heart.. although she's not the diva type of a singer, and doesn't scream her lungs out to sing, but the unique tone and that husky voice of hers really made me melt.. ooh my dear camile, i'm dying to hear your voice again.. please.. i mean PLEASE put out an album asap so that i can hear your lovely voice everytime i'm craving for you..!! OMG.. i'm going crazy..!   Camile, my Love for you will never fade.. EVER !!

      On Saturday night, i was at Bentong, Pahang attending the so-called Kursus Induksi & Bina Insan.. it was ok la.. nope..! the real thing was the only 'ok' part was the outdoor activities (flying fox, night walk, orienteering, hanging bridge, pool hand ball etc).. and the rest was a big No-no ! especially the long speeches and the test! can u believe it, doing a test in the middle of the jungle which contributes 30% of my work evaluation report (or whatever it is!).. anyway, go to hell with that.. but the only thing that i regret going to bentong is that i missed the AF2 6th concert.. what made me more angry was to learn that Zarina was the 4th student to carry her bag out of AF.. boy, i can hardly believe my ears when one of the committee (who went to see the results at a nearby shop) leaked out the horrible news.. what happened everybody??!! how stupid of those who still wants to keep the less talented Mas and Nurul in the game..! don't u guys have ears to listen! these two students are just out of the league!  Well, whether u like it or not, things do happen.. and there's nothing in this world that can bring Zarina back.. i just regret that she didn't make it to the top 5 along with my other favourites  Farah, Zahid, Linda and Bob .. to say that she's the best contestant is an overstatement, but one cannot deny that she has improved a lot since the 1st concert (along with Zahid).. even Ramli M.S and all the trainers admits it.. everytime she gets onstage, we can feel her charisma that she portrays whenever she performs.. with every performances, she brings colours to the song and making it her own.. a quality that many other contestants lack.. watching the AF diaries, one knows that she's a very committed person.. she works hard to get things right.. remember her learning the words of My Immortal..? and how she's willing so hard to teach Linda sing Bunga Melor..? it's touching to learn that she stayed up late at night and won't go to sleep just to help Linda sing a traditional Malay number.. Zarina, AF will never ever be the same now that you're gone.. not only to those remaining in the academy, but your absence will also be painfully felt by us, the viewers as well..   urlLink  Tribute to Zarina    Zarina... thank you for gracing our TV screens, for bringing laughter and cheer, sadness and tears, joy and pain to our daily lives. There is only one Zarina. We wish you all the very best and continued success in every thing that you choose to do now or in the future!   Smile, and wipe those tears dry. You did your best and have nothing to be ashamed of! We salute you, Zarina! You're the best..!  ....................  To us voters, don't let this happen again.. though i think there will be one more shocking result next week with Bob going.. i don't want this to happen, but it's up to you voters.. i just can't imagine someone like Mas being crowned as the winner.. we're proud Vince emerged as the AF1 champion coz he does have an incredible talent, but would we be proud to have Mas as our champ..? no doubt she has a unique voice, but has she improved one bit since the 1st concert? AF is an academy to teach these students not only to become a great singer, but also a successful performer.. if what we get every week were only forgotten steps and lyrics, then it's a dissappointing sequel to AF1.. it's unfair to blame her, but blame yourself if that's what happen..you decide...   To the 4 students who have left the academy, you guys are already a winner..   urlLink  Seloka Anding   for you guys...  12 budak sekolah jln sebelah menyebelah  Seorang balik rumah, tinggallah 11 11 budak sekolah, tgh pakai kasut Seorang sakit perut, tinggal 10 10 budak skolah lalu tepi skolah sorang tak siap kerja rumah tinggallah 9 9 budak skolah jumpa tokey Ah Lim sorang nak makan asikrim tinggallah 8 org 8 budak skolah lastik burung punai sorang nak mandi sungai, tinggallah 7 7 budak skolah main balas pantun sorang nak tengok katun alahai tinggallah 6 6 budak skolah tunggu tgh panas seorang tertinggal bas, hmmm, 5 org lah semua 5 budak skolah tgh seronok bercuti Seorang masuk JAWI, tinggallah 4 4 budak skolah seronok main gasing seorang terkencing tinggallah 3 org 3 budak skolah tgh susun pasu seorang nak minum susu tinggallah 2 2 budak skolah cari buah langsat seorang kena sengat dah nasib, seoranglah tinggal Seorang budak skolah balik rumah jln kaki tapi dia tak susah hati sebab besok, semuanya bertambah kembali...  p/s: I just finished watching the live telecast of Fara Fauzana's interview with Zarina on the net.. and i nearly burst into tears watching Zarina waving goodbye and thanking her supporters at the end of the show.. you will be missed dearly.. and i'm missing her already......

      Lately there were many international acts coming to town.. among them were  urlLink Linkin Park ,  urlLink Incubus , Gareth Gates,  urlLink Guy Sebastian ,  urlLink Mariah Carey ,  urlLink Black Eyed Peas  and others.. this is something which i found very interesting.. who would've thought big names like linkin park & mariah carey would come to a small country like malaysia.. although there were so many rules & regulations set for these acts to follow, but i admire them for wanting to come to our shore and entertain the people who doesn't normally have a chance to meet an international artiste.. so it's like a dream come true for people like me to watch these stars perform in front of our own eyes.. not in my wildest dreams would i imagine to watch mariah carey in those skimpy outfits singing live in a concert..! thanx to those who managed to bring them here.. a really big effort.. congrates !  Among them, i only managed to catch incubus and mariah's concerts.. man, they were hot dude !! they totally rock the house.. incubus were definitely amazing.. we were head banging all nite long.. and mariah's vocal was superb.. i actually didn't think that she could sing live that good anymore.. since she's been in the industry for quite a while and grown a bit old, so i thought that she may have fade out a bit.. but man, she proved me wrong.. she can totally hit those high notes effortlessly.. all in all, watching these 2 acts perform is worth the money.. totally entertaining..  It's a shame that i couldn't watch linkin park & black eyed peas' concert.. i was at a seminar when LP's concert was held.. but i forgot why i couldn't manage to go to BEP's.. but there was something that doesn't allow me to go.. so pissed off!! anyway, hope there will be more coming to town.. but there's one particular artiste that i wish to meet or watch her perform in a concert.. the sexy  urlLink CHRISTINA AGUILERA  ! just hoping this dream will eventually come true !!

      So, the most anticipated reality show, the Malaysia Idol has kick start in our own country.. just lets hope that it will meet our expectations.. and hopefully it can retain the standard that the other Idols show has proven..   And talking about Malaysian Idol, i actually participated in the last round of the audition at Berjaya Times Square in KL.. it was an exhausting experience.. but it's worth it, although i had to wait for hours to get into the audition room.. and the funny thing was, i actually auditioned twice..! the 1st one was at about 7 pm after waiting since 2.30 pm.. after being dissappointed for the 1st time, a couple of friends who were still waiting to be auditioned outside urged me to try for the 2nd time with them.. since i had nothing to do that day, i decided to give it a go.. so again i had to wait for few hours.. but this time i had to change my outfit a little.. i took out my necklace and jacket, coz i was wearing a sleeveless T-shirt inside.. and luckily the girl who were calling our name didn't recognise me.. haa..! i forgot to mention one thing.. i actually had to steal the audition form from the counter coz the entries for the audition were already closed at 5pm.. and the staffs were too bz to realise i stole the form..! hehe..   At around 11 pm my name was called to the audition room.. my friends & i were actually the last 10 to audition on that last day..! and unluckily for me, i was placed at the same room i auditioned the 1st time around! and when i was about to go in and sing, the person guarding the door recognised me ! i acted as blurr as i can.. but he's confident that i was the same person that auditioned earlier that day.. i thought he was going to usher me out, but he was so nice to swicth me with another guy waiting in the other room.. just great ! hehe.. so when it's time for me to sing, i gave all that i can and screamed my lungs out..!! and just to let u guys know, it was already 12 pm at that time ! and then, we were brought downstairs to the results room.. and as you guessed it, i failed again !! waaa.. in fact all of us failed.. maybe the judges were too tired to listen to us sing..! so that's the end of it.. i didn't even get the chance to sing in front of paul moss, roslan aziz & jee.. but what to do.. i know i can sing, but maybe i don't have the 'it' factor to make it..!   All in all, it was such an unforgettable experience.. i was actually nervous when they were showing the KL audition on TV.. coz there were 3 times when the cameraman came to us.. he even asked me to sing in front of the camera but i refused.. but he won't go unless i sing ! but fortunately, the recording didn't make it to the episode.. if not, i should be as glamour as William Hung by now! hehe..  So, next week will be top 33 show.. hope it can rival what AF 2 gave us this season.. all the best to all particicipants.. especially those who i've met during the 1st round audition.. and hopefully Malaysia can produce a talent with international standard who can compete with Fantasia Barrino in the upcoming World Idol !

      So, my predictions are totally wrong ha..?! You guys must be laughing at me..:P Anyhow, i'm glad it's Greece that won the cup and not Portugal.. (the Portuguese trashed the teams that i support, England & Holland remember..!!??) So, the Euro fever is over now.. along with the great memories.. and funny ones too !! who can forget Beckham's penalty shoot-out!? and what a shock the underdog teams gave us.. hopefully Greece & Czech Rep (just to name a few) will continue to shine and add more spice to the football world.. apart from the fall-out of more experienced teams such as Italy, Germany, France etc.. and to the stars of Euro 04, Rooney, Zagorakis, C. Ronaldo, Baros etc, we hope to see more of these faces in the upcoming tournaments.. all the best!
