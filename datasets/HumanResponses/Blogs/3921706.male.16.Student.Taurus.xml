        Since i've opened a new blog here at   urlLink  blogger.com   , I know I'll update much more often than I did with LJ, even though my life is pretty boring. But my summer, at least the weekends, seem to be pretty full. Nothing planned for tomorrow yet but Sunday, I'm attending a BBQ. Then next Saturday, I'm supposed to go to a friend's graduation party even tho none of my friends, nor I, really want to go. Not because we don't necessarily like the person giving it but because we can smell the boredom from a mile away. Then I'm going to go see I, Robot that Sunday. And then the week after that is our annual congregation picnic and 2 days later, I finally leave for 2 weeks in good ol' Texas!! I don't know why but I'm not excited as one would think. I'm eager to go but the anticipation has died down and I don't think I'll really be antsy until the day before we depart. See? Told you my life was boring but interesting things do happen from time to time.      &nbsp;   Not much else to say except I think the relationship between my mother &amp; I will probably be slightly fractured for the rest of our lives. We just can't seem to see eye-to-eye on much these days and we have our peaceable moments but I don't ever think we'll be the best of friends. Don't get me wrong, I love my mother with ALL my heart &amp; soul and would do anything for her but...I just don't ever see us being as close as a mother and son would/should be. I describe it best as this, she's good to me and bad for me. She's like watermelon seeds. My life is the watermelon. The seeds (my mom) are beneficial because without them, the watermelon (my life) wouldn't exist. At the same time, they're an inconvenience. In order to really enjoy the watermelon, you have to get rid of the seeds. So in order for me to get a full enjoyment out of life, I have to live my life separate from my mother.      &nbsp;  I know I'm not a perfect angel and I've haven't exactly always made my mother proud but I've gotten to a point where I think I'll never make her be as proud of me as she is of my other siblings. She's constantly comparing me to my sisters and brothers and reminding me that they didn't act like I do when they were my age. They set a near-perfect standard for me to live up to and i seem to be constantly failing and at this point don't care. I am not my brothers and sisters, I am me and if my mother can't love me and accept me for me, then that's her problem. Who knows, maybe one day I'll make her extremely proud of me and she'll finally accept me as me but I'm not gonna break my back to do it. I love my mother 150% and always will no matter what she does to me but I realize I have to love her from a distance because the closer&nbsp;I get to her, the more I want to run away. And I'm gonna&nbsp;try to work hard&nbsp;to maintain a harmonious balance between the two of us as long as I'm under her roof. I have to. If I don't and I allow her to continue to get under my skin, one of these days she's gonna push me to the limits and over the edge and I'm gonna exit stage left and never come back. Not saying I'll run away from home or anything but meaning the moment I do leave her household, she will know the next time she sees my face and hears my voice. And I don't wanna have that type of relationship with my mother. She's my hero, my inspiration for life and she's the motivation I have to fight through any adversity in my life. She's been through a LOT of %#!t in her life and dealt with&nbsp;a LOT of things that would have left people in a padded cell sitting in a straightjacket. But through it all, she's never lost the will to live and the will to fight and the will to love. And seeing me express my true feelings about her shows I don't want to have a hairline-fractured relationship with her. I would love it if me and my mother were closer but it will never be a reality because our own imperfections cause us to inevitably butt heads. So&nbsp;I have to accept things as they are and cherish what relationship we do have. I may seem to be a walking contradiction and it may&nbsp;seem as if my love for my mother could easily overpower the negative aspects of our relationship. But the reality of it all is that even if I never make my mother 100% proud, as long as she loves me no matter what and comes to ACCEPT me as I am, then I think we'll be just fine.&nbsp;I guess you could say our relationship is the epitome of "can't live with, can't live without."      &nbsp;    Current Ear-gasm: Brandy -   "I Tried/Should I Go/Come As You Are"

      Well, this is one of my first posts for my new blog and I'm so excited since I love the look of this one vs. LJ and I think I will contribute more regulary to this one. But this post is mainly to inform about how I will post @ Eps from now on. I just got my TR hat but i also lost all my music files from my PC which means I had to start from scratch so I have about an equal abundance (for now) of older CDs and newer CDs. So my plan is to review one newer CD and then one older one and so on and so forth. I'm doing this so I don't review all my new CDs and then be stuck with older cds to review that no one will look at. (Nobody really paid attention to my TWEET review). So just expect that from me from now on. If I review an older CD, stick with me cuz a new one is coming. And to all members that look at this post, go check my Tweet review if u haven't done so. That is all for now.

       Man, I just came home from a party and I had a blast. I had been debating whether or not to go to the party because of some inner drama between friends but at the last minute, I found out there was some miscommunication and I decided that I was not gonna miss out on it. I get there and it's boring at first but once the DJ got there, it popped off!! Now, I'm not the world's greatest dancer by any means and I'm usually shy on the dancefloor but there were so many people there and the music was sounding too good so I made my way to the floor and danced almost non-stop!! It was such a hyped atmosphere that I didn't care who saw me or who made jokes, I had fun!! And now I'm so tired and my feet are aching and I still have to study for my meeting tomorrow. But it was all worth it for those few hours of fun. Now off to studying and then I'm gonna throw on my headphones and fall asleep to Ms. Erykah Badu.     &nbsp;  BTW, for those who don't know, she had a baby girl on July 5th. The father is still unknown but the name isn't; PUMA!!! U heard right, Puma, like the shoe. Now, Seven was a cool name when she named her son but Erykah got some 'splaining to do about Puma. ( and why didn't someone tell me how good Mama's Gun is? Y'all let me miss out for this long? You ain't right!!) - (and if anyone's actually reading this blog, gimme some kind of sign) : )    &nbsp;    Current Ear-gasm----->Nina Sky -   "Move Your Body"

       There's not much to report in my life except for the usual drama. My moms decided to have a little get-together this weekend so I'm excited about that since me and all my friends get to hang out again before our summer excursions. And speaking of my moms, same old drama between me and her. Except she's upped the drama ante by talking about how ima cause her to have a stroke and put her in the hospital and stuff like that. I've just come to the realization that my mother and me are incompatible and the best way for us to get along is to say as less as possible.    &nbsp;  And I'm not the only one who feels that way because, even though she thinks my other siblings are near-angelic, some of them are the ones that come and tell me things about my mother and we talk about how she is and her way of thinking and her whole mentality and how we know how to deal with her. She's never changed and she never will but she needs to realize that she's ever-so-slowly pushed her kids farther away from her and I'm next. We all love her and none of us want to say anything bad about her but....we don't have much good to say either. But I'm tired of stressing out over my mother and I'm just gonna let her be.    &nbsp;  On the other end of my life, I had&nbsp;a certain dilemma involving my best friend and another "associate" of mine but with some advice from a friend and some own self-examination, I made a decision. Other than that, I've decided not to sweat the small stuff and just find pleasure in the simple things of life and enjoy the rest of my summer.    &nbsp;  Oh yeah, and I'm only 1 away from 100 at Epinions and I'm so excited simply because I never thought I would stick with the site that long and I have so I'm proud and amazed. Now I just wish the eps members would stick with my reviews and not ignore the older albums I review while glorifying the newer ones. The caliber of each review is the same, I think. But beggars can't be choosers, right?    &nbsp;    Current Eargasm---->     RES - "Tsunami"

       Sorry for no posts over the weekend but that’s because I almost had a nervous breakdown over the fact that I thought I was gonna be permanently cut off from Internet Access. Yes, me &amp; my ISP are like brother &amp; sister. OK, long story long. Friday night, after a couple hours randomly browsing the web, y’know, post a message or two at this message board here, IM with a few people there, the usual. So I sign off. Next day, I wake up, go to my meeting and go to the store to grab some snacks for a day of relaxing @ home since the heat makes doing almost any activity unbearable. So I get ready to sign onto AOL and for some inexplicable reason, it keeps saying my network connection is failing. So after several failed attempts, I wait until my moms comes home and informs her of the problem. So she calls AOL Tech Support 11 times in a row!!!! I kid you not!! We inform of the problem each time and they give me almost 11 different solutions. After the 11th failed attempt, I give up and call it a night. This morning, we call ATS again and tell them what’s happening and I’m informed that my modem keeps dropping out and it’s a defect with the modem and I’d have to call the manufacturer and get them to fix it. Now I realize this has to be a wrong answer since the modem does dial the access number, it just won’t connect to the service. So at this point, I’m pissed off as can be and extremely worried about the status of my online life (I’m a PC junkie). So I try to take my mind off things.     I go out to lunch with my friends and have some great food and good conversation. Then I go home to burn a couple CD’s for my friend and then it’s off to her B-B-Q. Still full from lunch, I play a couple games for a couple hours and then we all grub on some excellent food. Then we play some insanely fun party games that will be a staple at my parties for years to come. Finally, the party ends and I come home. My sister calls and my moms informs her of the problem with the PC and my sister tells me to do a System Restore with XP and go back to the day before the problem occurred. Whaddya know? It fixed the problem and I signed on with no problem. So I’m officially back online and the happiest boy in the world!! And it amazed me how my sister knew more about how to fix the problem than the people that created the software!!!!       And there’s not a prejudice bone in my body so don’t let anyone take this out of context but isn’t there something shady about the fact that out of the 11 service reps I talked to, 8 of them were foreigners? I promise you, I dealt with 8 different accents. I just thought how interesting it was that foreigners were hired to maintain American products. And don’t get me started on how you have to talk to 5 separate recordings until you get to a real live person!! So even though I’m officially anti-AOL and will cut them loose the minute we get Verizon DSL in October, I’m still ecstatic over the fact that my Internet is back. Got 2 go. Got some online homework to catch up on.        Current Eargasm -->   TLC  -  “What About Your Friends?”
