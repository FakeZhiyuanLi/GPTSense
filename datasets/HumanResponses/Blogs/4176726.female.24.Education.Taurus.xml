      You might think I have this cute little puppy, but really, she is the devil sometimes. You all know I am NOT a morning person and it is all I can do to remember I love this dog when she is biting me 10 seconds after stumbling out of bed. But I suppose if I had been locked up in a crate for six hours with nothing to do, I'd be pretty wound up too. At any rate, Jovi has done really well this week with RA training. She has to stay in her crate for about 4-5 hours at a time and then gets a quick walk/potty break before another 4-5 hour stretch. I'm beyond exhausted with training, but we only have a few more days of this part of it. She has not had any accidents in her crate or my apt. for a couple days and has quickly learned that outside=treat and that potty=treat. Eskies are smart dogs.  As for the Kami bonding, Jovi loves to chase Kami. It's her favorite thing to do. Poor cat. She just wants to sit around, eat, and look pretty, not get chased by a fuzzball 1/3 her size.

      Jovi had her first play date with my colleague's husband,  Matt. He loves dogs and they had a great time playing together. I was really worried about taking her to a new apartment, but she stayed on her best behavior and did not have any accidents. This was a very important milestone because Matt will be her first puppy-sitter this weekend when I go to Hershey Park for RA training. I love the fact that I have to go to Annapolis and sail, and now Hershey Park as part of my job. It's great.

      Well, Kami finally started smacking Jovi around this morning. Kami was sitting on the futon in her spot and Jovi wanted to come up and play, so she stood on her hind legs and started to bark and play with Kami. My cat did not appreciate this, and whopped Jovi upside the head. When this failed, she then proceeded to use Jovi's nose as a punching bag. You know how boxers warm up with the punching bags and rapid right/left hooks? Yup, that's what happened here. I was laughing so hard I almost fell off the futon. Instead of realizing that Kami was getting furious and now hissing, Jovi thinks this is a great game to play ALL DAY. Poor cat. She just wants to be a normal cat who sits around all day looking pretty, sleeping, eating, and getting fat. Too bad Jovi has other plans for their free time!

        Jovi was great on the drive back from North Carolina which was much much shorter than the 11 hour drive down to Raleigh. The best part had to be when she had her first french fry and then proceeded to roll in something disgusting and sticky. Dirty dog in less than two hours after adoption. She was pretty good on her first night and slept for five hours. Little did I know how much I would appreciate that chunk of sleep time at once.
  Kami was not at all happy to discover that one of those evil little white animals she thought had been left behind in Michigan, had now followed her to her new PA home. She sulked for awhile until realizing that Jovi was on lockdown. Then she pranced. :) Jovi, in the meantime, is terrified of this caramel blonde animal who is three times her size and makes funny sounds at her. Since this meeting, Jovi thinks Kami would make a great playmate and tries to play with her tail when it hangs off the couch. I'm just waiting for Kami to smack her upside the head!
  Sunday was a  challenging day with many potty accidents inside. The funniest part has to be when Jovi discovered that there is a dog in the oven who looks at her every time she walks by. The first time I heard her bark was at this reflection. Now she growls at herself everytime in the kitchen. 
  The other kitchen battle occurs with morning feedings. Kami is used to being promptly fed the moment I wake up and not waiting one second longer. When I had the nerve to put Jovi's food down first, Kami body-slammed her out of the way and started to eat her food. We're still working out the kinks of the food system, but Kami is now fed first and I stand guard over Jovi to block Kami's vulture attempts.
  The last couple nights have been rough with the interrupted sleep for potty breaks. I don't know how people handle babies. I have newfound appreciation for them now! I'm hoping the nights get better soon because the RAs arrive this weekend and life is crazy busy for the rest of the month. There may not be enough coffee in the world to keep me awake through this.
