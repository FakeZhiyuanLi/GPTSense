						   This has been a good last couple of days. We won our victory in requesting the picture to be removed from the Camp St. Vincent website. It took a 2 1/2 hour meeting to get our point across, but it was done. We are grateful.  All is well.  Today is Father's Day and I was able to visit my father today. That was a good visit.  I don't have much to report today; and no links to share.  Perhaps tomorrow will be more informative.  Over and out!

						   I have a meeting at my church today. A meeting at which I've taken the day off work, am printing out pictures of black sambos with watermelons ... all because a webmaster in the church has published on a church website a picture of African American children eating watermelon, and that bothers me.  Depending on when you read this post ... the picture is located at:  urlLink www.campstvincent.org , under "Camper Fees." This picture is a stereotypical imagery of the racist watermelon images of 50+ years ago during Jim Crow days. I say depending on when you read this post, because I intend that this picture will ultimately be removed.  For some reason, our webmaster at church, doesn't see this. So ... we're having a meeting today.  I am looking forward to educating this young man about the unintentional effects of racism, and I will be compassionate towards him in understanding that he didn't intentionally post this picture. However, his refusal to remove it, BOTHERS ME. And it bothers others in the parish as well.   Let's hope all goes well.

						   I enjoy blogging because it makes me sit down and take a moment and STOP all the madness of "busyness!" So for the next 2-3 minutes at the least, I am not too busy to blog my thoughts. That's a tremendous endeavor, I would say!  Today is Wednesday and it looks like it's going to be a good day with the weather.  I have to work today. However, I find that at work my primary function is to organize my MIND, so that I can do all that I have to DO. If the mind is not straight, the action is not straight. This is my experience.  BUSY-NESS (Definition) - the state of being mentally preoccupied with many things at once.  I'm starting my own dictionary. My closest friends tell me I need to do this because I'm come up with words and expressions that they don't understand. Ah well. Like the word, "WERLD." Now see; I think that's pretty self-explanatory. But here we go:  WERLD (Definition) - the WEIRDNESS of the WORLD = WERLD  Have a great day!

						   Hello WERLD,  I've come to the conclusion, for today at least, that the most effective way to simplify your life is to say NO to whatever you have to say NO to, no matter what the consequences of that NO is.  I find that I have the tendency to take responsibility for everything and everyone. Enough of that, ya know? I'm convinced that this is why people are overweight. They are holding onto other people's rants, raves, issues, anger, etc., that doesn't belong to THEM. It's like overweight people are sponges for the negativity of the werld. What if overweight people were to really throw their weight around and say, Take THIS! Take THAT! as in take this argument back! take that blame back! Enough already.  I personally am tired of people in my life coming to me, mad ... and saying, YOU! Um, NOOOOO, YOU! I didn't make you mad, YOU made you mad!   Today it's balmy and wet and humid outside here in Philadelphia, and I guess I'm just feeling the weather's pain. TAKE THE PAIN BACK, WEATHER!  Over and out.

						   Today is a quiet day. I'm just trying this out to see how far this blog thing goes ... how far  I  go.  I have many interests that I pay attention to everyday, or some of them on some days and others on other days. Where am I today? I am studying for my Ph.D. program at  urlLink Clayton College of Natural Health.  I am studying Holistic Nutrition, to have information on board to take care of mu foster daughter who is HIV+.   Firstly though, I am a librarian. I have my MLS degree from  urlLink Clarion University  of Pennsylvania. It's a wonderful school with alot of heart. There are alot of good people at Clarion.  I work at the  urlLink Free Library of Philadelphia.  It's a weird place with a fantastic history and wonderful, phenomenal people who work there. But it's still a weird place for some reason ... more on this later?  I have 5 daughters, Jasmine, Amrita, Julia, Kahaja and Tanisha. They breakdown into two sets: Jasmine, Amrita and Julia are my biological children. Kahaja and Tanisha are my foster/adopted daughters.  I'm married ... twice over. My ex-husband is the father of my daughters, and my second husband, Karl, is the father of all of them. Karl's a smart guy. He works for the University of Pennsylvania as a computer support person at the Engineering School there. He knows alot of stuff, but doesn't do much with the information. However, he is definitely someone great to talk to.  I have alot of friends. GOOD FRIENDS. It took a long time to get them! I go to a great church ... job's okay for the most part, alot of good stuff.  I'm very grateful for my life.  Historical note for today:  urlLink Ronald Reagan's funeral  is today.

						   Hello WERLD:  G.O.A.L.S. is a "Gathering Of African Americans in Library Service." It is a professional networking organization that caters to the professional development and enhancement of African American librarians and library workers in the Philadelphia area. We also garner support for and from anyone who works in library service within the African American community.  See my thing is this: affluent communities will always have access to information and those who are commissioned to bring in that information will always be top notch professionals, supported by the best of the best, so to speak.  In urban neighborhoods, this tends to not be the case. Information professionals are not respected, we are not professionally nurtured by our employers. We don't receive information that is applicable to our unique clientele, we tend to get information that is for "everyone" and we have to work underground to get to our people informationt that they will respond to.   Just as emergency services and educational services are slow filtering into the urban "hoods", so is information services. And without efficient, high quality access to information, it is next to impossible to adequately navigate oneself in this world.  Enters G.O.A.L.S.  G.O.A.L.S. is a mechanism through which black librarians, library workers and others who work in black libraries or information outlets that cater to black clientele can hear their own voices, filter in outside information that they can take back to the hood or their clientele who can use the information. G.O.A.L.S. achieves empowerment of the African American information professional and therefore the empowerment of black people in terms of their information needs.  This organization started two years ago, almost to the date, in Florida at a professional black librarians' conference, held by the Black Caucus of the ALA (BCALA). Myself and my colleague/friend, Angela Willie, were talking in the pool of all places about starting a BCALA Chapter in Philadelphia. I was like: "Let's do this!"   When I got back to Philly, my mentor, Helen Miller, suggested that I do this ... she said I was the one to do it. So I did.  I got my best buddy/colleague, Darren Cottman on board, along with another mentor of mine, Patricia Kelker, who was a long standing BCALA member and on BCALA's Executive Board ... and we created the first Gathering of African Americans in Library Service meeting at the Free Library of Philadelphia, in November 2002.   Since then we have grown by leaps and bounds, and will continue to do so. And you wanna know why? Because black librarians in Philadelphia are AMAZING PEOPLE. They are well traveled, educated, experienced ... open-minded, excellent writers and scholars, and committed to working in libraries that caters to their people. And if they are not working in an urban library, they are committed to representing their culture to its fullest, without compromise, wherever they are, whatever they are doing. And G.O.A.L.S. lives and breathes because of these awesome people. And it's a no-brainer that when all of them get together ... work together ... share information ... when they GATHER .... INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPEN.  If you want to learn more about G.O.A.L.S. check out: www.phillygoals.org.  Over and out!
