      its now the early hours of tuesday, and while i sit here, listening to Enya's orinoco flow, the rest of the the house sleeps, or at the very least is in bed watching TV, i feel like writing something.  Now im very tired so i think i will try to be philosophical, not an easy task even when im full awake. New song blink 182 - i miss you, This morning i will bring up the topic of love or, if you dont like that word (as i know many men dont) great fondness, what is love? is it just a feeling we get ot is there more to it? is there one true love out there for everyone? what happens if there is an odd numbr of people? if you love someone and they dont love back what happens then? so many questions surround love but to all those who believe in it and are "in love" there is only one answer, and that, quite ironicly, is love.  there are many songs descibing love, both true and tradgic, but the problem is that the song writers have no idea what it is either so it is all open to interpretation, some may say that falling in love is a long a process where you get to know the partner and you just let them grow on you like some sore of climbing plant, others say that love is instant, at first sight, that you know stright away who ou love whe you meet them. I wonder which is true if either?  All this is very confusing to a young, expanding mind like my own, New song Eels - i neep some sleep (how ironic, cause i do need some sleep), and due to my sleeping habbits i have a lot of time to think about these sorts of things, the sort of things that really mess your mind up, bored of the song so picked new one Queen - we will rock you :D, I think that why i started writing poems, i look at the ones i have infront of my and now realise that they are all about love. I never noticed that before but they are, mostly tradgic love but still love, and on closer inspection i can see that they are about one person, now for reasons of my own choise i wot say who that is, but still i can see now that there is one person i have in mind whe reading over these poems, does that mean i love her? have i been in lov and not known it?! Oh dear, this is going to end in tears i can tell. New song The Strokes - 12:51. Dont worry ido know this girl its not some celebrity crush,  GOD DAMN!  I think im in love!! hehe cool.

      Hmmm i dont know if i could keep this up daily, not sure if i think that much but i'll try.  So this is day 2 of the blog and not much has happened since yesterday, oh but i have had some good feedback on some of my poems, high ratings too but the feed back is more important to me, go to the studentcenter.org to see them search for the username "afroman101". this one sees to be the most popular:

      Its been all of a few minutes of my first post and I thought I might as well post again.  So......lets see.......damn, I cant think cause I got that bloody song by the 5.6.7.8's in my head, you know the one, i think its called woo hoo. thats really the only words to itbut ok heres some advice for life, listen carefull these may save your life someday   If  someone is about to kill you and ask "Any last requests?" say "yes, i would like you to read the whole bible to me, in the oragional latan text."  If you and your best friend are being chasd by a hunry lion, dont try to out run the lion, just your friend.  Never send a colour blind person to cut the red wire on a bomb  To find out how many lives a cat has left, hit it with a hammer until it doesnt get back up, the number of hits it took is the number of lives it HAD.  Wood stain is a fast and attractive alternative to sun bed treatments.    There thats it for now. If anyone reads this please tell me.
