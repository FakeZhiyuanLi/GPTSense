      i just read ALL of my past entries to this thing i call my "journal". and as i was reading them i was trying to see them from another perspective, as if i was one of u reading this.   it's strange to me, how much i've changed in such a short period of time, i mean between each entry it seems like i've changed, maybe it's not noticeable to all of u, but to me it's shockingly apparent! like my first few entries, i tried not to write about anything significant, but then i got comfy w/this and now i can write about anything, and i used to try to write them all fancy, and essay-like, but now, i think it's better to write them "free-style" those r just the changes in my writting style, not even the changes in my life, it seems like things have changed soooo drastically since that first entry, about wut's important, about wut i'm like on a daily basis, i mean im just a completely different person, and i caught myself thinking about how often people change, and u don't even notice it, and how some people say they want things to go back to the way they were, and they think things won't change, but things are always changing, it's a law of nature! im glad i've changed, i think i'm maturing rapidly, i feel that i have more going for me, i don't update this just cuz im bored, i update it cuz i feel that someday i'd like for people to read these, bcuz i want a record(for me) about wut i was like, a week ago, a month ago, or a year ago anyhow, i don't know where i'm going w/this, but if ur reading it, im hoping it's cuz u want to and bcuz u genuinly care, otherwise..wut's the point?? "there's a first time for everything" don't b in a hurry to rush thro them, they will happen on their own time, opportunities will knock (or type) and only wen they r available, r u truely ready for them, so like i say, don't rush things changedfish

      people r crazy! life is crazy! and ya no wut, i think i like it!  spontaneity is wut makes life fun. i mean would life b half as enjoyable if u knew exactly wut was gonna happen, all the time? nope, it wouldn't, i mean, where's the fun if u already know when everythings gonna happen? like wouldn't u then spend ur whole life trying to prevent the inevitable? i think i would, it'd b sooo stressful, always trying to figure out ways not to do wut u know ur going to do anyhow. on a different side of that thot, knowing what was going to happen would change how hard u try at things, like if u knew wut grade u were gonna get, would u study harder to see if u would get a better grade? no, u probably wouldn't, u would stop attempting to "beat the system" and just accept everything at face value, and that's depressing, to say the least.   things would never b exciting,  i mean if u knew wut people were going to say to u, knew wut people would do things wouldn't get as exciting, if u knew he was going to propose, would u really b brought to tears by his love poem? not likely in conclusion i would like to say (man this sounds like a bad term paper!but neway) i would like to say to everyone "enjoy life's strange pleasures, enjoy those weird things that make u giggle, even those things that make u sad, just remember that life wouldn't b as much fun, if u knew those things ahead of time, cherish wisdom, and grab hold of innocence"  changedfish

       thanxgiving this year  WOW, it was just thanxgiving and all, the fam's still here, there's still turkey and pie, and yet this year it didn't really seem like much of a holiday.  y? u may ask, was it different? well, i guess it hasn't been a true thanxgiving, bcuz it was here, at my house and that's just not where thanxgiving is supposed to b, it's supposed to b up at my aunt and uncle's cabin in Arnold, CA, my grandma joan and grandpa harry r supposed to b there, and Harry's supposed to spend time picking out these absolutely perfect presents to bring to the cabin just bcuz he feels like it. grandma joan would wear her turtle necks and her kitty sweatshirts and my cuzin's would be giggling and making fun of each other, my uncle taking 3 hrs to get THE perfect picture for their christmas cards, and my aunt buzzing in the kitchen, makeing little sarcastic remarks about everything, my parents always bug the heck out of me and my sister and we'll stay in a little "timberline lodge" about 5 mins. away from the cabin.  my mom always buys a lite up house to give as a "hostess gift" to my aunt and uncle, and we would go to the little craft fair the day after thanxgiving. that's how things were, that's how i thot they'd always b on thanxgiving, it was the plan, it was home and it was wonderful, w/ the "comfy chair" and the fire going, it was perfect. this year was different alright, things have been different for a few yrs now, since my grandma joan got cancer, since she died and harry didn't come, no perfect gifts, that he thot out and planned so carefully, just for everyone, just like he knew they'd like it.  since it was at my house, since there was no Arnold, CA, since there was no ace hardware store down the street and the little breakfast restaurant on the corner.  since everyone's older, and nothing is the same, since my sister had to work and we ate at 1:00 in the afternoon.  no, things werent the same this year, and never will be ever again, but were things bad, were things horrible? no, things were wonderful, and happy, and just as it should b!

       Poem  (slightly plagerized, but mixed up, so it's not really!) I have nothing to give to you, the audience, except for I, myself.  For, i'm just a girl in the world and i need ur sweet love to ease all the pain. Or am i still waiting for this world to stop hating, just stop in the name of love, cuz baby there ain't no mountain high enought, to show me the meaning of being lonely.  I love u more than a fat kid loves cake but Mr. Reynolds said 'may the horse be w/u" i'll b ur crying shoulder, but i'll still pick my friends over u.  Never thought i'd b the one who'd slip but in the end it doesn't even matter, so come give me a hug.  I'm alone and the world is having more fun than me.  Take my breath away for i searched the world for a poem i could write.  u r my fire, my one desire and i've found that there's something women like about a pick up man but i wish they all could be california girls.  and i wanna talk about me cuz i'm bad to the bone, can u help me find a way to carry on? see where i've been, i know what ur going through.  i know ur name and i weep when u hurt and i cheer when u win.   i luv u all shine w/the stars forever, one luv, one God, one way: Peace out pallies!!  that was my farewell poem for drama 1 last year, but i really liked it, so i typed it out for all-a-yall hope u enjoy it (if u were wondering where u heard some-a that stuff, they're all song lyrics, cept the begining and the end.) anyhow, changedfish

      goodness gracious, i luv to write!!! i mean everything makes sense on paper, or rather on computer screen.  it seems this has been quite a blessing actually, i mean i dunno, i've never had the determination to actually pick up that whole journal thing!! but here, it's like i'm online anyhow, so y not? and people can read it, and understand me better, i don't have to explain myself, but yet, i feel like im not really talking to anyone!!!   some people ask u to describe urself, and u know how u just tense up and get clammy and u start w/a meek "uh...um...well...i guess...um.." ring a bell? thot so...but i figure w/this i can think about my answer, it's not a direct connetion, i can edit and delete etc, etc. so first of all, if u've even read one entry b4 u've prolly figured out that i luv music!!!! it's just my nature, i'm always around it, listening to it, like 24/7, i sleep w/it on, i wake w/it on, it's just the best thing God has for us, besides himself, that's y i luv church songs, i mean combining the two best things in life, wut could be better? uh...NOTHING!!! but on a different note, im also very lively, wen im not around music, im around people!! I LUV PEOPLE, its just my nature, i'm always around them, thinking about them conversing w/them etc. etc. etc.  i mean geez, wut's better than listening to music w/friends, or going to uth group w/ur buddies? not much, that's for sure... i used to think i was missing out on something great, like there must b SOMETHING i was missing, sheilding myself this way. but then i realized it's not me, obviously! i mean, ya im missing some things, but nothing i need! i know wut i need and i know wut He wants for me, so y search unneccasarily? exactly! it's the same w/dating...i don't go around dating a buncha guys just for fun, im waiting, for a good one, a nice christian guy that's gonna like me, no matter how loud and "eccentric" i am, no matter how much i don't resemble a Barbie doll. for every time i think i'm not good enuf, i no that it's not tru, i know it, and yet i don't always think it...DANG!! im confused, doesn't it seem? but im not, truely, i don't think i am, i think i have a lotta things figured out that a lotta other people, (girls esp.) don't! um..u've prolly grown tired of these long, drawn-out, confusing entries, it seems that's all i write, but to me,thats the best kind, it gets into my mind, it helps me to think, it helps me to connect my thots in type, it really, genuinly does, no matter wut's going on w/everything and everyone else, i manage to write down my thots and process them along the way, and really now, how long does it take to read this? not long i don't think, esp. if u want to! anyhow, cutting off, changedfish

       more lyrics  (haven't written in a few days, geez, i need to catch up, so here's some food for thot) well, a great guy once wrote a song about his childhood called "Revenge of the Nerds" and during that song the last verse goes something like this:  Now days I’m a little older plus a little bolder  but it seems like I just can’t get over  you ever have a day where nothing goes right  well that just seems to be the story of my whole entire life  so anybody out there know what I mean?  to feel like your third string on a football team?  and ya never ever gonna reach any of your dreams?  and your only hope is making onion rings at burger king...   well, just as ur about to feel sorry for the guy, and ur feeling a little down cuz u just know u can relate perfectly, and u've felt that all the time, he ends the verse w/this lovely tune:  but now a days a lot of things done changed  since Christ came into my life now and just rearranged  the way I look at myself son it aint the same  I drive in a whole ‘nother lane going against the grain  I know it might just seem a little strange  the fact remains I changed when I called on his name  so call me a nerd call me lame it don’t matter to me...   and u realize that he had one heck of  a crummy childhood, and he turned it around for the good!! sometimes i feel like life's just annoying, and i'm just plain having a rough day, but then i remember, wait, i have a great life, and nothings going terribly wrong and i don't need to throw a flippin pity party, i need to have a real party!! cuz who cares? that's exactly it, no one cares the same about u as u do, cept God!!! anyhow, im pretty peachy now cuz i had a bad day, and it's gonna end up being a good day if God or i have anything to do w/it and since both will, then welp, my day's gonna b great!! aight, peace out everybody, changedfish

       my sister  many of u may have siblings, i no u love them. i luv my sister, that's true, but it's a strange relationship.  recently, i've resorted to eavesdropping her phone convo's and reading her blog's just so that i can no wut's goin on. and then to find out, i realize that she's not telling me for a reason!! becuz she  doesn't  want me to know and i should except that!! but its soooooo hard! most people think they understand and they don't, it's like the worst thing going for me rite now, and it should be one of the best, don't u see, a sister's supposed to love me, to b there for me, to wanna talk (at least every once in a while) about my life, and her life, about boys and school, or at least fashion!!!  not my sister, ya no i used to think i'd like to b close to her, i used to think i wanted to b like her, now i dunno wut i want! i dunno wut im gonna get, i know wut i need but it's not gonna happen!! this may b a confusing entry for those of u that don't know me well, or even at all, and don't know my sister or haven't heard about her...but well, that's ok, this entry's for me, only me, i don't care if u read it, i don't mind if u talk about it, but if u don't understand it, well i understand that (get it?) my sister used to b a role model, an ok (to say the most) student, but at least she cared, an awesome christian (altho she was very private about it) and she cared about me, or so i thot, i've never really talked to my sister, hugged her, shared much w/her, or really spent time w/her, but i've always looked up to her, always loved her, and most definately always cared a lot about wut she thot!! she was miss suzy middle school growing up, skinny as a bean pole, and the one w/all the b/fs!  and i wanted sooooooo much to b like her, for i was the pudgy girl, the "friend" NEVER the g/f i mean never, to this day i've never even held hands w/a guy, let alone kiss him (sure i've had a hug or two) well, as the story goes, she got to high school and lost a bit of that immediate "hotty status" as i like to put it, but she was still, basically my idol!  now-a-days, it's strange becuz i look at her, and realize that all along i really think i've had it pretty good, and now im doing very well, and she's not, and i STILL want to b like her!! crazy i no, becuz we're such opposites, but she always will b my big sister, even tho she'll never willingly touch me, or take me shopping or gossip about boys, i no she loves me! no matter how many times she tells me wut a whore, and slut i am i know it's just for fun!! and most of all, no matter how many tears i cry becuz she's throwing her life away, i'll never change her, so, back to square one i go or rather negative!! wutev!!!changedfish

       music  ever notice how much music impacts ur life? i mean i can't tell u how many hours i've spent just listening to music!! and do u notice the mood different music puts u in? i mean if i listen to sad, slow music, i feel sluggish and teary (well, not teary exactly, im not much for that crying thing) but if i listen to like happy, rock and upbeat stuff, i feel happy and upbeat! most people don't think it's important about wut kind of music u listen to, but i think there is more to consider wen picking a radio station.  i mean, wut kind of mood do u want to b in? ever notice that depressed people have depressed music? u may think they chose that music becuz of the mood they were in, but i think the music chose their mood!  many people think my choice of christian music is lame, y i seem to ask a lot? i mean, there is everytype of music w/a christian tone.  ever get a song stuck in ur head? im sure u have, and wen u go to sing it out loud i bet u don't notice the words that r comming out of ur mouth, maybe not.  i do tho, i like to sing, a lot!!, everyone that knows me knows i sing all the time, "even to the point of nausea" as the saying goes. but wut i sing has good meaning! it's pure wholesome good music!! i dunno zactly where im goin w/this, but next time ur listening to music think about the words and whether or not u'd like to b caught singing them out loud and that's all she wrote folks, changedfish

      S.H.I.T. you may use this word but do u know where it comes from?....didn't think so, it is actually an acronym for Ship High In Transport.  reason?: because in the old days they used to ship cow manure in large ships to b used as fertilizer. the only problem however, was that wen cow manure gets wet (as in soaks in the bottom of the ship) it produces a menthane gas which would blow up the ships.  once they figured that out, they would mark the manure "ship high in transport" or "shit"   interesting facts that plague the mind!!, byby now, changedfish

       THIS IS FOR DAN!!!  actually, this is lyrics from a totally awesome song, and i no u'll prolly never even read this, but it reminded me of u, don't sweat it bro!  Wonder what can be so bad  That it makes you want to die  I wonder what could be so tragic  Makes you want to take your life  You have your Savior on the cross  While you sit on the throne  Put yourself up on that cross  Put your Savior on the throne   And I know it's hard to take what's happening  And I know life is tough sometimes  And I know it seems like there's no hope for you  And I know your life is worth more than you can see   It's hard to see beyond your pain  When you feel so dead inside  It's hard to see what you've been given  It's hard to find the hope in life   And I know it's hard to take what's happening  And I know life is tough sometimes  And I know it seems like there's no hope for you  And I know your life is worth more than you can see   And I say look at Jesus' hands  Those scars are there for you  You know He understands  What you're going through  babe, He knows, let him handle it!!!

      Alright, 2nd entry!~ unfortunately this one may be just as, or more so, heated at the first, u see im a bit peaved!! i don't enjoy saying that i talk bad about people, i don't like people to do it, but sometimes it's due.  i just spent an hour in the rain and the cold, see ur breath temperatures, trying to sell 50/50 tickets at a football game that like 10 people were at!!! and the coach didn't show up!!! i didn't know wut i was supposed to do, i've never done it, how am i supposed to no?? exactly!! well, i called his house and his wife said he went out to dinner before he was supposed to come, so while i sat in the rain alone for a 1/2 hr. and w/my pal angel (who was supposed to b selling them w/me) for the other 1/2. he was filling up on ribs!!! im sure he has a reason, maybe i misunderstood, maybe he told me he wasn't going to be there, but i really don't think so, i think he feels im "responsible" enuf to know what to do...and i dont!! o well, wut'd i have to do anything--that's y im really mad, is that i spent that time in the cold, doing nothing and i come home and i was having more fun there!!! that's how sad my life is rite now!! i start out my great 4 DAY WEEKEND!!! w/a rainy fball game and an e-diary entry!! how much does that suck? a lot i'll tell ya!! and im pondering wut to do..do i call someone and chat it up w/them, cuz there sure the heck isn't anyone online, do i watch the ever-entreaging television, listen to my music and write a zillion more entries???? I DON'T KNOW!!! i don't drive, i don't have a big "party" life, so this is wut i do w/my weekends!! anyhow, im done w/this..ima get off and do  something  usefull!!

       i am jello!  i've come to the strange conclusion that  i am jello ! y u may ask? welp, becuz im just plain jello-y, im never firm on things, i try to b, really i do, i try to stick up for myself and others, i try to stay w/my principles and decisions, i try to b stubborn and pompus, but...well... it's just not me, it's like, just wen i make up my mind about something, or someone, some unexpected thing happens and i cave in, i change my mind. I AM JELLO! i should learn to b firm, i should b able to hold my mold, but truth is, im not even jello, i'm like pudding, i don't even hold shape, i look like i do, i seem to have firmness and texture, but really, i don't.  people think (esp. my mom) that i have these high standards that i uphold so well, that i don't give in to anyone, or anything, but she's wrong, she doesn't know me, she know's nothing about me, she's not as observant as she seems to think, she really is quite blind about most things, i mean, ya she believes wut i tell her for the most part, and that's good, she trusts me and all, but she doesn't know me, and she doesn't see me, or how i am, or what my friends r like, even who i hang out w/. i mean i know it's gotta b hard for a parent to know these things, and i don't think it's a bad thing, i don't think she's a poor mother, i think she's great, but i think she's ignorant, and thinks she knows more than she does...she likes the innocent bit she's living, like i think she knows wut my sister and i do, but it's like she never says she does, and i don't think somethings she would approve of, but she never really protests, she just acts like she doesn't know any better.....WUTEVER, wut do i no? im jello! have a wonderful holiday season, changedfish

       "God didn't promise days without pain, laughter without sorrow, sun without rain, but He did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears, and light for the way."  and yet once again i have nothing too great to say, and still i feel compelled to write, it's like a part of me now, to let u all know how i am, how im doing and all, it's some crazy twisted compulsion i have, i dunno wut it's about, but i guess, wen i'm happy i have nothing to say, and wen stuff's screwed up, i have soo much to say, but it isn't really as important as it seems, so who knows y i write it down anyhow, i don't think before i talk and i guess it carries over to my typing, cuz i don't really think about wut i write either, as u can see im sure.  but ya, boyz r strange and life is good, and finals r starting and breaks almost here, which means semester's almost over, and well, gosh darn im just wonderful if u ask me, i wasn't feeling extremely peachy today, but now, now that im home, and it's just me, to myself and my own selfish whims and my christian radio station, welp, im content and i'm extraordinarily happy!! this entry is about nothing, but really all of mine r about nothing basically so this isn't anything new for u. 'sides, i spend more time worrying about wut i am going to say, or wut i did/do say, that it's not really worth it!!! changedfish

       Semi-Formal  WOW! that was soooo much fun!! im sooo glad i went! ya i think it'da been a lotta fun w/a date and all, but i still had fun.  a buncha my friends came over for dinner before hand so that we didn't have to worry about going out (esp. cuz we don't drive) and then i had girls come over afterward as well, so i now have the "party house" (or not actually, but i can imagine) pretty much everyone had a fun! and it was really enjoyable to get to dress up, and ya no, wear makeup and all (cuz i don't do that on a regular basis) and ya, i seriously danced off like 5 lbs.!! and...well ya, it was just really great, all my stress over this whole thing seems so lame now, cuz everything turned out so great, and i didn't regret any of the night...things were just fairy-taleish and all, so thanx to everyone who made me go!! changedfish

      i have nothing shocking to say today, i really never do, but at the moment i was just sitting here thinking how i never see wut other people see.  i mean i never see me as others do, physically or not, i just plain don't see myself thro the eyes of others.  i mean im not saying other people do, but i always think that other people understand how they're veiwed by the world, they know where they stand, where they belong, and altho i know it's not true, its just wut i seem to think.  it's like u no how, some days people keep saying u look good, and ur just like, wut? i look horrible today, i didn't even take a shower this morning! (well, people don't usually compliment u on those days but ya) u know wut i mean? it's like u never can tell wut u come across as, i never know how i sound to others, sometimes i feel bad, cuz people take me the wrong way, other times it worx in my favor (not often) sometimes the way i say something, sounds like im mad, and people get offended, and sometimes i look like somethings wrong, and nothing is. other times i appear happy and im not. im not saying people r bad at reading me, i think i'm bad at conveying my feelings correctly, the way i do things just doesn't match up. i dunno, if i knew, then i wouldn't spend all this time typing this out...obviously! anyhow, catch ya later, changedfish

      wow wen the stress is gone all ur left w/is emptiness! i seem to b quite the complainer, especially wen it comes to stress, but i've realized, that that's all  my life is...busyness. so y complain? y try to rid myself of it? if it's wut i do well, if it's wut makes me happy...y try to rid myself of it? i mean, it's like my life has no real purpose anymore, it used to, i used to b totally on God, all the time, that's wen i was soo happy, and it's not that im not happy now, it's just that im distant. i mean, it seems like wen i have down time, wen things r dull, i have nothing at all to do, and rather do wut i need to do, rather than spend that time w/God, i find something insignificant to do (actually really, i end up spending time on this hunk of machine) strange that my life is so on and off, im a light switch, really! its like wen im on, i give it my all, and im all over, doing everything i can, doing my best, but wen im off, i don't have a job, and it's awfully dark.  i can't stand dark, dark makes me think of evil, of life w/o God of scary scary times. and light, well light is luv and happiness, and comfort, it's God, right there, next to u.  it's funny, no matter how distant i become, he's always there, it's not like i left, or he left, we just don't say much, i try to ignore him, but he'll always b there, waiting for me. no matter wut, i always come back, no matter wut i think is more important, i always no its really not, and everytime i think that i no best, he puts me right back in my place and really...that's the best times, wen im humbled, wen i realize how much i need him...wen i think about wut my life would b like w/o that relationship. it'd b pretty dull, pretty sad, depressing and dark. i luv my music, i luv my family, but it's that agape luv that is for the Lord, unconditional, everlasting, pure love,  ya, i'll do other things, ya, i'll luv other people and things, ya, things'll get bad and good, but he never changes,no matter wut, no matter how much the world around me changes, no matter how much i change, he doesn't, he's the same for eternity past and eternity future. and that's how i like it changedfish

      I found something out about myself recently, something strange that i really never knew i did.  i over-react, now those of u who know me, also no that im extremely loud, and vibrant and at times a bit over-excited, and maybe u noticed that i do that, but i sure never did, it's only wen i calm down and think that i realize how weird i was.  Things happen and im just plain stupid, i take things in a weird way, sometimes im happy, sometimes mad, sometimes big things don't even phase me, but small things, those are wut get me, some how i just over-analyze everything untill it turns into a big deal, that it's not. anyhow, i've been so over-stressed lately that i haven't had time enough to think things thro, but last nite i did some major thinking,  (mainly bcuz i had THE MOST STRESSFUL day) anyhow, each day this week has been busy, crammed, stressful, and confussing, and surprisingly, altho today was about the busiest day yet, i was really calm and collected becuz i'd had my thinking time. u guyz really don't care, i no, but if u really didn't care, then y r u still reading? exactly, i no that SOMEONE out there cares enuf about me to want to know more about me, and how my mind worx, so if u've stayed tuned this long, i just want to say, thank you, and that im glad that u actally bothered to try and figure me out, maybe u can tell me more about me, cuz i sure don't get me. and now that i've confused u once again, i'd just like to let u no that i appreciate u, and everyone else in my life, life's tuff and i've had a LOT of help, so anyhow, thanx, changedfish

      alright, i no, it's country lyrics, but it sorta has the general theme of wut im thinking/feeling at the moment, just generally, that i think ignorance really is bliss, and sometimes i wish i just plain didn't know any better.  its not that i want to live in the dark, but sometimes things u find out, even if they seem like good things, are things u actually wish u didn't know country song that is for me right now: I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then I wish I could start this whole thing over again I'm not sayin' it's you could never be true I just don't wanna know how it ends You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends Yeah I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then

       LIFE'S WEIRD!!!  u no how u do something, bcuz at the time it was wut u were feeling, or bcuz u thot it was wut u wanted, and then later u think, "u idiot!! that was sooo stupid, u just screwed urself over" u no how u do that? ya, well i seem to do it a lot, and only w/certain people. it's like if it really matters to me, i'll screw it up, but if i don't care then i do everything rite, y is that? that just plain sux!! i mean esp. wen things come back to bite u. i mean if u say or do something retarded and no one really notices or says anything, but u just feel stupid, then it's ok, but wen it comes back at u, and it was by far not the rite thing, or not wut u meant, or not practical bcuz wut u were feeling then isn't how ur feeling now, and u wish u could take it all back, but u no u never can bcuz people remember then it just kills u. most of u won't have any idea wut this is about, but if the person who does, reads this, then i'm glad, cuz im just sooooo screwed up and confused about just everything and the things i said rn't wut i really wanted, and i wish u didn't read those things and it's not that i wasn't thinking it, but i don't really believe it!! so, ya, that's all the weirdness u get to endure today, changedfish

      u no, sometimes i just wish things went differently! i wish i was this...or that...or not me! cuz if u haven't noticed, nothing goes the way i want it to! i mean, for a time it will, but in the end everything just gets screwy! (is that even a word? prolly not!) its not that i'm unhappy, it's not that i'm not enjoying everything about my life and stuff, i am. it's just that every-so-often i realize what could have happened and i just kick myself!!! i could have had what i wanted! or i could have avoided this! i mean, geez! y can't i just think about things before i do them? it's ridiculous! i screw up sooo many things because i say the wrong thing, most of the time because i say too much! and it sux! it's like, sometimes i wish i could just be one of those really quite girls that is just silent! i mean, guys like that, they like the whole mystery thing, and that annoys me, cuz i'll never be like that, i'll always talk way too much, i'll always say the wrong things, i'll always be the loud mouthed dork! and that just pisses me off!  but wutever rite? rite? no, not even! cuz it's not wutever, its my life dang it all! and if something goes wrong, it's not wutever to me! it's not! i just say it is! i just say i'm not pissed, i just say everythings ok, i just act like things don't bother me and everything in the world is rite and wonderful and peachy! y do i do that? why can't i just say some things? and not others? y do i talk forever on something that no one cares about and never about stuff thats really important to me?  i mean, when am i gonna get that people just don't care, and the only ones who do, r the people i'll never be able to talk about stuff with, so i guess in the end i'm just screwed up and only i know it! is that the case, is that what's really bothering me, that no one gets me, that no one knows what's bothering me! grr...and in the end, i still say "whatever, who cares?"  changedfish

      u no, sometimes i wish i were a guy! alright, not like u think.  it's just that guys have a simpler way about them. girls are so over-analyzing and so...so...girlie! i mean, ya so i think like they do, and i do what they do most of the time, but sometimes i'd just like to be a guy, to wear the pants in a relationship!  i'm not at ALL saying guys have it easy! by far they don't, i like being a girl for the most part. but it's like guys have all the power and they make all the decisions and sometimes i'd just like to make the decisions, plan the dates...i dunno what i'm saying, sometimes it's just weird.   im in another one of my strange moods. i no what ur thinking, not another weird entry, but if u've ever read these before u've got to know all of them r weird, so this will b no different.  it's just that i was talking to a friend about valentines day, and about sadie hawkins and all, and it's like, they're all so couple-based! i mean, geez, since wen does everything have to involve guys, and at least sadie's u get to ask the guy, but who the heck would i ask? i've got no one in mind! and i'm running out of resources! it's like most people have a back-up, but me...naw! i don't even have some dorky guy that likes me that i don't really like that i could just take along just to have someone! i mean, i don't really like anyone specific rite now, and i don't have anyone following after me, as usual, so where do i stand wen v-day comes and wen everyone's getting snagged for sadies? what am i supposed to do? this is nuts! i mean i'm friendly, i should have someone that i like! but i don't...i mean, sure i know who's hot and who's not, and i know a premium pick from the last apple in the barrel, but that doesn't help me spend the holiday of love w/someone i care about!  aight, n/m all this, i quit...if u like me...come out w/it...if i like u...i'll come out w/it! deal? not!!! never gonna happen, i wish i wasn't such a pessimist, i wish i had a better image of myself, but the sad truth of the matter is i don't and i may never...so i'm dealing w/this on my own, leave me be, nite, changedfish

      um...i no i haven't written in a while, i guess i haven't really had anything to say...still don't really, i mean i've had a good week, it was homecommming and it was kinda lame, but it was still good.  last nite was the games and the dance and stuff...i've decided that no matter how many times i tell myself that i hate dances, i still love to dance, so once i'm there i end up changing my mind.  the things i hate about dances haven't changed, i will never get used to, or accept the way people dress or act at dances, the way the staff just watches it and says nothing, the things u hear the things that happen, that will never change.  it hurts me to no that there's prolly not much i can do. and i hate the fact that girls feel they have to do that to get a guy, or hold his attention, or impress him or wutever, but i think it's sad, and sick! i feel that i shouldn't just go along w/it, but most of the time i feel powerless to stop it! i had fun however. i danced w/my friends and i loved it! i felt free of being so durn self-conscience! (i dunno how to spell that) it was kinda sad that they only played one slow song, (which i didn't get to dance to, cuz i had to run arrands for my some what absorbed "friends") but that was ok, cuz i don't really like slow dances personally lol, um...ya...it was really great and now i'm looking forward to the next one, which is sadie hawkins, and i have NO IDEA who i'll ask, but i'm sure i'll go w/someone, i hope, otherwise, stag's not so bad either. and ya...i'll chat w/yall later, changedfish

      wow! i have so much to say...so i'm just going to say it, u don't have to read this, and u sure don't have to agree, but i hope that u do and if u have any questions i'm open: rubbadubdub16@hotmail.com   i just got back from one of my winter camps and wow! i mean thats all i can say, it was amazing, sooo many people just gave there lives over to God and so many recommited and soo many more just realized what horrible habits they had formed, what things they were doing wrong, i mean we all realized how amazing the Lord truly is and that he's there for each and every one of us, that he's always with us, that we can't hide no matter how hard we try.   i don't no wut u all believe, and many of u may not know exactly wut i believe, but that's about to change, i've made a commitment to be bold, i've made a commitment to share and to love and to show the world what God has done for me, and what he can do for all of you! most of u may think this is one of those cheesy infomercials or one of those semons that u know you'll never understand-but its not, it's not about other people this is about me and God and all of u, (altho that seems like other people, it's not)  this is about me being sooo stupid and not sharing this, this is about me not just accepting anymore that my best friends are going to hell and they don't even care.  This is about what God has planned for u.  u guys don't even see it, i mean it's right in front of u. everything. everything around u everything u see, do, hear, smell, think, taste...everything.  how can u sit there in ur biology/science classes and see how perfectly everything works together, how each thing was created perfectly, how can u see that and not believe that there's something more? u must think about it...u have to care...sure this is "your life" u can live it however u want if u darn well please, but you'll never find what your looking for, i guarentee it.. all you girls that search for love and affection and protection and security in guys, all you guys that try to be tough and buff and macho, never showing emotions, never being serious....your missing the point, God doesn't care if u weigh 75 or 280, he loves you, his love is unconditional, that means he doesn't care what you've done, or how you've lived, that doesn't matter, he loves you anyway he will forgive u, he will let u start all over again, his love is forever. everyone screws up, some worse than others, in the worlds eyes, but no one screws up enuf not to recieve grace....yea, grace, that's "unmerited favor" that means it's wonderful gift that u recieve that u don't deserve, that isn't based on what u do or the things you've done, it's a free gift, and it's the gift of life, and you can't buy this gift and u don't deserve it, no one does, but u can recieve it, all you have to do is ask, it's your choice it's your decision.  you can't find this love anywhere else u no that..u can't...not in your looks, not in your relationships, not in your achievments, not in alchohol or drugs, not w/ur friends, not w/ur family, nowhere! except w/God. and he gives it out, to everyone, everyday, every second, for free! all you have to do is ask! changedfish

      wow, ur prolly wondering why it's been so long since i've written...well truthfully it's cuz i didn't know what to write, i didn't know if i should go into detail or if i should keep it mysterious, if i should tell everyone what the heck i was talking about or if i should just keep it simple and i decided that i'd just come out w/it and tell you all everything about everything (ok, maybe not THAT much, but ya) the "firsts" i was talking about was dating, ok, so i'd never been on a date, im not the only one, i know plenty of people (mostly girls, but still) that have never been on a date, some that never had a b/f or g/f etc. etc. but i now have, i went on a date w/my friend Will.  alright so u think, if it's a date y'd she call him her friend will, and not "this guy" or my b/f or something, truthfully we're not dating, prolly never will, he just called my out of the blue last friday and asked me to go w/him to the movies on saturday...it was weird, but i was hecka excited and very flattered as well, i mean he chose me, out of anyone he coulda called, he called me...awesome rite? it was a great date!!! he picked me up at my house (he already knows my whole family from forever ago, so that was a breeze) and we headed off, we saw Paycheck, which i would definately recomend! it was a good movie cuz it wasn't to much a girl or a guy movie, it was just both, and it wasn't too romantic so that was good, cuz i didn't want him getting any bright ideas, rite? anyhow, it kinda sucked cuz after that i had to go home, cuz we were having the neighbors over for dinner, which normally i could have missed, however they r new neighbors and they have a girl my age and anyhow i had to go, so that was sort of it...he took me home, came in, we hugged (my rents we in the kitchen so nothing else really coulda gone down there) and he left....hasn't called, i of course am not going to call him (cuz i just think if he wants to he will) and ya...so its like over...and even tho it was a really good date and all i really don't know how many more i want to go on, i mean i REALLY don't want to lead him on, cuz i hate wen girls do that, just cuz they want a date!  its not that i don't like him, or never have liked him or anything, it was just sort of everytime i thot about him romantically (don't think like that, i mean like dating him, or kissing him) i just was very aware that it was Will, and i just don't think i could! i mean if i didn't know him so well, and know how weird he is and how much i know i really prolly wouldn't enjoy a real relationship with him, then it'a been aight, but i dunno, it just isn't gonna happen, so i have NO idea wut to do now! i mean i can't break things off if nothing ever happens, but i'm afraid he's gonna call again and ask me to go out again and i dunno what to say, cuz i don't really want to say no w/o having a reason, or like shut him down w/o giving him a chance, sooooo....i dunno whats going down, all i can say is i have now officially been on a date, a real one (he paid and everything lol) so ya...things r good besides that too!! love u all soooo much, God loves you sooo much more than any of us can ever even think about or fathom in our wildest of dreams, so keep that in mind, changedfish

       Firsts  while i've always realized there's a first time for everything i didn't expect some of my firsts to come from certain places...aight so i haven't acheived many of the major firsts that generally come to mind..but sometimes i go by different rules and count different firsts, so wen i hit a first that is big by the worlds standards its absolutely gigantic for me!!! i mean geez!! im sooo naive and ignorant on everything...i don't know the rules i don't know wut im supposed to do...and these things don't exactly come w/a manual u no! sometimes i like the fact that i don't know..cuz then at least im sheltered but other times i wish i had the experience cuz at least then i wouldn't look so horribly stupid!! and i wouldn't be as nervous and all. i mean goodness it can not be this awkward for everyone...can it? o well, i guess "that's wut lifes for...findin out" see ya round, changedfish

      "rain is romantic"....and yet today it was sunny and tonite it was dry....... that wasn't so strange, it wasn't so hard, that wasn't as foriegn as i'd feared.  things went well.  is it bad to hope for many more nites like this one, and many more times like that? is it wrong to wish the movie never ended, that it never got any later, that he never had to leave....is that stupid?......well, i don't think so! i think there will be more nites like that and more fun times, more love songs about rain and bank robber movies, i think....or rather i hope....i hope so....changedfish

      HEHEHEHEHE! that's just what i've been feeling like lately, and it's strange, cuz wen it rains, i get sad, but for some reason-sometimes "the sun shines in the shadows"! i know i know, i'm a freak, but u already knew that so wut's it matter eh? its just that i've been keeping some things to myself, and i like it, i got the giggles today in class just thinking about stuff, and u know why i was so happy? cuz i didn't have to tell anyone, for once in my life i didn't feel compelled to tell my friends every detail, and it's been that way recently, i've been secretive, altho actually i've sharing more than i ever had before, and i still haven't told them a thing. wow, that was confusing, i even confused my self so:overview- i have been telling my friends a lot about stuff, w/o telling them anything at all and i'm happy about that! (get that?)----->whatev! i've had a great week and not even entirely because of the thing u'd think, i've just not had anything bad happen. sure, i get annoyed, agitated at times, but for the most part, things r finally looking up for me-sorta-- so to my friends:thanx for ur support, i'll tell u everything eventually, and to the one who actually will be able to interpret this mess of a message-thanx for talking stuff over w/me! and for any strangers that just happened to wander onto my blog, u may wanna read a few more to even close to grasp wut the heck i'm saying!

      wow, things in this world always seem so complicated, and frustrating...but then...u hit this moment, this moment in time when everything makes sense, and all the bad things go away, and ur satisfied, and u feel that u understand the world and the world understands u and everything will be ok someday, whether it turns out the way u want, the way u planned, or not! today was like that. ya, it had its ups and downs: the wheather sucked!! i had a test!! but in the long run...it was wonderful! and i can't tell u why, and i would never try to explain it to anyone...well maybe someone, but certainly not everyone, because no matter how well i explained it, no one, and i'm serious! no one, would get it, not my friends, most definately not my family, not my teachers, coaches, confidants, no one! so i won't explain....but i will say...today was a wonderful day! changedfish

"it felt like we were together" that's what u said to me. "when u said 'happy valentines day' it felt like we were together"...so....what's w/that, so....we're not, so u say we never will be? do u wanna feel like we r? ok, let's go...show up at my door, make me feel u care....or maybe it was valentines day...

        At the end of the nite, i'm always still me   i'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing.  it seems to be a good thing rite? most people think u shouldn't change yourself for others, that u should hold true to the way u r. and i have no problem w/that, i believe that...but what if i want to change, wut if i hate being predictable all the time. i mean, what if i never change, what if i'm like this forever? i no that sounds all dramatic, cuz everything always changes, but sometimes i just wonder is all, if i'll ever get over or grow out of this awkward stage in my life. i mean i'll be 16 in like 5 months, and if i'm going to be different i should start now, rite? somepeople change themselves to fit in, or to be like other people, to get something. but me, i want to change for me, i mean, ya i'm always changing, but it seems that at the end of the nite, i'll always still be just plain ol' me.  it's annoying, and it seems that wenever i do something unpredictable that i'm all proud of, or that i had fun with, that i get all this crap about it, it's just frustrating that i feel that i'm stuck w/this life i'm living, stuck in this body, stuck w/these friends, stuck w/this family, just plain stuck, and i don't want to be stuck! i want to be free, to make my own decisions, to do what i want (w/in reason) i want to make new friends but still keep the old, and i don't wanna feel bad for doing wut i no is rite, i don't, i don't, i just don't!!! it seems every entry i write is just this angry venting, but this is where i get all my feelings, all my emotions, all my thots out, where i can just say whatever i want and there's no one that can stop me, u can comment u can make fun, but u can't stop me!! hey if u wanna write me something feel free. email me at rubbadubdub16@hotmail.com and i'll read wutever u have to say, heck i'll even email u back! wutev, i'm having a strange nite lay off! changedfish

        Don't listen to people! they don't know any better than u do!   i've been thinking, that my friends don't really know any better than i do, i mean about life. it's like, y should i listen to what they think about MY life? wen they think that this means something, when they say that he likes me, or that he doesn't or that she is this or that, it's just like, how do they know any better than i do, if they haven't heard it direct from the horses mouth type thing. i dunno, i think i like the innocent way of living, they say ignorance is bliss, and sometimes that's tru and sometimes its not, but i think for the most part i'd like to be able to choose whether i want to know or not, i mean isn't that my choice? shouldn't i be able to say what i do or don't want to know? well sometimes people just tell u things, and it's like, "SHUT UP, stop thinking u know my life better than i do!"  i like to be independant.  i like to find things out for myself, i like to feel that i could survive w/o any other humans telling me things, and truth is i know i couldn't , truth is i can't live w/o people, but truth is i think i could.  anyhow, i dunno wut my deal is, catch ya late, changedfish

      funny how sisters go thro the same things at similar times, w/different people. i guess, i don't feel so much like this now as i did then...but sometimes, i still think about it, and this is what it's like: I'd like to say I'm done. I'd like to say im leaving; that i'm completly walking away. I wish I could say, im strong. I wish I could say we're through. I want to be able to say, im not giving in this time. I know the only thing I need to do is just walk away. I want to tell you that I wont let you hurt me anymore. That I'm moving on. That I'll find someone who wants me. But I can't. I'm not strong. When you snap your fingers I'll come running. I'll let you use me whenever you want. I'll pretend I don't care about all the other girls. I'll pretend that this is nothing to me, that I don't get hurt when you don't call. That I'm not hurt when you ignore me.  But it's okay, because this is my choice. I know that by hanging on like this, I'm choosing to let myself be hurt. I guess, "some things you don't leave until they leave you." -funny how sisters that r so different, are so alike...changedfish

      ugh! i don't even know wut to write, it's so weird, i mean i dunno, stuff happens, but its different now, i used to write down everything, and want everyone to read it, and i didn't mind if anyone on the face of the earth read it, cuz no matter how personal it was, it was still something i didn't mind sharing. now, it's not that anything special is happening, it's not as if a bunch of things r going on that i don't want people to know about, it just seems that lately the things that have happened, i don't want to put into writting, becuz then i will see them logically and for now, i'd just like to think about them.  somehow wen things happen in my head they're different than when i write them down on paper or type them on a screen, and sometimes i'd rather think about them, cuz they make sense in my head but wen i write them down, it doesn't seem like a big deal anymore, it seems insignificant all of a sudden, and i don't like that, sometimes i want to enjoy things before i exploit them, becuz sometimes it's not public knowledge yet and i dont wanna get caught saying something, if it doesn't go down.  so i guess im writting to say that i'm not going to write....get that? lol i dunno, goodnite all, changedfish

      "The Right Thing" u no, i don't think in every situation there is a "right thing" to do, maybe in some, but not in all! i mean sometimes ur between wut's right and wut makes u happy, or ur in between wut's bad and wut's worse, sometimes ur in between something great and something great and u just have to choose which great u want, and that's not easy!  some people handle the situation by just not choosing at all, they just don't make either decision, hoping to keep all the best of all the worlds to themselves...most of the time it blows up in they're faces, but sometimes they get lucky and win it all....other people choose too quickly, they don't give themselves a chance to think and often end up picking the wrong thing and screwing themselves over!  but wut annoys me is wen people know the obvious choice and they don't take it, or wen they choose the obviously wrong one!

      what happens wen u hit the standstill? strange idea i've found, i mean what comes next wen u've reached the point of comfort and ur still not comfortable? it's strange wen u know what u want, and u know ur options and yet it seems the decision still can't be made.  it's like what u want and what u do are so different they rn't even in the same catagory.  and then there's the topic of other people and what they want and what they need, u should think of others first, always, right? that's the way it seems but sometimes i wonder if those others think of others first, meaning do they think of me? i'm not sure, and somethings are things you can't talk about, somethings u wish u didn't have to say, that they'd just sort of be heard, be communicated thro wut's not said, but it doesn't happen that way, and sometimes u just have to accept that, be ok w/that and not worry about it, becuz it's ur own durn fault that u didn't say anything in the first place, i mean isn't that just blatent miscommunication? that's like purposful miscommunication and it's just mean to expect people to understand wut ur not even saying....but somehow u expect them to know, expect them to hear ur thots, ur wants, ur needs....sometimes i think things always turn out for the best anyhow, so y try and fix them urself....anyhow, i'z just thinking, changedfish

       The Power of Touch  u no, touch is a very powerful thing, it has the power to comfort, the power to express love, it has the powere to inflict pain, and to create fear, it has the power to weaken and the power to strengthen, it can be tender, it can be harsh. touch can be a blessing, it can be a curse, it can blow ur world to pieces, it can open new doors, it can express freedom, or it can imprison u in the dark. different types of touch create different reactions, hugs vs. hits i guess.......i'z just thinking i guess, changedfish

       one of a kind  u no that saying "ur one of a kind"? ya, uh, i never quite understood that. i mean it's like supposed to mean that ur all special and there's no one else like u, but in reality ur saying ur one of a kind, like there is a whole kind like u, and ur just one of them. i mean how backward is that, the saying definitely contradicts itself! or maybe that's just my interpretation, but still, i think it's strange...........Inquiry of the day: since when is awkwardness desirable???? ya, that's exactly my point!!! changedfish

      u no...life's soo weird, i mean, it changes soo much, not that that's bad neccasarily, just different...i think i like it! the only thing i'm worried about is that summer is comming, and i seem to be getting kinda distant from the friends i've had all year, and altho i seem to be making others and strengthening some and all, its just that i'm worried that come summer, no matter how busy i will be, i'll still not be in the circle of social plans, and that kinda bugs me, cuz it's like if u don't start out on the rotation, there's no hope in jumping in later...allow me to explain: if at the begining of the summer u hang out a lot w/ur friends and they make plans w/u and all, then they're thinking of u next time they wanna hang out, but if u rn't on their mind at the begining, then later it's like...hmmm...already made plans sorry! (not exactly, but u catch the fear) also, my friends r changing a lot! i mean, they've spread out, and there's kind of some conflict going on, and it's just like i wanna hang out w/some and then some others, and sometimes i don't know wut the other ones r thinking....and ya... "girls r drama!" but ya no, gotta love'em, cuz wut ya gonna do? zactly! muah, changedfish

      anyone else ever get tired of ur own thots? ok, so that's a wierd question-but i'm a weird girl, so i guess it doesn't matter.  wondering y i posed such a question? well, it's just that sometimes i get tired of thinking about certain things, like some things i don't really think r that important, and yet i can't get them out of my brain! there's just to much involved w/living ur life these days. too much to think about for me to stay afloat! it's not even just my friends, or just boys, (altho, that's the majority) it's everything, i mean i'll end up spending 20 mins. thinking about wut i'm going to eat for lunch, because there's to much to consider!  i've been told before that i over-analyze everything, and i know that's true, i say it all the time, i think too thouraghly! but wut's a girl to do? i mean, u can't change the way u think! nehoo, people r just weird, i don't wanna ever let anyone down, so i try to be superwoman all the time, and then wen i fail once, it seems that i fail a zillion times more after that before i finally get back to my superwoman act again. it's tiering! (can't spell again!) and people wonder y i nap so much, well geez, it's cuz i'm trying not to let u all down, i'm TRYING to give u all my attention, goodness sakes i'm trying soo hard to be perfect that i can't even think anymore! i'm being nice to this person, then that person, while trying to solve these problems over here and fix my own stuff ALL AT ONCE!! and i can't do it anymore! so if i screw up sometime, if i let'cha down ever-so-often, well...i'm sorry, but ur going to have to try and understand that i'm NOT actually superwoman, and i can't do it all!  wow, venting feels good! changedfish

      this week's been really weird, i dunno, it's like i haven't been hanging out w/my usual people, cuz of star testing and we haven't had normal days of school and all, but i dunno, it didn't really bother me, 'till today i was sorta hanging out, and i felt all detatched, like i didn't know wut was going on, and it's weird cuz i don't really hang out w/my friends anymore, cuz my friends r so scattered among groups, it's sort of if u get in w/one friend, ur missing out on others, but wen u try to split up ur time, ur still missing important stuff! geez, i dunno, i just get frustrated sometimes because i'll wanna hang out w/all my friends, and i realize that it ain't gonna happen! cuz some friends don't like others, and some friends friends don't like my other friends and goodness, it's not even sometimes that they don't like them, more that they just don't know them, but then it ends up that i end up not knowing people, and at times i feel that i'm missing out on things cuz i don't just settle w/one group of friends....then i think about doing that-settling i mean- but then i'd have to give up other groups, and i guess i do have a main group of friends and all, but still, seriously, i have a lotta different groups in which i spend my time, and none of them r perfect i no, but they don't mind me, and don't mind them....hmmmm...dilema dilema dilema (sure hope i spelled that rite!) changedfish

       bi-polar  i'm so bi-polar on these subjects....cuz now, now that i've absolutely killed every small chance of anything....now i'm second guessing myself, now i don't know anything all i know is that rite now, the only thing i want to do, is be w/u, i want to be there w/u, and i want to hug u and know that ur going to be ok, and i want to be there just lying next to u, feeling u breath, hearing your heart beat, and i want to tell u i'm sorry, and i want to cry on ur shoulder and i want u to tell me that i'm beautiful and that i've hurt u, and that ur angry but u forgive me, and i want...i want to look into ur eyes, that's all i want rite now....i just want to be in the same room as u, and i want to be there for u, and i want u to know how much i care about u, and i want u to know that if i'dve known i never woulda done it.....if i thot u cared, i wouldn't have left....and i know it's too late, and i know i got what i wanted, yet again, i've gotten wut i wanted and its not wut i want...i don't know wut i want anymore....i don't know anything anymore, all i know is that i'm the biggest screw up, not only did i hurt u once, but i've hurt u again, and u trusted me, u opened up to me, u finally let me in, and i destroyed u, and i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, and that's not good enuf, there isn't a stronger word than that, and it kills me, because that doesn't even begin to tell u anything...sorry? wuts that mean anyway...and i don't want u to think that i retracted my statement and i'm trying to erase it, cuz that can't be done, that whole thing is true, it is....i'm not going to lie to u, but it's not the way it comes out....i don't hate u all of a sudden, i don't want to throw it all away and flush it down the drain....i don't know what i want!!!! and i'm going to die here, not knowing wut i want, because i'm too stupid to think about things long enuf to see the errors in the plan.....u once said (referring to males) "we fail tests we don't even know we're taking" and i guess that's wut happened, i tested the waters enuf times, and i just got sick of not getting any feed back...so i did wut i thot was best, and i'm sorry if it didn't end up being...i don't truly know how i feel now, about u, about us, about any of it, all i know is that rite now, i feel...well, like shit and i'm not afraid to say the word! changedfish

Wooooaaaahhh Believe me. Wooooaaaahhh You're not alone.  I've been there before. Just where you are and not quite so sure that I did the right thing.  Believe me. And this world is cold so I'll make sure you're not alone. No you're not alone.  I know what you're thinkin'. Wooooaaaahhh I know how you're feelin'. Wooooaaaahhh Believe me. Wooooaaaahhh You're not alone.  Why don't you stay with me tonight.  Because I know everything is not alright. Why don't you stay with me tonight.  Because I know everything is not alright, and that's not alright.  I know what you're thinkin'. Wooooaaaahhh I know how you're feelin'. Wooooaaaahhh Believe me. Wooooaaaahhh You're not alone. Wooooaaaahhh  love for you always and forever, changedfish

      it rained today, in fact it's raining at this exact moment, rain just shows me how drained i am, b'cuz i'd love nothing more than to curl up in my bed and fall asleep, and even more than that i'd love to curl up in bed w/anyone but just me and fall asleep that way lol! i love hearing laci's stories in bio, she's just so cute and she seems to have cute moments that i wished belonged to me, but as i sit there wishing i had that, i draw a blank, it's like, i don't know what i want anymore, and i have too many possibilities and yet none at all, i wish people would wear signs that say, "available" and "not" and each person would be able to see the other persons sign, and if they were ur type and u were theirs it would say "available" and if u were incompatable it would say "not"! now wouldn't that make life SO much easier? i think it would! i think the world is out to get me these days and it's like no matter how many great things happen its as if i'm still stuck in my rain cloud....things go wrong in groups...it's true, one thing goes wrong and it all comes down on u...like the rain... you no how many things in my life metephore to or remind me of rain? so many, i mean i have inside jokes w/myself about rain....it's strange, but great, so if someone goes, "hey looks like rain" i just laugh, or cry as the case may be (excluding the fact that i don't cry, and hate to do so) then it's funny cuz i turn on the radio to get things off my mind and just sorta get numb for a moment and i hear "let the rain fall down..." so i quickly turn the nob and i hear "they all fall like a million raindrops falling from a blue sky..." and i start getting frustrated so i change it again and then it's "with grace like rain" and i'm starting to think it isn't funny anymore and i think i'll just turn to the oldies and i hit the end with "rain drops keep falling on my head, keep falling on my head...." finally i throw the entire sterio out the window and even then i can faintly hear "and the radio just keeps playin all these songs about rain...o it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain" and i slam the window shut run out of the house screaming and think...."things were easier when we still thot boys had cooties" changedfish

       old flames sure can be flattering, but that doesn't mean they're reasonable  it's just too bad tho, cuz i don't have any plans for next weekend, and he wants to hang out.   u prolly shoulda said "hey u dumped me remember?" but u didn't, u just laughed when he asked u. bcuz he is the goofy type, and u thot he WAS joking.  he assured u that he wasn't and that he hates that no one takes him seriously...so u told him u weren't busy, and if he wanted to hang out w/u then that was fine.  i know i shouldn't do this, i know he doesn't really like me, i mean there's no way. and HE broke it off w/ME remember, don't i know i shouldn't do these things to myself.  u didn't like him that much in the first place, and u too haven't talked in forever, (his wishes mainly) and now, all of a sudden ur all flighty and u wanna talk to him, hang out w/him....u NO this will be stupid of u, u NO u didn't really embrace the two of u in the first place, and now it'd be even worse, and people will think ur so totally stupid it's not even funny....but..(DO U ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE A BUT??) *yes* but...ur not busy, and he asked....so ur gonna go for it...changedfish

       a lil' confidence is all it takes!  a bit of sisterly advice i thot i'd share w/y'all.  "he only thinks he's better than you because you do" that's the way it is.  if  u  think he's the greatest thing on earth, if u don't think ur worthy of him, then that's the way the relationship is going to be! if u don't act his equal, if u don't take the upper hand, then u might as well be submissive, cuz u've given him permission to be cocky! i think it's often hard for those of us who weren't the beautiful, popular ones early on, to have a load of confidence.  it's the ugly-duckling syndrome, u just never feel that ur not ugly anymore...i don't know how to describe it to those of you that were born amazing and everyone always liked you, i'm not saying u didn't have ur own entire set of troubles, i think that's equally difficult, but at least now, ur willing to take the upper hand on things, and u dont take peoples crap just cuz u think u deserve it. another disadvantage to not having confidence, is paranoia. i no that sounds weird, so maybe it's just me, but i always feel like people r making fun of me, or that i'm the stupid one, that i'm the lame one, or the fat one, or the ugly one, and everyone around me is just watching me screw up. i don't know why all of a sudden i'm writting about my low self-esteem so often, cuz i think i used to have a lot of confidence....it's just...don't worry about it, i'm done....changedfish

       Flirting or Feelings??  you know, i like to flirt...a lot. and sometimes i wonder and worry if those i flirt with know that that's all it is, flirting, or do they think it's more, do they think that i have feelings for them? i've noticed that usually i don't flirt w/those i like...i dunno y it is, it's just my way of doing things, and recently i've decided that's stupid and i should be able to flirt with those boys and if they don't feel the same way then wutever, it's not a huge deal cuz summer's comming and i'm not going anywhere w/things at this moment...i don't think...also, sometimes i wonder if I read things wrong, i mean wut if i think some guy likes me more than just harmless flirting, and he DOESN'T? then wut am i thinking? i'm gonna look stupid! (but i always do, so it's ok) there are certain times and places for flirting.  i think school is actually an acceptable place, and home is an alright place, out on the town, that's fine...church-off limits! don't be stupid!  some people tho, can't turn it off! and that's not good, i mean i flirt a lot, but only when it's appropriate, and i've noticed in some classes i flirt a lot and in others not at all....it's weird but i was just thinking about it, so u've now been enlightened  i need some music!!! changedfish

       The longer you live the more confusing life gets!  ok, so it seems that the farther along in life i go, the more complex my problems are, i mean, don't u remember how simple things used to be when the reasons you cried were because you couldn't reach the counter! THOSE WERE THE DAYS! i mean, sure life's hard for you at every level, but ur problems rn't catastrophic to your well-being! nehow, i always seem to talk about my horrendous problems (like my spelling problem for instance!) but truthfully life's not that bad. i mean, sure my rents wanna send me in for counseling (turns out i'm "hostile" toward people! who knew?) and my friends r ultra-gossipy and turning on eachother (and me!) ok, and so no guy that i've come in contact with (with the exception of crazy jr. d and those that live hours away) want anything romantically to do w/me, o ya, and i did i mention i have a low self-esteem? wutev...besides all that! i'm fine, things rn't horrible, i have a family, i have friends, i mean, i'm living and living well! so y am i always complaining?  i blame things on everyone,but me! and i really should realize that i screw myself over sooo much more! i mean, i don't do anything good for myself, everything i do, is generally wrong, and i mess up more times a day (at everything) than i can count! but that's just me, and i've learned to except me, and i've learned to let it go! this year's been a really "growing" year for me, i've found out a lot of things about myself and about others, and about me and others lol! but really i've learned so much it's great! but it seems to me that the more i know the less i want to remember, i'd rather be naive and as bad as that sounds it's true...the ol' youth group joke about my gullablness, is "she's not gullable! just trusting!" and it's true, i have a ton of trust for people! and for everything in life, i just generally feel that things will work out and people r good inside and out and they rn't out to get me, but lately i've been feeling really mad all the time, and i don't like it! i've been gossiping and i've been insulting people (not to their face, but still...) i mean, i didn't use to be like this, and it's not as if all of it's bad even! i mean lace'll always be proud of her hand in my corruption, and i don't mind that they've ceased to call me "good little christian girl" but in a way i feel that i've strayed from my standards and that's not good!  i don't know i don't know i don't know!  (i say that WAY too much!) if i knew i'd tell you, i'd tell all of you, i'd share it with the world and beyond, but i DON'T know, and i may never know anything, while also knowing everything (it's a complicated emotion!) anyhow.....i'm just GRRRRR!!! with life right now, mainly cuz i don't have anyone to vent to, because venting requires sharing y i'm venting, and there's so many things! i just can't get it all in, and i don't like to talk badly about things and people, so it doesn't work, and that's y i'm typing a zillion words a minute trying to get my point across when i dont' even know wut it is!! I'M LOSING MY MIND!! wutev, i gotta go make a phone call, peace, love, word, wutev, changedfish  p.s. finding nemo ey? i know nemo! don't worry about it i'm ov (that's my lil' insider story for the day!)

      you know the saying "history repeats itself"? uh...i've come to find that it is most definately a true statement! i mean, this year, the past bunch of months, has been so round in circles....and i told myself i wouldn't do it again so many times, and this time i burned the bridges, i really did, i made it so i couldn't go back and no one could come get me, i made it so no one would want to come after me... i was finally thinking that i was ok, finally things had resumed a normalcy about them...i even wrote a poem about it(and i don't write poems hehe) it was just, even tho i wasn't really happy, i figured i was better off, and then all of a sudden it rushes back at me! y does it do that? y can't things just keep going, y do i have to look back??? i should've been a pillar of salt a LONG time ago (bible story, sodom and gomarrah)  it all started (well, the begining via writting anyhow) on  november 26th , when i thot i had a chance at getting a semi-formal date, but i'd screwed it up.  by  november 29th  i was talking about my love for spontenaity (can't spell!)  then  december 1st  i felt as if i'd screwed things up by saying something in the first place   december 2nd  i "wish i didn't know now wut i didn't know then" crazy!   december 7  i realize i see myself differently than others do   december 15th  i'm happy and cheery about it all on  december 22nd  i realize that "i am jello" and i can't make a decision about this thing. On  December 26th  i basically said "when it's over it's over" then on  january 31st  i basically said i could have had what i wanted, why did i screw things up? then  February 1st  i said i'll stick around even though i should leave THEN on  valentines day  i said i want to be together  february 24, 28, 29  i was all peachy, i was happy about it! by  march 8th  i thot i'd hit "the standstill"  march 13th  i was talking about the right thing not being what i wanted  april 5th  i ended it all  april 6th  i wanted it back  april 17th  i said i knew it was the right thing to end it  April 20th  i was thinking about february 1st!!  i haven't written about that thing since, i was writting about friends, about new guys, about anything and everything BUT that! and now...here i am again...what am i doing? does he realize wut i've done to him, doesn't he see he should forget he ever knew me? but i don't want him to....so, summers comming, i guess i'll see...changedfish

       venting is healthy  i've realized this!  when you hold everything inside and don't vent about things u tend to get into this mood, this mood where at any moment you could blow because you never told anyone that anything was bothering you and then someone hits the wrong button and it's like crazy destruction!  course, you should choose who you vent to, cuz if u vent to the same person too many times they mite start thinking that all you do is whine and vent.  parents often work, but then there's the factor of what your talking about, because if it's something you weren't supposed to be doing, well they're gonna getcha in trouble.  then there is ur friends, but sometimes venting sounds like gossip or whinning and you don't want them thinking poorly of you either! so that's y i have a journal, if u notice a lot of my entries are my venting! here it's like who cares? if anyone reads it it's because they wanted to, and they can just deal w/wut i wrote, and if you don't read it, well then u wouldn't know what was in it anyhow wouldja? nope, wouldn't.   still (back to my point) venting, really is healthy, if anyone ever needs to vent, i love to vent, vent to me, i'll vent back, it'll be a party!! and if u want to vent to no one, open a blog or any journal, it helps to get things out, it doesn't even have to be a public journal, it can be strictly for you!!! anyhow, if u wanna vent rubbadubdub16@hotmail.com and i'd love to vent w/u!! changedfish

(the best!) lol  this next week i'm headed to proberta, (i think that's how u spell it) california. i'm going there w/my high school group from church to sort of revive a church that has been shut down for years! i think it'll be soo much fun, we're setting up a vacation bible school for the kids and cleaning things up around the church, painting and such. i can't wait! wish me luck and email me while i'm gone! i plan on making big get-together plans for the 4th of july so if anyone has any lol let me know, otherwise u CAN see them from my yard so...we'll see! my email happens to be rubbadubdub16@hotmail.com so if u wanna drop me a line that'd be great! and it's only 34 days 'till sweet sixteen!!!! changedfish it up!!!

      want vs. do desire vs. action  ever wonder why its so much harder to do something than to think about doing it? i mean, your just sitting there, nothing else to do, and u know wut u should do, and you want to do it...but you don't....Y NOT??  i went to waterski camp this weekend...ironic really, because we don't waterski, mainly we wakeboard, innertube, sunbathe, and just generally be on the water...but that's not even half of the fun because there are so many awesome people there that u can't help but be engulfed in some amazing conversation with someone you love! (and i'm not talking romance, i'm talking deep love that you don't find many places) and if ur not talking to someone great you're getting fed God's word down the throat by pat, and he's just great too! i mean, i can't think of very many places i'd rather be...ur sleeping on the ground, so sore you can barely walk, dirty all day and nite....SO MUCH FUN! lol the only thing was i kept thinking about how poor my faith has been lately...it seems i keep spiraling downwards more and more...it's not that i'm doing anything horrible it's just i haven't been diving into the word much and it's like, eventually you start to loose touch and u realize ur trying to find ur own answers and ur not looking to God to help you out...THATS where i go wrong, i'm totally selfish, i'm always looking for the answers w/in myself instead of asking God, and seriously, it's been months since i just sat down and read....that makes me so mad, and yet, i'll sit here on this computer for hours, not getting up and just doing it...i could so easily, it's right there... but i figure, there's always time to start...and rite now, i did... the Lord worx in misterious ways he does, it's like the second you go to find something, he shows it to you, right there, clear as day, exactly what you needed...thank you God!! changedfish

       tell me i'm wrong  tell me it wasn't there, tell me i didn't see it, tell me it's not urs, tell me it's old, that u don't use it, tell me that there, hidden in that drawer is a closed piece of history that means nothing and u just forgot to throw away. i went innocently looking for wax, cuz the ortho thot it'd be funny to wire me up. and i checked ur room, yea, i no, privacy, but i was looking for wax! and i checked ur drawer, i no, wait till u get home, then check it, but i didn't want to wait up, it was already late.  it used to hold markers, it used to be fine, it used to have books and magazines in there, now all i see is this big plastic bottle, and i kick myself for hoping that momma was right wen she said that pill box by the computer was the grandparents, i know there are things that i don't know about and i'm glad that u shelter me from many things, but this, this pissed me off, cuz i thot we were done with that crap!  so tell me i'm wrong, tell me it's not as it seems, tell me i'm blind and i didn't see it that it's not urs, that it's old and forgotten, tell me that drawer is full of things u don't need, but tell me the truth, cuz that's what i want from you, not a cover up, not a lie, cuz that isn't right, i'm ur favorite sister and i'm all that u've got, so don't lie to me....just tell me i'm wrong..changedfish

       Postal Service  (getting into this band) Last week i had the strangest dream Where everything was exactly how it seemed Where there never any mystery on who shot john f kennedy It was just a man with something to prove Slightly bored and severely confused He steadied his rifle with his target in the center And became famous on that day in november  Dont wake me i plan on sleeping...  And then last night i had that strange dream Where everything was exactly how it seemed Where concerns about the world getting warmer The people thought they were just being rewarded For treating others as they like to be treated For obeying stop signs and curing diseases  changedfish For mailing letters with the address of the sender Now we can swim any day in november  Dont wake me i plan on sleeping...  (now we can swim any day in november)

      man, i knew the world wasn't a fair place, but man, sometimes it can be annoying! as u may notice the timestamp says its like 2 in the morning...y am i not sleeping? because people think it's funny to try and talk about important subjects randomly at late hours and then say things like "brb don't leave i want to continue this" my goodness, dear God i want to go to bed! lol i no it's kind of inconsiderate to be mad that people want to talk but...i'm cranky and he can not expect me to be happy-go-lucky about talking too long this late at nite about things i actually have to think about...sorry to vent all the time but life needs to be vented! grrr! i'm sooo tired, and the shade is making noises, and i'm running outta juice! lol ugh...changedfish

      don't u sometimes wish you possessed a skill? well, i don't mean a trained skill like a job u went to school for...but more of an ability. i'm not saying i don't have any abilities, but i think i'd like ones that are actually good ones, not like being able to talk for long periods of time about absolutely nothing, or how to stay online and occupy urself for hours, i mean like singing, or being able to write poetry...or dancing, or painting, i mean, i'm not saying u have to be an artist in order to be skilled but..well wouldn't it be nice to be naturally good at something? theory:maybe wut i'm good at i just haven't tried or done yet. i'm figuring i've just gotta be good at something, and maybe i'm just trying the wrong thing, i mean sports=no, dancing=no, art=hell no...but maybe i'm good at something else (and if u say being loud, u die) wutev-the constant ramblings of an unfullfilled life-changedfish

      i don't know wut to say to u all today (hey, i'm rhyming--that can't be a good sign) but seriously...first day of summer, came and went, it was fun, don't think i didn't wait in line w/my pals to see the very first showing of harry potter *cuz i did* i spent some time outside working on my "base tan" just to kick off my summer took a nap...babysat lol, it was a great day..and now i'm just sitting here replaying it thinking about some stuff i thot i'd share (as usual, i have way too much to say) ok, well, u no how when u don't know someone that well, or at least not as well as some of the people ur with, and u really want to impress them, just cuz u feel they r higher on the totem pole. ever notice that u over-apologize WAY more for ur natural quirks? ok, well i no a lot of the time it IS just me, but i'm telling u on this one there's just gotta be more than just me that thinks about this stuff. i've been known to over-apologize for most things, mainly cuz i'm trying so desperately not to offend anyone, i try so hard to get people to enjoy being around me that i often go over-board, i mean it's like that annoying senario when some guy just flinches horribly like u were just about to hit him because he cracked a joke. that's wut i do, only instead of physically cowering, i start talking, and i start apologizing profusely like i've definately offended someone, or like they're completely disgusted and boy am i in trouble. i dunno if this makes any sense, whatev i write always seems so crystal clear in my head and then on screen it seems so....blah..i'm told i explain pretty thourally but i'm not so sure..wutev, changedfish

      sheesh, haven't written in a day or more...i dunno what to do w/myself lol lotta things going on and somehow i can't think of what order they go in, like i dunno how to write down what's important, cuz sometimes what's on ur mind isn't always what is important and then people start thinking it is and ya.... i guess i care too much about what others think, i mean to a certain extent&nbsp;i think of it as a good thing, like if i care what they think it's a sort of an accountablity bit...but then there's many times when i care too much and it's not fun! i mean sometimes i wanna wear what i wanna wear, and i wanna say what i wanna say, and i wanna hang out w/who i wanna hang out with and i don't want others butting into it and being like "now melanie, r u sure about what ur doing?" i'm like YES! i wouldn't do it if it were detrimental to my well being, but i have a thing about me where i dont wanna make any waves and i want everyone to be happy and stuff and i spend too much time accomidating, and then if i fix one thing it blows up another thing and that whole ripple effect business becomes very real. hehe funny i noticed something within the past couple months, that i talked about today w/a friend..i'm really apologetic, and it's almost a bad thing i mean i make people feel guitly cuz i'm always apologizing...but it's just i want to come across as the nice person i'm trying to be...and i dunno i don't wanna make anyone mad at me, so i say sorry a lot luckily my life has died down this week, no phone calls, very few emails or love confessions lol, not any name calling as of yet, and camp is right around the corner so what could be bad about that? nothing! i hope! (knocking on wood at this moment) i think the thing i like most about camp is that my regular lifestyle isnt there, and the normal people rn't there and i can escape the drama of life! and when i come back it'll be my b-day and i'll getta take my driving test and hopefully (fingers crossed) i'll pass and be a lisenced driver!! goodness...i need to stop rethinking things, i mean i think about what has been a bitta too much! like it seems my brain has some sorta trigger button for the past, that someone says something or whatever and i think about old things, things that never were, things that were, wutev, i think...and most of the time it's ok, in fact most of the time i think it's a good thing--for a while, as long as i can get the thot thro in regulation time and not be thinking about it for days (which rarely ever happens, i mean the getting it thro thing) i dunno, it's like u go thro life and there r little stops along the way that made you who you are and i like to revisit them but sometimes i feel guilty like i'm not supposed to go back to yesterday and i'm supposed to focus on tomorrow, and i'm a better back-peddler...i mean it's not like i'm going to try and retrace my steps or i'm going to try to make the past the future it's just, i think...i think a lot, and i'm thinking i'm not the only one that thinks fondly of their olden days, i mean u can't convince me that i'm the only person that ever looked over her shoulder! i dunno..i made a neato shirt today, it says "RHINO MINO" i'm soo psyched to wear it, i got a buncha stuff to make other ones too! so hopefully i'll neva have to go shopping...eva! lol cuz i hate shoppping! long post makes for good reads, the bubbles stopped blowing, the fish must be tired, changedfish!

       awww! not-ah!   people think i'm genuine! i mean, they have a right to think so, i am, i'm not faking anything! i just mean, i never heard it much before, but i guess someone was talking to my mom at camp about it, and then my mom was giving me this whole speach (or speech, who knows which one) about how much better life will be if i stay true to myself and am real and genuine and all, and it was like i couldn't help feeling like i wasn't worthy of her praise and adoration cuz it's not really something i try for. i mean i'm not trying to down-play it, like it's not important, i think it's the best thing going for me now, and i'm not trying to brag ither, that wasn't my intention, it's just that i didn't know people saw me that way, and it makes me nervous that someone i don't know all that well thinks so highly of me.&nbsp; i don't like that, i mean high expectations just make me more apt to failure.&nbsp; and it's not something i can really stick to or anything because i didn't realize i was doing it, or know how i do it or whateva. i mean i guess i'm just me...but i didn't really realize that that was a good or special thing i mean, isn't everyone themselves? i dunno, i guess it's all part of the God loving person i am, but somehow it still makes me nervous! changedfish

       camp drama  welp, i sure had fun! it was just as wonderful as i'd hoped! i was excited to see all&nbsp; my camp friends (and i'll getta see'em in like a week for high school camp!!) i'm starting to become better friends w/my youth group crowd and i'm psyched about it, i just hope it carries over into the school year, cuz often times i get all busy and i loose touch :-(  altho i realized something at camp, i'm kind of an advice hypocrit, i'm HORRIBLE at following my own advice. actually i'm not sure if that's really it, it's more that i've been through a similar experience as the person and i'll tell'em wut they should do, but it wasn't wut i did, and i know i shoulda done wut i'm telling them to do (which is y i'm telling them to do it) but i neva seem to get around to the part where i tell them that i acted just like they did, and i think this would be a better course of action, but it's ok to make mistakes along the way.&nbsp; i mean, i don't MEAN to and i don't even realize i'm doing it, it's just that it seems when i'm talking to my friends about stuff it seems so easy to see the solution and i forget how hard it was when it happened to me, or i don't realize that it's not so easy to see the answer when ur stuck in the problem....i dunno, i guess life just gets buggy as u get older and u have to have good friends to help you out, therefore u should be that good friend to other people....and i try, soo hard, i really do, but i seem to miss the mark a lot. if ur sitting there scratching ur head going "y the heck am i still reading this?" u have to understand that most of the time i just write to release, and if i don't explain things well or if&nbsp;i don't make sense, if it's boring or confusing or wuteva, it's just cuz i'm working things out in my head as i go along, and i'm horrible at editing lol, and u'll just have to deal w/it! much love, changedfish

       family camp, family camp, family camp  (sing to the tune of the "laci's home" song lol) well, this weekend i'm off to the hills, the hills of shingletown that is! it should be fun, i'm totally psyched!  when most people think of family camp they're thinking "how lame" "that's stupid" and similar things, and believe me, i'da thot the same things except i've been to mt. meadow's camp since the 4th grade and it is the bomb diggidy (i know, gotta love the old sayings) ok, so it's not zactly my whole family going, and we won't hang out most of the time, but i love it. i'm soo excited to hang out w/my friends that have been up there all summer, cuz i miss'em, they're awesome people! and it'll get me all prepared for high school camp in two weeks!!! gosh i'm excited!! (couldn't tell couldja lol) besides its an excuse to get away from town and to be off away from phones ringing and emails and people and classes, it's like a crazy get-away place, where u can just be w/families, and be close to God and just ahh (breath a sigh of relief)  so anyhow that's where i'm going this weekend, feel free to email me and such but i won't get back to you till sunday evening! much love, changedfish

       it's an epidemic!   i've decided it was a good thing to allow others to read my journal.&nbsp; a good thing for me, a good thing for them, just a good thing. cuz see when i started this thing i wasn't gonna let anyone read it..but now it's like i don't mind, i love that people can read my thots, they can see inside my head and welp, i like that, cuz i have trouble w/feelings w/emotions w/explaining myself, esp. to people, i mean i can understand myself pretty well now-a-days but explaining my actions my feelings myself, now that i can only do through writting, and it's like when i'm typing i'm not even thinking 2 seconds ahead of what i'm doing, i'm just thinking, only through type...i dunno but it's the greatest feeling, well..not the greatest, but that's a whole 'nother thing...  life just gets complicated as u grow older, i mean things weren't supposed to get hard on me! i was supposed to stay 5 forever!...i don't mind i guess, life's just frustrating, i mean geez, it's like if i could stay the pudgy girl forever, i almost think i would, because growing up in todays society just sickens me, i mean guys can't control themselves! there was some creep hanging around my classes this past week, and buggin the girls in my class....luckily i wasn't there with them i didn't have to experience it, but seriously, i joke about wanting to be a guy, esp. cuz my youth group guys have so much fun...but sometimes i just wish i wasn't a girl, cuz it pisses me off to be thot of as some piece of ass (yes i said ass...twice..lol) i dunno why it bothered me so much it's just like, i wanted to ride my bike to my classes and i wanted to take my classes in peace w/o some strange wacko screwing it up.....i dunno, i think more than me being mad at him, i'm just mad that there doesn't seem to be anything i can do! wut i want to do is go up to the guy and just lay it out and tell him about God i mean wouldn't that be a happy ending? wouldn't that work out? but i'm soo afraid, i'm afraid to excersize my faith! it's horrible! i guess God's got other plans for me than persuing some psycho that hangs around the college campus (who's now banned from said campus but...)....changedfish signs off for relief

       update, update, get'chur update!  ok, today i was talking w/a friend about her ex, and how she feels he's like haunting her because everywhere she goes, there he is, or everything was reminding her of him etc. (and i got that) then i realized...i'm being haunted! guess who called again today (twice!) 4th of july boy (that's my new pet name lol) i mean, he's awesome, great, wonderful, and nice....but not for me! stop calling me! he even called me on his cell from work! i didn't know the number, so i innocently answer...eeek! i feel bad being SO mean sounding but i've never had someone call like this w/o ever talking to me, so we talked for like 3 mins. about nothing really, and then he had to go...i feel worst about him never getting me and him calling all the time, because i know how much it takes to actually get the nerve to call someone like that, but still...he's got too much nerve! and i don't like being negative about him, cuz i don't know him well enuf to bash him on any level, it's just that when he keeps popping up everywhere i get creeped out and i wonder what the deal is! i wonder if this is a purposeful thing that i should be answering the phone (which really creepily just rang--and it was him!!)

      ugh, i'm just so distracted right now, and it's not funny, cuz i have history homework to do, and i need a nap if i'm going to babysit tonite and geez, give me a break! ok, so i don't see the kid for a year, then one nite there he is, and now he's everywhere! (ok, so i've "seen" him once since then *today) but he's called a bunch, left a message yesterday, then today i see him...just so happens he works at one of my favorite stores so there's no way to just not go there (hello, stay away from target? not happening! lol) so now i'm feeling guilty, as if it's for some reason and i'm avoiding it or wutever..but i don't know what that is! i say i don't like the kid...cuz i don't know him, maybe i'm SUPPOSED to get to know him or something, but this is not wut i need rite now! i need some time to relax and get myself together, i mean it's summer, and i choose NOT to have summer romance, ESPECIALLY not w/him! i mean, i hear he likes some other chick so i'm not worried, but then somehow i am worried cuz wut if he doesn't "get the hint" and cease to call...and then wut if i keep seeing him around, i can't act like i don't see him forever! i can't act like nothing happened forever! i can't be like...well, he prolly forgot! as you can see this is distracting my thots quite greatly, and all i wanted to do was write a summary on the colony at roanoke!! so my thots r out, the jury is as well...we'll see! changedfish

      i have many thots today, be prepared! lol first i've decided i don't think i like being kidded around with..i don't mean i don't like cracking jokes (it's practically my life) i guess i just don't like being bombarded with remarks (funny or not) without a chance to explain... you know that feeling when people are joking about u and u feel that u can't defend urself? like there are more of them and they don't understand! well that's kinda how i feel sometimes...like i don't even mind if people laugh at me i think it's funny most of the time! i LOVE jokes and making fun of me and stuff...the part i don't like is a group of people and i'm the butt of the joke and i have NO chance of them listening to the truth of the matter...it happens a lot to me lately! ugh...but it's not that bad, i can live w/it cuz i know they only give me a hard time cuz they love me ... rite??  also, it seems that often when i've been talking to my friends lately we talk about marriage, or boyfriends, or wutever, and we talk about all the things that we are gonna have when we're married or the kinds of boyfriends we'd like to have....and every-so-often i get a fear, creeping up in the back of my mind, crawling up my neck...what if these things don't happen to me? now don't start thinking i'm having some kind of pity party, cuz somewhere deep inside i know God has the perfect guy for me and i'm sure i'll end up married to some goofball that loves me more than i can ever even imagine...however the thots r still there...it's like when paul (my youth pastor) was talking on wednesday about how the worst feeling is the feeling that God's not going to be there for u and help you out...David trusted God..y can't i? i'm soo weak sometimes! it's just, the world revolves around love and lust and being together and all that biznass and sometimes u just want it soo bad that u can't even see the real picture in front of you...i tell myself "don't date in high school" but then there's that huge lingering but at the end like "but if u find the right guy" or "but u could experience it" etc....but i don't WANT to deep down, i want to forget about guys all together for a few years, and when the time is right leap into it w/gusto (yes, i said gusto--twice) wutever wish me luck w/my suitors...changedfish

      o gosh...aight fillin' ya in on my big 4th plans. ok well there weren't any really, i mean my rents and i went to a independance day bash at a family friends house because thier view is betta than ours and they invited us and all that jazz...hookay so i'll let u in on a piece of myself, i like to be nice to everyone, it bothers me when people r mean or when people r inconsiderate etc. etc. etc. so when i notice people being not as friendly to a person i make sure that i AM friendly to them, this however always gets me in trouble! porque *because* when it is a gentleman i'm being kind to they take it as i like them and i'm flirting and all, and i'm not! it seems in group settings (i.e. parties) this happens to me a lot! nehoo back to the 4th...picture this we're sitting out back cuz that's where the worx r, and this guy i know (old friend of mine used to go to church w/me, haven't seen him since like last summer but he's nice and all) well he's sitting by himself on the porch swing, and i don't have a seat so i innocently sit next to him...PROBLEM, during the worx he decides it's his duty to bring me a little closer by putting his arm around me and sort of huggishly laying me down on his chest...now for those of you that think this is cute it IS, EXCEPT for the times when you don't like the guy and u don't know him real well and u feel that u can't tell him u don't like him or to let go cuz ur way to passive of a person, then it just becomes awkward and weird...not only did he take me under his wing but he decided not to let go even after the worx...so before no one noticed our present position and now everyone sees it and keeps looking at us like we're some cute couple and they can't figure it out and NEITHER CAN I! i don't know how to just get up and go inside, i'm TRYING not to make waves or reject him coldly, and EVENTUALLY (like 20 mins later after EVERYONE went inside) i go inside, later he leaves and i get the interrogation from ALL my friends there about wut was going on, to which i reply that i have no idea and that i don't like him and i wasn't TRYING to lead him on, i just didn't know wut to do....end of story, rite? NOT today as i'm getting ready to go meet some friends for their b-day movie he CALLS ME!!! fortunately i had told my mom the whole story and she helped cover for me by telling him i was in the shower and that i was going out in a little bit...he plans to call back! ugh, i don't know wut to do! i mean wut if he tries to ask me to go out somewhere, or to "hang out" i mean u can't really reject a guy like that...it's just mean, but i don't like him so then i can't go w/him either so...GRRR!! help me out guys, y do i attract these types of people?!?!? changedfish

      OMGSH!! i had soo much fun this week! a few of the highschoolers from my church went to proberta (by red bluff)and put on a vacation bible school for the kids there. you see the church there had some huge controversy and closed back in '94 so we went there to start it up again. we cleaned and painted and mowed and trimed and geez, did everything to the building so it would look like a church again, then we taught the children about God and such, finally we had an adult/kid service and invited them all to start attending church on sundays!  kids r crazy! i haven't been around that many low-income kids from a small town, for that long of a time period, and actually it was a BLAST! i mean, ok so all the little 11,12,13 yr old boys were asking for my phone number and staulking me as they obsessed about me being nice and such, then there was the clingy girl that kept grabbing my butt--awkward!! but pretty much it was amazing! when the kids WEREN'T there is when the fun truly began. we played soo many card games, i mean i could right a book no doubt and then there was the animal game---elephante, whoop, mooo, bwooop, racoon--- we had BURRO!! and we had pounce (or egyptian rat screw wutev) and UNO and everything, there was punch and CARBS! i could go into it forever, but the point of this entry is to say "branch out" seriously! do something you wouldn't normally do and do it for reasons other than yourself, do it cuz the Lord wants you to, do it because you never have but do it, cuz the rewards are sooo awesome and who knows if it could make an everlasting impact!!! these kids were a bored sad bunch, but all we had to do was shoot a few hoops w/them, listen to there rino-mino, king kong stories, and they were smiling, they wouldn't leave they loved us soo much...! children are fun and rewarding so get ur stuff together and branch out! help kids, be a good example, feed the hungary, read ur bible, i'm telling you, this stuff you call crap isnt' just for the church babies it's for us all and it has the best side effects!!! much love, changedfish

BUUUT...when i got home it was my b-day!! whoo hoo and i went to the DMV and got my liscense (well that little piece of paper thingy that u use until they mail the real one) and i had fun! the next day i had a party, which was awesome! i had soo much fun and i've realized that the Lord has blessed me more than i can ever imagine and i have the greatest friends in the whole world, and not everyone that i wished would've come, came, but it was awesome and i hope that everyone else had as much fun as i did...cuz it'd be a bummer if they all thot it was lame....nehoo after that (toldja it would be long) the fam and i packed up and left town to take one last vaca before my sister ships of to sac, and that was...interesting (we came home a bit early but...well we were done) we went camping in the santa cruz mountains and did some shopping and went to the beach and one night my some of my cuzins and aunt and grandpa came down for dinner so that was fun, o yea and did i mention my family is now experts on paint-by-number? wow, nother story, but ya, now i'm home and my summer's just starting cuz see i've been taking summer classes all summer and now they're over and i'm home and i DRIVE!!! and i'm looking for people to play with! wow this has been one of the best summers ever! i mean i thot last summer was awesome w/my missions trip and all, but this entire year has just been so wonderful! ----------------------end of first part of my journal thing------------------------------ now is the part about my thots and everything deep and meaningful so if u got thro all the chit chat of the "this is what i did" then u get to this part, which some say is the interesting part, but others don't so....ya summer's been just this time of reflection about this past year, and it's like i had soo much fun this year and so much happened and i'm worried about next year and that it won't be as good, or something and i dunno, it's just...i miss the way things were last year, i mean i can't even read my old blogs cuz i seemed soo happy, and it's like no matter how happy i am now it's not that bubbly, can't-keep-my-fingers-on-the-keys, just-gotta-scream, kind of excited and happy and then i decided that (like this song) I miss my friend The one my heart and soul confided in The one I felt the safest with The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again And let the light back in I miss my friend I miss those times I miss those nights I even miss the silly fights... and so the song goes...but THEN i decided that it's not really that that i want...i mean i don't want what i had, i just want my friend back ya no? i dunno it's weird, and then i think about camp and how they were talking about dating and waiting and i heard that barlow girl song about waiting and ya...it's just such a wonderful thing to think about doing, ya no, waiting for the right guy before jumping into a relationship, i think i'd like to be friends w/a lotta people, i LOVE friends, and they make me soo happy, and i don't need all the drama of life, i just wanna have some good, clean fun! cuz that'd be...fun! lol i love to blabber about stuff...i am really excited about school tho and it's comming way too soon, but it'll be fun to see people again and to get back into the rutine of things and i'm just all the way around excited but....well i was enjoying summer too, so....ya ...i dunno, wutev....i'm gonna stop rambling cuz i don't have anything else to say - changedfish
