             The Devil made it sweet    ***WARNING***   This is a Rant!   ***WARNING***   I don't really believe  the devil made sugar .  But I do believe that man is stupid enough to get addicted to it like any other drug.  In researching diet and exercise, what I discovered really surprised me.  I've always known I was addicted to sugar... but when I started "laying off the sweets" as they say, I found myself addicted to other stuff, namely bread, and bread products.  That being pasta, crackers, chips and especially... well.. bread.  What I didn't realize is the amount of sugar that is in bread.  And after further scrutiny, I discovered that sugar is in everything that comes in a package.  Discovering that, to me, was like being in a horror movie.  It's not bad enough the boogie man is in your closet, now he's everywhere you turn.    It turns out, that back in the 70's Oceanspray... the people that make cranberry juice(...mmm... cranberry juice) started putting  High-fructose corn-syrup   in their 100% natural juice.  Their profit margin went through the fucking roof.  Why?  Because the number one government subsidized cash-crop in America is... corn! They make the stuff and get paid to make the stuff.  On TOP of getting paid to SELL the stuff!  It's so cheap that thats almost exclusively what is farmed in a lot of places, because they can't lose money on it.  They of course sell it, but then it gets turned into corn-syrup and then... replaces sugar in almost all products.  Even most products that don't need it, because if a quarter of the materials used to make your product is nearly cost free, you'd be stupid not to use it.  So it's in EVERYTHING!!!    And that is what's making  EVERYONE  fat.  That's what did it to me, I guarantee it.  Well... that... and not exercising enough to combat the fat my body was producing.  The thing is, for me, there was no way of escaping it, especially since I didnt know what IT was.  I tried to follow the diets, they say eat low-fat.  Well, do you know how they get low-fat  low   fat?  They add SUGAR, so the low fat doesn't taste like cardboard.  I tried eating yogurts, and slim-fast and granola bars.  They've all got SUGAR in them.  No escape.  Try it some time.  Go to the grocery store and walk down each isle and just SEE if you can find a box of something that doesn't have  High-fructose corn-syrup  in it!  You can't.  It doesn't exist anymore.  And you can damn well believe it's the same in 99% of all fast food.  I'm not even going to try to talk about  cokes .  Anyways, I don't know the answer.  All I can tell you is what I've been doing.  I think cooking real food has been the real key to changing my lfe.  When you finally start to understand the cause of unhealthy eating, and the causes of your addictions, it's easier to start to change.  Look carefully at what you're eating, you may not have noticed that 99% of every packaged, processed and fast food is made with  High-fructose corn-syrup .  So now when I go to the grocery store, the only things I can get without that, are raw meats, raw fruits and vegetables and... well, that's it.  Nothing that comes in a box or a bag.  No hamburger helper, no frozen dinners and most of all... no eating out.  But that's not the end all, be all of this whole thing.  I think man is made to enjoy good foods, and sweets and stuff.  But it comes with moderation.  I'm trying to exercise more than the foods that I take in.  Which means, that at some point, when I hit my target weight, I can eat whatever I want as long as I keep exercising enough to counteract that.  But until I get to that weight, I have to take in considerably less and be much more careful with what I eat.  So it's mostly meats, raw vegetables, little bread and lots of water.  But thats me.  Sorry about the rant.  Not that anyones paying attention.     --Will

             What I've lost and what I've gained.   This is not a normal post.  This is mostly an update for myself about my workout and diet.  So it will prolly bore anyone else reading this to tears.  So skip on to the next days entry unless you're either trying to lose weight yourself, or you're interested in my weight loss or.. well.. you're  weird.   This is the last day of my first month of working out.  I figure this is a good opportunity to do a status check.  So far since I started lifting weights I've lost a total of ZERO pounds.  Zilch, nada.  It's a little discouraging, but I'll take it.  I started my diet about 4 months ago and in the first 3 months I lost about 20 pounds.  That all stopped the minute I started exercising.  But oh well.  The workout plan said the  first month there would not be a lot of change, because I'm actually replacing fat with muscle.  Month one is mostly about building a base of muscles to work with, building endurance and reinforcing the habit of working out.  Month two is all about shocking the muscles with heavier weights and building mass.      Overall I think I've done pretty good.  I've only skipped two workouts this month and both of those I made up the very next day.  I've also slowly started adding in aerobic/cardio workouts.  This week I actually went swimming 3 days instead of 2, and each of those were for 1 - 1 1/2 hours instead of the 45 min I started with earlier in the month.  I also went walking one day this week.  My sister and I are going to try swimming 5 days next week.  I think that will make a HUGE difference in everything.  But of course, this week was the first time that swimming actually felt like a workout.  It's taken me 3 weeks to get my breathing right while swimming.  So that now I can keep going with enough consistency to almost wear myself out.  Before, my muscles wouldn't even be sore or tired because I kept running out of breath before I got close enough.  I'm only noticing minute changes in my figure.  I think it was Tuesday, I could tell I was remarkably thinner, but by yesterday it seemed to all be back.  The definition in my arm muscles doesn't seemed to have improved much either since week one.  Measurement-wise though since Jan. 1, I've lost 2 inches off my stomach 1 inch off my chest and about 2 inches off my neck.  My arms and waist seem to be the same. My energy seems to be pretty much the same as before the work out.  I do feel a constant craving for more exercise though.  It's starting to get more addictive.  My diet has remained fairly consistent.  This week was a little rough because we couldn't get around to getting groceries for real meals.  But I didn't cheat (...Prolly because I didn't have any money to cheat with..hehe)  I think cooking real food has been the real key to all of this working.    I feel pretty confidant right now.  I have no doubt that I'll keep this up for the full 6 month plan.  And I'll probably keep going with it from there on out.  Everything seems to be getting easier the more that I do it.  And I can totally see myself doing cardio work-outs nearly every day in the near future.  That's where the magic is.  So Sunday is the start of Month two.  I hope to double all the results from this month.  Except the weight loss.. because you can't double zero.. or you can but it's still.. um.. zero.  Anyways...   --Will

             Bridge to Terabithia   I finished reading William Goldman's  ADVENTURES IN THE SCREEN TRADE  today.  It's a very informative book.  I find myself more and more leaning towards someday writing movie screen-plays.  And even though the books a little dated it's still very interesting.  Course, after all the horror-stories it seems he's been through, it's hard to understand why he's stuck with it for so long.  I guess when you love something like storytelling as much, you're willing to put up with just about anything.  After  ADVENTURES  I started into another William Goldman book  THE PRINCESS BRIDE .  Which is one of my all time favorite movies.  The book is very different from the movie but so far it's an awesome read.  I got about half way through that book tonight and decided to stop.  For some reason though, I picked up another book and read it completely tonight.   BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA  by Katherine Paterson.  I hadn't read this book since I was a child so I only remembered bits and pieces of it.  In fact I was about 10 when I read it.  But I do remember it having a huge emotional impact on my entire childhood.  I think it was the first time I'd ever cried over fictional characters.  The thing about this book, is that it came along at such a crucial point in my life.  It was the middle of 5th grade and probably the worst year of my life.  I had just moved to a new school and it was the middle of the year.  My teacher starts reading this book the week I get there.  But the story so closely resembled things going on in my life, and I remember these magical things that these two kids dreamed of, and I remember how powerful an affect that had on me.    A brief description of the story, It's about a boy, growing up on a farm as the only boy of his family with 2 younger sisters and 2 older sisters.  He ends up carrying a large part of the load for the family because the father is always at work.  A girl and her family move in next door and the girl quickly tries to become the boys friend.  She's a fascinating character, very independent, very smart and extremely creative and imaginative.  She reminds me very much of a girl in my class that I had a crush on at the same time that we were reading this book.  Anyways, she takes the boy on all of these magical pretend journeys and they find themselves constantly getting lost in this magical world that they've created in the creeks and forests behind their homes.  He learns to be more than he is, through her.  He learns really to live, through her.  If you've never read it, I can't recommend it highly enough.     The funny thing is that I think all of my love for storytelling... no,  need   for storytelling, is deeply rooted in this story.  Every story I've tried to write or create has some element of Terabithia in it.  And I find myself constantly battling to create that sort of emotion in my storytelling as well.  But I never realized it till I read it again tonight.  Strange how the brain works.  So I've got to get back to drawing now.  I should finish PRINCESS BRIDE tomorrow.  Then I'm going to try for Slaughterhouse 5.  I'm really enjoying reading now.   --Will

       Quench your thirst   I've never been much of a reader.  I'm not sure why.  I guess because I've always believed that I had a short attention span.  And in many ways I have...  wait, where was I going with this?  Oh yeah, reading.  I don't know what's going on, but lately I have been reading voraciously.  It started when I borrowed this book on  Personology, astrology and numerology   from a friend.  I guess it's been a while since I've read, but it was like I've been thirsty and that thirst was finally quenched.  It wasn't just the subject matter either.  Because in the week since then I've read 3 other books and I'm half way through a 600 page book on screen-writing.  AND I've got 2 other books waiting in the wings.  It was that event and also reading a  urlLink friends  website where she talks about reading 10 books in one sitting on a wide variety of subjects.    It may be me thinking that I had a short attention span was a self-fulfilling prophecy, or maybe I'm just growing into some new stage of my life.  I don't know what the case is.  And the strange thing, it's not really affecting anything else in my life, at least not in the way I expected.  I still have time for my work-outs and I still have time to draw.  But in a way, I actually feel more creative from reading now.  I think it's mostly just seeing the words and taking in information like that, more than the subject of what I'm reading.    Life is so strange, you live for years one way, then one day it's a whole new ball game.   --Will

       "..Who ARE you..?" said the caterpillar   So I borrowed this book from my friend Luis about  Personology, Astrology, and Numerology .  They basically take the Date and Month of your birth and break it down according to the sun, the moon, the planets and the stars (and of course the numbers related to that).  Reading it, I was aghast at how accurately it seemed to pin-point my personality.  I even read it aloud to Luis and he concurred, right down to the fact that everyone that shares my birthday is kind of an ass (I am after all a  Scorpio ).  But the most interesting part to me was where it listed the change points within my life.  It essentially says that before the age of 27 (which is everything up till this year) I am concerned with issues regarding my deep feelings and personal power.  Then at the age of 28 there is a turning point that highlights optimism and a growing need for freedom and expanding my horizons, whether through my philosophy of life, education or travel.    Normally I would write this all off as coincidence or vague mysticism.  Except for the fact that the 4 months before January I spent in deep introspection, soul-searching and self-criticism.  Do to the fact that I'd made so many efforts in my life to succeed and help others succeed and I kept running into the same problems over and over which were more times than not caused by my own damn self.  And the conclusion that I came to was that I needed to stay within myself, with only a few close friends, and go to school and travel.  And I was planning my 27th year completely around preparing for that.  It's eerie.  Of course it doesn't say when I'm going to get laid next. But hey...   --Will

             Excuses, Excuses, Excuses...   Being an artist is a constant battle.  It often seems like once you've conquered one front, another seam splits somewhere else.  Lately, I'm getting more drawing done.  But I'm still working about half as much as I could or should be.  That's usually a sign that I've got a bad case of the "excuses."  I've got all of this free-time for the next few weeks and I seem to be wasting most of it.  So it's time for me to break it down and figure out where all my time is going and why I'm not spending it drawing.  It's time to have a little talk with myself about my little excuses...        "I'm not in the mood to draw."       "I don't feel comfortable drawing at my drawing table.  I just sit there and the angle feels all wrong and the chair is uncomfortable and it's dark and too quiet and I get frustrated."       "I can't draw at home.  I just can't get comfortable sitting at my drawing table.  It's been that way ever since I moved the studio around and whenever I try to draw in bed I end up watching TV all night and don't get anything done."       "I can draw at Denny's but I don't have a lot of cash to buy coffee every night."       "I drew for 4 hours last night and I didn't get anything done."       "There's just so much work to do... and it's never really going to pay off anyways, so why should I keep doing it?"        "I'm not good enough."   Ok...  well, first; evidently I don't like drawing at home.  And I don't have money to go out to draw and I don't have a studio outside of the house anymore or friends that have studios that I can draw at.  So how do I fix this?  I could try moving the studio back to the way it was when I was able to produce.  With my computer MIA that wouldn't be too far of a stretch to get done.  So I'll try that.  When?  After I finish typing this.  Second, I've apparently got an insecurity thing going on.  I haven't had that one with my artwork in a while.  I think it's come from not having drawn consistently and intensely for nearly 4 months.  If you take a race-horse out of it's routine for 4 months, it's going to take it a while to get back to it's peak condition.  That causes insecurities about not being able to do something that came so naturally before.  So how do I fix it?  Stop thinking!  You have to get back into the routine and stick to it for at least a month before you'll start to see results.  It takes 20 days to form a habit.  So far you've been sprinting every other day.  And feeling insecure about not being able to work as easily as you once did.   Working like that is not forming habits, it's forming insecurity.   So what is the new routine?  Draw at least 4 hours a day, EVERY day.  Start at midnite, since that seems to be when you are primed to get something done, after the work-outs and after a little TV.  For those 4 hours you need to draw consistently.  Try to do more work than the day before.  After a month, you'll start getting your confidence back and start feeling like you're getting work done and feeling like challenging yourself to do more.  At that point you can start drawing during the day again, and hopefully by the next convention you'll plateau at your peak efficiency again.   Lastly, your productivity.  Other than forming routines to become more productive, you need to stay focused.  Keep working on the proposals and have a set list of things that need to get done for each proposal.  That way you can check them off as they get done, and you can visualize the progress as it's getting done.  So what is the check list?     3 proposals = 3 Pitch packets  1 pitch packet = Pitch letter, Story outlines, 10 character sketches, 5 pages of sequential artwork and 3 logo designs.  10 character sketches = Character bio + 4 small headshots and 1 full character shot  5 pages of sequential artwork = 5 penciled pages, tightly drawn   So that's it.  No more excuses.     --Will

                            Getting something off my chest.   So I just finished lifting weights.  This is the middle of week three.  I feel really good about my workouts. I can definitely tell that something is working.   I'm actually starting to see definition in my arms even when I'm NOT flexing.  That's awesome.  I haven't had that in a really long time.  Unfortunately it seems that I've gained 4 pounds since my last weigh-in on Saturday.  I guess I've been sneaking in too many snacks in between meals.  Oh well, I've got till Saturday to get it back off.  I know I was feeling a little depressed about the slow progress, and that led to me breaking down a couple times.  Nothing major, it was like 2 granola bars and an extra bowl of cereal during the week.  I've done much worst in the past.  I look at this experience though, not as a diet, but as changing my life.  I eat healthy about 90% of the time and the other 10 % I'm just trying to keep the damage to a minimum.  Like eating granola bars instead of chocolate bars.  And drinking Sprite instead of DrPepper.  But eventually I hope to cut even that amount down.    Even though I've been on a new eating plan for 3 months and a new workout plan for less than a month, I still feel like I'm only now getting started with all of this.  Somewhere around month 3 I plan to be lifting twice as much weight and running/walking, biking or swimming 5-6 days every week.  It kind of feeds into itself.  The more swimming I do, and the more weight lifting I do, the more I WANT to do.  It's like an addiction.  But once I get to that point where I'm going full throttle, the weight will start coming off a whole lot faster and I can relax a little with my eating.  I think that's why "Diets" seem to ALWAYS fail, it's because you're fighting your natural instincts.  Everyone has the ability to eat whatever they want, I don't think it has anything to do with Metabolism.  It's just that so many people remain stationary and don't exercise.  Or don't exercise enough for the amount that they eat.  I'm sure I have a long way to go though on this whole journey.  I've always known that it wouldn't be that hard once I figured it out... once I figured myself out.  I had to really look into myself, and record everything that I did for several months and break down "what I did" and "why I did it".  I discovered tons of conditions that caused me to overeat and binge and remain depressed and remain sedentary.  I discovered that I was eating unconsciously.  I often would eat a healthy meal and not feel satisfied because it didn't come from the store.  So I would have to walk to the 7-11 and buy a fried pie and a coke.  Then I'd eat it and get high.  In fact it almost all came down to me wanting to get high... on food.  Sometimes it was to keep me from thinking, sometimes it was to escape but most of the time it was just out of habit.  I can't count how many times I would go buy some junk and shoot up my veins with fruit filling then drive around high for a couple hours.    It makes me wonder what everyone else's life is like.  If someone were to sit down and just write down everything that they did that day and try to figure out why they did it.  I wonder if it turned out they had some sort of psychological dilemma of their own?  Anyways... I gotta go to bed.  I'm going swimming early tomorrow.   --Will

             It's Like Sugar for My Soul...   Conscious Living.  Appreciation of life. These are the goals that I work hard to achieve.  I used to live blind to the world.  Not fully experiencing the things that I took in.  To a great extent, that is how I came to be overweight.  I wasn't conscious or aware of my eating.  I was eating when I was hungry or nervous or sad or.. well whenever I had money to eat.  Not fully experiencing the things that I took in.  Now I live each day so that the next might be twice as good.  I plant dreams for myself so that as I follow this path I can watch them come to bloom.  I hide little notes to myself with one small thing that I envision myself doing after I've lost my weight, or started making a comfortable living drawing comics.  One is to travel to all the places I've lived in my life and take a new picture with every person that has ever loved me.  When you're overweight, those people that love you in spite of your condition are rare and far between.  But what a thrill it will be to fill a photo album with all these people and be smiling in every picture.  To be proud of myself in every picture.   I have many dreams such as this.  I write them down on sheets of paper and hide them among the rubble that I work through every day.  When I run across them again it's usually a very welcome and inspirational occasion.  I feel passionate that the day that these dreams will come to pass is coming soon.  It might be a year, maybe next summer.  But for once in a long time... the day is not getting further away.     --Will

             Beneath it all...   Losing weight is not an easy battle.  It seems like everyday I'm discovering something different about myself.  I'm realizing why I do what I do and how it's caused me to end up overweight.  One thing I discovered about myself today...I am on hiatus.  I think my whole LIFE has been on hiatus for about 10 years.  I mean, I was never super popular in high school, but I did have lots of friends and I could get girls.  Then in college, I slowly started putting things on hold and slowly gained more and more weight.  I find that I've done that with almost everything in my life.  Being conscious of my weight has hindered me in so many ways.  Often the people I interact with are the cause of it, but mostly I do it myself.  I've seen enough people look away from me suddenly, embarrassed of some foul thought.  I've witnessed enough conversations about sex and romance and bar-life, and all the scenes that I've never fit into because of my weight.  I don't attempt to date, because I don't want to fall in love like this.  I want to be proud of MYSELF before I fall in love again.  I can't even remember when that started, but it is most definitely the case.  I can't even remember the last time I was interested in a woman.  Can you imagine that?  Not even a remote possibility of romance?  00I think I somehow turned off that part of my brain... or maybe I've numbed it with food.  Whatever the case, now that I'm starting to lose weight, I find myself starting to think about love again.  I find myself opening up to the idea again.  I will still probably hold off until I get to a decent weight before I ask any women out though.  Past the point of no return, so to speak.  I want to have something to be proud of and be confident in myself about before I try to put myself out there again.  The harsh reality is that the woman I would love to be with, would probably not want to be with me in the state that I am.  I can't say I'd blame her.  Why would anyone want to settle when they don't have to?    I went through this period where I dated several women, despite the weight and my low self-esteem.  I said "fuck it" ...women want a man that's confident in himselves, no matter what he looks like.  So that's what I did.  But what I got was several women that really liked me, and said they loved being with me because I made them laugh and feel comfortable and feel better about themselves.  But they just weren't attracted to me.  It turned out I could only be confident in myself up to the point that I took my shirt off.  It burned, and so I stopped.  That was probably a couple years ago.    The same sort of thing has happened in my business as well.  I go to lots of trade shows and meet people and try to make a good impression.  I hate that when I talk to people I feel like I've already got 2 strikes against me.  Anyways...      --Will

       Dance With Me   I have a very active fantasy life.  It keeps me sane.  It keeps me from getting so depressed that I want to kill myself.  I was made to be in Love, and for much of my life I have been denied my purpose.  So fantasy, keeping the passion, romance and optimism alive within me is essential.  I think it takes this to stay alone and stay focused to work as much as I do.  The problem is, for nearly a year I was programming myself with these fantasies that I'd someday meet a beautiful woman to fall in love with, in some far off exotic city.  Like NewYork, San Diego,  L.A. or even Holland, because those are places I was wanting to go.  The thing is, although I ultimately plan to someday move to one of these places it's probably going to be a long time before I do.  Consequently, the universe has kept all possibilities of love and relationships from me.  Because that's what I was asking for.  This seemed to only add to my depression.  So the last few weeks, I've been dreaming about new things.  More attainable and believable things.  But still... they are fantasies.   I had a wonderful dream last night...   It starts about 8 months from now, the weather is still summer-like and nice out.  And all of my friends decide to take me out to celebrate, because I've finally reached my goal weight and they've somehow found out about it.  It's dramatically changed the dynamic between my friends and I.  It's evident in my confidence and the way they treat me.  We go to a bar in my town called  Bleacher's.   And my favorite local band " Plain Brown Wrapper " is playing.  It's a fun night.  There's drinking and celebration and sweet, sweet rejoicing.    One thing about me going out drinking.  I almost never get drunk.  I usually have a few beers and spend most of the night dancing.  It's always been that way, I love to dance.  Almost every time that I go out, I'll grab some poor unsuspecting woman, sitting alone, and pull her onto the dance floor ( with her permission and a somewhat bewildered yet curious look ).  Usually we're the only ones on the floor, in fact usually there ISN'T a dance floor.  We start to dance and have fun and after a couple of songs, we look around and realize that we're no longer alone.  Nearly everyone in the building is up and dancing too.  It happens this way every time, I guess because after watching us dance, people don't feel so awkward about being out there.  It's a magical feeling.    So on this particular night when I decide it's time to get up to dance.  I find myself wondering how things will be different now that I'm thin and feeling confident in my body.  I suspect that confidence in yourself and confidence in your body are two very different things.  But I have yet to experience the latter in my dating life.  As I state my purpose to the friends at the table and start to look around for a cute, young, rhythmical, victim.  One of my friends, a young kid, you know the kind... he's the pretty boy that every girl seems to faun over.  He dares me to ask out the most beautiful woman in the bar.  I figure, "What the Hell?"  It's time to try out my hard fought physique and test it's limits.  I ask if we all have to agree on what "most beautiful" is... but before I can finish my sentence I see her.  And so does every one else.  It's no contest.    There she sits, at a table on a deck just a few feet higher than ours, in the corner of the room.  She is surrounded by her friends.  All of whom would have been more than beautiful on their own... except they're sitting next to HER.  You see it's her smile that does it.  She laughs and smiles.  That makes her more beautiful than any pouting, primping debutante in this bar.  And her dark mysterious eyes... wow, in the glowing neon-lights they take on even more magical powers.  And when she laughs, even her eyes seem to smile with her.   I finish my beer and march over to her.  I'm so focused on the task at hand that I'm completely oblivious to the frat boy hanging around her shoulder.  She looks up almost startled at me, I pause for a moment to catch my breath and smile slyly and lower my gaze to intensify the eye-contact.  I smile a little wider and hold out my hand and ask her to dance.  She smiles in almost exactly the same way and takes my hand.  She doesn't look back.  As we make our way down towards the band I can here giggles and snickers from the girls at her table.  But it doesn't matter... because I have her hand in mine.     As we step in front of the band I see a concerned look on her face.  She asks me, "Are you sure this is a dance floor?"  I reply "Does it matter?"  She laughs and the band starts to play... it's Marvin Gaye..     "...How Sweet it IS to be LOVED by you..."                                   "...I want to STOP... and thank you baby...."   We dance light and playful.  She laughs louder and bigger.  I can tell she's enjoying it.  I twirl her and swirl her into my arms.  All eyes are on us.  But neither of us notices.  We dance like nobody is watching.     "...I needed the shelter.. of someone's arms... and there you were..."                       "...How sweet it IS to be LOVED by you..."   She closes her eyes and leans in closer.  I can feel her heart racing against my chest.  We dance like we're part of each other.  The motions are peaceful and happy.  The music plays and plays and I hope that the moment will never end... But then it does.  She smiles and her eyes sparkle.  She looks around and we realize that there's almost no one sitting down.  The entire room is dancing.  She looks back at me and laughs out loud.  Nothing needs to be said.  She feels the magic too.  I ask if she'd like another dance.  She smiles and says softly "Yes, of course."  Suddenly the music starts.  It's three unforgetable notes, moaning, leading into a crecendo... it's Marvin Gaye again...    "I've been REALLY trying.. Tryna hold back this FEELING.. For So long.."                                                 "Lets get it on."   She leans in to whisper in my ear.  "You any good at slow dancing?"  I lean in to to whisper to her. "Not at all."  She laughs with her whole body.  It makes me smile.  I love a woman that loves to laugh.  At first, she has her arms together on my chest, almost to keep me from getting too close.  Then I can see her mind thinking, questioning and finally... letting go.  She wraps her arms around me completely.  She holds me tightly and I can feel her energy flowing into me.  I squeeze her tight, I hug her with the strength that says I can never let go if you want me to.  We stay that way and she lays her head onto my shoulder and I can feel her body relax.      "...Theres NOTHING wrong.. with ME... Loving YOUUU...."                      "...Giving yourSELF to me.. Could NEVER be wrong..." "...If the love is TRUUUE..."   Suddenly she lifts her head and her eyes meet mine.  She quickly leans in and kisses me on the mouth.  She pauses for a breath to take in the moment.  Then she leans in again and we kiss.  I can hear my friends break into jeers and chants from across the room, we both laugh and try to ignore them.  We continue kissing, and we stay that way for a while until suddenly realizing that the music has changed.  We're both very quiet, enjoying that rare feeling you find in the beginning of love.    Her eyes are closed and her arms are locked behind my head.  We continue to sway to the rhythm of the previous song.  She slowly opens her eyes and looks deeply into mine.  She takes a deep breath and says that it's time for her to go.  Still holding me tightly she kisses me on the cheek.  I can tell she doesn't want to let go any more than I do.  I take her hand and lead her to the nearest empty table.  We sit to talk, surrounded by couples dancing all around the room.  The noisy frat bar has suddenly become a slow dance.  She takes my pen and writes her number on my arm.  She tells me that I need to call her.  She repeats the phrase many times over.  There's a great deal of sincerity in her voice.  As she gets up to leave, I grab her arm and pull her to me once more and kiss her.  She's glowing.  Then I hand her my business card and tell her I'll call her the next day.  She kisses me on the cheek and runs to her friends, who are already getting up to leave.     I breath deep and sit back down with my friends.  I can see them cheering me and slapping me on the back.  But I can hear nothing.  I'm lost in her eyes.  I go home in a dream.  It was a good night... One day soon I'll have a night like this.  _______________________________________________________________________________   Needless to say, the dream didnt end there.  I am a very sensual and sexual person, but that's not something I want to put up here.     --Will

       The Artist Vs. The Artist   Being an artist is a tough fight.  It's hard to find harmony between the  productive artist  and the  artist fantasy .  I find I work best when I don't think at all.  But in order to be productive you have to plan your work.  But to plan, is to think.  And thinking is the enemy of creativity.  So it's easy to get caught in that netherworld between the two.  I've been stuck in that artistic purgatory for some time now.  Right now I am working on several major comic book story proposals for a big, big company.  A year ago I never would have thought I'd be doing anything like this, but I published a story that this  company  really enjoyed.  They want me to create something that delivers that same enjoyment.  After exhaustively researching this prospect, then weighing the pros and cons, I decided to commit to it whole-heartedly.  After all, opportunities like this don't come around very often.  After making that commitment though, my life has been sort of rearranging itself.  It's pushed me out of certain situations and environments and into other ones, shifting and forming the perfect path for me to follow.  It's a very uncomfortable and unsettling process.  In the interim, my productivity had ground to a complete halt.  Aside from the occasional commissioned project, or  daily artistic whim , I have done almost nothing.  It's a very disturbing contrast to what I am normally capable of.  But it is as it is.    Since the new year I have felt alive, and reinspired.  I've worked a lot, only limited by the addictions I had formed over the few months that I was inactive.  Those addictions being, mindless television, junk food and the internet.  All of those things have broken down in the last few weeks since the new year.  Some in very painful and depressing ways.  But none the less, I am free of them.  However, it is up to me to make something with that freedom.  So I am recommiting to my productivity.  I'm aware that it will start small, as it always does.  Every day next week I plan to draw 5 to 10 detailed character sketches.  The week after that I plan to start drawing pages again, one a day, as well as the 5-10 character sketches.  Then at the end of the two weeks, I'll reassess what I have done, and set the next goals.  Being productive, with anything is hard.  But it's not thinking about doing it... it's about doing it.  You slowly make it part of your life, until it is your life.    I believe that being a productive artist isn't any different.  It's not about conquering yourself, it's about creating yourself around it.  It's still very hard to find the balance though.  Because if I succeed at becoming productive, it is usually at the cost of having a life.  A year ago I was completely consumed with being productive.  I lost a lot of friends because of it.  But this time in my life is the perfect time to follow through, I am alone, I have no wife or family to support.  My friends are all pairing off and are all in their own worlds.  I would rather be consumed with my art now in order to make a living doing this in just a few short years, than work a job making money for whoever I work for, while trying to squeeze my dreams into their schedule.   I've suffered the isolation and extreme poverty for more than a year now.  But achieving my dreams is worth everything to me.  There will be time in a few years where I can slow down.  But this is not that time.  So... back to the drawing board.    -Will

       Managing life and living   I've been preparing for several months to manage my life.  I've bought free-weights, and workout clothes.  I've been cooking healthy dinners nearly every night for the last 2 months.  And most of all, I've been eliminating all of my excuses one at a time.  To the point where I have no excuse to drink sodas or eat out or not exercise.  I'm managing my life so that the excuses dont exist.  I drink plenty of water, I have plenty of healthy food in the house and I have everything I need to exercise regularly.  I am in month one right now of a 6 month work out program.  I started out at 300 pounds, and lost nearly 20 pounds from eating right alone.  My goal is to be at 165 pounds within a year and have a very defined muscular body.  The weight loss has sort of stopped though since I've started lifting weights.  I guess I'm replacing fat with muscle.    I finished week two of my exercise plan tonight.  I skipped lifting weights last night because I was feeling depressed about losing my computer.  So I did the routine tonight instead.  I can tell the exercise is working, but the visual results are still small.  My arm muscle's are all starting to show definition.  So now instead of 18" arms that look fat, they look like 18" arms with muscles.  My shoulder's are very well defined now and it makes me look like I'm actually strong.  My chest is slower to change though.  I think every time I've tried exercise it's been that way.  My chest and stomach are both 52" inches, those are my trouble areas.  I'm focusing on my arms right now so that I have something to be proud of.  "Surrounding my enemy" so to speak.  At the same time I'm breaking in my chest and ab muscles, getting them ready for the hardcore workouts later on.  So far whenever I flex, there is definite muscle movement under my chest.  So that is a good sign that it is working.  But change is slow.  I've vowed to make it through the entire 6 month plan before i start second guessing myself.  I went swimming yesterday.  This was my second time this week.  Next week my sister and I are going to go Monday, Wednesday and Friday for 2 hours at a time.  My sister isn't trying to get into shape, she actually already is, she just wants to get out of the house and get back into swimming.  She makes for a really great exercise partner.  Within the next couple of weeks I'd like to also add running/walking a couple times a week.  The more cardio I do, the faster I burn the fat to reveal the muscle tone that's already underneathe.    I'm starting to realize why swimming is such a tough workout.  It's the breathing.  It's hard to hold your breath while you're exercising.  When I run or walk, I tend to breath with every step.  With swimming you're only supposed to breathe every 3rd stroke.  It's going to take some practice to get where I do that naturally.  But once I do I think it will be a great exercise for me, and I think it will help with everything else I do.  --Will

       The Universe conspires to help us, even when it hurts.     Every thought of my day is consumed with producing my work.  Every aspiration I have is to make myself a better artist, and produce successful stories.  Unfortunately in the last 4 months, my follow-through has been stuck in the mud.  I continue to dream and plan as though I were still working as hard as I was just a few months ago, but dreams can only get you so far.  I believe that when you contract with the Universe to help you in achieving whatever dream it is you want to make real, the universe will conspire to help you do it, even if you find  yourself  unable to do it.  Well, lately, the Universe is kicking my ass back into gear.     A few weeks ago when the internet on my computer stopped working, I should have been paying attention.  Instead, I went out of my way to fix it, rather than fix what was REALLY the problem.  Last week, when the antenna on my TV broke so that I only had one channel to watch, I should have been paying attention.  It was the end of staying up till 5 in the morning zombifying to the Late night news.  I still didn't get it.  Then yesterday, my computer's hard-drive crashes... that was my wake up call.  I'm paying attention now.  I've lost everything.  My scripts, my journals, my art... everything.  Fortunately the few things I need right now, I still have within my reach.  And the only thing left for me to spend time doing is to draw.  Which is the only thing I should have been doing all of this time.  No more playing on the internet, chatting with friends or "researching".  So chalk it up to fate.    I should have been listening more carefully.   I'm back to work now.  I went to Denny's and drew all night.  I got a dozen or so character sketches done for the proposal.  Now I just need a few dozen more and to finish some actual sequential art and I'll finally have a complete project to send in.  At least I'm more confident that I'm on the right track now.  If the Universe is going to go this far to keep me on task, then I must be doing something right.  Lets just hope something comes to fruition with this story proposal now.   -Will

       A Message from me.    If someone other than myself is reading this, please forgive the dull nature of my life.  I'm a quiet person with very simple goals.  For the next couple of years my purpose is simply to become a better man.  To understand myself, to finally get my body and life into shape and to become successful producing and making a living off of my art.  All of which I have made great strides to achieving, with some moderate successes, but all are still slightly out of my reach.  This journal isn't meant to entertain anyone, or make people like me.  It is for personal purposes strictly.  I'm recording my life to disect and understand why I do the things I do.  If however you do find yourself reading this, for whatever ungodly reason, I hope that you can somehow take something good away from my experiences.    Sincerely,  Will

                            Leap year Schmeap Year   So this is what a leap year feels like.  You know, I don't think I've ever paid attention to whether it was a leap year or not.  Let's see... last leap year I was 23... hmmm... 2000... nope.... I had my head up my ass then.  You know, I was thinking the other day (you believe that?) and I realized that it was a year ago this month, that I committed to getting in shape and losing weight.  A year, do you believe that?  And it took me almost 9 months to get the ball rolling.  And almost the full year to get where I was competent at managing my life.  That's pretty ridiculous.  Anyways, I made 3 very important realizations this week.  One, I'm not doing enough cardiovascular exercise.  Two, I don't need to be doing weight lifting till I make more head way on losing weight.  And three, I'm STILL eating way too many carbohydrates.  Last week I started doing 20 minutes on the exercise bike (and I have the hurting ass to prove it!) before swimming each day.  That has made a HUGE difference in my weight control.  Apparently, even though I'm getting better at swimming.  To the point where I swim at least 30 - 40 laps each time without hardly stopping to catch my breath.  I am still not to the endurance where it helps me to lose weight.  I think in another month or two it will be.  But it's not right now.  I've also cut back on weight lifting because it doesn't seem to be helping my cause right now.  I've got some pretty big muscles, but you can barely see them.  So I figure in another month or two, as I'm getting to lose more weight from swimming and bicycling, I'll jump back into weight lifting full swing.  My muscles aren't the problem, it's my lungs and my metabolism.  Lastly, I've realized that I've been sneaking all kinds of breads into my diet more and more.  Lots of crackers here and there, and too much rice with each meal and at least 2 or 3 bowls of cereal before bed (which is the worst time for it).  This weekend I've started cooking just chicken and stirfry vegetables (no rice or breads) before dinner, and I've lost 5 pounds this weekend alone.    So that's  that .  Lets hope that next leap year I'm a millionaire, or at least immensely successful with my writing and art.  And I especially hope that I am finally in shape.  I don't want to be 30 and still looking like a pear.   --Will

                                      Dream Traveler   So before I turn 30... a little less than 3 years from now, I want to start traveling pretty regularly.  One of my first stops is Boracay, a small island in the Phillipines.  I plan to spend a month or two there.  It's got to be one of the most beautiful places that I've ever seen.  I think to be a good writer, you need to travel a lot.  And observe the world and the people in it as they live.  You need to be able to "paint with words." So that's my excuse for going to paradise.                                            urlLink     One of the next places I'm going is the Cinque Terre in Italy.  I actually want to live there for at least 6 months to a year.  My goal is to paint and write almost exclusively.  If learning to do art on my own the last 5 years were my college education, the Cinque Terre would be my graduate degree.                                             urlLink     The third, and probably not the last, place that I plan to go in the next 3 years, is to Portugal.  I want to walk the pilgrimage of  El Camino de Santiago  in Portugal.  It's a very spiritual and personal journey.  And I think before I go into the next decade of my life, it's very important to reflect on the path I've followed.  I don't have any pictures of the Camino... mostly because I'm waiting to see it with my own eyes.  And I don't think any picture could do it justice.   --Will

                                            WooHAH!!   I finally got word back from my editor about the first submission.  The overall response was great!  He said he loved the art and especially loved the story idea.  He said that it was one of the better written/put-together submissions that he's received.  I guess that comes from my years of receiving crappy submissions (and a few good ones) for Lucid from prospective artists and writers, and knowing what NOT to send.  Also, he was amazed that I was the one that wrote the pitch, considering that all these years I've worked with other writers and have hardly written myself.  So that made me feel good.  I guess I'm getting better as a writer.  He also said that the pirate theme is great, and especially my treatment of it.  And he mentioned that the company is really on the lookout for pirate material, in the wake of Pirates of the Carribean(since it's gonna be in the market for at least 5 more years due to sequels) so the timing of this couldn't be better.  Stoked!  There are some minor changes to be made, which I expected, and they're very simple to fix.  Stuff like, more clearly defining certain  risque  subject matters, so that it's not left open so widely to interpretation.  I'm shooting for a younger audience for the story, so I have to be careful with how I deal with adult themes.  I totally agree.  Anyways, I'm pretty much on cloud 9.  This rocks.  I'm going to refine the submission this week and I want to do some more color material to include in the packet as well as some more sequential art.  Hopefully I'll get the final proposal in by the middle of next week.  Overall, I've got a great feeling about this.  Everyone pray for me or sacrifice a goat or whatever you do.  I need all the help I can get.   --Will

                                  Stupid Stupid Gateway!   I got my replacement hard drive in today.  Stupid service reps at Gateway never put in my order.  They made me wait a freaking month, and when I called back 4 times each of the people I talked to just flat out lied to me about sending it out.  Stupid people.  Sometimes I just really hate people.  It's just one of those weeks.  Anyways, I've spent most of the night putting programs on my computer and downloading updates and such.  But now I've finally got my own computer.  I'll prolly start working on my website now and doing more color samples for my proposal.  Unfortunately I still haven't been able to salvage anything from my broken hard drive... sigh.

       Stupid Stupid Lubbock!   Grrrrrrrr..... Stupid Lubbock!  Well now they've gone and done it.  Now I'm really P.O.'d.  Lubbock no longer has a 24 hour Kinkos.  So much for my late night trists with reproduction and fanzines.  They've ripped out my heart and replaced it with a charcoal black toner cartridge.  I feel so lost, like there's no where left for me to go.  I mean, I live my whole life at night, and now I can't even make copies of my artwork.  There's nothing else to live for.  No.. you don't UNDERSTAND!!!  Stupid, stupid, stupid Lubbock.  I'm ready to get another job just so I can leave this damn town.  Stupid, stupid....  sigh.  Now I'm sad.   --Will

                           Writing lessons...   So I'm still working on the beginning of my script.  I hope this isn't a normal habit for me, I've already written most of the story, but I'm still working on the beginning, lol.  I've written it 3 different ways and none of them make me happy.  I want the first 5 pages to be fun, captivating AND relevant.  So I'm creating some rules I want to follow for introducing the main character and beginning the story.  I've always done this sort of thing, writing rules and such.  Especially when I was learning to draw.  It helped me to solidify what I was doing right and eliminate what I was doing wrong.  Its just that, now you poor readers are forced to be subjected to this meandering process and most of you don't give a goodgoddam about writing.  So I pologize now if this is boring.   Wilbos rules for gooder writin'  1.  The reader must care for the character before they care about the conflict. 2.  The character is developed not just by how they  Act  but by how other characters  React  to them.  3.  A Hero is the guy that  Knows  stuff... They're not the guy that  Learns  stuff. 4.  The Beginning is not where the story starts, it's where the reader starts.  So don't try to squeeze all of the history in before the reader even starts to care about the character.  5.  State your  thesis  in the opening, just as you would in a research paper.  If your story is to have a  purpose , you must state that purpose in the beginning, you must discuss it in the middle and prove it in the end. 6.  Write first-- think later!!!  So that's it so far.  At least for starting a story.  I think the thing I keep getting stuck on, is that I don't want to start in a straight-forward way.  I don't want to go the obvious route, because, well... It's been done more than a hollywood hooker.  So I'll keep chipping away at it.  I'll prolly post it up here when I get something more concrete written.   --Will

       Fragments for February 21 2004.    Here's another  urlLink Fragment  scene. If you don't know, it's where you take 3 random Fragment sentences and try to incorporate a story around them. The fragments are in bold.   The last remnants of daylight are crawling across the floor as he draws the curtain to a close.  Neon lights hum to life as he sits back down at his easel.  The figure on the canvas stares blankly back at him.  There is no life in the painting.  The frustration is imminent on his face as he tries to wipe away the doubt, along with the flecks of paint on his forehead.  He's covered with drops and streaks of colored paint.  It would seem that he is more the work of art than the heartless endeavor sitting in front of him.  Suddenly he stands and throws the canvas across the room.  The wooden frame breaks from the force and lands in a pile of hundreds of other broken canvases.  He screams aloud.  And it reverberates throughout the tall white room.    A soft voice answers the scream, "Did the  painting  win again?"  A beautiful dark haired woman in an oversized black sweater is leaning against the doorframe with her arms crossed.  She's smiling, as though this were what she loved about him.  He sits down on his stool in front of the easel.  He is noticeably more calm with her in the room.  But the frustration is still evident in his voice, "I can't do it! I can see it, but it won't come out!"  He gestures as though he holds the answer in his hands.  "It's like it's afraid to leave me."  He crosses his elbows at his knees and rests his forehead on his arms.  He stares at the ground for a long moment trying to understand what it is he's trying to say.  " Just make a list  of all the paintings I've started.  And how  many  of those have I finished?"  He yelps exacerbated to the ground, "NONE!!!"  "You think too much" she says half-giggeling.  She walks to him and leans on his back wrapping her arms around to hug him, the tips of her fingers hidden beneath the bulky sleeves of her sweater.  She whispers softly in his ear, "An artist never finishes his work remember? ...he simply lets it go."  She lays her head on his shoulder and squeezes him tightly.  "The hardest part is letting go."  And  after the third  time she hugs him, she finally whispers, "That  which is supposed to  be truth never comes easy."  She can feel his agitation release.  She can feel his new found peace.  She loosens her embrace as he breathes in deep.  Suddenly he twists the knob of the radio up louder and places a new blank canvas on the easel.  The canvas seems to be alive before the paint has even been applied.  She knows this one will be great.  And as she quietly leaves the room, she smiles one last time, and watches as he begins to masterfully work into the night.   --Will

                            Les Triplets of Belleville.   I saw the  urlLink Triplettes of Belleville  the other day with my Mom and my Sister.  God this is such a great movie.  The entire animation has almost no dialogue.  I mean, there are some characters speaking in french, but for the most part you don't need any verbal cues to understand the story.  It's brilliantly done, with symbolism and repetition of themes.  It also had some of the best characterization I've seen in a cartoon in a long time.  The Grandmothers personality was brilliantly drawn.  She and the Dog are probably the best part of the movie.  I love how there are 2 or 3 themes throughout the story that are constantly repeated and tied back in.  There is one theme with trains, of which the main characters dog is deathly afraid of.  It starts with him as a puppy, He's tired of chasing the boys toy train around the track and he sits down with his little tail sitting on the toy railroad track and the little train runs it over.  And they never let it go from there.  The entire movie, whenever there's a train the dog is barking at it, and it sets up some hilarious scenes.  My favorite scene is when the dog is asleep he's "dreaming" about trains.  Suddenly he's on the train barking at the window in his home as the train passes.  It's the opposite of how the scene plays in his real world, but it's done in a very funny way.   I think the best part of the movie is how they take the inherrent iconography and exageration that makes cartoons so magical (ala, bugs bunny, etc...) and they carry these over into a somewhat more realistic style.  The french Mafia goons are these very blocky characters, and the Mafia bosses are almost "Just" a head.  And the bicyclists (which are sort of the central characters) are almost stick-figure characters with tremendous exageration of the muscles.  It was incredible how far they were able to go with everything.  And anything can happen.  You're constantly reminded that cartoon characters don't abide by normal laws and they have a lot of fun with breaking those laws.  And I loved the personalities of the Triplettes.  Anyways, I highly recommend this movie to anyone that gets the chance to see it.  Unfortunately if you're in Lubbock it's too late to see it in theaters.  It was only here this week.  I hate this town.     --Will

                        Say Goodbye    Its funny how the distance can make you feel close. And the things you've lost are the things you want most. The weathers fine here, a perfect shade of blue I guess that's why I've been thinking of you  I know you're different now and I guess I've changed too, and I thought what once was right was so wrong for you. Yesterday I was talking and I heard your name. The weathers fine here, with a slight chance of rain.  Time makes you sorry for the things that you've done, sometimes you walk away and sometimes you run. And the weathers fine here, I can feel a slight chill, Some things change and some never will.  So I call you up just to tell you why...  Why I left you and said goodbye. Must be the mood I'm in,  I'm thinking of you again. I call you up just to tell you why...   Why I left you and said goodbye.  I call you up to tell you why... To say I love you and to say goodbye.      Say Goodbye  --Eva Cassidy

                        Personality Types.   I want to talk more about that personality test I took the other day.  Because it keeps coming up in my everyday conversations.  A lot of my friends have taken it and they've found similar amazing results.  Luis took his and the results were uncanny.  I love the realizations that come along with discovering how someone  really  works.  Like his personality has a tendancy to be emotionally detached.  Which is perfect for me, because I have a tendancy to be insensative.  So we fit together great as friends.  He almost never gets  butt-hurt  at the stupid stuff I say.  But what's even more fascinating is that when it comes to being empathetic when someone is hurting.  He has this incredible technique of creating an artificial empathy through his amazing intelligence.  He isn't actually connecting emotionally, but he is so caught up in solving this emotional  logic problem  that it  appears  like he's being empathetic.  I would have never been able to tell the difference if I didn't know him so well.  That's fascinating to me.    One of the funniest things I found, I had my sister Laura take the test today and she ended up an ISTP personality.  My parents and I have been frustrated with her for months because she seems to be dormant.  Her ambition and drive is non-existent.  Which is a major contrast to where she was in High School.  She took the test and the result was dead on.  And from reading her personality she makes so much more sense to me now.  It's so funny.  It explains that her personality type remains dormant until her purpose or inspiration is revealed.  It's a lot like a cheetah or some other high energy animal.  They don't exert any energy until it's time for the hunt.  What's even more amazing is that she shares the same persona as Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, James Dean, Chuck Yeager, Tom Cruise, and a ton of other action stars.  They're known for their low key personalities and their ability to end a scene with one well-scripted line.  That fits her to a T.    I think my test result was dead on as well.  The more I read into it, the more I see myself in it.  What makes me most excited is that I feel like I'm starting to understand myself much more than I ever have.  From the Personology book Luis lent me a few weeks back, to this, to all the soul-searching I did at the end of 2003.  I really feel that I'm starting to get a grasp of how I think and work and how I can improve myself.  Oh and one more cool thing, I found out I have the same personality types as this  urlLink girl .  Who is one of the most inspirational people I have ever had the benefit of knowing.  Which makes me wonder if I can travel the world and do amazing things like this myself.  Not that I ever doubted I could.  If anyone hasn't taken the test, I highly recommend doing so.   --Will

       Me being me...   This was the best crappy night I've had in a long time.  For the most part it was fun.  See, I get all stupid, from living in my head and such, so this kind of day is pretty typical for me.  I spend so much time alone working that sometimes I start to wonder if all my friends hate me.  So I have to occasionally go around to everyone and see how much of it is me being delusional and how much is fact.  I'd say it was about 65% neurosis this time around and the rest was residual bullshit from the last time I was being an ass.  But hey, that's better than usual.    I hung out with Corianna some.  She's one of my best friends.  Whenever we get together we play like children.  We're silly like that.  She got back from Americorp a while back and she's been pretty distant since then.  Which is cool, cause I've been pretty much the same, except the Americorp part.  I think when you leave something so engaging and fulfilling as Americorp, it's a little hard to cope with leaving it all behind.  Here's a pic of  urlLink Cori  sporting her swanky Corp gear.   Then I went and hung out with other folks which I shan't talk about here.  Needless to say it was much more complicated.  But definitely worth while.  Good friends are hard to find, especially ones that put up with me pissing them off as much as I do.  So after smoothing out the rough edges and clearing the air, I ended up having a great time.  Man, whoever knew being neurotic was such hard work.  So after running around all night doing my little social diagnostic.  I spend the rest of the evening with Brandon and some new friends.  Then I get in my little truck to take off, I get 3 blocks and I run out of gas.  It's my fault.. no shit  Will, you're kidding?  Honestly, I thought I had enough to get where I was going and back... man 2 bucks in gas doesn't go as far as it used to, sigh... I hate being poor.    Really I think it was the universe mocking me because I skipped my workout today.  She's like... "Why don't you push this truck 10 blocks to make up for not swimming?"  Luckily at 4:30 in the morning in Lubbock, there is absolutely no traffic.  So here I am trucking along (so to speak) down Slide road, normally the busiest street in town.  " The long and winding road " playing on the radio.  I get to the gas station and I'm slowly pushing past this little Asian lady in the booth looking at me like I'm some sort of freak... you'd think she'd never seen this sort of thing before.  So I put in my $1.73 I was saving for coffee and head on home.  So what's the moral here?  ...I need to start using the phone.   --Will

                        Patience...    Patience  is the King of Virtues.  He commands and conquers all other emotions.  He is stronger and can outlast all his emotive brothers  Anger, Fear, Courage , and  Joy .  Long after they have risen and fallen  Patience  is still standing, still holding the line.  It's because  Patience  is born from  Wisdom  and  Love .   Wisdom  teaches  Patience , and  Love  makes  Patience  strong.  And although he is strong he is also the loneliest of virtues.  For he must suffer the constant torment of the twins  Jealousy  and  Envy  which are always with him.  They are the jestors in the royal court of human emotions.   Jealousy  dressed in his bright reds and  Envy  in her many shades of green.  Together they taunt the noble  Patience .  Leaving him with doubt and challenging his dedication.  But fortune is kind, for she has given him  Faith  his gentle Queen.   Faith  reminds him that  Patience  is needed.   Faith  tells him that  Patience  will conquer all.  Each man must conquer his own emotional Kingdom.   Anger and Kindness,  although strong and loyal warriors, are not worthy of the crown.  They are weak, and are easily blinded.  It is  Patience  that must lead all Virtues, and in turn they must fight by his side.   Anger  and  Courage  protect him,  Love and Wisdom  there to guide him,  Fear  always there to warn him,  Respect and Kindness  in all that he does,  Joy  his constant companion ...and with  Faith, Patience  will conquer all.   --Will

                            Fragments for February 14 2004.    I'm trying out another  urlLink Fragment . If you don't know, it's where you take 3 random Fragment sentences and try to incorporate a story around them. The fragments are in bold.   "Wish I knew... how to  love  you." he says, a saddened look upon his face.  "But it always seems like the harder I try the more I get hurt."  The room that he's in is dark and gloomy, the only light coming from a tiny window at the top of the wall.  It illuminates his face as he grimaces in tortured pain.  "I don't know how many times I can be hurt  and keep coming back ."  A tormented and frustrated look inhabits his face, then suddenly we see why... "I've  already  broken my arms, no telling what's next.  I don't know how much more I can take."  Malcom sits pensively at the foot of the hospital bed.  His broken arms jutting precariously forward.  His whole torso and arms are cast in white plaster.  A tear starts to fall down his cheek, made even more sad by the fact that he has no mobile appendage with which to wipe it away.  "I only want to be loved." he mourns aloud.    Suddenly a Nurse enters the room laden with latex and gauze.  She is large and unwieldy, her massive buttocks barely contained by her unforgiving white skirt.  She speaks in a loud screechy tone, "Okeeay Mesta Malcom.  It's time for'sha 4 o'clock prickin'."  An enormous needle makes it's way to Malcom's side.  The nurse with her delicate Dominatrixy ways man-handles Malcom's torso into strange and uncomfortable positions.  He screams out, unsure whether the pain is from the jabbing needle or her twisted malaise.  In the end it doesn't matter, because his heart is broken.  His tangled bones and bruised skin, can't match the pain of his blackened stony heart.  It has died, and he will never love again.  "So bring on the pain..." He thinks to himself.  Suddenly the pain is brought as Nurse bends him back into place.  He screams out even louder than before.  She looks at him scornfully, as though she can't stand his pathetic cries.  " If you think they're  goin'ta get bedda wit'out any pen, you're in faw sum real trouble Meesta Malcom."  He returns the scornful look, knowing full well she could never know his pain, for she has never lost as much as he has.   When you don't get  to be with the one you love, no pain can match that torture.  He smiles slightly at Nurse as she leaves the room.  For he knows something that she will never know.  He knows that there is someone so special that she could make all of his pain go away.  If only he knew how to love her.  He returns to his pensive pondering.  Counting the bricks in the wall and mumbling to himself.  "...Wish I knew how to try.  Wish I knew.. how to love you."   --Will

                       It's a perfect night...   It's snowing lightly outside and it's a little bit chilly.  This is the weather I grew up with.  Quiet gray skies and fluffy white snow, falling from God only knows where.  All the cars are put away beneath their blankets of white and everyone's inside to keep warm.  I stand in the middle of roads and pretend the world is all mine.  Then softly I make tracks through the fresh fallen snow, my echoing footsteps speaking aloud.  There are no other sounds, no singing night birds or cars racing by ...nothing is all I can hear.  Except for the sound of my thoughts, as if I were speaking aloud.  I imagine this is what Sydhartha felt nearing enlightenment beneath his old tree.  The thoughts tumble round my tranquil brain...  "I remember this smell, I remember this air, I remember remembering these things. "  ...I walk on further my mind continues to wander.   "I wonder who else feels this magic tonight?  Who else will remember this time?"      --Will

                          I've been thinking about beginnings   ...In writing that is.  I watched  Boondock Saints  again last night.  The first time I'd ever seen it was just a couple days ago.  What I love most, is how effortlessly they introduce the characters.  There is no doubt in your mind who they are from the first moment any of them are on the screen.  Even if there are questions about the characters, your first instincts are usually right.  And the hooks are so deeply embedded into the viewer that there is no getting away.    Take the very beginning for instance.  The McManus brothers sit in a pew in the back of a modest catholic cathedral.  They are dressed in black and elaborate tattoos peek out from underneathe their clothes.  Not your typical church goers.  Especially contrasted amongst brightly dressed church folk.  But despite this, most of the congregation seem to react to the brothers as if they belong.  Except for two characters.  One, a little girl on the end of the bench from them, she seems curious, as if she's waiting for them to do something, ...Which they do.  The second character, the preacher speaking from the pulpit at the head of the church, and the only preacher in colored robes, finishes his sermon and begins to sit down.  A second preacher stands up and thanks the first for coming all the way across town from the other side of Boston.  So we now know that he is not accustomed to this parish.  Suddenly the brothers stand up, and walk to the head of the church.  The entire time the regular preacher is giving a sermon, about a young girl that was killed the night before, and that dozens of bystanders watched and did nothing.  You can hear anger and frustration in his voice, but all the while he barely acknowledges the two brothers walking past to the crucifix behind him.  They kneel down to pray.  But the newcomer notices, he starts to stand up, agog at this unusual activity and one of the other parishioners gently places a hand on him to have him sit down.  The viewer is now thinking,  "Huh, so this is a regular thing?"   The new preacher warily sits down again and the regular preacher continues with his words.  As he is finishing, the brothers make their way back out of the church to the door, and turn to listen to his final phrase,  "The only thing worse than Evil... Is when good men are indifferent!"   Accent on the frustration and anger in his words.  The brothers walk out, more tattoos are revealed, they light up their cigarettes and go on their marry way.  The whole scene takes about a minute.  But it so deftly establishes the characters as potential "Angels of Death" and makes them believable, that you never doubt it for the rest of the movie.  There's dozens more characters, that are introduced just as well.  From the bartender at the Brothers favorite bar, with his stuttering/turret persona, made even funnier by his thick Boston accent and his misunderstanding/misuse of colloquialism, " Make like a tree and FUCK OFF !"  To the Italian Mob-boss, quietly sitting with a phone to his ear while two other characters berate each other.  Then after nearly 2 minutes of sitting motionless and expressionless he suddenly stands up and is screaming cuss words into the phone and turning red-faced.  Suddenly his is a very imposing character.  Excellent stuff.  I do have a few problems with the movie, despite it now being one of my favorites.  I think it really falls apart at the end.  When Willem Dafoe starts going into drag, and most of the scenes with Billy Connelly at the end, they're cute scenes, but it kinda loses it's believability for me.  But it's still a great movie and I can't recommend it highly enough.  Back to beginnings...  Right now I'm trying to write the opening to my pirate story.  And this is the first time that I've really thought about beginnings in a while.  I've always known it was crucial to hook the readers in just a couple pages, and I always thought I knew how to do it.  And in a way I guess I do, I  know it  but I don't  understand it .  Yet!  In my mind, the key to introducing a character, and a story, is in the way that other characters react to them.  I think about when I'm sitting around a table with a bunch of other friends at Denny's or a coffee shop or something.  Suddenly someone comes in with a new friend, someone that I've never met before.  Of course, there are the descriptors.  Is (s)he cute/competition?  Does (s)he look interesting?  But most of what I learn about this character in the first few encounters is what I gather from other characters/friends.  I'm sort of watching how other people treat this new character.  Are they rolling their eyes, like they think (s)he's a loser?  Are they mouthing jokes without him/her looking?  Or.. Are they all vying for his/her attention?  Everyone is trying to make eye-contact with him/her?  Or are they trying to relate some little quip that renews an instant connection between these two individuals, out of a large group?  Essentially... How do they react?  I've heard this before in writing too, that 90% of character development and 90% of action is in "Reaction".  And the formula has always seemed to work for me before.    But I'm starting to notice  how  I go about doing it in my writing.  I've realized I have a tendency to start into a scene  after  the action has happened, so that you are seeing the reaction first.  That way you are engaging the reader even more, because they  want  to figure out what happened to cause this reaction.  This technique has pitfalls though, I find I have to rewrite things several times to make sure that all the necessary clues are in there for the reader to connect the dots.  But it seems to be coming more naturally with practice.  That's how it happened with my comic book art.  When I first started I would have to use twice as many panels to tell the same story.  Because I was trying to draw the  before, during  and  after  of a situation.  The more I did it the more I learned that all I had to draw was the reaction.  What happens the moment after the punch?  And drawing the characters reacting to what was said in the same panel instead of what was said in the last panel.  Tricks like that.  Anyways, I'm starting to see how that happens in writing as well.  So that's my spiel.  I don't know if it helped me to figure out my intro, but I think getting these thoughts out there helps me understand the process better.   --Will

                             Diet and Exercise update   This is week 6 of my diet and exercise.  It's been tough ever since I started month 2 of lifting weights.  Since the weight is doubled what it was before, my muscles kind of wince at the thought of doing it.  So I've only been getting in 2 weight workouts a week instead of 3, and I've been slacking on those.  I've got to get back to where my body is craving it.  Swimming is still going well, I've been every day that I was supposed to.  And I haven't started running yet, mostly because it's fricking cold.  But I gave myself two weeks to start into running, so I've still got a shot next week.  Diet has been good.  Even though there hasn't been enough food in the house this week I've stayed pretty consistent.  There was a very nasty incident with some sweet and sour chicken and an all night binge with burger king, beer and chocolate sauce earlier this week.. But we won't talk about that.  Overall the diet seems pretty stable.  My major weaknesses seem to be less of a problem.  There's been no late nights at EZ mart with DR pepper and Candy bars then driving around feeling stoned.  Burger king was a one time thing.  It didn't mean anything.. honest it didn't.  And my craving for raw vegetables cannot be sated, which is a good sign that the balance has tipped from craving highfat/highcarb stuff to craving healthy foods.  Never thought that would happen.  I've decided that I will probably keep more accurate accounts of what I eat, and how I exercise each day and list it up here.  I was afraid of mixing it too much with the rest of my writing.  But this is the most important thing in my life right now.  This is my number one goal this year, to lose weight and get in shape.  And I need to hold myself more accurately accountable.  I'll try to keep it on the DL though so I don't get  "..and he died in her arms..."  followed by  "...and I ate 3 bananas and a taco."    --Will

                 The things that never leave us...    Accepting all I've done and said, I want to stand and stare again. Till there's nothing left to say... it remains there in your eyes. Whatever comes and goes, I believe in your silent call. and I will touch this tender wall, until I know I'm home again. It's in your eyes.  Love... I get so lost, sometimes. Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart. When I want to run away, I drive off in my car. But whichever way I go I come back to the place that you are. And all my instincts... they return and the grand facade, so soon will burn. Without a noise, without my pride, I reach out from the inside.  Love...   I don't like to see so much pain, so much wasted. And each moment keeps slipping away. I get so tired of working so hard for our survival. I look to these times with you, to keep me awake and alive. And all my instincts... they return and the grand facade, so soon will burn. Without a noise, without my pride, I reach out from the inside.  In your eyes... I see the light, the heat. In your eyes... I am complete. In your eyes... I see the doorways to a thousand churches  and a resolution of all my fruitless searches. In your eyes... I want to see the light and the heat. In your eyes... I want to  be  that complete.  I want to touch the light the heat I see in your eyes.    In your eyes.   --Peter Gabriel

              Irritating LaLa's, Narcoleptic Puppies and other disturbing trends...    Aka. What my friends are up to these days.   I've always prided myself on having weird friends, but lately things seem to be beyond the normal weird.  Luey has decided he wants to start breeding narcoleptic puppies.  Frankly, I think the stress of getting married has finally made him crack.  His reasoning for breeding these doggie doormats is they're less likely to run away.  Once they get outside they get so excited that they pass out asleep.  I suppose he's right, no one ever said "you can't teach a  comatose  dog new tricks."  But it just seems like so much trouble, the cross-breeding, the canine sleep studies, the endless nights of tranking out wiener dogs with codeine and Jack Daniels.  It sounds like work, work, work.  And what do you do with those puppies that get the reverse genes and stay up for weeks on end, nervously shaking and incessantly barking... oh wait, he's already got one of those.  Pfft!  Then there's David and   urlLink this  ...  How anyone could unleash such horrors upon the earth, I cannot even imagine.  This man must be stopped.  And I'm not going to mention all the nipple twisting and strip parcheesy going on at Mr. B's house.  Actually... come to think of it, everything seems copacetic.  I love my friends.                     --Will

             Fragments for February 7 2004.    I found this interesting writing exercise last night and I thought I'd try it out.  It's called  urlLink Fragments .  You take 3 random Fragment sentences and try to incorporate a story around them.  The fragments are in bold.   The cold wind blows as she stands in the darkened corridor between the street and their courtyard apartment.  Her hair flys briskly across her face as she tries to keep her composure.  He stands directly across from her in his long black winter coat.  His arms are crossed and he's trying to keep his face from her.  "Please remember me." she says, stepping over the broken roses scattered across the floor.  She leans in to hug him but there is no embrace.  He remains stoic, unchanging, as he quietly replies "I  think you ought to  go."     She turns to leave, hesitantly at first.  She steps from the alcove, and is cast in the light of the setting sun, she turns to him and says "I'm sorry... It's  not that I wanted  to hurt you."  She pauses, contemplating any way to comfort his broken heart.  "I just don't know what I want anymore." As she turns the corner she suddenly realizes that she is lost.  She's been down this road a thousand times, but suddenly nothing seems familiar.  The streets are labyrinths as she walks aimlessly among them.  But it doesn't matter, she's left love behind.  No place can feel like home again.  "Please remember me." she remembers pleading.  "Why did I say that?" she thinks, "Am I afraid of being forgotten?  Am I afraid of never finding love again?"  Suddenly she finds herself standing in the middle of a busy street as the realization finally dawns upon her.  "I'm afraid of never being in his life again."  The cars dart past her, honking loudly, the confusion like the way she feels right now.  He wasn't trying to tame her... or take away her freedom.   That morning he bought  her a chance for a lifetime of love.  And she threw it to the ground with his roses.  She ran.  Her chest heaved to exhaustion as she entered the darkened corridor once again.  And she noticed that the roses were gone, every last petal had been collected.  She runs to their apartment door, almost in tears, hoping that he is still there.  But before she can open the door she hears a voice from behind her.  "I could never forget you."  She spins to see him sitting at the edge of the courtyard fountain, with a dozen more roses.  She can't hold back the tears as she runs to him.  And in his arms she fell and the sun came down.  And they shared the night together.    I know it's cheesy, but hey...  It's a start.    --Will

                 Get me out of this place.   I want to swim in the ocean.  Right now.  I'm sick of living in this dusty desert.  It's a mellow life coated in deep browns and greys.  I want to swim in the ocean, and smell the sea air.  I want to 'want' to wake up in the mornings.  All the magic here comes from the night.  This dirty old town.  But God it is beautiful tonight.  The sky is wrapped in a blanket of mist.  Fog drifts through the trees and back into itself.  It echoes, the air does.  It's like the world is lost in thought, and you can hear her sighing as she contemplates this sleeping city.  But it changes nothing.. I would give anything to get in a car and drive and drive and drive... until there are waves lapping at my feet.  And the sun hitting my back as it greets the pacific ocean.  ...sigh... but not today.  Maybe tomorrow.   --Will

             Lost in Moments of Dreaming...   It is morning, and light sifts through the bamboo window screen.  The room is washed in light the color of warm oranges, reds and gold.  She suddenly slips from the bed, gently wrapping a blanket around her.  The sheet spills around her as she moves softly across the room, leaving her back exposed to my sleepy gaze.  Her body comes to rest on the seat in front of the window, so she can bask in the soft morning light.  Warmth caresses her face as she closes her eyes and leans back her elegant neck.  I watch as her long auburn hair pours over her shoulder.  I suddenly see a calmness that I've never seen in her before.  She takes in a deep breath, as though it were her first, then she opens her mouth to speak, "It's been so long since I've seen the morning."  The sentence rings in the air joining the specks of floating dust in the bright morning light.  "I've never been in love like this..." she said, finally letting her breath go free.  I let the words hang in the air, enjoying their potent message.  After staring out the window for a long and thoughtful moment, she turns to look over her shoulder at me, "...I've never been in  love  like this." she says, as if finally aware of it's meaning.  I cross over the room and sit down behind her, then wrap my arms around her.  I put my head on her shoulder and together... we quietly soak in the sun.   --Will

             ...Never mentions the word addiction... in certain company.   I realized tonight that I'm a  recovering addict .  I'd never really considered myself an  addict .  That's a harsh word.  But that's exactly what I am.  I'm addicted to foods.  I've talked about it a few times on here, how it often felt like I was getting high when I'd over-eat.  But I never really associated that with addiction. Despite it being the most logical link.  So now, when I find myself caving from time to time to temptations like eating at  BK  or sneaking  Snacks ... I'm really just falling off the wagon.  This is my heroin... my alcohol... the monkey on my back.  Suddenly these seemingly  harmless   slips  have more impact when I look at them.    See the thing is, being overweight is just a symptom.  It's not my  real  problem.  It's just a visual clue that there is a bigger issue permeating my life somewhere.  And that problem is a lack of control.  Because I surrendered control of my life to laziness and convenience.  It was  easier  to "grab a burger" or "supersize".  I was too lazy to go for a walk, or cook my own food.  I was too busy to exercise or I didn't have the time or I had better things to do.  Those are all bull-shit excuses.  I have more time now in my life, because I make the time to exercise.  I schedule the time to do things... I am in CONTROL of the time to do things.  And I finally have the  energy  to do them.    But I can no longer look on my occasional lapses into temptation as innocent, or inevitable.  This is serious now.  I am  fighting  my  addictions .  I am in rehab, I am taking this one day at a time.  I  hate  letting  anything  have control over me.  No more.  I'm done with this fucking excuse.    It's time to shed this skin and live again.   --Will

                Needing Love is Not a Sin...   I walk quietly like a ghost among those in love.  Careful to not be resentful of another's fortune.  Admiring the magic of lovers, how they make each other better than they are.  How they reflect in each other what one takes for granted.  The patient merit that love brings.  Forgiveness, Grace and Comfort are all things they drink deeply from their loving cups.  I stand stoic, and patient.  Aware that my loveless bonds are my own.  I want to be proud of myself, before I share my heart again with another.  So I work on, chipping away at the wall I've built around myself, destroying everything that's stood in the way of my happiness.  Confident that love will be mine.  Too tired to fight, too hopeful to not.   --Will

             Lucky to live, lucky to be alive.   I found out tonight that my friend  urlLink David  was in a horrible car wreck this morning.  What a way to spend a birthday!  It totaled his car, and the firemen had to cut him out.  He's lucky to be alive, and I'm glad that he is.  But not even a minute after I found out about the accident, I discovered that someone else that I knew, from long ago, died in a car accident a couple months back.  Her name was  urlLink Gretchen Goodwin , I went to Grade school, Junior High and High school with her.  She was always one of the nicest people to me.  I remember her being a wonderful person and a true spirit.  It's always shocking to hear that someone you've known for years has died, it's even more so when they were so special.  But she lived her life to it's fullest.  She lived more in her short time than most people will in their whole lives.    I sometimes feel resentment for not having stayed there.  In a way I feel robbed of my connection to something.  I've always felt like a nomad, learning to blend in wherever I am, but never really belonging anywhere.  Maybe I would have felt that way no matter what.  Maybe that's the way I was made to be.  But when I hear of someone dying, or someone succeeding from my old home, it saddens me a little that I'm not close enough to them to really share my sympathy in pain, or rejoice in their triumphs.  I mean I do have friends there still, but really... I no longer belong.  It will probably be that way some day where I am now.  But I guess that's how life is.  Goodbye Gretchen, You lived your life well.  I only hope I can do the same.  As for David, I'm grateful you're still in my life, and I hope you know that life's too short to waste.  Living is what life is for.  Happy birthday bud.    --Will

             The Ghost In You...   A man in my shoes runs a light,  and all the papers lied tonight,  Cause falling over you is the news of the day.  Angels fall like rain... and love... is all of heaven away.   A race is on, I'm on your side.  But here in you, my engines die.  I'm in a mood for you or for running away.  All the stars come down in you.  And love... love... love... You can't give it away.   Don't you go... it makes no sense.  When all your talk and supermen,  just take away the time and get in the way.  Ain't it just like the rain.  Cause love.. love.. love... love.. is only heaven away.   Inside you time moves... and she don't fade.  The Ghost In You... she don't fade away.  Inside you time moves... and she don't fade away. The Ghost In You.. she dont fade.  A man in my shoes runs a light,  and all the papers lied tonight.  But falling over you is the news of the day.  and love... will not fade away. and love.. love.. love.. will not fade away.    -- Counting Crows

             Back in the Current   I feel much better today.  Got up, went swimming, and I feel good.  Actually today I did better with swimming than I've ever done.  I swam 40 laps(big improvement!) and I was even able to go a couple times from one end of the pool to the other without coming up for air.  That's a first for me.  It either means I'm getting more efficient with my movements finally, or I'm starting to use my air better.  Either way, it was a big change for me.  I'm pretty sure we're going to stick with swimming 3 days a week from now on.  And the other two days we'll go running.  Get some variety in the routine.  I've also decided, that the next time I have a break down like yesterday, I need to just go for a walk or a short run.  Not necessarily to make up for binging, but to counter-act the guilt.  Because the guilt only leads to more eating.  I've I'd just gone walking after the mountain o cookies, I prolly wouldn't have gotten all depressed causing me to eat worse before going to bed.  Oh well, chalk it up to a lesson learned.      --Will

             Crash!   Today was bad... and it could have been so good.  I skipped swimming today, which wouldn't have been that bad.  But I skipped lifting weights last night also.  The first time I'd really done that since I started this whole thing.  But the worst part about all that, because those really aren't that bad, they aren't adding to my problems.   But when I DO them they take away from the problems.  Anyways, the worst part about all that is that I fucked up my diet today.  I tried, I ate on time for lunch, had a really healthy lunch.  I snacked around on healthy stuff all day, but then... my Grandma comes over with a whole plate of cookies for me.  They were gone before I realized what I'd done.  I felt sick right away.  And even though I ate a healthy dinner I still felt sick.  And then to top it all off I just had 3 hot dogs.  Blech!   I don't know why I'm even mentioning all this here... I guess I'm just confessing my sins, so that I can start from scratch tomorrow.  I think I'm so upset about it because the first thing when I woke up, I looked thinner!  I went right away to take measurements to see if I'd changed since Jan 1st.  I'd lost 2" off my chest and stomach.  That's pretty good.  That's like 20 pounds gone.  Have you ever picked up 20 pounds of something? That's a LOT of weight.  So it just sucks that by the end of the day I gained some of that back, just by being stupid.  Oh well.  Tomorrow's another day.  I've run into a couple snags with the swimming thing.  Number one, it itches.  Chlorine is friggin itchy after you've been swimming.  So far I've been able to tolerate it 3 days a week, but I think the reason I didn't go Monday or today, was because I was dreading being itchy every day this week.  So I think I may have to keep it at 3 days a week and spend the other two running on a treadmill or biking or something.  I've got to stay on top of this thing though.  I'm finally getting a foothold in  managing  my life and I don't want to lose that.  And accepting stupid excuses like "I'm itchy" is not the way to do that.  It's so hard to motivate long term.  I can't see what I look like a year from now, I mean I can imagine, but I can't actually see it.  Because I've never looked the way I wanted to look in my adult life.  So all I've got is how working out makes me feel each day.  That's what makes days like this so tough.  Tomorrow!   --Will

             Good Omens   I've been writing all night, myself and kevin, the guy that I'm writing the Pirates proposal with.  We finished writing almost the entire first 6 issue story arc tonight.  I thought I was doing well yesterday with wrapping up a few scenes.  But tonight we knocked out the whole damn plot.  Complete with themes, character development, lessons learned, and a ton of humor.  There's still a lot of work to do, only about 10% of the dialogue is done.  But the plot is about 90% nailed down.  And it seems pretty complete both as individual issues and as an overall story.  It feels great when a story starts to come together like this, and even better when the threads start to tie back into themselves.  Best of all, the theme and thesis really stand out.  And of course there's my  favorite  part of writing, when the characters start to write themselves.  I don't think I've ever worked on a project that I've gotten this kind of result with.  I'm so stoked.  I started out in comics as a writer about 7 years ago.  I had no ambition, or belief that I could be an artist.  I didnt have the talent and there were many artists out there that were already better than me.  At the time I at least  thought  I was a good writer.  But for some reason I lost my nerve.  What happened? I started working with another writer and he made me feel incompetent and untalented.  It was in very subtle but condescending ways.  And so I stopped writing and focused on what I was getting good at, which was my art.  That was 5 years ago.  I have hardly written a day since then.  It wasn't till this proposal opportunity came up a few months ago, that I decided to give writing another try, and what I realized is that I'm a GREAT writer.  That the person that made me feel so insecure in my writing, was just doing it so that I would feel like I needed him to do it for me.  I wasted so many years in self-doubt because of that.  It's unfortunate, because I would be pretty damn good by now if I'd stuck with it as much as I've stuck with my art.  But as it is now, I'm playing catch up.  But at least I'm doing something again... finally.  Heres an image from the story that I'm working on.  If anyone's interested...      --Will

             Self-Fulfilling Affirmations   I was talking with a friend tonight about changes we've both been through in the last 6 months.  I especially am amazed at how much I've changed in the last 4 months.  The changes began back in October when I started keeping a journal.  It's not just writing down my thoughts that's been so important, although self-analysis has been essential.  It's the fact that I've been defining my goals.  I've always been good at dreaming and planning.  I could do that to the end of days.  But it's taken me the task of  affirming  my goals for anything to change.  And man have they changed.  What I've discovered is that following through, for me at least, comes from doing something every day.  I wake up and every day I work out, I cook a healthy meal, I write in my journal and I produce art or writing.  That is following through.  It's not something I do over a long period of time, even though it is.  It's something that I did today, and I will do tomorrow, until it's a year from now... and so on, so forth.  Granted, plans  are  important, I have to work towards something, I have to know what to work on each day so that after several months it adds up to a final project.  But believe it or not, I was shocked that I was describing a "routine."  This whole time I've been thinking of it as, cliche as it is, "one day at a time."  My Ultimate failure for many years was all rooted in the fact that I wasn't following through.  I felt guilty about not finishing the big things, those were the most painful and most obvious.  But really, it was everything.  I wasn't finishing anything.  Each day I woke up and didn't know what I would eat that day.  Each day I woke up I wasn't sure what the plan was going to be.  I was a ship adrift at sea without a destination or direction.  It's no wonder I couldn't follow through on anything major, because I couldn't even follow through with breakfast.  I am not perfect (who just laughed?).  I find myself learning something new about myself everyday.  But I feel great about myself now.  I feel confident and focused.  I feel in control.  I finally  KNOW  that I'm getting stuff done.  There's no more guessing about it.  I can't describe how different that feels from the pathetic waste I felt like 4 months ago.  One other thing that I realized from talking with my friend, was that I'm starting to discover the  power of words .  I know... hokey.  A few months ago I started thinking about how the power of words work.  They say if you're afraid of something, that you should write it down, because writing it down gives you power over it.  It seems to be the same way with dreams.  When you write them down they become  self-fulfilling affirmations .  If you write your dreams down, the universe will conspire to help you achieve them.  If you write them down, it gives you power over them.  This is essentially what I  did when I started keeping a journal.  I would write  affirmations  to myself about what will happen in the future.   "Someday soon I will take control of my life and my body."  "In a few short months I will learn to be more responsible."   and one that I'd almost forgotten about,  "I will learn to capture life in my writing."   The moment I wrote those down, my life began to change, people around me started to change and the opportunity for these things to come true started to develop.  I could write them all off as coincidence, or that it was my brain subconsciously doing the work.  Either way... its working.  These and several other goals are starting to become reality.  Just from writing them down, and giving me power over them.   --Will

             Go Figure?   Just a few days ago I was complaining on here that I hadn't lost any weight in the last month.  Then I take a few days off from exercising before I start up with the "Shock & Awe" portion of the program, and all of a sudden I've lost 5 pounds.  I guess I was moving so fast that I had to slow down to lose it.  That makes no sense what-so-ever.  Quickly, I finished the first step of proposal number 1 and I'm sending it off to my editor tomorrow, so wish me luck.  Second, I started month two of working out today.  This is the month where you lift twice as much as you did the previous month, so.. ouch.  Third, I can only do 15 sit-ups, how pathetic is that?  Fourth, I just have to say that I really just love Honeynut Cheerios.  They make me happy.  Good night.   --Will

             I dreamt of an old friend last night.   Her name is  Emily.   I have only had dreams of her on a handful of occasions.  All of those dreams came just before enormous changes in my life.  All of those changes, were completely unexpected.  All of them were wonderful.  I guess she represents that change because she was so special to me.  But I have no idea what is about to happen.  The dream last night was very pleasant.  We had, of all things, an art class together.  It was a long narrow white room filled with tables for working on.  One side of the room had tall windows from ceiling to floor all along the wall.  And plants hanging from the ceiling in between the windows.  I never saw the walls behind me, until I went through the door, at the end of the day to leave.  I sat at one end of a long 10 foot table about 4 feet off the ground.  Very tall for a table.  Emily sat on the other end and there were several other people at the table and all around the room.    The entire room was filled with laughter and play.  And her eyes were, as always, shining and smiling as she laughed.  We talked at great lengths throughout the class.  Catching up on old times and making new memories.  Somewhere during the day the teacher called me to her desk and had me go through a small black box full of pictures.  They were all pictures of Emily through out her life.  She said it was time for me to have one.  I couldn't help feeling that I had to be secretive about it.  Even though the teacher was assuring me it was ok.  I guess it had been so long, of keeping her quietly within me and only sharing her with a few friends.  I went through all of the pictures and they were all wonderful.  They were each from different points in her life.  So it was like me getting to finally catch up with her.  Finally I came across a picture of such beauty, that I had to hold it and stare.  That's the one I kept, and I put it inside my pocket and went back to the table.  I don't know what any of us were working on.  Some people were making sculptures, I was drawing.  But most of all we talked.  We talked like old friends.  Toward the end of the dream I went outside and it was this giant mall that I seem to visit from time to time in my dreams.  It looks like I giant space station.  With a giant metal cone in the center of it all.  The narrow part of the cone points down and it widens as it goes up, but it goes so far up that you can't see the top or the bottom.  There is an enormous gap between the cone and the walkways that go around the mall.  When you look up you can see light streaming down and all around, filling the building.  The place that the classroom is, is a great white hallway, with clothing stores on either side, and the doorway to the classroom, is tucked in the back of one of these stores.  I can't remember much else from the dream, only that there was something I needed to do.  Something I needed to do for Emily.  But I can't remember.  Dammit I can't remember.    --Will

                            Sinking in.   I haven't had a great week.  Lots of forces working against each other in my life right now.  I think I've been battling my demons, but it's so hard to make out the good from the bad.  I'm torn between faith in  myself and God , and  knowing what works .  I know that living on faith works, but it's a very hard thing to trust.  I've seen it work many times, I've even  trusted  it many times.  But I don't yet understand it.  Fear is a lot of my problem.  Fear of the unknown.  How can one live on what his talents alone provide?  How can all the pieces come together just right so that it's possible to live off of my own abilities?  And most importantly... Can I handle it?  I see it's possibilities, but the unknown permeates it all.  I think conquering my problems one small step at a time, has really been the solution all along.  But I find it becoming more and more complicated by "possibilities".  I could take this small thing that I've done and take it to the next level.  I could take this small thing and do it HERE and do it THIS way and it will bring all the success I have longed for.  These  possibilities  are where failure inevitably intervenes.    I don't know, it all sounds like mindless babbling to me.  The only thing I do know, is that I started swimming 4 months ago and I could barely finish 10 laps.  And now I effortlessly do 50.  And I suspect that 4 months from now I will do twice that.  And I know that the caricatures will get better too with each month of doing them.  And doing comic books and everything else will get better with each month.  As long as I'm consistent.  But the planning.. and the possibilities are where I keep getting tripped up.  Counting the money before it's made, taking the next step before I've finished the first, making plans to do something before my talents are even ready to meet that promise.  I'm sabotaging myself with potential.  It's a whole way of thinking that I'm having to force myself to change.  Something else I've found.  One of the inherent problems with facing your demons, is facing all the consequences and repercussions that you avoided (or ignored) while you were letting convenience (laziness) and fears rule your life.  I've had a lot of those consequences come up this week, and I'm afraid they are only the tip of the iceberg.  But I find that in facing my problems, I receive more of the tools I need to deal with them.  How do I know that?  I believe very much in the saying that "God never gives us more than we can handle."  And the reason that consequences are surfacing now, is because I'm ready to deal with them.  It's painful admitting how wrong I was about some things.  It's painful accepting mistakes.  But I know in time, I will find complete peace in knowing I've conquered them.  And hopefully I can continue on this path until they are all conquered.  I want to find peace in  living .    --Will   Now about this song... I wanted to share it with ya'll.  It's the song that gives me some of the greatest comfort in my life.  I'm not sure why, I can't really explain it.  Maybe it's the simplicity of it, or all the memories associated with it, or maybe it's the rousing chant of "Everything's gonna be alright!" in the middle of the song.  But whenever I listen to it, I find myself peacefully soaking into my mind and ready to face whatever struggle brought me down to begin with.  I found this song again last night, and it brought me back to the surface of my life.  Taking in a deep breath of the air I'd been struggling to breathe.  It brought me... peace.     No Woman No Cry   Said I remember, when we used to sit. In the government yard in Trenchtown. Observing the hypocrites, as they would mingle with the good people we meet. Good friends we've had, and good friends we've lost, ...along the way. In this great future, you can't forget your past. So dry your tears I say. No woman, No cry. No Woman No Cry. Woman and sister, don't shed no tear No woman no cry.  Said I remember, when we used to sit, In the government yard in trenchtown. and then Georgie would make a fire light and that wood log would burn in through the night and we would cook corn meal porridge of which I'll share with you My feet... is my only carriage So I've got to push on through. But while I'm gone.  Everythings gonna be alright Everythings gonna be alright Everythings gonna be alright Everythings gonna be alright Everythings gonna BE alright Everythings gonna be alright  So woman don't cry.  Woman and Sister...  you can dry your weeping eyes No woman, no cry.   --Bob Marley

                     Moments like these...   The soft steady beat of a bass guitar plays from the other room.  Muffled songs filter down the hall into the bar.  Clouds of smoke drift like mist at sea.  Colored light paints itself magically over everything.  I sit quietly in my booth, drawing and observing the people around me.  When I notice her sitting at the bar.  I watch as the blue light clings to her milky white skin.  Her hair falling in front of her face like a curtain as she seems to sing into her drink.  I notice from time to time that she is watching the mirror closely.  Her back is to the world, but she is keenly aware of everything around her.  I don't think she is waiting for someone.  There is too much despair in her slow thoughtful motions.  I imagine she is wary of the men prowling around her.  That she wished only to be alone, but not alone.  I think at any other time she would be a vibrant person.  But not tonight.  I wonder to myself what her story might be.  I can tell she is sad.  And it only seems to worsen with each drink of her potent liquid.  As though each glass of alcohol was filling her with sadness.  Yet I know she must be trying to drown whatever ales her, burying it in dark waves of liquor.  She breathes out deeply.  Fills her heart with smoke.  Then the curtain closes once again.  I want to go to her, but I fear I would be just another man.   So I draw her in my words.  Draw her in my mind.     --Will

                                Seeing through it all   I just got back from doing my laps at the pool.  I did something today while swimming that I've never done before.  I looked around.  It started somewhere around lap 32, I looked forward and realized that I'd never seen the pool from that angle.  I was so used to looking down and following the blue line painted on the bottom of the pool, afraid that if I didn't I might swim diagonally and cause some awful fender-bender in the pool.  So I'm looking ahead, and I see the water for the first time.  I notice how incredibly blue it is, how clear it is, I can see the far end of the pool.  Then I notice the light, and how beautiful the light reflects the ripples on the bottom of the pool.  And  then  I notice how fast I'm going.. haha.  I feel power and control over my motions.  I feel confidence.  Sure there's a bunch of guys swimming faster than me, but I'm swimming faster than myself, faster than I've ever been able to.  I feel myself start to smile.  A few laps later I'm still enjoying looking around, and that's when I start to notice the people.  They're all regulars, one's that I've seen dozens of times, but I've never given them much thought.  First I notice this older lady swimming in the lane to my right, next to the wall.  She's nearly 80.  But she's here everyday.  She slowly swims her mile then quietly leaves.  I never see her smile to or talk to anyone.  She's just there enjoying the water.  I don't think I've ever been here without her swimming.  I slow down, pondering what her story might be.  Did she grow up swimming, and it reminds her of her childhood?  Was she jilted by a lover, or lost her greatest love, and swimming is all there is to take her mind away?  No, I think it just makes her feel better.  Not just the exercise, but the peace that comes from the inherent silence the water brings.    Which brings us to old-suitcase-man.  Suitcase man comes to the pool everyday.  He must be 75, he comes in everyday wearing these gawdawful green speedos and a swim cap, towing this wheeled travel case behind him into the pool area.  Same thing everyday.  He walks up and says something to the lifeguard on duty (doesn't matter which one).  She laughs awkwardly, and he walks away.  Puts his suitcase by the door and climbs down the stairs into the deep end.  Today suitcase decides to talk to the old lady swimmer, she doesn't respond well to it.  He mumbles something and then dives back under.  Old man starts his little swim routine.  A few moments later, the old lady comes back the shallow end of the pool and climbs out.  I don't think she likes him much.  Then old-suitcase-man stays in the deep end for about 5 minutes, doing what I can only describe as "diving for hidden treasure."  Because there was nothing to be found, that I could see.  He was over-and-over diving to the bottom, doing somersaults and coming back up for air.  I started to wonder if he might be some treasure-hunter like jac Cousteau or something.  He comes to the Lubbock YWCA to train for deep-sea diving, and to stay in practice with his suave repertoire' with the ladies.  Anyways, he didn't stay long, about 10 minutes total, then he leaves.  I get the feeling that he's really lonely, and that most of what he does is to show up.  From the hiddentreasure diving to the suitcase and the green speedos.  I feel for him.    There's a lot more people that I could talk about.  Each more eccentric than the last.  But I just realized how long this post was getting.  I will say that my swimming seems to be getting better every week.  Today was the fourth time in a row that I've swam 50 laps.  That's 2/3 of a mile.  It's my new minimum.  I will never do less than that, no matter what my excuse is.  Once I start doing it a little faster I'll probably move up to a mile each time.  My ultimate goal is 2 miles in and hour.  And then I'll hold it there.  Then I'll start working on running and bicycling.  Laura and I are planning to enter an iron-man competition sometime early next year.   --Will

       Bittersweet    A little light looks through her bedroom window.  And she dances and I dream, that she's not so far as she seems. Brighter Meadows melt in the sunset. Her hair blowing in the breeze. And she can't see me watching. And I'm thinking Love...  It' bittersweet.   More sweet than bitter... More bitter than sweet.   It's a bittersweet surrender.  I know I'm older now. I work in the city.  We live together. But its different than my dream. Morning light fills the room. I rise. And she pretends she's sleeping. Are we everything we wanted? And I'm thinking Love...  It's bittersweet.   More sweet than bitter... More bitter than sweet.   It's a bittersweet surrender.  I said I know we don't talk about it. We don't tell each other. All the little things that we need. We work our way around each other As we tremble and we...  As we tremble and we bleed.  It's bittersweet. More sweet than bitter... More bitter than sweet. It's a bittersweet surrender.    --Big Head Todd and the Monsters

                                      "Waking up is hard to do..."   Okay, so I'm feeling much more balanced now.  I've had a little time to think (and a couple beers).  My new gameplan for dealing with these proposals is to go back to my new rule of thumb  "Keep it small, Keep it simple -- Follow through."   So what I'm going to do are 5-page short stories.  All completed art, penciled, inked, lettered and colored.  No more of this pitch letter and character design crap.  My magic is in my art and storytelling, so I need to focus on that.  This 5-page story will basically be an introduction to the series, with jokes, character developement, and a beginning, middle and end.  Self-contained, but leading to a bigger story.  If five pages doesn't grab them and let them see it will hit their demographic, then I have no business working for them anyways.  Secondly, I went out and made blue-lined copies of some of my penciled pages that I've been neglecting to finish.  My excuse was that the inks were fading whenever I erased the penciled art underneathe.  And I had to keep re-inking them.  I realized today that I've got too many projects laying-around unfinished.  Stuff that only needs a handful of pages to wrap up.  So I'm going to focus on finishing those this week before I paint and do the submissions.  It will be such a relief to get them out of the way.  Also I downloaded Corel Painter 8 last night.  It's a digital painting program that I'm going to start doing my rough-drafts for my paintings in.  I can paint in the computer a thousand times faster than on canvas (thank you lord for color-theory and "edit - undo"), so I'm going to do my rough-drafts quickly in that, then translate them into paint.  So there's less thinking involved.  Thirdly, I'm taking out a small loan from my Dad to buy a new airbrush and paints.  I've discoverd that I've been using a textile airbrush this  whole  damn time.  It's designed to  only  be used on t-shirts and fabrics.  Thus, the paints are thicker and because of that it's physically impossible to get the clean "illustration" style with the airbrush that I've been striving for.  So new airbrush, new types of paints.  I know that will make a huge difference in quality.  And I think working all this time with that handi-cap has made me a better artist, especially when I start working with the right tools.    As you can see, I'm eliminating my excuses.  Excuses are the obstacles we put in front of ourselves to keep us from success.  We often fear the thing we want the most.  -- William... step away from the soapbox!     --Will

                               Working around myself   It's been a very emotionally challenging couple of days.  I started off so well yesterday, but ended on a very low down note.  As the girl at the art-supply store said to me today  "I had a sudden rush of extreme exhaustion."   I think the down-turn started when I got a message from Disney saying that they're passing on the Pirate story.  Which although, I expected, and tried to prepare myself for, still affected me in a big way.  They still want to see the rest of my proposals, having really liked what I sent and liked my previous works.  So I'm bitching about it, but there's no way I won't follow through on doing it.  It's way too good of an opportunity.  It may take me a little while to regroup and re-double my efforts, but I always do.  My concern is that working in this manner with them is the complete opposite of everything I've been figuring out for myself.  Everything I've learned in recent months has told me to start and finish something.  Follow through completely.  But what I'm supposed to do with Disney, is start lots of little things, in the hopes that one of them will be worth following through on.  It's  anti -productive.  It's too easy to fail, because there are no little  victories  keeping me going.  But like I said, too good to pass up.  At least now I know exactly what they're looking for (like the  true  target audience and genre).  I didn't have that to work with before.  So, I have two more stories nearly completed and ready to send, I'll finish those and send them out.  If it doesn't work out, well... it is what it is.  Unfortunately that wasn't all that brought me down today.  Although it was a big flakey chunk of it.  Really it was a combination of things, not wanting to do caricatures today, not enough money to start with today, too many happy couples, too many cute girls, and the MALL and having to go fit myself for a wedding tux today.  It's like I have a really high-tolerance for pain and emotional stress, but once I get to that break-point, it's nothing but free-fall from there out.  Luckily there's Chinese food, and cute girls, and making lots more money than I expected today, and finally getting a modicum of control over the airbrush and... tomorrow.  I really do see things getting better.   I bought more artboard so I can practice painting again this week.  I see HUGE potential for income with doing caricatures.  And I noticed I didn't look so bad in those evil mall mirrors.  At least better than I did last year.  So I'm moving forward, using all my breath.  You see my ship still stands no matter what you drop and there aint a whole lot that you can do.  Sure the banner may be town and perhaps I've grown a little cynical.  But I know, no matter what the waitress brings I shall drink it and always be full.  So all I can do is pour some tea for two, and speak my point of view.  It will all come back to me, gonna get what I deserve.  Lovin' that's what I got.... hmmm.  Time for a nap.   --Will

                              In between the moon and you.   I sit on the stoop with my arms crossed across my knees.  I struggle to clear all thoughts from my mind and listen to the rustle of leaves and the soft breeze.  Street lights dance throughout the trees, casting shadows across the darkened street.  The moon shines over me like the grin of a Cheshire cat and I can hear whistling somewhere off in the distance.  And a nightsinger bird, charming his lonely world with soft bristling melodies.  We're all cut from the same cloth he says to me.  You the moon and me.  We live by the night of the world, we long for our beautiful sun to come, but we're never around when she is there.  He says that he's seen me before somewhere.  Another time, another place.  He tells me that nothing much has changed.  In between the moon and I, float billowy clouds, bloated and grey with someone else's rain.   The moon plays hide and seek with me, peeking out from time to time, flashing his playful grin.  He seems happy to see me tonight.  I lean back to take in the sky, and for a moment I try to remember just how many times I've seen the stars.  Then I smell the coffee's done, so I go back in, back to work again.   --Will

                               Getting Comfortable   Comfortability is a big problem with me.  I've always been reluctant to do certain things because I wasn't comfortable with them.  And at the same time I was reluctant to change certain aspects of my life because I was  too  comfortable.  It takes a real commitment to be able to change those things.  And a conscious decision to choose my comfort zones.  Doing caricatures is one of those, because I never felt comfortable doing it.  It was always stressful because I wasn't skillful enough in the way I wanted to be and I was reluctant to do the work to change that.  Same thing with exercise and painting and dating and a dozen other things in my life.  So a lot of what I'm doing these days is forcing myself to do things that I don't like because I know they're good for me and that  eventually  I will grow to be comfortable doing them.  In the same way that I  know  that some of the stuff I'm comfortable with now, are  not  good for me.  I guess that's what maturity is really about.  Making conscious, healthy decisions even if you're not comfortable with them.  So anyways, on an unrelated note (or maybe it is related after all). I went down to the Lubbock Garden & Arts Center and signed up to teach summer classes.  Five of them actually.  It's been nearly three years since the last time I taught and geez have I grown since then.  I taught for nearly five years before that and I look back at it and think of all the kids I must have screwed up with what I  didn't  know, haha.  Oh well, I hope that I at least taught them to have fun doing it.  Anyways I ran into this guy named Chad that runs "On Q" the alternative art gallery here in town.  He was signing up to teach some summer classes himself.  And I talked to him a little bit about renting out the art gallery for a show of my own stuff.  The funny thing is that I started painting again last night.  Really painting, with real paint even.  I haven't painted in years but it's been on my mind perpetually since January that I am going to learn to paint well and do an art show this year with all new artwork.  In fact they're numbers 6 and 7 on my goal list this year (1/28/04).  Come to think of it teaching art classes again was number 14 on that list.  It's funny how putting goals down in words suddenly makes them more real.  I swear to god that stuff is happening in my life to force me to finish those goals.  The universe is conspiring in every way to help me achieve them.  It's fascinating when you really think about it.  I guess that's what it means when they say "Ask and you shall receive."   --Will

                                    Fragments for March 20, 2004.    Here's another  urlLink Fragment  scene. The fragment meme is done by taking 3 random Fragment sentences and incorporating a story around them. The fragments are in bold.    I'm doing something a little different with this fragment.  I'm working on a larger story, and this is one small scene from that story.  I'm just trying to feel out the characters and figure out where I want it to go.   The life he knew was over.  It was tough to wrap the words around the thought  in his mind .  That all he had known and loved for the last 7 years was gone.  Friends, love, routine.. comfort.  But he was here because he was needed.  He stares out the window watching people walk past his parked car and he leans back in his seat.  His hand rests on the steering wheel as a song finishes playing on the radio.  The song plays in the background of his mind as he ponders the unknown path that lay before him.  His mother was dying, his father was distant and over-worked.  Nothing was right.  Nothing was the same.  He did what any loving son would do in this situation, he dropped his life on the coast and came home.  Despite it being the home he had never really known.    Suddenly he realizes that the song has stopped and a commercial blares disturbing him from thought.  He leaves the car and enters a small cafe on the corner of a busy street.   It's a beautiful  little shop, with bright vibrant colors.  It stands out against the dirt and rust that dominates this town.  He'd been coming here every few days since he first came to town 3 weeks ago.  He doesn't even like the coffee.  But the first day he came to town he came here to get away from the stress at the house.  And the girl working behind the counter gave him the sweetest smile.  It almost made him forget about his troubles.  So he finds himself coming back just to see her smile.  The things we do to escape what saddens us.  He never talks to her, just enjoys the smile.  Maybe one day he will tell her what it means to him.  But not now.  He doesn't want  her  thinking about it any more than  he  wants to be thinking about it.  He sits by the window and sips the coffee.  He wonders if after a few more weeks he would  no longer notice  the awful taste.  Suddenly he finds himself smiling into his cup.  Finding amusement in realzing that most things in his life these days are bittersweet.   --Will

                         Learning Curves   I'm starting to understand a little better what it means to have order in my life.  I wake up each morning now and I am at Zero, there is no negative balance to account for, and anything I do that is productive pays off right away.  Whatever I do is already successful because the problems are already dealt with.  I feel great now right after getting out of bed.   It's such a great way to start the day.  I was talking to my friend Luis tonight and he mentioned something he's discovered lately that really put things in perspective for me.  He was wondering what it was he was really working for.  If he makes his millions (which is similar to what I was wanting up till a few weeks ago) he plans to do what?  Nothing!  He wants to be able to sit around and do nothing.  And I started to realize that I had a very similar thinking.  I wanted to work hard so that some day I could stop working.  But when I finally put that into context with the fact that I get miserably upset and depressed when I do nothing, I discovered that like Luis I've been setting myself up for a bad time.  The irony is that lately I've started shifting my view of personal rewards.   My reward system has mostly been based on what other people think of me.  I do enough artwork to keep people visiting my site.  I do enough work to produce a comic for a convention.  I do enough to say that I've been doing something.  But not enough to truly be successful.  And in all of those instances it's so easy to fail, because if people don't respond the way I envision, then the reward falls flat on its ass.    My reluctance with doing caricatures had a lot to do with that flawed reward system.  I have this uncanny ability to track and estimate the amount of money that I can make at each show.  I could often do that with my comic books too.  But the problem was that with the caricatures my skills weren't at the level needed to do it professionally.  So the traffic was there and the estimates would have been right, except it took 1,000 times too long for me to meet the demand.  So it was perpetual frustration.  Both at the loss of revenue and at my lack in skill.  So this time around I'm keeping it simple, I'm charging half what I normally would and I'm shying away from estimating profits.  Instead my reward is learning the craft, and perfecting it.  At some point I will be at the speed that I need and the skill required to meet the demand, and at that point I can start estimating profit margins again.  But I have to put in the time first and set the proper rewards to motivate myself.  I'm thinking on a daily basis now instead of a monthly or yearly one.  I'll be a millionaire "one minute" at a time.  This discipline stuff isn't too hard.  It's all about actively living each day.  And doing it for the right reasons.    --Will

                                 Swimming Today   I discovered something today while I was swimming.  Last week I mentioned the economy of motions.  Today I learned to take it a step further.  There is only one motion, the arms move like the pedals on a bi-cycle, connected in the center they pivet but remain straight.  Suddenly I'm moving through the water faster than ever and with far less effort.  Today I swam nearly a mile, twice as many laps as I have ever done.  It was so simple that it felt like I was cheating.  It's incredible.   --Will

       Signs and Symbolysm   It's funny, I was talking yesterday about learning to follow through and gain self-discipline.  And right after I write that a friend of mine points out that in my Personology guide, those problems are listed as my major weakness and fixing them is  essential for me to succede.  Anyways, I retyped my personology bio to put up here, so that I have it for future reference after I give the book back to Luey.  I think it describes my personality dead-on.  Theres nothing in it that I disagree with (as much as I'd sometimes like to).  Especially my weaknesses, all of which I'm working hard to contain.  It's so wierd to see it all there in black and white.  If you know me personally, you'll prolly see a lot of the similarities.  Let me know if you actually read this and what you guys think.  By the way... if you're my soul-mate... um... drop me an email or something.  Excerpted from --  The power of Birthdays, Stars & Numbers:  The complete personology reference guide.  By Saffi Crawford and Geraldine Sullivan.    October 25th.  Scorpio   Charismatic and dynamic, with powerful emotions, you are an ambitious and determined Scorpio who expects a great deal from life.  Full of enthusiasm and a spirit of enterprise, you are imaginative and enjoy thinking on a grand scale.  Highly intuitive, with analytical abilities, you have many interests and are usually involved in some venture or undertaking.  A tendency to be impulsive, however, suggests that self discipline and concentration are essential components in your formula for success.  The subinfluence of your decanate ruler, Scorpio, implies that your restless desire to accomplish compels you to find different modes of expression.  Although sensual, you are fond of power, and you want to excel through the use of your cerebral capabilities.  Your ability to overcome obstacles suggests that you can rejuvenate yourself and start all over again when necessary.    Although at times your discerning thoughts and reproach can overwhelm others, your ability to comprehend situations intuitively implies that you can also be sympathetic and understanding.  As a sensitive individual, you often seek to express yourself artistically.  Usually attractive and graceful, with an ability to make yourself popular, you have a flair for social interactions.   Before the age of twenty-seven, you are concerned with issues regarding your deep feelings and personal power.

                           Living the loving life.  Come with me my lovely wife.   I had a party tonight in my little house.  My best friend Brandon and his lovely bride-to-be Jennifer are off to San Antonio in the morn to be wed.  So tonight we (myself and every one that's known and loved this wonderful pair (that I could get ahold of)) had a little bachelor/bachelorette party to celebrate them gettin hitched.  I had so much fun tonight.  Lots of laughing and good friends and beer.  I'm proud to have such an eclectic group of friends.  We're a wierd silly lot.  But it makes for lots of playful fun.  My thanks to everyone that came!  I hope you had as much fun as I did and I think Mr and Mrs BAdkins really enjoyed it too  I wish you two all the love and happiness in the world.     --Will

                    Ah... sweet, sweet satisfaction!   My quest for order is complete.  The last box has been boxed, the last file filed.  Every square inch dusted, polished and sheened.  And every  thing  has a place.  My house is now in order.  I've disposed of the superfluous, the useless and especially the bad reminders.  I cannot describe well enough the feeling of peace I now have.  It's somewhere between hope and excitement, but too magical to give to words.  I woke up today with confidence that I have not felt in ages.  I think that will be a regular thing from now on.  I look around the house and I know exactly where everything belongs and if something slips out of place I quickly know how to correct it.    The next step is to create order in my actions.  It feels more complicated than step one, but I think in the end it is merely an extension of creating order in my house.  Meaning, I will feel out of place if my actions are not in order, if the routine is not being followed.  I realized a month ago that the crucial weak link in every endeavor I've ever tried, was that I was not following through.  Not in any of these huge projects I was attempting, and especially not in the little everyday stuff, like cooking and cleaning and exercise.  How is it possible to follow through on anything major if I can't even feed myself on a daily basis?  So this will change, and in a sense it already has.  I've cooked dinner nearly every night for 3 months.  That's now a routine, it's also the first real "discipline" I've known.  It also goes along with doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen.  I don't start cooking until the dishes are unloaded, and I don't leave the kitchen after eating till the dishes are back in the washer.  Simple but routine.  I can't believe that's discipline!  It's so simple.  Why couldn't I learn that 10 years ago?  Anyways, every other action will be designed in this same manner.  Wake up, breakfast, workout, shower, lunch, draw, dinner, draw....  Same routine every day until it becomes a discipline.  Knowing what to do and when to do it.    I really think this is the thing that's held me back from success all these years.  I'm looking forward to a year from now, and seeing if the success comes as easily as I expect it to.  I have everything else it takes, talent, passion, skill, connections... but this is the one I lack... discipline.   --Will

                        Economy of Motions   Can you believe that I'm in my 20th week of working out?  It seems like just last week I was bitching about not being able to breathe while swimming.. haha.  It's amazing how much I've improved with my swim strokes, I'm really starting to love the feeling of moving through the water.  Tonight I was thinking about how I've changed, and how it's kind of a metaphor for life.  When I first started into this swim routine I was flopping around like a dead fish (dead fish don't flop william) and I swear to God I could have crawled faster on land.  So what's changed?  Well, I've learned to create an economy of motion.  I use only a handful of movements, compared to the gagillion or so before.  I have a perfect form that I try to maintain and there are only 2 movements for each of those forms.  Up and down.  Arms are straight, up then down.  Legs are straight, up then down.  Torso twists, left and right.  Head rotates to breathe every 4th beat.  Same time everytime.  It's still not perfect.  I don't have any form for flipping to go back the other direction and I still get too conscious of my breathing sometimes.  But there are times where my mind is soOOo clear.  I'm not thinking at all, I'm just feeling the water rush past me.  It's the same place that I go when I'm drawing.  No thinking, just feeling the lines move across the page.  It's all instincts and experience.  Anyways, I picked up the weights again tonight.  I stopped two weeks ago to regroup and I'm starting up again now.  I'm actually beginning the weight program completely over.  I'll feel better if I have all the little numbers in their little boxes the way they're supposed to be.  And as far as the diet goes, I don't want to jinx it, but it's pretty much in auto-pilot now.  I cook food every night and it's almost always healthy.  And best of all, there's hardly any fast food.  I'm very conscious about what I put in my body now and it's becoming habitual.  In fact none of my pants have fit me for months now, and I'm enjoying the regular ritual of punching new holes in my belt buckles.  And I'm getting more and more comments about how thin I've gotten.  That feels good.  So at this point I'm still on track for looking good for the beach during San Diego Comic-Con this summer.   --Will

                                    Your trying my patience child...   Things didn't go nearly as well at the market today.  It started with me getting a peediddly 4 hours of sleep on top of the  no  sleep yesterday and then I waked up  late  (that's right - waked!!).  Then on the way to the market I learned that my drawing desk apparently has suicidal tendancies, for he lept from my truck and barreled into oncoming traffic.  It did something similar yesterday.  I know you're thinking "Well why doesn't the dumbass tie it down or something?!"  Well screw you for thinking that, because I  did  tie it down, and that's why it dragged behind me a good 10 - 20 feet.  My desk hates itself.  Sigh.  It turns out it's not that bad, the wheels are all broken, but I never liked them anyways, and the table top only fastens on one side, and it keeps flopping around any time I touch it.  So I should fix that.    So after I get to the market and get everything set up and sit down I realize, "It's fucking cold today!"  And apparently all the other vendors thought that too because there was only a handful of other vendors outside today.  Like 10 out of 50, I'm starting to think we were the retarded portion of the group.  No customers till 3.  I pack up and go home early.  Grumpy and sleepy (me not the dwarves) and my suicidal desk.  I can still hear him softly sobbing in the back room.  Do they make mood stablizers for furniture?  "New Pledge - now with prozac!"  Overall I think this was a good weekend.  I know what I've got to work on for next weekend.  And I've got 3 weeks till the next Trade days, so I've got till then to become ninjacal with the airbrush.  But not tonight, I've got my beer, got my tools and an unstable drawing surface to deal with.    Actually... screw that I'm going to Denny's and hang out with some friends for a little bit.  I deserve a break.  Then I'm coming home and I'm going to crash out.    Tonight... I sleep... till I'm  done !   --Will

                        Friends and Marriage   I had a lot of fun tonight, I went to see Kill Bill finally at the $2 dollar theater.  Great movie, lots of fun... lots of fun.  I actually already want to go see it again.  It reminded me of  Lone Wolf and Cub  or  Fists of Fury .  Lots of fun, with crazy silly plots.  Anyways, I went with Brandon and Jenn, two of my best friends.  They're getting married in one week... wow... one week.  I'm very happy for them.  anyways, they're headed down to San Antonio to stay at a B&B on the river walk, and they're getting married by the in-house minister soon after they get there and then they'll spend the next 10 days on honeymoon.  I think that's how it should be, the honey moon should be more important than the wedding.  It's the commitment and the connection that two people share that matters, not the ceremony for everyone else.  You should spend as much time together after a wedding just being, understanding and planning together.  I think far too many people focus on something that only lasts a few moments and you barely remember it anyways.  At least that's how it's been at every wedding I've ever been to.  But to each their own.  Then again my other close friends Luis and Maria are getting married in TWO weeks... and I think that a wedding really is perfect for them.  For one I think Luis' family will be finally glad to see it happen.. hehe... sorry luey, but it's true.  And Maria, well she's never had much in the way of close families and you don't get much closer than Luey's... I think it will be really good for her, and them.  So... to each their own.  Yeeesh!!! I just realized I'm almost out of single friends... hmmm... nope, they're engaged... nope he's head over heals... hmmm...  nope, bad relationship but tuffing it out.... um... we think  he's  gay... God am I the  only  single person in this God-forsaken town!!!  Please lord don't let it be so.  Sigh.  I need to go to bed.  Too much thinking not enough sleep makes my brains hurt.   --Will

                                 What a day, what a day.   I'll make this short because I haven't been to sleep in a couple days.  I laid awake all night with my mind racing about today and the months to come.  I got up at 8 and went down to set up my booth.  All went pretty well, until around 10 when I realized I'd forgotten to bring any paper to draw on... haha.  So I headed home and grabbed some bristol and decided to go ahead and bring up my airbrush and compressor, just to get back into the practice of using it.  It turned out to be a good thing.   I really needed the practice.  My drawings, as was the case before, are good and really look like the people, and I can do them quickly - about 3 minutes per person - but the airbrush is still the bane of my existence.  The first one took 30 minute to color (Gah!) and I had about 20 old hispanic men walk up queringly to ask me how much the compressor was for sale for?  Apparently I was so bad at this that they thought I was here to sell compressors.  Sigh.  It took me about 3 drawings to remember that you have to really crank up the PSI for an airbrush, so that the air actually moves fast enough to get the paint where you want it to go, instead of sneezing embarrasingly all over the page.  I'm writing down all the things I forgot to remember so that I never forget to remember them again.  Anyways, as the day went by things got better.  i started hearing more parents say stuff like "he really captured her eyes" or "Oh my God it looks just like her."  So that's always a good sign that I'm on the right track.  And somewhere around 2 or 3 o'clock things started to really click again and the rest of the day went pretty well, very well actually.  I not only broke even and recouped my costs, I actually made a profit of $30 bucks.  Not bad, especially considering I lost money my first three outings last go-round.  I expect to make a $100 tomorrow after expenses.  And then I expect it will average out at about a hundred a day for this flea market.  I'm happy with that, mainly because I'm not even charging full price.  It will take me a while to get to where I feel comfortable and professional with doing this, so I don't mind playing it low-key till then.  But in the long run it will be well worth it.  I suspect with the flea market and Post old mill trade days I'll be averaging about $1,000 a month for these first few months.  Not bad for 2 days a week.  I want to thank all of you that came out today.  Oh and Happy birthday Adrienne, hope you liked your picture, and say hey to Frank for me.  And I especially want to thank Sara for helping to kick my ass in gear for this.  Sometimes we all need a swift boot to the rear to remember what's important.  Anyone else that's interested (in visiting me, not kicking me in the ass cheeks), I'll be out there again tomorrow.  It's at the Clovis Highway Flea Market.  I'm outside in the aisle between the two buildings.  I'll be the one covered in paint and frustration.   --Will

                             Tidal Wave   My friends lovingly joke that I'm like a tidal wave when it comes to working with - or loving - me.  And the sad part is that they are probably not far off.  The tidal wave; too much to be contained by the ocean, leaps from the sea, reaching out for the shore.  Wanting to share itself so badly with the world, with such power and enthusiasm that it crashes down upon them.  Often scaring them off or overwhelming them so much that they nearly drown.  I have great passion and intensity for those I love, and for what I do.  But it's a power often misunderstood and unfortunately often beyond my control.  I'm slowly learning to temper my passions, I'm trying to contain the overpowering flame, and use it to burn slowly through the nights.  Instead of consuming everything in it's path.  I've found myself having to heed my own advice.  "Keep it simple, keep it small."  After the crash and burn that was  last summer , I find myself cautiously crawling out of my cave, peeking around the corners, trying slowly to move back into the world.    I find myself surprisingly nervous about tomorrow.  I mean it's only the flea market for chrissakes.  But I guess it's really more than that.  I haven't put myself out there since the studio.  I've been too worn and weary to live on the faith it takes to be self-employed.  And I sure as hell haven't done an event like this for more than a year.  Of course, it was such a stressful thing back then, even though, by the 4th month of the season I was starting to feel like a pro.  Knocking out 7 or 8 drawings an hour.  I think I did about 250 caricatures throughout the whole season.  Not bad for an amatuer.  So I'm starting small.  I'm only doing black and white this weekend, no airbrush, no big display, no professional signs or gimmicks.  Just me, my desk and the public.  I'll keep doing it this way until it feels like the right time to take the next step.  My hope is that by the time the fair season starts up again this summer I will be doing 50 - 100 drawings a day, and hopefully earn enough in those 3 months to last the next year.  But like I said... I need to start following my own advice. "Keep it small, keep it simple."  Keep bumbling to perfection.    --Will

       Possible Country Song.    Forever would've been a long time.  All the lines have been crossed All the ships've been tossed. All the crosses bared Not that I ever cared.  Forever would've been a really long time.  All the winds have been spat in All the shit has hit the fan All the dares have been dared Not that I ever cared.  Forever would've been a really long time.  You told me you'd be there forever Then you leave with my golden retreiver I hope that he leaves her. Forever would've been a REALLY long time.   I don't know... It needs some work, but It was just fun to write.  Not about anyone in particular by the way, just for fun.  Anyways, whattaya think?   --Will

                              Speaking of Segues...   Vivid dreams flood my mind as I slip steadily to wake.  The first thing I notice is how beautiful the light is in my room.  I destroyed my blinds last night while cleaning, so in it's place, I put up a thin green silk-sheet to block out the day.  But instead it filtered beautiful soft green light throughout the room.  It felt like walking in a forest through mist and all the imagery that entails.  Today, waking up was special, it's not always that way.  Today I felt purpose from the moment my eyes were opened.  The universe softly nudged me awake, because the day was too big to wait for me.  I love feeling purpose.  I love feeling needed, and that's how I've felt all day.  And I haven't had that in a really long time.    I started the day by sleepily returning a call from a friend needing a ride.  I drove her and her 5 year old daughter to where they needed to go.  I think every person should have the privilege of being friends with a child.  The innocence and laughter that they remind us is in ourselves cannot be matched by anything.  The reward I get from making a little kid laugh is worth more than any book I've ever published or painting I've ever sold.  I look forward to waking up to my own giggling offspring some day.  Some day... but probably not some day soon.  But it was a wonderful way to begin my day.  I feel at peace now.  I know it's only temporary.  But I find stength in the lessons I've learned the last few months, and it feels like there is much more peace on the way.    There's only a handful of things that need to be finished with organizing my home.  But the designs are all completed.  There's no thinking left to be done.  The relief  that  brings to me is immeasurable.  I've felt crippled so many times these last 4 months because there was so much I had to do... before I could even begin.  It can be so overwhelming.  And now, with a couple nights of work, it's all done.  And all I have to do from now on is maintain it.  I don't know why it took me so long to understand this simple way.  I'm glad I didn't move to San Diego when I was hoping to.  I think learning all this about myself would have been so much harder there.  But if the rest of the year goes as well as the first part has, then I should be more than ready to take on that whole new world.   --Will

                          Our secret Carnival.   She danced.. her thin skirt lept up the length of her thigh as she twirls across the floor.  Blue light clings to her pale white skin.  Her body flows to the pulse of the song.  Then she looks at me and grins.  Suddenly her hand's in mine and she pulls me onto the floor.  She  is  confidence, she is sex... she is seduction.  Her hips sway in my hands with motions no other man has ever known.  Her eyes are closed and her smile's wide and only I know what it means.  Neither man nor woman can take their sight from her.  But  she  sees only me, the look of love in her eyes.  She knows my thoughts, she knows my skin, every look and laugh, a secret game played within. No one ever knew, no one ever saw, that every move was just for me. Our secret Carnival.   --Will

                         Progress report   I got a lot done today.  I finished getting the studio set up last night, and tonight my friend Sara and I got almost every piece of excess in my house removed or put in it's place.  We've been through all the closets, the kitchen, my bedroom and the studio.  I'm throwing tons away and creating order everywhere I can.  Another day or two of this and everything will be set.  I will have nothing left that I don't actually use.  Then I'll start into my routines.  By the way, I'll be at the flea market on Clovis Hwy this weekend doing caricatures, if anyone in the Lubbock area wants to come by to get one drawn.  I'll probably spend the next few weeks at the flea market getting back into the groove again before I start doing fairs and festivals again.     urlLink      --Will

                       Chaos, Order and Discipline   Wow!  Big breakthrough tonight in how to live a better life.  I'm starting to understand better the role that Chaos and Order are supposed to play in someones life.  I've always thought that Chaos was something bad and that Order was some ellusive gift that only came to those that were strong of will and blessed with discipline.  And it turns out that I was right.  And I was also wrong.  Order is the route of success... it's a good thing.  Chaos comes when things are not in Order.  Maintaning Order creates Discipline.  Chaos defines Discipline... that's new to me.  My problem is that I've gotten so good at ignoring chaos that it's been resigned to white noise somewhere in the back of my mind.  I am so adept at not letting chaos bother me or effect my emotional well-being that it's ruining my life.  If I have a bill due, it's no big deal.  I can ignore it and keep working.  If my room is cluttered, it's no big deal.  Ignore, keep working.  If there's a deadline getting too close, not a prob... it won't affect my emotional well-being.  This has been the route of all my failures.  It's also the route of my lack-luster productivity.  What I'm coming to realize, is that chaos is bad, but it is a good thing.  It's the warning that something is out of Order, and that I need to put it back in Order.  Because Order is the route of success.  I cannot emphasize enough how many things in my life have been affected by not understanding this dicotomy.  So what am I doing to change this?  Number one I am creating Order in my life.  Starting with putting my house in Order.  Tonight I rearranged all of the furniture in my studio and I've removed ALL of the stacks and boxes of clutter.  The only things left in my studio are permanent tools and fixtures.  And everything has a permanent place.  And the idea is that anytime I use something it will go back to it's permanent place.  Otherwise my mind will recognize it as Chaos, and from now on, Chaos means to me that something is not in Order, and before my mind can rest I must fix that problem.  Then I'll move on to each room in my house and do the same thing.  The next step will be to create Order with my routine.  Each day I have to shower, exercise, cook and draw.  If I do not do those things I will recognize it as Chaos and  want  to change it.  That is the beginning of discipline.  I can see very far down the line how this will help change my life for the better.  This has held me back in so many ways.  I can remember at different times in my life, developing routines like drawing so that I'd feel guilty if I skipped a day.  Same thing with working out.  But I've never understood it as a whole, that Chaos is the thing I should be listening to and using it to gauge what I need to do.    --Will

                               Fragments for March 6, 2004.    Here's another  urlLink Fragment  scene. The fragment meme is done by taking 3 random Fragment sentences and incorporating a story around them. The fragments are in bold.   The full moon light, blue and magical, casts shadows all around her as she sits awkwardly on the park bench.  Her throat is tight, and her heart is scared and she waits calm and cautiously for him to speak.  From time to time she steals looks from the ground up to his pale blue eyes.  The swish of trees circle around them like voices in a crowded room.  Her arms are wrapped tightly around her stomach as though trying to protect herself from harm.  He'd been acting strangely for days. He's been all shy glances, jittery hands and nervous laughter.  Not his normal ways.  And here now, sitting next to her, the strangeness grew exponentially.  His eyes struggle to meet hers.  His heart noticeably racing.  His mind entirely lost away.  Why was he so nervous?  What was it she had done?  What could take him so far from her?    She looks up to the sky to keep the tears from falling.  She watches the clouds swirl around the warm blue bowl of stars.  He gave her love, and  he did that without  want or thought of himself.   Did she let his love go unnoticed?  Did she not give enough?  Suddenly he clears his throat and she looks over to him.  Ready for it all to end.  She closes her eyes tightly, and unfolds her arms to ready for whatever lay before her.  A soft breeze blows her hair across her face and she notices the smell of roses on the air.  Suddenly she opens her eyes and finds his hand on her thigh... and he on one knee.    "I've... got a  question  for you." he says softly, his voice cracking slightly with emotion.  Suddenly she sees a lifetime of love in his eyes.  She can't help but smile.  He smiles back.  Then there are words like "Loving you is everything to me and it's all I want to do..."  And " Why should I give   anything but  everything  to you?"  Then a ring, a promise and a dream and everything her heart had ever feared to hope for.  She simply  wanted to open the  moment and crawl inside forever.  Tears fall like wishes from a falling star and then... he takes her hand, and walks her back home.  Leaving the trees and the moon and the stars to remember his very important question.   "Some day somebody's gonna ask you... a question that you should say  yes  to...  once  in your life. Baby tonight... I've got a  question  for you."   Question  - Old 97's   --Will

                                  Full moon.   The moon is full.  You can tell by the way that everything has subtilely changed.  It was a good night.  Things changed tonight.  Lots of things in me have changed tonight.  But the change was bigger than anytime that I can remember.  It was a night full of epiphanies and discoveries and honest introspection.  I discovered discipline,  true  discipline, not the fairweather dedication I've been practicing.  I've known for a long time that I don't do near as much work as I can handle.  And tonight I realized that the work I do do is only to keep a balance.  I draw enough to keep stuff on the website, just to keep my traffic coming in.  And I write enough on here so that there's a reason for people to come back again.  But I don't do anything unless there is a requirement for me to do so.  This is where my lack of discipline comes from.  I don't make commitments to do work, because I am a man of my word and if I  give  my word to work then it becomes something I "have" to do.  So I've gotten really good at not having any commitments.  I don't have many financial commitments anymore or for that matter hardly any reason for me to get out of bed.  I work, and am reasonably productive, but nowhere near where I could be and used to be.  This is not the way for me to succede.    So my realization is that I  need  to make commitments.  I need to "have" to do things, because that leads to discipline and routine.  And that is what is sorely lacking in my life right now.  So starting next weekend I'm going to start doing caricatures again.  On top of my regular art chores.  First few weeks at the flea market, then Old Mill trade days then possibly the mall.  But it's a "have" to do thing now.  I have to do it every weekend.  And after a few weeks it will become routine.  I've discovered that the route of successful discipline is found in creating order.  But not in the way I always thought it was.  The order comes first, meaning everything needs it's place.  But the discipline comes from "requiring of yourself" to put everything back in order after you are done.  This goes with  tasks  as well.  The task has to be put in order before you move onto the next.  This is the route of discipline.    I know this all sounds so basic... so simple.  But tonight, to me, it was a brilliant realization.  I have this amazing ability to adapt and "put up" with a lot.  Right now I am so committed to my career that I live in abject poverty.  I tell myself I'm only suffering so that I can focus on my work.  But I know that's a load of crap because I don't do near as much work now as when I had a lot of other things required of me.  But I put up with it because I can get away with it.  Because doing better lately has not been "required" of me.  Ever since I closed the studio I have accepted lower standards for myself.  It may have much to do with dealing with the rejection that came along with that.  But I can't use that as an excuse any longer.  I don't do hardly anything, simply because I don't have to.  The problem is that I am unchallenged.  And staying unchallenged for a long amount of time, leads to depression from lack of pride of self.  Suddenly being able to put up with crap is not the amazing talent I once though it was.  Suddenly working a 9 - 5 has a method to it's madness.  Suddenly being productive and disciplined has a whole new meaning to me.  So we'll see in the next few weeks how these new found ideas are put into action.   --Will

       Endings and Beginnings...   I think the translation gets lost somewhere inside me.  Somewhere between dream and reality.  Somewhere where words become action.  The action loses it's purpose and the words lose their meaning.     Dreams are hopeless that way.  You can never really remember them completely, and anytime you try they never feel the same.  And the cruelest of all jokes is that the more you slip away from them the more you forget what they mean.    So I sit on the step in front of my house and I draw in the dirt with a stick in my hand and try to remember how I got here.  There used to be fire burning in this engine.. but now all there is is smoke.  There used to be passion behind the drive... but now all there is is doubt.  I find for the first time in a lifetime that I question what I really love.  What is really important and what I really want.  Who do I work for and why does it really matter?  These are things in my head that go on and on endlessly then scatter.  I often get my endings and my beginnings mixed up.  Sometimes when things go wrong, or things end.  It takes me a long time to realize that its really just beginning.  Sometimes when things are sad or things hurt.  It takes me a long time to realize that it's getting better.  The answers don't always come quickly for me, but they always seem to come.  I just have to remember to begin where things end.  There used to be fear here... but now all there is is hope.  There used to be questions here... but now I know it will all work out.   --Will

                                  Walk-aways    Lonliness  seems to find me more and more these days.  She is my mistress in the night.  She waits outside my door until I'm alone.  Then sneaks into my room and wraps her arms around me when I'm not looking.  She holds me late into the night and whispers in my weary ear.  Saying all the things that she knows I want to hear.   Lonliness  hangs on my every word.  She is gentle and seductive.  And I know that she wants me.  She is tireless in her pursuit of my heart.  And I know that she is loyal.  For if I allowed it,  Lonliness  would never leave me.  She's all the things one could want in a lover, which is what makes it so hard to make her leave.  But  Lonliness  is not kind, she is selfish and demanding.  She fills my cup with sadness, and has me drink into the night.  She bathes me in self-pity, then lays me down beneathe her blanket of doubt.  And I  know  she would suffocate me in my sleep if she had her way.  So why would someone let her back in each night?  I guess for the fear that if  Lonliness  were to leave me...  I might truly be alone.   --Will

                                       The day my life didn't change...   The sky was beautiful and white.  One of those magical winter mornings, where it seemed as if the heavens were taking a deep breath before a winter storm.  The clouds and wind rushed past hurriedly, but with a great sense of peace to them.  And despite a broken heart over the troubles with my dad, I felt a great calm that morning.  I was alone in the house with my little sisters.  And I was in the midst of making something for us to eat.  When I looked out the kitchen window that overlooked the street.  I saw  her  walking.  She wore a big blue football jacket.  A great many sizes too big for her.  She was always small compared to the other kids in our class, and the jacket made her look that much smaller.  She walked with purpose silently up the hill.  Her tiny form dwarfed by the ancient trees looming over the houses in the old neighborhood.  There was great sadness around her.  She kept her head lowered and her arms crossed, and from time to time she would wipe away her tears and the hair blowing across her face.  Every essence of my soul told me to go to her.  That she needed someone.  That she felt sad, alone... and scared.  I wanted to be there for her, the way she'd been there for me.  But as I watched her walk towards me, for what seemed like hours, I began to doubt myself.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.  I didn't think there was anything I could say.  But deep down I knew, that all she needed was for someone to be near and listen.  Someone to be a friend.  But I made excuses to myself... I couldn't get there in time, I couldn't leave my sisters alone, I couldn't find the words, I wasn't what she needed.  But I knew they were all lies.  Because something inside told me what I was supposed to do.  But I didn't listen to myself.  When the voice in your head tells you to trust yourself, and you don't listen, it is a formula for regret.    So instead I prayed for God to comfort her.  I remember that it was the first time I'd ever prayed for someone else.  And I watched as she rounded the corner out of sight.  And I remember thinking that I missed the opportunity of a lifetime... to repay someone for showing  me  the greatest of kindness.  But I let it slip away.  And I've spent every day of my life since that moment, trying to make up for that cowardice.  I help anyone and everyone that will allow me.  I try my best to treat them with the kindness that she had shown me.  Even though I fear I often fall miserably short.  But I can't help but think, If only I'd been there for her, she might've been my friend.  If only I'd made the effort, I could've changed  her  life.  If only for just one moment I could've made her smile.  If only...  that wasn't the day my life didn't change.    --Will

              Up all night.    Is everybody happy now? Is everybody clear? We could drive out to the dunes tonight, Cause summer's almost here.  When the roads are clear, We'll head on out of here. If you're coming back, I'll see you in the morning.  I'm just staring at the ceiling Staring back at me. Just waiting for the daylight To come crawling in on me.  Fix your hair just right, Put your jeans on tight. ...Or wear a dress So I can get it off real easy.  Cause I've been thinking, I'd like to see your eyes... Open up real wide, The minute that you see me.  But if you don't come through, I wouldn't wait for you. I understand that everyone goes disappearing into the greatest grey, That covers over everyday, And hovers in the distance...  I've been up all night And I might sleep all day To get the dreams just right Then let them slip away ...I might sleep all day      --Counting Crows

                                 Old things   My arms rest on the warm iron railing of the train bridge.  I watch quietly as the sky turns every shade of orange and the sun sets before me.  The rusted frame of the old bridge stands like a monument to things left behind.  It aches and creaks in the wind, as though moaning to the stream rushing beneath him.  I imagine all those before me who have stood at this bridge, contemplating the world around them.  You can feel loneliness in his ancient metallic bones.  They cry out as if trying to tell the trees how tired he is, and how he is tired of holding up his hopeless burden.  The train had long since stopped coming through here, and the tracks have long since been removed.  Burden without purpose is the cruelest of all endeavors.  I walk along the railing, letting my hand follow the immaculate iron curls embedded into his frame.  He is from a time where care was given to give life to such things.  I sense his pride swell as I admire the craftsmanship.  How long has it been since someone has noticed?  How long has it been since someone has cared?  I hold onto the moment for as long as I can.  Then it slips away like the water beneath me.   --Will

                                  Better days.   I feel good.  I feel a whole lot better these days.  I finally got my computer back into working order and I've been getting a lot of work done.  Actually, I think I've been so excited to get my computer back that I've been doing too much, and not focusing on finishing just  one  thing.  In the last week, I've been finishing my website, teaching myself Macromedia Flash and Fireworks and trying to write like 10 things at once.  Both programs I've been learning look like they'll be a boon to my productivity and that will let me do my websites a whole lot better.  And sometime in the next few months I will prolly do some short animated movies with flash.  But in the mean time, instead of getting stuff finished like I was hoping (and was actually well on my way to doing)  I've let myself get distracted with a thousand different things.  I can say that in the next few months I will be able to finish my entire website the way I was wanting to.  I have no doubt of that.  It just might take another week or so for me to settle back into a routine of having my  own  computer.  Something funny that I've noticed lately... I was able to write better on my Dad's computer.  Haha.  Imagine that.  I don't know what it is, maybe that the room is so dark and cramped, that there's no distraction.  Just writing.  Or maybe the way the keyboard  "clik-claks"  loudly.  My keyboard is all soft and quiet.  No noises.  I think part of me misses the enthusiasm that goes along with the sound of chattering keys.  Anyways, I just thought that was interesting.  I might actually continue to use his computer, just to keep up my productivity.    In other news, I had THE BEST massage yesterday.  God it's been years since I've had a massage, and this one was great.  I just thought I'd share that.  Make everyone a little jealous.  *sticks out tongue mockingly*    --Will

Her name's Katelynne Macee Devore, she weighs 5.5 lbs is 19 inches long.  Tiny little thing.  I'm stoked though, I'm an uncle... hehe, I'll be the "cool" uncle too.

                          Progress Update   So I've got my new airbrush now.  I had to buy an adapter so it would work with my compressor and  that  finally came in today.  I love this airbrush.  It's very smooth and clean.  I'm getting the control that I had always expected from my other tool.  It's very satisfying to know it wasn't  just  me.  Anyways, I'm still waiting on my paint bottle adapters, which were back-ordered and sent out today, so I should get them on Tue or Wed next week.  In the mean time I'm going to draw a bunch of celebrity caricature samples and make copies to practice coloring.  I'll post some up as I get them done.  Hopefully by next weekend I will feel confident and relaxed with the whole coloring process and I can make some decent money at the flea market.  Also I've thought of a few new venues for doing caricatures this summer.  I'm going to check into them a little more before I mention them up here.  I'm just stoked all around, there is so much potential for working doing these, and the only thing holding me back is me... and I'm fixing that problem as I type this (well not at this  exact  moment... because it would be hard to type and draw and... ok, shutting up.)

                                          Being Big.   Being Overweight.  I don't think many people understand it, even those that are living with it.  Because it's a very complicated issue.  You live inside a shell.  I mean... I suppose we ALL live inside a shell.  We all feel a little isolated and detached from the rest of the world.  We're all just these wandering souls separated from each other by these fleshy walls.  It's just some of us have better looking fleshy walls.  It really has nothing to do with whether a person is good or not.  But being overweight, people sometimes look at you like you are subhuman.  Even other overweight people to an extent.  There are all of these awful assumptions that go along with being fat.  You think, this guys lazy, he's complacent, he doesn't take care of himself, he doesn't  want  to be happy.  And the sad part is... it's true.  I believe that even more now that the weight is starting to leave me.  But not for the reasons one would think.  I was being lazy, I admit it.  I didn't want to do what it takes to be thin.  I was complacent, I was willing to accept the excuses it takes to stay fat.  And as painful as it is to admit... I didn't  want  to be happy.  I didn't want to be happy while I was fat.  And I was lazy because I was already fat, and it seemed hopeless to change that.  But the problem is all about perceptions.  I believed all of those things, because I took them at face value.  I never stopped to think about  why  I was fat.  And I never stopped to think about why I allowed myself to remain that way.   Because I was scared to face my fears.  I was scared to admit all those perceptions of me were true.  But when I finally dug through all the layers and layers of doubt and confusion and fear I discovered I was fat because...  ...it was  easy .  Whatever is easiest, is almost never what's best.   "There are no short-cuts in life."   I was a drug addict, hooked on sugary breads and junk.  And like most addictions (drinking, drugs, sex, etc...) I was using it to avoid what my real problem was.  I was an avoid-aholic.  I was avoiding my insecurities.  I was avoiding my stresses.  I was avoiding living.  If you look at a lot of my blog, I talk a lot about what I'm going to do when I'm thin.  And what I've found out recently is that is the worst thing I could do.  It's dooming my efforts to failure, or at least dooming it to a long unnecessarily arduous journey.  What I realized today, now that I've lost a whole 25 pound sack of potatoes in fat, is that I need to live my life now, like I already weighed 165 pounds, and was built like the rock-house I want to be.  I need to be happy  now !  Because if I don't do it now, I'm only putting off the emotional/mental work till later.  I'm putting off my happiness till later.  And that's no way to live.  See I've been seeing more guys just like me.  Just like I was.  Weighing 250, 300, 350 pounds (or more).  And I see all the things they do and say to try to hide the weight.  I see myself in them, trying unsuccessfully to cover up the embarrassment.  The baggy clothes, the layered look, all black and dark clothes to make it easier to blend into the crowd.  I've seen them crossing their massive arms across their chest to try and hide their man-boobies (when all it does is accentuate them).  I've seen the laughs, followed immediately by the clenched jaw, hoping to not draw attention to themselves.  Today I watched my 400 pound neighbor from across the street mow his lawn and have to stop every 10 feet to catch his breath (despite the fact he was using an automatic mower).  I saw a girl at the pool today walk with a towel draped awkwardly around her shoulders to try to hide whatever it was she was trying to hide.   I saw a close friend (known for his jubilant out-going conversations) go completely silent with anticipation as we approached the pizza-buffet.  Then watched him eat 2 plates full (10 - 15 pieces) of pizza, without hardly tasting anything as they went down.  Then following soon after with a carb-coma severe enough to have to ask someone else to drive.  I saw myself.   I've been and done all of these things and more.  I've been blind but now I see.  And it's very strange to be looking in from the outside for the first time in my life.  So I'm happy now.  I  am  happy  now !  I weigh 165 pounds.  I am rock hard and happy.  I laugh, love, dress and play as though I weigh exactly what I want to weigh.  And I will keep working out, swimming and eating right, until my perceptions and my reality are the same thing.   --Will

                               Faith and Fear - Part One   I've been having mood swings all night.  This happens every so often.  And usually it's because of money... It's  always  because of money.  I ran across a site a couple days ago from some guys that I knew back in the day.  We met traveling the convention circuit and we always mingled in the same online circles.  Well they're hitting it big now with some of the new work they've been putting out.  I guess it's insecurity, or jealousy, or just the every day stress that needing money brings.  But it's sent me on some major emotional trips.    But that is the struggle that comes from trying to achieve your dreams.  It's the inner battle between  faith  and  comfort .  I don't have to struggle.  I could get a job and live comfortably.  I could go get a job tomorrow and have all my debt paid off in a year, and even have money left over to buy the car I've needed for so long.  And for all practical points and reasons that would be the best thing for me to do.  But faith tells me otherwise.  Faith tells me that I can do anything if I believe in myself and God enough.  Faith tells me that I can make more in one month working for myself than I could in a year working some meaningless job for someone else.  In theory, every day that I spend working to become successful and financially independent using only my talents, brings me that much closer to achieving that dream... in theory.  But that's been a long road traveled.  Seven long years traveled.  It's very trying.  And really, my faith has never let me down.  Anytime that I have actually put myself out there and trusted in my faith, it has been more successful than I ever imagined.  What  has  let me down, is me.  My fear, my inadequacies, my discipline, and even my own abilities.  But never faith.  I've worked hard to overcome those problems.  My abilities are not the problem any more, but they were for a very long time.  I've over come many of my fears and inadequacies.  But discipline... lack of discipline... still plagues me.  But that is what I've been working so hard these last few months to deal with.  I've been building discipline in all the simple things, so that eventually they will lead to discipline where it really matters.  As far as my financial struggles (which started this whole diatribe).  I was talking to a friend of mine the other day about a problem he was having financially.  It was getting to him.  And the advice that I gave him was to accept responsibility for what caused him to get to where he is, and make a plan for where he wants to be a year from now.  Don't dwell on the problem.  Find a solution, make a plan, and create the environment to achieve that plan.  It's much easier to deal with the problem if you can see it being fixed over a long period of time.    ...I guess that's the advice I need to give myself tonight.  I know how close I am to financial independence.  I know it's still a ways off, but very much attainable.  I just need to keep reminding myself to "keep it simple" and continue making small, easy to achieve goals, so that I can see myself progressing.   --Will

                             She is...   When my computer died back in January, the thing that I missed the most, was this list I'd written.  The list was all about the woman I will some day marry.  I sat down and wrote it out one night, and it was beautiful and heart felt and thorough.  Then it was gone, along with everything else on my hard drive.  It's funny, thinking about all the stuff I could be missing; scripts, artwork, photos, journals, etc... and the thing that kept making me sad was that.  Anyways, I don't know if it's all the breakthrough's I've had in the last few weeks, or the people I've been talking to, or what...  but I wrote a new list tonight.  And I think this one is much closer to my heart's desire.  My friend Brandon wrote one of these way back in the day, and he's carried it around in his wallet all this time.  Well he got married a couple weeks ago to a really wonderful woman... so the idea can't be all that bad.      Who she is...  She loves me.  She loves me almost more than I love her.  She loves like a child, completely, unconditionally, happily.  And she loves  me  in that way.  She inspires me.  She makes me want to be more than I already am.  She inspires me to push myself harder and farther than I ever imagined possible.    She laughs.  A lot.  She is funny and she makes me laugh as much as I make her (A lot).    She makes me better.  She actively works with me in my life to make me a better man.  I am better each day because of having her in my life.  She is my mirror.  She shows me my self, and lets me know what my strengths and weaknesses are.  She reflects all that I don’t see.  She understands me.  She understands my feelings, and reasoning, what makes me happy, the way I think and the way I laugh.  She is compassionate.  She comforts me and makes me comfortable.    She protects me.  She makes it safe for me to be vulnerable, and honest.  She is my harbor in any storm.  She is intelligent.  Probably more so than I, but that’s why I love her.  She understands all that I don’t, and I understand much that she doesn’t.  She is patient.  She knows I will make mistakes, but she is more than willing to be patient with me through all of those struggles.  She is happy.  She knows  what  makes her happy. And most importantly, she knows what she  needs  to be happy and how to get it.  She is sincere and honest.  I don’t have to guess at what she is thinking, she is honest completely and is sincere in all that she does and says.  She is confident.  She knows herself, she understands herself.  She is confident in what she can do, in what she knows, and in the ways that she carries herself.    She is competent.  She can live her own life if she needs.  She can accomplish any task on her own and doesn’t need someone else to do it for her.  But she wants me to be in her life and to help her with these things.  She is innocent, she still has her childish naivity about her and her childlike enthusiasm.  She is God's child.  She understands that not all things are in our hands.  And she knows when it's time to give it to God.  She is responsible.  She is accountable for her actions and emotions and responsiblities.    She is healthy.  She makes healthy choices, and lives in a healthy manner.  She is driven and passionate.  I have to work twice as hard just to keep up with her.  She is beautiful to me.  Inside and out she is beautiful to me.  …And I am all of these things for her too.   I know it's kind of long.  And probably too much.  But I know if I can be these things, then there's bound to be someone else out there that can as well.   --Will

                           Blood in the Veins.   I feel alive.  Though things aren't really good or bad right now, they are definitely  changing  in me.  For the first time since I moved to Lubbock, I have the feeling that I am living.  It's that feeling that you get when you go to some place different, and everything is new and exciting.  I feel awake, I feel alive.    All of the introspection that I have subjected myself to since last October, seems to really be paying off now.  I feel more productive with my art and writing.  I am losing weight at a steady pace, and best of all I'm losing size.  My friendships are much better now too, I've become much less critical of others, and it's made me feel less stressful.  I've finally opened up to dating again, I've finally allowed myself to be emotionally available, and I finally feel confident in myself and what I have to offer.  It's been a great year, and a great week.       --Will

                               Can you see yourself changing?   I went to the wedding of Luis and Maria Estrada today.  They are two of my very closest friends.  This was only the second wedding I'd ever been to for a friend.  It was a very interesting experience.  It was very different, very... emotional.  I don't think I've ever really experienced anything quite like it.  Throughout the duration of the ceremony and the traditions that followed, I found myself passing through every emotion found in life.  I saw new couples, broken hearts, and the love that comes from decades of two individuals striving to understanding one another.  I saw aspects of living that I'd completely forgotten, or neglected myself of.  I saw tragedy, and hope walking hand in hand.  I saw what I have never seen before.  Things are not always as they seem.  Too often we take for face value what someone does, or says, or when something happens.  It's really only in hind sight that we understand their true meaning, and most importantly what it means to us.  I saw that time and time again today.    Luis came to my house late at night a few days ago.  He was hand delivering invitations that he had forgotten to mail out.  I swear it was a stack of maybe a hundred or so invitations.  At face value, I laughed, "what a silly thing to do" I thought.  Especially when contrasted with the Bride, the model of efficiency, who had mailed hers out months ago.  Until you're standing on stage next to the Bride and groom and you realize that there is no family on the bride's side of the aisle.  Suddenly... it was the right thing to do.  Suddenly the man is compassionate and caring, instead of comedically forgetful.  I know Luis, I know the cathedral would have been overwhelmed with friends and family, with all the people that  love  him.  But instead, it was just enough for you to know this man is special.  And just enough, so the Bride knows she finally has a  family .  That's not to say that Maria is not loved.  No, far from it.  There are very few that walk among us that could bond so quickly and strongly with so many.  But I am so thankful that God has blessed her with this man.  And likewise him with her.  We are so blind.  So blind.  We get so caught up in struggling with the day at hand that we never stop to look at our lives.  To  really  look at our lives.  And sometimes we take living for granted.  Imagine, all your life you have been lost, directionless, aimless, and unable to accept love unconditionally.  It's far more common than I fear to think about.  But imagine... finding that perfect love.  And that perfect love leads you to all those things.  Direction, purpose, pride, forgiveness, acceptance, and most importantly.. love.  Acceptance of love.  Belief... in love.  Then imagine finding all of those things,  and  children  and  family, then suddenly... the lover is gone.  Killed... senselessly... by a drunk driver.  Just as it feels your life together is just beginning.  I can't imagine it either.  It is beyond me.  It breaks my heart to try to think of it.  And Amy lives with that each day.  Why did it happen?  I don't know.  I'm not going to try to slap a "catch-all" everything happens for a reason on it.  Because I've not lived through it.  All I  do  know, is that he wouldn't have changed a moment of it.  Because I know  I  wouldn't have changed a moment of it.  Not everyone is fortunate enough to be born into the circumstances that bestow upon us gifts like direction, understanding, and passion, and unconditional love.  And for those that God has blessed with those gifts, we find a great need to share it.  No matter what pain it brings us.  The circle of love cannot be broken.  Because when you are loved, you  want  to love.  You  want  others to know the great peace that comes with being loved without reason.  And death, nor doubt, nor pain can destroy that.  So if you have love... cherish it.  If you know love... share it.  If you want love... give it.  And don't ever take it for granted.   --Will

                        Speaking of dialogue...   I have a new goal for my writing.  Six months ago when I first started writing again, my goal was to learn to capture life in words.  I wanted to learn to describe a scene and really draw the world in words.  I think I've made great headway towards doing that.  Though I know I still have much more to learn.  I now have a new goal.   I will learn to create dynamic and believable characters and dialogue with my writing.     Why am I telling you?  I'm not, really.  I'm just putting the goal down in words.  Looking back on all that I've accomplished in recent months, I've come to realize that every goal was word for word what I had written for myself to achieve.  So I'm giving my goal power here by giving it definition.  Anyways, I'll share a little bit more later on about what I'm doing to improve on my characterization and dialogue.  But for now I'm going to sleep.   --Will

                                   Summer Art Classes Flyer   The dates are now set for the summer art classes.  After everything, it turns out I'm teaching 6 classes.  2 sets of 3 different classes.  So I'm stoked.  If you know anyone in the Lubbock area that's interested in learning to draw comics, please spread the word.  Here is a  urlLink flyer  if you'd like to print it out to give away (if you don't have adobe acrobat, here is a  urlLink different  version).  Because I know ALL of you love to draw comics.  I'm also teaching a kids cartooning class, which I haven't finished the flyer for just yet.  The kids class is actually 4 saturdays for 2 hours per session, and it's $35 per class or $100 for all four.  I'm really great with the kids.  I make it lots of fun for them, and they always seem to get a lot out of the class, so spread the word.  By the way, let me know what you think of the flyer, if I need to make any corrections or do something different with it.     --Will

       Summer Art Classes   Well I received my contracts in the mail today for teaching classes this summer.  So that is officially in motion.  All I have to do now is finish up my lesson plans and hand-outs and just show up when I'm supposed to.  I've always found it interesting how teaching art classes has consistently been my most successful venture.  I don't know what it is exactly.  I hope it remains so.  It's always a good ego boost when I can leave a room full of people, confident that I've helped them get a step closer to achieving their dreams.  And at the same time, making a decent amount of money from it.  I guess the inherent difference between teaching and most of my other projects, is that once I leave the room the project is finished.  I prepare for it completely ahead of time, show up, and hope that I've prepared myself well enough.  I imagined that as I do more work in this manner I will have the same type of success.  It seems that most of what I do, people respond to it well enough for them to find it enjoyable.  So the weakness isn't in my skills or ideas, it's in the follow through.  Now I'm just sounding like a broken record about this following through thing.  But you've got to understand, that understanding the process and what it means is all very new to me.  Anyways, I've got more work to do tonight.  I'll probably post a bunch of new artwork up next week once it's all finished.  I'm very excited.   --Will

       Home, sweet Home.   So I'm back from Dallas.  I didn't find the answers that I was looking for, but I guess really, I did find the answers that I need.  I went down there to help my Mom get to a social work class that she needed to attend at A&M of Arllington.  But really I was on a bit of an expedition.  I'd met an artist in the West End Mall in dallas a year ago that did these beautiful air-brush caricatures.  And I went to try and find him.  To hopefully find a job, or a mentor, or at the very least some advice.  Turns out he quit working at that location.  I think it had something to do with the artists that ran the booth.  But I'm not sure exactly.  So that didn't work out.  I did get offered a job there, but I think I will have to pass.  They don't do airbrush, and they seem to frown upon those that do.  So I think I'd just be putting myself in a situation for disappointment and frustration.  It was nice being offered though, I guess that's a sign that my skills are approaching nearly professional levels.    The trip wasn't a whole loss.  I love Dallas, and I love driving.  And the two go hand in hand.  I spent a lot of time just wandering aimlessly.  Then I went to the place where I grew up, and 4 other malls (still looking for airbrush caricaturists).  And I also stopped by several of the major comic book stores in the Dallas/Ft Worth area and sold a lot of copies of my recent books.  That felt really good.  It was the first time that I didn't feel guilty about trying to hock something I'd made.  They were professionally done, and looked the part too.  The majority of the reactions I got from store owners was that of surpise and relief really.  They get a lot of people coming in trying to sell crappy work (I know cause I used to be one of them).  But this time around, each time I'd watch them flip through copies of my books I'd see a smile on their face.  Usually followed with "This looks REALLY good.  A lot better than most of the stuff people try to bring in here."    Anyways, that's a major improvement in my career.  I feel a little bit of validation now.  The next step is to actually 'solicit' something to a distributor so that it ends up in  every  major comic book store.  Then after that, soliciting a mini-series, and then a graphic novel.  At that point, I have a feeling I will be content with what I've accomplished, and feel better about going about the business of telling stories.    So I'm really glad that I went.  I think the trip really cemented a lot of ideas and ideals in my mind.  I'm focused on making caricatures a career this year, in the same manor that I intend to continue working out in a disciplined, habitual manner.  And at the same time I will continue to do comic book art and writing stories at a steady pace, but not making them a priority until I have mastered discipline.  I will publish 2 full-size comics this year.  The first is of work that I've already nearly completed.  And I'll solicit that as soon as it's done, hopefully before the summer.  The second is also full-size and in color.  It's a very personal story for a friend.  I will finish that one around the end of October, and I'm not sure about the solicitation.  Other than that, I plan to continue doing comic book art for a mini-series, but I don't intend to publish anything else until '05... until I've got the caricature thing under control.  Basically my new plan, isn't really a plan at all.  It's a new way of doing things.  One day at a time, working towards small, simple to attain goals.  Step by step baby.   --Will

                    The Order Of Things   I had to cancel my first series of classes.  They didn't make.  I just didn't get enough people signed up.  I guess it's just a sign of the times.  I putted out twice as many flyers as I used to and I even got listed in several of the local papers, and online websites.  I guess it's just the way the market is right now.  It used to be I could guarantee at least 12 kids in my cartooning class, and at least 6 - 7 in my adult class.  But not this time.  Oh well.  I've got another series of classes scheduled to start mid-June, and I have several local events between now and then for the caricatures, in which to promote the classes.  So hopefully the timing, and... the juju, will be better for the next set.     --Will

                 Why the HELL couldn't he speak  urlLink this  eloquently and passionately when he was  running  for president.  I'm angry with how badly Bush has fucked the world, I want a  president  that's just as angry.  And Kerry just aint it.  He acts like it's all a big fucking joke.   ...but whatever.

                     Operation: Get Shit Finished  :::Update:::  I could be doing a little better.  I started off great.  I finished penciling and inking a page on Monday.  Then tuesday I lettered said page and started to lay out a second page.  And all I did was clean today.  Cleaning is good, putting the studio back in order is a good thing.  But it's not finishing pages.  So tomorrows a new day.  I'll start and finish a page tomorrow, and do the same on Friday, and we'll call this week a success.  The thing that I'm happy about is that this newest page turned out really good.  I think it's got better flow and action than anything I've ever done.  Plus the textures are much simpler than I've ever done.  Anyways, the first page is one that I inked last week and lettered a few days ago.  The second is the new page.   urlLink    urlLink      --Will

                   New week   All drama aside.  I'm feeling pretty good.  The caricature gig is getting better every week, and my classes are gonna be starting here in another couple weeks.  Lots of good stuff to be hopeful about.  This week -  Operation: "Get Shit Finished!"   I've got five pages left to pencil and ink for a comic book that's been on my desk for months now.  I'm going to finish all five pages this week.  I'm going to bed early tonight - I'm getting up early tomorrow - and I'm going to put in at least a 6 hour day each day this week till I've finished these pages.  I  will  finish these pages.  This story  will  be finished before next weekend.  Here's something interesting --  Despite my recent statements of being an asshole - I'm actually also  a *gasp* really nice guy.  And I know that because lots of people like me.  I was reminded of this because I've been taking flyers around to local businesses all week for my summer comic book classes.  And so far, I've gotten free pizza, free coffee, free copies and $30 bucks in free comics from local businesses.  It's because I love people, and I think it shows in my business dealings.  In most cases people "want" to help me out.  It's just I forget sometimes, until it's time to put up flyers or something like that.     ok - back to work!   --Will

                       Strange Night - Strange Day   I'm an ass.  I think we've all established that over the years.  I say whatever is on my mind - often when other people don't want - or aren't quite ready - to hear what I have to say.  And usually I'm pretty respectful.  But tonight I'm more than just a little pissed, my  I'm-sick-of-this-immature-lameass-gameplaying-shituation Light  is on, and my assholiness is working in overdrive.  So I just got back from this party.  Good party... but a little strange.  Pizza, Beer, Cake and two giant projector screens with two X-box's networked together on them.  Eight player shoot-em-up-heaven. If you've never tried it - it's incredible.  Anyways, the party was supposed to be for one of my good friends.  He wanted to celebrate passing a class that he's been struggling to pass for years.  And now he's got just a couple classes left to go and he's done with his degree.  It's sort of a pre-emptive graduation party (since it's just two much easier classes left to go).  But 30 minutes into it his girlfriend takes him out of the party.  At first it was just spiritually/mentally/whatever.  Then she actually made him leave.  Granted they came back about 3 hours later... but only for about an hour... then they were gone again.  I don't pretend to know what the deal was, he didn't tell me, and I really don't care.  Maybe she had an emergency.  Maybe her grandmother died or maybe someone was sick and she's the only one that can take care of them.  Or maybe she left the gerbils washing in the bathtub.  It must have been something MAJOR.  Because, how selfish and self-absorbed would someone have to be to take away - and completely sabotage - the hard-earned - 7 years of  hard work  people - celebration of someone they - supposedly - care about.  Unfortunately I'm afraid to answer that.  I think I'm mostly pissed because this isn't an isolated situation.  I've only met this girl three times, and each time she gives these icey stares to every girl that is nice to him, and she makes his life miserable during the entire event.  I mean, he's just trying to have fun for chrissake and he gets these guilt trips and... drama!  So whatever.  It's none of my business.  And I don't care.  I just know that if you're in trouble dozens of times a day with someone for just being yourself, then that - my friends - is a very,  very , bad situation.    I'm usually against the idea of talking shit about other people in a blog.  It's very passive aggressive, and immature in a lot of ways.  But I'm venting right now.  So whatever.  I just think my friend deserves a little more respect than he's getting... and to be treated with a little more maturity.  So that's my rant - I'm an ass remember - this is what I do.   Please send all hate mail to william_terrell@hotmail.com   Anyways, I didn't get a chance to congratulate him during the whole "drama-storm".  But congrats buddy!  I'm proud of you, and I know how hard you've worked.  I know because you're the person that kicks my ass every day with how dedicated you are.  Just when I think I'm working hard - I look up and see a whole other measure of success - Keep up the good work.  And don't let anything take away from what you have done.   --Will

                   Strange, strange day.   Caricatures Today.  Nice day.  About 70 degrees, cool breeze, partly cloudy.  Set up at about 12:00.  Usual spot.  But the people that are usually to my right weren't there.  They had to move across the aisle.  Next to me is a giant (10ft x 5ft) swinging display of bumper sticker designs.  Good thing is, it opens up a  lot  of space for people to stand behind me to watch the caricatures.  Bad thing is, I can tell this is going to be a  strange  day.  I get everything set and decide to start the day with some samples.  I wanted to see if I could start getting customers in sooner.  There's this large roley-poley chubby kid that hangs around my booth every week.  His parents run a booth somewhere in the venue.  He's always hanging around asking for a free drawing.  Today I offer it to him.  I explain that it will be a sample that I'll use for display and I will give him a free Xerox copy tomorrow.  Kid agrees.  While I'm drawing kids Dad comes over to make sure he's not gonna have to pay for something.  I explain that it's a sample, I'll give him a copy, blah, blah, blah.  Dad laughs, he thinks it looks just like him.  He walks away seemingly happy.  I finish and give it to kid to show the 'rents... doesn't come back.  Demo worked, I get lots of customers lined up and start into it.  Business slows down an hour or so later and I go track down caricature sample from roleypoley kid.  He gives it back and I tell him I'll have a copy for him tomorrow.  Kids mom comes over a few minutes later, says Dad doesn't want someone having picture of his kid for sample.  "What?" I say.  She repeats herself.  "Whatever" I say.  She elaborates, it's because lots of people know their kid and they don't want someone having a picture of him.  "Whatever" again.  So I tell her I'll take drawing out of sample stack.  She leaves.  Dad comes back a few minutes later and says he wants to see me tear it up in front of him.  "Um.. no!"  Dad gets pissy, says they are Mexican and Mexicans are superstitious about people having pictures of their kids.  Voodoo curses and crap like that.  "whatever."  I know lots of Hispanics and very few of them feel that way.  I think the guys full of shit.  I tell him there's no way in hell I'm tearing up my art just because he's superstitious.  I tell him he can pay the $10 bucks and do whatever the hell he wants with it.  But I'm not tearing up a piece of my art because he's ignorant.  He says he's going to get security.  I tell him that's a good idea and that he shouldn't waste any time.  10 minutes later... Roley Poley's Dad and security guy.  Security guy hears the spiel and realizes the guy is full of shit.  "Sir, I can't make him tear up something because you're superstitious.  You can either buy it from him or accept it."  Roley Poley's Dad proceeds to hand me $10 bucks and threaten to kick my ass.  I laugh.  I've been in enough fights to know I could wrap his ass around his ears.  I take the money and go back to work.  Security guy tells Roley Poley's Dad to stay away.  He's causing too much trouble.   ...no sweat off my back.  I hate stupid people.  Anyways, the rest of the day was pretty good.  Worked from 12:00 - 4:00.  Made about $70.  Did 7 individual caricatures(including roley poley kid's).  Finally feeling some control over airbrush.  Lots more tiny defined lines, like hair and outlines.  Definitely getting the likenesses down better.  Pretty good day overall.  Lessons learned today --  1. I need to get more efficient.  I need to have a better rack for my paints, have them in order, and go in the same order everytime.  "Eliminate all excess motions." 2. Demo caricatures are a GREAT way to get people in line. 3. Have kids ask parents permission before doing "free" caricatures.  Even if you're just fucking trying to be nice to the kid. Sheesh!

                         State of Mentality   So I've been driving around a lot lately.  Wandering aimlessly.  That's usually a sign that there are too many thoughts in my head and they're starting to drive me crazy.  In the past I found that writing them out was much cheaper than a tank of gas.  So I need to start getting back to that.  I'm not sure what the deal is.  For some reason I've stopped writing lately.  It's not that I've nothing to say - more like - there's nothing I'm ready to say.  I'd made so many break throughs in the last few months that I've kind of hit a plateau.  It's like you've finally figured out every trick in the first world of Super Mario and suddenly you're in world 2-1 and it's a whole new game.  Anyways, I'm not ready to go into any of it right now.  I just wanted to say hey, I love you guys and I'm sorry I've been so quiet lately.  Hopefully I'll get Verbose again here soon.   --Will

                         weird Dream... Reeeeeallly weird.   I had this really strange dream last night.  I was on Oprah being interviewed about some big blockbuster movie just out that I'm starring in and I'm out and about promoting, and apparently... I'm Brad Pitt.  Yes, and Oprah keeps pestering me about how I got my ass so wonderfully firm and she keeps saying how I am such an inspiration to fat guys everywhere, that I could go from being really overweight to Brad Pitt and I did it so easily.  So anyways, that was interesting.  I'm not going to read too much into it.  (However, I will be secretly doing butt enhancement exercises every night from now on.)   --Will

                               New Painting   Here's a new painting.  This one is actually for my friend Luis.  It's his birthday today and he loves the wolvie.  I'm pretty happy with how this painting turned out.  I mean there's a lot that pisses me off about it, but for the most part I'm happy with how it turned out and that I actually finished it.  Really, the only thing I'm frustrated with is the anatomy.  I'm happy with how the paints are working for me.  I see myself more in control of the paints, but still have a lot to learn about them.  Also, I actually used my airbrush on this one.  The background is nearly all airbrush.  Pretty neat, eh?   urlLink      --Will

                            Art class   Well I did my speech for the art appreciation class at Texas Tech.  I enjoyed it.  I forgot how much I absolutely love public speaking.  I love the feeling of walking into a room full of people and completely taking control.  In this case it was a room full of bleary eyed, apathetic, hung-over, college freshmen at the end of another monotonous semester.  Apparently "Art Appreciation" is short for "Why the #@$%! do I have to be here today?!" Then I walk in, start my speil, and take complete control of the room.  I guess it helps that I actually care about what I'm talking about.  It's interesting how the speech started to adapt itself as I went along.  Basically I only had about a minutes worth of stuff written out in my mind, then I started to expand upon that based on the fascial expressions and reactions of the crowd.  I think it's important to involve the "reader"/"viewer" in whatever it is your talking about, so I tend to adapt whatever I'm saying to a specific audience based on their response.  It's really interesting.  And it's something I've never really paid attention to till this event.  Anyways, the cool thing is I had about 8 people ask to sign up for my summer art classes, lets hope they do.  It'd be nice.   --Will

                            Life Drawing - Week Two   Well life drawing was a lot of fun last night.  It's very different hanging out with this group of artists.  There's so much history, and experience among them.  Not to mention all of the accomplishments to back it up.  I'm used to a lot of talk and hot air from my generation of artists.  I'm guilty of it myself.  It's refreshing to get away from that and into something more established.  I think I can learn a lot from them.  And not just with the drawing part of the career.  Anyways, my drawings were a little wiggy this week.  Not sure why that was.  I'm going to need to move to a larger paper and maybe start using some charcoals or conte' or something, to really loosen me up more with my lines.  Right now I'm still drawing 8 1/2 x 11 with pencils.  Its a bit confining.  It's still a huge leap from the stagnancy I've been feeling with my figures of late.  Hopefully it will keep getting better.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      --Will

                    In a Mood   Going a little stir crazy tonight.  IT's one of those nights where my mind is moving too fast for the living that I'm doing.  Can't get to where I'm going soon enough.  Anyways -- the drama of the day is  money .  Course it's always about  money , isn't it?  Tonight the issue, as it has been many times in the past, is that I could/should be making more money than I am with my talents.  The example of the moment are my websites.  I've learned certain ways to make money with my site and on the internet in general, but I've been A.) too lazy! B.) too distracted  C.) Unsure D.) all of the above.  Anyways, in the last 3 days I've been introduced to 3 successful examples of how to make money on the internet.  Or at least a modest amount.  And being one that tries to listen to what the universe is saying, I'm trying to reopen my mind to the idea.  Luckily it's stuff that I'm not only already capable of, but in many cases I've already done half the work.  Anyways... rather than bore you people with the details, I'll just lay down my overall goal.    "I will be making $500 a month reliably from my website by the end of 2004."   Now comes the hard part-- putting plan into action.  Wish me luck!   --Will

                          Drawing Tutorials   I started tutoring a new student today.  It's pretty groovy, I'm friends with a guy that owns a framing shop here in town, and I'm tutoring his daughter in exchange for free framing for some of my paintings - paintings for the art show I'm putting together for the beginning of '05.  Works out pretty good, eh?  Anyways, today was the first tutoring session and I think it went pretty well.   In fact I think a lot of my lesson plans are starting to click better in my mind after working with her.  Anyways, one of the tools I used was to do a step by step example of how to lay out the human head.  And afterwords I decided to make some little animations out of the examples - I will probably be putting the entire tutorial up on my website as well in the next week or two.  But I thought I'd share the animations here in the mean time.  I know they're prolly too fast to be of any use as a learning tool, and too slow on dial-up computers.  But these aren't the final product.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      --Will

                            Life Drawing   I joined a Life drawing group tonight.  I've desperately needed to get back to drawing from real life.  My drawings have felt stagnant and lifeless to me for several years now.  And I've known that drawing from the figure was the only way to remedy that.  Anyways, I went to the first session tonight, and it was a blast.  Suddenly I'm remembering stuff I'd long ago forgotten, the lines, the structure, the flow, it's all coming back again.  I can't wait to do it again next week.  I feel really fortunate that this group let me join in.  They've been together doing this for nearly 30 years.  I think I'm the only person (other than the model) that was born in the last few decades.  That's a lot of experience to learn from.  So I'm very excited to see what comes of it.  Anyways, here's some samples of tonight's work.  We'll probably see a remarkable improvement with each week.  That's how it was when I was doing figure drawing before.  Each week was a thousand times better than the last.   urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      --Will

                     Saying Goodbye   The Door Closes... The Song Ends... And with one swipe of my hand the candle wisps into nothingness.  The long December is done.  She is gone.  And my thoughts turn inward and calm.  All the history... the pain, the love, the passion, the secrets shared, the dreams forgot.  Packed up in little boxes and suitcases headed for the shore. In hopes of finding peace and a better life.   Saying Goodbye wasn't all that it felt it should have been.  After all the passion and expression and years of love and friendship... a hug, a handshake and moving on.  I suppose it's fitting.  We were never one to imitate any sort of normalcy.  We were children of a different way.  Bittersweet.  Sweet yet bitter.  She was the first to dig herself into me.  She was the first that wanted to know who I was.  To ask the questions, to understand my emotions, my unspoken language, my hidden fears.  She was relentless in that.  It's hard to let that go.  Goodbye old friend.  Hopefully we'll meet again.  I heard the wind today... for the first time in a long time.  Standing quietly upon an asphalt alter, watching the clouds spill over me.  They're racing to some destination far away from here.  And then the show begins... one of the rare treasures of living in West Texas.  The lighting... silent and relentless.  Clouds suddenly illuminate and radiate, lightning jumps from sky to cloud and back again.  Without a single sound, except the rustling of the leaves, the creaking of the branches and my own echoing footsteps.   --Will

                        New Caricature Artwork   I've been practicing my caricatures a lot lately.  I want to add more life to them, make them funnier and much more exaggerated.  I'm loving my new airbrush, it's made all the difference in the world.  Now what's reall left for me to do is learn how to really exaggerate peoples expressions, and some how combine that with my cartooning abilities.  Anyways, here's some recent results.   urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     By the way, I just got a booth for the South Plains Fair this year.  It's a great spot too, right on the midway.  I was worried I wasn't even going to get a booth let alone a great spot like this.  I'm going to really kick my ass from now until then, and get  really  good, and make some bad ass samples, so that I can kick the other caricature artists ASS!  I'm so stoked.   --Will

                    Motivation    This is me talking to myself - Not particularly for public consumption - but it may be entertaining to those outside of my head - have no idea really.  Sometimes when I push my own mental audience to the brink some of my other personalities step in to take control.  In this case - A Bull Dyke has stepped in to smack around the effeminate prissy boy that's been bellyaching for the last couple weeks about not getting work done.  Hey - we've all got them in our heads somewhere - I'm not the only one - really - no, seriously.   Will!    I'm sick of listening to you whine.  How much do you really want this?  How much do you REALLY want to be successful?  Because right now it looks like you don't want success at all.  It looks like you want to lay on your ass all day and night all pouty faced complaining that you don't know how to get motivated.   Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Do you want to be one of those guys - that just sits around with his friends like a sycophant - giving each other verbal handjobs about your non-existant body of work - hypothesizing about how  successful  you'll be someday and babbeling inanely about all the famous people you've met and you're going to meet and remissing how  wonderful  things will be when success just magically flies out of your   ass  .  Or do you want to be like Alex Ross or David Mack?  Pumping out real work.  Every day.  Excuse free, effortlessly, professionally.  And developing a reputation as an artist that's more professional than anyone you work with.  If so - you need to get rid of the fucking distractions.  Stop accepting your OWN  lame -ass excuses, and take control of your time.  Do something!  Make a  real  schedule and stick to it.  Put the computer in another room - away from your drawing desk.  And either get rid of the TV completely or find another arrangement.    And for GOD's Sake!! --Shut the Fuck up and get back to work!!!!  It comes down to this, Will - You want to be the best - it doesn't happen while watching TV or playing video games or putzing around on the computer.  That's when the people that are really working pass you by.  It takes Sacrifice.  It takes REAL dedication!  Not verbal dedication, not mental dedication... it takes ACTION!  "Loyalty is defined by  actions  - NOT words."   --Will

                        Time Management   So I decided to take a look at how I've been spending my time.  The amount of time wasted is pretty pathetic really.  That's why I've been avoiding.. er..  ignoring  it.  I'm a little embarrassed really, to be admitting how far I've fallen.  I've gone from working 8 - 12 hours a day, either for someone else or at my drawing board drawing.  To pretty much lazing about 24 - 7.  I'm a NEWS junky.  I watch about 4 hours of news each day.  The worst part about that is that after 2 am the news just repeats itself over and over and over.  But I watch it anyways, because my mind is the consistency of a bowl of soggy oatmeal.  And when I'm on the computer I'm constantly looking up CNN, Drudge Report, and BBC online.  I watch about 2 hours of prime time TV nearly every night.  Then every 2 or 3 days I'll watch David Letterman and Conan O'brien and crap like that.  But my real weakness is 3rd rock from the sun.  I love that show.  It's on at 1am every week night.  I've already seen every episode a dozen times but I still love watching it.  And the internet... I don't even want to get into that.  I'll just say that I'm on it as much if not more than I watch TV.  Anyways, what I'm getting at, is that I don't have any real obligations right now.  I'm very fortunate in that.  But that's also what makes all the time wasted all the more sad.  But I'm owning up to it now.  I don't need it to be my guilty little secret anymore.  I can start letting it go.  See, I was apparently wasting my time as a coping mechanism.  I think what started it, was when I stopped sticking my nose into other people's business.  I didn't have anything to do anymore.  HaHa.  Funny.  So I turned the magnifying glass inward.  And I spent so much time looking at  myself ; analyzing myself, criticizing myself, "fixing" myself.  Learning my issues, learning to be happy.  That in order to turn my brain off and stop thinking, I started vegging out in front of the TV and the Computer.  But I think I'm done now.  I think I've finally reached a plateau in my personal growth for now.     --Will

                    Looking Back   I've been looking into my past, trying to understand my process for work and reward.  And I've found some very interesting answers.  I've never tried to find the root of my work ethics.  I've always had assumptions about them, but never really tried to understand them.  Till the other day when I remembered something... interesting.  I used to have chores, you know,  take out the trash, clean my room, mow the lawn  stuff like that.  And I had an arrangement with my parents where I did all of that and they'd give me a small allowance each week.  It was pretty good money for a kid.  I remember it being like $7 bucks a week or something like that.  And for the first few months it was great, but when our family was getting ready to make the move from Dallas to Colorado, my Mom asked if I wouldn't mind them paying me a lump sum once we finally moved.  So I agreed, wanting to help out the family, and I worked and worked for several months.  Counting the Gazillions of dollars I was gonna have once we were in the new place.  But it never came.    What's worse, is once we finally moved there, the school district held me out of classes until midway through the semester, waiting for my family to find a permanent address.  And as motivation for me, my Mom offered me $25 dollars for every "A" I got on my report card, if I worked really hard to get caught up.  No easy task, considering that the Dallas school district was way behind Denver's.  So one day I bring home a report card, my one and only report card ever with straight A's.   But no money.  Turns out it was more expensive to live in Colorado than my parents had anticipated.  I understand it now.. as an adult.  And I don't blame my parents, money really was that tight.  But the little kid in me was devastated.  And I never really tried to do good in school after that.  I mean, stresses at home, and constantly being picked on at school because I was the new kid made it a little easier to shut down.  But looking back on my whole comic book art career, it seems like I've been working in the exact same manner.  Not only did I pick a career in which the rewards are months, if not years after the work is done.  But on top of that, I put these little road blocks and qualifiers in my way in order to keep the reward just that much farther away.  I've never learned to just do something, and be rewarded for it.  Everything is this monumental task that I have to overcome, and even if I've surmounted the obstacles, the reward may still never be there.  So what does it mean?  I don't know really.  I guess that I need to retrain myself to take on small, easy to accomplish tasks, and be damn sure that there is a real reward at the end of it.  Which is what I've been trying to do in recent months.  I'm just afraid that there have been so many failures over the years.  And so many... Disappointments, that I've created a sort of "learned-helplessness" in myself.  Where I don't fear deadlines, because there's no point to it anyways, because there's never a reward for accomplishing it.  And making other people happy, just isn't enough anymore.  Well, at least I'm a little farther down the path to understanding this.   --Will

                            The Ghost In Me.   So, positive thinking didn't work exactly as I had hoped.  It got me drawing.  That's good.  But I haven't really been productive.  Something is better than nothing I suppose.  I feel really unfocused right now.  There are two or three things that I  need  to be working on.  But when I can't focus on  which  one, that's when I tend to start  another  project.  Brandon told me a couple weeks ago I need to work on my priorities.  But I've yet to get my mind settled enough to even think about it.  Maybe it's another stall tactic.  Subliminally I'm avoiding what I need to do, by fuzzing it up with indecision.  I don't know what it is.  At least when I'm drawing every day, I don't feel completely worthless.  But I need to get focused soon - times running out on some of these projects.  I hate being so undisciplined.  They're tearing down this massive grain silo on the edge of town.  I never thought I'd have such an emotional reaction to an eyesore like that.  But every time I drive past, it makes me a little sadder.  Before, each time I saw it, it was a stoic reminder of my Grandfather... he built that massive wall of concrete.  Along with hundreds of other buildings in Lubbock.  From the Godbold Cultural center (formerly St Marys hospital) To J&B Coffee shop's building, which in its day was originally a movie theater.  But that grain silo... I thought it would be there forever.  I guess, in a sense, I thought the same about my GrandDad.  But alas, they're knocking it down, one careless swing at at a time.  Progress can suck my big fat hairy toe.   I think I still carry a great deal of guilt with me over my Granddad passing away.  He was my biggest supporter.  My biggest fan (next to my Dad).  But he never got to see me succeed.  In fact, the last thing he witnessed was a string of my biggest failures.  To tell the truth, I don't think I've ever succeeded in the way I wanted, for him to feel proud of me.  I mean, he didn't have high standards, or great expectations of me.  But he left a very big legacy.  One that I may never surpass.  He was ambitious, and highly disciplined.  He was a noble and principled man.  And he did it all, lived a HUGE life.  He was a carpenter, a construction foreman, a teacher.  He trained Glider Pilots in World War II.  Was superintendent of a school district.  And he was a devout, disciplined Christian to his dying day.        And my whole childhood until I became a man, I think he always thought I could do better.  And it wasn't until way too late that I realized that he did it because... he loved me.  I mean, it's the same pressure last year, that I was putting on all those I loved.  It wasn't disappointment, or condescending, it was love.  Though it was very easy to misconstrue.  He wanted me to do my best in everything, because he knew I have that in me... somewhere.  So I went most of my life, intimidated by this amazing man.  Wanting so badly to please him, but feeling like I failed at every turn.  He was always very saddened by how overweight I was, and of course, so was I.  But we've all seen here how hard that was to turn around.  And he wanted to support my comic book stuff, he even helped fund it at many turns, which made the failures all the more humiliating before him.  When I closed up my store, I didn't even want to face him, I was so embarrassed.  I remember thinking, "I can become successful really quick somehow, and that will make up for all of this.."  But it never happened.  He passed away a week after I closed the store.  That's what I think about every time I find myself wasting opportunity.  That's all I can think about now.  How disappointed he would be.  And that grain silo disappearing, bit by bit... makes me feel like he's disappearing bit by bit.  And the more time I waste the less there will be left of him to remind me of how proud he would be when I finally  do  succede.  I know it's stupid.  But it is as it is.  I don't know how his incredible discipline got so badly lost in translation from his life to mine.  Maybe he was overbearing with my Dad, or maybe it was how my parent's style of "discipline" were completely diametrically opposed that we ended up with almost none.  I don't know... and it doesn't matter.  But it is one of my greatest struggles.  I know that it is tied to everything I hope to do with my life.  From work to money to every day living.  And not to mention my  own  kids.  So that's the struggle that I need to keep coming back to here.  I need to understand "discipline".  And I need to stop living with this Ghost.   --Will

                       Reciprocation   I've observed that when there is one problem in life - that usually it reciprocates in other parts of your life.  You'll see it all the time in symbols.  For instance, a problem you may be having will often "symbolically" manifest itself in your car.  If you're having trouble getting started in life - your starter goes out.  If you're having trouble getting work done(getting "traction") - your tires go flat.  You're having trouble keeping yourself from doing something - your brakes go out.  And if you ignore the symbols... well that's bad news.  That's when the universe decides it's time to teach you a lesson.  And that's when stuff breaks.  Either you get in an accident, or your computer crashes, or something equally ouchie.  That's why it's important to remain observant.    Anyways, I've also observed that the reciprocation works in the other direction as well.  The solutions reciprocate, that is.  For instance, my happiness.  I suddenly became happy, when I decided "I  am  happy".  I changed my perception of things.  After all disposition is merely perception.  And I realized today that I have the same issue with my productivity.  I've languished in ignorance for a couple months.  I wouldn't even acknowledge that I wasn't working enough.  I'd walk into the studio and sit down at the computer and wouldn't even let the issue of discipline, or productivity enter my mind.  I mean, I feel guilty about not working.  But not enough to make me change.  Guilt trips never did work very well with me.  So I allowed it, because there were more important things happening, with my little spiritual reawakening and all, and I recognized that.  But I'm ready to get back to work now.  And really - it's as simple as deciding that "I  am  disciplined".    I'll wake up tomorrow and know that I am required to sit down and paint.  Because I've had my play time, I've had my mental renaissance, and now it's time to get back to the drawing board.  I really don't know any other way to explain it.  Other than I've "decided" to be productive from now on.  I'll finish a painting tomorrow, and do some sequential art tue-thur and some caricature samples on friday.  But I'm obligated to do it now.  It's my job.  For at least 6-8 hours after I get out of bed and eat breakfast.  I'm sure that a few months down the road I will need to readjust my perceptions once again, and force myself back on the tracks.  But this is good, it's important to remain observant, and watch the symbols that life gives us.  But that's just my opinion.   --Will

                        Party Caricatures.   Great night tonight - I did caricatures for a couples 50th wedding anniversary party.  I hooked up my friend Nat, and had him come and do portraits with me.  Over all it was a great experience.  I did about 40 caricatures in 2 hours.   Best of all I hardly stressed at all about it.  Just did it.  And even better than best of all... We made $250 for just 2 hours of work.  Hopefully it's just the start.  By the end of the year I hope to be doing 2 or 3 parties a week, on top of my regular caricture events.    I'm trying to apply that old adage to my life -  work smarter, not harder  - I mean, how can I go back to working $7 - $10 bucks an hour for someone else - When I can make $100 bucks an hour for myself.  Entertaining people no less.   --Will

                             Brighter Meadows - Melting Sunsets   Some days you know who you are, and some days you can't remember your name.  And then there's lately, where I can't understand the man I used to be.  I've been rereading some of my old posts, and though the words sound sweet and beautiful, I no longer understand or relate to them.   I can't believe that I've changed so much so quickly.  But now the loneliness just seems so foreign to me.  I truly had fallen in love with being lonely.  I wanted to understand why though.  And I think I've found the answer, and of course it goes hand in hand with all the other stuff I've been figuring out.    My one and only previous relationship, was a fairly good one.  We loved each other very much.  And in my mind it was a very successful relationship - well, as successful as an ended relationship can be.  We are still very good friends, and will probably always be.  But looking back now, I realize that I was looking for her to complete me.  I was only half of a person, and I wanted her to make me whole.  And when the relationship ended - most likely from an subconscious awareness that I was needy and incomplete - no matter how well I tried to hide it - I was unwilling to move on  because  I was incomplete, and somewhere in me I think I was waiting to magically  become  complete without any sort of work or introspection on my part.  But it never happened.  And I wanted to hold onto whatever relationship success I'd had, just so I could look back and say that someone loved me, or that I wasn't bad at relationships, or some other such lameness.    Really what it was... I wanted to avoid my own happiness.  I wasn't ready to be happy, because I wasn't thin, wasn't successful, or because I wasn't with the perfect woman, blah blah blah.  The same excuses I've been talking about all week.  And really, I  loved  the feeling of being lonely.  Though it was very subconscious I just wanted sympathy - from my friends - from my ex - from anyone that would listen.  I craved the attention.  So I wanted to remain in my ignorance and wallow in sadness for as long as I could.  What better way to put off being happy - than to be sad!   You complete me...   I loved that line from Jerry Mcquire.  It made the whole movie for me.  Especially the way it was built up.   Cuba catching the ball, Tom Cruise running home, "you had me at hello", yada yada yada...  But now it just doesn't taste the same.  I guess I have a different perspective on things.  I don't want someone to complete me anymore.  Because it insinuates that I am not already a complete whole person - and that neither is anyone that would have me.  If you want to get literal - multiply two halves - you get one quarter.  Even if you  added  two halves you'd still only have one person.  That sucks.  I see that now, and I see a lot of what I was waiting around for was because of that skewed logic.  I mean it would be one thing, if we were both looking for someone else to complete each other, you really have to be committed to this sort of thing.  And it may work out - but like true love - its one in a million.  So I want to be a whole person now.  I want to be responsible for my own emotions, and my own actions.  I want to be complete.  And I want that in whoever I spend my life with.  I want someone that makes me better than whole.  And best of all, I want someone that is that way herself.  But we're not perfect, none of us are.  I sure as hell am not.  I'm just now stepping into the hall of maturity, to take a curious look around, hoping someday soon I will know this place like my own home.     She's a jar.. with a heavy lid...   So where does that put me now, with my current relationship.  Really it changes nothing.  Those expectations of being with a complete, whole, person (and vice versa), will never change for me.  But those expectations are for the woman I will marry.  If she grows into those things, as I hope to one day do myself, all the better.  If not, I still very much enjoy being with her.  And it's easier to enjoy a person as they are, without imposing some sort of unreasonable expectations - like them making  you  complete.  For now, I'm just happy.  I'm comfortable with someone, that's something I've never experienced with another human being.  And as long as we are happy and making healthy choices in the relationship, and continuing to grow, and continuing to put "true" intimacy before "sexual" intimacy... we will be fine.    "No worries.. No expectations.. Having fun."   --Will

                     Keeping Myself Away From Me - Part.Two     Learning to live.  We all struggle with it.  Though we are scared, and tired, and some of us just don't know what to do.  We continue to struggle to learn how to live.  It's an uncomfortable feeling to think that I've come to know less as I've grown older.  Because I did, I knew it all when I was 20.  But I guess the truth is... the uncomfortable feeling, is that as I've gotten older I've realized how much I  don't  know.  And it has humbled me.  It has brought me to my knees and brought me to ask forgiveness for my arrogance from many that I have loved.  And as I finally stand again, brushing the dirt from my humbled knees, I look around  as though for the first time.  I thank God for the gifts in my life, I thank God for keeping the wonderful things... and people in my life, in spite of my arrogance and naivite'.  Then the need to understand sets in.  I believe that God intends this life to be easier than the way I've lived it.  I believe that, in my unlearned ways, I am fighting against the natural currents of life.  The change in the last 6 weeks have proved that.  Before the only strife in my living was there because I caused it.  But I didn't know any better.  I am a helper.  I have a great need to help others.  It comes from my parents - My Mom, the social worker, wanting to help the people around her - and my Dad, the Engineer, wanting to make systems, organizations and processes better.  It's in my blood.  It's what I'm good at.  Unfortunately I've also inherited their tendency to overfocus on those things.  It's something that we're all working on.  My tendency, for as long as I can remember, was to focus on helping others, so much, that I lose myself.  And in a way, that overfocus was a tremendous issue of avoidance.  As long as I could focus on someone else's problem, and try to help them (through positive and negative processes) then I would not have to pay attention to my own inadequacies.  I could avoid being happy, as long as I could focus on making someone else happy.  I could avoid finishing work, as long as I was focused on someone else with the same issue.  I could avoid dealing with my own insecurities as long as I was focused on someone else's.  I was an  avoid-aholic .  Some people use drugs/sex/alcohol to avoid facing themselves... I used love.  And it goes back a long, long way.  But it was most prominent in my past relationships and especially in working with people in my comic book company. It took a long time to realize there was a problem.  But I remember this little voice in my head asking from time to time... "How can so many  other  people be the problem?"  But I always quickly brushed the thought away - afraid to consider it - because,  IT  was for all intents and purposes -  THE  basis of my entire structure of being.  So, sometime around the end of last summer.  When I'd pushed nearly every person I loved to the point of breaking, due to my hyper-critical behavior, and immensely high imposed expectations.  I found myself in my studio crying... broken... before one of my closest friends - one of many at the time - that I'd hurt because of my naive arrogance and misplaced intentions.  And then suddenly I realized that everyone I loved had started to resent me for it.  My world came crashing down.  The structure of my being was completely destroyed.   And I went into hiding.  It was all out of good intentions, of course.  I wasn't out trying to hurt people.  I simply have that high of a standard for myself.  And I expected anyone that implied they had similar goals as me, should also have such high standards of themselves.  But what I didn't realize, was that 99% of the population does not feel the same way about achieving their dreams.  Most people are happy just to be doing something, and if something comes of it, all the better.  So my intentions were misplaced, and misinterpreted.  And everything I knew to be true... was gone.  And it wasn't till I started breaking down that whole value system, that I realized that I was avoiding my own faults.  I was avoiding.. living.  I'm now a completely different person.  By the Grace of God.   --Will

                          Keeping Myself Away From Me - Part.One     Growing is a funny thing.  One sways between confidence and arrogance with each day the wind blows.  Struggling to  know  what you know, and fighting the fact that you know nothing at all.  My consciousness expands and contracts with each breath.  As though wisdom, like air, were some invisible entity that can only be contained within for brief moments, then exhaled once more into the ether.  Whatever it is, some days I'm a damned genious, but more often than not, I'm just as clueless as I was when I was a kid.    So what do I know now?    Nothing and everything.  I know that I have a responsiblity to be alive.  And to strive to live my life to its fullest.  I know that happiness is not something you find - it's something you are.  And I know that nothing should be taken for granted.  I also know that my biggest problem in life is avoiding myself - Keeping myself away from me - I've gone to great lengths in recent months to mend this problem.  But I must remain vigilant that I do not slip back into my old patterns.  I had become so adept at fixing other peoples problems, and planning/dreaming about the future, that I often forget to live my own life.  So I need to continue to live day to day, and focus on "What  I  need to do."  "What  my  responsibilites are." and "Who  I  am."  Those are my mantras for being a whole, complete, successful person.    I've been realizing this more of late.   --Will

                      Good, as good Goes...   I love the feeling of waking up.  And that's how I feel all the time now.  Everything has changed in the last 6 weeks.  It's like I've been tinkering with some intricate, complex machine for many years, surmising what it might do when finally turned on, how it might work if life were finally breathed into it.  That machine is now in motion.  I am alive.  I am living.  And now that I've had some time to reflect.  I've discovered that a lot of my "hypothesese" about what  'living would be like'  were correct... and some, of course, were completely wrong.  It's interesting.  I can tell you the day it started.   urlLink April 20th.   The day I decided that I  am  happy.  The day I decided to enjoy being alive, and to no longer postpone my happiness.  Since then everything has changed - I feel like I'm finally doing something towards my career - And I'm finding myself more disciplined - And I have a girlfriend - And best of all, I'm not constantly longing for happiness.  Because I have it  now .  I am happy because I  am .  Not because I'm working towards something, or because I'm with somebody or because I'm preparing myself to be happy.  Those are all things that make my life better, and make  me  better.  But I have to be happy now in order to enjoy them - not the other way around.  It's all very strange.  Actually there was a whole bunch of things I was going to talk about - but now that I think about it - they were all things that I discovered because I decided to be happy.  Stuff like realizing why I was single for 3 years - because I had fallen in love with being lonely.  Why I wasn't satisfied with finishing a comic page, or a painting, or a short story - because I wasn't finished with everything else.  And then there was my constant insecurity over being overweight.  But after deciding I  am  happy  now  - none of those things mattered anymore.  I've even been losing 1 - 2 pounds a week for the last 2 months - without even trying.  No diet, or exercise - just being happy with who I am.  It's like I'm fucking NEO and I can see every 0 and 1 in the Matrix.  I'm confident, secure, powerful.  Because my strength is no longer external.  My contentment comes from within me.   So anyways...   With all of that said, I'd like to explain why I haven't been posting much lately (other than the menial "this is what I'm up to" type of post).  It's a new month, and I've decided to take a new approach to things.  I mentioned earlier that I finally have a girlfriend (yay me!) and that it's been - what? - 3 years - something like that?  It's pretty sad really.  But it is as it is.  The thing is, now that I'm in a relationship... I've been afraid to share my thoughts about it here.  It's not like I don't have anything to say.  Far from it.  I've had more self-discovery in the last 6 weeks than I have in 3 years.  But I think my initial reluctance to posting about this, is that there's someone else to think about now... and how what I say affects her, and her world.  It's so weird, when you've been independent and alone for so long, to suddenly have to wrap your intentions and reality around someone else's.  Granted, it's a wonderful burden.  The thing is, I have nothing to hide.  If anyone has read this blog, and met me in real life, they know that I'll bore you in person word for word with nearly the same deep introspective dribble that I write up here.  It's just the way I am.  I'm not trying to be honest, or deep... that's just the way I talk to  anyone .  I'm transparent like a sliding glass door - I couldn't hide my thoughts if I wanted to.  So I'm talking again.  I have a lot to say.  There are many details that I'll have to leave out - but the lessons learned -  and the questions answered - those I will begin again to share.   --Will

       Something's Missing...   Ever since I've been back I've felt that way. I think I left my heart in San Diego... as cliche' as that sounds. Somewhere on those rocky cliffs over-looking the pacific ocean. I left a part of me behind. Because nothing feels the same here any longer. My students, though passionate and engaging - are only partly of interest any more. The caricatures seem pointless and futile, in comparison to the market and support I could be getting somewhere else. Even my friends and family, whom I love greatly... seem to be somewhere far way from me. It's all very bittersweet. It seems, these days that my only solace has been found while painting, and drawing. Which I suppose is at least comforting.   "You keep adding stones and soon the water will be lost in the well."   I've put a lot into this town. Into loving everything about it. Appreciating all it's little nuances and hidden treasures. But it feels like I've reached the limits of what this town has to offer me. Or more likely... I've realized that I've reached  MY  limits of what I have to offer this town. For years now I have craved a mentor... a new standard, an example of success to learn from. And after a few days of being submersed in an entire microcosm that embodies that, and speaking with dozens of success stories in San Diego, I know I'm in the wrong place. And I no longer want to be here. My hearts just not in it. And it seems as though God is sending some pretty hard core signals my way these days, all of which seem to be pushing me down this path..  There's just a different way of thinking in Lubbock. It seems like people "dream big" but don't "think big." I can't count the number of big dreams I've heard from the people around me. But the number of success are less than a handful. I think it comes from the way things are set up here. I realized from having my friend Jay from Houston here how different things really are. When we were living in Houston and we got a wild-hare to do something, we'd go to 7 or 8 different stores looking into it. Theres dozens of comic shops, model shops and any type of shop you can imagine, the resources and options are much more plentiful. But here... if you want to do something, it takes a lot of balls, and a lot of leg work to get ANYthing done. No wonder everything's half-assed here. But whatever. And I can't even imagine growing up here and knowing only that. If I hadn't spent all my time growing up in Dallas, Denver and Houston, I'd feel pretty fucked, pretty apathetic and narrow-minded. Not saying that's how everyone here is... just how I would probably be. I would feel so stifled if I'd never known all the resource i've known in other places. And then to compare that to the success I've seen in individuals in San Diego... it's just hard to come back to Lubbock.  Anyways, Just so everyone is clear... I know that San Diego isn't going to fix me. It simply offers more opportunities to succede. I know I have to work on the issues that have held me back my entire life before I go, or else they'll just follow me wherever I end up... That's what baggage does right?   I guess this is sort of a disclaimer, I'm not going to be talking a lot about San Diego here on out. Not here or around my friends. I hate the awkwardness that surrounds the issue. I'll just quietly work and prepare myself and leave when it's time to go. But I hate long goodbyes, and I definitely hate the awkwardness. I WILL probably be going through my baggage though. Because that affects me no matter WHERE I am.     --Will

                        San Diego Comic-Con - Day FOUR            SATURDAY     Still feeling kind of checked out of the con, I didn't hit nearly as many panels on Saturday either. I did spend a little time wandering around the convention though. I bought a few great books that I'd been looking forward to. One was  urlLink FLIGHT  from a group of 7 fantastic artists. They're all very talented people still trying to break into the industry. Anyways, I'd been tracking the progress of the book for months on several of the artists websites independently, but when I actually saw it in print I had to grab it. The colors in the book are amazing and well worth checking out if you get the chance. I also picked up a couple books from another artist named  urlLink Sam Hiti  who I've been a fan of for some time. I've loved his website for about a year now, and check it pretty regularly for his fantastic wacky style of art.     And then last I picked up a couple of art instruction books that I'd lost back when I had the studio. Will Eisner's Comics and the Sequential Art and Scott Macloud's Understanding Comics. For the life of me I couldn't remember where they went. I bought the Eisner book last year at Comic-con and never even got the chance to read it. Then suddenly as I'm checking out from Bud Plant's booth I flash back to last year. I finally remember Rod loaning them to his girlfriend just before they broke up. When he was still trying to get her to do comics. So I guess they are forever lost to the void of ex-girlfriend land. Not the first time, I lost another $50 bucks worth of books to another of his former flames as well. Guess I need to keep a tighter leesh on my library. C'est La Vie.     I ended the Convention day with Jeff Watt's Panel on Gestural Portrait painting. It was fantastic to see an entire painting done in less than an hour. And to hear the instruction that went along with it. I can imagine taking an entire semester of classes in the same vein. Too bad I was so frazzled from the long weekend to truly absorb it. Luckily though I got the entire thing on video to watch at a later time, in a more lucid state of mind.     After the show we all decided to drive up to L.A. It was probably a mistake, seeing as how it took nearly 2 and a half hours just to drive there, and it was already late when we started. But I think we were all of the mind that it may be a LONG time before we get the opportunity to check it out again. I was very impressed with the size of the city. That goes without saying. But it was very overwhelming. I consider myself a city boy. I love cities... but this was too much. It didn't help that I heard Gunshots ten minutes into town, and police helicopters hovering nearby overhead with their searchlights blazing. Nope. Not so much. We drove down Sunset, and Beverly Hills. Lots of pretty people, lots of showing off, lots of arrogance. Not really my thing. The word that kept running through my mind was Juvenile. Kids showing off... even late into their 40's. Like some  "big-swinging dick"  competition. So we left. Spent maybe an hour in town. I know it's not really fair to base the opinion of an entire city on one hour. But whatever.     San Diego has a very small town feel to it. Despite being such a big city. It seems like the more I go there the more it feels that way. But LA... LA is HUGE... I'd say it were 5 times the size of the Dallas/Ft Worth Metroplex if I had to guess. The buildings were taller, the lights were brighter, and the entire thing is surrounded by these hills and mountains, all of which are inundated with more cities. But it was the people that mostly got to me. The other drivers, the asshole cops at every turn, the trendy dilettantes primping for each other... the general attitude of everyone we came across. Juvenile. But that's just me.  Needless to say, we headed back to San Diego pretty quickly and crashed out for the night.             --Will

        San Diego Comic-Con - Day THREE    FRIDAY   After the conclusions I'd come to by the end of day TWO of the convention. I sort of felt "done" with the show. I was ready to just go home and get back to work. Start saving money and planning the task of moving my life 1500 miles away. It's been years since I went to a convention for any reason other than business. I don't buy stuff, I rarely buy anything other than supplies, how-to books or other artists sketchbooks. I'm not there for autographs or rare items. I'm there to network, learn and become a better artist. But after realizing that I hadn't necessarily been doing anything wrong these past few years, that I was perhaps in the wrong place - wrong environment - wrong people. I started to look back on the last 7 years of my career. Placing it all on the west coast... how different it would have been. Instead of ONE comic book store in town there would be 30. Instead of traveling 8 hours for the nearest convention I would have dozens within 2 hours of me. Instead of having to travel semi-annually to get critiques on my work from other artists, I would be completely surrounded by a community of artists better than me, pushing me, challenging me, making me grow. But "What-If? ing" only drives you MAD after time. It's just that it hit me like a scene in some horror movie, when you suddenly realize that everything you ever knew to be true was a lie. It's hard to recover from that quickly.  Luckily beaches have wonderful recuperative properties. Waves lapping at your feet, sunsets, and that soothing sound of the tides crashing around you. Especially Torrey Pines. It's probably one of the most beautiful beaches I'd ever seen... granted the number of beaches I've been to can be counted on one hand. But still.  I did manage to spend some time at the convention. But out of the 20 or so panels I was planning to check out, I only managed 2 of them. The first was Jeff Smith's Panel discussing the completion of his 55 issue independently published series  urlLink BONE . I suppose it's appropriate this was one of the only panels I caught. Bone was a big reason for me starting down the self-publishing path. He was also the first student of  urlLink Dave Sim's (Cerebus)  self-publishing wisdom, to really implement all the tools that Dave developed. He was and still is one of the most successful examples of the entire self-publishing process. Jay and I both started into comics when Bone was first beginning. I remember the first issue hitting shelves. I remember the first graphic novel collection. I also remember how ground-breaking it was that someone collected all their books into a thick book to resale. Its common practice now. But at the time it was revolutionary. I mean, Dave had done it for years, but no one considered it outside of Cerebus. That is till Bone came along.  Anyways, seeing him with his $100, single volume, Leather bound, HardCover collection of the entire 55 issue series made a lot of things clear to me. He set out 10 years ago to do a series. He spent ten years doing it, and now it is finished. It's as simple and clear cut as that. The man can now retire if he wanted to. He's not... but he could. It's an impressive idea to say the least. And to make things even more spectacular, he is the spear head of a new movement.  urlLink Scholastic books  have picked up bone to start a new line of graphic novels to sell to schools. It is a monumental breakthrough for our industry. It means Jeff is going from selling 30,000 copies a month of his book... to Millions. Imagine that change. And it was totally unexpected. He was done. He had no more plans for the book and now this. Fantastic.   --Will

                                   San Diego Comic-Con - Day TWO       So this is just a disclaimer. The next 4 or 5 posts may be a little boring. They're mostly my journal from the convention, lots of business observation and industry babble. So forgive the mundane nature for the next few days. But who knows.. maybe you're into that sort of thing.        THURSDAY     This year we took the train to the convention center each day. I was all about making this years trip as low stress as possible. And avoiding the Comic-Con's crazy-ass parking and traffic was high on my priorities. Interestingly enough, SD expanded their trolley system quite a bit in the last year. And there was a station at the mall about a mile from our hotel. So we each bought 5-day passes and used them to our full advantage. Very convenient. That and there's just something fun about riding a train every day.     So we each had stuff we wanted to do at the show. Jays' a big game design buff. He even went to the Arts Institute of Houston for a few years learning to do just that, as well as animation. So the comic-con was a great experience for him. It's funny that he and I went to our first real convention together back in high school. It was neat to share in this Con with him all these years later. So after wandering around together for a little while we split up. Adrienne and I spent most of the first day together while Jay went off to do his thing.     I started off with a "networking" seminar. It turns out I'd been to it before, in fact I'd been to it at my very first Comic-Con and he was handing out the same (albeit useful) information as he was back then. But it was redundant for me, so I left, and ended up standing around in the hall outside the room talking with Adrienne. When suddenly someone comes running up to me asking me where the DC portfolio reviews were being held. As I was thumbing through the program book looking for the info he started showing me and Addy his portfolio. I couldn't resist, I started into a critique and started giving him some loose tutorials right there on the floor in the hall. It was funny. We actually started to draw a small crowd. Then as we're getting up to leave I suddenly realize that we were sitting in the exact same spot I got my first critique back in 97. Right there in the middle of the hallway sitting cross-legged with a small crowd gathering round. Full Circle.     Anyways, for me - there seemed to be a common theme running through the entire show. It started with the first panel of the day (that I actually stuck around) with  urlLink Stephen Silver . Silver is an animation designer. He does character designs for a lot of my favorite shows. Kim Possible being number one. He did all the character designs for the first two seasons. Anyways, somewhere around the middle of his panel he started talking about doing caricatures. It seemed to come out of the blue, but then it became a central theme. He said that doing caricatures, at parks, and malls and theme parks is what he attributes a strong part of his success to. And he kept emphasizing that everyone in the audience get into it as a career. Then he went into saying the same thing about life-drawing. The funny part is that some of it was verbatim what I had said to the artist in the hall. It's always interesting when you get reinforced that you seem to be on the right track.    Continuing with the Theme. Later on I found myself in front of the Watts Atelier booth asking some questions. Court Jones was the instructor that started asking me questions. Turns out he teaches Caricatures at the Atelier. And he spent the last few years working as a caricature artist at SeaWorld San Diego. He, like Silver, went on to say that Caricatures was one of the best things that ever happened to him artistically. He also mentioned what it was like doing caricatures at Sea World. They pretty much do it all for you, they give you the supplies, the tools, the training and they hold your hand and give you an enormous support group of other artists to bounce styles and skills off of. I was drooling at the thought of having, not just one other artist around to encourage me and challenge me to draw better, but 25. I kick my ass every week at the flea market to try and make a small living and teach myself these skills. And these guys have it handed to them in a neat little package, and where they can earn $250 a day in the summer. So the theme... as you can see... is that I'm definitely in the wrong place.     It seemed to repeat over and over all weekend. From the ShaneGlines Sketchbook group - full of professional animators I might add - meeting once a week at a coffee shop to just "draw!" To the Atelier, full of working animators, game designers, conceptual artists and professional comic book artists "already" working in the industry. Throw in sea world, where I'd be doing what I'm doing already, but getting real support (and money) for it. I am most definitely, unquestionably, irrefutibly... in the wrong place.     I've craved artistic camaraderie for years. I've done everything I can think of to make it work in Lubbock. I've tutored, published, apprenticed, networked, and supported every artist I've run across. Just in hopes of finding a handful of artists to compete, and grow with. And out of the hundred or so artists I've worked with over the last 8 years... well, I'm still alone. For whatever reason. Lubbock may be cheaper, and more convenient to live in than San Diego... but it sure as hell isn't worth what you have to give up. At least that's what I'm finally realizing.            --Will

                            San Diego Comic-Con - Day ONE       So this is just a disclaimer. The next 4 or 5 posts may be a little boring. They're mostly my journal from the convention, lots of business observation and industry babble. So forgive the mundane nature for the next few days. But who knows.. maybe you're into that sort of thing.      WEDNESDAY     My tradition for going to San Diego is to drive. It's a bit of insanity mixed with the love of the road. It's a 24 hour drive from Lubbock to San Diego. But if timed well you can hit some gorgeous countryside, and get to the coast in time to check into the Hotel and Convention early and have time to just relax about. Our timing was off by about 3 hours early this time around. That is, for everything except pulling up to the sound of waves crashing on the cliffs at 6 am in an misty magical overcast morning. That made the entire trip... to that point and any point after... completely worth while to me. In fact, the last year finally felt worth while after 10 minutes of sitting on this cliffside. It's funny the things you crave after living in a desert for so long.     Anyways, we were way early for everything the rest of the day. Too early to get badges, too early to get a room, we were even too early to go to the outdoor mall. Everything was closed. But whatever. Better early than late. So it was dragass-wednesday, the entire first half of the day. In the evening, Adrienne crashed out, she hadn't had any sleep at all, not even in the car for some reason. So I took Jay to preview night at the Comic-Con. We walked around the convention floor and I showed him where everything, and everyone was. It turned out better this way I think, so he wasn't completely overwhelmed going at it alone when this monster show finally opened on Thursday. We got lots of free stuff, talked to some of the  urlLink Shane Glines Artist  group from LA and wrapped the evening with chatting a little with Mike Mignola and getting sketches in his Convention exclusive Hellboy sketchbook.     afterwards Jay and I drove up to Encinidas to check out the  urlLink Jeff Watts Atelier . It's an art school designed after the old masters way of teaching art. I've been wanting to check this place out for the last couple years, actually... ever since my first Comic-Con in '97. I don't know what it was. Maybe San Diego tempting me, or me wanting to be tempted. But there was something magical about being there. The school's tucked away in a small center at the top of a steep hill in this California mountain. The mist was still prominent and all around as we leaned against the car in front of the school talking. The doors to the building were open and light streamed out carrying the echoes of teaching voices from within. I walked into the front office to admire the incredible framed sketches adorning the walls. Listening to the instruction from down the hall. One of the outer classrooms was also open and I peeked in to see the dozen or so students enthralled in the night's lesson. I soaked in the atmosphere for a good 20-30 minutes before we finally sloaked away, back down the mountain.     It was a good first day. Very low stress, very comforting. A complete contrast to the madness of last years show. And it pretty much stayed that way the entire trip.          --Will

                               San Diego Comic-Con - BACK AGAIN!!!      We got back from the trip this morning around 6 am. The trip was fantastic. I would put it up there as one of my all time favorites. And it was hella better than last year. Last year kind of sucked the more I think about it. Anyways, lots of pictures, lots of video and lots to say. The trip was terrific.     Now getting back to Lubbock sucked hardcore. This has been one of the crappiest days I've had in a looong time. I try to keep things into perspective. Crappiness tends to be an indicator that the universe is in hardcore guidance mode, single handedly tailoring the path I'm on to guide me in the right direction. That's what I keep telling myself at least. It's not so easy to think that way when the craptitude is really ripe.    Anyways, before I blog about the Con, and what I'm taking away from the whole experience, I think I need to let it sit and simmer for a few days to make sure what I was thinking is what I think I'm thinking. You know... life changing decisions and all. I will say this though - I can check off 12 of the 27 things I wanted to do while I'm 27 (see 1/28 journal). And I've still got 3 months to go.        --Will

                     San Diego Comic-Con     Couple things. I'm heading out to the Comic-Con in the morning with my girl Adrienne and my best friend from Houston Jay Fleming. I'm so looking forward to this trip. I kinda wish we coulda left a few days ago, but hey, no worries. I'll take lots of pictures and upload them as soon as I get back. I'm stoked, I'm gonna talk to some editors and other artists and pitch a couple stories to a few publishers while I'm there. And best of all, I'm gonna attend as many panels as I can. That's my favorite part.    Second. My best friend Brandon finally has his own blog. Visit  urlLink "Oops... I arted!"  now.  It's not just a blog urlLink  , he's posting weekly cartoon strips. So far he's got about 10. He's trying to make each one better than the last. So go check out his site, give him some comments and good feedback, and check back regularly. He's a great guy and deserves all sorts of lovin. So share the love.       --Will

                     APPLESEED!!!!!!      My all-time favorite Manga and Anime Appleseed is being made into a new movie. Completely done in CGI. It looks so gorgeous. The animation on this is so crisp, and the colors are beautiful. Everything I'd envisioned the Manga to be. I hope they show this at the Comic-Con.     Here's a  urlLink couple   urlLink previews.      The strange thing about the series, is that even though the Manga came out in the late 80's early 90's it seems remarkably relevant to the times now. Some of Massamune Shirrow's themes throughout much of the series - is all about Muslim extremism - and how the west had ignored it for so long, that they became the scourge that could no longer be avoided. Suicide bombers, Religious fanaticism, and the wests obliviousness to it all. It's amazing how he pegged it so long ago... then again maybe it's not, it's pretty much always been this bad, but now it's our blood being spilled.      --Will

                             Comic Art Classes - Week Two       I taught my second couple of classes today. I never got around to writing about the first class. I love teaching. I always have. I guess it's in my blood; my family has a long line of teachers. My grandfather was not only a teacher, but he was even superintendent of a school district. So it's just in my nature. But I rarely feel worthy of the mantle. It has always felt like I was someone that knew just a little more about some things than those around me, but I had some minute difference in my genetic make-up that puts a wild-hare up my ass to make me think I should share what I know. But today was different. Everything was clear. The words came with ease, phrasing and re-phrasing to pass along little nuggets of knowledge. And for the first time I felt like I truly had a firm grasp on not only drawing anatomy, but teaching it. Michelangelo I am not. But I am definitely far from where I was the first time I attempted to share my wisdom.     Anyways, I try to remain humble about this all. It often seems like the moment I feel I have a grasp on something, the substance changes and it sifts through my fingers. But a small part of me finds great pride in the fact, that some of these kids might one day become one of the greats of our industry. And they'll look back on their lives and say "that guy" helped me do this. I guess a legacy of sorts. I am the hopeless optimist. Finding potential in every seed. Doing what I can to nurture and provide what I know for it to grow. In hopes that one day I may sit in the shade of some great oak that lasts through the ages.     Then again... maybe its just what I always wanted for myself.        --Will

                        San Diego Comic-Con 2004   I'm stoked.  I just got my confirmation for my Comic-Con convention badge.  It looks like everything is ready to go now.  Hotel, Car and Con reservations are all set.  My best friend from Houston Jay Flemming (whom I haven't seen in nearly 10 years) is coming into town Sat to drive down to the show with us.  My lovely girlfriend's got clearance for her to go.  And somehow... Miraculously, I've come up with more than enough money for me to go.  From random commissions, caricatures and a last minute surge in people registering for my Saturday classes.  The only downside... now that everythings good to go.. I can't wait to get going.  Consequently I can hardly focus on what I need to be doing from now until Tuesday when we leave.  Oh well.    By the way, it looks like my eBay sales thingy bombed.  I had a couple of bids, but it was for the utmost minimum.  I think people may not even be bothering to bid because there is a hidden reserve price.  I don't know a lot about this eBay crap, and I'm probably too impestuous to put in the time it takes to figure it out.  Maybe if I sold prints of my work, so that I wouldn't have to worry about a reserve price, people would be less hesitant to bid?  I don't know.  There's a couple seminars at the Comic-Con about selling art through eBay, I'll check them out to see if it's worth the trouble.  I know some guys that make $1000 a month off of little pen/ink sketches on eBay.  Stuff that takes them about 30 minute each.  So its worth considering.  I'm sort of waiting for the comic-con before I make any new decisions... or reaffirm some old ones.  Is that wrong?  I think I'll have to talk about that more later.  It's a big thought puddle I need to sort through pretty soon.  But later.  Also, my girlfriend left a little note on my car today.  It was sweet.  Made me smile.  Don't know why I needed to share that.   --Will

       Life Drawing - Week Three   I love life drawing.  It's like taking a deep breath.  I always feel sort of like I'm holding my breath and really focusing when I'm drawing from my head.  But when I'm drawing from life, there is no thinking, there is no stress.  It's just seeing, and reacting.  Letting your hand move freely with the pencil the way it's always wanted, but was too frustrated to do from my own head.  This week saw some great breakthroughs I think.  I'm really going deeper into the figure, trying to capture more shadows, tones and foreshortening.  I still need to go bigger and with different media.  But it will have to wait till I've got more cash to throw around.  By the way, the last drawing is not actually from life, it's from a photo sometime last week.  But I liked it anyways.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      --Will

       "The worst day... since yesterday."   I appreciate everyone's advice and support. It's all been very helpful, and I think things are on a much better course now. I just wanted to thank you guys and let you know I appreciate you. I have good friends.  I think I needed to start fixing things from the ground up, and that's what a lot of this has been about. I needed to start with a good foundation, and work on clearing up all my little weaknesses and inadequacies. All my  under-the-rug-sweeping  and  blind-eye-turning  that I've let drag me down all these years. I guess this is essentially the Universe telling me "Hey... if ye'are really serious about fexing theengs.. thes is where ye heve ta start boyo" Because the universe has an irish accent. I bet the Universe drinks a lot and sings drunken old folk songs badly out of tune as well. Here's to stout and hollers. Here's to tomorrow, and today.  Here's to finally wiping the  Shite  away.

       Symbols and Signs...   Things are not going so well. I've had a rough couple of weeks. Mostly, I can't seem to shake this pervasive feeling of helplessness that seems to have inundated my life. The alternator went out on my truck, so I can't leave the house, can't do the caricatures on the weekend because theres just too much equipment to haul around in a car. Then my computer is hatin on me. I can't use it more than 4 or 5 minutes without it freezing up, and me having to reboot. That makes it really hard to get any work done, especially when it doesn't always remember what I've saved. But worst of all I've run out of money. Before I left for California I was expecting a few checks for work that I'd completed, and none of them have come in, and one in particular, I was expecting from the place that I teach classes, isn't coming at all. It turns out they overpaid me on my previous check, but someone didn't know that and they told me I was getting another substantial check after I got back. One that would have covered all of my expected expenses. (I think their math is  still  wrong.. but whatever) So to recap, I have no vehicle to go anywhere, no money to do anything even if I wanted to go somewhere, and my main source of productivity is being frustratingly anti-productive. Thus... Creativity = Zilch.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time I've been in this situation. The inherant downside to being self-employed, is the razor-thin line that you work between financial  poverty  and "getting by". One slip, and you're suddenly behind the curve. And since there's only you to blame/depend on, it can easily lead one down a spiral of depression. Making it even harder to pull yourself out. Me... I watch tv. Used to play on the internet... but as previously stated, my computer is butt-hurt. Zoning out in front of the tv - distracting myself - keeps me up till 4 or 5 am sometimes. Which means I get up late, which means I'm even LESS productive. Add into that I've been pretty much waiting around lately for my parents to go out to eat so I can tag along to get my fast food fix. I have pretty much wasted the last 3 weeks. And the next few aren't looking much better.  Why am I sharing this? Why should you care? I have no idea really. Maybe some of you out there have been through the viscous cycle that creativity ensues. When it works, its beautiful, when it doesn't, it's torture. But whatever, rehashing this stuff isn't helpful.  What I need to do is deal with the feeling of helplessness. I know it's all mental-- well, computer problems and alternators are very real. But if you really think about it they're only symbols of a larger problem. Just like the alternator, I'm not letting my starter engage, I'm not properly channeling my power to my engine. I'm just sort of sitting around like I'm waiting for something. Course sometimes I get sick of my own metaphysical bullshit. What I really want to do is just go get a job and get a nice little DVD collection like everyone else. I want to buy nice clothes for myself for once in my life. Or a bed. I want a paycheck that I can rely on every week. I want to feel financially responsible again. I'm tired of living hand-to-mouth. I'm sure its possible to be financially independant in Lubbock doing something you love... but apparently I don't have what it takes.  Or maybe my hearts just not in it anymore.  So I dont know what to say.  I dont really have another plan.  I've got a wierd timeline that I have to deal with.  I'd like to have an hourly job NOW making at least $10 an hour.  But I've got 2 more caricature events at the end of September that I've already invested in.  So I can't very well get a job and request off nearly 2 weeks right after I start the job.  That doesnt make the next 6 weeks any easier.  Who knows maybe after making a little money this weekend again will make me feel better.  But we'll see.  We'll see what the rest of the signs point to.   --Will
