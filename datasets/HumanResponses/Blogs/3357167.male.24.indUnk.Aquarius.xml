      Using Cellphone is one of the most common&nbsp;means of communicating other people nowadays.&nbsp; Here in the academy it is true not only with other people but it is badly needed for&nbsp;communicating love ones.&nbsp; We are confined in the four walls of the academy and using&nbsp;cellphone is the fastest way to commuicate them.&nbsp; Our studies sometimes being sacrifice because of texting, in fact some cadets become&nbsp;text addicts already, hehe..&nbsp; Last week&nbsp;i dispose my cellphone.. Goodbye&nbsp;texting!.. thats me now. &nbsp;I have to focus on my studies.&nbsp; But that is not the only reason.&nbsp; The real score ladies and gentlemen using a cellphone here in the academy is a risk.&nbsp; Using this unit was covered by so many rules and regulations, for safety purposes it is better that I should not use cellphone anymore.

      life here in the academy is full of challenges. We are always busy and always in double time.&nbsp; During my vacant period i have lots of things to do like, studying, washing clothes, fixing my room, follow up underclass, letter writing, surfing the net and many other vaultfiles..&nbsp; If you have talent especially in sports you have so many opportunity to compete outside.&nbsp; Like me, im a member of marathon corps squad and we always sent to manila and some other places to participate in marathon.&nbsp; Last sunday we've been in quirino grandstand in manila, we joined the 28th milo national marathon competeng with thousands of runners, i got in 30th place with a time of 36 minutes.&nbsp; I still need more pratice to improve my performance but, my time is not enough because of so many activities and academics here. My vacant period cannot be utilized for me to practice because it is closed call and we are confined inside barracks.&nbsp;

      saturdays and sundays are the most memorable days in the lyf of a cadet.. during these days we used to rot and make happy. During saturdays we've experienced the most tiring part of cadets lyf. During friday night cadets are sleepless preparing things, fixing the room, ironing uniform, shining shoes, shining metal parts of uniform, follow-up underclassmen and etc. We are usually doing this in preparation of barracks inspection, ranks inspection and parade and review every saturday. Every saturday is a challenge and it adds up to our prestige everytime we overcome this day. During saturday morning barracks and ranks inspection, parade and review was done. During the afternoon cadets serving punishment take a tour around the boromeo field in BDA under arms to serve their punishment. While cadets who are snappy and not defficient in academics can have a privilege to go out in baguio city to visit their friends and poster parents otherwise cadets can entertain their visitors and friends inside the portals of the academy. Last friday night i went to sleep at 0100 at woke-up at 0430. First, i fixed my bunks and take a bath. I change my uniform for the sword and rifle drill early mess at 0530. at 0600, we rehearse the whole sequence of parade and review. We went back to barracks at 0700 to finalize our things. at 0745 i change my uniform to full dress white under arms for the barracks inspection at 0800, im happy coz i don't have any report of violations and demerits. At 0845 we went outside the barracks at quezon ave. for the ranks inspection, i got one report(loose thread, hehe). We are standing under the sun for an hour and went to the slope(the starting point of the parade). Usually, we waited for a long time before the start of the parade but that tym we only have 10 minutes and the parade starts. After the parade we have our noon mess at 1130. At 1250 we have the opening ceremony of our intramurals every companies have their muses. the assigned judges selects the best muse to represent the ccafp intramurals. the hawk company muse won, she is the former miss phillipines international and at present modeling at mexico. After the ceremony at 1600, 2cl and 1cl cadets went to baguio city for inviting privilege for the upcoming formal dinner and hop on august 21. we went back to pma at 2230. During sundays we have our religious services where in cadets went to their respective churches of their religion to worship. At sunday afternoon cadets who are serving punishment once again will tour around the boromeo field while those who does'nt have punishment enjoys the rest of the weekend. This sunday after the religious service all 2cl and 1cl cadets was given privilege to visit their poster parents. And i have visited too my poster parents. Now, another weekend will pass and another academic week to face...may god bless us all, always!
