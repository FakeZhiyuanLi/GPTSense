       urlLink     Fearless living is not a book you can summarize in chapters really.  It is filled with practical ways of removing fear from your life.    An example of this is an exercise to find out what triggers your wheel of fear.  Fear is a cycle which goes round and round, each time making you feel worse and more positive that your fear is perfectly justified.  This book also talks about expectations and how we should not have expectations ruling our lives.  Expectations need to become intentions and people around us need to be told what's up.  Rhonda's book is well written and honest.  She doesn't hestite to reveal her story boots and all.  To me, that makes her very courageous.  From the Christian perspective, this book is a little secular, but it is easy to place things into a God-based thought pattern.  If you feel that there are things holding you back and you don't even have to name them as fear, Read this book!

       Every negative experience however fleeting, can be a lesson in fear that is well learned by our subconscious minds.  The result is the all-too-familiar heart racing and palm sweating, as well as the suppression of the immune system and of the activity of the brain concerned with the short term memory, inhibition, and rational thought.   You can't delete fear but you can control it.   Fear = Fear is both the cause and effect of feelings, thoughts, or actions that prohibit you from accepting yourself and realizing your full potential.   Somehow humiliation trumps approval every time and proves to you once again that your fear of not being good enough is true.   When you manage fear, it keeps you off track by telling you to focus on the circumstantial issues of life rather than the actual fear itself.  Therefore, the fear is making decisions for you passively, unconsciously, and reactively.   Our Fear process: -Fear is triggered of us having a serious character flaw. -Fear response happens.  The behaviour we choose confirms this to ourselves. -You haven't avoided fear so negative feelings come (ie I am not good enough). -Self loathing which becomes a generalization. -Forth, self destructive behaviours ie drinking or eating (to inappropriate levels).   Fear is just an affirmation of your growth.   To be on the wheel of freedom (from fear): -Identify your true self. -Engage in proactive behaviours. -Think about your self as a while. -Self affirming behaviour.   Each failed expectation confirms our worst fear.   Your actions are colored by your frustrated expectations.   When you expect something from somebody else but never express that expectation, you are asking the other person to be a mind reader.   When you live with intention, your primary focus is the process rather than the end result.   Expectation driven people go for the goal no matter what - no matter how frustrating or out of synch with reality.

      ~~by Pastor Richard Wurmbrand   If you have never read this book before it will change your thinking on a global scale of what it means to be a child of God and the high cost many are paying even with their lives for their unfailing faith in Jesus Christ..   The book is a miracle of sorts.. because Pastor Wurmbrand wrote it only 3 short days after his prison release and he himself says it is of no literary value yet God has chosen to bless this book and those who have read it..  Pastor Wurbrand suffered 14 years of imprisonment and his story has been translated into at least 70 languages and millions of copies have been distributed world wide..   Tortured for Christ not only reveals the facts surrounding a man who has suffered at the hands of a brutal communist regime (of which he speaks both with love and forgiveness as much as he speaks of the brutality and its imprint on his life and others) and it reveals the faith and perseverance of a man totally committed to Christ and his desire to share this truth with others.   There are also many other stories sprinkled throughout the pages of this book, it is hard to understand the cruelty and hatred many Christians have had to live with yet.. throughout this book there are so many shining examples of the power of God working in the most amazing ways..    It talks about the immense work of the Underground Church and how even the most brutal treatment has not blotted out faith in God but only served to drive many to a deeper and more intense faith and greater understanding of all that God is and can give to a soul..    It shares an utter starvation of men, women and children for spiritual food and meaning in their lives of which even amongst people who have never been taught and who have been indoctrinated that there is no God.. can still find Him..     Bibles that we take for granted to have freely in our homes are in many countries torn into sections and handed out secretly to those who are fortunate enough to get them.. And the tortures, the brutal tortures and deprivations still go on today.. they have not stopped.. so many need our prayers and support and our resources.. and unless we are aware how can we know that we can do something to help.. That is what this book does.. gives us an awareness of what has happened and still happens today and gives practical advice on ways to help..    Here are some quotes.. concerning this book..   "This book was singularly instrumental in awakening the conscience of the free world to the horrors experienced by our brothers and sisters behind the Iron Curtain." ----Chuck W. Colson, Prison Fellowship   "The trial and persecution and cruelty that the Wurmbrands endured is timely as the day this compelling work was written.  The world over, Christians continue to suffer for their faith.  Among their number and men and women of whose struggles we have yet to learn, but of those travail Richard Wurmbrand has given us a searing, and ultimately redeeming, vision." ---- Gary L. Bauer, Family Research Council   There is so much more I could write about this book.. but I believe no words of mine could eloquently enough share what this book says.. It is hard to put down because you can not fathom how anyone could suffer so great a trials yet for many their faith is still so rock solid.. That is the power of God within them to do that.. it could be no other.. The sheer numbers of believers that have been killed and tortured is hard to understand and yet it is still happening so much today.. Thankfully I can share with you that the message of love, forgiveness and hope still shines even in the darkest parts of this book and they are inspiring and moving.. That Gods love knows no bounds is the great message through this book..   If for any other reason but to open your eyes and raise your awareness is a good enough reason to read this book.. and maybe you might be moved in Spirit to do something to help...
