       Simplicity is freedom-   Freedom for the restless urge to accumulate,   Freedom from the slavish need to please everbody,   Freedom to do what's best.    &nbsp;  Simplicity is abundance-    The overflow of a spirit released     From thecompulsion to do more, to get more...   A spirit released to be more.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Today I haven't done too much so far...     I woke up at krista's not too long ago(she's at vball camp whoopin some other vball players butts! :P ) so i'm just chillin around here crib.&nbsp;Alot of last night was really cool..but the other part sucked :/ ...     &nbsp;   the good part:     *krista and i were just hangin out and PeTrIe came over!..jeez we haven't seen him in FoReVeR and he just lives down the street..so he tought us how to play poker and now were experts 8-)&nbsp; lol      *later tom hayden and NiCk MuElLEr came over (haven't seen him in 1 1/2 years! great to see him again!) and we hung out, played a lil poker and i kicked theyre lil white bootys cuz tom thought a 5 was a 9 haha then we went outside and rode camdawgs scooter and watched them try to..light eachother on fire? haha then they went home     *me and stupid krooton just chilled and found out that eric can't type with doggy balls! hahaha     *found out about a special someone likin me! :D     &nbsp;   the bad part:      *found out one of my good frienz is a drug dealer     *found out another one of my best frienz has&nbsp;smoked..then lied about if for like 2 yrs. :/     *a couple ppl wer mad at me for who knows what     &nbsp;   ^hmm how nice     &nbsp;   lol well today i think i'm gonna try to hang back out with tom and nick before he goes back to San Antonio then maybe later gettin together with some other ppl?      &nbsp;   write back later !     &nbsp;   -eMiLy*     &nbsp;   LiKiN *HiM* lOtS!!
