      I am happy to report that it looks like I really did Ovulate!  I just hope that my temperature doesn't take a nose dive like it has in the past and I end up with yet another annovulatory cycle.   I've been having some weird sensations the last day or so.  It's almost like I have cramps really low in my abdomen.  Kinda what I feel when I'm pregnant.  I don't want to get my hopes up because it's still really early, and everything could go the opposite way than I am thinking it is.  I'm trying to think of some ways to help pass these next few weeks so I don't dwell on what could or couldn't be.  Tonight I'm going with my SIL to the Florence Freedom game. (They are our new Minor League Team)  It should be pretty fun, we are going with a bunch of people that she works with.  I'm not to fond of some of them but hey it beats a night home by myself. Plus if I get to bored with them I can always go off and find some of the people I work with since they will be there too.   In other unrelated news my brother turns 22 on my test date.  That still shocks the crap out of me.  On fathers day I got some rather intresting news regaurding my brother.  Come to find out his squad is being down sized and he has a few options.  One he can go back to school and learn a different feild, two he can go active and leave the reserves, or he can possibly get out all together.  He said he's not wanting to leave; he likes it too much.  Depending on what they offer him he may just go in full time.  Which would be a good thing for him since he loved it so much when he was in school.  The only thing that I can think of that would hold him back is not wanting to leave his girlfriend.  I guess there is always the possibility that she could go with him.  He has 6 months to a year before he has to know what he is doing and so much can happen in that time so I guess we just wait and see.    I also found a few weeks ago that one of my best friends is engaged.  I'm so excited for him and I love his fiance!  They won't be getting married for another 2 years because they are in Virgina Beach right now and they want to get married here when they come back home.  Ray still has another year left in the sevice and Nakia has another year left of school.  After that they plan on moving back up here and planning their wedding.  I guess my back-up husband is now off the market :(.  J/K  I really am happy for the two of them and wish them the best.  Well that's all I have for today.

      It's official, I took my last clomid today.  I'm actually pretty nervous.  "What if it doesn't work"  That is what's running through my head at the moment.  I have no reason to believe it won't work, my body responds pretty good to meds.  I think I'm also nervous because of the unknown.  I hate it when I don't know excatly what is going on. I'm a bit of a control freak actually.)    I'm not to worried about the whole TTC process, it's what comes after.  I'm terrified of having another miscarriage.  I can't control what is going to happen so that just makes thing worse for me.  My doctor seems to think that everything will be okay the next time, and so does a little part of me.  But there is still this fear that I can't overcome, luckily I have Matt who keeps telling me that it will work for us I just need to be patient.  That's alot easier said than done.  The good news is: It's Time to BABY DANCE!!!!

      I just got off the phone with my mom a little while ago and I am completely dumbfounded.&nbsp; Our court system sucks!&nbsp;  July 2nd a lady that my dad works with was beaten within inches of her life by her estranged husband.&nbsp; The two little boys were there too.&nbsp; When the cops showed up&nbsp;&nbsp;the husband&nbsp;was trying to drown&nbsp;her and the boys bags were packed.&nbsp; The news says that she filled a restraining order on the 7th, but I've also heard that she didn't have one.&nbsp;  He got out on bail and I guess was staying with his parents.&nbsp; Yesterday his father allegedly dropped him off at her house.&nbsp; He hid in the back of the van and when she went off to work shot her twice in the back of the head.&nbsp; She wrecked and his legs were broken.&nbsp; They also think that he got the gun from his sister.&nbsp; I just don't understand why a parent would drop their son off at his estranged wife's house after trying to kill her, and even more I don't understand why he's allowed out on bail. I know everyone is entitled to a fair trial, but this is rediculous.&nbsp; The police caught him in the act the first time.&nbsp; All of her friends knew that he'd come back after her since he didn't succeed the first time.&nbsp; Why didn't the authorities see it coming?&nbsp; Now he is in the hospital with broken legs and see is clinging for her life. All I can think of is these poor little boys.&nbsp; The families are fighting over who should keep them, which in turn probably means that they will end up wards of the state.&nbsp; Personally I think the father's family shouldn't be allowed to have the boys in their custody.&nbsp; Especially since the dad is probably the one who dropped the husband off in the first place. The police are asking the judge to deny bond since this is he second offense.&nbsp; If she makes it through this ordeal he'll only go away for a few years and probably be release on early parole.&nbsp; Then her life will be endangered once agian. I know some people won't agree with my next opinion but I'm going to say it any ways.&nbsp; I think he should be shot, Hell with a trial he's guilty as sin, this slimbag doesn't deserve to another day.&nbsp; His Wife Does!

      Well we are back from vacation.&nbsp; Now I think I need another one to recover from vacation.&nbsp; We had a great time in DC, boy is there a ton of stuff to see. Monday we arrived around 3:30, the drive there was beautiful but long.&nbsp; When we pulled up to the hotel Matt and I both thought we were in for a trip.&nbsp; The outside of the hotel was not attractive at all, luckily the inside was very nice and our room was rather large.&nbsp; Once we got settled and changed we headed off to find a subway. We were very close to one which was nice.&nbsp; We headed out to Arlington National Cemetery.&nbsp; When we got there I started taking pictures and my camera died!&nbsp; Luckily I was able to get pictures of everthing I wanted.&nbsp; We saw JFK's grave site with the eternal flame, Robert Kennedy's grave, and Robert E Lee's house.&nbsp; The house was amazing, but it wasn't open for tours, it looked like they were doing some up keep on it.&nbsp; Then we headed off for the Changing of the guard.&nbsp; Changing of the guard was definitely one of my favorite things while we were there.&nbsp; After Arlington we headed back to the hotel and went to dinner.&nbsp; That was an early night since we had been up since 6:00.  Tuesday was our big day.&nbsp; We started out at the Washington Memorial.&nbsp; We went to the top and looked out the four windows, then we went and saw the few things on the next floor.&nbsp; We opted out of the hour walk down because we had a ton of things to do that day.&nbsp; After Washington Memorial we walked around to the WW II Memorial, It had only been open about 2 weeks, the place was crawling with people.&nbsp; There was even a few WWII vets there, people had placed pictures and flowers on the ground infront of their state to honor those who died in the war or died before the opening.&nbsp; After that we went over to the Vietnam Wall.&nbsp; They were working on updating the lighting so only about half of the wall was exposed, but it was still really neat.&nbsp; Lincoln's Memorial came next.&nbsp; His was the most crowded of them all. Talk about having to work to get pictures.&nbsp; But I got some pretty good ones.&nbsp; The reflecting pool had been drained for cleaning or repairs so I didn't get the picture I had hoped for of the Washignton Memorial.&nbsp;You get the idea from the few puddles still in it.&nbsp; Infront of the Korean War memorial was a couple of "gift shops"&nbsp;.&nbsp; They had all kinds of military patches and stickers and on the side of one there was a picture of Matt Maupin.&nbsp; He is&nbsp; a local boy here.&nbsp; It was marked KIA 6-28-2004 but someone had crossed it out since there has been no evidence that he has actually been killed.&nbsp; It was rather sad because he was one of the only one's on the wall.&nbsp; The day still wasn't over, not even close.&nbsp; We headed over to the Jefferson and FDR Memorials then To the American History Muesum.&nbsp; That is one of the coolest muesums that I have been in.&nbsp; After a couple hours there we headed back to the hotel to get ready for dinner.&nbsp; We headed up to Baltimore's Inner Harbor&nbsp;to meet up with some friends of ours.&nbsp; Danny and Allison had just got engaged so it was nice to see them. Wednesday we went to the Holacust Muesum.&nbsp; It was really neat in a desturbing way.&nbsp; It's so hard to believe that something like that could actually happen.&nbsp; After 3 hours there we went back to finish up the American history muesum, then we went to the Natural histroy to kill some time.&nbsp; We headed out to Hard Rock for dinner then we were done for the night. Thursday We went to the Air and Space Muesum.&nbsp; My Fav!!&nbsp; I was in heaven there.&nbsp;Most of the stuff we saw was infact the real thing.&nbsp; Supposedly they had a moon rock there, but I never saw it.&nbsp; After we were done at the Air and Space we headed over to Fords Theater.&nbsp; We meet a really nice family from Baton Rouge and showed them how to get there.&nbsp; Ford's theater was nothing spectacular, if you didn't know what it was you would just pass it as if it were some building.&nbsp; The box that lincoln was shot in was decorated the same way it was that night.&nbsp; The only origianl piece is the picture of George washington, everything else is replicated.&nbsp; Peterson house was next on the list.&nbsp; We had pasted it the day before and didn't even know it.&nbsp; They had it set up they way it would have been when Lincoln was shot.&nbsp; We went to the old post office then to Union station for dinner.&nbsp; After that we were pretty much beat and went back to the hotel.&nbsp; On our way back it started to pour!&nbsp; Friday morning we got up and Matt's ankle was killing him so we headed home. Sunday was Mackenzie's first birthday party.&nbsp; That girl got a ton of stuff! Now vacation is over.&nbsp; We didn't get to see everything we wanted so it looks like we will be heading back one day.

       I am officially on vacation!&nbsp; And I don't have to be back to work for 9 days.&nbsp; This is a very much needed break, seeing as I've worked almost a whole year with out one.&nbsp; Matt's vacation starts tomorrow night at 6:00 or 7:00 because they have the tent sale tis weekend.   I really don't like the tent sale because he works 10-10 thursday through saturday the sunday 12-6.&nbsp; I guess I really shouldn't complain because some other car companies actually have those hours all year long.&nbsp; I was pretty sure I was going to be bored out of my mind these last few days but I was wrong.&nbsp; Thursday I went to my SIL house and watched Mackenzie so she could run out for a little while, then I hung out until about 9:00.&nbsp; Yesterday we went to Johnny's to get Mackenzie's birthday prize then to McDonald's for dinner.&nbsp; I think I was at Chuck and Sommer's until almost 11:00 last night.&nbsp; Matt actually beat me home!&nbsp; I had a good time with Sommer too and since Chuck was out of town we kept each other company.   Next Friday Mackenzie turns 1.&nbsp; It's kind of bittersweet, becuase on the day she turns one will be one year to the day that Charlie and Marilyn found out I was pregnant.&nbsp; It's hard to believe a year ago I&nbsp; was pregnant and didn't have a care in the world.&nbsp; Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever thought Maddison wouldn't be with us right now.&nbsp; Actually I was afriad that we were going to find out we were having twins, not loosing a baby.&nbsp; I was sure that when Mackenzie's frist birthday rolled around we'd have our little one too, but I guess it's not suppose to be that way.&nbsp;   Mackenzie's First birthday isn't going to be as hard as my birthday.&nbsp; Just three days prior I had a D&amp;C, talk about the worst birthday ever.&nbsp; I thougth the year my parents forgot about my birthday was bad, nope this tops the scales.&nbsp; It seems like every 5 years my birthday goes to pot.&nbsp; When I turned 13 it was Labor day, and we were at the WEBN fireworks.&nbsp; Everything seemed fine until the end of the night when a huge Blue Water broke loose and almost crashed into a group of boats that in turn broke us loose and we almost crashed.&nbsp; I was on a friends boat, this was his first time with it out, and Don wouldn't cut the ropes we had to pul them in.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden he took off and one of my parent's friend's son almost feel off the back of the boat.&nbsp; He was lucky his mom was standing there to grab so he wouldn't have fallen into the motor.&nbsp; I don't think I have ever been so scared in all my life.&nbsp; I seriously thought we were going to die.&nbsp; We finally found my dad and got back on his boat, I have never set foot on another boat that isn't my dad's since.   Fast forward 5 years to my 18th birthday and my parents forget about me!&nbsp; They claim that they were too busy the weekd following up to my birthday.&nbsp; Sure what ever.&nbsp; Then last year I was recovering from a D&amp;C and mourning the loss of my child.&nbsp; I guess this birthday will be better, I hope.   I didn't really set out to talk about all of this but what can I say, my mind wonders and I have no control sometimes.&nbsp; I do have to say that that was a relief to get off of my chest.&nbsp; Now I just need to make it through the night!&nbsp; Then everything will be good.

      Seriously, this week is never going to end!  I know that it's because tomorrow is my last day before vacation, but I really thought with my boss gone this week would fly by.  That's not the case.  It doesn't help that we've been really slow.  Enough about work, the good news is VACATION!!!!  I know it may seem silly to be this excited about a vacation but we haven't been on one in almost 2 years.  The last time was our honeymoon.  Last year we went to San Antonio for Trey's Boot Camp Graduation, but it wasn't the same.  This time it's just me and Matt, no one else.  Well except for a few hours Tuesday night.  We are going to drive up to Baltimore and go to dinner with one of Matt's best friends, who lives in New York.  So that will be our nice night out, other than that we are just going to do what ever.  _____________  I'm starting to feel better about TTC again.  I swear I'm on a roller coaster ride that will never end.  I'm hoping that I ovulate on my own this time.  I'm really not expecting to but it would  be really nice if I would.  I'm a little nervous that I'll ovulate while on vacation and not be able to tell.  My doctor wants me to start taking the prometrium 4 days after I ovulate to see if that helps any.  I just don't want to miss 4 dpo.  I've been doing this long enough that I should be a pro by now.  No use worrying myself about something I  have no control over.  Is there?  So I'm a little scatterbrained to day, I think that is from staring at this stupid computer since 9:00 this morning. Only 2 hours left until I get to go see my neice!

      My trip to the doctor's didn't turn out the way I was thinking.  Which is a good thing.  He wanted to see how I was doing mostly.  He said that we'll never really know what happened this cycle, so in my case he'd like to think that it was a false positive instead of a 3rd miscarriage.  He also said that taking a clomid break this cycle is probably a good thing.  He asked if I had been taking my temperature and asked if I had seen the rise.  He said that the 4th day of the rise he wants me to take the prometrium not to wait until my period is late and I get a +hpt.  He also said that after the next two cycles he may send me to a specialist just to see if there is anything else that we could be doing.  Then he said that he saw no reason that I wouldn't be able to have a full term pregnancy, that I would just have to be patient (sorry can't spell this morning).  Then he said something funny.  He said you probably don't want to hear this from an old fart like me, but try to relax and have some fun.  Not like when your grandma says relax and you'll get pregnant, because that doesn't really work.  Just have some fun.  My doc has a bit of a sense of humor, kinda funny.  That's my news.  Look like I'm back to temping tomorrow. Hey anything for a kid right?

      I finally got to talk to Dr. L, he wants to see me tomorrow to discuss my options.  I'm really afraid that he's going to tell me the only we'll have a baby is by doing an IUI or IVF.  That might be okay for some people but I don't know if it's right for us.  At one point Matt and I talked about it and pretty much decided that we didn't want me to go through all of that with there only being a chance to get pregnant.  I have no problems getting pregnant, it's just holding on to the pregnancy that I seem to have trouble with.  So what's to say that I wouldn't miscarry a pregnancy anyways.  I know that I'm getting way ahead of myself right now but it's all I can think of.  I think I'm going to ask Dr. L if we can try a few more times before going to medical intervention.  I just think that adoption is a better option for us.  I guess I need to wait and see what he has to say tomorrow.

      To My Angels;   Only though I knew you for a short time I love you so very much.  My heart is broken that I can't have you here with me.  I don't understand why and I'm not going to try and pretend that I do.  There's some family member's that you never got to meet, and I know you would have loved them all.  You never got to meet your daddy, he is a wonderful man and I love him more than anything in this world.  I imagine you would have had his beautiful blue eyes.  Your daddy loved you so much and he would have been so good with you.  He probably would have had you running by the time you turned two.  He's a little obsessed.  I'm sure once you learned to talk you would be our little chatter box just like him.  You would have spent all day on fridays with your daddy, it would become your special day.  I'm sure he would have taken you to the fire house and show you around even if you were only a few weeks old.  You would probably be a pro at frisbee golf by the time you were old enough to walk since that now seems to be daddy's new favorite sport.  Most of all you would have felt safe in his arms.  Any time you needed a good cry or a shoulder to lean on he would have been there for you.  Your Papaw John and Grandma Peggy loved you all very much too.  Papaw John would have had you on his boat as soon as boating season came around.  He has a little life jacket waiting for a grandchild to us one day.  After a few years becoming a boating pro he would have had you in the water teaching you how to water ski.  He's not a very patient man but when it comes to teaching some one to ski he could do it all day long.  Then he would have taught you how to survive tubbing, but not until you were older.  He can be a little rough.  I'm sure he'd turn you into his little nascar buddy.  I can see you sitting in his arms watching the races on his deck.  Papaw John is a great man and you would have found him very funny.  As for your Grandma Peggy, or "The very best Grandma Ever" as she wants to be called, would take you on plane rides to go see Aunt Sheri and Great Grandma Wheeler.  She would take you shopping and to the park.  And make sure that Papaw John isn't too rough with you.  She want's to make a room in their house just for the grandbabies.  The room is my old room and it was turned into the wedding room when dady and I were getting married.  Grandma Peggy would have been an awesome grandma.  She would have taught you how to talk like a pro, just like daddy.  You may have never have gotten in a word when you were around her, but if you can she is a great listener.  Mommy has two brothers that would have been your uncles.  Uncle Trey would have taken you to the mall to pick up girls.  But then Ashley would have kicked his butt.  Uncle Trey is in the Air Force Reserves and we could have gotten you little fatigues to match his.  Uncle Trey would have been the one that you would have called in your teen years to bail you out of trouble.  Then he would have covered for you.  He is a great guy and he has a very weird sense of humor, which kids seem to love.  Uncle Kevin would have taught you all about sports and X box.  He'd also show you how to be the good child.  Since Mommy and Uncle Trey weren't.  I'm sure Uncle Kevin would have bought you florida clothes that way you had somethig to wear when you two would watch the basketball games.  But don't worry you could cheer for what ever team you waould have wanted.  He would have taken you to McDonalds, just like I did with him, and bought you happy meals.  Then probably to the movies to see what ever you wanted.  I know he would always have something new for you.  He would actually have spoiled you rotten, but that's what Uncles are for.  Your Grandma Marilyn and Grandpa Charlie are your daddy's mom and dad.  Grandma Marilyn would have taken so many pictures of you that we wouldn't know what to do with them.  She would have also made you a ton of scrapbooks.  Never would you have a shortage of pictures.  She would take you to the hospital and show you aff to all of her friends, then probably out to eat.  When it was hot outside she'd take you out to the pool and float around with you all day long.    Grandpa Charlie would have been ready to take you to Disney World the minute you were born.  He'd take you to all the parks and probably buy you a suvinior form every park.  You would get all the goofy pictures taken and eat at all the best places.  Grandpa Charlie is a kid at heart and you would have had so much fun with you.  He has all kinds of videos from when daddy was little that he would want you to watch with him.  I'm sure he would come up with some sort of nickname for you too.  Uncle Chuck, who is daddy's brother, would teach you all the bad stuff.  If you hung around him too much you would become rotten.  We would have had to tell you about his sense of humor.  It's rather dry and not everyone gets it.  He's a little crazy.  Aunt Sommer would have been around to keep him in line so he didn't get too rough.  You would have come home from her house asking me why our house isn't as clean as Aunt Sommer's.  We would have spent a lot of time over at their house, but don't worry your cousin Mackenzie would be there for you to play with.  She is almost a year old and it would have been adorable seeing you guys together.  Aunt Tiffany, who is daddy's sister would have taken you to your first Reds game.  I would have had to give her ear plugs for you because she can get a little crazy at those games.  She would also try to get you to cheer for UK basketabll.  They are her favorite team and when they play there is no talking allowed.  You would probably have had a Kentucky outfit that she would make you wear when it was game time.  If she saw you in the Florida one she wouldn't be too happy, her and Uncle Kevin go back and forth about who's team is better.  They are both ate up.  There's alot more fsmily members that I could tell you about but for today I think this is good.  We all miss you very much and I know one day we will be together as a family.  Until that day I hope you have found your Great Granny Noll.  She'll take great care of you until we are together.  Now don't go picking up on her bad habits and you may have to keep her out of trouble.  She always said that I was going to make her a great-great-grandmother but never did I think she would have the chance to meet you first.    One day I hope you will have a little brother or sister to look down on and keep safe. Don't worry when that day come we will not forget about you.  I'll never be able to hold you in my arms but in my heart is where you will always stay.  I love you very much and will miss you always. Love Mommy

      Today has been a horrible day.  I can't shake this feeling that I'm going to loss yet another baby.  I think I have this feeling because I can't decide if I feel pregnant or not.  At times I do like now my boobs hurt.  But earlier they didn't.  It's not helping that I've had 2 panic attacks today.  The first one led me to call my doctor and ask for a beta.  But the stupid girls at the front desk had no idea what I was talking about.  So I explained it was a quantitative blood test.  Then she asked if I was pregnant. Then she asked why and after I told her I was scared she asked why again.  I mean seriously is that all she can freaking say?  After telling her that I've had 2 miscarriages she asked if I was bleeding.  No I"m not I just want this for a peice of mind.  Finally I convenced her that I wanted and needed this.  She said she would fax in the beta series and when I got to the hospital the idiot only wrote for me to have on today.  So now I have no idea what is going on.  I'm going to try and get my results tomorrow, but fridays are usually my doctors day off.  So I'm hoping I can convence the lady to have antoher doctor read the results.  Heck I may even call my mil if it comes down to that.  Amanda knew that there was something not right with me today so she called me back tonight and we talked for about an hour.  In some strange way she can always help cheer me up.  She had me do this visual thing that really helped so I may have to start trying this when ever I feel overwhelmed.  She had me close my eyes and picture a beach ball, then take a really good deep breath and as I exhaled she told me to picture the ball shrinking to the size of a basketball, then on the next exhale to picture it shrinking to the size of a football, then to the size of a tennis ball, then to the size of a golf ball, then with the final breath visualize the ball disappearing.  Next she had me picture I was in side of my uterus with my baby.  Then to picture the baby's face, the crystal clear fluid surrounding us, then to picture the wall of my womb and feel how strong the were.  NExt she told me to feel my uterus hug me and the baby and to take a deep breath and to picture that as a gold beam that made my baby stronger with each breath I took.  I know it might sound weird but it did help.  Hopefully tomorrow I will get good news from my doctor.  Please God?   This next section is to cathch up on what has happened this week.  Friday when we were on our way back from dinner Kelly called out of the blue.  After talking to her for a little while she finally told Matt that she was pregnant.  Matt told her congrats and told me.  All that I could think of was why?  When Matt told me she was 12.5 weeks pregnant all I could think of was  umm she could still miscarry, it's still early.  I know that's horrible but that's all that I could think of.  When we got home a few minutes later he told me it was an accident and she got pregnant on her honeymoon.  I snapped at MAtt andtold him I didn't want to talk about it.  I came in the house and cried my eyes out.  Matt came over and held me the enitre time.  Finally I told him that I felt like a horrible friend because I was mad at her for being pregnant and that the first thing I thought of was she could still loose her baby too.  I still haven't come to terms with Kelly's pregnancy, and you know what I don't have to.  What did she expect me to jump up and down and cheer for her.  Yeah I think not.  Well it's 9:00 amd I still haven't had dinner and since MAtt will be home any minute I should go fix us something for dinner.

      OMG!!!!!  Tonight at 7:00 I just got a + on my hpt.  It's still faint but that could be because I've drank a ton today.  I'm going to take another test tomorrow morning to see if it's any darker.  Boy do I hope so.  I'm so excited and scared at the same time.  I'm very scared of another m/c, I need to just relax and enjoy the days that I am pregnant.  I think the easiest way to get through this is going to be by taking it one day at a time.

      Ever since this bumpy road, called TTC, started over a year ago I have had some really funky dreams.  As a result of these dreams I have started to wonder; Can our dreams show us events that have not yet been?  If you were to ask me that question I would have to say YES- definitely Yes.  Not because I believe one can see into the future, but I do beleive that there are times when some greater power is letting us have a sneak peak to our future.  I'll explain...  When I was pregnant the first time I had the same dream days apart. These dreams were incredibly vivid, down to the color of the walls in the doctor's office.  So in this dream I was having an ultrasound and the found 5 babies.  Unfortunately not all were going to survive.  One had stopped growing a few weeks earlier.  The doc said he would have to remove it so it wouldn't cause any harm to the other babies.  The baby was removed and that was that.   The next time I had this dream 1 thing changed; another baby had died.  That time I went from 5 to 3 babies. Only a few weeks later I found out that our baby had died a few week earlier, probably around the time of these dreams.  Also before I found out about the lose of the baby I kept dreaming that my doctor put me to sleep and took my baby.  Again this dream was very vivid right down to the yellowish walls in the hospital.  When I went to the hospital for my D&C I was shocked to see the area I was in was the same in my dream.  After the lose of my 2nd baby I had a dream one night that our baby didn't die.  We brought him home from the hospital.  What seemed to be a happy time was clouded by the illness that plauged our child.  The baby was a boy, he looked dead on Matt's baby pictures.  The doctors told us that he didn't have long and to take him home and enjoy the short time we would have. From the time we took him home he wouldn't eat or sleep.  The only way we could get him to nap was if he laid in our bed between us.  I got up to get dressed and told Matt to keep an eye on our son.  When I came back in the room he had the most violent seizier ever.  It was so strong that he fell off of the bed. After that it was a matter of time.  Last night I had yet another very vivid dream.  This time it was a happy one.  I POAS and walked away for 5 minutes.  When I went back there was the darkest positive line that I have ever seen.  It was so dark that the control line was lighter than my positive.  I was rather excited and then I woke up!  That always happens, I'm having a good dream then I wake up but when I'm having a bad dream  I stay asleep for the whole thing.  So yes in some way shape or form I beleive our dreams can unlock our future.  After the dream with my sick boy I felt better in some way that I didn't do anything wrong. And I do beleive that my sticky BFP is coming.  It may not be this cycle, but I think it could possibly be soon.

      Why does it seem like the only dreams I remember are either completely crazy or they make me feel worse.  Saturday night was not the best night of sleep. First I woke up in the middle of the night and had to pee (which never happens) and on my way to the bathroom I almost feel several times then I had the ever lovely feeling that I'm going to puke.  I had a dream that I tried to e-mail Kelly and she returned my e-mail and told me not to bother.  Maybe Christine is right, maybe I should e-mail Kelly and tell her how I feel.  But that would mean letting my guard down and actually letting my friend know that I am very jealous.  There I said it, I am incredibly jealous of Mark and Kelly. That feels a little better.  Now I just need to work up the courage to actually email her.  __________________________________________________ In TTC Land I had a little spotting today, but that's okay...Really.  I'm just so happy that I actually ovulated on my own.  That's enough to hold me over for now.  I'm actually thinking about going back to my fertility monitor.  Now I just have to figure out how to reset it.  Anyone know how?

      So Saturday was the annual Buffet Party.  All was going well until Kelly and Mark showed up.  Then the night took a turn for the worset.  All night everyone kept congratulating her and asking her is she needed anything.  All I could think was that should be me, NOT her.  Why does Kelly get to be pregnant and I dont?  Then later that night Mark came over and asked me if I hated him.  Then he asked if I didn't like him anymore. I asked him why he thought that and he hugged me and said that I used to hug him and talk to him, and know I won't even look at him.  I told Mark that it was to hard for me talk to him.  Then I started crying.   I sat there for a minute then ran down the drive way.  As I passed Matt he ran after me and asked what was wrong.  I told him that I was a horrible person.  I told him what happened and he asked if I wanted to leave.  I told him to finish his cornhole game then we could go. For the next half hour I walked the street alone.  Durning that time I wondered if I should go get Mark and explain things but I couldn't face the crowd.   I don't wish anything bad on Kelly or the baby, but I still don't think she should be pregnant.  I think a part of my problem is I feel like they stabbed me in the back.  Fist by getting pregnant.  Then by not telling us until she absolutely had too.  I think if she wouldn't have come to the wedding and the party we still wouldn't know.  And finally, because she told the whole world and left us out.  So much for being a friend.  I know she was trying to not hurt us but that's what she did.  I think those are the main reasons I only have a problem with her pregnancy and not anyone elses.  Hopefull one day I will be able to be happy for her, but I don't think that will happen until I get pregnant.  I've decided that I'm going to take Matt's advice and not worry about it.  When I get pregnant and stay pregnant then that's when I'll talk to Kelly.  Hopefully, Our friendship won't be beyond repair at that point. _______________________________________________  Yesterday was our Anniversary, and I spent it with my SIL.  Matt had to work until 9:00 so we went and saw a movie.  We saw Tom Cruises new move and I have mixed feelings on it.  Not get me wrong it was good but the ending sucked!  I think they could have done a little something more and it would have been a great movie.  Oh Yeah I was talking about our anniversary.  We are going to be celebrating Saturday.  Matt gets off at 5:30 so we are going to dinner that night, then maybe to a movie or something.  I'm thinking we are going to go to Kenwood and have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.  Everyone says how good it is so I think we'll try it.  We haven't made any real plans, but that's normal.  I guess I really don't have much to say about our anniversary since we haven't really celebrated it.
