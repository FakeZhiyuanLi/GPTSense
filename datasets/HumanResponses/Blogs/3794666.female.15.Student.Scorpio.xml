      I have been thinking alot about things lately. About friends, life and other things.&nbsp; I feel that I have lead you dear blog in the wrong direction.&nbsp; I feel that my blogs reveals me as to be someone who is a meek, love sick person who is always depressed and that is not true at all.&nbsp; When I wrote those, I just wrote what I thought were my feelings. I really think that those wern't my feelings at all. I think I was masking my true feelings and yes I still am.&nbsp; But the thing is, I can't talk to other people about my true feelings, because they are down so deep, so numb that I myself isn't sure what to think anymore.&nbsp; I made them numb for a reason, because I dont want to be that person I said earlier.&nbsp; I know that I can be a strong person, as long as certain things are numb.&nbsp; I am believe that I am. I dont know how I truely feel, and I am glad I don't.&nbsp; I have chose not to be a stereotypical girl teen.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp; want to think about boys all the time, I don't to be self centered. I dont want to sweat the small stuff.&nbsp; I just want to be me.&nbsp; I think that is the most important thing. I refuse to become someone else to please others.&nbsp; I am my own person and that is starting to show more and more each day.&nbsp; So really for those of you who think I need to talk all the time, thank you for listening, but I don't think I need to and I also think I have given you the wrong impression.&nbsp; For some of the feelings I have told you about were, well false. I know that now.&nbsp; But I am not sure what the true ones are yet and don't want to know.&nbsp; And by the way, the last post was one of them.&nbsp; One of those posts that I didn't know my ture feelings and said them in the wrong way. Gee I hate hormones.&nbsp; They are so stupid.&nbsp; So I am here to tell you&nbsp; that I am a strong person and I will always try to be.&nbsp; So good bye for now, who ever reads this.&nbsp; I know it doesn't make much sense, but nothing of me does anymore.

      We are back from camping now.&nbsp; My brother's girlfriend is coming down for the weekend, big fun that is.&nbsp; Well anyway, I am not sure what I am going to talk about in this blog, but I am afriad to a say anything out lound. I fear that people might think that i am a mental case or something.&nbsp; Which you know would not be a very bad idea, it's better being a mental case that plan old normal.&nbsp; Then there is love, I told myself so many times before that it wouldn't happen to me,&nbsp; that I wouldn't let it happen to me.&nbsp; At least not until college, but unfortunately it has happened.&nbsp; I wont tell you who it is. But this person is very special, and it may not be who some of you might think.&nbsp; I guess I have been hit by the love bug.&nbsp; This person will never like me, I guess I have always known that. But I have always thought that maybe that person would make a move.&nbsp; But i guess I was wrong.&nbsp; I will always be that person who gets left out, like always. I mean i have friends in probably all of&nbsp; "social groups" in school, but as soon as those friends get together in their own&nbsp;groups, they pretend that they were never&nbsp; my friend.&nbsp; It always works that way.&nbsp; I guess there must be something wrong with me.&nbsp; So what do I do. Joelle told me i&nbsp; analyze&nbsp; things way to much, but I don't think I do.&nbsp; I am afriad she just doesn't understand, because has never been in this situation.&nbsp; Well&nbsp;I don't know, maybe I do. Ok then, well i guess thats enough for now.

      Hello. It hasn't been a while since my last post, but thats ok. I can still ramble on about things can't I? Ofcours, its my blog. HAha! But anyway this  is a time of news and gossip, well i dont have any at the time, so well, I guess i will have to talk about other stuff.  I am going camping again tomorrow(wednesday), its going to be fun. Well i guess its not camping, but well what else do i say yurting?? Well that works. Anyway we are going up the coast, near devil's lake.  Joelles leaving on thursday, guess i will have nobody else to share gossip with, considering she is the only one i really talk in the summer, except kyle. He is a great person to talk to. You know, I think he is the first person I can relate with on a regular basis. No offense joelle, love you to death. I was reading your blog kyle, and your first entry where you are going on about the relationships, you know i feel the same way. I haven't had as near amout of relationships as  you, but i have alway felt the same way about them when i am in them. I know that really didnt make a lot of sence. But make out what you can lol. More later, bye.

      Hey you guys. It's saturday night. Summer is going by so fast I can't believe it.  This last week has been hard to get through, because I have realized something, it makes me really disheartend for a certain situation. But I will get over it. No biggie.  I got my hair cut really short. It was done on thursday and my dad still hasn't noticed lol. Great isn't it. lol It makes me laugh just thinking about it. Lately everything seems to be going over his head.  I have been thinking a lot about the play and how it is over.  I have just seemed to be so lost with out that sensation of being on stage and being with really great people. Working with everyone was so great!!! I think i have been bitten by the stage bug.  It seems like a piece of my heart is gone,   I miss that play. I could have done it for another month, even longer.I really wish something was going on. Then i could get my  mind off things. I just feel like something is missing in my life and i am not sure what.  I feel like...well i am not quite sure. I feel different and not a good differnt.  I guess i just feel lost. I mean Even if i were to talk to someone i am not sure what i would tell them, because i dont know whats going on. But i know its something. Anyways more later bye.

      Today nothing much really happened.  I had soccer practice with my team.  They are so cute. I love being a coach.  I don't really know what else to say.  My mom is right behind me on the tredmill so I can't really pour out anything deep right now.  I feel a lot better since I talked to someone about my troubles last  night and I thank that person for listening. Thats really all I needed,  someone who listened instead of talk for a while. So thank you.  There is still a lot that was never even said, but that is for me.  I can't really tell you that part. So thank you very much. You are a great person.

      Sometimes I wonder why we were put here one earth.What is our  purpose.  The questions is, when will we find out.  Then there is the subject of god.  Which I don't know if I believe in such a thing or not.  But that is not the topic I want to get into anymore.  I wrote in my other blog, about the world and that if I had a choice to enter it that I probably wouldn't enter it.  The fact remains that I probably still wouldn't.  It sounds like I am probably a really depressing person, and at this point in time I am really depressed.  There are so many things that are changing around here and it makes me so very sad.  One of my best friends moved in the recent months before. Janis, the best director of plays that I have ever met is moving. Which probably means that  the drama program is probably going to be fed to the dogs.  The  friends that I do have are great, but they have other friends that they hang out with all the time.  I can't believe that I am really saying all of this for the first time on this blog.  I told you some of it in my other blog, but  there is so much more that I want to let out of my heart, things that would probably make you want to take me to a shrink or something  and because other people, that i dont know and know, are probably going to read this. I will just sound like I am feeling sorry for myself, in fact I  probably already do. I think of this blog as kind of a stress releaser. I hope it will help.  I dont really know what to name this blog.  It really shouldn't have a name. It doesn't deserve one. O'well. On a different note, Our cast of little shop of horrors got together one last time to watch the dvd that they put together of our show. It was great. At the end of the showing, my dad came and I had to just leave. I was so very sad. This was to be the last time that  our cast would get together, be together. It makes   me so sad.  I would love to be on broadway when I grow up, but my mom always talks me out of it.  Well anyway thats enough. See you later
