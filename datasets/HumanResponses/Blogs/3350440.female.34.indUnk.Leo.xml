      I am sitting here thinking i want to post pictures here,Anybody know how to do this?? Today I have positive happy thoughts!I am relaxing fully with my family.My dh is promising to get my new 'temporary' bedroom in order today.(we have to have a temp room till we finish the second floor..we built a big addition..a whole second floor plus went out as well & created 2 more rooms there & another bathroom).The room is brown@@I am not too enthused but its growing on me.I'll fix it up somehow.Dh rushed it lol.No plans really for today,other than that & get our kitchen table in cause we ripped down the wall that was in the kitchen/dining area & now we have a dining room which was Ashleys Bedroom=).I am thinking we NEED bunk beds for Brianna to have a place to sleep rather than always with somebody.I do have a dollhouse bed for her..but no place to put it at the momment.  As far as the war today,I didn't hear anything new.I am still confused & sick to my stomach about what is happening on the world today.I am missing mass today.I had girls spend the night last night with my daughters.Busy morning today making French Toast;) Still wondering where to put photos & thinking that i must force myself to do sit ups to get my stomach back in shape!!!HELP!!

      I am sitting here now with my two children..both are playing.My middle daughter is eager to go out to play.My friends online & I frequently discuss whats happening in the world.After 9/11 the world has changed for us.I don't know about everybody else but definately did for us.My heart goes out to all the men & women who are in IRAQ today fighting.I am hoping this Blog can sort out my feelings a little bit & maybe some people can give me some input to educate me more on how to sort out these feelings of sadness that I have.I am sitting here thinking "WHAT will the future bring our Children with this as their beginning"??I Know war was always happening.My feelings & thoughts are jumping all over the place=/ I had confidence in George Bush in the beginning.As I am seeing what happened to Berg..& as I am seeing what our own people did to the Iraq prisoners both enrage me to a certain excent.What happened to Berg is making me truley question George Bush and what the heck does he plan to do now???I sure hope there is a good plan..I just do not know anymore.we went to war on TERRORISM...I remember seeing Osama Bin Ladin as our most Wanted man..now we are in IRAQ?Where is Osama?things like this are just confusing to me.I am a SAHMother at the momment cause this is where I want to be right now.I love my home & my entire family,as well as our country.I am finding myself enjoy country music more now than ever before.Well..off to try to enjoy my day with my family today.We are going to put a new kitchen table in;) we knocked a wall down last week & now have a dining room so that set is in there.LONG story but we've been under construction since last July=/ LOL!

        I got here from reading a few other blogs.One thing on my mind frequently today is what our children are seeing & hearing in our world today.What will they endure in our future??I am a mother of 3 girls,ages 14,8 & 2 years old.I would love to have another baby,but at the momment I decided to wait as well as my Husband.My husband has strong views on this war.He thinks we were right to go in believing there were weapons of Mass Destruction In Iraq.WE both grew up in northern NJ and went to NY City almost daily in our teenage years.I grew up LOVIGN the Big Apple and everything about it,the lights & busy lifestyles it presented me.I grew up never once dreaming that those two beautiful towers standing Tall would be the beginning of what would CRUSH My dreams for this country & our future & our children.If you think our children are not aware of what is going on,think again=(.My mother even had work from Port Authority of NY & NJ and that DAY of 9/11..my own father went the night before to return the work because he had something to do that next day.He was one who was spared...had he gone..he would've definately been there to be part of that disaster that happened that morning.I was pregnant with my 3rd daughter Brianna & My husband woke me up screaming "LOOK AT THE NEWS"...I seen that a plane HIT the tower.My first reaction..being NAIVE like I was BACK THEN,was oh no an accident.Thinking it was just an accident.My husband however had other thoughts...saying " I dunno'..I bet it isn't.".As we were discussing this..WhAM I WITNESS the 2nd Plane Hit..& THat was it..a BIG HUGE Smack in my Stomach.It literally made me sick.I went to the bathroom & was wondering..Is this morning sickness coming back or am I really sick by this???Sadly,a few minutes later I am sitting there with my husband watching some more..(our children were in Schol at this time.My oldest was up north NJ at that time & was ON THE ROOF of her school WATCHING)..as the first tower Crumbled.When that happened,At that Momment,I changed forever.I cried tears for all those people and what our country was seeing before our own eyes.I seen all the dramatics that I do not want to repeat & my heart STILL Aches for those who lost loved ones on that HORRIBLE morning.I noticed this country got all diplomatic..waving their flags..we lit candles..etc..Our country UNITED & Became ONE & that alone had me praying for a better tomorrow.I am a Christian & Believe That God has a Plan & I am trying to stay focused that trust in HIM,I will be ok.
