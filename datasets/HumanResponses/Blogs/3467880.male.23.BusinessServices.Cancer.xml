      By Ann Oldenburg, USA TODAY  The Friends finale is expected to be a big night for television. Just how big will Thursday's episode be? And how big has this year been? • Ad time for the hour-long finale (NBC, 9 ET/PT) has been selling at $2 million for each 30-second spot, which should bring in about $40 million.  • Media buyers expect 40 million to 50 million people to tune in. (That's big by today's standards but nowhere near the record held by M*A*S*H with 105.4 million in 1983.)   • Viewer parties are being thrown from Petaluma, Calif., to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., by fans and TV and radio stations. The NBC Web site suggests serving artichoke dip and cran razz mocktinis, a mix of ginger ale and cranberry juice. A Friends party kit with coasters, invitations and menu ideas has been for sale at Target stores ($29.99) since March.  • The finale is so widely accepted in the industry as one of the biggest TV events of the past few years, other channels acknowledge that it's NBC's night. ABC sent out a press release saying: "Tired of the end of Friends hype? Viewers now have a choice ..." That choice is a two-hour edition of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, which will cut to a live New York City makeover during commercial breaks of Friends. "When you take on giants, you have to at least offer a fun alternative," says Andrea Wong, senior vice president of alternative series and specials at ABC Entertainment.   • Banking on big interest, NBC is planning to repeat the final three Friends episodes on May 20 from 8-10 pm ET/PT.  • Going into its 10th and final season last fall, Friends was averaging $473,500 per 30-second ad spot, making it the priciest program in prime time, according to Advertising Age.  • Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc have been pulling in $1 million each per episode during this final season, making them TV's highest paid cast at $6 million.  • Countless industries have made money off of Friends through the years. Small businesses have boomed by touting the jewelry or clothes the stars supposedly love. Celeb magazines have seen circulation boosts by putting Friends on their covers. Jennifer Aniston was on the cover of People more than any other star last year.  • The DVD of tonight's one-hour finale will be available for sale on Tuesday, featuring extra unaired footage and the 1994 pilot episode. Seasons 1 through 7, currently out on DVD, have been strong sellers. Season 5 sold 450,000 copies in the first month it was out, meaning sales of $20 million, according to Video Store Magazine. Season 8 is due out at the end of the year.

      By Ann Oldenburg, USA TODAY  In many ways, it was the exact opposite of a reality show.    Six young, single friends living in New York City. It didn't matter what jobs they had or where they were from. They weren't out to get each other. They were Friends.   Tonight, after 236 episodes, it's goodbye to Chandler, Monica, Rachel, Ross, Phoebe and Joey. Friends wraps up after 10 years of dominating Thursday night TV for NBC, of shaping pop culture with their chic hairstyles — in particular, The Rachel — hip clothing and favorite sayings, and of portraying a sweet and silly single life that struck just the right chord with young adult viewers. Last week, it was No. 1 in the ratings among the prized 18- to 49-year-old demographic.   "Friends will be remembered as the show that made America aware that being in your 20s is really being in the prime of life," says Elayne Rapping, professor of American studies at the University of Buffalo. "Friends stands out as a sign that we are now living in a culture where youth rules."   The cast — Jennifer Aniston, 35; Courteney Cox, 39; Lisa Kudrow, 40; Matt LeBlanc, 36; Matthew Perry, 39; and David Schwimmer, 37 — will gather alongside the crew and NBC executives to watch the finale together in Los Angeles.  At 8 p.m. ET/PT, a clip show looks at great Friends scenes through the years. At 9 comes the aptly titled last episode, "The Last One." And at 11:30 the cast will appear on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.   "Television will be a different landscape without it," says Jonathan Munane, 30, from Los Angeles, who has watched the sitcom since day one. "I saw the first episode of Friends when I was in college, and it was the first show I ever really saw that seemed like it could be about people I knew."  But was anybody really like these friends? In spirit, maybe yes. In reality, probably not.   They lived mostly in two spacious two-bedroom apartments in Manhattan right across the hall from each other, with no obvious means of financial support. They hung out at a coffee shop called Central Perk all day long. While real life in the dot-com '90s meant many people were losing their jobs, for these Friends life was carefree, centered on foosball, dating and meatball sandwiches.  And friendship.   "Loyal and honest, they were always there for each other. They really loved each other, warts and all," says Lauren Johnson, 39, the author of Friends: The One About the #1 Sitcom (New American Library, $13.95). "We saw ourselves in them, and because of that, we knew that if they were OK, we knew we were OK."   Topical events never intruded   The show wasn't about lecturing on social issues, although there was a lesbian marriage in the first season and interracial dating in later seasons. Sex was always a topic of conversation. But war or topical events? The show never made a direct reference to 9/11. And it came under fire for not featuring any minorities as Friends and few as guests.  "If everything had to be so darn politically correct, it wouldn't have been as funny," says Beth Alcaron, 34, of Tucson. "It was just fun," and what appealed most was simply the interaction among the six pals. "I've got a group of close-knit friends, and I see us getting into some of the same dumb conversations, talking about the same stupid stuff."   Focusing on the friendship of six young adults equally was a different concept for sitcom television. The nuclear family, from Leave It to Beaver to The Cosby Show, was, and still is, often the main story line.   The closest similar show: Seinfeld, about friends in New York but billed as a show about nothing and based on the comedy of Jerry Seinfeld.   Friends, which made its debut in 1994, focused also on friends in New York, but it was about something, Rapping says — specifically, a way of life. She says Friends will go down in history as doing for twentysomethings what The Mary Tyler Moore Show did in portraying the single working woman for the '70s: Both showed friends becoming family.  "Friends and Beverly Hills 90210 were among the first shows to depict young people who were very much on their own. Their lives revolved around each other. Family and work were not of major importance."   Those days are over, she says. Now, work and winning are of major importance.  "What we are seeing now instead is the immense popularity of TV reality shows, with their depictions of corporate, cutthroat values, whose characters are concerned solely with competing and getting ahead of other people. That's the opposite of what Friends was about."  Says Matthew Perry, who always in some way will be Chandler Bing, the hapless, lovable Friend, "It became comfort television for people." Perry found it "impossible to ignore" the emotion as the ending approached.   "I'd had this huge headache. It was this moment before you're supposed to start weeping, and I just stayed there for the whole night. It was very difficult to shoot the last scene, because it was the end of something significant."  For fans, it's personal   It wasn't just significant for television, or for the actors, who gained exposure and built monster bank accounts; it was huge for NBC.  "Friends has been one of the cornerstones of the network for the last 10 years.," says Jeff Zucker, NBC president. "Obviously, we can't deny it's a huge loss for us."  Fans also are feeling the loss — on a personal level. Kris Bosman, 27, special-events coordinator for the University of Utah's Crimson Club, says the show mirrored her life. "It's a show that a lot of girls my age have grown up with. The first year it was on was my freshman year in college. That was kind of what you wanted for your life — to have a group of friends who were supportive."  She usually watched the show with her roommates. Now, she is married and pregnant and will watch the finale with "probably just my husband. I'll have it on TiVo and watch it sometime that night."  Abbi Novic, 17, has been a fan "ever since I was not even old enough and had to sneak upstairs and lock my door to watch it." She lives in Murrysville, Pa., and plans to have a party at her house tonight with about a dozen friends.   "It is the end of a decade of laughter, but I'm sure that when it ends, I will be in tears," she says. "I cried at least two times on the second-to-last episode. I have just become so attached to the Friends characters and their story lines, I cannot even imagine how they will end the show, and I try not to imagine it because I want it to be a surprise."  The finale will focus on the big question: Will star-crossed Ross and Rachel wind up together after being married, divorced and having a child together? Or will Rachel go off to Paris, where her heart is leading her, and leave Ross behind?   The finale was taped in January. Afterward, as the sets were broken down and cast and crew got a chunk of the street outside Central Perk in a glass box as a keepsake. Although rumors have been floating ever since, the show has tried to keep the plot under wraps.  For Matt LeBlanc, the ending is about Joey, his character, and Chandler. "We have a pretty similar sense of humor, he and I," LeBlanc says. "We were like Abbott and Costello. We were a great comic team together. In the finale, needless to say, we have a story together, which is a really nice way to wrap things up."  David Crane, Friends' creator and executive producer, says, "Everybody ends up in a place where you can feel satisfied ... (but) there are some surprises."   Adds Marta Kauffman, another creator and producer, "We didn't have a gimmick. What we hope is that people feel good about saying goodbye to them, and that they're all going to be OK."  Says Kevin Bright, who will produce the Joey spinoff: "People would be really angry if the end of the show was not satisfying."

      By Robert Bianco, USA TODAY  Ross and Rachel, at last.   With an entertaining, satisfying one-hour finale Thursday, Friends circled back to where it began, with Ross and Rachel united as a couple.   For 10 years, fans of this blockbuster NBC sitcom have followed Ross and Rachel through the soap-comic-opera mechanics of a relationship that kept them in balance, never completely together or completely apart. Well, now they're together (and in New York, not Paris), which is what fans wanted.  As Phoebe once told Ross, he's Rachel's "lobster." And lobsters mate for life, or at least until the next TV reunion movie.   Written by the show's creators, Marta Kauffman and David Crane, the episode deftly mixed emotion and humor while showcasing each of the stars in turn: Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. It may have been impossible for any one episode to live up to the hype and expectations built up around the Friends finale, but this hour probably came as close as fans could have reasonably hoped.  Well, what there was of it. There were so many commercials, the show often seemed to be designed to provide a break between them.  Though the union of Ross and Rachel was the main plot point, it was hardly the only one. Joey bought new versions of Chick and Duck. (The old ones, we discovered, were dead.) Gunther finally told Rachel he loved her. Oh, and Monica and Chandler got their adopted child, which turned out to be twins. ("We only ordered one!")  How did it rank against other great finales? Overall, far better than most.   If it wasn't quite as funny as the wrap-up of Newhart or the absolute perfection of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, it also wasn't a slap in the face like Seinfeld.   Following an NBC pattern set by the departure of Seinfeld, the hour-long Friends finale was introduced by a one-hour clip show. But in contrast to this season's annoying Sexand the City clip show, Friends kept the interviews and the self-congratulation to a minimum and let the show's funniest moments speak for themselves.  And they certainly did — from Phoebe reliving her childhood, to Chandler trying not to talk like Chandler, to Monica touring the erogenous zones, to Ross screaming "pivot," to Rachel crying because she can't read a sonogram, to Joey explaining a "moo point." ("It's like a cow's opinion. It doesn't matter.")  Ultimately, the two-hour package did exactly what it was supposed to do. It wrapped up the story while reminding us why we liked the show and will miss it.  Goodbye, good Friends.

      By Robert Bianco, USA TODAY  Could a show be more appropriately named?   For 10 years, the key to the remarkable appeal of TV's last true blockbuster sitcom has been right there in the title: Friends. This NBC staple not only explored the ebb and flow and value of friendship, but in its own TV way it also reflected the virtues of friendship itself. On a very basic level, this was a show people liked — a comfortable, reliable resting place that people enjoyed visiting once a week. If ever a sitcom could be called amiable, it was Friends.   It's easy to both over-praise and undervalue amiability, and Friends has had its share of both excessive hype and unwarranted backlash. It was not the best comedy of the '90s, the last great fertile period for sitcoms — that was Frasier. Nor was it the most socially conscious — that was Roseanne. Or the most popular — that was Seinfeld.  Yet where its competitors grew stale, collapsed or petered out, Friends carried on to become the most consistently entertaining of all, and the one that is likely to wear best over time. Passion cools; affection is more constant. Friends inspired nothing if not affection.  Indeed, to a level reached by few other sitcoms, Friends induced viewers to grow attached to its characters and their soap-opera entanglements. Will & Grace can be an extremely funny show, but who cares, really, if Grace stays married to Leo or not? Seinfeld's four studies in dysfunction clung to each other because no one else would have them; the show had all the brilliance, and warmth, of polished ice.  Like The Mary Tyler Moore Show, the prototype for all sitcoms that form a family out of friends, Friends ran on empathy. We are supposed to want these six peopleto end up happy: Phoebe married, Joey successful, Monica and Chandler with a child, and, at least in this corner, Ross and Rachel together. We'll see what happens tonight (8 ET/PT) in a special that is being kept under lock and key.  Does our fondness for Friends make it one of TV's all-time greatest sitcoms, on par with I Love Lucy, All in the Family, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, M*A*S*H or The Cosby Show? No. Great sitcoms, like great art, challenge us in some way: They take risks, they innovate, they force us and the medium to grow in ways Friends never quite did.  But if it didn't reach the very top, it got awfully close. Friends was brightly written and perfectly portrayed by that under-Emmyed cast: Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer.   On most weeks, the show was content simply to amuse. Yet if it seldom overtly addressed social issues, it did expose a huge young audience to a world that was far more complicated than TV once recognized — from its endorsement of gay marriage and surrogate motherhood to its casual acceptance (at long last) of interracial dating.   In the end, what may be most remarkable about Friends is its constancy. Only five sitcoms have ever left the air as that season's most popular comedy: I Love Lucy, The Andy Griffith Show, M*A*S*H, Seinfeld and now Friends. And Friends has been television's most popular sitcom for the past six years, a late-life record that will be hard to beat.  In part, of course, Friends' success is a comment on the sorry state of the sitcom today, and the failure of the networks to come up with a new comedy that can challenge Friends in the ratings. Even so, there's no denying the unaltered popularity of a show that will end its last season as one of TV's top 5 series. In contrast, The Cosby Show — at its height, the best-rated sitcom of the past 40 years — barely made the top 20 in its final season.  None of this could have been predicted when Friends' unexceptional pilot was first screened for critics. At the time, the show was widely dismissed as a kind of blanded-out Seinfeld, one in a string of NBC comedies about single white people in the city. Yes, NBC gave it a comfy time slot (hammocked between Mad About You and Seinfeld), but no one in the industry expected Friends to break out as instantly and dramatically as it did. And certainly no one predicted magazine-cover status for the young stars, most of whom had acting résumés that would embarrass Joey.   Yet together, they struck an unexpected chord. At a time when Americans were marrying later and putting off forming traditional families until they were older, Friends spoke to that still-strong need to connect, to form families out of friends. A generation moving away from home and starting life alone saw themselves in this show.  It didn't hurt, of course, that they were being shown an incredibly glamorized version of their lives. The characters rarely had serious monetary or health problems, and the actors were almost ideally good-looking — not plastic pretty, like soap opera stars, or inaccessible, like movie stars. Is it any wonder that fans copied them, from Aniston's hairdo to Perry's punchline emphasis on the word "be"?  The cast turned out to be as adroit off screen as on. Their unprecedented one-for-all negotiating front did more than make them rich; it shaped their show. It mandated a friendly equality among all six actors and characters, sparing Friends the ego-driven divisions that destroyed such sitcoms as Designing Women.   In a medium where actors and characters tend to blend, that off-screen support amplified the emotional connections on screen. It shouldn't matter, but it does: On a show called Friends, viewers want to believe the actors get along.  Achieving popularity can be a matter of luck and timing. Maintaining it at this level takes skill and talent and, often, improvement. Characters who began as one-note stereotypes — the hippie ditz, the den mother, the spoiled princess, the smart aleck, the dumb hunk, the shy nerd — grew richer and quirkier.   Change, of course, is a tricky business for a sitcom, which must maintain the pleasure of familiarity without breeding contempt. We want characters to grow, but not so much that they lose the qualities that attracted us to them in the first place.  The secret blessing of Friends was that it hit upon a stretch in its young characters' lives that was story-rich — a time when people try new jobs and date new people, before eventually settling down.  Credit the writers for managing those transitions incredibly well, with very few missteps. (Note to future show runners: Never give a character a monkey as a pet.) On most shows, linking two main characters like Monica and Chandler would have been an act of desperation. On Friends, it was a stroke of genius that made both characters more appealing while providing a needed diversion from the show's central task: Retaining a romantic equilibrium between Ross and Rachel.  As the show concludes, it brings to a close a 20-year era of blockbuster sitcoms that began with The Cosby Show — which makes this departure all the more bittersweet. That doesn't mean the sitcom will die, moribund though it may seem. Friends has made billions and will continue to make money for decades in syndication. Its success, and now its absence, will encourage studios and networks to rededicate themselves to finding a successor.  On TV, as in life, new friends eventually come along. But Friends this good are never really replaced.

      ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- One week before its opener at the Athens Games, the U.S. men's Olympic team took a step backward -- even though the Americans didn't quite see it that way.  The American team blew most of a 14-point fourth-quarter lead against a Turkish team missing Hedo Turkoglu, one of its two NBA players, before coming away with a 79-67 victory Sunday night. It was not an encouraging performance for the Americans, who again struggled against a team that didn't even qualify for the Olympics -- just as happened earlier on their European trip against Germany.  A 19-8 run including several of Turkey's 11 3-pointers narrowed the home team's deficit to 68-65 with 3 1/2 minutes left before the U.S. team turned up its defensive pressure to close out the game.  "It was a good experience for us because we're going to have games like this [in Athens] when there is some adversity and they start making shots against us," coach Larry Brown said. "We're just going to have to deal with it."  Tim Duncan led the United States with 16 points and Allen Iverson scored 13, with no one else reaching double figures.  Most alarming for the Americans was the way the team's core of youngsters, including LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade, couldn't keep Turkey from making a game of it down the stretch. Though Brown admitted he was tempted to leave his youngsters in, he reinserted the team's elder statesmen, Duncan and Iverson, who steadied the team to help close out the victory.  "I am happy that we're getting better and starting to become a team, but we have a ways to go," Iverson said. "As long as we recognize we have to do more, we'll be all right. If we felt like we were there, it would be something to worry about."  With Turkoglu out because of a broken nose, Ibrahim Kutluay led Turkey with 19 points and Serkan Erdogan added 17. Both players combined for a flurry of 3s that thrilled the a crowd of about 10,000 at the hot, cramped Abdi Ipekci Arena, a low-ceilinged gym that would be considered a bandbox by NBA standards. And when Turkey made its rally, the noise level was intense.  "I don't know if we'll play in an environment any better than this," Brown said, "and I think they players really enjoyed the experience."  But some of them clearly didn't.  Starting point guard Stephon Marbury struggled again, earning a technical foul for arguing with a referee and going scoreless in 19 minutes. Wade also earned a technical for defiantly rolling the ball away from an official following a call he didn't like, and Duncan shot several angry gazes at the referees when they failed to call fouls when he was being hacked.   But unlike many of the younger players, Duncan never lost his cool and played the role of go-to guy to perfection.   Even with NBA player Mehmet Okur defending him, Duncan was his usual efficient self while shooting 8-for-12, grabbing eight rebounds and blocking two shots in 29 minutes.   The Americans missed all six of their 3-point attempts but still shot 60 percent from the field, while Kutluay and Erdogan made five 3s apiece.   "The big thing was that in the last three minutes I don't know if Turkey scored after we went back to our first unit," Brown said. "The key was we didn't panic, righted ourselves and played with great poise down the stretch."  The teams will play again Tuesday night, and the Americans plan to travel to Athens on Thursday.

      USA co-captain Allen Iverson (Philadelphia 76ers) had never hit a game winning shot in his illustrious playing career until Wednesday night when, with time about out, he dribbled across mid-court and launched a game-wining 40-foot 3-pointer to lift the USA Senior Team (2-1) to an 80-77 victory over Germany (1-1) in front of a sold-out Kolnarena crowd numbering 18,000.   "It felt good when it left my hand, I knew it had a chance," said Iverson of his game winner. "I tried to side step him (his defender) just to get a little bit of space and I got a good look at the basket and fortunately it went in. "That was my first buzzer-beater ever," added a smiling Iverson who was mobbed by his USA teammates after making the shot.   The Iverson answer was a fitting end to a game that was tight the entire way and one in which NBA All-Star Dirk Nowitzki almost single-handedly kept his country within striking distance. Nowitzki finished the night with a game best 32 points on 13-for-23 shooting overall, while adding 12 rebounds, three assists and two blocked shots.    In a game in which neither team was able to post more than a a six point advantage, the fourth quarter saw the two teams stay within three points of each other the final 10 minutes.    The U.S. entered the fourth quarter trailing 61-60 and was behind 65-63 with 8:40 to play when Carmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets) scored five consecutive points to spark the Americans to a 68-65 lead with 8:00 to play.   Germany forward and former UNC player Ademola Okulaja made a three to tie the game at 68, and with 5:40 to go, Lamar Odom (Los Angeles Lakers) scored off a pass from Anthony to put the US up 70-68.   Germany scored the game's next four points to move ahead 72-70 with 3:30 showing on the clock, but the USA evened the game after Stephon Marbury (New York Knicks) came up with a critical steal at mid-court, then found Anthony on the break for a layup with 1:57 left.   Iverson, in a preview of what was to come, swished a 3-pointer a blink before the shot clock expired to give the US a 75-72 lead with 1:18 remaining.   The suspense continued and with 35 ticks left in the game, Nowitzki was fouled on a 3-point attempt and the Dallas Mavericks star made two of the three free throws to close the gap to a single point, 75-74.   Having committed just two fouls in the final quarter, Germany was forced to foul to get into the bonus and made three quick fouls before finally sending Anthony to the line to shoot two with 12.4 showing on the clock.   Despite the roar of the frenzied, partisan crowd, Anthony calmly made both free throws to increase the USA lead to 77-74. But Nowitzki had one more shot in him and pulling up at the top of the key, he watched his 3-pointer fall cleanly through with 3.8 seconds left to tie the contest 77-77.  Tim Duncan (San Antonio Spurs) then inbounded the ball to Iverson around the foul line and Iverson dribbled right, took a dribble across halfcourt and launched his first game winner.  US offensive effort was headed by Duncan who finished with another impressive all-around effort, scoring a US high 19 points and grabbing a team best nine rebounds. Anthony added 16 points, and Iverson finished with 15. All12 U.S. players scored in the contest.   "It was a great basketball game. Germany played very well and any time you have a Dirk Nowitzki on an opposing team you have a very tough opponent," stated U.S. mentor Larry Brown. "I think our players really got a lot out of these two games (against Italy on Aug. 3 and Germany Aug. 4).   We made a lot of improvement from the game last night, but we have a long, long way to go. I think playing the last two nights is hopefully going to help us as this trip goes along."    The United States will return to the court Friday night in a game against 2002 World Champion Serbia and Montenegro in Belgrade. Friday night's game will be televised by ESPN at 7 p.m. (EDT).  The USA senior men opened their training on July 26 at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Fla., and are pending the 20 days leading up to the start of the 2004 Athens Olympic basketball competition training in Jacksonville; Cologne; Belgrade, Serbia & Montenegro; and Istanbul, Turkey, and will play a total of six exhibition games.   Following the game in Belgrade, the USA Senior National Team will conclude its tour in Istanbul, Turkey. Facing Turkey on Sunday, Aug. 8 in an ABC live nationally televised game (2 p.m. EDT), ESPN will show the Aug. 10 (1 p.m. EDT), USA-Turkey game live.
