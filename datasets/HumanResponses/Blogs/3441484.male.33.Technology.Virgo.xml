      This is my second attempt at blogging...the first one went down in a ball of flames due to my inabilty to actually post anything of substance. Hopefully, this one will last longer!

      Well, I finally remembered what I did on Saturday!  For most of the day...NOTHING!!! Then I went to the bar (Post Office) and worked for a couple of hours. They had a huge wedding in the mall, and Tom was expecting a ton of people. However, that never happened, so I basically went in for nothing!  We might take Amanda driving after we eat. Not sure if I am really ready to do this or not. It means that she is growing up, and I definitely do not want that to happen! Can't stop it though, but that doesn't mean I have to like it!

      This last weekend was VERY short!  I spent most of Sunday in bed with a migraine...I am getting so sick and tired of these stupid things! Just when I think that they are stabilizing...WHAM! They come back and seem to make up for lost time.  I get kind of scared when I think about the cause for the sudden recurrence. I hope that it is just my body getting used to the meds that I have been taking, and maybe simply increasing them will help.  Don't really remember Saturday right now...maybe later it will come to me.  I do remember eating at Taco Bell, but that was LATE Saturday night. Other than that though, it is all a bit hazy...Oh well, it will come to me eventually...I hope. :-)

      We just got back from Sawyer Brown, and I have to be honest...I was kind of disappointed. I was really expecting a better performance. I was also extremely disappointed that they sang a few cover songs. When you go to a concert, you don't expect to hear covers, instead, you are paying to hear THEIR music. And you would think that with 23 years of history, they would have enough songs to last the night!  Oh, well. I will just place this in my list of "Time That I Wish I Could Get Back But Never Will Category"!  However, on a good note, they have cool t-shirts and hats!

      Looks like we (Michelle and I) will be going to see Sawyer Brown in Anderson tonight.   Amanda is having Jesse over, and I had to explain what exactly was not allowed to happen. Previously, we have been very lenient about their behavior, but due to recent events that is going to be changing.  Unfortunately for her the new rules are going to take effect tomorrow and be in effect until further notice. Let's see how she likes them and us after this weekend is over.

      Looks like this will be my second post in two days!! Whoo Hoo! I'm on a roll this time!  Last night I worked the the bar (Post Office Saloon) I was working the door (checking IDs and such). It was kind of wierd again, since I used to work there (behind the bar) and now I'm on the other side missing all the work, and enjoying the experience. I love being the host of a party that I don't have to clean up after or pay for! I also miss having the ability to leave work there and not take it home with me...of course I probably would begin to hate it if I ever went back, because now all I think about are the "good times" and not the bad, but that is the way all memories are.  Well, thanks for reading this installment of nothingness. Maybe I will be able to discipline myself enough to do it again!

      As a new attempt to blog, this one appears to be heading for disaster like the first one. Oh well, easy come, easy go, I guess.  I have tried using some of the other sites, but I can't seem to get past one or two posts before I lose interest, or the desire to maintain anything of substance.  In real-life, I can ramble on and never say anything of great importance, but for some reason, when it comes to online, I get stage fright or something...not really sure why that is. It irritates me to no end sometimes.  Well, I will try to write more later. (We'll see how that goes.)
