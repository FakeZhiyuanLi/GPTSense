      On Friday C and I were listening to the radio are on our way home from school. These days it seems that there are more and more advertisements and worthless music.  Anyways....it was one particular advertisement segment that caught C's ears. It was a commercial for the Hess gas station. That in itself is exciting for C....and the reason would be the fact that this particular gas station sells really cool vehicles during the holiday season. The vehicle of the year is a must have according to C. So the Hess station is "wicked cool" in C's eyes. He believes we must  always  buy gas from the Hess station...."because Hess is best" says Carter.  So...I crank up the volume when I hear that the Hess station is now selling a mini tanker truck for a limited time only. C is instantly psyched. He feels we must drive right this moment to the Hess station because he fears they will sell out of this silly truck if we don't. He pleads his case again and again, but remains fearful that the "limited time only" will end before we get there or they will sell out of this super special truck.  Well, we don't end up at the Hess station instantly....but nearly so. We got there Saturday afternoon, and luckily they still had a few million trucks in stock. The man at the counter suggests that I should buy at least two...one for the kiddo to play with and one to keep in the box. I realize that many probably collect Hess trucks, but I'm not about to become one of those people. One was plenty for us.  http://www.hesstoytruck.com/ Here is the website...go take a look at this "must have".

      I love the mind of a five year old. It is always constantly trying to figure the world out. C is always trying to get to the bottom of things. He always wants to know how and why things work they way they work. Of course I'm always just amazed at what comes out of his mouth. I love the continuous why questions, most of which I have no real answer. So we venture to look things up together....it's fun.  He has such a thirst for knowledge that I hope doesn't fade when he heads off to school...   For example:  Tonight C is in the bathroom brushing his teeth. He wants to know why he can't see germs. He states that it would just be easier to get rid of them if he could just see them. I explain they are really, really tiny and you need a microscope to see them....he's like yeah..."they must be microscopic".  and I'm thinking....Microscopic...where did he pick that up? I also joke around that germs are smart and they know that if they remain super tiny...they can get away with tooth decay.  He then asks what color are germs. This is the question I don't really have an answer to (brown?). This has question has never really crossed my mind. So I tell him that I really don't know, but I can guess that there are all kinds of germs in this world of all sorts of colors. He says...can we get a book about germs?   So...I think I've come across the perfect book to purchase for C....It's title  Those Icky Sticky Smelly Cavity Causing But...Invisible Germs  by Judith Anne Rice , Julie Stricklin.

      So, today was the class field trip to Sturbridge Village (http://www.osv.org/). I had never been, so I was unsure of what to expect. I had a great time and I learned a few things. The kids were keenly interested in everything. They were seriously impressed by all the hydraulic power and the piglets. Their behavior was better than expected, although we were not without issues. They didn't want to leave, and they didn't complain about the raw weather. All in all it was a super day for us.  The one thing I feel sort of guilty about is having one of my aides, Mrs. B. integrate two of our students with 7 other 8th graders. She was solely responsible for all 9 kids. I felt it was a great opportunity for these two social butterflies from my class to spread their wings in a relaxed situation without the expectation of academics. My aide was less than impressed that I had volunteered her for the job, but unlike other days...I decided to be mean and green. I was not going to back down, although I sort of wanted to spend the day with the social butterflies because they are really cool kids. I suppose I must explain that this woman would not be happy with any decision that I made, so in essence it really does not matter...but I somehow still feel guilty since I didn't give her a choice and I typically give at least two options and I told her this right before we boarded the bus. I would have volunteered to be with the girls, but my other 5 students are much less independent and require a whole host of challenges that this particular aide refuses to do....so I really didn't have an option. Turns out the 7 kids that she was in charge of...really took advantage of her, so she had an awful day. This part I really don't feel that guilty about since she could have decided to handle the minor situation before the major situation arose. This is not how she operates, so she became the victim of these 13 year olds. It's pretty sad that she cannot handle 7 kids that were hand picked as "good kids"...she did not have any wise guys. All I have to say is 17.5 days left.

      18.5 days of school is left, but who is counting?  I've been counting down since the 12 week mark. I believe most if not all teachers exhibit this type of behavior. Teachers are typically more eager for summer break than students, believe it or not. I am most excited this year about summer break considering it is the very first summer that I am not required to teach the summer program. It is super exciting to plan summertime fun, although I look at the calendar and realize the summer is going to be super busy! We hope to go camping sometime this summer. We are also planning many visits to the beach,  the science museum, and the zoo. Of course I could never forget the annual trip to my parent's house.  Included in all the fun this summer, I have signed up to work for the department of education for two weeks. Weirdly I am wicked excited about it. Most likely because I will be surrounded by several other special education teachers, just as nerdy as I am. Probably the most major event of the summer is the big move. Josh and I have decided that co-habitation is a good idea.  It was actually C's idea. C claims "It will just be easier." Josh and I agree.  But....before I get lost in all of the glorious summer plans...I must admit these last days of school are rough. The kids are simply out to lunch. This week at school it's Heritage week. A week of project based history lessons while more than half of the 8th grade class is in Washington D.C. It's total chaos and I'm not quite sure who in the world is in charge of the circus. Thankfully I cannot take any credit for the chaos. Luckily, tomorrow we are going a field trip. Thunderstorms are predicted and it is basically an outdoor trip. Fire up.  I like thunderstorms.

      It's a Monday. It's rainy. It's lighting. I have a mountain of school work to accomplish sometime this lifetime. And I seem to have a rugrat in my bed. He's snoring but super cute. He has been wanting a slumber party....but this is not what I had in mind. I'm exhausted...but I simply just do not sleep well with C in the bed. Somehow his feet always find my ears...so back to the grind of tackling the school work. 20.5 days of school remaining.

      Today was C's annual trip to Children's Hospital to see the metabolism people and have some neuropsych testing completed to ensure that C remains on track. C always enjoys the trip...I could pass on the trip. I simply just do not enjoy this place...probably since I still have a sour taste in my mouth from our first visit with the less than friendly quack.  Anyways...  Most everyone reading this blog realizes that I have had C on a restricted diet since he was just a few days old. This is when I found out that he had shown up as galactosemic on the newborn screening tests. They instantly put him on a soy formula. I have since become the label reading Natzi to ensure that what C is eating is safe. Currently the kid doesn't do any dairy, or anything containing any dairy products whatsoever including whey and casein. When we lived in the Midwest, the metabolism people there supported the restricted diet that C was on. They told me it was conservative...but agreed that there isn't evidence to say that a typical diet which includes an average amount of dairy is completely and utterly safe. It was when we moved to MA that the metabolism people started trying to reassure me that a typical diet was completely okay...although they couldn't provide me with any long term studies or any sort of statistics. They acted like I was crazy for keeping him on this restricted diet. Of course I didn't believe anything they said. Why would I change his diet if he was thriving? Why would I chance all the repercussions (mental retardation, cataracts and liver damage)? What if the doctors were wrong? And lets face it...doctors are human and sometimes they are wrong. It just seems so risky in my parent opinion that I have never been okay with this idea.   So...once again the metabolism team reassures me today that the current "trend" is to put the kids on typical diets. They make the claim that everyone they have ever seen with C's type of galactosemia are able to switch back to a regular diet without any problems. Okay..okay...okay. I get it. I'm the crazy overprotective mother. The doctor today spent a decent amount of time showing me charts and describing everything in detail. This is something the people here at this hospital have never done with us...so it was surprising, but finally I seem to be getting the information that I need to help ease my worries. I guess they realized I need cold hard facts before I could make any sort of decision.   The mutation analysis that was completed last year, revealed that Carter carries one copy of the classic galactosemia mutation (Q188R) and one copy of the Duarte variant mutation (N314D). Apparently there is typically adequate residual enzyme activity for galactose metabolism.  Therefore, dietary restrictions are not typically recommended. Great. The other diet issue with C...is the fact that he is allergic to milk. So, when we visit the allergist in a few weeks...we will see if he has grown out of his milk allergy. If he has, C may begin the switch to a more typical diet.   The switch may be long and probably never a complete switch to a typical diet. I can't ever seem to imagine C eating cheese pizza...but who knows. I think we may stick to the soy products for quite some time. He doesn't mind the soy milk, so I can't really imagine switching to cow milk. I think I will begin with food items containing milk or whey...and we'll see how things go.  This is yet another great reason for me to stay at home with C this summer...I need to monitor his new diet like a hawk.

      It was a good weekend to just hang out...and relax.  Yesterday we were out on a walk since C thought he wanted to climb some trees and Josh and I just wanted to be outside. During this walk we witnessed more than one boat capsized in the Charles River. Yikes is all I have to say. That's just how windy it really was. C was mesmorized at the sight of a capsized boat.  I was just glad I wasn't expected to go sailing on this day. While I enjoy sailing, I don't think I would enjoy swimming in the Charles River.  It was also a good weekend to spend an evening in Harvard Square watching all the street performers. Along with the street performers, there is always plenty of people watching to be had. I can't even begin to blog what I witnessed. It makes for great Saturday night entertainment.  C got a kick out of Josh grilling this afternoon. I suppose grilling is a male thing, which is why C was instantly intrigued by this manly behavior...but Josh is comical in the fact that he throws the grill out the window onto the fire escape then hangs out the window to do the grilling thing.  That's city dwelling I suppose.

      7.5 days of school left. It's both exciting and sad all at the same time....you see I've been sort of looking around for another teaching position. While I like my current position, I would just absolutely love to be back in a high school. Middle school is just very different than I expected and my current school district is less than ideal. I'm happy to say that I've been offered a life skills teaching position in an urban setting without really searching.  I haven't made any decisions officially, but I am leaning towards the high school.  =)  So while I can't wait for summer to begin....it's heart wrenching thinking that these will most likely be the last days with my current students. I'm savoring the last few days and taking lots of pictures. The kids are keeping things together well these last few days...the class is excited since the principal has invited us to go out to lunch tomorrow at his favorite restaurant...Imperial Buffet. It's going to be lots of fun. I grilled the kids with table manners and polite conversation topics...I hope my effort pays off.   In other news... Josh and I finally signed the lease to the apartment in Newton. We are both very excited, but most excited is C. I've never lived with anyone that I've been involved with before...so it is sure to be an adventure full of compromises. I also know that I get pretty neurotic sometimes with school work and keep the craziest of hours with papers throughout the house...so we'll see how that all works out. Anyways...It's a two family house and we will live on the first floor.  C adores the house since it has a private backyard. It'll be C's very first backyard....so I'm sure lots and lots of fun will take place there. Josh and I adore the kitchen. As they say in the Midwest, the kitchen is the heart of a house...and I think this will be true is this home. The kitchen has a dishwasher...so it meets my standards regardless. The rest of the house is pretty cozy and seems to be a pretty sunny place which is definitely key. I actually can't believe that this is going to take place in just a few weeks...I had best start packing.

      The last few days have been such a blur. I have no idea how many days of school are left and I'm not even quite sure what day it is.  What I do know is that it is fry an egg on the sidewalk weather.    Today the class took another fun filled field trip. This field trip took a lot of sweat to plan, so yesterday when plans all had to change for the 5th time...I was ready just to call it all off. But today is another day. We ventured to Battleship Cove in Fall River. It was really neat with lots and lots to see. I'll throw some great pics up later. The kids all agree that it was the best trip we've taken this year.  In other news...I finally purchased a bike. I have wanted a bike since I gave mine away when I moved from IN. That was just about 2.5 years ago. I also purchased a "trail a bike" for C. This neat device is essentially a tandem bicycle attachment. C can pedal or simply coast. It's great. Josh, C, and I decided to try the new bikes out on Saturday. I have this book of short bike rides in eastern MA that I picked up at the Goodwill. We looked through it and decided to go to a place that was somewhat familiar to at least one of us. We ended up in Josh's home town. It was a great ride, just at 15 miles. I didn't think C would last...but he made it. So hopefully this weekend's weather will be decent and we can hit the minute man trail.

      Alright...after one day of organizing, cleaning, and packing....my mind cannot get over the fact that I'm on the move....AGAIN. I honestly feel that I just finished unpacking...and here I am throwing those same heavy books right back into boxes. I think I must be delirious.   So just over a year ago...  I would have never guessed in a million years that I would be moving in with someone this summer. (Well, that isn't exactly true...considering I almost moved in with another single mother last spring to cut living costs and live in a fabulous suburban home.)But honestly, I would have never have guess that I would be in a relationship. We all know that dating was something that I just didn't really do. I was simply too busy and I felt that my life was full. Besides I hadn't ran into any datable men in quite some time, nor would I have seen any if they had knocked on my door. Strange...how life happens when you are least expecting. And I honestly can't believe that the year has passed so quickly....time flies when you are having fun.  While C, Josh and I are pretty excited about moving in together...I know for certain that we could both just pass on this whole packing, moving, and unpacking ordeal. As a matter of fact....I'd like to fast forward to August. That sounds perfect. The thought of moving day makes my stomach just turn. I must keep in mind the end result. I used to really enjoy the process of moving, but I suppose the novelty wears off....especially since I am going to have lived in 3 apartments in a 12 month period. Insane isn't it? I suppose life could be worse....C and I could still be living in the horrid apartment in Worcester with the mean neighbors. I'll get off my soap box and get back to packing...

      It's the first day of summer for me. It's glorious. Just glorious. Another year under the belt.  The fact that school is finally over has not quite sunk in yet...it is very strange to be at home today. The day is full of cleaning, organizing, and planning for the move. It's not very summer-like and I'm not exactly enjoying myself. There is so much to do. How on Earth do I have so much stuff? It was not the ideal Mommy morning and I'm feeling pretty guilty about the entire ordeal this morning. I would much rather be at the beach. It would just be easier.

      I'm not sure how life gets to the frantic mode, but I do know that when the mode strikes....life is hairy.   So it's Thursday afternoon (June 17, 2004). I get into my car to pick up C-man. On my way there...I realize it is astonishingly difficult to stop the vehicle. It doesn't seem like the brakes themselves, especially since I just put brakes on the blazer last year...but something is definitely not right. I'm not a mechanic nor do I pretend to be one. So on Friday morning....I drive carefully to school, slow and steady and take it to a decent repair shop that all the teachers recommend. I love my vehicle with all of my heart....but it does have nearly 218,000 miles on it, so I was terribly scared that they would say the blazer's life is over and direct me to the nearest used car lot.  So when I picked the car up after school on Friday, the man was like....lady you are going to have to take this car to the dealer. There is no way I can even begin to fix this problem. He isn't sure what the problem is...so it's very reassuring. He also kindly adds that it is definitely not safe to drive and I should get it towed to the Chevy dealer.   I must also mention that this particular Friday is one that has a very special event. You see...the chief physician that Josh works for is stepping down as chief...so there was this celebration of his career. Very nice. I was excited to meet some of the people Josh works with. Except that I'm stuck with an unsafe vehicle and I'm expected to be in the city in just a few hours. I don't have time to get a tow or to even think about my hairy legs that desperately need to be shaved if I plan on wearing a dress. So, I must risk driving the unsafe vehicle if I plan on making the 4 o-clock train. I know, it sounds a bit ridiculous....but I figured I had driven it to school, I could probably make the 15 minute trip home to the dealer. That's just what I did.   So I arrive at the dealer in frantic mode. They have no idea when they can look at my car so I tell them I'm more than happy to leave the car for as long as need be....besides what choice to I really have? And more importantly they do not have a courtesy vehicle that will take C and  I to the train station so we can get into the city. What dealer does not offer this service? So instead of demanding a ride, which I might have if we had had more time or if it was raining or something....we are forced to quickly walk to the train station in 20 minutes. It's a good thing C is so flexible. He knows when I'm on edge and when things are really important. He basically ran all the way to the station. Poor C. We made it on the train...but just as we do, I remember that I left my entire key ring at the Chevy dealer which has the keys to Josh's apartment on them....  As crazy as it sounds...thing do settle down, thankfully. The rest of the evening was great. We make it into the city on time, and Josh and I make it to the big event at a reasonable time. The evening was lovely. It was one of the rare childless nights for me, so I wasn't difficult to satisfy. I was quite honored to be there actually. I met a lot of people and received an ear full of many others. This ear full made for the most distorted first impression of some....I must recommend that all the dancing doctors keep their day job....and the doctor dressed as Elvis really made the night shine.   In other good news, I now have the car back in my possession and it is back to it's old self again. I couldn't help but pamper the blazer a bit. She's a survivor. I can only hope that she survives another winter with me.

      So today was my first day working for the DOE (department of education) as a scorer for the alternate MCAS. I felt like I was at summer camp for teachers. This included a steady stream of M&M's, coffee, and teacher talk.   The good news is...I passed the exam and I'm now a "qualified scorer". Whoo-hoo! I wonder if there will be s'mores tomorrow?

      After spending my very first day of summer packing and being less than happy about spending the day locked up in the apartment with a million and one things to do...I decided that a beach day was in order for Friday. So Michele, C, and I headed out early for the beach on Friday. C absolutely loves the beach....I mean he LOVES the beach like nothing else on this Earth. So he was delighted to be headed to the beach this fine Friday.   It was an okay day to be at the beach. I was a little nervous we would get rained on....but we didn't. It was a little gray and muggy, but not extremely hot. The beach wasn't crowded, but of course there was plenty of opportunities to people watch (including a family of 17). C was so ecstatic to be at the beach....running around playing in the sand and splashing in the water. It was a great day, except for the fact that I ended up with a decent sunburn on my face. I felt like Rudolph all weekend long. It was gross and somewhat painful. I assume I have to now put sunscreen on hourly when I am at the beach. All in all it was a lot of fun to put off the packing fun and other responsibilities to spend the day with C at his favorite playground.

      I've managed to avoid the blog for over a month. Wow. Life has been spinning for last few weeks and I believe it is beginning to settle for a bit. Just enough for me to catch my breath before school begins.  So....  We survived the big move. The week before I left for my annual summer trip to my parents I was suppose to be working for the DOE. Luckily, work ended early so I had a few extra days to pack and prepare....Which was seriously needed. During this week I heard word that my beloved Nana had passed. My Nana is one of the funniest, spirited ladies I have ever known in my life and she lives on in the hearts of many of my family members and friends. It was a difficult and stressful time for many close relatives which was so difficult to watch from afar. My Nana is very much missed, but I am so thankful she has found a peaceful place.  Carter and I made the journey to Georgia pretty effortlessly....but we did manage to see toll booth takers kissing on our way to the airport. I'm so glad that there are added benefits to that job. I had a blast visiting with my parents, my sister, and her two adorable kids while managing to hit all the thrift shops in the area. The beach was also great. You can actually get into the water and not freeze. Leaving Carter at my parents for the extra week wasn't nearly as hard this year. Most likely because I wasn't coming home to an empty house and because Carter loves spending time with his grandparents. Besides he looks forward to this trip all year long. He had an excellent time. He is still talking about Sea World and the many trips to the beach. He is already talking about next summer's trip.  The trip home from Georgia for me was uneventful. The next day Josh and I loaded all of my things into the moving truck. Not to my surprise, all of my junk fills the 25 foot truck....and I had gotten rid of my bed and my futon. Of course the next morning.....it's raining. Apparently this is part of the curse of Josh. According to Josh's parents he is notorious for moving in the rain. So I must say it was an experience I've had and I don't think I'd like to endure again. To our surprise.....the previous tenants have not moved all of their things out of the house nor is the house clean. Josh rants about the window sills being dirty.....but I found hair in the freezer, dirty finger prints all over the kitchen wall, and empty wine bottles throughout the house. Which I think explains why things were just left. Everything was just utterly filthy and I'm not exactly Miss clean. I made Josh complain to the landlord and he sent his cleaning lady. My mother nor I have ever had a cleaning lady....so to come home to a house that has been cleaned.....was just amazing.  So....Josh and I have been living together for 2 weeks at this point. We had a lot of fun and things are going well. We love this apartment (I'll throw up pics soon!) and its location. It's great. Carter absolutely adores his backyard. He has never had a backyard before, and I must say the kid truly appreciates this space. We have settled in pretty well and now we are now getting to know Newton. 23 days to savor before school begins.....
