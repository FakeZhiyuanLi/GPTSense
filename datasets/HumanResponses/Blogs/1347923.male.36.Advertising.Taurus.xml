      So, this week is flying by pretty quickly.  Thank God.    I have to start running in the mornings again.  I know for sure I'm going to turn 35 next month, because for the first time in my life, I have a nice layer of cushioning around my midsection.  It makes these very appealing rolls when I'm seated.  Lovely.    And how is  your  day?

      The new Suede CD has been out in the rest of the world since September.  Since there seems to be no U.S. release date in sight, I finally broke down and downloaded it from a P2P service.  "A New Morning" is different for them.  Stephen Street produced it and you can definitely tell the shift in sound.  It's also their first album recorded "without hallucinegens" (what a great selling point), so gone are the bizarre strings and background soundscapes that made up a large portion of their mood.    The goofy wordplay that makes Suede so appealing remains.  My favorite line comes from "Obessions" (a great song) -- "It's the way you don't read Camus/Or Brett Easton Ellis...It's the TCP you use/That stings when we kiss".  Goofy and sublime.

       The Pretty Things Have Gone to Hell  Bowie, Bowie, Bowie.  All things Bowie this week.  Found the 2 DVD set at Circuit City for only $24.99, snatched it up and have been watching/listening to Bowie since Sunday.  I knew he was influencial, but really had no first-hand knowledge into  how much so .    Favorite parts:  The Dick Cavett Show performance from 1974 is a definite highlight.  This was during Bowie's Thin White Powder period and he is coked up to the max.  He sweats his way through this live performance of "Young Americans" while a young, but fat, Luther Vandross sings background and dances like a little queen.  Beautiful.  "Boys Keep Swinging" - prime example of the Triology period with Bowie in drag as not one, not two, but three different fucked up ladies.  Great dancing, too, and that's not an ironic statement.  Nice moves.  There are even some gems from the later period, such as the Earthling videos and the Pet Shop Boys duet version of "Hallo Spaceboy".  But sweet Christ, the "Hours" videos are still dead boring.   In other dumb stuff:   urlLink  continues its downward slide to suckiness.  More postings by street teamers, wannabes and Franz.  Ugh.  It used to be a nice place, with more than average discourse.  We'll see how it goes.

      omigoditotallyhadthreecupsofextrastrongcoffeeandtworippedfueltabletsthismorning andmyhandsareshakingandi'mramblinglikeaTinafreakomigodmyheartmystrokeohdearlordylordy  Sigh.  Seriously, I can barely type.  What the fuck?  My blood pressure is really gonna love this.    So, Friendster.  Let's dish Friendster, shall we?  Sure.  In theory, not a bad idea.  Network amongst your inner circle, see inside their inner circles, meet other people, etc.  And of course, the infusion of homos has turned it into yet another online tricking service (seriously, don't we have  enough ?  Have you ever gotten Friendster Add Requests from complete, total strangers who want nothing more from you than to use you to rack up their Friendster odometer?  Bizarre.     We interrupt this meaningless ramble to bring you Breaking Easter Weekend News  ATLANTA -  About 100 men and women gathered outside Atlanta's Roman Catholic cathedral Thursday to protest the archbishop's exclusion of women from the Holy Thursday foot-washing ritual.    We now return to our program, already in progress   Huh?  What the--?  Just read that news story again and remind yourself it's 2004.  Jesus Christ, pun intended.  So, Friendster.  Good things:  It's put me in touch with quite a few people I've lost contact with over the years, most recently (today, even) Richard, aka SDavenport from my old Morrissey-Solo.com posting days.  Ahhhh, the mid-90s, when the web was new, Morrissey was over and we all took solace at that web refuge.    Morrissey.  New single out May 4.  New album out May 18.  New material I've heard is actually pretty good.  Can the old girl do it?  With a song called "All the Lazy Dykes", I had hope for the first time in a decade.

       Fucking Woof  I suppose I need to face it.  I'm BearBait.  BearBait am I.  I have the latent mutant power to attract stocky, hairy white guys.  I can't say I really blame them for thinking I'm a "cub".  I mean, let's go down the checklist:  •  Shaved head?  Check. •  Hairy chest?  Check. •  Some form of facial hair (at least I don't have the ubiquitous goatee)?  Check. •  Propensity to end up in such bear hangouts as "The Hole", "Mineshaft" and "Faultline", usually dragged there against my will by bear-loving friends?  Check.  Now luckily, I've been able to use my "muscle bear" (ick) status to some degree of success in finding men I'm attracted to, so I can't really complain.  In fact, to complain that any type of person in general finds you attractive is kind of disgusting and petty in the first place.  I just wish there was a bit more originality involved in the whole scene.  You can filter the entire "bear community" to one word:  "Woof."  "Woof."  Fucking woof.  Yeesh.  Grown men have said this to me.  Perfect strangers in their thirties and forties have shambled up to me in bars, and leaning into my face so closely I could taste the beer off their tongues, have looked into my boobs and said "woof".    Whatever happened to a simple "Hey", or "Hello"?  "Woof."  Again, yeesh.  I have a message for all bears, cubs, beavers, otters and manatees -- STOP SAYING "WOOF".  It makes you look juvenile, infantile and inarticulate.  Which, granted, can be totally hot on some people.  But in my case, the "woof" word sends a shiver down my spine, and not the good ones that end in erections.  If anything, it's a penis softener.    NO MORE FUCKING "WOOFS".  I mean it, bitches.

       GodWatch 2004  He just keeps on killing.  He must be stopped!  from WFTV.com: ROSE HILL, Va. -- The minister of a church in far  southwest Virginia has died after being bitten by a snake during  church services.    Authorities say the Reverend Dwayne Long of Rose Hill was bitten  by a rattlesnake Sunday afternoon and refused to seek medical  treatment. He died early Monday at his home.    Lee County Sheriff Gary Parsons says Long was a minister at a  Pentecostal church where members practice serpent-handling.    Parsons says Long was holding a rattlesnake during an Easter  service when the snake bit him on the back of a finger. He says the  congregation prayed for the minister, but no one -- including Long  -- sought medical treatment.    The sheriff says he doubts any charges will be filed, because,  in his words, "it's their belief."  These are the people who believe they know what's right for you.  Yay!

       God is gracious  A 15-year-old Romanian altar boy fell into a coma after a church bell fell on his head during an Easter service in his village in eastern Romania, police said today.   The boy, who was a regular worshipper at the Orthodox church in the village of Movila Verde, was standing in the wooden bell tower during the Easter service yesterday when the bronze bell broke loose and smashed onto his head, fracturing his skull and legs.

       Annoying Chat/Profile Things - #34 in a series  PEOPLE WHO POST PICS OF THEMSELVES FLIPPING OFF THE CAMERA  While cute the first, second and 4,000th time it was done, this tired image needs to be put down.  What the person is attempting to say is "Hey!  Lookit me!  I'm a rebel and I'll never be no good.  Fuck the man, lookit how punk I am!  I have a baaaad attitude."  What the person is  actually  saying is "I am bereft of any ideas or original thought, so I must resort to the Hollywood Shorthand method of displaying my 'badassness.'"  Stop it.  Be yourself.  Unless of course, you ARE actually bereft of any ideas or original thought, then by all means, fake it.

       The return of the Thin White Duke / Throwing darts in lovers' eyes...  Sorry I've been away for a week or so.  Just getting over my latest Bowie high...went to see La Bowie in Anaheim last Friday at Arrowhead Pond, home of the Mighty Ducks.  My first time there to see a show, and I have to say, the venue was pretty neat.  A large floor seating area, an upper loge, topped off with an upper balcony.  Via the magic of BowieNet, I was able to get two front row center balcony seats, which in terms of pure visibility and sound, were probably the best seats in the house.  I had the pleasure of sharing my tickets with Emile, a Bowie virgin.  This makes two Bowie virgins whose Bowie cherries I've popped in one year.  I'm such a Bowie whore.  Polyphonic Spree opened the show with about an hour of freaky "Let the Sunshine In" Godspell-meets-Flaming Lips weirdness.  A large group of about 25 or so musicians in long, flowing white robes crowded the stage - half made up a small choir, while the rest played drums, keyboards, french horns, even a harp.   They sang hippy-dippy singalongs, including a cover of "Ride, Captain, Ride", and each song stretched to around seven minutes in length, so what at the beginning was amusing, soon became torture (evidenced by the shouts of "YOU SUUUUUCK!" at each silent point of the set).  GOOD:  The show started precisely on time at 7:30.  BAD:  It lasted over an hour.  After a short break (just in time for me to grab a couple of $7.50 beers and take a quick squirt), Bowie came out just like two months ago, opening with the quiet version of "Rebel, Rebel".  He then proceeded to do nearly the same setlist I saw two months prior at the Shrine.  The only surprises came in the form of a revamped version of "The Supermen" and an inspired reading of "Quicksand" which brought a little lump in my "Hunky Dory" loving throat.    All the funny, spontaneous, off the cuff remarks from two months ago also returned in exactly the same places they were back then, which made them seem slightly less off the cuff and spontaneous.  But hey, this is a guy who also choreographs shows to the most minute detail, so whaddaya expect.  Once again, we got "My little china girl / she says / just SHUT THE FUCK UP", which, once again got a big laugh.  Give 'em what they want.    I'm a little sad that I've discovered Bowie after he retired so many of the "hits" he's sick of playing live.  It would be great to hear "Young Americans" or especially "Boys Keep Swinging" or "Station to Station", but I guess those days are long gone, and he's intent on sticking to his goal of not being a jukebox of old songs.  GOOD:  A medley of "Sunday" and "Heathen (The Rays)" that was smoothly done and genuinely moving.  BAD:  A subpar duet of "Under Pressure" with bassist Gail Ann Dorsey, who sounded MUCH better at the Shrine.  She must have had an off night.    Bottom line:  He's still got it, and for $20 less than a Morrissey ticket.  Take that, you whiny bitch tosser!

       "You're all just parasiiiiites / Robbing me of luvvvvvvvvv..."  Got both my Time/Life SCTV DVDs and the Kids in the Hall Season One boxed set on the same day this week and I think if I geek out any harder I just may piss my Yoda Underoos.  The SCTV discs are probably my Holy Grail of TV on DVD releases, with the possible exception of a "Fridays" release (which doesn't seem likely anytime soon), so I was pretty thrilled when those finally arrived (Hell, I even skipped chest and tris day).  The transfer is kind of shitty, which only added to the thrill - it was like watching bootlegged old VHS dubs.  Niiice.  I like that feel, although I know it's wholly unintentional.  I've only gotten through one full episode so far (Lola Heatherton's "Bouncin' Back to You" special - my all-time favorite) and it's incredible, just as funny in full 90-minute form as I remembered.    I also watched the "SCTV Remembers" documentary, with new interviews with everyone but Rick Moranis and Martin Short.  Maybe next time.  Some good stories here, but Joe Flaherty comes off as one of those guys you went to high school with who never really moved on and wishes all the gang would hang out together everyday "just like the old days".  Catherine O'Hara comes off as surprisingly bitchy in reference to the men dominating the writing and a little greedy when it comes to the money they made (or didn't make as females).  Justified, I'm sure, but a little tacky to bring up in a tribute documentary.    I'll talk about the Kids in the Hall on my next posting.  Now, it's time to head out and watch the "Friends" finale.  If it doesn't end with Ross marrying Marcel the Monkey, I'm gonna be  pissed.

       Say it, don't spray it  Now that Blogger has finally rolled out its redesign, you can now post comments to any of my ramblings.  Feel free to do so - tear me a new one if you're so inclined.   I Have Forgiven Jesus  Grabbed a promo copy of the new Morrissey CD "You Are the Quarry", and I have to say, Mozzer should take eight years between albums from now on.  It's really quite good.  It seems Moz sat down and spent some actual time on the lyrics, evidenced especially in "All the Lazy Dykes" and "I Have Forgiven Jesus".  ATLD is funny when you consider he's urging a woman to come out, hang out with the lesbians and "begin her life"...uhhh, pot, kettle, etc.  Good stuff, though.  Buy it Tuesday.

      Looking at the clock, I see that it’s just about to turn 2 o’clock in the morning.  My stomach knots up even more than it has been, the churning and tightening getting worse with each jerky movement of the second hand.  I feel like vomiting, but there’s nothing to be forced out.  My eyes continually sting with tears that won’t form fully and refuse to fall from their ducts.  I feel like I’m spinning, but I haven’t had a drop of liquor to drink.  In less than three hours, a man in full Army fatigues will arrive at the front door of my home at 183 Spruce Street in quiet, suburban Elyria, Ohio, and drive me to my first day of Army Basic Training.  It is November 28th, 1988, and at 5 o’clock in the morning, my entire life will change forever.  Sleep is impossible.  I said goodnight to my mother, step-father and sisters around 10 o’clock, ostensibly to lay down and rest my body in preparation for what I’m sure will be the first day of the toughest phase of my life.  Instead, I find myself lying on my bedroom floor, headphones on, listening to the same song on the same CD again and again:   The last night on Maudlin Street  Goodbye house, goodbye stairs  I was born here  And I was raised here… And I took some stick here   I find solace in Morrissey’s lyrics, like so many times before.  But tonight is markedly different, the circumstances making the words seem even more poetic and prophetic.  “Late Night, Maudlin Street” is on repeat in my head, the verses about leaving behind home and family resounding more clearly than they ever have.  I look outside my second story window and watch the impending winter’s wind move the tree branches, as the song begins again.  Morrissey speaks softly:   Winter is coming Winter is so long Winter moves on   It is November 28th, 1988, and at 5 o’clock in the morning, my entire life will change forever.  I think about what led me to this point, a teenage life filled with moments both equally joyous and turbulent.  Living at three different addresses in four short high school years, leaving old friends behind and making new ones, but tentatively so (after all, why get attached when you’ll just have to move again soon anyway?).  Bouncing from living with my mother and verbally (and sometimes physically) abusive step-father to living with my father and verbally abusive step-mother.  Living with two sets of parents who offer not a single word of encouragement, praise or hope for the future between them.  Living in an extended family where academic excellence is not something to be recognized and rewarded, but to be met with ridicule and scorn for opportunities that never came for those who sired you.  Living where it’s not anything resembling “living” at all, and to stay means one thing: working in the factory and fading to obscurity.  The Army is an alternative to this life.  The Army is a welcome escape.  I didn’t think twice as I held the pen in the recruiter’s office.  I even signed my full name, just for added dramatic flair;  John Charles Blahblah.  You’re in the Army now.  I change tracks on the CD to two songs ahead.   You say Break up the family And let’s begin to live our lives I want to see all my friends tonight   It is November 28th, 1988, and at 5 o’clock in the morning, my entire life will change forever.  I think about the true friends I’m leaving behind in Bumfuck, Ohio.  Bryan.  Brandon.  Ed.  Adam.  There are others, too – Rob, Marc, Jim and Gus.  But they’re like me…no rich, or even successfully middle-class parents who could afford to send them to college.  So, together we made our choices.  Rob chose the Air Force.  Marc chose the Navy.  Gus, Jim and I joined the Army.  Three years later, while home on leave, I find out that Jim was dishonorably discharged after one year of service for “mental instability and inability to conform to military life.”  I hear through the grapevine that his wrists are scarred.  But thankfully, this knowledge comes later so it doesn’t stain my expectations of what’s in store for the next four years of my life.   So, wish me luck my friends, goodbye Wish me luck my friends, goodbye   Somewhere between songs and replayed memories, I have fallen asleep.  I come to realize this only when my mother is suddenly in my room, gently nudging me awake from my slumber on the floor.  It’s 4 o’clock in the morning.  It’s time to shower, gather my things, and say a final, sleepy farewell.  The next 60 minutes are a blur.  I seem to be floating, watching myself do my morning ritual as I’ve done it hundreds of times before.  I’m soon in the living room, sitting with my mother and little sister.  They are crying.  The doorbell rings.  My ride is here.  It is November 28th, 1988.  It is 5 o’clock in the morning, on the dot.     So, let’s begin to live our lives.

      "I'm a true fairy," Jobriath exclaimed, putting any debate over his true sexuality to rest, becoming rock music's first openly gay superstar.  It's just that the superstar part never happened, despite hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of hype.  An in-your-face, outrageous gay rock star.  The kind of glittery glamster Bowie, Reed and Pop only hinted at being.  The year was 1973 and America was having none of it.  While he paved his own way, he was derided as merely a cheap American Bowie clone (never mind that Jobriath was rocking the pierrot clown hat and white makeup a full seven years before Bowie would do so in the "Ashes to Ashes" video).    Despite bright hopes, heaps of talent, and sass to spare, "Jobriath" Bruce Wayne Campbell died of AIDS in 1983, alone in his suite at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City after a life filled with sex, drugs and booze.  Gossip says four days passed before his body was discovered.    He left behind two albums, his 1973 self-title debut and "Creatures of the Night", released just six months after the first.  After that his label, Elektra, dropped him and Jobriath retired from the music industry.  Years later, admirers such as Morrissey and movies such as "Velvet Goldmine" have touched upon his legacy, but it's a crying shame that gay people at large have no idea who this man was.  To be an out rocker in 1973!  Unreal.    You can find a few Jobriath tracks on Limewire, or listen to the entire first and second albums here at Ron "Boogiemeister's" excellent  urlLink "Crap From the Past" homepage.     Strange note:  Spellchecker suggestion for "Jobriath"?   "Sobriety."

       Signs You've Been Working in Advertising Creative Too Long  When you're at your local Gay Pride Parade and you're more offended by the shitty line breaks and bad color choices on the "God Hates Fags" signs than you are by the content.  Although shouting "GOD HATES SHITTY GRAPHIC DESIGN!" during quiet lulls gets a few chuckles from the crowd.  Not that I'd know or nuthin'...

       Graphic Designer Porn  A couple hours of VH1 Mega Hits this weekend has led to me to a new subgenre:  Graphic Designer Porn.  Heavy on inventive use of typography and bold, new-yet-retro design, these videos give the designer geek in me a big chubby.  Liz Phair's video for "Why Can't I?" makes the most boring song on her otherwise fun album a visual treat, presenting a primer on neat typography spread out over a series of mock-uped classic album covers.  Niiiice.  Black Eyed Peas' "Hey Mama" vid is just fucking killer, with judicious use of '70s blaxploitation design and color, alongside some impressive choreography.  The song is annoying, but it's oh, so nice to watch.  Graphic Designer PR0N.  Love it.

      It was when I saw the combination stand-up shower/pistol shooting range located underground adjacent to the huge swimming pool that I had to stop and remind myself of how I came to be here.  Here I was, a regular middle-class gay dude from Cleveland, Ohio, at an honest-to-gosh Hollywood Pool Party during the Memorial Day weekend up in the hills at the home of a huge, HUGE, HYOOOGE movie starlet.  Yes, you know her.  Yes, she’s A-list.  No, I’m not going to reveal who it was for a few reasons: •  I was an invited guest, and it would be rude to name names and dish all her private info for all twenty people who read this to see, •  She wasn’t even there.  I mean, how fucking cool and Hollywood is it to throw a huge pool bash at your home and then   not even bother to attend.   That is so hot. •  And I want to be invited back next year.   I thought about getting all  urlLink Ted Casablanca  on your ass and dropping a few obscure blind item-type references so you could put it all together and figure out who it was, but that still struck me as being a little rude.  Besides, the point of this story isn’t to talk about the starlet – it’s to talk about all the übergay Hollywood homos that ran roughshod all over her property for about eight hours last Saturday.  Let’s backtrack a bit.  I came to be invited to this to-do because a good friend is a friend of the starlet’s former personal assistant who in turn is now tricking with her current P.A. How very L.A.  Networking, people, networking!  When I first got the call to go, I actually considered turning down the invite, feeling in my gut that I wouldn’t fit in with the fast-track celeb gushers.  Besides, it started early on a Saturday afternoon, and that’s prime chest and tris time.  But, in the interest of keeping fresh material flowing for the blog, I decided to bite the bullet and suffer.  Aw, who am I kidding?  I  had  to see this spread for myself.  When we arrived up the hills and through the (open) gated driveway to the house, the first thing that struck me was that it wasn’t an enormous mansion, but rather a quite nice, normal, large-sized, two-story home, with a smallish backyard and a spectacular view of downtown Los Angeles and most of the city.  Next to the main house was a figure-eight shaped pool, with a diving board on one end and a volleyball net on the other.  The pool separated the main house from the slightly smaller guesthouse, where the starlet’s P.A. lives (rent free, the lovely fucker).  Speaking of which, the starlet’s P.A. and former P.A. couldn’t have been nicer hosts.  They are both great guys, funny, articulate and friendly.  Which is why I had such trouble understanding why they were friends with most of their invitees.  Ah, the other party guests…so many stories, but we’ll focus on three people in particular, who we dubbed Holy Diver (after the  kick ass  Dio song, of course), Kaballah Ken and, of course, Chrissy Snow.  That’s where we’ll pick up next time.  It’s worth the wait, promise.

       urlLink A recap for those just joining us.   At this point, we had been at the party for about an hour and it was a nice, mellow affair, with about 20 to 30 other guys of all types, from bearish dudes, to muscleheads, alterna-homos and twinks galore.  There were even a few stray hags here and there (not sure about the dyke quotient…wasn’t getting that vibe from anyone).  As  urlLink Brini Maxwell   would say, a good mix of people is essential to any successful get-together.  Everyone was doing that early-in-the-party thing, hanging with their individual little groups, looking across the pool at the other little groups, a smile here, a nod there.  Finally, the bear contingent (God bless ‘em) broke the ice by stripping down to their shorts and launching huge cannonballs off the diving board, splashing some guests and amusing others.  My friends and I were having a good laugh at this when I spotted my future husband chatting with his friends.  Wilson Cruz.  Yes, that  urlLink Wilson Cruz.   Little gay Ricky from “My So-Called Life” all nice and grown up and brown and muscled and tan and goateed and smiling and gorgeous and 30-years old now and a little queeny and  hot .     A digression:  “A little queeny” is not an insult in my eyes.  I’ve dated guys before whom, let’s say, weren’t the butchest batches in the bunch.  Friends then pull me aside to comment “Doesn’t that bug you?”  They’re usually a little more than surprised to hear me reply “Not in the least.”  Why’s that?  Simple:  I like certain… positions  in the sack, and one of the things I  don’t  like is ever having to hear the phrases “Ouch, not so hard,” or “Pull it out.” A touch of sugar in the sandals is nature’s kind signal to tops that Yes, This One Can Take It and Like It.  Wilson Cruz?  I have no proof, but the man starred in movies titled “Party Monster”, “Joyride” and “All Over Me”.  OKAY?!!?  Back to our tale/tail.  So, Future Husband Wilson is chatting away with a couple of WeHo types (do I really have to explain what those are?  If so, leave a comment and I’ll do it there.  Where do you live?  Edmonton?), and he’s looking PHOINE in a tight squarecut swimsuit, no shirt, hot, ripped smooth bod and little chicken legs (which are cute on him, strangely enough).  We make a little eye contact here and there, but it’s a Mexican standoff, except in this case, it’s more of a Puerto Rican/Irish standoff.  An hour or so passes, another beer or two pass as well, and before I realize it, we’re surrounded by about 200 more gay men and hags.    My friends Rob and Robert (yes, two of them, how cute) sit with me at the prime people-watching seats at a picnic table by the pool, right outside a sliding glass door (locked) that leads into Starlet’s home.  Stuck to the sliding glass door are several Post-It Notes, pieces of paper taped to the door, and other scrawlings that are variations on the same theme:  “Welcome Home, (Starlet’s name), we love you and missed you!”, etc.  I wonder who these people are leaving these notes and how they got past the gate to leave them.  And where exactly has Starlet been for so long that she inspires a mass pilgrimage of people leaving notes on her back door, much like vets leaving smokes and beer for their fallen comrades at the Vietnam Vets’ Memorial?    As we sit, a man in his thirties saunters over to our table, wearing a brown tank top pushed up to become an ersatz belly shirt, complete with khaki shorts and flip flops.  His longish hair is tied up with a rubber band-ish scrunchie of some sort at an asymmetrical point atop of his head, so the hair falls from its banded point like an off-kilter hair geyser, much like Suzanne Sommers used to wear hers in “Three’s Company”.  We later dub this person “Chrissy Snow”.    Chrissy Snow stops at our table, looks down at us seated below and literally  sneers  “Do any of you have a light.”  It’s not a question, but a statement.  Rob gamely replies, “There’s a book of matches in the ashtray here.”  There are seven books of matches sitting in an ashtray on the table, make that SMACK FUCKING DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE, easily in view of everyone, save perhaps Helen Keller.  Chrissy picks up a book, strikes a match, lights his cancer stick and proceeds to look away and toss the matchbook back on our table without looking.  It’s tough to describe accurately, but this was done in such a manner, it was as if he was speaking aloud, “We are done with your ‘matches’.  How dare you not hand them to me in the first place, but we forgive you.  You may have them again.”  I sit and stare at the matchbook thinking, “Nahhhh, you’re overreacting.  That was nothing, big deal, he lit a cig and tossed the matches back, who cares.”  I then slowly look to my left, where Rob is staring at the same matchbook, his mouth agape in shock.  Our eyes meet, and upon realizing this shared experience and feeling, we begin laughing like coked-up hyenas.    You had to be there.  Honest.  Then there was Holy Diver.  I named him Holy Diver after the classic Ronnie James Dio album and song of the same name, a nickname that only I appreciated, since none of my friends had any clue who Ronnie James Dio was, much less that he took over for Black Sabbath after Ozzy bailed.  Holy Diver earned his name because he was determined to prove to everyone at the party that he used to be a Competing Professional Diver.  Each dive into the pool was an intricate, finely choreographed work of art, replete with double axels, tucks, spins and minimal splash.  Holy Diver was fun to watch – at first.  After about a half hour of board hogging acrobatics, he got a little tiring.  A consummate showman, Holy Diver sensed he was losing the crowd, so he upped the ante.  He somehow got onto the roof of the guesthouse adjacent to the pool and began doing even more risky dives right off the shingles.  Strangely enough, this made the crowd ignore him  even more.   We weren’t just sitting at a picnic table the entire time, passing judgment on other partygoers and being snarky.  We did get up and mingle quite a bit, each new group of people introduced to us bringing us inches closer to My So-Called New Husband For Life Wilson Cruz and his posse of A/X Magazine models.  Was I purposely pushing our group closer and closer to his?  Why, fuck yes.  That’s when we ended up talking with Kaballah Ken.  Kaballah Ken was a sweet enough man, funny, well-read and engaging.  That was for about the first ten minutes.  Then, don’t ask me how, because I swear to God if I knew I would have stopped that shit, but we ended up talking about “spirituality”.  I may be a white boy from Cleveland, Ohio, but I’m not naïve.  First thing I did was look at his wrist…and there it was – THE DREADED RED STRING OF KABALLAH.  A cult is a cult is a cult, whether it’s Madonna-inspired Jewish retexturing, Kirstie Alley-Pier One-subsidizing Scientology, or the plain ‘ol Southern Baptist Church.  Johnny don’t play that shit.  When I overhead Kaballah Ken say, “But, the Kaballah is about so much more than simple spirituality,” I interrupted to say, “Excuse me, but I have to piss  really bad. ”  Sweet escape.  When in doubt, bring up the bladder.  I was directed by one of the hosts to a bathroom in the basement of the guesthouse.  The basement had windows that looked out into the swimming pool, so you could play voyeur and watch people doggy paddling underwater. Or more specifically, Holy Diver breaking the water with an elegant splash.  Opposite these windows was a stand-up shower.  Next to the shower was a large hole in the wall, about chest-high and three feet in circumference.  This hole went out about 500 feet to the valley outside, in a straight shot.  At the end of this hole was a paper target.  Yes, it was an indoor shooting range.  In the shower.    Lather.  Rinse.  Fire off a few rounds.  Repeat.  Another hour or so passed with more party conversation, interesting snippets of overheard dialogue (“You look great!”  “Thanks, I haven’t eaten since Tuesday.”), and more longing looks towards Future Husband Wilson, who was now in the pool, talking to some women.  Great…no competition!  Time to make my move.  Now, this story would have a perfect ending if I said I went over to Wilson, devastated him with an intensely witty opening line, got his number, went to dinner, fell in love and he was currently standing over my shoulder proofing this essay.  But true-life stories rarely have those neat, tidy finales.  Sadly enough, this one ends with Rob, Robert and I getting tired, slightly sunburned, and stuck on the 405 for an hour on the way home.  I’m not shy.  Honest.  I normally would have had no problem marching up and introducing myself to this guy, but for some reason, I punked out this time.  So, I missed out.  But hey…I hear he hangs out at  urlLink the Abbey  so all hope is not lost.  Or maybe one of you knows him.  Tell him the scary bald muscle man wants to touch him in bad places.  Or take him to dinner.  His call.

      I have created the perfect rock star...one part power pop, one part classic rock and one part alterna-angst.  We shall call her:   Alanis Van Morrissey   First single?  "You Oughta Know Your Brown-Eyed Girlfriend's In a Coma"  Note:  This joke only sorta works when you pronounce "Van" as van, not "von".   Morrissey slags another world leader.   urlLink  Nothing new   but this actually made the front page of the Drudge Report today, causing Republicans nationwide to stare at their monitors and mutter "Morrissey, who?!?"  Yes, this is me putting off Part Two of the Hollywood Starlet's Pool Party.  Later this week, promise.

      Beautiful synchronicity led me to the International Channel where I saw a quickie documentary on artist  urlLink  Takayuki Mitsushima.   Mitsushima creates his work using nothing but colored sticky tape on white paper, meticulously cutting each strip and shape by hand and placing them on the page to create wonderfully abstract, yet recognizable images with depth and bold color.  Mitsushima has been blind since age ten.  He relies only on his sense of touch and vague, fading memories of what he was able to see in his youth.  Gripping work.   urlLink  This piece   is a favorite of mine...it's titled "When I Kick the Ball".  Mitsushima is currently expanding his work to what he's dubbed  urlLink "Tactile Renga",  a process where his work is scanned into computers, then output in various forms, including thermal embossing.  Inspirational and arresting stuff.

      In the winter of 1990, I found myself in Tongduchon, Korea, a smallish military town about 15 miles south of the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, the long stretch of no-man’s land that separates South Korea from the Communist North.  I had been in the Army for about two years at this point, spending my first 24 months in the relative comfort of Fort Ord, California, home of the 7th Infantry Division (Light).  I had a fun job in the Army – 46R, or Broadcast Journalist.  Yes, it was as cushy as it sounds.  Basically, I was getting mad college money for playing my favorite songs on limited access cable stations on base that nobody listened to.  That all changed with the first Gulf War…you know, the one George Senior screwed up, paving the way for his son’s future similar successes.  You may all remember the first Gulf War as a fun little three-day jaunt in the desert, as our vastly superior military rolled into Kuwait, crushing the Iraqi Army with little to no effort.  This is primarily true.  However, you also must remember the months-long military buildup along the Saudi/Kuwaiti border leading up to that three-day weekend fun.  It was during this buildup that Uncle Sam’s military branches got stretched to their limits, as we had forces in Germany, Japan, the Philippines and Korea, among many others.  The solution was to pull troops out of those countries and replace them with soldiers currently stationed stateside.  Johnny was Korea bound.  The week before I was to arrive in Korea, I went home to Cleveland, Ohio, to spend time with the family.  The morning I was due to leave, I was stung by a bee at the breakfast table (don’t ask, I have no clue).  I was, and still am, allergic to bee stings.  On the 18-hour flight to Seoul, my hand swelled to about twice its normal size and upon landing, I vomited for about 20 minutes, nonstop.  My scheduled 12-month stretch in Korea was off to a rip-roarin’ start.  Korea was strange and familiar.  Strange in the sense that it was a country where the rules of traffic were applied at whim, and familiar in the sense that Korea was in roughly the same climatic area as Ohio, just on the opposite end of the globe.  Therefore, it had weather I was used to – sweltering, humid summers and bitterly cold and snowy winters.  Heaven.  Luckily, my job was still cake.  I was responsible for hosting the afternoon drive on Tongduchon’s Armed Forces Radio affiliate, and for producing three to five weekly “news segments” (rah-rah propaganda) for the network TV headquarters in Seoul.  The radio job was my favorite for a few reasons, primarily that I now had real-life, actual breathing listeners, since we were the only English-speaking radio station, and secondly, I could play whatever the hell I wanted (within decency’s sake, of course).  I promptly began assaulting the Korean airwaves with a bizarre mix of then-hot pop songs from Wilson Phillips, Jesus Jones and the like, peppered with bizarre interludes by  urlLink  EBN-OZN   (they had “Feeling Cavalier” on vinyl!), New Order and Devo (who, strangely enough, were a personal favorite of the station manager, a huge, bodybuilding, Airborne Ranger Staff Sergeant – the last person you’d expect to embrace his inner Spud).  Things were cool, but I was a little homesick and needed some friends.  I think the station manager noticed this, so he decided to take me and the rest of the station staff for a night of “wimmen and drinkin’” in Tongduchon.  Now, if you’re imagining a sleazy, red-light district with filthy streets, dark alleys and sordid bars, you’re absolutely right.  It certainly was.  But, knowing my superior taste in music, SSG Bigarms (not his real name, but close!) smartly took us to the “alternative” bar in Tongduchon…The Dragon Club.  In these pre-Nirvana days, “alternative” was still a loaded word.  It meant something and that something scared a lot of jocks and “straights”.  To them, alternative meant “weird”, “strange”, and, most frighteningly…”gay”.    This was years before “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”.  Back in 1990, the Army was not tolerant.  It was “Don’t Be.”  Period.  The Criminal Investigative Division (CID) was tasked with filtering out undesirable elements from the Army.  This involved recruiting soldiers and training them to mix in with different units, befriending other soldiers in order to get the goods on them, whether it was for drugs, gang affiliation or sucking dick.  You never knew who was CID…we heard story after story of soldiers whose best friends turned out to be CID agents, turned them in and were now serving nice, long jail sentences.  No one was to be trusted.  It was under this oppressive atmosphere that we entered the Dragon Club.    The Dragon Club was a Korean-owned and operated club with a small dance floor, two bars and a crude DJ booth.  The dance floor used to have lights underneath at one point, but years of disrepair had dimmed all of them, some of them even cracked and showing gaping holes, hungry for a twisted ankle.  The DJ was a Korean man named Soon who played very mainstreamish alternative club hits…your Depeche Modes, Erasures, and so on.  Somehow, through the years, the Dragon Club had become the hangout for all the Goths, alterna-freaks and nerdish outcasts who through some strange circumstance found themselves serving in the Army.  SSG Bigarms knew this and brought me there for that very reason.  I felt instantly at home.  Only one problem.  Soon the DJ sucked.  SUCKED.    Songs collided with no rhyme nor reason, often in the middle of verses or choruses.  Since Soon barely spoke English, he had no idea where the songs began or ended, trusting only his eyes on the dark vinyl in the poorly lit booth.  He was also incredibly lazy, forgetting to fade the last song out while the new song began playing.  Looking back, I think he may have been responsible for the very first mash-ups.  Unintentionally, of course.  Something had to be done, and SSG Bigarms was gonna handle it.  He grabbed me by the arm, practically dragging me to see “Mama-san” the owner of the club.    “Mama-san,” he boomed, commanding her immediate attention.  “This is John.  He’s your new DJ.  He works Friday and Saturday nights, for $60 a night.  He brings his own music.  He has lots and lots.  He’s a DJ for AFKN (Armed Forces Korea Network).  He’ll bring you lots of business.  Okay?”  I never saw a Korean woman smile so widely.  I started the next night.   Coming up:  I become the toast of Tongduchon’s alternative set, have sex with a real live woman and get hit on by Sonny Spoon.

       urlLink  Lollipop Thrower Hits David Bowie in Eye    OSLO, Norway (AP) - Halfway through his third song at a Norwegian music festival, an object came flying out of the crowd and hit David Bowie in the eye.  It was a lollipop, probably sent as a message of adoration since Norwegians call the hard candy "love on a stick."  Bowie wasn't seriously injured at Friday's Norwegian Wood Festival in Oslo. He backed off the runway, hunched over, and was assisted by his set crew.  Within moments, he was facing the crowd of 7,500. Swearing at the unknown culprit, Bowie said he only had one good eye. The other eye had been damaged in a childhood fight.   "Lucky you hit the bad one," Bowie said, demanding to know who threw the lollipop. No one standing in the cold and drizzle came forward.  Bowie grumbled about the person or persons responsible hiding in the crowd. Then, regaining his composure and sense of humor, the 57-year-old singer said he was going to punish the audience by making the concert extra-long.

      After 22 months of biting my lip as the President of the company I work for screamed (at me...at his receptionist...at the guy who stocks the vending machines), today was the day he didn't count on.  The day I screamed  back .  I should have known it was going to be a rough day when I barely crawled into the shower this morning.  My father has been pretty ill, having a major stroke a few months ago which has led the way for several minor strokes, each one reducing his time at home and increasing his time in a hospital bed 2,600 miles away from me.  Along with several other comparatively minor annoyances, this was brewing beneath my surface as I pulled into the company's parking lot.  I had been seated at my desk for maybe ten minutes when the Prez came raging out of his office into mine, literally  screaming  "WHY IS THE SALES GUY FROM THE COLORADO DAILY CALLING ME AND NOT YOU?!?"  "Golly," I thought, "fuck if I know, you psychotic little freak."  What I actually said was, "What's the 'Colorado Daily?'"  "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THE COLORADO DAILY IS?  YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COLORADO DAILY IS?  BOULDER'S LARGEST STUDENT NEWSPAPER? BLAH BLAH BLAH, ETC. ETC."  Now, this is normal.  About my second month at this position, I realized the President of this company was mentally...off.  He did not respond well to bad news, and as a result, people tended to hide things from him, which just upset him even more.  I spent four years in the Army and was deployed to several different "conflicts".  I don't hide things, period.  If there's a problem, I tell him.  Which results in his yelling for a while, then calming down and apologizing for it later.  It's a sick, twisted little dance we do often, and luckily, I'm being paid well enough to ignore it most of the time.  Today was not one of those times.  Here I sat, first thing in the morning, being screamed at because a sales person from a newspaper we do not even place ad space in dialed the wrong extension.   FUCK. THAT.  I stood up.  "Stop yelling, NOW, or this will be the final conversation we will ever have!  I'm not in the mood today to be yelled at for meaningless, insignificant shit!" "I'M NOT YELLING!  STOP TAKING THINGS SO PERSONAL!" (Not "personally", and yes, it took all my strength not to correct him.) 'YOU  ARE  YELLING AND I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING YELLED AT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING." "YOU'RE THE ONE YELLING!" "AND HOW DOES IT FEEL?"  By this time, other employees began milling about the hallways, pretending to be en route to get coffee, take a piss, whatever, all in an effort to see who was going to win this childish penis sword fight.  "I DO NOT YELL AT PEOPLE!" he screamed, the irony sailing over his grey head. "You don't?  Well, let's TAKE A POLL!" I yelled back, pointing to the milling crowd outside my office.  Immediately, several sets of eyes looked away and they all dispersed.  Cowards, I muttered to myself.  In the years since he started this company, the President has surrounded himself with a great staff of people who unfortunately have grown to accept this type of behavior in their work environment.  The vast majority do not have degrees and have never worked for anyone else, so they don't realize that not every day has to be filled with the stress of a screaming J. Jonah Jameson clone.  But they all resented it.  And now, all their hopes of peace in the workplace were on my shoulders.  Fine.  If I have to be the one to open this guy's eyes, so be it.   I walked over to my office door and closed it behind him.  I then looked him in the eyes and said what he has needed to hear for the last 22 months.    "You yell because you think no one respects you.  Well, the reason no one respects you is  because  you yell like a four-year old, jumping to conclusions, not giving others the benefit of the doubt, not letting anyone explain their position, just yelling for the sake of hearing your own voice.  If you have to yell at your managers, receptionists, whatever, to get them to produce for you, fine.  But you do NOT yell at me ever again.  Ever.  Or I walk."  It was my calm, Krystal Carrington taking control over Alexis moment.  I sat down, feeling victorious.  The Prez glared at me behind beady, aging eyes and hissed, "You're just upset because YOU'RE.  JUST.  LIKE.  ME."  Ouch.  Now, that...that hurt.  He must have seen the confusion on my face.  "I've heard you on the phone to sales reps and designers.  I've heard how you talk to accounting when they get the billing wrong.  I've heard you and yes, you're just like me.  That's why I like you, John."  Now I'm really upset.  I don't yell at people.  I may not be happy with their performance or with situations, but I never yell.  That's just nasty and unprofessional.  So I know he's full of shit, but it still stung, because a couple of incidents at my old job where I did lose it came surfacing.  Was he right?   Was I just like him?    "I'm not upset with you, John," he continued, calmer now.  "I just didn't understand why this guy was calling me instead of you.  I've had a lot going on this week with the family and I haven't been in the best mood, so I do apologize for taking it out on you."  Family issues.  Bad mood.  Holy crap, I  was  just like him!  No.  No, no, no!  I wanted to scream like Kirk screaming at Khan.  It's trying to bond with me!  Get it off!  GET IT OFF!  Before I knew what I was saying, I began,  "It's okay.  (What the fuck?  No, it's not.)   We're just both having a bad day.   (No, you asshole!  You're like this everyday!)   Let's just try to be a little more civil towards each other, especially in the morning.   (I'm talking to YOU, dickcheese!) "  And then, I said it:  "I apologize, too."  Holy fuck, he's right.  I  am  just like him.

Both Gulf Wars (he was a bit of a news junkie) 7. E-mail 8. The MP3 revolution 9. The vulture-like feeding frenzy on his CD/vinyl collection when his mother opened the vaults a year after his funeral 10. Seeing his girlfriend Leigh’s smile 11. My first kick-ass basement-level apartment in Elyria, Ohio that cost $350/month 12. Alter-House closing down, but being replaced by Smart Bar, which in turn was replaced by the Whiskey 13. My winning on Rock & Roll Jeopardy (he would have SMOKED me) 14. The Chrysler Prowler 15. Ministry getting heavier and harder with each new release 16. Playing Ministry’s “With Sympathy” over and over after each new Ministry release disappointed us 17. Our wanna-be Britpop band “Steer” covering Blur and the Smiths 18. My short-lived residency as the Friday night DJ at the Grid (the mysterious bar next door to the Alter-House we were all curious about) 19. California 20. The fact that life goes on, even if you choose not to.

      I had to run some errands on this lovely partly cloudy day:  •  I stopped first at Fingerprints Records to pick up the new Lloyd Cole CD ("Music In a Foreign Language")...very good, mellow, typical Lloyd, but that's a good thing.  •  Then it was to Rite Aid for saline solution and M3Power blades (They really do work better.  And they vibrate.  Bonus).  •  Finally, it was to Baja Fresh for dinner to go.  At each location, I smiled at the person waiting on me and said "Yes, please" or "Thank you" after each question or transaction.  The only response I got was a "Sure" from the guy at Rite Aid.  No reaction or reciprocal "thanks" from anywhere else.  I've decided this must mean that thanking customers is  so  1987.

      After last night's little excursion and expirement in BWI, I woke up today feeling a little insecure.  I mean, I was probably one of the oldest people at that club last night, I hadn't done cardio in about a week and was feeling a little wrinkly and flabby.  That would explain why I stayed near a wall, sipping my drink all night instead of dancing to Danni Minogue along with everyone else (plus, it's Danni Minogue.  To quote someone more famous and witty than I, "I don't want BLOODY DANNI MINOGUE!").  So, feeling a bit down on myself, I flip on VH1 Classic and there is Romeo Void's "Never Say Never".  Any ounce of insecurity flew out the window once I saw lead singer Deborah Iyall rocking the fuck out.     Here is a woman who didn't fit the stereotypical norm of what a "female rock singer" should look like.  She wasn't white, petite, slutty or trashy, but at the same time, she didn't neuter her sexuality at all, becoming very hot in the process.  She got up there, did her shit hard, left you on the floor, then split before it got old.  That's what each of us should do tonight.  Go out to your favorite bar, club, pub, dive, whatever, and wear what the fuck you want, laugh as loud as you want, talk to who you want, dance how you like and just ROCK.  THE.  FUCK.  OUT.  I know I'm gonna.

      Blogging While Intoxicated.  Apparently, it's the hip thing to do now.  I've read several blogs in the past few days where the writer was blogging drunk (which is scary, since most of these postings were during WEEKDAYS - don't people work anymore?), so I have become inspired to do it myself.  Went to Boy Bar with "E" and "I", had a few Amaretto Sours, stood alone while E talked on his cell and "I" hooked up with some kid.  No one dared approach me and I was even wearing my "friendly" clothes, a polo shirt and nice jeans.  I'm a scurry sort, I suppose.  At 36, I'm used to being the one to always having to make the move.  No worries.  My head hurts, but I'm sure that has a lot to do my disposable contacts that I sleep in instead of taking out each night.   Tonight was the first night I have been to Boy Bar in about six months.  The music did not change ONE BIT.  The same tired songs they play every Friday night, month after month.  Does anyone like Darude "Sandstorm" anymore?  Really?  BWI is boring.  DONE NOW.

      I admit it.  This show gets me every summer.  I give up three hours of my week to spend it with Julie Chen, her bizarre body glitter and Silver Surfer spacesuit wardrobe, and a group of preening narcissists - and I love it.  I AM COMING OUT OF THE BIG BROTHER CLOSET, DO YOU HEAR ME WORLD?  I needed a good two episodes to let this year's group soak in, and now I'm ready to break it on downnnnn:  •  The half-sibling twist was interesting, but ultimately lame.  At first, I thought the Jock Quad was a little insensitive for assuming it was a lie, then I remembered where they all were.  The entire show is a construct, so they were actually smart in being suspicious.  That is the last time I imagine calling this group "smart" for the remainder of the season.  •  What does it mean when all the straight guys are more feminine in appearance than the women?  And what the fuck is up with all those bandanas on the heads?  Does anyone find that appealing?  •  You are Head of Household.  Big Brother reveals to you an LCD screen in your room capable of showing you what all the other roomates in the house are up to.  Do you spy on the others in secret, finding out their true agendas and give yourself an edge in the game, or do you IMMEDIATELY GRAB PEOPLE YOU'VE KNOWN FOR TWO DAYS AND TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT?  That douche DESERVES to lose.  •  Anyone see Scott's nude pics from the April 2004 issue of "Playgirl" yet?  Seriously.  All I can say is, "Pencil Dick Syndrome" is a real disease.  Please give.  •  I keep waiting for Nikomas to call upon the Dark Lord to aid her in vanquishing her foes.    •  The houseguests need to read that fine print on Drew's forehead very carefully:  "Object may be smarter than it appears."  Look for him or his twin to betray the Jock Quad.  •  Adria & Diane.  Who?  Exactly.  Beware the faceless ones.  They sneak up on you.  •  Marvin may last a long time under that old "No one likes him, so I'm taking him to the end" strategy that always backfires.  •  Wil.  Will, Will, Will.  Sigh.  Hun, NO one is fooled.  When you reveal your big "I'm gay!" shocker, don't be surprised when everyone in the house says, "Well, DUH."  Me and my friends have been running around saying, "I'm gonna give them a dose of MY medicine!" all week.  Snap!  At least he's still butcher than Bunky.  •  I LOVE HOLLY.  LOVE HER.  That's all I'm sayin'.    •  If I was in the house this year?  I would have told everyone I was gay and liberal, blah blah, then started a secret alliance with Mike, the GW Bush booster.  No one would suspect a thing.  Unfortunately, I wasn't there this year, so he's out next week.  Unless the house pulls a Nikomas revolt and sends her away from her newfound sibling.  But I doubt it.  •  My pick to win?  Either Drew or Lori.  Both normal and likeable enough to not be threats, but smart enough to coast until the end.

      Thanks for all the IMs and e-mails folks, but I  urlLink know.   This is usually the part where I come up with a bunch of bad "heart" puns made from Bowie lyrics, but I can't do it.  This is BOWIE.  Let's get all stupid and hippy dippy and send some positive energy towards our Thin White Duke.  The wrong people are hurting.  Check out the Drudge Report today and you'll see what I mean.  Self-loathing much, Matt?  Someone out him already.

       Strange Johnny Convergence Moment - #52 in a series   As an impossibly aggressive junior high school geek, I was obsessed with British sci-fi phenom Doctor Who, specifically the Tom Baker version, the  urlLink "fourth Doctor" , known for his wild curls, huge, toothy grin and long, flowing scarf (no comments).  I watched the show religiously (thanks WVIZ-TV!), read the paperback novelizations, collected the short lived Marvel Comic (when that issue of Marvel Premiere featuring Doctor Who hit the newsstand at Lawson's Dairy and Deli, I swear all of Grafton, Ohio must have heard my squeal of glee), and even had my mother buy a long scarf and floppy hat so I could play Doctor Who out in our huge, wooded backyard with my little sister Jennifer standing in for Sarah Jane Smith.    I even built my own  urlLink K-9 unit  out of wood, discarded TV antennae and silver spraypaint, impressing my step-father who had never seen me take any interest in woodshop projects before (or since).  Soon, I grew out of this obsession after being exposed to MTV in 1983, seeing Duran Duran, the Cure, Echo & The Bunnymen and later, the Smiths.  Later, I discovered we got Doctor Who episodes years after they had aired in the UK, and Tom Baker had been replaced.  All things Doctor Who passed away.  Flash forward to 2002 and I'm living in San Diego.  One night, I'm eating at Ono Sushi in Hillcrest with a friend and I spot someone I recognized as a great character actor from several movies, including one I adored, "L.A. Story" with Steve Martin -- I just couldn't place the name with the face.  It was killing me.  British Character Actor Guy was eating with a male friend of his, laughing, talking and looking totally approachable.  But what to say?  "Hey there....GUY.  I loved you in that movie you did!  Ummm...wassernameagain?"  Naw, I decided, let the poor guy suck on his raw fish in peace.  A year later, I'm surfing the web at work and stumble across a news story that a "new Doctor Who has been chosen".  A familiar smile of nostalgia crosses my lips and I click the link to see who got the job.   urlLink Richard E. Grant.   British Character Actor Guy.  Crap!  My chance to meet Doctor Who and I passed!  Inside me, the geek from Grafton, Ohio who weighed 120 pounds soaking wet was beating the holy fuck out of my 170 pound 2003 version.    Of course, Grant was only the Doctor for one "internet only" animated version.  This year, the BBC announced a new series of Doctor Who episodes will begin in 2005, with "Queer As Folk" creator Russell T. Davies serving as Executive Producer and general creative force.  The new Doctor will be played by Christopher Eccleston, a regular on UK television.  If I see him at Ono Sushi, I'm buying his meal.  Promise.   Note:  Yeah, I know I've been slacking lately and this post is more or less a stop-gap, but work has finally slowed a bit, so I'll be updating a little more often.  Thanks for your indulgence.

       Dinosaurs - from the Kids in the Hall Season One DVD box set:   I think that Ernest Hemingway was speaking for all gay men everywhere when he said that "a man is nothing without a harpoon and a bar that he can call home."  Now I've never been satisfied with just one harpoon, so I certainly don't see why I should be satisfied with just one bar.  But lately, there have been some ominous developments in the gay bar community that I would like to share with you.   Just last week I was at Bloomie's, having a smart cocktail at the bar, talking to my friend Tom -- you know Tom, Tom the bartender -- and all of a sudden, a Tyrannosaurus Rex walked in. I couldn't believe it.   What a bore.   Drank like a fish, totally took over the dance floor, and killed thirty or forty fags with that stupid tail of is.  I was incensed.  I mean, really, isn't there some sort of dress code or door policy?  'Course I could see how he got in, with those faggy little hands of his, mincing around the dance floor -- like some queen of the place to see.   Oh, they're just like leather men. Oh, sure they'll drive you home on the back of their motorcycle. Vroom, vroom. But once you're in the door, it's off with the jacket and up with the heels.  It's happening everywhere. Just last week I was at Cafe Boy on the roof top patio.  Some  of us were enjoying a lovely brunch when all of a sudden the pterodactyl swooped in and ruined all our fun. Up-ended the table, made fun of Sky's new play and bit off Jule's head.   Oh, nobody helped us - oh no - they were all too caught up in themselves. So I marched straight downstairs to talk to Tom -- you know my friend Tom, Tom the owner -- and I said, "Tom, are you aware of the situation developing upstairs in the patio?"  He said, "if you mean the pterodactyl ruining everybody's fun, yes, but there's nothing I can do. He has a sweet tooth."  Well, there's something I can do, I'm not going back.   And it's even happening at Daddy's.  I was there last week when the gorgasaurus arrived with her lipsyncing troupe of monitor lizards and bit off Jule's hand.  He'll never play piano like he used to.  And if I hadn't been passed out in the forest swimming in my own vomit, I'd have said something!   A T-REX IN A LEATHER JACKET AND MOTORCYCLING CAP ENTERS, CRUISES BUDDY IN AN OBVIOUS MANNER   Get extinct!

       Disclaimer Du Jour:   If you’re used to the fast, funny, witty Johnny posts of the past few weeks, today’s post may be a bit of a shock.  Hey, the blog description does read “alternatively funny & grumpy,” so there you go.  The following was written a few weeks ago in a depressed furor as I was assaulted by a particularly vicious combination of my father’s second stroke, very difficult times at work and a general mood of loneliness.  I wrote it, re-read it, decided it was far too whiny to be truly representative of how I really am, and promptly filed it away.  But after a few weeks, I looked at it again and realized that sometimes compelling writing comes from life’s rougher situations.  So, here it is, warts and all.  Just know that I’m much better now, thanks.    Italicized portions are from the song “California” by Wax    Cleveland, November, 1999    i’m gonna move to Southern California got me a ride  and a reason to ignore you got me a radio ain’t got no speakers ain’t much use so I’m leaving it leaving it for you I’m leaving it for you  could be bye for you   Through what seems like a combination of maddening determination, dumb luck and sheer force of will, I actually got a job in San Diego, California.  And not just any job – the veritable dream job with a hugely successful corporation, doing what I’ve set my career goals toward…writing.  Not only am I now a college graduate, I’m going to be a working writer in San Di-fucking-ego, California.  I’m going to buy a condo and get a boxer puppy and name him Kirby, after my favorite comic book artist, Jack Kirby, creator of Captain America.    I can’t believe this is happening.   San Diego, September, 2002    gotta find a room and I’m running out of money staying out late but i gotta get up early   The dream job has become a more realistic pain in the ass, full of “workers” who use their husbands/kids as excuses to leave hours early, foisting their work and responsibilities upon all the single people.  The pay is good, but not good enough.  Living in Hillcrest, the gay mecca of San Diego, is not all it’s cracked up to be, as it’s becoming overrun with increasingly more hostile bums on the streets, open-mouthed gaping straight couples who have no idea they’ve moved into the “gay” part of town and ever-spiraling rent and property values, making it impossible to own a piece of the American dream.  My building does not allow cats, much less a boxer.   Orange County, January 2003     why did i move to Southern California? smog isn't blue someone shoulda warned you they shoulda warned you  could be bye bye could be bye for you   The new dream job has turned into a real nightmare.  This cliché is all it deserves, since it has drained me of any and all creative spark.  I left a somewhat creatively fulfilling job in San Diego to take the money and run, moving up to Orange County to work for a music-related company that promised me complete creative control, incredible opportunity and truckloads of cash.    What I got was micro-managed by the President to a laughable degree (“Don’t use ampersands instead of the word ‘and’ in headlines!”), limited growth potential (Actual quote:  “Don’t make us  too  successful, because then our parent company will notice.”) and yes, truckloads of cash.  It’s not worth it.  Orange County is an ugly, ugly place, built and based upon a foundation of commerce.  Strip malls litter the landscape, arching up from the flat, featureless ground like junkyard scrap heaps hungering for debit cards.  The gay community is virtually split in half, with one group living in Laguna Beach, a pretentious land of BMW-leasing, credit-abusing Pseudo Haves, and the other Have Nots barely subsisting, working one or more minimum-wage retail jobs, with no future goals save having enough cover charge and drinking money for the weekend.  The highways are clogged with SUVs, each one filled with drivers possessed of a false sense of entitlement that dictates they must be in front of you, no matter what crawling “speed” the flow of traffic is moving, or how aggressively they must cut in front of you (never with a signal or courtesy wave).  This continues into the grocery stores, restaurants, Starbucks, anywhere people are packed in, waiting their turn, letting more moments of life slip away meaninglessly.    I’m living in the biggest apartment I’ve ever lived in, paying the highest rent I’ve ever paid, with money to spare.  I’m still not permitted to have a boxer.   Long Beach, June 2004    why did i move?  	(Southern California] why did i move?  	(Southern California, Southern California) why did i move?  	(Southern California, Southern California  	Southern California, Southern California)    LB is light years ahead of OC in mellowness, relaxation and gay presence.  The roads are calmer, the people have manners and the rents are cheaper.  Work is changing, as we’re merging with a larger company located closer to LB, so my commute will be reduced dramatically (I currently spend a total of 90 minutes a day on the 405).  I’ve caught up quite a bit on bills, even completely paying off a number of outstanding credit lines.  If things continue, I’ll finally be able to buy my own place by December.  And get a boxer named Kirby.  In California.  Okay, California…you win.

       OUR HERO IS SPRAWLED ON HIS SOFA, HEAD RESTING ON PILLOWS, HAND AND FOREARM LAID DRAMATICALLY ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD   I am heartbroken.  I am saddened.  I am forlorn.  But I am closer to being debt-free and buying a house.  I have sold more than 400 CDs and DVDs to  urlLink SecondSpin.com .  Once I decided to bite the bullet and actually DO it, it came quite easily.  First, some background.  Between my insatiable lust for new music and several DJ and radio-related jobs over the years, I have amassed more than 2,500 CDs, mostly alternative and dance-oriented rock from the birth of the medium circa 1985 to the present day.  Many of these are rare, long out-of-print titles I would never part with.  Or so I thought.    I decided that at age thirty-mumble that it was time to become a real adult, get out of debt, COMPLETELY, and buy a house.  Doing this called for sacrifice.  True sacrifice.  Lo, I was not a child no mo', so them damn childish thangs should be put the fuck away.  That meant selling comic books, various collectibles and...yes...CDs.  Most of the comics and collectibles were easy to part with.  My truly impressive collection of silver age Marvels bit the dust way back in 1995 when I bought my first brand new vehicle, a 1995 Ford Ranger XLT in Sapphire Blue.  A Sapphire Blue that everyone insisted on calling my "purple truck", no matter how much I protested that it wasn't purple, but FUCKING SAPPHIRE BLUE.  The "Grape" was Ford's purple.  But no one was biting.  Oh, well.  The comics paid for the truck, pretty much.  Sweet.  But the CDs...the CDs...they were a different story.  I could tell you the track listing of just about each one, in order, where I bought it, when, who produced it, a litany of Rain Man-esque ramblings of each one.  Parting with these would be like chipping away at my soul...my SOUL, I TELL YOU!    There had to be some ground rules.  I couldn't just grab titles at random and fling them into boxes, never to be seen again.  So I came up with some parameters, and looking back, I think I made the right choices.  So, here for your benefit, are Johnny's Rules for Selling Your CD and DVD Collection for Cash.  1.  No trade.  Trade is for cunts.  You are selling these for CASH.  Trade only results in new titles to clutter your life and you lose in sheer numbers.  2.  Anything you have not played in the last five years is gone.  No debate.  No "well, I may want to listen to it sometime in the future" bullshit.  Five Years or GONE.  That means farewell Ned's Atomic Dustbin's catalog (they had FOUR fucking albums?!?  Sweet Chocolately Jesus.)  Goodbye, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult's "Sexplosion" (thank God I still listen to "A Daisy Chain for Satan".  Thanks, God!).  Sayonora, EMF's "Stigma" (their superior second album after the one with "Unbelieveable"...of course, "superior" for EMF still means "shit" compared to just about anything else).  Five Years or GONE.  3.  Put your Five Years or GONE selections in a box.  Close the box.  Do not open this box ever again.  FOR ANYTHING.  4.  Go back to your collection and stare your favorite artists' catalog down, hard.  Gaze deeply at their entire output.  Begin with ABBA -- no, wait, everything they've ever done is fucking brilliant, skip them.  Those you keep.  Begin with ABC.  "Lexicon of Love"?  Keep.  "Beauty Stab"?  Lost classic, keep.  "How to be a Zillionaire"?  Need you ask?  KEEP.  "Alphabet City"?  Toss.  "Up"?  Toss.  You get the idea.  Be cruel, be heartless.  Even your heroes fuck up.  Make them pay the ultimate price for hurting you when they do.  5.  David Bowie is not subject to rule number 4.  Bowie's fuck-ups are other's masterpieces.   6.  Morrissey and the Smiths are not subject to rule 4, either.  7.  Oh wait, except for "Rank".  Yeah, toss that.  8.  Tape the boxes shut.  They are now Pandora's Boxes, filled with ill-chosen memories, lost years and dusty mistakes.  View them not again, lest you place yourself in peril.  9.  DVDs and VHS are a breeze.  Do they feature naked guys having sex?  No?  Then toss 'em.  Except for "Showgirls".  10.  Take the boxes to your local used media store that PAYS CASH (trade is for cunts, remember), or ship 'em to  urlLink SecondSpin.com .  11.  Lie on couch with arm draped dramatically over forehead.  Moan a bit.  Write in blog about experience.

      •  "Napoleon Dynamite" - very good, tender, funny, reminds me of growing up in rural Grafton, Ohio.  Stellar performance from the star who talks like every kid in high school, with that instantly familiar candence of defiant confusion.  Plus, Alphaville is on the soundtrack and there are two hot cholos.  HOT cholos.    •  "Showgirls" Limited Edition VIP DVD box set - came out today, grabbed mine during lunch.  Comes with two shotglasses, lame party games, including a "Pin the Pasties on Nomi" game (seriously), and an expanded DVD with hilarious commentary from some catty queen.    I know it's probably a lame cliche to sit back and abuse this movie, but dear lord, it's just staring back at you defiantly ASKING for it like some Brazilian porn actress in a "Buttman" film.  If you've never seen this movie, I hate you.  Quit reading my blog.    Not really.    But see it, with me for maximum effect and enjoyment.  I'll point out how the overarcing manicure subplot is actually an allegory for class structures and power among females and how Agent Cooper's hair is the real reason this movie tanked.  Plus, boobies.    •  "My Obssession" by Icehouse - Ira Davies does his best late-Roxy Music approximation on this, the ill-fated third single from the U.S. breakthru album "Man of Colours" (oooh, foreign-y spelling!).    This was the follow-up to the more successful follow-up ("Electric Blue") to a lesser, but still successful hit single ("Crazy") but this one flopped, so of course, I loved it.  No one else did.  Out of print on CD, but I have one, so nyah.

      Before I forget, I need to remind everyone that I've been coaxed out of retirement for a one-off event this Saturday, August 7th at Pistons in Long Beach.  I'll be spinning rock and alternative with some '80s alternative thrown in for good measure, so it should be a nice sorbet to cleanse the faggoty musical pallette usually overpowered by house and trance.  I was going to post a link to the Pistons website for directions, etc., but it's so horrendous and outdated, I wouldn't feel right embarrassing them.  So click  urlLink here  for more info, except for directions.  No one feels like posting directions.  For the record, Pistons is in North Long Beach, right off the 91 freeway at the Cherry Ave. exit on Artesia.  For Mapquesting purposes, the street address is 2020 E. Artesia.  If you've never been to Pistons and are a little scurred, don't be.  Sure, it's a "bear" bar, you'll hear plenty of "woofs" (see index), but everyone is incredibly friendly, the crowd gets very mixed during big events like this, the drinks are cheap and the music will be fucking stellar.  Trust.    I like how the flyers (with the exception of the one posted at the website above) refer to me as "Interactive 'DJ' John Hughes".  I'm not quite sure why there are quotes around "DJ", but hey, I like making the little air quotes when I say it.  As far as the interactive part, it's either because the event people are setting up electronic drums around the club so you can bang along to the music (with the drums, silly), or because I have a habit of "interacting" with tasty brown boys who come up to the "DJ" to say "HELLO, CAN YOU PLEASE PLAY THALIA?"  Show up on Saturday, come up to the stage and say "Blogger" and I'll buy your first drink.
