      Maybe this world is another planet's hell. -Aldous Huxley  If you must focus upon detriments of your life, focus upon the ones that you are willing to improve. It is then when you are fulfilling a purpose, rather than just talking about one.

      "There is no pain so great as the memory of joy in present grief." Aeschylus  This is pretty self explanatory. It's hitting close to heart these days, and I thought it to be appropriate.

      " Relationships, of all kinds, Are like sand held in your hand. Held loosely, with an open hand, The sand remains where it is. The minute you close your hand And squeeze tightly to hold on, The sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold on to some of it, But most will be spilled."  This truly hits heart, not because I feel just a sense of comprehension, but instead because I feel such a strong sense of relation. This has indeed happened to me so many times in the past, you think I would have learned by now, but I guess that is not how things work with me. The moment I feel as if I can consider someone as a good friend, I grab ahold of whatever I thought I had, in all hopes of capturing the joy of being able to share my life with another person rather than keeping it locked up inside myself like I have always done. But what are you supposed to do? Put all fear at hold for fear of running this newfound aquaintance off? Or, be the person that you are, and show this new aquaintance how you truly are on the inside? Because then aren't you showing the person the "real you," and isn't that the preferrable of the two because you'll be gaining a friend that accepts you for who you really are?

      I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become reality. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.‚Äù      -Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 1929-1968  Although the concept of world peace is so strong, and the possibility of never having to fear for one's life is so completely forthcoming, I do not believe that "the bright daybreak of peace" is something that can honestly be anticipated. Perhaps it is a flaw in my remembrance of the Bible itself, but didn't God witness conflictions, even with one solid language and set of beliefs, and react by creating numerous dialects? And perhaps it is the realist within myself that acknowledges the fact that since then, there has never been any situation that has even hinted to a possibility of a worldwide state of peace.

      Do not stand at my grave and weep I am not there, I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow I am the diamond glint on snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain I am the gentle autumn rain. When you wake in the morning hush I am the swift uplifting rush Of quiet birds in circling flight I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry I am not there, I did not die.      -Mary Frye  The sight of these words make me long for my Grandmother even more. Even though the poem itself suggests that she is not dead, but instead in everything around me, I cannot stand the thought that she is so close, but yet so far away from my very grasp.

      From 6:30-1:30 I worked at Hardee's today. It was so stressful to the point where I was on the very brink of shedding tears. The female employees there are deliberately making it hard for me to do my job, not to mention the fact that I'd never touched those breakfast buttons in my entire life! But, on the brighter side of things, I got paid today. I worked 44 hours in the past 2 weeks, and definitely got paid for it. It's really nice! Tomorrow I work from 12-4:30, but fortunately I'm working with Kenny. He's so nice to me, and sure makes the time go by faster.  Mom and Dad are going out tonight and I am so completely enthralled; we're all watching Lord of the Rings and vegging out. So nice! I also think I'm going to surf the web for a bit, and continue my college search. I know I want to attend a small campus, but then again want it to be by a larger city, so I could be subject to a wider array of diversity, and things to do as well. But, I need financial assistance, and that alone scares me; small colleges are expensive! But I'm sure it all will work out, because I'm a firm believer of "everything happens for a reason." God will be watching, so it'll be cool.   Oh, and last but not least, my tennis record ils 4-3! Not bad, as long as I've won as many matches as I've lost, I'd consider myself in the green.

      Tonight was the football game, and I am really ready to pull out my own hair. To the point of going bald, probably, if I could do it painlessly.   Aaron is all over Jessie! Heather wasn't at the game, so I had to sit with my fellow saxophonists and I was ready to cry I was so upset. No one would talk to me past 2nd quarter, and I'm really really frustrated! WHY? That's all I want to know, because believe me, if I knew I would fix it. I'm really tired of always getting left out of everything by everyone.  Marie's obsessed with John and wants to hook back up. John doesn't. They both tell me what they really think, but I'm too afraid to tell the other, but know I should to save each from humiliation. But I don't have the heart to break anyone's hopes!  Me, well, things for me have just been peachy. I absolutely love the fact that I have friends who really care about me, who will stop talking about themselves for one freaking moment and ask me how my day went, or how am I today.

      All of my friends are mad at me and I don't know why! Heather has been biting my head off this week over any little thing that she doesn't like, and Marie, well she won't even talk to me. Why? Because I told her I didn't want to spend every waking minute of my day discussing her recently ended "love life" with John Green. HE broke up with HER. That's that.    Things are weird in school. All of the boys are bored because Danielle's taken (Alex's little brother, just a heads up), and she is not floating around anymore. Well, at least not as much as she used to. Aaron, well I do feel bad for the poor boy. But, hey, now he knows how that feels. The Melaro's are in stage band with me, and now I have someone to talk to. My classes are pretty cool this year: I am taking VHS too! Um...I'm getting treated differently because I am a varsity tennis player. Today MRS WILLIAMS of all people started to talk to me. And nicely, at that!   Oh, and at Marie's party last weekend, she dared Robbie to kiss me, and he did. I didn't even know he was coming until he was there, to tell you the truth. So today at the tennis match, he was talking to my sister and some of her friends, and was all like "I was thinking about taking Jennica to prom." Yeah right. I would be afraid, number one. I would give him the wrong idea, number two. And number three, no freaking way. He plans on TAKING me? Why not first plan on ASKING me?

      Tomorrow is the first day of my junior year of high school! I'm excited; this is my chance to change. I want to care more about how I look (okay- that sounds too weird- I just want to look nice), make new friends, possibly get a boyfriend, and just have a lot of fun. People always seem to have gotten the wrong impression of me, and I want my "image" to change. I want to be seen as loud, individual, fun to be around, but also at the same time intelligent and caring of others. I know I'm already seen as that by my close circle of friends, but that's just it-- only a few know the real me. Others see me differently. Way differently.   We're playing Geneva tonight at their courts. I don't want to play them! My record thus far this year is a measly 2-2. I don't want a 2-3, because that would just be too pathetic. I know I don't deserve to be third singles. Yes, I worked hard, but Deirda or Catherine could easily beat me, and they are only playing first doubles...the spot I should really be playing. But oh well, I'm here and I am working my best at it, hopefully so the Bragga's can think that it was a good move on their behalf to put me there in the first place.

      Today at work was relatively fun, for once! Kenny was working, and he's always a riot. I drew him a cow, he taped it to an unmentionable spot on the front of his pants and started grinding the freezer. Ahh! Needless to say, the time went by fast...  Marie had a party lastnight. Greg, Ricky, Justin, Robbie, Jesse, Jessica, Ali, and Tyler came. It was pretty fun actually. I love hanging around medium sized groups. Not too small, but not too big. It was comfortable. I took a whole roll of film between Friday night at the football game, and lastnight. Now I just need some money to develop them.

      Things are so screwed up. I don't even know what to do about anything. It's like my brain is telling me to do one thing, and my heart is telling me another. And this "confliction," is really messing me up. Why do people think I have no feelings?  I am one of the most emotional people I know, and I know that for sure, yet so many mistake me for someone else. I'm uptight. I'm scared of my life and the people in it. I am easily hurt by the actions of others. I am caring to all others, and I expect that of everyone I know. But I don't get it more often than not, and that hurts.     I lost my Edgewood match but played extremely well, and put up a good fight. Today was a match vs. Mentor, and I beat the girl, 4-6, 6-0, 6-2. It was bad, I played bad. I need to figure how to play *my* game, and not play good against the good people, and bad against the bad people. It's weird.  "Meet the Teams," is tomorrow night. It's going to be fun, well at least I hope. Aaron's not going to be there, and that's not too good. He is the one person in my squad that know's what he is doing. He and I are cool now. I know in the spring it was touch and go there for a while because he practically left me in the dust for Danielle. ( And what a wise move that was, too.) I have a lot of fun at band these days, and that's good. Because I haven't had too much fun lately other than that.

      Today Marie called and said that "her relationship," as screwed up as it is right now, is "all better now." Why? Because she apologized to him for being mad that he spent more time with his ex. Oh God forbid he apologize for screwing her over for another woman.  HUGE mistake, enough said.   I am just about ready to go pick up my paycheck from Hardee's. It'll probably be around $100, and that's cool with me. I really need to put together a birthday present for Heather because her 17th is tomorrow, and to do that I need money. Talk about waiting until the last minute, especially for a best friend. Shh.... she'll never know.   Tonight is the game, well, at 4:00 to be precise. I'm really scared to tell you the truth. Not only is the fact that I am playing a singles match against an Edgewood girl highly intimidating, but I guess a lot of people are coming to watch. I don't want a blue million people coming to watch me lose! (Talk about being negative, Jennica.)

      Ooh, Marie and John are.....well *reow* lately; John's been spending more time with his exgirlfriend, and denying it. I don't know what to tell Marie....how am I supposed to know what's best for her? I hate giving advice. It's like "Tell me advice or I'll hate you." That or "Tell me advice, it'll be wrong, and I'll hate you anyways." It's a lose lose situation.   Hardee's is disgusting. There are too many ego-hungry girls there. Gary, the GM, is a dick. But hey, Kenny, the hot 18 year old drive through guy is funny. A "friend" came in today! Kenny said that he only saw him in there once before today, but has a feeling that he'll be in a lot from now on, and I am in agreeance. It's scary. I'll just have to be the "fry girl" whenever he walks in. Haha.    Tomorrow is our first tennis match! I MADE THIRD SINGLES!!!!!!! Wish me luck.

      Lately things have been...well, interesting. Heather and I are as distant as ever. I wonder, is that bad? Which is better: a friend who you are close and intimate with, or a friend that you simply kick back and enjoy life with? Marie and I are cool actually however. We're getting closer I suppose. Her and her boyfriend, John, are pretty good together. I wouldn't know from experience, but hey, somethings you don't need experience to make a decision.   I've been having a lot of fun with Aaron and Jessica in our saxophone squad for marching band. I find myself laughing all too often at the small insignificant things, but I'm ahead for doing so. Because it's better to laugh at everything than to laugh at nothing. That's for sure.

      There's got to be more to life than waking up, going to work or any other required activity that is planned for that day, and coming home. And then most of my home time being spent miserably loathing my life, or being used as an "example" by my parents to demonstrate their lack of normal parenting skills. Is there something wrong with that scenario, or is it just me?

      I started at Hardee's today. I'm really excited about the money, but what teenage girl wouldn't be excited at the prospect of pocket cash to spend?   Tennis was crazy this morning. I challenged Allison yesterday and today and beat her both times 6-4, 6-4. I truly hope that I can earn the vveerrry prestigious spot of first doubles. :-) Next year I'm going to be second singles! Yay!  Oh, and Suzanne said I looked skinner and asked if I was losing weight.  That's always a nice thing to hear.

      Argh... things are kind of weird now.  I just think that there is just so much stuff going on, I'm getting sucked into the oblivion of "scheduling" and "time management." Well, I'm gaining some valuable life lessons, and that's about all I can say.  Mommy and Daddy should be proud... "Our little girl is growing up." Whatever. Growing up is disgusting. :-)  Tennis NEC's were last Saturday! Yay! They were great. I lost to Edgewood's Andrea Essig, obviously, but I did play the best ever on her. I did score like 4 points, and I was quite satisfied. My consolation match, well, that was easy enough. I won 8-0. Then, my true feat of the day, I beat the Lakeside girl 8-2! Last time I played her, she and I were tied all the way through, and I was intimidated.   Marie has got that "I've got Jessi, I don't need you attitude lately," and I hate it, but there's nothing I can do. Heather and I are the same, kind of in some kind of screwed up limbo land where nothing is wrong and everything is amusing. Well, I guess its better than arguing with her, and wondering why she's my friend. I've also made a lot of little acquaintences in most of my classes, and thats great. In my mind at least. Friends make class time fly by!  I've got an AP test tomorrow, and I'm supposed to be studying now (notice the key word there: supposed). I've got a pretty good chunk down, but a lot to go. But I needed a break! (And the other part of me contradicts: Yeah right, Jennica, you just don't want to do it)

      Wade called lastnight... finally. Heather gave him my number last THURSDAY and yesterday was TUESDAY! What's up with boys and the whole " I'll call you thing," and they wait forever. Ahh! The frustration!  I got my paycheck yesterday, and although I am requiring myself to save half of it for a car (if I ever get past being lethargic and actually go get my permit), I have like $80 for homecoming.   I iced my wrist all weekend, and I thought that it would be somewhat healed by now, but I guess I thought wrong. My forehands suck, and if I get 4th at NECs on Saturday, I think that would just be too bad. I have expectations for myself, and I worked too hard this season to let it slip out of my grasp!  But yeah, other than that things are good. I'm making a lot of new friends, and I have so much fun at school these days!

      I really should be studying for AP History right now, but I don't really feel like it. I hate that class, I know I should drop it, but I won't because Dr. Patterson would be disapointed in me. I am honestly not too worried about the big test, but rather passing the class. That's my priority.   Edgewood Band Night is tonight in Ashtabula. Joy. I honestly hope it is somewhat fun. I am really tired of band not being fun. It's aggravating, everything has been really aggravating recently, but I guess that is a big part of being a teenage girl, I guess, now isn't it? I guess everything is so hard to swallow, especially when it is all going on at once.

      So many freaking things are going on right now, and I don't even know what to do. Marie is really being horrible towards me recently, and I know its because she knows she can get away with it and still have me there for her when she's down. Today I said something about Aaron and Jessie, and she said "Well maybe it's weird, but probably because you're jealous of her because she got something you wanted but could never have." Me, being the better of the two, left the lunchtable, and went to sit in the lobby by myself.  Heather and Jen are talking, and I read an email. I knew Jen would lose it in college, and she did. No specifics, because I really don't feel comfortable with putting them on the net, but I am really worried for that girl. She used to be a sweet little 4.0 girl, but now she's horrible, and I'm glad I don't have anything to do with her.  But what really irks me is that Heather told me before that the only reason Jen is acting like that is because Heather was a bad influence on her. Well, if that is completely so, then this is Heather's fault, and Heather is one of my best friends!!!! How could this happen?!!?  I'm really iffy about homecoming. I was excited when Wade asked me, yes, but now I realize that he probably asked me because that was the closest he could get to her. I feel horrible, probably because I don't know the boy very well, and am entirely too shy to do much about it. I know Heather gave him my number, but if he doesn't call, then it's just going to be pretty bad. I feel bad. If he is going to pay for everything...I'm going to feel pretty darn bad, but no one will know because I'm not going to open my mouth and ruin everything for myself. I'll just smile and pretend I don't think about anything. Argh!! I feel like screaming.  Today in tennis I screwed up my right wrist even more than it has been screwed up. I couldn't even hit anymore, and had to sit out the rest of practice with ice. But, the good thing about that was that I got to talk to Ricky and Tyus, both of whom have been incredibly nice and polite towards me lately, and it really makes me feel good. Like I've got some good friends. You know?  Jessie thinks that I hate her, but really it isn't her. Nor is it Aaron, directly at least. It's just that I would expected a lot more out of him, but I guess he's hormonal and now the typical boy. Funny thing is, I really liked him before because he wasn't like everyone else, and now he is. But anyways, she thinks I'm mad at her because what,  she stole Aaron away from me?? Oh my goodness! Things are so wrong!

      Wade asked me to homecoming! Yay! I'm really excited, but I'm afraid I am going to be a    bad date! He's really cute and nice, so I know I'll have fun. Heather said she'd  give him my number and tell him to call me. Ah, the wonders of being an old fashioned girl.  I ain't callin' NOBODY!  Marie is upset right now because she doesn't know what to do with herself no that she has no boy. I don't know what to do, she thinks Ricky and I have some sort of secret fling going on. Argh. Then Ben is all depressed and contemplating suicide, but then casually throwing in that if we went out to go see a movie, he'd be cool. I'm not stupid!   I helped Aaron ask Jessie to homecoming. It was hard. But hey, I guess friends have to do what they have to do. I tried to handle this maturely, and I guess it worked. Joy.

      The football game was really a lot of fun lastnight. For once, Aaron wasn't being a dick, and I actually enjoyed sitting next to him. Heather, Marie, and I all got along beautifully on the bus, and we were making homecoming plans! I THINK I HAVE A DATE! Heather called a boy today, and asked him if he knew anyone I could go with, and he said no, commenting that he didn't want me to go with any of his friends because he thought I was better than that. So Heather suggested that he take me, so he said he would, and that he'd ask me! Heather is going to go with Joe if she can, and now we need to find Marie a date. Homecoming is going to be a lot of fun this year!

      Things with Greg are really weird. I'm not going to play stupid, and pretend that I don't know what's going on, because I do. And I guess I can comprehend why he is acting the way he is. But I don't *understand*. I am just a girl, and no one needs to worry about me.  Marie keeps telling me not to worry about these little things, but I do. I worry about a lot, but I have reason to. Things always get spoiled, so I take extra precaution these days. Who can blame me for wanting to keep what I've got?

      I NEED A DATE TO HOMECOMING! There are a few people that I would go with if they asked me, but I know it's not going to happen, so why get my hopes up? Alex says he'll try to warm Aaron up to the idea of taking me. I just wish people would mind their own business. If someone is going to ask, I'd rather they do it because they want to, and not just because they want everyone to stop harassing them. Why do others insist on meddling in my life? It's MINE!  I'm going to start volunteering for the junior high girls tennis team starting tomorrow. I really need volunteer hours, plus I think this is the perfect opportunity for me to share my knowledge in a positive way.  Okay okay, I need volunteer hours for National Honor Society, not to mention college. I need to start rolling down the path of post-high school prep! AHH!  School is really fun this year, so far at least. I'm a bit more social, at least during 6th period, and it's all for the better. Plus, my classes are fun, aside from Biology of course, and I'm not super stressed out  yet (I love my run on sentences ~ oh well, that's what a journal is for; it doesn't have to be gramatically correct) I can use; as many; of these; as; I want; to!

      Aaron and Jessie like each other, and the other doesn't know. I know. I would love to remain quiet, but I know that's a little out of reach, especially when it comes to something as demented as this. He is 17 and half, and she just turned 14. I'm sorry, but there is a problem there. He is really mature, well at least in all areas except this, and although I'm sure she may be in some aspects, she cannot be in all. I don't really care though, oh well. If he wants to do that, and ruin his reputation, then so be it. I'm not going to tell him what to do, and as far as I can contain myself, I'll keep from sharing my opinions as well.   Homecoming is coming, and yes, I guess I'll talk about it some more. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!!!! I have no one to go with really; I'm sure Heather isn't too enthused, and Marie, well, she has got a mind of her own lately. It was the whole "Miss Independant" theme after John broke up with her, but she's back to "I love him, I love him! I dont know what I'd do without him! He's my best friend!" Argh. So frustrating, not to mention sick.  But I love Marie to death, and I'm sure it is difficult to get over him, so as long as she asks me for advice, I'll give it to her, and as long as she is upset about everything I'll console her. It's all listed as the duties of a best friend. Or at least I'd like my friends to do that for me.  School is improving for me, especially stage band. Katie Baltzell told me I'm a lot chattier this year, and that's good. I'm trying to be! Last year I was really inclusive and it only was harmful. I really had my feelings hurt in that class, but this year I'm having a lot of fun. Nick and Neil Melaro are in there, along with Ricky and Justin, so I have some pretty good friends.  Tennis is really great, I'm doing well at my 3rd singles spot with a record of 4-3, and Heather and I are having a lot of fun thus far.  I'm just having fun this year, and I'm really working on my happiness. I haven't had too much luck with that lately, and I guess I've done a good job hiding it, because a lot of people would be surprised if they only knew what went on. But as of now, things are good, and I'm happy!

      Argh! -- I'm so stressed out about everything! Money, AP History, tennis, my job, you name it it's worrisome. But, I am trying my darndest to remain relatively positive, because once I let myself fall down a few notches, it's pretty darn impossible to lift me back up.   I went shopping lastnight at Walmart with some of my paycheck money. I got some sweet new makeup, which I so desperately needed, a new blowdryer, and a few knicknacks that I really liked. I still have $40.00 left, and no spending that! I'm saving for homecoming, not to mention Chicago. BUT.... Mom said she'd give me $100 on top of my $100 from wreath sales last year. Now, if I could sell at least a few wreaths this year, I'm set to go!!   Homecoming is rapidly approaching, and I really would like to go with a date.  But, that's probably not going to happen, so I've already got my 2 best friends, Heather and Marie, as backup dates. :-) I need to go airbrush tanning, get some new shoes, shaper, and I'll be set.

      I don't know what is wrong, but something is. I wish I could pinpoint the emotions that I am feeling, but I'm feeling too many... After school today something clicked in me. Heather and Wade were talking, and Heather is going trick or treating tonight with him and his nieces. I don't know why that bothered me, but it did.   It's not really that I'm jealous; that's only what an average bystander would think. I guess I got to thinking about how I would love to get asked by a guy to do something like that. Maybe it's just me being upset about Sarah asking me why I don't have a boyfriend. I don't know why. Is it that the boys here at Jefferson are already taken, and the "leftovers" are the cream of the crop? Or is it me? Do I have some sort of personality quirk that people find annoying? Am I monsterously ugly? I just want to know what.   I was watching a Baby Story this afternoon, and I felt sad. At the rate I am going, I'll never get to that point in life. That just makes me feel really sad.

      I'm freakishly busy lately, and hardly have time for anything anymore. Dear God! Between UN papers, AP homework and notes, not to mention the exam coming up next Wednesday, and working all day on Saturday and Sunday so I can have enough money to go to Chicago.... Oooh boy.   Tomorrow I kind of made plans with two different people; Marie and Heather. Heather wanted to come over tomorrow and play some tennis because it is supposed to be in the seventies. (Yay!) Marie wanted me to go with her and Greg out to Chinese and then to the Powderpuff game tomorrow night. I kind of want to go with them, probably because I'm partial to the Chinese part of it, but then again, I need to spend more time doing stuff with Heather. She's graduating this year, and I intend to have a blast.  Let's just hope Marie doesn't realize what I'm doing, otherwise she'll freaking pull me hair out.  I'm busy deliberating on what I should write on the back of Wade's homecoming picture I need to give to him... if anything. Ah, I'd hate to be pathetic, but it's too much fun to pass up.

      Ah...! I have to go to work tonight from 5:30 until 9. Not bad. Don't want to go, but it's not that bad. I'm just glad I don't have to pull an 8 hour shift. Argh....   I forgot to bring home my history book to do AP this weekend. Again. God, I am so forgetful. I need to get a new brain... mine has gone to dust. I think I am going to go to "UN" (ha) and really get some sort of a start on it, at least so I can get some points. Better than zero out of 15!   Heather came over earlier to pick up her stuff that she left at my house yesterday, and to drop off some stuff she borrowed to wear for the dance. She brought some nasty, hairy, slouchy "I hate life" boy into my house and introduced me to him as "Tim," the guy I now realize she went out with last summer, and the very same guy that wants her now. Yay! I am so excited for her! She gets into a scratching eyeballs out arguement with her "beau" Michael, and now spends all day today with this guy. I know, I know, it isn't any of my business, but still, I can't stand to even think about the guys she gets involved with. I care about her way too much to see her around people she can do way better than.

      OMG! Homecoming tonight was absolutely crazy! I have a BLAST. Well, the second half when I was with Wade I did at least. The first half was crazy, Mike was being a dick, and Heather was stuck with the shaft. But, they got into a huge arguement, and Wade and I went off on our own. After that we danced, but I did feel really bad. I didn't want Heather to be left alone, so we went to go look for her to see that she wasn't actually alone, and she wasn't. So we gave them their space, went and danced some more. Danny and Alex VanAllen were there, and Danny was being stalkish and possessive of me. Argh, I knew that was going to happen. But oh well, I wasn't about to dance with him, because I know I'd give him the wrong idea. :-)  But... things with my date Wade were a lot better than I had feared. We talked a lot, laughed a lot, danced a lot, and had an overall great time. Things at time were hectic, but he was so well mannered! He gave me his jacket twice to wear because I was cold, and made sure that he didn't leave me for more than a few seconds at the most. He walked me to the door, and I hugged him goodnight. It was really great. Oh, and we got some sweet pictures done too, I hope they turn out good. :-)

      I have finished my VHS paper today, and my brain is fatigued. It is nearly 1,500 words long, which isn't really a big deal, but then again it is because it was an extremely difficult topic to write about: The Positive Benefits of Human Relationships. I'm so proud. :-) I learned a lot of new things, and I'm actually really surprised at how much I enjoyed writing it. I've spent the last 6 weeks trying to pen an acurate definition of love, and I've finally realized that with all of the words I've written about it, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface. Love is just to deep to describe, and to varying to pin down. It's different for everyone, and how am I supposed to be able to honestly say I've written a definition when I've never actually felt love for someone of the opposite sex in a romantic manner.   Tomorrow I get to stay at home again and chill, and yay (!), get to go shopping tomorrow night and skip the game at the same time, if that isn't the best thing that's happened to me all week. I am really hating those darn games, and it's just too cold on top of everything else. The people aren't actually that bad. Okay okay, Jessi and Aaron are always drowing in each others eyes, Ricky keeps asking me if Heather likes him (which, God no, she doesn't), and Marie is too busy reveling in her own baton twirling skills to notice anything around her. But I have fun with Heather, and that is great.   Mom and Dad's 18th anniversary was tonight. They went out for a few hours to eat at Kork -n- Kettle (where I might be going for homecoming?) and came back home because they felt a little sick. But on a more "romantic" note, I think that is so unbelievably awesome. Mom just told me not too long ago that she was 16 when she got married to Dad. That is absolutely crazy, yet so completely enthralling that I am left drooling to hear more. I couldn't even imagine acquiring a worthwhile boyfriend this year, yet alone find the person that I am destined to spend the rest of my life with. But, hey, you never know; I doubt either of my parents thought it to be too attainable at the time either. I guess sometimes things work out totally different than you may have expected, and who's to argue? God is keeping an eye out, and He wouldn't let something too bad happen to those that He loves so dearly.... right?

      Homecoming is next Saturday, and I have no idea what I am doing. I don't like the fact that making the plans is solely up to me! Wade asked me, and in doing so, I assumed that he'd care enough to even talk about it. He's paying, at least I hope so, and therefore I do not think that I am entitled to make any choices. Him not talking about anything is telling me that he doesn't want to go with me, and you know I wouldn't be too surprised if that actually was the case. I should have known that this is his way of practically going with Heather. But I swear to God, if the 18th comes around, and I have no fun, I think I'll pull all of my hair out... I have spent entirely too much time hoping things will work out well.  Things around here are crazy, and I hate to complain, but it gives me bad feelings to even think about it. There is so much tension between everyone, and I don't like being here. I'm much more comfortable at school, and that is crazy! I'd much rather be around those strangers than my own family?! That's is wrong, but I can't help it; it's how I feel.  But on a more positive note, Mrs. Payne gave me (along with 3 others) a lovely thank you note and a $30 gift certificate for the Ashtabula Mall this morning, which is absolutely wonderful because I really need that money for some stuff for homecoming. There it is again, that dreaded H-word! I need to stop, I think it's all this nervous energy flowing through these fingertips of mine.

      I honestly feel as if I'm stuck in this swirling oblivion, screaming, but no one hears me. I'm not going to point my fingers at the world, and pass it off as their fault, and not mine. It is mine. I'm too odd about certain things; I don't like faking friendship, and get upset when things begin to fall, I get hurt entirely too easily, and I hold grudges against those who have crushed my heart. But that's the thing! A smile is much more beautiful when it is follows a tear. I know I can make things better for myself, whether it be to just positively acknowledge what I have been gifted with. I'm a strong person more often than not, and I need to work things out within this twisting mind of mine, because, I'm not going to spill my problems on a friend and burden them with my own insecurities.

      Things with Marie are rapidly deteriorating, and I don't know what else to do besides watching it slide. I have tried, I really have. But everytime I talk to her I get so upset! How could she do this to me?! I thought I was a great friend, but why under the sun would she drop me for Jessi? Her and I have history, they don't. (As if that really matters, but hey, I'm trying).   The tennis party was tonight, and surprise surprise: I wasn't allowed to go! I am actually in trouble with my parents right now, but I don't really care. They are the ones that flip over everything. I am only 16 freaking years old. How the hell am I suppsed to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders, and still remain civil. I just haven't had that much experience with stuff in general. Obviously I need it.  Things are so bad right now. I am just really fatigued, and things are falling around everywhere I go. I am trying, I really am, to keep everything together and to remain somewhat positive about life in general. But, I am slipping.

      Wade came over on Saturday, and it was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. I have to admit, I was afraid that things were going to be really ackward, but that's completely normal, right?! Haha. But yeah, my parents like him and he things my family is cool, so everything's all good.  Then, on Sunday, I mustered enough courage to call him. And finally yesterday he sat at my lunch table. So, basically, I feel a lot more comfortable with things. Yeah.   Tennis sectionals were today, and in a way I am glad that the tennis season is done and over with, because the whole match thing was frustrating (my record ended up being 10-6.... not bad). I am pretty sure that I am playing through the winter at the fairgrounds, and that starts mid-October and goes all the way through April, which if you ask me, is AWESOME. I'm going to be further skilled by next summer, and hopefully will be able to play 2nd singles well.  I got home today, and saw that Marie called and left a message on my machine. Do I want to call her back? Because I know all I am going to hear about is how wonderful of a friend Jessie is. And that drives me up a freaking wall, because I have totally lost her. She has gotten so darn full of herself, that it drives me crazy! How does anybody honestly expect me to listen to her rantings and ravings every day. FOR ONCE, just for once, I'd love to have her ask me "How was your day, Jennica?"

      Things around here are so, well, stupid and annoying that I feel like ripping every single hair out of my head and shoving it down someone's throat. Wow, that was vivid.  My parents are constantly yelling at me and biting off my head for every little thing. I have a lot of stuff on my plate right now, and I'm balancing it all surprisingly well considering my short patience fuse; however, they always "nitpick" for lack of better terms. Never say anything good about what I do, but just yell at me for what I haven't managed to do. Personally, I feel as if I am doing quite well, and I could care less what stupid little thing I get yelled at for the day. I have more important things to fret about, like my HOMEWORK.  Bye Bye Birdie play practice was tonight. God.... it is going so bad. Telephone Hour is okay, Sincere is okay, but One Boy is absolutely dreadful, and I feel bad singing loud because I am the harmony, not the melody. But Sarah DeyArmand doesn't know her lines, so on Wednesday when we do act one again, I'm belting it out. I'm tired of waiting.  I am just so freaking grouchy today, but oh well. People are stupid. Marie is really being dumb, and my sister is being ever so annoying and harassing about dumb and petty little things about "whether or not I have a boyfriend." I hate it. Everyone feels as if they need to conclude why I am the way I am, and what's more, tell me their conclusion. WHY? Because I think about it, tear myself up into shreds because that is exactly what I feel like right now, and feel even worse, because in all actuality, I am what they say.

      Work lastnight was absolutely crazy. Kenny was there for a few minutes before he clocked off, and dear God... I got a lovely open ended invatation to "bang heads" to some 50's music. Enough said...  Later though, a really cute college guy came in. I've never seen him before, so he must have been from quite a distance away. He was joking with me and asked me what sandwich I'd recommend, blah blah blah. His *father* walks in, jokes around with me some more. A few clever comebacks (on my part) later, he tells me "If my son comes to visit me more often, I'll have you to thank for it." As if that wasn't enough, he later beckons me to his table and asks me how old I was, and was flabbergasted when I replied that I was merely a junior. What was he up to? Trying to hook his son up?! Ha.

      It's been entirely too long since I have written, and there has been a great void in my life. :-) Okay, okay, in all honesty, there is a great void in my life, but it is not because of not writing in my journal. There's a lot wrong lately, indeed -- I cannot pin point everything, but  I figure hey it won't hurt to type away. In the best of light, its that much less time I have to bite off everyone else's head.   This weekend has been horrible, well, this week in its entirety has been horrible. After a smashing tete-a-tete with Heather because she ditches me for Jen which lasted until Thursday, I had hoped that my weekend would be a little bit better. Ha! Well, we had a snow day on Friday so I couldn't get my AP History books or notes to cram this weekend.... the test is on Wednesday and I will have no time. Not to mention the fact that I have to play my saxophone solo on Saturday afternoon and it is absolutely dreadful. The volume goes all the way down to ppp for the ending two and a half lines, and Jesus Christ! -- I can't even play that quiet and still sound nice. My reeds are utterly useless; Vandoren Javas are definitely not the thing to be using when I am trying to play a nice classical piece smoothly.   Okay I admit it! I AM stressed out, but I am feeling so low lately. I know that I am mediocre at a lot of things, and I am normally okay with that. But lately I hate to acknowledge the fact that I don't stand out in anything I do. I blend in with the other 6.5 billion people in this world, and to the average bystander I must scream "conformity!"  I hate that! I utterly loathe being around people that are at an extreme in one thing they do: Aaron can play the saxophone beautifully, he is the most talented musician that I  know. Sarah is phenominal with her acting abilities, her talent is so versatile. Marie is practically fluent in Spanish and is working diligently to get her Mentorship program completed for high school credit and to get a head start on her major decision. Heather for God's sakes is so damn skinny and gets all the attention from guys around her.  And then there is me. Just Jennica.   I know I need to stop it... I am going to end up dragging myself so low that I can't pick myself back up. I've done it before, and I know I am completely capable of shredding myself to pieces. I can do it the best- I know what my flaws are, where my weakness lie, and therefore I know which buttons to push.  I don't do it intentionally, mind you. It is human instinct to be insecure with what you've done, what you've accomplished, especially when you see someone else doing it better than you; however, I know I need to rise above that and see myself in the best of light.

      I got called into work tonight, and my, it was nonstop action. Chicken was big-- yeah, obviously it is a Sunday night and people don't want to cook dinner. And God, I got bitched at tonight more than I do at home, which is a mild wonder, mind you. But hey, 6 and a half hours at $5.50 a pop--- whew! Am I racking in the dough!   Okay, Okay! In complete honesty, my day was actually kind of nice. And I feel completely insecure about that fact, as much as my last two statements diabolically opposed each other. I feel good, but I am afraid that because I feel so good, the only way that I can go is down. Something will happen that will hurt me; someone will say or do something that will allow what I have allowed myself to feel tragically come crashing down. I need to stop, I know I do, but I can't help myself.

      Oh my goodness..  this afternoon, well technically late afternoon/early evening, has been the best of my days in a long while. A very long while.  Kenny asked me to prom, and I so happy that I literally smiled for the rest of the day, up until dinner at least. Indeed, I felt a little insecure about the fact that a guy was asking me, especially after my lovely rendezvous with Wade at homecoming. So, although it may not have been the most appropriate thing to do at the time, I asked him flat out if he was asking me just so he would have a way to get there. He said no- actually, he said something along the lines of prom not being that important, but he'd have a blast going with me. That's flattering.  And as if things couldn't get any better for me, he wanted to take me to Bilo with him to pick out flowers and a card for his mother. He knew I was going on break so he waited for a good 15-20 minutes in the lobby for me. Plus, guys who treat their mother great respect women...always nice.I feel important, I feel special, and God-- I haven't felt like this... ever.

      Happy Wednesday... thank goodness that the beginning of the week is over with. Maybe it's psychological -- we know its Monday (or Tuesday--whatever the case may be), and we convince ourselves that that is bad.  I don't know. In all honesty, this week hasn't been nearly as bad as I had anticipated, and that's great. Kent is over with (and I don't feel incredibly guilty because I managed to pull of an award with Alex), my term paper is finished (turned in to the MLA satan, gratefully), I made NHS, and I'm good.   Okay, so today, Marie and John go into Dr. Pattersons room at the end of lunch (to do God knows what), and Heather and I are just sitting there--I'm thinking what it is that they actually do because they evidently feel as if the lunch room is not adequate for their endeavors. So I grab Heather and tell her we're going to find out. We sneak down there (I was wearing my bright red heeled hooker boots-- you hear them coming a mile away), and sneak into the office. Just as we think we did something successfully, Marie spots us. Oh my God, she was so mad. But it was so great. The whole situation is pretty disgusting actually, she's so infatuated and its amusing, but that's that. I don't care. It's her life, and as a good friend, I shouldn't denounce what she thinks is good for her, because I'm just wasting my time.

      I am so frustrated with Kenny right now. I haven't called him back after Tuesday because he really didn't want to talk to me then... we were supposed to do something tonight but he hasn't called me. What? Have I, yet again, attracted the wrong guy and getting my hopes crushed is completely inevitable? Probably. God I hate being this type of girl- so completely placing my heart in his hands, and if he doesn't call I'll believe that it was my fault, when I know that it is his fault but will refuse to believe it.

      Being bold and daring such as myself, I normally would never discourage turning down a good dare... except swallowing pickle juice (I cringe just as I mention it). Oh my God, its like... permanent goosebumps in a jar. Anyways... let's just say I am now $2.00 ahead. :-) Wonderful.  Today was a good day. I woke up to my alarm clock -- and of course I pushed snooze a good 5 times -- and when I went downstairs, much to my dismay, I realized that it was an hour behind. I forgot to "spring it forward" on Saturday night. I changed like a madman and practically ran to the community center for the senior Easter breakfast this morning. Chad was already there, and being the lovely friend that he is made a short but effective comment on how I look like a trainwreck--- and on top of that a lot different without makeup. Indeed, he needs to really work on his charm but hey, maybe he won't grow up to be a schmoozer like most of the guys I know.   Dad took all of us out to Chinese tonight; probably a sheer attempt to cover what happened yesterday, and I am so not one to argue. I can never turn down a nice steamy hot order of broccoli and garlic sauce. But it was nice-- we didn't argue today like is typical of any school vacation week. And to top it all off, we played a mind boggling and table turning game of Pictionary this evening that did not result in any hurt feelings or torn hearts, but instead a bunch of sore mouths after all of that smiling. So yeah, it's been good.

      Mom and Sarah just went to Chinese. That shouldn't bother me, but the fact that they totally just lied through their teeth to leave the house-- and me-- drives me absolutely insane. And it should! Just tell me the fucking truth... don't lie because (1) it is totally hypocritical, especially for my mom to do, and yeah, Sarah too seeing as she tries the hardest to emulate Mom down to the way she does her makeup; and (2) they are leaving the house to get away from me and Matthew. ME and MATTHEW- STOP PUTTING ME IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THAT 12- YEAR OLD TORNADO! I am ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like him. So yeah, thanks guys.   Okay, I feel like screaming-- and in a way it is kind of sad that this is the only way I ever have to vent. Kenny blew me off not once, but twice this week. Screw it-- I swear to God, is it me? I think I'm cursed, honestly. Why in the hell am I wasting my time with this boy- stupid me, I actually thought he liked me, that I finally met a good guy, a good well mannered and smart guy that I like. Well, I just got the cold shoulder for a Lord of the Rings game yesterday, so putting in that perspective, I should just go drown myself in my own stupidity.   I haven't heard from Marie since Monday when she called me a bitch for being a little frustrating (and I was completely entitled to be upset, mind you). She told me that if I didn't go to calling hours I would be in the wrong. NO. NO. NO. Woe is she, no one wanted to listen about her and her fucked up life with her practically nonexistant and practically imaginary "boyfriend" John. I'm tired of swallowing what I want to say so I can listen to her. NO. It's not happening, and Monday definitely wasn't the day to try to overpower me again to talk about herself, and on top of all of that, call me a bitch because I didn't want to drop Dot's death. I had to gulp down my emotions when Carolyn died, I didn't want to talk about it but knew I had to because she was my best friend. Again, STUPID ME.

      "Everything happens for a reason, and God is always on my side." Ironic. God-- you did this for a reason... I wrote this for a reason-- you knew this before I did-- you knew I needed to reassure myself that I can handle anything this morning.   Dot's gone. Lastnight at around seven she drove off of the side of the road and hit a tree... and God took her with him to His home. It is so hard to swallow this because Dot was so full of life, goodness she had a 16 year old son, Brad. Why? I know he needed her with all of his heart, I don't think he has a father. She was the only one that he had, and now he has no one. Goodness, I am hurt so much today, and I am not even directly affected... I don't know what to do.

      Oh goodness, today hasn't been the greatest of days. It started off horribly-- confrontation with dad (whats new) and dealing with my wildly unrestrained siblings as fun as that is; but hey, the day did get better. I worked with Heather and Kenny, my two favorite Hardees people of course-- my best friend and my boyfriend (God I feel so weird saying, or typing that rather). I argued with my dad again when I got home-- again, absolutely horrid experience. But... we apologized through eye contact at dinner, and I feel okay now. I read some AP, listened to the Les Mis soundtrack, watched some Friends reruns, and here I am now.  No, not the greatest of days indeed. But, I have all of my limbs, I am not plagued with any serious contention, no illness thwarts my ability to live my life to the fullest, so I'm good compared to some. And I guess that's all I can ask-- to realize that when I am having a bad day, that many have it worse than me, and I really need to remind myself that everything happens for a reason, and God is always on my side.

      Ahh... another day come and gone, thankfully. Sometimes I really wish that I could entirely jump this "stage" of life, and leap right into the heavens where I would not have to deal with the woes of life. But, indeed, then I realize that that statement itself sounds suicidal, and I do not intend it to be so at all. But I guess I'm safe typing it here, as I don't really have anyone to misconstrue my words as they do when I speak them.   My friends are completely forgetting me. And whats just as bothersome, I am asking my self if I am really that forgetable? I lost my best friend on Wednesday for good, and I'm working on losing the second one. It's inevitable, I should know that by now. I get to the point where I can share pretty much anything with someone, or goodness, even cry in front of them and not feel guilty, and they disappear.   I really cannot do this much more, and I mean this wholeheartedly. The words that are coming out of my mouth these days should not be disregarded or underestimated. I mean what I say (and what I type), and I mean that I cannot be stepped on for much longer. I am just about to break into a million pieces and scatter into the wind, nameless and lost.

      Today should be entitled as a "blah" day, and it is worthy of said title. But it wasn't. I stayed home from school and called off of work because I have been feeling horrible the last couple of days, all culminating in this morning's aches. Honestly, I have been so emotionally down this week, I think it spread to a cold. But that's besides the point. When mom came home from work, and brought Sarah and Matthew with her, things all of a sudden turned somewhat upward for me--and I am surprised. I have gotten to the point where I know no one cares, I don't care, and I don't care if I stay like this. It's really gotten to be a permanent part of my life and I don't think it is going to change for a while.   But today, I drove my parents and sister around town, went to Sonshine Corner and found Kenny's birthday gift (God I really miss him today-- I just want to be with him again) which I didn't feel too confident about when I first (reluctantly) decided on it, but am feeling okay now. Then we all went to Chinese which was nice. Matthew wasn't there, indeed, but it still was nice, circumstances considered. We're all at home now watching movies, and it's still nice. I don't know, perhaps its just me sick and dillusional, and I know I'll wake up tomorrow morning and cry because its another day that I don't want to experience, but for now, I'm in this really weird mood. Actually I have the perfect way to describe it: it's like I'm standing in the eye of my latest hurricane of a life, and things are calm, but for only a few minutes before things spiral again. Wow, that's kind of scary. I am really scaring myself.

        Walk on through the wind,                          Walk on through the rain,                          Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown. Walk                                           on, walk on                          With hope in your heart                          And you'll never walk alone.  I really need to get out of Jefferson. The longer I stay here the longer I ache.   I am happy for Heather, I really am. She is going to be able to take her life to an entirely new level, hopefully a level better than the  last. It is just hard to swallow the fact that I am not going to be able to see her very often anymore. She'll want to move onto bigger and better things, away from this part of her life she'll probably just refer to as a rut. And I don't blame her. I would probably do the same thing. Actually, I know I will do the same thing. But just a year later than she.

      Work Friday night, Saturday night, tonight, and again tomorrow night. Whew-- one more night to go, and then I have 3 days off (hopefully one of which I will be able to spend with Kenny). :-D   Tonight was an absolutely hideous night, but it is over with. I want to type it out, but I think it's best left as what it is: the past. I really need to stop dwelling on these petty things that really bother me. I honestly think it is my greatest flaw. Ah... Jennica in a nutshell.   Two more weeks of school, two more days of it with Heather. It's going to be weird, probably for the worse, but I'll learn to deal with it. I heard Jen Konopa got a job at the Cove as the new shot girl. I don't exactly know how I feel about that, but lets just see if Heather will tell me or just lie about another thing concerning her and Jen.

      I am ever-grateful for this site. Honestly, it is not like there are throngs of people lined up to hear my woes. It's really easy to vent to someone, or something rather, that does not yell at me when I push its "keys" too hard or too often, or does not scold me when all I can say of my day is something negative. So thanks.   Here we go again then--all of these little things that like to pile on top of my head (and scream into my ear) and finally just explode I guess. Tonight in entirely was so bad I suppose it could constitute as one of those days. The "prom dilemma" of this past weekend bothered me to no extent, but I didn't feel like complaining to anyone. Ha. Mistake. It came back to haunt me today when I watched the video my mom so painstakingly taped on Saturday and the pictures I developed. I looked so freaking horrible compared to most of the girls there, and I'm not just being critical of myself. I liked my hair, but my body is getting horrible and I really thinking that I looked like a crossdresser. My face looks like a pug dog. Completely flat. And it is really sad that I never notice these things until they are too late. I saw the pictures and cried, and the tears just haven't stopped flowing from these eyes of mine since. Once--just once-- I would love to be able to dress up, people to actually tell me I looked pretty, and for me to feel good about myself for before and after the pictures. Just once.   Mom won't let me go out on Thursday night with Eliza, probably to Ashtabula or something. She says I am abusing my privileges, but I cannot see it, especially considering the fact that I haven't gone out with anyone since Kenny and I picked up his tuxedo like 3 weeks ago. I've talked about it but haven't gone because of various occasions that my attendance was requested. But not to mom, geez, she makes it sound like I've been out every night upon night. I don't understand. Indeed the weekends are "the time to go out" according to her, but maybe she should realize that on weekends I work more often than not. Perhaps we can also throw in the tidbit that there are only a couple of weeks of school left, if that, and it's not like the most grueling and intense grading period is looming ahead of me right now.   Heather had seven days of school left. Seven days, and       BAM! she is completely out of my life. No more skipping fourth period with her, no more pastry club, water fights, daring hallway endeavors-- nothing. The only friend, if we shall call her that, that I have left to hang out with is Marie. It's my senior year, the last year at this high school that I would like to refer to as a rut in my life, and all I have is Marie. Love her to death, but I cannot stand this every-other-day friendship. Who could? Anyone with a shaky heart and able to get their feelings heart over virtually anything most certainly could not, and sadly I fit into that category.  Praying. Maybe that will be the answer, but I know I am being so pretentious right now that God probably could not be moved by my selfish wants to help me out of this point in my life. But I cannot do this myself; I cannot dig myself out of this mud puddle that I am currently sinking downwards in, and that worries me. Summer is breathing upon the back of my neck, ready to jump forward full force and I have nothing to do. I guarantee our family will fight, I will be the scapegoat for the majority of our problems, and I will sink even lower. This is what happens every summer, but I'm really afraid of this one because unlike every other year, I am not looking forward to leaving school.

       Me: Why do friendships have to be temporary...disposable? Jesus, I keep clothes longer than I keep friends!   Max: Because friends can't handle your awesomeness?   Max: But really babe, Life is a tragedy to those who feel and a comedy to those who think. Don't be offended she isn't your friend. Just think of it as her loss, and laugh.

      Talked to Aaron today. Can't tell you how I feel about that quite yet. I want to hang out with him next week, but I'm afraid he'll think more of it than I will.  I made pina coladas and watched American Pie 2 with Eliza tonight. She hates Jefferson, I hate Jefferson... we have something in common.  Argued with Marie. She called me rude, and I told her she was being a fruit. Ah, the wonders of a good friendship.  Attempted to talk to Max. Her mind is elsewhere.  Talked to Ben. He's confused and drowning in his own testosterone.

      Just got back from the pathetic attempt of a street fair hosted by our very own Village Council. The beer garden was bigger than the fair itself-- including the rides, which I may add were also equally as embarassing. Marie and I had to sell tickets, and we got out of it a good 45 minutes early, thank Goodness. No hot guys though.  I really need to meet a new guy. The question is where... but the good ones come along when you aren't really looking (actively, I hope). So does that mean I am screwed because I am now keeping my eyes open because I'm single again?

      Went to NHS with Marie today. Saw Matt Kidd... I swear he gets hotter everyday. Went shopping with Eliza for 7 HOURS. Hung out with Marie again. Yay! And tomorrow... (drumroll, please) I am getting a pedicure with Marie and Shauna. Maybe even Chinese, but we'll keep that one on the low down.   I love incomplete sentences.

        People come into your life for a Reason, a Season or a Lifetime. When you know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person. When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed.  They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually.  They may seem like a Godsend, and they are!  They are there for the reason you need them to be.       Then, without any wrongdoing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die.  Sometimes they walk away.  Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand.  What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done.  The prayer you sent up has been answered, and now it is time to move on.       Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.  They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh.  They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy.  Believe it!  It is real! But, only for a season.       LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons:  things you must mbuild upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation.  Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life.  It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

      I just got home from Marie's, and I can honestly say that I had a blast tonight. I guess that was totally in line, after my partial nervous breakdown this morning. We went to the ice cream shop and split a turtle sundae, and then stopped at Bilo Video to get a movie, and eventually (after much deliberation) decided on Chasing Liberty, Mandy Moore's new flick. Truthfully, it wasn't that great, but entertainment with my best friend was quite enough.   Marie and John have gotten quite chummy lately, and I am so unbelievably happy for her right now that words could not describe.  Not a lot of people know Marie like I do; she has tried from seventh grade on to find a "boyfriend" of sorts, and has not been successful, probably because just like many her age, she was attracted to something she just could not have. Then, completely out of the blue last year someone actually pursued her, and off and on over the past year and a half, they've been "together." I don't necessarily like the boy because he doesn't treat her well, but she is truly in bliss right now, and I don't blame her because for once, something with a boy is actually working out. And I hope that this continues, because I love seeing her so happy.   Oooh... Dad and Sarah are arguing. Sarah got in trouble and is trying to defend a situation that she has no footing on, and her desire to be the "goody goody" her soul cries to be. But it drives me absolutely coconuts because I hate hearing her try to cover the mistake she made-- the only way she can do so is to step all over Matthew. She searches for the temporary solution, and to me, I just cannot see the goodness that my parents think she epitomizes.

      Max is such a sweet girl. I wish that she lived closer, we'd have a blast together. I think the greatest part about her is that she is not afraid or intimidated to tell people what she thinks or feels; to me, that is the most admirable quality in a person. Life is too short to have people step all over you, and for a person not to do anything about it, and have their feelings crushed into the ground as if they were cheaper than dirt. And just by talking to her over the net for a while, I can safely make that judgement of her, and I love her so much more for it. She makes me smile, and unlike most of the people that are in and out of my life right now, she has never said an unkind or insensitive thing to me before.   On the other hand, I tried to call Heather to tell her that I can't go to the club tomorrow night, but she wasn't home; if she's not home, she's probably up at Hardee's, so I went up there and there she was. I succeeded in telling her I can't go, and succeeded in getting highly upset, again. I'm too damn sensitive. All she had to say to me was "Oh, can't you do something with Marie?" CAN I DO SOMETHING WITH MARIE?! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? I feel so loved; it was me or Dr. Feelgood's and they chose Dr. Feelgoods. A skanky nightclub with red glitter all over the walls and drunk guys everywhere. Incredibly fun, but I am so much better. I guess that's just me though.   A representative from Anderson University in Indiana called me this evening to say the college was "highly interested" in me. After looking at their website, I am "highly uninterested" in them. Get this:                Sexual misconduct is any violation of campus standards          related to sexual behavior, including premarital sexual relations and homosexual behavior. Sexual misconduct may include cohabitation, overnight visitation with someone of the opposite sex, or other sexual conduct not believed to be in keeping with university standards.          Pregnancy outside of marriage is the result of sexual misconduct and is a violation of campus standards. Students violating campus standards related to sexual misconduct are subject to disciplinary action, and are usually required to undergo counseling. Parents are informed when pregnancy outside of marriage is known.  This is YOUR CHOICE to make. Okay, I can understand the first paragraph... I believe it is up to the individuals involved, but I can understand it. But the second paragraph is completely out of the question. Pregnancy outside of marriage results in counseling and parental notification? What the fuck? An extremist Christian school for you.  Hahaha, the craziness!

      I just got back from the Senior Center's ice cream social, and it was mega fun. I had tennis practice this morning until ten, so I had to bicycle home in a fury to take a quick shower and be at the center by eleven. I wore a cute outfit, and did my hair too, because you gotta dress up for these things, and it poured on me halfway there. But it was so much fun jumping in the puddles. I wish someone was with me, but I still succeeded in getting soaked and having a blast. Haha, and my hair got so unbelievably curly because of it!  Chad was at the center with me for about an hour, and I swear to God he gets cuter everyday. So not "dating material," but a great friend nonetheless.   I love happy old people. They are just the thing to make a bad day better.

      "The glitz, the glamour, the nervous smiles.  I got so caught up in it, I could almost feel my heart breaking, when I was left all alone backstage.  I sat completely alone in the dark auditorium, watching with tears in my eyes and envy in my heart.  A little boy sitting in front of me, turned and stared, like little boys do.  All I could do was smile and think "I swear I have friends".  and from the depths of my heart I thought... "They are all up there, doing what they love...without me".  I shrank back into my seat, feeling small and utterly alone, but I couldn't help but smile for my those who were up there, having the time of their lives, and being completely fantastic."  Thanks to a fellow blogger, I am able to express in words (or cut and paste rather) my life in a nutshell, well at least in the past 2 months. Thank you ever so kindly.

      Just got back from Matthew's baseball game up on Club Field. They lost...again, but it was just as much fun as it would be if they had all played better. I don't know what it is about baseball; I think it is the uniforms the guys wear that are so hot! No, no, not the little boys on Matt's team--I'm talking about like high school guys and up. Okay, nevermind, this is going nowhere... haha.   Surprise, surprise. Mom and Dad won't let me go to Dr. Feelgoods on Friday night with Morgan and Heather. Dad says anyone who wants to go there "must not have their head screwed on right," and Mom ever so kindly added that the only reason I want to go is because I am a follower; only because my friends are going, and because I don't get invited out much, I jump at any and all opportunities, regardless of their worth. Ouch, that burned. I really WANT to go, I don't feel OBLIGATED to go. Mom says that it just isn't my "scene," and I'd like to think otherwise. I am a fun and responsible teenage girl, and please don't begin to argue that teenage girls wouldn't want to go to a club to dance and meet new people...ahem... cute guys? Argh... my parents like to argue that they actually know me better than I know myself (and how many times have I heard that one?), and it just is not true at all. So I guess if, well "when" really, Heather or Morgan calls to see if I can go on Friday I will tell them I am not aloud to go to the club. I guess if they are good friends they'd be a little more flexible to where they are going that night. Friends would do that, wouldn't they? God, I hope. Mom kind of put things in perspective for me today by telling me something I've been telling myself the last couple of weeks: Let what you love go, and if it doesn't come back to you, it was never yours. I've gradually been letting Heather go, and it really doesn't look like she's coming back. It hurts, oh God it hurts so much, but I think that I am better off.   I was in awe over Mr. and Mrs. Bragga today at tennis practice; truthfully, I'm always admiring the relationship that they share, but today it was really endearing. You know, they were high school sweethearts. God, I really wish that I would meet someone new- I guess I am kind of glad that Kenny is out of my life (in and out in a snap, practically) because I don't think we were the greatest match. Indeed, I had a lot of fun with him when we were together, and I never thought this when we were around each other, but I guess I kind of saw the situation through rose-colored glasses. Who knows? I'm not living in the past anymore-- I really want to start over, and as difficult and unfeasible that is for me right now, I want to do this ever so badly.   I don't know. About what? Again, I don't know. I'm not extremely upset to the point where I cannot function. Surprisingly, I'm verging on happiness here. Yeah, crazy, huh? Well, that's me for you.

      Writing in this online "journal" of sorts has become quite the routine-- haha, for once I can actually keep a tab of my emotions in a positive form! No, actually, it's really nice to go back and read my later entries, because then I think-- as I did today, at least-- that I have become much more positive over the course of the last month or so.   Anyways, Mom let me drive all of us up to WalMart today, and even over to Walnut Beach, which was a blast by the way. The water was freezing, so I sprawled across the blanket to bask in the sun, and oh do I have a sunburn to show for it. But it doesn't really hurt, so I'm hoping it's temporary.   I went to hang up babysitting signs today, because as of last Sunday, I am no longer employed at Hardees; by my own accord, of couse. I hated it there. So, I'm hoping at least one person will call me, and I'll be able to get some money for this summer.   Tomorrow is our first tennis practice! I am somewhat excited... indeed it is not going to be anything like last year, and yeah, Sarah's in it this year, so it's going to be even more weird, but I'll make the best out of it. I hit with Jen last week, and I wasn't bad considering the fact that I haven't played for about 8 months, so hopefully the Braggas won't be wholly disappointed in their future 2nd SINGLES player... Just can't let Allison pull ahead...

      Lastnight I spent the night at Morgan's-- she actually called!-- and it was pretty fun, considering it was the first time I've ever been over there. Surprisingly, I was not wrought with angst or unfamiliarity. We went on a great search for marshmallows because we were going to have a bonfire, but because it was late Sunday night it was harder than we had anticipated, so we ended up going to Dairy Queen because there was like 4   really   hot guys. Always fun!  Um... went to Hardees because Mom wanted me to ask Heather when her brother Donny's birthday was. Things are so unbelievably tense between us two. She got a tatoo on her freaking ankle! God how stupid can you be? And it was a lizard on top of all of that, how hideous and cheap. Aside from yet another rant, we got into another "mini-fight" lastnight and I didn't want to see her today, but it was alright I guess. No cat fighting, and that's always a plus.   Matt's game started at 6 but we got rained out...again. I was actually looking forward to it. But it's okay I guess, I'm searching for more scholarships right now, and it's proving quite unsuccessful, so I need the time I can get.   Anyways, I gotta go, Dad's harassing me to get off so he can play. Whatever, I'll finish up explaining my eventless day in explicit detail later!

      I was thinking... how have I changed over my junior year? I want to make a list of memorable things that have happened this year! :-) Fun!   (1) I have experimented with my hair more... pretty adventurous. Let it grow out or a while, but then cut it short again. And I learned how to do an updo!  (2) I swear more, but only when the situation merits a good curse word. First time I've ever said fuck in front of my parents, ouch.  (3) Got and lost my first "real" boyfriend, Mr. Kenneth Carvahlo... a lot of firsts...haha (4) Began my driving rendezvous! Can get my license on September 1!  (5) Began and quit my first job at the infamous Hardees. Better forgetten.  (6) I have become much much more rebellious-- skipping class and the like. :-)   almost   got my first detention.  (7) I actually had the nerve to tell the deemed "senior king" Peter off because I can't stand his egotistical ass.  (8) Went to both homecoming and prom     with a date! (9) I rode my first rollercoaster ever this year-- and it just so happened to be the biggest in the world. Millennium!  (10) I went away from home, to Chicago Illinois to be exact, with my Model United Nations team. Mom cried. I loved it-- well, not her crying, but the trip. (11) I won awards at both Kent State and YSU this year all by myself! (12) Dancing-- ahem-- that one will remain exclusive between me and a few others who shall remain unnamed.  (13) I got accepted to the National Honor Society and while I did not deem it as my accomplishment of the year, my parents were happy. (14) I made 2nd singles on the varsity tennis team and won 3rd all NEC. Kicked this girls ass from Lakeside, some fat chick who had a mean forehand... enough said. Hey, I was proud.

      I just got back from Matt's gig at Jennifer's Coffeehouse. I went with Doug--the most conspicuous of all true "party-goers," and it was alright I guess. He really didn't talk...he's the shy genius type. Very nice though, I don't mean to judge. Just not my type. He has a nice car though. God-- I can't believe I just typed that... it sounded so hollow and pretentious. Haha, no, he is a well mannered boy, good natured, and I had fun. Matt Kidd is just so cute though, but I could never allow myself to get mixed up in the love triangle he's entangled himself in. It's just better to gaze from afar...   We met Rachel and Beth at Rachel's and got there around 7, but they didn't start until around 7:30. The coffeehouse itself wasn't too shabby, but pretty typical of Conneaut in that it wasn't the Tajma Hall of all coffee shops. I saw Jo though! God it was great... I met her other couple of friends and we talked hair. She got my number and we're gonna do something next week, which is exciting because I need to go out with some new girls. I  want so badly to expand my horizons: meet new people and do new things. I think I am already beginning to do that a little bit, but I don't know if I can continue this.  I got my hair cut today, too! It's actually really cute and flippy. I want to highlight it so bad, but I can't because I am currently without a job, and without money. I want with all of my heart to look nice-- I want to do my makeup and hair and wear clothes that make me feel good. I think that I will try to fulfill this goal of mine. Ah, what a new haircut can do for you...   ACTs are tomorrow morning. Ugh! I took my practice test today and I got a 24. I shouldn't complain, it's not nearly as bad as Marie with her 16, but just isn't good enough for me. I need a 27. I want to go to a good college, but my GPA is so messed up right now, and I need a solid ACT score to show college admissions committees I am smarter than what a glance might entail. So yeah, I'm going to pray so hard tonight... I need all of the help that I can get right now.

      Kenny is so unbelievable. He hasn't called me since last Thursday, and I want to know what the problem is. Is this his discreet manner of "breaking up" with me? Is he extremely busy (I doubt it) and has no time to call? Is he upset with me, and does not thrive on confrontation? I hate this. I don't like not knowing what is going on, because I can't do anything to fix it.   Breakfast this morning was actually a lot of fun. Marie did indeed pick me up, a few minutes late, but at least she came and wasn't grouchy. We sat by Greg, Doug, and Rick, and "chatted." Mr. Bragga even paid for breakfast for all 15 of us! And the tip! Completely amazing; not only is he one of the nicest men that I know, he is also the most generous. This world needs more men like him in positions of authority as he is currently. People who actually cared, not out to stab the next guy in the back and rob him of all of his worldly goods.

      It's about 8:20 and Marie should be pulling in any second. And I guarantee she'll complain about the garbage cans being out, even though I pulled them a good 5 feet away from the driveway. Ah, the woes of a new driver!  Actually, we have an NHS meeting this morning at "Mugs," the local diner for those who wish to be seen by rising members of our thriving little town here. Not my top choice, but hey, I get breakfast and I get to see some of my friends. Not to mention finding my genius friend Doug Walton because I think we might be going to see Matt Kidd play at Jennifer's Coffeehouse tomorrow night in Conneaut. Still have to find the number for my mother so she can call and make sure they don't "serve alcohol," because you know me, Jennica the hidden alcoholic.   Wish me the beginnings of a great day!

      I love weird objects: crazy shoes, crazy hair, wild and unrestrained personalities not afraid of what the world might through back at them. They make me feel so fulfilled, although I do not quite know why. I absolutely adore just pausing and letting the very winds of life blow through your hair, in one ear and out the other, and letting these winds inspire creativity. God, I don't know what is with me tonight, but I feel as if the entire world is in my hands. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, and do it because no one is stopping me. I am not stopping me, like I normally do. I feel so content right now, and I don't know where this has come from. Goodness, I swear I have split-personality disorder. Just an hour ago I was crying and could safely say I felt for the first time in my life why some people commit suicide. They feel cornered--I felt cornered--and that's really scary to admit. But at the same time it makes me marvel at the way that I work. I have true confidence in ways that some could never imagine, and I know that I am able to conquer many of the things that I fear just because I would like to know that I set no definite borders for myself. I love the things that scare me.

      My goodness; for once, I do not have any negative words pouring out of my fingertips. I don't think there are any words that could describe what I am feeling right now. I am not in complete euphoria, but I've had a lovely day. And I am listening to Whitney Houston's Greatest Hits right now-- a person could never feel down while listening to the queen of soul herself. :-)   I only have three more nights of work at Hardees, and that is so completely exciting to me. I'm not going to have a job, indeed, but it is going to be so nice to not have to deal with the people there anymore. Liberation at its heightened best.

      Oooh... something is getting under my skin today and I cannot quite pinpoint it. This morning was fine, actually, so I'm kind of surprised. Dad actually let me drive Mom and Sarah to the mall-- we had to help Sarah pick out an outfit for her singing "debut" at the Lake Erie Speedway next weekend. She got the cutest little pink outfit, complete with a "pimpin'" hat... she is really going to look hot. Then we came home and BAM!... irritation. I'm sure it has something to do with her hip outfit-- and then me standing there with my nasty hair, nasty body, and a tee-shirt and jeans. Actually, yeah that is it. I love clothes so much, but nothing will fit me, and I don't have any money to buy the ones that do. I guess I'm a cute person on the inside that's screaming to look cute on the outside. But it's kind of impossible-- I've got the most screwed up body proportions and I end up looking stupid more often than not. I hate the way I look so much, and I am afraid that I am going to grow up and become one of those really fat women with a huge gut and a nonexistent sense of fashion.   Graduation was lasnight; I've been dreading it because it has been the primary source of the majority of my angst this past week, and It was just pulling at the corner of my eyes for tears. Heather didn't say a lot to me yesterday, actually she ran off to do something else, and I didn't see her afterwards. That is that. Our friendship is basically through, and it absolutely kills me.   I went through drive-thru lastnight, and Kenny was working. He said that a friend of his had died, and I really want to know what happened.  He didn't say much, and I didn't push it. I guess he'll call when he wants to talk to me. I completely understand not wanting to talk to anyone... actually that is what I am like all of the time.   I think I am supposed to be going to the mall with Morgan tomorrow.. we get paid! I saw some bras on sale at Fashion Bug, and I am going to get them if we go. I need them so bad.

      I don't know what to do. Everyone around me tells me to shrug these petty indifferences the world has with me, but it's harder done than said. Perhaps if the transition from being put up with to hated was gradual, I could handle this rapid decline. But it's not like that. It's all of a sudden, and just as people's opinion of me has lowered, my outlook on life has taken a nosedive. I know I cannot deal with this for much longer. I tell myself I can, but deep down I know that I am not strong enough to swallow the hatred that the last month--and all of the people and places-- has thrown into my face. I guess I'll wake up tomorrow, it will be another day, I will fall even lower, and go to sleep again.   Marie came over tonight and we went out to ice cream. A medium turtle sundae to be exact, and absolutely delicious at that. It actually was the highlight of my day thus far, and again I find it amazing that I can have such a horrible day... such a horrible week, and something so small can make me feel better instantaneously. And what's more, how quickly I can fall back into this limbo land where anything and everything can leave me in tears. This is wrong, it feels wrong. A person should not feel like this. Ever.

      Professor Batty, you make me smile.  Erin's little brother is absolutely adorable, and such a joy to be around. So inquisitive, and so bluntly honest. Hopefully when he grows older, he will keep his impecable mannerisms, desire to learn, and quirky personality, because these are the qualities that that set you aside from the remainder of the 6 billion people in this world.   I am really liking the single scene... again. I like not being obligated to call, obligated to talk, you know, just the whole "obligation" of being there for another person. I don't think I'm very good at that. I'm not reliable. Not consistant. Although, I must admit, I am sure it wouldn't seem like such a hindrance, or such a downfall on my behalf, if I actually cared about the person. So, I guess I am not entitled to say that I am truly exhausted from making attempt. I cannot denounce what I have yet to experience-- meeting a person that will bring something out of my very depths that I have not seen before. However, people talk about how greatness and sheer optimism just seeps out of their pores when they are with someone that they love, but I've never heard someone admitting that a bad side surfaced. Is that because it doesn't happen, or because no one can bring themselves to admit that they failed at what is deemed to be the most natural, easy thing that could ever ever be done when the situation is real? I guess my point is that I think it is better off for me to be single, because I don't have "what it takes" to be with someone that I do not think the world of. And at this point in time, I think the world of no one.   I don't know where that came from. Goodnight to all, and have the sweetest of dreams.

      Something about the last four or five months hasn't been so appealing to me. Although I didn't know it then, I am can now say readily that I was not happy. But the past week or so has been rather enjoyable, and I am beginning to feel as if I am tasting the goodness of life. And it's pretty sweet. :-)  If Erin calls back anytime soon, I might very well perhaps go to see Sarah in "Fiddler on the Roof" a second time tonight. After all, I have a comp-ticket, and I can't let that go to waste.   Birthday countdown continued: 4 days! You better all be there for me on Monday!

      Mom is taking me to get my hair done for my birthday on Monday (yee-haw!), and I know I want to do something wild that would really make people think, "Jennica?" So how about a cute  platinum blonde  pixie cut with  hot pink?  Any objections? :-D  Marie and I went over to John's house earlier, and what I saw really made me smile. You have Marie, who is completely head over heels for one boy ("one special boy... one boy to walk with, one boy to talk with, one boy... that's the way it should be..eeeeeee" lol). And as cute as the notion of her adoring him so is, it was even more adorable to see the feeling returned. They are both tickled pink over each other. It's so nice to finally see Marie floating in sheer ecstasy; for her to be completely oblivious to all else but her feelings for one person. It's so raw, so pure, and so untainted, and so rare! She's truly a gem.   I'm liking these comments you all are leaving me. They make me smile. For those of you who have, keep it up; for those of you who have not, by all means do!

      Just waiting for Marie to come pick me up; we're going out to Mugs before our NHS meeting this morning. You know, sometimes I really just sit back and marvel the friendship that we have. One day we are laughing, talking, and enjoying everything for exactly what it is -- no more, no less. And the next, I can honestly say that I do not wish to converse with her ever again. But I know, no matter what happens between us, that if I ever need anything, she is the first person that I could go to because not only would she help me through whatever it was that I had trouble with, she would do it with a smile. I love you!   Never again shall I underestimate the power of prayer. I feel so good. So... new. Now hopefully my sickening optimism will begin to effect those around me.  I saw that someone left a comment in my blog yesterday afternoon, Professor Batty, and I am left pondering whether he was a passerby or an avid reader, left hanging on my every word. :-) Nonetheless, having a complete stranger tell me that I was awesome was indeed wonderful. People should engage in that sort of thing more often.

I hate shallowness. I hate how Marie is starting to hang out with people who have no running definition of the word "class," and suddenly she seems to think it's rubbing off onto her. And have to listen to her tell me that making out, hypothetically, on the first date, or making out in the back of a loaded pickup is "not a big deal." Had I have asked her that two months ago she would have been vividly opposed. But then again, nothing is ever shielded from the turn of time. And yes, I hate that too.  The only person I can ever depend upon is myself. Here's to my usual inner grouch. Cheers.

        Dear friend,  Part of me wants to call you right now, to put all of what has been going on behind is, and to have you back as my only true friend. But the other part of me rationalizes: wouldn't it hurt less for me not to talk to you, than to talk to you and realize that I am not important to you anymore?     You say I have never opened up to you. I'm sorry. I just cannot seem to live life sans this happy masquerade that I've been putting on for everyone. I honestly don't think that I could pen my emotions into words, and furthermore, tell those words to you. I truly believe that if I actually "opened up to you," as you so casually coin it, you wouldn't want to be friends with me. You are friends with this happy, optimistic, fun girl that I've been throughout junior high and early throughout high school, and I am so afraid that if I begin to tell you some of the things that actually actually go through my mind, you would find out that I am not the person you've always thought me to be. I don't know who I am right now. I don't know why God put me on this Earth, and that is a question I need to find out.       But this is what I know right now: that you are the one person I've ever been able to trust e-v-e-r, you are the first person that I want to call when something good happens to me, the first person I want to call when I just want to cry. Advice? I come to you first. But what I also know is that throughout the course of the past month or so, I have not been that first person on you've come to for the things that really matter. And that hurts more than I think you could ever imagine. And there is nothing that I can do about it right now, because I've already told you how I feel. If someone is your true friend, you let them go, and they will come back. So now I am just waiting.     So, they say that people change with time, and with that, I am assuming friendships as well. I do not know what to do. They also say that you never stop loving your first love, so I guess that could also mean you never stop loving your first best friend. You know who you are.

You have hurt me so much in the past two weeks; I don't think you could ever imagine. Maybe that is because you're too caught up in yourself to notice, or because you just don't know me well enough.

      This is me:       I am extremely stubborn, and it takes close to an earthquake for my opinion to ever change. I see everything in black and white: either it is or it isn't.         When I am sad or hurt, I cry; When I am frustrated, I cry; When I feel as if there is no possible thing I can do or say to help a situation, I cry. But, as quickly as a resort to that measure, I'm finished. My pain soaks in. But what most people don't realize is that just because I don't cry doesn't mean that I don't hurt. Actually, me yelling and carrying on could very well be much better than me staying quiet, because I remember what you people have done to me, and I will never forget it.          I don't trust anyone. I can't even trust my family. I am too afraid of getting hurt, getting disapointed. I can't open up to people, because I'm paranoid. I think I'm finally going to trust someone, and they'll betray me.          My self esteem is now at an all-time low. I feel ugly, I know I'm getting fatter, but I don't have the motivation to change it. And what's worse than my angst about my outer appearance, I think that the  person  that I have become is unattractive as well.          I chase away people, completely unknowingly. I completely fuck up my relationships with those I care about, but I don't realize it until it's too late. And then starts the dwelling...     I frequently alternate between feelings of high self worth and complete and utter disapointment with myself. So people get mad.     I am paranoid and narcissistic. At the same time. And I hate it, but it's me    But I'm Jennica. Incredibly eccentric, friendly to all (even though at times I shouldn't be), fun to be around, and worthy of your love. So, note to all: I'm not as scary as you might perceive me to be.

      Sometimes I wonder why God put me where He did; why I have the friends I do, why I live the place I live, and why he made me the person that I am. Because sometimes, I just wonder how much of it is shaping the person that I am becoming. Instead of dealing with what is thrown in my way, I've become accustomed to just grin and bear it. Is this what the purpose of living life is? For a quick "run-though," when instead of dealing with problems, I just glance, smile like I care, and continue on my way? I'm just beginning to realize that I'm doing things all wrong. I'm worth a hell of a lot more than people are treating me. So, their gonna start doing things my way, or no way at all.     I don't understand.  Why do some people tend to breeze through life happily while I have to work to achieve any sort of satisfaction?   Please God, help me. Stop making waking up so damn hard.

      What an eventless day. I went to the senior center, but Chad nor Vickie came, so I had to "chicken and rice myself" by myself. Woe is me. :-( But on a more positive note, I sat next to Millie today and we lamented over the extremely tall UPS man because he was too young for her and too old for me.  There shall be a void in all of our lives from now on, for we are living it without seeing him.  Haha.     I got some stuff to bring to Hardee's later for Heather. She tried to call off of work, but being the witch that Cindy is, she "was not allowed." Whatever, don't tell me that of the growing list of employees, floating around 30, you couldn't get ahold of the other 25 who weren't working tonight? Sdaflkasjdf. I've still got to go get her some dinner, but I am not sure yet. Something that will last a while if she can't eat it right away. Maybe some chicken and rice soup and an eggroll.     Back to work tomorrow, but with Laura and Cindy so it's alright. Then I'm not working for the remainder of the week-- Friday, Saturday, and Sunday here I come!!

      A great day; the closest to the definition of "satisfactory" that I have gotten to in such a long while.  And what's even greater, I don't know why.     Heather is sick--- yes, still!--- and I am pondering what to bring to her tomorrow to make her feel better. I'm going to make her dinner, bring some extra cans of soup, some movies, the newest Cosmo, Vicks, and DayQuil... I don't know what else yet. I guess I just realized that I am not the only person hurting right now, and sometimes I have to just paste on the "political smile," and be there for those that care for me, even if it is just a fraction of my feelings for them.     Lost Aaron's piano copy of "Aria," and called him just to tell him so. Completely dodging the verbal lashing I expected to receive, I can now feel just a little bit more relieved.    Well, I'm off to indulge myself in "Under the Tuscan Sun," and a huge bag of potato chips that just seem to be screaming my name from the opposite room. I'll be back tomorrow night, same time, same place. :-)

      I don't know why I haven't been writing about the "goings-on" of my life. Too lazy perhaps. Or maybe it's just that I haven't been able to put my emotions into words.    Got my AP scores, a measly 3. Dissapointed, but not to the point I am not going to carry on with my life. I know I worked my ass of in Dr. P's class, and a score is not going to make me believe that more. So what's done is done, I'm moving on.     I talked to Heather yesterday for the first time in about a month or so. I don't quite know how I feel about that yet, but hey, a single conversation is not something for me to build any assumptions on. She' s a friend, that's all I know. Not my best friend anymore.    ***Note to self: Ask about NHS meeting if I haven't already missed it.**

         Went to Mary-Jane's today from about 8:30 until about 5:00 and it was actually nice. She is such a sweet "ol' lady," and she's fiesty too-- my kind of person! I really felt guilty taking money though, because I'm used to volunteering my time with the elderly, but I didn't argue when he threw like twenty seven dollars my way for "adult sitting."     Eliza and I played tennis from 8 until about 9:30, when it got so dark we couldn't even see the ball anymore! Hahaha, these guys came so I initiated a grunting contest, and we successfully reeled them in. What can I say, watching Wimbledon not only put a lot of plays into my mind that I can't pull off, and Serena taught me how to grunt. Time well spent.

Ben stopped over today by surprise, and asked me out for Friday night. Fine with me, I just hope he is not anticipating any more than going as friends. I'm just tired of dealing with the stupid trivials that boys have thrown into my face, and frankly, I'm not in the mood to tolerate it anymore.    I have to go to "adult-sit" tomorrow morning. It's going to be really weird.   I'm going to wish myself the sweetest dreams tonight because I think I deserve it.

      I am still on the edge of decision when it comes down to whether or not I call him. I am not over him whatsoever, and this is making me a nervous wreck.   I'll be back later.

      I still haven't talked to Marie. Well, "still" doesn't accurately describe the situation I guess; a single day doesn't deserve so drastic of a word, but hey, a single day seems like an eternity when someone you care about is no longer talking to you. But I'm not going to think about tonight, because you know what? They say the only way to have a friend is to be one. And that's all I've ever done to this girl. She's talked about John, and even though it sometimes hurts me, I still listen intently. And then she goes and does this, virtually the only thing she's had against me in a while. Yeah, the things I wrote about her weren't the most flattering comments, but for every bad thing there was a good thing. And Marie completely refuses to acknowledge that, AND the fact that I never intended for her to read any. What I expressed online I have never expressed to her in person, because I love her and would never put our friendship in jeapordy.   I miss Kenny a lot. I miss talking to him, I miss seeing his McDonald's smile, and I miss the way that he smells. Part of me is seriously debating calling him. And I don't know if that is completely stupid of me, but I think that I would regret it more if I didn't call him at all, then if I did and he blew me off. Because  then I would know that we're not talking for a reason, and that it's better off this way.   Alright, I'm going to bed. Wish me very very sweet dreams.

      Mr. Hero's hired me. Yay. 21 hours next week, so if I keep thinking about the money maybe it will sound a little better to me. Um... I'm babysitting an elderly woman with multiple sclerosis the next two days. Just a little out of the ordinary, but hey, again it is money.  Dyed Matt's hair lastnight--- I didn't buy a bleaching kit so his hair is a little on the orange side. But nonetheless interesting, perhaps verging on cute.

      Spent all night chatting with Marie about her life with John -- perfect in all its entirety. It really drove me nuts; indeed, I don't like to talk about myself, but I sure as hell don't want to talk about her perfect boy hours on end. And it gets a little tiring when I hear the "sexcapades" of others who attend Jefferson, and all the while Marie and her not-so-comforting voice saying "you need to meet a guy like John." I need to meet a guy who doesn't call often, and gets angry when you mention it; I need a guy who doesn't really place me high on his priority list. Um... yeah, I went through that, and frankly, it's not worth my time and expense of emotion.  I barricaded myself in Matthew's room all afternoon, watching movies and roasting in the stifling heat. Not bad, actually. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" often frequents my list of "must-sees;" who can resist a love story that verges on surreal-- complete with the physical transformation from the ugly duckling to the swan, the introduction to the perfect man who loves the not-so-perfect woman, and the almost fantastical blossoming of the close-minded family to a friendly "free for all"? Definitely a must see.   So here I am, yet again, continuing my seemingly pointless college search. My time is running out, and thus my patience is weaning as well.

      Evidently, the psychotic trait runs in the family. Going to Marie's tonight... Lord help me.  We're going to the library tonight too; I want to get a book with a suspenseful plot so I can divulge myself in someone else's life.

       St. Anselm's Argument Point By Point:  1) God is defined as the being in which none greater is possible. 2) It is true that the notion of God exists in the understanding (your mind.) 3) And that God may exist in reality (God is a possible being.) 4) If God only exists in the mind, and may have existed, then God might have been greater than He is. 5) Then, God might have been greater than He is (if He existed in reality.) 6) Therefore, God is a being which a greater is possible. 7) This is not possible, for God is a being in which a greater is impossible. 8) Therefore God exists in reality as well as the mind.

      I don't know where I am at in my life. Marie says I have to learn to love myself unconditionally before I expect anyone else to. She's so right. It's just that I don't know how. Girls I know are being stupid. Sex is not what makes us all tick. Especially when you are in high school.  Parents are going psycho...  please  let tomorrow be a better day.

      Heather called and left a message on the phone, so excited to talk to me because she just talked to Kenny. Well, she called from work, so whatever he had to say must have been good. My stomach is churning right now, and I just don't understand why. I've been trying to tell myself that I really don't care what he has to say, and that I was just too good for him (that itself was eas to say). I'm trying to dissolve any emotion that I may have felt for him to just throw heartlessly into the winds of time, easily to be made a part of my past, but it's just a little more difficult than I had imagined to eliminate as part of my future. Or future thought that is.

      I am so frustrated, well, frustrated does not even begin to describe my angst right now. AAaaaaaaaaaaa- why do people automatically assume that I am some strong person who can stand up to my problems and stare them right in the face? My way of solving the problem is running away from it, and licking my wounds in the dark away from all else. Calling Heather is never going to help me, it's just not the way I choose to deal with my problems. Heather has not called my house, so why call her? In fact, when she had the chance to come spend time with me, she blew me off and did not call me back. On my behalf, what part of that is inviting for me to call her and try to extend our friendship another month? And what part of that is inviting for me to make an effort not to end our friendship on a sour note?  She is ignoring me. She could just as easily be calling me. But no, she doesn't want to have anything to do with me because I am "upset." Upset! After how many years of calling you a best friend, you run away because I am upset?  Frankly, I hope she moves out of her Clay street house further away from me. I hope she goes to college and never calls me back. It just hurts too much to continue anything with her... I can't even think about the situation, yet alone call her and try to mend it. It's just not going to happen anytime soon, if ever. She's my past.   Mom says I can have a bonfire the weekend of my birthday, and I am actually pondering it. I really don't want this to verge on a party, I just want people to come over and hang out. I don't like the added stress that people are not going to have fun though. So that is the only thing that might actually stop me. Possibly.

      Asdlfakjsdofalf. I try to just keep some things in the past where they belong, and someone has to bring it up all over again. It just hurts so damn bad, and I don't think anyone begins to realize that everytime I hear her name, my insides just ache thinking of the two years of my life where I could safely classify her as my best friend, and she just drops me at the beat of a drum when I'm "upset." Nice. Really really nice.   Went to see Spiderman 2 with Jessie tonight. Sarah was and probably will continue to be angry with me for being what she would like to define as "two-faced." I would like to call the same characteristic  not judgemental of others for rumors, or mistakes they have made that are not so easily forgotten. People are more than they act to be. They have insides, they have feelings, and just because they are not friends with my sister does not mean I am going to shrug of their politeness to me as if it means nothing.   Talked to Marie on four separate occasions today. First time she was livid, second irate, third satisfied because John called, and fourth tired and ready to go to bed. She's like a gerbil in one of those little running wheels...keeps going around and around, eventually too tired to carry on, but goes through the same routine the next day like it's her first time. Only Marie. ;-)

      Went to Geneva on the Lake with Eliza lastnight. She met Mike, practically the only truly nice boy that I know (but am NOT interested in). They exchanged numbers. Yay!   Ran into Mr. X. and was clued into a major part of his life that he's successfully kept a secret from those who are not close to him... until yesterday. I am was, and still am, completely shocked, but hey, I guess that's a part of life, and something I'm growing to deal with.   I'm going out with Jessi to see Spiderman 2 tomorrow night, and we're supposed to meet Kyle there. Hopefully it all works out, because Kyle really needs to hang out with friends now, and who better than me and Jessi? We're cute, and a lot of fun!  Talking to Max now-- God I know exactly how she feels, but I don't know what to say to her. No words can describe my sense of empathy towards what she is going through, not now, but most of the time. I feel the same thing most of the time, but I never know how to deal myself, so I am not the most qualified person. I really wish we lived relatively close to each other... we'd have so much fun! Max rocks my world.   Note to self: Download "This is War", by Smile Empty Soul. Remember to download it, Max says its sweet.

      I stumbled across the most beautiful song today: "Slumber My Darling" composed by Stephen Foster (composer of "Beautiful Dreamer") and preformed by Allison Strauss. A lulluby in its purest form, this song could be the soundtrack of my life, playing every second of everyday, keeping me mellow and relaxed, and I don't think I could ever grow tired of listening to such joy. I absolutely love it.    "Slumber, my darling, the till morn's blushing ray brings to the word the glad tidings of day; Fill the dark void with thy dreamy delight--Slumber, thy mother will guard thee tonight, Thy pillow shall sacred be from all outward alarms; Thou, thou are the world to me in thine innocent charms."   Tell me you wouldn't enjoy being lulled to sleep by that.

      Work tonight was actually nice. I'm making new friends! (*Ahem* and tip money) :-) Well, truthfully, I think my self esteem gets just a tiny boost to and from Colucci's Pizza, because I have since realized since my "initiaton" into the virtuous shop that these girls actually like me. I must not be coming off nearly as high-falutin or arrogant as I must to the others in my life, and it makes me happy. That someone is actually seeing Jennica. I'm just not used to that.  Mom is still iffy about Teaching Academy next year. I want to go, and spend half of my day away from the horrors of Jefferson High. But, mom thinks I am skipping out of what I've worked so hard to get to: my last year of high school, where I don't have any extremely demanding classes. Dilemma...  Back to band tomorrow after a whopping two-day hiatus. Dreading it... Dreading it so much, but what's new? Just one more year... Oh speaking of graduation, I called Grove City College today and made an appointment for a campus tour and an interview on the 18th. I'm really nervous and really frustrated, because it's tuition is the cheapest of any college I deem worth my time, and Mom is really going to give herself an ulcer over the tuition. Hopefully, financial aid will come through for me, because I fear that is the only way that I will be able to fulfill my dreams.  I've got to challenge Allison tomorrow for tennis. No practice, thank the Lord. Mr. Bragga was playing hard-ball with me today and it really made me angry. Normally, I would have no problem throwing the ball right back into his court (figuratively), but I can't really do anything but stick up for myself for fear of losing a top varsity spot I know I would have otherwise. Ah, the woes of forced respect, even through it's not really earned.

      You are driving me up the WALL. You're blind. You are not assertive, and that drives me insane because I am the complete opposite. Maybe one day, years down the road, you will look back and understand why I said the things that I said. Not because I'm jealous, not because I am just simply "mad," but because I see people stepping all over you, and I think you deserve more than that. Hopefully I'll just have the patience to keep putting up with this.  And  you.  You went for a stupid boy, too. What's going on with all of you girls lately? Don't you realize that if someone doesn't treat exactly how you know you deserve, that someone down the line will?  I don't know. Well, what I do know is this: I'm always there for all of you whenever I think you need someone to fall back on. So why aren't you here for me now? Is it that you think I know you care? Because I don't. Tell me once in awhile.

        A chickpea in a pot leaps from the flame,   out from the boiling water,   Crying, "Why do you set fire to me?   You chose me, bought me, brought me home for this?"   The cook hits it with her spoon into the pot.   "No! Boil nicely, don't jump away from the one who makes the fire.   I don't boil you out of hatred.   Through boiling you may grow flavorful, nourishing,   and united with vital human spirit.   I don't inflict this suffering out of spite.   Once green and fresh, you drank rain in the garden;   you drank for the sake of this fire.

      I bought a car! It's so wonderful, and what feels so great is that it is  mine  and that I paid for it  by myself!  I wish you all could just fly over here, sit in the backseat, and revel in the uniquity.   Marie, Heather, and I all hung out tonight at the house with my family, and I really had a blast. It's been so long since we've had fun like that, and it was completely called for. Everyone's been so stressed out lately; Marie with John, Heather with college, and me, well, when am I never stressed about something or another? Anyways, it was a really great night over here, and well, I felt energized.  Max is giving me a speech on the difference between showing off your body and being a slut. I hope my comment about Kenny didn't throw her off the brink of insanity. I have gotten so tired about hearing and talking about sex. I'm tired about hearing and getting caught in the middle of lies. And I wish so badly that I could just tell everyone what's happening, but I can't. So I stay dazed. It's probably more of a permanent character attribute by now. But hey, this perfected fake smile comes in handy so much. I don't even know what I'm talking about really; the one thing that I hate about teenagers is the drama of all of the sexual tension. Ugh. I'm giving myself a headache.   Tennis tournament again tomorrow for the, what, third day in a row. And it really bites. Thank goodness I don't have to play until noon, because I can sleep in, play tennis, and have some workable amount of energy on hand by the time I go to work.   Tonight has just not been a Jennica-smile day, and I apologize for the excess of cynicism. I'm giving my self a freaking stomach-ache. I just need to remember to live my own life and to not be affected by others. The same things will be there to bother me wherever I go; it is a shame these are the things that bother me so.

      I know I promised a solid, truthful entry, but I just don't know if I can fulfill that tonight, guys. I'm literally exhausted, and my eyes feel as if they are going to slam shut. Just a lot going on, and I'm not used to it yet. But, time will fix that.  Mom has been dropping hints that she wants me to go a community college lately; I haven't been completely oblivious to that fact, though I've pretended to be. I just am not ready to admit that all of the work that I have done over the past 3 years has been for nothing. Not having study halls, juggling all of my classes, extracurriculars, and a job to accomplish "satisfactory" grades. And then to go to Kent? I sound selfish, I know. Picky, selective, high-falutin, sure. But I know that I am a smart girl, and I think that with my intelligence comes more choices. And I want to take advantage of those choices more than you could ever imagine.   Marie is making me really angry right now; truthfully, the situation is not even worth typing out. What's new, huh? When are we not arguing? I just know this whole John jealousy thing is getting a bit old. Tiring.   I love Eliza so much. I've gotten to know her a little bit better than the average bystander, and have gotten to see the person that she is behind the facade that she falls back onto as a defense mechanism. I just wish that everyone else would look past the choices that she has made, and pay a little bit more attention to the person that she is.   I want ice-cream. But I guess I'm leaving that one up to Ben.

      Kenny has a girlfriend. I don't know how I feel. Indiffent, I suppose. I have actually come to the point where I've just come to expect things to work against my favor. I suppose I'm just waiting to be proven wrong.    I am really glad that I've been able to "spill over" to Colucci's pizza this week. Indeed, it is the very epitome of drama-- like I need that, but still... I'm not used to girls actually getting along with me. These girls do!   I'm giving myself two lines this evening to relieve my inner teenage girl rantings: I've finally been able to style my hair where it looks cute today,  and  I ate a lot of pizza; I hope my behind isn't greeting all of these extra calories with open arms!

      Mother of all torture: Calling Aaron for a ride to band. Tried Dani, she was asleep. Tried the umbrella, I couldn't find it. I know I'm only feeding his sense of dominance. But in the short-term, it's good for me. I have a ride in the pouring rain.   Busy day today: band (sectionals too, until 1:30), and then work from 4-9. With Jessica and Julie. Working with Ashley and Terri is alright, hopefully this isn't worse.   I'll be back later. Like 10ish.

      Thank Goodness! Blogger is finally working for me. Sorry for all of you virtual addictees who were drooling for my next words, having to go a good 4 days without my sheer (yet quite unconventioal) wisdom. I was not there for you. But, alas, I am now here.   Tonight was my first night at Colucci's and it was, interesting. That place is the closest thing I've ever stumbled across in my life, as secluded as it is, that has closely resembled a true life soap opera. Quite amusing the place is, I must admit. Humorous as well; who cannot help but to chuckle when dealing with salivating teenage girls and quite promiscuous teenage boys cavorting as if there were no tomorrow? I surely cannot. :-)   My birthday was yesterday, and I had a nice day actually. My family made the day special for me, as my friends did not. I guess I know who really cares, now don't I? I did get my hair colored, but not blonde, as disappointing as that was. Instead, I went black and red. A little Kelly Osborne, but hey, it totally matches my personality.   I think I found a car that has actually passed my Dad's inspection, and is something that I can afford. The bad thing is that it is a huge '89 Cadillac. HUGE. But, indeed, it is a car. I think I should pimp it out, get a fuzzy pink wheel cover and some looovveee beads.
