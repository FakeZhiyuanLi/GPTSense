      I'm tired... So&nbsp;I should probably be taking a nice nap, but instead I find myself sitting here in front of this time wasting machine called a computer.&nbsp; Either way this is now my third entree and my font is different even though I did nothing to change it.&nbsp; Oh well it probably won't even show up differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;Haha I can't even stay on this computer&nbsp; very long because yes the little pup named Dakota calls.&nbsp; For those who don't know yet my family didn't take that long to get over Moe and we have a new puppy 9 weeks old.&nbsp; Same as Moe and Bogart, chocolate labs.&nbsp; I don't remember them being so much work but yeah they are.&nbsp; After I play with the dog and practice my trumpet maybe just maybe I will be back long enough to spill what's on Chelsea's mind today.&nbsp; Until then I'm around like usual.

      Yes it is true Moe is no longer spending his days under the sun here at the DeRose casa.  He is relaxing up in doggie heaven.  He was put to sleep for medical reasons aka cancer and such.  My whole family was hit hard with the news.  My mom and sister were complete wrecks and my brother and dad weren't to hot either, but what do you expect he was part of the fam for ten years.    The vet was cold... It was freezing no joke.  The air was on full blast.  That doesn't have to do with the story... When we got there they had to bring him in on a stretcher.  I never thought I would see a dog on a stretcher.  It reminded me of an old war movie where they are carrying the guys that are like crazy bloody into the hospital, but they are already to hurt to be saved.  Moe was a sad sight and once he was brought in the water works started.  Jessica the little sister was first then my mom.  They had already been crying all afternoon.  I on the other hand felt unaffected that is until I saw him and my family in one room, crying because he had no idea we were seeing him for the last time.  My dad was next followed by my brother.  I couldn't believe that I was watching my entire family cry in the same room at the same time.    It was unreal.  I too cried along with my family.  I think you would have to be a vegetable not to feel some emotion inside being twisted and tossed about.  Although my heart was aching and grieving I also felt something else.  Peace.  This was the first time and maybe the only time my entire family was in one room feeling the same way at the same time.  I thought it was really neat and this is probably hard to understand unless you too have felt what my heart is trying to put into words.  The five of us stood together for a period of time saying goodbye to a loved one.  I thought it was an experience like no other.  When I reached out to say my final goodbye to Moe something else stirring inside me.  I realized that losing a family member is no where near this and can't even be on the same level as a dog.  Human vs dog.  But then again a dog or any pet for that matter loves you unconditionally nonstop neverending no matter what.  Sure humans too for the most part and how can I compare a dog to a human you wonder but he was family and I guess I'm saying is I realized what losing a family member is like.  Maybe not on the same scale as a brother or mother, but its there.    I'm hungry and I'm sick of rambling because I could go on forever.  Moe DeRose 4-?-93/94 to 6-27-04  !Go Moe Go!

      There is a bunch of things on my mind and i guess this is what a blog is for.  i will start my blog on a happy note.  hello to all those who some how come across my sad little blog that really is probably a waste of time. haha.  no really i did open diary back in the day then i found better things to do with my time so i moved on.  now i have once again jumped on the band wagon thanks to janelle and many others.  but going back to a good start... its summer and for the most part im loving it!  i would love to continue but my eyes hurt from looking at this computer so im outta here to see what the world has in store for me.

      Everyone is doing it now...  Im too busy to do it now...  Maybe when there is more time to do it...  Now im just gonna say this...  I can't express my feelings thoughts and concerns on a computer  because my mind is too complex and full of stuff  this summer has been hard and fun all in one  there isnt much more to say than that so i think this is goodbye for a while  i will keep looking in on others though and reading when im bored  until the next time  farewell

      OKAY THEN... I do not care for this thing called a computer. With in a second all that I had done for the past 45 min can disappear. I do not like the short cuts on this blogger thing either. Now I get to start all frickin over which sucks major butt...  How to have fun downtown Naperville in one simple step. I definitely could tell you what happened to me awhile ago in every single detail but.... I don't feel like it anymore. This was going to be posted the day after it happened, but computers suck and time flies so its now a week or so later but I will tell you the general idea of what happened.  I played the silent game with myself. Everyone got mad and I was laughing sooo hard on the inside it was amazing. Something janelle turner would approve of.  Life has been tuff lately but ill tell why later in a different post.
