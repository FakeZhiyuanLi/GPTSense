      Whoooossshhhh...... Whats that sound, you ask? Thats my life, accelerating into high gear zooming toward the eventual crash in about four weeks.  What has prompted this unexpected onomatpoeia?  The fact that the end of the school year has snuck up on me like the Predator.  In all seriousness, I did not realize that there were only four weeks left in my junior year.  When the hell did that happen?  It just seems like yesterday that we lost the greatest basketball game in Mohawk in the last quarter century to Oriskany, and suddenly prom is the Day After Tomorrow!  Speaking of that, The Day After Tomorrow comes out The Day After Tomorrow, the same day as prom, May 28.  Prom.  Will someone please clue me in on the point of this unnecessarily glorifed six hours of my life?  OK, we've "earned it".  By doing what, obeying the law?  Whens the last time I was invited to a party at the Police Station for driving the speed limit?  If we're going to be rewarded for obeying the law, then I want an engraved thank you card for not killing anybody yet. (My next blog [or so] will be on prom party, simply because i have no time to rant on that subject now) The two weekends following prom I take the biggest tests of my life(sorry AP History, there are two new women in my life)- the SATs and ACTs.  I dont even need the ACTs to get into Siena, with my current qualifications as a junior, I'm already eligible for a PResidential Scholarship.  Ive been averaging mid-1300s on practice SATs, so I'm expecting to have a mother-churning good time come June 5.  Personally, I'd be happy with a 1250, but I doubt the folks would.  I have absolutely no clue as of now what is on the ACTs, i should study or something like that.  On a sadder note, my life has officially ended as of Tuesday May 25.  Yes, Return of the King has finally come out of DVD (of course I bought it).  For the first time in three years, there will be no LOTR film this Christmas :(.  I have only the Extended Edition to look forward to.  Oh well, they had a good run, now all I have to do is finish the entire series.  Well folks, I hear the Asteroids machine calling my name from the game room, and I have to continue my verbal bashing of Sarah, so until next time, I leave you with a quote from the new  urlLink Strong Bad Email   "More rides than you or your grandmother can handle!*" *Please do not bring your grandmother   -Proper!

      OK, I'm pretty new at blogging, so this one might be more of a rant than a blog.   Right about now I'm bursting at the seams with topics to write on, but my most recent idea came at about 2:15 P.M. today, Sunday, May 16, 2004.  Today I saw Troy, starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and a plethora of LOTR alumni (Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean, a.k.a. Legolas and Boromir).  Troy is based (loosely) on Homer's epic poem The Iliad.  While vacationing in enemy Sparta, Helen, the wife of King Menelaus, returns to Troy with Paris(Orlando Bloom, who i think any straight woman on the face of the planet would do).  Yada yada yada, Achilles dies, and Troy is sacked and razed.  But there were a few glaring mistakes.  For one, Menelaus was killed by Hector in his "dual" with Paris.  Next, Aias (the big ass one) was also killed by Hector in battle, whereas in the story he went mad much later, killing a flock of sheep, then himself.  Achilles is killed when Paris shoots his heel (hence Achilles heel), but for some reason, he somehow occurs after he somehow enters Troy in the Trojan Horse.  Helen, too, wasn't that great looking. I mean, next to Bloom and Brad Pitt, any woman in the world, even Heidi Klum and Natalie Portman, look like Ellen DeGeneres.    Since one of the only themes in Troy was Achilles quest to be remembered throughout eternity, it got me to thinking- have I done, or will I do anything, that will leave my mark on society in general and get my name in the AP History book?  As of 9:31, the same day I saw Troy, I'd say no.  OK, my name is in the OD archives for a few shitty golf scores, but who couldnt do that?  I'd say that ive set some pretty lofty goals for the future: US House of Reps, maybe Senator, but what I really want is to work at an American embassy overseas, or even Canada.  That would be pretty sweet.  But even then, what could I possibly do that wouldnt just be mentioned on the CNN ticker?  I suppose there is no way to answer that question right now, since I havent even been accepted to any colleges, let alone apply or think about applying.  Right now, I'm lovin' life, I have a great girlfriend, school is no sweat, im the captain of the greatest bunch of golfers to ever grace MHS, and I hopefully have a bright future ahead of me.  Hopefully (knock on Wood).  Anyway, what could I do that hasn't already be done?  Could I invent a new form of automobile propulsion?  Write an epic poem or novel?  Land on the moon?  As I scroll down my Buddy List, i can only see maybe a half dozen names that have the distinct possiblilty of being successful (my definition of successful) in the time we have on Earth.  We only have a limited span of time in our lives to make something of ourselves, and I refer you to my favorite quote from the book "Return of the King": "  Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till.  What weather they shall have is not ours to rule  ."  Basically, my interpretation is that we cannot conquer the world, theoretically of course, but to live with the cards fate deals us, and to make the future better for those who follow.  You can't change the future, because it is already set.  So sit back, buckle your seatbelt, and enjoy the ride, because its shorter than you or I think...   Until next time, Tom

      Girls just want to have fun! Or Tom. So far, the first three days of my *new* summer job are going just fantabulous.  I do even less work than at the bus garage and McDonalds.  Seriously.  Today I fell asleep for an hour in the school auditorium, then perfected my skill at breaking into classrooms with a wire hanger and the hidden stage keys.  Mwahahaha.  Dangeresque 1: Dangeresque, too?  I got up onto the roof for the first time yesterday, it was pretty sweet.  We (Douchebag Tom, Woody, and Me) want to camp out up there sometime, but I doubt we will.   Driver Ed starts tomorrow, which means I'll be driving after 9 in aboot a month or so, which means I can say "F you!" to the young drivers bullshit law.  Woohoo! Anyway, I hope to see Spidey 2 tomorrow, maybe with someone special, or someone special who will pay my way in because I'm broke until next Thursday.  Song of the Week: 2 Day Is Alright 4 2Nite- Dangeresque 1 Soundtrack  Until next time...And someone's a gwabbin a muh butt...(thats for Liz ;)) TOM

      Well, the movie of the year finally came out, and I must say, it was the the best documentary by far I have ever seen.  Fahrenheit 9/11 exposed the secret links between the Bush family and the bin Laden family both pre and post-9/11.  It showed the flow of money from the bin Laden family to Bush's struggling oil companies during the late 80s and early 90s, when Daddy was in office, then the during the complete grounding of all aircraft in the days following 9/11, the family of Osama bin Laden were allowed to fly out of the country.  The film continued to show the links between Bush and the binLadens, showing Bush's unedited military records without a name blacked out, and that person turned out to be the financial advisor for Bush's oil firm who took investments from the bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi embassy, coincidentally, is the only foreign embassy to receive Secret Service protection.  Why? Because Saudi investors, specifically the Saudi royal family controls 7% of the American economy.  That translates to about a TRILLION dollars!  Another link between Bush and binLaden.  But seriously, go see the film at Uptown Theatre on Genesee Street, its totally worth it one million... In other news, I finally have a free night around here.  No more graduation parties this weekend, Janasa's in Lake George, plus I start work tomorrow.  School library with Marrone, time to raise a little chaos...mwahaha.  Bob's grad/goingaway party was today, itll be sad when he leaves for Tailand (Thailand), I'll miss him along with all the other graduates.  Including Chris Davis, who I think deserves another trophy.  Joel, would you help me here? Lol  Song of the Week: Fields of Athenry, Dropkick Murphys  Until next time..."Cheat Commandoes, ridiculous breakfast! Buy all our playsets and toys!" Tommy Arden So, until next time...

      Three words: Hooters kicks ass!  Best restaurant ever...period.  150 chicken wings + a $5.00 picture + Will Welch = Good time had by all at the Crossgates Hooters.   Including Hooters, the trip to Crossgates last Friday turned out to be quite an adventure.  Hopefully I can figure out how to Photoblog and I'll post the $5 picture.  I might as well, it was expensive enough.  We lost Gilbert, but unfortunately we ended up finding him AND Burton.  Talk about bad luck, eh?   I took the ACTs Saturday without any prep, and I found them surprisingly easy.  All except for the math part, which was a just a scoch difficult.  Afterwards at McDonalds, I performed my Pimp My Ride impression: "Whatchyou gonna do to trick this baby out?  I'ma fuckin' PIMP HIS RIDE! Get it done." Well, two more days of school until I'm a senior.  I can't f-ing wait.  Except for the fact that my class sucks, I'm going to have a great year.  It'd be nice to still be with Janasa come September, I'll have something to do besides Calc and AP English.  "You cannot reach them. We tried once, yes, precious. I tried once; but you cannot reach them. Only shapes to see, perhaps, not to touch. No precious! All dead."  Song of the Week: What I Got- Sublime  Well, I hear the Chem book in my backpack callin' my name, so until next time... "Coach Z, does the W stand for witches bwew?" "Noo, its stands for tha Wu Tang!" "Coach Z, aw you a poser?" "Nah man, I'm down"  Tom

      Contrary to anything I've said in the past, I love the end of the school year. That period of three to four weeks in May/June where there is no homework, only one test, at most in half of my classes, and field trips and days off left and right.  Now don't get me wrong, I love summer vacation.  You have to be a communist not to (Igor).  But the end of the school year beats even that, in my opinion.  No work, few or no chores, abandoning all responsibility and homework, claiming you're going to a friend's house to "study".  Its pretty much three weeks with no questions from parents, no homework, and no striving.  For me at least, I don't know about the rest of you.  I'm thinking i'll break tradition and study for my finals this year...or just maybe Chem.   Other than that, the past few days have been a blast.  Aside from the scorching heat and occasional freak hailstorm, things are just peachy.  New season of Reno 911! starts tonight, gym class dodgeball, Fahrenheit 9/11 comes out the 25th, and Ramon piñatas in Spanish class (complete with dirty mullet, Bon Jovi T, and cheap-ass cross necklace.  He's so illegal its not even funny).  I went out on Janasa's boat yesterday and it was pretty sweet, its been awhile since i've been in an actual "motor"boat, not just a canoe or whitewater raft.    Sweet, I just finished downloading "Take Me Out", by Franz Ferdinand, my new favorite band, on iTunes...  Got prom pictures today, its one of the rare times where I actually smiled in a picture.  I'd say I look pretty spiffy, James Bond-esque.  All I need is a Walter PPK and a tricked-out Aston Martin to complete the look.    OK readers, the joke's over...leave some f'ing comments  Until next time...DANCE CONTEST!!! Tom

      Yep, I'm hella bored at the moment, studying for the SATs can be a real downer.  I could use a hearty dose of crystal meth.  Or maybe I can spoon feed myself Country Time Lemonade Mix.  Mmm mmm mmm mmm good.  Hows about some random stuff? Sounds good to me.  Officially, starting June 3, 2004, school has become even more worthless than before.  The only reason I even get up is to go to English, the best class ever.  Oh yeah, I want to pass Chem, too.  My day consisted of debates over the validity of VH1's Awesomely Bad Songs (specifically, Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm and Breakfast at Tiffany's), trying to decide if the cubes in the glass shown with the Cheat Commando O's was either wrapped caramels or meat squares, and watching trailers for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  And watching softcore porn in Spanish.  I missed the first day of the film, and when I watched it Thurs. 1st period, there was a woman putting her own blood in rose petal sauce, and then people touching themselves at dinner.  Ive said it before and I'll say it again...Spanish films are shastastic!  I saw the 2004 Yearbook for the first time today, and its not without its proper share of ScudPics.  I was also mentioned in a plethora of senior wills.  Lets see...Mo left me (Raef Scudder) rebounding skills, Kris left me his seriousness (and Derby his lawn ornaments), Joel left me Boys Dont Cry and naughty elves, and Sammy the Bull left me the duty of hugging at least three people a day.  At least he didn't leave me the Truffle Shuffle.  I'll really miss those guys next year, it'll just be me, Woody, Jake, Jayson, and Will.  Senior year is going to suck.  Hmmm...who will I not (or rarely) see this September? Joel, Molly, Kari, Freddy, Tiffany, Jonah, Kris, Rood, Bobbo, Igor, Marrone, Crowe, Mo, Twis, Harry, Alex, and a crapload more.  Shit, no more Crowe Appreciation Day! No more of the phenomonon known as Baked Potato Day! No more naughty elves! At least the naughty elf is in my grade, so not all is lost.  Oh well, its just like the Monty Python crew said in "Life of Brian"-   Always look on the bright side of life     Song of the Week: Hurricane, Bob Dylan  Until next time......Oh, hey guys OWWW!! Those things are bad for you! (Homestar getting punched by invisible Strong Bad carrying Bubs' swiss cake rolls) Tom  Comments, people, comments!

      I have a new mission in life: to hunt down all those people with strong opinions on subjects they don't understand, then bop them with a cardboard tube.  Which means I'd better stock up on cardboard tubes.   People in Mohawk are idiots.  Uneducated, no-collar, conservative, dead-end lives, with many of them having no concieveable reason for getting up in the morning other than reading the O.D.  Unfortunately for me, Mohawk High School has a very high concentration of these ignorant bastards. A few stick out like a sore thumb in my mind, no need to mention names (Jessica!).  These people should be beaten with a cardboard tube filled with rusty nails covered in arsenic.   The other day, I was making my daily rounds of the hallways when I happened to overhear a conversation in the seventh grade hallway.  "They should take all the gays and stick 'em on an island somewheres and blow it up".  Newsflash, they already have an island like that- is called Manhatten.  People like that don't deserve to receive a public school education, they should be homeschooled so I don't have to put up with them.  In a certain one of my 8th period AP classes, in particular, has one of those "sore thumbs", again, no names, to protect the rights of the guilty.  A quasi-Miranda rights for this blog.  Anyway, oftentimes we have discussions or debates in class, and (s)he'll blurt out something totally unrelated to the discussion, or state an blatently wrong fact about the topic being debated. I hate that.  More than Clay Aiken.   Other than that, life is good.     Song of the Week: Breakfast At Tiffany's- Deep Blue Something   Until next time...LOOK OUT BELOW, GERONIMO!! Tom

      Just like the Norsemen of yore...or whitewater rafting, whichever you prefer.   Today was the last day of my six day weekend, and what a weekend it was.  Prom, golf tourney, rafting the innavigable rapids that are the Moose River...AND...the Waterboy was on last night.   Prom kicked ass, bottom line.  Except for a stupid remark on my part, the evening was magical (ick...clichè).  Also, I'd like to mention that the music sucked, and Joe Load-o-Bullshit is the worst DJ eva.  After prom, i watched a lesser American version of "Snatch" called "Scorched"- Girlscout: "Excuse me Sir, would you like to buy some cookies?" John Cleese: "Why the fuck would I want a cookie? Do I look like I eat cookies? I eat little girls like you.  I puree them after I hunt them with my dogs!" It was actually a decent movie, considering I had no idea what the hell was going on. Tuesday I woke up at 4 freakin' 30 in the morning (damn birds) and got ready for the league golf tournament, where I played with the most fun foursome I ever had.  I shot an 85, which was my goal to begin with, so it was a very productive day. I also skipped school to play.  Its nice sometimes to not do something you dont want to and do something you want to do, without any repercussion.  Proper! MOOOOOO!!- the sound of an entering buddy wakes me from my blogging stupor- oh, its only Jayson, hes really gay:  nvmtheBollacks: id like to thank jayson morales for his sneaky ways, my publicist for getting my name around, my family, girlfriend, and most of all, me for being so awesome and everybody else for not being as awesome  Only a true Homestar fan would know the pleasure of slipping a track from Strong Bad Sings into everyday conversation, ahh...the joys of nerd-dom.   Oh yeah, I think I'ma start adding my Song Of The Week...it just seems like the thing to do, so, without any further ado......  Song of the Week: The Scientist, Coldplay  Until next time...YOU SOLD ME OUT! YOU SOLD ME OUT! Tom

      Well, despite a rather depressing couple of weeks, I received good news when I found out I would be getting a car.&nbsp; Used, of course.&nbsp; Specifically, a 1990 Audi 100, silverish-gray, with moonroof, minimal body rust, one tiny dent the size of a pastrami on rye, and oh, say around 190K miles.&nbsp; Whatever, I don't really care.&nbsp; The dealer just has to get around to replacing the slightly cracked windshield, then its MINE!! It freakin' rocks the Casbah.&nbsp;  Well, now that I have a car, driver ed has finally ended.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I won't be getting my blue card until Septemberish, but my parents don't know that.&nbsp; I got a 100 on the road test, but its not like it was hard or anything.&nbsp; Lauren could even pass it.  I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 the other night, again.&nbsp; It just gets better and better each time.&nbsp; Too bad Georgey won't go to the Crawford screening, but what else does he have to do?&nbsp; He's on vacation 40% of the time he's in office, and even I couldn't fish and golf that much. Other than that, theres not much going on 'round these parts.&nbsp; I leave for a week in Vermont Saturday, which means I miss Rood's grad party and two war games with Upson and Bierne.&nbsp;   Song of the Week: Under Pressure - Queen, Experimental Film - They Might Be Giants   urlLink Master Shake : Who are you?...

      Actual lines from Fahrenheit 9/11, regarding the actions of President Bush in the half hour following the terrorist attacks on the WTC.  FAHRENHEIT 9/11:&nbsp; “As the attack took place, Mr. Bush was on his way to an elementary school in Florida .&nbsp; When informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, where terrorists had struck just eight years prior, Bush just decided to go ahead with his photo opportunity.”&nbsp;  NOTE: It should be emphasized that at the time Bush was notified of the first plane attack, he (unlike the rest of America) was already aware that Osama bin Laden was planning to attack America by hijacking airplanes, per the August 6, 2001 Presidential Daily Brief (PDB).&nbsp; He was also aware, of course, that the World Trade Center had been historically a target for terrorist attacks.&nbsp;He nonetheless went ahead with this photo opportunity in a school full of children.  &nbsp;“Mr. Bush arrived at the school, just before 9 am, expecting to be met by its motherly principal, Gwen Rigell. Instead he was pulled sharply aside by the familiar, bulky figure of 51-year-old Karl Rove, a veteran political fixer and trusted aide of both Mr. Bush and his father, George Sr. Mr. Rove, a fellow Texan with an expansive manner and a colorful turn of phrase, told the President that a large commercial airliner (American Flight 11) had crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre . Mr. Bush clenched his teeth, lowered his bottom lip and said something inaudible. Then he went into the school.”&nbsp; William Langley, “Revealed: What Really Went on During Bush’s ‘Missing Hours,’” The Telegraph, December 16, 2001.&nbsp;  “The airborne attack on the World Trade Center was at least the second terrorist attempt to topple the landmarks. In 1993, terrorists sought to bomb one building so that it would explode and fall into the other. The plot did not succeed, but six people were killed and more than 1,000 injured.” Cragg Hines, “Terrorists Strike from Air; Jetliners Slam into Pentagon, Trade Center” The Houston Chronicle, September 11, 2001.  August 6, 2001 Presidential Daily Brief (PDB), “Bin Ladin Determined to Strike Inside US”: “Al-Qa'ida members -- including some who are US citizens -- have resided in or traveled to the US for years, and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks… FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.” August 6, 2001, Bin Ladin Determined to Strike Inside US,  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/images/04/10/whitehouse.pdf   FAHRENHEIT 9/11: “When the second plane hit the tower, his chief of staff entered the classroom and told Mr. Bush the nation is under attack.” &nbsp;  “At 9:05 a.m., the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., stepped into the classroom and whispered into the president's right ear, ‘A second plane hit the other tower, and America's under attack.’” David E. Sanger and Don Van Natta Jr., “After The Attacks: The Events; In Four Days, A National Crisis Changes Bush's Presidency,” The New York Times, September 16, 2001.&nbsp;  FAHRENHEIT 9/11: “Mr. Bush just sat there and continued to read My Pet Goat.”  “It was while attending a second-grade reading class at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Fla., to promote his education reforms that President Bush learned America was under attack. In the presence of her VIP guest, teacher Sandra Kay Daniels, 45, conducted the day's lesson, which centered on a story about a pet goat.” “9/11: A Year After,” Los Angeles Times, September 11, 2002.&nbsp;  President Bush listened to 18 Booker Elementary School second-graders read a story about a girl's pet goat Tuesday before he spoke briefly and somberly about the terrorist attacks.&nbsp; “Bush hears of attack while visiting Booker,” Sarasota Herald-Tribune, September 12, 2001.  See also film footage.  FAHRENHEIT 9/11: “Nearly seven minutes passed with nobody doing anything.”   And there is still more...how, after Bush found out it was bin Laden behind the attacks, during the grounding of ALL aircraft in American skies, the bin Laden family and other high ranking Saudis were allowed to leave the country by plane.  FAHRENHEIT 9/11: “In the days following September 11th , all commercial and private airline traffic was grounded.”  “On the morning of September 11th, there were 4,873 instrument flight rule (IFR) flights operating in U.S. airspace.&nbsp; As soon as Secretary Mineta was aware of the nature and scale of the terrorist attack on New York and Washington -- that we were faced with, not one, but four possible hijackings, and several other rumors of missing or unidentified aircraft -- the Secretary ordered the air traffic system shut down for all civil operations. Jane F. Garvey on Aviation Security Following the Terrorist Attack on September 11th, September 21, 2001;  urlLink http://www.faa.gov/newsroom/testimony/2001/testimony_010921.htm ; see also, “Airports to Remain Closed, Mineta Says,” Department of Transportation Press Release, September 12, 2001  FAHRENHEIT 9/11: “The White House approved planes to pick up the bin Ladens and numerous other Saudis.”  Fearing reprisals against Saudi nationals, the Saudi government asked for help in getting some of its citizens out of the country. National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Threats and Responses in 2001, Staff Statement No. 10, The Saudi Flights, p. 12;  urlLink http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing10/staff_statement_10.pdf   “Now, what I recall is that I asked for flight manifests of everyone on board and all of those names need to be directly and individually vetted by the FBI before they were allowed to leave the country.&nbsp; And I also wanted the FBI to sign off even on the concept of Saudis being allowed to leave the country. And as I recall, all of that was done. It is true that members of the Bin Laden family were among those who left.&nbsp; We knew that at the time. I can't say much more in open session, but it was a conscious decision with complete review at the highest levels of the State Department and the FBI and the White House.” Testimony of Richard Clarke, Former Counterterrorism Chief, National Security Council, before The Senate Judiciary Committee, September 3, 2003.&nbsp;  “I was making or coordinating a lot of decisions on 9/11 and the days immediately after.&nbsp; And I would love to be able to tell you who did it, who brought this proposal to me, but I don't know.&nbsp; Since you pressed me, the two possibilities that are most likely are either the Department of State, or the White House Chief of Staff's Office. But I don't know.”&nbsp; Testimony of Richard A. Clarke before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, March 24, 2004.  FAHRENHEIT 9/11: “At least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial planes carried the Saudis and the bin Ladens out of the U.S. after September 13th.&nbsp; In all, 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the country.”  NOTE: It should be noted that even though the film does not make the allegation, strong evidence has recently come to light that at least one private plane flew to pick up Saudi nationals while private flights were still grounded.&nbsp; Moreover, for nearly three years, the White House has denied that this flight existed. This was reported in the June 9, 2004 St. Petersburg Times article cited below.  After the airspace reopened, six chartered flights with 142 people,mostly Saudi Arabian nationals, departed from the United States between September 14 and 24.&nbsp; One flight, the so-called Bin Ladin flight, departed the United States on September 20 with 26 passengers, most of them relatives of Usama Bin Ladin. National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Threats and Responses in 2001, Staff Statement No. 10, The Saudi Flights, p. 12;  urlLink http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing10/staff_statement_10.pdf &nbsp;  It should be noted that the US Customs and Border Protection document released by the Department of Homeland Security under the FOIA, Feb 24, 2004 lists 162 Saudi Nationals who flew out of the country between 9/11/2001 and 9/15/2001, departing from New York’s Kennedy airport, Washington’s Dulles, and Dallas Fort Worth.  urlLink http://www.judicialwatch.org/archive/2004/homelandsecurity.pdf .  For an official list of Saudi Passport holders (names redacted) who flew out of the country between 9.11.2001 – 9.15.2001, see US Customs and Border Protection document released by the Department of Homeland Security under the FOIA, Feb 24, 2004;  urlLink http://www.judicialwatch.org/archive/2004/homelandsecurity.pdf .  TheSt. Petersburg Times reported on Jun 9, 2004:  o "Two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, with most of the nation's air traffic still grounded, a small jet landed at Tampa International Airport, picked up three young Saudi men and left.&nbsp; The men, one of them thought to be a member of the Saudi royal family, were accompanied by a former FBI agent and a former Tampa police officer on the flight to Lexington, Ky. The Saudis then took another flight out of the country.”  o Moreover:&nbsp;“For nearly three years, White House, aviation and law enforcement officials have insisted the flight never took place and have denied published reports and widespread Internet speculation about its purpose… The terrorism panel, better known as the 9/11 Commission, said in April that it knew of six chartered flights with 142 people aboard, mostly Saudis, that left the United States between Sept. 14 and 24, 2001. But it has said nothing about the Tampa flight… The 9/11 Commission, which has said the flights out of the United States were handled appropriately by the FBI, appears concerned with the handling of the Tampa flight.  o&nbsp; "Most of the aircraft allowed to fly in U.S. airspace on Sept. 13 were empty airliners being ferried from the airports where they made quick landings on Sept. 11. The reopening of the airspace included paid charter flights, but not private, nonrevenue flights.”&nbsp; Jean Heller, “TIA now verifies flight of Saudis; The government has long denied that two days after the 9/11 attacks, the three were allowed to fly.”&nbsp; St. Petersburg Times, June 9, 2004   For more, visit  urlLink www.michaelmoore.com/warroon/f911notes   &nbsp;

      Well, summer has made its long overdue arrival in CNY.&nbsp; How can you tell, you ask?&nbsp; My computer fan is humming louder than Dave Jones at Lollapalooza.&nbsp; I'm Janasaless until Sunday, and it hasn't been all that bad.&nbsp; I saw I, Robot with Rood, Pabes, and Briggs last night, and it was actually a really good movie.&nbsp; Will Smith was kinda jacked too, with a really hot ass.&nbsp; The Marquee Theatre is something right out of Toy Story.&nbsp; Its F-ing HUGE! The seats are hella comfortable, and as I expected, the cupholders could hold a half gallon of milk.&nbsp;  I also got Aqua Teen Hunger Force Vol 2, possibly the best animated cartoon eva.&nbsp; Ja.&nbsp; My favorite character would probably be the Mooninites, or Carl.&nbsp; "She is a Chechnyan prostitute and you shall address her as such."&nbsp; "I do it fo' da' shorteez".&nbsp; Its something to watch during this seasonably warm weather, which means the weather is actually doing what its supposed to do, its SUMMER!!!  I got to play Age of Empires at work the other day, you forget how awesome that game is when you don't play it for 6 months.&nbsp; I'll probably borrow Prince of Persia from Urtz, if he ever gets his ass ova here and gives it to me!

      Before I get to poker, I got my AP scores...a miserable 3.&nbsp; I'm super pissed, because I knew I aced the fucking thing.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Alright, I have to say that poker night is one of my favorite nights.&nbsp; Better than Silent Night, or Fight Night.&nbsp; Or even Knight Rider.&nbsp; Texas Hold 'Em is so easy to play, but it is difficult to be really good.&nbsp; Vercz was the big winner last night, walking away with $43 and change, including a monster $30 pot and my only all-in of the night, $6.50 on a nut straight that was beat by a higher straight.&nbsp; I did manage to win once on pocket rockets, but it was only 90 cents, but hey, it beats the other two times I went all in and lost with them. Poker is a game of knowing your opponent, and knowing how to read their every move.&nbsp; The difficulty of playing with friends is that you can't read most of them.&nbsp; Marmet never bluffs, Alex rarely, Slop will sometimes, but he can't keep a straight face.&nbsp; Steve and Vercz are the hardest because they're so erratic.&nbsp; I try to mix up my play, including last night when I bluffed a couple of pots (or maybe I didn't, who knows?).&nbsp;  &nbsp; Aqua Teen Hunger Force is the best cartoon ever.&nbsp;  &nbsp; "If you don't have sex with your Tamagotchi at least once a week, it'll key your car"- Hal Sparks, I Love the '90s.&nbsp; Its weird watching the 90s on tv because I actually lived through the decade and can actually remember it.&nbsp; Mmm Bop feels like it was only one or two years ago, not 97!&nbsp; I feel old : ( &nbsp; Song of the Week: Save A Horse (Ride A Cowboy) - Big &amp; Rich &nbsp; Until next time..."Keep up da pace...gotta break 4:40" ToM

      Well, my scores are finally in for the ACT and the SAT.    ACT = ~31~ SAT = 1220  Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed with the SAT, but, considering I did no studying at all for the ACT, I'm pleasantly surprised.  I was complimented yesterday by Marty on my ACT score, and as far as I know, its the highest out of the half dozen or so who took the test (so far).   In other news, rumor has it that Mosher is thinking of firing me, Woody, and Marrone, so it looks like we'll have to start doing some work.  With the janitors.  Who should be working with Chelsea and Nicole, goddamnit, i hate them! Do your fucking job!  I've got my senior pictures tonight, that should be fun.  I really can't wait for the school year to start, with AP English and my internship.  Hopefully I got it with Boehlert, the only bad part about that is that he's a Republican.  Maybe a Communist intership would look good on a resumè.   Thats all for today, comrades, I have work to do  Song of the Week: The God That Failed, Metallica  I've decided to post a different quote, other than Homestar Runner, because I'm thinking of using it for my yearbook quote: "Life moves pretty fast.

      "Will you think differently if you're a ...Dirty White Boy?" "Well I think youre...Hot Blooded?" "It'll be hard to see with...Double Vision?" Just some quotes from Aqua Teen Hunger Force, possibly the best cartoon on television (I do it for the shorteez...- Meatwad). Hot Blooded has been stuck in my head since driver ed, when John brought it up. Anyway, the last day or two has been pretty messed up.  OK, you'll have to follow this a sec, its kinda confusing...on Saturday afternoon, Janasa's stepfather's stepbrother was killed by a drunk driver, he was the cop that was killed, you might have read about it in the paper.  I was actually at her house when it happened, and that is possibly the most awkward situation ever. I mean, not being part of the family when a tragedy like that happens, I just felt awful.  I probably won't see Janasa for the next couple of weeks, she has just too much going on, plus i'll be in Vermont the first week of August. Ahh...the family vacation.  One week of total mind-drubbing boredom...no television, no friends, stuck with my family.  At least I can drive.  Oh well, I'll just have to work on the ol' summer reading.  I'm almost done with Native Son, just C&P to go. Today in work we were at Fisher, and boy, that took me back.  Flashbacks of the Incredible Machine, science class, and all the other stuff that went on...and how completely worthless it all was.  I can't wait to graduate. Oh great, iTunes just messed up.  Thats just GREAT!!!  All Star game at the HOF tonight, should be a good time  Song of the Week: Dirty White Boy, Cold As Ice, Hot Blooded, Double Vision- FOREIGNER!!!

      Cripes! I haven't written in this for awhile.  On second thought, I have been quite busy, but lets get down to the nitty-gritty first.   Last week I saw Super Size Me, a documentary by comedien Morgan Spurlock documenting his 30 McDonald's McDiet.  This was potentially the third best documentary I have ever seen (after Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine).  Simply put: it was amazing to see the changes his body underwent.  After seeing the film, I now look at fat people and McDonalds in a whole new light.  I now resolve to never work at McDonalds again.  Not quit, since I havent worked since last September anyway, just go on a permanent hiatus.  I think its absolutely disgusting the food that I   used   to serve there.  The Big Mac, Double Quarter Pounder w/ cheese, Fish Filet, even the SALADS and parfaits have the same amount of fat as the Big Mac, which makes people that think they are eating healthy by getting a Crispy Chicken salad with two packages of Ranch dressing saladly ironic.   The film also showed the one exception to the "eat at McDonalds, you will gain weight" rule: Don Gorske.  Don, when the film was made, had just eaten his 19000th Big Mac since the mid-80s, and shall soon eat his 20,000th!!  The guy looks as skinny as me, with no health problems whatsoever, and he eats two BMs a day! Simply amazing, at least in my opinion.  I had a pretty fun 4th of July weekend, a bunch of grad parties, a couple i dont remember, Roman candles and manhunt at Woody's, and the house to myself...mwahahaha...  Janasa's birthday was Wed, i got her a John Mayer DVD, and while at B&N i picked up the Silmarillion, which I have to read when i'm done with summer reading. Dude, Wheres My Country? also came out in paperback ,so ive got a lot of reading to do this summer.  rock on!  Anywho, i have to make fun of Igor for supporting the Bush/Cheney platform, so i'm out like the gout.  I will leave you with a recent quote from our veep Dick Cheney:   "Go fuck yourself!"

      Hmmm...I'm sitting at my computer right now, thoughts storming through my head a la Snoopy at his typewriter, and all I can think of is nothing at all.  Well, I've returned home after the family vacation at Lake St.Catherine, Vermont.  Relatively uneventful, I did learn to play tennis (the actual game, I got the rules and all from Mario), got a decent tan for a dirty white boy, and met this one girl...unfortunately I didn't get her number or email, her name escapes me at the moment.  I went shopping in Manchester and got some clothes and some Under Armor, plus some rooster boxers.  Oh oh oh, I also got a 110 point word in Scrabble, "flathead", plus two doubleword scores, and I finished a picture puzzle by myself.  Yippee, how fun. I got home and was disappointed to find that no message was left about my car.  I did get an application for St. Lawrence University, which reminds me I have to work on my college resumè, which means make up some volunteer work.  I'm thinking about dropping SAT prep next year and forgoing my second SAT, my college counselor says I don't even need it anyway with my ACT score, plus I've got all the numbers I need for the colleges I want.  Now all I need is a major... On another sad note, Time Warner Cable has stopped carrying FSN and MSG, which means I no longer can watch the Knicks without a satillite beaming the signal directly from the Garden through middlemen in Siberia and Morocco.  Hopefully its just a scheme by TWC, but as of now , fuck them. I'm not going to mention anything else right now, just that I'm feeling great and looking forward to soccer, if we ever get a coach.  Until next time..." "Alright already, we'll all float on.  Don't you worry, we'll all float on. Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on.
