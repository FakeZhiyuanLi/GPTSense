      Still working to tie up all business matters. I feel lucky because I'm following behind people who have already gone through this process so I benefit from their experiences. So because of them I'll have everything I need to make the transition/life much easier.  Lining up things to do for my final day here in San Diego, the states. It sounds weird to say I'll be living outside of the states as I've never lived outside of California before. Traveled to many countries but never lived. I still think I should be able to handle the challenge no matter how many people say I'm crazy.  Still waiting for the gallery section of my site to be completed so I can start uploading all of our pics.

      Well this is day one of what will be an interesting journal of my experiences traveling aboard.  Got the website somewhat configured and setup this blogger account for everyone to keep track of my experiences.  By reading some of the other guys logs who are overseas it seems that this serves as both a therapeutic and time passing activity. I'm hoping this logging will sooth some of my anxiety and apprehension about partaking this contract.  These are my final days here in San Diego with my family and friends. Been running around like crazy trying to get paperwork, finances and personal items needed for this what seems unimaginable journey.  Saw most of my EDS pals today, probably for the final time. I'll miss those guys.

      Today felt like my first real personal day off, finally. No appointments, in processing or long briefings (although we had a short briefing at the end of the day, but it was not that big of a deal).  Woke up early, about 0700 after a short sleep night, which included talking on the phone with my sweetie and pounding out stuff on the computer. I first went to take a shower. This is something I haven’t touched on yet, the latrines. The latrines in our area are basically modified mobile homes with toilets, sinks, and showers. The smell isn’t too pleasing (not that it smells like poop) it just has a strange odor. I think, though, you eventually get use to it because the first time I smelled it didn’t want to breathe through my nose, but now it’s not a problem. This is different from trailer to trailer. Some are cleaner, some are flooded from the showers, some don’t have any toilet paper and some are but outright nasty. The Forrest Gump adage comes to mind here, you know, the “Box of Chocolates” reference. One final thing to note here, the pipe that supply these trailers with water are above ground and because of the heat there is no such thing as cold water (at this time of the year). You have two choices of water temperatures, either hot or really hot water. There’s nothing like taking a hot shower in 120-degree weather and getting out to get all sweaty and sticky again. I guess that’s life in the big desert.  After the shower I went over to the chow hall with the other amigos for breakfast. One thing I have to mention here, the Army has particular awesome tasting breakfast items. All the stuff I like to eat. Again, so much for losing weight.  During breakfast we met up with yet another nice ITT guy who came from Afghanistan. We of course drilled him, like we do with everyone, asking about everything from what’s the company like to how are conditions in Iraq. He was very helpful and answered pretty much all of our questions. One thing that made me think, after I’m on this contract for several months if I ever run into a new person it will seem funny if they start interrogating me with all kinds of questions. Like I would be some kind of expert.  I spent the rest of the morning uploading pics to our website. There’s an internet café here that allows you to connect your own system to their network for internet access. The bad thing is the bandwidth is slower than dial up, I think. It took 2 hours to upload about 50 pictures. At home, on the cable modem, that would take a fraction of the time. Well it’s not like I have a whole lot to do anyway.  After that I went over to the ITT office and accessed their computer to check up on accounts and send out emails. I met even more ITT guys who were all friendly. I really like this company. It’s supportive and organized. Most of the people I talk to usually have positive things to say about ITT, much like my last company, OSEC. I’m lucky to keep finding these good companies to work for and not some trashy company who could care less about its people.  I finished up the day with that short briefing from an Army Major about security and dinner at the chow hall. The dinner menu isn’t too great though, at least if you’re a vegetarian. I’ll probably be eating more dinner meals at the food court.  Not sure but I think this day might repeat itself for the next year.

      So I didn’t start my experiences in the Middle East the way I wanted. This stuff is minor but I got to tell the good with the bad.  Earlier I gave my two cents about the baggage detail. So we get off the plane and board buses to travel for an hour to Camp Doha. This is the main base for the military in this region. Troops & civilians filter in and out, to and from the theatre through this base. This base appears to have a lot of activity. Once at the base we, meaning military & civilians that were deployed from CRC this past week, were dropped off at this staging area. The staging area has two large white open-air tents side by side, one for the military and one for the civilians. When I say open air I mean there are walls on the sides just none on the front or back. One thing that was very noticeable was the heat. Inside those tents you knew you were in the Middle East. A coordinator who is in charge of the civilians meets with us and gives some briefings about what to do and where to go. He then starts handing people off to there point of contacts (POC). After handing everyone off there were us three from ITT and there was no one there to meets us. No biggie. The coordinator tells us to grab our belongings go to the other tent and wait as he will go and contact our POC. Well after about the second hour standing in this hot ass tent waiting for someone that looks like they’re never going to show up we ventured out on our own. After about an hour of search (which required us to bother several people) we found the office of this coordinator. Honestly a few minutes more in the heat and I would have passed out. Rocio didn’t look in too good either. Jim, well that guy seems to be part android because he’s so straightforward and emotionless to almost all situations. In fact I worry that, god forbid, his base was ever bombed he might not run, he’d stand and watch the show. But who knows (I’m kidding Jim in case you read this). It turns out that the coordinator dropped the ball and failed to contact our POC and left us hanging while everyone else left. Fortunately there was a happy ending. We talk with this other coordinator who was very nice and helpful. He promptly called our POC. Our POC (Mike Davis) picked us up and took us on our merry way. In their defense though, this process had just been change to this base where in the past it was handled on another base. So they’re still working out the communication between the offices. Just too bad we had to be the guinea pigs.  As I mentioned life here on this base seem busy. A lot of troops walking around, shopping and going here and there. One thing we’ve all noticed is that the many people we’ve encountered are good-hearted, helpful, considerate people. They happily exchange information about themselves or what life is like downrange. Before coming here, through other sources, I was led to believe that the military didn’t care about and even despised civilian contractor because of the pay we get. Maybe this attitude is different in the theatre, but so far I enjoy meeting these soldiers. Now that I’m here and I see a snippet of there life I can truly say, and not that I didn’t mean it before, but I truly have a new respect for these men & women here. They deserve a lot more credit and respect then we give them.  Our living conditions are somewhat similar to those at Fort Bliss. We are in an open bay inside a big warehouse like structure with bunk beds and wall lockers. Directly outside by the entrance to our bay are some tiki torches, so I call this place the Tiki Palace. There are many people here that kinda do there own thing in their own space. This also is the primary housing for ITT folks as we have talked with many of them, either coming in from the theatre or going out. They too seem friendly and helpful.  One thing I think I haven’t mentioned is the food. To my surprise Army food is pretty good. Of course I can’t eat everything but what I manage to find is mostly very tasty. And I’m talking about both of the bases I’ve been to, Fort Bliss and Camp Doha. On top of that, there’s the fast food court by the PX that has several chains; Subway, Pizza Inn (it’s like Pizza Hut), Baskin & Robins and Kentucky Fried Chicken to name a few. I’ve already eaten at Subway & Pizza Inn. So much for losing weight.  So I just continue on through the process waiting to see what happens next.

      Made it to the Middle East. It seems like everything is happening with the fast forward button pressed. From home to Kuwait it’s a blur but there were so many interest and not so interesting things that happened.  I’d like the start off with my first rant. Probably the first of many before it’s all said and done. We were scheduled to leave El Paso at 0130 on 10 July. Not a problem, a little early and particularly after a long day of briefings and meetings which some seemed irrelevant (because they were focused to the military), but O.K. I’m game. Well it got down to preparing our baggage for loading to trucks, which would be eventually loaded on the plane. The Army isn’t like the commercial airlines where you check your baggage in to a counter and the next time you see it, it’s coming to you from a conveyor belt. Nope the check in counter is the passengers (that’s us) and the conveyor belt is, yep you guessed it, us. So pretty much you can see where this is going they volunteer you to be a part of the baggage detail. At the time I thought cool because sometimes they compensate you for your hard work by letting you board the plane first. Which means you could potentially get a first class seat (which doesn’t mean a whole lot except for the extra space, as everyone on the plane gets the same food and service). I went into this detail with a gung ho attitude thinking the end result would be a nice comfortable, spacious plane ride to Kuwait. First we loaded the truck with the numerous duffle bags that were sprawled out over the parking lot. At 2200, which was a half hour earlier than anyone else, we left to the deployment terminal to load baggage to the airplane. Again I put my efforts into the task probably tossing around about 300 pieces of baggage. After that we went back to the terminal for a few more briefings and pep talks and they started calling out names to board the aircraft. As I sat and they called out names one by one I started to get concerned that none of the baggage detailed was called out. They went through the whole list of people and left baggage detail for the very ended. Yours truly was the last person to board. I still was unsure about seating until I got to the plane thinking that maybe they had some special seating for us. Wrong! They basically threw us in with every one else that had boarded the plane ahead of us who already got all the good seats (i.e. their own row to spread out and sleep or a window seat). I got an isle seat next to some guy for the whole flight. I already mentioned that the day had been long which started at 0600 and we were staring at a 21-hour flight. So if not first class, comfort would have been nice but as I was looking around at the guys around me (who were not on the detail) spread out over three & four seats I couldn’t help to think which a CHICKEN SHIT deal I was handed. I was basically had to sleep vertically which sucks. I was so pissed the whole flight that it was difficult to sleep just for that reason. But you know me, I’m not the one to make a fuss and get emotional. The bad thing about this detail is once you’re on it, you’re on it from start to finish (no rotation of other people). So I’d be damned if I was going to unload anyone’s bag from any plane. And so just that, after we landed they called out for the baggage detail and I sat quietly and debarked the plane with every else. I guess no one had a list of who was suppose to be on the detail because nothing was said or done by my absence. To no avail, stepping off the plane into Kuwait was memorable be even more so was the 98 degree temperature at 0730 that was an eye opener. All I know is I didn’t feel bad as those guys hauled all those 300 plus bags out of the plane into the awaiting truck. I watched them do it from the comfort of a nice cool air-conditioned bus. Ha ha ha. I got your baggage detail for you.

      So meet the crew (a.k.a The Three Amigos). We were the only three ITT Industries employees in CRC processing this past week. Before we left we were told that 8 people were coming next week. Personally even though we were running around like ants on hot cement I’m glad we had a smaller group. It helped up to bond easier and quicker.  First there’s Rocio (that’s Rose-e-o). She the adventurous explorer of our group. She’s been everywhere from the Brazilian rain forest to dog sledding in Scandinavia. And she takes these trips on her own. We also call her the Spicy Latin lady as so is very independent and knows what she wants out of life. Single guys she’s a great catch if you can get her down in one spot for any length of time. I think she’ll do well on this project and in the Middle East, as she is a very personal and friendly person. I’ve actually known Rocio for over a year now as she sat a couple of rows over from desk at my last project I worked in San Diego. It’s very reassuring to take this assignment when you are with a friend. I hope we actually stay together when we get deployed into the theatre. We help each other out a lot for support, as it would be very stressfully otherwise. I say this now before I’m actually deployed but I hope I can continue to say it the duration of this assignment.  Next there’s Jim. He’s the experienced, calm military guy who reassures us that everything is fine. I like Jim because he’s a go with the flow kind of person, much like myself. He’s not opinionated or self absorbed which is perfect for our group dynamics. He’s from Panama City, Florida and has a very pretty daughter who is half Haitian. I’m still getting to know Jim but I’m sure if we stay together we’ll be good friends throughout our stay.  Then there’s me. Well you know me. I just look to meet learn about people and their lives (sometimes no matter how kooky they are, and trust me there are some real winners out there). I think if there is one thing if more than any other thing (of coarse besides the financial reward) is that I get to live in another country and truly deal with and work with different people. This was actually something I wanted to experience when I was in the service but I unfortunately ended up back where I grew up.  So this is our ITT crew. If I don’t stay with these guys I’ll never forget the time we had where it all started for us at CRC.

      O.K. everybody. Just got done with a whirlwind of in processing. This last week came and went in the blink of an eye. As I’m sitting here on the plane headed to Kuwait, I’m thinking to myself “did last week even happen?”  So let me break it down for you. First of all this was a weird week for CRC (Conus Replacement Center). CRC is where all civilians and military process to go to the Middle East. Normal processing is done in a 6 days time frame, but because of the 4th of July holiday we were short one day. Processing even on a 6-day schedule is tough but to crunch it down to 5 is somewhat insane (especially for civilians).  CRC gives you a battery of testing (medical & dental) and training (i.e. first aid, nuclear, biological and chemical and a host of others) in order to prepare you for the theatre. For military it’s not too bad as majority of them have much of this testing done prior to processing. For the civilians it’s a little different. If you don’t have some the medical or if you have dental problems you have to make arrangements yourself to take care of any these issues. Fortunately for us, ITT employees, we have a liaison that know his, excuse my language, S#%T (you can fill in the blanks). He helped us every step of the way. I call him our guardian angel, his name is Don. If it were not for him we would have been lost and stuck at Fort Bliss for another week. Not that that’s a bad thing but you see some of the guys that get left back for a week and they look like lost souls without a purpose. They don’t have to do anything but clear up their issues and wait for the next plane out which is once a week. The bottom line is you want to be validated at the end of the week for deployment to the Middle East.  So except for our first day there, which was the 4th, everyday began at O’dark something. Meaning we were up and on the move to some appointment before the sun came up. I didn’t have too much of a problem with this as I know this is the military way. What makes it crazy is we were mostly on the go all day nonstop until the sun was about to set. The medical and dental appointments weren’t bad but trying to sit through briefings (particularly when the instructor were like Ben Stein) made the challenge of staying in this reality ever so difficult. A couple of times I felt like just getting up from the briefing and going back to the dorm to sleep.  Then there’s the immunization shots. Not very fun but not as bad as I thought. The anthrax and typhoid shots were the most painful later on (about three days). The smallpox vaccine didn’t hurt but was irritating. So picture this, one arm felt as though your big brother gave you a charlie horse everyday and the other felt like you wanted to scratch it off. Quite a yen & yang effect going on there. But you think that all this stuff in the long run will save your life so you do it without hesitation or regret.  So to sum it all up we had very limited time to ourselves. I spent some of that time either calling my sweetie (I love you) or going to the PX (Post Exchange) getting last minute item because some guy who was just over there said you can’t leave without it or life will cease to exist because you’ll be so miserable. I don’t think it’s that extreme but I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry and the suckers we were we usually fell for most of those stories.

      Well I can understand why nobody has any log entries around their departure date. So much going on, so much to think about and so many emotions. This is by far to this point the most challenging part of this trip. Separating from my family. Inara and I have been apart before but this will definitely take our relationship to the limit. I guess the old adage applies here “the longer the wait the sweeter the wine”.  So after several days of visits, dinners and entertainment here I am writing my first log entry, after leaving San Diego, on the plane at 30,000 feet over who knows where headed toward El Paso, Texas...yeeee hawww! One note here; we never left the airport (meaning went outside) when we landed and changed planes in Phoenix but just the little temperature we were exposed to made me think about scorching heat that lays in front of me. I looked at the weather forecast and saw El Paso is no oasis but compared to the Middle East it probably might as well be one.  The day has come to a close and I’m here at the CRC dormitory. Didn’t stay at the Fort Bliss Inn as I originally intended. It was suggested that life would be so much easier to stay in the dorm. Plus I’ll be saving $$$.  Accommodation aren’t as bad as I was led to believe. The only things I need to note here is that the common areas could use a little clean up (i.e. garbage cans overflowing, trash on the tables and the disrepair of the furniture). The other is, and Sweetie I know you won’t like this, the occasional cockroach scampering across the floor. But I think it’ll be manageable for a week or so.  I miss my wife so much but I know that this is a big opportunity we both need. After this we will have such a have such a wonderful time together, it will be fantastic. I’ll see you in my dreams sweetie.

      Here I am, day 1 in Iraq. The feeling was exciting and scary at the same time. To be in this war torn land that to that point I've only seen on TV is somewhat strange.  Surprisingly I slept well on that army cot, probably because I was exhausted from the waiting around and travel. But I still woke up at the crack of dawn in preparation of traveling to Camp Victory which is across from BIAP. Looking back it wasn't that big of a deal but being new to the country and not knowing what to expect was a scary thought.  I tried calling my contacts first thing that morning but I got no answers from any of the phone numbers. Fortunately I hooked up with a couple of army guys that had a bus headed to Victory. They were nice enough to take me to KBR billeting which is where people who are in transit stay. The whole bus ride over all I kept thinking about was the briefing we had at CRC about IEDs (Improved Explosive Devices). I don't remember a time when I rode in a vehicle that I was so concerned with every bump in the road, piece of trash on the side and vehicles we passed. But it’s only a short road that you have to drive before you get to Camp Victory and all the concerns are very short lived once you make it to the base.  Camp Victory is a huge base that is primarily the grounds that use to be Saddam Hussein’s Presidential Palace. It was so strange to drive around and see all these buildings that were not to long ago occupied by Saddam's regime. The base is split into two, a north and a south. Most of the palace is located in Victory South.  I make it to KBR billeting and they assign me to the transit tent. Low and behold that same army cot awaits me for my bed. I think it's following me across the country. The one difference is I found an unused cushion to make it somewhat more comfortable then to prior two cots. My 4 days at Victory were not bad. I spent my time going to MWR for the internet, eating at the DFAC (dining facility), shopping at the PX and calling around to arrange travel to Babylon. My first day I managed to hook up with Keith Young, a former coworker of mine who basically convinced me to come here. He kept telling me there isn't too much to worry about on the bases and as long as you stay on base it’s not as bad as what you see on the news. He got a $500 bonus for referring me to ITT. Sadly I didn't get a chance to go into the palace liked I wanted but it was satisfying just the same to see it in person from the outside.  It pays to do things for yourself. When I was told I would be assigned to Camp Babylon they told me my travel would be from Doha to Baghdad by C130 aircraft and from Camp Victory to Babylon by military convoy. I was not looking forward to this at all. I don't want to be on anybodies convoy in this country. When I mentioned this to a few people someone came back and said why don't you fly down there. At that point I immediately started calling around to find out who flies to Babylon. Well luckily I got in contact with of a National Guard Air Unit that flies Blackhawk Helicopter. They have missions regularly to and from Victory and Babylon. I called daily for space a (space available) and I lucked out and got a flight to Babylon by Blackhawk helo. So this promptly ended my 4 days in Baghdad.

      My last log entry I wrote from Kuwait which was interestingly my last day in Kuwait. Everything happened so quickly, as I explained in previous logs, since I left San Diego. Actually my processes were nothing like what some other ITT people experienced that came before me. Apparently they had extensive delays in Kuwait, some 2 to 3 months and others never even went anywhere. Well I guess since then ITT has gotten their act together and decided no more letting people sit around and do nothing (darn, I wouldn't have complained if I got a paycheck to do nothing). They whiz you off to your assigned site in the blink of an eye. I was in Kuwait for a total of 4 days. Actually that was disappointing as I would have liked to have gone into Kuwait City to see the sites and possible visit some familiar faces, former co-workers. Maybe on the way back. So I left Kuwait that day (same as my last posting).  A couple of log entries ago I had a rant about my flight from the states to Kuwait. Well let the ranting continue.  To this point my flight experiences have not been champagne and caviar. The day of my last log which was about 1400, I go back to our bay and our ITT representative meets us there to take us to get manifested on a flight to go to Iraq. This is a large bay where people assemble and wait for flights to take them to their destinations. In this bay they have cots setup (the old fashion army cots that fold out) for people waiting for the next available flight. When we arrive we find out that there is a flight leaving to Baghdad at 1830 and by this time it was 1430. So with only a couple of hours notice we go back to our bay where we stayed and I basically cram all my stuff in my duffle bags and head off to the bay to await my flight. I was a little irritated being that I would have liked to have comfortably organize and put my belongings into the duffle bag so nothing gets damaged or destroyed. But this is why they pay us the big bucks, I guess. So I sit and wait at the bay and when 1830 comes they do a roll call and call out the people who get to go on the flight. Of course yours truly wasn't called on the roll call, strike one. The next flight and roll call to Baghdad happened at 0700. That roll call happens again without yours truly.  In the meantime my fellow companions Rocio & James had a flight leaving to their base at 0200 the following morning. They got to sleep then casually bring over their belongings to the bay. Roll call was announced their names were called and they boarded the bus to go to the plane without any wait or inconvenience. So as I'm sitting in the bay on this uncomfortable cot I'm thinking I hope things get better when I get to Babylon.  Finally after about 24hrs (1 day) 1600 they call my name to board the bus. We drive to the airport only to do a typical military "hurry up and wait" procedure. I think our plane landed around 2000. We board the C130 to fly north to Baghdad.  It was a very nice flight coming north. I was relieved I wasn't assigned to any baggage detail. We flew up on a C130 and if you've never flew on a military aircraft it's completely unlike a commercial airline most notably there are only a few windows (a couple in the forward section and a couple in the aft section with none in between). But I did manage to look out and see Iraq. There was a lot of sand. Sadly we landed at BIAP (Baghdad International Airport) at about 2200, completely dark out. The reason this is a problem is because when I call the ITT contacts to let them know I have arrived they tell me they can't pick me up at night as it's not safe to drive at night. So once again I spend the night on an uncomfortable army cot. One thing to point out here, we arrived a few hours before a large army unit that flying out came to the airport. The tent that is setup for people waiting for flights only has a few cots. My luck changed that night as I was lucky to have one of those uncomfortable army cots vs. a chair or worse, the floor. So I slept it out until the morning.

      Alright so I'm sure everyone is wondering by now "where the heck is he!" Well before I explain why I haven't been updating my where about on this assignment I'd like to say that it was me who made the decision to take on this project. There was only one other person who I consulted for support (thank you sweetie) but ultimately as a husband, father & man it was my decision to take this contract and so far I have no regrets. Whatever ultimately happens good or bad nobody should feel responsible or remorseful for this decision. The reason why I say this is there has been some people who have been critical and negative to me and my decision for coming to this area of the world and have given me grief for being here. I only want to say to those people if you can't support my decision then please just leave me alone and don't contact me. I have chosen to take this risky assignment and it's me here risking my safety for this opportunity and the last thing I need to hear is about your objections to my decision. At this point in time I only want to hear from people who are going to be positive and support me and my decisions. If you want to give me a hard time, do it when I come home.  OK, with that off my chest I like to tell everyone that I'm fine and comfortable in the ancient city of Babylon, Iraq. I arrived here about two weeks ago and I'm truly in awe that I get to eat, sleep and live in the oldest city in the world. The base that I was assigned literally encircles the ruins of the old city (which is still there although parts of it are a replica) and my trailer (my home while I'm here) probably rests on some ancient building or artifact. But before I go into my life here let me tell you about and explain my trip that got me here, which is just as interesting.
