        Bevan Lynch [ARC FX]   Interviewed by THE SURFACE - 25 October 2003         The Surface speaks to Bevan Lynch, one half of the dynamic duo that makes up ARC FX: a special effects company based in Brisbane that supplies digital and practical special effects for film and television locally and internationally.  ARC FX started up in 2002. Their first feature film was the Aussie horror comedy UNDEAD. "We did 2 major digital creature FX sequences and all of the prosthetic zombie make-ups and gore FX."  For Bevan, the perks of the job are not the free tickets to big film premieres, but the "creative satisfaction, and the excitement of being a part of something that is constantly changing.   "I'm from a digital background, and the best thing about digital special effects is that it draws on so many different skill sets: sculpture, painting, physics, mathematics, performance art, cinematography and graphic design."  The work can be pretty challenging to the ego sometimes, and "because it's an art form, there are always creative sacrifices that have to be made when the time or money budgets you want aren't available."  When asked what the most rewarding and challenging aspects of his job are, Bevan replies: "The most rewarding thing is the look on people's faces when you exceed their expectations. They get excited and that's a great feeling. The most challenging would be making it all happen. Balancing the time, money, human resources and creative aspects of any job is a very delicate thing; everyone has different ideas about which is the most important, and its not possible to please everyone all of the time."  Bevan has been working in this industry for about 4-5 years. He has worked all over Queensland and also freelanced around Sydney, before starting ARC FX. His dedication to his work and building up his company leaves little free time. "The line is a bit blurry at the moment because we're pretty busy, but I try and make sure I get a healthy amount of exercise and some guitar practice squeezed into the day. I also think it's really important to go on holiday regularly... to somewhere you've never been, to expand your world.  His creative inspiration is drawn from clouds. "When I realised how time consuming and technically challenging it is to replicate nature in the computer, I really started to respect the universe for its real-time, fractal beauty."  Bevan's not too sure about where he sees himself in five years' time, but "I'd like to think that the company will be doing really well, and that the blurry line between work and play will solidify a little."  Bevan's advice for aspiring Digital Visual FX Artists?  Learn how to communicate with people effectively, let go of your ego and have fun.

       So we don't lose the work already featured on The Surface website due to the move to a blog site, we're going to feature them again periodically. In a segment called, unoriginally, "From the Archives" we'll post an interview, an artwork or review once a week. Hopefully this will give greater visability to those artists already featured as well as encourage new submissions.

       As we are still taking creative submissions of all genres, it's probably a good idea to post submission guidelines again, especially as they've changed slightly.

We will also review and link to websites that provide information and services to emerging artists.

E-zines may be submitted in PDF format, but please zip the file prior to sending. Alternatively, if already available online, send the URL of the download page.   Images:  Photos and scanned artwork must be web-ready (72dpi). Note: Images may be resized as required. Large files should be  zipped prior to sending by email.   Multimedia:  For submissions of any movie  files, games, music files, or animations, please email the URL and a screenshot.

       You may have noticed the severe lack of updates over the past few months. This is mostly because I've been flat-out with work and also working on  urlLink lip  a lot more. Since I've taken on the position of Managing Editor, I do a bit of everything, so there hasn't been a lot of time for work on The Surface site.  Also, the lack of submissions from people have not left me very motivated to do much with the site. So I've decided to turn this into a blog. It'll still serve the same purpose as the website, but being a lot easier to update, hopefully I'll do it more often.  I hope you all like the new format, and I hope it will encourage you all to participate more through posting comments and  urlLink emailing  through submissions.

       on this road the skid marks scream black on black broken dreams like the glass shattered   on this road blood spilled like milk pain is metal pins forced through bruised and broken flesh   legs that won't move on their own       revenge is not enough watch your back on this road

      This week has been a complete write-off. I've done nothing productive, just fart-arsed around, surfing the net and trying to make it look like I'm working. Writing umpteen menial jobs on my white board to make it look like I'm busy, and periodically rubbing them off to make it look like I'm working hard and getting heaps done. Usually I like my job but, for some reason, this week I'm just not interested. Maybe because I have so much to do outside of work and the procrastinating and making excuses has left me exhausted from stressing about all the procrastinating and making excuses.  I've become totally addicted to reading other people's blogs, so rather than feel like a total voyeur I'm starting my own. Read it, or don't. I'm going to open a bottle of wine, sit back and care about it some other time.
