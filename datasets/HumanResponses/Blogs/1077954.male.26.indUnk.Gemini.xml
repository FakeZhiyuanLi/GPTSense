      Football Fan's!! I went out to dinner with my family tonight. My cousins were in town so me, my mom & dad, my grandmother, & my aunt & uncle went out for Chinese at a great buffet place, & came home went to NFL.com to find out the Tampa Bay BUCS are the NFC Champions. Congrats to the BUCS!!!! I then turned on the Titians Vs. Raiders game to see the Titians were holding there own only down buy 3 point in the 3rd quarter, but the Raiders were the stronger team and prevailed, and the Oakland Raiders are the AFC Champions. Congrats to the Raiders!!!!  Super bowl XXXVII will be a good one!!!!!

      I took the  urlLink Dirty Mind test  !!!  my score was 80    This probably isn't much of a shocker, but you've got a one-track mind! Either your hormones have taken over your brain or you're feeling deprived in some way, because s-e-x is the first thing that pops into your mind on almost any occasion. This may or may not be a problem, depending on the point to which your fantasizing takes over your mental processes - thinking about getting it on is a vital part of any healthy sex drive, but it can bring trouble when it's too extreme. As long as you are still able to shut off that part of your brain when need be (while working, for example), there's no cause for concern.

      Football Fans!!!!  -  Well the 2002 NFL season is officially over, and was caped off with a blowout victory buy the AFC in the Pro Bowl.  Final Score: AFC - 45 NFC - 20  Miami Dolphin Ricky Williams was the MVP of the game which made me happy since i am a devoted Fins fan.  Jason Taylor, Zach Thomas, and Sam Madison also had a great game.   Augest isn't close enought.  the highlight of the game other then Ricky being MVP was Colts QB Payton Manning Calling his kicker an Idiot for comments he made about Payton. funny stuff.

        RANT!!!!   -  All this talk about not going back into space is ridiculous. It is a tragic thing that happened on Saturday, but the Astronauts that risked there lives to explore space wouldn’t want us to abandon the program because they lost there lives.  Exploring space is like exploring the depths of the ocean. Many have died exploring the ocean, but that doesn’t mean we still don’t have submarines.   If you ask me the lose of 14 astronauts, and 2 shuttles in a 22 year period isn’t that bad of a number, yes it’s sad 7 astronauts lost there life in 1986 when challenger exploded on lift off, and it’s just as sad that 7 astronauts lost there life in Columbia on reentry, but those are the risks and the brave men and women that have that opportunity knew that before lift off and during reentry.  my thought are with the families that lost loved ones on Febuary 1, 2003

        Rant!!!   -   Ever have one of those set backs in your life, where no matter what happened the outlook looked grim, what i am talking about is being unemployed. I mean no matter how many resumes i send out for a job that i know i can do, the response is, " sorry we're looking for someone w/ a little more experience ", or " we decide to go with someone else ". I have 3+ years experience building & repairing computers, and setting up networks, and can tackle most problems and resolve them. I am not looking to become the admin of a server datacentre (at least not tomorrow). I just want the opportunity that i deserve, and to top it off   UNEMPLOYMENT SUCKS!!!!!

      Computers -   Tonight I had to reinstall windows on my laptop, the reason I had to reinstall windows was because Partition Magic 8, wouldn't allow me to resize my current partition.  It's a 30GB HD and I wanted to dual boot windows with mandrake 9.1.   The way I partitioned the drive:  Total size 27.94GB (30GB) 9.75GB - Windows XP Pro 9.75GB - Storage 8.40GB - Mandrake 9.1  I finally decided to just wipe the 1 week old install from when i had to wipe the drive to recover some bad sectors.  I had two drives that had that issue in the last two weeks.  The first one was one of my WD 100GB drives, but i wasn't two surprised since the drive had the original format from when i bought it, and i had written & deleted files on it since the drive was bought.  The Second was the 30GB Laptop drive, and I glad to say both are working.

        Computers   -  Last week i was about one BOSD away from throwing my PC across the room & going into debt, and buying a G4.   Thank god for Red Hat 8 & the Winblows XP(eXtra Pain) repair utility which helped me get all my important files(MP3's) off my HD just incase i was going to reformat the HD, &  then the kicker after i did all that, Xplay decided to clear out the  itunes.db  file on my ipod, & i was forced to restore the ipod to factory settings and resync the songs.   I wish steve jobs would come to the realization that porting OS X to the Intel & AMD Platform would be a good thing.

      It was my lucky day -   Today I was curising along up US-1 on my way to a client and I wasn't paying attention to the the Speed-o-meter, and a cop stepped out in front of my truck and motioned to me to pull over, so i did, and he then asked me if i knew the speed limt and i responded to him buy saying is it 50 or 45, he said it's 45 and i clocked you at 55 he said "Slow it down" and he let me on my way with a warning.    I lucked out. if it was the interstate or near my town, i would have gotton a nice fat ticket.

      Stupid Copy Protection!!!!!  ok i bought a new CD yesterday Nickelback's The Long Road, and of course i brought it home popped it in the CD drive and ripped it to mp3 to put on my ipod, then i decided before I went to sleep to burn a copy to keep in the car, and put the original back in the sleeve and went to bed. This morning i got in my truck placed the cd in the head unit and all the tracks were popping and hissing. Now here is the part that pissed me off all the mp3's I ripped sound great no popping or hissing. unless it's my burner I think the copy protection is a little backwards, I can rip files to my HD but I can't make a copy of the disc to preserve the life of the intellectual property I paid my hard earned money for.  The reason I think it is copy protection is I copied the new Fuel CD Natural Selection, and it sounds like the original.  Right now I am trying to copy the disc w/ xcdrost in Redhat 9.

      WiFi card for Linux on laptop....   I finally found a wifi card that works with my laptop, the  urlLink   Netgear MA401   , I had one where i work that we use to get laptops on the internet to do updates and stuff when they don't have a NIC card, a USB port(for a usb nic), an O/B ethernet port, or when we don't have an open cat5 cable to plug the laptop to. So I tried it, & what da you know it worked. So i went to compusa after work and spent more money....being a geek is so expensive.   I am just happy I can use linux on my lappy w/ my wireless network.

      My new iPod!!!!!  I have pondered over it long enough, and since they released itunes for windows, I decided to get the new docking ipod.   unopened    Just out of the box     In it's dock    In the dock next to the 2nd Gen    I will admit i wasn't a big fan of the 3g ipod till i went to the apple store to look around(guys windows shopping), and actually held it, and i then pondered over it and walked in to the apple store Saturday and bought one. Now i just need a case.

       Hell has froze over!!!!    The reason i say this is i did something i thought i would never do, and i bought a DELL. Granted it's a Laptop, but it's still a DELL.  Now i think i got an awsome deal on it, i paid $1000 for a:     Inspiron 5100 2.4Ghz P4 Intel 845G Mobo 256 PC2100 DDR ATI Readon 7500 16MB(on the small side but it's enought) 40GB HD CDRW 15" LCD Windows XP Home(which quickly became Professional)  I have only had it for 3 days now, and it's seem to be solid, hasn't crashed yet The Main reason i bought it was the 1394, & the CDRW.  One thing i saw which i haven't been able to confirm is, i saw it had USB 2.0 which would be awsome since i just bought a new docking ipod and the USB 2.0/Firewire cable for it.  It's biggest test will be in 3 weeks when i travel to VA to vist my brother, i will be on airplanes for a while, so i will need something to do, and from the looks of the spec on this lappy it will beable to handle some of my fav games.  I will let everyone know how this new purchase turns out.
