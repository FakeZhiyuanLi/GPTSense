      Finally the week is over. This is good and bad. Good cuz it's  urlLink party time , bad cuz next week when I get back to work, there'll only be me and Max left from the bunch graduate students that used to hang out. All the others have finished theirinternships already. It sucks and I'm getting relly fed up of working.  Earlier this week I bumped into an Irish girl I know at  urlLink l'Escalier , a popular after hours bar, and since I kinda fancy her I asked if she'd like to go out. She said "yes" and gave me her (irish) number. Thing is I don't know if it's worth it. I'm only here for another month and that's short for a relationship to get going. On the other hand, she might be open to  urlLink casual sex ?   Fat chance!  But I'll probably send her a message and we'll see what happens after that. Have great fkin weekend!  urlLink Enjoy! !

Bob Dylan would probably not have approved of having a web site anyways.

        urlLink Blekinge, SWEDEN &nbsp;- A 18-year old girl in&nbsp;a small town in the south of Sweden has&nbsp;found a video camera hidden in a vent in the bathroom of her appartment.&nbsp;When following the cables&nbsp;she&nbsp;discovered a television set, a video recorder and several video cassettes&nbsp;in an abandoned storage space&nbsp;in&nbsp;the basement. As far as she knows, the camera&nbsp;might have been there since she moved in this May. That's yuckie, cuz i think we all know what the perv was doing while watching those recordings...

      So what do I do now? I don't really know. I know what I'm doing at the moment, but that doesn't really help me much. I'm currently working for IBM France&nbsp;in Nice on the French Riviera. Working might not be the right word though, I'm actually doing an internship for my master thesis. With some luck I'm graduating from  urlLink Ecole des Mines  in September.&nbsp;   I've only got 2 weeks left, and they fkin dumpt a shitload of work on me today, so I decided to blog. Vengeance with a twist.

      Tomorrow is my last day as a trainee at IBM in La Gaude. This means I'll have to turn in the beautiful laptop that has been my companion for the last 6 months. It also means it'll soon be time for me to leave the French Riviera. It sucks. I just know it's gonna rain when I get back home. But on the other hand, it's gonna be great being back in Sweden after 2 years in France. I didn't think I'd miss it, but I do.  This weekend I heading up to Paris for a weekend reunion with some of friends from the  urlLink Esstin  Engineering School. I've known these guys since I was a  Godfather  for one of them(Guillaume) when they were  urlLink Erasmus  students at my  urlLink uni . We haven't seen each other since we all started our internships in February, so this is the last get-together before graduation. We're gonna stay  Chez Remy  cuz his parents are away for vacation leaving us their suburban house.  We're gonnna party like it's 1999 .  Next week my sister is coming over and we're gonna spend 6 days enjoying the good life: sunny beaches, rowdy bars and hip clubs. I'll have to watch her closely though, cuz young blonde Swedish girls are a favourite pray for the don juans of southern France (Hey, she's my baby sister and only 20 years old) . This will be my first vacation since last august and I wish it would last a little bit longer, but I have to finish school.  And yeah, It'll be a while before my next blog, since I won't have access to a computer before I get back to Sweden. And it might take me a while since I'm driving the 2000 km in my  red  Renault Clio. Wish me luck.    Hold on, Stay Strong!

        Tonight starting 22.00 GMT you can see the peak of a dazzling show of shooting stars called the  Perseids . You might see as much as a 100 meteors per hour! Its actually a shower of debris from the  urlLink Swift Tuttle  asteroid. Apparently, conditions are particularly good this year. So kids, what are you waiting for?  Observing prospects and instructions:  urlLink France   urlLink UK   urlLink North America

      Early last week I got a surprise visit from my cousin and her husband. This was the first time I saw them since their wedding in May. She called me up on Sunday and asked if they could come. During the week I didn't get to see them that much since I was working till 6 almost every day, but we still went out for drinks on a couple of occations and I showed them my favorite hang-outs  urlLink Thor  and  urlLink Waynes . So come the weekend we decided to head down to  urlLink Juan-les-Pins  . We took the train, cuz I had been out with friends (my cousin+husband were tired) the night before to a rock club called Subway and didn't feel like driving.  We spent the whole day basking in the sun on the very busy beach in Juan. It's important to mention that it's the first decent sand beach between Nice and Cannes, that's why it's always packed. There's not a m² that's not occupied. I still prefer it to the beach in Nice. Early in the evening we walked up to Antibes, which is only 15 minutes away, and looked around the old town. After a refreshing cold Kronenbourg  urlLink 1664  we took the train further down the coast to the glamorous city of  urlLink Cannes .    As we were getting kind of hungry, we took a short stroll by the  urlLink Palais du Festival  and the Croisette before finding a restaurant. We had pizza at this Italian place. It was excellent. I would probably have chosen something else if I had been alone but, hey, pizza is good (if not very original). At ten we had finished our dinner, and we went back to the Croisette to watch the French entry in the International Fireworks Festival that's on in august. Fireworks are a great way to end an evening, and these were particularly good. They used lots of color, and finished off all in Gold.  Sunday morning we got up kinda late, and after breakfast we took my car to go on a road trip for the day. We headed eastwards along the coast to visit the peninsula of  urlLink Saint Jean Cap Ferrat , witch is beautifully situated between Nice and Monaco. The area is full of villas and luxurious palaces, some with their own private beaches carefully hidden from view by huge garden walls.     We parked our car in St. Jean town, on the eastern side, and after refreshing ourselves at a local bistro we walk to the nearby Paloma Beach. The setting is beautiful, with a view over  urlLink Villefranche  on the otherside of the bay, and the water crystal clear. In afternoon we picnicked on the beach  At 5 we decided to explore the rest of the peninsula, but it's wasn't easy fining your way in the narrow streets. We finally found the main road and headed towards Cap Ferrat, the southernmost point of the presque-île. On the western side the coast is rougher and the cliffs go straight out into the sea. We just couldn't resist the dark blue water, so we found a path winding it's way down through the rocks and dived in. If possible the water was even clearer on this side. The rocks went straight down to at least 20 meters, but there was some shallower parts a hundred meters out. I swam there with my cousin's husband and there was lots of coral and algae, and I wish I had had a mask and fins. The place was really calm and as the sun started it's descent the scenery seemed almost magic.

      So I tried this  urlLink site  where they tell you what job you were made for that  urlLink Body Glitter  tipped me about. Turns out I should have been a Rally Car Driver or playing a football for Aberdeen. Guess education was wasted on me for nothing.

       urlLink Illegal Art  proposes free visuals, audios and videos on the fringes of intellectual property law. Especially interesting is  urlLink the Grey Album  by  urlLink DJ Danger Mouse  - a mix of  urlLink Jay-Z 's Black Album and the Beatles White Album - and the movie  urlLink Spin , documenting satellite feeds from the 1992 american presidential election campaign that shows what happened off air.  Should Art be Free? Oh yes... stick it to them.

      I only wrote the previous entry because I yesterday when I was driving home, I turned on Kiss FM and they played  urlLink Bros   I owe you nothing  and I realized there where good things about the 80's. After that It sort of got out of hand. Sorry.  If you're thinking about having an 80's themed Sing-a-Long Party,  urlLink Ultimate 80's songs  have got the lyrics.

        I you haven't noticed that the 80's are back again (again) then you're probably not very  urlLink perspicacious . Have you bought a  urlLink sweatband  in the last 6 months? Then you're a victim too. Also check out  urlLink Lindsey Lohan 's jeans shorts, the new  urlLink pink  Victoria's Secret line and the oh so popular  urlLink Louis Vuitton bag . I'm just waiting for the  urlLink leg warmers  to come out in stores this fall.  I remember those days in a golden haze of  urlLink hairspray . Being  urlLink young  in the the decade of  urlLink yuppies  was great; life prospects were good and we would all live the american dream. We all know how that worked out.  urlLink Not at all .  Still, the 80's have an appeal even today. Things seemed so easy at the time and the oil was flowing abundantly from  urlLink Dallas . So if you want escape from our terrorist laden reality, I suggest you go to your local video store and get  urlLink Ferris Bueller's Day Off . It's a real classic by director  urlLink John Hughes  who also made masterpieces  urlLink Weird Science ,  urlLink The Breakfast Club  and  urlLink Sixteen Candles .  Check out  urlLink fast-rewind  for tips on other movies from the decade of bad taste.

        Limp Bizkit singer  urlLink Fred Durst  has his own web log where he publishes his thoughts on the state of the (american) nation and other important issues. I wanted to leave a message, but you have to be a member of  urlLink xanga  to do that.  I'm not a fan, even though I appreciated their cover of  urlLink the Who 's  urlLink Behind Blue Eyes , but I do enjoy seeing rock'n'roll singers crouching in baby swimming pools and posting kitchy images of themselves. The picture above was taken in the  urlLink Rijksmuseum  in Amsterdam and Fred  broke the rules  to pose next to Rembrandt's  urlLink the Nightwatch . I've been there and there's big signs telling you that all photography is forbidden to protect the fragile paintings (and the copyright on the expensive reproductions the sell at the museum store). But I guess was just a chicken not getting a photo of my own.

        According to the  urlLink NY Times  the retired hip hop giant Jay-Z has been offered to take over  urlLink Def Jam  after the former record company president departed. Apparently this is part of a plan by ISLAND chairman LA Reid to keep Jay-Z from going to Warner with his new label Shawn Carter Records.  A that  urlLink Rock-a-Fella  sure is a big player now.

      So this whole thing turned out to be quite a disappointment. On friday I decided to stay home and watch  urlLink Koh Lanta , the French version of  urlLink Survivor  (or  urlLink Robinson  to those of you who know the original), inaptly named after a not very desert  urlLink island  off the Thai coast. It's been like 10 years since the show first aired in Sweden but the concept still works. It's much more fun when people suffer.  The next morning I went down to the beach, swam a bit and lay in the sun. I just love being able to dive into the sea whenever I feel like it. The beach in Nice is not the best though. There's no sand, but small stones, and it kills your feet. I prefer the beach at  urlLink Juan les Pins , but then you have to take your car and finding a parking spot is impossible if you're not there before noon (I rarely get up that early on a weekend). In the afternoon I went shopping for a new pair of sneakers, but I didn't find what I was looking for (color). I did buy a DryFit Singlet to look good while running.  That evening I was supposed to go with a couple of friends to  urlLink La Siesta , an open air night club/casino near  urlLink Antibes  where French House DJ Laurent Wolf was playing. Finally,at 9 AM I got a call saying the whole thing was off. I was, to say the least, disappointed. Since I was now on my own, I decided not to go clubbing but to hit the bars. I went to  urlLink Wayne's  as on many occation before, to chat with the nice anglo-American girls that always come there. On this lovely evening, not one but two bachelorette parties came by and I stole a kiss from one of the many pretty bridesmaids. This was without end for they soon left to the dismay of many a man. Later on, I hooked up with two British girls (a blond and a brunette in their late 20's, both good looking) and convinced them to go to  urlLink l'Escalier  (as usual). It so happened that  urlLink Goa , one of the legends of Nice night life, had found their friend, so the five of us headed to over there. The time we got to the bar, there was a huge line outside. Goa tried to get us in through his connections, but me and the brunette got stuck outside. The other girls soon came back out and them not wanting to cue again, I accompanied them to their hotel. On the way there I found out, to my surprise, that the blonde had a kid and was about to be married. Oops.  That made 3 soon-to-be brides and the circle was closed. I had foretold this moment earlier in the evening when I told one of the brides " 3 brides in one evening would be a miracle and bring you good fortune for the rest of your days ". I took this as a sign and kissed the girls goodbye to wander home on my own.
