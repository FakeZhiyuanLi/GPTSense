          Recently my friend Stacey and I went to a Rock the Vote "meet-up." Stacey owns an alternative record shop, (Vertigo Music, 2426 Penn Ave., West Lawn, PA-check it out!!), and I have a newsstand in downtown Reading, so we both thought we'd have either a forum, resources, or the network to contribute towards Rockin' the 2004 vote. I don't wish to critique of the meeting, but I will, as a public service announcement to my peers and contemporaries, and in order to invite comment , post the recent email we received from the pro tempore leader of the local Rock the Vote chapter...please note the text I've highlighted in bold red, and note that we were the 2 "least young" attendees.     "Hi all. We will be covering GENeration neXt Fest at Stonecliff Recreation Area on Saturday and Sunday, August 21st and 22nd, from 12-8 PM. They will have a table and chairs for us. I need to know who would be willing to help out. The Reading Eagle will also be stopping by for a photo op at some point.  It should be fun. There will be bands, skate and BMX demos, magic shows, henna tattoos, hairwrapping, jousting, bungee run, giveaways, and vendors.  It would be nice to break it up into 4 hour shifts.  Saturday 12-4 Saturday 4-8 Sunday 12-4 Sunday 4-8  Please let me know *NO LATER THAN MONDAY THE 16TH AT NOON* when you can work    urlLink   .             The youngins get first dibs, then the elders will fill in if there are still openings .  I will let you know the final schedule on Tuesday."      Is this my first personal encounter with age discrimination??? Why are we suddenly second class citizens, especially considering that WE are Generation X ??? What up wit dat???? Just because I'm excited to hear YAZ on the "First Wave" Sirius Satellite radio station, that's no reason to put me in the nosebleed section of the volunteer table. Should it read, "The cool people will get to work the table when it's placed in the shade and a really good band is playing. In case of inclement weather, or table placement in the glaring hot sun, the elderly folks are welcome to enjoy the elements!"    comments and recountings of similar experiences welcome.

         I've actually lost some customers in the past few weeks (this is why I must evaluate my current field of customer service practice). A zero tolerance policy towards       attitudes/rudeness/disrespect has bubbled forth in recent years. Interestingly, it's mostly the old ladies who raise the loudest ruckus!!! I believe in respect for my fellow humans, and specifically for the customer, but at the cost of losing my dignity, or tolerating abuse?    First story: Older lady, she's been coming in as long as I've been in business: four years, 2-4 times a week, 3-4 transactions each visit as she scratches off her instant tickets, then comes back in to redeem for more, or just to shell out additional cash for another fix...She never once has greeted me. She always walks in, shoves her "bingo" lottery winners at me, and says "Gimme a cash five." Never responds to normal polite salutations. She is also very possessive of my table out front-she likes to scratch her tickets there, she portrays a sense of entitlement towards anyone else who may sit at the table before she does...But we've historically been operating under the guise of detente: I realize she's not going to change, but the catalog of her offenses has slowly built up over the years. Meanwhile, every lunchtime, a contingency of sheriffs stops in for their normal dosage of lottery, icy tea, soft pretzels, crackers, etc. We get along well, they're polite, we engage in conversation, we have a solid routine going. The two worlds were about to collide. About two weeks ago, during the lunch rush, I had a line of folks in this order: 1. Sheriff Kenney, purchasing his weekly 25 dollar lottery order, in progress. 2. Sheriff Bobby, waiting to place his 5 dollar lottery order. 3. Madame Bingo. So, as sheriff Kenney's order is printing, Bobby asks for his order, and I say, "We just have to wait for Kenney's to finish printing, then you're next," then I turn to Madame and I say, "You'll be next after him, as soon as we finish." She says, seemingly under her breath, but certainly loud enough for all to hear, "Yeah, I have to wait for that asshole," referring to Kenney. I look at the sheriffs, they look at me. We're all like, "Did you hear that? Did I just hear that? Did she just say that? Did she just call him/me/you an asshole???" She's not even remotely interested in our reaction-I gotta give her credit for chutzpah.   So I finish up Kenney's order, then Bobby's, and now it's just me and bingo lady, mano a mano. I said to her, "You do realize, that was an officer of the law?" She responded merely with a loud explosion of air, no words. I continued, "Not only was he an officer of the law, but he is my customer, and if you ever curse at one of my customers again, You will never ever be served in this store again, understand?" She just rolled her eyes, tossed her tickets at me, and said, "Gimme 10 bingos."    I'd actually have to say, that hearing her opine about the sheriff was only the second time I've seen her go "off topic," (to borrow from the talking heads' analysis of the Rev. Al Sharpton's speech at the Democratic National Convention), the topic being lottery, in the four years she's been coming into my shop. The only other incident I can recall refers to her table entitlement fixation, which reared its ugly head several months ago. My friend Melissa is an attorney working out of Norristown, and she occasionally has business at the Court House across the street. If she has time to spare she stops by. Well, at this point, she was 8-1/2 months prego, ready-to-pop, and she had time to kill and work to do, so she asked if she could camp out at my table. Since it is my table, owned by me, paid for by myself, in front of my store, where I pay rent, and my name is on all the official grown up paperwork certifying that I am the owner of Quicksilver News, I welcomed her to sit at my table. Well, Melissa was in the store, and we were shooting the breeze, and independently we both noticed that Madame Bingo had situated herself at the neighboring coffee shop's table, with her back towards us, but that she kept craning her head around to throw dirty looks at us. I finally said something quietly to Melissa, "Have you noticed this?" She said, "Yeah, what's that all about?" I answered, "I'm not sure, she's not renowned for her charming disposition, so who knows."   Melissa went back to the table to do more work. She needed to get to court, so she gathered her things, then came inside to say goodbye. "I think it's about the table, because as soon as I stood up, she slipped right into my chair, started scratching her lottery tickets, and gave me another dirty look." "OOOh," I said, "That makes sense, because she always sits at that table. Did she happen to notice that you are about to deliver a baby any second??" We just giggled and let it go. Meanwhile. And here's the real irony of this whole story. The coffee shop table that Madame Bingo vacated is where the sheriffs usually sit in winter or inclement weather. This was wintertime, right around lunch, so they were just streaming in for their lunch breaks. Bingo had just switched, so the sheriff table was available and they all assumed their usual positions. Melissa bade me farewell, and Bingo came in for another hit.    I handed her her tickets, and she offers me this gem, "It's a good thing that woman got up from the table, 'cause the sheriffs would have MADE her move." I responded, "That woman is my friend, that is my table, and she or any one of my other customers may sit there whenever they want and for however long they want, so I don't want to hear it." Not highly confrontational, but ironic in light of the more recent meeting of Madame Bingo and the sheriffs.      In the same week, another woman hassled my helper and I over a fourteen dollar ticket which I ultimately had to pay for. She, too, is a regular, coming in once a week with a very specific order. She wasn't clear with my helper about what she wanted, as people are used to my handling them and knowing their quirks. So my helper printed out the logical ticket order for her request, which is not the quirky thing she likes, but the tickets cannot be cancelled, and she refused to buy the ticket. Said ticket would have satisfied her request, but  not  her concept of mojo for lottery luck, which is the nexus around which much of this idiosyncratic and agitated behavior turns. During the exchange, which quickly grew heated, she pulled the "I don't have to shop here, I can go somewhere else," card. I told her that was fine by me, and here's a mathematical illustration of the economics which prove that mistreatment is not a prudent business factor. *Cost of refused ticket, from my pocket:  $14.00  *Customer's total purchase amount:  $39.00  *My Profit from customer's purchase amount (5% of $39.00):  $1.95  *Difference between my out of pocket cost/profit earned: $14.00-$1.95= $12.05  *Amt. of lottery tickets I need to sell to earn back the remaining cost of the refused ticket ($12.05, with the margin of 5%):  $241.00       * Cost of time spent in disharmony :    Priceless  Yes. two hundred and forty one dollars, that's what I need to sell to capture the remaining cost. And let's keep in mind that that's just to get me out of the hole. So in her mind, and she is right theoretically, she's spending $39.00 and should get whatever she wants. But for me, the profit is so little, for so much labor, that if someone mixes in anger/attitude/rudeness, I cannot tolerate it. I cannot tolerate it as a human being, and I secondarily cannot take it even as the liberal half hearted non hardcore capitalist that I am. So she didn't come back this week, therefore I lost $1.95, which is still less than the $12.05 that I lost last week when she did give me her business.    Later, on the day of this entry:   Oddly enough,   that old lady who called the sheriff an asshole came in about an hour after I wrote that last section. But to balance her return in satisfaction of the laws of inertia, this afternoon I got into a screaming match with a nasty lottery customer. All I did was ask him "Is there anything else?" to encourage a response, after I took his lottery order and then he just stood there. He replied, "You just keep on pushin' those buttons til I say when." I'm totally serious. And he was totally serious. Recently, my friend Stacey described her rage as she realized some customers were shoplifting from her small record store where she works her ass off for every penny. Now I understand her rage, because I was utterly enraged. It was horrible. HORrible. I can't believe I let someone get to me like that. I almost jumped over the counter. So I gave him his change, and a look (and a little slam of the drawer). And he adds, "This is a customer service job for a people person-you need to get another job." I lost it. I said "You're the one who started it, giving me attitude like that, I don't need that." As he's walking away, he throws over his shoulder, "There's plenty of other lottery machines," he says. And I told him "Go ahead and use them, and don't EVER come in here again." YELLing across the lobby. It's good to write it down to see how ridiculous it was, to deflate it. I pulled the gate and actually went outside to smoke a cigarette. One of my nice customers was sitting there, asked me how I was and I started bawling. She was so nice. I felt like such an idiot. I don't want to focus on the ugly stuff- I want to be positive. I think I'm generally good people, which makes it harder to be in business, but it certainly provides many ground level departure point for lessons in human behavior. I just want to learn how to handle those situations. Lately I get so caught up in the energy of ugliness, and those people get what they want: they literally "push the buttons", and get the reaction that satisfies their sickness. And that's the larger thing to realize, that all of these folks are caught up in their own misery, and I am A: allowing myself to be caught up in their misery, feeding into it instead of offering any healing, and B: developing my own mythological litany of encounters with its own psychic vibrations of negative human encounters and sustained human addictions to misery.            The lady who consoled me reiterated the "Kill 'em with kindness," slogan. She works customer service on the phones now for the bank who owns my building, but she used to be a Humane Officer dealing with animal cruelty. So she's seen it all. And she says the angrier the abusers got, the nicer she was, which only made them angrier. But often she would get an apology later. She did concede that it took years to get to that point of returning kindness instead of hurt. So, for now, I taped a note to myself on the lottery: "Kill 'em with Kindness!!!" which may come off as a one-liner, and does have a double entendre of "gotcha," but, for now I'll view it as a transitional slogan, to remind me not to react, but to stand in faithfulness to God and myself, trying not only to remember my blessings, but to return the curses of my neighbors with blessings, and hoping that their rescue from sadness and pain is an immanent realization.
