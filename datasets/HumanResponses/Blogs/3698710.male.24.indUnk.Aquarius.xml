						   I had a surprised when I reached home last night, hehehe, my fish tank is filled with cute little fishes again...haha, the fish tank has been left empty ever since my 1 yr 4mths old "Luo Han" had left us...(not "mai xian ya dan" huh...) cos my parents decided to free it so we put it into the small lake at Bukit Panjang. So sad...I would always sit at the fish tank looking at it and it seem to be staring back at me wondering who/what am I...*sob sob* hahaha...I like to look at fishes cos they seem so carefree and they will look at u for a sec before continuing to swim around with their friends.  Caution: The following stuff are boring details...pls do not read if u r sleepy le.

						   Despite the many reminders from "Curry Puff" to catch My Sassy Girl last night, I still didn't manage to keep that in mind...Haiyo, really old man liao...Or I was probably too carried away by the beautiful music performance from the members of the Singapore Soka Association. Thanks for bringing me along, Teck Seng, it was a great night! :) (Sorry that we din go "Lao Pat Sat" cos it will be quite rush if we want to catch the last train.)  BUT! "Lao Tian Ye" didn't want me to miss the show... I bought some supper back home so after I washed up, I was sitting in front of the TV alone eating...As I was switching channels, I "heng heng" saw the show! Alamak! *I remembered* However, I only missed the part on how the two met together. Anyway, I'm going to buy the vcd later...hahaha, good show should buy THE ORIGINAL ar...It was funny...so damn funny that I fall off the chair and rolled on the floor bursting out my laughters...(abit exaggerating...hey! This is my blog mah...) Step aside...Jackie Chan...hoho. The plot was good and the ending was like unexpected.   I like the part where they were in the train and doing this bet on guessing which leg (It's either left or right...) to cross the red line (drew by a kid using his mom's lipstick! haha...) whoever loses shall be beaten...then came this group of soldiers...hahahaha....the guy lost (suay) and the girl "piak" "piak" "piak" "piak"... the guy...Ouch, so hard, the sound of slapping, "piak" was so loud...I laughed alone throughout the show, too funny liao...hahaha, shall stop here, too many interesting parts of the show to share with u all but best is to watch the show urself.  P/s: For those who haven't watch the show: My Sassy Girl, "Ho Sim Eh La" go watch...

						   Phew! Finally finish vacuuming and mopping the floor...now sweating like a pig, haha, cos my mum told me to help her mop the floor since I'm free... anyway I'm used to it liao, *Always mop the floor one leh...haha* Couldn't sleep much so woke up early this morning to finish the chores, and its finally raining...been so hot over the past few weeks, I'm glad the rain came, hmm...at least for now, the air outside is much cooler and fresher.   It's weekend too, haha, but it seem no difference to me as I've been slacking for so long liao, everyday is weekend to me, haha, dun envy... for my friends who are working, its not a good thing to slack and do nothing, its bad for the brain, guess I'm turning stupid...heeee  Msg someone yesterday...I'm glad to hear that she's fine and now in Belgium...

						   Well, last night before I close my eyes... I realized that there is something I wish to put down in my Blog...Not a very big issue but I just want to "niam"... I can't seem to remember when "this" actually happened...trying hard to recall and recall...(An army of brain cells sacrifice in result of this recall operation...)   Nbermind, "This" which I'm referring to is about Me, Myself being "The Organizer".   Short History: About a year++ ago, I "gong gong" found a job at Maybank AMK...('Ming Zhu Ding'...) After working there for weeks, I got to know this group of friends, life was good there (really...*finger-crossed*...hahaha), all shared "same frequency", laugh, eat, joke, sing, dance and "performed" all kinds of nonsense in the so-called "Fish Tank"...(haha, my dear friends of Maybank... u all should know lah...) *Fast Forward* Soon, it was time for us to be separated, and we did have some gatherings after our separation...and one fine day...I was task to organize gatherings...and hence I became "The Organizer"...*Still wondering why is me...*  Organizing gathering is actually a "simple" task, I just have to consider the "members" schedule, fix a date, plan the programs for the day, praying hard they won't be "sian"...hahaha...and I will get to receive some "interesting" "Zhuang Kuang"...@@ case study below...  Case Study: Yesterday was suppose to be another usual gathering : "La Kopi" session. Very "cham" one...as u all know, when organizing gathering, there will always be some who can't make it, very difficult to get 100 percent attendances one lah...But this particular reply I receive...wah..."buey tahan ar!" (Actually, it made me LOL...) SMSes me "SUKU", "SAN PAT" nbermin, still "Bian" / "Ah Biish" me and lastly referred me as Cow....worse, still dare to absent from gathering...In military terms, I can charged u for AWOL...(AWOL = Absence Without Organizer's Leave) hahaha...u shld know who u are huh...;p

						   Yoz yoz yoz...I'm back again...Just got home not long ago and I immediately hooked up to the net to visit Blog, hahaha, no lah, not so desperate to "niam" but just to share a show that I have watched few hours ago. Hoho! Before I go further, let me have my SUPPER too, "You Ji Mian" or "Oil Chicken Mee"? Want some? *In ur dreamz...*   So which show did I watch just now? Make a guess...Nah...not Harry...don't know? Clueless? @@ the title of posting above...Yesh! Jackpot! (Win: 1 container of toilet paper) Its Around the World in 80 days, I bet many of us already knew about this story...for those who don't... go bang wall...*Kidding* Anyway, Jackie twist and turn the story abit lah, no no! No spoilers pls...I can only comment that though the show doesn't come with a bombastic plot, but I PERSONALLY thinks that its quite entertaining...To play safe, catch it during weekdays if u have the time. ;p  Just nice...I finished my Oil Chicken Mee...getting sleepy...Gd niteZ   P/s: Went to catch this movie with SMALL BULLY and Annie...Alamak! I forgot I got "Tao Huey" also...

						   hmm...I think I'm beginning to like this blog stuff, I really appreciate my friends who told me about this website though I thought it was rather "*****"...hehehe. It's like a 'friend' to me now which (cos its not a person) you can talk to when ur friends are busy working, sleeping or doing their very own stuff...I'm now alone in the house (Home Alone) listening to Linkin Park and at the same time doing my 5th write up for the week. I just read Puff's blog about his brother faking mc to escape from NS recall and it gave me some "Ling Gan" to write...hoho ;p   Why do people hide when they face with problem? Why can't they just face the stupid problem when it arise? *Pondering for a sec...* I realise I'm not as happy as before...when it started I also couldn't remember anymore, always feel so heavy...What is it that is bothering me? I also dunnoe...haha. My buddies told me that I should not bottomed up whatever unhappy stuff inside me but in fact I'm just hidding and do not actually have the courage to face my problems. Sometimes I wish I could just "disappear" somewhere or will there be someone to tell me what I should do...

In the mean time, we played "Jenga"...~SWEAT~ haha, everyone got very excited and nervous as the stack got higher...admire the never give up spirit in each of us as we try to clear our turn. Very noisy as everyone was trying to scare each other...*shouting, pat shoulders, poking...*Haha, reached lvl 32 before it collapsed at the hands of Jacob's gf...I was slow to capture the historical moment...hohoho  Continued our mini mahjong game after the Jenga, not realli pros in mahjong but still manage to keep the game going.

I jus had my "second round" of dinner (Read on...will noe why...) and now I'm takin some time to update my blog first before my memory fails me... Heehee...(Hack care my stupid $^%*&%^&amp; project first...) WARNING: LONG BLOG AHEAD...  Chapter 1: Meeting HL...  Jump up at 7am todae but realised tat I still have half an hr of sleep before preparing to meet HL at AMK MRT station control at 930am...so went back and tried to zZZ for the next half an hr... damn...alarm clock rang and its 730am liao! Why so fast! I felt as if I din sleep leh...bla bla bla...  Took a bus to CCK MRT station and quickly went up the platform to wait for the train...my god! 855am le, stupid train... still have to wait for another 4mins...(When u r in a rush...it seems ages even if u hav to wait for a min...tio bo? ha!) Board the train and saw the clock was 9am le, hmm...shld be able to make it ba (comforting myself)...saw a guy sitting opp using the same hp as mine...reached for my hp...Argh! 4get to bring my hp!!! Why I so gong...(Felt "missing" part of myself the rest of the day...) Pray that Annie or HL dun sms me for any last min changes..."toh long" "toh long"...  Reached AMK MRT station control...Finally ar! Phew...935am...Great! Now...where's little puff? haha, lucky I got quite sharp eyes leh, saw someone at the top up machine, hmm...like HL...BINGO! CORRECT AR! Its her! Haha. We dabao Nasi Lemak at cheers and off we go to Annie's hse...  Chapter 2: On the way to Annie's hse...  Board the TIBS bus 853 and on the way, we started wondering if Annie knew abt our morning "invasion" to her hse...hahaha, cos they say I sound joking last nite abt the morning mahjong session...(me no hp...so HL sms her) Annie replied and she was having breakfast at Kovan! Pengz...hahaha...no choice lor, have to wait for her at her blk playground...waited hungrily...  Reached her hse, tot there's no one at hm, so tok abit loud...I got "quite" a shock to see her dad siting in the living rm...*blushed* hahaha...so paiseh...sat down and started digging in our breakfast...acc with a glass of Qoo orange juice? (Am I rite Annie? hahaha) Then...Alex To's new song came into our great mind...hehe, so we asked Annie to download the song...hahaha...The song goes someting like this..."Tuo diao Tuo diao, tuo diao... Shang yi tuo diao... Tuo diao Tuo diao, tuo diao... Wan quan tuo diao...na na na na na na na na..." haha, the song quite nice actually so asked Annie to forward to us.  Played with her cute cousins (Hugged them...carried them and played balloons...) and watched "Qian Ji Bian" for my 3rd time...hmm, suppose to be playing mahjong but communication break down...By the time Lena called us, it was like 12pm le... (okie okie...its all my fault...hahaha) HL was massaging her feet again...hmm... I still hesitate to try...all bcos of XX...say until so scary...wat her feet can't lay on the machine for a min, got the electric and "ba ba" feeling...hahaha ;P  Chapter 3: Sunlight KTV at Cuppage  Reached Centrepoint at ard 130pm and went to exchange Mac ice cream while waiting for Lena... (Bought two bottles of Snapple at Cold Storage which were meant to be smuggled into the KTV...) Met Lena and she too went to exchange for the Mac ice cream when she saw us having the ice cream...  Waited for awhile before going into the KTV, we got a rm at the basement and it was so freaking COLD...(Was shivering instead of trying to sing...haha) In the end, almost all of us were standing while singing, the sofa was too cold to be seated...haha. Btw, the gals realli can sing...good sia...and OF COS! I won't miss my fave ONLY LONELY by S.H.E. Haha, was doin the rap (Ella's part...) and I tink I went bonkers after tat...was doin the "yoz yoz yoz" ting as I rap and I realised I was in Annie's candid camera...Wah...*blushed again*...hahaha, but I managed to clear it...(Sorry...save the memory for the fireworks, k? hehehe, nuting good to see lah...) It was fun-filled for the whole 4 hours of singing, wished the time could jus hang ther...  Chapter 4: Dinner at Da Pai Dang  After our crazy singing, we went to Da Pai Dang for dinner (For those who dun noe, I tink it has extended till Feb '05...dun kill me if it happens to end early...hahaha) We wanted to have the famous Changi V Nasi Lemak but sadly, dun have liao...they changed to a different stall le...haiz... BUT! We settled our dinner with the Seafood stall, yummy, its good lor! (No tok big...)  We ordered Sting Ray (I tink it was abt 2/3 the size of ur keyboard...) , Squids cooked with sambal chilli, Prawn balls and "You Cai" (Which is suppose to be Kang Kong but I can't take so much spicy food so we changed...) Its a pity tat we onli tot of eating and 4gettin our unusual way of startin dinner, tat's to TAKE PICTURES OF THE FOOD FIRST! But we can't deny the food was good lor but quite spicy for me...sniff sniff...hahaha, poor Lena ordered the wrong food to eat...  Chapter 5: Fireworks, viewed at Fullerton  Took a bus down to Fullerton, so mani ppl were alreadi ther with their camera tripod stand ready...cars were parked illegally at the side of the road causing slight traffic jam...hmm, "Lang Shua Lang Hai"... we walked, trying to find the best spot to view and capture the fireworks but it seems tat all the good spots have been taken...The cafes were fully booked and we had to stand at the walkway to view the fireworks instead.  The stupid cafe supervisor asked one of his crew to station near the area we were waiting so as to avoid ppl from "invading" into their territory when the fireworks began...Pls lor! Dun treat us like babarians k...the look on his face..Hng! So arrogant! I feel like givin him a "43" on his face...(tat is to throw my slipper at him..."43" is the size indicated on my slipper...slipper is good to him liao, army we use boots k...haha)  Waited for half an hour, wanted to go hm seeing so mani ppl, hahaha, but was glad tat we heed HL advise to stay for the fireworks.Tada! Came the fireworks burstin high up in the sky!!! Wah Wah Wah...was wat was coming out from everyone's mouth as all of us were Delighted, Excited, Astonished, Dazed to see the fireworks...hahaha. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL! Was glad tat Annie managed to capture the fireworks in mpeg format so we will be able to view it again next time. Great work! It was so smoky after the 8min event and everyone were tryin to make their way hm...so were we...hahaha
