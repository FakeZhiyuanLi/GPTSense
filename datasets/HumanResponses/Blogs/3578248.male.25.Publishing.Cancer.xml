      I read the email around noon on Tuesday, AB was at work, and I had to work that night.  Our schedules overlapped so I wasn't planning on telling her until I got home that night.  I didn't know what the fuck I was going to say, or how the fuck I was going to say it.  Most of me still couldn't believe it.  How do you tell the person you've been living with for 3 years that you have 2 year old daughter.  I was dressed for work and about to leave when AB came home early.  We said hello and everything and I sat down on the couch, still planning on waiting till later.  She sat to the right of me and nestled up to me with her head on my heart.  I could feel that shit about to pound right out of my chest, when she says, "Boy, your heart is beating really fast." "Really?" I asked as if i couldn't tell.  The neighbors probably heart that shit it was so loud and fast.  It must have sounded like jackhammer. "Yea, whats wrong?" she asked. "Umm...Well I have something to tell you." She sat up next to me and from the look on my face she could tell it was not going to be good news.  She probably thought someone died.  I could feel the color draining from my face, my body overheating, and sweat dripping down my sides.  I began at the beginning saying that I had sent an email a while back to G through classmates.com.  AB's face grew tense, my heard pounded away, and I just let it out.   "I might have a 2 and a half year old daughter."  It came out shaky and scared.  I braced for her to get up and leave without a word, but she didn't.  Her shock was as great as mine.  She could only muster up  a "What?"  I continued and told her only what I knew,repeating what I remembered from the email, that the reason I never saw G again was she because she went home after she had a daughter on May 1, 2000.    We both cried.  She hugged me tight, and like everything else, told me it would be ok and we would get through it.  It was the most aweful moment of my life.  Here was this great girl whose life I just ruined, and she was trying to comfort me.  I felt like dirt.   I apologized, but she said there was nothing to be sorry for.  I apologized, but she pleaded with tears that i had nothing to be sorry for.  I was sorry because it meant that she was no longer the most important thing to me.  I was sorry because what we had been talking about and planning wasn't possible anymore, at least not anytime soon.  I was sorry because now I had this whole other life that she wasn't a part of.  I wanted to die right there.  There was still the experience of telling my family.  I didn't know how that would go.  I was sure my mother would blame me and possibly even say that I knew all along.  Thats just her way.  I thought my dad would be pissed.  I didn't know what to expect from the rest of my family.  I called my brother and aksed if he would be around later.  He said he would so I told him I had to talk to him and I would stop by.  I could tell he knew it was big.  I'm very close with my brother, but we didn't do the sit down very often.  With a half gallon jug of beer in my hand I headed to J's house.  I came in, sat down, and drank a pint in 1 gulp.  He just looked at me and said "What is it dude?" I poured another pint, took a big swig and let it out. "I might have a 2 and a half year old daughter with G." He put his head in his hands with disbelie and said, "I thought you were going to say that you were gay." We shared a half-hearted laugh and went through the how's and why's.  I had few answers for him as I still was in shock.  He asked if I told mom and dad yet.  I said no, and that I wanted to wait for the test to come back.  he suggested just telling them now and getting it over with.  He picked up his phone and called our parents. "Dad?  Me and Kev are gonna come over." I could hear my dad's voice laugh and ask  "Why?" "We have something to tell you." Everything is a joke in my hose and I heard him laugh off an "OK."  We walked in and my mother says, "What did you do now Kevin?" My brother waved her off as to say this wasn't the time for jokes.  He suggested we find somewhere private to talk, and my mother let out an, "Oh boy, here we go."  In my dad's office 6 eyes were beating down on me waiting for the ensuing bomb to drop.  My brother waiting with almost excitement at my mothers reaction.  Not that he was enjoying my pain, but my mother had a way of handling things.  Again I could only say, "I might have a 2 and a half year old daughter." My mother let out a piercing "Oh Kevin, how could you do this?" My brother said quickly, "Mom! Relax." "How can I relax?  Kevin I worry about you so much that you are going to make mistakes like this in your life, how could you do this?"  This time my dad with a stoic look on his face told her wait. They fired questions at me that I didn't have the answers for.  It was aweful, but my dad, the optimist that he is left it at, "Tomorrow is another day, all we can do is wake up and move on."  We resolved that we would get through it as a family, and that it would make us stronger in the end.  We have always had a strong family, my main inspiration for wanting my own family.  I couldn't have asked for more growing up, or now as an adult.  My parents are great, and if I can raise a family half as good as them, It'll be a success.

      Sitting side by side on the couch, myself, Brian, and DB relized that with the suddent departure of our fourth roomate, we could no longer afford our palacial digs that were affectionately known as "The Shack".  D's girl was our fouth, and on the 3rd day she woke up early and said goodbye.  It was exaclty what yu'd expect from a girl that would sign up to be D's girl and live wit ha bunch of Fucks like us.  With a baby grand in the corner, and the AC at a constant and quite honestly, uncomfortable 58 degrees, we needed a 4th desperatly.  We began making calls to friends and friends of friends with promises of the finest wine, finest Irish women, and tip-happy tourists.  We made no mention that they would be sleeping in a Dutch Oven. The newly vacant room on the second floor was basically a coffin with the low slanting ceiling and no air circulation to speak of.  Temperatures had to reach 110 degrees during the day that summer.  In fact, if your feet were hanging off the bed, they were probably in the hallway.  It trully was fit for a king, or a sucker, and we had a taker.    A. Tuss arrived the next day and was extatic at the promise of his new found summer.  We collelcted his money before he entered, and the job hunt began almost immediatly, and turned up very little.  He began to not only doubt the promise of tip happy toursits, but he wondered about the wine and women as well.  It was then that we first saw the fury that was Mount Fussuvious.  He exploded with rage, the rage only a 5'9" 130 pound 19 year old could have.  It was ferocious and hysterical all at the same time.  Tuss was rarely taken seriously, and often the target of a good joke.  His claim to fame was a self proclaimed superstardom on the High School track & field circuit and would take any comers in a 100 meter hurdle race.  Truth is he wasn't much taller than the hurdles, but Tuss was a good time and a good friend.  He would drink and raise hell with the best of them, and for that, he fit in perfectly.    DB lived upstairs also, but his room had AC, and he wasn't sharing.  He is the guy who never changes.  I met him the summer before when my brother brought him to live with us for the summer, and we became great friends.  D is about 5 years older than us, but acts 5 years younger.  D loves to smoke, drink, and curse, but most of all he loves to sit on his ass.  The only thing that coupld piss D off was something that would wake him up before noon.  He was the best roomate you could ever have.  The thing about D was his little secret.  I knew it, and every once in a while I could bait him into spilling it in front of a group of hot girls.  We'd get to talking about what we looked like when we were younger, and I'd tell him to break out his license with his shoulder length metal hair, and there it was.  I waited for the inevitable laughter, as D's real name would soon be discovered.  Lenny always hated his name, and went by his middle name Dave.  I loved it, I loved the look in his eye when you'd call him Lenny.  Priceless.    Madden.  If you've met him, there is nothing more to say.   At 6 feet 190, he'll tell you he's all muscle, a brick shit house even.  I say he's soft.  He'll often pull up his shit  to show you his ghostly white Irish skin and "6 pack".  He is the all american kid that you'd love even if he fucked you mom.  Guarenteed there is a great story to go with it.  Madden would often travel by bike and end up falling and spending quite a bit of time nursing his wounds in the gutter.  Madden has a liver that hates him, and an uncanny ability of avoiding certain death.  If you spend a night with him, fear for your life, have a bail fund, and enjoy the ride.  As for myself, I was mostly concerned with smoking pot.  Nicknamed "the Smokefather", I generally didn't go anywhere or do anything without a buzz on.  I owned everyone's weakness, and knew exactly how to get to them - all in good fun of course.  This was my 3rd summer in Cape May, and I had the most tenure in our crew.  We all waited tables at night and used my fake beach tags during the day.  I refused to pay to go on the beach and for several years was making fake tags out of Entenmann's danish boxes and crayola crayons.  Fuck them for charging me for building sand castles and pissing in the ocean.  It trully was the summer that dreams are made of, whether or not those dreams came true was another thing all together.

      I found out on a Tuesday. October 29th, 2002 I believe. It came across as an e-mail, so sharp and so impersonal. It was a reply to an shot-in-the-dark email i sent through good ol' Classmates.com. I looked up someone I once cared about, someone that basically disappeared. I had tried to make contact before, once by phone in September 2000. Her mother answered and it was clear she didn't want to talk to me, and maybe another email sometime after that. A month or so went by and I had forgotten about hitting "send". I had spoke of her before, it was not a secret to my girlfriend, AB, that G was someone I cared about. I had often told her that I knew I would run into her again. I always pictured it as passing by on the street, not like this.   An email came across from Classmates, that my email had been read. I was shocked. I quickly sent another email saying something to the effect of, "Wow! drop me a line, say hello, anything." We exchanged small talk back and forth though a few emails when one from her said something to the effect, "I have something to tell you." I was quite surprised, what could she possibly have to tell me that could wait for 3 years. I remember not really thinking about it or being worried at all. I remember a girl at work saying it was not going to be good news. For some reason I wasn't worried.   A few days had gone by withough hearing back about this "something" that she had to tell me about. Nerves began to settle in, and still no reply. I emailed again saying, "Tell me whats going on or I'll just start calling you." Finally I had 1 New message.   As it turned out, the reason I had not seen or heard from G in 3 years was because she had had a daughter, V, on May 1, 2000. I remember thinking that was the last day of the semester at WCU, I was probably already drunk in Cape May. It was to go down as my greatest summer ever. The email went on in a very nonchalant way saying something to the effect that I may or may not have had something to do with it. WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY? Are you fucking serious? That was my initail reaction, quickly turning into complete disbelief. I was sick to my stomach, i did a few dry-heeves, an i took a long pull from my piece. You fucking piece of shit, it was the true meaning of shock and awe. There was actually a time where I thought it wasn't possible, that it was a sick joke. My mind raced through and between every emotion in the next week or so. I didn't know what to feel, I was Fucking Pissed, happy, sad, excited, nervous, and scared all at the same time. How the fuck could someone actually do this to another person? How the fuck do you get pregnant, not say a word to anyone, have a child, and leave without ever saying a word, and with no intentions to ever do so? How the FUCK do you actually do that? How the FUCK?

      That summer we got ourselves into the biggest pickle any of us had ever seen.  We didn't know it then, but looking back, that summer changed all of our lives forever.

      It's come to my attention that I sound pissed off, cynical, and generally unhappy.  Well let me say that I am a cynical person.  For the most part, I think people are shit.  It's rare that you find someone who gets "it", someone who cares about their friends, and who trully is a good friend. I'm lucky enough to have a few people like this in my life, but I've also come across people who don't have a clue, and that has me pretty jadded.  Am I unhappy?  I don't think so, not in the sense that I don't like my life.  Like I said yesterday, I know where the pieces to my happiness are, and I know that with time they will come together, It's just aggravating and frustrating waiting for them to fall into place.  I'm pretty confident that in 10 years or whatever, I'll look back at this time in my life as just another stepping stone, and not as a great disaster.  So finally, Am I pissed off?  Yes.  I have a lot of anger stored up that I don't think I should let out.  I think if I did, it would make things worse.  Keeping it in is making me miserable now, but I won't stoop to a low level and blow my top.  I would probably say things that would be irrepairable, and I don't want to do that.  There will come a time when it will be understood by the people who need to understand it.  I'm trying not to let it ruin me right now, and it's a daily battle, but as Tony Soprano would say, I'm trying to be the strong silent type.   "Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot That it do singe yourself." -William Shakespeare   I think I'm at the boiling point right now Wil, but I'm trying.  kevin j

      Right now I'm sitting in this tiny office with no work to do.  Some would say thats a good thing, but I don't think so.  If I have to come to work, at least let there be work to do.  What a waste of fucking time.  Sure i'm getting paid (lets not even go there), but it's not even worth it.  I should be getting a new job in a week or so, but who cares, its still just pointless time-wasting dribble.  I'm gonna die at this fucking desk and its real depressing.  There should be a job where you sit on the beach all day making sand castles.  I'd be the best at that, and you could even pay me shit.  Even when you do something you're good at or like, it's still work, and it still sucks the life out of you.  Anyway, I don't think my problems stem from work. It's not that bad, just boring.  My problem is time...either moving too fast or too slow.  I'm almost 25 and the pieces of my life are all over the place.  I know where they are and pretty much how they fit, but good luck putting them together.    thats a good start for now  kevin j

      Well here we go, if you can handle me in person, you should be ok, if not, be warned because this will probably be a lot more intense.  Either way, enjoy.  I'll hold back nothing, and if you comment, i hope you won't either.  If you don't like what i have to say, I don't care.  I do think it's kind of a shame that i need a stupid "blog", whatever the fuck that is, to get shit off my chest, but whatever works.  kevin j  "You think I'm shit? Well, you're wrong, 'cause i'm champagne, and you're shit. Until the day you die, you, not me, will always be shit."
