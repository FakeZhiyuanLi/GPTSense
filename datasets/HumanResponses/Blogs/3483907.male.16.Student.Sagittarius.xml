      Buddy Rice won the Indy 500 today. he is the first pole winner to win the indy 500 since 1997. The race was delayed many times due to the rain. I'll admit that hate nascar i like to watch drag racing and irl i just think irl is more intresting than nascar it is more international and me being mexican that draws more intrest to me.

      Well, My Atlanta Braves lost to the phillies today 4-1, they are now under .500 for the season. The kid they brought up to pitch today for Ramirez faired pretty well but of course the Braves provided little offense attack scoring only one run. Chipper was out again after he was hit by a pitch in the knee two nights ago. Mike Hessman is also playing first for LaRoche.This will be very intresting to see if the braves can continue there run at first place. It will be a challenge for them but i have faith in the best manager Bobby Cox and the Best GM John Schurholtz to pull them through this. When Chipper and Giles finally get helathy hopefully they will make a run for first again.

Well from what i saw of the movie it seemed ok at best( i hope you get waht i say by from what a saw). It was lost of fun if you know what i mean. Hopefully i will get to see the day after tomorow maybe tomorow or sometime soon beacuse i have herd nothing but great things about this movie.

Ugh what am i doing up this early in the moring.......3 in the morning.......sleep sounds really good right now.

      Today marked the end of Techtv. From now on it will be called G4Techtv. I am not particularly happy about this because several of the faces will no longer be around(ex. Leo Laporte) and it just wont be the same.
