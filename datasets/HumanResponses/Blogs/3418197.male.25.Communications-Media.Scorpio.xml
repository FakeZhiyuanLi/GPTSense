      I'm adding a new post today - not because I have anything interesting to say, but because I'm being badgered to update my blog.   I do intend to eventually make a habit of keeping this fresh, but it may take a while to get into some kind of routine. Especially since I try to avoind my computer at home, since I sit in front of one all day at work ...  WAIT ... here's something interesting ... If you haven't already visited it, check out  urlLink this . Download a couple of the videos - most of them are pretty funny. I especially recommend no. 7, although beware, it's probably the one with the worst language.    But man, it is funny.

      OK, so maybe I'm not as web savvy as I thought ...  Can anyone who may happen upon this blog give me some kind of hint as to how I might add some links to the sidebars at the right?  I was playing around a little, but nothing would come out right.   Thanks in advance, I hope ...

      Well, I just started this, mainly so I can post comments on other peoples' blogs ... but who knows, eventually I may actually turn this into something.   So check back, if you want. I'll try to put something useful and/or entertaining on here from time to time.

      I've added a couple new links on the left.  &nbsp; There's some really cool sites there. Although, if you found my blog, chances are you already know about most of those sites anyway.  &nbsp; Hey, I do what I can.  &nbsp; By the way ... is there actually anybody out there reading this? How about you drop me a little "hello" in the comments, just to let me know you were here? &nbsp; Thanks, y'all. (I'm heading to Dallas for vacation later&nbsp;this week. Gotta work on my Southern accent ...)

      That's right, Rob (and everyone else - if there is anyone else), I'm posting two days in a row.   Not that I have anything important to say. But you should check out some of my links that I finally got posted. There will be more soon. Hopefully later tonight, if time permits.

      So I guess I haven't been updating this as often as I thought I would.   I'm not ready to abandon it, but it's not really much to look at, is it?  I'm going to try to at least get some good links up soon. If nothing else, hopefully I'll be able to make this a good place to come when you're looking for good places to go ... or something like that ...  Till next time (who knows when ...), have a good one.  -db
