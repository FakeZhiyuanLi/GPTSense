       I have a  urlLink Launchast Radio Station.  It is very diverse. But... I'm sorry... Miles Davis and Rap DO NOT MIX. That is just wrong. For those of you who don't know who Miles Davis is, I'm sorry. Anyway, I am typing this at a friend's house because my internet has already been turned off. I am moving in just 3 days, and only about half of my house has been packed, which kind of sucks. No, actually, it really sucks. A lot. Well, I just had a b/day and I got some CDs and a $50 Amazon.com gift certificate. Belle & Sebastian, Hootie & the Blowfish, Nickel Creek, & Nirvana! I'm happy now. Excuse me, but I must go. But before I exit, here's an obscure thing to laugh (or scream in sick horror) at.  What Is The #1 Question Asked To A Person With Checkered Pants?  I think it should be...  "Is that a bishop in your pants, or are you just happy to see me?"

       Moving is a terrible process. My House is currently a large maze of all different types of boxes. Sorting, filing, and having dust allergies... it's just enough to drive someone to the edge then drop them off right in front of it with no money. I went on my scavenger hunt. We got a girl arrested, stole a sherrif's promotional sign off his fence (which ended up in he and his wife chasing us down a sidewalk in their bathrobes), and (I came up with this) did a rendition of the last supper at McDonald's(TM), with Judas smoking a french fry. I was not being sacreligious, don't give me any crap. My team won (of course) and we enjoyed doing it. It was not a Jackass(TM) type stunt thing, though. I hate that show, even if it is actually funny sometimes. I mostly just hate MTV(TM). One team did get kicked out of Wal-Mart(TM), though. Did you know that it's against the company policy to take still photos or videos in there? I think that's sort of interesting.  Note: I apologize for all of the retarded (TM)'s I put on here, and for my spelling and grammar, which, after so long in school, still need work.

       Hello. I am Andrew and so forth, and today I have done almost absolutely nothing, so I thought I would describe it to you. I made a lot of phone calls, mostly of what I am to do the rest of the week. I have a meeting with a restaurant owner to teach him how to use his computer(he leads a sad, sad, computer-deprived life), and to know to call someone to build their  urlLink Permanent Cosmetics  website for them. I also have a meeting from 5:30-10:00 searching around downtown Nowhere, Arkansas on some crazy hunt(which sounds strangely interesting), then Friday, a large gathering at my church. I have also planned having a small gathering at a friend's home on a lake. It should be wet. Very wet. A jet ski, a party barge, a speedboat, a big screen, and a few close friends is all it takes to make a disas- I mean- fun time. Talk to you then.

       Yes, I'm back to haunt you all. Oh well...  I've recently become absolutely re-obsessed with  urlLink neopets .&nbsp;It's almost sad, but I'm hopelessly lost in this pointless charade. Well, anyway, I've been reading a ton of Stephen King lately... right now I'm reading "Carrie" and "'Salem's Lot". They make me want to just faint or something... he's such an amazing writer, and human being...  I swear I'll be more interesting next time. Bye.
