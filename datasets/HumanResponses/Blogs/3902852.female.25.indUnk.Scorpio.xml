      memememememememeee!  it was an overall kick-ass night, but the cherry on top was that i could feel ngak and i are actually more comfortable with each other now. perhaps its a good thing that he's not wanting any commitments at the moment, so that we have a timespan to be friends. god knows ive had enough of fast-forwarded relationships which failed because they lacked the basis of friendship.  highlight of the night was when he was having a break from singing - val, ngak and i were outside in the corridor taking silly pictures of each other. oh yes, more nice couply pics will be up for viewing very soon, sweeties! oh yes, more hugging was required to snap said pics. ;)  we must have been out there for a bloody long time because by the time we came back in, joyce and berber had vanished. :P   *** berber darling, i just wanna say that YOUR VOICE ROCKS! ***  we hungout till almost 5am. yes yes.. i know im doing the "wait as long as i can" thing again. but i cant help it. and it just doesn't feel right if i go home early fridays anyway. but ok, i gotta have some restraint, so i'm just gonna let myself do this on fridays and saturdays. NO MORE LATE WED'S!  or other weekdays for that matter!  i made it in to work 1130am. not so bad huh? will be meeting val and ngak later today too... :)  *** special BIG HUGS to boo *** cheer up! kitty SOON will be ok... with u caring for him, he'll be well in no time!

      dear berber... u just have to be strong. be your own superwoman. know that u are a special person and noone can destroy you other than yourself. it's ok to indulge and take a few risks sometimes.... but ultimately, u know u can survive ANYTHING. u can't change anything that has happened, but u can live for the future!  astrogirl... we were at 116 last night. no, i didn't stay late to wait for ngak. probably the first time for awhile... hee. but i seriously need to start sleeping earlier. could barely stand yesterday from sheer fatique. and somehow managed to stay undefeated on the pool table for god knows how long... probably bcos i was too tired to care and played without much will to win or nerves. also the CBF attitude probably made a coupla guys nervous too. ha!  still trying to figure what's wrong with my blog pages not loading... so meanwhile i'll be flooding the main page with new posts instead of adding onto comments!  :|

      astro sweetie, that must have been an extremely interesting experience for u. aren't u glad u found out more, and that he was actually willing to spill the beans on his dating status? at least he was honest about it... i've met men who have purposefully concealed their status just to source for unwittingly willing participants in their game of bastardry. oh believe me, there are so many of these scumbags around. although his behaviour to your mutual friend which is causing her distress is another matter altogether...  but alas, i am by nature a schizophrenic, even at times multiple schizoid. i believe there is no absolute in everything and anything, yet certain things are very concrete to me. all men are bastards.. but some of them are less so than the others. u gotta admit there is a bitch in everyone of us, right? ;)  of course, it is much better to be a bitch than a bastard. anyway.  my friends have always marvelled at my ability to bounce back from everything that has ever happened to me. being jaded doesn't mean i stop trusting people. i kinda just wipe my databank out and start afresh. flick a switch in my head. when i get over something, or someone, that whole episode is not only closed, but almost certainly deleted from my mind. coldhearted? perhaps. but it is my defense mechanism and it keeps me sane.  sometimes i feel sad about something which has happened many months ago. which means i did not completely throw it out of my head, left remnants to rot and grow, and let it resurface again. it's a good thing this seldom happens.   no regrets - i live by it.  *** this weird post was inspired by the mention of bastards ***

      Even the best of men....  ARE BASTARDS!  A small confession on my part. I met a stranger whom i thought was an interesting personality. okay, i was fighting with a certain significant other and needed a distraction.   He was sparkly, well travelled, witty, charming, adventurous, mysterious, silly, intense, bohemian.....the list goes on. I was told he was sooooo nice and amazing. I didn't think he was hot cos he's not your typical gorgeous Adonis, but his personality more than made up for it. I was wondering why this rare find only had one girlfriend all his life!  i thought - either he has the small dick complex or highly dangerous.The first meeting intrigued me and i set up a second to see if there were other sides to this seemingly fascinating creature...  But alas, more talk revealed he was seeing a mutual friend. And this friend could have possibly confided in me about him before! Believe me, she was very troubled. Maybe she could've been seeing someone else, but my gut feeling tells me otherwise because of what SHE revealed to me about this certain someone. After more beer flowed, i found out he was seeing somebody else AND her a few months ago. You really can't tell maaaan. They should put an X on dangerous boys' foreheads...   Boo, you're right about being the buddy. When guys really tell you what's going on, it really makes you wonder...are all men bastards? These guys are cool and great to hang out with. They're sweet and lovely people but how they deal with women can be so f***ed up!  What a turn off. But he's cool as a buddy. And i doubt he's short on a certain body part.  The dating game can be so perilous....:S

       extracted from   urlLink  www.tarot.com     &nbsp;   We celebrate two Full Moons this July, and when that happens in any calendar month — which is pretty rare — the second one is called the "Blue Moon."        &nbsp;   Even though the Moon does not really change colors, the image of a Blue Moon has inspired poets, songwriters... and lovers!      Astrologically, the Blue Moon this July 31st occurs in the idealistic sign of Aquarius, opposite the Sun on its annual summer journey through passionate Leo. At the same time, Neptune, the planet of dreams, is cozying up to that Aquarian Blue Moon, adding imagination, illusion and inspiration to the timing of this rare event. So dream big... but don't let Neptune sweep you completely off your feet!       &nbsp;     &nbsp;  plan something romantic with your love ones for this friday!    the moon shall be on our sides...

      aiiiiight. first things first... i didn't get up THAT late ok? it was only 1030am when i woke up. haha... quickly rang office and said i had an appointment which i forgot to write in my work diary. then went to meet my gf nicole to get my freelance work pay. ended up in the office eventually at 230pm. :P  dear boo has managed to suss things out with ngak in her very drunk state last night. hope he didn't get things the wrong way, or thinks im trying to tie him down, or thinks i put her up to it! :o but anyways, it has been clarified that he's not ready for commitment at the moment... so that kinda takes a load off my mind really. now that i know where things stand, i can stop obsessing about where the hell all this is going! i can probably start being myself around him now. hee.  this is rather full on for my very tired brain to handle right now... together with a very tired body.   but it's all good.  THANKS BOO!!!! for taking a huge cloud outta my head! :D

AGAIN!&nbsp;    I'm sure bloop is still down.&nbsp;    I'm supposed to be her slave for today and she's sleeping the day away.&nbsp; good.    &nbsp;  In my state of drunkeness, I carried a little kitty home with me.   I must have played with him the entire night.    &nbsp;  Woke up with him curling up right by my face.&nbsp; SO CUTE!    &nbsp;  Fed him a little and brought him back to the pub.   I will have to visit him again tonight.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  uh huh...I'm late for work today. *hics*    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        Asking a Guy Out      by Mark Sullivan    Men definitely like it when women ask them out. What's not to like? But before you get busy with your phone and address book, there are a few things you should know.   For starters, a part of the guy will wonder if you've called him up because you want to have sex with him. Guys are generally hoping to have sex whenever they go on a date, so this probably won't mean he'll behave any different, but you might want to set some limits early on. (Unless that is why you called him.)   Also, be prepared for lots of dating gray areas: Who'll drive? Who'll pay? Who'll decide where to go? The impetus is generally on the guy to control the flow of events on a date, but since you initiated things, how far will the initiative extend? Ideally, this will be part of the fun, but it can lead to baffled expectations on both sides.   Another thing to consider is something guys have been dealing with since time began: The answer might be no.

      over here!  goddamnit i am unable to post any comments on this blog due to the page not loading... so i have to make new posts all the time!!  glad to see a warm reception for little bruno! he's naughtier than nemo though... probably younger too. very very frisky, gets scared at EVERYTHING, and runs himself into his glass walls! sigh... hope he settles in. it's been almost a week. if this goes on, he will fall sick under the stress and dieeeeee... :|  my weekend was gooooooood. ;)   friday night after leaving ballymoon, i went to 116 where i was warmly received by ngak's friend val... we proceeded to drink ourselves silly till wee hours of the morning. nick was the instigator behind more drinking games of rolling dice, which resulted in ngak sleeping on 2 chairs and me being sent home by lina at the end of it all at 6am. i didnt speak to ngak much all night but he did manage to tell me that he had a dinner appointment with his church group, and that his church group outings are given first priority in his life. fair enough... but why the hell could he not have just called or sms'ed right? whatever.  anyways, so he crashed out and we didnt even say bye on friday. saturday morning i felt sick as a dog... barely made it home with help from lina, and definitely could not make it to work. woke up in the arvo, decided to login and check my mails... and there he was on msn, saying sorry he made me drink so much etc. (though it wasnt just him making me drink... not sure why hes so sorry...) we chatted for awhile and then val sms'ed me to go to wala wala's at night. ngak said he'd drop by too, after his gig at a restaurant nearby. and so that was what we did. lester came by too... we all went for supper after that, at newton. i'm sure this is droning on really boringly for youse, so i'm just gonna skip the details and say, no we still haven't gone beyond the hug-goodnight stage. :) though plans were made for to meet on sunday after his church session, at chaani's place for a house party.   i got up rather late... came in to my office to get some work done. about an hour later, he called. :) u know, this must be the first time he actually called when he said he would. we managed to meet up alone for once, but unfortunately didnt hangout very long before our presence was requested at chaani's. more drinks, dvds, pizzas and kfc's took place. usual bantering etc. i guess the highlight of the night was at the end of it all, just before chaani shooed us out of his place, ngak was very insistent on taking a good photo with me. we tried to snap it ourselves, using a mirror, or holding the camera backwards etc. which all failed miserably. then his friend edmund saw us and offered to snap it. but then even though it looked ok from the camera viewer, val (it was her camera) said later that it was a terribly blur photo. of course, the best part was that throughout all this we were hugging each other. :P  earlier in the day, i (conveniently) asked to leave my work notes in his bag. and of course, i forgot to take them back when we parted on sunday night. oh but, really, i really genuinely forgot ok? :D  so he had to meet me for lunch on monday to pass them back to me... :D  it was quite a normal lunch... see, the thing is when we meet we are always civil. he doesnt outright flirt with me. perhaps its still early yet and hes still trying to know me. me? yes i wanna know him too but i really wanna grab him and find out how well he kisses! going slow is good though... have to keep that in mind.  :P

       Extracted this from   urlLink   www.romanceclass.com      &nbsp;    What is a Crush?      Crushes are sort of easy entry-ways into the world of strong emotions and relationships, without having much of the scary risk involved in really dating someone.     &nbsp;   People have crushes on their teachers, on actors, on band members, on scout leaders or pastors...       A crush involves admiring someone from a safe distance. You feel a hugely powerful emotion, stronger than anything you've felt before. You obsess over this person. You would die for them. You think about them constantly. You are thrilled when you are near them and miserable when you are away from them. You desperately want to tell the person how you feel - but are frightened of it at the same time.     If you're involved in a crush - enjoy it! We have ALL had crushes over the years and they're something you look back on with great fondness. Look at what makes your crush special. Those qualities that you admire in your crush are qualities that are very special to you, and it's very important to learn what those are. It helps you when you look for a real boyfriend or girlfriend to date, to know what you are drawn to.     Also, learn how to handle your feelings. Most of what a crush is about is learning that you get POWERFUL emotions in relationships - and that you need to deal with them. Just like you learned in earlier years how to deal with strong anger and strong sadness, you're now learning how to deal with strong feelings of attraction. You're learning that it's a nice feeling - but that it's a painful feeling if you let it take over your life. You need to be able to balance those feelings with the rest of what is going on in your world.     As hard as it might seem right now, your feelings for your crush will even out over time. It usually takes a few weeks to a few months, but you will learn to bring them under control. And as you learn more about life, you will find someone that is your own age, and actually someone you can *date* to start to become interested in. When that's the case, you can work to be their friend, and then their best friend. And it's at that point that your interests change from a crush to a real, meaningful relationship.      &nbsp;   Oh no, will I survive even a few days???     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       urlLink   If you work in a office building, you'll share a communal toilet with different companies on the same level.   I'm not too sure about you but I do have a favourite cubicle I'll always use. It's closest to the window so that my ciggarette smoke could be aired.   Recently, in my visits to the toilet, there's this wasp flying in and out the window and into my cubicle, scaring the shits out of me while I'm doing what I need to do.   This is a female wasp.&nbsp; Meaning, it comes with a stinger! Many times I had to blow my ciggarette smoke at it to scare it away.   And this wasp was persistent.&nbsp; It's always there when I'm there.   I found out early last week the reason why she was there.&nbsp; She had formed a tiny combed nest inside the toilet paper dispenser.&nbsp; Today, I've found out that it has grown bigger!   Oh how many times have I reached in to pull paper from that dispenser!   Not wanting to scare any of you.. but here's a picture of how it looks like.&nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; urlLink

      I'm counting down to 6 too!!!   I've got an interesting weekend lined up...   With blurberber's recommendations, i'm picking up some melantonin from the drug store and will cross my fingers for a good night's sleep tonight.   For tommorow, i'll be visiting a relative of mine - somehow she's related to my Grandmother and she owns a pottery shop.&nbsp; I'll be getting my hands dirty and will try to learn the art from her.&nbsp; That will probably take up my entire day....  hmmm.. drinks tommor evening anyone?   Sunday...*drifting away*&nbsp;  Could be interesting day.&nbsp; An ex-neighbour of mine had invited me out for a boat trip with his friends.&nbsp; He mentioned that the group will consist of people whom I've met at the pub beside my place.&nbsp; I'm crossing my fingers for a particular guy to turn up.&nbsp; *butterflies*   Well, in any case, even without his presence, I'm sure i'll have a blast.&nbsp;  I'll just cross my fingers for some other hot bods!!! hehehe...  I'm definitely looking forward for some salty sea breeze on my face....ahhhh  astro : you just have to start going out on little adventures!  Take up&nbsp;projects to participate together. I'm sure there are many things that can be done, cheaply! picnic at botanic gardens, take a bukit timah reserves hiking trip, take a little&nbsp;junk boat out, visit some of our offshore islands...just to name a few.   See, the thing is, you can still have you dinner and sex but just at a different place!!   &nbsp;

      It's FRIDAY. The past two weekends were spent moping about loverboy or busting my ass over work. i'm done with that shite for THIS WEEKEND.   WHAT'RE YOU GIRLS UP TO?  bloop: i suspect it'll be another rockstar stakeout for you at a certain neighbourhood joint :p  boo: i'm having high hopes for you...*keeping fingers crossed*  blurberber: i suspect you'll be out on a date?   SIGH...it's tough to have a life outside the old ball 'n' chain. Being a creature of habit, how do you shake things up? SOMEBODY HELP ME!   Is it a bad sign if the things we share suddenly look very little?    me vs him swimming vs jogging rice/noodles vs low carb diet star wars vs star trek vodka vs whiskey frisky vs laying like a clam (metaphorical my dears! don't go running off with your w-i-l-d imagination...) subject to change vs stubborn leapard spots  my ex-colleague told me this over some oyster omelette yesterday: "You gotta try and have something in common besides sex and dinner right?"   This was in reference to my brother-in-law's botched attempt to take my sister diving on their 3rd wedding anniversary. My theory is that she fell sick on purpose. The trip got sabotaged and they went to Gold Coast yet again to sit on rollercoasters with fellow Singaporeans.   So what's more outside of the odd sleepovers?   This blogging thing is dangerous...especially when you don't feel like working!!! aaaAAAAAAHHHHHHHH...i rather do this than check my emails :p  Anyways, i'm counting down to 6pm - are you? ;-)

      In answer to boo's question over email about her boss lookin' cheery at work today...  yes last night was shing-a-shang-a-lang *coy look*   feels like i've been time warped back to our early dating days. So i'm on Cloud Ten for now, my honeyz...  Just when i erased his number from my phone book and thought it was over, the bugger smses me! This one's a mystery man. i asked him "i thought you said you take at least a week to stop bearing a grudge?" "i just said that to keep you on your toes!" grrrr....  So laydees, sad astro is no longer moping around. the weekend's comin' up and i'm already sniffing for some action.   as for blurberber - i agree...she's part of the Inverse Law of Dating. Boys who like you, you don't like them...the ones you like...always a big quesiton mark. i hear ya babes...it's not fair!   Love the pix on the blog. boo you rock!  And bloop - hang in there. dating a rockstar ain't easy, but you can do it!!

      i have been prodded (very hard) by my darling co-blogmistress boo to word in further detail about my recent juicy encounter...   sigh.   ok, well. ummm. not sure where to start but anyways, the current situation now - him and i are now still friends. getting closer, but not quite THERE yet. when we're hanging out together, it feels reaaaally good. he'd be really attentive, he shows concern like a bf would. one night when we hungout in a group all night, he never left my side. and we were leaning on each other all night despite a bunch of friends being all around us. but then everyone was quite drunk... so.   when we get asked to go somewhere, he'd turn to me and ask, "are u going? if u're not going, then i'm not". and he stuck with me till 11am the next day because i had to come to work.   i do like him alot. despite him being 3 years younger than me and is a musician who sings for his supper.   ok, so things are great when we meet up. but when we dont, he doesnt seem to initiate meeting up very much. well, ok he's done it once (last thurs) but i wasn't free. but i did suggest next thurs (this thurs ie). and besides that, he's been pretty low-key.   i'm pretty sure he's on my mind more than i'm on his. :P not good huh?   i can go rambling on about this... but not much really juicy bits to let on so far.... we're only at the hug-goodnight stage ok? i do like hugging him very much. does that count?   :)

      I was harassed by a weird-ass shit-face monkey...  &nbsp;  Sitting in KLCC, having my sashimi lunch and sipping my green tea away, I was waiting for Craig to swing by KL to pick me up to Singapore.&nbsp; Oblivious&nbsp;to people around me, I was totally relaxed and deep in thoughts till this shit-face, dirty looking young dude approached me and asked if he could sit in the next table.  &nbsp;  It was strange.&nbsp; There were a gazillion of tables at that cafe and this dude has to pick the one beside me!!!!  &nbsp;  "May I take this table?" he asked.  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;shrugged and nodded.&nbsp; What else could I say?  &nbsp;  He sat down, shuffles around a bit, turned to me again and asked, "May I have your number?&nbsp; Oei!&nbsp; Your number!&nbsp; Can I have your number!"  "Oei! Oee! Number number!"  &nbsp;  At first I thought I was hearing things cos he was kind of soft.  Shaking my head, I motioned him to go away.  &nbsp;  He left.  &nbsp;  But not for long.  &nbsp;  He came back... This time, he didn't asked if he could join me or to take that table, he just sat down beside me and looked at me from head to toe.  &nbsp;  and he whispers "Hey, your number.&nbsp; give me your number lah... oei"  &nbsp;  I asked the waiter for help.  &nbsp;  But this dude in turn asked the waiter to bring him a coke.&nbsp; As a paying customer, the waiter couldn't ask him to leave.  &nbsp;  I got to give it to him.&nbsp; He's got some brains.  &nbsp;  Anyway, he took his time to drink his coke while whispering to me.  &nbsp;  I could have left that cafe but I just didn't think I should be the one leaving,&nbsp; I liked that spot so, I just completely ignored him.  &nbsp;  I drew a sketch of him on my notebook.&nbsp; Occasionally he looked over my shoulders.  &nbsp;  When I was done,&nbsp;I smiled, flashed&nbsp;the sketch&nbsp;to him and I told him that I'll bring it to the police.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  He ran off.  &nbsp;  I don't know if it's&nbsp;my sketch that was that horrendous&nbsp;or he panicked cos I'd mentioned the police.  &nbsp;  Oh well.... *Shrugs*  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      hey chickadees! miss u all!  damn.. i've been absent from the blog for awhile aye? i'm still drowning in work but slightly more able to breathe now. thought i oughta check in briefly and give u babes a quick update!  ok, first things first. i'm over ngak. finished. done. over it. he mentioned something about not commiting for 4-5 years. that basically did it for me... and i've realised that ngak and i do not seem to carry on good convo's at all. and actually, ngak does not seem to carry on good convos with anyone in particular. hmm. well. he's still a cute boy. but i'm over it.  i think i'm on the brink of seeing someone. his name is terence and he works for apple, as channels manager. i didn't talk to him much despite knowing him for a coupla weeks, till we had a whole group outing on saturday night. and we got on so well, it was amazing. i must say that he's not the usual "look" i go for, but i'm rather sick of suave cute boys who think they're all that. terence has his own brand of charm... its the whole demeanor and confidence thing. hes the same age as me... actually, 9 days older. same year and star sign. haha. dragon scorpio. and he's so sooo sweet to me. he picked me up and sent me to work this morning! :o i'm impressed. and now hes just sms'ed to say he's dropping off a coffee for me at work. :o  will see when i can get photos in... hee.  welcome J!   ok... have to get going! will pop back in later if i have the time. trying to finish up my part time work, and wrap up my last bits of my earlier deadline. got another big deadline this saturday. urgh.  MWAH's to all!  ps. see youse at cocolatte. ;)

                Take a moment from work and try this out...          Picture yourself near a stream. Birds are softly chirping in the crisp cool mountain air. Nothing can bother you here. No one knows this secret place. You are in total seclusion from that place called "the world." The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with a cascade of Serenity.     The water is clear.        You can easily make out the face of the person whose head you're holding under the water.      Look.      It's the person who caused you all this stress in the first place. What a pleasant surprise!      You let them up, just for a quick breath. Then...ploop! Back under they go... You allow yourself as many deep breaths as you want.      There now... feeling better?

      It's hard to really sum up a place like Calcutta.   Nobody seems to go there for a holiday. In five days, i only saw a handful of overseas volunteers, seven british airways stewardesses and the odd wandering backpacker.   What you see is alot of poverty and filth. Assaulting your senses constantly are the stench, the blaring horns and most of all, the dreary landscape. the monsoon made it even more depressing - sloshy, muddy and muggy. The humid air made it hard to breathe. At every corner, there were the homeless lying on cardboard sheets and kids begging with eyes wide open with hunger.   I went to calcutta with three journalists, one photographer and two organisers. In our  bubble of aircon, we were driven to the slums everyday to visit former prostitutes and children of sex workers. It's hard to imagine who could live in the dirty wet hovels i saw.  For the first two days, I threw myself headlong into getting The Story. My editors reminded me again and again i had to get it no matter what. And so i did.   Initially, I felt numb to everything there. Basically, I recorded whatever i listened or saw, like a documentary maker. But after doing my job, it all sank in. Dangerous and unforgiving, this place has hardly any love for those who struggle.   I talked to a couple of former prostitutes and their stories were truly tragic. They all say they have no family but it's actually because they don't want to contact them ever again. They were sold into it by people who were supposed to love and care for them. It seems you can't trust anyone, not even your own family.  Virgin sex workers are most prized and go for as high as 10, 000 rupees (S$500). that's alot of money in india, i was told. if you're an old prostitute, you're only worth five rupees a session. Barely enough for some bread and dahl!   There's a huge fear of AIDS in india  so child prostitues are in great demand. the men who visit the brothels range from bureaucrats to cab drivers.  They even have these wickedly painful contraptions to stretch these girls' vaginas to make sex less painful for the men. What?! How about the pain these girls go through?   The red light district flashed glaring eyes at us foreigners toting our cameras but really, it hid tales of extreme pain and sorrow. we were strongly discouraged to visit india's biggest and most famous red light district - Sonagochi. Completely run by the mafia, we were told if we go there, they'll send us running back home with our balls in our mouths.   Though it was hard going emotionally, i was inspired by the counsellors over there who were passionate about helping these underserved people. I was there to help too and it made it easier.   Having said all this, I'll do it again. And again. There was the thrill of danger and excitement, plus it felt like meaningful work. I don't think my articles on relationships and men really have an effect on people, but hopefully, this one will make a difference...

      So...  The weekend is over. How was it for you girls?  whimsy: It sure was scary that we went into a drinking rampage. We literally went straight to the bar, ordered our bottle and slosh it all down in a wink! *blink blink*  i'm proud to say that i still got up for the driving range session, plus swimming, plus Paulo's exhibition and finally berber's screening of her film.  berber: from what i could see, i thought you did great in the film! you looked hot!  Many people asked me what I thought of the film that night. I couldn't really answer.  My viewing experience wasn't right to start off with. I was kinda disappointed with the set up. It was a fantastic venue with the right elements but if only the organisers had the brains to removed those balloons that were sticking out and blocking everyone's views. Perhaps, put in a little more effort to make the sound system sounding right and adjust the projection so that the constrast was set right?  Everyone could then watch the film and appreciate it rather than trying to figure out what they have missed. :p it's just uncomfortable for me to see that. I would have expect that they would have got that covered since they're from a production background.  Overall, I did feel that the film was light hearted and there were many funny parts that almost made me fall off my chair. So, for those of you who didn't make it to the screening, berber's got the dvd version. you should go watch it!!  astro: last night was really nice and chilled. sushhhiiii anytime babe! anyway, would really love to see your pictures from calcutta. Tell us moreeeeeee.....  bloop: met your deadline?  thought you looked zonked out on friday.

       Transience   I am both heartened and saddened by the idea of transience.  For the intensity of its nature lies in its very inability to last.  How cruel, that the essence of its beauty should lie in its fragility.  But I too, am comforted by this temporality: For its departure enables the entrance of new ideas, people, experiences, hope into our lives.  For as much as we wish it to be different;  The human vessel is not an infinite entity. It has to be emptied of some things, before it regains its ability to be filled again.  mww, aug04

      boo our webmistress is away doing her thang with laser beams and thumping music.   we've been talking alot about the martian species - insightful and some hilarious.  but i'll like to add my two cents' worth on Venus.   it's friday but it's like an attack of sunday evening blues - more misery is yet to come...  state of mind: light headed eyes: unfocused mood: crap legs: bloated by water retention tummy: ditto eyes: puffy boyfriend: very scared work: a mess  the effects of 'flow comes to town' are astounding. ok it's not my first time bleeding. but i've been on the pill for quite a while, and usually that treats you kindly - no zits, glowing skin, no cramps...like it didn't happen.   This is what i found on a website to dispel fears on having periods: On average, only about four to six teaspoonfuls of blood are lost during each period.   WOW - so little? i feel like i'm losing half a tank here!   driving on now...just needed to get that off me chest.  if i don't see you girls over the weekend - have a blast =)

      http://www.lovetactics.com/     According to Bertrand Russell, "Human nature is constructed so that it gives affection most readily to those who seem to demand it the least."  This being the case "and I assure you it is" then what hope can any normal human being who intensely craves love and affection have of winning the one they want?  Won't their very need for the other person be the thing that turns the one they want away from them?  The answer is "NO!" It is not the need for love, which all people inherently feel which drives others away from them, but it is their indiscretion about exhibiting that need.   What we need to learn is to make a distinction in our lives between the way we feel and the way we act! Or, in other words, we must learn self-control.  Not that we should suppress our emotions to the degree that we deny to ourselves what we are feeling. No, no indeed.  We should always realize and be honest with ourselves what we are feeling inside. But we must be discerning, discreet and wise about the things we know about ourselves, which we share with others.  Just because you find yourself desperately wanting someone, for example, doesn't mean you should act desperate. But neither does it mean you should try to deny the feeling in yourself. So you feel desperate! So what?! There's no shame in that. Join the club. Millions of wonderful, great, fantastic people who have lived long before you have felt this way. There's nothing wrong with wanting.  But what I warn you against is not trying to control the way you talk about it to others. You see, a dog should wag his tail, not have the tail wag the dog. And YOU are the one who ultimately controls your behavior, your emotions should not be doing that.  Remember when you were small and felt unhappy and upset about not getting your way? What did most of us do?  We would lie down on the floor and act out our emotions by beating our fists on the floor and kicking wildly. But when we got older we learned to put away childish behaviors and hold back, except in the area of romance.  What I'm saying is that we need to be mature in this area as well.  "But," someone cries out, "isn't it dishonest to not express what you feel?"  "No," I answer. "It's a simple matter of growing up."  The mature thing to do is to learn to distinguish between feelings and actions. Feel intently, deeply and honestly. But keep your behavior in check.  That person who keeps his behavior separate from his feeling ultimately commands the most respect, and love from others.  Remember how, as a child, you were instructed that if a big dog came rushing up to you, you must do your best not to show any fear?  The reason was that, if you show fear, it encourages the dog to bite you. Well, sadly, the same thing applies in human relationships.  If you tip your hand too soon that you're feeling vulnerable to the other person, then it actually invites them to emotionally burn you in some way. So act as brave as you can and keep your feelings to yourself.  The key thing to learn from Bertrand Russell's statement is that love is given to those who seem to least demand it.  Because the truth is we all need love "desperately" but we can overcome the built-in disadvantage by learning how to act.

      been in my boss' office all morning getting a pep talk!  apparently i have to throw my weight around more as the editor... i have been too "soft, nice and demure"!!  haha... well, basically he wants me to be a bitch. so that people dont mess around with critisizing the magazine.  but guess what? he doesn't realise that the things people say about the magazine are true... but the problem doesnt lie with my "image" obviously. we need a bigger team of at least more than ONE person to produce quality work. innit?  sigh.  anyways, enough of my work problems.  TONIGHT!!!! i will be at 116, yes. :)  not staying late either... i'm gonna be throwing myself into work full on and headlong. which also means getting in at 9am, and trying not to take cabs to work! astro babe... i think i'll get there 7ish or 8ish. will ring u to confirm!  i'm definitely up for korean beef dinner anytime! lets do it, chickadees!  :)  ps. boo...

      yes.  S chickened out and he didn't even call me about it.  most likely a deliberate attempt and am sure he isn't a 'nice' guy as he paints himself to be, else why would anyone just leave someone hanging and waiting?    the only thing that bugged me was that i was really looking forward to bbq-ing those beef and drink lots of sake!!  shall we all go there some day?  it really looks good!  i'm craving for RED MEAT!  anyway, i had a good night being at home. i've finished up all my mirror props for the gay party and i think they look great!  i'm finally back into my mirror gurl reputation.  so girls.... that means i could squeeze some drinks tonight!!!  what's the plan babes? I know bloop for sure is heading down to 116.  astro? u're following her?  whimpsie wants to head down to BQ bar?   hmmm... full of expats!  actually i wouldn't wanna risk bumping into my other neighbour - his studio is just above BQ bar. he's been inviting me to his parties and BBQs which each time i have convieniently forgot.  anywhere else?

       was rather good. :)      after watching a movie, dinner, and pool with val till past midnight, ngak and i went on to hangout at the middle road muslim food centre (middle earth) for teh tarik and some crappy prata. to my surprise, he suggested getting some beer from 7-11 if i could hangout abit more. it was raining, quite heavily too - but off we went, splashing through unsheltered junctions along the way. after corona and wild turkey were purchased, we parked ourselves on some metal chairs and a glass table outside a quiet hotel just opposite hotel81. the going-on's at hotel81 proved quite entertaining... we could see everyone going in and coming out. heh... the most dodgy ones were this buncha "queens" with one angmoh dude. 3 of them, very hot... but when we heard their voices drifting across to us across the road - woah.      so anyways, we talked. about everything under the sun. and sometime in the middle of it all, he asked if he could ask me a personal question.      "well, quite a number of people have been telling me this... is it true that u have a thing for me?"      i laughed and said, "who told u? how come so many people know?"      he couldn't quite remember exactly who, but nick and lina were included. i've never told nick or lina but i know that they would know. they woulda seen telltale signs. and they're both smart people. and they've seen ngak and i stay back late so often... besides, from the things that nick says, i already knew that nick knows. besides them, val has also told him the same thing.      then he carried on to say, "actually, i have a thing for u too."      i said, "really?" and just smiled. all this time he was quite bashful, and would only look at me once in awhile. though after this, he managed to look me in the eye and smile. then after a beat or two, he said, "but u do know my stand, right?"      "yeh, sally told me about it. "      "well, there's more to it actually." and he went on to explain that his previous (many) relationships have kinda ended the same way, and that the problem lies with him. none of the relationships he's had lasted more than one year. it seems to be a pattern happening all the time, and he doesn't want the same thing to happen again. so he's gonna try and change himself before going into anything with anyone.  "u're not disappointed or anything, are u?"      "nah, we'll just see how things go."      and he seemed happy with that answer.       we went on to talk till 6+am. i always seem to be doing crazy, irrational things with him around. sigh. before we parted, our goodbye hug felt tighter than usual. as i closed the door of the cab, he was beaming at me while peering in the window.      i went home, had a shower and went to work. it's amazing how i got through the day. i think a main factor which kept me up was the knowledge that he does like me too. :) at least now i know that he's not being nice to me just because he's the same with all the girls. and i feel much better now that he knows, and i know... and everything's out in the open.      i managed to convince my graphic designer kamil to share a cab home with me come 6pm. already started dozing in the cab... reached home at 7pm, my brother was in the shower so i went to lie down first. guess what? i slept all the way through to 3am, still in my office clothes. ate some leftover dishes (left for me) and went back to sleep till 930am. called in sick. then slept till about an hour ago. i think i will go sleep somemore in abit...      well, so the plan is to keep hanging out whenever, and see how it goes... :)

      Some of you probably already know that i'm working on some gay parties coming up this weekend.  Well, unfortunately there isn't any tickets I can give away at this point of time but it should be an event that will be FUN and is worth going.  Loads of yummilicious hot bods (Can See and Can Touch but don't expect any reaction from them)  Check out details at  urlLink http://www.fridae.com/nation/

      morning my dears, i must say i missed all of you loads!   penang was so-so. kind of like, flew there and didn't really "go" there? i was just in the shagri-la resort the whole time. Cosy and beautiful, this is def a place for honeymooners. i made friends with some crazy journalists - we had tons of beer and wine to drink for dinner. Many were hung over the next day when we had to catch the early morning flight.   I'm glad to be back!  Calcutta is my next destination for a work assignment. It's to explore prostitution there - a 5 day gruelling trip where i've to secure interviews with prostitutes (that other media are not interviewing). how am i going to do that? i don't know..but wish me luck. i'm super excited cos it's not just a product launch, but some real investigation!  the other reality that i'm facing is i'm seriously considering moving to OZ. I so want to do this but i'm scared shitless. i wouldn't say it's 100% confirmed but it looks that way. Had the BIG TALK with D...it's a lot more serious than the other times. Many things are swirling in my mind about this...let's just say it'll be the craziest thing i'll be doing ever...  bloop: would it be really hard to find a job there?   boo:  sorry i didn't call you. i really didn't receive your email on thurs. what did you end up doing?  sounds like bloop and ber had a great weekend partying.   looking forward to hearing from all of you =)
