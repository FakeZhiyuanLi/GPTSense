       I got home from camp yesterday, it was a ton of fun. In the beginning i admit i wasn't having the most fun but after the second day i was loving it. I met so many awesome people like Rob, Aaron, Ryan, Robby, and Jordan. The sessions were really great and i learned so much about myself and God. I'm so thankful i went to camp i think it really changed me. I had so many firsts at that camp lol ... my first time doing a Chinese Firedrill, my first all-nighter, my first time really sneaking out. I had so many fun times at camp.. we played kick the can with all of the guys one night and jesse sprained her toe and i stepped on a pine cone lol. Then another night the guys had us over for hamburgers and set up candles lol it was so cute!!! Then after dinner they invited us to play putt-putt so we went and got bored.. so we ditched them. Afterwards we felt awful so we made them a lil card and stuck it on their door lol we try. The first night we snuck out we thought we saw a hurst. We all got so freaked out, we were screaming and ran back to the condo. The next day one of the guys lifted the cover over the hurst and it turns out it was a staion wagon! We hardly ate at camp, we were always running low on food and running to Walmart haha good times. At one point we were running on tap water because we had run out of any other kind of drink, so we raided the guys' room and tried to steal their gatorade. We almost had it but then the guys ended up carrying us out of their room. One night we stole Robby, Jordan, Aaron, and Ryan's shoes. We had soo many fun times i will never forget that trip.&nbsp; Wow there's so much to write i think i'll stop now i may go back and add a few more things later.&nbsp;
