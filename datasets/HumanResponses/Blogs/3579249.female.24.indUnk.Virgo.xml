      This is the day I choose to be The queen For the king I await My Lord   No more self-betrayal No more speeding up Please stand still my child Know I have a plan  This is the day I become the Woman For the man that I await To sweep me off my feet My Lord   I want to be in love I’m yearning to be loved But I know I must heal And become whole again  I want breakfast in bed And long walks in the park But I know I must wait  He will come just in time My Child  Men will come and go But which one will last Not just in the bed But inside your heart?  They will wine and dine To get what they want But why waste your time With bogus passion?  Wasted emotions Worn out energy What will you have left When the king arrives?  Exhausted you’ll be Bitter you will feel Ugly you’ll become Will he want you then?  Slow down pretty one Save your heart for him While you waste your time He might pass you by  No more wasting time Looking for drama Remain calm for once Remember my plan    This is the day I choose to be The wife For the husband I wantMy lord

      My mind enforces indifference Forbidding me to take a chance   With a total stranger that I’ve known forever Who proclaims his longing to be my lover Unless the red light of our closeness  Begins to flash in front of my self-protective glasses  My heart forces me to cross speedily  By any means necessary    Am I selfish?   My body experiences an aspiration  Every time we share a conversation For you to look absorbedly into my eyes As your black body brushes horizontally against mine  Only then will you see my pure feelings about you and me Come closer and look deeper so you can see How I wish we could fly far away from here To another life where we could be free   Am I crazy?    The way you caress my soul Takes me out of control You penetrate into my spirit  In way that I can’t explain it  Every engagement leaves a satisfaction  That fills my essence up with more desperation    You leave me with a sensation so surreal That I’m full of guilt for the way I feel   Am I confused?   Like an addict hooked on morphine  I found something that turned me into a phene      Had I controlled my doses at the beginning I wouldn’t be sitting here crying Searching for a way to escape this state of contradiction That has caused a separation  Between my mind body and soul   Will I be ok

      He’s beautiful Wonderful A love that’s plentiful  I’m wicked  Twisted  Because my heart is wounded  His love So strong For a weak girl like me  It’s touch So powerful It pushes me  To the border of insanity And infidelity  My insecurity Blurs my clarity With illusions of lust Lost of trust   I’m so confused What if I lose That one I always dreamed of The one to teach me how to love  Before our first kiss I never even thought his kind exist  He walked right out of a fantasy And it’s driving me crazy  I don’t know how to act Cause I’m so used to being attacked His actions stand behind good motives But I’m always on the defensive  He’s caring Understanding Patient Damn he’s excellent  I can’t let my wounded heart Tear this great love apart Cause I’ll be damned If I mess up such a good man

      Now you trippin’ What you been smokin’? When I gave you my heart You tore it apart Offered you my soul You crushed it with your dirty toes  Invaded my mind and body Stole my virginity Left my body wrecked  After taping nasty labels all over me:  Twisted  Wicked  Crooked   You told me to hold My life went out of control  Impatient Discontent Yet I was afraid to pick up the other line  He was magnificent  Offered my life a reviving scent  But I couldn’t get you out of my mind  You left me waiting While the phone kept ringing You came back to tell me you had a wife And I had to get on my with life   Stressed Depressed Obsessed   I should have cut off your dick  When I had the chance Now I’m too fucking weak To do the devil’s dance  You dropped me like a nuclear bomb  Cause you put a baby in her womb  Although I have the temper of a cyclone  That could crush your bone  I left you alone  Cause you had a wife And I had to get on with my life  All your boys said man that’s wrong You been with her since she was young And she’s an angel What are you gonna do with this hoe? But she had bigger breasts And unlike me she’d take it up the ass So you create a new fable And cover my body with new labels  Dyslexia  Schizophrenia  Hysteria   But I went on with my life Since you had a wife Got rid of the knife You ain’t worth all this strife   Everyone now realize That your words are full of lies You sucked my blood like Dracula And ran away with medusa Left me to die you split my membranes Freed the dogs to eat the remains   Twisted  Wicked  Crooked  I got picked up by a Good Samaritan Took me to his home and a new life began  After all these years You mysteriously reappear  Talking about you want me back Man you must be on crack  Oh you found religion? Your God’s no longer your pijon? You’re not happy your wife? And wanna be in my life?  You feel lonely without me? Poor baby!  Stressed Depressed Obsessed   Don't you have a wife? Get on with your life!  You said I was dyslexia  But that rumor didn’t last  For everything I spit on turns into gold  And since babyhood my psyche was fast   Then you called it schizophrenia Yes fuck with me I can show you a crazy bitch  I’ll cut your throat and dump it in a ditch  But Normally I am tranquil and collected  As long as I don’t feel disrespected And my womanhood’s protected  You wont have to be dissected   You thought I wouldn’t make it And married her tough everyone seen her naked  But my love is divine  And everything I start Makes it first in the finish line Now you’re the acting all hysteria  Cause I don’t wanna to be with ya  I don’t have time for your tricks Click!

      As a child my brain was attacked Had me shaking like a somebody on crack I could hear but couldn’t talk back And my mind was lost in track  They blamed it on this lady Who my dad drove crazy Her motive was jealousy Cause she wanted to have my daddy’s baby  Imagine a child growing up in terror Of a woman who at night changes color I was traumatized  By my own fear I was hypnotized  Imagine losing recollection Of your very own action And life’s important ceremonies  Yesterday dies next to your memories   I was frightened and stressed  Everyone thought I was possessed  Because my actions came out more defiantly  And the attacks became more frequently   There was a so-called priest  Who claimed that he could kill the beast  By giving me a bath and throwing a feast  But dad’s wisdom was already in the east   Being the seed of an intellectual And one who is connected to the spiritual My father spent hours doing research As my mother made prayer requests  At 9 a major attack wiped out my vocabulary For a year I wasn’t ambulatory  My father called it epilepsy And tried to recover my memory   While kids my age were doing mathematics I had to deal with being an epileptic And learn how to supervise my mind And sort out reality and fantasy when combined   I tried to seek therapy And found it in poetry I kept stacks of diaries Where I preserved my selves and my memories  I learned quick And started playing mind tricks  With myself and those who thought they were slick But I was always real when I grabbed my paper and bic   I made a discovery That I am from a land where science is a mystery  I found myself and my cure I found out what was true Between my own lines Inside my own rhymes  I learned that my biggest attacks  Came from fear of being attacked So the disease quickly disappeared As I shocked and chased away my fear  I learned that my biggest enemies  Were those telling me to beware of enemies I belonged to God before my birth No voodoo spell could me away from this earth   I learned not to listen to society When they tell me that I’m crazy It’s not your self that they really want you to reveal When they ask you to be real So I can only try to be me Whoever that may be I keep my head up with pride Being anyone but yourself is the worst form of suicide  Now I am an advocate for epilepsy A sickness feared by my society A malfunction that makes me ridiculously creative  Since I learned to unwind and remain positive

      The Revolution  Is not growing locks Or going natural Pretending to be connected To the ancestors And the spiritual  While you’re not in harmony With yourself and your brothers and sisters Who are with you here in the flesh And your feelings are all physical  The revolution  Is not dropping knowledge  From left to right When you lack wisdom   It’s not knowing your history When you carelessly let it repeat itself  While building your kingdom  The revolution Is not using the white man As a scapegoat for you laziness   It’s not leaving your responsibilities In the hands of Jah After making a mess  The revolution Is not talking about love  And sisterhood When you walk pass the  Girls from the hood Looking up as if you’re better And never been there  Like your youth was a piece of cake And you didn’t learn from your mistakes So you can’t relate since you have no wounds You make them feel wrong Instead of guiding them to surpass So one day the laugh at the past   The revolution Is not touching others with false intentions Giving them the impression That you are connected to your ancestry And that you realize the African beauty  So you tell me I’m beautiful  But your thoughts are more powerful Because I can feel your self hatred And the negative vibe that your mind directed  The revolution Is not violence Against the enemy or self Because many times we don’t know the difference Since we are all the same  It’s not bloodshed  Because my blood is yours When you hurt me The cries fly all the way to the motherland And drive our mother insane  The revolution Started before Jesus It lies in the subconscious  You can’t wear consciousness It’s not the way you dress   The revolution Starts at the cleansing of your mind And grows with positive thoughts It takes longer to reach than the distance to Africa But it’s so close, deep inside your heart It is the greatest detox It stings and cleanses better than Clorox  But how you gonna start a revolution When your mind suffers from pollution? Like your head, the country will remain a mess Unless you reach into yourself and confess It’s not that our people are not blessed But our minds are possessed If you don’t clean up the garbage in your head We will keep hanging on a thread

      The headache pounds my soul As the tears of my heart Keep burning my eyes I’m struggling to catch my breath Fighting the pain on my chest   Every conversation Ends with frustration Miscommunication Leads us to destruction  It hurts More than the pain in my chest That you can’t see That you are just like me That you can really be free If you’d just forgive Those that did nothing but give Their lives, their hearts and money Just to see you happy  It hurts More than the pain in my chest That you can’t really understand What it means to be like gods and kings You leave me in awe with your word  Your talent and creativity is beyond this world You are so beautiful, so powerful Makes me feel awful That you use destruction Rather than construction To lead my people who are sinking with exasperation  Drowning with exhaustion  I am diagnosed with depression  From thinking how your love is so strong That you can heal the whole nation  I offer you my love and devotion My heart never sees you wrong But the pain is getting so strong Which is why I am writing this song  Every communication Ends up a miscommunication I try to understand But there’s always a misunderstanding I try to impress you But you get the wrong impression All my actions Give you a bad reaction  And puts me in a stage of non-reaction  I can’t sleep, I can’t function I transform into a zombie I can’t feel tough I can see  I can’t speak tough I can hear  Can’t breathe The pain I can’t bear  I spend hours in my bed With this ache pounding my head   I Lift my hand up to the sky I know that God hears my cries If I could just touch you and reach This time I promise I wouldn’t preach  I would explain How my heart was wrapped up by resentment and pain Which is why you couldn’t feel The force of my love, but it’s real  So much confusion But we are still a great fusion Connected by our spirits, our genes, and ability In moments of sadness and poverty We remained partners The toughest brothers and sisters  Please brother understand Nothing in my heart has changed I still love and respect you like my king I am pleading for your mercy and forgiveness  Please let’s clean up this madness Why every action Why must I get the wrong reaction?  Do you know how much I love you? My life is senseless with out you.  Can’t you feel how much I miss you? I wake up every morning to write you Can’t you understand how I adore you? My life is highlighted by yours.  Can’t you sense my admiration for you? Your resistance only makes me respect you.   Please, every conversation Let’s dead the confrontations From miscommunication  Which lead to frustration  Let’s water our emotions Through our passions And mutual admiration   Please, try to understand  My every action I have one intention To make a demonstration Of my love and admiration.   I love you!

      I asked my sister What will you do When you run out of polish To color the bruises on your toes When there’s not enough Covergirl For the blues of your soul Or that sexy black dress Won’t absorb the ugliness inside And let it show   My sister wants to be a butterfly But she won’t take time To care for what’s inside My sister knows she could die But he calls her a dime So she hops on his ride  She buys her wings from a guy named Kim She really can’t fly But she sure looks fly  Nothing even matters cause she’s with him He whispers something lethal in her ears Now she can’t hear her soul’s cries Or the gods up in the sky Crying on bended knee Trying to make her see  That she was born to be a butterfly If she would only take her time Now she’s about to die And she doesn’t have a dime  I’m laying on her deathbed With my head next to my sister’s head Listening to her last breath As she reaches the last stage of her death Which began since she became deaf And couldn’t hear her own soul Poor me I didn’t know I was just taking my first steps How I wish I could have helped  Now my sister’s dead And my tears won’t stop flowing I kiss her forehead Hoping her soul will stop burning I’m building this guilt from within How could I not have seen her pain? Wishing I did things differently Wishing I kissed her more gently Wishing I never called her a whore But I couldn’t see her spirit so tore  All she ever wanted was to be a butterfly But she wouldn’t take her time So she forced herself to fly Gave herself less value than a dime  Now my sister’s gone Trying to be somebody’s clone My sister’s gone Not realizing what she’s done My sister’s gone Leaving me two kids to own My sister’s gone And I feel so alone My sister’s gone But through my breath she lives on

      The day you let me go You said you wanted us grow We both needed to be free I had no choice but to agree Although I felt abandoned  Everything we’ve done was undone  Every emotion became numb Afraid to see what we will become  You declare your love remains true But this love I could not construe  How can you leave my heart out in the cold? Yet claim my love to you is worth more than gold? How can you look at me and not want my body? And continue to say you are taken away by my beauty?  How can you leave me alone, and rest in solitude? But say at my presence you feel gratitude?  I tried to understand But this was not something I planned You said you needed to become a man You wanted to be complete before we can start again You wanted to be more in love than in need You wanted to see both of us succeed  But our issues held each other back Because we piled them on a stack  I couldn’t understand All this time, is this something you planned? What was the point of being a part? When we belonged to each other’s heart? What was the point of letting go? After making a vow years ago Why postpone? Why must I learn to be alone?  Now I understand This is something that God planned The day you left I couldn’t believe the way I felt  I was needy I was greedy I was hopeless without your attention I was incomplete without your affection  Now I understand  That your love is so grand You fought to teach me life’s greatest lesson You suffered to make me a better person We had to make a sacrifice Now it feels so nice After weeks crying, venting and blaming you I learned to love you more with out needing you

      Tonight I dedicate To no one else but you I will not go out and celebrate A freedom that is past overdue  Let my friends be upset Because I drown in solitude at home I will not break a dance or a sweat For my feelings have become numb    Tonight I dedicate To the one that makes my heart sing It is your special day And happiness I wish I could bring Before I got to know you There was already a connection I have fallen in love with you Because in you I find my reflection  Tonight I dedicate To you my only love My love for you is so great It is something undreamed of I wish we could be together I want to be with you everyday  I wish I could protect you And take all your troubles away   Tonight  To you I dedicate It feels so right Your happiness I await  Since the first day we truly met I fell in love with your language I couldn’t believe how I felt As I found your beauty in every page  Every word out of your mouth Like the gospel I adore Everywhere from north to south I see a beauty I can’t ignore  Your moves So powerful they take me back in time As I groove With those who have long died   The more I get to know you The more I understand you The more I am connected with you The more I feel the pain with you  The more I fall in love with you The more I wanna be with you The more I wanna defend you  The more I wanna rescue you  Tonight To you I dedicate Let the candles light My love for you I celebrate And the souls that have burnt For a cause that seems lost Let the incense burn For those who fought without exhaust    Tonight Just for one day I wish they’d stop the fight I wish they could understand That you want us to join hand They don’t respect that it’s your big day So busy fighting they push you out of the way  For a change I wished they’d use their head To break the cycle so we move ahead  Sometimes I can’t stop crying Sometimes I want to stop trying Because of the mental pain I feel like loving you is in vain I would give my life as a sacrifice  I would pay any price To see a smile in your face I would be happy in my resting place  I love you Happy Birthday

      Lord I feel blessed To be a witness Of my total destruction And re-creation Into what I wanted to be And what I wanted to name ME  I am good and evil The face of God and the devil But I will choose the level And shut the door upon the arrival Of my “bad” side And let my goodness ride  I am weak and powerful I am ugly and beautiful I am physical and spiritual Superficial and natural Sad and happy Sane and crazy Soft Tough I am hate and love I am down and above I am Not Marleen and Marleen I am a servant and a Queen I am a Slave and a Master I am a fighter and a Lover  I am wrong and right I am darkness and light  My whole being Is Everything But the only difference Is which I choose to experience Powerful Beautiful Spiritual Natural Happy Crazy Soft Tough Love Above Marleen Queen Master  Lover Right Light  As human beings We are everything The only difference Is which we choose to experience Each pair lives deep inside Up to you do decide Which to become on this life’s journey I choose what makes me feel free  I try to do what is natural Not just because it is normal Although there is no guarantee That life would be more easy But my soul is happy Chose at your own discretion  What you like for your soul’s transportation Really, it doesn’t matter your decision After all they are just illusions

      My resolution Will start from within A revolution With self I begin Cleanse the pollution Instilled in my brain Total destruction Of the mental chain Elimination  Of mind assassin  A new plantation  Of good seeds ingrained Make all correction Of my wrongdoing  No more consumption From users called friend But conservation He I find open  Lose recollection Of those who have sinned True absolution To those that caused pain  Memorization  For never again Full distribution  To those in chagrin  No persecution  He is from my kin My contribution Shall not go in vain  My beloved nation Freedom it shall gain  Full concentration  On divine growing  And education Till in my coffin Reincarnation And I'll start again The evolution Has truly began

      You laugh cause I’m different  And call me insane  I laugh cause you’re no different  Than the rest yall the same  In a world filled with confusions  Your mind creates illusions  Misinterpretations  Misconceptions  That cover your third eye  And make you blind  Force your consciousness to fly  And live outside your mind   Mentally wounded  Spiritually retarded  Physically corrupted  You seek the truth  You wanna grow like a fruit  And cleanse the deception of your own  society  The fabrications of your own mentality  You wish for a third eye that is healthy                                      But as the truth touches your wounded mind  The pain makes you wanna fight   You run away from the light  Because it is too bright  Your soul wants you to shine  But the fear puts you in a line  With the rest  That can’t see that they are blessed  Can’t feel the touch of God’s caress  Rather be oppressed  And cry against injustice  But the world is full of justice  If you want it you can find peace  Just listen a little clearer  Look a little closer  Touch a little softer  Laugh a little louder  Wait a little longer  What you seek is not over there  But over here  Not out there  But IN here  Bring it out  Without a doubt  You will find  A peace of mind  As it reunites  With your soul to ignite   The internal creativity  And universal reality   Tools for finding the truth  And the real you

      It’s a curse  Every chapter every verse Another battle Another struggle A higher level Removing labels Climbing the mountain To the road of enlightenment  African Warrior Female Survivor Haitian Soldier  Yeah whatever  I’ve lost four lives and fifty pounds As I knock the evil spirits down  My size drops to a zero While fighting my flaws like a superhero Living like there ain’t no tomorrow  And chasing away all my sorrows  I keep my life in present tense Learning from past experience But God when will it stop? When my heart finally drops? If my heart wasn’t attached It would have already been dispatched  From my body to the floor  Going from door to door Harassed like a whore Or a homeless by the shore  I guess I should feel lucky For these trials bring surety  Of a less delirious maturity  And a delicious eternity

      I wish I’d just die But I’m too much of a coward I know mama would cry But she’d get over it afterward I pray to God to do me the favor Since I’m too lazy to get the knife But he’s trying to play savior And refuses to take away my life He made it loud and clear When he turned Sleep against me Now I have to face with fear Since I said I wanted to be free I’d run to sleep, addicted Till he slammed the door at my face Treating me like a whore, an evicted Calling me names, what a disgrace Now I’m stuck in a bright room Face to face with reality Stripped me of my costume Smiling like he’s about to hurt somebody

      I’m taking my freedom Re-building my queendom Protected by a garden of self-esteem With positive seeds to grow into my dream All Self-inflicted hatred  Successfully uprooted  Faith and self-confidence Watered daily to enhance My perception of love and truth Instead of hiding behind a booth I see through my window A world that runs a positive flow What I see is what I get Not one delusional threat  Rituals of self-love Each day take me a step above My mind is active Not passive And inactive Or reactive  Pushing the body to stay alive And struggle to survive A beauty That’s not just sexy But healthy Now the soul is happy No more cries We see I to I Using intuition To give me direction For once I am the same the level with my spirit It’s a great feeling tough I can’t explain it I am becoming who I wished to be And loving the sweetness of being free

      Dear God Don’t find it odd If today I’m on my knees Begging you to appease  This commotion in my heart That is tearing me apart  My soul revolts against the anarchy In my mind slaughtering my body Breaking me down into bits and pieces Forcing to have a pre mid life crisis  I get up only to fall again and again Put myself together just to crumble in pain  I see my value Yet refuse to live by what is true To the unworthy I act worthless  Keep giving my heart to the heartless Becoming the chaser of my follower Hoping that the hater would become my lover  Dear God Don’t you find it odd That I’m on my knees Begging you to please Show me another way So my mind won’t go astray     God I’m asking you for the strength To let go of the past and be present Lord today I need the clarity To see that in me there is nothing but beauty Father give me a doze of confidence And allow me to grow from each experience  Lord in my mind please imprint your rules Embed in my heart all of your sacred tools To allow me to accept all of life’s trials   With opened arms and a grateful smile I know the bumpy roads of this journey Are for me to be thankful when I’m finally free

      I could see the pain My emotions dropping Slowing like the rain Crazy thoughts Taking over my brain Turning my pretty smile Into an ugly frown Cause I want to be with you You silly clown But deep inside I know That I deserve a crown  My body’s screaming  Oh yessssssss To the thought Of your finger’s gentlenesssss That brings me temporarily An exuberating happiness  But my mind so strong Refuses to live in denial She sits in silence But knows when you lie And detain my worth To put her in a trial   Let’s be real Can you really make me happy? Or am I just Another local party For you to play with And drop down her panty Tell me Can you penetrate into my intellectual? I want you to set my body free But can you satisfy my spiritual I’m not being needy But I am more than just a physical  Like a queen  In my own queendom I shall not dare  Touch your freedom To wonder freely  In your kingdom But let us dance To the beat of this experience Let us build a good alliance I don’t want to battle Cause I hate to struggle And I will not settle  Play with my body Not with my mind Explore all of my three dimensions And you will find There is a lot in me to be discovered I am not of any kind You know… You can lick me from head to toe Cause the real challenge is to bring joy To my mind and my soul

      Across the mirror I could see clearer A reflection of I Which could not be denied Twisted mind and locs Always outside the box Untouched Eyebrows Like my soul that browse My body of perfect imperfections Removing my unlimited limitations   Dazzling eyes like my brain  Revealing my joys and pain A nose as big as the richness of my heritage One sniff will free you from your mental cage You’ll fall in love with me and my culture  And find yourself in a state of rapture  My smile, as powerful as a vodou charm Will brighten your life and never do harm    Across the mirror I could see clearer The concept of God Which is no longer odd  You don’t need biology To understand that your body Is made of different life forms Which on their own perform Different functions to keep you alive Your little cells they give you life You don’t need theology To find your divinity You are a cell from God’s body Together we embody  The greatest king The most powerful kin    When we join our forces we become omnipotent We are all over the world and we are omnipresent Our knowledge put together makes us omniscient Damn together we could be magnificent

      It’s ridiculous I’m neither Jesus  Nor a genius But I am conscious To see who infect us  With the poisonous That turns our own enemy into us If it’s not jealous  Or envious It’s rebellious  We can hardly focus It’s like a virus   Inherited from the womb Causing us mental wound Lost souls running around Longing to be found  Beauty covered underground Forgets the richness of her background    Forgets the value of her crown She lets them treat her like a clown Once renowned but now unknown  Since forsaken by her own  She lets them keep her down So she can wear the evil’s gown  And live as a charade That looks like a masquerade It wasn’t like that before the trade We used to value what was homemade  Victims of a mental crusade That let them persuade Into believing we can’t escalade Because we’re of a darker shade  So we live the vicious cycle The wounds continue to recycle The sick calling each other psycho For no reason drive each other loco We don’t need a miracle To get out of this obstacle  Stop running in circles Hold hands to form a circle  And we will break the cycle  Yo! Somebody scream Ayibobo!  If you really want freedom Put the love back in your kingdom Know you are not here by random Live by your ancestors great wisdom Not the contemporary Sodom  Value your sisters daily, rather than seldom  Together we can restore our mother’s queendom

      To all religion I say no All that bullshit has to go Back  On track Where all was perfect God wasn’t just a concept Of the powerful She was beautiful In Him was no wrath You lived your own path  Without Christianity And hypocrisy With no Islam And bomb slam No Voodoo And taboo   No complexity Just simplicity    No illusion Of separation With his creations And them We couldn’t condemn Since they are just like us We’d embrace justice  To be humane Was not considered insane  No need for another cult I say we all revolt Burn down the church And start to search For Who We Really Are Knowing God is never far Just begin From within And your love Will manifest the One above

      Before I am an African Before I am a Haitian  Before I am a Woman Before I am a Sistren  I am a being that runs free On lifelong journey Trying to go back  To my original state Where simplicity  Dominates And it doesn’t matter No one really cares If you’re African or not If you’re Haitian or not If you’re a woman or not A sister or not

      Africa’s blood runs through my veins Her tribal marks all over my face Years of brainwashing in vain Because she’s with me place to place Yes I am an African I am a Haitian Whose beauty has been mystified Mentality colonized Her spirit mortified But I still leave you mesmerized With the richness of my culture After years eaten by vultures  They broke the chains of my spirit But never will they destroy it The pieces are everywhere From Egypt to Nigeria To Brazil to Delaware To Cuba and Jamaica Centuries of tradition hidden in my drum Ages of Wisdom written in my song But you pretend to be dumb And say to you this does not belong See no evil Hear no evil Says the devil Yes, I am a Haitian I am a woman You forget that I’m a queen Since you forgot that you’re a king You only want what’s in my jeans Forget we’re both from the greatest kin Your sense of beauty is an illusion Your idea of success is reverse   Because the corruption of your vision Had made you make your life adverse    Society is causing you pain And you believe that you’re not able But only you can break the chain Start by becoming mentally stable Your fathers started technology and philosophy The first who invented mathematics and religion But somewhere we got weak and lazy As our inventions spread and grew in every region Re-member Africa Not by starting another group By remembering who you are And we will magically regroup Know that I am you and you are me When you do me you do you Know we will be free When we re-member what is true The enemy is no longer them It is WE Let us vow never again And start watering our mother’s tree

      It’s been two years  Since I shed those tears  Been so long ago  Since we let it go  I sank in fear  Watching your love reappear  Only to disappear  Right before my eye  I wanted to die  I kept fighting to move on  But my heart keeps holding on  To feelings that caused me nothing but pain  And sacrifices that went down the drain  In vain  I’d rather die than be with you again  But whenever I come home  I feel so alone  This loneliness  Causing so much stress  Your abuse used to fill up my heart  Now this emptiness is tearing me apart

      Would love to love you And call you my boo The king of my heart Till death do us apart  I would love to love you Take away your blues Caress your mind, spirit and body Bring joy your whole entity   I really want to love you A way that’s real and true Would love to be your partner And have the greatest love affair  I wish I could love you The way you want me to But my heart covered with chains That lock me up and say never again  I’m afraid to love you So you don’t break me into two I may be mentally agile But my heart is so fragile  I could never love you Tough your touch makes me feel new I deserve your undivided attention I’m a woman I need affection   I don’t want to love you You stepped over me with your shoe After giving you a taste You made me feel like a disgrace  Would rather die than love you My wounds you’d only renew You say what we have will never end But can’t even treat me like a friend  Would love you love you And call you my boo  I would love to love you Take away your blues   I really want to love you A way that’s real and true  I wish I could love you The way you want me to  But I’m afraid to love you So you don’t break me into two I could never love you Tough your touch makes me feel new  I don’t want to love you You’d step over me with your shoe Would rather die than love you My wounds you would only renew

      Every night I fall asleep It’s you that I see Holding me, Caressing me Till I fall asleep  In your caring arms I become free Free of every thought That cause me pain  Living in this dream I wonder if my life Is real  Every morning I wake up Is saying goodbye To my greatest fantasy And hello to life  Which has since become Such a nightmare Makes me want to run Back to my dream Just to be with you I’d give up everything to sleep  These tears keep falling Cause I know you will never Become real  My heart stopped hoping For promises I know you never made to me  But I can’t stop reminiscing On false memories  That make Me feel So good  Now I’m standing On the other side All alone No one in this world Loves me The way that you do  I pray that one day You do break free Outside of my mind And become real For me to feel loved In this world Even if it’s just for one night

      When I walk down the street  You won’t find the little girl  From the lost and found  With no direction  Hoping to be discovered  I’ve recovered  &nbsp;  And promoted to a queen  I’ve transformed into a woman  You can see my magnificence&nbsp;&nbsp;  From the crown on my head  To the fullness of my lips  And hips  &nbsp;  As solid as my self-esteem  The costume of a king alone  Will not impress me  Test me you’ll be the one failing  My sense of smell got ridiculous  And miraculous  &nbsp;  Since I declared my womanhood  Turned away from self betrayal  And chose a path of self-love  The wounds started to heal  From outside to withinAnd freedom began

      I could feel them coming. I got dizzy and my head was spinning. Of course I tried to stop them. I started running around like a mad woman  I tried to grab on to something firm. I kept my eyes wide open. The whole world started moving away from me The darkness was moving towards me I tried to scream for help but it was too late They had already taken over my voice  Only nothingness could come out of my mouth The darkness was getting closer But I was ready to fight them, once again I wasn’t going to die, again My eyeballs were ready to pop out I tried to grab something, or someone But everything, and everyone was running away from me The darkness was so close I can feel it moving with me I tried to scream Nothing “Somebody help me, I’m going to die!” I wanted to scream Nothing Everyone looked but wouldn’t touch Let alone help I wouldn’t give up I suddenly fell on the ground I fought to get up But they held my hands on to the ground I tried to kick But they tied my feet on to the ground “Manman” I tried to scream Nothing I wanted to call for my mother But she was nowhere to be found Just keep your eyes opened I said to myself They will only get you if you close your eyes Keep them wide open But my eyes got tired I could feel it I am going to die, again My eyes died a slow painful death  I found myself racing with the darkness In a twilight zone I kept falling and falling and falling  I guess I died again

       If every year I’m not at the konpa fest With my blue and red dress Shaking my ass To the rhythms of Haiti’s best Does that put my pride to the test? Is my Haitianness Any less I live like an American But I’m not like the Jafakens That finds it a task To put a mask Over my culture’s richness And sell it to the press It is pride or is it shame? It is stylish or just lame? To wear my flag over your head When you don’t respect the dead That lost their lives to give you this flag You’d rather brag Or point the finger to the indifferent When you yourself aren’t that different To be Haitian is more than representin’ Especially when you are misrepresenting A culture that is rich and profound Trying to pass her for a different one How can you make them understand? When you yourself can’t comprehend Embrace her in every way Cherish her beauty everyday Then you can start representing Rather than pretending

      The pain Is back again Never left my brain But transformed Into false emotions That I transferred Making blind selections To any man who’d accept Since I felt like a reject This pain so powerful It makes any beast beautiful The biggest slaughterer Becomes the greatest lover This pain Rides me like a stallion Changing faces like a chameleon Perpetrating my emotions Illusions That hurt my wound That has grown Any touch Makes me rush Shaking for a fix Like epileptics This pain Has turned me to every drug But it’s nothing but a bug That causes my mental script to go crazy If I’d just stop being so lazy And fix the bug ruining my program And reprogram My brain Delete all this pain And reformat the remains My wouldn’t be ruin God gave me the equation I know the solution Take any negativity and subtract Then it’s not you they will attract Self love added to self respect You must have what you expect Take self-esteem and multiply Then you’ll really be fly Your problems let them divide Then in yourself you will find the divine

      Retired Sick and tired  Running to these men Again and again  For quick fixes Lethal kisses From battle of the sexes Cause me to be restless  Damaged  By false promises And deceitful kisses I’m so discouraged  Impaired By illusions I ignore my real emotions And keep them covered  Dumped Wounded and stumped Yet I jumped  From one bootycallship To another whatevership Not facing my troubles Covering my evils I’m in deepened dent  So what they press on the dent  In my fragile heart That from the start Wanted to be a part  Of the greatest love story Ever written in history  But I got lost in his story And forgot about His glory  My mind is always ready Steady And Clear Yet full of fear Of facing my greatest enemy Which is me  Tired But inspired To uncover The Divinity That dwells in me For divine guidance At giving love another chance
