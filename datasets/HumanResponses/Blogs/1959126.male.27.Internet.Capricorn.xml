      Well  Kate,  I am making this blog so that at any given time I can tell you things that I think you might want to read about in the future hehe.  I know you might never read through all of them  but you can look here and there and maybe, just maybe, you will pick up a bit of wisdom.  Well  since this is the first post. . it is going to be a test to see if it is working right.

      Today you went swimming for the very first time.  We got you all slicked up with 2 pounds of sun screen just like all good newly born parents do when their kids first go swimming.   Anyway,  We grabbed Conner  and we headed to the Hampton house.  We drove the 30 seconds from the house to the pool and you were asleep in the car seat.  That was not what we wanted you to do.  But apparently you were tired.  hehe  Good thing we didn't care.  We yanked you out of the seat and took you swimming anyway.     How was the pool you ask?  It was um.. crowded.  Since it was the 2nd day it was open for the summer.  It was very crowded, I think we got the last table in the place and it was over in the kiddy pool area, and it was a reject table.  All wet, leaning umbrella, and ripped up chairs.  Of course, we didn't go to the pool to sit around.  We went to toss you into the pool.    Like the wizened old parents we were, we got all ready to swim and took you out into the big pool and started walking around with you..  Big Mistake.  You went quickly from apprehensive about the pool to  "GET ME OUT NOW!!!"  and cried and cried. . and cried.  I think you were a mixture of scared and cold.  We did as you instructed, took you out of the pool, and put you in the sun.  I took you straight to the broken chairs and sat you down.  You were not happy, I could tell because of the deadly look you gave me.  How dare I take you out of a perfectly good car seat in a warm car when I was asleep and put me into a cold wet pool!?  But soon once you realized how good the sun felt after getting into the pool you were happy again.  You liked sitting in the sun on our broken chairs for a while.  Though our first attempt at making you like water failed, we were not daunted.  Once you were nicely warmed in the sun wrapped up in a nice towel, we promptly grabbed you up  and tried a different approach to the water.  THIS time we were to take you to the kiddy pool.  We put you in feet first and let you stand around for awhile.  You did not like this.  And you let us know.  You of course cried and cried.. Then Mom the wonderful lady that she is got into the kiddy pool with you.  You liked this.  She sat you on her lap, and you watched the kids around you splash and splash.  You were a quick learner and soon started your own splashes.    We sat there for maybe 15 more minutes and then a whistle blew.  "Rest Break",  called the life guards.  This was our chance you get you into the BIG pool again.  So we grabbed you shivering all the way to the big pool, and jumped in.  For 20 minutes we dragged you around and make you kick your legs and you loved it.  I think..  hehe we got a few smiles, but you were, by all means, not giddy about being in the BIG pool.  After a while we thought, "Hmm, I wonder how she would do if we dunked her?"  So mom dunked you.  That wasn't so smart cause you were not ready for it and I think you might have swallowed a tad bit of water.  Though you didn't make much of a deal about it.  You didn't like it too much.  We dragged you around the pool some more.  The when we were about to get out of the pool, we tried the dunk again.  This time we did it the right way and blew into your face first to make you hold your breath.   Guess what.  It worked.  You held your breath for the .00004 seconds you were under water, and came back up blinking while making the weird "baby under water face".  You didn't like this too much, but you didn't fuss either.  So we tried it again.  This time you did fuss a bit more, but mostly we figured you were frozen because it was windy and the water wasn't exactly warm.    We got you out of the pool, and dried you off.  Took you home and you basically passed out.  We were happy about the day, and you came out of it alive and basically un-harmed.  We are planning on taking you to the pool next week.  I hope you like it.  It will be memorial day.  Lots of stuff to do then.  Your mom and I love you very much.  I hope you enjoyed reading this. ;P  hehe   Pictures of the day can be found in albums ' urlLink Kate 16 ' and ' urlLink Kate 17 ' on the baby site.  urlLink kate16-2-18   urlLink kate16-2-19   urlLink kate16-2-20   urlLink kate17-1-1   urlLink kate17-1-2   urlLink kate17-1-3   urlLink kate17-1-4   urlLink kate17-1-5   urlLink kate17-1-6   urlLink kate17-1-7   urlLink kate17-1-8   urlLink kate17-1-9   urlLink kate17-2-10   urlLink kate17-2-11

      My cat charlie went to the vet today..  He got a bath  and got his shots.  we are giving him away because the baby is comming and we have a tiny house..  and 2 dogs..  and the cat.  We are givning the cat to a friend..  so it is ok..  charlie is a good cat deep down  but he is mean as hell  and bites.. so that is not all that condusive to babies or little kids and we had to cut our losses due to the fact that he knocks down everything on the mantle  or on bookshelves and even breaks some pictures..  glasses..  plates..  .  he likes to bat things off the table.  so needless to say  we are cutting our losses.     But he is the most beautiful cat..  :(  I feel like a failure as a pet owner..    So long char char..  we will see you in the next life :\

      I have never had a journal of any kind..  so I am hoping I can keep it up.  Since it is new I have lots of entries in a very short period of time hehe ..  but I assume like most other things that will decrease with time as the newness wears off so bear with me :)  I have just only begun.    I don't plan on being the most popular blog but at least I will have a log of my own thoughts..  I have not decided id I wanna make the posts public or not..  we shall see..    If I feel like ranting about somone I know  ..  then where would I put it?  ;P    I gotta work on that one hehe

      I bet you are wondering where I got my name..  well Dycacian I made up 9 years ago when I first ogt onto the internet..  with nasty ole AOL..  and I put a bunch of letters together that sounded cool in my head..  kinda RPGish..  pronounced "Dice-A-see-on".  My last name was pulled out of the book of the Dead.. 'Ba' means the soul, and 'Khaibit' means shadow.  so put it together it means "The Soul Shadow"  It works well with my necromancer in Everquest.  since I deal with things of the dead in that game.  But as I said Dycacian  means nothing except in the 9 years I have had it it has pretty much become my name.  so that is what I will use on my blog at least for now :)

(pilot)  that was like 45 min away..  then we got home  and had MY parents here with my lil bro and we had a cook out. .  (I over cooked the burgers..:\)  all in all it was a good day..  but busy as hell..  hehe  I also started working out again...  now that I have the excercize ball  I can use it as a weight bench..  hehe  plus it is fun to mess with..

      I have a presentation to make tomorrow. . and I am not too happy about it..  but it is ok..  I will bore these peeps to tears. Cause it is just dry material..  no cool things.. not even for a techie like me.  It is just dry as dry can be heh and I hate watching people sit there and look at me as if they were about to die of boredom.  but such is the life of a teacher. . and for a day I will be a teacher.    Why must we think that an 40 hour week of classes will teach these people.  It seems that they might retain like 15% of the crap we throw at them  and then ask us countless times later in their employment how to do this..  or that..  and we went through it all in the class.  The reason is that they don't give a damn in the class because they have NO idea of what the situation is that they are getting into.  I would think it would be better to give them these classes maybe 2-3 weeks after they start doing their jobs so they have more time to absorb the already massive amounts of info we throw at them.  40 hour weeks of training classes.. = 40 hours out of your life that will be lost forever and give almost NO benefit.    NOT to mention  that the teachers are put into an extremely uncomfortable position by having to stand up in front of a bunch of totally brain dead NOOBs.  we have 3 hours of computer shit that they care nothing about until  they are in the situation and I GUARANTEE that they will have to ask someone what to do when the situation arises and our little class will be all for naught.

      Good morning, last night I had my 3rd installment of the birthing class and I must say that it is a good thing that we went to this class.  I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who is having a child..  Damn I lost my train of thought I got interrupted.  Anyway..  We learned about all the stuff that is going to be attacked to my wife..  In every possible hole in her body..  It is pretty gross lol.  I won't go into it.  on another note..  I get to do more class today..  I hate talking in front  of others..  But it is something we must do.  Otherwise we will be inundated with stupid questions all the time..  Oh..  Wait..  We are inundated with that anyway,...  Screw that.. I still hate teaching these peeps..  there is no point.  GRRRR

       "I have gone out to look for me.  If I get back before I return, please hold me until I get there."  -anon   I saw that written on a chalk board in my English class my senior year in HS.  It has stuck with me ever since.  Pretty much a motto  or anthem of how my life is at any given moment.  Not sure what it means..  But my mind has always been half here and half there.    I spend my life looking for myself, but while I do that..  I feel like I am split in 2.  While one part of me is looking the other part of me is dealing with the mundane parts of life.  The problem with that is that I am not sure if I can stand much more.  The feeling of being stretched thin is getting too much to bear.  This is where I usually think to myself that money sucks.  And that I wish it wasn't around.  But then I go off onto a million tangents and come to the final inevitable conclusion that money drives the human race.     Humans want power ..  Money = power..   If it wasn't money it would be something else..  Like oil..  Or gold..  Or some unknown commodity.  At least money is in a form that normal people can acquire it.  Even though it is in very small quantities for most people.

      Blogging is fun..  blogging can be hard though  hehe I wish I had things to say..  Maybe I will talk about the book I am reading now  Or maybe I should talk about how my CCNA studying is going.  BTW I need to work on that hehe.  Haven't studied any today.  I got notes to go over.  I think the fact that the book I am using wants me to memorize the Cisco routers and switches is just a shameless product ad.  hehe  and the worst thing about it is that CCNA is so good to get you just have to study this commercial for like 8 weeks.  And then take a test.  Then you have the right to say "I am fully Cisco brainwashed.  I will work on nothing but Cisco products because all others are inferior".  But in reality I work with nortel and HP switches and they seem to be perfectly good switches.  Oh well..  In a few weeks maybe I will over come the urge to smash those "EVIL" non Cisco switches because they don't conform to my new Cisco training.

      Today I learned how to set up FTP access for a friend of mine to my website hehe..  This means that he can update his own site on my web space :D  hehe and I dun have to do anything ;P  hehe YAY!!!   hehe so now he can change his sig pics and stuff all by himself.  ;P  WOOOT.  The Dro forums are down  and slow..  I don't think I can handle this.. I need to read something ;P  hehe.  My Dream computer house.  I would have a server room with a Cisco router and a switch.  I would have my file server s in there and as well as my web server.  I would wire all my house with Cat-5e Ethernet.  If I need more than 1 connection per room I will add a hub to that node.   I will also have a gamers room  with it's own switch connected to the main switch using a crossover cable.  This will give me ability to host lan parties without killing the rest of the network  Unless we decide to play online then of course it still won't matter cause I will have a good enough connection.

      Well  For one,  she loves me back ;P  hehe but that is really just a perk.  Loving her is enough for me to survive forever.  She has the eyes of a goddess  I get lost in a sea of green when I look at her.  I don't know about her, but when I see her at the end of the day, I still get those good'ole butterflies in my stomach.  I won't go into it too much.  But I DEFIANTLY find my wife HAWT!   hehe Yeah,  she turns me on like a lightbulb  every time I see her.  Hell every time I hear her voice on the phone.  Very sexy.  But, lets not dwell on looks, because no marriage would last 5 seconds without conversation.  She is sharp as a knife.  If you are not careful she will put you to shame, so watch your tongue.  Especially if you are a cold hearted bastard womanizer.  She can and will tear you a new ass hole.    So yeah, we have gone over the fact that she is a hottie, and a goddess, smart, and sharp tongued.  But what about the soft side?  She has the softest touch imaginable.  I lie in bed trying to sleep after a shitty day at work, and she plays with my hair and says wonderful things to me.  I am in heaven at those times.  But nothing compares to the way she is with our daughter.  It makes me want to cry every time I see them together.  She is the ultimate mother.  Well  that is enough for this session.  I will let you in on more reasons why I love my wife on the next issue of Why I love my wife.  Have a good night.

      Ultra VNC is a new VNC server/client that is compatable with all the old VNC servers out there like WinVNC and Tight VNC, But Ultra VNC adds some unique features that I personally like ALOT.  FOr starters it can use a DMS encryption plugin.  TO my knowledge it is the first VNC to have built in encryption.  Previosly I would have to set up a series of SSL wrappers on the VNC ports.  Needless to say this was a PAIN in the ass.  Next it has a build in File transfer function, and a nifty little chat feature.  No more Notepad for messages to the remote system.  It also allows for nice copy and paste between the server and client.  Now I know that this was supposed to work with Tight VNC as well  but for some reason I could never get it to work.  Last but not least..  Ultra VNC sports a nice little Video driver hook on the server for added speed and performance on high bandwidth connections.  This allows the screen to update hundreds of times a second without adding much in terms of processing.  the liks to these tools can be found here   urlLink Ultr@VNC   and   urlLink DSM encryption

      Synergy is a cool tool that I found.  A friend of mine said that it was featured on TechTV's "The Screen Savers" not too long ago.  And you know what?  He was right.  It was.  But he could not tell me the name.  Well I found it quite by accident.  It is called Synergy.  Synergy is a tool that you can use to control 2 computers using only one mouse and one keyboard using only a network connection.  Think of it as a KVM switch without the V.  Plus it switches when you move your mouse to the side of the screen.  It is fast and seamless to work.  It is easy and so far I haven't found any bugs.  Or at least no bugs I have fingered to be caused by synergy yet.  Recently my ALT key seems to be getting stuck in some weird way..  but that isn't the point.  You can find this cool tool at  urlLink Synergy at Sourceforge .    It works by putting a server on the main machine and a client on the 2nd machine.  And then you can pick which side of the machine you want to have your mouse move over with..  There are 4 options..  So theoretically  you could control quite a few machines..  But I have not put it to the test yet.  If you do.. let me know ;)

      As you can see I updated the blog template.  I added some links that needed to be there as well as some other blogs I read and/or write.  I also added a Google search, but I am not sure if I will leave it or not.  I wanted to be abvle to search my site for old pages/articles etc.. but right now it always brings me back to my main page.  so I gotta figure out a way to make it search better.  Maybe there is some DHTML script that I can use to search my site.  and use it instead of the google bar.  Course I like google search.  oh well.  I just thought I would at least explain and document my updates.    Enjoy

      Another Sourceforge thing I found that I like.  A  urlLink friend  of mine was asking me about RSS this, and RSS that, and I really had no idea what he was talking about.  So I asked him to explain.  An RSS feed is a feed that many Blogs and news organizations have that work with an RSS reader so that you can get up to the minute news feeds directly to your desktop.  The RSS readers look much like Email clients and you download the headlines or whatever from the sites via their RSS feed.    I happen to Download RSS bandit from source forge  cause it was really the first one I saw.  I had to install .Net Framework to make it work though.  Once I got it installed it was easy to set up.  Most blogs set up with RSS or AXOM have links that you can copy and just add it to your RSS reader.  Then you can set the reader to update every so often and it will poll the feeds to see if their were any new updates.  If their are updates, then it downloads the headlines of the articles, so you can read and see which ones you want to learn more about.    All this is cool and everything, but if you are a SERIOUS news whore, this could be addictive to the point that you could just be reading news ALL DAY LONG.  I mean, if you have 5 stories come in to your reader, by the time you are done reading those 5, you could hit update and have 5 more in your list again.  It never ends.   Anyway.  Here is where you can get RSS Bandit.   urlLink RSS BANDIT - A desktop news aggregator written in C#.    Get .Net Framework from Microsoft update.     Enjoy

      Before I say anything else I have this to say as advice to those who want to try something like this.  First, if you make a bet, that you plan on making good on and you know it will take years to accomplish, PUT IT IN WRITING if you want the other party to make good on his promise.  Second, THINK  before you bet.  And last, but definitely not least, don't make stupid bets.   I got this one off my RSS Bandit from the  urlLink Yahoo News - Oddly Enough XML Feed .  It is a feed that just has the really weird news.  Pretty funny most of the time.  sec, let me get a link for you........  Ok,  Back.  This story is about a guy who saved a million pennies due to a bet with his brother 30 years ago.  There are a few funny facts about this story.  First, the guy is trying to cash out his 3.6 tons of rolled pennies, but the banks won't take it without a large fee.   So basically this guy has 10,000 bucks worth of hard currency, and he can't cash it out.  Not even the Government will take it off his hands.  They say they don't buy back Currency.  The Second reason why this is funny, is that the brother who made the bet doesn't recall having made the bet in the first place.  The wager was a Dinner in Paris.  Now because of a wager that his brother can't even remember having made, this guy has 3.6 tons of copper to cash out and has no one to cash out to.  His brother isn't sure he should make good on the bet cause he can't remember it.  Here are 2 links to news stories.  I just found this one funny! hehe  Also I will link you to the RSS feed for Yahoo - Oddly enough stories.   urlLink "Man Tries to Get Rid of Million Pennies" - AP   urlLink "A Million Pennies Saved, Nothing Earned" - Reuters   urlLink Yahoo News - Oddly Enough XML feed   Enjoy

      I am workig on some stuffs here at work  and I need time to gather data on an experiment I am trying so I decided I might shoot a blog post or two in here.  How are my 2 readers doing today.  hehe  It would be cool to actually find out if there is more than 2 peeps reading this.  I know it is a LONG LONG LONG shot but if there are then post a comment or somthing ;P    Unfortunatly I don't have much to say..  at least for this blog catagory. . so I might just call this post quits and find a topic to write about.  ..  hmmm  yeah I think I will go do that.

      Well  yesterday I had surgery on my toe.  And here is where I get to tell everyone the details lol just cause I can.  To give some history, I get these damned things honestly.  The seem to be genetic.  I got my OTHER big toe fixed 2 years ago  and dammit I should have had them done at the same time.  I was just afraid that I wouldn't be able to walk  lol.  I know I know  they are just toes  but I really didn't know and I did not want to lose all that sick time cause of my toes.    Anyway,  When they do this..  They basically have the cut out a big chunk of toe nail and then cauterize the cuticle so that portion does not grow back again.  They took out about 3-4 cm worth of toe nail from the left side of my left big toe.  it was DEEP in the flesh you might say.  Cause only 1 cm of that 3-4 cm  was visible.    first they had to numb me up.  They sprayed this Super cold stuff on my toe so they could inject a local Anesthetic with minimal pain.  It still hurt like a bitch  lol ..  Hell  the cold hurt about as bad as an injection would, lol  but who knows cause I felt little of the injection..   The nasty thing about this needle is that it is flexible.  And it needs to basically wrap around your toe UNDER your skin to apply this stuff in the right places..  I made the mistake of watching on my first toe and almost got sick.  Once that was done..  They take what looks like a pair of wire cutters and just cut all the way down to the cuticle of my toe..  And man I know that would hurt so fucking bad if my toe was not totally numb.  And I made DAMN sure it was numb  I had them give me 3 doses of numbness.  hehe.  After it was cut he got another pair of pliers and slowly yanked the toenail right out..    It was huge!!  But Wait! It doesn't end there..  lol  Once the toe nail is out, they put this stuff on the tip of some wooden spikes..  And jam them up into the toe where the cuticle is/was.  They are about as thick as matchsticks  with a point on them.  he did that with 3 spikes.  I am assuming that was the stuff to cauterize that portion of the nail so it does not grow back..  And it might have been some neosporin too  I dunno..  Well once that is all done they wrap it up to the point where my toe looks like it is about 4 times it's original size..  And they gave me this open toed shoe.  It didn't fit well at all..  I walked around all day limping not cause of pain but cause my new shoe was not staying on my heal..  TODAY I just wore my sandals on both feet to work.  People look at me funny but hey, at least it is symmetrical and I can walk with a much slighter limp if any at all.    So that is my nasty ass story.  I am sure you all wanted to read that lol..  Have a great day!

      This week has just been busy busy. . hehe but I have actually kept up with everything.  Pretty good for me.  I tend to forget EVERYTHING.  I usually have my wife remind me lol.  That rarely works.  She hates that.  But with work being busy, I have not been able to update my blog much..   I have also been looking for an email encryption program that is not PGP key.  I need one that is free without spyware.  If anyone knows of one let me know.  I need it for work.  Been looking for awhile today..  At least trying to when I am not running around.

      I have found a site that has alot of information on EQ2 in a nice condensed format. It makes things easier you find when you wonder about something.  urlLink The Moorgard Index    is an index of all the posts that Moorgard makes on the official EQ2 forums. Basically some guy condensed all his answers to various questions into one list. Makes for good reading. Enjoy

      Today NVIDIA release their new drivers.  You can find them here for  urlLink Windows 2000/XP .  As with any new drivers, you should check for compatibility, and updated version of DirectX.  You never really know what a driver will do.  Hopefully it will make improvements to your performance.

      Hmm..  As much as I hate it for ID, this was inevitable.  And I can't say I have never downloaded a game, but down in my heart of hearts. I feel for ID.  The reason?  Well I remember when DOOM came out.  It was the greatest game ever (at the time). It scared the hell out of me, but I beat it, even if I was on god mode (hey I was young).  I still beat it.  Now that they are losing all this money and it made international news.  I don't know what this will mean for future games.  I know piracy is a bad thing, but if you are lacking funds, and all your friends got the game..  it is hard to resist the constant bombardment of DOOM III reviews and screen shots.  Chances are, you are going to go and find a copy.  In fact chances are I will have access to it within a week or 2.  Will I use it?  I don't know..  And if I use it, will I use it as a demo and buy the game later?  I don't know..  I do know I would use it with the full intention of buying it later..  But in real life things don't always workout that way.  We will see... hehe All in all  if I did buy it it would only be played until I got EQ2, then I might as well un-install the damn thing lol..  Cause I will be playing EQ2 most of the time..
