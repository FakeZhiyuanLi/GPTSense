      Im listening to: Finch "What it is To Burn"  Well I have decided not to go. So I guess Ill post again.   This weekend didnt live up to my expectations. We stayed at home and did absolutely nothing. Sure I like to do that every once in a while. And I know money is tight and gas is short(yeah im sure youve heard by now). But the least we could have done is go actually go outside! Yup i said it... they didnt even go outside. You  know im not an out-doorsy person either but all it takes is just step ot the fornt or back door... I do it every day at least twice. Also you know my mom was supposed to buy me new shoes this weekend... That didnt happen. She said we would do it Wednesday... I doubt it. And I dont want it to interfere with getting my new glasses(I really need them I can just barely see the bored with these). It sounds seflfish doesnt it. Well I dont mean to be. Then the week after we have to get my sisters glasses. Yeah her eyes are bad too. Some of you probably thinking I should be buying this stuff with my own money right? Well if you are thinking that fuck you. Just kididng. Im really Sixteen(I think Ive told you that) and I dont have a job yet(no one is hiring). See you soon(hopefully).                        -Terri

      Im listening to: Andrew W.K. "She is beautiful"  Im sorry it has taken me so long to update this blog but school has come down hard on me and im still adjusting. Its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Its ok. Its not the best but what school is??? To make up for lost time I will do a couple quizzes for you ...    Congratulations! You're a black velvet!    urlLink   What Drink Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I dont even drink. Im not sure what made me take this quiz. I had a couple shots of vodka last month(summer vacation). But nothing to be proud of(not that drinking is something to be pround of). Ive never been drunk either. I dont  think I want to though. What the hell is a Black velvet anyway???    avoidant     urlLink   Which Personality Disorder Do You Have?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   This quiz describes me well. Im avoidant and shy to an extent. But I wasnt always like that I used to be a fun, active and outgoing little girl. But all thats change now. I honestly dont know what happend. I think its because my family moved to Arizona. Damn this place. I swear the opening to hell is around here somewhere. All I have to say is that im a far cry from what I used to be. But I guess I shouldnt dwell on the past. Right???     you are a pretentious indie asshole. you piss off everybody but  other pretentious indie assholes. you suck extremely hard and only listen to stuff on pitchfork media. fuck you.    urlLink   what type of lame scenester are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I dont think im indie. but I do listen to some of the music. He is cute... And I like his jacket too. But im not going to go turn indie now. I like the way I dress its perfectly fine. last year it was more miss match. Or thats what people called it at school. Damn them. I really didnt care the way I looked then(sophmore year). But now I actually look to see what I look like in the mirror. I guess Ive changed a bit.

      Im listening to: Debbie Boone "You Light Up My Life"  Hello my adoring fans and fanatics(I havent forgotten about you). I would like to thank you all for taking the time out of your day just to read this post... So  Thank You.  Ok now here is something im gonna do for every blog until I run out of them. So here it is( hope you like it).    You have a goodbye kiss- much passion and longing, but never lasting.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I like this one but I think last time I was an innocent kiss. Also it seemed like the questions changed from the last time. Maybe it was a different quiz... So yeah I well be giving you guys a quiz every single day... or at least ill try to. Ok? I wont be able to tell you how im feeling anymore or anything cause it will just change how I was feeling for the last couple days... sorry. Not that you care right.  Well no I guess Ill tell you about my shcool days... Ok as you know Schoold started on Thursday August 7, 2003. It started at 8.15... but my bus was late so I didnt get to do a thing before classes. that suck big time cause I was hung by second period! Oh I forgot to tell you that for the first two days of school (Thur. and Fri.) they changed the the schedules around so that we woudl have Three classes a day two hours each. it wasnt bad, just really long. Well anyway here my schedule: 1st Arizona/ American history (required) 2nd Psycology 3rd Algebra II (required) A lunch ( we have two lunch periods A and B) 4th Computer programing 5th Chemistry (required) 6th Composition  Yeah we have six classes a day that are each fifty minutes. Lunch is 30 minutes. Its just barely enough time for everybody to get out of line and actually sit down and eat what they payed (which is crap). Im drinking kool-aid (cherry) and now listening to Brand New. They are pretty cool.  I guess we'll leave it to that.                                                                                                        -Terri

      Im listening to: Fountains Of Wayne "Stacy's Mom"  Ok its the same day! Why it is going so slow. I dont know. But it happens on those hot summer days. There is no avoiding them. This one just so happend to be the day before school starts thats all. I know I know its just to torture me and the rest of the world right(see I didnt forget about you out there)? Have I told you about myself yet??? Would you like to get to know me???   Well I guess I can put a little something about me in each blog untill I run out of things to say( I doubt that Ill ever run out of things to say). First off I listen to but loads of music. Mostly punk and emo. and thats really about it just stuff around those genres. Oh and about this morning... I didnt make it... My lazy ass didnt get up and ride my damn bike over to Fry's to get some type of caffeinated drink. I convinced my self I could do it without the caffeine. I have done it once before, but I was doing a lot of stuff to keep me occupied. So I ended up sleeping 'til twelve. I really hope I can get to sleep tonight... im worried.  School starts tomorrow and I hope I do better thatn last year(last year was ugly). Im not prepared... I dont want to get depressed again(yeah last year was that bad). And you know you can only be depressed for so long until you become suicidal. I was really close to that. God I hope this school year goes well... Wish me luck.

      Ok well I cant go to sleep.  Im thinkin' im gonna ride my bike to frys around 5:30am and by something with a lot of caffine in it. To make sure I stay up the rest of the day ill have to buy two ar three of them... You know, just in case... School starts tomorrow and thats why im doing this. Cause if I go to sleep now Ill sleep till noon(or later) and wont be able to get to sleep until this time tomorrow. Which isnt a good thing considering school starts at 8:15am.    You know ive really tried to get my sleeping pattern in order before I got to school... I didnt work out to well.

      Hey  I hope you welcome this blog with open arms and an open mind. It is always nice to make a person feel welcome. So this will the first of many blogs to come. I hope you enjoy them.   Today was  just like any other summer day... hot and boring. I swear summer is like a chore to me now. Its like I have to do it or I wont get any allowance for the week. Its sad really. Thats not the way summer is supposed to be. I guess I should tell you wht summer is supposed to be like to me huh? Well ok, summer is supposed to be : a) Fun... you know full of shows, wild partys, and that includes birthday parties birthdays(lol yeah I said birthdays) b) Cooler than 105! Here in Arizona it is schortching everyday... you should have seen the warped tour! It was 111. c) And last but not least Lemonade! Summer should be filled with Lemonade(yeah I said it)! Ahh yes I can see it now sittin' back in a lawn chair sippin' Lemonade through a straw with a lovely little umbrella in it... I can see it now.   If you'd like to know I was listening to: Finch "What It Is To Burn"

       Im back .  Took me long enough right? Its Sunday night and I still have homework to do and yet I still found time for you all. Aren't you happy? School is one big bust. I cant stand it! Im sure many of you out there feel the same way too. But im just not having a good time. I never have. I know, I know school isn't about having fun. But don't most of you have fun while in school? Well I don't. Even lunch is a hassle! I rarely eat it anymore. Just a couple fries here maybe a Whatchamacallit (its a candy bar) there. Also Im still failing that chemistry class. All I need is one percent though then ill be right at sixty percent... heh that will be the day.      My inner child is sixteen years old!    Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     How did they know!?!? I wonder. I am sixteen so does that automatically mean my inner child is sixteen? Nah couldn't be. I went to the mall today I bought a fake flower to put in my hair. It looks pretty nice. I like it. I think I might wear it Monday.  I went to Edgefest last weekend the (20th of September)! It was fuckin' insane! I had a blast! I had more fun than when I went to the Warped Tour. Probably because I was with different people. It was a local radio station who did it. It wasn't at all like Warped Tour. The only thing I wished were there was more booths. Warped tour had plenty. But Edgefest was lacking in the booth section. I got a free Fourbanger CD! They are definitely great. They have an Emo thing goin on or at least I think so. I like Emo and some metal but I think I told you that.   Its ten and I should be going so I can think about doing homework. God im so lazy. I've never been good at school either. I've always been a C or lower student. Its sad really. I never even made honor roll until fifth grade. That was the first and last time too. I haven't made it since. Oh well I guess I shouldn't dwell on the past right? I try not to.    "FEBRUARY: Abstract thoughts. Loves reality and abstract. Intelligent and clever. Changing personality. Temperamental. Quiet, shy and humble. Honest   and loyal. Determined to reach goals. Loves freedom. Rebellious when restricted. Loves aggressiveness. Too sensitive and easily hurt. Showing anger easily. Dislike unnecessary things. Loves making friends but rarely   shows it. Daring and stubborn. Ambitious. Realizing dreams and hopes. Sharp. Loves entertainment and leisure. Romantic on the inside not outside.     Superstitious and ludicrous. Spendthrift. Learns to show emotions."   In a lot of ways this is true. Im very stubborn and very temperamental. I don't think im very intelligent at all but hey who knows. I do like freedom and I don't like to be restricted. Aggressive people are great. I am easily hurt(im not sure why). I do anger easily and I do enjoy making new friends. But I don't try to hard to do it because im shy. Im not romantic on the outside. Its just not something I show. People here would think I was crazy. They would be like Terri what happened to you have you gone craaaaazzzzyyyy? I have no Idea what spendthrift is though. I it is true that I don't like unnecessary things. They are stupid and... Well... Unnecessary. I think im gonna go get a drink and a shot glass form the fridge if you know what I mean. Or maybe Ill just eat some more... Im not hungry just bored and that's something (sometimes) I do when im bored. I cant help it. One of these days Ill get fat. I think ill get the drink... Maybe ill mix it with something instead. LOL. Its now time for me to go. Maybe ill see you again next weekend... Maybe. I wont promise anything. But lets hope ill be here... If im not here don't worry yourself to death and don't be sad either. Because, well, I don't know but eventually ill be here cause I feel bad if I don't come do this. Sad isn't it? See you sometime soon.  -Terri

      Ok I wont be on for long. But its just enough time to tell you all about this weekend. First off it was ok. My (twin) sister went to a friends house and the two other people there got drunk and ended up vomiting all over the place. eventually the girls mom came home and went crazy.  Tracie lied to my parents about what happend though. She was the only one that was sober. I found it quite funny when she told me the story. But thats not the whole thing. I really dont have time to tell it all.  I went to a party saturday. It was with my sister too. We went because hes our friend. Hes my EX boyfriend but that was a while ago. We are still great buddys though. Like in september of freshmen year(im a juiner now). It was an on and off again type thing. I just cant say no to people. I want them to be happy. And if that means sacrificing what I feel to make them feel happy then I will probably do it.   You know what I found out about myself this week? I found out that im somewhat of a violent person. Especially when im angry or even if im listening to so metal(music). Thank god for mosh pits! I like to punch things. I cant help it. I just have to punch something(hard). I dont know what it does but it is relaxing in some odd way. I feel better after words. I started doing it a while ago. Like within the year.  I dont always listen to metal though. I listen to a lot of emo. I love emo. I found myself getting into metal recently. probably in late august and early september.  I like it so ill listen to it.  Im also going to edgefest on the 20th of september. It will be great! Mosh pit here I come! Hope your ready.... It will be wild!  Im sorry it took me so long to update this. Just remember that ive been swamped with homework! Im even failing a class right now(happens every year)... Damn chemistry. I cant play badminton because of it. I hope I get it up before the season is over. Im so damn good at badminton too. They need me on the team.

       Hey there ,  Man am I bored! My family wants me to make these  double chocolate mud bars  (there is no double chocolate! There is only one! ) real quick like. However, I dont want to make them! But if I dont make them now ill never make them. They have been asking me all month and well the last month too. lol. So I guess i'll get down there, although I really dont want to.   Oh! Homecoming was yesturday! The dance was right after the game. At first I didnt think I would have fun, but I did! It was swell. Not only did we win the game I got freaky with my friends(and strangers!)on the dance floor. It was great. I didnt think that many people were gonna go because all week people were saying that they wernt gonna go. But it was fuckin' awesome. I had a great time. I'll tell you more about it soon... Most likely tomorrow.  "Living for the sound of rain, hoping for something more... It never rains here."  -Terri

      Hi, My week is up and school is starting Monday.     Eep! I got "D's" on my report card like four of them were(out of 6).  The rest were ok. I think it was an "A" and a "C". God! This is what got me depressed last year. I don't want to feel that way anymore. Its so so so very sad. And you feel just horrible like no one even cares you r failing that no even cares that you're alive that if you jumped off your balcony and mad a loud sound no one would notice until they came outside to get a beer out of the cooler. Ugh im glad those days are over.    urlLink     How will you die?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I don't think I want to drown. It kind of sucks if you ask me. You're like looking up at the surface(from under water) reaching for the top but you're just out of reach, its just too far away now and there's no way you're gonna make it back to the top in time to gasp in the air that you need so desperately, and meanwhile your still sinking fast into the depths of the sea or pool or whatever.   Well yeah my week of wasn't anything special. I got my license of Friday(it was supposed to be Tuesday). And I went to the mall today. We were supposed to go to the one in Chandler but the guy that was gonna come with us backed out last minute so our friends dad decided that it would be to far to drive. So we ended up going to the closest mall to us which is Arrowhead. It was ok. We've been to Arrowhead Mall so many times you'd think they would get tired of taking us there.  That just about sums it up for me. The rest of the time was spent sleeping and... Well... Watching television(im addicted!). Yeah that and really for life.  Which was the weekend before this one. Yup, it was crappy just like it always is... Always. I've done it two times before and it just happens the same way everytime. Its freaky the way it happens the same way each time. Yeah Its with friends and stuff so I have fun most of the time... This time one of my good friends wanted me to have sex with him(I didn't. Im not ready yet). It was funny because he said I have sexual frustration(that's soooo mark).  He's really funny and stuff. But I know what your probably thinking... What a dirtbag. Right? Well he's not. I couldn't even really say no cause I ate a caffeine pill earlier and I had two (or three or four)tiny little cups of coffee. I was just giggling. I couldn't even tell he was asking me questions!   Damn! I wasn't supposed to stay up this late its 5:36.57 here! And I have school tomorrow! Damnit! Curse my bad sleeping habits!  -Terri

You know I just wanted to say hi. I cant talk much more 'cause, well, Im kind of buzzed right now and I can just barely type. So yeah. I guess Ill see you all tomorrow... Hopefully.  So see ya.   -Terri

      Im back... And a lot sooner than I thought. Honestly. I gotta tell you about some changes Ive made in myself in my quest to fit in.  1. Im not as shy  2. Im more outgoing. 3. I cant think of anymore  I don't know im just different now. Im starting to fit in better.   I know you've been waiting a long time for this(sorry bout the wait). Thanks for waiting patiently.    You're a natural born trouble-maker. You hate authority and do everything you can to get around the law, or in some cases, break it. Naturally stubborn, you hardly ever sway once a decision is made. Your nature is fiery and courageous, and always out-going. You love attention and usually have kinky fetishes you're not afraid to explore. People either love you or hate you.    urlLink   What Type of Soul Do You Have ?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     I mean yeah I liked myself just fine then. But instead of taking the road less taken im gonna take the, well you know. I don't know why. I just want to be apart of something now. I go to parties, ive made more friends. Its just something I want to do. I like fitting in better than being that black girl who dresses wierd. I didn't even really dress that wierd( at least I hope I didnt). I know Im starting kind of late(This is my junior year), but at least its working.    Oh about the quiz. Yeah now that I think of it I am kind of a troublemaker(sort of) Ive been like this since I was a kid. Then the third time I moved(here to Arizona) I became more introverted and reserved. I started dressing in old shabby clothes that didnt fit me and didn't look too good. That was when I didn't really care what people thought of me. I didn't care when I was a kid(I think) but this is when I didn't care at all. Although when two girls in 6th grade(we were standing in line to go to art class) thought I was gross because I didn't  wear a bra. what they said kind of hurt me, they didn't understand though, I didn't need one because im flat chested. I even tried to explain it to them but they weren't gonna changed their minds. They had their minds set on me being gross.    Being Flat chested sucks so much ass. And It really sucks when your twin sister matures faster than you. She got her period in 5th grade(no lie). She was developed and ready to go in what seemed like no time. It also sucks when all the new freshmen have bigger breast than you. I hate it when people say im lucky, they don't understand. Here is another quiz for you...     You are  Lime . You are quirky and misunderstood.  You are definitely your own person.  You don't let anyone tell you who you should be.  You never sell out your values and beliefs, no matter what.  However, you can sometimes have trouble fitting in, but only because you are misunderstood.

Im kind of woozy cause ive been drinking( I already know its bad for me). Tic tacs are ok. How are those lime ones though???  -Terri

      Heh heh,  Didnt get to dance with any hot guys thats for sure. I didnt really dance with anyone. All in all I didnt have any fun. I wanted to go to this huge party afterwards but My sister didnt want to go. I cant/dont really want to go alone cause I like to have fun at parties and you know what that means. Its hard no to. So anyway just wanted to say...

      Winter Formal is today. I think my dress is pretty nice. I  hope I get to dance with some hot guys. But there arnt that many in my school... That sounded kind of mean didnt it. Anyway most of the guys at my school now are now hooked up with someone. Most except for the sophmores and freshman.    My dress is shorter than the last two years. Thse were both long this one stops right below my knee's. Its black and has like two small pink ribbons tide around the top. Then it has pink flowers on the bottom. Im dont normally got for pink but it was like the only dress that looked good on me.     Exhibitionist movie! You'd get off on letting ANYONE and EVERYONE watch you have sex...even small children, you sick sonofabitch! Kinky is your middle name.    urlLink   What kind of porno would you star in?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     He he. Ive never had sex. Im not sure if this is a good thing or not. I dont know it may be good for some and bad for others. I dont know im lost.   Ill be back to finish this later on today. Im gonna go to the mall... I wish it werent so far away...

      I really wanted to go to the mall all week. But did I get to go to the mall? Huh? No, I didnt. I cant seem to find the time anywhere to get down there. I was gonna go this morning but my sister had the car at starbucks while she was talking to marshall about battle of the bands thats gonna take place at our school. I dont even think i'll be able to go this weekend either. I mean I have to go to work in two hours and thats not enough time to get there, shop, then get back. *Sigh* I guess all the sales will have to wait 'til next week. Watch, with my luck all the good sales will be gone by then too. That will make me mad.

       I had fun Friday!  Me and my buddies made some cool plans but then they started to fall apart cause the two people we really need to get the party started ended up ditching us. So we drove around for awile went to this mexican resturant  in avondale then we decided to go pick up another friend in surprise so the car was jam packed. Then we played truth or dare and suck n' blow in the car(I know I know its very childish). Soon after that some of us(me and my sister) had to go home. But we went back outside and played spin the bottle(even more childish but still fun). There were only 5 of us but it was hella fun. That was the first time I kissed a girl(it was just a peck). And the first time I saw 2 guys kiss playing that game. lol. Hella fun...    You, my friend are a true individual. You most likely hate trends and are creative. By seeing things differently, people either admire you or think you are a bit strange. I'm guessing you are a lot like me. Perhaps a Good Charlotte hater? I hope so.

Im talking to Marshall right now but hes not saying anything. Hes going to hang out with his girlfriend(Rachel) on Sunday. A few days ago I realized I was somewhat of a jealous person(I was in denial earlier). Eventually my jealousy turns to sadness. Its kind of like I want what I dont have... I shoudnt get depressed though, cause Its my fault, I had my chance and I didnt take it.

      I got off from work at around 10:30. I got sent from my regular Mc.Donalds to this other one for the day(they were short on people). I had so much fun. They were much nicer than the people I normally work with. I loved it. I didnt think I would have fun. But I did. Im happy.     Terri

      I got back from the mall a few hours ago. I went with some of my friends. It was pretty fun. They are really pickey though. All she bought was a shirt and a keychain. She (jessi) said she wanted a pair of pants. Oh well I kinda of had fun. We said we'd make over Michelle because well, her style is laking. lol.

      School wasn't bad today... I got a lot of homework, but it wasn't bad. I didn't get to see my good friend Carlos though. Hope he is ok. I pretty much saw everyone else.  I cant seem to find my buddy Eric. He doesn't go to my school or anything. I met him my freshmen year in English. I thought he was cute and eventually he asked me if we wanted to work on and English project together. Heh heh. I miss him. We are or were really good friends. I just cant seem to get a hold of him. Ive tried emailing him but he hasn't answered any of them. im a little worried. We never went out or anything. He turned out to be gay. I never told him I liked him until it came up like half a year later. He laughed at me. I really don't know why I like those anarexically skinny guys. Its just something about them. I like chubby guys too. Lets just say I like them all.   Eric H, this is Terri(you know who I am),if your out there reading this (this sounds so lame), Im here waiting for you to get online! Wait if your reading this you'd have to be online, wouldn't you. God Damn. Well Eric Ill just be waiting. I haven't moved or anything since then... I hope you haven't moved...   just log ON!!!   MY back hurts. Its this god damn chair! Whenever I sit in it for an extended amount of time it really hurts my upper back/ lower neck area. I could really go for a fruit role up right now or an energy drink(im addicted). I think I want to be a Chef. And I kind of want to learn how to make drinks like a bartender but im under age so... Does that sound a little weird to you?

      Its so cold and School is almost here just a few more hours before I have to get up and endure a long day of hard work and long lectures. Maybe ill actually learn something I wont wont want to for get the next second.  I wish the desert didn't get so cold in the winter. Its freezing here, its actually gonna be  35 degrees F  tonight! I had to cover my plants. Now see in summer its gonna be unbearably hot and I wont want to go outside or anything. I don't want to go outside now!  WHEN WILL I EVER GET A CHANCE TO GO OUTSIDE!!!!!!   IM SICK OF IT! IVE HAD ENOUGH!  I don't want to live here anymore. I never wanted to live here in there first place. The only reason we are here is because its cheaper to live here than it is to live in San Diego. And to top it off im getting a crappy education too.     You're the sad smile,the one that regrets nearly everything and is constantly wondering about what could have been.You're not happy with your situation and usually blame yourself because of the bad things that have happened.Cheer up.    urlLink   What Kind of Smile are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Wow this describes me very well. I regret a lot of things. And none of them are bad, I just regret stupid stuff that I wish I hadn't said or hadn't asked. I think I will cheer up if I go to a party this weekend.  Anyway im thirsty and there is nothing to drink in this house, so I think it would be best if I went to bed, finish washing my clothes, or watched TV or something. So see you soon(hopefully).    Oh! I got a job.... At Mc Donalds! Its not bad. I like working there. I don't cook or anything. There are these Mexicans that don't speak English that do that. They are good and fast at it too. People are nice. I just want to say one thing to Mc Donalds customers. BE NICE! You all have NO idea how unbelievingly complicated that register is. Yes it is fast food and we will get it to you as fast as possible. Just Be nice to us. Its mean to be mean. No one likes it when people are mean to them. I mean Im sorry I messed up your order but its not like its that bad I can do it over. Half the time its not even your fault its the got damn registers fault.   ~Terri

      Im sad.  And I cant help it. I start to think that no one likes me. Then I start counting the friends I have ( which is zero at the moment) and think why dont I have more. How come im not as sociable as my sister. Why do they like her more than me. Im nice too arent I. And just goes on and on and on with the same things. This is my fault anyway I shouldnt be stupid like this.  it would be nice to talk to someone that I could really trust with my feelings. Someone that wouldnt judge me. But thats what my friends and family do, they judge me (and everyone else). I just want someone who I can really love.

       First day of school,  sucked so much. I nearly fell asleep. I cant stand this school either. Im soo so happy that we are outta here in just about two weeks *smiles*. Thats the only thing that makes me happy. Looking forward to the end of the year. But you know at the end of the year im gonna be all tears and tellin everyone that im gonna miss them so much and that I cant stand to be apart form them or so long. Thats the way it always is. I should go to bed now but you know I cant because of the bad habits I created during spring break like smoking(im not addicted so I guess its not a habit), going to sleep really really late and waking up around two. But those should be broken in no time.

       hello friends  Im feelin a bit lonely at the moment. My buddy Tara went camping with a couple guy friends of ours. I think they will be there until Thursday.  And without her I feel a little lost and confused. Its because my sister and I hangout with her so much. Its unbelievable how much time we spend together. Totally Unbelievable.  But the thing is, is that its hard not to hang out with her because she is so charismatic and has a lot of personality(thought she can be very bitchy). Also she is willing to do almost anything. And our other friends just aren't like that. I guess I wish I had more friends like her.   So without her I cant seem to do anything . Even eat(I had a slice of pizza and juice). Just knowing she is away and that call her and ask her if she wants to do anything is hindering me in my quest for independence. If I think about it Independence seems a bit lonely. And im sick of being lonely.   ... Our maybe my sense of what independence truly is is wrong... Maybe.     You are Woodstock!    urlLink   Which Peanuts Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Cool Im Woodstock...  You know im on the Urban Outfitters site and they have a Hibatchi grill called Son of Hibatchi and I want it so much. But I cant get it because I have no money at all. As a matter of fact I lost whole ten dollars today. I was so sad. And you cant forget the fact that I got fired form my job at you-know-where. I dare not speak its name because its disgusting(the cookers were very unsanitary) and honestly I think I was treated unfairly. Even my co-workers said the same fucking thing! God I hate that fucking place. No im not saying that all those fuckin places are bad, Im just sayin that I want to be treated like  EVERYBODY ELSE!!!! . That's  ALL  I ever wanted form those fuckin people. That's all I fuckin wanted.  Perfect... Now im all fired up. I hate fuckin talking about that shit though. It pisses me off so much 'cause I don't think its right. I wish I could get your comments on this shit.  Anyway its the last week of spring break and im not enjoying it to much(you know why). So I guess I should get over my temporary loss of Tara and enjoy this week while I still can. Im mean its not like she's not coming back. Right? You know what, Im gonna try my best to forget about Tara and her camping. Im gonna have so much fun its gonna fuckin hurt!

       Saturday Night!  I had a fuckin good time on Saturday! Im serious. I was out so late(til about 4:00). Ive never been out past 12:00 before.   Mostly because she says my curfew is 10:00(thats the curfew for goodyear). But im like give me a fuckin break im the best damn kid you've ever had.   Anyway, I smoked for the first time that day. It wasnt bad and I didnt cough a lot. Though it did have a minty taste to it. That made it better. Really me and Tara and my sister Tracie hung out at his house with his brother until his dad got off from work... then we left and met at the school where we met up with Marshall. Smoked again then we went out to reems road that was kind of close to the school(you could see it) but still out in the middle of no where. I really had to go so I ended up peeing in the bushes. They shined a light on me like one of those police lights. It sucked so much cause I got scared cause I thought they could see me so I sat down in the dirt and it got in my ass. It was so sad. Then we started talking and the guys got on the subject of boobs and they wanted to see ours. I dont want to get into details two of us did and tracie didnt. I only did it for one person though. And it was just my bra nothing else. Is that bad?  Enough of that. How about you how have you been? Ive been alright. Report cards are coming out like in a day or so and im scared. I dont want it to ruin my spring break.    Emo!  You're very in touch with your emotions and that's what I like about you!  It's all about the music for you...  I have pity for your tortured soul...you're just like me...     urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I love emo. Its some of the greatest music there is. I hate all you emo haters its not like its really that bad. I guess you kind of have to get used to it. Just learn to love it.  VIVA LA EMO! ...  And other music too.

      Im gonna be up later then usual trying to finish last minute(late) work to turn in. Im trying to raise my F from a 39 to, well, something higher than that. Im thinkin at least 42 or 43. Im prayin that I get at least that. At least. I know thats sad that im hoping to get a 40 or more but I just might be shooting to high here. You just dont know how hard it is to get your grade up if its already low. I mean the class average is a 60%! Its just unbelievably hard.

      Spring Breaks almost here! Im so happy about that. But I still need time to get the rest of my grades up. I dont think my parents will be very happy to see my report card(they never are).   I lost my job... can you believe it. My first job ever and I lost in about 3 1/2 months. Is that bad? They were really mean to me and my sister. I mean they really were. Now im not making this a race thing but we were the only two black people there and they only had one older black guy before us. Now, all of the people there were either Mexican of had mexican in them. But anyway yeah they fired me. She said I stood around to much. But the thing is about that is that other people there stand around(or walk) talking on their sell phones especially the guys. The guys could get away with murder if they wanted to. they are much harder on girls there even though all the managers are girls(we used to have a guy but he left to go help out somewhere else). Im sick of talking about this it makes me sad.  I got up really early like around 5 o' clock which (im my case) is very odd. I dont wake up early unless its absolutly nessecary.  The only thing that really sucks is that today is late start so I will be up a little longer than if it where a tuesday. I didnt have anything to do so I decided instead of going back to sleep I would come here and type and do some homework that I didnt do last night.

      School work is so overwhelming! Im just in shock. In fact im so in shock that I havent done a damn thing since I got back form spring break... Spring break ended two weeks ago. Thats thing.   But you know today im actually gonna try to do something. As a matter of fact im trying to do these sixty spelling words from history. Im worried that I wont find them all though. They are really hard to find. Stuff like "Duck Soup" and Texaco Star Theater. I mean what the hell is that???   You know i've considered dropping out of school. But I know that dropping out is not a soluton. All its gonna result in is me ending up in a dead end job.     Your addicted to.....  Nothing!  Your addicted to nothing at all? Well..... ok I guess thats a good thing but come on just think of the possibilities!    urlLink   What are you addicted to? (pics!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Thats good. I dont think I would want to be dependant on a drug fix everyday. It gets expensive and Id prolly end up dying from an overdose.

       Its been a while hasnt it.  Its sad how long it takes me to come and do this every now and then. Next time ill try harder I swear.   Anyways lets get  caught  up. First things first, School (dun dun duuhh). Oh yes I said, school. I wish I could  abolish  the whole damn thing. If I did that, I wouldnt have to go to summer school. And man Is that gonna suck. Ive never been to  summer  school before either.   Lets see... I tryed out for  CHEER  on friday the ! I didnt make it Varsity though. But I did make JV. The only problem is, is that I cant be on JV because im gonna be a  SENIOR  (yay) next year. Im glad I did make something though. And you wouldnt believe the  routine  it was so cool and then the last like 8 counts you were supposed to make a little routine up and guess what I did... I blanked. I kind of just stood there tryin to think somethin up on the spot, but it didnt work out. By the time I thought something up the music was over and we were leaving the building. They called around seven that night to tell me the news. One good thing came out of it though. She (the coach) asked me to be the manager of the team and she said that I would be able to do everything the team did except perform and stuff... So im torn between my  first love ,  Badminton  and my  new love ,  Cheer . I need  advice  on what I should do!!   Im still  struggling  in school. Ive been talking to people that have failed classes before about things that I could do if I fail another class. And someone told me about this pass packet thing where you do a couple packets and take a test or too. And I was like hey I could do that but why didnt my councler say anything about it? Or about the that I could go to the community college take the class that I  failed  and get the grade that I got that in communty college. That grade would take the place of the grade I got in school. Im wondering why havent I heard this before. Im mean a good councler should give me all my options right? I need all the options I can get too cause im  deperate .     FROZEN QUEEN/ KING  You dont want love to come through to you. You like it the way you are. To be unreachable, no need to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you. You are already used to it. You say yourself that you dont need anyone, that you stand on your own two feet or that you dont have time for these things. But in reality you are scared to get hurt. You feel save where you are: by yourself, nobody can hurt you there. You invent your own relationship in your dreams. You just need to know that you COULD get a partner.  Thats it.  PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.     urlLink  ~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS! For girls and boys!~    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    That is so true. The truth is I am scared but im not sure if its about getting hurt. I was a crazy girlfriend. I would avoid my bofriends. Like if he was waiting for me at the lunch table id just wait until he left. It was just something I couldnt help doing. And if I am in a relationship I need a  tremendous  abount of space or ill feel  smothered . Now I havent had a BF in id say about two years. I guess thats not that long. I guess I wasnt meant for the whole  relationship  thing.   Its getting late so its time for me to bounce...   ~Terri

      So, I have  news  for everyone to hear. And its pretty bad if you think about it. Or I guess you really dont have to  think  about. But to my suprise I wasnt as  devastated  as I thought id be...    I failed one of my summer school classes...  Duh duh duuuuuuuh .    I did  cry  though. You all wouldnt understand how hard it was. And I want everyone to stop thinking that  summer  school is easy cause its not. I kept my tears in until I got out of there. You know you cant have everyone... well you know. Im  not  like that anyway. I dont want people to see me cry. I feel so  vulnrable . And I cant stand it when people try and help you and they feel sorry for you and shit. I  cant  stand it.   I was so close to finishing. I was missing  one  thing from a packet and she was like no, your done  bye .  I remember (when I was crying) thinking that im such a  failure  and stuff. And I remember thinking that I try so hard and I just keep failing and failing and failing. And that its just a cycle that I go through all the time. Like I try, I fail, I  try , I fail. And the cycle just goes on and on and on and on. And there is no way to stop it form going over and over. Well I guess I can say im a senior. But im a  senior  thats behind 1 credit ( 1/2  for a semester of chem and 1/2 for the class that I failed to make  up  in summer school)   God, I  HOPE  I get to walk this year. I would seriously be devastated and im sure I would cry for  days . I think id... well never mind.    Anyways, lets hope I get to go to  Warped  tour on the 30th of June. All we can do is hope. Lets hope together now. On the count of three...  1 ...  2 ...  3!  HOPE. Did it  work ?   Terri

      First off I just wanna say that some men (or boys) are dicks. Or at least that's what they thank with. And women shouldn't be treated the way they are. We deserve better Damnit. So fuck men (or boys). Fuck you all up the ass.   In better news, Summer school is almost just a half a week left. When its over im gonna cry tears of joy. Because Mrs ( How are you?) is a dick. I was supposed to finish last week on Wednesday. But of course you know me. Slow poke. So in other words im behind and still failing.   Cant wait till warped tour though. Still not sure if im goin. I&nbsp;will miss it if I don't. Because its like an awesome experience. And I wouldn't want ta miss it for the world. But if I am fortunate enough to go I want my  best friend  Tara to come with me. I love you Tara!

      So school got on  27 May 04 . And im very happy about it! But who wouldn't be  right ? I ended up passing all my classes!... Not well I might add. But still  PASSING . I think one of my teachers passed me just to pass me though because I didn't turn in the last two major assignments. So thanks Mr.Hilli(Nickname) if you did do that for me. I do Have to go to  summer  school but not long. Its for the classes I failed when I was a  sophi . Oh and the greatest thing I have to tell you is that... Duhn duhn duhhh... I PASSED  CHEMISTRY !!!! I mean how  beautiful  is that! I passed with a 60. I had to get a  55  out of  70  on the test to pass and guess what I got. A  59 !!! How bad ass is that.  Ive been hanging out with my  buddies  a lot since summer started(this normally doesn't happen). And Ive tried a couple different things, you know just out of curiosity. And im actually having fun this summer! Im looking for a job too. But its hard because im so lazy!  But I think ill find one. I hope I find one before the warped tour though so I can have a little cash for that. I love the warped tour! Me, my  sister  and a friend went last year and it wasn't that great cause they were holding me back. They were really scared of the big crowds and stuff. And they were like our parents said no moshing. But the thing is, is that  moshing  is  hella  fun and I cant help but do it. Like I at  Edgefest  I moshed and I got my glasses knocked off. It was when I was moshing and I got  elbowed  on the side of my head and the second was when I turned around and they were lifting a crowd  surfer  up and she kicked them off. But I did retrieve them both times! And I am wearing them today as a matter of fact. This time I wont wear them, ill wear my  contacts  (I didn't have contacts then).  Lets hope and pray I see you all soon...

During my visit to Maryland (the best state there ever was), I will ... well I have no idea... I know I might be getting my hair done. And im pretty sure ill be goin to a club or somethin.  I do know I will have nothing but fun, fun, fun. This is like a one in a life time thing in my family(we rarely have the money), so i will make the most of it. Ill be gone for about a week(6 days really) so Im not sure if I will be able to post or not. Just dont expect is all that im saying.  Peace,  Terri

      Im going to Maryland tomorrow! It will be a kick ass trip. Im scared of the plane ride though. I mean I will(pratically) be flying over most of the U.S.. And to me thats really scarry. Ive never ridden a plane that far before. I know for sure I will have lots of fun, fun, fun. Cause this is like a once in a lifetime chance in my family(we rarely have the money). So  I&nbsp;WILL &nbsp;make the most of this no matter what.  Ill be gone for about a week(6 days really). And I hope I get the chance to post again during that time. But If I dont, dont worry your little head because ill be right back afterwords to tell you about all the hot guys I met(yea right). LoL.   Peace,  Terri

      IIImmm Baaacckk... Aren't you glad. That im actually back within the week. Well anyway not much has happened since the last time I was here though so there is not much to say except that yesterday I smoked again(it felt wonderful. LOL) at a friends house. But, I swear to you and everyone else I know that I will never do it again.   Then today im gonna go over the same friends house and party like none other. Ha ha. Actually I highly doubt that that's gonna happen because we are gonna have a seance( I have no idea how to spell that). And we might do other stuff also. Im pretty sure there will be drinking. But all of us are gonna spend the night at his house anyway. So there will be no drunk driving or anything like that. But it will be fun because my friends can make any situation fun... Except for a death... That's a little hard.   Time ta bounce...   Terri   &nbsp;

      Im really trying to be consistent with this. I hate trying to cram a months happenings in one post. Its really hard.   So that's why im here. And I Terri, promise to blog at the very least, once a week.   Anyway, I just found out that Tara (that bastard) was on my sn last night (that bastard). You see she got my password because I told it to her. In in return she told me hers. Which is password by the way. So now im on a mission.... To kill her. Because I wouldn't even dare do that to her. Im mean how wrong is that for her to do that! So now&nbsp;im very seriously pissed off. And Tara, if you are reading this,&nbsp;I just want you to know that I will go to any means to get my revenge.   Give me comments on this, Id really like to know what you think.  ~Terri   ...I really like that little squigglly thing...

      Its July! And guess what... registration is on the 21st. I know its kind of weird that I say this but I cant wait till school starts.&nbsp; I cant wait to see everyone. Its so excititng.  &nbsp;  Also, I am going to Baltimore!!! I used to live near there when I was young. I&nbsp;lived there from when I was nine to 13.&nbsp; I miss it. I wanna go&nbsp;see my old&nbsp;elementary&nbsp;school&nbsp;(William Paca Elementary), and I wanna go see where I used to live (in military housing), and last but not least I wanna go shopping! I know thats sad but I never got to go shopping there cause I wasnt into that then so I just wanna check out a few shops here and there... you know just to see if the shopping is good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from there we are gonna go to New York. And all im gonna do there is shop. Thats it, nothing else. &nbsp;  The weather has been gettiing steadily worse here. But im glad its monsoon season cause it takes down the heat a notch or two. Then again maybe I dont like it so much cause im kind of afraid of of thunder/ lightning storms. I know the chances are low but im&nbsp;really afraid of getting struck by lightning. Like even being by a window scares me. I just feel like the lightning will just come there that window and kill me. It sounds silly doesnt it?  &nbsp;  Anyway, one of my favorite shows is on so im gonna bounce...  &nbsp;  Terri

      Maryland was great! And amazing, and every thing! I shoped until I got sick of it!!! Also I saw a lot of hot guys. And you know stuff like that. The flight there was really long and boring but there was this cute baby next ta me that kept me entertained for a while. You should have seen her eyes they were so beautiful. She was a beautiful baby.  So guess what... My parents are going out of town!!!! Its about time I know. And guess what Im planning.... YES! you guessed it, a big ass party. Well it might just be a kickback but still it will be kick ass. Just you you wait, just you wait.
