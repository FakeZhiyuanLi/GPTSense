         hey everybody!            as you can probably tell from my title, at this very moment i'm babysitting at my next door neighbor's.  don't worry, the kids are asleep, so its not like i'm ignoring them or anything.  they are the funniest kids in the whole entire world, let me tell you. for starters, their names are trevor and nigel, nigel being the youngest.  on top of their not-so-common names, they are just super sweet.  they're ur typical little kids, so they happen to be very into the rescue heros and stuff like that.  today trevor made it a point of showing me all of his new action figures and he even busted out the catalog to show me all of the ones he wants to get.  after the action figure display, i got a request to watch 'larry boy and the rumor weed'. now, for those of you who dont kno, that's a kind of 'veggie tales' movie, which are basically christian movies that tell bible stories through talking vegetables.  as weird as it may sound, it fits perfectly w/ the family cuz the only reason i'm over here tonite is cuz the parents are away at a bible meeting for church.  i'm not saying that it's a bad thing, i'm just saying it's a necessary fact if i'm gonna describe these kids.  oh yeah, i almost forgot: nigel has a deadly allergy to peanuts!! oh my goodness, the first time i came over here to babysit, his mom had to show me how to give nigel a shot if he ever got a hold of a peanut! it was honestly the scariest thing i've ever experience while babysitting! of course its not like theres peanuts just laying around the house, in fact they're non existant, but it's just a little scary knowing that theres a possibility i could have to give this four-year-old a shot just to keep him alive :/....but ne way, they're sleeping rite now, so this is my only source of entertainment.  on a new topic, last nite me, mai, abby, and my sisters went to a crew game, which was tons of fun.  annie was kinda mad at me cuz i yelled at her for coming home late from getting her senior pictures taken, but she got over it.  at any rate, the crew ended up winning    2-1 over the Kansas City Wizards, so everything was ok in the end.....wellll, i guess i should stop now cuz this is getting pretty long, so until next time adios dudes!!      ~*Ellen*~

         hey everybody!                   happy wednesday! lol! today was the second-to-last full day of band camp, so today is definitely worth celebrating.  band hasnt been that bad this week cuz all we've really been doin is running the show and going over music.  yesterday, tho, i got a new tenor in my section which means i have to teach her everything.  she ran through the show w/ us once today, but she's got a long way to go and since i'm section leader, i guess its up to me to teach her everything she needs to kno.  but aside from band, yesterday nite i got my eyebrows waxed for the first time at charles penzone, so that was kinda exciting. now, normally i dont do stuff like that, but annie's gettin her senior pictures taken today and she was gettin hers done so i figured i'd tag along.  i was a little scared that it would hurt, but the lady who did it was so nice and kept talkin the whole time so i didn't really feel anything.  after i got back from charles penzone i had adam come over and we watched 'kill bill vol. 2'.  it was definitely better then the first one and now i know why everybody was trying to kill uma therman's character, so its all good.  plus, it lacked all of the blood fountains from chopped off limbs that the first one had that definitely weren't a bit realistic.  and on top of all that, its always fun to hang out w/ adam cuz he's been opening up more and more lately.            well i guess i'm done for now, so until next time adios dudes!!      ~*Ellen*~      p.s. less then a week til school starts! i think i just mite cry :(

         hey everybody...        ugh, all this week i've had to suffer through 5 hours of band camp from 8am-1.  you mite be wondering wat we could do for 5 hours, but believe me, mr. stellar always finds a way to keep us busy the whole time :(.  so far we've learned all the music for our first show and the drill to our first song.  the only some-wat amusing thing thats happened all week was when billy almost got us ran over by a garbage truck when he drove me home wednesday...hehe...thank god 2mrw is friday and i get the weekend to recover from waking up so early all week. and i'm real excited cuz i probably get to go to the fair saturday!! woo hoo!! i'm thinkin that adam's gonna come along w/ me to the fair, so that should be intersting.  speaking of adam...lats nite me and adam watched kill bill volume 1.  that movie really confused me...well, i guess it wasnt that confusing, but i just wanna kno y everybody was tryin to kill uma therman's character. i'd probably find out if i watched volume 2, but i dk if i'm gonna do that, so if ne body knos wats the deal w/ uma thermans death wish, dont hesitate to tell me :P. welllll i guess i should probably go and get some sleep, so until next time adios dudes!      ~*Ellen*~

         hey everybody         well, me and mom are no longer alone.  yesterday both annie and susie got back from camp so everything is back to normal here...well, as normal as possible for my family.  but thats besides the point rite now, cuz i feel like the biggest jerk known to man.  yesterday adam came over and we watched 'signs' in my basement.  during the movie everything was cool, i got scared just cuz i'm the biggest wuss when it comes to scary movies, but it was afterwards was when things got complicated.  i forget how it came up, but its like adam's favorite response to questions when you ask his oppinion is 'i dont care'.  so yesterday i flat out asked him if he cared about nething and all he could do was look at me and laugh.  i knew he was thinkin about it cuz i saw it in his eyes, but he didnt say anything.  so after that things were kinda awkward, and it was left for later discussion when he got online (where all the pivotal things in our relationship have been discussed).  after talkin to him i felt sooooo bad, and still do, cuz he kept appologizing for being a bad boyfriend for not talking and w/e when hes in noo position to be appologizing cuz it should be me.  i made him feel really bad over something really stupid and i havent talked to him since, so for all i kno he could be pissed at me.  wat i girlfriend i turned out to be....on to a more happy thoughts: friday me and me mom went shopping allllll day!! woo hoo!!! technically it was  school  shopping, but i got to spend lots of money, so its all good :P aside from that, band camp starts 2mrw from 8am to 1, so that should be tons of fun (note the sarcasm). so i guess thats it...until next time adios dudes!  ~*Ellen*~

         hey eve  r  ybody!!            wats crackin home dawgs? lol, i'm just kiddin w/ that. rite now i'm chillin w/ my homie josh in his room watchin some dumb tv show.  we just got done watchin 'the perfect score' on his computer which he thinks is the coolest ever (we'll just keep lettin him think that).  once again, i've resorted to hanging w/ my dude josh cuz the boyfriend was non-existant today...don't get me wrong, theres nothing wrong w/ josh, cuz we always have tons of fun (winkwink...just kiddin :P) but its kinda sad when it seems like adam's best friend has more interest in me then adam.  i dk, it just seems like w/ adam i'm not even the slightest bit important to him...almost like hes just going through the motions of being in a relationship.  i dk if that makes any sense to anybody, but thats the way it seems. oh well, i've got more pressing matters on my hands, cuz i'm going school shopping 2mrw...UGH!!! i've seriously got like 3 weeks left of summer!! ONLY THREE! that is so freakin depressing!! but i guess its like trying to avoid the inevitable, so i guess i should stop complaining...uh huh, rite. i'm gonna be kickin and screamin rite up until i get to my peice of crap school on august twenty-sumthing. lol, i think i'm done now, so until next time adios dudes!      ~*Ellen*~

          hey everybody!         well, today was day two of me-and-mom week and altogether it wasnt so bad. last nite me and my parents had to take the dog to the vet so i got to drive all the way to ashville w/ them. it was ok tho, cuz the vet had three of the cutest puppies i've ever seen! they were 6-week-old schipperke puppies (the same breed as dc). they looked like little gorillas from the back, cuz they have no tail, and little fluff balls from the front. if that sounds kinda odd, then i guess u just had to be there :P. but ne way, after the trip to the vet i watched some reality tv and went to sleep, or at least tried...i didnt end up actually falling asleep until 4:30 AM!!!! it was so frustrating cuz i have no idea wat kept me up, oh well...this morning i got my daily dose of dawsons creek, and prepared myself for another day of cleaning and such, but luckily adam came to the rescue and he ended up coming over. we watched 'hidalgo' and then he ate dinner w/ me and my parents. if ne of you kno adam, you're aware that he's not the most talkative person, but my mom managed to get us all through it ok w/ her incesent comments about how i should play soccer this fall. after dinner me and adam went to dairy queen where he spent most of the time listening to me jabber on like an idiot. that boy frustrates me sometimes cuz i kno he has to have something to say  sometimes  but apparently he just doesnt like sharing it...grrr...so now i'm sitting here, snackin on starbursts (yummmm) and waiting for my reality tv to start...tonite its 'outback jack' on tbs :P. ok, well i'm off to find something to amuse myself w/ for an hour...until next time, adios dudes! :D   ~*Ellen*~

         hey everybody  ...      today actually marked day one of just me-and-mom week, so i was a little worried. last nite she put me through the hole 'bonding session' where she proceded to hold a stake out in my room.  i seriously think we were up there for an hour in which all she did was tell me how much she wants me to play soccer for DeSales this fall.  i have noooo idea how many times i'm gonna have to tell her that i just dont wanna do it!! shes just soooo annoying cuz we've had the same discussion a bajillion times and she tells me the same thing every time-as if thats gonna have any effect on me.  oh well....today actually didnt turn out so bad.  the worst part was getting up at 8 and running sharon woods, but i made it through.  after that, mom started barking out orders right and left.  so basically i've been cleaning since just about 10 this morning.  sounds like fun, doent it? i'm hopin tonite i'm gonna get to have a little more fun.  i think i'm probably gonna go over to josh's to watch some movies and wat not. hold on, i should probably clear this up now: josh isn't the boyfriend.  oh no, god only knows where adam is...probably off playing halo at brad's or sumthing.  its just funny cuz it's like he always has time for video games but no time for me. that boy is soo frustrating.  but ne way, i'll stop now. until next time!                                                ~*Ellen*~

          hey everybody!       well i guess this is my blog...i'm not so sure how interesting its gonna be, but just in case ne body really cares...hehe...wellllll today wasn't fun at all...both my sisters left for summer camp, so i got to follow the rest of my family around. i ended up going w/ my little sister up to bellefountain(spell check!) so we could check her into some horse camp.  it was fun seeing all the horses and stuff, but definitely not worth the drive up there.  oh well.  and then when i got home i was bored outta my mind w/ nothing to do...so bored in fact that i went running!! am i crazy or wat?! so now i'm sitting here, watching 'the mask of zorro' on tv, wondering where my boyfriend is, thinking that he mite be able to save me from this boredom...haha, yeah rite...so i guess in an effort not to bore u outta ur mind too, i'll stop now. adios dudes!                                                                      ~*Ellen*~
