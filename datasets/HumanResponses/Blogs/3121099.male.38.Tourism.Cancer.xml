						   Well...The 2004 World Series of Poker is over.  Greg "Fossilman" Raymer takes home the title of champion and the mind-blowing amount of  $5 MILLION DOLLARS!!!   The field of 2600 players , another poker tournament record, was overwhelmed by the play of PokerStars qualifiers. The final table itself had 4 of the 9 players qualify thru PS.  PokerStars took down the top 2 spots in this years tournament.  For me, this year's tournament leaves me without words on how I feel.  First, 2600 players!! Next, $5 million for first place, $3.5 million for second, $2.5 million for third, with the next two places also taking home over a million dollars each!!  Hell, last year's winner, Chris Moneymaker  only   won $2.5 million.    With online poker players making such a strong statement in this year's tournament, not to mention a PokerStars player winning the last two years, what will next year bring?  A field of 4000? A champion prize of $8,000,000?!?!   I am getting myself set for next year's tourny.  Though I feel that the larger the field in a tournament, the more the luck factor kicks in, I will take my shot to enter.  Not only thru the online qualifiers but also the satellites and super satellites at the WSOP.   Congrats to Greg Raymer on his wonderful performance.  See you there next year!!

						   Well...there's been no poker for me the last couple of days.  I really think I needed a break. However, my mind keeps racing with the thoughts of poker and the want/need to get back on the tables.  Am I addicted? Good question.  I feel like I'm jonesin' for it. To keep me occupied while away from poker, someone gave me Starcraft. No manual, so I'm forced to really play around with it and google it to figure how everything works.  The web is a great source of information isn't it?

						   Read over what I've been writing here and must confess that most of it has a negative tone.  Me whining about how the cards treat me.  What do the cards care?  So I went thru my library and picked out  urlLink The Tao of Poker .  Hadn't read that one in quite a long while and thought it might wake me up to the reality of poker and also let me rethink the principles it puts forth. Sometimes you need a smack in the back of the head to clear the fog that clouds your brain.  One thing that hit me was about the feeling I get of unfairness. How I seem to perceive that the game in general and the cards in particular are against me. When I'm in a bad run (like the last month) I always whine and feel that it is always "them,them,them" and for me it's "fold,fold,fold...miss,miss,miss." "They" are always making the hand while I get sucked out on. But if I stop and think about it, most of the time it  will  be "them,them,them." The reason being is that if I look around the table there are 9 other players.  It is 9 against 1!  There are 9 more chances for cards to hit "them."  I had never thought about it like that before. That lesson was a BIG smack in the head for me. That thought actually had a calming effect on me.  To know that the cards aren't out the get me. : )

						   Of course, like just about every other poker player out there, I watch the WPT on television.  I TIVO it watch it a couple of times throught the week, so it seems like it is always on.  My girlfriend listens to it while doing her thing (whatever that may be at the moment) and she'll comment and mimick VVP. She can't stand him, not that I can either. She can't stand the stuff that comes out of his mouth...you know, all the stupid comments he makes during the telecast.  Anyways, last night, VVP is in the Mirage standing with his new best friend James Woods.  Seeing them standing over there, she walks over.    "Aren't you VVP with the WPT?" she asks.    "Yes I am," he replies.    "Well, you sure are annoying!" she blurts. Sweet! I can't believe she said that. She's something else.  I needed that laugh.

						   ...that's my flop seen percentage over the last 200 hands.  And because of that, I go on tilt.  I go all-in w/ 33 with a flop of 449 for $20 in a $25 NL cash game hoping/praying something will fall.  I knew it was stupid but I couldn't stand it anymore! Guy had pocket KK anyways.  How do these guys do it?!?  How are they able to make money and keep moving up so quickly?  I have been at the same level for months and am getting very fucking frustrated! I think I need a break, huh? a layoff.  But I think about the game all the time. Discipline...that's what I need.  The discipline to walk away for a bit and come back fresh.  I  was  hoping to take my break starting 6/8 since I'm going out of town, but I guess I'll be taking my break sooner.

						   Just finished a 1 table SNG over at PokerStars...took 2nd place...yippee!!  I only had $5.88 left there so thought I'd play it on a $5 SNG.  Now it's up to $13.88.  Maybe I'll use that to play a $10 one.  Hmmmm....wonder if I can run it up?

						   I haven't played any poker the last couple of days.  I just haven't felt IT.  Over the last month or so, I've been losing my ass.  I can't seem to get a winning session together.  I did have one a few days ago, but feel like it was more the cards being there than my play.  I'm frustrated! I want to be a good player!! I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. I study my hands, read books, try and put what I read into play, but I'm not moving forward.  My bankroll hasn't moved in months.  How do I move up in playing levels without putting more money in?  I'm still playing .50/$1!   I know...I'm whining.  It's just that I want to move forward with my play, bankroll, level. When does it come together?

						   Why the  HELL  did I play today?!?!? Christ!!  I know that I don't win on Wednesdays, so why did I play???? It pisses me off! Can't blame anyone but myself.  I know better.  For whatever reason, according to PT, I just don't win on wednesdays, but yet, here I was, playing! Dropped $50!! Lost to set over set...Q's over 8's!    When will I listen to my inner voice?  At times during play, I hear THE VOICE telling me the way to play the hand, but I ignore it and end up making the wrong decision.  I NEED TO LISTEN UP!!

						    Poker Tip:   Since you will be starting with the best hand more than anyone else, you will lose with the best hand more than anyone else.   Never quite thought of it like that!  At last!!  I posted a winning session. In my morning session (4am-6am PST) I got a $37 win. It really feels good.   I notice that I tend to question my ability as a poker player when I suffer thru a downtrend.  I question if I'm cut out to be a good poker player, that maybe I just can't grasp the concepts, the intricacies of the game.  I want to become a great poker player.  A player that will be able to quit his shitty job and play. Even thru the losing sessions and the cussing and grumbling, I can't wait to get back to the felt. I find myself thinking about the game all the time. Hell, I even dream about it. Alot. My girlfriend calls poker my mistress and perhaps it is.  I do spend alot of time doing what I love. Love?  Did I say love? heh heh. Love it is then...

						   I found these articles (with more to come) over at ESPN.  Check it out:  urlLink Jay Lovinger   I found this over at The Poker Penguin:  This is not a sad thing, it is a good thing. I do have a reasonable, perhaps even a good, level of people skills. I just lack the tribal / herd instinct that human beings have. I'm not exactly anti-social, I just don't make much effort to create and maintain friendships. I'm usually happier with a good book (or over the last six months, a juicy poker game) than a good party.  I had to laugh. Sounds like me.

						    urlLink    Here's my week by week Profit/Loss sheet &nbsp; urlLink     Things  HAVE NOT  been going very well as of late.  Am I changing?  Am I just in a bad run? I've gotten blown out of PokerStars down to $5.88.  Here's the update:  Empire: $151.07 Party: $187.90 PStars: $5.88 Total: $344.85  Yuck!! Hmmm...thimgs don't add up to my weekly log...I must be missing some hands...

						   497...that's how many hands I played yesterday.  My longest session to date.  Couldn't put anything together though.  I was all over the place.  I was playing at Party and started at the .50/$1 tables.  Played to for quite some time.  Then when one of those tables broke down, I moved to the $1/$2.  Played there awhile before moving to the $2/$4 games.  Got crap all night.  I saw 11% of the flops and ended the night down $41.00.  My only win came in the $25 PL ring game taking in about $35.  If it wasn't for that, it would have really been a bad night.  May has  NOT  been good to me.  Its been nothing but a struggle.  Overall, I'm down $101.15.  A pretty good blow to my bankroll, which isn't much to begin with.  Other than PokerTracker, I haven't really been keeping track of my profit/loss but that is going to change.  I'm in the process of putting a spreadsheet together and keeping better track where I stand. I figure a weekly breakdown.

						   Messed with PokerTracker some more today. Gosh there's alot to it. Don't know exactly where to start. Found some info on 2+2 that dealt with notes on players and that's part of what I want to do. So I ended up running a summary on loose players and ones that played passively and tended to fold on the river. Ran alot of plays thru there and when these players bet, Duh! they have a hand! Used the export to send the notes to the poker sites. Hope that helps.  I wish someone who is an "expert" using PT would put a sort of guide together on the best way to use it.  Or the best way  they  use it. I really want to know the best way to use it to improve my own play.

						   Last night, MR sweat me on the $1/$2 tables at Party.  Damn!  I didn't realize just how much I didn't know about poker.  How much that I am just not picking up.  He'd mention something about my/the game and something would click in my head.  Something like, "Damn, I read that somewhere!" I guess I'm not comprehending what I'm reading. Afterwards, I sent him some hand history's of other games to go over.  Hope that will help my game.  I REALLY want to be a good player.  Overall, I lost about 3BB, so not too bad.

						   Haven't played any poker the last couple of days.  Been reading some.  Going over Roy Cooke's  Real Poker II, The Play of Hands .  When I read that the first time, I just went thru it and remembering that it seemed too much for me.  Now though, I feel like I'm getting it.  I'll probably play some later.  I feel like I'm jonesin' :)

						   Decided to sit in a $2/$4 table.  I normally play .50/$1.  Maybe It's the win I had at $4/$8 live that made me do it.   Nice time for me to move up though.  I cannot get a fucking hand!! If I saw the flop, didn't get a piece.  Getting blinded off and seeing the flop is costing me. I go from my $100 buy-in to $29.  Finally!! Two straight hands and I'm back to $92.  I cash out.  I wasn't intimidated by the play or anything.  The play didn't seem any different. Not as many players saw the flop but tended to be alot of callers.

						   I thought I'd give this blogging a try.  I have a journal that I write in now and then when I'm really stressed so thought I could do that here.  Besides, at times poker is REALLY stressing me out.  Currently I'm playing on Empire and have been getting crap cards..let's see...42 hands...seen the flop...11%  and that  includes  the blinds!!!  Hate these days...  MR finally got back in town. Been 2 years. That flew by! Anyways, we decided to hit the Horseshoe right off check out the joint since Harrah's took over and see if we could see any famous players there.  Walked around and were able to jump into a $4/$8 game sitting right next to each other.  I don't normally play live poker.  I find it too s-l-o-w.  Online you always have cards coming at you when playing multiple tables, but sometimes you just need to get out there and  feel  poker...the cards, the checks, the faces.  The button is 3 spots away so I wait for the blind. While watching, Gilligan (2s) raises in the BB.  Three callers, Flop: -A-T-x, mixed, one club. Gilligan bets, Granny raises (4s), 2 callers. Turn: club, Gilligan bets, Granny raises, 1 caller. River: club, Gilligan bets, Granny calls. Gilligan turns over  52c !!! For the flush!!   Here's my hand of the night: I'm in the BB and peeked to see the ladies, QQ. Granny in the SB raises, 4 players call including me.  We take the flop 5 handed. The flop came A-Q-7 mixed. I had flopped a set. Sweet! Granny bet, I call, 2 callers. I thought briefly if I should raise here in case someone was on a straight draw, but I called. Error? The turn comes the deuce of the 4th suit. Granny bets, I raise, fold, fold, Granny re-raises, I cap.  Granny looks at me for a moment, I smile at her, she calls. River comes a 6. Granny checks, I bet and she RAISES ME!! Huh?  Did I miss something? I study the board...no flush, no straight..AA? Hmmm....I re-raise her, she just calls. I show my set and she angrily mucks. Woohoo...nice big pot! $160 or so.  MR and I left after playing about 2 hours.  I booked a $150 win.  Not bad considering I hadn't sat at a live table in about 3 months.    Bankroll:  Empire  $158.19 Party   $216.75 PStars  $ 37.13    Total        $412.07

						   I've been playing for some time now and this past weekend something happened that set a lightbulb off in my head.  I'm playing live hold'em at a small casino called The Cannery. Since the $4/$8 game was full with 5 names on the list, I decided to sit in a $2/$4 that was just opening up.  I'd been folding for an hour seeing a minimum of 4 players taking the flop when I finally get AKo and I raise, getting 3 callers. Flop is Q,7,4. I bet out and surprisingly two players fold leaving me heads-up. The lady that called played nearly every hand so she could just as well hit the flop. Some of her hands made you shake your head. Anyways, I bet, she called to the river and turned over a J2s having caught a 2 on the turn.  What struck me about this play is that alot of times I try and run AK thru an opponent when I'm heads-up when he doesn't know that he is supposed to get out of the hand. I think for me this is what makes low-limit so frustrating. If these players have any piece of the flop, they're not leaving the hand. You can't bluff these people out. It's funny how I never realized that before.

						   I haven't written in a while because I've been in the dumps lately.  I've been getting my ass handed to me.  Loss after loss after loss.  My play hasn't been bad, but these fuckers at the low-limit games are kicking my ass with the crap they are making hands with.  I feel like I'm just throwing money away.  It's making me depressed.  I feel like I'm in a catch-22 situation: 1)I don't have the funds to play at the higher limits where players "know how to play," and 2)I can't make the money at the lower limits to be able to play at the higher limits. I'm really starting to believe that I just can't beat the low limit games. My biggest complaint is that these players just...don't...fold.  An aquaintance of mine says he is a player that can't beat the $3/$6 or $4/$8 games, but makes a nice income playing $10/$20+. Now ain't that a bitch. I'm thinking maybe I should just save all the money I can over the next 6 mos and put it toward playing the high limits.

						   Not too much to report lately on the poker front. Just been taking it easy.   I've been playing some over at my new poker room called none other than PokerRoom.com. My $100 deposit has grown to $162 which includes a $20 bonus. Not too bad I guess.  Decided to order Lederer's DVD. It's a series of guides and just received to first one. I know that it's a beginner guide but I'm sure I'll pick up something important. I really want to get the second one, which seems more my level. No matter, I'm sure there is plenty for me to learn.  Off topic: 4 months ago, I went on a "diet". I say it like that because it's more a change of eating habits.  Specifically, I embraced  urlLink Eating for Life .  For two years I entered the  urlLink Body for Life  challenge and ended up losing 30lbs and looking and feeling ALOT better. After two years, I started to slack off and ended up gaining back about 15lbs...not bad, but it was slowly coming back. So, 4 months ago, I entered the challenge again and ended up losing those 15lbs.  Those pounds really didn't mean much, it's the body fat% that is the important thing.  Having a Tanita scale sucked! They are  far  from accurate. Which brings me to this week.  A couple of us at work decided to have a contest among the guys. A Fat Boy contest. The one who can get into the best shape in 8 weeks wins. Twenty of us put up $50 each for a winner-take-all prize of $1000.  Nice incentive don't you think? Today I went and had a physical and everything checked out ok but what surprised me was my bf%...16.9%! I was sure I was about 20% and of course the Tanita scale I have said 26.7%. So I'm happy!  We begin the contest next Monday so I've started my plan and goal sheet.  My goal is 11% bf in 8 weeks.  I know I can do this.  The lowest I've ever been was 13%, so 11% is doable.  Wish me luck.

						   As I told you yesterday, I've started playing at PokerRoom.com. I entered a $5 NL tourney with 457 entrants and finished 54th, 14 places out of the money. I flopped two pair (KQ) but got busted by a guy who slowplayed pocket Queens.   I think I'm getting better.

						   I'm playing with cash again. I signed up with Pokerroom.com. They had a nice bonus thru Card Player so I threw in $100. Played about 45 mins at the .50/$1 and won $30. A nice beginning.  At least 60% saw the flop.  We'll see how it goes.

						   Since being on a hellacious bad run for the last month, I'm practically out of money at my 3 sites, though I did cash out $250 from Empire hoping for a reload bonus from someone.  I am out of cash at PokerStars but I do have quite a few FPPs (Frequent Player Points) there. I entered a satellite to their World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP).  This was a limit tourney with 290 entrants and 9 advancing to the super-satellite.  Each level is 15 mins long and we started with T1500. In Levels 1 & 2, I only saw the flop 4 times, two of those in the BB, and I folded on the flop every time.  Level 3 (50/100) brings me AQo in the BB, by the time the action gets back to me, the betting is capped so I fold. Don't know if that was really the right move, but felt that it was still early in the tourney and that I could pick a better spot.  Turns out that I would have missed every street and the pot winner had pocket kings, flopping a set and turning quads. One player called all the way with 98s.  Not alot of play for me up to this point, but Level 4 (100/200) brings me some action. My first hand, I get 66 UTG. I call the $100 BB but when it comes back around it's $190 to me with two players all-in. The flop comes 6AA giving me a full house. Of course I bet out, get one caller (plus the 2 all-ins) and the turn brings a 3. I bet, the caller folds. I'm screaming "No pair, no pair!" but you know what comes: a 3 on the river!! My FH loses to one of the all-ins holding AJo. I win a $200 side pot and I'm down to T850. Crap. I win a couple of small pots and am at T1045 when 88 show up in middle position. There's a raise and RR when it gets to me and I call bringing a RR behind me. Shit.  I call. 4 of us take the flop which brings a sweet 8T8!! Quads, baby!! The four of us cap the flop and see a K come on the turn. Again everyone sees the river card with 2 of us all-in. A third spade comes. At the showdown, two players were holding AK, one rivered their flush and I smacked them all with quads. A pot of T4330 is pushed my way and I'm out of the hole!! I fold my way thru the rest of this level.  Played only one hand in Level 5 (150/300) picking up T675 with 66 UTG. At the break I sit with T4930 which puts me 21 out of 155. Level 6 is very uneventful. I pay to see the flop a few times then folding.  Level 7 (300/600)I finally get a premium hand. AA and I end up going all-in. They hold up for a nice T6767 win. My tight image allowed me to pick up a couple of small pots of T1200 and I'm over T8000.  Not getting any hands I think I start to get impatient and try to buy a couple of pots at Level 8(400/800) but wasn't successful and am bleeding off some of my chips. I drop nearly my whole stack when I call the BB with KTc and see a flop 37T. There's a bet, I raise and get 2 callers. Turn pairs the 3 and I bet out and again get 2 callers. The river is an 8, there's a bet, I call and am raised. Shit! I know I'm beat but there is too much money for me to fold, I call the extra T800 and get shown two pair, tens and eights. I had it until the river! The worst feeling. I'm hurting with only T467 left.  I win a couple of pots putting me up to T4203 when I go stupid!!!!   I raise to T800 UTG with 33(?!?!) One caller and the flop brings 6KT (ALL CLUBS/HIGH CARDS MOJO!!!) I bet, am RAISED and I call(?!?!) Turn: he bets, I call. River: he bets, I'm all-in. Showdown: Mojo702: shows [3s 3h] (a pair of Threes)           kyocera: shows [9c 7c] (a flush, King high)  All she wrote. I finished 38th of 290. Respectable but a stupid way to go out. I should have done better.  Critiques and comments welcome.

						   How much further down can I go?  I guess I can end up losing my whole bankroll, which by the way is down to $250. From $410 to $250 in about 10 days!!  I'm dying here. Nothing seems to be working here. I'm just bleeding off the cash.  I've tighten up my game and playing the "Lee Jones" method, but can't seem to hit a hand. That's variance? The down swing? I like to think this is the bad before the good, but will I survive? Sometimes I feel like giving up, like I can't take it anymore, the losing and tightness I feel when the money is flowing AWAY from me.  And mind you this is playing .50/$1.  Any words of wisdom?  Any soothing ideas, adive for a tortured wannabe poker player?

						   Frustrating. That's what the last week has been. Makes me question my abilities of becoming a winning poker player. The losses continue.  My bankroll of $410 has shrunk to $280. I really don't want to put any more money into it. I was hoping that I would be at the $2/$4 level by now (since starting in January.) I read the other blogs out there of guys kicking ass and running their rolls up hundreds if not a thousand in a few months. Are they that much better than me? Am I that bad of a player? I really didn't think I was but...  After reviewing my play, I believe I need to go back to the basics ala Lee Jones. Some of the plays I've been making are very, very questionable. I'm thinking that I can outplay my opponents, but I can't. At these low-limits, most/alot/some players have no clue thereby making any "play" or a hand that is anything but the nuts a moot point. They just don't fold and are busting my ass.  So, it's back to the basics for this wannabe grinder...

						   Wow, what a rotten 3 days.  I couldn't seem to win a hand, at least very few.  I lost more hands this week on the river than I can remember.  Hand after hand. I would lead on all streets, then get blasted on the river.  Reading the other blogs out there, seems like this has been a bad week for many of them at Party also.  Playing .50/$1 and $1/$2, The fish at Party Poker sunk the hook into me and reeled me in good.  The fish turned out to be barracudas.  I lost $110.00! That was a big bite out of my total roll. I think it forces me to move back down to the .50/$1 games until I recover what I lost.  Hopefully that won't take long.  Wish me luck.

						   I sat down at a typical Party Poker $1/$2 game. You know the ones: loose & aggressive, where money seems to be no object. I was holding my own for about an hour and didn't mind waiting my turn.  Over the course of that hour with players coming and going, the table tightened up quite a bit. I was getting ready to find greener pastures when I looked down to see cowboys!  Yippee-kai-yai-yea!  Sitting two spots in front of the button, there was only one caller when the action got to me so I raised. Everyone folds except the caller (Lucky) who reraises me, so what the hell, I cap it.  The two of us see a flop of  Qh , 8d , 9h  and he lead bets, I raise and we cap again. Oh yeah...a raising war! At this point I figure he's holding TPTK or QQ for a set, but I really didn't think he had the ladies. Just my inner voice telling me no. Did I tell you I hear voices? No? Well, that's another story.  Anyways, with the board showing  Qh , 8d , 9h , the turn brings the  Qs . I'm thinking, "Oh shit!" He checks. Fearing the check-raise, I check behind him. As soon as I checked though, I questioned my decision. I thought maybe I should have bet, maybe to see where he was in the hand, but I thought he surely had his set now. Plus, with the amount of money already in the pot, I'm pretty sure he would have called or even raised me. If I bet, (representing trips), I suppose I would have known for sure I was beat if he called/raised.  The dealer, Louis (I call him Louis; all my dealers are named Louis. Weird, huh?) flips the river card over showing the  As . You know what I'm thinking now, don't you? Of course he bets out and I know I'm beat, but with the pot laying me 9:1, I gotta call. Just in case.  Lucky shows me the Ah8h for two pair on the river! Christ! Unbelievable. Oh well, they were sooted.  I don't think I misplayed this hand. Just got beat. As I explained above, though I questioned my play, I really don't think betting the turn would have forced Lucky to lay his hand down considering he 4 bet preflop and capped again on the flop. If I had represented trips, I believe he would have continued to draw to his flush. Guess in hindsight, I saved myself a bet. Must have been my lucky day... = )

						   Been behind on posting my weekly updates so here's the latest...   (Week 10) 05/24/04-05/30/04  Played 14h 53m  UP +$39.01  Mind you that I'm still playing at the .50/$1 tables.  Though I don't have the 300 BB bankroll "necessary" to play at the $1/$2, I  really  think I'm going to move up in limits. I did play some yesterday afternoon, (even though it was Wednesday) and did ok, winning 17BB.  I lost this hand here and wanted your input:   PokerStars 1/2 Hold'em (10 handed)  Preflop: Hero is SB with Ac, Ah.     UTG calls, UTG+1 folds, UTG+2 folds, MP1 folds, MP2 folds, MP3 folds, CO folds, Button folds, Hero raises, BB calls, UTG calls.  Flop: (6 SB) 9c, 8d, 6c (3 players) Hero checks, BB checks, UTG bets, Hero calls, BB folds.       I don't know why I checked here.  I let him in didn't I?!?! SHIT!!   Turn: (4 BB) Kc (2 players) Hero bets, UTG calls.  River: (6 BB) Jh (2 players) Hero bets, UTG raises, Hero 3-bets, UTG calls.  Final Pot: 12 BB Main Pot: 12 BB, between Hero and UTG. > Pot won by UTG (12 BB).  Results below:   Hero shows Ac Ah (one pair, aces).   UTG shows Qh Td (straight, king high).   Outcome: UTG wins 12 BB.    Comments, critiques, & ass chewing are welcome.

						   Well...the fight is on!  The girlfriend has discovered Sim City!! Now we are both fighting for computer time.  Just like I have thoughts of poker going through my head day and night, she says she has thoughts of Sim City and how she can build a great infrastructure going through her head at all times of the day and night. Funny...  What time I have spent on the PC playing poker has been spent at the NL single and multi table tourneys.  I think that's bad for me considering it has started to take its toll on my bankroll.  Since the WSOP, I've been playing satellites for a chance at PartyPoker's million and quarter million dollar events.  Not doing so well.    My focus, up until these past few days, has been limit hold'em and though I was taking somewhat of a beating (in my eyes anyways), I thought my game was coming along. NL is a whole different ball of wax. Don't really know where I want to go with my poker playing. Do I want to be a grinder or a hotshot? I can see myself being a grinder and making my living doing that...but the thoughts of glory in tourney poker...Guess I will have to do alot more thinking on that...

						   Oh, I forgot to tell you yesterday.&nbsp; About 3 hours into my shift, I tap inot my table after break and greet a guy sitting there ready to play:   Me: "Hi, how are you doing?"  Customer (eyes puffy, red): **sniffle**  Me: "Hmmm..."  Customer: **sniffle** (wiping a tear)  Me (thinking to myself): "WTF?!?!"  Customer: "You wanna know how I'm doing? I feel like my parents just got killed in a car crash!"  Me: "Huh?!?"  Customer then proceeds to tell me bad beat stories after getting knocked out of the Mirage $2000 event on the second hand. And how he was busted from every satellite he played in this week.   Needless to say, I didn't really talk to him, just kinda nodded and felt that he was a crybaby. If you can't stand to lose, don't play. I really had no sympathy for this guy.

						   The WPT $10,000 final event starts at&nbsp;noon today. So far, star sightings are as follows: Phil Ivey, Daniel N, Tomer B, Tobey Mcguire,&nbsp; Scott Fischman, Amir Vahedi, Dewey Tomko. Someone said Sam Grizzle was there but I didn't see him. I&nbsp;saw a couple of lesser named players also but don't care to mention them.&nbsp;

						   Just got done with the $100 Limit tourney. Finished 15th of 41. Raised from the SB with AJ. BB called. Flop came J-7-3. Sweet. TPTK. I bet, he calls. T on the turn. I bet he raises. Shit!! Two pair? Dammit! Decision time....He has it...I know it! I call. River is irrelevant. He shows...T7o. I'm out! Sucks... I much prefer NL tourneys.

						   I had an extra day off today and had decided to play in the Golden Nugget Sunday NL tourney with a $65 buy-in, one $50 rebuy and one $50 add-on.&nbsp;You start with T1500 with 20 min rounds. Thought it would be fun, HOWEVER, Chloe' (my car) let me down. Her battery was dead. I tried to replace it from a number of parts stores, ala Autozone, Checker, PepBoys, but none of them had one to fit my car! It's a&nbsp; 2003 Hyundai Tiburon and none would fit! I'll have to wait until tomorrow and go to the dealer. Crap! I was so looking forward to the tourney.  So...getting ready to play in a Pacific Poker $100 + 9 Limit&nbsp;tourney. See how that goes.  I see that the great  urlLink Ignatious  stopped by. I must be moving up in the blog world. Been reading Sir Guinness's blog for quite some time now and love it. Anyone reading this needs to check it out.

						   Went over to the GBC today to pickup Small Stakes Hold'em. What the fuck is wrong with the place? There is birdshit EVERYWHERE!! It's gross. Pidgeon shit galore. Yet I didn't see any birds. Then when I came out, some bitch was digging thru the garbage can out back. This town&nbsp;has certainly hit the big time. It's a real big city now with the traffic, crime, and degenerates that other big cities have. Sucks. Wish people would visit but not stay....&nbsp;

						   I haven't blogged in a few days because nothing new is going on.&nbsp; Played live hold'em&nbsp; a couple of times and have been hitting the MTT's late at night, perhaps I should say morning (around 4-5am).&nbsp; Been getting my ass handed to me lately but I guess that's nothing new. My play has been stagnant; I'm not improving. Sometimes I feel that it's gone to hell. &nbsp; Ed Miller from 2+2 has a new book just released yesterday(?) about playing in loose games, so I plan on picking it up tomorrow at The Gambler's Book Store.&nbsp;I need something for these loose games.&nbsp;Don't think Lee Jones is doing it for me. &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   Played in the $125 Limit HE tourney at the Orleans Open yesterday. 1009 entrys. Finished about the same place as last year. Busted out 3 hands after the third break. I think last year was 5 hands after the third break. Just didn't get very many hands and couldn't build any kind of stack.   Got pocket QQ once, Three of us see a flop come A-K-x, I bet, 2 players called. One was a pretty tight player and I knew he had an ace or king. Turn comes a rag, I bet other player raises, tight player calls and I think a little, and fold. At showdown, tight player had AJ and wins pot. I was happy with that.   The tourney lasts though July 25th. Maybe I'll try a NL game. We'll see.

						   On Thursday, I played another MTT. 67 entrants and ended up taking first. Nice addition to my bankroll. So over the last 10 days, I've done pretty well in the SnG's and MTT's lately with a first, second, and monied in 4 of 7 singles.

						   Played in a $10+$1 tourney at 5:00am this morning.  Had just gotten home from work at thought I'd sit in. Ended up 2nd out of 78 for a cash of $156. Again, I feel I played pretty solid. Didn't feel I made too many mistakes. Pretty much bet when I had a hand and let go when I missed.  I feel like I'm getting better at these tourneys. Preparing for this weekends Orleans Open.

						   I just completed the super-satellite that I won my way into. Busted out 30th of 334. Not a bad showing but if you don't money or move on, what's so good about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that I made it that far into the tourney, but I want to be able to money.   A couple of key hands:  Hand #1) We're at Level 8 (200/400/25). In the SB (6705 in chips) I get dealt  [Ac Kc] . It's raise in MP and I call the T1800. Three of us take a flop that shows  [6h 5d 7c] . I check (not sure why...showed weakness?), MP bets 2401 and is all-in, preflop raiser folds, and I call the raise. Turn brings  [6c]  and the river  [Jh] . I lose to pocket deuces. I'm hurting with T2200 left.  Hand #2) With the blinds at 300/600/50 I knew I wouldn't last long and had to make a move soon. Being in the cutoff, I'm dealt  [Qd Ks] . Everyone folds to me and I thought "This is it. Gotta do it now." I raise all-in T4200 and the button calls! Pocket rockets!! The board is no help and I'm gone in 30/334.   I think I played these hands well. Just ran into better cards.

						   Today the Tour de France begins with a prologue. A 3.6mi time trial. Lance Armstrong will be trying to write history by winning his 6th consecutive Tour.  Good luck to Lance.  I played another multi table tourney last night. 502 entries. I played very solid.  Making the right calls, right plays, right bets. I didn't get great cards like the night before, but was able to play them right.   The hand that I question is the hand that knocked me out...opinions please.  Playing shorthanded w/ 6 and blinds at 1000/2000.  I'm in the SB holding Ts9c. 2 callers, I call and BB checks. We take the flop 4 handed.  ***FLOP***      [9s2s5c] Seeing that I have top pair and a backdoor flush draw I bet out 2000. 1 caller  ***TURN***      [9s2s5c]5d Hmmm.....Caller could have 9 w/ better kicker, A2(?),A5(?),K5(?),55(probably would have raise me). I go all-in for 10K. Crap! He calls...he has me covered.  ***RIVER***      [9s2s5c][5d]2h He turns over the Kh5h for the full house.  Reviewing the play, I think I should  have went all-in on the flop. Either way, with the other player getting a piece of the flop, he probably would have called anyways...  A complaint about Pacific Poker. For some reason, my connection to them is bad. It's not my ISP since I can surf the web without any problem. They have not disconnect protection. Why can't they just treat your hand as all-in? I turn a set of 7s and can't play! I'm folded! Shit that sucks.

						   I did it!!  I placed in a satellite to a super over at PokerStars. A 50 FPP buy-in with 130 entrants allowing 9 to advance to a 500 FPP buy-in super to WCOOP Event #5 NLHE $500,000 guarantee.  Now I just need to get thru the next one.  I'm happy. The best I've done so far.    Over the last month, I've been playing alot more multi table tourneys and have been doing better and better.  Hope it keeps up.  I played alot more aggressive in this tourney than I have in the past.  I think being aggressive is something that you have to get used too. To be willing to put your chips in and hope/pray/believe that your cards hold up.  I plodded along until Level 4 when the blinds get up to 50/100.  Start picking up blinds and a few small pots. Am pretty much where I started chip-wise.  Level 5 (75/150) puts me all-in with the following:      **I'm shortstack w/ T1275, I get QQ in MP. A caller then a   raise to T300.  I go over the top for all my chips. I get a caller and flop a set.  Sweet!  20 more hands I've worked my way up to T7700. Not too shabby. Almost average. Hand #142 sees me sitting w/ T2900 and the blinds 200/400/25. At this point I'm praying for a rush of cards. I go all-in w/ ATo, get one caller.  Flop an A and beat pocket 3s to double up. Over the next 40 hands, I get as high as T9500 before pissing chips away from missed flops.   We're a couple of hands into Level 10 (400/800/50) playing shorthanded and I'm down to T6495 when my hand of the day happens.       **UTG I get KhQh and raise to T2400. The SB reraises me T15971 to T18371 and is all-in. Damn it!! I sit and call time. My heart is thumping in my chest; my palms are sweating; my knees are shaking. I use up nearly all my time when I say "fuck it" and call. He turns over KK!! I figure I'm dead and will bust out one off the money.             *** FLOP *** [5c 8c 2h]   SB had 95% chance of winning        *** TURN *** [5c 8c 2h] [3h]   80%        *** RIVER *** [5c 8c 2h 3h] [Ah]      *** SHOW DOWN *** SB: shows [Kd Ks] (a pair of Kings) Mojo702: shows [Qh Kh] (a flush, Ace high) Mojo702 collected 13940 from  pot That's right!! RUNNER RUNNER FLUSH!!   THAT'S NO LIMIT, BABY!!!!   Preflop SB was a 86% favorite!    I work my way up to T25000 before someone busts out and I advance.  There is nothing sweeter than making your first tourney.

						   This movie...who wrote this shit?!?! It has too be one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. It's like the writers, actors, script, and whatever else tried way too hard to be funny. To try and capitalize off the first film, The Whole Nine Yards, which  was  funny. Willis' character was a fucking hitman, a semi-serious character too Perry's goofball persona in the first film. This Ten Yards bullshit was wayyy out of line. Total garbage.
