      If the good girls go to heaven, then where do the rest of us wind up. I am 23 tears rolling down my face, my father is dead, I am dead too, too sick to stand straight, too much pain to move away, I stand there next to his grave realizing that I am seeing him for the last time. He is dead. I miss him so much, i miss his smile his voice and his love. He was not just my father he was my hero, a man that bridged the parts of my life like a new colossoss, He holds such sway over me even now, he was the man I most wanted to be like and never could. He was a man of infinite jest, who bore me upon him back a thousand times, a great quote the describes my father, but another quote leaps out to me as well, tommorrow tommorrow tommorrow, life crawls forward at its petty pace,he a a poor player that frets and struts his hour on the stage, it is a tale told by an idiot of great sound and great fury, but ultimately signifinig nothing, as did my fathers life

      When did I loose my freedom? When did I decide to stop letting myself move forward in search of my dreams? When did I sell my soul for comfrot and a smile? The war moves on but it has lost a soilder in me. I rember the sweet kiss of summers past, standing on the side of bear lake road, in maine. Holding a woman in my arms, and feeling the sweet touch of freedom. Then forward motion seemed easy, it seemed natural, now it just seems so damn far away. I have become a man since that summer just a few summers ago. War broke out in my life, my body failed me and showed all that I was all too frail. looking from my hospital bed feeling pain in every nerve of my body I saw my end, 24 and dying already. the same at 23, still too sick, still feeling too old for my own age. I felt like Lee toward the end of the war, not winning but takeing each attack as they came, trying to hold on to hope, and faith, they both left me though when I needed them most. God turned from me leaving me to fight my own battles, alone, like he leaves all of his childrem when they need him most, My God My God why has't thou forsaken me? I lost my earthly father like some sick joke, like a deeply lost sick joke that left me as the punch line. Now I am tied to a world that I did not create it was one I just inherieted, I got a great gift, just the end of my innocence and my carefree and happy days. All is vanity Anne Bradstreet had written, but vanity is the only thing God gives man, He does not give us enlightenment or help he just gives us the feeling of self worth, that in the end is worthless. Forward is our only option, behind us seems to lie only death.

      In one of the last speeches Abraham Lincoln gave he called on the nation both north and south to help heal the wounds of that awful war that they had just come through, we today need to do much of the same. We live in a divided nation, I live in a divided Generation. The two extremes yelling at each other to be heard, trying to push the other without listening. Hot topic issues create strife between classes, friends, and families, and we must stop that now. I am not a soldier, but some of my closets friends are and I and their families fear for their safety everyday. Not because we are not true patriots, or that we are against the war, we just worry that one unlucky shot, or bomb, or accident, will kill a good man, woman, or child. Our friends are putting their lives on the line for, what I believe is to be called a good cause, but that does not make us worry any less. I live in a largely military community, and many children here have at least one parent missing from home. They come into where I work to get food and to get away from the fact that they are at least one parent down, they have those same fears that we all keep for our loved ones over there, but on a level that we cannot imagine. My job and I have tried to help by simply donating little things to the children of soldiers, in our case its just pizza, but to see the looks on the children faces you would think that we are giving them pure gold. We do this not because we are partiots trying to do a good thing for our country, but as people trying to do a good thing for our common man. I also believe we need to help children in our child welfare system, because I am a product of that same system. As I reach quickly in adulthood I thank God that I was adopted out of that same system by people that honestly believed that I could be more than just a number on a case workers file. They took me into their home, along with my sister and made us one of their family. We as a nation need to remember these children as well. They are our brothers and sisters and they cannot be left to feel as not wards of the state, but opens of that same state. We must love all of them, and allow not one to be lost again in a world that they believe does not love them. So this is where my challenge lies, somewhere around you there are hundreds of kids that need a friend, at school, at church, in your neighborhood, there are children that need a little love, to make them a success and to give them back dignity and self-worth. If we help them today, they may not become tomorrow's criminals. To help our peers, help our future should be one of the goals placed down in front of the nation. The ways are simple go outside of your comfort zones and get uncomfortable. I helped set up and afterschool tutoring program for kids in some of the more dangerous sections of town. I am not saying that I changed the world as a whole, but I hope that I changed the world of at least one. The time for talk is over the time for action is now, we are loosing a war for America's future and that in my eyes may be more important than a war against terror. I fear terror, but I do not live in it, but there are thousands of children that do. Thousands of kids that feel that the world does not care if they live or die, and that is wrong, we all must care. It is our duty to help complete what Lincoln told us to do so long ago. To help the future will help us end an age of neglect. These kids do not want a government subsides, they want to feel like the government cares. Help me, help yourselves and most of all help them, by becoming active in your community, church, school, or anywhere else you feel that you can help. Help me start a revolution, a revolution of caring. Thank-you

      Where in the social Contract did I sign away my right to drive without a seatbelt? This question has been driving me nuts for years. I can drink, and I can smoke, at least for the time being until the almighty Levithan takes that away from me too, why then can I not drive in my car without a seat-belt? Does the state have a right to save me, if I do not wish to be saved? It's not like I am in personal danger by not wearing one, there is a possibility that I may be, but its not inheirient, it is based only on the chance that I am going to get into a serious accident. So if we use this logic, then we must argue that all things that can lead to serious accidents, must and should be attended too by the state! I find that idea severly scary, I don't want to see police stopping football games, because someone might get hurt, that is simply stupid! So then why are we letting them enforce and make money off of us that do not believe that we are taking our lives into our own hands. And honestly all the arguments that are going to be raised against this thought will be based on one thing, MONEY! The police do not do this to protect us, if so then the speed limit would be 25 and SUV's would be gone from the road forever, they do this too keep their town and their jobs in money! Now before the arguement comes that seat belts save lives, I will admit they do, being the son of a funeral director in the deep south I have seen many accidents where seat belts might have saved lives, but then again I have also see seat belts kill people as well, but this arguement is niether here nor there, the question I ask is can and should the state be allowed to force you to do something without your consent? or without the true power to do so? Under what Power does the state enforce this law? and if we can explain that, then we must ask how come the standard of this logic is not applied to all things? How can one thing be enforced apon us without hesitation, or voice. Does this law hold up in court? I would say that its never been tested, and I hope one day it will be, Join me and let us topple the wrong here. Alone we die,together we change.

      This is the first of my offical thoughts as placed on the net. I am not sure why I am doing this? Honestly I guess it's because I feel somewhat lost in the world around me again. Milton once stated that we lost paradise, That we as a group of beings, just one day decided to leave the sight and the grace of God, by choice. Honestly I have often questioned the idea that we have chosen to leave God, Honestly it feels more like he left us. That one day, much like when I was in the first grade, he put down his new favorite toy once it started to bore him. I am however not an non-believe or even an agnostic, I know there is a power grater than us in the universe. Honestly it would be simply ego to believe that we are all that is in the universe. But like I was saying maybe I am just lost again? I once felt like I had all the answers, that my rage, hate, and intelligence would be enough to see me through, but now it seems like I am not the only one lost here in Paradise. We like the things that are esay, but all we find is that life is hard. And that God is simply indiffernt to those of us lost in the wilderness. We live in what maybe one of the greatest civilizations on earth, and we are just lost in the world around us, because this paradise has a dark side in it, that is what this site is, us looking into the darkness of paradise.

      why did I not go with you? Jason and Jason, you who embody the beat revolution, you who really where " on the road " Why could I not follow your lead? Mike who was lost in the works of Heller and Vonnegutt, you should have enbraced your true fathers, of tennyson and Byron. You were " Mad bad and Dangerous to know" but you stood there thinking that you were stephen and I was your bloom. I stood there laughing and snikering they way that Elliot or Joyce must have, knowing that in my soul I understood them. They were my brothers in those long nights of lonely friendship. They asked the questions that I longed to know and stated the truth that really existed, Like dear Alfred, " I do not believe the siren's sing for me also". I have long lost the power of my youth, the adventure of my childhood. The Quest has gone to long and I can no longer reach the Grail, I am now impure tainted by the power of reality and its evil stink.  I know longer walk with Kings, but once did. I was the black prince, that richard so feared. Now I am a sick and broken man that calls on dead poets like some used to call on spirits. I ask them with the ouji of my mind but the answers come back nonsense, I have not faith enough anymore to fool around. I longed to see the beauty of this creation, but like Milton in the end I have just gone blind. Oh Jason, Oh Jason why hast thou spirit forsaken me? Why can I now not know long embrace, the knowledge of enlightenment that we once knew, when Melvelle let us in that one time and we could embrace the whale simply as The Mystery and we were happy with it? I was happy with it. Mike how could we cry over things like the hopelessness of catch-22 and now you are in that role, driving a tank, in a war that in your soul I know you loathe. But reality makes a mockery of us all, and history will judge us as a quote, " They were of Great Sound and Great fury but ultimately they signified nothing" Travel on my brothers, I am lost and I fear never too return.

      forward Motion, it seems simple enough, but really is it? Newton said " An object in motion tends to stay in motion", but there are times in our lives in which that statement does not seem as true as others. I mean people say its a law that is unversally found to be true, but I have found that its not. We as a people seem to try and move forward but then we stumble back, lets look at one of those great acheievements that we just bring back to the stone age, the internet. One of the greatest places to find and use knowledge to create a new world, but 95% of it is used for porn. It is paradoxes like this that keep me awake at night, getting invite for web cam pages. One step forward 2 back. I guess I am not above it all, but honestly I do not wish to get dirty, maybe its the snob in me, or just the fact that I wish that we could be more than our colective urges. But hope I guess is just a lie they tell you too keep trying to move forward. I honestly had not noticed the type of pessimist I have become until I started reading my own posts, maybe in the end we will win. Until then we can only press on

      The other day the woman I loved told me that she was not special at anything that she was too normal. The true answer is that she is anything but normal. She is a woman of exceptional strenght because I have had to lean on her for the better part of two years now. She is the strength in our relationship, she took me from an angry and broken man too a man that wants to go forward and conquer the world. She has given me new hope and made me a person again, no longer is hate the ruling force in my life, she replaced it with love. Happiness is the gift that she brings to the world, and the vision of a better world is her voice. She see's the world for what it could and should be, that is not to say that she is naive or turns away from reality, she just knows that things are supposed to be better than what we make them. It is that idea, that vision that makes her ahead of her time. Di Venice and Shakespeare were both men who knew the human condition but ultimately believed that we where better than that, and that is what my love believes as well. She see's me for being better than I am and for that I love her. She is amazaing and beautiful and she is mine and there is nothing better in the world to me than hearing her say that she is mine as well.
