      When you tried to kiss me I only bit your tongue. When you tried to get me together I only came undone. When you tried to tell me The one for me was you, I was in your mattress back in 1982.  Daria, I won't be soothed. Daria, I won't be soothed over like, Smoothed over like milk, Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt, Icing on a cake, Or a serene translucent lake. Daria, Daria, Daria, I won't be soothed. I won't be soothed.   When you tried to tell me Of all the love you had, I was cleaning oil from beaches Seeing only what was bad. When you tried to feed me I only shut my mouth. Food got on your apron And you told me to get out.   Daria, I won't be soothed. Daria, I won't be soothed over like, Smoothed over like milk, Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt, Icing on a cake, Or a serene translucent lake. Daria, Daria, Daria, Daria, Daria, Daria, Daria, I won't be soothed. I won't be soothed.

      You won't admit you love me. And so how am I ever to know? You only tell me Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. A million times I ask you, And then I ask you over again. You only answer Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. If you can't make your mind up, We'll never get started. And I don't wanna wind up Being parted, broken-hearted. So if you really love me, Say yes. But if you don't, dear, confess. And please don't tell me Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. If you can't make your mind up, We'll never get started. And I don't wanna wind up Being parted, broken-hearted. So if you really love me, Say yes. But if you don't, dear, confess. And please don't tell me Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

      At first I was afraid, I was petrified Kept thinkin’ I could never live without you by my side Then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong And I grew strong And I learned how to get along  And so you’re back from outer space I just walked in to find you here, with that sad look upon your face I should have changed that stupid lock I should have made you leave your key If I had known for just one second you’d be back to bother me  Go on now, go walk out the door Just turn around now ’coz you’re not welcome anymore Weren’t you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?  Did you think I’d crumble?  Did you think I’d lay down and die?  Oh no not i, I will survive For as long as I know how to love, I know I’ll stay alive I’ve got all my life to live And I’ve got all my love to give I’ll survive I will survive Hey hey  (i, I will survive) Hey hey (i, I will survive) Every day (i, I will survive) Oh yeah  It took all the strength I had not to fall apart Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high And you see me, somebody new I’m not that chained up little person still in love with you And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free But now I’m savin’ all my lovin’ for someone who’s lovin’ me  Go on now, go walk out the door Just turn around now You’re not welcome anymore Weren’t you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?  Did you think I’d crumble?  Did you think I’d lay down and die?  Oh no not i, I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I’ll stay alive I’ve got all my life to live And I’ve got all my love to give I’ll survive I will survive Hey hey  Go now, go walk out the door Just turn around now ’coz you’re not welcome anymore Weren’t you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?  Did you think I’d crumble?  Did you think I’d lay down and die?  Oh no not i, I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I’ll stay alive I’ve got all my life to live And I’ve got all my love to give I’ll survive I will survive I will survive  (i, I will survive) Hey (i, I will survive) Every day (i, I will survive) Yeah yeah  (i, I will survive) Oh (i, I will survive) I will survive (i, I will survive)  (i, I will survive) I’ve got all my love to give (i, I will survive) I’ve got all my life to live (i, I will survive) My loving is not in vain, oh no  (i, I will survive) I will survive (i, I will survive) I will survive (i, I will survive) Hey  (repeat to end)

      All my bags are packed I'm ready to go I'm standing here outside your door I hate to wake you up to say goodbye. But the dawn is breaking it's early morning The taxi is waiting, he is blowing his horn Already I'm so lonesome, I could cry  So kiss me and smile for me Tell me that you wait for meHold me like you never let me go  I'm leaving on a jetplane,I don't know when I'll be back again Oh babe I hate to go  There is so many times I've let you down So many times I've played around I tell you now they don't mean a thing. Every place I go I think of you Every song I sing I sing for you. When I come back I wear your wedding-ring   So kiss me and smile for me Tell me that you wait for meHold me like you never let me go  I'm leaving on a jetplane,I don't know when I'll be back again Oh babe I hate to go   Now the time has come to leave you One more time let me kiss you Close your eyes, and I'll be on my way Dream about the days to comeI wont have to leave alone, and I wont have to say:   So kiss me and smile for me Tell me that you wait for meHold me like you never let me go  I'm leaving on a jetplane,I don't know when I'll be back again. I'm leaving on a jetplane,I don't know when I'll be back again. I'm leaving on a jetplane,I don't know when I'll be back again.  Oh babe I hate to go.

      Don't leave me in all this pain Don't leave me out in the rain Come back and bring back my smile Come and take these tears away I need your arms to hold me now The nights are so unkind Bring back those nights when I held you beside me  (chorus) Un-break my heart Say you'll love me again Un-do this hurt you caused When you walked out the door And walked outta my life Un-cry these tears I cried so many nights Un-break my heart, my heart  Take back that sad word good-bye Bring back the joy to my life Don't leave me here with these tears Come and kiss this pain away I can't forget the day you left Time is so unkind And life is so cruel without you here beside me  (Chorus)  Ohh, oh Don't leave me in all this pain Don't leave me out in the rain Bring back the nights when I held you beside me (rpt Chorus except last line)  Un-break my Un-break my heart, oh baby Come back and say you love me Un-break my heart Sweet darlin' Without you I just can't go on Can't go on

      You're just too good to be true I can't take my eyes off you You feel like heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much At last love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive You're just too good to be true I can't take my eyes off you  Pardon the way that I stare There's nothing else to compare The sight of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak So darling feel like I feel And I don't have to know if it's real You're just too good to be true I can't take my eyes off you  Bada...  I love you baby And if it's quite all right I need you baby to warm a lonely night I love you baby Trust in me when I say  Oh pretty baby Don't bring me down, I pray Oh pretty baby Now that I've found you stay So let me love you baby Let me love you  You're just too good to be true I can't take my eyes off you You feel like heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much At last love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive You're just too good to be true I can't take my eyes off you  Bada...  I love you baby And if it's quite all right I need you baby to warm a lonely night I love you baby Trust in me when I say  Oh pretty baby Don't bring me down, I pray Oh pretty baby Now that I've found you stay So let me love you baby Let me love you
