      I'm really pissed right now. Its 45 minutes until midnite on a Sunday, and I'm working at the office to try to appease a client I never wanted to serve in the first place.   Nothing else to say.   I have worked for this firm since 1990. I think I'm going to leave. In fact, I think I've already left the firm mentally. I just don't know where I'm going next. But I think I'm already gone. I think that was the title of an Eagle's song.

      Here is the first part of a short story I have written. Let me know if you are interested in seeing more.                                          Around Here  	By five minutes after six o’clock on Saturday morning, Calvin Powell had showered, shaved, and had buttoned the last in a row of buttons on his starched white shirt. He could smell coffee brewing as he stood upright from tying his shoes. He buckled his brown leather belt and straightened his khaki pants. As he walked down the hallway to the kitchen, the closed bedroom door on his left reminded him there were three guests in that room. As he approached the kitchen on his right, he looked into the living room on his left and saw his eighteen month old granddaughter Abigail sitting in front of the television set and realized he had been wrong. There were only two guests in that room. The youngest was awake already. 	Lucille was dressed, too. Like Calvin, she was dressed today just as any other day except Sunday. She wore a lightweight cotton dress indistinguishable from the dresses she had worn other days, except it was sky blue with small flowers in contrast to the green, yellow, pink, and white dresses with larger flowers and smaller butterflies she wore at other times. She wore an apron to protect her dress from the splattering sausage she was cooking to accompany the pancakes she would make once everyone was awake.  	“Abigail has already eaten,” Lucille said, leaning her head back to point towards the eighteen month old in the other room, while her eyes directed Calvin’s attention to the Pop-Tart wrapper on the counter.  	Calvin said good morning to Lucille, kissed her softly on the lips, poured his coffee, and walked over to the table where Lucille already had the paper set aside for him. It was the same routine he had followed nearly every day for thirty six years.
