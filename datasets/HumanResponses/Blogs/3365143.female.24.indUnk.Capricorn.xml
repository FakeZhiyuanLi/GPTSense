      3 Krispy Kreme glazed donuts and counting...  Not the greatest start to my new health conscious life but at least I am having fun...and of course I am still eating healthy things. I just like to intersperse them with some not so healthy things for variety. Nobody likes monotony.

      Today is the second day of my new life -my new life of being a healthy person. Now, I wasn't an overly unhealthy person to begin with but I have decided that I could do with a bit more fruit, a few more vegetables and a lot more water.  Yesterday I enjoyed my hearty soup for lunch and spaghetti bolognese for dinner. I had delicious baked apples stuffed with sultanas and served with mascarpone for desert. I also enjoyed some hommous and rice cakes as well as an apple, carrot, celery and tomato juice care of the  urlLink juice tiger . I love the juice tiger -I just wish it would clean itself.  Today, I am continuing my new health kick. I have a bottle of water which I aim to empty twice today beside me at my desk. I also have a delicious ricotta cheese, alfalfa, lettuce, ham, tomato and a sprinkle of salt and pepper on rye bread sandwich as well as some left over soup from yesterday. I have no idea what I am going to have for dinner but I do know that it is going to be healthy. I'm feeling better (and very virtuous) just thinking about all this goodness.  I also have decided on a few projects for June. I actually managed to rediscover DLP's scarf last night and have even knitted a few more rows! I am looking forward to doing some jam and chutney research this week in preparation for Sunday and I am thinking of doing a few projects from the  urlLink not martha  website, notably the gorgeous marble magnets and the simple but oh so cute and colourful and elegant wine charms! These projects should keep me busy for a while!

      Today has been spent with my best friend Miss S pottering around the kitchen. We actually tried Clotilde's tomato jam and made delicious soup -perfect for me to take to work tomorrow for lunch as well.  Clotilde's jam looked lovely -vibrantly red with lovely golden specks and it smelt divine -so sweet and cinnamony! The only thing is we just didn't have the perfect sized jars -either too big or too small. So at 4.35pm (on a Sunday!)we drove across to the Essential Ingredient (Australia St, Camperdown) for some jam jars. On the way we devised a list of other necessities ...or things that we merely desired! These things included (but were not limited to) Jamie Oliver cookbook, pastry brush, baby egg whisk, funnel and a lasagne dish. Unfortunately (or luckily for our bank balances) the store had just closed by the time we got there! We have now decided to make do with what we have but we are going to go across next Sunday and get loads of jars for pickles and chutneys so that we can spend the entire day cooking and jamming.  Part of my list of necessities is a casserole dish. I have wanted one for ages and have finally narrowed my choices down to 2 -the one that I want and the one that I can afford. I don't think I can justify the one that I  urlLink want  so I am going to go this week (or wait til next Sunday) and get the one that I can afford  urlLink afford . I am really looking forward to making some more delicious casseroles and soups this winter.

      Food seems to be a huge preoccupation for me at the moment. I've always loved food and luckily have never had to worry about my weight :-) I think it helps that I'm naturally inclined towards food that is fresh, healthy, natural and delicious! Fruits and vegetables, cheeses and bread (no Atkins for me!) are all favourites.  I have recently stumbled across Clotilde's blog,  urlLink chocolate and zucchini , which I am adoring. She is a french woman living in Paris who has some amazing recipes and a fabulous daily relationship with food. I am totally in awe of her. Her site is also giving me lots of ideas for new taste sensations and I am thinking of trying so many recipes including the cherry tomato cinnamon jam as soon as possible. I think it's going to be hard though to leave it untouched for the necessary few months.  My shopping list for my bachelorette weekend includes: -ricotta cheese -tomatoes -roma and cherry -bagels -rye bread -alfalfa -avocado -lamb roast -hommous -tabouli  My mouth is watering just thinking about the feasts that are in store. In addition to Clotilde's jam I think I am also going to try her tomates confites (slow roasted tomatoes). I am truly a woman inspired!

      Why is that some people get it so wrong when it comes to makeup?? Every evening a girl gets on my bus and I always wonder why she can't see how terrible she looks or even why neither her family or friends point out to her that the amount and the colour of her makeup is totally unsuitable??  Ok, I admit that I'm no expert when it comes to makeup and it's more than likely that some people think certain things about my makeup but I do believe that I am in a position to say that orange makeup isn't attractive on anyone! Actually now that I'm on a rant, neither is over the top heavy eye makeup when it just makes people look incredibly tired! I look at the girl on the bus and I can't even imagine what she looks like without makeup. I think that's really sad. I wonder how pretty she is without all the mismatched and overdone make up?  So having admitted that I am not an expert in the makeup department I would like to share my little tip with the world. Before last year I had never actually used or attempted to use eyeliner. A visit to the  urlLink MAC  counter at Grace Bros (now Myer) changed all that! I was introduced to the amazing world of dark eyeshadow and sexy little  urlLink slanted brushes . I can't get enough of this look and am a self-professed expert using black and dark brown. For evening I dip my brush in water and daytime it's just a quick dip in the shadow and straight across my upper lashes. I can't recommend it enough.

      of the things that are important right now!  1. getting a fantabulous new job in the area that I want to work ie foreign affairs! 2. finishing a few books that i've had lying around forever, including From Beirut to Jerusalem 3. kicking ass in my german class and learning to speak german with confidence 4. finally finishing the scarf for D that I have been working on forever (well 1.5 years at least!) It's a bit wiggly but it's the thought that counts right? Plus the wool is unbelievably soft and cuddly. 5. getting into shape and turning my body back a few years! It's unbelievable how long it's been since I've done some serious, consistent exercise and my body is beginning to show it :-( 6. finally getting enough money together so that I don't feel like crying every time my credit card statement arrives. I have only been working full time for 6 months now! 7. making a concerted effort with a few friends that I don't treat as well as I should and also with the few members of my family that I am still in contact with! 8. learning some fabulous new recipes -maybe some casseroles, and definitely some fantastic desserts that would be perfect for girls' dessert and movie night in 2 weeks. Actually basically I'm just going to become a kitchen superstar. 9. getting a casserole dish (to complete my kitchen superstardom!)

I’ve been to and lived in all sorts of places but I am back to where I started for the moment   I speak German. Badly  I would like to live in Europe one day  The love of my life is Canadian   He's really cute and makes me laugh til it hurts  He's also pretty clever and knows everything   I think that true love is when you adore someone for their quirks and when they move across the world to be with you   I love plane food. I think it’s all the little containers   I really love little containers   I like make-up –not necessarily wearing it, more coveting it, buying it and then not using it  I hate black toilet seats...and toilet seats that aren’t attached   I really don't like incorrect punctuation and bad spelling but sometimes I am careless and make mistakes too so I am a little understanding of other people's errors :-)   I hate people who speed and drive like idiots   I'm scared of heights  I can’t drink things when I am in motion –walking or in the car or anything. It’s just physically not possible but it is very funny to watch me try   I want a Vespa scooter and a new VW bug and I will make do with a much more affordable/sensible/boring Toyota Echo hatchback (in black with tinted windows)  I want a pair of jeans that fit. I’ve been lucky enough to find a pair of black pants that fit beautifully–now I only wish I had bought more than one pair of them when I found them   I would like to beat up Liv Tyler –she bugs me. She bugs me more than any other actress although I do think she was good in Lord of the Rings and I like that she isn’t a skinny waif. She still bugs me though. I don’t like her mouth. So there.   I have to pick all the white stuff off oranges and mandarins otherwise I won’t eat them   I have a crush on Audrey Hepburn  I cry a lot, especially in movies  I have 1 brother, 3 half brothers and a half sister  My mother likes to marry a lot  I don't have any contact with my mother  I have a wicked stepmother. I try not to have too much contact with her  I have a university degree in commerce and one in liberal arts  I currently don't use my degree as I work in admin at a university where my brains are slowly getting sucked out of my head  It doesn't really worry me because I don't use my brains at the moment anway  In the long term I would like a job that uses my brains and is in the area of international relations  If that doesn't work out I would like to write for Gourmet Traveller  Alternatively, I am open to the possibility of having a sugar daddy and not working at all  I love reading -fantasy, historical fiction and travel literature in particular  I love the song "Via Con Me" by Paolo Conte from the movie Mostly Martha  One of my favourite movies is Mostly Martha  I don't like humming or people who hum  I like to hum the theme from "Breakfast at Tiffany's" -quietly though so nobody (including me) knows  I can be a little anally retentive about my kitchen. I like things to go in the same place. Ideally I would like to be able to find everything with my eyes closed. Unfortunately my better half has other ideas  I always like to have a favourite item of the moment. It can be a kitchen utensil, a piece of clothing or a beauty find. I think I just like new stuff  My favourite number is 8. I like how symmetrical it is (it's a very pretty number) and I like the association with infinity  I like the colour  blue  - all   shades   of   it   At the moment I like buying things in a brilliant shade of  red   My favourite flowers are tulips. Tulips always put me in a really good mood. I should probably buy more tulips  I don't drink coffee. I've never tried it. I hate the smell and I dislike coffee-flavoured things  The only tea I drink regularly is chai tea from Timothy's in Canada  I like vodka, lemon and lime and I am also partial to frangelico on ice  I prefer red wine to white  I don't smoke and hate the smell of cigarette smoke on my hair and clothes after a night out  I love Origins Nude and Improved tinted moisturiser.

They are so crisp and tasty  I don't eat bananas unless they are in something. I like the taste but not the texture  I am 5 foot 4 (164cm). I would like to be an inch or two taller  I have a very slight build and struggle to maintain my weight  I hate it when people tell me I'm skinny -to me it's just as bad as if someone was to call me fat  I wish I had hair that didn't kick out at the end  My favourite AFL team is the Melbourne Demons. They're my favourite cos they're also my Dad's favourite team  My brother likes to go for any team that is playing the Demons  I love playing squash even though I don't think I have ever won a game  Scrabble is my favourite board game  I also like trivial pursuit  I'm always right. It's just one of those things that people realise after knowing me for a while  My brother also thinks he is always right. He's realised though that he is always right  except  when he is arguing with me. Same goes for my Dad  Being right runs in my family. Or else we like to think it does  My favourite computer game is Baldur's Gate. I've been playing it for 2.5 years  I love Roger la Borde stationery   urlLink  I hate cats  I'd like to go horseriding regularly  I love the movie Spy Game. I think I've seen it 20 times  I'd like to have a friend who is an amazing hairdresser  I'd also like a friend who has a holiday house in the Greek Islands and the South of France  I don't eat ham but I really like ham, vintage cheese and corn relish sandwiches on brown bread  I love cooking  I get scared quite easily -especially in movies  I also get really sweaty hands (see point 83)  I love Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday and Chris O'Donnell in Circle of Friends  In high school I had a crush on Stephen Dorff. His career pinnacle was 1994. I recently spied him in a Britney Spears video (like I said, his career pinnacle was 1994) looking exactly the same  My favourite holiday was in Languedoc in 2002  I hate it when embarrassing things happen on tv  I hate slap-stick comedy  I've never had a cavity  I had braces as an adult  Patriot Games and Sushi for Beginners are my favourite beach books  My favourite music includes Cafe del Mar, Radiohead, Bif Naked, St Germain and the Dandy Warhols  I am the worst swimmer in the world (&amp; therefore very unAustralian). I hate putting my head under the water  I love bubble baths  I love my pink Ikea blanket -it makes me so happy when we snuggle together  I would like to be more artistic  I wish my right eye didn't droop a little  I have a birthmark on my right wrist that I can make disappear if I pull my skin taut  I would like to be less of a procrastinator -look how long it took me to complete this!

      Things have actually been a little busy at work this week so I haven't had a chance to write. I guess I can't really complain because I absolutely hate it when it's really quiet at work. The only thing is that now I have all these things I want to get done and I have no time to do them because work is getting in the way. Imagine how hard life must be for people who have really busy jobs! How their lives must suffer!  I just finished the latest book from Marian Keyes -The Other Side of the Story. It's a pretty good book but nowhere near as good as  urlLink Sushi for Beginners . For some reason I really really enjoyed Sushi -maybe it was the excellent character development? Anyway for whatever reason I always enjoy Keyes' books but none are in the same league as Sushi in my opinion!  Next I have to complete my Guy Gavriel Kay book and Sarum. Too many books and not enough time. I honestly don't know what's going on but it seems that I don't do as much reading as I used to. I used to be one that could sit and read for hours on end. I was the sort of person who would read a book in a day. Now I'm the sort of person who takes 6 months to read one book and who gets kind of disinterested with the book that they are reading. Whatever is going on, I am not enjoying it!

      I'm now the very proud owner of a boy with an MBA! Today was DLP's graduation held in my very own alma mater  urlLink Sydney University !  We had a great day. He looked fantastic and I was bursting with pride. Afterwards we went for lunch at Watson's Bay to Sydney's world famous  urlLink Doyle's Restaurant . Tonight dinner at Sydney Rower's Club.  Pictures to come...

      Question of the Day: What would you wear for camouflage if you were hiding in a gingerbread house?  Now these are the types of questions that I like! I would probably wear vanilla icing covered with miniature mint patties and tiny pieces of twirl bar. Perhaps the odd piece of finger bun wouldn't go astray either! :-)  Also, my blog code is: B1 d- t- k s- u-- f i o+ x- e l c. Don't know what a  urlLink blog code  is? Me either ;-) but I guess I should have one!  I have just discovered  urlLink lomography  and am very intrigued and tempted. The internet is such a great place to waste time and find amazing things!  I heard today that Gwyneth Paltrow has named her baby girl  urlLink Apple . What sort of a name is that? Unfortunately, there are worse ones out there! How about Unique, Vanity or Espn?? Seriously. People have actually called their kids these names. I feel so sorry for these poor children! What did they do to deserve names like that?

      The difficulty I face every morning is whether the extra 10 minutes I can spend in bed is worth the additional 30-40 minutes that it takes me on Sydney's fabulous public transport to get to work. This morning the extra time in bed won however I for one can't understand why I do it when I then get to spend an hour and half stewing over every red traffic light and every small (and large) traffic jam and thinking to myself if I had left 20 minutes earlier I would have been there in half the time!  However, this morning hasn't been all bad. It's a gorgeous autumn day and DLP's father has arrived from Canada to visit. It's his first visit to Australia and I actually quite enjoy being a tour guide as long as my tour does not involve stops at the aquarium and zoo. I am so over those 2 places which is actually kind of sad because I think  urlLink Taronga Zoo  would have to be one of the most beautiful zoos in the world. I think I just got zoo'd and aquarium'd out last year when we had so many different overseas visitors staying with us!  I was right about German class. It was seriously scary however I think I am going to get through it ok. I feel quietly confident about my grammar I just need a lot of help with my listening and speaking. My god it's exhausting trying to folllow what the teacher is saying for 2.5 hours. I was definitely ready to fall asleep at the end of the class and I'm really not sure that I understood even half of what she was saying! Unfortunately, unless I concentrate 100% on what she is saying I have no chance at all of understanding anything!

      Day 2 of my bloglife!  Today is actually a bit of a nerve racking day because I start my first German class this evening and I'm honest enough to realise that I know next to nothing and yet am supposed to know quite a bit. I know that this whole experience is going to be humiliating however I must be a bit of a masochist because I'm actually kinda looking forward to it. I have to admit that I think I've always been a bit of a nerd because I've always looked forward to the first day of the new school year and it would appear that this is one thing that hasn't changed!  Mmm this blogger thing appears to be a little more difficult than first anticipated. How the hell do I insert a link to my favourite t-shirt folding video which I so wanted to share. I think I need some serious tech assistance!    Some questions to ponder and respond to:  1) If money were no object (yeah right, but try to suspend disbelief) where would you live?  If money were no object I would divide my time between a gorgeous villa in the south of France, a beach house in Vanuatu (I AM going there one day!) and a stunning converted warehouse in New York -one of those ones with deliciously high ceiling and lovely exposed brickwork and beams. Also I may also require a wonderful, typically English house in central London ;-)   2) If you had your choice of any job in the world - what would be your dream job?  My dream job would be to work in Foreign Affairs and Trade/diplomacy. I might also be inclined to a stint as a food and travel writer perhaps for Conde Nest or Gourmet Traveller magazine.  3) If you could have dinner with anyone - living or dead - who would it be?  Mmm this is a difficult question. In fact I hate these types of questions.  4) If you could take only 3 foods to a desert island what would they be?  Another difficult question. Maybe cheese, avocado, strawberries, cheesecake. Mmm that would be four. Might have to do some thinking on this one!

      My very first post at my new home on the web :-)  I'm actually quite excited about this because everyone these days seems to have a blog and now it's finally my turn. You see I don't count my brief stint on Xanga as a blog because Xanga actually kind of sucks -unless you're 15 and write in some kind of English that I, at the grand old age of 24, do not recognise.   What exactly am I meant to blog about now that I have this new found home on the net? I have a lot of time at work at the moment so I'm sure I will come up with something interesting.  Currently eating: Delicious sticky date pudding and butterscotch sauce a la Miss S.  Listening to: DLP's pearls of wisdom  Thinking about: Finally taking my digital photos to the photolab to get developed  This post leaves a little to be desired and is hopefully not a sign of things to come...

      A few weeks ago after a walk through the  urlLink Sydney Botanic Gardens  DLP and I stopped off for some lunch - urlLink Oporto's  for DLP and sushi for moi. At the sushi place I spied for the very first time these adorably cute little  urlLink puffed up stars . A few hours later one found it's way into my hand. DLP had gone back to the sushi place and actually bought one from the guy, just for me!  Today I found a site that explains how to do these  urlLink stars  as well as straw ones. I would love to try and make these although I have no idea what I could do with them other than put them in a glass jar. Any ideas anyone?

      I am having a particularly horrible day at work today. I have to admit that I much prefer the days when my boss is not here (and luckily for me that happens at least one day a week so I can't really complain all  that  much. It's just that today doesn't happen to be one of them). In addition, I think my day has kind of sucked so far because I forgot pretty much everything at home -my mobile phone, my watch and my cherry, coconut and chocolate muffins. It's just not a good day!  Anyway, being bored and feeling sorry for myself, I decided to do a bit of craft research on the net and have become totally inspired to make the  urlLink square bottomed lined bag  posted by Jordy on  urlLink craftster  with a little bit of an influence from  urlLink figandplum  because I adore the lime green and cherry colour combination! What do you think? Do you love it? I am thinking that I might like to whip a few of these up for gifts (as well as making one for myself of course). I don't actually have a sewing machine but that is a very minor detail. Quit raining on my parade with your negativity! ;-)  The other things I am determined to do this week are to go for a massage (I really really need one!) and to get together with Miss S to make some jams and also ( finally !) some  urlLink marble magnets .  Mmm it's only lunchtime -what exciting ideas am I going to come up with this afternoon...?

      Sunday already! Where has the weekend gone? I had a very relaxing day today -a bit of a sleep in, followed by some porridge (perfect winter brekky)and then a trip across to Manly. It was an absolutely gorgeous day and so it was great to be out and about.  Tonight we had lasagne for dinner -my first ever attempt at lasagne! I made use of the left over slowroasted tomatoes from yesterday and they were absolutely perfect in it. The only change for next time is to add less beef stock as it was a little more liquidy than I wanted.  For dessert we made one of DLP's favourite too-simple desserts -a strawberry parfait -layers of strawberry intermixed with cream, white sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest. This is one of those refreshing desserts that everyone always loves and has the added advantage of being super quick and easy to make as well as not leaving you feel like a blob when you have finished it!  Work tomorrow. Bleh!

      Yay! I am finally HTML literate enough to make some changes to my site and while I think it looks  so  much better than it did I get the feeling that it is going to be a continual work in progress and learning curve! Here's to plenty of glasses of wine and tantrums in the future while I try to make sense of HTML! It's a good thing that I enjoy a challenge.  Today I also finally got around to making the embarrassingly easy but oh-so-lovely wine charms that were inspired by the ones from  urlLink not martha . I decided to use 8mm resin beads and I am very happy with the result (although I have to admit that mine are nothing compared to the ones over at  urlLink ljc fyi ). I will try and take a decent photo and post it so you can see how lovely they are. I enjoyed the whole process of making the charms, including the angst of choosing the right colours and type of bead, so much that I am motivated to actually try my hand at some bead jewellery next week.

      Yum yum I am a huge fan of avocado salsa at the moment. I absolutely adore avocado on sandwiches and in salads but this recipe (from  urlLink Donna Hay ) has quickly become a favourite and I love having it for my lunch at work. It's also incredibly simple and very versatile.   2 diced ripe avocados 1/2 diced red onion 1 seeded and shredded chilli  For dressing combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon or lime juice, sea salt and cracked pepper. Pour dressing over avocado salsa and stir carefully to combine.  At the moment I am enjoying it with fresh white bread and baby spinach and green bean salad but it is also great as a side to grilled fish or chicken. Very simple but oh so tasty!

      I've just spent the last hour redesigning my blog. Voila! Here it is. That's right, it looks exactly the same as an hour ago. What a waste of time. I think I need to sit down and think about how I want this page to look and then start working out how I am going to achieve that. At the moment I am merely making messes and then having to clean up after myself which isn't really all that much fun.  My only news for this week is that I have a Gmail account. I actually really really wanted one because I hoped that i would be able to get pipstar@gmail.com since Gmail is still in testing stages and hasn't been released to the general public. Well, that's what they're saying anyway. What I want to know is why pipstar is already gone...and the half a dozen other email addresses that I tried! Goddamit I really wanted pipstar. I wanted pipstar so badly I almost cried when my plan was foiled! Who is this pipstar imposter who has stolen my address and who will probably sell it on eBay for scads of cash?   Actually while I'm ranting... what is it with all the hype over the  Super Size Me  documentary? (I'm not even going to dignify it with a link) I mean bad eating habits are definitely worth educating people about but I don't think that pinpointing McDonalds and taking an eating pattern to extreme is the right way to do it. And anyway, did Spurlock actually tell us anything we didn't already know? I think he misses the point that McDonalds like any food can be part of a balanced diet as long as you exercise self control. He would have done a much better documentary (albeit with none of the propaganda) if he had looked at the facts instead of trying to create a sensational show.  I also cannot believe that Morgan Spurlock actually believes that McDonald's has responded to his documentary by getting rid of supersizing and introducing a healthier range of foods. I mean McDonald's in Australia has already had a health menu including salads and foccacia and yogurts etc for the last few years and they never supersize. Congratulations to Maccas Australia for pointing that out with signs in all their restaurants. It's just too bad that people get so caught up in all the hype that they forget the basic facts.  Here ends my rant.

      Had a lovely long weekend in Melbourne including but not limited to:  -a tour of the  urlLink Great Ocean Road  -one of the world's most scenic roads. The Twelve Apostles was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been -even with the gale force winds! -Melbourne Demons beating Essendon Bombers at the  urlLink MCG  in front of 47,314 people. And it didn't even rain that much! -delicious mouthwatering desserts at the continental cake shops on St Kilda's Acland Street -a few relaxing hours in the  urlLink National Gallery of Victoria  -a lovely wonderful "must-have" trenchcoat from cue -no, i didn't have to fly to Melbourne to buy it since we have cue in Sydney but my jacket is so much nicer since I bought it whilst holidaying in Melbourne! -dinner in Little Italy -Lygon Street, Carlton -too many restaurants to choose from is a problem I wish I had more often! (Also the place we ended up choosing served the most delicious garlic bread I have ever had!)  The week ahead is very unexciting in comparison. This week I really should get started on a couple of tasks that I have been neglecting recently. DLP's scarf is never going to be finished -even in time for next winter -if my needles don't get knitting! I also want to try a few recipes from my Donna Hay books and also my Australian Women's Weekly Casserole book. Some jamming and some serious reading might also be in order whilst DLP and I also have to get along and see Harry Potter before it disappears from screens. So much to do...so little time!

      I've had a bad week this week -not a result of anything in particular but just more of a "there's so many things wrong with the world...my life..." kind of week. It's kind of strange that this happened to me this week because usually I'm not the sort of person who gets down about things for longer than it takes for me to throw a tantrum. It got to the point yesterday though where I almost burst into tears because somebody wanted to use my photocopier. As you do. Ok well it wasn't so much that she wanted to use it, more the way that she went about using it. Anyway I decided to do everyone a favour and take myself home from work after lunch.  Today I am feeling much better. This must be because DLP sent me to bed early last night -I guess, on reflection, he was really the only person who lost out with my decision to go home early yesterday!

      Finally the weekend. At one point I thought this pain-hazed death march of a week would never end!  I don't even have a very exciting weekend lined up although I think part of my excitement at least is because it's a long weekend -the Queen's birthday or something? I love getting paid for sitting at home relaxing!  Tonight I am off to Cafe Sydney for a night of jazz and cocktails and princesses and tomorrow Miss S and I are having yet another domestic goddess bliss day!

      I've been doing quite a bit of reading this past week which is great because as I mentioned a little while ago I've really begun to notice that I haven't been at all interested in reading over the last few months. Last weekend at home alone though was the perfect time to do something about that!  In fact, pretty much all of Sunday was spent reading. I actually spent the entire day sitting on my bed and reading Dan Brown's  urlLink Da Vinci Code  which was given to me for my birthday in January (yes it has taken me this long to get around to reading it!). It was actually quite good and was of particular interest to me because I have read a bit about some of the ideas that are woven into Brown's story. I would recommend the Da Vinci Code as a good novel to pick up on a wet day or for the bus to work however it really isn't even remotely in the same league as Eco's  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum  (this seems to be  the  book to compare it to) which is a truly amazing weaving of so many different subjects including the occult, Freemasonry, the Rosicrucians, mathematics and history just to name a few. Foucault's Pendulum is one of the most impressive books that I have ever read and is an excellent insight into the genius that is Umberto Eco (as you can tell I am a big fan of his work in general although Foucault's Pendulum is undoubtedly my favourite).  Anyway the Da Vinci Code lacked character development but I am not sure that intense characterisation was actually needed. It seemed to me that the book was just very good for what is was -a fictional mystery, that was sometimes also quite intriguing.  Sunday was actually spent finishing the Da Vinci code but so far this week I have already read Susan Vreeland's  urlLink The Passion of Artemisia  which was also very enjoyable although not as good as the books of Philippa Gregory or Tracy Chevalier. At the moment I am reading the fifth Harry Potter -The Order of the Phoenix -again! at home but as it is too big to lug to work every day I have picked up Gabriel Garcia Marquez's  urlLink One Hundred Years of Solitude  for the ride to and from work. So far (8 pages) so good. I'm expecting it to be really good though because I have really enjoyed his other books.

      I made what can only be described as  the  most delicious casserole of all time on Saturday night. Admittedly, my approval of this casserole might have been influenced by my extreme hunger, the feeling of tremendous happiness caused by the first use of my brand new gorgeous red casserole pot as well as the quite cold weather, however when all is said and done it was a truly enjoyable and very very tasty casserole. I am really looking forward to my future forays into casserole cooking...hopefully next time I will even have someone to share my casserole with!  The weekend was lovely but I must admit that I wish DLP would come home soon. I am feeling like a very pathetic, dependent girl in saying this but by 9pm last night I was a little on the lonely side and could have enjoyed a cuddle or two. Anyway he will be home again tomorrow night and maybe I can whip up one of my casseroles for him -that's a sure way of preventing him from going away again!  Friday night was girls' wine and dessert night. It was a lovely night but nowhere near enough wine or dessert were consumed! I made  urlLink Clotilde's  raspberry and yogurt cake and while it didn't cook quite through in the middle it was absolutely delicious. The tart taste of the raspberries is the perfect companion to the mild almond sweetness. And of course it has a wonderful slightly heavy consistency. Anyway it was ideal with the seriously sweet chocolate fondue that we also had. Yum!  Actually the chocolate fondue has provided me with the most amazing hot chocolate that I have ever had. The fondue was made with melted chocolate, cream and marshmallow and I have been using the leftovers to enjoy a very french breakfast -a big bowl of hot chocolate. It is also oh so simple -drop a dollop of leftover fondue in the bottom of a bowl, fill with milk and then into the microwave! Absolutely delicious!  On Saturday, Miss S and I did some serious kitchen shopping. I picked up a few things that I have been needing for a while including a lasagne dish, a quiche tray and a pie dish -perfect for lots of winter cooking! We also bought a few jam jars in preparation for a big day of jamming this weekend. Speaking of this weekend, it's a long one. Yay!

      The night before last was unhappily spent being a plumber's assistant! Isn't it funny how things always seem to happen all at once?? When we first contacted the plumber we only had one thing to be fixed...by the time he arrived we had three -a split tap washer, a leaking dishwasher and a serious case of damage caused by a non-waterproofed shower. Ah the joys of renting. The result was that the plumber spent 2 hours on Wednesday evening fixing things at our place and I spent 2 hours helping him. I think it really did help me realise though that I'm not really cut out to be a plumber's assistant. Everything is just too dirty and wet.   I actually managed to get to work on time this morning only to discover that my boss isn't even here today to appreciate my punctuality! I also drove today but only managed to get a 1 hour parking spot which means a continual game of musical cars for me today. Not happy. Ah well at least it should waste 10 minutes every hour.

      I don't think I mentioned this but I have changed my German class. I enjoyed the first one but found that it's main focus wasn't really on what I most wanted to improve -my conversation skills. As such, I changed classes to the Structure and Conversation class at the  urlLink Goethe Institut  here in Sydney. Unfortunately, last week the class was cancelled because the teacher was sick so last night was my first class -and it was fantastic. It's exactly what I wanted and I'm beginning to feel more fluent already. There is a really good mix of people -some have lived in Germany and others studied German at school and Uni. I'm probably just happy because I am not the worst in the class! This week my homework is to write a poem about Autumn and I'm actually looking forward to sitting down and doing it sometime this week.   Today DLP and his father are off to Cairns for a week so I have the house to myself. Again, I am really looking forward to spending some quality me time and also catching up on and organising all my eBay items. And of course doing a bit of house cleaning and some extensive cooking! It's lovely to have the house to myself and now that it is officially winter (Day 2 at that!) I'm really looking forward to spending days reading and watching movies, lighting fragrant candles and enjoying soups and casseroles and my current favourite breakfast of ricotta cheese and honey on rye toast -yum yum!

      Just did my tax return (Yes, Australia's financial year runs July to June) and I am smiling all the way to the bank. Now I know the responsible thing would be to spend the $2000 refund to pay off my debts but that is just so boring. What can I do with it instead???  Too much money? This is a problem I would like to have more often! :-)

      Last night we went for tasty Italian with my uni friend, Tak, in Surrey Hills. I had a delicious chili vongole spaghetti, bruschetta and some crunchy bread which I proceeded to dip into the sauce of DLP's penne arrabiata. Yum yum!   Afterwards I felt a little bit sleepy but went along to a Sydney University Drama Society production of Richard III. It was fantastic. I have to admit that I was totally ignorant of the plot of this play. I've&nbsp;read quite a lot of Shakespeare as a result of my high school English classes but had never come across Richard III. I found out about 10 minutes before it started that it was his longest play so I was a little anxious about how I was going to survive the evening with my eyes open. Luckily it was very very well done and I was  really  pleasantly surprised. Not my favourite Shakespeare (I will leave that honour to Measure for Measure) but it was really entertaining and&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of the acting was really great!   Btw I love buying and selling on eBay but man some people are painful! Grrr!

      Do you have some cooking secrets that you like to keep...uh... secret?? Sometimes when I feel like spoiling DLP I whip up my world famous (alright, apartment famous) italian chicken casserole. It works like a charm every time and sometimes I suspect that he's with me purely for the casserole and my wicked chocolate mousse. It's only a suspicion mind you.   The other night DLP put in a special request for italian chicken casserole. We made a trip to our local Coles where I proceeded to hum and haw about the ingredients I would need in an attempt to bore&nbsp;DLP and lose&nbsp;him &nbsp;in the lolly aisle. Unfortunately, my plan was foiled and when I could no longer pretend to think of ingredients other than tomatoes and chicken and onion I had to admit that I was a fake.   I am indeed a user of Masterfoods' Italian Chicken Casserole. The shock! The horror! I hang my head in shame.    urlLink     I also can't bear to admit that his favourite chocolate, cherry and coconut muffins also come out of a box. I think I preferred it when there was a little bit of mystery in our relationship.

      I am fine after my confrontation with the metal fence. My face is a little cut and I have a bit of a black eye but I think it just adds character. Actually I think I am just grateful I still own all my teeth! I also had the mother of all headaches for 2 days straight and was even more partial to sleeping than usual (I found that hard to believe too!) but now everything seems back to normal.  I also finally read the wonderful  urlLink Tea House on Mulberry Street  (Apologies, that was the only link I could find with an admittedly terrible picture of my edition that really doesn't do it justice. Unfortunately, the cover of the  urlLink UK edition  is not even in the same league)**. It's a fabulous little book and I was inexplicably happy when I finished it. Basically, it follows the lives of the owners and regular customers of a little tea house in Belfast and you jump around from person to person as you progress through the chapters with regular interaction with other characters. Each of the characters is going through a transition and they are all very likeable. The ending is really sweet. I wish I could read it again for the first time. I definitely recommend this book for a rainy day or for a day when you need a bit of a pickup. Plus it also comes with a very interesting sounding cherry cheesecake recipe at the back. What more could you ask for in a book?  ** I should probably explain here that one of my favourite past times is gloating over book covers that are so much nicer in Australia than the ones available in the States or UK. On the other hand, I have been known to drool over overseas editions that I wish I owned. Covers are  so  important and it's so interesting to see how publishers choose to market things differently in various countries.

      This morning at the bus stop I fainted and smashed my face on a metal fence. I am bruised and cut. I am beautiful.  On the upside, I didn't have to go to work. On the downside, I still had to go to the dentist.

      This is a deliciously scrumptious recipe for sticky date pudding -a hugely popular dessert in Australia. It's great to bake as little individual muffins or a large cake and it  must  be served with warm butterscotch sauce. Every mouthful is a soft, warm, moist delight.    Ingredients   1 cup dates (180g) -- pitted and chopped  1 tsp bicarbonate of soda  1 cup boiling water  2 tbsp butter  1 cup soft brown sugar  2 eggs  1 1/2 cup self-raising flour-sifted   Butterscotch sauce:  3/4 cup brown sugar  1&nbsp;cup&nbsp;(pouring) cream  1 tsp vanilla essence  20g unsalted butter   Mix dates and baking soda in a heat-proof bowl. Pour boiling water over and leave to stand. Cream butter and sugar, then add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gently fold in sifted flour using a metal spoon. Stir in the date mixture, and pour into a lightly buttered 18cm or 7" square or round cake tin (also suitable for 12 individual muffins).   Bake in a preheated oven (180 C) for 30-40 minutes, until an inserted skewer comes out clean.   Combine&nbsp;butterscotch sauce ingredients&nbsp;in a saucepan, bring to the boil, stirring, and simmer for five minutes. Set aside until ready to serve, then quickly reheat when needed.&nbsp;Pour hot&nbsp;butterscotch sauce over each piece of pudding and enjoy!     urlLink

      Dearest oven, you have no idea how happy it makes me that you have decided to rejoin our small, but very cosy, household. Yesterday was a dream come true when you, Miss S and I created (simultaneously)  urlLink sticky date pudding , roast lamb with baby squash, potatoes, carrots, brussel sprouts&nbsp;and beans, and  urlLink compote rose .   urlLink      Wasn't it fun? Didn't it feel so wonderful to be so productive? Wasn't it so satisfying to partake in this delicious feast? Wasn't breakfast this morning sensational with the compote rose and natural yoghurt? Aren't you so glad to be back?

       Yay yay it's the weekend again. This week has flown by! Tonight I am looking forward to a fabulous girls' pyjama cocktail party that might also involve delicious pieces of hot cheese-slathered pizza. Of course I am taking my  urlLink hot pink Ikea blanket  (everybody needs one of these) and I would be taking a pair of ugg boots if I owned any. Aren't the  urlLink chocolate ones &nbsp;cute tho??! I might have to add those to my wish list  before  winter is over!   urlLink    urlLink     I am also looking forward to doing some serious cooking with the lovely  urlLink Miss S  tomorrow. Yes, our oven has been fixed as of about 30 minutes ago. I am so excited! Miss S and I spent a little bit of time making some marble magnets last night and I feel pretty certain that we will also be able to fit some more of that into our tight cooking schedule tomorrow. So many things to cook. So many weeks of not being able to bake to make up for!   This is all assuming that we aren't car wrecks tomorrow! I am usually a little too partial to daquiris and pina coladas for my own good.

      Isn't it funny how sometimes the simplest things make people happy?     urlLink    &nbsp;I love tulips. One day (when I am the sort of person who enjoys the feeling of dirt under their fingernails) I hope to have a lovely garden filled with tulips of every imaginable colour. I also hope that they don't die within a week of being planted. Now  that  would make me happy...

      Apologies for my tardiness over the last few days but I do have some very good excuses! :-)  &nbsp;  The weekend was lovely. Totally horrible weather -gale force winds and rain but oh so fun! Friday night I had the house to myself as DLP was off on a boys' night and I had a lovely night watching reality tv (yes I admit it). Saturday was&nbsp;actually spent lying around reading books, staying cosy, reading the paper and swearing over the saturday crossword -it's the bane of my existence but I love it dearly.  &nbsp;  On Saturday night we went out with some friends of mine from high school, most of whom I haven't seen since high school. I actually had a lovely time and it was really great to spend time with some new/rediscovered people and to catch up with my good friend Chloe. Chloe is one of my closest friends. We were joined at the hip for the last 2 years of high school despite the fact that we didn't have any friends in common. Since then we have seen each other every few months. It's kind of sad that we don't make the effort to spend more time together and yet at the same time I really really value the fact that no matter what happens I know I can count on her to be there for me and&nbsp;I&nbsp;know that when I next&nbsp;see her nothing will have changed. I'm beginning to realise&nbsp;&nbsp;as I get older that it's not that common to have a friend like that. It was good to catch up with her on Saturday night and spend some time with her friends.  &nbsp;  On Sunday DLP and I&nbsp;had&nbsp;massages. I love the feeling of waking up on a Sunday morning all sleepy, slipping on some comfy clothes, hopping in the car and going for a super relaxing 1 hour massage. I feel so fantastic when I come out afterwards and I really really needed it on Sunday -I must have been carrying around a bit of stress!  &nbsp;  Sunday&nbsp;afternoon I hopped on the plane to  urlLink Canberra . Internationally, I don't think that people realise that Canberra is in fact the capital of Australia, rather than Sydney or Melbourne.      The rest of Australia likes to make fun of Canberra cos it's kind of different. Actually it's very different. It's only about 3 hours south west of Sydney but it feels like a world apart. It's a planned city with a man-made lake and super wide streets and 60s buildings. It's ugly.&nbsp;It's also a commonly held belief that Canberra is a hole. DLP and I, however, &nbsp;are actually considering moving there next year. I was in Canberra doing some work for a potential job which I would give my right foot to get. While I think that everything went quite well over the last 2 days I am not going to count my chickens before they hatch....which is why I am back at the worst job in the world today.  &nbsp;  Hopefully though I will hear something in the next few weeks which will enable me to kick my current job to the wind, travel for a month or so and then start a brand new, challenging, dynamic, amazingly rewarding job. But I don't want to jinx myself...&nbsp; :-)  &nbsp;  Tonight I am subjecting myself to a game of  urlLink squash  with one of the girls&nbsp;from work and then I am looking forward to a relaxing evening with DLP who is a bit of a sick boy at the moment. Looks like I might need to be a caring girlfriend for the next few days. It's nice to be home.

      Today Clotilde over at  urlLink chocolateandzucchini  has posted a delicious looking  urlLink apricot cake  which I would love to make this weekend. I probably would have too if our oven was getting fixed today as promised instead of next Tuesday. Now I wish we had fixed the damn thing ourselves...  I can't be too glum though because it is Friday. I love the feeling of Friday. Friday is a good day because part of Friday (ie after about 5pm) is really part of the weekend and there are a lot of great things about that! Notably the fact that I can sleep in! I like sleeping a lot. DLP always like to demonstrate to people how much I enjoy sleeping by telling them that once during a blackout I went to sleeep at 7pm. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. You really don't realise how integral electricity is to our lives until it's gone. No tv, no radio, no computer, no light to read or knit by. Anyway I like sleeping. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning I like to think about going to bed again that night. Sleep is good and very underrated.  Last night I went to get a haircut and some highlights. So now I don't look like  urlLink this  anymore. The change isn't really that dramatic -it's just a bit blonder! I'm very happy with it but the whole experience was overshadowed by the feeling I had when I was getting my hair washed. I love getting my hair washed and my head massaged. Sometimes I imagine a world where it is normal to go to someone to wash your hair and massage your head. No cut or blowdry necessary thank you very much! Yes, that's right, just a lovely head rub. It's all I need.  Bon Voyage to my friend  urlLink Ros . She is off today to have a fabulous time in Europe!

      There has been a distinct lack of baking or decent meals in our house over the last 2 weeks. This time it isn't explained by my inept laziness but instead by the fact that the elements in our oven have blown/died/retired/run away. It would appear that our landlord hasn't seen fit to fix the problem so we are now approaching our 3rd weekend of being ovenless. It's making me cranky. I like using my oven. I like making lasagne and baking choc chip cookies (slightly undercooked for that delicious taste and texture!) and  urlLink sticky date puddings . There really isn't a worse feeling than flipping through a recipe book, finding something that you simply  must  make that day, realising with excitement that all required ingredients already exist in your kitchen and then remembering that your oven is kaputt.  How am I meant to make this delicious looking  urlLink rhubarb sponge pudding  from Jill Dupleix? I know it's the wrong season for fresh rhubarb but I am allowed to be irrational since my oven is not working!  urlLink     Plus, today I made the oh so foolish mistake of driving to work and only got a 1 hour parking spot...and there are parking inspectors about. I hate playing musical cars every hour!

      this cute little skirt from  urlLink American Eagle   urlLink     Too bad they don't ship to Australia :-( Of course, I make myself feel better by reminding myself that I wouldn't have the opportunity to wear it for at least another 3 months anyway.  Also this lovely green top from  urlLink anthropologie .   urlLink     It's probably lucky for my wallet they don't ship here either.  And while we're talking about things I want:   Doesn't everyone need Hungry Hippos? Anyone want to play?

        This is a great little cookbook!   urlLink Jamie Oliver 's Pukkolla is a great way to start the day. I like to fill a 250ml container with the cereal and some chopped up fresh strawberries to take to work. When I get to work I just add some milk and voila a delicious, super healthy breakfast. Of course, the cereal actually tastes even better on the weekends when I can grate some apple and add the milk the night before.  8 large handfuls organic Scottish porridge oats  2 large handfuls ground bran  1 large handfuls chopped dried apricots/sultanas/apples/figs  1 handful chopped dried dates 1 handful crumbled walnuts  1 handful smashed or chopped almonds, hazelnuts or Brazil nuts  Add porridge oats and bran to a large plastic container with the dried fruit. Crumble in walnuts and add chosen nuts. This will keep for a good couple of months very happily in an airtight container.  Jamie also recommends that you make this the night before, cover with milk and add half a grated apple per person. Mix it all up so the apple doesn't brown and then pop it in the fridge. It's absolutely delicious and fills you up for the whole morning!  Btw my back feels like a herd of elephants trampled over it during the night. This doesn't bode well for my desire to play squash in the future!

      This weekend has gone incredibly fast and I'm a little sad at the thought of going into work tomorrow. :-( I have however defied the miserable weather and had a really, really good weekend. If you exclude the mini tantrum I threw yesterday. It was justified. Really. I won't bore you with the deficiencies of the New South Wales driving licence regulators though. Let's just say that they suck.  Yesterday because I was feeling sorry for myself I picked up  urlLink Elegance . It is good. I really do recommend it. It's not amazing writing or anything but it is a nice little story and an easy read -very enjoyable for a rainy afternoon when you're feeling sorry for yourself. It might even be a little inspiring.  Last night DLP and I went for some Indian and made ourselves sick on butter chicken, chicken tikka massala and the  best  naan bread in the world. I couldn't even have a mango lassi I was so full. I did however manage to fit in a hot chocolate and new york baked cheesecake from Starbucks. And can I please tell you (and please refrain from rolling your eyes) that the cheesecake was the best cheesecake I have had in a long time. You see, whilst I adore cheesecake I am not a big fan of the biscuit base that is so common on cheesecakes. The one last night however had a light chocolate cake base and I was in heaven.   Today Ros and I went for a swim at North Sydney Pool. It has been a seriously long time since I have been swimming. In a pool with lanes. I spent most of my time in the spa and sauna. I probably spent more time in the shower afterwards than I actually did in the pool.  Afterwards we rewarded ourselves with breakfast in Lavendar Bay (isn't that a lovely sounding place name?) and I missed out on a parking ticket by about 1 minute. It was a great feeling to drive away and leave the parking warden in my dust. Oh yeah!  This afternoon DLP and I went and played squash for an hour. I never before realised that it was possible to feel sore while you were still undertaking physical activity. Usually the muscle pain sets in about 1 day later. Not today. My bum and right wrist are  really  sore. It was obviously too much exercise in one day.

      I've been tearing through a new book series over the last week. A few weeks ago DLP and I were browsing through  urlLink Galaxy Bookshop , which is a really great little fantasy/science fiction bookstore in the CBD, and I spied an interesting book that I ended up buying. I finally got the chance to start reading Dragonclaw by Kate Forsyth last week. 4 days and about 500 pages later it was done and I raced back to Galaxy after work to pick up the second and third. The second one has already been devoured and I am pacing myself with the third. I really do recommend this series if you see them around!  Last week I also picked up 2 books while shopping in Newtown with Ros -these book purchases were pretty much based on their front covers, something that I don't tend to do. I think though that  urlLink Tea House on Mulberry Street  by Sharon Owens and  urlLink Elegance  by Kathleen Tessaro both have potential for a cold winter's Sunday afternoon!     Don't you love that cover? Could  you  resist it? It makes me feel elegant just looking at it! And to be honest the Tea House on Mulberry Street cover is even more divine.

      I am officially a Scrabble fiend! Last week, whilst at work, I decided that I couldn't survive much longer without my very own game of scrabble. A quick trip to Target on Friday and my destiny was complete. Unfortunately, my relationship with said new scrabble has so far been a little chequered. A lowlight would have been when I had 7 vowels in my hand. Or perhaps when DLP whipped my sorry ass 2 games in a row (I think "whipped" is suitable when referring to a 100 point deficit!). Or even when my turn gave me a mere 3 points. That wasn't even at the last stage of the game when the tiles had run out.  On the upside (sorry Ros), I did manage to beat Ros last night. She may have helped me a little bit but it was a blindingly obvious 35 pointer that I just needed a little encouragement with. I am hoping that this victory is an indication of the fruitful relationship my scrabble game and I will enjoy in the future.  Winter is the perfect time for playing board games don't you think? I'm a big fan of Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit and DLP and I love a game of Settlers of Catan -it would be fantastic to find a couple of other boardgame lovers as I would love to organise a weekly boardgame/food/wine evening.

      I would love to make this  urlLink 1930's underwear  from the latest edition of Knitty. Unfortunately, I just don’t think I am past the scarf knitting stage. In fact, if I was really honest with myself I would admit that I have never quite finished a project. But I have experience in starting many projects.   Actually though, if the scarf I am “currently” making for DLP I was actually making for myself I would have finished it because you see DLP is a lot taller than me and hence his scarf needs to be a lot longer... and then I wouldn't have had the opportunity to get quite so bored with it. Well, actually I’m not sure I would have finished the scarf if it was for me because I actually have never tried casting off.   So as you can see I am really not in a position to make anything that would even be included in Knitty magazine. Humph!

      I have a larger than strictly necessary cookbook collection. I guess you could say that I am a bit of a sucker for lovely pictures and scrumptious sounding recipes. I also have the ability to not feel guilty about any kitchen purchases including cookbooks that I make. I think this comes from the fact that I adore food and have a very healthy relationship with it. I have never dieted and am blessed with a natural inclination towards healthy foods but also enjoy the odd dessert. Ultimately, I love mixing fresh flavours. I also really enjoy spending time in the kitchen and also enticing DLP with foods that he has never experienced before.  I've been spending more time than usual in the kitchen recently. In fact, usually at least one day on the weekend has been spent trying new recipes or creating meals that I can freeze and use the following week. There is nothing more appealing to me than a warm, sunny Sunday afternoon spent in the kitchen, working with fresh ingredients and listening to music (currently I enjoy this  urlLink Chillout Annual  from 2002). I love opening my fridge and finding something hidden at the back that I have forgotten about and which totally inspires and excites me.  At the moment, I have mainly been using  a great casserole book from the Australian Women's Weekly which is filled with soups and casseroles and other one pot meals that are all delicious. I also like the magazine and cookbooks of  urlLink Donna Hay  who I've mentioned before. Hay is an Australian chef who used to work for Marie Claire and has now started her own range of cookbooks. I am a huge fan of  urlLink Modern Classics 1  and  urlLink Modern Classics 2 .        She has quite a few other recipe books but these are my favourites. They are both great books that are filled with modern adaptations of classic recipes. Book 2 is filled with every dessert imaginable with really great instructions and photos whilst Book 1 covers soups, salads, veggies, pasta, roasts etc etc which are all fabulous.  It's so easy to find a delicious recipe to make when I pick these books up off the shelf. My biggest problem is that my other recipe books are currently suffering from neglect :-)

      Monday is the bane of my existence! I think I was a little bit spoilt last week with my 4 days off in a row so today it was a  really  nasty shock to be back at work. Ugh and Mondays are hard enough at the best of times!  Today we had a farewell lunch for a girl at work who is leaving -just her luck! It was great to go out for lunch and enjoy some more of the unseasonably nice Sydney July weather -plus I'm always partial to a turkey, brie and cranberry sandwich on super crunchy bread followed by a delicious berry cheesecake. Unsurprisingly it has been the highlight of my day!  I think a night of relaxing is in order. Thankfully I don't have to cook dinner as I was a kitchen whirlwind last night and whipped up chicken satay for tonight. I also made a chicken and corn soup which is going to make a great lunch tomorrow.

      So today DLP and I caught the train to  urlLink Luna Park  (btw the website sucks -ah well). Luna Park is a bit of a Sydney icon -it's located right on Sydney Harbour just under the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House so I guess you could say that the land it is on is worth a bit of money! It's been there off and on since 1935 but was closed down in 1979 because of a fire in one of the rides where some people died. Anyway, they attempted to reopen it in the mid 90s but the residents in the area complained. I guess if I owned a  urlLink $3.8 million apartment  I probably wouldn't want screaming kids on rollercoasters off my balcony either :-) The park closed down again only to reopen a few months ago sans massive rollercoaster.     Today was my first trip to Luna Park in probably 20 years and it was great! It was another beautiful day and the park wasn't too busy because school holidays haven't started yet. We went on the dodgem cars (twice cos they are my favourite) and also went on a couple of others including the gravitron which I admit i wasn't a big fan of. Actually, it made me cry. I really didn't like it.  Amusement parks are obviously too much excitement for us because we were exhausted by the time we got home. Tonight we're having spagetti bolognese for dinner and raspberry fool for dessert and we're going to watch The Godfather which I have never seen before (yes, I know I'm like the last person in the world!)  A great day overall (well, apart from the nauseous feeling on the gravitron. Nausea makes me cry, hence the crying -and the fact that I didn't really like having my face smushed up against the wall probably assisted the crying a little bit!).

      I'm having dinner with Ros tonight at  urlLink Thai Pothong  -my favourite Thai restaurant in the world (and that's saying a lot because I have been to many Thai restaurants and Sydney has some excellent ones!). Thai Pothong is on King St, Newtown and so I think we will be doing a little window shopping as well. I might even be able to swing by my bead shop to get some earring supplies! I love going to King Street -it has so many restaurants and funky shops -great for clothing and gifts.  Oh, yes, I admit it, I was "sick" today so couldn't go to work. No point having 60 sick days a year and not using them ;-) Plus today was a  really  nice day so DLP and I went for a bike ride around the bay near where we live (about 50m away actually) and read our books in the park. Can't complain about 23 degrees in the middle of winter!

      Yesterday was a dark day indeed. I found out that the tax office has different ideas about the $2300 tax refund that I was all ready to spend. No new clothing. No lovely holiday in Vanuatu. No deposit on a car. Not even the opportunity to pretend that I had managed to save some money over the last 12 months.   Instead, I get to pay $2300 off my university debt.  Vanuatu's probably horrible at this time of year anyway. Yeah. Right.

      Unfortunately, whilst I would like to fill you in on the details of my lovely weekend my brain seems to have stopped functioning (my job doesn't require a functioning brain so unfortunately I won't be getting fired today). All I can tell you is that I had a nice, quiet weekend. The boy and I watched a few movies, had some lovely sleep-ins and even went for a nice massage on Sunday.  Yesterday of his own volition the boy added mayonnaise to his sandwich. Will wonders ever cease?? (And yes, to those of you who are wondering, DLP can be a little particular when it comes to food which is why this new food adventuring is blogworthy!!)  In other news, my friend Jenni is back from Japan where she has been teaching for the past 12 months. She is home for a whirlwind 2 weeks and I'm really looking forward to catching up with her and hearing all her great stories. I've never been to Japan but it is definitely high on the list of places the boy and I want to go.

       urlLink     Congratulations to  urlLink Jessica and Casey  who just got engaged! So very exciting (and somewhat surreal since I've never met Jess, yet she is a lovely internet friend!). I hope the 2 of them are very happy!

       urlLink    Oh I love this  urlLink game  that  urlLink Kitschenette  bought for her little boy. It has such a lovely little tin and the pictures are beautiful.  [Aside] Why is it that the Germans do kitchen utensils and kids toys so well?

      The boy and I are celebrating our anniversary next week. 6 years. You would think that after 6 years there would be litte room for surprises but over the last week DLP has blown me away with 2 completely out of character episodes.  Firstly, there was the suggestion on Tuesday night that we should have sushi for dinner. Sushi?? This is from the boy who thinks seaweed is disgusting, and seafood is the food of the devil. This is the same boy who wrinkles up his nose and complains at the sight of me eating a sushi roll. What is this craziness!  If that isn't enough, yesterday afternoon he actually sneaked a piece of my favourite Starbucks New York style baked cheesecake right from under my nose. He hates cream cheese. He hates cheesecake. We proceeded to share aforementioned cheesecake (this is a one-off occurrence however because I am not a cheesecake-sharing kind of girl!) and I was in heaven. Don't things taste so much nicer when you can share them with your loved one??  I hope this doesn't mean that he's going to expect me to eat Reese's peanut butter cups with him in the future. Blergh!

      Last night was spent at the hospital where DLP had his lovely legs MRId. He's had quite a few problems with his good knee over the last few months but it's taken us a really long time to actually make appointments to try and discover what is going on. I think the delay has been because we both hoped that the problems would go away. I'm glad though that he's finally gone to get it done. Now we're in a position to actually go and see an orthopaedic surgeon and then we can deal with whatever we learn. We should know more by next week. At the moment though we like entertaining ourselves with guessing exactly what all the numerous little x-ray pictures depict. Is that a screw or a piece of kneebone??  Afterwards we went for Indian in Newtown. We both ate too much but it was lovely sitting inside the toasty warm restaurant, escaping from the cold, and filling our tummies with too much butter chicken and naan bread, washed down by thick, chilled mango lassis. Afterwards, contrary to our original plan of going to Starbucks for some hot chocolate we headed home and were in bed, reading, by 10pm. I'm currently enjoying Dan Brown's  urlLink Angels and Demons  (a real page turner) whilst the boy is reading Brown's  urlLink Da Vinci Code . We must look so cute sitting in bed reading matching books!  I'm going to try and pick up Brown's other 2 books this week so we can continue the Dan Brown reading marathon. The boy and I are definitely both hooked on his books. They're fast-paced, riveting novels that are based on really intriguing topics, that have previously had limited public exposure. I think it's particularly interesting for DLP because in his novels Brown incorporates many of the books that the boy has read numerous times over the last 15 years. In fact, some of these works actually inspired our trip to the south of France in 2002. Hopefully, Brown's other 2 novels are as good as the 2 we have already read.
