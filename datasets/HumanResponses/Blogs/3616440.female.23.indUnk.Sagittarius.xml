      Well yesterday was a slow day, I didn't really do anything excercise wise (unless you want to count walking around malls and trying on clothes). My landlord was supposed to come by and do some stuff with my apartment and I didn't want to start anything and then stop in the middle. He never did come by :p He had to do some other work on the apartment instead I guess. And Mom came by too around lunch and she's staying until tomorrow. This morning I went for a 27 min walk with Mom this morning. I walked a little bit slower than usual just so mom could keep up :) I got her to work up a sweat :) and showed her a bit around town. Anyhow now it is time for breakfast. I will be back later.

      Well, I have my up days, and my down days. Yesterday was a down day. I woke up way to friggin early and didn't totally have the energy to do anything in the morning. If I had I would have been completely wiped out again like I was earlier this week. Today's more of an up day. I woke up from a deep sleep, feeling kinda groggy and I didn't do anything right away. Eventually though I got up and walked to do my voting, then about 10:38 I started some serious walking :) I walked down to the beach from the voting station, and then on my way home from the beach I timed myself back home to see how long it takes to get to the beach from my place walking. So that's how I figure it takes me about 16 min to walk to the beach walking at a good clip (though not speed walking:) By the time I got home it was 11:11. Nice morning for a walk. With the sun out I did work up some of a sweat, but it's not too hot out and there's a nice breeze :) So now I'm relaxing before I work on the retail part of my day :)

      Woo Hoo! 2 weeks and counting! I'm doing good :) Anyhow, this morning I woke up about an hour before my alarm went off, read for about 45 min in bed and then got up and did the full 41 min of Fat Burning Yoga. Yay I can do the full episodes of both yoga routines that I have :)

      Well, today I feel much better. Last night I was so tired I went to bed around 9:30. This morning I woke up about 6 min before my alarm went off and then I did The Joy of Yoga. I've definitely made progress 'cause I was able to do the whole thing. So that took 36 min. And now I feel that much better :)

      Well this morning I did a 20-25 min walk around the neighborhood again. I didn't exactly time myself this morning, still kinda waking up when I left my place. I woke up about an hour and a half to two hours before my alarm went off. That sucked. Didn't really feel like doing anything, and I definitely didn't have the energy or whatever to do a work-out video, but I made myself go for a walk. Sometimes movement has the effect of waking you up some more. Which it has. Still lacking some energy though. Definitely had more energy yesterday. Lack of enough sleep does that to you. Not like I went to bed too late or whatever, just woke up too frickin early. Well at least I have time to do dishes this morning.

      Well this morning when my alarm woke me up I didn't feel like doing anything, but I did. The first thing I did was have a shower, kinda silly I know before going for a walk but I felt like having one. Then after I was already to go I went on a 35 min walk, exploring my neighboring areas again. Nice out, somewhat warm, but there was a nice breeze and I had my water. One thing I was thinking while walking is that one day when I just don't feel like driving to work in a warm car I can always walk to work. Only in the summer though when there's enough light out when I get off of work. Mind you, I guess it also depends on when I start work :)Anyhow, I'm hungry and I still have to have my breakfast. So off I go.

      Well this morning I woke up feeling more refreshed than yesterday, so the odd day taking it easy from the videos doesn't hurt :) This morning I worked on the Butt Legs Tummy ball video. I took it easier on my abs this time so they should be as sore tomorrow as they were last time. Again the video is like 23 minutes long but since I took a few breaks when it came to the abs I probably did like 18-20 minutes of it. And then today is housework day with vaccuuming and laundry and stuff. So I should go get started on that, as well as eat some breakfast.

      Well today's my day off from work, so I slept in a bit. I didn't do any excercising this morning, but I did some walking this afternoon. The first time was when I had some maintanance done to my car, it took about two hours, so I walked down to Zellers and had a chicken caesar salad for lunch, explored Petcetera a bit and then walked back to Fountain Tire. Then after I sat down at home for a bit I walked to the bank and back to get some laundry change for tomorrow. The walk took about half an hour in total (there and back) give or take a few minutes that I was in the bank. I'm roasting now from that since it's like 32C out. Maybe I'm slowly getting used to the heat. Who knows. It almost looks like some storm clouds are coming in from the west. I hope so. A storm would be welcome now. Well the rain anyway. I think right now we've had more lightning caused fires in BC than those started by people. Maybe I'm wrong, but I've heard more about the lightning started ones. Ok, I'll stop rambling and go and drink some more water and see if I can get ahold of Gina. Bye for now.

      Well, this morning I woke up about 20-30 minutes before my alarm went off. I lay in bed until I was fully awake which was about 10 min or so and then I got up. The first thing I did was 33 min of fat burning yoga. So I had a good work-out this morning. Even though I did 33 min of it, I still wasn't able to finish the whole routine. I stopped after the first couple moves that worked on the abs. Mine are still telling, just a tiny bit, from the ball workout. My stomach muscles are definitely feeling less sore than what they were. So I am definitely getting there :)

      Well this morning when I woke up I was lacking the energy to do my morning routine so all I basically did was my dishes, put together my lunch, tried calling Gina and fiddled with my e-mail and stuff. Plus my stomach muscles were/are still recovering somewhat. After I was finished work I met up with Jay and at Subway and I had something to eat 'cause I was starving. After we were done there we went for a walk by the creek. We went further than I had ever been before, so all in all it was probably like a 15-20 minute walk. I dunno, I wasn't watching the time. So at least I did do a little something today :) Anyhow, I'm done in so I'm going to bed and we'll see what tomorrow brings.

      Well this morning I woke up like half an hour before my alarm went off. I did lay in bed for a while, but then I finally got up. Since my stomach muscles are somewhat sore from yesterday this morning I went for a  26 minute walk, sort of exploring my neighborhood some more. One think I like about walks, in residential areas, is I can look at all the different houses and get ideas of what kind of house I want some day. It was a gorgeous morning for a walk too :)

      Well, today/last night my sleep was more rested so I woke up a few minutes before my alarm went off. For my workout this morning I tried my excercise ball video. It's not all that long but it works your butt, legs, and tummy. So you do work up something of a sweat. I did about 18 min or so of it. It's actually about 23 minutes long by I took short breaks during parts of it, or between moves. Still need a shower though :) I'm thinking of maybe using this video and the fat burning yoga alternately, since neither of them are fast paced but they both give you something of a workout. On a side note, maybe one day I should get an excerice ball a little bigger than the one I have now? It's an ok size, but with some of the moves on the video it seemed a bit small. Still works ok though.

      Well I'm back in Penticton now, and I slept through 5 min or so of my alarm. Sort of unusual for me. Anyhow I did Joy of Yoga this morning for 12 min. Between my headache I woke up with and my calves needing to get in shape I guess I couldn't progress further than that 12 min mark. Eventually I will though. When I was in Kamloops I picked up  Tae Bo (finally) and excercise ball work out videos. And I also got a bicycle pump so I can finally finish inflating my excercise ball. So now I have more variety :) I probably won't get to the Tae Bo right away since it is very high energy, but I can get around to doing the exercise ball workouts sometime soon.

      Well, this morning, since I'm in Kamloops, I went and did a 23 min walk around a part of Juniper. Gorgeous morning for a walk. Before I left I did a few leg stretches and what not. All in all it was a good cardio work out. It's been a while since I've been for a walk around Juniper. I could say that Penticton needs more hills, but it doesn't. The outskirts are hilly enough. Mind you I haven't walked around there (the outskirts) much if at all. I have to find a good walking route close to my place, but I'll get to that soon enough.

      Well, I've had one of those mornings where you wake up way before your alarm is set to go off :p I really should have slept more but I just couldn't go back to sleep. So I lay in bed for about an hour, and then I got up to do some yoga. I did Joy of Yoga this morning. I figure I wasn't totally awake enough to do the Fat Burning workout this morning. I did 12 min of the Joy of Yoga. This morning I realized my legs are some what out of shape, just from all the stretching that was involved. Well, at least I did two minutes more of yoga this morning than I did yesterday. I wasn't sure if I was going to be doing anything like that this morning since I'm going to Kamloops later, but since I woke up early enough I was able to. Everything works out in the end :) Anyhow, don't know what else to say, so for now I'm done my writing.

      It's amazing how much energy I have, just from getting up earlier and doing that little bit of yoga and some vacuuming and stuff this morning. It's sort of hard to sit still on my breaks at work (which is where I am now). I just thought I'd leave this quick note since I can't think of anything else to do on my break. Wonder what I'll be like after a week or two of this routine :) I guess we'll find out. I was thinking too of giving myself little rewards after each week of doing or starting out on this routine. We'll see what happens though. Anyhow, I should be getting back to my station. I'll write some more later.

      Well this morning my alarm woke me up at 8:30. Didn't totally feel like getting up, but I still did. The first thing I did, other than getting a drink of water, was that I did like 10 min of Crunch Fat Burning Yoga. I find it easier to do than the Joy of Yoga. I only did 10 min of it since I'm more out of shape than I thought. That'll improve though. Once I get going I'll be able to do more of it. Even doing just 10 min of it though I feel energized and better. Now I need a shower :) But I'll get to that soon enough. Since I'm up early enough I just might go for a walk later, or vaccuum. Vaccuuming needs done more though, and it is doing some cardio :) Well I'm definitely awake now and ready to start my day some more, so maybe I should go do that :)

      It's amazing what kind of ideas you can get while eating breakfast and reading Self and then doing dishes. This morning I've formed a resolution for myself: I'm going to start living a healthier life/lifestyle. Not like I was living unhealthy before, but now I just want to start being and living healthier. I guess you could say this is my New Year's or Summer resolution. And I figure by keeping a blog I'm sort of giving myself incentive and pushing myself to go forward and keep doing what I'm doing or should be doing. Or whatever. But here are the goals I'm setting for myself (that might not be the right wording :p ):  -go to bed around 10:30pm -wake up (hopefully) by 8:30/9am -first thing I do as part of my day will be some sort of exercise, whether it be walking/jogging, yoga, and/or stretching/exercises -will not come on my computer in the morning until I've done the above, and then one of the first things I'll do is write in here -eat healthier  So you see my aim is to live a more healthy and more active lifestyle, in a manner of speaking. And hopefully/maybe shed at least a little bit of the extra weight I've gained since school/work. And you never know, while I'm recording my progress and what not in this blog I'll write and rant about my work as well :) We'll see what happens.   Well Ta ta for now, I should finish getting ready for work and all that fun stuff. I will be back later. Ciao

      Well this morning I went for a 23 min wandering walk, exploring other blocks around me I hadn't been before. I think mornings are the best time for walks and doing exercises :) Everything is a bit quieter and definitely cooler, plus it gets you reved up for the day :)

      Yes there are times I question my own sanity :) Like when I go for 33 min walks in temperatures in the mid 30's like I did this evening. I just felt like I had to get up and do something and get out of my apartment and exercise or something. So that's what I did. At least I had some shorts to do it in :) I went to  Zellers after work today and got two new pairs of shorts, $7 each, you can't go wrong there :)

      Well I've just come back from a 25 min walk wandering around the neighborhood, exploring some blocks I haven't walked before. It was somewhat warm walking in slacks and a sleeveless top though, nevermind that it is summer. My only pair of shorts are in the wash. I really do need to get some more :p Hopefully this week since they're supposed to be on sale at Zellers. We'll see what happens.

      Well I haven't been up to much; not doing my routine as I should. It's hard though when you get up between 4 and 4:30 am to go and get ready for work and stuff, and then now that it's summer it's hot when I'm finished work. I'm just whining aren't I? :) Well I just be more pro-active and get out in the evenings, like around 6 or something, to go for a walk or something. At least that will get me moving and by then it's starting to cool down. I'm thinking of doing that tonight. Not doing anything is starting to make me feel ick and so out of shape and stuff. Can't find the right words to explain it right now. Well, I'll be glad when it starts cooling off. Should I go for a walk tonight I'll post it and stuff.  Mind you, yesterday I did go for a bit of a walk. Though I don't know if it counts since It was just to and around the library and back. Yay I have a library card! :) Free books to read! :)

      Taking a walk around the parking lot at work on my "lunch" break at work I've just realized how much I miss doing my routine that I was doing in the morning before I went back to work. It's nice right now 'cause it's sunny out and starting to get warm, but it's not roasting yet. Maybe I should start swimming in the lake in the evening or at least going for walks since working the early shift seems to be what the scheduling department/computer likes giving me. I guess I like routines as long as they allow me freedom of movement, so to speak, and I'm not locked into doing one thing.

      Well today my excercise excursion was walking to and around the farmer's market, and then back again. So I was about for close to an hour this morning walking around. It was getting pretty warm, with the odd breeze, by the time I got back. If it is warm now, it's going to be roasting later, and there are no clouds in the sky to provide any reliefe. But I guess that's what lakes and air conditioning are for :)

      Well yesterday my bout of excercise was walking to my bank and back for laundry money. That took about half an hour, give or take. My right leg that was broken 5 years ago wasn't too happy about that, on top of the work out I gave it the day before. I think it's more the muscles around the bone, than the bone itself that was sore though. So part of it I think is that I just need to build up the muscle strength or impact ability/tolerance in those muscles or whatever. I will do that slowly though, one way or another. Today I'm not sure what I'm up to excercise wise, I might just take somewhat of a break today to let my leg recover. But I will be doing things like vaccuuming and grocery shopping to get me moving some :)

      Well I'm back at it. I just came back from a 23 minute excursion of walking and jogging. To begin with I did four minutes of walking and then one minute of jogging, and then back to walking. I did that a total of three times, and then I walked back to my place. In the middle of a summer afternoon probably isn't the best time to do it, but it's not like I'm gonna wake up any earlier than I am right now, that would just be insane since I'm getting up to go to work at 4:15 in the morning :p Evenings would probably be a better time to do things right now, but I had the urge/inclination to do it this afternoon instead and I didn't want to put that off cause then I just wouldn't have done anything period. Coming home around 2 in the afternoon makes it very tempting to be lazy after work :)

      Don't you just hate it when you have one of those miserable weeks that you just lack energy and enthusiasm? Actually I've had two of those weeks. The reason, the accident I was in on the 6th. That sucked. And it screwed up my right wrist as well as sleeping habits. My right wrist was bothering me for a while when I typed a lot, so this past week I just stayed home and took it easy and tried to let my wrist heal up some more. And until like yesterday I was waking up between 5:40 and 7 in the morning. Too early to get up when you don't have any real reason to :p So now I have to get back into a routine of doing stuff again. Until my wrist is completely healed I'll probably just go for walks and other cardio activities that won't bother my wrist. Yoga and working on my ball would do that. I suppose it's a good thing I'm not bowling regularly right now :)

      Well, my week could have been better. On Tuesday I was in a car accident that left my car totaled but just gave me some bruises. So since then I have just been letting my body and mind react to that instead of doing my excercises. Next week I'm definitely getting back into them though now that my energy is coming back to me. So now I've got to look for another car. It would be fun or better if I wasn't so dependent on cars or didn't have a time limit. But I sorta do. Joy :p

      Well today I slept in until 10, and that felt really good. I feel really well rested. Not like I don't usually, but the past couple of days I haven't, so it was nice for a change today. Gotta love pms, throws your system out of wack and makes you have less energy and stuff. So today will be my day for cleaning, shopping, and excercising :)Basically today I'll catch up on stuff that needs to be done. Maybe I'll even get around to calling Gina tonight :) See how she likes doing interviews. Anyhow, I think I'll go and start my day some more :) Maybe I'll be back later to say how my day has gone. Bye for now.

      I think I've been having one of those weeks where you wake up not feeling like doing too much, but you're happy doing the little things, even if it's a lot of the little things. This morning I got up and went for another walk. This one 34 min long. So I got something of a workout :)Maybe I should have a shower but I'm one of those people that doesn't like to have a shower once they've gotten dressed for the day or whatever. I'll have a shower in the morning right after I wake up or at night once I get home from work or before I go to bed. Just the way my mind works. Go figure.

      Well this morning after I had my shower I went for a walk for 20 min. I should probably have my showers after I go for my walks but I just feel better for some reason if I have a shower right after I wake up, or soon after. Go figure.  Last night I didn't do anything since by the time I got off work I was starving. So I came home and had something to eat, and once I'd done that my energy just crashed. I know, I'm weird. Oh well.

      Well today was/is another one of those days :p I didn't want to do or start any of my excercises this morning since my landlord was supposed to be coming over and I didn't know when, and I didn't want to start anything and then stop in the middle of it.He actually ended up coming over just before I left for work. Go figure. So today I've been really full of energy. Which isn't a bad thing, but it can be sort of frustrating at work sometimes since I just sit at a computer for work :p Well (hopefully) tonight I'll do something whether it's go for a walk somewhere like the beach or a routine in my apartment. We'll see what happens.

      Well after going for a few days without doing anything for one reason or another I went for a 39 min walk earlier this afternoon. It was sorta warm (30) but not too bad. Though by the time I was done I was pretty warm and ready to hop in a lake with all of my clothes on. Haven't done that yet in this lifetime. Yesterday when I went shopping I picked up some peaches and grapes and a fresh salmon. So last night for dinner I made myself some salmon. So that warmed my apartment up some with the oven on. It was yummy I think that about catches things up for now. Later I'm thinking of walking to the library to return and renew some books as well as get some new ones.

      Well despite my whining this morning I did end up going for a 24 min walk around the neighborhood while it was 30 out. Shoulda worn shorts. I just felt like doing something to get me moving, so I went for a bit of a walk.

      Well this whole routine of waking up at 4am so I can get to work by 5 is really starting to tell on me. I went to bed earlier last night and got more rest than I did the previous night and I'm as tired today as I was yesterday. And lately I haven't been feeling all that energetic to any sort of exercising. I'm getting more ideas to eat healthier though, so I guess that's something. I'm just hoping sometime within the next couple of weeks at least that I'll get an easier schedule to work with for work. Today I submitted or redid my preferences again, so maybe that will help. But I won't be able to tell anything from that until the beginning of September since it takes a few weeks to kick in :p Man I hate being cranky.

      Today almost feels like it should be Thursday... Anyhow... This afternoon I went for a short 15-20 min walk with a small attempt at jogging, just 'cause I felt like it. I felt really good going out, but when I tried jogging my legs just didn't want to do that much work. I miss it when I could just run or jog and not think about what I was doing or how I was doing and stuff. Don't know if that comes from being out of shape or as a result from my (first) accident, or both. Well at least it's a good day, and it looks like there's a chance of it getting stormy tonight. That will help keep things cool.

      Well today I went for a 37 min walk. I wasn't totally up to it when I left, but I felt like doing something other than sitting around my apartment on my day off. So I went for a walk. It was nice out, warm but not too warm and there was a bit of a breeze as well. They're calling for a possibility of thunder showers this evening/tonight. Hope that happens. At least the rain anyway.

      Well today after I got home from work and had some lunch and relaxed a bit I did some Tae Bo Contact 1 for 18 min. That worked up of a bit of a sweat.  I didn't get all that tired from it, but my arms were starting to get tired from all of the punching movements. Still don't know how long the video is. Maybe later once it cools down I'll go for a walk outside since I seem to feel sort of energetic today\right now. Go figure.

      Well so far today my exercise has been cleaning the bathroom as well as sweeping and washing the linoleum floors of my apartment. Who knows what else I'll get in for the day in terms of exercise or activity, but should I do anything more than I have already I'll post it.
