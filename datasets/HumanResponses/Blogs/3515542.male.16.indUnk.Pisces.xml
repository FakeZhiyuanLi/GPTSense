      last night i worked the baybears game. i was working the batting cage, dripping in sweat in the hot, humid weather, when it started to storm. so i put up all of the stuff and just stood there for about 2 hours before i got off of work. later i heard on the radio that the game was cancelled and that there will be a doubleheader tonight starting at 6:05. that blows. two seven inning games=just about 4 and a half hours. so i might be there for a loooooooong time. big paycheck coming soon...  music: jamiroquai-virtual insanity  gp

      today i went out and bought "paul's botique," the 1989 beastie boys album. wow. that is all i have to say. what an amazing album. there are sooooo many good songs and they are all different and creative. heres a good quote from the song "3 minute rule":  "I'm takin' all M.C.'s out in the place Takin' life as it comes no fool am I I'm goin' off gettin' paid and I don't ask why Playin' beats on my box makin' music for the many Know alota def girls that would do anything A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain I'm just chillin' like Bob Dylan I smoke cheeba it helps me with my brain I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane People come up to me and they try to talk shit man I've been making records since you were sucking on your mother's dick"  amazing. go buy it...NOW!!!!  i also noticed at best buy a couple things: first, there are no more copies of 311 greatest hits. wow. that really suprised me. second, there are a lot of cds out there that i want. included are franz ferdinand, modest mouse(someone please buy this for me), and other b-boys albums. oh, and zach hexum's album. speaking of which i chatted with him over im the other night. hes a cool cat. and if you dont believe me, ill show you the log. hah i told cat i talked with him and that he is the brother of nick, she started chokin me! lol last night at work was great. me and cat got off early, after working only 2 hours. so we decided to go talk with some other people. lol she was makin fun of the junior miss people so bad. it was hilarious! i cant wait till this weekend. :)  gp

      yay it rained all day so i dont have to go to work tonight. i'm pretty sure that the game is still on, but since it rained so much, there are pretty much no amusements. and jason said that i was doin really good saturady night. i have worked the putt putt thing in gaslight park and i have almost mastered the first hole. what do you expect me to do when nobody wants to pay a dollar for 3 holes of mini golf? :) there are 6 games in the next 7 days so i should stay pretay busy. tomorrow is the release date of the beastie boys' new album "to the 5 boroughs" and best buy has all beastie boys cds on sale. hell yea baby, a perfect time to pick up "paul's botique." i prolly wont get the new one cuz the fags at best buy wont let me buy parental advisory cds. and i know my parents wont buy an album for me with a track entitled "hey fuck you" on it. oh well. hrmmm i guess thats all for now.  peace, gp  song o' the day: beastie boys - ch-check it out

      last night i worked at the baybears game. it went pretty good. i  was  working the batting cage (yay) but then it broke so i had to work the arcade with this other guy. all i did was stand there in the air conditioned arcade room and gave 4 tokens to kids with yellow wristbands, the "outstanding students." the guy i was workin with let me off a little early because i didnt really need to be there cuz of the batting cage being broken. he wouldnt have done this if he would have known that the gamewas going to 12 innings :)  so i basically got off an hour early. work tonight and monday. oh yeah, and we won 5-4. stanley cup finals game 6 tonight and if the flames win, they win the cup and the championship. and guess what! i wont be able to see the game. the lightning had better win. oh well. later.  peas, luv, & uni-t, gp

      ok, heres the situation. if the pacers lose tonight, the season is over. this means that there is no more basketball for me and that the fucking lakers will probably win yet another nba championship. as for the nhl, (no i'm NOT candadian) the lightning are in the stanley cup playoffs with the flames, a team from fucking canada. bleh, i will do something bad if the lakers and flames with their respective leagues. anyways, it is summer and that means sun, beach, and work. and i work at....the baybears, "amusing" little kids. more on that later. oh, and by the way, the 311 "greatest hits" compilation is out in stores in a week from today. go buy it. dont steal. and the beastie boys new album "to the 5 boroughs" is out 2 weeks from today. definitely go buy that. the new song "ch-check it out" is one of their best songs, ever. i also highly recommend "the beastie boys anthology" which features 42 songs on 2 discs with an 80 page booklet. i guess thats all for now.  peas, luv, & uni-t, gp

      i worked the batting cage yet again last night and tonight ill probably do the same. there are almost no people at the weekday games so its no big deal, and there are no games til the 19th after tonight so i have almost 2 weeks to be off.  today i went to the eye doctor and got my eyes checked and i get new contacts in 3-5 days. i didnt have to do the glaucoma test today cuz i passed out the last time they did it. ill prolly have to do it next time though. oh well. thats all for now i guess...  gp

      wanna know what i worked last night at the baybears game? of course you do...i worked the batting cage which blows monkey cock. there were lots of people there too so that didnt make things any better. there was this one old guy who hit the ball (which was traveling very fast) and it hit the pitching machine and then hit my left leg. ive got a pretty big bruise on it but it doesnt hurt. the fireworks and cotton candy girl helped cheer me up a little :)  today i went to circuit city and bought the los lonely boys cd. its really good. buy it.   and saturday night jeff gordon won the pepsi 400 beotches!!! yall can go to www.pepsiedge.com and get a free 2 liter pepsi edge, i know i have!   my baseball cards page is back up...http://padresfan44.tripod.com  all for now, matt

      hey peoples i just got back from biloxi (the gambling capitol of the south) to get tickets for the sinbad show next friday night. my dad played the slots for like 2 minutes and he put in a total of 5 quarters and got back a total of 5 quarters. i dont know how people can sit there and do that all day. everyone in there seemed to be so sleazy and just bleh. casinos are for trashy people. tonight i have to be at work at 4:30 for this picnic/softball game between the mobile firefighters and the mobile cops. tickets are a fucking ripoff at 12 bucks a pop! i think that is for a picnic and the game, but stilll, why waste your time? fireworks are tonight and tomorrow night (yes, i have to work the 4th of july) so i think ill stay to watch those one night and leave during the fireworks to get a headstart on the after-game crowds in the parking lot. ok now im gonna go figure out how to make my garfield sunglassed fit...  gp
