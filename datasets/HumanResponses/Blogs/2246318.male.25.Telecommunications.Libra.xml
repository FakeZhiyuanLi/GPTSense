       So it's almost Thanksgiving again.  I really like this time of year.  Most people are in a better mood, there is a crispness to the air, and most of all it means that turkey is in the oven.  This year I decided that I was going to make the turkey.  Last year I wanted to but decided to let my Mom do the honors.  I am a big fan of Good Eats(as some of you may already know) so I am going to brine my turkey like Alton does in the classic episode " urlLink Romancing the Bird (A Good Eats Thanksgiving) "  Hopefully I will do it right and everything will taste as good as it looks in the show.  I will let you know how things go.  Also, I saw a commercial for the Cross Roads Farm and Craft Market and saw that they have a website.  I tried to access it but it said it wasn't there.  I don't know if they are working on it or if was just down when I tried, but here is the address anyways, maybe it will be back up soon.   urlLink www.thecrossroadsmarket.com   Have a very happy Thanksgiving all!

       Hello again.  A friend of mine brought me to a Farm and Craft Market yesterday.  I wasn't looking to find too much that interested me, but alas, I did.  The first place that I found something interesting was "Spice Harbor."  Now my friend said that I would like it there, and she was right.  They had a lot of different kinds of fresh spices that you just can't get around town here.  Most of the spices were pretty cheap also, 1/4 ounce of Spanish saffron was only $8.  That's not too shabby.  Then while looking at some Emu Oil products, I get tackled by the owner to try some Ostrich meat "beef" sticks.  I was a little leary, but I tried it, and it was actually really good.  No, it didn't taste like chicken.  Then he had my try the summer sausage, and it was really good too.  Too bad I didn't have any money with me or I would have bought some.  My friend did buy some hand lotion that she tried there and said it worked great.  The final thing that I found that interested me was Ice Wine.  I've only heard of ice wine once before on the  urlLink Food Network  on the show " urlLink The Best Of ."  I knew this wine was very unique and I just had to try a sample.  I went up to the guy at the stand, Michael Burkland,  and asked if I could try a sample.  Now, I am 25 years old and I am always told that I look older than I am.  He looked at me oddly when I asked and pulled the bottle out of the cooler.  He poured a little bit into a plastic cup and asked me how old I was.  I was a little shocked by this and I almost blanked on my age, but I told him that I was 25.  He made a little joke, then gave me the sample.  I am not a big fan of wine, I just don't care for the taste or the mouth feel of it, but this wine was VERY good.  Michael went on to tell me that it is a desert wine and the way it is processed makes it very very sweet.  It was the clear cut best wine I've ever had.  It was very sweet, the taste was intense, the after taste was actually a good one.  This small bottle that he had at the stand, which resembled a extra virgin olive oil bottle, was in the price range of $24 US.  I'm not one to spend much on alcohol but I thought that I have to get some of that.  I asked him where I can purchase it other than the show there and he told me that it was at all the local liquor stores in my town and handed me his card.  I am going over to my sisters for Christmas morning and I hope to bring a bottle of this outstanding wine with me.  You can go to their website at  urlLink www.merrittestatewinery.com   I had a good time on that little trip, it was very nice to get out of the house for once.  Until next time, DAN

       Ok, so I haven't really been into reality shows for quite a while now.  I, admitting, used to watch Survivor, Who wants to be a Millionaire?, and the Mole.  But almost everything since has been boring.  One that really did interest me when I saw the commercials was "Average Joe."  Why?  Because the concept is great.  Take this beautiful girl who has been in beauty shows and was a pro cheerleader and give her a group of average guys, not models, to chose from.  She said before the show started that looks doesn't matter, and almost all women say the same thing.  This show set out to either prove them right or wrong.  Now, I consider myself to be not all that great looking so I was intrigued with this premise.  This past week she cut the number of guys from six down to three, then the big surprise, which I have to say I was kind of expecting.  They brought in three pretty boys.  One, from the beginning of the show who welcomed her to the show and then left, and two others.  She seemed pretty happy to see these guys come in and hear that they are now part of the show and the three "average joe" guy's competition.  Now, this adds a very interesting twist.  She has shown that she isn't so shallow that she won't give these "average joe" guys a chance, but is she shallow enough to dump them for the new pretty boys for their looks.  She hasn't spent nearly as much time with these new guys and doesn't know them as well as she knows the other three.  I am rooting for Adam, he is the most "Average" of the three and I hope that she doesn't fall for the other's good looks only.  But, from past experience, looks matter!  I think she will go with one of the pretty boys.  But we'll see I guess.  "Average Joe" is on NBC on Mondays, check your local listings for times.  You can also learn more by going to the "Average Joe" website:  urlLink http://www.nbc.com/Average_Joe/   Ok, time for bed for me.  I'll see you soon! DAN

       So I put the carpet in my room yesterday.  My room looks good now.  I even found a place for my Dave Matthews Band subway poster that Amber got me.  It's almost 6 feet wide!  It looks great.  I am now moving my stuff into my room, which looks like a bedroom finally.  Today I am going up there after the Bills game to tack the carpet down.  For anyone who would like to e-mail me about this blog you can.  When e-mailing me, please put the subject as "blog."   urlLink viperwd@hotmail.com   Until next time... DAN

       Ok, in case any of you read my post from early this morning.  She called and apologized.  So I am taking that post down.  For those of you that didn't, my best friend and I had a fight last night and I said that I didn't want to be friends with her any more.  But she called this morning and said that she was sorry for what she did, and I said that I was sorry for what I did.  So now things are better, we are at least still friends.  Ok, I have to go and help put carpet in my room, after that my room will be ready to move into.  :)  DAN

       So, my Mom just bought a new house and I am helping work on it.  I've been working on my room first so I can get it all ready.  (Yes, I still live with my Mom, but hopefully not for too much longer.)  A couple of days ago I got the ceiling painted, then I didn't the walls.  Today I got all the trim done, and all that's left is where the ceiling and walls meet.  I ran out of gray paint to finish.  Next I am going to do the closet probably tomorrow.  After that is done I can put in the carpet that we got the other day.  It is also gray, it should look good in the room and match pretty good.  The colors are skyline blue for the ceiling, blue wale grey for the walls and cashmere white for the trim and closet.  All the wiring in the house has to be redone.  I am getting two new outlets and they are going to replace the two that are already in there.  Once that is done, I will be able to start moving my stuff in.  My room is probably three times the size it is now which will be nice.    I just thought I'd let all you who know me know what I've been up to the last week or so.  Laters. DAN

       Hello again, glad you made it!  Today, for those of you that don't know, I'm going to let you in on my favorite Band.   urlLink Dave Matthews Band   I've been a really big fan since their first studio album came out in 1994.  Many of their songs have a lot of meaning to me.  I have been to 4 concerts.  2 at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo, I was in the 10th row for each.  1 at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto Canada, I was in the 12th row there.  And 1 at Six Flags Darien Lake in Buffalo, I was only in the grass(I bought the tickets late.)  If you have never heard of them, check them out!  For those of you who are already fans, Dave Matthews is going to be on Saturday Night Live this Saturday, Nov.  8, 2003 at 11:30pm EST to promote his solo album.

       Ok, so I made a mistake.  I sent everyone to a bible website instead of here.  hehe, oops!  Not that I have anything against those types of websites or anything, just not what I'm trying to do here.  But you made it now and I guess I will give you another very interesting entry. :P  Today I am going to let you in on my favorite cooking TV show,  urlLink Good Eats .  I like to cook.  I have some experience cooking in the restaurant business at Red Lobster.  But I really like to cook at home.  It can be fun.  But Good Eats makes it even more fun.   urlLink Alton Brown , the host, mixes pop culture with cooking to make it interesting to watch.  Even if you don't like cooking shows, you should check it out.  It's on the  urlLink Food Network  every weekday at 11:30pm or Wednesdays at 9pm.  Not only does Alton give you recipes but he tells you why things do what they do in those recipes so you can change them up any way you want.  It lets you experiment and make up your own recipes.  It's actually fun to watch, and gives me lots of ideas for cooking.  Check it out sometime.  That's all for now, TTFN DAN

       Hello everyone, and welcome to my new Blog.  What is a blog you ask?  I asked myself that same question earlier today when I was surfing the net, but more on that later.  This blog will be a mish-mash of all kinds of different things.  One day it might be a journal of the events in my day.  Another day it might be my rants and/or raves of a website that I found.  And another day it might be my thoughts about an article in Scientific American that I read.  Who knows what it will be, I'll keep you guessing.  I hope some of you find my thoughts interesting, and if you do, I hope you will come back.  For everyone else, thank you for at least giving me a chance and checking this out.  This is a new thing for me and hopefully will evolve into something very fun and informative for everyone(including myself.)  If, by some rare chance, you find this interesting enough to link to or mention, let me know, I want to see :).  Ok, now on how I got here.  I got an e-mail newsletter from a new website that I found last week,   urlLink www.howstuffworks.com , and I saw something interesting.  "How Blogs Work"  I think to myself, "What in the world is a blog?"  So I printed out the article and read it while watching Conan.  Now I'm not going to try to explain what blogs are since I barely know myself, so I will send you to the article that I found so you can find out for yourself.  Maybe you'll even make your own, if you haven't already.   urlLink How Blogs Work   Now I am a very big computer "freak."  I pride myself in knowing quite a bit about computers.  There isn't a lot of things on the internet or about computers that I haven't at least heard of.  So when I heard about blogs today I was taken aback about how big they are and how I haven't even heard of them yet.  Well, this was my first blog, I hope you like it and I hope you all come back.

       Hello, this is my last post of 2003.  It's been an interesting year.  I hope next year will be better.  I won't bore you will a look back so lets just look to the future.  I start my new job on Monday and I am in a new house, as close as I'm going to get to starting over for a while.  On a side note.  My friend Bamboo2 got laid off yesterday at work.  They did it for very stupid reasons and they lost a good worker.  I would like to wish her good luck on finding a new and even better job!  Until next year, DAN

       One week to go and I go back to work and my three month vacation will be over.  I am glad actually, I have been pretty bored when not working on the new house.  It will be nice to be back to work and be able to talk to people again.  I miss that interaction a lot.  The money is going to be nice, that is for sure.  Maybe I'll even meet a girl that I like there.  That would be really good too.  Without giving too much info out because I don't know how much they want anyone to know, I am going to tell you a little about bamboo2 who found my typo.  She is a good friend of mine who I used to work with.  When I first met her I thought she was really annoying but once I got to know her I liked her more.  She goes out with all of us to Applebees on Friday nights and she has a boyfriend in England.  Just thought I'd let you know so you don't sit there wondering who she is.  I don't really want to write about my Christmas because it's over with.  But I will fill you in on my Thanksgiving turkey that I never told you about, but promised.  As I said before I brined my turkey like Alton brown does on his show Good Eats.  It turned out great!  The skin was a dark golden brown and very crispy and the inside was perfectly done and very very juicy.  For my first time cooking turkey it turned out better than I expected.  I will brine turkey again if I get the chance.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it, DAN

       Hello,  I can't talk long but I said that I would post once I move in and I am moved in.  We have been sleeping here since this past Saturday.  I just, although, set up my Mom's computer to check e-mail and look a few things up on Christmas eve, so I had a lot of e-mail to go through.  Christmas wasn't too bad, it could have been worse but it could have been better.  I wish I had money to get my friends and family stuff for Christmas but I didn't so I felt really bad.  I start my new job in just over a week so I will be able to catch up on bills.  I gotta go, I'm really busy lately and I have to sit on the floor to use the computer right now so it's uncomfortable.  I hope you all had a great Christmas.  Talk to you soon!  DAN  PS  Thanks to  urlLink Bamboo2  for finding a spelling error in my last posting.

       I finally got a job!  I will be working at  urlLink PowerNet Global  through Express personal starting January 5, 2004.  Like Shannon at Express said, it's a good way to start the new year!  I will be a customer service Rep.  PowerNet Global offers Internet, long distance phone service and data services.  It should be a fun job in a field closer to my career choice.  At the new house we got our new refrigerator today.  I love it.  I'm a gadget guy and that includes big gadgets like new refrigerators.  It is very nice and has crushed ice, one of those things that I just love.  I will be sleeping there either Friday or Saturday.  The phone will be hooked up Friday and the cable on Saturday.  It's starting to look like a home finally, and my room is feeling more and more comfortable.  Laters, DAN

       Well, they finally caught Saddam Hussein.  No matter how you felt about the war here in the US, you have to agree, as I do, that this is a good thing.  I was against the war from the beginning, even though I knew Saddam had to go.  I was glad to get on the Internet yesterday morning to see that they caught him.  Now we wait to see the trial and see what punishment he gets.  The Buffalo Bills lost again yesterday, barely.  They are not out of the playoffs for sure.  Now we just hope to have the best defense in football.  One more early morning.  The electrician should be done tomorrow.  He finished my room so I can set up my bed and my computer and all my other stuff.  My room is starting to look like a room finally.  I can't wait to get out of an apartment, the people upstairs are really really loud.  They stomp around like they are squashing grapes or something.  Ok, off to bed. DAN

       Hello again, it's been a while since I've posted.  I hope everyone is fairing will with all the snow we are getting here.  So, Melana picked Jason.  I'm not really sure why I'm surprised with that.  I guess I was just hoping(for my own sake) that she wouldn't pick the pretty boy just because he's pretty, but that is exactly what she did.  It just proves that even women that say looks don't matter are just saying that.  Looks do matter.  Of course I knew that, but this just proves it to those that said that they don't.  Adam was the better guy all around.  He had money, he had friends that loved him, he was on his own and secure, and he knew how to treat her right.  Jason?  Well, lets see, he knew how to kiss and how too look pretty.  Now people always tell me not to worry, looks don't really matter to women, they look for other things like sense of humor.  Well, I guess there goes my hopes.  I guess there is going to be a Average Joe 2 based in Hawaii but I don't think I'm going to watch it, I already know what is going to happen.  They showed some previews of it and the girl freaked out, she was pissed that they did this to her.  Oh well, such is the vain life.  If you want to chat about this, e-mail me at  urlLink viperwd@hotmail.com  with the subject of "blog."  Now on to other things.  The house is almost set for us to move in.  The electrician is almost done with all the new lines and service.  We have carpet in the living room now.  We also moved a lot of the living room furniture.  My room, well I moved everything except my mattress and most of my clothes.  I guess the cable and phone will be moved next Saturday, that is when we are going to be officially moved in.  It will be nice to be done moving, I really hate moving.  Well, I still have no job.  I have gone to a few interviews with no call backs as of yet.  Red Lobster is also delaying my unemployment so I have no money coming in.  I might be losing my car, and with no car I can't get a job very far from home.  What a good time for all this.  I can't get anyone anything for Christmas this year.  I hate it, I feel so bad that I can't get anyone anything.  Maybe something good will come out of this.  I guess time will only tell.  Ok, I hope to post one more time before I move and then as soon as I get my computer up and running once I move.  So have a good week all!  DAN

       Ok, time to do a couple of updates on things I've posted in the recent past.  First, moving into my new home.  I moved my desk the other day.  It is a very large computer desk.  I actually pulled the bottom and heaviest part up the stairs by myself.  It wasn't too bad, I thought we would have more problems than we did.  I got it all set up and started to set up the speakers and other things for my computer.  I also moved my bookshelf and put my CD's, and DVD's in it.  And lastly, I moved my night stand over.  My room is coming together nicely.  The guy to do the electricity is coming at the end of this week and the guy to do the carpet in the living room is coming on the 10th, so after all that's done I can move in and live there.  Although I am going to wait until we get phone service and cable and move things like the stove in.  Next, I watched the new episode of "Average Joe" tonight.  They put Melana, I think that's how you spell her name, in fat makeup and a fat suit, just like they would for a movie, and had her ask the guys questions.  Then she watched by camera how the guys reacted to her and Zac finally came through as the jerk he is.  To keep it short, she voted Zac and one of the new guys, I think he name was Mike, off.  Zac was not too happy about it because he thought he was the greatest.  So, to keep track, she has not taken two of the thee pretty boys off the show.  So it's down to Adam and the one last pretty boy standing.  I am rooting for Adam, he seems like a nicer guy and he has a similar sense of humor that I have.  And lastly, new news, I signed up for college and have been filling out financial aid.  I guess it's almost final, I am going back in January.  This is a good thing, I hope to get a degree in Information Technology(IT) and get a good job, finally.  Ok, until next time America, DAN

       HI!  You can just ignore that last post and the link to the site feed on the right.  Just for now.  It's something new that I'm trying to figure out.  I'll let you know when I do :)  Sorry it's been so long since my last real post I've been very busy with work and all.  Speaking of work, things are going really good.  This past Friday was my first day training in my new Dept.  I also trained yesterday.  Then today my trainer and another girl in the dept. said that they thought I was ready to be on my own today.  I did pretty good.  Not too many things I had questions on and I moved right along on my report.  I only got a few incoming calls so that helped too.  I think after this week I should be all set.  I like things so far.  I would like to say thank you to Bamboo2 for her very thoughtful gift on Friday.  She saw that I had Evanescence's CD on my wishlist so she got it for me.  Then she had a very nice note on the inside.  Now, this isn't why I put up my wishlist, but thank you very much!  It was very nice of you.  Ok, TTFN DAN

       Well, week 2 is over and week 3 is about to begin at my new job.  So far things are still going pretty good.  Another one of the trainees has left.  She quit then came back and is now going to be in Order Entry instead of Customer Service.  There is a lot of stuff to learn in a very short period of time.  So now we are down to two.  They wanted four.  I don't know if they are going to try to hire more after they are done training us or not, I guess we will see.  Also I'd just like to say how much I like the show Alias.  It is one of the best shows on TV.  I don't have time right now, but I will soon.  I just thought I'd throw it in right after I finished watching this weeks episode.

       Hello again,  Well, my job is going really good.  I've gotten 90%+ on all my tests.  The trainer told me today that she is really happy with how I'm catching on and taking in all the info.  Out of the three of us training, I'm the only one who hasn't had to retake a test.  The trainer talked to me about moving to the Pic/Freeze/Move section which would give me more to do and the person I was shadowing today said they were thinking about hiring one of us for over there.  It also means more money once they hire me from Express, the temp agency I'm with.  So hopefully things keep going well there.  (knock on wood)  The power went out tonight around 8pm.  It was 14 degrees F out, so we got a little worried that if it stayed out for long then we would have to go elsewhere because out furnace runs half on electricity.  But it was only out until 8:45pm so we were ok.  We only lost 2 degrees inside.  Not too bad.  This week has gone by very fast so far.  Oh one last thing.  I just thought I'd send you to my favorite Blog(other than mine that is).  It's, big surprise here,  urlLink Alton Brown's Blog .  He recently said that he was going to try to update it at least once a week, which is a good thing.  I like to hear what he has to say about the food industry, his show, and many other things.  Give it a look sometime.  Can I get a What, What!?! DAN

       Wow, it has been a long week.  There is a lot to learn at my new job.  I was planning to post after my first day on Monday but I was pretty tired then I had to study for a test that I was going to have on Wed.  Yes, that's right I had a test, and then I had another today too.  I have two weeks of training which includes classes and a 400+ page book to learn.  Plus, we have to take tests throughout and you have to get an 85% to pass.  I think once I get through the training period, I will like the job.  It is a lot to take in all at once but once I get it down it will come like second knowledge.  I get the whole weekend off this week and next so that's pretty good.  Get heavy on with digging your ditch. DAN

Now I can finally start paying my bills again and maybe even buy something at Applebees soon.  I should get to bed, I want to get a lot of sleep so I'm not tired at work tomorrow.  I'll fill you in on my first day tomorrow.  Work like you don't have to, love like you've never been hurt, and sing like your in the shower.  DAN

       WOW!  It's been a long time since I last posted.  I'm ashamed of myself for that.  I've been very busy with work and all.  Which, by the way, things are going very well.  This past Tuesday our Dept. moved to a new area of the office.  We now have a nice big window view and better air flow.  We aren't stuck in the corner any more.  We also have the new computers, new phones, new everything.  We are special ;P  I can't really complain about my job, things are going well, now I just hope they officially hire me once my 90 days are up.  Yesterday When I went to my weekly Friday night out I saw two of my good friends that I haven't seen in a long time.  The first I haven't seen or talked to for in upwards of over a year.  I worked with her at Wal-Mart in the layaway dept.    She helped train me and we became good friends.  We had a great time working together.  Then I moved to the Foods dept and we didn't get to work together much, and then I became CSM and I almost never got to talk to her.  Then, the killer, I left Wal-Mart for Red Lobster.  Well, she went out with everyone Yesterday so I got to chat with her and it was like it was back at Wal-Mart.  We were back to joking around and having fun.  The second I haven't really gotten to talk to since I left Red Lobster in Sept.  We had a good chat and plan on getting together Sunday to chat some more.  He's a good guy who if you show some respect, he will show you 10 times the respect back.  So I am very happy that I went out yesterday, I miss both of them, and I miss working with them.  I am glad we can get together once in a while though.  Ok, one last thing for tonight.  I have added two new features to my blog.  If you look at the end of every post you will see two new links.  The first, Comments, you can click on to make comments or read comments about that post.  If you want to make any comments about something I post that others can read then you can do it there.  The other is Linkback.  If you have a blog yourself or a website and you write a reference to my blog or something that relates to my blog or something I wrote about in my blog you can put it there.  Also if you see a webpage that you think is pertinent to something that I wrote about, even if it's not yours, you can put it there also.  If you want to know about these then you can go here:  urlLink www.haloscan.com  I would like to thank Haloscan for these free features which I hope will enhance my blog experience.  Ok, I've blabbed enough. DAN

       So it's been a long time since I last posted.  Sorry about that.  I have a lot to talk about but I just don't have the time right now.  Work keeps me going to bed early and when I get up in the morning I don't think about updating my Blog.  I will try my hardest to post more often though.  First off I want to say to all those who are upset about what happened during the half time show at the Super Bowl.  GET A LIFE, GET OVER YOURSELF!  Number one, the whole outfit wasn't supposed to come off, it was an accident.  Number two she had a pasty on her nipple so you couldn't see anything anyways.  Number three a couple of years ago Lil' Kim went on TV for an entire awards show with less on than that.  Then someone grabbed her.  I would think that is worse.  CBS cut away as fast as they could when they saw what happened.  When I saw it they cut away so fast that I couldn't tell if I saw what I thought I saw.   Plus you could tell that Janet was embarrassed she crouched over and covered herself up as quickly as she could.  Now stop talking about it, stop trying to sue anyone about it, and move on to something important.  Ed, on of my favorite TV shows is ending soon.  I found out last week that there are only two more episodes left.  What happened?  They moved it to Fridays to cancel it?  It doesn't make any sense.  I am not happy about this!  I bet you, at NBC,  $10 to bring Ed back.  (if you watched the show you will get that)  On to another of my favorite shows, Alias.  I got the season 2 complete season on DVD set the week before last.  I just got done watching it this past weekend.  It is just the best TV show on, well, TV.  It's like a top of the line movie every week.  Just as long as they dumb it down anymore than they have then I will never purposely miss an episode.  Every week I look forward to Sunday to watch the best night for Drama.  First on is 10-8, pretty good.  A good way to start the night.  Then, of course, Alias.  I can't say enough about this show.  And finally, The Practice.  Although they cut the budget of the show for this season and lost many of the stars of the show, they kept enough of the stars and didn't cut on the writing which makes the show.  It is the best 3 hours on TV bar none.  hehe get it, bar, hehe like in lawyers.....ahhh nevermind :P  Ok, you've heard enough from me tonight, "just 'cause things around you seem heavy, doesn't mean you can give up this ground." --Dave Matthews  DAN

       Alias was great this week.  Wasn't too dumbed down.  I couldn't believe that the blonde chick's Mom killed the Dad.  That was a surprise.  Then, for the first two seasons they built up Sloan so we hated him a lot.  Now they are building it up so we feel bad for him.  It was  a good episode.  The last scene hit a little close to home for me.  A slightly different situation but the same feelings.  Alias is one of the only shows ever that really brings out emotions in me.  I truly feel bad for characters when bad things happen and vise versa.  It has the best of many worlds.  Every episode is like a mini movie, it is a drama and brings out emotions, it has comedy, it has action and suspense, and a hot leading lady.  What could be better?  Another great show, the one I'm watching now, is The Practice.  It has some great writing and even though they got rid of a lot last year, it still has some great actors.  Only 4 more new shows until it ends.  It's too bad ABC had to cut it's budget so much.  I guess they are going to do a spin off of some sort.  David E. Kelly makes some great shows and if he does the spin off then I'm sure it will be good, and I will definitely watch it.  Ok, one last thing before I go.  I would just like to wish Bamboo2 a happy belated 22nd birthday.  It was this past Wed.  That's it for now, but please remember, "Tomorrow is no place to place your better days"  -- Dave Matthews  DAN

       So, I'm at work right now.  I'm on my lunch and I'd thought I would post that I passed my test!!  That means I will be hired in the coming weeks.  No more worrying if I will have a job next week or not.  I will probably get a raise once I get hired so that will be nice also.  I thought I passed, I just wasn't 100% sure.  Ok, I'm going to go read and relax, it is hot in here right now.  Werd Up DAN

       Ok, there's a lot to talk about today.  BTW, Hi, how are you today.  I hope I find you feeling healthy.  First off, Alias was great this week!  I was on the edge of my seat until I fell off at the end when it was a real cliffhanger just like at during the first and second season.  I have to admit I thought Sloan had reformed.  Boy was I wrong.  I can't wait until this weeks show.  Second,  I took the first part of my 90 days test on Monday.  It was all on the computer, mostly multiple choice with a few fill in the answer and one essay.  Then I took the second and third part yesterday.  The second part was all essay.  The third part showed some screen shots and I had to fill things in.  My boss came up to me today and said that I passed the first part and they have yet to score the second and third part.  I'm 97% sure I passed with flying colors so I will be hired soon.  That will be nice, to have some feeling of job security.  I will probably know for sure sometime this week.  Lastly I signed up to beta test Gmail.  It gives you 1GB of storage space for e-mail so you never have to delete e-mails if you don't want to.  It should be interesting to see if it makes it past beta.  Google is making a lot of noise with this service.  Ok, that's enough from me. Under the Table and Dreaming, DAN

       Wow, Alias was great tonight!  It had Jennifer kicking ass with two guns.  They tricked me into thinking that they killed off Sloan.  It had, what I thought, was the beginning of the end of the blonde chick.  This show was the best all season.  There were a couple of weak episodes this season, but I knew J.J. couldn't do that all season.  The twists keep coming, now Sydney has a sister fathered by Sloan.  Only three shows left this season.  I hope the show gets picked up for next season.  It was picked up by TNT for syndication and that includes up to 88 shows, so next season is almost in the bag.  And if a show goes 4 or more seasons then they usually can go even further.  The Practice, I'm saddened that the show will end this season.  They are planning a spin off and if David E. Kelly is involved then it should be good as well.  We'll have to see.  "I'll lean on you and you lean on me and we'll be okay." -- Dave Matthews  DAN

       So lets forget that I ever said that I would post every score for the Mets.  I just can't seem to do that.  I will post important games etc. just not every one.  I went to Erie today.  I got some nice clothes for work, cheap at Target.  I love that store, it's like Wal-Mart, but better.  I hope we get one in our area.  I got a coupon for Bed, Bath and Beyond this week in the mail for 20% off so I had to go there.  I almost got a 1 1/2 quart All-Clad sauce pan but then I noticed that the coupon said that it excluded All-Clad so I then went over to the Calphalon section and I found some nice pieces in the tri-ply area.  It has a layer of Aluminum sandwiched between two layers of Stainless Steel all the way throughout.  I ended up getting a 10" Stir Fry Pan.  The regular price was $40, but I got it for only $32.  A very good deal.  If I had gotten the same pan from All-Clad it would have cost over $100.  Same quality, same warranty (lifetime), You can't go wrong.  I can't wait to use it!  Ok, goodnight sweetheart it's time to go, DAN

       Ok, so I already missed a day.  I was busy playing with my computer.  Getting it up to date  etc.  So yesterday the Mets lost 18 - 10 to the Braves.  Not Good.  Then again the Mets Lost today 10 - 8 also to the Braves.  The Braves take the series 3 games to 1.  Well, at least they are high scoring games, so you can't say they are boring.  Ok, I'm off to bed, I get to work tomorrow.  DAN

       No Alias today, whatever am I to do?  Next week it is on an hour later, that's just no good.  I made fish and chips for dinner today and it came out pretty good.  I even surprised myself.  And yes I made the fish part from scratch.  I bought fresh Haddock at the store and I made a beer batter and fried the fish.  Yum!!  I guess I will find something to do, I ain't got much to talk about tonight, or at least right now, I'm tired :)  DAN  P.S.

       Ok, so when I got to work today, they told me that this will be my last week here.  I talked to Express and they don't have anything else for me right now.  They said they will be looking but now what am I supposed to do?  I can't afford not to have a  job!  Well, I guess I should get going and start work only 2 days left here I guess.  They didn't even say why, they just did, and since I'm a Temp.  They can do that.  DAN

       I am a little surprised that no one has left a single comment for me about the new design.  It's actually hard to tell if anyone has even been here since I've been hitting the site to look for comments.  Oh well, I guess I do this for myself.  I had to work today.  It wasn't so bad, it was really slow.  My dept. had a total of one call incoming today.  I got paid time and a half plus I get a day off paid next week.  Plus it rained most of the day today.  So I don't have anything to complain about.  I'm off to find something else to do.  DAN  P.S. to those who I went out with last night, in case you read this, I had a good time, we all should hang out more often.

       So I went for a walk today.  Boy do I need to do that more often.  I went to where I used to walk when I needed to think.  All I thought about this time was nature and outer space.  No, not inside my head! :P  I walked for over an hour and it felt really good.  The last time I walked I lost about 15 pounds so I want to try to do that again, I need to lose more than 15 pounds though.  If I start eating better and walking then I think I can do it.  I don't need no stinking low carb diet!  Alright, that's all for tonight  DAN

       Well, Season 3 of Alias has come to an end.  It sure was an action packed episode.  --If you haven't seen it yet and don't want to spoil it then don't read the rest of this post.--  First the commercials make you think that Sidney betrays the CIA, but in fact it was the blonde chick in disguise.  Later Vaughn goes to kill the blonde chick and he ends up getting stabbed in the back literally.  Then Sidney goes to get her for doing that to Vaughn and her Aunt almost kills her but Sidney out smarts her.  Sidney and the blonde chick get into a fight and Sidney almost gets killed but Vaughn saves the day and kills his wife.  I was kinda hoping the blonde chick would stick around for another season because you loved to hate her.  Plus she was very pretty.  But she's dead, or at least they are making us think she is.  They have done this before.  But when she was getting shot for the 14th and 15th times in the face and chest she tell Sydney to look for something.  Sydney goes into some sort of vault, she looks like she might be in an alias disguise and she looks at some black CIA papers that she has to look at with a black light.  They show some sort of project that involves her and it was undersigned by her Dad.  Somehow he is there and while she is balling he says that she was never supposed to see those papers.  And that is how they end season 3.  Now I left some stuff out because I am doing this a few hours after the fact and this is just supposed to be a summary, but it was a good show with a "what do they say" ending.  It really makes you anxious to see the first show of next season.  I really hope the show doesn't just end there.  That just wouldn't be good.  To all you other Alias fans out there, make sure you go out and buy the season 3 DVD set, out in September and make sure you watch come fall.  DAN

       A lot is changing with this Blog.  First off Blogger, the way this Blog gets to you, has revamped their look.  Second, I am seriously thinking about changing the look of the Blog since it only really looks good in Netscape.  I want something that will look good in both Netscape AND Internet Explorer.  So keep checking back for the new look and new features including some pictures maybe.  The Alias season 3 finale is on tonight.  The commercials make it look like it is going to be one Hell of a show.  I will post after the show to voice my opinion about it.  I haven't heard if ABC picked it up for a 4th season, but they better have.  Season 3, yes this one that ends tonight, will be out on DVD in September, just in time for season 4's start.  It will make a good birthday gift!  hehe  Alright, I'm off to change some things around here.  DAN

The Manager here asked if I wanted to work for PNG and be hired on as a permanent employee, and of course I said yes.  She handed me my employee handbook and told me I will fill out some paperwork tomorrow and my official start date will be 5/10/04.  Finally a job that I like, they seem to like me, and the pays pretty good.  Now if I can just get my personal life straightened out I'll be all good :)  Ok, it's lunch time so I am going to try to find something for lunch. Eat, Drink, and be merry! DAN

       Boy it was a long weekend.  I didn't go to the weekly Applebee's on Friday this week.  I didn't have any money because of the aforementioned brake change. Plus I had to work on Saturday morning.  Then on Saturday a few friends of mine were trying to get together to have a bon fire but one who said he was going to go said, when I called him on Saturday, said that he decided to make other plans.  So we went without him.  It was fun, and if anyone who was there reads this, yes I did have fun.  I'm not going to go into too much detail to save the innocent, or not so innocent, but I think everyone that went with me had fun as well.  I hope they did and my being there didn't bring them down.  It was a long night last night, that is for sure.  I didn't get home until 3:30am.  Then today my sister, brother-in-law, my father, and I went to dinner for fathers day.  It was in Warren and I'm not sure of the name of the restaurant.  It was very good.  I had lasagna per my sisters suggestion and it was a good one.  The portions were, to put it lightly, HUGE.  I ate about a third of it and I was stuffed.  Hey, lunch for work the next two days.  I don't know if my Dad reads this or not, but if you do, happy fathers day Dad.  Oh, and earlier I washed my car.  I really washed my car.  I used the Mr Clean car wash thingy and it works pretty good.  It does what it says it does.  Well, except on my windows, but that is my fault because I have rain X on them so they bead up no matter what.  Then I waxed my car.  I bought, what is in my opinion, the best wax you can buy.  I did the black trim.  I made the tires look like they are wet, even if they are not.  And I put more Rain X on the windows.  Rain X is the best thing for your windows of your car.  If you haven't used it in the past you have to try it.  Don't bother with the off brands, go for the real thing.  Now my car drives like new and looks like new.  IT IS SHINY!! :)  And now my Mom is going to drive it to Boston and back.  I'm not real happy about that but I am a nice guy so I am letting her drive it.  ONLY HER though.  I just hope that it comes back the way it will leave.  Well, on to another week of work. And remember, don't drink and drive. If you drink, don't drive. DD's - our modern heroes, saving lives.  I should know, I am one :)  DAN  UPDATE:  I just wanted to let you know that I have added the Rain-X website to my list of links on the right.  Also on the main page you can look up your car to see what size wiper blades it takes.  Even if you don't use Rain-X items, this can be a helpful tool.  Laters.

       I got a new grill today.  I bought a Weber charcoal grill.  I haven't used it yet but it looks pretty good.  The store that I bought it from said that assembly would cost $30!  I said no way and I put it together myself.  It took me a total of 8 min.  It was not hard at all and definitely not worth $30.  I also got my car inspected today.  I knew my brakes were bad, but I was hoping the car would pass anyway.  It did not, I needed new front pads and they had to resurface the rotors, the total for everything including a oil change was $207.  That took a very big chunk out of my paycheck.  Went to a steak cook out today with my Mom and her boyfriend.  It was stupid.  They started the grill just as everyone got there so everyone started putting their steak on (you had to cook your own, which I prefer) when the grill was still way too cool to cook right.  Then the steaks were still mostly frozen.  How about you thaw the steaks before you try cooking them?  So everyone cooked their steaks, which took way too long, they ate the steaks and barely talked and then just left.  Nothing else to do or anything.  Free steak is good, but kinda pointless.  It was cold too, but that was a surprise.  I rented Scary Movie 3 today and it was very funny.  The best one yet.  The little kid just couldn't keep safe.  If you haven't seen it yet, go and rent it.  So when I went up to check my e-mail etc online I turned on my TV Comedy Central and what comes on but none other than The South Park movie, bigger, longer, uncut.  Now, what surprised me was that it was still uncut.  EVERYTHING was left in.  All the swearing and crude language, all the cartoon nudity like the seen with Kenny going up to heaven and the Saddam seen.  I have to say that I was very surprised they actually played it on TV without a change.  I'm not complaining just surprised, especially after all the threats from the FCC for indecentcy.  Yes, I did watch the whole movie, I haven't seen it since I saw it in the theatre.  Ok, that's too much for one post.  Catch ya...  DAN

When I have some more time I will make some comments on some of the articles in  Scientific American  magazine.  There has been some interesting things in there and I would like to put my thoughts out there as well.  Other than that I don't really have much to say.  Things are still going well at work.

       We have a big show tonight so I'll get right into it.     First, the Dave Matthews Band concert that I went to last Tuesday. In as few words as possible, it was great! I want to talk about each song so I put it onto it's own page. I am running out of time so I will post the link tomorrow. Sorry for the wait.    Next, on Saturday I went over to a friends house from work and we played Pictionary. I had a really good time but I again learned that I can't draw worth beans. There was another co-worker there with her husband and I think we all had fun. I hope we can all get together again to do that.     Then on Sunday I saw  urlLink Spider-Man 2 . It was a great show. I think it was as good if not better than the first one. They focused more on the romance story line between Peter and MJ on this one, but they did not lack on great fight scenes. I don't want to give too much away but spidey fights Doc Octopus a few times and they are great fights. The story was really good, it kept me wondering what was coming next and it leads into the next installment. I, for one, cannot wait.     One of the local radio stations in the area is giving away round trip tickets, hotel room, and VIP tickets to see  urlLink Dave Matthews Band in San Fran  this September. I keep listening to see if I can try to win. That would be great to go to the other coast and see DMB. The radio station actually announced that they were giving away tickets to this show before the official DMB website announced the show. Kinda cool.     Ok, there will be another big post coming up because first this Friday I am going over to another friends house from work, and then on Saturday I am going to a graduation party. So I should have a lot to talk about.      "Nine planets round the sun  Only one does the sun embrace  Upon this watered one  So much we take for granted   So let us sleep outside tonight  Lay down in our mother's arms  For here we can rest safely "   --Dave Matthews Band - One Sweet World     DAN

       Think back, a few years ago, before anyone knew what the  urlLink West Nile Virus  was....~~Dream Sequence~~....People were trying to get that insect repellent off the market.  Why?  Because they were saying how unsafe Deet is.  They were telling us to use items that had the least amount of Deet possible....~~End Dream Sequence~~...Now, in a world afraid of West Nile, Deet is everyone's best friend.  You don't hear anyone saying anything bad about Deet.  Why?  Because it works so well to repel mosquitoes.  Even the Governments CDC website tells us to "use repellent with DEET when spending time outdoors."  Now, I'm not trying to say anything bad about Deet or downplay what the West Nile Virus could do, I'm just making an observation about how things can be changed.  Do I use Deet?  Yes, I do when I am outdoors where there are a lot of mosquitoes.  Do I feel it's safe?  I do when used properly.  Why believe me though, Here is what the CDC answers to whether it is safe or not:  "Yes, products containing DEET are very safe when used according to the directions. The regulation of substances such as DEET is determined by the  urlLink U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) . Because DEET is so widely used, a great deal of testing has been done. When manufacturers seek registration with the EPA, laboratory testing regarding both short-term and long-term health effects must be carried out. Over the long history of DEET use, very few confirmed incidents of toxic reactions to DEET have occurred when the product is used properly. To read more information about DEET safety see the National Pesticide Information Center [NPIC], EPA re-registration eligibility decision fact sheet ( urlLink npic.orst.edu/factsheets/DEETgen.pdf   ) and the  urlLink EPA Re-registration eligibility decision (R.E.D.) fact sheet ."  What is  urlLink Deet ?  Well, first off, Deet is N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide.    It is actually a product made by one company,  urlLink Morflex, Inc .  They make all the Deet you find in anything.  It was actually developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1946.  It is a very efficient and long lasting bug repellent.  Not just mosquitoes but many bugs.  When at the store pick your favorite product that contains Deet and then pick the highest concentration of it.  The more Deet, the longer it will last, and the less amount of times you will have to re-apply.  For more information about Deet, go to  urlLink www.deet.com , CDC Insect Repellent Use and Safety at  urlLink www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/insect_repellent.htm ,  and Deet Online at  urlLink www.deetonline.org   What is West Nile Virus?  Well, what everyone's afraid of is fatal encephalitis or inflammation of the brain.  That doesn't sound like fun to me.  Most people don't even show any symptoms of having West Nile though.  But if you do, try looking for things like fever, headache, body aches, and maybe swollen lymph glands.  For a full list go to CDC's Symptoms of West Nile Virus at  urlLink www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/symptoms.htm .  Most cases aren't all that serious but if you think you might have West Nile or what they call West Nile Fever then see your doctor as soon as possible and they will tell you what to do.  For more information about West Nile, go to the CDC West Nile Virus Homepage at  urlLink www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/ .    Now, I have just gone over a few of the major points about Deet and West Nile Virus.  Please check out the sites I listed or do a search yourself for more complete information.  Well, I guess we've seen the end of the war against Deet.  At least for now and while West Nile is still a threat.  DAN

       Ok, ok, so it's called Croquet.  I knew Polo was with horses and all, and aren't they similar?  I don't know.  If you click on the title of this post it will send you to a history of Croquet.  You'd be surprised how many sites there are about Croquet.  I thought, I'll find a quick website by going to  urlLink Google Search  and putting in Croquet.  WRONG.  There are a lot more than I thought.  It only found 579,000 pages.  only.  So, I had no idea how to play when I watched the first game but it didn't seem to hard and I picked up on it really quickly.  If you want the official rules, which by the way vary from country to country, then you can  urlLink click here .  People really take this game seriously.  They have tournaments and everything.  Now it was fun, and I might think about buying a Croquet set to play more often, but some take it too seriously.  You can see this at  urlLink Croquet World Online Magazine .  lesson Over, DAN

       Hello,  I hope everyone had a safe and happy Fourth of July weekend.  On Saturday my sister invited me over to the their house to see the fireworks that were at the Jammers game.  They were ok, a little short and a little plain but it was still fun.  I got to spend some time with my family while they were at least pretending not to hate me.  I meet, who I assume is, my Dad's girlfriend.  My sister told me earlier in the day that he had one but he didn't introduce her as such.  I was going to do the usual "nice to meet you, goodbye." etc but when she passed me she looked in the opposite direction and didn't say anything.  Oh well.  On Sunday I went over to my sisters husbands Mom's house and we ate chicken and played Polo, but without the horses.  Actually I think it was called something else but I don't remember what, all I remember was that I was not good at it.  It was, in my own defense, my first time playing though.  It was fun but ran a little long.  My Dad left early, well earlier than I did.  Well, gotta work.  DAN
