						   Just something I've been considering.&nbsp; A new view of mental processes, both conscious and subconscious.  As I was contemplating human nature, the subject of personality came up, and I began to wonder where the personality originates, what seperates the minds of the  homo sapiens  from lesser organisms?&nbsp; Delving into the development of organic's brains, it is obvious that the divisions in organisms is due mainly to the advances in cognitive capacity.&nbsp;  Homo sapiens &nbsp; have the greatest recorded cognitive capacity yet,&nbsp; possibly rivaled by dolphins yadda yadda, but the seperation through mental power is also fairly evident in lesser beings.&nbsp; Examining the changes through the processes of cranial evolution, you begin to see that instead of nerve nets and open systems in early or primitive organisms, we advance to nerve junctions, serving as processing centers for more advanced creatures. Moving up the list, there are defaulting occurences of increasing nerve junctions, leading to larger junctions, forming the primitive brain structure, which slowly replaces the nerve junctions as the processing center for the organism.&nbsp; The brain also seems to increase with evolution, as evident of the differences between such examples as  homo habilus  and  homo erectus.&nbsp;  Considering that the advancing brain is the difference between the human species and lower animals, while holding in mind the minor differences in other physical aspects,&nbsp;we isolate the development and continuance of personality as a product of the brain.&nbsp; Now on to my personal considerations.&nbsp;   Considering the source of personality, the brain, and our knowledge of the origin of the brain - nerve junctions and ultimately the basic nerve - we can examine a simple nerve structure in simile of the brain.&nbsp; A nerve functions through simple chemistry, using enzymes and substrates to catalyze a simple equalizing reaction across a nerve membrane, creating the action potential that becomes a nerve impulse, and denotes a recieving of outside information or reaction to said information.&nbsp; A brain is merely a complex web of such nerves, and as such, we determine that the functioning of the brain is embodied by chemistry.&nbsp; Hence, personality is determined by chemistry of the brain.  This raises a few interesting points.&nbsp; Can the personality of a person be changed by adding certain chemical sequences into the nerve net, to create certain changes in the workings of nerves?&nbsp; Modern pharmacutecals point to yes, considering drugs that claim to eliminate depression, or fight ADD.&nbsp; If this is feasible, is it not possible to create adverse effects on the human persona with chemical measures?  On a lesser note, it is worth considering that the personality is most examined during developmental stages.&nbsp; The environment of the developer is often considered the major effector of certain personality traits, but I would proffer another idea.&nbsp; Genetics and heredity could play a prominent role in developing personalities.&nbsp; Considering minute differences in genes affecting the development of the brain, and the massive amount of different genes in the human gene pool, there are a great number of possible combinations that could change the way a person conceives things.&nbsp; The way  I  view&nbsp; something may not mean  you  view it the same way.&nbsp; Environment plays a secondary role changing the person's view of the world after they have inherently&nbsp; been affected by genetics.&nbsp; I have applied arbitrary terms to the way each factor acting on the personality can be viewed, but bear in mind the postulation that my previous quavery conditions are true.&nbsp; Genetic variables I labeled Limiting Factors, because they do not change the way you perceive something, but instead limit the number of ways you can view something.&nbsp; Environmental factors and experiences are loosely labeled Adjusting Factors, because they do not limit the number of&nbsp;ways you  can perceive&nbsp; something, &nbsp; but rather warp or change the way you percieve something.&nbsp; Without in depth consideration, I've found few other Limiting Factors, although&nbsp;I did address the occurence of direct physical injury to the brain, physically limiting it's function and hence possibly affecting personality.  With science advancing by leaps and bounds, we are already able to exert a small amount of control over the human genome, and with time may be able to fully control the genes of our offspring.&nbsp; With our current adequate knowledge of chemistry and the easily controlled factor of environment, what's stopping us from creating any personality that touches our fancy?&nbsp; With an excluded environment,  normal &nbsp; could truly be skewed when viewed in contrast with traditional values.&nbsp; It raises some interesting considerations for us all.  &nbsp;

						   Well, I'm resigned to the fact that idiocy is running rampant in the world.&nbsp; It's evident in everyday life.&nbsp; There are millions of instances to be viewed everday.&nbsp; My thoughts were sparked as I watched television this morning.&nbsp; A commercial for a speed reading program that can supposedly increase my reading speed to a level allowing me to finish reading the daily paper in one sitting created a doubt in my mind of my iminent reading prowess when they stated that with the purchase of the training program is included an ILLUSTRATED classic, Orson G. Wells' "The Time Machine".&nbsp; Such an apt choice for the new readers joining the ranks of the speed literates.&nbsp; Maybe their computer training can allow them to speed peruse the pictures.&nbsp; I'm sure they'll be of the highest quality and detail to challenge the advanced minds of today's speed readers.&nbsp; Or at least those that decided it would be a good idea to learn to read from a television commercial.&nbsp; And that's not the only stupid problem " Eye Q" made in their product.&nbsp; They made a literature library on the computer, so you can read at your leisure while promoting cancer of the eye and causing unexpected spurts of blood from your eyesockets as you attempt to finish a modicum of text with your new training.  What the CRAP people?!

						        This idea has been bothering me for a while now.  I've noticed that the human race as a whole has a tendency to reminisce over our worst moments, or times in history filled with death or failings as a people.  Is not World War II considered the most devastating war in the history of the world? And yet it is one of the most documented and reused scenario in television and radio interests.  The airwaves are swarmed by specials or documentaries, new findings in our continous evaluation of the war.        Our fascination with WWII is merely a taste of the total interest placed upon warfare around the world, with many organizations living off of it like some foul parasite, or even incorporating it as one of their central concepts, such as the Shi'ite muslim belief in Jihaad to punish the heathenous nations of the world.       Not only are we obsessed with war, we are determined as a people to relive past trials and travesties of humanity.  One prominent example is the constant subject of the Holocaust, not in the least lessened by the guilt-mongering of the Jews. How about America's fascination with the 9/11 attacks?  It's often the center of conversation years later, as more and more worldwide strife spring from the diseased and withered loins.      So we find that not only our civil governments are run by this macabre drive, but so are a great lot of our religious institutions.  The grand majority of churches in the world base themselves on the shunning and torture of a heavenly figure in the depths of history, or the trials they faced as a group at their formation, and take great pride in their noble heritage.      The human race must hope to gain some sort of knowledge or wisdom from reliving the tragedies of the past, but it strikes me as just a way of perpetuating outmoded ideas or views.  And to those who say, "Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it," We haven't done such a great job of escaping these trends, despite the constant shadow of the past.

						   If you don't like my views, you can go suck it.  This blog is my means to let the crazy out, not cater to the interests of every minority or moron attempting to defend a point they are totally incapable of comprehending.  That said, I'll have a treatise on the world's tendency to wallow in it's own past mistakes or trials like some self-ascetic teenager up later on.

						   Just a thought on the breadth of existence(In mathematical proof form):  1.  Identical twins are identical in all but experience (Genetic Fact) 2. Identical twins become seperate and different entities at birth, or rather the first moment of consciousness for each unit, when the personal experiences of each changes them due to the infinite and minute possible differences. 3. Considering point 2, we can determine that genetic identicals are different consciousnesses based on differing experiences. 4. Following the path of time, using basic units as a measure, and genetic makeup/current experience as variables, with the evaluation of one entity, it is discovered that at each point in time exists a different individual, considering that an individual is made up of his body and personality influenced by experience. 5. Hence, each conscious being is a collection of seperate entities replacing one another along a temporal path.  Just makes you think.
