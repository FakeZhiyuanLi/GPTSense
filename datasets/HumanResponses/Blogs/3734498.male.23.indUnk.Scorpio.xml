      I know there were alot of spelling and Grammar errors in my last post and I only mildly apologize about that...I like the freedom of writing for the shear need/want/complusion to and the freedom that goes with it; the freedom to 'experiment' with spelling and Grammar however accidental those experiments might be. I actually tried to edit the spelling of Damascus but gave up when it wasn't apparent how to.^-^  Now back to the topic; Damascus Gate and Beleif systems.   I've read more of the book and am becoming now informed about the nature of the situation in Israel, which is, in part, what I intended to do by picking up the book in the first place. Good job Nick I'd say. Let's reveiw:  The book, from where my description left it, had the main topic swirling about a religious cult and the Western, half Jewish writer's plight to find faith and to help keep his love interest, the young, now somewhat communist leaning, sufi woman singer out of religious dark waters. That's still there but the book kind of plateaued that subject matter ("that subject matter" referring to the religious philosophy I was so sure was to pour forth, the remaining chapters coming) and is now spiraling downward into the political activity and mis-adventure (a harsher term necesary there) that follow the kind of religious "enthusiasm" rampant in Israel...apparently of course...  So there are now presented therein; Corrupt, self-interested IDF (Israely Defense Forces), Palastinian jew killing peasants, Weird junkyard theiving Gypsies, Fanatical clandestine Boxer glovge wearing fanatic Israeli Jew interogators, caniving cultists inleague with radical Messianics, High Christian Evangelicals and well...The young write Lucas, confused, in the middle of it and witness. A political twist.  Now that that's said I will finish the book soon and will then have a better context for all the happenings until then I will of course ruminate on what has been brought to my attention....  Now for the beleif system idealogue:  I'm almost wrote out for the night I must say after not sleeping much the previous day but a special mention goes to me, looking up Jung though Google on the interest re-wrought in me in the 'following'from the Doctor Oberman character and the first link is to a nice looking page on Jung and Jungian philosophy which also has a news article on a documentary into the Casteneda cult, where my early THC invested mind was spent...a subject most close to my heart and still relavant to the founding of my "take on events"; my beliefs, which I was and am to espouse in great and elicit detail herein this many extended editorial.  First off: All is energy and matter  A simple statement too non-specificto mean much to casual consideration but through work and introspection I will refine it's meaning...for the vague declaration does intend meaning.  All is Energy and matter is meant to strip the world of uncertainty and intend's to provide the foundation for belief...in something; very important 'something', literlly meaning anything and everything...Hmm...more clear let's start again.  It seems to me that to explain the world and everything we know within it requires a basis for examination. It seems to me that logic and is and an be a universally agreeable and nearly indisputable way to come about a real and true understanding of the nature of things. Imagination is important but without a base in logic and reason how can we all agree on the very thing we wish to find agreeable.  A bit too lavish? Let me go get a drink and a bit more comfortable....  Now back the point. Let me say that I now see my developing philosophy and understanding throug many representing points come to through mundane and somtimes not so mundane revealation. One of those first is the fundamental of logic and reason as I had begun to mention. I beleive those conceptws to be infaliable in so far as the effor to maintain them is genuine. Another point, which will lead me out into a clearer concept of just how to make a framework for the belief structure I am attempting to present, is that of the tree falling in forest factor or more simply the unknowable. The very fact of the unknowable along with the relative infaliable nature of logic and reason bring me to my divine conclusion that nature is ultimately knowable in so fa as we have power to reason and the boundaries of which are unknowable.  I still derive confortably the imagary in Dr. Casteneda's description of the Human 'energy' structure and it's mechanics. I have not had the occasion to envison a more appealing explanation for our perceived reality in tune with the supposed other modes of perception reported by many over recorded time. A pretty mental image, an observation, a model of a pre-disposed perception. A pre-disposed predeliction for reason within our collective species and the possibility of manipulating, or rather allowing a world outside of 'reason' to become a formative reality. For me the concept itself is a reasonable and believable explanation for the formation of everything (to an extent)...those aren't too easy to come by for my mind.  All is Peception:  You see, if I am to have a 'religion' it must be based in indisputable unbiased fact for me to be able to believe in it. I'd feel silly otherwise. So the First precept of my belief system looks to be all is perception. I 've to that fact simply becasue no one can possibly hope to dispute me so, in effect, I win; and baby, that's what I've been sent here to do...It feels that way sometimes anyhow...  Brain chemistry is a fascinating subject.  So soon.

      Ok this weeks editorial focuses on my current, ongoing, reading of The Robert Stone Novel Damascus Gate and the issues it brings up. I'm about halfway through the book atm but I'm really feeling the force behind it at this point and I would like to get some of my ideas down on 'paper'.  The basic premise of the book starts out with a guy, a relatively young guy, who goes to Israel to write a book. After some deliberation with his Arabic contact in a cafe he decides his book's topic will be about 'Majnoon'. Majnoon are what the locals call religious fanatics.  The varying factions and dynamics Mr. Stone sets up for us is great; compelling, introspective at times and 'on the surface' logic at other times.  Lucas, the writer/main character, is a half Jewish ex-catholic raised by his mom in Harlem, near Columbia Uni in New york. His Father, Carl Lucas, is a famous professor at Columbia who has another wife.  Lucas makes a deal for a collabrative effort on his book about what a good, Jungian, Doctor Oden, his newly found co-author, calls 'The Juruselum Syndrome'. Religious enthusiasm in the Jeruselum peninsula.  Through his efforts Lucas encounters a number of individuals from greatly varying, but ultimately converging, religious/social/political faiths and backgrounds. He falls in love with a Sufi convert human aid worker who happens to fall in with an ex-drug addict musiccian who happens to discover a very wealthy, faith shaken, elderly southern gentleman who happens to somehow end up thinking himself the next messiah....  The Cult that forms integrates ideas of Torah and ties in mystical Kaballah and kundalini yoga and all is one philosophy into a Jeruselum 'rock- star/street tele-vangelist' movement and...it's passionate and insights my passion for involvement in transcendental concepts.  That's as far I've gotten in the book so far but the inspiration imparted to me through my reading it has propted me to finally begin taking up a serious outlining of my belief structure, thus allowing analyzation of my concepts and a refing of specifics therein. I'm excited about it. I've been having ideas and feeeling and insights brewing in me ever since I took on the task of self analyztaion and it's about time to write up a good report on what I've forund so far.  Look for more on this in the next few weeks...
