      I was doing some reading online during my free time at work and came across some stuff about christian dating. I would like to find out what people think about something so I am putting a question at the end of this post. Please provide your input (this will be a good guage to test who actually reads this, if anyone). This question is just something of curiosity on my part (nothing more, nothing less please don't read into it anymore. I've thought about it before in the past and wanted to know what others think). Here's the question:  Do you think there is only one person for everyone out there that they are supposed to end up with? or are there many that could fit?

      Have you ever been in one of those positions in life right before things are changing?&nbsp; One of the moments when you can't go back to how things were, but you aren't to where things are going yet.&nbsp; Probably the best label is that it is a transitional phase.&nbsp; That's where I am right now.&nbsp; It's a time when in feels like everything is up in the air.&nbsp; I don't me just one or two things, but  everything .&nbsp; It is a change in focus, a shift in what is important, and a time of confusion.&nbsp; I have very little clarity right now, I'm not entirely sure what is going on.&nbsp;   I am at somewhat of a crossroad in my life.&nbsp; Things have to change and God has made that clear.&nbsp; While many things are unclear, the things that I know for sure are that some things will stay the same, some things will change, some things will go, and some things will be added.&nbsp; There is a lot of figuring out to do.&nbsp; I intentionally use the phrase "figuring out" rather that deciding for a reason.&nbsp; To me, decisions are things that happen in a moment.&nbsp; On the other hand, figuring out is something that happens over the course of doing something.&nbsp; If I were to say that I am deciding, it would seem to me that it is like laying out everything in my life before God and saying, "okay, what do you want done with all of this stuff".&nbsp; Rather, it is more of beginning to move and examining things along the way.&nbsp;   To clarify things for anyone who might be reading this, let me say what change it is that is going on.&nbsp; I was thinking about this today and the conclusion I&nbsp;came to was this, I am at a point in my life with God where it must no longer be  walking with God in mind  and it must become  walking with God .&nbsp; As I see it, what is going to happen in the very near future is that I will continue to go about my life, but with a more intent focus.&nbsp; In  every  aspect of my life, I will be looking at it in relation to how it affects my life with God.&nbsp; Those things that are holding it back, keeping me from doing the work of glorifying Him, will either have to change or if that isn't possible, be cut out of my life.&nbsp; It is a difficult thing to face up to.&nbsp; There are a lot of things that I have become very comfortable with in my life and to face the possibility of that change is difficult.&nbsp;   The verses that I posted earlier are a great encouragement to me right now.&nbsp; I am in a position right now where things really aren't that easy and I really don't know what is going on.&nbsp; The only thing that I can do is trust God and His promises (see verses in last post) and take my rest in His almighty power.&nbsp; I was reminded of Job earlier today, he spent a lot of time being mad at God and questioning Him.&nbsp; But in the end of the book of Job, God basically told Job, "listen, I'm God, you're not.&nbsp; Trust what I'm doing".&nbsp; HE is the Almighty one who created the universe.&nbsp; HE is the All-Knowing, All-Powerful, All-Seeing being here, not me.&nbsp; It would be rather conceited and prideful (and really,  really  stupid) for me to think that I know how to do my life better than He does.&nbsp; I will put my trust in Him and obey to His commands through all of this.&nbsp;   Despite the uncertainty and difficulty in my life, I feel God's prescense more than ever.&nbsp; I know that He is doing something cool.&nbsp; The last 2 years have been amazing, but there is still room for so much more.&nbsp; It's time to take that next step and stop hiding.&nbsp; I am scared, excited, happy, and sad all at the same time.&nbsp;   I hope all of this made sense, it did when it was in my head.

      Psalm 42:11  "Why are you downcast, O my soul?  &nbsp;Why so disturbed within me?  &nbsp;Put your hope in God,  &nbsp;for I will yet praise him,  &nbsp;my Savior and my God."   Psalm 55:22-23  "22 Cast your cares on the LORD  &nbsp;and he will sustain you;  &nbsp;he will never let the righteous fall.  23 But you, O God, will bring down the wicked  into the pit of corruption;  bloodthirsty and deceitful men  will not live out half their days.  But as for me, I trust in you."   Philippians 4:6-7  "6 Do not be anxious about anything,  &nbsp;but in everything, by prayer and petition,  &nbsp;present your requests to God.  7 And the peace of God,  &nbsp;which transcends all understanding,  &nbsp;will guard you hearts and your minds  &nbsp;in Christ Jesus."   Jeremiah 29:11-13  "11 For I know the plans I have for you,"  &nbsp;declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you,  &nbsp;plans to give you hope and a future.  12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me,  &nbsp;and I will listen to you.  13 You will seek me and find me  &nbsp;when you seek me with all your heart."

      A couple of things right off the bat.&nbsp; First, I'm really into blogging right now.&nbsp; Mainly because I got a couple of comments that verified that I have more than 3 people reading this.&nbsp; I enjoy when I get comments and feedback as to what I am saying.&nbsp; It just makes me feel all warm and squishy inside (awww...).&nbsp; Second, I am really awake right now.&nbsp; I was a walking zombie earlier this morning, so I went and got a can of carbonated water with&nbsp;lots of sugar and&nbsp;caffeine&nbsp;(Mountain Dew).&nbsp; I think I am almost to the point that I am shaking.&nbsp;   In my heightened state of energy, I realized what one of the big problems I had the last couple days was, exhaustion.&nbsp; I spent all of last week looking after 6 sophomore boys who had much more energy than me, sleeping 5 or fewer hours a night, and not having down time.&nbsp; That tends to take its toll on your body.&nbsp; I still don't think I have recovered from that and the result was a mind that became susceptible to random thoughts and attacks from the devil (he's bad).&nbsp; While I don't like to use caffeine, it has awakened me to some of the faults in my thinking over the past week.&nbsp; Things are much clearer now and I feel a lot better about where things are.&nbsp;   Last night was a really good night.&nbsp; We had small group and were talking on the subject of prayer and how we hear God (at least that's what I got).&nbsp;  urlLink Tim  brought up the point that many times when attempting to hear from God, we wait for a "divine bolt of lightning" that will tell us what to do and until we get that, we don't move.&nbsp; That's a lot of what I have been doing lately.&nbsp; One of the things that I got out of last night that the best way to really get in tune with what God is saying to you is to walk with Him.&nbsp; When you take the time to read in His Word, pray, and obey the commands He has given us, you begin to hear Him more clearly in our lives.&nbsp; I think back to an analogy that I heard at the Ignite conference in January.&nbsp; To paraphrase what was said "you can't steer a car until it is moving".&nbsp; The way that I look at it is like this: If I begin to act, God will make clear whether that is something I should be doing or I shouldn't be doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least that is the way that I see it.&nbsp;   Another thing that really struck me last night was something  urlLink jimi  said.&nbsp; I might butcher this, but the way I remember it was we tend to "obey God with a backup plan".&nbsp; I know there have been many times that I have come before God wanting to hear from Him while already deciding what I am going to do.&nbsp; I think that we tend to give God options to choose from.&nbsp; It's like saying "God I will obey you, but only if you tell me to do one of these two things".&nbsp; I think that might be the wrong way to approach God.&nbsp; Maybe we should trust Him in the moment and know that as we walk with Him, things will work out better than we could ever imagine.&nbsp; The really cool thing about our God is that He loves unconditionally and won't take that away from us.&nbsp; So maybe we make a wrong decision, it happens to everyone no matter how devout we are.&nbsp; We are all human and are bound to make mistakes.&nbsp; But in walking with God and being in communion with Him, we can eliminate many of the problems.&nbsp; He will forgive.&nbsp; He will love.&nbsp; He will complete the work He began in each and everyone of us.&nbsp; Check out  urlLink Rom. 8:28  and  urlLink Ps. 138:8 .&nbsp; He is faithful and will fulfill all of the promises that He has made.

      An actual church sign I saw on my way home last night,   "Attend church weekly....not weakly."  Honestly, would this draw people into the church?&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well, I'm back from HSLT.&nbsp; What an incredible week (I'm running out of descriptive words, I've used incredible, awesome, amazing, encouraging, etc. way too much in the last week.&nbsp; I'm open to suggestions as to alternatives.).&nbsp; I went into the week with really no expectations, having not thought about it much prior to leaving.&nbsp; I was just worried about certain things.&nbsp; Such as, driving a 15 passenger van 13 hours there and back without falling asleep, being able to connect with the guys in my room, not going insane, holding back God's work, and in general, could I pull it off.&nbsp;   One of the things that had me concerned was that I had a room of 6 sophomore boys by myself.&nbsp; Most other rooms either had another leader or the ones that didn't had more mature students.&nbsp; After going through the week, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.&nbsp; Granted, I got about 5 hours of sleep at most a night, spent a lot of time acting like a parent, and never took the chances I had to take a break, but it was worth it.&nbsp; For most of the last year, I hid behind the other leaders.&nbsp; I didn't have to step up because there was always someone else around to take care of things.&nbsp; Having a room to myself kept that from being the case.&nbsp; There was no other person there, I had to take charge and do what needed to be done.&nbsp; And since I really didn't know what to do, I had to rely on God.&nbsp; Funny how He works things out isn't it.&nbsp;   I had 3 of the boys in my room in small group this year.&nbsp; Small group was a disappointment this year.&nbsp; I felt like we went nowhere, so my expectations of how tie-downs (the small group type thing we did every night) would go was rather pessimistic.&nbsp; The guys blew me away.&nbsp; They were so willing to share and go deeper than just surface level.&nbsp; A couple of them stepped up and really kept the other on topic and in line with where we were going.&nbsp; We got into personnel issues and they were truly excited to dive deeper into things.&nbsp; Living with them for a week and spending time with them one-on-one really allowed me to see where they are in their walk with God.&nbsp; I have to say that I grossly underestimated where they are.&nbsp; They are 6 boys who are chasing after God and have a heart for Him.&nbsp; The same goes with many of the other students that were there, it was an encouragement to see just how on fire they are for God.&nbsp;   Coming into HSLT, I was ready to give up on the high school ministry and move to something different.&nbsp; I was really down on my ability to do it and was bitter about some things that happened during the course of the last year.&nbsp; HSLT changed that.&nbsp; I realized that one of the problems was that I was trying to rely on my own abilities rather than God's.&nbsp; When that couldn't happen this week, it changed everything.&nbsp; I energized for the next year and feel like I can confirm that this is where God wants me right now.&nbsp;   All in all, the week turned out well.&nbsp; I got to baptize one of the guys in my room.&nbsp; Worshiped God a ton, heard some great teachings, and was able to be a servant.&nbsp; I learned a lot about myself and began to see that I need to take another step in my faith.&nbsp; God really convicted me about my ability to talk, but not act.&nbsp; It's about time for me to beginning to put legs on my faith and take it out into the world more.&nbsp;   Coming home was nice (especially to sleep in a bed that fits), but it has been a time of roller coaster emotions.&nbsp; I really can't go into things, it is no where near appropriate to share on here what has been going on since I have come home.&nbsp; Just suffice it to say, God did some digging in me this week and it is going to take some time to get it worked out.&nbsp; So far it has been pretty painful and I don't know what is going to happen.&nbsp; I just know that God is in this and I have been trying to seek out where He is.&nbsp; It is finally time for me to obey God and face up to some things.&nbsp; There is no hiding from them anymore.&nbsp; I have to do this no matter how much time it takes to resolve.&nbsp; I'm just afraid that I won't make the decision that God wants me to.&nbsp; That terrifies me.&nbsp; To know that I can make one decision that could change the course of my life forever, and that it could be the wrong one.&nbsp; So for anyone who actually reads this and made it all the way down here, please pray.&nbsp; Pray that I hear from God.&nbsp; I'm waiting to hear from Him as to what the next step is and I need wisdom from Him.&nbsp; Meanwhile, my prayer is this:   "23 Search me, O God, and know my heart;  &nbsp;test me and know my anxious thoughts.  24 See if there is any offensive way in me,  and lead me in the way everlasting. "  ~Psalm 139

      Wow was I bored this morning.  I had about 45 minutes of free time this morning (even though I got here late due to traffic on Sunbury Rd.).  Basically the only way to fill that time is to surf the internet.    There are generally two different ways that work goes.  First, the more common, is the one I experienced this morning.  As a result of the way my job is structured, there is generally a space of free time in the afternoon (sometimes it will be an hour or more).  I don't mind it all the time, some days I just have no desire to work.  Most days though, the boredom is more than I can handle.  This morning, I was actually so bored that it was almost painful.  I almost started slamming my head against my desk to ease the pain.    The other condition is insanely busy.  These days happen in the first week of each month and usually result in me being cranky.  On days like these I long for days that I have nothing to do.  The real problem when I am really busy is that I am not busy doing work that is anywhere near interesting.  I would generally categorize it as busy work that is so tedious and stupid that I end up wanting to throw my computer through a window.    You see the problem is that I don't like either way things go and a happy medium wouldn't make things any better.  I would prefer to have something to do all day as long as it is something with substance.  Not stuff that involves printing off reports and checking things off.  I am a glorified data entry person and quite frankly, I am running out of ways to occupy myself at work.    I know this sounds like a lot of complaining, but I have exaggerated some.  I am not an unhappy person and I do enjoy the people I work with.  I have a cool supervisor that I can joke around with.  I just would like to have a job where there is something to do to make the day go by faster.  That would help a lot.

      One of the awesome things about living with 3 other guys is that when you need someone to pray for you, there is normally someone there.  The accountability that comes along with this is also an huge perk.  I've been living where I am for almost 3 months and I have been challenged to continue seeking after God in so many ways just from being around my roommates.  Over the last week, one of my roommates was able to illustrate just how important it is to pray for each other when we need it.  I don't mean in your own private time, but together in the same room out loud.  The healing that comes from confessing your sins to another person and then being able to take it to God with someone else is amazing.  Props to my roomies.    I was reminded of part of a psalm last night that was always a part of the Lutheran Service.  After doing it every Sunday for years, I had it memorized and ended up just mindlessly spitting out the words.  Last night as I read it, I noticed that it is a pretty cool psalm.    "1 Have mercy on me, O God,  according to your unfailing love;  according to your great compassion  blot out my transgressions.  2 Wash away all my iniquity  and cleanse me from my sin.   3 For I know my transgressions,  and my sin is always before me.  4 Against you, you only, have I sinned  and done what is evil in your sight,  so that you are proved right when you speak  and justified when you judge.  5 Surely I was sinful at birth,  sinful from the time my mother conceived me.  6 Surely you desire truth in the inner parts [1] ;  you teach [2] me wisdom in the inmost place.   7 Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;  wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.  8 Let me hear joy and gladness;  let the bones you have crushed rejoice.  9 Hide your face from my sins  and blot out all my iniquity.   10 Create in me a pure heart, O God,  and renew a steadfast spirit within me.  11 Do not cast me from your presence  or take your Holy Spirit from me.  12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation  and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.  13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways,  and sinners will turn back to you.  14 Save me from bloodguilt, O God,  the God who saves me,  and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.  15 O Lord, open my lips,  and my mouth will declare your praise.  16 You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it;  you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.  17 The sacrifices of God are [3] a broken spirit;  a broken and contrite heart,  O God, you will not despise.   18 In your good pleasure make Zion prosper;  build up the walls of Jerusalem.  19 Then there will be righteous sacrifices,  whole burnt offerings to delight you;  then bulls will be offered on your altar"

      So I went for a run tonight and I am thoroughly exhausted right now.  I barely have the energy to type.  It has been a few months since I have run, but I figured I could have at least jogged a couple of miles.  But no, I had to walk a couple of times (the feelings that I was going to throw up didn't help) and I was a wreck from the beginning.  My legs began to hurt by the time I reached the end of the street and I just couldn't muster any motivation or energy.  I really need to get in shape.   I mention the run because once I made it back to my neighborhood, I walked around a little bit to cool down.  It felt weird.  I've been living here for over 2 months and I drive in and out of here everyday.  Yet it still seemed so foreign to me.  I know it was because I am normally traveling much faster (in the car), but I was taken aback by the infamiliarity of the neighborhood.  The houses looked different, the road was longer, and I just felt plain out of place.  It is amazing how a different circumstance can completely change the way something appears.  I should walk around here more.  Maybe meet some more neighbors.  Sounds like a novel idea, will I do it?

      For some reason in the car tonight I was thinking about lists.  You will never see me make a list here about anything.  Let me clarify, I will never see a ranking.  Lists are okay, I just won't touch rankings.    That doesn't mean that rankings are bad, it's just that I won't do them.  There is too much potential for bad things to happen and I just don't want to deal with that.  There are very few rankings that are not a matter of opinion or preference.  No matter how much objectivity is supposedly involved, it will never be devoid of opinion.  Rankings create conversation and too many times it can result in conflict.  A lot of that can be chalked up to the fact that most lists are compiled about things we are passionate about, music, movies, sports, etc.  The relate to subjects that are related to opinions that are deeply rooted within us and are a matter of personal taste.  When someone hits on one of those nerves, watch out.    Take for example, music.  Probably the one thing in the world that it is almost impossible to be impartial about.  There will always be a manner of what each person likes best.  I will never tell anyone that one band is better than another, only that I personally may like one better than another.  It is all a matter of who is speaking and what or who that person likes.  I will never pay attention to rankings of the best songs or best bands of all time.  To illustrate, one of the bands that most people consider one of the top couple of bands of all time, The Rolling Stones, I absolutely can't stand.  I don't understand why people like them.  But that does not take away from the fact that they might be a good band, I just don't like them.    With all of that said, I guess what I am getting at is that you must be careful when you hit the subject of what people like.  Some of these things people are incredibly passionate about.  By insulting or degrading their band or favorite team, you are in essence insulting them.  Especially with music, which is something that touches people in ways that few other things can.  I will never again argue with someone about whether a movie is good, a band is good, or anything else that brings preferences into play.  I will only state my opinion and try to understand theirs.

      For anyone who doubts how much my job is like Office Space, I present this evidence.  Someone just sent out an email that they were missing a big stapler!  They're taking the staplers!  I'm not giving up my Swingline.  (Just to make myself more pathetic, Milton was right the Swingline really doesn't bind up as much.  My old (non-Swingline) stapler broke within a month)   Props to my fellow laborer at Bisys, Lisa, for pointing this out.

      I had the day off from work today.  After the week I had last week, I really needed it.  I slept it, laid around, went to the thrift store, played nintendo (the original), and watched  Big Fish .  It is easily one of my favorite movies, it is a beautiful movie that stirs my emotions.    The movie centered on the relationship between a dying father and his son.  I'm not going to say much, I don't want to take anything away from people who may not have seen it yet, but I'm not sure if what I will write will spoil anything, so you may not want to read if you haven't seen it (I highly recommend it, go rent it).  The one theme that seemed to jump out at me centered around communication methods.  The father was a story-teller and the son was a fact-based guy.  Because of this difference, they really didn't communicate at all.  Neither was willing to adjust to the other.  The son felt like he didn't know his father because he never heard facts.  But it is in the stories that he could learn about his father, in fact the stories are who his father is.  They revealed so much about his character and who he is.  But the son was so caught up in the differences that he never looked or listened hard enough to see the facts.    I realized recently just how powerful stories are.  I spent so much time looking for facts and advice and the quick fixes, that I missed a good chunck of the Bible.  As I read more, I find just how many stories there are.  Rather than looking for nice sound bites that I can take and memorize, there are so many lessons that can be learned from looking at the stories of the figures of the Bible.  To see how they practiced their faith, how the struggled, how they triumphed, and how they trusted God is an amazing way to learn how to do this life.  The people in the Bible were no different than we are, yet we feel like we can't relate.  There is so much that can be extracted from the stories of God and his people that it's unbelieveable.  It is in these stories that we can see a picture of who God is and get a glimpse of His character.  Can I continue to be like the son in  Big Fish  and only chase after facts or can I look to the stories as well?

      I'm gonna see how this works, I don't really like blurty.  I think that this might be above my computer experience though.  I'll do a post and see what turns up.    This morning, Pastor Brian spoke about "Completeness in Christ".  The way he worded his points was as personal points.  The first was one that I have dealt with in the past and is something that I have struggled with.  It was "I am accepted".  I spent most of my life with the idea that I hold no value to other people.  My self-esteem was such that I felt like there was nothing about me that was attractive.  I spent much of my time trying to find ways to not have to be myself.  I hid behind shyness in high school, I just didn't go out much.  I behind my fraternity and its image in college.  I was able to have an identity through that without having to do anything on my own.  Not liking who you are is a difficult thing to deal with.  I really makes it hard to be happy and actually live life.    The thing that really struck me this morning is just how far I have come from that point in my life.  After accepting Christ into my life, I have actually come to terms with who I am.  I like who I am, I have no problem living my life as myself.  I don't try and take on the character of anyone else.  I no longer have to worry about what others think because I am accepted and loved by the only One who matters, God.  I am free from the constraints of the world and the things that held me back before.  I have never been so happy in my life or had more joy than I do now.  I live my life as myself. Christ's promise was life and life to the full, and I can say that He fulfills that completely.

      Yesterday I mentioned that I was thinking about spending some time in the New Testament because all of my reading since this winter was in the Old Testament.  Well, this morning I made the switch.  I just finished Esther so I was on the cusp of delving into Job when I decided I need some variety.  I ended up in 1 Thessalonians this morning.   I read only the first few chapters this morning, but I've been trying to think over what I read.  In the beginning of the book, Paul speaks for a while about the motive behind what they did in Thessalonica.  At one point he states,  "On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts."  ~ 1 Thes 2:4  Paul makes it very clear that what he and Timothy were doing was not the result of human ambition to advance themselves in any way.  Their goal was to bring glory to God through by obeying Him and spreading the Gospel.  I started to think today, in light of what I read and a conversation I had over lunch.  What are my motives?  Do I want to serve God in order to advance myself or do I serve God for God?  I wonder how much the opinion of others weighs on my choices.  Do I do certain things to impress others?  It really got me wondering about whether my heart is in the right place.  It's kind of interesting that I'm beginning to read a book called  It's Not About Me  by Max Lucado, maybe that will help clear up the issue in my mind.

      I've been continuing my quest of reading the Old Testament. Basically, I'm reading straight through the entire thing. I've skipped a few books here and there, but my time reading in the morning is devoted to the Old Testament. It's been a while since I've read anything in the New Testament consistently, so I might take a break from my Old Testament quest soon.  So I just finished Esther this morning, you know, the only book of the Bible that doesn't mention God. On the surface that might seem like something that would take away from the impact of a book of the Bible. However, the author did it for a reason and it is still an amazing story. A while back I posted about my current passion for stories. I think that despite the lack of a mention of God, it still teaches a lot about certain aspects of God's character. Granted, there aren't really any verses that are great sound bites, but it just means you have to pay a little bit more attention.  One of the things that I have decided I need to make more deliberate effort of doing is meditating on what I read in the morning throughout the day. My mind has a lot of time to wander while at work and it can tend to go to not so good things. I have been trying this afternoon to think about what I read this morning and really think about what it says.  The book of Esther really shows how God orchestrates things together and how his plan works out. Esther may have never imagined that she would have become Queen, but God put her there for a purpose. Through her position she was able to use her influence with the king to save the Jews from certain slaughter. God had her there for a reason.  That's a thought I have found myself really trying to grab a hold of, especially considering my work life. Yeah, I work a job I don't like, but I'm here for a reason so there is no purpose in pouting or complaining about it. The goal is to seek out God while I am here and do His work while here. There's a reason I didn't get the job at Limited Brands or the other job here, I have no basis to sulk over them, I can learn from them and move on. The best that I can do is continue to do my part in seeking out God and continuing to prepare myself for the next step. It is easy to rest on the promise that God has good things for you as long as you don't rest on it so much that you become lazy and inactive. It is my belief that this is a partnership, we must move with God for Him to be able to guide us.  I feel like this post is full of incomplete or inaccurate thoughts, so feel free to let me know.

      Can I just say how much I love it when I get comments from people I didn't even know read my blog?  I love checking it out and having that random comment from a random person (Micah, you rock).   That's all I got right now.  Except for the fact that I haven't been sleeping very well.  Getting up 2 or 3 times a night to go the bathroom doesn't help.  I'm not sure whether I've caught up on sleep since coming back from LT or not.  I'm the type of person that need 7 hours a sleep a night or I don't function real well.  I remember back in college when I was home on winter break one year.  I lifeguard at the Y and I would open up 2 or 3 days a week.  My work schedules those days was something like 5am-9:30am.  I remember at one point my Mom told me that I wasn't the easiest person to deal with on those days.  I get kind of crabby and anti-social when I'm really tired.  That was from my Mom, so case in point, I need sleep.  Not just for me, but for you too.

      Generally, when I talk about work it is to gripe about something.  This time it isn't or at least I don't plan for it to be.  I took a mentor class yesterday.  So I am now a Bisys mentor.  What does that mean?  That when someone new starts, they would sit with me and learn how the job and how things go.  Not only did it get me out of my everyday routine for most of the day, but I realized something that I desire out of work.   I mentioned before that one of the things that bothers me about my job is the lack of interaction with other people.  During class yesterday I was thinking about the duties involved with being a mentor and the chances I've had already to do some things that are similar to what I would be doing.  I sit in between two people who are relatively new and I field questions from them regularly throughout the day.  Sometimes the questions get old (when I'm really busy or it's the same question I've answered 5 times), but most of the time I really enjoy helping them figure things out.  I love helping people figure out where things went wrong or teaching them what to do.  It also involves just working through a problem with someone else.  It is something that cheers me up and wakes my soul.   I have kind of realized this point before, but I thought about it a lot more yesterday.   I am also feeling rather grateful today to have a job.  I found out today about a large number of people who might not have a job for too much longer.  The thing is, it is due to circumstances that are completely outside their control.  It makes me sad for them and helps me see to not take what I have for granted.

      Wow.  That's all I've got right now.  I just finished reading the chapter about Jeremiah in  The Book of God .  The story of his life astounds me.  When I look at who he was, I see a man of true faith.  His prophesied about the exile of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem.  Throughout the story of his life, you can see him being pulled in two different directions, tormented by the coming destruction of the people and city he loved, but commissioned by God to speak his word.  To read about how he cried out to the Lord about torment that he withstood, but through all of the pain he undertook, he was faithful to God and God was faithful to Jeremiah.  To me, that is a beautiful picture of faith and trust in God.

      I really want to post something more substantial or more uplifting, but I haven't been able to think of anything.  So I will settle with some thoughts on work right now.  I'm going through another one of those cycles in which I'm really down on work.  This time I'm not sure if I can chalk it up to my own attitude.  I think the problem is that I feel like I am wasting my time.  My job is really easy.  There is no need to engage my mind in what I'm doing.  Most of what I do can be done without really thinking about it.  Seriously, how much thought does it take to look at two different reports and compare numbers to make sure they match?  It tests your memory to remember all of the little details that need to be taken care of day by day.  Basically, once you get into a routine, there is no real need to think at all.  Therein lies the problem, I would like to have a job that causes me to think and challenges me everyday.  I want my mind to be stimulated.  To use an economic term, I am underemployed.  My skills are not being used to a point that I would like them to be.   I also realize that part of the problem could be an adjustment to the working world.  I spent the last 4 years before this getting massive breaks during the year.  Because Otterbein is on quarters, we always got six weeks for Christmas break (Thanksgiving through the first of the year) and from the middle of June until the middle of September off for the summer.  I haven't taken much time off since the beginning of the year.  Granted, I took a week off for LT, but I don't count that.  LT was amazing and I am so glad I went, but it didn't allow much time for myself.  I think what I need to do is take at least a few days off soon, but that can't happen until late August or September.  Probably one of the best things I could do right now is spend some time away from work.   Well, I can leave work now.  So that is what I am going to do.
