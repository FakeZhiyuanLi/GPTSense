      I have a final tomorrow in my Global Economy class.  I have to get an A in the exam to get an A, i think.  However, this one time, i was talking my professor and he was saying it is sad that students are more worried about grades then comprehending concepts that exam is going to cover.  which i think is pretty sad.  but look it at from student's point of view, the way education system is set up that, if you don't have certain GPA you will not be admitted to certain program or get into good college.  For example, in order for you to survive in MBA program you must maintain GPA of 3.0.  that means, you better not get two C's in two classes, else you will be put on probation.  Now, as a student, i will try my best to get an A just to stay alive in the program.    Question is, what's imp, concepts or grades?  i say, both are imp.  i think the fault is in the education system, who puts so much emphasis on grades and entrance exams.  i do not remember anything i studied in my astronomy class, because, i was required to take 6 hours of science, and so i did.  i think universities require students to take certain classes, like history and math and sciences, just to keep them in school for longer period of time and tution.

      let's go back 4-5 years, when economy was good.  This was the time  when college graduate's starting salary was nothing less than 50K, no  experience was required, training was provided to you, person just out  of college with no experience was getting 2-3 job offers from big  companies.      Let's fastforward to the time after 9/11.  College graduate's  starting salary is 25K-30K, experience is required, even after you  apply at 50-60 companies, if you are lucky and if you had the right  skills you might get one job interview.        I belong to the post 9/11 group of graduates.  I graduated in Dec.  of 2001, the worst time to graduate from college.  while in  college, just like others, i was hoping to get a good job that i  enjoyed, which pays well and then pay off the college loans.  but  that didn't happen.  9/11 changed everything.  no jobs were  availabel, companies started to laying off people, which increased the  number of experienced people in the market and lowered the value of  college graduates.  They expected college graduates to have  experience, but how were we suppose to have job expeience if you will  not offer us jobs?  everything was going down.      Even now, if you look at it, people who obtained well paying job before  9/11 and who were able to survive numerous layoffs, are about to buy  houses at the age of 28.  Imagaine that, age of 28.  Of  course, that makes me feel undervalued and un-intelligent.        IF i had graduated only one semester early?  Now, i do have a job  that i do not enjoy and does not pay well.  things have  changed.  i am trying to obtain more education and trying to look  for something better.      If i were to give advice to people who are graduating from college now,  i'd say, try to get internship while in college and don't expect a  starting salary of $50K when you start a job, unless you have graduated  from a prestigous school and are going to work for multinational.      One day changed the life of millions for the most part worst, started  wars, thousands died.  it might be this way, but what are you  gonna do, this is "the way things are according to me...".

It is awesome how world comes together for this event and takes a break from fighting each other. it is wonderful how sports brings the world together.

Olympics brings the world together every 4 years for good.

      Have you ever noticed, how NBA championships are called "World Champions",  even though all the games are played by America's team.  Same thing with Superbowl games, winners are called "world champions" even though there is a league in Europe for "American Football".  so what's up with this?  did i mention, same thing with baseball champions?  Are Americans the only one playing basketball, football, and baseball games?  or does Americans think that world revolves around them?  i mean seriously, come on now.  Look at World Cup Cricket or Soccer World cup.  Now those are really world cups and winners are truely world champions.  b/c it involves other countries, and thus winners are called "World Champions".  Same thing ABC, NBC, CBS "World New tonight, with, "blah blah blah..."".  if you watch the news, there is nothing in the news about world, its all US news, US politics, and places where US is involved, such as Iraq and middle east.  When earthquake happened in India in 01, it came in the news may be once, even though there are millions of Indians living in US.  In contrast, look at BBC World News, now those are really WORLD NEWS, it comes on PBS at nights.  Seriously, is America so involved in itself that it forgets that there is world out there besides its own?
