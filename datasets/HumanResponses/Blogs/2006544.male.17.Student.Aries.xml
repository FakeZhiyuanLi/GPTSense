      ... estou de volta nesse blog pra arrasar! Let's rock it!!! Estou mudando novamente o enfoque dos meus posts! Menos da minha vida e mais sobre meus pensamentos... Quem me conhecer vai saber bem do que estou falando, pelo que estou passando. Mas quem não me conhecer também vai se entreter com os posts. Vai pensar um pouco comigo, e é isso que importa!  Beijos e abraços pra quem merece, GPTO

      Society has been through many ups and downs on the last ages, but really, we think we are so ahead of our times but still think about many things as if we were back in the  Middle Ages . It could even be considered some sort of latest fashion, a  "Retro trend" , if it just wasn't so stupid and so old-fashioned... People really think it is funny and  pop-cult  to insult and humble those who are different, and are even encouraged by others to do so. We actually got to the point of not caring about other people's choices, skincolor or religion (somewhere around the 80's, I am not sure, I wasn't here), but of course that for every two steps forward we   have to take   at least one back. You don't have to be part of a minority group to feel upset about that kind of reaction from people. And even if you're are not black, or an indian, or spanic, even if you are not gothic or hinduist, even if you're not gay or anything like that, you most certainly are different in some way. We are   all   equal, and (thanks, God) different in some way. That is what makes us so  unique , that is what makes relationships so interesting.  Hugs, from an ordinary different guy, just like you, GePeTo  Ps.: Just read  urlLink last Saturday's post . I has a LOT to do with this one. Ps2.(not PlayStation2, [geez, that's old]): Just because you like HipHop, it doesn't mean it's the best or the ONLY good society around, ok?

      After all, who am I?  I just think it's a way TOO silly question to start a post. Actually I think I'll just give up... I don't usually give up on things ...  OK, there's nothing coming to my mind... Just forget this post, it never actually happened.

      How come people always think they're right? People always think there's no other truth but the one they believe in. People always fight for their points of view (and that's good), but never consider other people's (and that's bad, really bad). How come people hate when they're not allowed to show their thoughts, but they are never willing to accept ideas differing from their own? Why are people so stupid to the point of doing things they criticize?  Why? Because we're human  (and we need to be loved, just like everybody else does) .  GePeTo

      After such a long period  "resting"  this blog is back to life... It is good to be back. I missed writing those crazy thing I was used to. After posting somewhere else in a totally different way  (I was posting about my boring life, imagine that...)  I noticed t'was not what I wanted anymore... I need to write things which people who don't know me are able to understand, and that people who know me are able to relate back to me... So... I am back.  Kisses for those who deserve it, hugs for those who don't, GPTO
