        urlLink     As haunting as it still is, the 9/11 horror still lingers in the minds of Canadians as well as Americans. The following report is over 500 pages of .pdf that may help piece together the truth of what really happened on that tragic day.

        urlLink     I think it is safe to say that I am a Mac geek. I should be in one of those "..I switched to Mac.." commercials. Eleven years of system admin duties with Windows would make anybody switch.

        urlLink     Apparently Size Does Matter to PS3  PS3 discs will dwarf current DVDs capacity.  August 04, 2004 - Sony announced today that their next generation console, the PlayStation 3, will utilize the Blu-Ray disc format which blows apart the current DVD system's capabilities. The Blu-Ray discs will be able to hold up to 5 times as much data.   Blu-Ray discs are similar to DVDs except they use blue laser light as opposed to red laser light to read and write data. The PlayStation 3 will come equipped with the Blu-Ray technology allowing playback of high definition movies (which are expected to change to the new format in the coming years).   The storage capacity of the Blu-Ray discs dwarf the amount stored on DVDs. So much so, that they don't have to spell Blue with an 'e'. A single-layer Blu-Ray disc can hold up to 27Gb on a single layer as opposed to 4.7Gb on a DVD. No worries, though, if you use your PS2 to watch movies. The Blu-Ray technology allows it to read original DVD discs.   Other units that feature the read-only standard will start to appear near the end of the current fiscal year through March 2005. During that same span, Sony plans on revealing the PlayStation 3.   Juicy, juicy.

        urlLink     Believe it or not I received this in an email. Got to get me a one ;> This is the original Pokia Stevenage. As a working prototype it will work on delivery but I can't guarantee a long life if used heavily. This is wired to fit the newer Sony Ericsson handsets such as the t68i, t610 and the k700i. Please note, the k700i featured in the photo is not for sale, just the Pokia handsfree accessory. see http://www.pokia.com for more details. (Give me a break!!!)

        urlLink     the Kopi Luwak story  The Luwak (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) denizen of the coffee (kopi) plantations of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi, eats only the ripest coffee cherries.  Unable to digest the coffee beans the Luwak graciously deposits them on the jungle floor where they are eagerly collected by the locals.  The stomach acids and enzymatic action involved in this unique fermentation process produces the beans for the worldâ€™s rarest coffee beverage.
