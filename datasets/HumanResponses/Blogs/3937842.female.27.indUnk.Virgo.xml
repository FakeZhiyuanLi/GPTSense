      a hot-bed is used for starting a plant to grow from a seed. it is a box like affair containing a&nbsp;a foot or more&nbsp;deep of&nbsp;manure in the bottom, over which is a layer of earth between 6 to 8 inches. the top is covered with clear plastic or plexiglass&nbsp;to let in the sun and keep out cold. the hot-bed can be of any convenient size or shape.&nbsp;once the soil is added, it is moistened and allowed to stand until warmed by the heating of the manure. the weed seeds in the soil will soon germinate. after the weeds&nbsp;have been&nbsp;pulled the seed for the garden plants can be planted. a hot-bed will usually give off heat for five or six weeks. the soil is kept moist at all times, but never wet. water is applied in the morning so the plant foliage will dry by evening.  &nbsp;    urlLink    &nbsp;  it has been said by many&nbsp;that detroit is a hot-bed for creative talent.

      No, not  that  Spirit - not the famous statue downtown in front of the Coleman Young building that frequently dons a sports jersey.&nbsp; No, I'm talking about actual spirits hanging around Detroit.&nbsp; Today my interest was piqued when listening to a radio show on the way to work about a guy who didn't know if he should buy a house or not.&nbsp; The house was marked down $75K from it's valued price due to a violent murder that took place inside the house.&nbsp; He was worried it might be too odd of a vibe/aura in the house or that the house might end up being haunted after such a violent death. This got me thinking about all the freaky things that have happened in my life and my family's (not at all violence-related).&nbsp; My mind just marvels at the idea of the paranormal and supernatural.&nbsp; When you combine historic Detroit and paranormal together, I get giddy.&nbsp;   I decided to look up some haunted places around Michigan and write about it in here.&nbsp; After all, the season of ghosts and the spirit-world will be here before we know it (Hallow'een).&nbsp; And not that we were ever  that  courageous or ever did anything  truly  scary, but a few of us (Trent included) used to scout out eerie and scary places and traipse through them looking for something to frighten us out of our minds.&nbsp; hahaha.&nbsp;   There is just too much history and haunting in and around Detroit and the entire state.&nbsp; I can't possibly summarize it.&nbsp; Instead, if you're interested and have time, check out some of these websites for some amazing stories and information:     An abandoned insane asylum,  urlLink Eloise ,&nbsp;that I visited in high school - SCARY!   urlLink Forgotton Michigan &nbsp;- a cool site with pictures of our past and current historical sites and stories  There is a DVD/VHS documentary in circulation, shot Blair Witch style, from some guy who toured the Northville Tunnels (and a bit of Eloise) and filmed it on and off from 1981-1997.&nbsp;  urlLink Here is a link  of an ended auction for this DVD on eBay:    urlLink Northville Hospital/Tunnel website &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;a cheesy&nbsp;site on these now torn-down&nbsp;buildings.&nbsp; However, it&nbsp;does have some cool info, maps, images&nbsp;and sample footage from the film.&nbsp; Aha! You can purchase the film(s) here!&nbsp; They&nbsp;also have&nbsp;some good links to check out.  (Go  urlLink here  for images from&nbsp;outside and in all kinds of abandoned historic Detroit buildings)  A list (in PDF format) of  urlLink Detroit's Dirty Dozen ; buildings that Detroit has been cracking down on,&nbsp;asking owners bring them up to code or face demolition.   An  urlLink index of haunted places  in Michigan  Another  urlLink list   A Detroit  urlLink news article  on historical Native American haunting stories.    Enjoy!

      Guess what! &nbsp; Detroit  is a great place to vacation. Don't believe me? Then check out  this article from the Guardian Newspaper (UK)  that goes into great detail about why  Detroit  is such a great place to visit.    &nbsp;     Detroit is not glamorous; it is gritty real. Once the industrial heartland of America, the home of the Ford motor plant and General Motors, today the city has a haunting quality - filled with beautiful deserted warehouses and burnt-out Victorian mansions left to crumble after the civil riots of 1967. It recalls Manchester or Liverpool in the 1980s, before the luxury apartments and the cocktail bars arrived.  Two reporters from London, Laura Barton and Amy Fleming, traversed the pond to spend sometime in the D.&nbsp; They are quick to point out that Detroit is home to many hot bands ( urlLink Blanche ,  urlLink The Von Bondies ,  urlLink The White Stripes  to name a few)&nbsp;but also pay heed to the Detroit music legends of the past ( urlLink Stevie Wonder ,  urlLink Diana Ross ,  urlLink The Temptations , once again, to name a few).  &nbsp; The women spend much of their time exploring different parts of Detroit, visiting concert venues, museums and landmarks made famous by movies like  urlLink 8 Mile .&nbsp; Part of their trip was to visit Cleveland (which they say they were coerced into doing) but were not impressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In their estimation,&nbsp;" Cleveland is a prosperous city, sitting on pretty Lake Erie. It seems nice, if a little homogenised. And it can't hold a candle to Detroit. " &nbsp; In all the women spend 5 days in Detroit heralding&nbsp;it " the greatest city in the world ."&nbsp; If I listen to my heart I think I might have to agree.&nbsp; I have never read such a complimentary article on Detroit in my entire life.&nbsp; It is an excellent read&nbsp;about an excellent city.&nbsp; If you would like to plan your own  Detroit Holiday  head on over to  urlLink VisitDetroit.com  to start your planning.

      One of the many cool things about Detroit is the variety of festivals&nbsp;there always seem to be.&nbsp; If you look at the Entertainment section of the  urlLink Free Press &nbsp;or the Events section of the  urlLink Metro Times , there never ceases to be an assortment of festivals or cultural happenings to attend.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This weekend Detroit boasted one of it's biggest and most diverse events of the year:  urlLink The Concert of Colors .&nbsp; Not only is the festival three days (Fri. - Sun.), but it's also FREE!&nbsp; I don't know many folks who don't like cool stuff for free.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So this festival is all about celebrating different cultures, music, dance, food and merchandise.&nbsp; It's held at Chene Park, which I think&nbsp;of as a mini Pine Knob (or  urlLink DTE Music Center &nbsp;as it's now called, but I refuse to say).&nbsp; Chene Park is a newer park (within the last 20 years) and is actually ON the Detroit River.&nbsp; The stage on which the artists perform backs up to the river and overlooks the Windsor skyline.&nbsp; Boats pull up and anchor behind the stage to catch some tunes and most concerts held here throughout the summer are free.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  The rest of the park features rolling hills, restrooms and concession stands and a watery edge lined with big boulders and trees for you to sit on or lean against and relax near the river.&nbsp; The Concert of Colors uses this space to set up all kind of food tents (Indian, African, Cuban, American, etc.), merch. tents (clothing, incense, jewelry, bath &amp; body, trinkets, etc.) and music tents (a diversity tent where local acts [namely Mark's brother's band,  urlLink Bloom ] are invited to perform, as well as a rhythm stage where percussion and African dance is performed).&nbsp; The main stage is reserved for the big acts - this year: Los Lobos, Ani Difranco, Los Amigos Invisibles and even Little Richard, to name a few.&nbsp; In years past, we've seen Cibo Matto, Ray Charles, Femi Kuti&nbsp;and The Temptations grace the stage.&nbsp; We stuck around for  urlLink Ani &nbsp;and watched the pavilion fill up with  all  kinds of people. I was excited that she played "As Is" and "Shameless." And, although I admit I don't know most of her repertoire, I was glad to see her live.&nbsp; She's&nbsp;a great performer and has a beautiful voice.&nbsp; (And did I mention it was&nbsp;free?).&nbsp; &nbsp; We were going to stick it out till the end to see  urlLink Burning Spear , but we had had an emotional roller-coaster kind of a day (what with the Bloom act playing&nbsp;and their entire posse there and all), so we decided to end our stay early and head on over to Xochi's for some yummy enchiladas&nbsp;&nbsp;  (Ahhh...  urlLink Xochimilco's  - now, that's an entirely different post).  &nbsp;  I know I may sometimes complain about there being nothing to do around this town, but festivals like these remind me just how cool Detroit can be.&nbsp; How cool the town and the people in and around it are.&nbsp;&nbsp;And how if you really look&nbsp;around&nbsp;and open your mind, you can always find something to do and people to learn from.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Welcome to the D.
