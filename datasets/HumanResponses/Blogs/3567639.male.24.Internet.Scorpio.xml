						   Conceived by carelessness, I’ve been abandoned, beaten, and chastised. Any lesser man would call the glass half full. I can feel your scorn now. I sense your distaste. I’ll go away and leave you alone.  8 . 29 . 2

						   Not a day goes by when I haven’t suffered for you. But you could care less.. I only torment myself so you don’t have to. But you dig your nails into my face and kick me to the floor. And as I lie here broken I’ll reflect on the pain I take for you. Bear witness to the agony I’ve created. Walk a mile in my shoes to see my paradise in this hell. Double fisting travesty, I come forth darker than stable.  6 . 1 . 1

						   Equal to men. Favored by the god. Eldership useless. Inimitable traits spawned by thought. Thought from experience. Experience from action. Action not always your own.  10 . 24 . 2

						   Sad but unmistaken thoughts cloud my mind. Worried beyond doubt, days are spent contemplating the price of aloud. Mists of time bring thunderous emotions; old friends bring tears of bullets. Drugs bring comfort beyond belief. True happiness is selfishly squandering sleep. A place all my own; all alone. Now standing in the rain facing sunset in the east, all thoughts focusing intention of deception, my blade pierces my chest. My name is hideous agony, courier of hatred. Deafened by the wail of sighs, I turn my back upon eyes and prey in silence. Voltage erupts from my veins too much to contain, death coils eat my flesh raw. Blackness comes and I’m still alive. Excruciating pain leaves me helpless but death’s liberty is too far away..  8 . 23 . 0

						   Caught in the literal grip of a nightmare... Like a fucking fungus growing on my mind. Fury swells deep inside waiting to strike upon any mother fucker that crosses me.. The boy scout slain bears witness to the darkness within my soul too rotten for hell, too pure for heaven. Praying for death, preying on sunshine. Focus on the moment. A second closer.. Closer to eternity. Marooned in this dementia, sword in hand. Exiled by humanity, persecuted by Christ. Blood boils in the substandard heat. A minority in the majority I fight to defend All that is dear to me against the privileged. I wanna fucking scream. I wanna leave paradise.  7 . 14 . 0

						   Touch the fire, burn as I have but your pain becomes mine. I lose faith and grow weary with each passing day protecting you from a society what worships cake & sodomy. Heavy burdens and excruciating torment transform into the satisfaction of a hard day’s work and I’ll rest easy tonight knowing that tomorrow is just another tragedy waiting to happen. It’s not easy being your superhero but the reward is great I’d brave the fiery inferno in hell to see a smile upon your face.  9 . 28 . 99
