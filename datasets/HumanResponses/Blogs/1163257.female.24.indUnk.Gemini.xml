       Pain/Pleasure   Uncertainty. 4 more days to last day. Preparations of gifts to the girls. Whole chunk of emotions and memories are just not exactly what I will like to label as pleasure.   I never think goodbyes are great. In whichever sense, never. Coming up with a farewell speech to a group of people that I relate as part of my family is just so hard. So much to say but wanting to keep it short with substance is just so hard. Each and everyone of them just meant so much to me. I never think about it until now. Taken granted of their presence a fair bit. To come out with the farewell letter, and thinking of their value in my life just blew me away.   Realised one trait of mine. I have always been the one who is the most verbal about things I am most unhappy about. When it comes to people I valued, I suddenly become a mute. I am never the best person to tell u how much I love someone; how much I appreciate what you have done; how much your little actions count; and well, just basically, how much you meant to me in your smallest ways.   Suddenly, as the date draws near, no excitement, no happiness... Just pain that I am leaving my 'family' to a whole different place. A 'family' who taught me so much. Built my character. Accepted me for the person I am. Tolerated my obnoxious behaviour/temper..well, just me, Agnes. No amount of thank you nor gifts can apprehend my heartfelt gratitude to them. I am gonna miss them... hell loads.   Of cos, the pleasure then comes. For every relationship built up, is everything that built the hate/love feelings. I am happy I tried to be part of everyone's life and had been a part of theirs. And so... moving on.

       Pleasure   Funerals. Dun agree? Think about it. When was the last time, you met all your family members at one time. Those that you dislike. Those you like. Everyone. New added family members whom you din know existed. All these people come together over one death of someone you respect, love and known for the longest time. In a funeral.   Being me. I just love interaction. Of late, I love to interact mostly with family members. Aunts, uncles, cousins, everyone. My mom's sisters are really fun people. Their opinions just flabbergast you. Is new for me. Is no longer the 'when are you getting married?' Is now, dun get married. Singlehood is good. Earn the money and enjoy life. Laffs. They rock!  Being the nurse in the family. You get alot of questions about your work. There's questions from what do actually do in the hospital. They want you to talk about your work. They wanna know about certain thing that they are concern about. I am not complaining. I am glad I am able to help however I can.   Coming back, death is a good thing. I never see death as a bad form. Of cos, loss are painful. But for an old lady who is bedridden, going in/out from hospital, being very sick and knowing that you are causing much burden to your family. Death comes as a relief not only for the one who is sick but for everyone around. Death is a knock to Heaven's doors. Your gateway to God. I look forward to mine. I am glad for her that she is there... wherever she may be.   Funeral should be a celebration of a new chapter for everyone. A time for mourings and time for sharing the things that the death had brought to us. I am glad I knew her. My memories of her are such of a very pleasant old lady who is generous not only monetary wise and of a gracious heart. Always smiling no matter how ill she is. =)

       Pain   Changes. Hate it. Memories. Hate it. Selfishness. Hate it.   I am probably seeing the bad side to these. As much as I am quite adaptable to changes and all, but I really hate it. The idea of having to readapt to a place/person is just a real pain in the arse feeling. Especially when it comes to dealing with people you freaking cannot stand is just sheer torment.   Memories. I watched eternal sunshine of a spotless mind just the other day. A very nice non conventional love story. But that's besides the point. The point I wanted to make was memories. If given a chance, would u wanna have ur memories erased? Sometimes I would. I get so miffed off with some people's attitudes and all, I simply just erased them out. Like having them on msn and erasing them off. Then again, it doesnt make much of a difference. Caused erasing from such minute things does not equates to erasing them completely off your mind. We all know it. The pain still lies there somehow somewhere. One thing for sure, I know that with current issue. I know that I am not in love. I am just wanting to possess what I cannot attained. What I think sometimes scares me. Such a monster I turned out to be. Erasing of memories will only mean one thing. Not remember painful lessons u learnt. *ponders* That, at least, is an issue to me. Having the need to be defensive as a tool for surviving.  Selfishness. Did I mention how selfish people around you get when you grow older? Choice of perception is really important sometimes. Honestly, I just freaking hate the concept of selfishness. As much as I may hate it, I dun disagree with it. Is just part of a tool to surviving around. Yes. An irony. Whatever I say are ironies, is probably a personality disorder in a gemini. Anyway, I dunno how much I can bear of such recent thoughts of mine. It only spells suicide.    Pain

       Pleasure   Performance is a pleasure. Especially one like Marc Salem which provides you some psychic readings of your mind. One that involves audience participation. Making it more believable.  (Pulse that stops when and whence he wants it to be stopped. Or making a 2nd hand watch stopped.)As much as it can involved a lil bit of cult but whatever makes a better performance for everyone to enjoy. Bringing a smile and a form of distraction for some like me.   Playing tourist in your own homeland; Taking boat ride; Enjoying the wind blowing into ur face; Having ur hair to flow through it; Realising that an old friend can actually click with you, have fun and able to just enjoy an almost endless session of talk; Finally finding the answer to your dilemmas are just things of pleasure. They are also the things that were done in a brilliant sunday of mine.   The end comes. When U are priviledged to be home safe. Having another chance to start your day all over again tomolo. What will you choose to do then?

       Pleasure   The new blogging system allow many free features. I am really loving it. It means that I can share my pictures with the online community. Really liking the whole idea. It's very easy to use too. Many many cool features. Thanks blogger.   A good beginning of a Sunday. Kelvin came back from Newcastle. He called me! Nice. His return only means good news for me. My movie/zouk/outing khaki is back. Yeah, we are gonna rock the world! More things to do with a good friend. I feel really blessed somewhat. I made a loss somehow but I gained back something somehow. Is all good. =)

       Pain   Of recent, I dunno is it some sort of trend with men or is it just caused I am striked with bad luck that I am meeting with wishy washy chaps. There's a common trait in these men. They like women who are fiesty, independent and well, able to somewhat outtalked them. But when it comes to settle down for a relationship, they quirmed up and avoid to the very core. Excuses can range from anything to the endless horizon. Trust me, my eyes had never rolled so much. It prolly can do somersaults. Show u next time ya? Laffs. Only performed upon request.   My thoughts about it. I am jaded. I dun pin so much hope on the bullshit about love, men and marriage. When I decided that I like someone enuf to wanna start something, I think it comes  a lot from myself. I think it also speaks a lot about that person who I like. Communication is what I always yearn mostly. Caused when I feel u got communications lingo, eventually, anything can be worked upon.   Thus I guess, of recent, that someone prolly... 1. Do not like me enuf. 2. We are not exactly communicating like I think we are. 3. Just hitching me for a ride. 4. Lastly, just wanting to maintain my attention to keep the companionship going on.   I had enjoyed what we had. Not much but i did. He is special. I guess I just cant fault anyone on the wishy washy-ness. Afterall, singlehood has just so much to offer. Is a pain but moving on...

       Pleasure?     Lost weight? I am currently weighing 49 kg on the old weighing machine. Usually, it reflects as 50-51 kg. Sheesh. I dunno if it's a pleasure, really. Cos losing weight only means one thing. Losing my muscle mass and developing more fats. Honestly, I dun see myself losing weight. Hmmz... I really need to hit gym for real. Argh! I hate to exercise. *groans*

       Pain/Pleasure     Smoking. I cant decide whether is it a pain or pleasure.     Yup. You got it. I decided to take up my very first puff. I think I am a natural. Laffs. No cough. Nothing. Just smoking and well well well, I have to say that it was pretty relaxing. Very much just like breathing. Just that you are inhaling tar, nicotine and loads of junk that make your lungs so black, you do not even wanna start imagining. Laffs. Wondering eh? Why did this nurse even smoke then?    I dunno. I had always wanted to try it. Wanted to know how it feels like. Wondered if it was that relaxing like how it looked like it. Afterall back in eons, people smoke opium for pleasure. Why not ciggies eh? Anyway, it was brilliant at thee moment. The smoke you inhaled is defintely much better than having to smell people who smoked like chimneys. So... Since you cant beat that smoke, join the gang. Laffs. The menthol smell makes smoking taste like you are eating sweet. Leaving that menthol feeling in your mouth. Cool and tingling. Laffs. I din feel like smoking again after our lil outing. No craves nothing. But but.... I think I will smoke socially. Hehe. Is a good form of ventilation in a quiet manner. Just smoke away.     The bad effects after smoking. You smell like a smoking chimney. The smell in your mouth and fingers dun exactly go away. You get a lil sore at the back of your throat. You get headache. I felt my skin went a lil way too dry. Hmmz... Ya. Laffs. There's quite alot of things that I hate to be but I am still gonna do it occassionally.    Hmmz... I think I am defintely stressed and boogled down. Hehe. Ol well. Cheers to thee smoking days! Laffs.

       Pain     To be attached. Literally, to be attached. To be in a relationship. To be a girlfriend of another. Is a painnnnnn!     I like to sum it up by saying that I am jaded. Not believing in love, men and anything mortal. Cause the truth is, you really just cant depend on anyone. You only got yourself to rely on.  I strongly stand firm on that. Whether has this got to do with my previous relationship or not, it does not matter anymore. It's about the fact how I will be seeing things eventually and handling it.     Leading to.... Apparently, the new people that know me conclude me as a case of "chunk of mess", very mysterious and commitment phobic.  I am none of all that. Ok... Maybe the chunk of mess, I agree but the rest. Hell no. I am never mysterious. U wanna know about my bull in the past; ask and I will tell ya. No biggie. Commitment phobic. I guess I "protrayed" to be one cause the truth is I am "scouting" for someone that I wanna be with you for a long while. Not for the shortest time and break up and go through the whole entire stupid cycle again.  I am not seeking for marriage. Just a companionship that leads to hopefully better things in future. Laffs.     Anyway, last evening, my perhaps-prospective-permeant-companionship-for-a-while shared what he thought about me. It was along that wave length with what I had just mentioned above. Truth is,  I cried silently. He prolly din know that I did.  I am upset. I am not that complex. I am not the player. I just dunno how to seek happiness in the form of being in a relationship. How do I seek it when I dun even believe it? How do I even begin to apprehend how my whole thought about it is? Sigh.     I knew from the moment that I chose to meet him. I knew I had to maintain the "relationship" going on. If not he would just end up like any other chaps that enter my life and leave on a tired basis. Knowing that it's impossible to convince me into anything. I find the maintaining part a chore. I find myself wanting to go with the flow but yet find it a real pain. Is conflictual frustrations.  Sigh.     Want or dun want.... The choice?  Till then... Good night, Aggie.

       Pain     Vicious cycle. Cycle of those who have fallen for me and what happened to them. This only happens when you dun believe in the word love and whatever that has relations to it.     Of recent, someone that was of possible chance to be with me got hitched to someone else. My reaction... To be quite completely honest, I am not only shocked but feel a tiny weeny bit of sadness. Not so much for the fact that he is no longer an option. More of the fact that I am really beginning to see that I am living this life of mine not believing that things are meant for me.  In whichever sense.  This has not happened for the 1st time.     This time is probably different is perhaps because this particular "soul" meant quite a bit.  The difference is perhaps cause I can see that we share so many things in common. We are very much a clone of each other. The way we see things, our passions ( he liked to call it.) and our respondes to things.  He meant something, somewhere inside me.    What gave away or at least I tot it did was the fact that I din feel happy with him. At least, not most times.  I just din like how certain things turned out. Of course, he din felt how I feel. All he felt was I was no longer interested and that he could not anymore see how I could feel for him.  The truth is, I never eliminated him as an option. I was and still am choosing.  I see that there was still a chance in us if, well, if I just actually allow him in my life. I guess he is right. I was never really myself. Never really allowing him to enter.     Is just weird really. How one will eventually settle for second best. I am surprised at his choice. Not so much about the girl but the fact that he moved on. I am not being arrogrant/being idealistic here. (Okay, maybe a little.) I knew he wanted us to be together. I just do not think I am ready for anyone. Not that he is not special enough. Just that I cannot feel it in me to give happiness to another. Or at least, choosing not to feel that way. I am confident to a certain extent that I was top of his choice in whichever list of girls he was holding on to.     This entry is dedicated to him. He had and still is influencing my life. Besides the bad things that I constantly mentioned, he is a soul that constantly seeks for the simplest form of happiness. It was just the way he attributes his manners that not many can tolerate. I still believe that he is a good person. Is a matter of whether did he want you to feel it or not.  Like I said it, it's a love-hate relationship we had. It wun changed and well, I am not not moving on, just that anything can happens. So... Cheers to the friendship! *wink*

       Pleasure     Recognition. To be able to do well and  recognised by your superior is  a good thing. I am enjoying the bit. But... Comes the....     Pain     I dun really like to be complimented for something that I have to maintain. I will very much like to work on a basis that I am doing it cause I have to and not something to maintain on the best side of my superior/to keep ur job intact. Is pretty stressful to be up there. Cos when u are up, u better maintain there. Any dipping down is just asking for hell. So.... I just do my best.     Another note, I do not think the US job offer will be pretty possible. So is gonna be in Singapore for prolly a couple of years. I think I will stay in Raffles for now. I supposed is gonna be another one year or two and save more money. Make more real plans to really get my arse outta of here. I think I will be more ready by then.     For now, just get my mind really settled on staying at Raffles and work my very best. Honestly, my current colleagues are nice and the dynamic of the team is there. I am feeling it. Just got to get into the rhythm of the work, the people and the culture.  I think I am doing pretty well.  I do not think there will be much updates about work for quite awhile.  So till then... the next update of work will be whether have I passed my probation.  Another 2 more months time.... Cheers.

       Pleasure     Options. Irregardless of whatever options I am talking about, is always a good thing to have a few things to choose from.  I dunno whether to call myself lucky with the vast options I am getting or simply just the fact that I am getting so committed phobic that I simply do not want to stay long at anywhere I worked at.     Anyway, I recently got a new job lobang from my ex colleague. Basicall, is to nurse 2 elderlys in states for 6 months. Salary will... well, let's just say it's gonna be a fruitful year if I worked for them. Details to be confirmed later.     My thoughts about it. I am pretty geared up for it. I am hoping to get it really.  Something which I think is really ideal. Working for 6 months. Salary good. New experience. Plus, I get to experience the culture over in the states. I think it will be really good.     Currently, working on the stupid resume. Dun even know how to write it. Stupid school never teach us.  Jo is helping out. Thanks a zillion, babe! Sending it by tonight. Hope to get a call from Ms Ng soon by this week.  *crossing fingers*

       Pain     Work. 6th day at work. My shift is changed. To work morning after an off day is just simply tiring. I very much understand the shortage of staffs but manz... trust me. Next few weeks or months, is gonna be crazy schedule. One off day per week? Plus day shifts all the way for the next 3 months. I am not very sure whether I can take all these "torture."     Working where I am working currently actually is the same with where I left off from. The differences is that I am loaded with more responsibilities, apparently. I have to make beds, served diets and send patient back and forth from xray? Somehow, being in private is not exactly that appealing. Actually, never felt appealed by it somehow.     I am having alot of hesitation to quit and changed environment. It actually really reflects on you if you just quit within less than a few months? Sigh. Dilemma. I do wanna do emergency medicine. Has always been interested by it. Love the adrenaline rush and the efficiency team from saving lives. Is very much like ER but of cos, ER kind of overhyped and make it looks really cool. Laffs.  Is not that cool. But most events are of cos pretty factual in ER. So... see! Emergency medicine is so fun. Ol well. Will see what happens. Till then... Ciao.

        pleasure     Long walks. Walked from hougang pool to home. Must say that is a pretty long walk. Nevertheless, it was pretty therapeutic. The sky was cloudy. Was a breezy evening. The many empty large plots of land around buangkok area was great for just taking long walks. In fact, many people actually jogged, brisk walk and cycled around that region. Din know that the area of mine is so nice. Hmmz... more long walks I guessed. Hehe.

On a brighter note, thanks to Jo's recommendation of the hot oil therapy, my hair has resumed back a lot more moisture comparing to the other day when I had my hair coloured. It's softer but then again, the volume of the hair really drives me crazy. Is totally uncontrollable plus the previous hair lines cause by many times of tying my hair up is TERRIBLE! Ol well.

       Pain   Invasion of space. Part I. Ever since my singlehood is reclaimed back, I am not short changed of attention from the other breed aka men. I am not complaining. I am quite a sucker for attention. I mean, if they wanna indulge me, fine, I take it. No harm for a little ego boosting.  Recently, or rather it had been for almost a few months already, there's this chap; Let's name him Mr Jadey. He is one of my ex patient's grandson. From myanmar. Daddy owns a jade mine. Super duper rich. Not good looking.(least likely concern for me if I can communicate with you.) English extremely broken. We cant sustain a MSN chat for the longest time. Extremely boring. All we talked about over msn is 1. What's your number? 2. Oh? U dun wanna give me? Then when? *rolls eyes* 3. What can I see you then? Sheesh!   If anyone watch 'Sleepless in seattle.', one would remember Tom hanks educating his son about dating. 1st date should always be a date for drinks only. If you dun like her enough, you only need to maintain the date through coffee or best, come out with some lame excuses and get outta of the date. If things are better, go for a full course dinner. It will only make sense. My singapore version of 'sleepless in seattle', give them the msn id, if you cant even sustain a conversation. Forget it! No numbers. No dates. No coffees nor dinner! Period!   Why the invasion of space? Apparently, I was out with JL yesterday, we were in the movies when suddenly my lifeless hp which no one bother to msg started to turn into a monster which I never seen it becoming. Oh yes. Trust me. Is pure irritation that I have to juggle sms-ing and watching a blardy spanish film which I have to read the subtitles at the same time. It doesnt exactly appease the 'caustrophobic' situation I was facing. U must be wondering? How the hell he sms when he dun have my number? That's the thing! He din. He got my friend to message me and ask me where I am and if I could see him like either like now or tomolo. I mean... HELLO?! *breathe breathe* Wassup dude? Argh! Anyway, when I got home, came online, he dun wanna talk to me. *rolls eyes* Men! On top of it, my friend kept messaging me and asked me when I am coming home. I am like," Look! If I have to start reporting my whereabouts to someone who just wanna know me, I might as well just kill myself. I got a lot more life to this manz." SHEESH!  The most exasperating thing about knowing some guys through a friend is that you are obligated to at least meet that chap for once. I feel obligated at least for the better for my own blardy life. Afterall, I agreed to give him my msn id. Knowing someone so rich comes in useful eventually. Like what Jo always say, networking. Sigh. So untill then... we shall await for the invasion of space. Part II ya?

       Pain   Differentiating. These days, as you walked down the streets, you will see quite alot of transversites. It's like as if that they have become a sex of their own. I am not against them or what. In fact, I am for them. At least, I know that they are transversite.  What is disturbing is that the lesbians crowds have grown larger. I am not against these people either. Is just that you really cant differentiate the straights and the non straights. Is freaky really. I went through my friendster today. I saw that some people I used to know who I tot are straights; are not. Apparently, have not been straight even during the time I know them. Sheesh! See how freaky ignorance can do for you? Ol well.  Today, I went out with JL. Somehow or rather, we were trying to differentiate between the real and the fake ones. The real lady or transversite. Interesting. Seemed to be getting very much harder. How? Who knows manz? Next time, people might think I am the fake product. Then again, not pretty possible. I dun strut like the "the real mcCoy." If I start strutting, please send me to a psyhic doctor please. Hehe. Ol well.  Weird day today. Cutting hair tomolo. AHHHH!!

       Pleasure   Forgiveness. The act of forgiveness is probably one of the greatest acts of ever. Finest example will be of God's forgiveness to us all, sinners, that he gave away his only be gotten son.   I can't think of more finer example in my life other than Mark.(Not comparing myself to God.) Prolly not best mentioned but was inspired to write. Is funny how situations force you to grow up and be the person that you never think you can be. Is just almost amazing how I do not hate him even amidst of whatever had happened. He shattered me into such microscopic pieces. I never dare imagine I am still sitting right here mentioning about him again. Never thought of taking my life. Just that I never think I will survive the ordeal. It had left me jaded but it made me a much stronger person than I already was.   Iregardless of whatever had happened, I realised that as time passed, forgiveness was like something up in the maslow hierachy. Like forgiveness was the highest form of self achievement. You realised that forgiveness come and you feel the load lessen. Suddenly, there's a peace you attained within yourself. It sure took a while but I am glad I felt it.  Never not listened to your parents. They have the wisest advices ever. When they tell you that hatred is more diffcult to bear than forgiveness, believe them and try it for yourself.   Being as human as I can be, I am still learning...

       Pleasure   Makeup. Need to find out who is that smart soul who invented makeup. The person who invented it is brilliant. Honestly, I look like piece of road without makeup. The zits, the dark eye rings and blah blah. Sheesh! What are the few things I can live without for makeup? Concealer! (Thank God for them) Lipstick and blusher. Hehe! The rest are prolly not necessary. So... Hail make up and the inventor! woohoo!

       Pleasure   Good reads. Was reading the papers just now during my brunch session. Touching. Funny. New topics to talk about.  Touching. Was reading the articule about how one can relate to spideyman. Is true isn't it?  Watching the latest new edition of the movie. Peter Parker's life is just very mundane like any of us. He is like any regular joe in town. Amidst the fact that he has to face obstacles in life. At the end, he still faces responsibilities that he has to do. Quoting from spidey movie," With great power comes greater responsibility." I think he did well. I am sure all of us can follow his lead and take life on your own strife. Like the articule in straits written by Danny Fingeroth,"He's not embarrassed by it or ashamed of it, nor should we be of our own striving to be better than we are. It's Spider-Man's greatest superpower. And ours."  Funny. I need to dig out my comics real soon. I need humour to cure this freaking depressing state I am facing. The comic column in straits today is absolutely hilarious. Then again, I think that they might copy it from friends. U know the game scissor, paper and stone? One of the comic strip used rain as part of the game. Friends' episode will show that tomolo Phoebe will use water ballon. Water ballon will win everything. Trust me. Is absolutely hilarious. Hehe. Anyway, Baby blues does the same. Ahhh.. Just grab the God damn papers today.   Topics topics. Tuesday blackout. I was one of the soul (thankfully in whichever sense) that I was not affected by it. I was in the movies. No blackout. No no movie. No no aircon. I mean... how good are the chances manz? Being one of the "brats", I din know until I read that there were people who got stuck in the elevators, met car accidents and well, I am sure some suffered some anxiety distress by it. After reading Sumito's articule, I feel I missed out yet again another historic event in Singapore. Ol well. Never mind ya? Is good to hear people's stories about the blackout. Hehe.   Papers. When it's good, it's sure is a good pleasure.

       Pain/Pleasure   Since God knows when, I started watching the korean drama serial, Winter Sonata. I finally completed today. In fact, just. It nearly drove me nuts. Then again, I cant stopped watching it. Just needed to know what went on and how it ended.   Koreans drama script writers love to stretch out their stories. I wonder if they even know they repeated some of their scenes. Is such a pain to watch really. It can be really ridiculous too. Why would you, in your sanest mind, want to stand out in a blizzering snowing winter night to cry so that no one can hear you? Sheesh. Cry in your room lar. Who will know? Chey!  Plus, their lines are just corny. I laughed quite a bit when my mom is right next to me questioning my basic form of sympathy for such. How to sympathise with people who say lines like,'I wanted to bring you here. To hold your hands, look into your eyes and hope to console you.' Sheesh! Koreans!   Plus plus, they play mopey songs over and over again. Actors and actress only have one expression the whole show. Teary eyes, depressing looks and ya... you get the picture. Impossible manz. But hell, I am just impressed with how they have to cry all the time for the whole show.   Then again, I cant deny that there are some scenes that are really touching. Like this part, when the female lead had to leave that male lead for her stupid ex bf who committed suicide. She said this,'I do not want to say sorry. I dun feel sorry for you. Cos I have already given my heart to you. I love you.' Awwww... that's so sweet, rite?   One thing positive I have to add, Koreans have very good cinematography skills. I love most of their scenes. Especially the part where they filmed the snowy winter scenes of the 2 lovers. Really nice. Beautiful shots. Not only in this serial. If you did catch into the mirror (the movie), you will have enjoyed the cinematography very much too.  In conclusion, korean dramas are a pain to complete. And aggie is just a TV junkie. I watched anything and everything. Laffs. Is gonna be 1st and last, I hope. Nevertheless, I am glad I completed it.   Panada eyes Aggie signing off.

       Pleasure   To overcome my stupid depressive thoughts. I figured I need to get myself organised. Came out with a list of things to do.   1. Save. Seriously, put aside money per month and use it on rainy days.  2. Take a roll of pictures per month and get them developed. Taking pictures make me happy. 3. Treat my parents to a movie/dinner to somewhere new per mth.  4. Get that blardy car license soon. Either that, or to sit the IELTS english paper and pass it and get my arse outta of Singapore. 5. Watch a movie per week.  6. Write at least an entry per week on the blog.  7. Make good use of that gym membership that I have been neglecting. Lose that weight really.   That's quite a bit. Hope to stick to it eventually.   I got 6 pending rolls that need development. Hope the pictures will turn out well. Hope my pay will check in real soon. Sheeesh. Nite.

       Pain   Quoted from a friend,'Misery becomes too familiar that it forms a sense of self.'  The day before my last day. I felt a huge wave of depression. I felt that nothing could ever made me happy. I dun exactly have an explanation for why I was feeling like that. Some think that it's prolly caused I was leaving the familiar grounds. I think it might be true.  Came the day of my actual leaving day, the girls really made a difference to how I was feeling the day before. Made me realised that my presence became worthy. But that moment fades...  I am struggling to live somehow. I felt that humans attribute to what I am feeling. Involved mostly in men. I find I made my life diffcult, unbearable to pass each passing day/hour/min/sec. I am not settling on what will make me happy. I am seeking for something that hurts me and just makes me miserable. I have no explanation on that behaviour.  I feel I need help. I feel I need some kinda of counselling. Someone to tell me what is really wrong with me. Someone that may brainwash me, perhaps? I find I stopped at what I am supposed to be really doing. Time may pass, people may grow but I.... I just stopped. Not wanting to budged. Is this what they call depression?   Is pain but yet the feeling is numb. I wish I can stopped myself from this and move to a higher level soon. Very soon.

       Pleasure   Past, present & future.  Will you allow your past and stop your dreams that you are presently thinking for ur future? I watched 'Whore' just now. Is disturbing but yet the whole way they protrayed the movie. I liked how it began, the progression and how it ended off with everyone stating their dreams.   'Whore' is like a concept of life. How everyone does stuffs for a living. How it can be a sterotyped on what you are doing. Some agree, some dun.  How is a pain to lead life. To survive it. To overcome the pains.  To have dreams to make the realities of life more bearable to go on.  A good catch. Defintely worthy of my $6.50.  I dunno why. Even though, Jemmie was sitting next to me. I kept thinking about him throughout the show. I kept wondering what are his pains to cause his present and hopefully not future. *ponders*  His company is of great pleasure. Feels so at ease, happy and safe.  Want or dun want.....
