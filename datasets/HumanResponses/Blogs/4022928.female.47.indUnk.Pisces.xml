        I'm totally in love with a man who amazes me every minute with his capacity to love me through my MS. And trust me it ain't easy. I spend a lot of time wondering why he loves me, how can he possibly want me and how long will he stay?       A little history: I was finally diagnosed after three years of inconclusive testing and seven months after my divorce was final. One of the many reasons I divorced is because I knew my 'then' husband wouldn't have anything to do with me once it was determined I was ill. Even before we got married he told me that if I got sick he wouldn't leave me. I had nothing to worry about. He wouldn't take care of me but he wouldn't leave me. His words. So as it became more and more clear, lo these many years later, that I was ill in some form. I got rid of him. No way was I going to take of myself and him. And no it wasn't that easy nor that crass, and yes there were other, bigger reasons, but this was definitely in the mix.      Now my 'new' man and I have been together four years the end of August, and almost didn't make it this far. As a matter of fact we've just reconciled after a very nasty blow-up that drove us apart. Somehow we've gotten past the anger and are working our way through the mess. Seems like we've got a good start. The thing that gives us any chance is that, through all of the disaster, I never stopped loving him, and he never stopped loving me.       And my fears remain. The fears I've had from the day we met. In the time we've known each other I've had a number of relapses, some worse than others, and two surgeries. And he's never left my side. He's taken care of me as he cares about me. Somehow he's able to keep them separate most of the time. He waited a long time before he made a commitment to us, he needed to be sure of himself, that he could look at a life of my debilitating. And he has.       And now, as one of my worst fears has come true, he stays and is helping me through this as well. See, one of my MS losses is my ability to feel most things sexual. It has either been pain or no sensation at all. Neither pleasant options. And so as we rebuild and explore a better relationship, once again he's encouraging me to find pleasures in the things that do work. I cry a lot. A LOT. I cry when nothing works, I cry when I feel anything that doesn't hurt, I cry when there's any kind of 'progress'. Now progress is a relative word. But today was a   R  ed   L  etter   D  ay. With much patience and tenderness, I had an orgasm. I cried so hard. It's been a  very  long time. It isn't the same as before, not as intense and just feels 'different'. And it takes a lot of work But it happened. I've tried to find a way to describe what it's like now. Or what the differences are. Some are easy. It's less intense than before but still it's there. It takes more effort and patience. Those are the easy ones. Then there's the rest of it, the nuances and those things have no words. But the best part is that this incredible man has the love, patience and lasting power to make sure that I have every chance. No it doesn't work every time. We know that, but he's still here. At least my ability to please him still works.     So let's see, I'm in a wheelchair, my ability to have sex is fairly limited (though he doesn't suffer from it), I have other bits and pieces that are failing me in slow stages. I have so much guilt about loving him. About his loving me. I so often think he could do much better. Some of that is me, some of it is my MS. K, lots of it is my MS. He's such an active man; camping, fencing, travel. I can do some, support the rest. It isn't that I'm not willing, but he takes such care of me that I sometimes feel that I interfere with the things he wants/would like to do, he worries about me constantly. I've always seen a life with him, but I so very much never want him to resent being with me. And then there's the issue of when things happen to me and he's not there. I feel bad calling him and interrupting whatever he's involved in; work, school, or social. I don't want him coming to see me as needy. (I'm not.) And yet if I don't call him at the time something happens he's upset with me for not. Hard to find a balance there. And no matter how good things are or what reassuring words he has, this is always in the back of my mind. I wish it would go away. He knows about this, and does his best to calm my fears, and I do my best to put them aside. Still it's there ready to threaten my balance. Knowing it's there helps me to quell things before they get in the way. I do my best.     And for now: He loves me, I cherish every moment of it, love him beyond words, and look to a long full life with him.

       I know what I forgot to tell you yesterday. The most pervasive symptom of all – fatigue.  If you don’t suffer from it you don’t know what it is. I’m sorry, but it’s true. I tell people my fatigue is up and they tell me how tired they are too. Not even close. I can have a great night’s sleep and wake up barely able to move because of fatigue. I’ll feel fine. But my body won’t agree.  Let’s see. Think of the day you were the most tired in your life, completely exhausted. Now multiple it by about 100 or so, now you’re coming closer. Still it’s different. My muscles want to respond but they can’t. Just... can’t. Now apply that to other things like breathing and you’ll start to get the idea.  MS does this to you. Medication can too. That’s my problem at the moment. The drug I take for the TN is up a substantial amount and its biggest side effect in me is fatigue. It’s been a frustrating few days. Guess that’s why I started this really. Writing always gives me focus. By the time this gets out to you I’ve worked and reworked it and cleared my head (mostly.)  So today was really going to be about my kids. They’re 19 (girl) and 16 (boy) and we’ve been through a lot together. Take the ‘typical’ teenager, compound it by adding a divorce and then toss in MS. I won’t sugar coat any of it. It was hell on wheels for a while. My daughter went through the usual mom hating stint multipled by some insane factor and her denial for the first year or two of my MS.  I can’t say which kid it was harder on. They approached it so differently.  For my daughter the MS was rough because we’d done everything together for all of her life, including Girl Scouts – you know, hiking, camping, cookie sales. I’d been healthy and active and that changed very quickly. Add to this, I was diagnosed the same year her dad and I divorced and she hit her teens full blast – hormones and all, and she was a terror. Things got worse for a few years and I wasn’t sure we would survive it. And then she grew up. You’d be proud to know her, I know I am. And one of the nice side effects (yes, there are good ones, just usually not with medication) is that she’s become active in my healthcare. It’s been hard for her at school and out of state. But when she’s home, she goes to the doctor with me and my tests when she can. She wants to know all the details and to be a part of my support system. We talk. We talk a lot about everything. I love that we're friends again.  My son took it all differently. He was young and angry with his dad, so he became my protector. It was sweet but worried me some. I didn’t want him to not be a kid cuz he felt I needed help. Six years ago this was all adjustment. A diagnosis without any idea of what it really meant. What that caring has done is to make him a strong and compassionate young man. Now, he wants to know what’s going on, but less is more, he doesn’t need all the details unless they’re important to know, like what my meds are and their dosages. He’s gone a lot of the time. He’s 16, what do you expect?! And getting him to help around the house is like pulling teeth. But he makes sure I know where he is (usually) and when I’m really bad he pops in every now and then to check on me. He’ll be around more once school starts as his sister will be gone again. They seemed to have worked it out between them. I don’t think they talk about it much. I know they worry a lot.  I try to be strong for them, but I’ve learned that it’s ok to have a bad day, to cry, to be frustrated or scared. That was hard to accept for myself. But sometimes I’ll walk in the door and just sit down and cry. One or the other or both will come and just sit with me, put their arms around me and be still. God, how did I get so lucky? That's not to say we don’t have our moments. But they’re normal (is there any such thing?) teenage moments, not 'Oh my God, my mom has MS' moments.      We constantly learn new ways to make things work. We talk. In truth, I think that having MS has helped to keep communication open through these years where so many families struggle.

       Welcome back. I thought I’d start here today giving you a little bit of information about MS. It’s an auto immune disease that attacks the neurological system. It is not contagious, it affects men and women and there is no cure. The treatments that are available are only band aids. They help to boost the body’s system but can’t stop a relapse from happening. The best they can do is to help limit the length and maybe the damage.  With MS everything on the vague side. This disease affects each one differently. There are some common factors but the results are completely individual.  For me it predominantly affects my left leg. At least that’s the most obvious symptom to the world. It’s weaker than the rest of me. At it’s worst I use a wheel chair and at my best you can’t tell there’s anything wrong except that I have a very slight limp. I also have something called Trigeminal Neuralgia. Not everyone with MS gets TN and not everyone that has TN has MS. It’s a severely painful affliction that can be controlled by medication. Of course the side effects of the drugs cause their own problems and that’s a story of its own. Then there are the other things that I relegate as lesser, though they really aren’t, just not so apparent. I have diminished tactile sensation. I can feel the pressure of a touch, but not always the gentleness of it; often in varying degrees. Three years ago I had a single episode of double vision that only lasted a few hours, thank God. I was terrified. Vision is often affected for those with MS, I’ve been lucky. I have two points on my body that suffer from pain, but we’re learning how to protect them.  In 1992 I had my first distinct MS attack. It began as numbness on the right side of my face. You know the feeling of novacaine as it wears off? Just like that. Sometimes just a patch and other times affecting the whole side of my head. High blood pressure runs in my family as does stroke. So who do you turn to? Mom, of course. We went to the ER, afraid this was a precursor to stroke. All the scans came back clear and the doctor’s parting diagnosis was that I was either suffering from migraine or MS and that the best thing I could do was eliminate stress from my life. Yeah, right. Though still married at the time, we were dirt poor and my 2 kids weren’t in school yet.  And then that was it. Gone. No more numbness. Hmmmm. So I forgot about it and went on with my life. I seemed a little clumsier than before. I stumbled and fell every few months, but I never linked it to anything. And then five years later new and steady symptoms started.  I was tested for everything: HIV, metabolic disorders, anemia, the list was incredibly long. Everything came back negative. In the meantime I was doing my own research and figured out it was probably MS. I finally hooked up with my first neurologist. He washed his hands of me after only a couple visits cuz I wanted answers and I wasn’t a clear cut case. The next one ran tests from checking my reflexes to a spinal tap. Everything, and I do mean everything, came back borderline. Still no diagnosis. Finally I had an attack that took me off my feet, literally. The common response to a relapse is steroids: Solumedrol IV, a daily dose (3-5 days) of a gram by IV. The purpose of this pounding of steroids is to shut down the immune system. No immune system, no auto immune attack. It was decided that if I responded to the IV then it was MS and if I didn’t then we still didn’t know. It worked.  By the time you get on the treatment, the attack has done it’s damage. The drugs are just to shut it down sooner. After the IV part is done you get switched to Prenisone. Until this relapse the course of Prednisone was always three weeks. (My kids have learned to stay out of trouble and away from me.) This time I had a 3 day course of the IV treatment and my current neurologist gave me a six day pack and I was done. There was so much relief around here I can’t even tell you. Steroids are notorious for their negative affects on your mood.  So in the last six years the kids and I have learned our way through. We deal with MRI results, some hard decisions and after much trial and error, we’re now a team. They are amazing, but more on them another time.

        So you've landed here. Welcome. My name is Sue and despite what I'm told about my looks I really do have teenagers. I'm a single mom. I work full-time. I love a wonderful man. Oh, yes, and I have MS. That's multiple sclerosis, for those of you that don't know. It's a chronic and debilitating disease that spends most of it's time frustrating the hell out of me.  It's July 2004 and I've just had my first relapse in two years. For those of you who don't know anyone with MS and even if you do, you might read through the days here and see what it's like from the inside. Odds are, unless you live with the person, you don't really know what's going on. 'How are you?' is always answered with 'Fine.' or 'It's a slow day.' Which tells you nothing.  I'm nothing special, no different from anyone else. But unlike many others I want people around me to know I'm disabled and why. The better educated people are, the more normal they'll treat me and the better they may know what to do if something happens to me.  span >The fast lane is all relative. I have days that I feel great and am really moving down the hallway with my walker and a coworker will fly by walking backwards to apologize about the hurry they're in and how that this is their normal pace. My response, and it's most often the truth, is that my current pace is running - for me. We laugh and off they go. No matter how good I feel, how good a mood I'm in, how happy I am that I'm on my feet this day, how well I know I'm doing - there is ALWAYS the memory that I used to walk that way too. It isn't a sadness really, just a memory that I used to be normal.  My MS didn't hit until 1992 and then wasn't recognized. Medicine has come a long way. I was finally diagnosed in 1999 and then only by accident. Doctors do NOT want to label you. With MS you're never in remission and you'll never be cured. Can't blame the docs really, but if they'd made some decisions sooner, treatment could have started sooner. All water under the bridge now. Ok, I could blather on here for quite some time, but I'll leave you with this for now. I'll be back, hope you will too.span>

       I have a stomache ache. So what, you might say - I would. But I have a stomach ache every time I eat these days. I'm hoping it's just the way my nerves and the the gamma knife are manifesting themselves. That and the fact that my son is coming home Sunday. I've missed him and can't wait to hear about his adventures. Still, there's some anxiety about telling him that I've brought the dreaded boyfriend back into my life.  I have a feeling it's gonna be a rough week. But my daughter surprised me, maybe the boy will too. I didn't give her enough credit so maybe I'm shortchanging him as well. I want him to understand that the circumstances are different, better and that I'm happy. I want him to understand that we will do all we can not to "inflict" our relationship on him if that's important, and that I respect him and his needs. I just want him to respect mine too.     I'm sure it won't be nearly as bad as I fear. Still, I'm afraid it might just be. I think I'm more worried about that than I am about the gamma knife itself. Ah well. Things will work out. They always do.

       The gamma knife is coming none to soon. I had a spike of pain a couple weeks ago. So of course they upped my meds. After a few days we tapered them back down and the pain is fine back at my original level, but it's totally screwed up my balance and is messing with my vision. I can see, but for close work like reading I really have to focus. The fatigue is affecting my eyes and the muscles need some encouragement to focus on the close stuff. It's not a problem per se, just really annoying.       I know we expect good things from this surgery, but I'm anxious. The last time I had results within a couple weeks. The norm is three months. I'm working at setting my mind for the three month mark this time. That's a little discouraging, but it's the reality. So I'm getting there. I am so looking forward to getting out of the wheelchair. Actually the goal is to dance. That's what I really miss. So even if it's in my living room to whatever's on the radio, it'll be in his arms and I'll be able to move with him. There are no words to explain what that means to me. And we won't wait this time. Last year, during the short window of 'normal' I had we put this off. We'd been invited to a wedding and were planning to make that our  time . Then he got sick, I mean really sick, hospital sick. I was disappointed, sure, but really just concerned and worried about him. He was just mad, no I think furious or livid is more like it. He's fine now, but it wasn't too long after that the TN came back, the drugs started and I couldn't walk again. So it never happened.      He tells me to dream big. To plan and look forward to all the things I'll be able to do again. Me? I just want to move across the floor in his arms, cheek to cheek, music, candlelight. Sure, there are other things to look forward to, like grocery shopping, travel, mowing the lawn. But for me it's dancing. Good, old fashioned, in his arms dancing.      In the meantime, I'm just waiting. I've talked to both the kids and they're totally on board. My son is in Europe and I wasn't too sure about telling him while he's gone (didn't want him worrying about things that don't need worrying) but we've talked in the past about what he wants to know and when to tell him. I told him and it was the right thing to do. He's fine and off to Scotland. My daughter is just glad it should be done before she's off to school. So I have a small window of time to get this done. After he's home (in another week) and before she leaves for school. And best of all I have a doctor that understands the importance of this to me. He and his staff are doing everything they can to make this happen.

       I didn't realize how anxious I was about today's trip to the doctor. I was scared. But I was also prepared. I had my list of questions.       It started with the usual recapping of what I'd done for the last three months and that my neurologist has said - we're just gonna say I'm allergic to trileptal (suits me), and that we've basically run through the pharmaceutical options. There isn't anything else I can take that isn't going to have some side effect that's as bad or worse than what I've got now. So today we went over the other options. Two of them are surgical and one of those is brain surgery! Yipes!! And then there's a repeat of the Gamma Knife. It isn't done a lot for TN, at least not by this MD, but he is fairly selective about who he'll do a repeat on. So here I am.       I'm tentatively set for two weeks from today. That will be confirmed early next week. The nice thing about this procedure is that recovery is only a couple of days. It's an overnight hospital stay and then another day and you're set. You just have to be conscious about the four holes in your head from the halo they use to lock you in to the gamma knife machine. It was pretty traumatic the last time. I mean you know it's gonna hurt to have them put four bolts in your skull, but man, it was more than I ever could have imagined. Though in truth it wasn't the bolts it was the shots of lidocaine that were the killer. Funny how the pain killer hurt so much. Can't say it hurt more than the bolts, cuz I couldn't feel them, so I guess it did its job. This time I'll have a touch of versed. Just enough to get me through that part. I'm ok after it's done and set. Think I'll treat myself to a new CD just for this. You can bring your own music to listen to. It's helps to pass the time. You're locked into the machine so your head doesn't move. The rest of you can move a bit, which is good, but your head has to be locked in. You don't want the radiation hitting the wrong spot. For me and this procedure, it's 2 back to back sessions 40 minutes each. It can get pretty boring, but good music helps. Plus it's a measure of how much longer you have to go.      The biggest issue I really face right now is scheduling. I want to do it as quickly as I can, but I have to wait for my son to come home from Europe and it still has to be done before my daughter goes back to school, especially since she wants me to take her. It isn't like I don't want to make everyone happy, but sometimes I just can't do it. So here's hoping that 8/19 is a go. One less thing to worry about.

       Okay, so you have some general background on my life, MS and some of the peripherals. Now on to the daily things of life.      I finally lost the round with the Chicago weather. I collapsed last night from the heat and my own stupidity. I haven't been drinking enough water and was most likely too dehydrated. I'm some better today, but still feeling the effects. Or maybe I'm just feeling stressed about tomorrow.       I'm back to the neurosurgeon. Last year, in February, I had a radiosurgical procedure called Gamma Knife. It was to treat my trigeminal neuralgia. I was so heavily drugged to control it that I not only couldn't work; I couldn't walk, control my bodily functions, read, watch tv or a number of other normal things. For those of you that know meds, I was on a daily regimen of 3600mg of Neurontin, 1950mg of Trileptal and 15mg of Baclofen. Life sucked. Life wasn't life. I needed 24 hour care cuz I wasn't clear headed enough to take care of myself or let alone remember when to take each of these  wonderful  drugs. Then came the chance for Gamma Knife. It wasn't an easy choice. It's radiation near the brain. But it was my first choice of options. And the thing is that it worked. I was pain free and, after a few months of being weaned off the drugs, drug free. I could walk. No wheels, no walker, no cane. Just my own two feet. It was the first time in 3 years that I was drug free. I had a life again. And then two days before Thanksgiving it came back and with a vengeance.       Trigeminal Neuralgia is neurological pain that affects the face. For me it's the lower left jaw. And when it hits it knocks me to the floor, even if I'm sitting. I scream: loud. They put me back on the one drug I shouldn't take. It controls the pain but it robs me of my mobility. Almost immediately I was back to using my walker. It was downhill from there. After not being able to get my 'then' neurologist to switch me off Trileptal I switched doctors. The new one switched me right away to Tegretol. This is a drug we know I can tolerate. It has it's own side effects and they are less then stellar (thanks, dear - his word). So I'm able to function, but still not terribly mobile. So now it's back to the neurosurgeon to see if I'm a candidate for a second go round.       I'm apprehensive cuz I don't know what to expect. If I'm a candidate are the risks too great for me to consider it? And if I'm not a candidate then what next? See, I'm will to accept that this may be as good as it gets, but not yet. I will not go down without a fight. Not now, not ever. So, I'm keeping busy. I'm making my list of questions for tomorrow and trying to be prepared.

       Ok, so I'm one of the lucky ones. I love my job. The people I work with range from ok to really good, with the rare pill drifting through.  But it definitely wasn't always this way. I've had the boss from hell. I've had to remind people about the ADA and FMLA with a baseball bat: and amazingly enough, I work for a healthcare organization.  When I was first diagnosed I worked with clinical people so there was a lot of understanding that I couldn’t walk but my brain still worked. Then I transferred to an administrative department and faced a rude awakening. Just because it was healthcare didn’t mean that everyone who works here has a clue. So, I made a decision. I was going to be a one woman education division. After people got over the initial shock of the walker or wheelchair and realized I was probably still me (I mean they wouldn’t even say hi to me) I started talking. One on one I told them I had MS, explained what that is and what it means, and went about proving that I could still do my job. My immediate manager was the most difficult person I’ve still come across. The bottom line was he didn’t want to know anything, and he didn’t want to make any exceptions for me. I really think he would have fired me if he could. Now I don’t ask for special treatment, but I do expect working conditions I can function in, and that FMLA will be honored. Luckily his boss was all about understanding what my limitations could be and making sure that I was treated fairly. He even worked with HR to make sure that both the department and I were treated fairly. All okay by me. Anyway, boss one was transferred and boss two was great. Boss three, the current one, was previously a co-worker and has seen it all with me over the last 3+ years so it’s good here too. I travel between over 15 sites, wheeling through the various buildings, and though I haven’t met everyone in the organization (5000+), for the areas that I deal with if we haven’t met they’ve often heard of me and the acceptance is far greater. People who don’t know, may or may not ask, I’m never offended and always glad to explain.  As for the people I work with on a daily basis… now, I’m treated like anyone else. I travel out of town for topic specific training. People smile and wave or call out as we move down the hallways. They know I can manage most of the doors but if they’re close by they’ll just grab it for me (many of our doorways are not exactly maneuverable). It’s really nice. I look forward to getting to work. My position is challenging and my surroundings are supportive. What more could I ask for?
