       No this isn't a rant, just a little word of advice. Before you get caught up in all this political crap about the war, gas prices, and who did what back in Vietnam, make sure you know what effects you personally. What I mean is that people rally around a new subject, one that is interesting enough to talk about the next day at the water cooler and lose sight of issues like what can I do to be more productive at work, or what can I learn today that might prove to be useful in the future.   For example, the abuse of prisoners in the Iraq, sure the 7 or so people who did it messed up. They shouldn't have done those things and they should be punished, but to drag it out like Donald Rumsfield or President Bush took the pictures is a damn waist of time and money. Punish the people who did it, but don't make excuses. Some people are just like that. Mean, cruel, and sadistic. It was no one else’s fault other than there own.   Ok so it was a little rant.

       This Sunday it was about the dogs. I was home alone enjoying some music and drinking a red generic fruit flavored liquid. For some reason red liquid tastes better than the red fruit we all know and love.   Anyway like I said it was the dog's day. You know I would rather be with my dogs than damn near any one else I know. Why aren’t dogs allowed to go to work with people. Well not all dogs and sure as hell not all people.   Just the dogs that want to lie at their master's feet. And masters that know how to judge which dogs will stay there all day.   I use the word "master" loosely.   Up and down the yard Sam ran. See Sam run. See Sam jump. See Sam role around in carrion.  You've got to see the pics I took. Check out the slideshow link.

       You know when you get to work and you get this feeling that your day will be unproductive? Well it was one of those days. "Be at the office at 8:00am." He said. But later on yesterday evening, "Lets meet at 9:00 instead." That was the first sign.   When I get there this morning Randy says "So what are we doing today?" like I know. "Ah well didn't Gerry give you any idea?" I knew full well that if Randy didn't know Gerry never spoke to him about it.   So it begins.  Well we spent the day, up to 1:00pm that is, sorting out screws, cleaning satchels, and separating wall palates into different groups. So what's your job then you may ask? Ah well lets just say picking through a thousand screws and placing each group into an old tackle box isn't un heard of, just not my specialty.

       You know when you're broke, and I mean really broke and you see say nice house. And lets just say you get to walk around in it and every time you look at a specific object you're like "I can't even afford to by that, and these people have all kinds of other shit I couldn't buy. Damn there's an economic gap here." Doesn't that suck. I know they earned it and I haven't YET but I want it all now. People say you can't buy happiness or love. Bullshit Stuff makes me happy. I just like nice things. That's happiness to me.   Actually you know what happiness is to me. Being able to have everything you own work or look at its best. I have a nice car, but a head light is out and the traction control system doesn't work. Now I could get both fixed for about $400 but that's my part of the house payment or that's cable, Internet, cell phone, gas shit not much gas now a days, all kinds of other stuff I need and I do mean need. So I have a nice car ok I also have a house. Sure it's nice too but they’re is a broken window above the door, the floors need to be refinished, our dryer takes like 4 hours just to dry a pair of pants and a shirt. To get all this working, all my material positions working would make me so happy and in turn takes money. See money can buy happiness using the transitive property that is.
