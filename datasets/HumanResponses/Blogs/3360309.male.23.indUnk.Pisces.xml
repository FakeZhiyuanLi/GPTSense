      So I am sitting here at work on a beautiful southern california Saturday afternoon. Life is beautiful. At least the outside is, the inside in here really does suck.  I have tons of movies to catch up with, theater wise its Shrek 2, Troy and Van Helsing. The summer season has offically began. Needs to catch up!  On the DVD front, I also have tons to want - I recently purchased the Samurai Triology Box Set with Mr Mifune. Also got some rentals in the form of probaly crappy Torque, The Penn's 21 Grams.  But the damn TiVo has ruined my life. I hate you TiVo. Been watching too much Futurama and Family Guy, why those shows were cancelled must be to complex for my feeble mind to understand.   My thought for today, why do alot ( I refuse to say most, which might actually be the right choice here but I will not say it) of people have no patience whatsoever? Co-workers, cilents, drivers on the road, family members, yourself, everybody?   Do we really value time THAT much? Everybody has their own limit of patience but some(alot) have none and in the end it is kinda funny. Making your route 10 seconds longer or the such because somebody brakes in front of you and has to make a right(or left) thus you have to wait until the driver turns before you can proceed is not going to kill you. Just chill!  Just my random rant for today.   Ray

      Ok lets see whats on tap..  Dwayne Wade is a freaking pimp but how in the hell is not IN the game for the last play. So what if you doesn't shoot the pointer well, he is the best clutch player on the team and owned in the 4th quarter. At least have him out there on the court!!!!  I'm still waiting for the Angels to stumble, but they pull out a 11th inning win from a guy who gets his first hit. A 3 hitter against the freaking Yankees. Um, Ok. Bring on the playoffs and our starters!!!  I,Max. I am talking about Max Kellerman. On ESPN I liked him a bit, Around the Horn was ok, but his talking about Boxing (My favorite sport) is what I really liked about him. Rarely do you have young sports guys talking non-stop about boxing. But this show sucks! I,Max sucks! No premise whatsoever right now, PTI, Around the Horn and Rome is Burning are on a different level.  Bring on the Game 7s...  Ray

      Couple of recent movies I have viewed in the last week via Netflix....   Lost in Translation   A solid movie for what it was, I think I just couldn't relate to the material. I haven't experienced not nearly enough of what Murrary's character went through, and I just can't relate to the other because, well... I'm not a girl. Still solid though.    In America   Kinda weird movie, a bit childish in its acting and situations but then we are talking about a 2 year old dropping down stairs having a tumor. But a VERY VERY engaging movie that will move you.    Fog of War   I was riveted by this movie and it probaly needs more analysis by me because it deserves alot of attention. Just to think these events really haven't been THAT long. And for 85 this guy is still very sharp.    Murder on a Sunday Morning   Another essential viewing. Most have never seen this great doc but go out and watch it.   On tap for movie watching -  Triplettes of Belleville, Peter Pan, Miracle and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly .   All movies are viewed for the first time   Ray

      Ok first topic,     What the hell happened here?  In a flash, the greatest fighter of our time now seems pretty mediocre. Or that what is everybody saying.   The guy got hit solid and went down and lost. Period. It happens to fighters. The great Ali got knocked down by another picture perfect left hook by Frasier.   Tarver deserves more credit then he is getting right now, "Did Roy overlook him?" "Is RJJ old, past his prime?" etc... Maybe Tarver is that good. Sure he only landed 7 punches in 2 rounds, the fact is he gave him trouble in his loss in the first fight and came back and knocked him out and gave RJJ his first *REAL* loss.   Still, RJJ is great and hopefully we will see more of him. Maybe RJJ -vs- Tarver III.  The Spurs and company suck!  Plain and simple, defending world champions up 2-0 and blow 4 straight. Forget the miracle shots in game 5, it should have not even come to that. Tony Parker needs to practice his outside shot because his countless air-balls or near air balls were a little embarrassing.   TiVo is the king.  Boy what an incredible world we live in, in terms of technology. Forget Netflix now, TiVo has dominated my life.  Thats it for now, next up is some Movie reviews and such.  Ray
