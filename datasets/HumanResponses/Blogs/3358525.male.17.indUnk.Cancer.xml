      A worldwide survey was conducted by the UN. The only question asked was: "Would you please give your honest opinion about solutions to the food shortage in the rest of the world?"  The survey was a huge failure...  In Africa they didn't know what "food" meant. In Eastern Europe they didn't know what "honest" meant. In Western Europe they didn't know what "shortage" meant. In China they didn't know what "opinion" meant.  In the Middle East they didn't know what "solution" meant. In South America they didn't know what "please" meant. And in the USA they didn't know what "the rest of the world" meant

      Smoothing down the ironing board Spray some starch, unpack your sword   In the leather swivel chair Do it with a twirling flair   Would you like it in a truck? Grab the wheel, start to suck   Or how about a minivan If alone, just use one hand   Would you like it in a pool? Six feet deep, that's the rule   Or how about a frozen lake Cut a hole, use a stake   How about a lion's den Daniel's got it up again   Or in the Valley of the Kings Look at those Egyptian things!   Some like it in a closet bare Angora sweater or pubic hair?   A gritty sandbox is always fine To give yourself a darn good time   Or try a casket, there's a place But wipe the ashes off your face   Even bridges have their charm Though passing cars may cause alarm   In the field, on the green You can be a sex machine   Or in a seashell by the shore Go and go till you're feeling sore   Some want it on a silver platter Spread those tits with pancake batter   Or in a well, that's a joy Fill the bucket with your toy   I like it in a shopping cart Secure the seat before you start   Or stretched across the railroad track Hump her good and don't look back   How about a tortoise shell Show your head, ring her bell   Or on a bed of coals galore That will never be a bore   I think it's best to quit the bed To go outside, try the shed   Or gambol to the piggy sty And find yourself a place to lie   A place to fuck, someday there'll be And we will do it happily   We'll do it on an island nice That will add a little spice   Or in a rowboat by the pier Let it rip, don't try to steer   The thing I think is best of all May be the thing you most appall   But try it all, be omnivore Today pristine, tomorrow whore!

      What is a slut? Is it a girl that likes to have sex a lot? Is it a girl that likes to have sex for money? Or is it a girl who would rather cheat on friends, and go around with other guys, not telling the other? You can make a decision once you're through reading this. So this girl i know, tells 2 of her guy friends that she wants to do stuff with one and go out with the other. Does that make her a slut? Nah. She goes to a school parking lot the same night, and does shit with a third guy. Does that make her a slut? Who knows, but i do know one thing. Friends are always there for you, theyre there during the good, the bad and the ugly. They support you when you need them, cry with you when you're sad, and smile with you when you laugh. What's the difference between that, and 'just another guy'? Another guy will be with you and care about you (you being your body). He could get you pregnant, leave and never look back. Leaving friends to look after you and feel bad for you. So what makes someone a slut? When you practically screw around or plan to with three different guys in one day, get caught and try to deny it afterwards and say you're sorry. Friends deserve better than that, and when you lose those friends, it's just too late to see how important they really were to you. What goes around comes around.  If you don't teach yourself the right way, Life will teach you the hard way.

      Written on: Monday, November 10, 2003   To the point. Boredom is one thing that not many people can cope with very well. It could lead from twitching ur knee back and forth, to going online,  to just plain old sleeping. Why has the internet grown so big? Well, lots of people out there get bored, so when they dont have anything to do they dont have a choice but to go online and chat or surf, or anything else that floats ur boat. Boredom can even lead to  crazy things such as writing this... this piece of writing. Anyways, on to things more interesting. So maybe this isn't exactly interesting, but one thing that really makes me mad is how sometimes im bored, but im doing something. an example would be walking down the hallway in school or doing the garbage around marshall fields where i work. Sometimes i think of these really crazy things, and its all so weird and so complex i can barely understand it. But then, when ireally think about it, it all makes sense. The thing that really sucks about that part, is that when i wanna type out some  of this crazy ass shit on my mind, i cant seem to pierce it together. Call me dumb for writing this in the first place. But what do you care, most people know me for rabling on and on about nothing, i might talk for 10 minutes and look back to remember everything i just said, and it was nothing. I just talked in circles. I'm pretty random, and i have no idea why. Why do people act the way they act? A really fun thing to do, is just sit during lnch or class or wherever you are. And just observe how one acts and reacts. No i dont recommend stalking, or staring im talking about analyzing the persons actions, reactions and facial expressions to find out whothey are, and what theyre like. The really scary part about this, is that once you see through that person, you can totally predict them and its almost sickening the way they seem so fake. Im not stating any names, this is all a generality. A lot of times, i act like im a total noob, like im just concentrating on some stupid little thing like a pen, but in reality ur just listening to everyone around you. After a while, people just think that ur not very attentive, or that you dont listen, and they say things in front of you. Expecting you not to hear anything since you never do anyways. That can comes as an advantage. Society these days got to the point thats also sickening. You cant complement someone without being punched or kicked because theyre so sure youre using sarcasm. If you go up to a girl and complement here; whether it be clothes or something physical, you're automatically labeled as a perv or someone who likes them and youre immediately ignored and never talked to again. Whats the point of that? Do you have to go out with someone  just to complement them? Have people gotten to the point where no one can be positive otherwise theyre fags or freaks with no life?  When people have conversations, you cant have a conversation about anything, otherwise its 'boring'. You tell them how your actually was they really dont give a shit. When people talk to each other they only talk about the 'super cool exciting' things that happened to them. Lots of people dont have anything exciting because they lead normal to not so good lives. Some people cant control it, although a few of these losers will get to the point where they will lie just so they can stand a little higher in social standards. Its sickening. I absolutely hate people who lie, and im pretty good at finding out who does. There is no reason to lie, if youre ashamed of yourself youre better off comitting suicide or just plain moving elsewhere where the loser ratio is much higher and you can feel better about yourself. If youre sad, ugly, fat, uncool, boring, GET OVER IT. I could seriously make a nice living out of getting a shiny new quarter every time i see a fat chick wearing tight clothes (whats the point of this? People will just  totally ignore you and not look at you. Stretch marks are NOT a turn on. Ur better off wearing eskimo coats and a brown bag and people might actually talk to you for who you are.) Im also sick of seeing people calling each other gay, or fags. Whats the point of that? I hate gay people, and if somebody says im gay or says it to anyone else it just doesnt make sense. U tell the person they dont like women, they like men instead. What is that proving? If theyre gay, its not theyre fault. Being gay is a mental illness that should be treated with medication. Seriously, you think humans were constructed so they can get it up the ass? No. All murderes and rapists and pedophiles and gay people all have a mental illness.  Whether this mental illness holds them for having pity or remorse is anyones guess. If you say someone is gay, youre not proving anything. Youre showing youre the weaker man by nondirectly demonstrating that you need to put them down to make yourself better. In the end of it all, youre not the one  whos superior. Like i said before, get over it. Same thing with posers. Everybody has their style, if you wanna go and wear abercrombie or just sk8er stuff all the time,  it doesnt make you a poser. If you dont skate and wear skate clothes it doesnt make you a poser. It is showing that you probably have appreciation for the skating community and that you like the clothes. Same as me, i wear the clothes i think are confortable, cool, and good looking at the same time. Otherwise there really is no point in wearing it in the first place. Now, people who dont deserve credit for anything are the ones who say thewyre all that.  Example: a sk8er who says he can do lots of tricks but really cant. One like him doesnt even dserve to be called a poser. Someone like him is just a plain liar. If youre not accepted, get over it and get new friends. Last, and definitely not least, theres goths. Why do all theatre people and others wear black clothes. Youre misunderstood? why dont you wear yellow instead? You like the dark? Stay at home or anything that fancies you.  I dont understand people walking around with rags and patches so they look different. I dont think they wear it because its confortable.  Last time i checked safety pins werent confortalbe at all. The only thing these people really want, is attention. Everyone loves attention, which leads to lying.Goths act all depressed for attention too. Why would you ever tell people you wanna kill yorself. Why would you wanna do that in the first place? If you commited suicide you really deserved it. Suicide shows your pitiful self worth, and the lack of mind over body, and it also shows a weak minded person. People just dont have culture these days. And no, i dont mean this in some loser, pansy way. I mean culture as in who you  are and what you do with your life. An uncountable amount of people dont know who they are. They are someone the people they know wants them to be. Most mature out of it, and look back at how stupid they were. Other people wont ever get it, and will stay that way and probably live with their parents and their local friends until theyre 30. And then there is sex. The one topic people just feel unconfortable to talk about, or have too much to talk about. what makes someone perverted? Is that really a bad thing? Why do women act so random at times, i dont know. There isnt an answer for all questions i hate to say. If a guy gets laid, its hooray for him, probably a few days of sore ass for the g/f. But its hooray for her too.. more or less. The guys buddies congratulate him and think much higher of him. The girls also think higher of the guy. But it doesnt work both ways. If a girl gets laid, it doesnt matter how good looking the guy is, she will be called a slut by her friends, and a slut by the guys who know her. People just dont get it. Its not that big of a deal, if you get laid it doesnt make you any bettewr than you were before. Its just a matter of experiencing something different. People shouldnt be considered all that just because they can get some, they should be looked up upon, if they  can have a woman respect him for who he is. And many times, depending on the woman, it is almost impossible.Another thing that sickens me, is that people go to the extent of lying to people and saying theyve done things. Why? Why were they driven to the point to actually lie for something so little, yet so big when other people hear about it. Another thign thats stupid, is when a person say they did it, and only half of those people believe them. Why shouldnt we beleive them? Because theyre ugly? Ugly people have almost a higher chance to have sex than good looking people do. Ugly people can get skanks and get laid lots of times. better looking people have to deal with the whole relationship part about it. The horrible thing is, lots of women really do enjoy having sex, but they cant let anyone know, or they might lead to a private life just so their peers dont consider them whores or sluts. If theyre not selling their bodies, its not a bad thing. Girls like to have sex as much a sguys do. Its amatter of how the girl will have to deal with her peers (male and female) after its happened. Over half of high school kids will have sex by the time they graduate, even though over 40% will have done it illegally.  The meaning of life in natures terms is to reproduce. So why have a law against it, and why do people make a such big fuss about it. I dont get that much. People piss me off, and its just sickens me. To be continued later, i need sleep. - posted by Pedro @ 10:30 PM    ps. rambling is fun

      Actually written on Saturday, November 08, 2003  Well then... I've always seen these around and I always felt like doing one. Except i was too lazy to do it and I was waiting until I reformatted and got my server and the dcms site up (Here) Eventually i plan on integrating the dcms/server with this blogger thing and everytime i post a blog it posts on dcms. I'm too lazy to do that now, plus I gotta work soon. The main thing I'll be doing here is either posting news/insteresting crap that no one cares about plsu whatever else I wanna talk about. K, well this was kind of a practice post. (for all the ones who know me as one name or the other, ill make it clear: (pedro = darkmage = spiralspektrum) - posted by Pedro @ 10:30 PM
