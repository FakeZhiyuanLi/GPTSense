       The Countdown Begins   Well, it's one week until I leave the country...omigod!  I'm totally freakin'!! (Oh, before I forget, I must warn you about something if you are going to read my blog - I love exclamation points!!!  I use them...lots!)   Tonight is my last night at one of my jobs, The Improv Asylum.  Tomorrow is my last night at another one of my jobs, Jeannette Neill Dance Studio.  And Monday is my last day at job number 3, Borders Books.  It's wierd, I haven't been without work since I was 15 and I started washing dishes at the golf club by my house, and now I'm leaving all of my jobs at the same time.  I'm very excited to have all of that extra room in my brain for things that are important to me personally, instead of things like when the RPL (recommended pull list) is due at Borders, which workstudy keeps putting the trash in the wrong place, or the price of a dinner package for two at Mother Anna's.  (It's $100 by the way, plus a $2 service charge if you order over the phone.  A VERY good deal for a 3-course meal and an award-winning comedy show, you should check it out!)  Now I can concentrate on living in Europe and becoming snooty..."wearing black and speaking French for no reason"!  I'll give a dollar to anyone who names that movie quote!    What else??  Nothing really exciting is happening because I'm not there yet.  Right now I'm just dealing with the bagillion last minute things that all of my friends who have travelled warned me about.  I never dreamt it would be this hard to leave the country!!!    So, my first blog entry wasn't that interesting.  What do you expect?  I'm at work right now finishing up my last night!  I had to stop writing a couple times to fix a ticket error, get late people into the show, and fix the flush handle on the toilet in the mens room.  (Wow, I can't WAIT to leave!)  So, no worries, these entries are sure to get more interesting...so stay tuned...

       The DAM!!!   Yay!!  I went to Amsterdam last weekend!!  It is gorgeous.    I started to write about it earlier this week, but had to stop in the middle of my post and tried to save it as a draft...no dice, so I have to start over, which sucks because...  Right now, I am going on 3 hours sleep!! (one of my roommates has a slight log-sawing problem)  We are leaving for London at 7:00 am, so this blurb has to happen...please excuse me if I am a little punchy!  First, of course, a little history:  Once upon a time there was a river of Amstel (yes, Amstel, like the beer, except it wat-ter.  It's almost the weekend, people, just stay with me.)  People wanted to live by the Amstel, but the land was below sea level.  This was a bummer.  What do you think they did?  No, Matty T., they didn't drink the river of Amstel!!  They built a DAM!!  Get it?!  Amstel....DAM!  Now, I don't know how many of you have heard Dutch, it's a peculiarly beautiful language, but pronouncing the 'LD' is not so easy...so it evolved to an 'RD'.  Amsterdam!    YAY!  Good story, Liza!  Yes, I know you all oved it.  You have my permission to retell it at parties.  So, Amsterdam, as I said before, is GORgeous!  Along with the dam, the Dutch people, clever as they are, built canals.  Amsterdam consists of 5 (I think) canals which are concentric half circles that move out from Dam Square, the center of the city.  The oldest architecture, in the center circle, dates to the medieval period.  ALL of the architecture in the city is amazing.  So...what did I do there??  Friday we went to the Rijksmuseum, mostly Medieval through Romantic...LOTS of Rembrandt, whose innovative techniques are mindblowing to see in person.  Friday night, they took all 82 of us out for Indonesian food, then the Music History students went to a concert.  Beethoven's 4th and Tchaikovski's 4th, performed by the ConcertGebeouwOrkestra.  Saturday, the Van Gogh museum...wow, I don't even know what to say here.  I don't think I  need  to say anything, I mean, it's Vincent Van Gogh!  Then we walked around...a LOT!  We had great weather and the city is full of quirky little shops.  Walked through the Red Light District...it definitely almost induced reverse paristalsis. (head to dictionary.com if that one threw you for a loop)  My roommate and I then split from our group and headed over to the Anne Frank House.  Wow...I cried...I read that book for the first time when I was in 6th grade or something, and have read it in so many classes since then.  There is a tour through the house where Anne and her family hid for 25 months, and attached to it is a museum and bookstore.     That is my Amsterdam experience in a nutshell.  Amazing!!  Miss you all!!  Wish me luck on my quest to kiss Prince William!!

       And the winner is.......    Michael Kilgore, Ladies and Gentlemen!!!   Michael wins the prize for being the first to send me snail mail, which we all look longingly for every day on our way to dinner!  I know it's expensive, so I completely understand, but it was such a nice surprise!!  Thanks Mike!!  I'm really glad you're enjoying your birthday gift (The L.O.T.R. Two Towers DVD).  That movie kicks lots of bootie!!    Yay for Mike!!

       Where were we?   So, yes, the movie...see it if you get a chance.  Also, there was a Nike ad played before the movie started.  Are they playing this in the states?  It is a basketball game and they start to play musical chairs.  It was hiLARious!    Anyshmoo...  We woke up at the hostel Saturday morning too late to get the free COFFEE!!!  AAAHHHHHH!!!  Liza - caffeine = NOT PRETTY!!  We start to wonder, stumble accross this little bakery, the man there is my SAVIOR...fresh muffins and a double espresso...I'm ready to go!  We shopped for a while in the shopping district, it was packed, then headed over to see some of the most interesting architecture I've ever seen.  Now, a little bit of background on Rotterdam, in case you're not familiar.  Rotterdam basically got the CRAP bombed out of it during the war.  There was barely anything left.  It's a terrible tragedy, but has yeilded a city FULL of modern architecture, late 40's and early 50's.  We saw the cubic houses...houses literally in the shape of cubes, turned up onto one corner.  People actually live there, and there is one that you can enter, it was amazing.  The cubic houses are right next to the Rotterdam Library, and HUGE building with bright orange tubes running all along the outside.  We continued along the harbor, with a gorgeous view of the Swan Bridge...yup, a bridge, in the modern cubic shape of a swan.  We headed over to the architeutural institute, this was my favorite memory in Rotterdam.  Outside was an exhibit.  It was called "Architects of Air".  It was a huge inflatable complex, climate controlled and filled with spacey Enya-ish music...kind of what you hear while waiting in line at Space Mountain.  Made mostly of opaque grey plastic/rubber.  In each 'room' there were slats of translucent colored plastic/rubber through which the sun would filter, and the 'walls' were molded into different shapes.  It is very hard to describe.  I will have to find a site with great pictures, so that I can put a link in here for you guys, because I really don't know how to describe how interesting Rotterdam is.    That night, there just happened to be a festival going on, so we had a lot of fun just wandering, ducking into a bar or a coffee shop here and there.  There was a lot of art to look at and there were people EVERYWHERE!   Eventually, we wound up back at the hostel...the couple that we shared our room with was already asleep, but we were relieved to see that they were at least fully clothed, unlike the first night when we came home...EEEWWWW!!!!  The next day we headed back to the castle.  It was a bit of a debachle getting back here...I guess Boston is not the only place in the world that has issues with public transportation.  Let's just say that the 2 1/2 hour trip took us about 6 hours.  Oh well, it's all part of the experience, Right?  Rrrriiiiiight!  I say that now.  If you would've said that to me Sunday night when I finally crawled up the stairs to my room, I probably would've introduced your nose to my fist!  Tomorrow morning it's on to Amsterdam!  I hope everyone has a fantabulous weekend!!

       And Finally, Ladies and Gentlemen...Rotterdam   Geez!  Sorry I'm such a slacker about writing about my very first weekend of travelling.  Things are picking up in the homework department, so I'm working on, ya know,  learning  every night...and we stop having access to the internet at 1:00am, so it's taken a few days for me to get in here and write about Rotterdam.  We leave tomorrow for Amsterdam, though, so I've got to do this today.    So....  Last Friday, at about 10:45am, we (Myself, Erin, Emily, Eva, and Ross) walk out of the castle with our packs on our backs and head down to the bus stop! We are all set for our journey, we know when the train comes, we have our Strippenkarts for the bus, we grab some breakfast at the bakery, we are all set.  So...we see the bus coming, before we actually get to the bus stop.  In a state of I-need-to-travel-right-now frenzy, we start to run accross the street...and Ross almost dies!  It's all good though!!!  Everythings alright!  One of us must have had the presense of mind to yell "HEMANDROOOPPAIWAY" (Roughly translated as "Hey Ross, there's a car speeding towards your mortal body, you need to stop moving right now or you will die, please.")  Yay!!  We all got on the bus in one piece!  We got the rest of the way there by train, accidentally sitting in first class on the way...  Conductor: You have to move or you have to PAY!  Embarrassing? NAH!  We just played the 'Dumb American' card...works every time!  Then we changed trains and  got on the wrong one...a minor setback, and we got to see a little more of the Netherlandish countryside...it's beautiful.    So FINALLY we arrive in Rotterdam.  We are in the financial district and are a little lost.  Yours truly forgot to actually print out the Hostel Reservation confirmation with the address of the hostel on it.  On to the internet cafe.  We grab some grup and head to our hostel, for all of us this is our first hostel experiance.  The room is nice, the showers are a little hairy, but hey, what do you expect for 22 euros a night?!  We spent the rest of the day wondering, going into little shops, eating Turkish cuisine (of which there is a LOT in Rotterdam...weird, huh?) and seeing a movie!  We wanted to see a movie in Dutch, but there were none playing, so we saw one that is Icelandic with Dutch subtitles!  It was amazing!!!  We totally got everything!  The performances were great.  It was called Noi Albinoi...if it is playing anywhere in the states, I highly recommend it.    I need to go grab some grub...I'll be back after lunch to talk about the amazing architecture and art we saw on Saturday...

       Decisions, Decisions...   I can't decide what I want to write about in my next blog.  I'm thinking either Hurricane Izzy...because I think it's really funny that they named a Hurricane after my friend Izzy!!  HAHA  IZZER!!  Or...............  The demise of BENNIFER!!  Wow!  I love America!  Every news site I went to after spending the weekend in a foreign city not knowing what was going on in my motherland had HEADLINING STORIES about J-Lo getting dumped by Ben Affleck.  What the hell?!  Honestly, HONESTLY people, there's nothing better to talk about???

       September 11...is everyone alright?   Two years ago I called my dad in Arizona from my office in Boston.  "Dad, are you watching the news?" "No, honey, I'm just getting ready to leave for the airport."  "Dad, turn on the news." A few seconds later..."Oh my God..."  And then I cried.  I cried for a long time.  It still makes me cry writing about it.  I just woke up this morning and was a long way from home, and just wanted to say that I hope everyone is doing alright today.  I love you all, and by all, I mean every human being who might ever read this.    Peace be with you.

       I'm Like Elmira Gultch   Wow, I just took a bike ride around the town.  So far I had been to the 2 bars, the store Alles Onder Een Dak (All under one roof), and the ATM at the Rabobank.  (I love Dutch!!  When I say I need to go to the Rabobank I picture a bank that was shot to death and then brought back to life using what was left of it, supplemented with mechanical parts of other banks.  And now it's like a big indestructible Rabobank with big guns hidden in it's thighs, but it still has human feelings and memories.  Does anyone else think that when they say Rabobank?  Anyone?  Anyone?)  Anyshmoo, today I took a bike ride around the rest of town.  Didn't take long, Well is about the size of Arthur, North Dakota.  If you don't know how big Arthur, North Dakota is, ask my mom, my grandparents, or one of my cousins.  Everyone who you pass says hello.  There's no litter AT ALL on the streets.  Every house is adorable!!  I just love it, love it, LOVE IT!!  There is a river that runs along the southern Border of the town.  There is a Lake.  There are lots of fields: some with goats, some with corn, and LOTS with HORSES!  Yes mom, HORSES!  And there is a stable where you can ride, which mom and I will most definitely be doing when she comes here!  MOST EXCELLENT!!  Also, I have been to almost all of my classes, French is the only one I haven't had yet.  I love them all.  Once I have been to all of them I will have more info to write descriptions of courses and teachers.    Oh yes, and I figured out what I'm doing this weekend.  We are going to spend the day Friday in Naimagaan (I need to learn how to spell that) and then that night we are going to Rotterdam, until Sunday.  We are going to try to find some live music and/or a Dutch movie house.  YAY!!  First weekend!!!  Oh, and when I say "we" I mean some of the friends I have made here.  There's Erin, one of my roommates, who is Irish and, how awesome is this, does Irish step dancing.  Emily, who plays guitar 'wicked fuckin'good'.  Eva, whose last name is Constantopolis (say that 5 times fast) and who has a RAD singing voice.  And Ross, who is super easy to talk to and officially became my friend when he let me borrow his Aerosmith CD.  A fun little group!!  I will let you know how it goes!!  As for further blog entries, of course I will be writing to tell you all about the different cities I go to, museums that I see, people I meet, all of that.  However, I know that, when friends of mine travel, I always have so many questions.  If you have a specific something that you want to hear about, or want me to check out, email me...YAY!!

       Oops, I forgot!   I forgot that I don't see and speak to most of you on a daily basis.  I've gotten some emails that go something like..."what are you doing there?"..."Why are you there?"...and..."You're in the F@$#ing Netherlands?!  So, allow me to explain...  I go to Emerson College.  Emerson college owns a castle in the Netherlands, Kasteel Well.  They have an semester exchange program that students can apply for and that I was accepted to, yay me!  Monday through Thursday, we live and take class at the castle.  Mostly art & music history, philosophy...european-centered studies.  The, on the weekends, we get to travel.  There was a travel package we all purchased, it includes 3 weekends that we all so together: Paris, Amsterdam, and Florence (Sorry Suarez!!) And it also includes a Eurail pass, activated at the end of this month, that is good for two months, so we can use our other weekends, along with 2 week-long breaks, to travel and learn more.  Kasteel Well is in the town of Well.  It is a very small town about 5 minutes from the German border.  The closest larger cities, if you are having issues finding me on a map, are Venlo to the south and Naimaagen (I think I spelled that wrong) to the North.    That is the gist!!!  Now we are all on the same page, woo hoo!!!

         Holy drunk fetuses, Batman!!!     Sorry if the fetus reference grosses you out.  It is a pet name for young people, started by Jeremy King...so blame him!!  Well, our first weekend here was full of orientation meetings and 19 year olds feeling awkward ordering their first alcoholic drinks in bars.  It was FUN-NY!!!  "Um, what kind of mixed drinks do you have?" (bartender says something in unintelligible Dutch) "Well, I don't like beer, do you have a list?"  (more unintelligible Dutch)  "A list??" (more Dutch, but then some english "Pick a color.")  "Um, green???"  It looked to me like a Midori sour...but I didn't taste it.  4 Euro for something smaller than my fist?  I'll have a beer please!!  And so it went.    It was very sweet...I make fun, but I have to say, if Matt Terry hadn't been there to get me good and pukey on my 21st, I would have been just as lost.  Tip your hat to Matty T. if you see him.    What else?  What else, what else?? (You have to sing that.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, call Chris or Stephy Pysher, they'll clue you in!!)  We start class tomorrow.  I feel very ready.  I'm all set.  I've got my books, I went to the store in town yesterday and bought shampoo and all that stuff, so I'm clean!  My roommates and I got together and rented a bike, so we can escape campus if we need to, and there is a gorgeous spider outside our window that has caught and punished every renegade bug dumb enough to attempt entry...life is good.  We already, through a scheduling mix up, have a free weekend to travel, next weekend.  Our train passes, however, do not get activated until about a two weeks later.  So, if anyone has any cheap suggestions of what to do, I'm all ears.  I don't plan on spending one weekend on campus.  In fifteen minutes, we have coffe and tea in Sophie's Lounge.  Sophie, if you haven't read the history of the castle, is a...or I should say, WAS A, 13 year old girl who lived in the castle, and died in the castle, and now, as legend has it, Haunts the Castle!!!  Do do do do, do do do do  (If you didn't get that, I was singing the theme from The Twilight Zone.)  Such Wit!  Such Humor!!  Wow, I'm even annoying myself!!  Well, I'm better go get some caffeine in the Ghost room, because we have more meetings all afternoon!!!  YAY!!!  Wish my luck in my first day of classes tomorrow!  I love you all!!!

       Holy crap, I'm here!   I've been awake since Thursday morning at 7:00, Boston time.  I dragged my stuff to school, sat in meetings, ran last minute errands, went to the airport, said goodbye to Chris (cried!!), then our flight was delayed 3 hours, we flew, took a 2 1/2 hour bus ride, and finally arrived here, and then had some of our orientation stuff.  It's now 9:07 Holland time...3:07 Boston time, on Friday afternoon.  I can barely type, let alone be witty, but I had to drop a line to my loyal readers as soon as I could!  It's unbelievably beautiful here!!!  The Castle (whose website I will add a link to later, when I can think straight) is smaller than I expected, but ten times more amazing!! I mean, it's a CASTLE!!!  It's has two moats, black swans, fountains, all that stuff!!  It's gorgeous!!  I'm going to go take a shower now, and then sleep the sleep of the dead until I can sleep no more!!  I love you all!!

       If I eat one more chocolate, I will puke!!   Belgium, I love you!  Brugge is absolutely the cutest little medieval city I've ever seen!!  We got there the afternoon of the 24th, after a six hour journey that was supposed to take 4 hours.  We transferred trains FIVE TIMES...what is up?  The best is when you're standing on a train platform in the freezing cold and your train isn't showing up and then there's an announcement in another language and everyone who understood it starts to walk away.  AAHH!!  Whatever, we got there....  and it was great!  The entire weekend is a blur of shopping, gawking at medieval architecture, munching mussels and, of course...CHOCOLATE!  Our hostel was right in the middle of things...YAY ZOE...so we would just walk until we got cold, then some back to the hostel (right above a bar/restaurant, the room was painted with yellow and blue swirls...trippy!!) and warm up, then head out for some more.  We traveled with a larger group (Ross, Erin, Eva, Emily, Laura, Zoe, Deborah, Jen, and LIZA!) so we jsut kept splitting up and getting back together.  One of my favorite things was that they have an entire Tin Tin store!  If you're not familiar with Tin Tin, click on Chris's link at the top of my blog, he'll school you!    There also, randomly, was a Dali exhibit being held in the building underneath the clock tower (which Zoe and I climbed to the top of on Sunday...Motha of Gawd, that's a hig friggin' towah!!  Umm, that's supposed to be a Boston accent.)  which was amazing.  It was a lot of his later work, 1935-1960's.  There was one series that was based on Alice in Wonderland...it was so scary but I couldn't stop looking at it.  There was also a rendering of the crucifixion that I had never seen before.  I kept thinking of Matt Redder, one of the most gifted artists I have the pleasure of being friends with, and how I'm going to be walking through an enormous exhibit of his work one day.  I love Dali!  So that was Brugge.  Not the most adventurous weekend (except getting there and back...on the way back it took 8 hours, what?!?!) but so much fun!    This weekend we (Myself, Eva, Emily and Dylan) are going to Prague.  My first Eastern Europe experience...I'm so excited!!

       We're all caught up!!   Just to get everything squared away, here's a quick synopsis of what's happened since my solo travel week.  The week that I got back, mom and dad were here from Tuesday until Thursday!  SO MUCH FUN!!  They stayed at the little B&B that is here in town.  It was really fun having dinner with them and trading stories about European travels.  For those of you that don't know them, they have never been to this side of the pond either.  They started out in London, saw some theatre in the West End (RAD!!) and hit some cool English pubs!  Then they came to Amsterdam, then met me in Well...I'm sure THAT was the highlight of their trip...from London to....(wait for it).........WELL!!!!  Wow, I'm know, it's just so thrilling!  Then they continued on to Paris!  YAY for mom and dad!!    The following weekend, the 17th - 19th, I stayed at the castle.  Almost half of the students did.  Our midterms were the following week, we had just gotten back from a full 10 days of travel, everyone was exhausted!  (I was warned about this before I came, people said that about half-way through the semester, you just need a break, so you don't burn out.)  We took a days trip on Friday up to Arnhem.  There is a national park.  You enter, pay a fee, and rent a bike.  Then you ride through every type of terrain imaginable; tall think forrests, rolling hills of tall wheatgrass, beachy sand dunes, shorter forrests...10 kilometers later, you arrive at the Kroller-Mueller museum.  The museum has an outdoor sculpture garden and a great collection of Van Gogh's work. (Including Cafe de Nuit...SO pretty!!)    The rest of the weekend was nice and relaxing.  We had picnics in our dorm, studied for finals, jammed with Emily on her guitar...it was like a big 3 day long sleepover party!  YAY  The following week is a midterms induced blur, then this past weekend we went to Brugge.  I'll tell you about that in a little bit!!

       Horay for the devil kitty!!!   Last night we carved pumpkins...it was perfect!  It was freezing cold and very clear.  The air smelled like cold and fireplaces.  We went to the Barn, a big ...well...BARN that is just outside the castle entrance, and walked in and there was a huge pile of pumpkins!!  YAY!  There were all different kinds: little round ones, huge ones, short fat ones, tall skinny ones, red ones, green ones, orange ones!!!  We all picked one and started carving!  Mine is a little kitty with devil horns...so cute!  This waqs Erin's first time carving one, she carved out a sun!  Ross did a ladybug (lieveheersbeestje in Dutch)!  It was an all around good time!  I took lots of pictures to show you all.  When we were done, we ran back to our rooms (it was SO COLD by then) and put on jammies and made hot chocolate!  It was a  great  night!

       Je rentre au bon Paris!!   So I just hang in Amboise the rest of the night!  There are so many cute little shops, restaurants, creperies!  It's a gorgeous place to just sit around!  Then I went back to my cute little hostel.  The next morning I hung in Amboise some more, did some souvenir shopping.  Traveling alone, I wrote a LOT in my journal, so I needed a new one.  I think the one I bought is my favorite souvenir so far, it's SO pretty, I almost don't want to write in it.    I headed back to Paris, hoping to get an overnight train back to Amsterdam.  Well...didn't happen.  The overnight train only runs in the  summer !  I was wondering what the little 's' in my schedule meant!!  Bad news...I'm stuck in a city with almost no money.  Good news...that city is PARIS!!  I found the cheapest hotel that had an opening and hunkered down for the night.  I walked over to the hotel where I had stayed on Thursday night...the employees there were really cool, about my age, and spoke English.  We hung for a little while, had some dinner, and I went back to my hotel to tackle the task of fitting everything I had purchased during the week into my backpack.  Let me tell you, this was not pretty!!  So, that is the story of my solo travels.  I never thought I would finish!!  I hope that you are all still awake!!  People keep asking me what I thought of traveling alone.  I loved it!  I highly recommend it!  Was it scary and overwhelming at times?  Of course, but think of all the great stuff you've done that is scary and overwhelming at times!  Remember, "Courage is fear that has said it's prayers!" <>  I love you all!!

       I will finish this story!!!   Overnight trains...wow, interesting.  This was a night comprised of periods of sound sleep when the train was moving (it sort of rocked me to sleep like a wee babe) mixed with confusion/fright when the train would stop, I would almost fall out of my top bunk, and more strange foreign men would be talking WAY too loud right outside my compartment door.  There was one other person in the compartment with me, a guy who, within the first two minutes in the car, was on his cell phone telling his wife how excited he was to see her in Paris...harmless!  Some quotes from my journal:  " Sitting in my cuchet in Cerbere, Spain.  I thought I was the only person in here, so I started changing my pants up on my bunk, and who walks in to make the other beds but a really cute steward, wow!  Good thing I have a huge backpack and a bunch of stuff to grab to cover my bootie and smile innocently while the poor guy tries to do his job !"  After this I walked down to the bathroom to change!  " I'm eating these really gross cheese curl things.  They smell like cat breath, but they're all I have to eat!...Oh, and I have some candy too, real good Liza!"   I arrived in Paris, in one piece, at about 7:00 am on Thursday.  I never found my hostel!  Apparently the street that it is supposedly on just  doesn't exist !  After looking for an hour, I decided to cut my proverbial losses and got out my travel book, finding the cheapest hotel in the neighborhood and heading there to get a room.  Of course, it's 8:00 in the morning, so I can't check in, but the people there are super-duper nice and let me leave my stuff in the lobby while I went to walk around.  I walked straight o Notre Dame and sat in a cafe near the north side so I could sip coffee and eat my omelet while staring once again at those glorious flying buttresses!  So, I'm tired, my muscles hurt, I have "train" all over me...but really, I'm staring at flying buttresses...life cannot get much better!  The rest of my day in Paris was spent doing everything that I didn't have time to do the previous weekend!  I walked around, seeing all the sights (holocaust memorial, Samaritaine Department Store), eating all the food (ice cream at Berthillion, bread with stinky cheese from a fromagerie, and sitting in cafes, watching the pretty Parisians, writing in my journal.  It was great!  At night I climbed up again to Sacre Coure and hung out where Toulouse-Lautrec did, bought souvenirs for Raven and Jaden, and basically enjoyed every second of my day!    Friday morning I packed up my stuff, once again, and headed to another train station.  Sidenote: My roommate Erin picked up the new Rufus Wainwright cd and we decided that track number 1 is the theme song for life  at the castle because one of the lyrics is "Why am I always on a plane or a fast train?"  Anyschmoo, I headed to Amboise, a little village built around a chateaux in the Loire valley!  This was the place I was most excited about.  I knew that nobody else was going there, nobody else had even heard of it, and I read that it was beautiful.  Da Vinci retired there, and if it's good enough for Leo, well, it's PLENTY good enough for me!  The books were right, Amboise is like a fairy tale.  I got to see a lot of it right away as, staying true to form, I managed to find my hotel, after getting lost for about 20 minutes, while having to go to the bathroom, with my ginormous backpack on!  I finally find the Cafe D'Arts, and funky, colorful little place that rents the rooms over the top of it for 16 euro per night.  What a bargain!!  This place rocked!  I felt like I was just staying at a friends house or something.    The Chateaux D'Amboise, where the king lived, and the Chateaux de le Clos Luce, where the King's friend Leonardo lives, are both amazingly, ridiculously gorgeous!  I toured both of them...this took the bulk of my day on Friday!  SO beautiful!  At Clos Luce, there are models of Da Vinci's inventions, built by IBM from drawings that he left behind.  Most of them are WAY ahead of their time, things like the first car and the first armored tank.  As you walk through the grounds, you hear voice overs, words of Da Vinci and his students, and you see his art everywhere...hanging from the trees, floating in a stream.  Awesome!!

       Bar-theh-lona!   So, I wake up Tuesday, so proud of myself for making through my first night alone, and went to grab some coffee...and work out a few other issues.  Here are a few quotes from my journal that morning:   "I really have to figure out how I get to Barcelona." "I looked at so many hostels in Barcelona last week, I wonder which one I ended up booking." "Wow, I really don't know how much money is in my bank account right now."   HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!  Don't worry.  I found access to the internet and solved these problems, and by early afternoon I was on my way to Barcelona, a.k.a. Bar-theh-lona.  It just sounds better with a lisp!  I got there really late at night, pretty sketchy, and pretty much just crashed.  I wanted to wake up bright eyed and bushy tailed for sight-seeing the next morning, which I totally did.  I went to see the work of the architect Gaudi.  AMAZING!  He designed buildings in the late 1800's - early 1900's, in the style of art nouveau.  The buildings look like they're alive!!  After seeing this, the rest of Barcelona just didn't compare, so I grabbed some grub and headed out early!  Seafood Paella...yum!!  It's a really big city, which  was unfamiliar with, so I couldn't think of anything else I wanted to do there by myself.  I headed to the train station at about 6:00 and boarded the train that would get me to Paris by Thursday morning...

       And then there was one...   Well, I already wrote half of this entry, and then something popped up on my computer and it got erased!  ARGH!!!  So I will try this again, but probably won't get through the rest of my week...here goes...  Monday... After my brief but wonderful love affair with an almond criossant, I head to the train staion...with 6 other people!  So much for this traveling alone stuff, at least for the moment, turns out we're going to the same place.  Avignon!  While trying to buy tickets for 7 people, waiting for the train with 7 people, and getting ON the train with  7 people , I am reminded of why I'm so excited to travel alone.  I love each and every person I am with, but together we are the definition of a cluster-fuck!  I make several refences in my journal entry from this day to travel being the litmus test of human relations, SO TRUE!  Oh well, we get there, in one piece, in a state of relative sanity.    Avignon, though somewhat cemmercialized (there is a McDonald's and an H&M) is very beautiful.  Lots of sunbleached stone buildings and small winding streets.  I split from my group to find my hotel.  I find it, after getting lost for about 20 minutes, while having to go to the bathroom, with my ginormous backpack on.  This, I will find, is a recurring theme in my travels.  In each new city, I manage to find my hotel, after getting lost for about 20 minutes, while having to go to the bathroom, with my ginormous backpack on!  Oh well, the point is I find my hotel, all by myself!  Avignon, in these off-season months, is very relaxing.  I spend the whole afternoon sipping coffee and writing in cute little cafes and shopping!    Avignon is built around a Papal Palace that dates back about 100 years.  It's really beautiful.  It is expensive to tour the inside, but free to climb up to the top, which I do.  From up there you get awesome (in the true sense of the word) views of the surrounding valley and river.  I took lots of kickass pictures that I will show you if I can ever afford to get them developed!   Evetually, as Avignon is pretty small, I run into my friends who are also there.  We spend the evening together, walking back to the top of the palace to catch the sunset, more kickass pictures, and then grabbing some dinner together.  This is nice, last contact with people who speak my language.  I then head bak to my hotel, first night alone in a hotel room, ever!  Good thing my hotel is really cute and there are two locks on the door!  To be continued...

HA HA  This week turned out to be really busy, in a good way.  My parents got here on Tuesday and were here until this morning.  It was so much fun!  However, mom + liza + red wine = not enough sleep!!  After last week, and considering that my midterms are next week, I will be staying in Well this weekend! SO many people are doing the same thing.  I was warned about this; needing a break halfway through.  So I plan to play catch up on studying, sleeping, and blogging.    For now maybe I'll do a list...  Hmmmmm........  A list...........  How about.......  TOP TEN THINGS I MISS:  1.  Not walking down the hall to shower 2.  Kraft Mac'n'Cheese, the blue box please :) 3.  People who know all the same movie quotes as me, sometimes I say something here that NOBODY gets, yeah, that's fun! 4.  Bustin' a move with my dance peoples 5.  Movies on rainy weekend afternoons 6.  Calling my sister every couple of weeks 7.  Cooking & baking in my very own kitchen 8.  Voice lessons! 9.  Direct Deposit!! 10.

       Here goes...   I probably won't finish this all in on entry, but I've got to start somewhere.  I think the easiest way to do this is chronoligically, so  Weekend in Paris... Like I said, we had almost every second planned for us, mostly museums.  Holy cow!  Are there museums in Paris or WHAT?!?!  We got into the city Friday evening, had about 2 hours to check in and eat dinner, then took a nightime stroll over to the Louvre.  We split up into groups and each went with one techer.  I got to go with Janneke, one of my Art History III teachers, all weekend.  I was VERY excited about this because she kicks lots of ass.  We went to the courtyard of the Louvre and had a little mini-lecture about the building itself: when, why, and by whom it was built.  We were then free to go for the night, and I and three other girls (Eva, who you already know, Slip, and Laura) decided to walk along the Seine to the Eiffel Tower.  The Eiffel Tower is amazing.  We went to the top.  I didn't have anyone to kiss (tear!) but it was still amazing.  We stepped out onto the top floor and none of us could feel our feet!  It was just amazing!!  Saturday... 10:00 we split into groups again and walked over to Notre Dame.  When we came around the corner on the street and it came into view, I completely flipped.  Pointed arches!!  Gargoyles!!  Flying Buttresses!!!!  I love gothic architecture!!!  We learned a lot about the outside of the structure (1 euro for whoever knows why there are the most gargoyles on the North side) and then got a little bit of time to go inside.  It wasn't long enough, but I went back later on my own, YAY!  We then headed over to Saint Chapelle, small (in comparison with Notre Dame) and very beautiful church that was built to house a piece of the crown of thorns.  The relic dissappeared during the revolution, but the structure is still there.  Unlike Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle still has its original stained glass, so you really get a feel for the true lighting of a gothic church.  There is nothing like it!  I used 1 1/2 rolls of film at Notre Dame and Saint Chapelle.  Film well spent! 1:00 we split for lunch and met again at the Louvre at 2:30 to head inside and go around with teachers, more mini-lectures.  I have to say that the Louvre was my least favorite museum experience.  It's just too much!  Venus and the Mona Lisa are beautiful, but there are so many people that you can't stand there and really enjoy them.  Especially the Mona Lisa.  I felt like I was at a rock concert.  There is a mob, seriously a MOB, of people, you fight your way to the front, then it hurts because you get smashed up against the railing, and then you can't even look at it because of all of the camera flashes reflecting off of the glass that it is housed behind.  It is a riDONKulous situation, hee haw hee haw!!  Janneke (I can't say anough about this teacher) took us all the way through, showing the progression of sculpture from antiquity to romanticism, and the showing the works of David, Delacriox, Ingres....and then, yeah, the Mona Lisa, whatever!! Saturday night we (we = the art hist. III stdent) were scheduled to go to the Pompidou Centre, the modern art museum.  The museum was supposedly open until 1:00 and was free after 9:00.  LIE!!  They lied to us!  They were closed!  We were so mad!  Grrrr!    Sunday... 10:30 Musee D'Orsay!  My favorite!!!!  Second half of the 18th century up until about 1910.  This museum experience was amazing, not just because this museum is beautiful, but because Janneke is rad!!  We had a quiz just before we left and I didn't do great on it.  Nothing that I said on it was wrong, but I just didn't say enough.  She had asked me about it to make sure I knew what I was doing wrong and I had told her that I just wasn't very confident talking about art, but that I would work on it.  That right there, making sure to talk to a student who got a bad grade, is a lot more than most teachers would do.  But wait, it gets better!!  We decided to split up at the Musee D'Orsay, it's much smaller than the Louvre, so that's doable there.  I had started to walk away, when Janneke comes up to me and says that we are going to walk around together, just two friends looking at art, and I am going to tell her what I see!  WOW!!  Moments like this are why I went back to school!!   After this we went to Versailles, something I'm still not sure about.  Is it beautiful?  Yeah.  Is it gaudy and unnecessary and a big old reminder of the evils of absolute power?  Yeah.   Once we got back and were done with the scheduled stuff, a few of us (Janneke, Sarah, Ben, John and myself) went to grab a beer, then I met up with some peeps (Eva, there she is again, Sam, John, Jen, Enrico and James) who were headed over to Montmarte, the area of town where Amelie was filmed and the site of the Moulin Rouge, a wholly unimpressive building with a windmill on top.  Oh well, Toulouse-Loutrec hung out there, so I HAD to go.  It was fun!  We had dinner in an italian restaurant that had an amazing piano player.  His set consisted of Queen, Beatles, Billy Joel...this guy was great!  Then we grabbed a ice cream cone...YUM...and headed back.  Enrico and I still hadn't seen the Arch du Triomphe (sp?) so went headed over to see it, very beautiful at night, and then we went to the hotel and I slept the sleep of the dead!!!  YAY!  Monday morning... I finally had an almond croissant...scrum-diddly!  I'll stop here for now.  My parents are coming here today, HOORAY, and I have class and I really need to shower, yuck!  I hope I'm not boring you all too much with this "I did this, and then this, and then this..." format.  I'm not really sure how else to tell it.  Starting with my next entry is when I was alone, with only my journal as my companion, so stick with me,  maybe things will get a little more interesting!    I love you all!!!

       I'm alive!   I don't have time to tell all of the stories now, but I just wanted to say hello!  I got back last night from 10 days of travel, 7 of them by myself, all over France and a little bit of Spain!  I'm alive!  I'm sifting through my numerous journal entries and 'free paper souvenirs' (ticket stubs, brochures, maps) to figure out what exactly has happened in the last week.  It feels like I've been gone for about a year.  I will finish sorting through it tonight and tell you all about it.  For now I just wanted to say bonjour, hola, yo!

       Holy Frickin' Poop, I'm in PARIS!   Just thought I'd run away from the Emerson HERD for a sec and say hello...so, HELLO!  I'm in Paris, YAY!  We have planned things all this weekend, then I am off on my own.  I'm really scared of travelling alone, but really, nobody wanted to do everything that I want to do, so, you know....  Wow!  I'm going to stay here another night on Sunday, go to Avignon Monday morning.  Stay there for a day.  Go to Barcelona on Tuesday, hang there Tuesday night and Wednesday.  Take an overnight train back to Paris on Wednesday night.  Spend the day here on Thursday...I thought it would be fun, after being here on a weekend with 82 other people having planned activities, to come back on a normal weekday and just hang by myself.  Then Friday I'm going to Amboise...I have read that it's beautiful.  I'll stay there Friday night, try to get up to Mont Saint Michel on Saturday, then back to Amsterdam to see mom and dad!!  I really wanted to spend more time in the south of France, and to see Madrid, but you can't do it all, know what I mean?!  There are some people who are going to go to a new city every day.  How would someone even learn about the place that way?!  It would all be a blur.  I think my head would explode!!    Well, I miss you all!  Wish me luck on my solo adventure!!  Au revoir!

       Cheers, Love!   Wow!  London kicks lots of ass!  Last weekend, I traveled with 8 people (Yes  8 people ) to London.  We took a taxi to Neiderheim, right across the border in Germany, then a plane to London.  Three countries in one day...I thought my head was going to explode.  What did I do there?  Everything.  I bought a ticket for one of those double-decker buses with the open top.  It drives around the city, a tour guide showing all of the sights, and if something looks interesting, you just hop off and hop back on later.  Easy Peasy!  London, as some of you may know, is VERY expensive!  They also charge to get in everywhere.  So I basically spent a lot of time looking at the outsides of buildings.  I know, it doesn't sound very fun, but if you've ever seen Westminster Abbey up close and personal, you'll understand when I say that it was...well...one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.  Everything in London was like this too!  The Tower of London, The Tower Bridge, The Houses of Parliament, where Big Ben lives.  "Hey kids look, it's Big Ben!" (1 euro to whoever names that movie!)  Big Ben, by the way, is not the name of the clock, but of the bell in the clock.  Who knew?!?!  'Not I', said the Liza.  The only thing that was disappointing to me, I'm sorry to say, was London Bridge.  I've been singing that freakin' song since before I could speak, and that's a pretty long time!  I've built this thing up in my mind so much that I'm expecting it to look like the Pearly Gates Of Heaven!  And what is it?   What is it ??  A big ol' concrete slab held up by some more concrete slabs!  SLABS!!  Then, carved into the side..."London Bridge".  What the bleepity bleep is that?!  I guess it fell down so many times they just gave up on actually coming up with something pretty!!  The other highlight of the weekend, besides all of the beautiful, non-London Bridge, architecture, was that I got to eat a cheeseburger!  I didn't know how much I loved those things until living in the Netherlands, where they're virtually non-existent.  MMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......cheeseburger......with fries and a pint!!  I was so happy, I almost cried!  Onto the future.  We leave, all 82 of us, tomorrow morning at 8:30 for our excursion to Paris!  Three days of scheduled activities with all of us together, then we are set loose on Sunday, and not allowed to come back to campus until the following Sunday.  I'll be traveling alone.  I'm not sure why.  I didn't really want to go with 8 people again, it makes my head explode, and it's really hard to find just one or two people to go with.  I'm going to head south to the coast, Marseille, then west to Barcelona, then back up to Paris, since we don't have any free time there this weekend, and then one day in either La Rochelle or Pontorson, the site of Mont Saint Michel...SSSOOO PRETTY!!  I'll try to hit a couple of internet cafes, emails would be greatly appreciated, since I won't otherwise be able to communicate except in my remedial French.  Also, any advice from those of you who have traveled alone would make me, well, not scared as shitless as I am right now!  I love you all!!!  Those are my thoughts on London

       Let's try this again...   So, today I had the perfect day...   8:45  - wake up and shuffle down to breakfast  10:00  - French class  11:45  - lunch  12:15  - put my jammies back on, get in bed, and watch Erin start to make a Turkey.  You know, the kind where you trace your hand and then color it in like a turkey!  12:45  - roll out of bed and make my own turkey!  It has red sparkly shoes!!  1:15  - Erin, Nicole and I decide that a holiday crafts project is very necessary...so off we go to the store to get supplies.  Don't worry, I changed back out of my jammies before going 'downtown'  2:30 until 6:00  - Jammies again...followed by a full blown holiday crafts party in our room.  Everyone stopped by to make beautiful glittery snowflakes, we sang songs really loudly, and Carrie even brought up her laptop, which has Charlie Brown's Christmas on it!!  6:00  - Dutch style Thanksgiving dinner!  The kitchen staff, even though they don't know anything about Thanksgiving, made us Turkey and mashed potatoes AND.......wait for it.........Pumpkin Pie!!!  It was the cutest things ever!  They even put fancy tablecloths on the tables!  Dulcia, the amazing woman who runs the show here, talked to us about how she knows we miss our families, but that all of the staff hoped that the dinner made us feel right at home with our 'Castle Family'!  It totally did!!  We snagged one of the big tables so that all of us could sit together, and it really did feel like home.  We even assigned familial roles...Ross is the drunk uncle, Erin is the mom, and I am the crazy aunt who wears her pajamas all the time and won't stop taking pictures.  We had SO much fun!  7:00  - Nap time!  Mmmmm....turkey sleep.....mmmmmmmmm  9:00  - Get snazzied up for the party!  Free snacks and drinks at Sophie's!  Zoe and I even busted out our matching Christmas-tree-ornament-esque jewelry that we bought at H&M last week.  Fun, until the underagers started to get a little too crazy with the free wine...but whatever.  However boring, even that was endearing to me...the holidays just turn me into a big love-fest!!    10:00  - Head to the computer lab to tell all of you how much I miss and love you!  I will think of each and every one of you tomorrow!  God bless you and keep you!  Happy Holidays!!

       The perfect day just started to suck.   So I had just written this big huge entry about the great day that I had today, and then the great day turned on me when my computer froze just as I finished and I lost my whole entry!!!  Don't worry, I will write it again, I just need to wait until the emotional stress of losing a piece of such poetry subsides. (sigh)  :)

This past week was the second of our weeklong travel breaks.  So, after I dropped you a line from Florence, I went to Rome, then Perugia, then Venice, and now I'm in the French Alps.  I'll be back on campus on Monday and I'll tell you more details!  Until then...I'm going to go eat chocolate and stare at the mountains!!  I hope that you all are having equally as much fun!    Lots of love!!

       J'aime Suisse!!   I have class in 10 minutes, and the computers are painfully slow today, so this will be brief.  I just wanted to rave about how gorgeously beautiful the Swiss Alps are...just for a minute.  So, here I go...  HOLY POOP THE SWISS ALPS ARE GORGEOUS!!!  So, last weekend, after going to the Modern Art Museum in Eindhoven, which was rad by the way, I went to the Swiss Alps for a Rotterdam reunion.  Those of you who have been reading this blog since the beginning know that the first place that I ventured after being plopped down in the Netherlands was Rotterdam.  I went there with Eva, Emily, Ross and Erin.  These four are still four of my closest friends here.  We have traveled in little fragments since R-dam and have traveled with larger groups since then, but we decided to have another weekend with just the 5 of us.  It was RAD!  I love how close we've gotten in only two months...Ross and Erin are even an "item"...SO FRICKIN' CUTE!!!    So, we went to this little town of 130 people called Gimmelwald.  It hasn't been developed at all because, when builders wanted to develop it into a 1,000 residence resort town, the townspeople got together and petitioned for it to be declared and avalanche zone...which is totally bogus, but they won...hooray for them!!!  The most commercial place is the youth hostel, which isn't commercial at all.  It's just a cabin, with a kitchen you can cook in, a view from the cliff that it sits on that you can stare at for hours, and old guitars and a REALLY out of tune piano that you can play.  We, of course, took advantage of everything they had to offer.    Also...really cool randomness...there was a lunar eclipse the one night that we were in Switzerland!!!  So, we set our alarms for 2:00 am, after eating our nice big home-cooked family dinner and drinking a little too much wine (yeah, like that exists!).  We woke up and waddled outside with our blankets to stare at the stars, listen to the wind skimming the mountains (a sound that is ever-present up there), and watch the moon turn from white, to red, to black.  AMAZING!!!  Now, I am off to La Bella Italia!  Florence, Rome, Perugia, Venice...and then the French Alps!  One day in the mountains just wasn't enough!  I will try to get to an internet cafe once in the next week...but I've learned not to count on finding one.  So, I will talk at you soon!!!!  Love, ME

       I'm stuck!   Argh!  I feel like my wings are clipped!  I have to stick around because my art class has an outing to a museum tomorrow morning.  Oh well, I'm sure that it will be great.  I love my art teachers, and the museum that we are going to is the modern art museum in Eindhoven, where they both work, so they will be excited to show us everything.  Also I'm still traveling this weekend, just leaving a day later than usual.  We (Myself, Ross, Erin, Eva, and Emily) are going to the Swiss Alps!!  I'm so excited.  It takes a while to get there, so we are going to go on the overnight train...we'll see how this works...

       My favorite memory of Prague...   We are walking across the Charles Bridge in Prague.  It's this huge famous bridge, connecting the Old Town to the Little Town and the Palace,  upon which there are lots of little art and jewelery kiosks, statues lining the bridge, lots of pedestrians, and...wait for it...The Bridgeband!!  The Bridgeband is a quintet of old jazz musicians.  They are so cute, so entertaining, so talented.  Well, as we walk up, they're playing a song with a Lindy Hop beat.  It just so happens that Dylan is an amazing dancer...and loves to swing!  She had even given us a lesson the week before we went to Prague.  So, she asks if I want to dance, and of COURSE I do!!  So, Dylan and I are swing dancing on the Charles bridge in Prague!  Nearby is a group of three older Greek couples, who start yelling "Hoopah, Hoopah!!"  And one of the men jumps in and takes over the lead...so now I'm on the Charles Bridge in Prague, dancing to an amazing little band, not only with Dylan, one of the coolest girls in the world, but with Nameless Old Greek Man, while he and his wife and friends are yelling "Hoopah!!"  Definitely one of my favorite memories!!  (Don't worry, Mom, Eva and Emily were snapping pictures the whole time!) :)

       Hello from Prague!   I'm in my hostel in prague, The Golden Sickle!  All of the hostels here have the weirdest names...The Golden Sickle, The Apple, The Condor, The Elf!!  HA!  I LOVE PRAGUE!!   It's beautiful, it's friendly, it's filled with music...and it's cheap!  Seriously, I'm doing all of my Christmas shopping here!    There are street musicians, quality street musicians, everywhere.  There are also classical concerts and jazz clubs on every corner.  Last night, we went on a Ghost Tour (Happy Halloween) and then went to a jazz club...a little cramped basement with an absolutely air tight quintet!  They kicked so much ass!!    Today we're going to walk around, walk up to the castle, see the sights, do some shopping, drink some mulled wine...in general just have a grand old time in Prague.

       The last day...   I believe I said it best in the email I just wrote to Chris:   It's really crazy being here today, everyone is emotional and busy.  I just watched the last sunset I will ever see here.  I'm writing you the last email that I will send from here.  I feel like crying, but I'm going to try to just suck up every second while I can .    Tonight, a farewell dinner and open-mic type comcert.  I'll be singing "Hey Now" by myself, and then "Eidelweiss" and "Don't Let Us Get Sick" with Dawn and Briana.  And then we are all going to have a sleepover, staying up as late as possible, until we get ready to leave at 7:00 am.    Wish me luck, I'm going to need it to get through these songs without bawling!!

       Almost done...much coffee needed!!   I'm done with classes...YAY!!!  Before next Thursday, I just have to do a few things.  Want to see my list?  O.K!!  Study for, take, and get good grades on four finals. Write two concert reviews. Pack everything I brought with me plus everything I bought into two and a half bags. Choreograph a dance (to teach during study breaks when our heads are about to explode.) Attend really emotional farewell functions. Learn two songs to perform at said functions.  Wow...seriously, where's the coffee?!?!?!  Wish me luck!

       So, it's a little slow at the castle...   When you stick around on a Friday, your choices are a bit limited.  This isn't Boston, I can't walk down to the corner cafe and people-watch.  There's no cafe, and if I just stood on the corner all I would see is a couple of Wellians riding their bikes down to the Brood & Banket (pronounced brood ahnd bonk-it...my love of the Dutch languages continues to grow!). So, I can sit in the lounge and watch  urlLink "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" ; it's a great film, but I'm just not in the mood to feel the hatred that inevitably wells up inside me while I watch Nurse Ratched.  I'm in more of a  urlLink "Toy Story"  kind of mood.  Alas, there is only one TV, so my other choice is to come over to the lab and take online personality tests that tell me nothing substantial about myself...such as:  I am Lloyd Dobler.       urlLink Which John Cusack Are You?     You learn something new every day.

       The end of an era...   Today, for the first time since October 5th, I cannot hop on a train and go anywhere I'd like to in Europe.  Today I am staying at the castle on a Friday, not because I have an Art History trip or because I have a lot of work to do, but because I...wait, I'm a little choked up...because I don't want to spend the money for a train ticket.  For today, my friends, my Eurail Pass has expired. (collective *gasp*)  Yes, I know, it's very sad, I feel like I should have a proper burial for this flimsy little piece of paper.  This paper that has shielded me from train conductors from here to Italy to the Czech Republic.  This paper that has been the source of panic attacks if it was not where it was supposed to be, and the source of relief and joy when found.  This paper will never carry me across another border.  R.I.P. little Eurail.  You were loved and will be greatly missed.

       Five things that I normally don't think that become absolute gospel to me when I am sick:   1. It is totally 100% worth it to spend the extra money to buy the tissues infused with lotion. 2. I am, despite what I usually say, a HUGE baby and will never be too old to feel homesick for my mom and my sister! 3. Cosmopolitan magazine is perfectly legitamate and stimulating reading material. 4. You can never ever EVER have too many stuffed animals surrounding you in bed. 5. There is no sweeter smell than the smell of Vicks Vapo-Rub!

       So...I'm sick.   Chris has been sick, so it was just a matter of time.  It also doesn't help that I don't get much sleep.  Rehearsals are going strong for lots of shows right now...all of which I hope will be attended by as many of you as possible.    Speaking of shows, there is a show this weekend that every dancer in the greater Boston area should attend.  Rainbow Tribe, The Dance Company, is having a concert this weekend called "In The Queue".  Tickets are available on the Rainbow Tribe website or though TicketMaster.    What else is going on?  Hmmm...  I'll get back to you...

So...  well....  uummmmm.............  ........................................  ................................................i'm not in europe anymore.  No matter where I am in the world, however, I will always be the one, the only....The LizaBean!!  So, Chris worked a little of his computer magic and changed my little addressy thingy and TAH-DAH...different address, same patented-exclamation-point-filled-lizabean madness!  Quick update:  Yes, I miss Europe. Yes, I have a veritable buttload of pictures and souvenirs that you may all peruse at your discretion. Yes, the semester abroad was amazing and I love every second, and... YES, I am glad to be back.  There's a reason that I have lived in Boston for four and a half years now...it kicks lots of ass and I love it!  So...we're all caught up!!

       You learn something new every day...   For instance, in the last two days, while hobbling around Boston on crutches, I've learned that the most revolting, atrocious, offensive, foul, nauseating places on the face of the planet are the elevators in the subway station!!!  Wow, I'm so glad that they just raised the fare by a quarter!!

       It's always something, isn't it?!   So...it's finals time, I have final performances, dance rehearsals, final papers to turn in, and next week I was hoping to pick up some hours at Borders in order to get my bank balance back into the black.  So, of course, what happens?  I fall down some stairs and sprain my ankle!  Of course!!!  HAHAHAHAHA!!!  Wow, so, yeah, right after my ballet final on Tuesday morning (yes BALLET, get it? balance? grace?) I headed over to Cambridge to watch the first of my Performance Art Class's final performances.  I got there a little late, as did one other girl, because we both had earlier classes.  Well, the performance was in the basebent of one of the group member's apartment building.  Now, if you know New England, you know that apartment building basements can be very VERY sketchy!!  This one was divided up into a few different segments, and each segment had its own stairwell.  Well, we could hear the performance going on somewhere in the basement, but we couldn't find out how to get there, so we were running around on a bunch of steps and 'whoops...crack!'  Liza's down for the count.  Blech!

       Holy God in Heaven...it's early!!   So, you may wonder what the frig I'm doing awake at 6:57 in the morning on a Sunday.  I myself am wondering the same thing......  .....wait, no I'm not......I know why I woke up.......wait..........it'll come to me.......just let me have a little....  (takes a sip of coffee.  Eyes suddenly snap into focus.)  Oh my goodness!  Good morning everyone!  How are you all on this fine Sunday morning!  I'm so glad I'm awake because I have so much to do today in order to get all of my work done for the end of the semester!  Wish me luck as I plow through my to-do list!!  God bless caffiene!!!

       The party's over! (a.k.a. Please excuse me while I bawl my eyes out!!!)   So, as you may know, I have been working in a couple of shows this semester.  One of them was "Eros & MUSEic", which closed tonight, and I am so sad!!  This cast was just simply one of the best I have ever been a part of.  Now, if you know me, you know that it usually takes me a little while to come out of my shell with a new group of peeps.  And, at our first rehearsal, when I only knew one person and the majority of other people were FRESHMEN (gasp!) I thought that I would never feel like I fit in.    SO NOT TRUE!!!!!!!  Each and every one of the people in the cast and crew is amazing, not just in terms of talent, but in personality.  So encouraging and accepting!  I mean, I got to choreograph a number, and I was SO nervous!  When I went to practice the night I taught it, I thought I was going to puke or something!!  I thought that they wouldn't want to hear what an old lady like me (I was born in the 70's!!!)  has to say about sexy dancing and gettin' your groove on! (OMG, I'm such a dork!)  But I left practice that night feeling like I had just done the best work of my life, because of the enthusiasm of these peoples!  And so it went for the rest of rehearsals.  I have learned so much about encouragement, acceptance, and support...and all from people who can't even legally drink yet!    So, here's a thanks to all my home-skillets: Julie, Dayna, Aaron, Haley, Briana, Ken, JP, Shira, Haley, Cydney, Alex, Brittany, Jeff, Peter, Raquel, Amanda, & Emily!  I love each one of you! XOXOXOXOXO (and a butt sqeeze!)  I hope I work with each of you again someday!  Peace out!

       Happy Easter/Cirque Weekend!   So, apparently, in addition to this being Easter weekend, it is also 'All Cirque Weekend' on Bravo.  I guess nothing says 'Crucifixion and Resurrection' quite like androginous contortionists in spandex!  Right now, for instance, there is a strange squealing clown gargling "Mr. Bubble" and drooling all over the place...hhmmmm......there is also a fake audience (made up of more performers) all wearing Comedia del Arte-inspired masks that the camera keeps zooming in on.    I haven't been this frightened of something on tv since Sam was fired on The Apprentice!

       One of the reasons that Didi rocks:   I say  one of  because there are many!  Fierce dancer, kick-ass choreographer, genious...but here's the kicker...GREAT FRIEND!!  I know that it's Easter weekend and money is tight, so I'm not upset that most people couldn't make it to my show tonight, but I am so happy that Didi could!  I walked out onto the dark stage and took my place, facing away from the audience, and then I heard the loudest "LIZA!" I've ever heard.  Those of you who have danced with her before know that Didi's voice is unmistakable!  It felt so great to have a cheerleader in this setting where I am 'the new girl'!    Didi, if you're reading this, thanks and I love you!!!!  Everyone else, I love you all too (I'll just love you more if you scream my name at the top of your lungs in a crowd of strangers!  JUST KIDDING!!!)    Seriously, the show went really well, and now it's on to the next thing!  Hope to see you all there!

      Je dois aller a ma classe de francais, et je la deteste. (Translation: I have to go to French class and I hate it!)  Don't get me wrong, I love the language, and I have fun attempting to speak it with some of the amazing people I know who are fluent (I'm so jealous).  But the class is the most torturous thing I do during the week.  It's not because of the teacher...he's a great teacher...I am just really bad at French!  Give me Spanish any day of the week!  So, what is everyone doing for Easter/Passover/this weekend?!  I myself am going to pray and be thankful (yes, I am a fan of the J-man!) and then spend the afternoon and evening cooking for friends...kind of an open-house, "come over when you want and let's enjoy our day off" thing.  I know that Briana and Jessica are in like Flynn, and if anyone else will be in the greater Boston area, pretty please stop by!  I have a roofdeck!  it rocks!!!  Whatever you do this weekend, have fun!!

       I'm playing hooky! (Don't worry mom, this is the only day I've done this at Emerson...ever!)   And anyways, it's French class, no dancing, singing or acting will be missed.  Why would such a smart, dedicated girl be playing hooky? you ask?  Well, I'll tell you...Audrey's here!  For those of you who are not familiar with Audrey, the best 11 year old in the world...she is Chris's daughter!  A blue-eyed, blond-haired, five foot five, extremely giggly girl!  I love her!  So figure that missing out on one hour of sitting in a sterile classroom trying to decipher what my French teacher is saying so that we can all sleep in and then eat toaster waffles together is worth it.  And then later, we're going to see "The Prince and Me"...all I know is, it has Julia Stiles in it, and I think she's pretty nifty!  The rest of my weekend?  What weekend?!?!  I have rehearsal from 10-6 on Saturday and from 10-3 on Sunday...OY!  I'm so pumped!!  Can you believe that two and a half years ago my life consisted of a desk job, working for idiots, spending all of my energy on things that I didn't care about and now my only responsibility this weekend is to dance well and sing pretty?!?!  I LOVE IT!!!!!  Two of the shows I'm in are coming up very soon.  Here is the info, since you all have been asking.  Saturday, April 10th  urlLink EnMotion Inc. Hip Hop Dance Troupe  $12, 7:00 in The Auditorium at Bunker Hill Community College I am in the Training Company at EnMotion.  The show is the Training Company, both performing companies, and the teens and childrens programs.  The choreography is TIGHT and the dancers are fierce!  This should be a really fun .  Saturday, April 17th at 2:00 and Sunday April 18th at 8:00 Eros and MUSEic: A musical review of love, lust, and everything in between! FREE!!! In room 21 of the Emerson Student Union, 96 Beacon Street (Show up early...it's a small house!) This is going to be really fun!  Julie Goldin, director extraordinaire, has put together one of the best casts I've ever been a part of.  Even the call-backs for this show were fun!  We will be singing songs that run the gamut from heartbreak to doin' the (ahem, you know what!). (An added bonus, yours truly got to choreograph a number!) Be there or be L7!!!!!!!!!  Well, I'm audi!  I have an 11 year old to hang out with!  Everyone have a great weekend and I'll see you next Saturday at my show!

       The Show's Over....   Well, my last show of this semester, the Jeannette Neill Dance Studio show, is over.  I slept until 11:15 today!!  Hoo-rah!  The show went really well, Didi's jazz number, and Sybil's hip hop number, during which Sybil tapped in the night shows and yours truly tapped in the matinee, were very well-received by the audiences.  I think everyone involved had a blast.  And then of course, there's the best part of performing...new friends from both groups!!!    Now it's on to a summer of earning as much money as possible during the week, and hanging out with friends as much as possible during the weekend.    AND...also this summer...I will become a three-time auntie!!  That's right, Shana and Roger just can't seem to stop!  Wish the fam lukc as we get ready to welcome our new baby girl!!  Peace out!

       My New Arch Nemesis...   ... Alex!  (You have to say this a la Jerry Seinfeld saying 'Newman')  So, I'm practically unemployed...Yup, you heard me. I have absolutely no money in my bank account, and currently all of my days are free.  Those who know me know that, in this situation, I can usually be found at Borders, crawling around the sales floor, doing whatever needs to be done in order to make a buck.    However, I am currently at home, with nothing to do.  Why?  Despite my repeated requests for hours at Borders, and making HR aware of my availability and willingness to work in whatever area of the store needs help, I haven't been given any shifts.  Why?  You would have to ask the current HR manager, Alex, who won't give me a straight answer to any of my questions.    I'm not sure what's going on, but it's not good.  I don't know what Alex has against me...although he has made some inappropriate comments about how my relationship with Chris might keep us from being productive were we scheduled together upstairs.  Well, guess what, we've been dating and working together for 4 years, jerk-face, and have been repeatedly  complemented  by other managers on our teamwork.    So, I'm transferring to the Borders in Cambridge.  It's not my first choice, but I think it will be a nice break, it is a much lower volume store.  Also, the management there is aware of the fact that I'm a good employee...Louisa's been trying to get me over there since she transferred a few years ago.  Of course, I would prefer to stay downtown...it's closer to my apartment, Chris and Jessica work there, and I've been there so long I know every dirty little corner of the building...but aparently Alex would rather give all the payroll hours to some of the extremely unproductive employees who are there now, and to new hires.    GGGGRRRRRRR.......Liza's mad!!!

I'll have Chris take a look at it this weekend, and hopefully they will be back soon.  Speaking of this weekend, wish me luck for my show tonight.  I'm dancing at the Evvy's, Emerson's big campus-wide awards show.  We are going to be televised, though I'm not sure on what station...I'm sure it's some public access show.  To read more check out evvy.org.  Sorry, I can't get the hyperlinks to work either.  The best part of this show?  My costume is a black, shiny, full-body catsuit.  Liza in a catsuit...can you say Hottie-bo-Bottie?!?!?!  Alright, I have to go get my sweat on!  Peace out!

       The Very Definition of Tacky!!   So, I don't know if you agree with me or not, but one of my least favorite fashion trends that I have seen in my life is the whole "accidentally on purpose I'm going to let my thong pop out of the top of my pants" trend.  I hate it!  Hate it hate it HATE IT!  And it's not that I'm a prude either!  I like seeing women, and being a woman, confidently flaunting what we have.  (Work it baby, work it!  Own it! Own it!) ...if you don't recognzie that quote, you need to rent Pretty Woman  right now ! But by 'what we have' I mean curves, long legs, whatever it is that your body has...NOT YOUR UNDERWEAR!!  So, today, Chris and I are walking and we see some hooch taking this to a whole new level... she had a thong tattooed on her bum!!!   That's right, peeking out of the top of her low-cut jeans was the little 'Y' shape we all know and loathe, but this time it was part of her skin, in the typical tattoo green.  AAAHHHH!!!  Honestly!  What are you going to tell your grandkids?!?! "Well, honey, when grandma was young, the fellas thought I had a really nice..."  What's going on?!?!?!

       It’s my birthday!!   That’s right, folks.  The LizaBean was born 25 years ago today!  So what am I doing to celebrate?  Why, work at Borders...of course!!  I kind of celebrated yesterday because I actually had the whole day off, a phenomenon which hadn’t occured for about two weeks.  Chris and I slept in, stopped by the store to say ‘Hola’ to Sanchez, and then walked from Downtown Crossing over to Charles Street, then across the river, then all the way up Mass Ave to Harvard Square, stopping along the way for snacks, rests, and the occasional public restroom (if you’ve been reading this blog since my stint in Europe, you know how small my bladder is.)  Right now I’m on my lunch break at work, in the cafe, having some chipotle chili and a pretzel.  Chris had some flowers delivered (sigh) and hopefully we’ll hang out tonight.  I haven’t really seen any other friends, because most of them aren’t in the state right now, but it’s all good, I know I’m loved!!  Happy Birthday to me!!!

       Don’t get your pantyhose in a bunch...   I’m here.  I’m alive.  I’m blogging.    Don’t think that my blog has been the only thing in my life lately that has been neglected.  Friends, family, my hair...you name it, I haven’t been paying attention to it.  Why?  Because for this little moment, the only things I have to do are work and sleep.  Of course, there are other things I COULD do, and am doing a little.  I pay bills, I fight with my financial aid officer, I make lists of things that I can do to further my career once I graduate in December (don’t worry, I sometimes actually DO those things too).  But for right now, I’m going to give myself a couple weeks of repose.  I think I’ve earned it.  And if you don’t agree, well then, a plague on both your houses!  What else has happened lately...  Well, I transferred stores, Bye Alex!!  The new store has it’s problems like any other retail establishment (jerky customers, miscommunications, stock issues) but it is nothing even close to the amount of wrongness that one encounters every day downtown.  This past Sunday there was a store meeting in Cambridge, and the whole staff was there...probably about 25 people.  SO FUN!!!  Oh, and the best part, on my last day downtown, I won Employee of the Month!  HAHAHA  Alex is a NERD!!  Oh AND I’M GOING TO BE AN AUNITE FOR THE THIRD TIME!!!!  Mariah is scheduled to arrive on June 28th, just one week after my birthday.  What a great present!!    Nothing else is really new.  If anyone has advice, job leads, anything like that in regards to my impending matriculation with a double major in Theatre Studies/Musical Theatre and Philosophy and Minor in Dance, let me know.  I know, I know...what’s up with my degrees?  It’s like I’m TRYING to be poor.    Peace out!

       I've noticed a disturbing trend...   ...while watching Everybody Loves Raymond and Will & Grace.  See, these are two of my favorite shows, I love them.  Will & Grace is the prefect comedic depiction of life with friends in the big city, and Raymond is the perfect depiction of married life with kids in the suburbs.    Now, it used to be that I would watch both but would be more drawn towards Will & Grace, in terms of situations that I found appealing for me personally.  I live in a relatively large city, am in classes preparing to enter a career that is NOT easy, and spend most if my time with friends.  Voila...my life should be called "Liza & Chris"...except, of course, Chris is not gay.  However, lately, I have noticed that I am more and more drawn to Everybody Loves Raymond.  Marriage, in-laws, mortgages, kids....flowered conforters and, here's an idea, a yard!  Sooooo scary!!!!  Realistically, I know that what I really want is something in the middle.  At least, that is the answer that I come up with every time I talk to someone about this.  But really, we're not talking about geographic places, where I can measure where the exact middle is and just, ya know, pitch a tent.    Honestly, when I say I want the middle, really...what the hell does that mean?!?!

       Well, boys and girls,  this  is going to be a fun night...   That’s right, here’s the deal...I just got out of dance practice, so I’m covered in sweat and really tired.  I’m at work, scheduled to clock in at 5:00.  I ate a blueberry smoothie, so my whole mouth is blue, and two of the closing peeps called out, AND our closing manager is sick, but coming in for the last half of his shift anyway.    FUN!!!  Wish us all luck!!

       For 23 years, I was fine...   ...without a cell phone.  I kept in touch with friends, I got things accomplished, everything in life ran smoothly.  Or at least, as smoothly as possible for a busybody social butterfly...  so why, now, is there such a MOOcow if communication is not immediate?!  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I love having a phone most of the time.  I like having it when I meeting up with peeps, running late for something, intercepting out-of-town visitors who are lost, things like that.  But there is such an emphasis now talking RIGHT AWAY!!  I mean just because a phone physically fits in my pocket doesn't mean I put it there all the time, leave it on all the time, or answer it all the time.  Sometimes, I turn it off, or leave it at home.  I check messages and get back to people when I can.  Pre-cell phone days, this was fine, so why is it unacceptable now?!?!
