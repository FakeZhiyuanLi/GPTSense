      Saturday I went to see Audrey and Sophie march in the parade, they were awesome, then I was going to hang around their house until about 1:30, but then their mom invited me to do stuff with them the entire day and them spend the night, so I called my mom and left a message, and told her to call be back at A&S's house. Then we left to go do stuff (what happens at Mardens, Stays at Mardens). And around 5 we came back. They checked the messages and there was five, from my family alone, so I called my mom, and I told her were I was, and she told me she was coming to pick me up and then she hung up the phone. YIKES! She was pissed. And then they yelled at me for a bit, and then she said I was grounded, and I hope this ends soon because there's going to  be parties and stuff next weekend... ::sigh::

        To those who've adopted the EL Freshmen...  ::Sniffle:: So today was the Seniors last day... It was very sad. Though I didn't really show it, I felt the need to go up to everyone I know and give them a hug, like a BIG hug... So to all the Seniors at EL, even those I've never met: I wish each and everyone of you the best of luck in the future... I wish that I would have gotten to know all of you a little more... The sadness I feel is for me, because I will no longer so you guys on a regular basis, though I hope we will still have our little weekend trips. But for you all, I feel hope and anticipation for the future. I hope you will all fill your own definition of success. I hope that we will all keep in touch, I miss you all already and EL will never be the same... The halls and cafeteria will all seem so empty, next week will be so strange, one quarter of the schools population will be missing, missing and never come back, I believe the sad realization of the fact that I will never get the chance to see y'all ever again has finally washed over my body, though my mind has been refusing the fact for the entire week. As previously stated, I wish you all the very best of luck! I love you, class of 2004!                                        With a watery streak on my cheek I say goodbye...                                                    Kalie

      Yeah, so I think the title sums it up, but just in case you feel I should elaborate on it, I will.  It started off when I got up late, which means I got to sleep more, then I actually didn't miss the bus. Once at school I realized that i had a notebook check I Geometry. After this realization I then realized that  I didn't have my geometry binder... Then I talked to my teacher and she was so understanding! She's like just bring it in on Friday, if you can find it...  So then the bell rang, and I wasn't late to class, then once in English we watched Romeo and Juliet, the new version which I thinks rocks! And then in intagrated arts I finished my masterpiece! (well actually it's kinda bad, but the best thing I've done in a while) and then we worked on a linear perspective, which is kinda fun. Then in geometry, we just worked on class work and then played a game, I wasn't there on Tuesday (read posts below to find out why) so it was the first time I'd ever played, and I was in the lead with points for the longest time, but at the end I came in second because of one point. So it was a good day at school. Then my mom picked me up and we had to go to CVS for something, then I ran into Brandon... We talked for a bit and then he said that a bunch of us are going to see Shrek 2 Saturday, you should come. And i agreed, So now we are plotting a large gathering of people... Then we went to the Dairy Joy, where I'm trying to branch out.. So I had a Half Strawberry, Half Orange, it wasn't too bad!...  Feel free to comment on your day...

      Hey everyone who reads this..  So yesterday was loads of fun... I took and Independent Study Day and went to Brandons house (which I love, along with his dog, Annie) to watch all 3 LOTR movies in a LOTRMME, which was fun though only 2 people came besides Brian and Brandon, and that was Megan and I. But Megs had to leave early because of a misunderstanding that resulted in her being grounded for 1 month and she also having to write a paper, "Why you shouldn't lie to your parents, and what happens when you do." I'm sooo sorry Megs! So then i was there, with Brian and Brandon, kinda akward at times, but fun none the less. Then I had to leave like more than 3 hours early... Which did suck because not only had I not seen the "Return of the King" after I left, EVERYBODY else came!! So that kinda made me mad, but I guess I'll have to get over it. I also now know for sure that I'm indecisive... I think  Then today, in my, once favorite, science class, after getting all "A"'s all year, I find out that my teacher isn't going to GIVE a final, instead, he made us watch "Armageddon" and now we have to make a friggin' comic strip about it with the meteor as the main character. WTF! i though that this was a college prep. course, WTF am i doing making a comic strip, and this is not only in place of a Final, it's also a portfolio entry. (DAMN YOU BUSH!!) and you may say, well Kalie, why are you so pissed about that? My answer to that is: Because I've worked too friggin hard to get exempt from a, now non existent, final. My opinion is that I have not worked that hard ALL year to do the  same   thing as the peopel in my class that are getting a 45.  AND  even before the movie started Libby asked him if we would have to make comic strips... His response: "No, no comic strip this time." Because believe it or not folks, we've made comic strips before. And another question... WTF does this have to do with science?!?!

      So yea, I had a bunch of interesting conversations today... Not one interesting thing or another in any of them ... Just interesting, like who knew that Max's favorite TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle) was the red one (Donnatelo?). Just stuff like that. I just thought that the very few people who read this should know... lol

      Hey all! just got back from Libby's party, it was fun but short... i'm kinda hyper, i had a corner piece of cake, which means MORE FROSTING!! so i'm kinda hyper... it was actually her dogs birthday, but her party because her birthday is in 9 days, but in 8 days is her sisters prom, so she didn't want to take away from it... which is nice... but it was lots of fun...  i'll probably update more later if anyone cares...

      Hey everyone who reads this! (If anyone does) I just thought I'd make a blog even though I already have a livejournal, this seems so much better! So yea, I'm gonna mess around with this for a bit, check back later! I love y'all!

      I've decided that I'm not going to be sad, depressed, "down in the dumps" or any other thing that has similar meanings. It isn't doing me any good. Instead I'm going to say "oops" and move on, nothing more can be done. So I'm now happy, and I'm going to stay happy at all costs, and I'm going to make all of my friends happy, why not.  My new philosophy is "I'm only saying I'm sorry once" because dwelling on the negative doesn't do anyone any good.

      Basically, I just made a friendship awkward... The one thing I'm good at. So I'm trying to get out of my slump by listening to music. The following are lyrics that describe the way I wish someone would feel about me: "Brand New Colony" I'll be the grapes fermented, Bottled and served with the table set in my finest suit Like a perfect gentlemen I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick Where you will sit and contemplate your day I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning In an open tab when your judgement's on the brink I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite Albums back as your lying there drifting off to sleep... I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you... You won't have to strain to look into my eyes I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zippedstraight to the throat With the collar up so you won't catch a cold I want to take you far from the cynics in this town And kiss you on the mouth We'll cut out bodies free from the tethers of this scene, Start a brand new colony Where everything will change, We'll give ourselves new names, identities erased The sun will heat the grounds Under our bare feet in this brand new colony Everything will change, oOo oOo...  "Such Great Heights" I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles In our eyes are mirror images and when We kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate that God himself Did make us into corresponding shapes like Puzzle pieces from the clay True, it may seem like a stretch, but Its thoughts like this that catch my troubled Head when you're away when I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road for Several weeks of shows and when you scan The radio, I hope this song will guide you home They will see us waving from such great Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away, 'come down now,' but we'll stay... I tried my best to leave this all on your Machine but the persistent beat it sounded Thin upon listening That frankly will not fly. you will hear The shrillest highs and lowest lows with The windows down when this is guiding you home  so thats it...  Wow, I'm so lonely....

      So I'm still grounded.... It's bad, but i did manage to get a HUGE piece of the giant, 15 pound whoopee pie... Executive board, class of 2007, you rule... It was very good.  i hate being grounded... You can't do anything... And i didn't really do anything wrong... i just didn't dial seven digits... And it's only because i forgot... Its bad... only one more day of classes and then finals... Kirsty and i are hopefully going to study together... If my mom feels like letting me get a good grade and thus letting me get  a scholorship to a good college, so she won't have to pay... and I'm talking to a friend ... He moved to Montana... And didn't tell me when he was leaving, then he just left... And now we are talking ... Online... Yeah...  and Brian got in a car accident... i wonder if it hit the right side of his Volvo.. That would be creepy... i don' know if anyone has any idea what I'm talking about... i have to take all of my finals, except for study hall (duh) and science b cuz mogul decided that he wasn't going to give one... sorry if that was hard to follow, i don't call it random for nothing

        yup... I was just thinking about how lazy I was for not updating in forever... Then I felt guilty... Though it's not like anyone reads this...   so this past week I've been incredibly bored except for going to see ONE movie which is sad, anyway the notebook wasn't bad...&nbsp;Anyway, then today&nbsp;I was so happy when  Sophie called me, they've been in Penns-ville and they are coming home tonight! ...So hopefully they won't be too tired and will want to so to Portland with me...    &nbsp; and sadly I'm excited for school... Because I have no life... Oh... And if anyone reads this... "Rob is the man" and furthermore "Kalie is the wo-man"

      So as you can imagine the summer is going well, the job search isn't. I have recently realized that I need money desperately... Now that every other day I'm asked to lunch or the movies or what have you, and everything costs money... An increasing amount of money... So I need a job to pay for everything, and also for new clothes... I think I'm getting a fetish for pants... And underwear ;) .  on other topics, still no boyfriend in sight, not sure if it's a good thing or not... I've come this far without one.... Why do I need one now? BECAUSE I DO!! ::sigh::  anyway... I'm going to make it a point to hang out with people that I haven't in a while... And I also need to meet new people, I need to meet Katie... She lives in Mass but we've been talking online and stuff, she seems really chill (yes, I know that statement is REALLY old, so I'm just trying to bring it back... HELP! lol) and now Katie is  in Maine for summer camp! And even better... AT BATES! So we are almost certain to meet... It'll be so strange.... The fourth was pretty fun... We (Audrey, Sophie, and I) went down to the dairy joy at about 7:00, then Megan came and met up with us on our way back on the snake trail...Then we had to go get hotdog buns at CVS because Brandon was working and we had to "torment" him, and Brian was there too so it was a 2 for 1 deal.... And they were out of buns so we had to cross to Hannaford and almost got run over (THANX MEGS!!) so we got the buns went back to CVS because Brandon told us to.. But he wasn't there, so we waited by his Jetta... And still no show, then some one told us that he went down to the tracks for the 'works show... So we went back to Audrey and Sophie's lawn, and after the 'works were over at about 10:30 guess who calls?! Brandon, and he asks where we were! So I took the phone and asked him where HE was, he said he waited for us but needless to say he didn't... Oh well at least we got to see him for a while...  that's it... P.S. I got my second holes!! YAY!!
