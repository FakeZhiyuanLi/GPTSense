						   Pacific Internet will offer an all-wireless broadband service to two condominiums here as part of a technology trial starting next month.   Competition in broadband services - and Internet bandwidth in general - is hotting up once more, thanks to wireless technology.   Pacific Internet (PacNet), the number three Internet service provider here, is set to offer an all-wireless broadband service to condominiums here in the coming months.    To be provided free of charge initially, it is part of a technology trial that may possibly open up the bandwidth market and let consumers and businesses surf the Net more cheaply.   Starting next month, residents of Katong Tower and The Anchorage can expect to go online wirelessly from their apartments. Each household will get up to 4Mbps of bandwidth.   PacNet is now installing Wi-Fi equipment to cover condo compounds, while a wireless backhaul connection links the condos to the ISP's Internet gateways.    Mr Wong Kok Hoou, PacNet's vice-president of engineering and network operations, told Computer Times that this is the first all-wireless broadband service in Singapore.   He expects about 10 condominiums - and about 100 households from each development - to sign up by the year's end. Prices for a commercial rollout are not finalised yet.  Wireless alternative   For home users, PacNet's wireless offering provides an alternative to similar services from SingTel and StarHub.   StarHub currently offers MaxOnline cable modem services and SingTel has its SingNet Broadband services which are based on asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL). An unlimited surfing service from either service provider costs about $55 a month.   Current cable modem user Joseph Goh, 29, said that PacNet's wireless service can make a difference if it offers more value. 'Price and speed are the main things users look for.'   Businesses will also be watching if such wireless services take off. The PacNet trial, which is partly funded by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), appears to be another ambitious attempt to break up SingTel's monopoly on local leased circuits (LLCs).   LLCs are key telecoms infrastructure used to provide data, voice and Internet services to corporations. International telcos often rely on LLCs to connect their customers' regional offices to Singapore branches.   SingTel has about 60 per cent of the LLC market here, according to an IDA report released last year. Not surprisingly, many companies which lease LLCs from the dominant telco often complain about a lack of competition.   If PacNet's wireless link proves successful, the company - and indeed other telcos and their customers - may find an alternative to SingTel's wire line infrastructure.   This, according to an IDA spokesman, can make bandwidth prices more competitive. In turn, it becomes cheaper to go online.   Regulating thin air   Much now depends on how the IDA regulates new wireless technology. If it makes telcos pay a high price for the radio spectrum, they may stay put with the more reliable land lines.   In the past, the infocomm regulator has encouraged - with limited success - the building of an alternative infrastructure to SingTel's to boost Singapore's competitiveness in telecoms services.   In 2001, it tried auctioning part of the radio spectrum for a wireless technology known as local multipoint distribution service (LMDS). There were no takers because of the technology's limitations and the add-on cost of a licence from IDA.   Then came news last year that powerline communications (PLC), which makes use of electric cables to transfer data, would not be rolled out after several companies ran extensive trials on it.   Frost and Sullivan analyst Danny Tay said that wireless infrastructure will find its niche in the market place, but may face challenges in Singapore, which is well-wired with fibre optic cables.   He said that new wireless infrastructure, though a cheaper alternative to digging up roads to lay cables, is still add-on cost for ISPs like PacNet. In contrast, SingTel's fixed line network is 'sunk cost'.   SingTel was not overly worried when asked about PacNet's new wireless trials. Said spokesman Chia Boon Chong: 'Physical-line connections, such as fibre optic links, offer a more secure and reliable grade of service.'   HOW IT WORKS   It is expensive to dig up roads and lay network cables. So, many telcos and Internet service providers (ISPs) are making use of wireless technologies in the 'last mile' to hook up their business and residential customers to the Net.   Pacific Internet is using a proprietary radio frequency (RF) technology to offer its wireless broadband service. The ISP said that it makes use of the 2.5GHz spectrum and is capable of 10 to 14Mbps.   An antenna is set up on say, a condo in Katong, to transfer data to PacNet's Internet gateways in Science Park. At the condo, data is fed from the antenna receiver to end-users using Wi-Fi.

						   The PC engine is going to be souped up with greater speed, better visuals and improved security.   If you thought the PC is dying, think again. Even as handheld devices become more powerful each day, the beige box is working harder to woo users once more with unbridled power.   Equipped with faster processors, improved memory modules and speedier graphics cards, the PC of the next 12 months will bring more performance to gamers, photo buffs and just about anyone - even if they only use the PC to surf the Web.   Need for speed   Expect processor clock speeds to touch 4GHz. Intel's 3.4GHz 'Prescott' Pentium 4 is the current speed king for the giant chip maker. So 4GHz by next year is not an impractical target, if you ask chip makers.   Being produced in a 90-nanometer process means the latest iteration of the Pentium 4 generates less heat than previous Pentium 4 chips. So, higher speeds, beyond 3GHz, are possible.   Performance is also helped by having more cache memory on the chip - 16KB for level 1 and 1MB for level 2.   Intel's rival, AMD, is also expected to come up with an equivalent performer - just like it did previously when Intel raised the stakes in the gigahertz race.   Whether it will come up with a 4000+ rating is unclear. But AMD fans can probably rest assured that, as the 'alternative' chip maker out there, it will come up with a processor that matches Intel's performance at a lower price.   Memory makeover   On the memory front, PC buffs will hear more about DDR2-SDRAM - an update to the popular DDR-SDRAM (double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory) available on most motherboards now.   Already used in high-end graphics cards, DDR2 memory offers speedy access to data when used as system memory on a PC motherboard. The bad news is, the transition to a PC may take longer than initially expected.   Initial DDR2 modules sporting 400MHz speeds will actually perform slower than current DDR modules running at the same speed. No thanks to the increased latency associated with the technology.   Only with speeds of at least 533MHz, according to some reports, will DDR2's benefits be obvious to PCs. Because of the complexity of producing memory modules running at these speeds, vendors may take until next year to offer DDR2 to the mass market.   On the bright side, Intel has DDR2 in its roadmaps and AMD has run tests on DDR2.   More eye candy   This year, great visuals are also in store for PC gamers. This is especially important for the discerning gamer.   ATI and Nvidia recently announced graphics processing units (GPUs) that will come just in time for such gamers, who are willing to fork out $700 to $800 for the best visual experience.   If Doom 3 and Half-Life 2 are launched - they are expected in the coming months - the extra muscle will be needed to run these visually rich games that demand the most expensive GPUs out there.   This is a cue for the ATI X800 XT and Nvidia 6800 Ultra Extreme - the fastest GPUs to power graphics cards now.   Of course, all the data that is processed by the cards need to be quickly transported around the PC. This is where the PCI Express bus, the replacement for AGP (advanced graphics port) and PCI (peripheral component interconnect) come in.   With PCI Express graphics cards (and possibly soundcards) plugged into a motherboard that supports the new technology, users can remove a potential performance bottleneck on their PCs. PCI Express chipsets and motherboards are already available. Now, it's a matter of peripherals catching up.   Why more power?   So, why the need for all that performance? It's the same reason why people upgrade from any old PC to a new one: The need for speed is insatiable.   For techies, the new technologies are a boost to ageing PC standards. AGP has been around for six years. DDR-SDRAM for over two years. A big performance upgrade, if you ask a PC enthusiast, is always welcome.    EXPECT THIS   Here are some components you may find in a high-end PC in the next 12 months.    Intel Pentium 4 4GHz or AMD Athlon 64 FX 4000+ (possible specs) 2GB DDR2-SDRAM memory (running at 667MHz) ATI X800 XT/ Nvidia 6800 Ultra Extreme 400GB Hitachi hard disk Dual-format DVD writer 19-inch LCD monitor Windows XP with SP2   These are not vapourware products. With the exception of the processor and memory modules, the other components are already available or have actual production samples.   The next monster PC you own might well sport some of them
