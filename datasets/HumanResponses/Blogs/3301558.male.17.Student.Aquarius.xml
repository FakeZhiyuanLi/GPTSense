      its a boring day and im trying to make it interesting...  went to the mall bought a new cap!! well,Gloria macapagal is still our president,so i guess not much will be changing around the country!! well,she could get assasinated by some communist people and the country would be put down by the army and the people could suffer more..hope that doesn't happen.. people people people,instead of complaining that the government sucks!! y not take action and make it better..you cant expect the president to clean up all the mess made by the people of her country.. the president's job(i think) is to lead the people to make things right for everyone.. Gloria,actually wasn't bad at all as a president..of course i wanted eddie V. to win..his a Christian and all.. but Gloria wasn't a bad president..she made many things..just imagine if gloria didn't win..the MRT from marikina to divisoria would be left hanging there..and the new government won't take action bout it at all...the wasted money...so please,don't feel bad that Gloria is still our president... just pray for the country and hope for the best!!! ryt?? wala lang po!! wahahahahaha!!!

      just came home from the ccf summer camp, back to the real world i guess... back in camp, i envied people who have commited thier life's to God so i decided to commit myself to Him too.. now, as a new born Christian, i want to grow more and more while forgetting this world's patterns and pleasures.. still need a lot(and i mean a lot) of growing and help from other christians...
