      Today, maxine got mad at me and i have no idea how!! yesterday me and her had a conversation ( i guess) and she thought i was being mean and stuff and i don't know how and she printed out our conversation thing and she showed her parents and her sister and i had a conversation with her sister today too...........i kept on LMAO cuz' she kept telling me that i shouldn't make fun of lil kids and to get a life (well, if u look at my blog u would see that i have a life!!!) and i was just like.....ok.....i'll make sure i do and it was so funny!!! but i feel mean now, and maxine thinks i'm mean and i have no idea what i said...........u see the problem with IM is that u can't really tell if the person is being sarcastic, but o well, she's a lil kid and she probably took it the wrong way. and i DID say sry and i said i would change but her sister kept telling me that i better change and i kept saying i would and she let the conversation keep going and going, it's like she wants the argument to last long.......but TORI helped me today and i know what to do now, she's really good with the therapy thing......  Anyways.....i was the first one at rehearsal and the door was locked......and i got lil red bumps on my arms during rehearsal!!! it's probably cuz' i got slivers but still, the set isn't done so that's y it happened but everyone got it too so i'm not alone, HA HA. we were off book today and it was kool cuz' i didn't have to worry a bit, i never said LINE today! and on monday we have a costume parade and i finally get to see the greenroom.....yup....and i think that dana thinks i'm a lil control freak.....OOO!!! we got to wear our real masks! mine felt like it was to big but i'll get use to it and i got my axe and rake! the axe is for mr. antonioni and the rake is for truffaldino....and the well came too but idk who's going to put it onstage....and emily's blue parrot was here too....  OOO!!! tomorrow is my mom's bday and me and my dad got roses for her at cub foods and a lil letter too....me and my bros signed it  HA HA, i'm such a spoiled brat. my dad told me and the bitch to wash the car and the bitch told me to soap it and i didn't want to so my dad taught me to mow...it was my first time....and i kept pretending that i was doing it wrong but i can perfectly do it right.....but i think i did a pretty good job, but my dad stopped me mowing and he wanted to mow.....and he's still doing it.....BYE!  ME  p.s. dot dot dot tomorrow me and my family r going up north so i won't be writing in my blog for the whole weekend dot dot dot  p.s.s. my sis got a new cell phone!

      HA HA, i saw that on emily's shirt today so i'll just go right ahead and put it for my title cuz titles r so hard to make up.....those damn titles......sooooooooo we got to be onstage today!!! but we didn't get to see the greenroom.......and part of the wagon was there, well, the basic stuff was, the person (i forgot his name) who made it just needs to put the other stuff, like the decorations.......we almost did a run through, just up to the end of scene 6. and tomorrow were off book, and i STILL need to memorize the blockings and my lines. o well, i'll do that l8er and plus diana said that we could yell line if we forgot. i finally know how to pronouce her name!! de-ana, i'm so stoopid. if any one from pinn is reading this then keep it to urself........OOOO, we might have our real masks tomorrow! HA HA, everything is coming together! and i think i'm doing a great job with mr. antonioni cuz' it seems like jennifer likes it a lot! and the fox and cat scene cracks me up everytime!!!  I think i'm sick of wendy's now cuz' it tasted weird when i was eating it or maybe it was just me...or not. after rehearsal we had to pick my mom from work and i slept on the way there and now my right eye is kind of blurry cuz' i slept on it and my right hand slept too!!!  HA HA, this is the boring part, who actually reads this?! do people do this?! who and where r they?!...............anyways, BYE!  ME  p.s. SCHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!

      No, seirously, how far is heaven?! Well, i was jw cuz' me and maddy always have conversations about heaven and hell and stuff like that, ha ha. GRRR, becca didn't get in  Cathy's Creek  but oh well, it just made the play worse for not picking her. I asked diana if i could get a haircut and she said maybe just a trim or a 1/2 inch and this friday my family and i r going up north for my mom's bday which is this saturday (YAY!!) so i had to ask diana if i could miss this friday's rehearsal and she said that i should have told her in the parent meeting cuz' she had to know conflicts by that time but my dad just told me today and we just planned it!! so i was kind of embarassed but now were not going on friday so were just going to leave on saturday so YAYA!  Today was back to school night! I got to see my old friends but to some of them i acted like i forgot about them so it would be "kool". Well, i kind of did that, i still said hi and stuff but i didn't talk much and plus my parents were with me so ya. and i got to know my classes and i have the same locker, YAYA! some of my friends already bought their stuff for school so they put it in their locker. I didn't buy them yet but we r tomorrow (or so my mom says). Mr. Doyle is still my homeroom teacher.......i gave my teachers the signing thing cuz' i'm missing school cuz' of pinnochio and there's a new teacher! i forgot her name, but she seems kool. I couldn't find Mrs. Lennox or Mrs. Lee so i guess i'll let them sign it on the first day of school.  HA HA, u know how my dad bought my bro a motor control water vehicle thing, well, he bought me one too!! It's so kool, mine's way faster than his, what a loser. and one of our neghbors from across the lake came over and said that they had one too so tomorrow were going to do it again. YAYA!! BYE!

      Well, today i was kind of embarassed. U know how we had homework yesterday, well, when i shared my pictures jennifer put me on the spot and i was litterally sweating but not a lot but i was....and i'm not mad at her or anything but i just hate it when directors do tat.....GRR! This play is going by way to fast! It's already the third week and we did scene 6 which means we just have to do one more scene and were done blocking the play! Weird....and this friday we're off book and i still have to memorize a few lines and the blocking, GRR!  HA HA, cody told me that he knew eRiC nORtOn cuz' he was in the magic mrs. piggle wiggle with him at ctc. He said that he was OK, ha ha, he was a loser! no offense, if ur reading this eRiC, no wait....OFFENSE! I don't think caitlin likes me, ha ha, i just keep saying that my friend almost died, idk y but i kept saying it in scm and now i guess i keep doing it....GRR!!! I should keep my mouth shut. The only ppl that i've actually grown to be friends with so far is angela, steph, and gattlin and of course krista but we were friends a long time ago, HA HA. OOO!!! Idk if becca got callbacks for  Cathy's Creek  cuz' i didn't get to talk with her today and it was at 6:30 and rehearsal ended at 6 so ya....I HOPE U DID!!!  GRR! My parents and i had to go to this one store after rehearsal to get my bro a present...jeez, just get the bitch a leesh! Well, we got him this one motor control water vehicle thing, and it's actually pretty kool! Cuz' we tried it in the pond today and it was awesome! There were waves! but now the batteries r recharging so ya....tomorrow is back to school night, YAY, i'm not excited or anything but i just want to know my classes and see everyone again and have the first day of school then after that, i can say BYE!

We did scene 5, and reviewed 3, 4 and up to 5 and at the end of the rehearsal it was auditions for  Cathy's Creek  so ppl were out in the halls and since diana was still with us the ppl had to wait for the audition sheets...i think. and there was this one girl who was at the corner at the end of the hall and she looked like she was crying and praying.......i felt sad for her........if she's auditioning then i hope she gets in. OOOOO, and becca auditioned for it, but i didn't see her cuz' it was probably l8er and she said she was doing some scm songs. HA HA, GOOOOOOOOOOD LUCK BECCA!!!!!!!!!

I know i'll get in......not to be selfish but i'm just being "confident" and i told richard that i was going to audition for it and he said i could make it and he usually produces the plays so ya....YAY!!!! Becca told me that julie told her that Alex Ortega might direct it!!!! the key word is MIGHT but it would be so kool if he did.....that's all i have to say, i'm sooooo bored, BYE BYE!  ME  p.s.

Philip is my younger older brother. He's a fat ass immature homo bitch who annoys me all the time! I swear he's like my younger brother! Well, today we went to a picnic but it wasn't bcuz' of his birthday, HA HA. My cousins were there too and we went swimming. The food was soooo good! and we went biking and ralph and jason got lost and we had to go back and we couldn't find them then we finally went back to the picnic and they were there!!! Those stoopid heads....  GRR!! I got a rash on my face cuz' i didn't take a shower after swimming so my mom had to buy medicine and i took it and now i'm healed....  We saw A vs. P today too. It was an OK movie. The graphics were awesome!!! Everything looked so kool, but my other brother didn't come cuz' he was "sleeping" (he was to scared). Well, i won't spoil the movie for u folks who haven't seen it but i can tell u that it's suspenceful from beginning to end, well, maybe not the beginning but u should see it to know.....HA HA, BYE!

      Today rodessa and roberto came over to video tape the lil audition scene for the movie. HA HA, we probably have like a zero percent chance of getting in but what the hell, u never know. I bet rubert grint thought the same thing when he did it so ya. When rodessa and roberto got here we wrote our letters. i guess mine was pretty good considering it was kind of sad too. I said that ppl have said that i sucked at acting which isn't true but i had to make it so they would feel sad for me and besides it's not like there going to read it. Then rodessa typed the script and we ate.  As for the audition tape..........HA HA, LMAO!!! It was suppose to be 2-3 minutes long and we thought that would be easy but we kept laughing and laughing our asses off!!! The first time we started shooting rodessa started laughing and we were almost done with the scene!!! So we kept on re-shooting it and re-shooting it and every single time roberto, rodessa, and i kept laughing so hard. Until it was about 1 hour later since we first shooted, and we finally got it done. I'll have to say, it was quite goooood and it was fun........or not.  HA HA, rodessa and roberto think i live in a "too perfect neighborhood" like the stepford wives. They said that the grass was to green, it was to clean, and the pond was to blue. Roberto noticed that everyone had something in their backyard, ha ha. Well, that's all, the rest of the day was boring so BYE!  ME  p.s. YAY!!! I beat solitare, it's 103 seconds now, BEAT TAT FATTY!!!

      Well, my "family" (except my sister) and i just got back from minigolfing. It wasn't that bad considering i got 3rd place out of 5. I could have been second but it would have been cheating!!! cuz' my dad added my score wrong for the first half, he put 31, and i added it together and i got 27 and he added it again and it was 34 and i added it again too and it was 34 so ya.....GRR!!! But i got 65 from the whole thing which isn't really that bad so ya.....the weird thing was that there was a line behind us, cuz people were waiting for us to be done. It's not our fault u have to wait u dumb asses!!! There was a whole family in front of us too, and 2 of them were lil 7 year olds or close to that age!!! ya.........behind us were like old ppl, the ones who look like they golf...a lot, but idk y they went minigolfing. They should have just golfed in a bigger place.  After that we went to mcdonalds. McDonalds make my stomach feel bad now so i don't think i'll eat there anymore, it makes me feel like i'm in an american FAT food restaurant....so ya. Then we went to blockbuster and borrowed starsky and hutch.....i'll watch it l8er but for now, BYE!  ME

Today's rehearsal was blah blah blah and we did blah blah blah. No.....not really......we played that bat and mangoose thing again, ha ha, that was fun...yup. We did scene 1, 2, 3, and 4!!! It was so kool doing all of them! We did like one paragraph of scene 5 but jinnefer didn't wanna cuz' she wanted to do some touches with the other scenes. At the end we got to see our masks, well, the ones who actually have masks. It was soooooooo kool!!! The storage room is just like ctc's so it felt weird....my mask looks a lot bigger than the ones we used. I mean, it looks like it but it's a lot bigger....ya......dot dot dot.......and i got white stuff in my hair and on my chin cuz' of the paint!  Well, shaun e-mailed me today and said that he was leaving for college tonight....it was sad....and theo got back from camp.....ha ha, BYE!  ME

Today's rehearsal was fun i guess....we played this really kool game...ha ha, we were like it's a mangoose and it's a bat and a what and yada yada yada. We did scene 4 too.

      Wow...today's rehearsal was kool i guess. We met emily, the girl who'll play the blue fairy. I think she's the same age as steph....idk. She was at camp or something so that's y she wasn't here. and we did some touch ups on scene 1 and 2 and we did scene 3 today! So miles was there too and we saw how his nose would grow!! It's so kool....ha ha, we asked him questions and stuff and his nose would grow...ha ha. but dana wasn't here today, i asked y and krista said it was bcuz' of this french play or something. WOO HOO!!! i got my t-shirt order form in, considering it was due today. GRR!! did u know that we get homework?!?! we have this one worksheet thing and it's due this friday....i'll do it l8er...  GRR!!! i'm really sry rodessa for not getting books 5, 6, and 7 at the library. i couldn't get a ride, GRR.....i really need to get them soon...but i'll get them and read them by this friday, so ya.

      WOO HOO! just wanted to do that...Today's rehearsal was fun i guess. We worked out scene 2, which is Mr. Antonioni so i got that down and i've pretty much memorized it now. OOOO!!!! I can't wait till opening night!!! This is going to be a great play...i think....ya  HA HA! After rehearsal, everyone who was at rehearsal today (well, all the kids, so all the "zanies") went to watch  Raising Helen  at the movie theater across stages. Isn't weird how we just began the second week of rehearsal but everyboday is getting along already...which is pretty kool. The movie started at 7:05 and rehearsal ended at 6 so we went to eat at the restaurant by the theater too...i forgot what it was called...hmmmm.....Steph asked for ppl's screen names too, i usually ask for ppl's s/n at closing but today was fine too, and Cody had to leave at 7:30 during the movie which was to bad for him. As for the movie, it was ok...it was a chick flick and it did bore me sometimes cuz' the plot was too simple but it was funny in some places. HA HA!!! There were a lot of funny parts!!! GRR!!! I owe Krista 50 cents and gattlin $4.05!  Well, now i'm home, 10:20 p.m....HA HA, BYE!  ME

      WOW! It was a lot better than i thought it would be! My teacher was really great and was funny and nice...HA HA! She is big, but at least she can walk unlike my old piano teacher! HA HA, i didn't even tell u her name, well it's Bobbie Fisher. Yes, her name is Bobbie. First, we did some warm ups and stuff and then we did stuff off the book. It was kind of fun cuz' i did good i guess. She wanted to know my range and so i had to sing from my lowest to highest and she was suprised to see how GOOD i was...HA HA, no, seriously, she thought i was really good, HA HA. See, Y THE HELL DID I NEED VOICE LESSONS?! It just takes money out of my parent's walets (it's $20 for each lesson)...but i did learn some new "tricks" so ya....It was suppose to be 30 minutes long but it turned out to be about 45. HA HA! All i have to say is that it was great and it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be....BYE!  ME

      Well, b4 i tell u the reason y i put that title, i'll just give u a lil happy moment, cuz' i beat solitare in 138 seconds! BEAT THAT FOO! Today i had a few mixed feelings...well, not really but i'm just not a really good person at making titles, like GUS, ha ha.  Today's rehearsal was the best so far! It was a lot of fun! and i've grown relationships with everyone...friendly relationships...HA HA. We worked scene 1 (p.1-10). It was really fun cuz' there r all sort of crazy stuff that we do in only those pages, and tomorrow we're going to work scene 2 (p.10-16) and that's the part with Mr. Antonioni. So i have a lot of lines there, but those r most of my lines and i've memorized them all so all i have to do now is memorize my other lines throughout the play which should be a sintch since the mr. antonioni lines r done. O, and dana asked everyone if we wanted to watch a movie at the movie theatre right across the street (isn't weird how a play theatre is right beside a movie theatre...) and she said we would watch Raising Helen...and i was going to say that i wouldn't waste 6.50 to watch that!! but she said that tomorrow is 1 dollar tuesday, which means it's only one dollar! so i guess i might watch it...ya  Right now i'm waiting for my vioce lesson teacher to come cuz' it's 6:50 pm right now and the lesson is at 7:00...seriously, WHY THE HELL DO I NEED VOICE LESSONS?!...i mean i know that my voice isn't the best singing voice thing but it's good enough!!....o well, i'm just a lil nervous cuz' i really don't want to do this....for now on, on mondays, i'll have 2 blogs, one for rehearsal and the other one for the voice lesson....wow, i am such a dork, HA HA....well, i'll tell u all about it l8er.....BRB  ME

      HA HA! Today was so kool and stoopid. First, my family and i went to church and when it was time for communion (usually we go to the 11:00 mass but today we went to the 9:30 mass so i could audition for the christmas carol at guthrie) i ate the bread and i saw little wine glasses on the counter in a lil bowl thing (they only give wine at 9:30 mass so i wasn't use to having wine)and so i thought we were suppose to take it so i did and when i tried to drink it, there was nothing in it and then i saw this woman drink the wine and put the glass in the bowl and so i put my lips on a cup that someone already drank through!!! it was embarassing cuz' everyone in the church saw me...HA HA  Then we went to go to the audition at guthrie. THIS WAS FUN!!! When we got there (it said in the newspaper to enter the stage door) we didn't know where the stage door was so we went inside the theatre and we asked this one woman on the counter and when my mom asked where the stage door was she laughed and told us where it was and she was british!! I say, it was quite rude laughing at our quesiton (cooper asked her too and so did a lot of other ppl)...ha ha. Anyways, we got there and i signed in and i saw joshua carpenter signed in too and he's from oz and i hadn't seen him since closing. HA HA!!! This was so kool!!! I went inside the room and i saw josh, tyler, ryan, and eRiC nOrTOn!! It was so kool but i was looking for cooper and there i spotted him at the back of the room waving at me...HA HA. I talked to everyone from oz cuz' it's been a while. Isn't weird, how yesterday i met alexis (which was the first oz person i saw since closing) then today i meet 4 other ppl from oz. At first tho, i didn't recodnize ryan then when we actually went to the audition he said that he was from oz at ctc and i was like OOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEEEEEEAH!  Yep, it was really fun. I auditioned with josh and ryan and cooper in the same group. Everyone did so good! We sang some "we wish u a merry christmas" and told a story. O, AND GUS, I TOLD THE STORY OF U DRINKING THE LOTION....HA HA, IT WORKED TOO CUZ' THEY LAUGHED!!!! Cooper did really good!!! He went right b4 me and he kept on saying that he was really nervous but i knew he would do good and when he did i was like "I TOLD U" and everyone heard it....and he said the same thing about me!!! but i know he was just kidding....I diffenetly know that ryan will get in and cooper will probably get in, but as for me.....i did my best and if that's not good enough then BOO HOO.........IF I DON'T GET IN U MOTHERF***ERS I'M GONNA KICK UR ASSES!!!..........JK!!! Cooper said that i did really good at singing, but who believe's cooper...O, after our audition it was the girls turn and i saw andrea there!! I wish the best of luck for her.......SHUT UP THEO  After that me and my folks went to a picnic thing which was soooooooo boring but i could handle it then after that we went to a party for this one lil baby that i don't even know and they ate...AGAIN and i wanted to go home so bad....i was really krabby. I was sweating too cuz' they didn't have any air conditioning, all they had was 2 fans. I was whinning so bad!! Almost as bad as Joey and this is the part of the day that was STOOPID!!! I really hope i get into the christmas carol at guthrie....HA HA, BYE!  ME

      OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, me and krista just got back from watching peter rabbit at stages. It was OK, i mean it wasn't really good or bad so i guess it was good. I got to see ppl that i haven't seen since forever like alexis! I hadn't seen her since closing of OZ!!! hmmm.........did she get smaller or did i grow taller.....i grew taller. It was really fun!!! HA HA!!! Avery was in it too!! and b4 the play started they went around the audience and spoke to us and stuff and they had to act like there characters which were little tiny mice and when avery spotted me and krista she totally got out of character and was like OMGAH.....HA HA, it was funny. I can't wait till opening of pinocchio!!! but i know closing would be the next day....if u know what i mean...whaaaaaaaa i still miss scm!!  After peter rabbit i got to go to my lil cousin's 3rd birthday!!! It's weird to think she was born a month b4 9 11....ya, if u haven't noticed, i'm a big "i could have prevented 9 11" person. Her party was fun, kind of. She did throw the hover disk over the neighbor's roof and we had to go there and get it back but it was fun. HA HA, we played hide and go seek down stairs in the basement. It was fun, cuz' one of my cousins was scared of the dark so ya.......BYE  ME  p.s. Hey Gus, jzmin told me that alyssa didn't get ur e-mail, about u asking her out, so if ur reading this u better e-mail her at the right address this time.

       I read that in a fortune cookie, the title thing....ya. So today at rehearsal wait...no, we didn't have rehearsal today cuz' to many ppl had conflicts, stupid ppl....JK! I tried to "rest" today but i stayed being bored. U see, without my plays and stuff it would be like blah blah blah and yada yada yada and la la la la la.....yup.  I woke up today at 11:30 and my brother was still sleeping, seriously he waits for me to leave the room until he wakes up (we have a bunk bed and i sleep on the top) Like when i wake up at 8:30 or something he wakes up at 9 and if i wake up at 11:30 he wakes up at 12....he's such a loser. My other brother is a loser too but he has his own room and when my sis leaves for her second year at college i can get her room....again!  There r ducks in the pond in the backyard! This is the first time. It's really kool, not really but to be a good person i'll just say that.  Today, my dad told me he enrolled me to have voice lessons.....WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! WHO SAID I NEEDED VOICE LESSONS?!?!?! Well, it's going to be on Monday at 7 after rehearsal so i'll tell u all about it on Monday. O, and she's teaching me piano and the sax.....AHHH!!  HA HA!!! Me and krista played a lot of games on yahoo and it was really fun but i was still bored and stuff but tomorrow we're going to see peter rabbit at stages at 1:00! I can't wait cuz' 2 of my friends r in that play and one of them was from OZ so i really want to see it. We were going to see it at 7 but i have to go somewhere else and my dad doesn't like to drive! and Jazmin was going to go with us....idk if she still thinks she's going so if ur jazmin c and ur reading this, we're going to watch it at 1 instead so ya!  On sunday is the audition for the christmas carol and i'm auditioning with cooper and idk if my dad wants to drive me anymore cuz' today it seemed like he didn't. Cooper says he won't audition for it if i don't. HA HA!!! Cooper's kool. I'll go now, BYE!  ME

       Yes, this will be the last blog that i will number......."Meant To Live" by Switchfoot is playing right now on musicmatch!.....HA HA......today's rehearsal was kind of boring too considering that we didn't really do anything but "character work" ya! but we got to use our masks again so it was sorta fun!!!  I was the first one there!!! Which is pretty weird cuz' i'm usually 1 minute late cuz' of traffic but today me and my sis left early cuz' we had to go to the library and drop some books off and we went straight to the theatre. I got there at 3:12 which is exactly 18 minutes early and when i got to the dance studio (we had rehearsal there today) no one was there, not even diana so i was kind of bored so i went to the bathroom. When i went out no one was still there!!! So i got a drink and i past this other room right beside it and diana was there!!! So i wasn't bored anymore and she had a rope cuz' at the beginning of the play we tuggle war so ya....and then we played tuggle war and she won!!! GRR!!! Then krista got there and then gattlin and we played tuggle war and i beat both of them!!! MUAHAHAHA!!!! wow........i am such a dork.....HA HA!!!! Then we watched a movie about this one woman who made masks and stuff like that and it was really kool and she directed the lion king on broadway and she was the first woman to get a tony award thing for directors so ya.......then the rest of the time we did stuff with our masks.......i told ya today was boring.....  My dad and i went to wendys after rehearsal and i got 2 double stacks and one water.....HA HA.......it was yummy!!! and now i'm here, writing this..........HA HA!!!Theo keeps beeting me in pool, and that's only bcuz' i keep letting him win....ya, and Gus, Theo is YEEEEEEEAH.....HA HA!    My friend Corey is going to graduate this year and he's going to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts!!! and his name is Corey Nystrrom so when u see him on tv, u'll know i know him!!!       Naomi's family is LOST!!! HA HA!!!! JK!! They've not been home since 6 according to Naomi and she doesn't know where they r!!! HA HA!!!JK!!! wait..........she just told me they got home...GRR!!!   la la la la la...........      I just read Jazmin's whole blog thing!!! WOW....she really did like shaun...a lot...HA HA....

       I'll stop numbering my blogs after my third one so ya....u know, usually after rehearsal or something i get in my car and i sleep in the back but i didn't do that this time cuz' i already slept through rehearsal!!!!!!! It was so boring. For the first 45 minutes we "relaxed" a.k.a. sleep!!! We were trying to make our voices be louder and better and stuff and i was doing it right, cuz' the person was like GOOD JOB!!!! and i was like.....i know lady. I didn't really say that outloud but i did in my mind. Then, for the next 45 minutes after that we "plumbmuled" each other or something like that, which is just like waking up each other and stuff and make our voices louder too...then for the rest of the hour we had our masks!!!!  They were really kool and fun and stuff and we did some fun stuff with them too...kind of so ya....and my sister was late picking me up!!! and diana (stage manager) acted like she didn't care but i could tell she did cuz' my sis was suppose to pick me up at the front door but she didn't and yesterday diana told me to tell her and i did but i guess my sis forgot!!! and so she had to tell my sis her self so ya.....  Yesterady, Tori told me she wanted to be a psychiatrist and i think she should go for it!!! She's kind of good at doing that stuff.....well, i should tell u y.....ok, i'll tell.....ha ha, i'm such a dork....well, as u know sunday was closing of scm, and i was really sad and i told her that but i didn't tell her that i was sad cuz' of closing and she wanted to help me but i told her no cuz' all my other friends from school said "Patrick, it's just a play" and i don't miss the play at all but i miss the cast!!! Then finally i told her and she helped me throught the depression and it made me feel better so Tori could become a psychiatrist if she really wants to.....and remember Fantasia Barrino  ME, Patrick Faunillan
