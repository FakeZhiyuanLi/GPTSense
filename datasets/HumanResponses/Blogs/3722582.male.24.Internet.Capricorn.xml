      This site will soon be transferring over to my new domain at  urlLink PocketKangaroos.com .&nbsp; The site name originates from the poker hand of being dealt two kings right at the start.&nbsp;

      What a crummy stretch the Cubs are on of late.&nbsp; I haven't seen a team with this much talent on offense do so poorly in forever.&nbsp; It is getting to the point of embarassment when the Brewers staff is overpowering your team.&nbsp; It seems our offense completely relies on solo homeruns.&nbsp;&nbsp; At a game back in the wildcard and 8 games back in the division, it doesn't look good. &nbsp; On a brighter note, I'll be buying a new set of  urlLink poker chips .&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a great online store that Local Launch (the company I work for) is currently doing SEO and PPC management&nbsp;work for.&nbsp; Not only are their prices real good, the quality of their products look top notch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully they will be here for next Sunday's poker game on Lincoln Ave.&nbsp;

      For the most part I despise ESPN of late.  Guys like Stuart Scott have destroyed the one pure thing I enjoyed on TV at night.  However, I fully applaud them for overplaying poker events on their network.  They have advertised the World Series of Poker tournament as if it was the second coming of christ.  This in fact has led to the large influx of new people playing poker and a country that is jumping on the bandwagon of Texas Hold'em.    Why would this be a good thing?  Because I play a lot of poker online.  The "new" players that join who saw a couple hands on ESPN and now think they can win some cash are simply giving me money.  If focused, and sober, I can win nearly $100/night playing on Party Poker if I want.    For that, I thank ESPN.  I thank everyone involved in bringing crappy Poker players to my online table.  A little piece of everything I buy now belongs to you.

      and here's why.  The game should mean nothing at all.  Instead, Bud Selig decides to make the game mean home field advantage in the World Series.  This could be a factor in who is crowned World Series champions.  Now call me crazy, but I don't want to see the likes of Carl Pavano and Dan Kolb determining if the Cubs play at Wrigley in October.    The game should be for the fans and a fun game.  Although the All-Stat game "tie" a couple years ago was bad, it really wasn't anyones fault.  It was a strange situation and the managers didn't want to be held responsible for blowing out any pitchers arms.    This is one of the priorities Major League Baseball needs to address this offseason.  That, interleague play, and the Expos debacle.

      Fuck you for getting my hopes up this season and playing mediocre baseball for the first couple months in the season.  Typically the swoon would have come through in June and filled my summer with worry free days, but you went too far.     As I'm posting this, the Cubs have fallen to 7 games back in the NL Central.  A team with the highest payroll in team history, a load of young pitching talent, and a lineup which was categorized as "explosive" should be doing much better than this.    I turned the game off in the 7th inning so to not break my 17 inch Memorex TV with my fist.  They had scored 1 run and it seemed they were content to stay there.  The team is playing with no heart, no spirit, and no testicles.  They may have well thrown out the Rockford Peaches today.    Clement gets the start tomorrow against Cy Suppan of the Cards.  Matt owes Sammy and the rest of the offense a fierce kick to the balls.  He has gotten no run support from his team this year and must be excited to leave next season.   Well there is always tomorrow...

      It has come to my attention that I currently work with the  urlLink worst lay in Chicago .  Through various sources at Google, as well as Aimee at Overture, this story has been confirmed many times.  In fact, the only positive thing said about this young gentleman came from an unknown lady at Kanoodle.    With that said, we wish Werty the best of luck with his new title.  It is certainly much better than his previous one as having the  urlLink smallest penis in Chicago .

      After a long wait, I've finally opened up the pocket books and bought a couple of electronic toys I've been eyeing for awhile.    The first is a flat screen LCD monitor.   The 17 inch monitor is a considerable upgrade from my old computer monitor.  Next up is a new emachine.  Nothing spectacular but it doesn't run Windows 98 which my previous one did.  Total cost came in under $1000 which is pretty good I'm thinking.  The second was actually a gift.  A 15GB IPOD.   Have I been wanting one of these forever.  Only have 15 songs on it at the moment but it should be up to around 1000 by next month.  All in all a good week for me.
