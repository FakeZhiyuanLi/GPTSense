						    Here follows a detailed account of how two guys, Seth and David, are actually the same person...          16 years ago there where 2 parallel universes. They were seperated by a very small, yet stable gap of time and space where reincarnation would take place. Then something happened. The universes crossed creating a dual reflection of life. Just before this occured however, a man died. His mind was floating around in this gap awaiting reincarnation when, because of the universal cross, it was split into two opposite yet alike reflections. The larger portion of this was reincarnated into myself. The later and smaller portion was stuck for about a 2 month time in the shifting wave lengths of the space-time continueum. It then was mixed with another, underdeveloped mind and reincarnated into David. So, me and david are partly the same person.       This theory was arived at by detailed study of our dreams and experiences. We have a phsycic link that lets us communicate certain things without words. Now as for our dreams, that is quite intriguing. Since there were 2 universes our former person could have lived in either one, but when the universes crossed his life patterns and mental stasis were warped into the cross. In our dreams, we each see portions of our past life and sometimes, we even relive them in this one. So technically, we can see the future. I, having the larger portion, see more, and experience more in this life. But David, having his portion mixed with another has higher mental state, being smarter, and quicker in thought processes. Who knows, maybe one day the universes will uncross and we will each split again. After many many years, we will have populated the entire Earth!!!

						    Well I've discovered a new quality I have today.   I possess an obsessive compulsive desire to chew stuff. Today at school... I almost ate an entire pen top. That's right, a pen top. I really need to start taking glue sticks to school. It would help alot. Maybe I'll go buy a bag later. Anyway, I got threatened of getting suspended today. If I don't get my hair cut in the next day or so, I'm gone. That's real sad. Especially since my hair isn't that long. Stupid goat principal. Oh well, it happens. I was given the idea by donaldo of getting everyone who wants to have longer hair to sit out in front of the school with signs. Maybe I should get all those who want the dress code to be less strict of girls to stay out there to. We could have like... a school-wide riot or something. That would be awesome! To bad it would never happen...

						    Well... today was the first day of school.   Or half day rather. It sucked. School just really gets on my nerves sometimes. Especially when I get in trouble for my hair being to long in the first 5 minutes I'm there. Honestly, what's up with that??? 1) My hair is not to long. 2) Could you at least let me say hey to one person before I get in trouble? 3) I'm not going to cut it anyway, so why waste your breath? On top of all that, I have almost 2 periods of nothing. Yes, nothing. 6th period I'm getting out of Spanish to be a "teacher's aid." And 7th period I'm in a class that I took last year so I won't be doing anything but playing games on the computer. Talk about patheticaly easy... Well I don't really have anything else to say. I'm looking forward to tonight and this weekend. Life is so much easier when you can drive. Peave out... War in

It's just really annoying sometimes, especially when you get in trouble for your hair being to long in the first 5 minutes you're there. 1) My hair is not to long. 2) Can I at least say hey to one person before i get in trouble? 3) I'm not going to cut it anyway, so why waste your breath? People these days, they just don't understand. Well i don't really have anything else to write. I'm looking forward to tonight and this weekend. Life is so much easier when u can drive. Peace out...

						    I went up to the school this morning to get my schedule... not happy. I've got 3 maybe 4 clesses in the same stinkin classroom. What's up with that? Man alive I wish our school wasn't so stinkin small and poor. On top of that, I've got history 2nd period. That totally ruins my day. History is supposed to be right after lunch cause it's the best period for sleeping in. 2nd period you are pretty much woken up and don't need to sleep. Honestly, they have no consideration for our physical needs. Or mentally if you go to my school. Fortunatley we do have study hall after lunch. It's only 30 minutes when I need my hour, but I guess it's enough sleep for me to get by. Well not in the best of moods so i'm gunna go. Later.

Well today has been.... boring. Very boring. I've been sitting here at home unable to go anywhere cause my mom wasn't home and my sister had to take my truck. So yeah, i'm bored.
