       Haloscan's at it again.    I wonder what neurosis they're experimenting with now. I'm back at my old waterhole and I slept the whole afternoon away. Now I got a headache and a thirst which I quenched with Pepsi blue. I also have a fruit-flavored 7-up which tastes more like tepid cough syrup.  And speaking of cough, I have this hard to cough-out-kind-of cough. All the 2-hour-sleep-per-day debts I've been thoughtlessly incurring is finally sending me charge slips with the usurious rates.   Okay, enough on the cough.    Tomorrow, Eric my lovely nephew, is graduating from pre-school. I think I'm going to show my support by taking his pictures.    Okay, enough on nephews too .  I'm bored. I'm not sleepy. I don't want to go and install MIRC and chat mindlessly because it is boring too. Speaking of MIRC, I'm thinking of writing a definitive tract on the perilous road of MIRC and how it will end with boredom. But I'm still collecting materials on it. Or too lazy to begin the introspective mode of thinking needed to actually start it off.   Sigh. This is boring.   I know.

      My date entry is in Dutch (Belgium). I didn't know that the difference between the Dutch and the Belgians extends up to their language. All I know is that the Dutch don't like the Belgians, and that the Belgians couldnt' care less.   Me, I like them both. Haha.

      Of why we suddenly find ourselves here, in this site. It's because there's a glitch in the haloscan.com (thats the commenting server I was using). Everytime I open my or  urlLink reckless writer 's site, I get this dismissive ho-hum-you-can-wait-til-the-sun-explodes-for-all-i-care message in my status watchacallit: 'waiting for haloscan.com'. So one waits. And waits. And waits.   An aside. (Oh that is so cute, 'An aside'. I sound like Gertrude Stein.)  Are we supposed to fucking wait til doomsday? I can't possibly face the Lord J.Christ in my ratty shorts and baggy eyes! If I were to go down to hell, I want to go down in style. Goddamit.   I didn't watch Cold Mountain btw. I watched Runaway Jury on VCD instead. I definitely feel for John Cusack. Seen him in High Fidelity. He definitely shone in there. Yeah. Definitely.

      No commenting button here. If you want to comment, you can write me an email. If that's too much trouble, go to ICQ and find me. I'm under: beautiful, golden-skinned, highly intelligent, sexy Filipina women. Should the ICQ direct you to someone that looks like some movie starlet, that's not me. Get over  that  too.   Ogad. I can't get over the temporary--that is, I hope it's just a temporary glitch--loss of kfv's notes. I miss my little Eras Bold ITC fonts. I miss the sweet cornflowerblue background of my entry title. I miss the ad button of Firefox. I miss the links which i painfully and diligently pasted. I miss my blogsite. Waah.

      This posting site looks and feels different.   Of course this looks and feels different, you little shithead. This is a new blogsite, altogether!  Goddamit.

      I am feeling morose today. I feel hot. My hair is a fucking impossible primadonna. No respect at all. I would have cut it off with really sharp scissors or shave it off if I know it will give me a drop of respect. But it won't, it will just grow back, curly and frizzy and difficult. So it's a totally waste of time cutting it, cussing it, pulling at it, hot oiling it, brushing it, shampooing it with shampoos that promise straight silky hair, hair conditioning it with conditioners that specifically say "frizz-free hair" which is a total lie. Total, absolute, Clinton-saying-I-didnt-fuck-Monica-type of lie.   Bile. I am bile today.

      I am happy today. I've been happy since two weeks ago. It's a strange feeling, to feel happy for two weeks straight now. Happiness is relative and I can see how this happiness is related to me.   I met someone.
