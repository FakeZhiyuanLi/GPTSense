         Soccer is the best thing that I had happen to me. There I'm with my friends and have fun with them, and I forget about my personal problems. To me soccer and my team is my family, my coach is my second dad, my two captains are my moms, and the others are my sisters. I have play soccer since I was in 6 grade, and form that day I promise my self that I will still play, and try my best to play better. My number of my jersey is 10, and my nickname is Slip because I slid a lot. I play forward and midfield, and I don't like to play defense, that spot it's not for me.

         The biggest killer of high school students is boredom. Boredom leads to drug use, violence, gang involvement, and teen pregnancy. How do you handle boredom? How do your friends handle it? I handle boredom by knowing which person are best to hang out with, and those person knows too. My boyfriend, best friends, and of course my soccer team. My friends handle boredom in the same way.

          The best thing that had happened to me was when I went to Disney Land, California, with my family. Having a family trip it the best thing. It was the second time that I got out of Texas, the only place I go is Mexico. It was a good family trip, I had a lot of fun with my family. Disney Land was a wonderful place, I met Minnie mouse, Mickey, Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Tarzan, and etc...       Another place that I went was to Universal Studios, It was cool, there I met King Kong, Spider man, and the mummy. It was like if you were inside the movie. There we went around to see how they do the movies, and the places where they did the movies that we now have seen.

       Everyday, she comes from the school, Vara Center, and looks for her boyfriend. She does her homework or study, and most of the time she talks to her boyfriend and tells him about what she has done or another personals things. Then the bell ring and she goes inside the school, Eastwood Academy.           Then she comes outside with her boyfriend to eat together lunch. Then she goes inside the school when the bell rings. When school is over, she comes outside and gets her bag from the truck and then she goes inside. When she comes out she is wearing different cloths. She starts to practice soccer, she really looks like she enjoys soccer and that she is having fun, she always slides and gets cuts in her knee. Then her mom picks her up and she is gone, until tomorrow she will be at school doing kind of the same thing. But she almost done with school, and her vacations are coming for her.

       The coolest member of my family is my mom. When we want to go to the park and play a game, we go all my brothers and go play soccer. My mom, my sister, and me play against my two brothers, "We always win". When we play soccer we laugh, scream, fall, and etc.., we always have fun. Sometimes we go play basketball, or we go to another park to run.   I like to be like her, because she has the energy like us to have a good time or have fun. My mom has accomplish a lot of things, she even got a diploma. Having a mom that you always have fun is great.

       Theoretically I will go to college, and my aspiration will be wanting to have a good life. In the future it may be confusing at first, for the many things there will be or have to do. First of all there will be college, you don't know what to do, but you get hang of it you will know. Them it will be finding a job, knowing were to work, if you like the job, or if they pay good. Another one is finding a house or apartment, and etc...  At that time I will have more experience that I do now, because of the things that I have learn and gone through.   When I have done with college, I may form a family of my own. Thinking first about forming a family is not a good idea, what you need to be thinking first is about college; about what you want to study or work for.

          .  The think that I regret is when I went to camping, in 2003, I wasn't with my best friend instead I was with another friend. When I was near her she always be saying that she misses someone. One day we went to the Rio Grande, she went inside to swim, and I was behind the trees changing my shirt because I had a white shirt. I traded with another friend the shirt When we were changing we heard screaming. We ran, and we saw that my friend was inside and drowning, some old guy got her and I went to him to help him. She didn't react, they took her to a Hospital and I didn't went with her. When all was over and we where back to school I went to her house to see her. When I went to her house I saw her different like she was a different person. She saw me and started crying, I was trying to not to cry in front of her. Her mom told me to go, so I went to her room because my mom left. I was thinking maybe this will have never happened if I was with her all the time at camp.   urlLink Friends

           I have someone close that I love, I don't want to loose him. I don't like to be thinking about what is going to happen to us in the future, the only thing that I like to be thinking is the present on the moments we are having together. Sometimes people that have boyfriend or girlfriend, when they are arguing or have a problem the only thing they are thinking is "are we going to break up or what is going to happen" this is the main thing that you should not be thinking.           Some people when they are thinking about it they break up. When I get mad or have problem, I just tell him that I want him to be with me and to hug me, or to live me a moment alone to think. When this happen to me I just try to forget, and go have fun by playing soccer. Having a boyfriend is someone that is there for you, loves you, cares about you, understand you, and most of all someone that you trust.

       Hi,            My name is Thalia and I'm sixteen years old, I attend Eastwood Academy a great and beautiful school. I have one brother and three sisters, I'm the oldest. To me being the oldest is hard, because I have to give them a good example and have responsibility. I don't have cousin that is about my age, sometimes I wish I could have a cousin. But the one thing that I love and enjoy is playing soccer, I play forward and mid field. Each player of my team has a nickname, my is slip because I slide a lot. My friend Neila gave me the nickname when I was playing soccer an I slid.    Soccer is something that I like to do, so I could forget my problems or get my mined into something I enjoy doing. My favorite color is red, and I don't have one favorite animal I have 4 favorite animal are the dolphins, baby's bear, baby's elephants, baby's monkeys. My favorite pet is the dog.
