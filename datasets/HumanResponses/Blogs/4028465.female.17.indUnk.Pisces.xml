         Well this weekend wasnt that bad...I got to hang out with Matt and me and him havn't hung out in awhile so that was cool...He likes Jen (but i'm not sure whats going on with her and Kyle and I dont really think Matts sure whats going on with him and Kristen) Matt got me hooked on Dashboard Confessional and Slipknot I cant stop listening to their songs lol DAMN YOU MATT!!!! But anyways, Josh is coming home this weekend I dont know how I feel about that honestly...I have my days where&nbsp;I just really want to see him and then there are those days when well I dunno&nbsp;but theres those days too if you get my drift?&nbsp;I finally got a job it's at Wendy's but the way I look at it...Its a job and its money so I cant complain. I think it would be cool if Matt and Jen got together cuz they both deserve someone who is going to treat them the way they deserve and they both deserve it (WOW! that was sappy) But I am going to get going because Shawn and Kayla are here and we are going to sit outside for a few. Buh bye

      Hum...I cant figure out for the life of me how to fucking setup this fucking shit....Like when I write a post it nevers stays on here it stays on for that day you get me good cuz if you do I want you to IM me on Maggieluwho or Bellepinkie18 or just email me at  urlLink Maggieluwho@aol.com  cuz I NEED SOME HELP!!! But newayz Josh is coming home this weekend Yulpity yulp! I dunno I want to see him but I'm not sure if that's going to happen...the last time we saw each other was the 4th of July weekend and we got in a big as fight (but ever since then everytime we talk we never fight and its kewl cuz I dont have to call him he calls me now and it makes me feels special) No, we aren't getting back together that would just be to fucked up and I just am having fun right now with being single and I mean its not like I want to be alone because there are times when I want someone to be there when I wake up like he used to be but I dunno I get by and for the most part of everything I am really happy and thats the greatest feeling because its taken 2 long years for me to feel this way!!! Oh as for my mother finding the scales she went on about how "I'm not anyones Patzy and blah blah blah...For some reason when my mom yells at me I think of songs and I start singing them in my head like when I was like 15 I used to just yell back at her to try and prove I was right but I guess now I just dont care who is right or wrong because I would rather not fight with her because its just us too here...Man oh man it feels like forever since I have talked to Heather I miss her I think the last time I talked to her was like last weekend when "that dick who says he's our father" called and bitched about how awful of daughters we are but oh well he's the one who never comes around or calls so I guess all I need is my mom because she is like my dad and my mom in one! ITS RITIOUS!!! Beth called and woke me up this morning and she hasnt for a couple of days so I missed that but I forgot how early she calls UGGHHHH!!!! Me matt and Danielle went to Wal-Mart last night Matt keep hitting Danielle with everything and then he sprayed me with Car Air&nbsp;Freshener ASS no Matt's cool I LUB him lol...But yeah him and Danielle smelled like a couple of whores and when we went to see him while he was doing laundry Danielle said he smelled and that was like the second time in one week someone has said that to him lol.....Oh man this is getting boring so I am going to let you sorry ass ppl who are reading this go.........Uhh Buh Bye Now!!!

        I told Amanda I was going to post this in my blog today because one having a sister who is bi-sexual this offends me in lotz of ways and 2 I just think what she has to say is just plain funny and very true because you shouldn't judge anyone on anything especialy when you know nothing about them as a human being....::SMILES FOR AMANDA:: GO AMANDA! lol      Anti-Homophobia rant.       Talking about a kid in my english class.Yep, that's me. A breathing opposition to your existence, you pigheaded ignorant bastard. How dare you talk down to me as if your hetero status makes me less human. I assume the word "dyke" takes away all good traits I may have. I'm just a stupid, talentless, moronic dyke, right? That's all I am to people like you. People who lack the ability to accept or at least tolerate. However, since I am nothing none of this matters, right? I have no soul or emotions because I'm less than human. I'm not an all holy breeder like yourself. You say you'd rid the world of faggots if you could, kill them all. Because we're a plauge on the human race. We are immoral criminals. Wait, we're just like everyone else.Our sexual orientation is not us, only a part. If you see that as a big enough reason to kill me or hate me, I feel for you. YOU are the immoral one and I am the gun to your head.I'm not going to list your many flaws in an attempt to appear better than you because it isn't that personal. You spew your hate speeck and threats at an entire group of people. I'm not mad because you called me a dyke or because you called me perverted, I'm mad because you think it's right and you won't question it, ever. You represent so many people and none of you know that we're just people. All hate based on sexuality, race, creed, sex, size, age, gender is WRONG!        &nbsp;  Oh wow I luved that I was reading through her live journal and I just thought that what she had to say was so true....Anyways back to me lol...Josh called last night he makes me mad sometimes I swear he jsut doesnt understand I told him I have changed and I most certainly have...Its just when I try to tell him that things have changed around here and shit he doesnt listen and for soem reason every time he talks to me he asks me if I know if his ex girlfriend and her new b/f are still together well duh yea lol oh well he didnt know...But the thing that makes me the madest is that he thinks there is nothing wrong with him oh bullshit I'm sorry but everyone has one the at the least that is wrong no one is really perfect cept for like priests and shit lol....Oh well he isnt a bad guy he's jus not a PERFECT guy!!!!! I didnt get to see Matt yesterday....hum oh well he's a good guy (MATT IF YOUR READING THIS THEN I AM LYING LOL J/P) I cant wait until I get my car I hate having ppl drive me around when I have a perfectly good license for myself....I get to go get new jeans and a new belt tonight Matt stole like my only good one and honestly it wasn't even that good....I think we are going to get me new shoes too which is kewl cuz I dont like to wear sandals all the time...I talked to Kyle last night he was being alright for once cept I dunno we just arent the same anymore we lost our friendship that we used to have and yea that sucks...I WANT SOME VODKA god thats all thats goin on in my head is just about how am I going to get me some god damn Vodka!!! I dont know why I want to drink I quit smoking um yeah I quit smoking cept for cigarettes thats a long road and nope sure not ready&nbsp; to go down it either...Hum well I am out of things to say aND to go on and on about so I am gunna go BUH BYE NOW you fucking dicks!!!
