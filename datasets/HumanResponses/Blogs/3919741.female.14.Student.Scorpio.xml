      AWWWWWW there chasing me!!!!   Okay I had this realy realy weird dream. It started out I was just walking to the snow cone  shack right behind my house. and all these crows just strated to swirm around me,(and if you know me, you know how much i hate crows) so i started runnig as I could then I ended up running in to the the ocean. And what ocean is in the middle of south county- st.louis mo. but anyways then there were ton and tons of sharks just swimming around me ( you know me you knkow i realy hate sharks too)So i started swimming as fast as i could away from them and then all of a sudden I saw a boat so i starrted yelling for help and the people running the boat were kelly,ashley h, caseyh, kim. ther all my realy close friends from sown by my moms. then they picked me up out of the water. and i was like omg hey you guys. But they all acted like they didn't know me. so they droped me off at the snow cone shack. and then the crows started flying around me again and i ened up on very small island that could like only fit one person on it and sharks were swirming around me. then i heard a evil laugh. mwhahaha laugh. so i stared looking around and Hannah, this girl i use to be best friends with but got in a fight at the end of the school year with, was on a magic flying carpet. and she was the one that was mwhahahaing. then i woke up.  I'm the kind of person that thinks everything happens for a reason and theres always a meaning for somthing. so I thought this was a sihgn.  you know.  so i asked my friend tony what he thought it might mean and he said scince i just moved out of my moms and into my dads at the end of the school year. my friends might be mad at me and hannahs just trying to just steal all my friends to get back at me.       but i dont know      weird huh?

       Hey! Hey everyone! Alison , my sister is  annoying. I cant stand her she acts like shes 7 but realy shes 19. she didn't feel like going to school today so she stayed home. And all day she kept pointing at me and going "I'm not touching you...I'm not touching you." you know like they do one that commercial. And then latly shes been whineing about how she wants to talk to Demarco, her ex-b/f,  so bad but shes to scared to pick up the phone and call that fucker. and then she'll go " trishy you should call him for me" but i won't because I know if I do she'll get mad at me.  School is starting soon, and each day I get more and more scared about it. I mean because I'm going to be going to a big high school were I know no one. and im just going to be just a small freshman. :( well thats it for now talk to you all later
