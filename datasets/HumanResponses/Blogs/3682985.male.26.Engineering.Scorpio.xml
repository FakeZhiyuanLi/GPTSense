       urlLink    Here's their mom. You can tell the yellow and the grey colour are on different strands of the "fur" gene ... The kittens had another brother who's grey in colour but disappeared ... They grew up under our shoe-rack. Maybe next time I can record the noises they made and post it here ...&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Took a day off work today! Basically spent most of the day doing house cleaning on me PC. Transferring big chunks of files to CDs. Videos burned onto CDs in NTSC format appear to be inproportionately wiiiiddddeeeee ... Tested files burned in NTSC and PAL format on the new DVD player ... looks fine on the screen except that the "ultra-low" resolution looks pretty ugly on a 29" TV. Which means a blackhead on your left chin may expand into a 2mm mole on your face and you lose a few teeth when you smile .... Me dad dragged me to take some photos of a waterfall somewhere near Island Park, behind some of the houses by the hillside cos he's seen quite a magnificent sight yesterday when it rained heavily. He was disappointed when it lost some volumes but it's still quite beautiful .... There's a sort of a temple where believers pray to the Natuk Gong ... First time I saw a statue of a Natuk Gong ... dressed in Baba-nyonya cloths and wears a songkok .... Was looking out for a name though can't find any ... cos Bear said in Kluang, their Natuks have names .... Penang Natuks remain anonymous ... well, if I'm a Natuk, I wouldn't want to have a common name either ... &nbsp; urlLink

      When I casually broke the news to a friend that one of my hamsters died (you can see his pic at my second post), I was quite taken aback when he non-chalantly answered, "Good!". My fleet-of-the-moment horror that his statement was born out of malign intention was subsequently alleviated when he continued, "Now do you still want to rear anymore hamsters?" It wasn't till the evening when I have some time to myself to think about this that it all started to make some sense. This friend of mine grew up in a monster family consisting of five children. In a family of this make-up, certain privileges and creature-comforts are bound to be spread around unevenly and thinly across the siblings where the biggest factors determining the "course of distribution" include the order to which each child is born i.e. the eldest probably gets to study overseas while the youngest is left with little money to spend on an education of such "luxury" in scale. Another thing is that the standard of living enjoyed is most probably considered lower than a small nuclues family with children of an average number of say 2 to 3. So why keep a dog if you can't bath them everyweek while you let them walk around with patchy skins and swollen balls or feed them with the latest black-pepper flavoured "Pedigree Chow-Chow" instead of mushy corns boiled out of chicken-feeds? (Yes, my one and only dog who died more than 8 years ago enjoyed a diet of mushy corns boiled out of chicken-feeds!) Thus, why rear hamsters if you can't give them a good life and let them die? Thus why have so many children if you can't let them all enjoy a comfortable standard of living?   I used to be angry with my parents for not letting me have a choice in my career path simply because they are paying for my education fees. Since now that I'm not on a career path that I can pursue passionately ... now that my standard of living is far from my ideals ... should I blame them for making the wrong choice for me? Should my friend take his parents accountable for his lack of opportunity to study overseas merely because they were bred in a herd (maybe, he might not actually think this way)? Now that I'm a bit wiser than I was, I do think that my parents have made a choice which they think is best for me though it might not turn out to be exactly that way. We would probably have done the same under the same circumstances and discretion of our parents'. Perhaps what we enjoy now, to them, is already a commendably high standard of living. However affluent we may be, as children and as our ownselves, it may not be enough. They've made their decisions to the best of their intentions. All we have to do is to continue from where they left off.

       urlLink at ease | radiohead extra @ ateaseweb.com   Yesteday I put up 3 printouts to cover the peeping glass in my cube. To keep the peeping-toms at bay when I surf the web during office hours. Partly because my boss came round and sternly reprimanded me for allowing other people to write "indecent", "un-corporate-mannerly" graffiti on the glass. The last recorded wordings was a Chinese pronounciation translation of "asshole". I decided to cover the glass for good. When I had Thom Yorke's poster up in the middle, flanked by an artwork for OK Computer and the album cover of Kid A, these are some scenarios caused by the recent display:   Bear :			He looks ... like he doesn't have a strong, attractive personality ...  Radioheadist (me) :   	Of course. He's the symbol of the ultimate anti-popstar, the anti-celebrity. (That's exactly the point. It's about the music, dude! Not that I've completely shunned Britney Spears though ... hehe)  Bear :			Is he rich?  Radioheadist :		Of course, damn fucking rich! ...   Samurai Neo :		What's this? (With his characteristically child-like grin)  Radioheadist :		If you look at it closely ... you'll see ... Demi Moore! (Come on, he wouldn't know who Thom Yorke is, even with my explaining 'cos he's comfortably snugged in the music from his nostalgic college years ... which is nothing wrong, of course)  No, I might not find another one who shares my love for Radiohead's music ... at least not within a 8km radius from me. But they are the closest thing pop-musicians could ever be a cult for me (The Beatles and Bob Dylan comes close).  I spent the last Saturday reading Ed O'brien's diary chronicling the difficult recording process of  urlLink Kid A . It excites me when I read about musicians. I get a brief insight to their creative process. What is more exciting than having the opportunity to read, on paper, the seemingly ungraspable process of creation? What kind of elation do you feel when you hear a musical idea slowly wriggling in your head while you slept with it and ignored it for 2 months and it then suddenly comes back to you as a more complete piece of music brewed in all other kinds of music that you love? I've hugely enjoyed reading these brilliant works of music literature during my college years: Benjamin Britten's biography, Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' records and the Sixties and Stravinsky's biography etc. And I come off learning more about musicians' creative process and they enlightened me and always challenge my ever-evolving perception of what music is. When I heard Radiohead's Kid A, my understanding of music opens up into a totally endless horizon of what constitutes music and what music could be. And I'm certain there're a legion of Radiohead fans out there who share a deep sense of devotion to music created by these odd bunch of Oxford hippies/musical intellectual. Because just like Mozart is music, though on a different scale altogether, Radiohead is music!     Coming off of the fascinationg pages of these diary entries, one can see the kind of music and musicians that influenced their works which then comes off sounding completely fresh and cutting-edge:  1.	Neil Young (They named a working title Neil Young *9, not unusual to name a song after its most obvious resemblance if you're a musician!) 2.	PJ Harvey 3.	Don Henley 4.	De la Soul 5.	Missy Elliot (Who would've thought? Influences as far-flung as missy??) 6.	Bill Wyman 7.	The Smiths 8.	Jonny Scott Walker 9.	David Bowie 10.	Inkspots 11.	Mark Hollis 12.	U2 13.	Asian Dub Foundation  I love reading this entry about the use of strings on How to Disappear Completely:  "phil is presently putting down drums on 'how to disappear' - we're doing a demo of the song to present the song to an 'orchestral fella'. we've kind of shirked away from strings in the past as they seem to have been recorded in the same manner for the last 30 years (ever since the beatles). jonny is particularly keen to use an orchestra but not in the standard cliched way ....... more like the end of 'climbing up the walls'. thom's vocal on it was jaw-dropping. it's very strange to be playing that song again as we played it frequently on the ok computer tour .......................... suddenly you're back there."  No wonder my favourite tracks on Kid A and OK Computer is How to Disappear Completely and Climbing Up the Walls respectively. The strings morphed around in time and space like free-running, unsettling spirits from the underworld. If on hearing the first sounds on How to Disappear Completely, you felt helplessly hypnotised and obsessed .... man, you're already there .... welcome radioheadist .... you'll never ever want to come down again .... man ... you wanna get high??  At once tuneful at the core, heartfelt and disturbing, appealing to the experimental and intellectual sides of music-lovers, there's currently no musical entity more exhilarating and commanding than Radiohead ...

       urlLink pop (all love)   Apart from having only a single track which has something to do with Fiona Apple i.e. her brilliant and heartfelt cover of "Leaving On the Jet Plane" for past summer blockbuster Amageddon, I practically hold no clue whatsoever to who she is nor what she does best ... not until all these mp3 blogs started to be become my daily obsession since the past one week ... not until I came across a barrage of postings circling the huge excitement generated by the news of her next album being dropped by Epic/Sony and how her staunchiest fans (apparently she commands a cultish league of fans) got their hands on leaked songs from that yet unreleased album spreading around the internet circle. These postings coupled with the fact that her previous album "When the Pawn ..." was reviewed on the mostly indie/IDM championing  urlLink Pitchfork Media , I'd not have expected her to be doing music which is essentially "jazz" after downloading and listening to the leaked tracks "Better Version of Me" and "Extraordinary Machine". Her voice is silky smooth in the high range (a bit Billie Holiday). Whoo ... and I love her diction on "machine", as if she forgot to put her tongue down to close in on the " ...ne"... Dancing on a reindeer sledge down Las Vegas in July??

       urlLink music (for robots)   Totally gripped by the mp3 blogs phenomenon. This is the first mp3 blog that I've come across that catches my attention.  RIPPED RIGHT OUTTA THERE  showcases a David McCallum composition, The Edge from which Dr Dre's  Next Episode  's hip hop hook is taken. Absolutely amazing insight into the innovative use of samples from totally obscure tracks and it's transformation into one hip-hop's most catchy hook is amazing. I wouldn't even know how to categorize this track into it's proper genre but I have no doubt that this will fit nicely into Tarantino's Kill Bill soundtrack. Haven't figured out how to post a link to an mp3. Hopefully you will get to listen to it on time because I couldn't find any archive link here. Strange ...

       urlLink Noam Chomsky , famed linguistic professor and political activist, on why the U.S. is the greatest threat to peace on earth. The article is a bit dated but it reflects my own sentiment that George W. Bush must never be re-elected this coming November.  "The logic of that is straight-forward. If you announce to people I'm going to come and attack you, at will without any pretext, they don't say thank you. Here's' my neck, cut it. What they do is respond in some fashion. No one can respond to the United States in military force. The U.S. spends about as much by now as the rest of world combined, and it is far more technologically advanced, so people turn to the weapons available to them, and the weak do have weapons available to them. Two, in fact, terror and weapons of mass destruction, which are now not that hard to construct."

      Got meself  Kylie Minogue - Body Language  'cos I simply found the "boa-eey boa-eey" on the chorus of Red Blooded Woman a brilliant chip of pop cheese and also ... wanted to get some disco grooves into me pelvis joints. Alas ... on first spin, the album was full of disappointing fillers ... let's hope a few more spins would correct me. Nevertheless, it made me realize that Justin Timberlake is as much Motown and hip-hop as he is ... disco. So is Beyonce. But why is Justified and Dangerously in Love more inducing to a pelvis-workout than Body Language? Can it be the reason that BL is more a "white" album than Justified (Timbaland/Neptunes) or DIL? Think Beyonce and Christina Aguilera doing vocal acrobatics and you'll find Beyonce totally breathtaking while Christina sounds like your mom's constant nagging and had her voice drowned out the music, burst and splattered all over the place like a mess. Why do black musicians still possess such superior genius and skill for rhythms? Ah ... I still love hip-hop more ...  For some dance/disco funk, I recommend Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx.

      Was lying on bed, way before bedtime, and let me thoughts wander around unhindered for more than an hour. In case you're wondering where I was getting at ... I haven't reached there yet! Funny how I have this tendency to weave a web of thoughts out of a few trickles of them. Which explains why I'm probably better at plonking out an essay given a few words or writing a symphony out of a few notes than to make out how much I'd gain if I bought 1000 units of a particular share at 10 bucks sold at 20 bucks! Focus and disciplined thinking is just not me kinda game. If you asked me a simple question which requires a straight-forward answer, by the time I gave you an answer, my brain would have generated another 10 questions and 10 answers ... which is where my "delay" came from.  Next time, just don't ask me a simple question with a quick answer okay? ^_^  So ... where was I?  O Yeah ... as I was brushing me teeth, a baby cockroach lost its way in the sink. When I'm done, he'd have been choking in me white-foamed spit and get sucked into the drainhole. I once quote a poem, on a whiteboard:   "Self-Pity"  I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself.    D.H.Lawrence    A friend asked me how I know that the small bird doesn't feel sorry for itself. I never quite knew how to answer him then and I couldn't remember what me answer was but on seeing the cockroach dragging its hind legs helplessly trying to climb up the wall of the wet, slippery sink ... I saw an enormous will to live. Would I have wanted to live this badly if I knew what a pitiful state I'm in? If I were him, I'd probably have jumped into a toaster when the heating element is on full blast. D.H.Lawrence was right afterall, the pity is in our eyes. Even when we see a scene like this, the pity is on the human condition reflected through the lives of these little creatures. They never know what self-pity means.  I didn't flush it down the hole. Live and let live ...  namo amitaba  ....
