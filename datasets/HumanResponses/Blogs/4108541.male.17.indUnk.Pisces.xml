       Well... I'm showing you all this link so that you can see what I do during the majority of my weekends.   urlLink     Thank you  urlLink Summerwind .  It was a fun, but annoying weekend.  Roberta Flak is a giant bitch.  Its not worth even getting into, but she should just fall over and rot.  I'm sure Count Basie should be a lot more kick ass than her.  But time will tell.  Basically, I've got my driving test this weekend and I'm scared crapless.  I'll probably fail and that's got me wicked uber worried.   wicked uber worried

        Well...  I figure I'm cheating the world now if I don't give them my side of things on every little piece of crap I can think of.  So:        WELCOME TO THE DIGITALWORKBOX!       Otherwise, I got nothing else to think of. Its been a crazy busy week, and most likely will only get a lot busier. For those of you who do not know, I currently hold two "steady" jobs. One of these is at the Elections Department in Vernon and the other is a lighting designer/sound technician/technical bitch at Advanced Audio Visual Systems.  To say the least, the two jobs are as different as a dog and a cat.  (Excuse the crappy analogy... its like 2 AM damnit.)  I'll go into why they suck later, but right now know this: We have a democratic primary on Tuesday, August 10th, next week, and I have to finish development of a barcoding/voter id system and implement it in three of the various polling places. This entails me programming some type of database system, changing the official voter information, and getting a laptop that was ment to play PONG workable to transport this information. Status on this: 40% done.  I have one day left.  Prayers accepted please.  In terms of this weekend, its gonna be fun, but intense most likely.  I get to  design lights for Roberta Flack , the broken down woman from the 70's ("Killing Me Softly"). Andrew and I will visually rape the stage for that one and if I have to deal with another pot head at load-out I must just blow up.  So... who needs to rant? I'm not really complaining as much as I am deciding what I think and putting it on paper so I remember.  And last but not least, my chruch's Summer Retreat is this weekend and because of all this work, I can't go. WHICH BLOWS! I really need that weekend, but bah... no luck. Next week should be fun with all the stuff I have going on.  Right now the two things brining me home will be:  Band Camp and my trip to the US Open.  Thank you, please come again.
