        Despite  urlLink Jeb Bush fighting  tooth and nail to keep flawed touch-screen voting machines in Florida, the GOP has a different warning for its public.  urlLink The GOP&nbsp;has distributed flyers which "urged some Miami voters to use absentee ballots because touch screens lack a paper trail and cannot "verify your vote."  So these flawed machines are good enough for Democrats but not to be used by Republicans? I can't imagine the GOP working any harder for a 2000 repeat

        urlLink  According to the New York Times   , "Almost all the electronic records from the first widespread use of touch-screen voting in Miami-Dade County have been lost, stoking concerns that the machines are unreliable as the presidential election draws near. The records disappeared after two computer system crashes last year, county elections officials said, leaving no audit trail for the 2002 gubernatorial primary."   Touch screen machines cannot be allowed in this presidential election. Besides the fact that the president of the company producing them has said he is "committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year", the machines are already malfunctioning in Florida.&nbsp; Our Democracy can't handle another appointed President, we need an elected one.  urlLink Fight touch-screen voting here .

      Bloomberg News reports "Halliburton Co., the biggest U.S. contractor in Iraq, has lost $18.6 million of government property that country, about a third of the items it was given to manage, including trucks, computers and office furniture." Despite persistent problems with overcharging, mismanagement and fraud, Halliburton – the company run by Dick Cheney before he became vice president – has raked in $3.2 billion in highly-coveted government contracts.

        From what I've read of and about the 9/11 Commission Report, it's a little disappointing. It leaves some very major questions unanswered.&nbsp; Who was funding these jihadists in America? How is it that they got into jet simulators to begin with, when you need a twin engine certification first? Were they reporting back to anyone in the mid-east, and who?     urlLink Read it here for yourself . It's important to understand what happened the day of the attacks, but what about the months and years prior?

True, the fault lies partially with Clinton and partially with Bush. But Clinton isn't running for reelection, and Bush is. We can't allow 4 more years of mistakes.    Additionally, the final report is way more critical of Iran than Iraq: "The report also concludes that al Qaeda's relationship with Iran and its client, the Hezbollah militant group, was far deeper and more long-standing than its links with Iraq, which never established operational ties with the terrorist group, said officials familiar with the document."

        Bush is our President, right? Well, not if you're pro-choice, a feminist, or if you disagree with him at all. An entire family was ejected from public stands minutes before Bush's motorcade rolled by. Why? For wearing t-shirts. "Barbara Miller, a 50-year-old chemist for Dow Chemical Co.,  urlLink had carried in a rolled-up T-shirt emblazoned with a pro-choice slogan.  Her daughter, Theresa, 19, was wearing a hot pink T-shirt that read in white lettering, "This is what feminists look like." The 19-year old feminist asks "I'm not an American? I can't see my president?"     Outrageous.

        Yet, despite that promise The Congressional Budget Office has found " urlLink Fully one-third of President Bush's tax cuts in the last three years have gone to people with the top 1 percent of income, who have earned an average of $1.2 million annually. "    OK, but that's one third of his cuts. the majority could still go to people at the bottom. "According to the new report from the Congressional Budget Office, about two-thirds of the benefits from the tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, went to households in the top fifth of earnings, with an average income of $203,740."    Once again,  urlLink Bush lied .

        Though CIA Directors are typically non-partisan and apolitical, Porter Goss is anything but. On June 23, 2004, Goss attacked presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) on the House floor. Goss held up a blowup of a chart about 1997 reductions in the intelligence budget and blamed "such distinguished Members of the Congress as Senator John Kerry... urlLink I got books full of that stuff . There is no doubt where the record is. The Democratic party did not support the intelligence community." Keep in mind, both houses were controlled by Republican in 1997.    After John Kerry delivered a major national security address in early June, Goss was tapped by the Bush/Cheney campaign to provide their official rebuttal. Goss wrote in a statement released on Bush's campaign website that " urlLink John Kerry's speech today amounted to little more than political 'me-tooism. ' He laid out some old goals that everyone agrees to, without offering concrete proposals to achieve them. He also neglected the President's historic achievements in this area." In " urlLink an effort to revise history and expunge...[Goss'] record of partisan attacks, " the Bush campaign removed Goss' statement from its website yesterday. After it was called on the tactic, it restored the statement several hours later. Bush/Cheney communications director Nicolle Devenish called the decision to remove Goss' statement "a mistake."    As chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Goss refused to investigate the outing of undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame by a senior member of the White House staff. Goss told a newspaper last October that when " urlLink somebody sends me a blue dress and some DNA, I'll have an investigation .'"    Is this the kind of open-minded non-partisan person you want protecting us from future terrorist attacks?

        urlLink A four month investigation by a Philadelphia researcher , independently confirmed by a RAW story, " urlLink finally proves that President George W. Bush did not successfully complete his service with the Texas Air National Guard. The president's own payroll records – recently released by the White House in an effort to discredit claims that the president had failed to meet Guard requirements – instead indicate that he was absent without leave (AWOL) in 1972, and should have been placed on active duty for nearly four months. " American Progress's Larry Korb, former assistant secretary of defense under President Reagan,  urlLink has reached a similar conclusion . Asked if he thought Bush was AWOL, Korb said, "Based on these payroll records, unless he had permission, it would be."

       The Albuquerque Journal reports that New Mexico locals hoping to attend a rally for Vice President Dick Cheney in Rio Rancho were " urlLink asked to sign an endorsement form if they couldn't be verified as Bush-Cheney supporters. " The requirement to pledge allegiance to the Bush-Cheney ticket in order to attend the event was confirmed by a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. The endorsement read: ""I, (full name) ... do herby (sic) endorse George W. Bush for reelection of the United States." It later adds that, "In signing the above endorsement you are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush." A Democratic New Mexican adds "It's not right for me to have to sign an endorsement to hear (Cheney) speak," Wade said. "I'm still pissed. This just ain't right."

        A Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) study exposes the extent to which "Fair and Balanced" is the lie we knew it was. " urlLink FAIR’s current study looked at 25 weeks of Special Report’s [with Brit Hume] one-on-one interview segments (6/30/03–12/19/03), finding 101 guests...Among ideological guests, conservatives accounted for 72 percent, while centrists made up 15 percent and progressives 14 percent. Viewers were roughly five times more likely to see a conservative interviewed on Special Report than a progressive."       OK, so most of us could have guessed that. But FAIR takes it one step further and compares Fox to the so-called "liberal bias" networks. " urlLink FAIR’s original 2001 study of Special Report  included a comparison to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Reports—which favored Republicans 57 to 43 percent. And a 2002 FAIR study of the three major networks’ nightly news broadcasts found an even greater imbalance than on CNN: Of partisan sources, 75 percent were Republican and only 24 percent Democrats. The differences among the networks were negligible; CBS had the most Republicans (76 percent) while ABC had the fewest (73 percent). In FAIR’s 1993 study of NPR, when Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, Republicans still outnumbered Democrats 57 to 42 percent. "

        The Bush administration seems to think that the "War   on Terror" is best served by outing al Qaeda moles. You may remember the terror alerts that overshadowed the DNC. They were based on information obtained by Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan. We arrested him, leaked his name, and then found out Pakistan " urlLink had been using him in a sting operation to track down al Qaeda operatives around the world...The Pakistani interior minister, Faisal Hayat, as well as the British home secretary, David Blunkett, have expressed displeasure in fairly severe terms that Khan's name was released, because they were trying to track down other contacts of his."  This caused the British to go after any lead they had gathered, even though they lacked many specifics that more surveillance of Khan could have given them  urlLink "The British do not, however, appear to have finished gathering enough evidence to prosecute the 13 [suspected al Qaeda members] in the courts successfully."  "Then on Friday, after Khan's name was revealed, government sources told CNN that counterterrorism officials had seen a drop in intercepted communications among suspected terrorists"     Additionally, the FBI led a sting operation on a mosque in Albany on the word that someone was trying to buy a shoulder-fired missile. Of course, the man buying the missile " urlLink was working undercover for the US government as part of a surveillance operation going back a year. " The undercover operative picked Pakistan's UN envoy as his fake target.  urlLink "It is mind-boggling why they could not use the name of an American functionary," says Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman. "This technique and methodology is tantamount to auto-suggestion and could have endangered the life of our ambassador," he said.

       One of the stars of the upcoming book, ''Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry," has retracted his statements. Kerry's former commanding officer " urlLink Lieutenant Commander George Elliott said in an interview that he had made a ''terrible mistake" in signing an affidavit that suggests Kerry did not deserve the Silver Star. " He also appears in the current misleading "Swift Boat Veterans For Truth" ad attacking Kerry for his Vietnam service. Count him, John McCain and 10 of the 11 men who served with Kerry on his boats (the 11th is dead) as supporters. That says alot.

        You know that the economy only gained 32,000 jobs last month, far short of the 125,000 needed to keep pace with population growth. But did you know...    ...job gains were revised lower for the preceding two months, to 78,000 for June and 208,000 in May, or 61,000 less than originally stated by the Labor Department?     ...although unemployment for whites dropped from 5 percent to 4.8, but among blacks, the unemployment rate rose to 10.9 percent from 10.1 percent in June, and for Hispanics, increased to 6.8 percent from 6.7 percent?     ...we are now 7 million jobs below the forecast made by Bush's Council of Economic Advisers in February, 2002 (after 9/11)?

       New citizens received a shocking lesson about the right to vote last month. After a naturalization ceremony in Jacksonville, FL, "an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged the them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies." Here's the twist: " urlLink Those handing out forms were Republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the GOP.

       I'm sure by now you've heard  urlLink the obscene ad  by so-called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth which spreads lies about John Kerry's Vietnam service.  urlLink Here's why it's a load of crap , including that none of these people were on Kerry's boat and none of them even witnessed the events in question.  urlLink Here is John McCain denouncing the ad  and calling it "dishonest and dishonorable".  urlLink And here's an article detailing how this ad , though technically by an independent organization, has the GOP and Bush supporters fingerprints all over it. Heck, even the Wall Street Journal shows it to be false, saying  urlLink "Indeed, 10 of the 11 men who served on his two swift boats all have sworn by John Kerry; nine living members were in Boston [for the Democratic National Convention]."  Why is this ad outrageous? Let's pretend Kerry isn't a war hero, that he won no purple hearts or silver stars. What did he do? He served his country. He risked his life. And he did so voluntarily. He came from a well connected political family and could have easily opted out of serving. But he enlisted, fought bravely and served his country. That is much more than can be said for most people, and one president in particular. Does Bush really want to get into a comparison of where these two men were during the war and what they were doing? We know one was captain of a swift boat, and the other couldn't be bothered to even show up for his physical. No one can argue that, and those facts alone will tell you all you need to know about how different these two men really are.

        Probably not:    Under President Clinton, poverty fell by 25.2 percent since 1992. According to the most recent data from the Census Bureau, under President Bush poverty has risen by 7.1 percent. For the first time in 13 years, the poverty rate grew  urlLink   two years in a row   , jumping nearly a percentage point from 2000 to 2002 (from 11.3 percent to 12.1 percent). The number of poor grew to 34.6 million people in 2002, including   urlLink  12.1 million children   .  There are more people unable to find work than four years ago. The current unemployment rate is 5.6 percent. Four years ago, the national unemployment average was   urlLink  4.0 percent.    Clinton created 22.7 million jobs. Under President Bush,   urlLink  1.1 million jobs    have disappeared.  Wage growth has fallen dramatically over the past four years. In 2000, median weekly wages grew by 4.9 percent. This fell to a mere 2.0 percent in 2003. Adjusted for inflation that means "  urlLink  that wages fell slightly in real terms in 2003 for the first time since 1996.   " For those who have found work, the recovery is of questionable value in an "  urlLink  upside down   " economy where profits have soared yet families' benefits are nullified by the rapidly rising costs of housing, education, and medical care – all of which jumped at double digit rates.    For the fiscal year 2000, the U.S. government had a surplus of $23 billion, which brought the total   urlLink  budget surplus to $176 billion   . This past January, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the government will be   urlLink  $477 billion in the red this yea   r.
