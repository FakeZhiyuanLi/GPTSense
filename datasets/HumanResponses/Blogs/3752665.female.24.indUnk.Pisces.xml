      I HATE MONDAYS AND EVERYTHING THEY STAND FOR.  The person who created them should suffer a fate worse then death.  Everyone is grouchy on monday, EVERYONE.  Every patient I see, every person on the phone, every doctor I work with.  The Monday blahs are horribly contagious.  So, how does one fix this.  One comes home and has a nice stiff Jack and Coke, then blogs, then plays some online blackjack....ahhhh alllll better.   I forgot to blog on Sunday, not that anyone knew but me.  I was so busy doing nothing that I forgot to do anything.  Carl and I just laid around the house all day, watching movies and eating. It was grand, but I think it made this Monday even harder to swallow then usual.  But oh well, its all done now, on to Tuesday, which I hope can only be better.

      I love the weekend.  I love waking up when I'm ready, not when my disturbing alarm clock starts to scream.  I love waking up a little, peeking out of one eye, realzing my fiancee isn't up yet, and hurrying to fall back asleep.  It's wonderful.  We were supposed to go to a beer festival of some sorts today, but I think we have scratched our plans.  We have decided, we want to do nothing.  So, now I have time to blog.  I think I'll rant about babies.  Those charming little, nice smelling creatures that everyone around me seems to be producing.  My sister had a premature baby boy last Monday, he weighed a whole 3.5 pounds... Sister and nephew are both doing great!  Then a close friend of ours had another baby boy on Friday, a little bigger this time, almost 7 pounds.  So, what's the point?!?!  All this makes me want a baby!  But only for about ten seconds.  Then I remember that I go to work every day (as a nurse, at a pediatricians office) and get my fill of screaming, crying, puking, pooping creatures.  Thats when I realize I'm okay with waiting a year or two, before having my own puke machine.  I do need to get this wedding business out of the way first.  I'm getting married this September, and planning this wedding...well that's a whole another entry....

      Well hrmmm...what does one do with a blog?  I admit I only started this blog because my uber geek fiancee said I should, but now that I have one, I might as well say something useful with it.  I assume I could talk about my life, but in general its not really "reading material."  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want it any other way.  I enjoy leading a typical, not exciting, basically boring, average American life.  I get up every morning around sevenish, fight rush hour into work, spend 8 hours working, wishing it were 5, then at 5, I fight rush hour back home, cook dinner, relax, then go to bed.  Then every single morning the process starts over again.  But the joys of life are all wrapped up in those boring daily tasks.  Waking up next to the person you love...simple, boring, but one of the best things in the world.  Spending your lunch hour with your work friends (assuming you like the people you work with), watching people pick their nose in rush hour, etc..etc..etc...The little things make a boring life totally liveable, and exciting in ones own head...  Well I guess that is enough endless nothing for now.  I think I figured out this blog thing.  Its basically a way for all of us to pretend we are writers, pour out our guts, and care less what others think.  Good deal for sure.
