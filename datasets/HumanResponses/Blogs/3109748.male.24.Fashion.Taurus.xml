      There is an interesting  urlLink conspiracy theory here  that I read about  urlLink here .  It suggests that Bill Waterson, author of Calvin and Hobbes, is now writing a strip called  urlLink Frazz .  After a little reading around the net, don't think I believe it, but Frazz is worth checking out.   urlLink Here  is an interesting article about Bill Waterson from 2003.

       urlLink Here  you can send a guy your idea for a song, and he will write and record it (if he likes the idea).  You can be as specific ("I want a song about the infinite number of monkeys using infinite typewriters. You need to reference at least 5 shakespeare plays and use the word honorificabilitudinitatibus. Make it over 250bpm and in Bb minor.") or as general ("Could you write me one? Entitled... The Zesty Redhead?") as you like.  I was a little skeptical at first, but he's really pretty awesome.

      In a bid for worst job ever,  urlLink here  is a man whose entire workday is spent in a chicken suit, taking commands from internet users.  Go ahead, wait until he's not doing something and then give him a command (you just type in the box below the video).  I tried "spin around" (which he did), then when I said "thank you" he took a bow.  Later I let him "have a seat."  I have not tested the limits of his obedience... yet.

      I'm about to check out Fading Dawn - looking forward to it.  So I was just watchin Comedy Central and I saw an ad for Girls Gone Wild, which had the "alluring" statement that you can now see college girls - doing things they *never* taught you in school. That cracks me up. Apparently, when I watch the girls flashing the camera, I will be reminded that I didn't learn about this "flashing" with the "breasts" in any of my classes at A&M. I'm quite disgusted by this, since I did complete Introduction to Nippology, and did quite well in Drunken Girls Pretending To Like Me 101. I guess I'd better order the video, or sue A&M, or both.  On a separate note, Germans love David Hasselhoff.  And I'm in my underwear. Good night.  Big Johnny

      ...having waited well into week 2 of what is quickly become a Song  Month .  Something with a great beat and a 12-layer guitar solo, maybe?  No, this is a one-take recording of a very mellow and serious song I wrote today called  urlLink Fading Dawn  (title given to me by Johnathan).  Maybe tomorrow will be the day for the 12-layer guitar solo, but don't hold your breath :-)  Oh yeah, I'm a little unintelligible, so  urlLink lyrics are here .

      ...since I lost all my belongings at poker tonight. Alas, at least I still have Internet access. You gotta have priorities.  I'm WAY behind on song week, or so I thought, until I heard that "Song Week" was actually renamed "Song Ambiguous-Period-of-Time-That's-Not-Necessarily-Limited-To-A-Week". So apparently I'm still okay.  Derek - I love Parts Underlined - the guitar part and effects fit your voice really well!  Off to dreamland... Johan

      I was a full day behind today, since I didn't have time to finish yesterday's song before passing out on the bed. However, a new day has emerged, and I have caught up with two *ahem* interesting tunes. The first,  urlLink NBGTA , was titled by Derek, and is not so much a "song" but rather a totally improvised guitar part while reading some scribbled notes about JJ, the NB (you'll see). Listen for what I say at the very end - I think you'll agree!  The second song,  urlLink Catch Me If You Can  (also titled by Derek), was the first attempt at recording my piano...and the verdict is...I need a good sound card and a preamp/mixer to control the magnitude of the signal it puts out. So I apologize for the crazy hum - also, I had to record the voice on top of that, and it was hard to hear over the humming. It was a fun experiment and I love the song - maybe you can hear it live someday, or maybe just after I get a new setup over here!  I'm off to listen to some brand new, hot-off-the-press music about dingleberries!  Noofer than Whassuuuuup, Johnny

      This is longer than Monday's song, yet somehow has  fewer  references to ninjas, thus defying Yulenhoager's Law of Song-Length-to-Ninja-Reference-Ratios.  Eat that, Yulenhoager!  Today's song is called  urlLink Kaleidoscope , a song title Johnathan gave me and told me to use this week.  Actually, I guess we haven't explained that we each made up 3 song titles for each other to use sometime during this Song Week, so you'll be seeing those...(or not, if you decide we suck and never come back to this site.)  N.B.G.T.A.,  Derek

      Well, I'm already behind - but I promise, I DID in fact write this song,  urlLink Outward, In ,  yesterday...I just didn't record it since I fell asleep. For punishment, I did this in one take - and the result is less than perfect, especially with so many missed notes! I do really like the words though! I think it's a keeper.   So My first song is VERY different from Derek's first...but then again, that song isn't really like anything on the planet. I know he keeps denying it, but I think we all know that Derek HAS TO BE on the pipe.  For tonight, I am writing a song that Derek titled for me, although he doesn't know the content yet - not by a long shot - prepare yourself for "N.B.G.T.A.", available probably in the wee hours of the night.  Fo' Shizzle, Johnny

      Hello dear readers, all three of you, and how are you today? I'm fine, thank you.  After an inexcusably long hiatus (not "Hi Anus", Derek...jeez) from monkeybarcongressman.net (a.k.a. MBC), I have decided to get back into the swing of things and do...things.  Nothing more than that for now - Derek and I have a great project lined up for this week - see above for details.  Peace, love, and nips, Johnny
