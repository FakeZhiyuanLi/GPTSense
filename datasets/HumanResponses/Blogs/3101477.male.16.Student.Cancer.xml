      They are out there Shouting for me to let them in They are stomping on my roof They are tapping their nails on my window They are running around in my yard Searching for a way inside They scream for me to let them in But I won'tI know they are here to get me They howl in anger at my insolence I had let them in before They beat on my rooftop They tap their nails on my window They pound on my door, demanding in Their lights shine in my window, in flashes as they search for a way in But I stand defiantI tell them "No, go away!" Then... all is quite As quickly as they had come, they are gone They have moved on to the next house down the street However I know they will be back But for now... Peace I&nbsp;then drift asleep to the steady pitter-patter&nbsp; of the storm that has passed...&nbsp; &nbsp; this is a poem I wrote while I was by myself in the middle of a thunderstorm with high winds and lots of rain.&nbsp; It was suppose to mean that there was something outside in the storm trying to&nbsp;get in, but&nbsp;I have realized it&nbsp;can be interpretted many ways.&nbsp; The day after I wrote this someone broke into our house.

      Hey guys, I went and saw the Terminal today.  That is an Awesome movie that everyone should go see... much better than that rip off Spider man II.  I was the only kid in the theatre though, there were a bunch of senior citizens watching the movie with me.  I think they saw the title "The Terminal" and thought of something else....

      Hey this is Ben and I just wanted to make a top ten list of the sexiest politicians Sexiest Politicians: #1. Bill Clinton #2. Al Sharpton #3. Howard Dean #4. Wes Clarke #5. Donald Rumsfeld #6. Colin Powell #7. Condaleeza Rice #8. President Bush Sr. #9. Arnold Swartzenaggar #10. Gary Coleman (thanks for trying little guy)  Other than that I have nothing to post on really... OH wait! you could check out my profile because I just jazzed it up (hyperlinks and everything baby!) so look at it... its good.  Guud!  Oh yeah the music awards were on the other night.  Outkast was great.  They got up there and said "I'd like to thank my family, God, and the Waffle House." and I was like "DUDE!".  It was funny.  And then Rick James got up there and when he walked up stage he didn't see a camera guy following him and he walked up to this random lady and said "I'm Rick James Bitch!" and walked away.  It was hilarious!  Anyway thats all I got.  TTFN  Ta Ta for Now Benton English

      Howdy, this is Ben signing in once again.  I'm just getting over a cold now and I'm feeling pretty good but other than that life has really changed.  I just moved in from Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its been quite a bit of a move.  I remember the 23 hour car drive in a Jeep to get here.  It rocked.  Hah, my mom was falling asleep at the wheel and she had a really bad headache during the last leg of it and she was smacking the steering wheel chanting "wake up... wake... up..." and constantly putting ice on her forehead.  Then we ran out of that so she put coke water on her face instead and she was all sticky by the time we got there.  It was really funny.  Then we stayed at the nightmare suites over by the mall (holiday inn).  We were there for a week and it was really bad.  The bathtubes were bright red, the walls and ceilings were spiky and the maid left us used tissues in our bedsheets... tasty.  But things IMMEDIATLY improved once we moved into our house... NOT!  The people that lived in that house only vacuumed once, the night before we moved in.  The place was DISGUISTING!  THERE WAS CAT POOPOO ALL OVER!  On the sidewalk, it coated the back porch, and there was even on large piece of Kah Kah in the center of the living room floor.  Also there were yellow stains on the walls and carpets (someone or somepeople obviously had night time problems).  We did the best we could but we didn't trust the carpets so we bought water floaties to sleep on until the furniture arrived.  The also had a pool so we could use the floaties later.  OH YEAH, the pool.  Okay that was just as nasty as the house.  It looked like the pool off of the movie "Big Fish" and there where little black things all over the walls.  We found out later that was fungus that had to be scrubbed off.  We had the carpets cleaned 2 days later and some guys came in and replaced the carpets that were beyond help (all the bedrooms).  Then we painted the walls and stuck putty in the little tiny drill holes in the walls (there were even fist size indentations...).  When the furniture arrived, yeah we fixed the house up in 4 days, we upacked furriously for a week and now we're settled in.  There are still some problems, like the fleas that live in the carpet that we had to get sprayed and everyonce in a while you'll be watching TV in the dark and you'll see a little shape dart across your floor but other than that its HOME SWEET HOME!  And the neighbors here are pretty nice.  Across the street is the black family (thats their last name btw) and they have kids my age.  There is a boy who is 20 and owns a Jeep Wrangler :^) and his brother is 15, just like me.  Heh there is even a senior girl there named Katie.  Its my perfect family.  Also Tony and his family live next door.  I'd tell you their last name but I can't spell it, there from Pakistan, and his sons Humza, Hurru, and Oonaz are all younger than me but we play basketball so it is cool.  Oh yeah, and the Mcfatters live next door to us, their running for govenor!  Hah, they just sound like... like a Mcdonalds value meal... But anyway, the neighborhood seems good and the house turned out better than expected.  Nice and big and the pool came together really well.  I just can't wait for school to start, I'm gonna be a junior at Mosley this year ya know, and as soon as that starts up I'll meet some people for sure.  But anyway thats all I got for now, I'm running out of steam, and I'll just wrap it up.  If you are in the Lynn Haven area contact me somehow and we'll hook up.  This is Ben English signing out... and that is how the cookie crumbles...
