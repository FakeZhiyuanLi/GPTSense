        Damn it's finally friday. I tell you what this day came so slow. I been waiting on you since Monday. This weekend I don't have any plans, just gonna hang out with Jaleigh/Kristy and probably rent some movies or something. In the office today it's pretty crazy. We have some new tenant's that have moved in and ever since they have came aboard it seems like it is so busy around here. Today is Friday and I can't wait til I get off so I can relaxe for a couple of days and don't have to get up for work. I need to sleep in very bad. This morning iI missed the bus because I was just laying around playin with Jaleigh and figured I would make it. I walked outside and BAM I missed the bus he was driving off as I walked out the door..Does anyone remember the song I missed the bus by Kris Kross?? Damn that was a flashback.....Today is Friday and im out................................Today my lil Jaleigh is 6 months.

        Today in the office no one is in except a couple of us. That makes me not wanna be here and its looks as if its gonna rain and rainy days make me sleepy. I should be somwhere sleep right now. Well last night I watched Terminator 3 for about the 2nd time , thats a pretty good movie for all yall that haven't seen it. Today is just a normal boring day, I sure wish I could go to oklahoma and holla at some of my Dawgs. I wonder how all my people in okla is doing? I hope the ones that are on the grind aren't in jail and haven't got caught up because norman police are some sneaky sucka's. I applied to get back into liberty univ which is the school I attended in 97 -01. I wish I would of finished then.. I would not have to be going back now to finish, atleast I can take some online classes and keep all my credits instead of transferring and losing half of them . I should only have about a year and half left then I dont know what im gonna do, I mean I do but dont know where im gonna work at. Should I go back to okla or move somewher else other than staying in DC?? Decisions Decistions......Life is so complicated....

        Today is Tuesday and its pretty busy around the office     . The day goes so much smoother when I have things to do. Time flies when your having fun. j/k I have been going through alot of drama and I have had a special friend give me some very good advice as of what to do and how to do things. Im very grateful for her and grateful she could give me some very could advice considering she has been there done baby momma and baby daddy thing before .THANKS ... Going through relationship problems are very stressful for me and im sure its stressful for others. Why does GOD put people in the situations they go through? Im sure everyone has there own resaons of why they think things happen the way they do. My reason is GOD puts you through trials and tribulations for you to learn, grow and to get stronger in your faith in him. Things you go through happens for reasons. GOD doesn't put people in situations they can't handle. Why do people not think they cant't handle certain situations and just wanna kill themselves and wanna give up on life? If people would believe in GOD and believe what's in the bible I believe there lives would be just fine because God's word doesn't come back VOID and believing in GOD and putting your faith in him can make my life and others alot easier.

        Thank God It's Friday I just cant wait til end of the week each week so i can get my weekend. Although this week went pretty fast since i wasnt here except part of the week. Today is pretty cloudy again since the hurricanes is suppose to be moving its way up the east coast. Being downtown DC I always here police sirens and fire sirens. There is so much crime up here and people driving skills suck. This weekend im going to SuperCenter Walmart to get my grocery shop on. Can you believe there is only one supercenter in this area and its about 45 minutes away?? Groceries here are very expensive I guess because of the sales taxes, so going 45 minutes to fredericksburg gives me a discount on food since Walmart is alot cheaper than all the other food chains. Im sittin here at my desk thinking of what to write and thinking how slow today is gonna be because there isnt much to do I sure hope everyone in florida has taken cover because the Hurricanes is comming today..

        Well i havent written in a few days as you see. The Hurricane is comming through Florida and comming up the east coast. Take cover kesha and lil jordy and rest of her family. Its very rainy outside because of all the tropical storms and they haven't even made its way up through DC yet. I hate the rain all it does is rain rain rain. I feel bad for all the people in Florida today they had to take cover and evacuate there homes because there is 2 tropical storms suppose to hit between today and Saturday. I hope my sisters house doesn't get hit very bad considering her house is right behind the ocean. If you walk in her back yard about 30 feet and walk to the deck at her neighbors house you can see dolphins swimming in the water. That must be very nice living that close to water except when big tropical storms hit. Today was an alright day work was alright i actually had work to do today so the day went very fast. Time flies when your doing stuff. The day is over and boy im glad it is, I mean im ready to go home but at the same time im not rushing to anything other than my lil girl. Jaleigh is so silly i think she might be very close to saying her first work, she is very very busy. She wont be still for nothing except a bottle. Well i started a diet 2 days ago and it has been hell for the last 2 days. Weight Watchers is on a point system and i can only have 30 points a day and that seems like alot but not when a regular hamburger and a small fry is 12. Do you know what that lil bit of food does to me? it teases me makes me wish i had more food o well its gonna make me lose weight then im all for it. Well anyway its almost 6 almost quittin time so I need to go so i can catch a 6:24 PM bus. So its suppose to be there at 6:24 but we will see how late it is because its never on time and now that its raining the traffic is gonna be crucial.

        Have you ever been baptized in Dirty Water? When i thought of the concept of Baptized in Dirty water. I was thinkin of the hood and seeing all the people doing bad things in the hood. Most of the people are good at heart, but you know you have some bad people everywhere you go but for the most part they were put in a situation where they had to survive. So when you look at the word Baptized it means a change a full change but just imagine if you went to get Baptized in Dirty Water it really dont matter what your intent was because if everything around you is negative you gone become a product of that and thats what happen to most of my homie's Baptized in Dirty Water.

         Going back to what i said earlier. I was in Chicago on sun and part of monday. And yes it rained in DC on Monday and made my flight late by 3 hrs, there it goes rainin again... Did you know 67% of every inmate that gets out end up back inside in 3 yrs for either the same crime or a new one. Wouldn't you think they would think twice about going back? Some inmates when they get out thats all they know is whats inside the prisons so some would much rather be locked down then be in the free world...

        This weekend was good. Although it rained most of the weekend. I tell you what all it does is rain here. I went to chicago on Sunday for a buisness trip. Me and pops went and talked to the american correctional association. Chicago is so nice, Did you know chicago has one of the biggest prisons and there is 11,000 inmates in there.. The place where the event was held had lake michigan surronding it and it was very nice. Today i got an email from a friend who needs some serious prayer. She lives in NY and is very scared of all the security and orange alert from all the damn terrorists. Please pray for Sarah Seiss for all yall who know her and if you dont pray for her anyway.   Thats it for now..Holla
