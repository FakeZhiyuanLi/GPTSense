       What a lovely weekend.  Seriously?  Lovely.  Let's relive it, shall we?  It's not like I have work to do or anything.  Friday night, Lu Beth ditched me for freshly shaven Johnny Damon, so I was forced to settle for Shawn.  (Kidding!)  He and I drove out to the Charlie Horse in Bridgewater and had dinner... mmm scallops.  Afterwards, he graciously let me beat him in the arcade at racing, air hockey, skeeball, and shooting things.  Then we went to the pool hall and played a few games each of 8- and 9-ball.  I wasn't very clear on all the rules of 9-ball before, so I'm glad that now I know.  It's a fun game, but it seems a little unfair, since one player could clear the table, but if the other person just sinks the nine ball, they win?  I don't know.  I'm not complaining or anything; I had a very, very good time.  :)  Saturday I woke up on time to catch my bus to New York, but there was some confusion about the directions to South Station, and because I was going to end up having to take a later bus, I decided not to make the trip.  I felt bad when I talked to Erin later in the day and she reminded me that she's going away for the summer, but it really wasn't going to be a very good trip for me.  It would have been almost 12 hours on a bus just to go to NYC for dinner?  And as much as I wanted to see Erin and Christine... with the new job and everything else that's going on, it just wasn't a good time.  (Besides, they were already at home and in bed at 1:45am when I called them!)  Anyway, I went home and went back to sleep and then ran some errands.  I talked to Laurie and we decided to go and see  Lizzie Borden: The Musical  at the  urlLink Stoneham Theater .  Truthfully, I didn't know how great it was going to be, but now I'm so glad we went.  Lizzie was played by Jayne Patterson, who played Fantine in  Les Miz  on Broadway--and she was awesome!  There was also a character in the play, young Lizzie, sort of a ghost of older Lizzie's childhood, played by a local seventh grader (Andrea Ross) who was absoutely fabulous.  Besides the great acting, the music and book were entertaining, and the theater was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  Overall, a lovely experience!  And we had third row seats!  I was a little disappointed we didn't get blood spattered, but whatev.  I was secretly hoping they'd make us wear ponchos like at a Gallagher show or something...  heh.  Anyway again, after the show, Laurie and I drove to Brockton   (an aside:  gas.  costs.  over.  2.  dollars.  it costs me.  30.  dollars.  to fill.  my tank.  I DRIVE A CAMRY!!)  to pick up Shawn.  We were starving at that point, so we drove to Shawn's first destination suggestion: the China.  Mmmm, bar pizza, is there a food greater than you?  No.  So tiny, so thin, so greasy, so delicious with parmesan cheese...  Ahem.  I got to meet Pat, Shawn's old roommate who's name has come up a few times, and who happened to show up at the bar, which was cool.  Also, tequila shots?  Yay.  Sunday I had breakfast with Megan, Caitlin, Erin, and Shawn in Randolph, and then Shawn and I drove to Nantasket and Land's End, encountering a surprising amount of offensive art on the way.  Hee!  And Fort Revere?  Fun.  ;)  After our drive, I took Shawn home and Laurie and I went to see Shrek 2 in Braintree.  Shrek 2: eh.  Not nearly as funny as the first one, but worth the price of admission to watch Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas) lick himself.  Hee!  Unfortunately, it is currently Monday.  My back hurts and my fingernail is broken.  Boo!  But at least there's a long weekend coming up!!  Does anyone know what night WaterWorks opens?

       I got to talk to KT on the phone last night!  Well, actually this morning around 12:45am.  The first time I called I got my ass hung up on, but the second time, KT picked up and it was lovely.  We talked for a bit about some things that were going on with me, but it got a little awkward because of the 3 or 4 second delay over the phone card.  Also, KT sounded a little distracted near the end.  She said that it's sort of hard to come to the capital city and get all her phone calls and mail and banking and computer and everything and then go back to the village and have nothing.  I think she might have just been talking about being overstimulated.  I'm sure it is very difficult for her.  I wonder what it's going to be like when she comes back to the United States?  It sounds like it might be a pretty tough transition.  Saturday morning I'm  taking the bus  (ugh) to New York, which completely sucks.  Sorry to everyone I'm visiting and whatnot, but this trip is going to be very expensive and very short.  It's tough because I don't really want to have a weekend away, but I know that I should go and see everyone.  Hopefully it will be fun.  Apparently we're going to a Thai restaurant called Spice on Saturday night.  Sounds yummy, though dinner for 47 can get a little complicated.  Don't know what's up for tonight... I have a few phone calls in but I haven't heard anything back yet.  Who knows?  Thank Goodness It's Friday though, huh?

       Hey.  I  love  having a job.  Seriously?  To be actually  doing something  for the first time, and learning stuff--interesting stuff--it feels great.  I probably shouldn't be saying that I was doing nothing before, since honestly, if I hadn't had a year's worth of experience here (including over 9 months of working in departments I'm now recruiting for) I wouldn't have been able to get this job.  And it wasn't that I wasn't doing ANYTHING in previous positions, it was that I wasn't doing anything interesting or challenging.  While my workload now does have a fair amount of copying, data entry and other repetitive stuff, there's also a heathly helping of talking to and interacting with people, which is turning out well.  I actually have to go and do some stuff (imagine!), but here's a resolution: I'm going to make myself invaluable here.  Oh, just wait til they  try  to get ride of me in September.  Heh.  Oh also, mark your calendars:  June 6th:  My (new) yoga instructor, Kim, and some friends are having an MS benefit at the Weymouth studio that day which sounds  awesome .  You go, you donate $10, and Kim will be there calling 150 Sun Salutations!  Seriously, I don't mean to sound like a tool, but doesn't that sound like fun?  It's not going to be hot or anything, either, just regular yogaliciousness.  I'm there, and Laurie Beth, you'd better be too.  Anyone else interested?

       Hey, y'all... Monday (yesterday) was my first day in Human Resources.  So far things are working out pretty well.  Being back in JAB is not so bad, they totally re-did the quad and are going to run the big fountain this summer.  I know that that means nothing to anyone except Danielle and Kelly Mylett, who are the only two potential readers who I know have seen the JAB quad, but trust me, it's cool.  I stopped by to see B.O.B.C. in DTD, but he wasn't there.  Dina is long-gone, prescribed bedrest and therefore out for the rest of her pregnancy and then maternity leave.  **Sighs**  They're getting a temp.  Heh.  They miss me.  It was nice to see everyone but being back in the basement was a total bummer.  Danielle's thinking about coming home for Memorial Day!  I guess she found some cheap tickets and it's looking like we won't all have to wait until June to see her.  Not that you all are going to see her at all, since I'm totally going to hog her.  FIVES ON DANIELLE!!  Just kidding.  Seriously, keep your calendars clear for Memorial Day weekend, 'cause if she ends up coming I'm sure we'll be doing some fun stuff at least one of those days.  Mmmm, I talked to Kelly "Crazy McNutcase" Mylett last night (I'm kidding!  I love and miss Kelly A LOT).  Her mom was down to visit her recently.  I didn't really get much of the story, but since Mrs. Mylett didn't pick Kel up by her dreadlocks and drag her back North, I guess she's probably doing as well as she says she is.  Kel did mention that she's been having some problems with her roommate that are making living down there difficult for right now, but it doesn't seem that bad.  Especially since Kel is a good forgiver.  I swear though, if that girl tells me one more time, "It's like Thomas McFadden all over again," I'm going up into the Appalachian Trail and shutting down the Thomas McFadden cloning operation that they've got going on.  Seriously.  Anyway, homegirl says no more emails because she regrets the first one (ahem), but hopefully she'll get over it and tell us all more about her rooftop antics.  Heh.  Anyway again, Kel says that she cannot afford to come home in June like she said she would, and though she totally balked when I accused her of planning to stay away forever, she totally couldn't nail down a timeframe for her traveling.  Oh, well.  Kelly, BE CAREFUL!!  What else?  Word on the street is that I'm talking to KT Phillips in the MDC tonight!  Coolness, no?  I have to stay up until midnight to call her, but oh well.  It will be loverly, I'm sure.  I miss KT.  :(  This weekend was a lot of fun.  Friday night, Laurie and I met "Arlington" Kellie Yankauskas and her friends Megan and Courtney out at 711 Boylston Street, which I think also goes by the name, "Sketchytown USA."  It was fun, though, we made it just in time to have a few drinks at open bar.  Unfortunatamente, Kellie etc. were several dozens of drinks ahead of us, so Laurie and I got ditched in the basement of the Foggy Goggle (which--no).  We then marched all over Copley Square searching for Christine Kim's high school reunion at Clery's on Dartmouth, which we found and crrrrashed.  Yay!  Hi CP!!  Hi Justin!!  It was a fun time.  Saturday, I went to Jay and Renee's wedding with Shawn and Megan and John, and it was much fun.  I drank  a bit  too much (heh), but everything went well anyway.  Shawn was sad that we didn't get to do the Chicken Dance, but honestly?  From the looks of "MC Warren," Jay and Renee should just be grateful that he remembered to bring his speakers.  When he came, late.  And forgot Jay's name or ever meeting him.  Hmmm.  It was cool though.  Warren brought the flava, even if that meant not playing any music at all for long stretches of time.  Heh.  Um, after the wedding we went to Jay's house, to drink more, which was totally necessary.  Not.  Sunday morning I went to brunch with Jennine and Shawn and NotMegan and NotJohn because they slept in.  After brunch in Randolph, Shawn and I went to see Troy (eh), then to a benefit at the China (Shawn won two hats that he won't take back), then to Meg's for the Sopranos, the Practice, and playing with Pedro, Meg and John's Chiauaua (sp?).  All in all, a very fun weekend!  Aw.  Anyway, isn't this  much  better than having a goddamngirl front-page update?  Oooh, it so is.  Later,  I've got to go do some work!    Namaste.

       Well, following the livejournal debacle in which some private thoughts were made... unprivate through my own sloppy posting, I've decided to eighty-six the LJ and have a public blog.  (Imagine, you publish things on the web--and people read them!?)  Frankly, it's going to be easier to make frequent updates on this site instead of having to go in and edit the html on the goddamngirl front page everytime I want to vent.  So...  Today's my last day in corporate audit... tear!  I really am sad in one way, because I've really loved working for Jayne and Mike, but obviously I'm never going to be an auditor, so the job with HR is going to be a lot better on the career front.  I know that I've told a lot of you that I lied in the interveiw, telling the HR folks that I was so impressed with the Adecco people and the recruiting process that I'd witnessed at State Street that I was truly interested in a career in HR.  I've been thinking about this job's possibilities though, and I'm starting to think that that wasn't the biggest fib.  I mean, I am interested by the process.  HR is really in-depth and complicated, what with recruiting, hiring, training, compensation, benefits, etc... and every company has an HR department, so if this ends up being something I'm good at, it could be something fairly easy to find a position in.  I'm getting so ahead of myself though...  I don't really have time right now to update... I've been neglecting my webbersite and I also need to delete my incriminating LJ account.  I think I may move a couple of entries from there over here first, though.  I'll be back here sometime today though, so no worries.   Namaste.

       A-yuh.  **Please excuse hectic/non-linear thinking in this post, I'm in too much of a rush to edit.**  Well, the half of the zoo pictures are in:     We saw peacocks    and gorillas not escaping    and wild bulls!!  Tee hee hee.  Pictures from riding the bull at Tequila Rain will be up eventually.  I'm sort of waiting for Shawn to get my camera developed first, and then I can post all the zoo pics and TR pics at the same time and in the right order.  Also, check out  urlLink Zoe !  Shawn and I went to her first birthday party last saturday and she's just the sweetest!  Lots of other stuff has been going on.  For one, I'm swamped at work but I sorta love it.  I'm really getting the hang of it, I'm really loving what I'm doing and the people I work with and the people I get to meet--I feel run down sometimes, but I decided last night that run down and tired is only a state of mind and that if I stop complaining it won't be so bad.  Besides, how bad can life be when you have a boyfriend who brings you little boxes of Nerds?  Strawberry ones?  How dare I complain?  ^_^  On a sadder note, Paige Ambrose, you are officially given up on.  I erased your phone numbers from my phone last Friday night in a drunken rage and I don't regret it.  Who doesn't return 50 phone calls in so many weeks?  And Miss Keefe, you're thisclose to traveling down Ambrose Avenue and getting your ass erased as well.  This is wack shit, yo.  CALL ME BACK!  Moving right along, there are several things I'm looking forward to right now, and now you can look for them too: -----3 days til I visit Anita -----8 days til Dan Yell visits -----20 days til I visit the MO -----34 days til I turn 22 again -----39 days til I move to Norwood  Yippie!  Oh, also, next Friday we graduate bartending class so y'all can look forward to me mixing you up some badass drinks.  Yo Smelly, I know you don't read this but I'm addressing you anyway: Remember after I worked at F1 that summer and that kid Tim mixed a drink for me and gave me the recipie and it was called Tim's Sweet Tart?  I found the recipie the other day in an old pocketbook in my closet!  I can't wait to mix it up.  Remember that Pat at the Tap wouldn't make it for us?  Some bar made it though, cause we definitely had it, right?  Those were some pretty sweet little drinks!  How do you even make a shot that has 6 liquors in it??  Anyway, Smells, don't think that you can come to my bar and get one for free, cause you've been neglecting me.  Not that I'm bitter.  In fact, it's the opposite... I'm happy and having fun and doing interesting things and I wish that some of my closer friends were around to hang with me.  I know we live far apart and everything, but come on.  I just thought things would be different after we graduated.  Like, more not boring!  I am not boring, people, hang with me.   urlLink Sabine  is on her way back to the East Coast!  Beanie, I miss you!  Her livejournal says she's leaving San Fran this week for Brazil and Spain to visit the 'rents and that she will be back in the US in NYC at the end of August.  Girlfriend got housing at Colombia, too, which I hear is pretty hard to do.  I'm coming to visit, yo.  We can invite our 34 closest friends to dinner!  It will take forever and cost a fortune yay!  I talked to Beans the other day and she was all, "How's Alexis?  Are you guys having the best time!?"  Meh.  Alright, it's lunch time and I feel as though I'm starting to wallow in my negative vibe.  Booooo!    Movies you should see because I did and they were good: Troy The Day After Tomorrow (Jake!) Harry Potter 3 50 First Dates (just out on video) Dodgeball (I didn't see it but Anne did and she recommended it, and she recommended Office Space so we trust her) King Arthur (it didn't come out yet but we're still going to see it) The 10th Grade Scarlet Letter Video (because no one's collection is complete without this classic starring Jenn Kerner as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Caitlin Phillips as Rev. Dimmesdale/the weather girl/Batelyn Millips)

       1. Your favorite song with the name of a city in the title or text.  "St. Louie" by Nelly.  Because I love him, the song is funny, and Dan Yell lives there.  2. A song you've listened to repeatedly when you were depressed at some point in your life.  I don't know if there's enough room on the internet... let's start with a top seven (note, the purpose of listening was to make me  more  depressed):      -"You Oughta Know," Alanis      -"Hooker," Dan Bern      -"Only In Dreams," Weezer      -"Better Man," Pearl Jam      -"Running Away," Hoobastank      -"Walk Away," Ben Harper      -"Out Loud," Dispatch  3. Ever bought an entire album just for one song and wound up disliking everything but that song? Gimme that song.  Hmm, yes, because once I bought a single and my mother said that was stupid so now I always buy the album.  The first time I got burned was when I bought Mr. Big for that song "Wild World," remember that?  It was a long time ago.  Most recently (last summer?), I bought Deadsy's album for "Grammercy Park."  Yuck.  At least it was only five bucks.  4. A great song in a language other than English.  I don't really know too many, but "Guerra," by Gondwana is pretty ultra-fabulous.  And I don't really remember how it goes, but how can one not love Victor Jara's "Te Recuerdo Amanda"?  5. Your least favorite song on one of your favorite albums of all time.  I don't know if I have a favorite album, and if I do I certainly wouldn't remember the worst song on it.  I'm sort of bad at this game.  6. A song you like by someone you find physically unattractive or otherwise repellent.  R. Kelly.  Anything, but especially "Ignition."  I really, really tried to hate it, but... It's the remix to Ignition!  Hot and fresh out the kitchen!  C'mon.  7. Your favorite song that has expletives in it that's not by Liz Phair.  Anything rap?  This survey is so not written for me.  8. A song that sounds as if it's by someone British but isn't.  ?  Really.  9. A song you like (possibly from your past) that took you forever to finally locate a copy of.  "Bubbletoes" by Jack Johnson.  It was on a mix CD before everyone knew him, and no one knew what it was called or who sang it.  Luckily it was during the Napster era, so I found it in a little under 8 hours and didn't have to wait for the CD to come out.  10. A song that reminds you of spring but doesn't mention spring at all.  "Stickshifts and Safetybelts," by Cake, because it makes me feel like driving in nice weather.  11. A song that sounds to you like being happy feels.  This is too hard.  ~_~  12. Your favorite song from a non-soundtrack compilation album.  Grrr... aren't the songs from compilation albums usually found elsewhere?  This was a mistake.  13. A song that reminds you of high school.  Disgustingly and pathetically, "Lady In Red," and I'm not telling why.  Also, "What I Got," totally makes me think of Leslie Mullen every time.  Weird, huh?  14. A song that reminds you of college.  Oh, all of them.  "California Dreamin'", "What's Your Fantasy," "Laid," and "Cold Hearted," to name a (very) few.  15. A song you actually like by an artist you otherwise dislike.  Hmmm, that's a good question.  I like Jessica Simpson's version of "Take My Breath Away," even though I usually think she's a pain in the ass.  Also, there are a few songs on Toxicity that I'm totally into, even though System of a Down scares me.  16. A song by a band that features three or more female members.  "Vacation," by the Go-Gos?  You aren't even asking for music I like anymore.  17. One of the earliest songs that you can remember listening to.  Anything by Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, or Tiffany.  18. A song you've been mocked by friends for liking.  "One Toke Over the Line," by Brewer and Shipley.  Also, I've been called a Pipes Groupie a lot, and I'm not positive that everyone's OK with that.  19. A really good cover version you think no one else has heard.  "Baby One More Time," (originally by Britney) covered by Travis.  It's all slow and sad and acoustic and wonderful... or "Gin and Juice" supposedly covered by Phish (though I'm not positive it's them) but everyone knows that one.  Also, "I Will Survive," by Cake manages to drop in an F-bomb, which is A-OK by me.  20. A song that has helped cheer you up (or empowered you somehow) after a breakup or otherwise difficult situation.  "Follow Me," by Uncle Kracker (and Christine singing it to me) made me happy when I was sad.

          urlLink www.explodingdog.com  (check it out)  Shawn: I dont get it  Me: i know, it's a little weird Shawn: whats with the blood dripping out of the pen/straw  Me: is it blood? Shawn: dunno  Shawn: maybe Me: what's the piece of paper on the floor? Shawn: Zoo map?  Awww!  Cutie.  Backing up a little, though, let's re-do the weekend as per usual.  Friday I went into work until about 1pm EVENTHOUGH it was the National Day of Mourning (those capitals may be unnecessary but I'm playing it safe).  I needed the hours.  They only let me work 36.25 hours a week anyway, so I might as well earn as many of them as I can, especially since I'm moving so soon.  Blah.  We decided to live downstairs in the Norwood apartment by the way... moving August 1!  ^_^  As I was saying, though, Friday after my mini-work day I went home and took a looooovely nap, and while I had to skip lunch with Shawn to do it (-_-,) I really needed to grab a few extra hours.  Unfortunatamente, it made me late for dinner with Lu Beth.  I am a bad person.  But Cheesecake Factory made it mostly all better.  We caught up, ate shrimp and chicken, caught up more, ate cheesecake, then walked to Fenway.  Once there we utilized Babysitter Laurie's 50% discount at the pro-shop to it's fullest extent.  That means that I couldn't decide between getting a Nomar or Varitek shirt for the whole first inning.  Lucklily I decided on number 33, since Nomar didn't play.  The game was fun though not especially exciting until the 6th or 7th inning, but that's ok.  I saw a little Lowe and a little Ortiz, so that counts for something.  ^_^  And Sox won!  After the game we walked to Fanueil Hall where we met Laurie's new man, Jeff, and his buddy Ohio Scott at the Trinity (no cover).  It was fun.  They are engineers.  Jeff reminds me of someone that I can't think of... O. Scott reminded me of Bryan Armstrong minus the hardcore coke habit and questionable sexuality.  Same sort of hyper personality, though.  The whole thing was very deja-vu.  But fun.  Though Laurie talked to Jeff on the phone for the whole $40 cab ride home.  I don't know, you pay $20 for a cab ride, you expect some pleasant conversation, yeah?  I don't know, I guess she got some for her 20.  And I luckily brought my iPod.  ^_^  Saturday morning Sugar Pussy picked me up for our mystery date at 10 am as promised and almost made me lose my breakfast when he totally faked me out and told me we were driving to New Hampshire to go skydiving.  I'm talking cottonmouth, loss of appetite, sweating, the whole deal--I totally believed him and I was completely terrified.  He totally had me.  For like, 5 minutes.  He even told me not to chicken out because he had already paid for it... I don't even like to think about it.  He's awful.  ^_^  He's the best!  He finally admitted that we were going to the zoo and the Olive Garden instead, whew.  No gorillas escaped while we were at Franklin Park, but I think that everyone would agree that there was   "TOO MUCH LINE!!!"    Heehee.  Look for pictures on  urlLink Goddamngirl  soon, we took lots of 'em but we both have to finish our throwaway cameras.  Speaking of, I have pictures from Pat's Tequila Rain party that I have to post but I haven't had time at work lately... I'll have to get on that.  Maybe when we go BACK to Tequila Rain Friday to ride the bull (and never, never go upstairs) I'll finish the roll so there will be zoo pictures and animal pictures.  Yay!  ^_^    What else is going on?  I'm working on getting Smelly a job, but we'll see about that because she doesn't want to start this summer.  Danielle is coming home on July 4th!!!  Whooooooo!!!  You know you want to hang out.  I hate to be a Tequilla Rain addict but I think Dan Yell will really like it?  I don't know, she's not going to be here all weekend, so I guess we'll have to see what it's like.  Tomorrow (hopefully) Shawn and I are going to check out a bartending class, and (hopefully) it will be good so I will stop being a wuss and take it.  Who watched North Shore tonight?  Las Vegas with waves?  Eh.  I'm a little in between on this one.  They'll have to do some real work next week to keep me interested.  The Casino, though?  Never again.  Mark Burnett, you disappointed the pants off me, homie.  I've never seen "reality" television so utterly contrived and obvious and boring.  Well... Joe Millionaire was pretty bad.  But this was awful!  I'm out.  I bet  urlLink TWOP  doesn't even cover it!  Well I know they will, but I bet they stop after a week.  Alright, bed time.   Namaste...

       Ok, a quickie:  Erin W., thank you so much for your email!  When I saw it in my inbox, I was totally expecting a grouper, and was overjoyed (really, a lot more than I should have been) to get a personal note!  Thanks!  I promise I'll be responding as SAP, but work has been busy lately and it might have to wait til the weekend.  Preview: I'm going to comiserate re: being over your head at work while conceding that at least they speak English where I work (mostly).  One other thing I had to get up:  We've been getting great letters from Patrick since he left for basic.  Really?  The kid can write a letter.  Who knew?  And I don't mean just  writing , I mean that his letters are funny, concise, and really interesting.  Anyway, I've been debating for a while about whether or not to quote from his letters here, because he writes some interesting/funny stuff, but I don't know if he and/or the rents are cool with broadcasting the letters.  (Need I remind us all again that I've been burned?)  But I found this one in the letters-from-Pat pile, and I couldn't resist this excerpt.  The letter has no date but it's stamped May 8, 2004 (oh and  SIC  big time, except for some spelling):   I'm at the 43rd A.G. battalion waiting to be shipped to basic.... There really isn't much to tell you guys.  Before I sign off, I forgot to tell you guys a funny story on the flight here we stopped in Chicago and while we were waiting to board the plane some girl asked me if I was joining the army we get to talking and it turns out she is going to the same place as me and has the same job.  So we board the plane and about a half an hour into the flight the girl comes by my seat and says come with me and keeps walking.  So I follow her to the front of the plane and what was there the women's room!  She looks at me and goes and I'm not kidding, "Want to be a member of the mile high club?" haha and thats not it then she says "What a memory it would be to take through basic!" haha.  But I chickened out!  Well gotta go I'll write soon love you guys.   ... I don't believe it either!!  -_^  More tomorrow!   Namaste.

       So, things are good.  Erin and I have been looking around at apartments (ok, one), and it looks like downstairs on Folan Ave. might just be the best way to go.  Erin won't have to move her stuff, she already has a great relationship with the landlord, the house would be all ours with her former roommates upstairs, the neighborhood is nice, there's plenty of parking... and most importantly, it's cheaper than anyplace else we've looked at.  I'm still keeping an eye out, but I think that price has to be the number one issue.  Anyway, nothing's definitely definite, but I'm still getting excited.  ^_^  On a related tip: I have issues.  It is completely impossible for me to make a decision on my own.  Consider the idea of taking a bartending class, and witness my complete inability to decide what is best for me.  Admittedly, $370 is a lot to spend at one shot, but I'm still finding it next to impossible to weigh the pros and cons of taking it, since I can only justify spending the money if I get a job afterwards, and I can't decide whether or not I can handle a second job.  Then I have to consider whether or not I'll even be good at actually bartending, because if I can't be making the big bucks, what's the point?  Then I have to worry about the fact that even if I can fit the job in and I turn out to be a great bartender, will I be able to find myself a decent job?  I don't know.  A woman that I work with works at a catering company and has offered to set me up there (on the waitstaff), so I might be able to bartend there once or twice a week, which might not be to bad--especially if they're paying 16-18 dollars an hour and the bartender at the wedding totally gets tipped.  Especially if she is hott like me!  -_^  Or Florian Hall might be an option, or really any catering company/function hall that I might be able to find.  Dunno, man.  I'll probably take the class though.  Honestly?  Stop being gay, Amanda.  Moving on.  Office politics here are totally heating up, which is totally awesome!  The people in this department are, by nature, very personable and interact-y, so everyone here is a little on the gossipy side.  Which is great, because I am sick of being bored at work.  The recruiter that I work with that's the only full employee (not an outside contractor like the rest) is quitting because he got another job.  Oooh, burn.  Turns out we don't pay our recruiters very much, boooo.  I want his job.  I know it won't happen, but I still want it.  Oh, to move back one cubicle and have benefits and a page on the online phone book... It sucks because I think that if he had decided to leave at the end of the summer, I might have the slightest chance of being able to get in on that, but not now.  I'm too green.  I haven't made myself invaluable yet.  -_^  Fortunately, in the wake of this news, one of the contract recruiters has confided that she plans on leaving at the end of the summer.  Score!  Now all I have to do is fill in for the missing guy until they find someone to replace him but then continue to do his job until the contract recruiter leaves and I slide on in to her shoes.  Ah.  It feels good to have a follow-up to "make myself invaluable."  Of course, I have no idea how much money the recruiters make... but if the guy who's leaving has been supporting his wife and three kids on his salary for the past five months, I think it might be a number that I could work with.  I'll find out soon enough, anyway, because when the internal posting goes up online they'll post the pay grade.  Ah, things are falling into place and my Master Plan may not be bullshit.  Though, the whole premise for the Master Plan is relies on the assumption that I could/am qualified to do the work of a recruiter, but I've been hanging out here for a month now, and unless something seriously tricksy is going down behind the scenes, I think that I could manage.  Meanwhile, boss-lady wants to "touch base" this afternoon, so we'll see what's up with that.  There is the distinct possibility that this plan has absolutely no basis whatsoever in reality.  But one can dream.  Maybe I shouldn't be posting all this stuff about work.  No one really does, you know?  I've tried to stalk some BHS grads with blogs and livejournals and I get frustrated because I can't  fully  stalk.  How annoying.  Anyway, since I already got myself in trouble once with this thing, maybe I'll have to do some editing...  On a TV related note, Last Comic Standing started last night, and guess who's on??   JIMMY!!   I heard a rumor, but I thought, no!   urlLink Jimmy   urlLink Norton  would never sink to a Rich Vos low and aim for a sitcom!?!  But I was wrong.  Jimmy's way funnier than Vos though, if a little less mainstream, but maybe he'll be on his best behavior and get far on the show.  Though I suspect that they cut out a lot of his call backs act already... and what's up with auditioning in Florida?  Weird.  Also, the guy we saw open for Dane Cook is on LCS as well... Gary something?  If you watched it, he was the tall guy that they picked in Boston.  He was pretty funny, he did this bit that we saw him do... something like, "The Pill is the best thing ever, and you know it, because all I have to say is 'The Pill' and you know what I'm talking about.  I just give you 'the' and a noun, and you're all on board.  The Pill that cures polio?  No, not that one.  The Pill that you use and you don't have to use a condom."  Heehee.  It's my new summer show.  ^_^

         Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep This air is blessed, you share with me This night is wild, so calm and dull These hearts they race from self-control Your legs are smooth as they graze mine We're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours, to fill or burst To break or bury, or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  The words are hushed, let's not get busted, Just lay entwined here undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions.. Hey did you get some? Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close They can't hear, so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours, to fill or burst To break or bury, or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  Hands down, this is the best day I can ever remember I'll always remember the sound of the stereo,  The dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair That you twirled in your fingers And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late And this walk that we shared together The streets were wet and the gate was locked So I jumped it, and let you in And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist And you kissed me like you meant it And I knew that you meant it That you meant it, that you meant it And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it.   ~Dashboard Confessional,  Hands Down

         And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place.  This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.  Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrope occurred, and the idea was lost for ever.  This is not her story.   ~Douglas Adams, THGTTG preface  (That's Fenchurch.)

       Per request of Sugar Pussy, an update.  I am so sick.  Uck.  Fortunately I didn't run into many people junior year at Trin, otherwise they would all know how disgusting I am right now, as I currently have the same gross cold I had for about 5 months there back in the day.  Does that sentence make sense?  I don't know, I'm on drugs... the DayQuill and the NyQuill are having a fight in my brain.  Anyway, this past weekend was a long one.  Memorialio Day Weekend, yay!  I'm sad it's gone already.  Holiday weekends are sometimes a mixed blessing, because you have time off from work, but you can't get anything done (like going to the bank, or going to the post office or whatever) because it's a holiday.  So, with such a useless day off, what options are we left with regarding how best to spend our time?  Oh yes, drinking and... drinking a lot.  Friday night, Shawn and I went to the dogtrack where neither one of us won anything.  Boo hoo.  I hate to lose.  I guess betting sentimental favorites (like the dog with my brother's birthday who came in last) isn't the best strategy, but what is?  I don't know anything about the odds or quinellas or the difference between placing and showing, so, as Shawn said, betting on a dog because it's gradfather's name reminds me of my mother's first car is as good a "strategy" as any.  Hee.  After the races (and saving Santa's Little Helper from certain death in the parking lot) we went to the Texas Roadhouse at the Brockton Mall for dinnerrrr, mmm.  Phil, our waiter, was the best.  I wish he had said "Yee-haw," a couple of times, but I guess maintaining his composure while listing the margarita flavors for us while standing next to the rest of the waitstaff who were screaming in some sort of birthday ritual/Texan animal sacrifice at the next table will have to do.  By the way, Danielle?  When you come visit, we're going there for the 'ritas.  Mmmmm.  I didn't try it, but they serve one that has light beer in it?  To quote the menu, "Seriously? It's good."  I believe the menu.  Why would it lie?  An aside: on the way there, Shawn mentioned that you could pick your own steak, and the way he said it, I was reminded of The Restaurant At The End Of the Universe (in that book or THHG, I forget which), when the cow comes to the table and asks which piece of him they want, and he's all, "My shoulder is delicious," and when Ford picks one, he's all, "Very well, I'll just nip off and shoot myself."  Douglas Adams, cardcarrying PETA member?  Hmmm.  Erin, thoughts?  Saturday, Laurie, Matt and I went to the Comedy Connection to see  urlLink Dane Cook , who is, seriously?  Funny.  Very funny.  He opened with "lyrics" written to the "soothing melody" of a car alarm, which included, "Feed me gasoline," and "Oil is my blood," and closed with him recounting a story about his accidentally singing the Super Mario Bros. theme song while jerking off in front of a girl.  Ah.  My back and neck hurt after that one.  Very, very funny.  Also, one of the guys who opened for him is going to be on Last Comic Standing (or was?), so cool.  After the show, we walked to Hurricane O'Reilley's to meet Courtney, her friend Jess from RPI and Kelly Paty.  There was dancing, lesbians, and mistaken identities... a fun night all around.  Unfortunately no girl fight in the parking garage, but oh well.  Sunday I went to Kevin's baseball game in the morning and got a little sun and then cleaned my car.  Sunday night we went to WaterWorks, which was cold.  And I'm sorry, but does anyone think that they're  successfully  pulling off the Paris Hilton look?  It doesn't even look good on PARIS HERSELF, people.  Those extensions?  Do not look real.  What's up with that?  I mean, I think that Paris is pretty and even interesting/likeable at times, but that hair?  Doesn't look real.  Her short hair looks so much better.  I don't know, but God help us all if that's the look for the summer, because... no.  Anyway, not everyone showed up who was supposed to ( Megan ), but that's ok.  Shawn, Erin, a couple of her roommates, Laurie, Court, Jess, Kelly, and Matt and some of his friends all showed up.  Yay!  There were shots and stuff, but it ended up being a little more low-key than I expected.  I think it takes more of a summer mood to be happy there.  If it isn't warm, it's not SPRIIIIIIIIIIIING BRRRRRRRRRREAK!!!!  It's just... cold.  Outside.  Beer in a can.  :)  Which isn't to say I didn't have fun, because I did.  It'll get better later in the year.  And they're hiring bartenders, which I may soon be, but more on that another time.  Monday was breakfast (The Randolph Omlette?  Yeah.), The Day After Tomorrow (Wolves?  Not.), a drive, and a walk in the park ("Mesquite?  What is mesquite?  Do they make it with mosquitos?" ~Jerry Seinfeld), and a little bit of The OC with Shawn.  The Day After Tomorrow?  Is worth a look.  It's really cool looking and there are some scary parts and  urlLink Jake Gyllenhaal ?  I love you.  Even if you love Emmy Rossum, the girl from Mystic River, in this movie.  I still love you, even though in real life you are engaged to that airhead, Kirsten Dunst.  Since she was in my favorite movie in the history of cinema--Bring It On--I'm letting it slide, lov-ah.  And because your dad graduated from Trinity, we're PRACTICALLY RELATED so ew, it would be like incest if we got married anyway, so yeah.  Marry Kirsten, see if I care.  Like she doesn't have something going on with Tophergraceimeantobeymaguire on the side?  Whatever you gotta tell yourself to get to sleep at night, buddy.  Jake!  But, as usual, I digress.  Massively.  Yesterday Erin G. and I went to look at an apartment in Readville.  Which was pleasant, but I don't think we're interested.  I liked it, but not enough to pay more than in Erin's landlord's downstairs apartment.  Plus the landlord was kind of a sketch, plus condescending and dismissive, which I did not like.  Al, you're a jerk.  Pfffffft.  Quick things and then I'm out, since I would prefer not to be fired: ~ Kerner in JAB?  Maybe... ~ Everyone: Tequila Rain Friday.  Or else. ~ Did I mention that I'm sick?  Boooo hoooo. ~ Laurie MacBeth (hahaha), can I borrow  Pledged ?  Puhleeese?  And  Wicked ? ~ We lit a fire in the stove the other day.  June First! ~ It is so cold in my office. ~ How do people paint pictures with watercolors?  Mine always come out blotchy!  Maybe if I had better brushes. ~ Speaking of watercolors, I love the Sprint commercial where the teacher gives the new girl the nice paint set, "Because she's new.  She's  new !"  Because that's what the cell phone company really does! ~ Speaking of commercials, the Fraud Protection Identity Theft commercials?  Brilliant.  Somebody needs to get a Pullitzer, or whatever they give out for commercials (I know it isn't the Pullitzer), and if there isn't one, I say give them the Nobel Prize for Literature, if there is one.  Seriously.  Though, is it a problem that I can't remember the company that it's an ad for?  I probably could, if I thought about it.  Send me a note in the comments and tell me what's your favorite?  For me it's a tie between the girl in the salon/nerd who's building a robot--"A  girl  robot.  This is gonna be the best prom ever," and the fat guy in the chair/teenage girl who's all about the leather bustier because "it lifts and seperates!"  Hee hee.  Seriously, tell me.  I love to relive them in all their glory.  Finally, I heard this song on the radio yesterday (yay 100.7) and I forgot how much I liked it...   We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change  The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange  He asks a man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes  Get a job you fucking slob, is all he replies   God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes  'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues   Then you really might know what it's like...  Then you really might know what it's like...  Then you really might know what it's like...  Then you really might know what it's like...   Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love  He said, Don't worry about a thing, baby doll  I'm the man you've been dreaming of.  But 3 months later he say he won't date her or return her call  And she swear, God damn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls.  And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door  They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore   God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes  'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose   Then you really might know what it's like...  Then you really might know what it's like...  Then you really might know what it's like...  Then you really might know what it's like...   I've seen a rich man beg  I've seen a good man sin  I've seen a tough man cry  I've seen a loser win  And a sad man grin  I heard an honest man lie  I've seen the good side of bad  And the downside of up  And everything between  I licked the silver spoon  Drank from the golden cup  And smoked the finest green  I stroked the baddest dimes at least a couple of times before I broke their heart  You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start   I knew this kid named Max  who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs  He liked to hang out late  He liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs  Until late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head  He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead  Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain  You know it crumbles that way  At least that's what they say when you play the game   God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news  'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose   Then you really might know what it's like...  Then you really might know what it's like...  Then you really might know what it's like...to have to lose   ~Everlast, "What It's Like"

       Hey guys--   Pat's now at Fort Sam Houston, TX, doing his AIT (Advanced Individual Training) for the Medical Corps.&nbsp; The FSH website is pretty big but isn't really yeilding much info on what's going on with him there.&nbsp; We did get a short letter from Pat that said AIT is a lot like basic except that they go to school 8-10 hours a day and that school moves fast.&nbsp; He&nbsp;also mentioned that he'll get a chance to go up in a Blackhawk helicopter, which he's excited about.   An example of criptic army lingo that peppers Pat's letters and all the Army websites I try to read:    I set my goal today....&nbsp;to finish AIT with&nbsp;a 95 to 100 average and score a 300 on the PT test.&nbsp; If I&nbsp;do that I will&nbsp;get a chance to extend my MOS&nbsp;to&nbsp;91W(M6).&nbsp; If I do get the M6 added to my MOS I will be here at good Fort Sam an additional 16 weeks!   Um, thanks for clearing that up,&nbsp;Pat.&nbsp; Anyway, he's working towards becoming an LPN and maybe getting college credits toward becoming an RN.&nbsp; Yay, Pat!&nbsp; Anyway, write the man a letter, wouldja?&nbsp; I remember how nice it was to get letters in college, and I can only imagine it must be at least 20 times as nice to get them in the Army...&nbsp; He'd probably appreciate a picture or two, or at least a note.&nbsp; :)   Here's his new address:   Pvt. Pat Lydon  Foxtrot Co.&nbsp; 232nd Med Bn  2950 Koleher Rd.&nbsp; Bld. 1350  FSH Texas&nbsp; 78234   Do it.

       I read this advice column pretty regularly.  It's a regular feature on Sarah "Sars" Bunting's website, Tomato Nation.  Read it, love it.  Sars gives the best advice!  Which is actually reminiscent of Danielle's... but Danielle isn't  published  now, is she??    From "The Vine," August 21, 2003 copyright Sarah D. Bunting and Early Girl Inc.     Sars --    I spent most of yesterday reading through Vine archives, but did not see a problem that reflected mine, so I don't feel too bad about sending this out into the digital air.    I am a 20-year-old college student still battling with shyness. It's not the type that sends me into a sweaty panic every time I go out, or makes me want to cry before a presentation. My shyness emerges when I meet people for the first time. I have nothing to say. Nothing to comment on. I'm horrible at small talk and find it pointless. It's worse when I'm in a group situation; I tend to fade into the background.    This becomes complex since, so I've discovered, people find it impossible that someone my age should be shy. "They" think that it only exists around middle-school students on the first day of classes. Not someone about to enter her junior year in college. So then the problem arises that my male peers consider me unapproachable, to the point of being intimidating. Female peers, who I've never had a problem with, let alone talked to on a personal level, call me a bitch behind my back.    I've asked my friends why people who don't know me would have such harsh opinions, and their response is consistent, yet so very odd. I have a fair complexion -- light blonde hair and untannable skin (and no, I'm not complaining), but have the deepest brown eyes that most people think they're black. Since I was not "blessed" with the sparkling blue eyes that would perfect the All-American Girl stereotype, people find my "piercing" gaze to be cold and intimidating. I'm just shy! I'm not going to buy contacts, because, frankly, I find the concept of my eye color bringing on this harsh reaction from strangers to be...well...damn stupid.    I have been told from high school acquaintances that people I have known for years but never talked to were always put off by my "obvious" superior attitude, so this isn't a new small-college development. I would normally not care what complete strangers think of me, but my college campus is very small, and I would prefer having the opportunity for someone to get to know the real me before someone who's never spoken to me whispers that I'm a "bride of Satan" (this is true -- just found out a few days ago that a girl I've never had a problem with, never spoken to/about, has spread this to anyone who will listen). Thankfully, my friends, or just those who have given me a chance, defend me, but I can't expect that forever. I don't want that.    So, what I'm ultimately asking is: How do I make that immediate first impression reflect who I truly am? How do I break out of a shell that's at least 12 years thick? If I cannot show my true personality, at least help people realize that it's not a superiority complex, but genuine shyness that keeps me from talking? I know I cannot force someone to think a certain way about me, so it is how I present myself that will nip this annoyance in the bud.    I ask you, Sars, because I have a small feeling you personally have no battle with shyness.    It Can't Be The Eye Color       Dear Eye,  Based on what you've told me? Try to open up your face. Smile more; raise your eyebrows more. Your physiognomy, combined with what you've absorbed already about what people think of you, probably makes you look sterner than you feel, and relaxing your face a bit is a good way to seem less forbidding without having to act fake.  Also, stop caring. Anyone worth befriending has already figured out that, most of the time, "standoffishness" is actually just shyness, and if a girl who's never even met you is calling you Bride Of Satan, it's pretty clearly a pathological insecurity issue on her end. I've heard secondhand for years that people find me intimidating, but I have cat hair all over me and I'm standing by the keg cracking fart jokes, so -- whatever. You can't control people's perceptions all the time, and you shouldn't bother trying.

        urlLink Aaron rules.      One side effect of being a cog in the system at work is that you no longer feel remorse about lying. In fact, you are encouraged to lie, on the job, about your job.&nbsp; Only in corporate America, it’s called “recruiting.” I once stood at a table at a job fair for three hours just straight-up lying to undergrads about how amazing my job was – even though only a few months earlier I had been lied to myself.&nbsp; No wonder one of my buddies had no qualms about sticking a dozen cotton balls in his mouth once so that he could call his boss and pretend he just had his wisdom teeth out and couldn’t come to work.   For those of you reading this at work right now, I want you to know that I feel your pain.&nbsp; I know what you're going through.&nbsp; If you're a summer intern, right now you're watching the clock, waiting for it to hit five so you can bolt out the door and hit happy hour. If you're in your late twenties, right now you're wishing you went to law school. If you're a guy, the office is way too hot and the other window open on your computer is Bill Simmons' column on ESPN.com.&nbsp; If you're a girl, the office is way too cold and the other window open on your computer is the new arrivals section of Bluefly.com. As for me, well, I know that living off of book royalties and stand-up gigs can't last forever. Maybe one day I will return to the working world. But this time, I'm keeping the sideburns.   I love how the term “FYI” is now used as every part of speech in the office.&nbsp; Noun? “Just as an FYI, tell James I’ll be at the meeting.”&nbsp; Verb? “Can you FYI James and tell him I’ll be at the meeting?”&nbsp; I swear I once heard a co-worker use it as an adverb: “I told James FYI-ishly about the meeting.”&nbsp; It’s like when the Smurfs use the word “smurf” to mean twelve different things.  I have absolutely no idea how to score bowling. Once someone gets two strikes in a row I just give up and order another pitcher of beer.

         Csk99:   why don't you pick up your phone woman?   People who rock and have wished me a Happy 23rd today:  Danielle  Laurie Beth  Shawn  Christine  John Nam  Laura Rand  Lauren DiChiara  Tina     jnam8019:   happy happy birthday amanda!!!    ph ench urch 42:   haha, thanks, how did you know?    jnam8019:   oh a little asian fairy told me :-P   Isn't CK the sweetest?   Anyway, because I have to be at work on my birthday, I'm spending the day shopping.&nbsp; On  urlLink Amazon &nbsp;I ordered  Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three ,  Snobbery: The American Version , and  God's Debris  by Scott Adams (of Dilbert fame).&nbsp; I'm also cruising  urlLink Overstock &nbsp;for vacuums--with Hepa filtration systems, of course.&nbsp; If I can't have an  urlLink ionic breeze , I might as well have a good vacuum.&nbsp; I'm also reading  urlLink Tomato Nation &nbsp;(the Vine) and  urlLink Sure Thing, Babs &nbsp;(which is so awesome that I've started reading it from the beginning (9/2001) and I might just read straight through).   Mmm.&nbsp; Everytime I look at my telephone and it says, "7/27/04" I smile.&nbsp; I love the date.&nbsp; It's so pretty... 7/27.&nbsp;   Now, I know I know you all a Missouri story, but... just kidding, no excuses, les go.    Tuesday, July 13  , I stayed at work until about noon finishing up and then drove home and got my stuff together.&nbsp; My auntie Nancy dropped us (Mom, Dad, Steve, Kev, Grandpa) off at the airport and we flew from Boston to O'Hare and O'Hare to St. Louis with little issue.&nbsp; We picked up a rental at the aeropuerto and took off for St. Robert and Fort Leonard Wood.&nbsp; We arrived and checked into the hotel around 12:30.     Wednesday, July 14 , was family day at the base, so we had breakfast and drove up there.&nbsp; After a thorough searching of the car, we were allowed onto the base to search for the barracks.&nbsp; We found them eventually, and as we pulled up, wondering how on earth we were going to find Pat, he called my cell phone.&nbsp; Perfect timing.&nbsp; We reunited       and took Pat back to the hotel to have a beer and chill out.&nbsp; On the way back we grabbed lunch at Country Kitchen.&nbsp; After Pat had gone back, we went to take a look at the Museum on base, which Kevin thoroughly enjoyed:       It was actually a very cool museum.&nbsp; Then (I think--timeline fuzzy, as there was a lot of down time) we picked Pat up again for a swim in the pool and dinner at Ruby Tuesdays.&nbsp; We ate a lot that week, people.    Thursday , July 15 , we were back at the base early for drill and ceremony (marching around and singing), during which Pat received his PT award:       After that, we had a ton of time to kill, so we drove a few miles down the interstate to the Onyx Caverns which was good because a) it was HOT out and the 55 degree cavern was refreshing b) the 45 minute tour killed the perfect amount of time and c) 'twas cool:       After the caverns we went back to the base for graduation, where everyone sounded off and yelled a lot.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; After graduation we took Pat shopping for some CDs and a bag for his long bus ride to TX, and then went to dinner at a place called Aussie Jack's (kind of like Outback).&nbsp; We dropped Pat off at about 8:30:      "Bye, Pat!"   and then drove back to the STLMO, where Danielle picked me up, took me home, and zzzzzzz...    Friday, July 16 , Danielley had to  urlLink work , but she left me her car so I was able to meet her and Clint for lunch at a Mexican place "up the street"--i.e. twenty-five miles away.&nbsp; 'Twas gross, but it was great to meet Mr. Buchanon.&nbsp; After I left them, I drove to the World's Emptiest Mall, and picked up a few things, then back to Westport Station to the pool.&nbsp; When Dani got home from work, we went for a drive and then to the liquor store, only to discover that Blue Curacao doesn't exist in Missouri.&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; So we bought ingredients for Pearl Harbors and Kamikazes, which I mixed (professionally, mind you) while Danielle showered.&nbsp; Then we were off to Mike and Mike's keg party, were I fell asleep at 11:30.&nbsp; Maybe it had something to do with this...       but who knows about these things, really?&nbsp; Heh, heh, heh.&nbsp;    Saturday, July 17 ,&nbsp;Dani and I met some of her friends for threepm breakfast, and then we and Dusty and Darcy drove downtown to take a&nbsp;Budweiser brewery tour (you'll have to wait for pictures).&nbsp; After sampling some fresh Michelob Amber Boch and Natty Lite and purchasing a new Bud Light church&nbsp;key for my boy,&nbsp;we took off&nbsp;for the Arch.&nbsp; I saw the Mississippi and walked through the Gateway to the West!&nbsp; Fun times.&nbsp; Then we went to dinner at a restaurant in the Landing (near the Arch) and then back to Mikes and Mikes to watch the second half of the Big Lebowski.&nbsp; Afterwards, we went home and prepared to be up at 5 for my 6 am flight.    Sunday, July 18 , upon arriving at the airport, I discovered that my flight actually wasn't until 6pm, but changed it without a problem, as I didn't want to arrive back in Boston at midnight.&nbsp; The flights home were quick and easy.   To sum up:  I miss Pat and Danielle!  Missouri rocks.   Since Missouri, I've been mostly preparing to move and catching up at work.&nbsp; This past weekend was OK: &nbsp;La Anita came to visit on Friday, which was awesome!&nbsp; We drove by the new apartment and had dinner at Nick's Place and played Golden Tee.&nbsp;   Saturday I went out for my birthday with Shawn, Erin, Molly, Phil, Jennine, and Sirena to Studio 58 and the Half Door (which is a great bar).&nbsp; While there (58), I was apparently being semi-stalked by an increasingly creepy NJ (quit being creepy!), but since I had no idea at the time, I had fun.&nbsp; I was sad that Laurie (and everyone else from Braintree) couldn't make it, especially when I heard about the crew who went out on Friday, but whatever.&nbsp; Everyone's coming to Six Flags right?&nbsp; Seriously, bring your family, friends, everyone.&nbsp; Tell people you don't even know.&nbsp; It's going to be a blast.&nbsp; Back to Saturday--I got a phone call from Miss Mylett while I happened to be outside, and she says she's coming home August 10th and will be in attendance at Six Flags on the 14th.&nbsp;   Sunday Shawn and I took the long way around to get to Lowell for the  urlLink Lowell Folk Music Festival &nbsp;and to see Kate.&nbsp; I got a sausage and got to see my roomie, so what could be better?   I am so hungry...

       Quickie:  I am at work until noon-thirty tying up some loose ends before we leave for Missouri this afternoon.  Yesssss.  I'm very excited to be seeing my brother and Danielle.  I'm also very glad to be getting a week off of work.  I'm getting back on Sunday and then on Tuesday, Denise is officially scheduled to be out of Erin and I's apartment and we ca start moving in.  I'm practically moved--maybe we'll be in in time for my 23rd...  Ugh, rent.  It's about time to go, but look forward to a big update when I get back.  Take care, everybody...   Namaste.

       ...to move down the big picture so my info wouldn't be at the bottom of the page (forget it).  A few tidbits:  According to Miss Tina, it seems  urlLink FuckYoga  should hire me as an official promoter, since my promotion here is working.  ;)  Coolness.  Looking at the site again today I was wondering how much Kimmy would appreciate it if I unrolled a mat that said FuckYoga on it during class... dunno.  While I appreciate the sentiment, I don't know how many people are going to be practicing yoga  while  they're cursing it... ^_^  Today my sweetie came and took me to lunch at Panera (or, as my mom's mistakenly called it, Pantera) and the cucumber sauce (ahem!) on my sandwich seems to have disagreed with me, as I'm feeling a little under the weather.  Oh well... luckily I got an awesome, gigantic purple straw in my delicious IC Caramel.  Literally, the thing is at least 3/4" across.  I'll save it for always, for it is awesome.  Sadly, Nosmo King has sucessfully affected a coup here in the Commonwealth.  As of Monday, July 5th, we've become an apparently fascist state.  Seriously, what the f.  I knew it was coming, but to sit in the China last night looking around for an ashtray before remembering the sad and oppressive truth was heartbreaking... also, I can't play Golden Tee without a butt!  I mean, I understand some people don't appreciate secondhand smoke an all that--even I don't like secondhand smoke--but you're at a bar, for crying out loud!  Ugh, I don't know.  It just seems a little... wrong to me.  **Sigh**, I've lots of work to do and only a couple of hours in which to do it, so ttfn.  I'm planning an on-the-quiet-side weekend, but if anyone's got something cool going on,  "Just call me... You can't get me, call over my mama's house, they know how to page me. They'll page me to yo' number then I'll call you back, or you could just page my cousin Keith and he'll call my cousin lil' Darrell who got my real pager number and then I'll you back--on his cell phone. He He."  Know who said that?  Peace and ruv, ya'll.

Speaking of pictures, Pat's company has posted pictures of their training and I  think  that might be him pointing:&nbsp;     hmmm, actually, looking again, maybe not. But go  urlLink here  to see more pictures of his company.

          Well, I returned to yoga last night (alone) and had a wonderful time.  Since I'm not very sore this morning, I suspect I didn't exhert myself as I might have but blahhh.  Kim was wonderful and imaginative as always--we always do something different with her.  For instance, last night we started working on locust (salabhasana), the simple version of which is above ^ and which ends up like so:     Hehehe, right?  Well, last night we didn't get anywhere near the advanced salabhasana, or even the beginner's pose, but it was nice to try something different.  Also, Kim said that my shoulderstand (salamba sarvangasana) was beautiful.  I'll tell you, it's extremely difficult to accept a compliment while you're in this position:     and covered in and dripping sweat as well.  I just sort of flexed my toes at her in appreciation.  :)  Anyway, there were only about 5 or 6 people in class, so that made for a) a bit of a cooler room and b) less pressure... I didn't feel like there were people on top of me while I was practicing.  Kim suggested that we do the first few sun salutations with our eyes closed, and that was a lot easier to do without so many people around, and it was a really interesting thing to do.  I found it a lot easier to bind breath to movement with my eyes closed, for whatever reason.  Anyway, practice was loverly.  As Kev-O said this morning, "Five days 'til I go on a plane!"  Really, I'm so excited that the boys are excited about going to Missouri.  Those kids aren't amazed about anything, you know?  I'm all, "I'm mooooving, wooo!" and they don't care.  "I'm a bartender!" they don't care.  It's very difficult to impress them.  And I try, trust me.  Now I'm disappointed that they're actually going to be all excited and child-like and I'm not sitting with them on the plane!  Booooo!  Oh well.  My mom's 49th birthday is on Sunday!  I don't know what I'm going to get her.  I hate that her birthday and Mother's Day are so close together, yo.  I just got her a cool pair of earrings for Mother's Day and I don't know what else she might like.  Ideas?  Not sure what I'm going to do about getting a bartending job.  My dad was sort of negative about the whole thing the other night.  "I don't know if I'd want to get into anything where I didn't know what they were going to pay me."  Shoosh.  I know what they're going to pay me.  $2.65 an hour!  Damn straight.  Giomatti in Braintree is looking for a bartender, and I'm tempted to apply, because I don't want to wait until August to get a job... but I don't want to commute on the weekends.  Maybe I could work someplace near here a few days a week after work, and then someplace down 95 on the weekends?  I don't know.  I'm anxious to get working because I don't want to forget how to pour drinks, but I have so much other stuff to tend to between now and then: Mom's birthday, seeing Pat, seeing Danielle, Denise moving out and going in to get measurements and stuff of mi dormitorio, finding a washing machine and dryer, cleaning up and out my room at my parents' house, my birthday, and moving out/in.  I'd like to be able to start making extra money as SAP, but I just don't think it'll fit in my schedule!  I've got to go do some actual work.

        Always do right. That will gratify some of the people and astonish the rest.  When in doubt, tell the truth.  Man is the only animal that blushes. Or needs to. ~ Following the Equator   It is better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open it and remove all doubt.  The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them.  Adam was but human--this explains it all. He did not want the apple for the apple's sake; he wanted it only because it was forbidden. ~ Pudd'nhead Wilson   "You perceive, now, that these things are all impossible except in a dream. You perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities, the silly creations of an imagination that is not conscious of its freaks--in a word, that they are a dream, and you the maker of it. The dream-marks are all present; you should have recognized them earlier.  "It is true, that which I have revealed to you; there is no God, no universe, no human have revealed to you; there is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dream--a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought--a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!"  He vanished, and left me appalled; for I knew, and realized, that all he had said was true. ~Last Lines,  The Mysterious Stranger

       First off, thank you Harry Manback for the tip on downloads.com.  To date, my new pop-up blocker has intercepted 37 unwanted ads!  (Yes, it keeps count.)  I loooove it.  Second off, my coffee tastes funny.  I've spent the morning shopping drawer pulls on eBay and trying to hide my poofy eyes from co-workers.  Last night when I went to bed at around 11, I made the mistake of bringing  The Notebook  by Nicholas Sparks with me, and I spent the next four hours tearing through the love story of Noah and Allie, sobbing uncontrollably (sp? I never like the look of that word) the whole time.  I really wanted to see the movie,  but now I don't know if I can handle it--this is the girl who embarassed Shawn at Spiderman 2 because I cried the whole time, and Nicholas Sparks movies you're supposed to cry at.  Oh God.  I'm afraid to read  The Guardian , which my mother brought home from my grandmother's the other day as well.  Ppsssh.  I'm such a dork.    My mother and father went to my father's mother's house last night to give her her birthday present.  My dad's been working at the police officer's hall--not sure where specifically, but it doesn't matter--and his partner's brother noticed a photograph on one of the walls in the building and showed it to my father.  It's a class picture of the Boston Police Academy Class of 1956, and my dad's dad, John Lydon, is in it.  The police let my dad borrow the picture and my mother copied and reframed the class picture and list for my grandmother.  It's really an awesome thing to have.  I knew, of course, that my grandfather was a Boston cop and I've seen his badge and stuff at my grandmother's house, but the photo is something that no one would really have or even know about, and I think my grandmother probably really liked it.  I was talking to Steven last night about how my dad called my nana before they went to bring the photograph over, and he said, "Annabelle, I got you something great for your birthday.  You're going to love it."  We were thinking the same thing, but Steve said it: "She probably thought he got her a pair of socks."  Because that's so like him.  Maybe you have to know him to get the irony, but the fact that he actually DID get her something great, and that HE was excited about--it's just funny.  Anyway, I hope we keep a copy of the photo as well.  It's a really, really great thing to have around the house and in the family.  Back to the weekend--Dan Yell visited!  Well first, Shawn and I took our bartending test on Friday.  Shawn passed with flying colors--besides overpouring a martini, he was perfect--while I only passed by 2.5 points (on the bar exam, I did much better on the written).  What??  I pulled the hardest card in the whole DECK, yo.  For the test, you have to make ten drinks, and you pull a pre-written card to see which ten, ok?  I don't know if I can remember all mine, but let's see:  Keoke coffee, Banshee, Butterball, Cuba Libre, Hollywood, Cosmopolitan, Manhattan, Strawberry Sombrero... not sure if I can remember the last two, but maybe a Midori Sour?  And something with Scotch?  And, I'm sorry, but those are like  the hardest  drinks.  Keoke coffee is the most complicated coffee, Cuba Libre!? (as Shawn would say) is an asshole way of saying rum and coke with a lime, Hollywood is practically a Grape Crush and I f-ed it up by putting soda water in it, order a Cosmo from me and die, I blanked on the Butterball shot, and guessed (correctly) on the Strawberry Sombrero (I was tempted to put in coffee brandy AND strawberry liqueur but went with just the strawberry.  Waa, waa, right?  I don't feel too bad about it because I know practical experience will make me better, especially since I do know a lot of drinks and think I'm OK at freepouring and shake-a-shake-a-shaking (kidding--you can't be bad at shaking--OR CAN YOU?), but I guess f-ing up so badly sort of shook my confidence.  I mean, we know I'm not likeable, so the only way I could be a decent bartender is to be a master mixologist!  :D  Luckily, got me a computer game to help:  urlLink BarSim .  Pretty freaking awesome, can't do it at work though cause it's a full screener.  ANYWAY, then Friday night we went--where else--to Tequila Rain to party with the St. Lunatic.  Kellie came, and Courtney and Laurie with Jeff and friends.  I was absolutely whipped, I spent most of the night drinking an evil Hollywood (and--YUCK) and chit-chatting with my boy.  I split kinda early, which I felt bad about, but I was really tired after two weeks of 14+ hour days.  Saturday Shawn and I had dinner and saw Spiderman 2 (yesssss) while Dani was visiting with Kellie etc. in Plymouth.  Sunday I went to the Gates' for a late lunch of steamers, lobster, and steak, which was delicious, even though I am still a bit wary of Uncle Alan--I know he hasn't forgiven me for the Amandalyn incident, though it's now, what, eight years later?  Hehe.  It doesn't help that Danielle's parents rub it in all the time.  Anyway, besides worrying about Uncle Alan, dinner was delicious and it was nice to see the Gates', I hadn't seen them since the Thanksgiving game.  It was also nice because Danielle and I had a chance to just sit and chill--there were little things that we hadn't gotten to talk about in a long, long time, and I finally got to catch up with the Beth and Clint stories.  Danielle, is Clint's last name Buchannon?  Like on One Life To Live?  After dinner Gates and I drove by Erin and I's apartment (Me: "Um, usually all these sketchy people aren't setting things on fire on my street.") and then met Shawn for Golden Tee at the China.  I had a delicious Alabama Slammer (really good), and let Shawn beat me at Golden Tee.  I felt bad!  He was sick!  ;)  Monday was a glorious vacation day, even though it rained the whole time.  I slept til one and then ordered a pizza and watched Office Space and Primal Fear with the best guy I know.  Last night I watched Secret Window with my mommy and then cried myself to sleep over  The Notebook .  Tonight I am returning to POWER YOGA.  It's been quite a while since I went last and I miss it.  I also miss the 8 pounds that I've regained in the past few weeks... well, actually, I reverse-miss them... but I'm not going to explain that.  I've got to recommit to my healthy lifestyle, yo.  No more extra cheese on my breakfast sandwich!!  OK, OK, no more breakfast sandwich.  Special K Red Berries, mmmmm.  No more pizza for lunch... I'm thinking about going to the WW meeting here on Wednesdays, but I am not going today.  I would feel bad missing meetings with Laurie Beth and Michelle, but going here during lunch would help me a) make it to Thursday softball games on time and b) control lunch cravings.  Well, on Wednesdays, anyway.  It's so muggy out... my hair never dries and it's making my scalp itchy.  Sorry, gross, but it's true.  I feel like my head is all wrinkled like your fingers in the tub.  Oh, I've been meaning to mention that Tina works for  urlLink FuckYoga  in NYC!  How awesome is that?  Not only does her boss have a baby announcement from Gwyneth Paltrow in the office, which.  is.  cool.  But Tina seems to have an uncanny connection to  urlLink Smith Jerrod : he walks down the street, she runs into him; he wears a Fuck Yoga teeshirt, Tina gets a job with them?  It's fate.  :)  Anyway, check out the website and buy a teeshirt.  Because they are cool.  Though I can't wear one, my mother would kill me.  My mother would not kill me for wearing one of these tee shirts though:  urlLink SoxTease !  Now, those are cool.  My personal fave is "I'd do porn with Mark Bellhorn," but if I was buying one, I might go with "I'm a wreck for Tek," "I'm kookey for Youkey," or "I'd go wicked fah with Nomah."  They're really cute tees, they remind me of the "Mrs. Timberlake," tanks that are sorta still in stores now, except they are cool.  Buy one, because I think it's mad cool that these girls are doing this.  Oh, to have an idea and make money off of it.  L.A.C.E.D., don't think I've forgotten you, but I long for something simpler and cooler.  I'll be thinking.  I hate cell phones.  They DON'T work!  If you're cell phone doesn't work GREAT 100% of the time, do us recruiters a favor and don't put the number on your resume, alright?  I can't tell you how much time we spend trying to understand/calling back people who give us their cell phone numbers as contact numbers, and that's just bullshit.  Why would you try to have an important, professional conversation with someone on a phone that may or may hang up on them, and will certainly, at one point or the other, frustrate them?  Just get a fucking landline and be at home when we say we're going to call you.  Sheesh.  And speaking of cell phones,  urlLink oh Nextel , how I envy you.  How simple the beep beep, how glorious the service, how pretty the new phone.  But it will be ok.  Hopefully I'll have service in the new apartment, and then by the time my plan is up there will be an even cooler, newer phone for me to buy!!!  Yippee!  Not much to do at work today, so maybe I'll think of something else to write.  Such as, my leg is itchy and my head is cold.  Suck on that!

       **Does anyone know of some good pop-up blocker shareware?  I use this player to listen to  urlLink Live365 , which I love, but the pop-ups are completely redick.  When I used to work at SSgA (for two glorious weeks), they had awesome pop-up blockers, but I forget the name and I doubt it was free, anyway.  Regardless, suggestions?**  It is  FREEZING  in my office.  Brrrr.  Well, it's been a while since I've actually been able to write anything, so I'm going to try to get some good stuff down.  One biggie is that for the past two weeks, Shawn and I have been taking a bartending class in Brockton.  We are pretty awesome bartenders, yo.  It's been a long two weeks--class was Monday through Friday 7-10--but class was really, really fun.  Especially working with Shawn.  Baby, you're the best!  ;)  Anyway, our test is tonight, and I'm way nervous.  There's a written test and a practical test, and I'm not Very Worried about the actual drink-pouring, but I'm a Little Worried about the written test.  I haven't had a chance to study any of our vocab words, and I memorized the liquors last week but now I forget them.  It will be fine, Shawn somehow convinced all the teachers that we know what we're doing--they think he's cute, but that's half the battle with bartending, if you ask me: being cute.  :)  Last Saturday, Shawn and I drove to the Cape to visit La Anita, which was quite lovely.  We went book shopping and driving and then had a nice dinner at the Yarmouth House and drinks at--where else?--Molly's and Christopher's.  I got to see Jon and Chris Daly and Robbie, though I was a little bummed that Dave Nader got cut at Christopher's before we got there.  :(  I'll never see little Davey again.  Though I blame him entirely, since he didn't call me back last time I was there... Hey, I forgot that Dave Nader told Kelly I was a bitch last time I saw him.  Whatever, bitch was distracting Chris Daly so you could do Kelly, slut.  Not Distracting!!  You know what I mean.  Talking.   Anyway .  I missed my grandpa twice--we drove by the house on Saturday and Sunday before we left, but it's ok because he's coming to MO with us to see Pat on the 12th.  Most importantly, tonight my best guy is going to meet my best grrl!  Danielle and I have not seen each other since  before Christmas  and... I can't wait.  Homegirl arrived last night and was not able to make it to the China for drinks (drinks=electric blue kamikaze shots), but it's cool.  It had been more than 6 months since I have seen Dan Yell, people.  Remember how it used to be?  And now it's been 6 months.  Ya'll might want to stand back.  Luckily, we're not taking the same car out tonight so there won't be any rapping, but there'll be plenty of dancing and singing and drinking.  Just like in the olden days.  Awww.  Dani!  Twenty-nine days til The Move, and I'm very excited.  I've started planning my room, and it's going to be fabulous.  Well, I don't think my furniture's going to fit, or my clothes, but durn if it isn't going to look pretty.  I want a recliner.  There's an AWESOME one on  urlLink Bob's Discount Furniture website  that I might just have to put on lay-a-way.  =P  Actually, I doubt a recliner is going to fit in that room but I totally want one.  For my kitten to sit on.  Meow.  Anyway, Tequila Rain tonight if anyone's interested.  They're advertising Amsterjam, but we know the real main event is Daniellapolooza!!   "Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel  I believe in a thing called love  Just listen to the rhythm of my heart..."  ~The Darkness

       I've moved!  As of Saturday, Erin and I officially became Norwood residents.  Well, Erin already was, but whatever.  Our apartment is adorable and fun and easy to get to, and you should come visit.  The only thing that sucks is that my commute to work is significantly longer (was 10 min, is now about 30), but it's still doable.  I do miss my mom's cooking, but there'll be plenty of that, I'm sure, as work is so close to my parents house, it's not a big deal to go over there for dinner.  The only other big news I have is that I am getting rid of my horrible old phone and switching to Nextel.  Yay!  Is that sad that that's the big news I have?  A little bit, but there's not much else exciting going on.  Six Flags is still on the 14th, and you should still come.  Or Else!
