      After four hours of working, I was sitting down in my store's little cafe, eating a slice of pizza and watching MSNBC. For the most part, it was the same old song and dance, Scott Peterson's guilty because of these reasons, Iraq is not safer, Bush is visiting this state, etc., etc., etc. Then, after a commercial break, in which several drugs were suggested for people with the unability to get an erection and people who aren't long enough below the belt to satisfy their wife, there is a debate style show, in which a woman actually claimed that John Kerry shot himself to get his Purple Heart. I highly doubt he did, but, just for shits and giggles, let's say that he DID shoot himself. That would be AWESOME. I hope they have it on film someplace. I would pay money to see him shoot himself. I can picture it now, him looking around, making sure no-one's around, and then turning the gun around on himself and firing. I'd bay $6.50 to see that stuff, right there.  Then I got thinking about the penis commercials. The Viagra commercial noted, in a high, fast voice, of course, that erections lasting longer than six hours are dangerous. Well, I would think so. That's got to be one of the least productive things ever, a boner that lasts a fourth of a day. I would find a way to take advantage of it, somehow. I'd take a walk around the neighborhood. That reminds me of something I'd like to refer to as the Swimming Pool Incident. This 70 year old man, at least, is asleep by the pool having what I will mildly call 'sweet dreams' that lasted more than an hour. This man was particularly well endowed and wearing a skimpy Speedo, and it was quite funny to see the children's reactions as they walked past. The emotions ranged from shock to amusement to horror. When the bell for rest period rang, he woke up, embarassed, and flipped over, and laid on his stomach, allowing his little friend to die down.

      I've heard many an English teacher say that 'the online lingo is corrupting children!' I can confirm that, yes, it is making horrible spellers and terrible linguists of an entire generation. But upon whom can we blame our current state of affairs? Prince. Yes, that's right. The Artist Formerly Known As Prince. Who now goes by Prince once again. Take "I Would Die 4 U" off of his Purple Rain album, for example: "U - I would die 4 u Darling if u want me 2 U - I would die 4 u 2 3 4 U  I would die 4 u I would die 4 u U - I would die 4 u U - I would die 4 u" I can only offer two possible explanations behind this. The first, maybe they were running over budget and trying to conserve money by shortening words into single letters. Or, even more likely, that Prince was trying to start a new trend. Trying to create the next ghetto-fabulous phenomenom, Prince unknowingly doomed an entire generation to near-illeteracy. His latest, and hopefully last album, however, is...lyrically dreadful, to say the least. Here's the first verse of "What Do U Want Me 2 Do?":  "Eye c U picked me out from the crowd Could it b the way Eye play guitar? Master of the soft, not 2 loud 1 day, maybe Eye will b a star Eye c U picked me out like U want something But shame on U, baby, can't U c this ring?"  Instead of I, he says 'eye'. Lengthening a word JUST to spell it wrong. Prince, whatever respect I ever had for you...is gone. Now go away and retire.

      Would you could you in a box? I think we ALL know what Dr. Seuss is REALLY talking about, and it surely isn't green eggs and ham, unless that's a new term for an old dance, in which case, you were ONE kinky man, Dr.(what-the-hell is he a doctor in?) Seuss. Well, since we all know what he's talking about, I'll decide.  "Would you, could you here or there?" Well, it depends where here and there are, but sure, I'd screw here and there. "Would you, could you in a house?" Um, yes. Isn't that where most sexual encounters take place? "Would you, could you with a mouse?" I wouldn't and highly doubt I could. You're a filthy man, Dr. Seuss. "Would you, could you in a box?" Dependent upon the size of the box, yes I would. "Would you, could you with a fox?" That's a trick question. If you're talking about an actual fox, then no...well, put me down for a maybe. But if it's a 'fox' fox, such as Anna Kournikova, then definitely. "Would you, could you in a car?" The trunk? No. The back seat? I'd give it a shot. "Would you, could you in a tree?" I don't really know how that'd work. That's probably illegal in so many ways, and plus, I don't want a branch up my ass and leaves in my face when I'm trying to get my freak on. "Would you, could you in a train?" Who wouldn't? "Would you, could you in the dark?" Yes, Dr. Seuss, I don't know how you did it. Wait...we talking pitch black? In that case, no. I can hear it now: "Ouch! That's my eye, retard!" "Would you, could you in the rain?" Yes, I'd save the few dollars on KY jelly AND get to be naked in public. "Would you, could you with a goat?" Dr. Seuss, are you a zoophiliac? What's up with all these animals? I'm not saying I wouldn't, because if the right goat came along... "Would you, could you in a boat?" Probably not. I'd get motion sickness and throw up all over. We done? Yeah, I think we are.
