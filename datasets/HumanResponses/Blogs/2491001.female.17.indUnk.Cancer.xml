      I just got back from my uncle joe's wedding at the courthouse. i am NEVER getting married at a courthouse, and you can quote me on that! I cried like three times, and not because i was happy.  it was because im mad at my uncle for divorcing y.j and marrying becky.  shes been married 3 times before joe and has 2 grown kids. I dont think it will last, neither does anyone else except for joe.  I just really miss y.j.  Atticus seems to be doing really well but everytime i see him i think of her and i get sad.  theres nothing i can do though. enough sad stuff, its CHRISTMAS! well not yet...Im listening to the Nsync Christmas cd! its my favorite cd ever! i could listen to it 24/7, even when its not christmas time or winter!  Last night me and the girls (britt and rach) went to the basketball game. we played salem, and killed em! 108- 73 or somethin, isnt that awesome!!!?? we have a really good team. last year i thought we were gonna suck this year cuz we lost alot of good people like brandon murphy, quinton combs, ryan shick, pat buchar....but we're really good! and nick kept callin me and it was really loud so i had to leave and go into the hallway to talk to him. he told me that they were thinkin about not coming down after all. cuz they wanted to come down Jan 1-2, but thats kinda weird since its new years so we suggested december 29-30, thats a monday and tuesday but narcis says he cant ask off work or somethin, i dunno! im not sure if they are or not.  i called nick after i got home to see what the verdict was but he didnt answer so i went to bed. I really want them to come down, me and mike are doing great and im happy with mike. i love him so much. i havent seen him alot this week cuz he's been workin so he can get lots of money for my christmas present (yay) and ive been busy with like school and family stuff. when i do see him its great though. i miss him.  hes so awesome. sigh........enough mushy stuff!!! anyways, about nick, im just glad to have a friend like him..hes really sweet and a great listener when u have problems. hes always willing to help me and i appreciate that! thats all me and nick will ever be, i dont want anything more. i have mike and i love him. i wouldnt trade our relationship for anything. well i should call mike...talk to u later...

      Tis the season to be jolly, fa la la la la la la la laaa!  Its almost christmas! im so excited! todays been a pretty good day. School is fun because of "Christmas spirit week' and overall everyone is just alot happier! Last night i went to the Christmas variety show at school cuz my rachel baby was singin Have yourself a merry little christmas. she did soo good! i was almost in tears cuz im so proud of her. shes so talented and im so glad she realizes she has talent. Aside from bein an PHENOMINAL belly dancer (lol), she has an awesome voice.  thats why she is going to sing at my wedding! i love her. after the show me, rach, and britt went to DQ and i got hot fudge and caramel all over my nice khaki pants and it looked like i shat myself! we saw kyle mccollum and megan there. and then rachel called narcis and nick and we talked for awhile. then i went home and got online and talked to some people (heehee). Today in spanish mr mann said he was feelin lazy so i offered to teach the class and he let me! lol we just went over our workbook assignment though. and i got participation points! wooo. and in adult living we went to Jefferson cuz once a month our class goes over to help teach the L.D. kindergarten classes. and my little buddy is Lisa Ford, shes sooo sweet! every time we go over there she more and more excited. she used to be really shy but we've been over there like 3 or 4 times already and shes really talkative and sweet. she always holds my hand and sits in my lap.  I definitely want to be a teacher. its so awesome! and yes britt, im aware they make "$15,000" a year, and compared to a pediatrist "$150,000" its nothin, but at least ill be happy! I just think teaching is such an awesome career though. i love kids.  Today rachel told me i'd be a really good teacher.....that made me really happy and i felt good about myself.  In P.e. we had these people come in and talk about dating violence and sexual assault and stuff...today we had this lady talk about dating violence, she had spoken in my Adult living class before so i knew her..and Luke was being obnoxious. i used to like him, as a friend, but now hes so annoying and stupid. i guess hes always been like that but ive never notices. hes ok. i have so much to talk about but i dont know what i should talk about.  Narcis said they are coming down january 1 and 2...that seems kinda odd considering its new years..stephen isnt too keen on the idea of them coming down. he wants to protect rachel and stuff, and i can understand that, but he wasnt in chicago to protect her and she did just fine...and this time we'll be in our own element and we'll know where everything is and who alot of people are.  Mike says he doesnt want to meet them, but i kinda want him to so i can show them "Hey look, i really do have a boyfriend and he'll kick your butt if u touch me!" i think mike doesnt wanna meet them cuz he thinks he'll feel out of place, which is cool and all. i just want him to meet them, they dont have to be like best friends.  and surprisingly he's cool with me hangin out with him, well hes not like "hey yea go out and party with them, do whatever u want" but he said if i want to hang out with them i can go ahead.  i like having that kind of freedom to do what i want. i'll feel bad leaving him for narcis and nick, well not actually LEAVING like BREAKIN UP, but leavin to go hang out with other guys. hes more than welcome to come, i want him to, but its his choice. if I were him i would want to meet them and be there all the time! lol..i trust him but i would wanna know what they were doin, ya know? i prolly sound like an evil-controlling-jealous girlfriend, but thats how i feel...!

      How ya'll doin?  "Get grandma! get!" Friday me and rach went to britt's house and watched some of Chicago. its a cool movie and i think id like it more if i actually paid attention to it! we called narcis and nick and narcis was at church! haha and then we got online and travis was online and went to see him before he went to jail. we were standing outside talking and stuff and the people across the street are drug dealers! and the one guy that lived there came outside and was yellin at this one guy and he was like "dont fucking play games with me Michael! you piece of shit!" it was sooo scary! and then "michael" left and the neighbor guy came out and he was like sorry u guys had to hear that. im a bi-polar son of a bitch!  we were like "uhh...haha....ha" and rachel had to be home at 10:30 and me and britt talked to travis a lil bit more about what jail is like and stuff..lol. and then britt took me home cuz i was really cold!! last night i had to babysit for my brother. we were gonna go see the Haunted Mansion but it snowed really bad and my mom said there were alot of wrecks on 16 and she didnt want me to go. so mike came over and we watched star wars. not all of them, just last one of the old ones....if that makes any sense......I just got back from church. the kids put on a christmas service and it was really cute! and then the congregation ate lunch together and marks mom and dad came down from Royal, Illinois and watched the service cuz matthew was in it. and my family ate with kyles and miles' families. it was fun. now im at my dads house. Later today i have to go to my great aunt Betty's house for christmas thing with all my family. that should be lots of fun...not really. i really dont like bein around my entire family that much anymore cuz all my uncles have gotten divorced and they have new girlfriends/fiances.  My uncle joe used to be married to Y.J., shes from korea and shes sooo awesome, they had a little boy together named Atticus and hes adorable. well they got divorced about a year ago cuz my uncle was cheating on y.j. with some Becky chick that he works with. that hit me pretty hard cuz i grew up with y.j. and she was my favorite aunt. and my grandma told me that y.j. was thinkin about goin back to Korea cuz she has no reason to stay in America anymore and that made me really mad at Joe. and just this past week my mom told me that joe and becky are getting married Dec. 20 at the courthouse. i asked if i had to go and she said yes. cuz im really not ready to open up to a new aunt. i feel bad cuz im not willing to be friendly and get to know becky cuz im still hoping joe will realize what a big mistake he made. i just dont like becky, nothing personal to her...maybe once i realize y.j. isnt coming back then i can work toward getting to know becky. thats just one uncle! my other uncle jack married allison, i call her al, and i also grew up with her. but he was also cheatin on her with a girl he works with and they got divorced. my uncle jack has cheated on allison so many times before Carla (his new/current girlfriend) and allison just got sick of it.  the sad thing is is that allison has been more of an aunt that jack has been an uncle. allsion helped raise me and ive never had an actual conversation with jack. its really pathetic. but i still see allison now and then, way more often than i see Jack, and hes my real uncle! hes a jerk. that about it on my family problems for now...soo yea. im tired of typing now..bye

      Hey! guess what! this is my blog and i've never had one before.  But my friend, Rachel Anne Leddy, has one and shes awesome so i wanted to be like her! *Rach, congrats on making that lady in Chicago! i love ya!* Hopefully I'll use this and continue to use it more than a few months....maybe if alot of people read this then i can become a famous writer or somethin thatd be cool.. i wanna tell you about whats been goin on in my life....i have an awesome boyfriend named Mike. we've been together for 2 years and 3 months (this sunday). you'll prolly hear alot about him! prolly good and bad! heehee...i love him so much and i wanna marry him. My best friends are Rachel and Brittany. you'll hear alot about them too. last weekend me, britt and rachel went up to chicago for britt's 17th bday and britt met some guys up there last time she was there. so we hung out with him and had a BLAST! Hopefully they'll come down sometime during christmas break....They're Narcis (britt's "husband"), Nick, and Elvis.  They're romanian and have really cool accents! theyre awesome. we stayed at the Hilton and saw Noah Wyle from E.R. in the lobby cuz they were filming some scenes there! we got really good pics of him but we couldnt have his autograph or anything cuz he had to "reherse" for his scenes. it was sooo much fun. When we came back to Charleston it was really strange and boring....really calm and quiet. there werent any crazy cab drivers trying to kill us and there werent any gay guys holding hands and walking down the street together...narcis and them are homophobic and racist....its really pathetic.  Tonight is a girls night..we're gonna go to Britt's house and watch Chicago and call narcis, well britt's prolly going to anyways! it'll be fun! well I better go eat! more later! bye

      Hola amigos! Que pasa? Amo Espanol! its been a long time since ive added anything so im just gonna talk about whats going on in my life NOW, and not what has happened since ive last updated...I love mr mann! like agnes said "If i was a little older, i would want to marry him." hes such a nice guy and hes really smart too.. he's really mean to me but he really does like me, hes told me! lol. its really weird cuz i talk to him about anything and everything and i dont feel weird that hes a teacher. whoever he marries will be very lucky! its not like im in LOVE with him but hes just a really great guy. i talk as if i have a thing for him or somethin, but trust me, i dont! haaha!   Im kinda fed up with brittany right now. all she ever does is talk about nick and narcis when im trying to forget i ever met those children! well not so much narcis, but i cant think about narcis without thinkin about nick, so im goin to TRY to stop all together.  brad asked britt to go to a movie w/ him something, i think with like kyle and megan too. britt said she'd go but in algebra shes like WHAT should i ever DO? its like Oh please, get over yourself! ya know? maybe he doesnt LIKE you....and she wants to tell him that she wants to "just be friends".....she thinks shes too good for him..she needs someone like  nick  or  narcis  or even  elvis !!! Nick feeds her soo much crap about ME and she eats it all up and it feels like she'd rather be friends with them than me and rach.   ahh rachel.....such a pretty name! lol. i love rachel. im so glad shes my best friend! shes so great. shes always willin to listen and help me. shes a really great person, just like Jay Mann! haha.... *she bangs, she bangs!*   ya know who else i love? my boyfriend, Michael Keith Pippin....i was thinkin about anna today..strange, huh? and i was remeberin how shitty she would make me feel for going out with mike. she told me I didnt love him...what kind of friend says that to her best friend? obviously not a very good one. i havent talked to anna since last year.  Lord only know what kind of stuff she tells everyone about me, about how i picked my boyfriend over my "best friend"..but really she forced me to pick him. she just overwhelmed me with all of her problems that i had no time for my life anymore. mike was the only one who would listen to my problems and help me before himself!ive talked to jessi about anna and anna does the exact same thing she did to me to jessi now..i feel bad cuz she drives away her best friends and i hope she can really hang on to one someday cuz she'll need them. if she ever reads this she'll prolly threaten to beat me up, but u know what? i dont care! im such a better person now and im totally happy with my life. i hope someday she'll be happy too. i sound really bitter, and i guess i am in a way. it just sucks that i let her pull me down with her. i could never be happy because if i was i would only make her more upset. back to mike...i really love him! we've been together for 2 years and 4 months and we've never broken up or have taken a break. thats quite an accomplishment these days! i think we are finally at the point in our relationship when both of us are sure we want to be together as long as possible. he's always willing to put my needs and wants first. the best times we have together are when we are layin around, watchin tv, and just hangin out talkin and stuff. hes so sweet and im so in love!

      Whats kickin yo? not alot here. I got a fishy! Hes a male cherry barb. i wanted to name him sparkle but mike thought its too girly and wanted me to name him Jaws cuz i have a lil sign in the fishtank that says "Beware of Jaws" so his nickname is jaws (just to humor mike) and his real name is Sparkle! lol.  oh yea  finals are over! hooray! i did good on spanish, adult living, and p.e. for sure cuz those were easy. american history was kinda tricky cuz it was 200 fill in the blank questions. algebra 2 was kind of a blur...lol..i have NO idea how i did...Environment was kinda hard cuz we never did or learned anything that had to do with anything in that class. but its ok cuz i have an A in there i think....English was like 100 questions and 80 of them were T/F and 20 were Vocab. i think i did well.  Ive been enjoying my 4 day weekend. Thursday i hung out with rach and mike. rachel came over to mikes house and we watched Friends (blegh) and mike had to work so me and rach went to my house and she saw my fishy. she drew a very nice background for the tank too! thanks rachel, now Sparkle has some pretend fishy-friends!!! then me and her went to the EIU bowling alley and played pool. we saw a bunch of band ppl there too. and we saw my cousin Brad! lol....Friday i went to the game with mike. we played Paris. all their fans are real bitches!theyre really annoying and stupid. we were ahead by like 20 and then they came back but we were still ahead by 4 and they thought they were all cool and everything....so then we pulled ahead like 10 and we won.  It was really funny cuz all the like crazy fans at our school started yellin "overrated" at the paris team and fans and they got mad....and then our people yelled "just like football" its was great! Last night me and mike went to the mall and i bought rachel's bday present! and then we went to see "Along Came Polly". it was ok..i wouldnt see it again but it was kinda funny.  Debra Messing (grace from Will & Grace) was in it, i love her! Rachels in Quebec this weekend. im not sure when she gets back though, either today or tomorrow. Mr mann was her driver on their way up to Chicago, im so jealous of her! lol i love mr mann! Hey rachel, picture mr mann in playboy! BUENO! HAhaHahaHa!! i really miss rachel. shes my best friend thats a girl! lol....guess where britt is.....u guessed it! CHICAGO! i feel sorry for her though, cuz narcis and nick keep feeding her lies and she always eats them up. thats a good analogy for britt! haha.....but whatever. they arent a part of my life anymore. ive moved on, not that i was ever stuck. its just really clear to me now. they are bad people. no matter what britt thinks of them, me and rach know the truth. although we dont know them very well, i think we know them well enough to know that they are bad people and they will say anything to get you to like them. i just hope britt will realize that sometime soon, prolly not though.  i mean they could like kill me and rachel and britt would still be like "aww narcis! hes so sweet..did u see the way he shot Laura in the face..? that was so adorable!" come on britt! reality check!  Heres my 2nd semester schedule:  1. Environment- Swafford 2. American History- Doughty (sweet!) 3. Study Hall- Chapman 4. Spanish 3-mann 5. Algebra 2-Lawerence (AMEN!) 6. pe- edwards 7. english 3-hicks

      IM GETTIN A FISHY!!!!!! Last night, me, rach and stephen were all at wal-mart walkin around and stuff and we walked by the fish and i decided i really wanted one. stephen was helpful, he was kinda overwhelming but its all good. so we got my tank and gravel and all the neccessities and went to pet tropics to look at the fish. i decided i want a Barb. we went to my house and we got everything set up so i have to let the filter and everything run for at least 48 hrs before i put my fish in it. ill prolly go get a fish after school on tuesday. i hope rachel and mike can come with me! AHH i cant wait! itll be like my baby!   After school friday nick sent me a text message and it was like "why did u get off aim? i knew it! u cant take the truth. u are too embarassed. you are so fake and immature, all you cept britt.." and at first i was like whoa....what happened? and then i got pissed and i replied sayin that he had no right to tell me im fake and immature cuz i havent dont anything to make him think that....well at least to my knowledge. and we got into this big text message brawl. he was tellin my that ive been wastin my life with mike for 2 years and all this crap and i got fed up with it. so i was like u know what? im gonna be the better person and forget this ever happened..and he says "well i wouldnt consider u the better person but i like the idea" what a fag! sorry.. and u know what he has the nerve to do?? he brings BRITT into this. he told her that she needs new friends and everything...because he knows me sooo well *sarcasm!* part of me is like who cares? hes worthless, but the other part of me is kinda still upset with the whole thing. im not like crying at night but im mad i was ever in that situation and that it had to end like that....but at least its over and i didnt do anything i wouldve regretted. now i am positive Mike is the only one for me. i love him so much.  just the fact that nick told me what was wrong with my relationship with mike pissed me off!  u know how pathetic nick is? after we left chicago, he bought me $250 pair of shoes from Diesel...well thats what he said he bought me...what a loser! can he not get anyone in Chicago? i look back and it kinda makes me laugh, im so over this whole situation....it sure doesnt sound like it, does it? lol....im just expressing how i felt.  now its over and im as happy as ive ever been!  Blegh i have school tomorrow! ive been used to bein off like weeks at a time because of christmas break and everything! weekends are so short now! Finals are wednesday and thursday. the only ones im scared about are American History just cuz there is soo much stuff to remember and Algebra 2, of course. cuz its like impossible for me! lol.  im gonna go eat..im hungry

      Hey! Long time no blog! haha im funny. Its not like ive been really busy or anything, ive just been lazy. Christmas was great. i got alot of cool clothes and stuff. Mike got me a BEAUTIFUL ring! i picked it out! lol. New Years was okay, rachel and britt spent the night.  overall christmas break was alot of fun. it seemed like so long and so long ago! and its only my 2nd day back to school.....blah! Britt went up to chicago again to "see her cousin play volleyball" but everyone knows the real reason is so she could see narcis. they only hung out for like 2 hours which made her kinda sad.  Turns out nick has a girlfriend and hes "totally over me". cuz i told him i wanted to stay with mike and i didnt want to have anything with mike, at most a friendship. i think he got upset and told me he had a gf, britt asked narcis and narcis said nick didnt...but who knows? who really cares?! i dont!  i told mike everything about me and nick.  he was really cool about it, it made me happy!  we also talked about our relationship and what was wrong with it. we got it all worked out and now we're great! never been better! i love him so much!  Now that school has started i dont really have too much to talk about which is kinda sad....

      Wow! i just took Justinn's personality test on her deadjournal and its VERY VERY accurate! its really freaky cuz the test wasnt too in depth but it hit everything right on the nose, espcecially the part about placing high value on marriage, well ill let u read it!  ISFJ Ok. You are sympathetic, loyal, considerate, and conscientious. You will go to any amount of trouble, when it makes sense to you, to help those in need. You are responsible and enjoy being needed. You are down-to-earth and realistic and like others who are quiet and unassuming. You absorb and enjoy using a large number of facts.  You like situations where the rules are well defined and where traditions are to be upheld. You focus on providing practical help and services for others and for the organizations you serve. You have a strong work ethic.  You can be painstakingly accurate and systematic in handling tasks...you're conservative with traditional values...quiet and modest...tactful and supportive of friends and family...  You are often self-effacing in getting the job done, and are willing to make necessary sacrifices, especially for your family. You are at your best quietly providing assistance and making sure things are in order.  You have a few close friends, don't like disharmony, and try to keep cooperation at all costs...you'll stay close friends with that tight circle for a LONG time...worry a lot...  You need to have things organized in a way you think works.. you cannot work when things are out of order...when things are in disarray, you have to reorganize 'em immediately....you get involved with leisure ONLY after all the work is done...  You have a tendency to put off relaxing because there's too much work to be done...you enjoy time with your family...you fall in love hard when you fall. You place a high value on marriage and family...you seek out a partner and feel unfulfilled without one. you most likely are a good student because you diligently follow through in your work to please your teachers.....you learn best by DOING...  You tend not to be the center of attention...often appear serious...others like trying to get a laugh or a smile out of you...you get angry or bitter when scorned...but you keep it inside...  Possible blindspots: because you are SOOOO in the present, you have a hard time seeing possibilities or consequences of your actions...can become mired in the daily grind...don't forget to express your bottled-up feelings...you can be taken advantage of....could be pessimistic about the future because it's unknown and you rely on past experiences.....you want to plan too much.  ISFJ: "I Serve Family Joyfully"   That makes me feel really good about myself!  Last night me, rach, britt, and maja went to the mattoon-charleston basketball game. it was really good! it was sold out before jv started! the mattoon fans are crazy and trashy! thats what we decided! we kicked their butts though. it was awesome. britt's car got frosting all over it cuz she left her CHS parking pass in her window and mattoon people saw it.  some mattoon kid's truck got egged! hahaha!! thats so immature but really funny. after the game we went to see Mike at the will and guess who we saw walkin up, "stepmike"! hes a really nice guy. i like him alot, not like that though!  my mike is a really nice guy.  he's taking me to see the Passion of the Christ today. im really excited. at first i didnt really wanna see it cuz i didnt think it would be that big of a deal, but ive heard soo much stuff about how its sooo moving and shocking. people said it'll really make u think.  but anyhoo, im excited!   Rachel~~~I had so much fun last night. ur so awesome! really, you are! Congratulations on getting Minnie in the musical! i knew u could do it! im really sorry u felt sad about yourself last night after u got home. u shouldnt, cuz u r a great person and i know ur relationship with stephen is kinda shitty, but it will get better. just dont give up, if u do, ill smack u! jk! but if u keep workin for it, it'll be worth it in the end. and when u 2 get married and im ur maid of honor, u can thank me! haha! i love you rachel!    if ur ever sad or anything just CALL me! i love you!

      HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY EVERYONE! Im in a really good mood, prolly cuz its v-day. i love v-day, and i hate people who hate v-day. well i dont hate them, but like when single people are like omg vday is so stupid, blah blah,....i just wanna be like well u wouldnt hate it if u had a boyfriend/girlfriend! well maybe u would, who knows! let me tell u about my day....mike works from 1-4:30ish and then i have to go to a church thing from 5-6 and after that me and mike are goin to effingham to eat at Ryan's! im sooo excited! i love Ryan's and i love mike! its a perfect combination, eating an all you can eat buffet with AWESOME food with an AWESOME guy! i love him so much....   Last night, me and britt went to the bball game. we played Olney and won like 57-36 or something like that. and i think jason made like a half court shot. and ryan johns played in like the last 20 seconds when we were up by 10 and he rebounded the ball (britt says he stole it, but she doesnt know anything!) and tried to make a lay up but totally missed. it was funny. needless to say, he didnt make ANY points! haha, im mean.  after the game, me and britt went valentine's day shopping for mike and my parents. and we went to county market so britt could break her date with brad and i could find some Hershey's Hugs and guess what.... I FOUND SOME! Mike said they were all out at wal-mart but they had some at county market, i was so excited. after county market, we were drivin to walmart, actually i was drivin and i was tryin to open my Hugs while i was drivin, and i wasnt very successful, so britt was like oh i'll do it and she opened them but they flew all over my car....sigh...britt is such a loser....at walmart she like knocked over a little card holding thing in the card section.. OH AND I WAS A GOOD SAMARITAN (sp?) i bought like 3 things that added up to like $5 but i also but somethin that was like $15, and total was only $5.05 and i went back up to the cashier lady and told her. she was like omg thats so nice of you, thanks for bein so honest, there should be more people like u in this world, and i was like uhhh thanks?? it was weird but im glad i did it. well i better go......have a happy valentines day!  P.s- i miss u rachel! will u be my valentine??

      hey. i feel bad about my last post. i was really mean and it really wasnt neccesary. im sorry britt. i didnt mean what i said. i was just frustrated and i guess jealous in a way. nick, narcis, elvis, brad, they all like you. it shouldnt matter if they like me or not but its just the whole nick thing sucks. ive apologized to britt and she forgave me. me and rach have been treatin her like crap and she doesnt deserve it. she actually deserves so much better than me and rachel.    Last night, me, britt, brad, rachel and stephen went to see Win A Date with Tad Hamilton. i highly recommend it! lol. brad even liked it! when we were leaving show place the parking lot was like ice EVERYWHERE and rachel was ice skating around brads car and she was like LAH, come skate with me...well i kinda slid and feel flat on my face! it was sooo funny and cold! and then brad did a spinny-out thing in the parking lot and it was on purpose too! haha it was really scary. and stephen got mad at rach cuz she screamed REALLY REALLY loud! lol. i love rachel..after the movie brad dopped us off at my house and we watched tv. me, rach, and britt had a girl talk about britt's life. like her love life and family matters and such. its really interesting to talk to her about it cuz no one would ever figure britt felt how she does...i feel really bad and i want to help her but she thinks she is beyond the point of help. it really sucks. so im always gonna be there for her and i hope she knows that.

      ¡Hola todos! ¿Cómo usted es? ¡Soy muy bueno! El mañana es un medio día en la escuela porque los maestros tiene las conferencias de padre de estudiante. ¡Eso es impresionante para nosotros! Hoy era divertido, pero nada emocionante sucedió. Tengo una prueba grande en el maya en el español el viernes. Soy enfatizado acerca de eso. Pero estoy seguro será fino. estudiaremos toda clase mañana, pero eso no es muy mucho veces. ¡Ah sí! Obtuve mi vestido del baile del colegio ayer! es sin tirantes y negro con un poco blanco. Obtuve también un bolso que es perfecto para el vestido. Fui a David Nuptial en la Campiña, y en el sitio web de la tienda tengo un retrato de mi vestido y mi bolso. ..with uno al otro! ve! ellos SON un igual perfecto.. Pondré el sitio web de mi vestido en aquí tan usted puede ver cuán hermoso estará en mí. Era 200 dólares y es un tamaño dos! era tan feliz que quede en lo y en quedo verdaderamente muy bien. al principio yo traté un tamaño seis y se caía mucho. Estoy en el amor con Miguel Y Raquel! bien, debo ir ahora. ¡Véalo luego!   http://www.davidsprom.com/dresses.jsp?g=0&p=10 http://www.davidsprom.com/accessories_return.jsp?g=20&p=1  Translation for you NON-SPEAKING-SPANISH-PEOPLE  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Hello everyone! How are you? I am  very good!  Tomorrow is a half day at school because the teachers have student parent conferences.  That's awesome for us!  Today was fun, but nothing exciting happened.  I have a big test on the mayans in Spanish on Friday. I am stressed about that.  But I'm sure it'll be fine. we're going to study all class tomorrow, but that's not very much time. oh yes!  I got my prom dress yesterday! it's strapless and black with a little white.  I also got a handbag that is perfect for the dress. I went to David's Bridal in Champaign, and at the store's website it has a picture of my dress and my handbag...with each other! see! they ARE a perfect match... I'll put the website of my dress on here so you can see how beautiful it will be on me.  It was 200 dollars and it is a size two! i was so happy that i fit into it and it actually fits very well. at first i tried a size six and it was falling down alot. I am in love with Miguel y Raquel! well, i should go now.  See you later!

      well u know how i said that our new computer should be up monday or tuesday...i lied. its friday and its still not up! lol mark says this weekend cuz we're gonna get dsl and the dsl guy that we know is out of town til today so....yea hopefully tomorrow! im gonna go see 50 First dates with my mom tomorrow afternoon. i love that movie.  Today me and mike played basketball and took my dog for a walk. then we went to walmart to buy mike deoderant cuz he's a stinky boy (just playin!) and we saw Anthony Tucker. and then we went out to eat with my mom and mark at the Country Club and they had a seafood buffet thing and it was actually pretty good! i kinda like fish now...then me and mike went to see Starsky and Hutch and it sucked! well it wasnt that bad, but i just didnt understand the humor in it....well i understood it but i didnt find it funny. its definitely a guy movie. i  got really bored so i texted rachel a couple times in the middle of the movie and afterwards mike seemed mad at me. i think it was cuz i was texting rachel. whatever, he shouldnt be mad at me.  i called britt last night and she was sad cuz she hadnt hung out with narcis or nick yet. she sounded kinda mad just because she was tired of waiting and she had every right to be mad or upset. and i was tellin her that they werent worth it, but i guess after i talked to her narcis called and they did hang out after all. they still arent worth it. britt, if u read this, read this VERY carefully......Narcis and Nick are NOT worth your time, they are crappy, worthless people who can't make their own friends in chicago so they have to search for friends outside of chicago.  they will say anything to turn u against me and/or rach and they are lying sacks of ****(ya know!) im sorry if i sound mean and bitchy, but britt, u can do so much better than them. im not saying me and rach are better than them, cuz we're prolly not, cuz we're really crappy to you, but at least we're honest. you cant believe a word they say (particularly nick) so i just wanna warn you.....sorry britt. but u do what u think is right. im sure it'll work out in the end.....Congrats on your Northwestern program thingy, that should be lots of fun!  spring break is almost over...where'd it go? what did i do?? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! but i had fun doing nothing! haha! i hate school. i am so over it. im ready to graduate, go to college, become a teacher, get married, have kids, and be HAPPY! i have so much to do with my life and i dont want to be wasting it away in high school anymore! AHH! i have "senioritis" and im not even a senior yet. sure, i will miss everyone (well not everyone, but alot of people) when we all go off to college and what not, but ill get over it! as long as i keep in touch with my close friends now then i will be totally fine! college will be great, i cant wait! (i rhymed!)     Word to your mother!

      Guess what! yesterday me, rachel, stephen, and britt went to see 13 going on 30. i was talking to will about how showplace is hiring people and he was like do u want an application? and i was like sure....so after messing up 2 different ones, i finally finished filling it out and turned it in. we were talking to bob, will, and kenny for a lil bit and kenny kept telling me that there was no way id get hired so i kinda forgot about it. well my mom called me and was like "Julie from show place called to set up an interview" i called her back and i have an INTERVIEW AT 7 PM TOMORROW!!!! AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! i might have a job. im trying not to get too excited cuz i might not get it. im expecting NOT to get it. i dont think mike realy likes the idea. hesok with it, but he said its really dramatic over there and i shouldnt get caught up in all of it. but i was like hey, im a 16 year old girl, i think i can handle it! lol. and then mike was being rude and talking about how im getting hired because they can get away with paying me below minimum wage because im young or something. it made me feel crappy. and i was like "so ur saying thats the only reason theyre hiring me?" and he was like "no....thats not the only reason" i was like o gee, thanks! lol. im excited though. im kinda nervous, but ill get really nervous when im driving out there. i wanna bring someone with me! lol. my mommy let me get a new outfit and i look very professional! haha. today is my daddys bday so me and mike got him a card after school. then we all went out to Paglia's. it was fun. so yeah....thats the scoop! later

      HOLA AMIGOS!! speaking of speaking spanish (haha) me, rach, and stephen went to qq buffet for dinner and we saw mr mann, his mom, his brother, and his sister.  Ive met like all of his family except for his dad and i met his mom and his brother at mcdonalds like a week ago! CRAZY! his lil sister was really cute and she shook our hands. shes only in 8th grade. i STILL dont shake peoples hands when i meet them, unless they go for it first.  Today i went to see Home on the Range with mike. my mom, matt, and matts friend went too, although we went seperately. it was kinda funny. i wouldnt see it again though. my mom really enjoyed it though! haha. then we hung out with rach and stephen and watched Donnie Darko.....oh my! it was different. but i suppose it was a good movie! it was really weird though. and just cuz i thought it was weird doesnt mean im a bad person, stephen!!! mike had to go to work and so me, rach, and stephen all hung out. we went to maurices and i really wanted to buy money but i need to save some for mikes bday present.  Rachel owes me like $3!!!!!!! i expect that payment in CASH rachel anne leddy!  we drove around for awhile and saw a bunch of random peoples *cough* mr doughty *cough* houses. and i found out that a specific teacher of mine has a LIBRARY in their house! How AWESOME is THAT?????? lol. rachel thought it was really cool too! ;-)  so yeah...tomorrow i have to go to church, and i might go see 13 going on 30 with britt. she asked me to go tonight but i couldnt. i really wanna see that movie and i feel bad not going with her tonight. but hopefully we can go tomorrow. well im tired so gnight!!!!

      Hola! its a 4 day weekend again! im so happy! its like spring break all over again...well kind of. its definitely nicer outside than it was over spring break! yesterday was an ok day.  I had a meeting with mrs clark in the preschool room at 10:15 and mr doughty let me go 5 minutes early so i wouldnt be late. hes so nice. i love him...anyways!!mrs clark asked me why i wanted to work with her children (which sounded really funny) and i said that every child is different and its just really fun to hear how they see things because their point of views are totally different than ours (as in adults/older people!) and then she asked why i didnt like kids and i said cuz sometimes they dont listen and its really hard to get some of them to concentrate and complete things..she seemed to approve. then she told me about all the things they did with the kids. im gonna get a preschool buddy! and i get to make a lesson plan! im really excited! and then mrs clark asked what i wanna do after high school. i told her i would prolly go to eiu and major in early childhood education. she told me this would be a great experience for me. she also told me i could come in 2nd or 3rd hour on monday, wednesday, or friday and observe. i have study hall 3rd hour so that would work out peachy! im so excited! i saw mrs clark later that day and she said hi to me. it made me really happy cuz it makes me think that she likes me! haha. and its 7th hour i got a letter saying that i was accepted! i was pretty sure i was gonna get in, but i was still totally excited! i still am!  i dont think people understand how excited i am to do this, well i think rachel understands, but i dont think mike does. hes still happy for me though. OH! and mike got me 3 red roses yesterday. just because. on the card he wrote "just cuz i love you..." AWW! hes so sweet! i brought them home and my mom just stared at me like i was stupid or something and then she was like "did u and mike get into a fight or somethin?" and i was like NO! and she just stared at me and was like "are you sure?"  i was like UM YEA! and she kept looking at me like she didnt believe me. it really pissed me off! she never believes me about somethings,like when it comes to mike. like if im in a bad mood she automatically assumes that me and mike are in a fight or something. and me and mike dont fight ALOT, when we do, we usually fix things before we leave each other. i made him make that promise after we had our first fight. and so far we've stuck to it. im really proud of that. *sigh* i love mike so much! and im sure you're tired of hearing/reading that...so my bad! i took some personality quizzes!                     Extroverted (E) 62.86% Introverted (I) 37.14%  Realistic (S) 61.76% Imaginative (N) 38.24%  Emotional (F) 69.7% Intellectual (T) 30.3%  Organized (J) 58.82% Easygoing (P) 41.18%

      Hello good friends! hows is going? its just peachy here. yesterday i played football and frisbee with mike, stephen, and rachel.  stephen bought a foam football thing that counts how many times it spins when u throw it. and since im left handed, it would go backwards when i threw it so the counter would be like 96...when really i got like a 4! i was really bad at it. whenever i threw it right handed i would keep getting a 1, and mike was like how do u only get ONE?! he was mean! and then mike and stephen were playing in the creek, acting like 12 year olds again! it was really cute cuz me and rach got to see how they played with each other when they were lil tots! before they knew us....mike had to go write his paper for english so i hung out with rach and stephen. we drove around, thats all we did, o yea and we went to county market. we talked about sierra & nicky, boys that rachel like, and britt. stephen was talkin about how nicky and sierra are like so comfortable with each other that they just like touch other...in more than friendly ways. and he didnt understand why rachel feels uncomfortable with it. hes so stupid, well not really, but with things like that he is. then we moved on to the guys that like rachel. stephen expects rachel to be really mean and rude to the guys that like her so they stop liking her, but i dont think being mean is necessary! but its totally ok for stephen to flirt with girls in champaign and not tell them about rachel right away...and then came britt. we just talked about how shes a part of out lives no matter what. and stephen didnt understand why we couldnt just let go and get over it..and then stephen brought up the fact that me and rach are like parents to britt and thats why she keeps coming back and stays friends with us. im the mother type who is like nice, and caring and just watching out for britt and rachel is the dad. the mean (sometimes), strict, but also watching out for her too. i actually think he's right on this one. good job stephen! so yea everyone is better....for now!!! MMWAHAHAHAH! jk. so now its today!  today was a typical monday. kindof a slow start but things picked up i guess. I have a test in Algebra on wednesday and maybe a test in american history on thursday. i really dont want to make them up, so it doesnt look like im goin to my great grandpa's visitation or funeral.  my grandma called last night and said that my family really doesnt have to come up to peoria if it's a big hassle. i feel bad for not going now, but i never really new him. i dont even know his first name! all i know is that he was a reverend. i sound like a really bad person, but im not! Rachel and me and britt all talked things out at lunch today. i hung out with mike after school and we watched the Cardinals loose to the Brewers. it was the day opening of the baseball season...greeeat.. its on till like October so its on like 365! well not really but it sure seems like it! me and mike had alot of fun today. he cracks me up. i love that kid.....haha i really do! then we came to my house and ate supper and played outside. we played with matt for a lil bit. o yea and i ran around my block, w/o stopping or walking! its like a 1/4 mile. i was proud. mike didnt believe that i ran the whole way, but i swear i did! he eventually believed me cuz i wouldnt let him NOT believe me.....then he went home to work some more on his paper. hes really close to being done, he has like a page left. so here i am! and here i go cuz i have to go now! LATA ALLIGATA!

      Last night I had to babysit matthew. i babysat from like 4-10. i didnt get paid though cuz my mom let me order $100 worth of clothes and stuff from Delia's for summer time. but oh well!  I hope rach isnt mad at me, cuz i told her id call her at like 8, when i THOUGHT i was gonna be done babysitting, but my parents came home at like 10. i guess i couldve called her but i was really busy with matt, he was sick and he kept wanting me to do stuff and get stuff for him...so i kinda forgot to call. Sorry Rach! i hope ur not mad at me! i love you baby! haha. today i went to sunday school and church. i told kyle that i didnt think megan liked me, but he said she does and she thinks im really nice. i dunno if hes totally telling the truth or not. o well, theres not a whole lot i can do now. our sunday school class decided to go see The Passion of the Christ tonight. i kinda wanna go but not really. ive already seen it and i dont really wanna see it again. i think it would be good for me to go though. alot of other people are going. i asked mike to come with me but he was like "ive seen it 2 times already..." i was like so..come with me and keep me company! oo mike just called me..hes coming over now. yay!! I love him. hes so sweet.

      Bonjour! yesterday was a boring day...i went to school and i cant really remember if anything happened...o yea! Catalina asked ben to prom! grr im so jealous....oh well, she just got to him before i did.....i guess  ill just have to settle with mike as my prom date. cuz if i dont rachel will take him! haha. and hes way better than who she wanted to go to prom with...HAHA!! Yesterday britt let me borrow her homecoming shoes for prom. theyre really nice and theyll go great with my dress! thanks britt... Last night mike had to work and rach had the coffee shop thing. i went to Magic Wok with my family and britt called me while i was there and she asked me to go with her.i didnt really feel like going so i said no. then we all went to walmart for like an hour cuz we kept loosing each other. I got the second season of Will and Grace on dvd. i watched disc 1 with my mom when we got home. she thought it was HILARIOUS! i love my mom. shes like my best friend now...well sort of! i have to baby sit matt tonight cuz my mom and mark are goin up to champaign with the doctor she works for cuz he's retiring. so they are all gonna go out and eat at Biagge's (however u spell it!)                 my mom told me that marks granpa died last night...he fell yesterday and broke his hip and they knew it would be a matter of time.. he was really old and they've all kinda been waiting for it to happen. not like counting down, but u know what i mean...i didnt really know him, and i wasnt close to him. he lived in peoria and i only saw him  maybe  once a year. They think that the visitation and funeral are going to be on Thursday, but not for sure. so we would leave wednesday night. my mom wants me to check if ill have anything important on thursday, like tests and stuff. if i did, she said Cindy (matt's babysitter) would come spend the night with me and the dog. i dont think i really need a babysitter but if i didnt i prolly wouldnt take care of the dog, so i guess i kinda do! lol. my mom cares more about the dog than me! jk..... so yeah. that kinda sucks. but im not too upset or anything, like i said, all my family has been kinda expecting it to happen so its better for them. wow u know whats weird? Mark's grandma died almost exactly a year ago.thats kinda strange that theyve both died about a year apart..they werent married though....marks grandma was his dads mom, and his grandpa was his moms dad. but yeah. mike is coming to get me so i should go....

      Hey! ive been online but i havent felt that anything has been important enough to blog about. Finals are tomorrow. i have american history and spanish. i studied for american history for like an hour and i think ill do ok. if i miss every single question on that final, ill get a c. so yeah, it wont be too bad. Agnes's bday party was saturday at britt's house. it was a blast! except that agnes left...twice. although i did go with her once, and that was crappy of me. we went to go get Mike Cook. i think him and agnes are gonna like hook up or somethin. they went outside cuz agnes was "hot" to talk and me and britt spyed on them. it was so much fun. i think hes kinda shady though....so agnes shouldnt go out with him, but whatever she wants to do. school is basically out now and im really excited. you dont understand how excited i am that school is out...well rachel prolly does, but shes prolly the only one! sigh....Im gonna be a senior. thats so awesome. next year will be so awesome! ill be taking spanish 4, which i love, and ill be working with lil children, which i love, and ill have my best friend rachel, which i love, and ill have my boyfriend, which i love, and ill be getting ready to get OUT OF CHS, WHICH I LOVE!!!!!!!!!!! i cant wait till college. everyone always says that they miss high school, but would never go back. and i can totally see why they say that. high school is so full of drama and is so immature. life is good. i love life. in the "new wing", the seniors wrote their life mottos on the wall, and i think mine would be "Live life to the fullest". its not very original, but its what everyone should do. wow, i sound like a Miss America contestant or something! im gonna shut up now.....anyhoo! i should go...Adios amigos!

      Prom was Saturday. it was alot of fun....although getting lost in terre haute and driving down a one way street wasnt too fun......overall it was fun!! rachel and i looked beautiful and mike and stephen looked very handsome. i danced with stephen......we had a good time talking and laughin about stuff while we were dancing. maja also looked gorgeous!  she looked so elegant...sigh....after prom was fun. we left at like 1:30 cuz i was really tired and i had to work at 11:30 the next morning. i love work. its really stressful sometimes, but so far its great! everyone is really nice...except for ken! hes a butt hole.  tomorrows friday and mike doesnt have to work so thats exciting. im really tired, and ive been tired all week. so im sorry if i dont go into detail about anything, i just dont feel like writing about EVERYTHING! i got my ACT score, it sucked. its over 20, and thats all i need, but i wanna take it again just to feel better about myself. rach got a 28 and she was crying cuz she thinks its bad. that makes me feel really shitty......shes really smart, but i dont think she realizes it. if i got a 28, i would prolly crap my pants with excitement! lol that sounds stupid...oh well im like half sleep/half wake..if u couldnt tell...........................................................BLAH! i HATE school! i HATE it with a passion! i dont think ive been so excited for a summer break as i am now. and especially with next year being my senior year. YYYAAAY! ive been ready to be a senior since sophomore year.  people are like "but i'll really miss everyone". im like HA! i cant wait to get away from the people in my school. sure ill miss alot of my acquantences (spelling? i know i spelled that wrong) like agnes, chelsea, catalina, scott...a bunch of random people but i can still keep in touch with them. i cant wait. sigh....im gonna go cuz my eyes are getting heavy!

      PROM is tomorrow! AH! im SOOO excited! I missed school all day today because i helped set up for prom. it was fun and im really glad that i did it. i painted a window and i have to say that it looked quite SUPERB! then me and rach went to the shop at school to do the grafitti paper....we did an awesome job at it....with a lil help from anthony tucker and the shop boys. me and rachel found our calling.....its to be in SHOP class! lol. last night i had my orientation thing for work from 5-9. it SUCKED! we saw on the bench in the lobby for 3 hours doing paperwork and listening to all the rules and regulations. there were 2 other people there, and the other girl was a big bitch. rachel reese almost kicked her in the face. hopefully, she wont last too long. the other person was this really strange boy, but he seemed nice. kinda like nathan macy.  I work on Sunday from 11:45-5:30 and Will trains me. so im excited!! but i have to get up early and thatll SUCK because prom is saturday night/morning. oh well, hopefully ill be excited and thatll keep me awake. im REALLY tired. i worked really hard today. Prom is going to be great. Mike got really sick today. he was cold and was shaking and his lips were blue cuz he was so cold, but it wasnt cold inside...and he had a really bad headache and he said his hands were so cold they were numb. he said that his head hurt more than his ribs did when he bruised them. i was really scared. and he had to go into work, so i drove and then he threw up in the trash can in the office while bob was trying to get ahold of someone to work for him.  he felt better after he threw up, like most people do. so he stayed at work.  i wouldnt have though. hes trying to see if kristie will take the rest of his shift so he can go home and sleep. Poor mikey. i just pray that he isnt sick tomorrow! aw i love him so much. i wish i could do more for him, but theres nothing i can do and it makes me sad!!! he's feeling a lil bit better though. i think its cuz he hadnt eatten anything all day. im glad i never have that problem! haha. so yeah prom is tomorrow and ill tell u all about it later!!!

      I really like this new blogger layout-deal thing! it makes me happy! i just got back from shopping for my uniform for WORK! i also got tennis tennis shoes. i really like them. theyre k-swiss and plain white....but they still totally rock! i wanna wear em alot but i know ill get em dirty before tennis season even starts..just like last season. but shoes are meant to be worn, right?! RIGHT!! so yea...since im an awful girlfriend, and i have to work on my boyfriends birthday...we're gonna celebrate tomorrow night, instead of Thursday. we're gonna go eat at steak n shake. i got him a gift card to Hibbit's...but SHHH dont tell him! jk it doesnt matter. he already knows about it. and i bought him the Smile Empty Soul cd. with the money he gave me to but it for him, since i was goin to mattoon anyways! so yea! Prom is in 4 days! im so excited!!!!! we're gonna go eat at the Olive Garden. i love that place....my mom called to make reservations but get this, they dont make reservations!! how gay is that?! it angered me, and it kinda freaks me out. cuz what if theyre totally packed?! oh well, we dont have to be at prom at EXACTLY 8. the line is really long anyways.  Stephen and rach broke up. we've been expecting it, it was just a matter of time. i think it is for the best for right now. later on down the road...who knows? maybe they are meant to be together. i think they are...but i dont know cuz neither one has really been serious with anyone else..so its kinda hard to say if they are made for each other. i think its best for them to see whats out there and see if its meant to be. im sure they will both end up happy, whether it be with each other or different people. and im gonna help rach make the right decisions and watch out for her...after all, i AM her best friend! haha. i would help stephen,but hes far away. so yeah. But both of them will be fine. im happy for them cuz it is semi-mutual. they both know it is time for them to be seperate.  Rach...i love you! if u need to talk, call me anytime! im here fo ya sista! GIRLPOWER!!!!!! so yea thats this week in a nutshell!

Im really sad that we didnt see Mean Girls, we couldve, but i decided to be nice and see Envy cuz mike really wanted to see it and hes already seen Mean Girls..i love lindsay lohan!.....anyways! then rach and britt came over to spend the night. we went "out" and went to county market to look at the magazines. we gossiped about movie stars and acted like total geeks! and then we went to subway which was a BLAST! and we had fun remembering good times from the Subway in chicago when i had to pee! lol. Toxic was on the radio and i dance. mike linder thought we were like drunk. i hadnt laughed that hard in a long time. then we came back to my house and watched Clueless, the best movie ever! except for Romie and michelle, and the other sister! We concluded that i am like cher, rach is like ty, and britt is kinda like dion. we went to sleep, britt had to leave early to go to bloomington. then rach left and i went to my churchs car wash.  after that me and mike hung out with rach and stephen. it was alot of fun playing frisbee. even though stephen was making fun of how i threw it! and how rachel tried to catch it! LOLOL!! we went to DQ and they have good iced tea! here i am.....i have to clean my house...i dont know WHY, my mom just informed me that i had to today..so yea. tomorrow i have church. and then at 6 im going to monicals to eat with mikes dad and family for his, mikes, and andys bday. it should be a good time. theyre really nice people! so yea...im off!!

YAY! yesterday me and mike went to champaign. we ate at Applebee's and went to Dick's to look for a tennis racket for me for my birthday. nothing really tickled my fancy and the ones that did were like $200 and i didnt want mike to spend that much. so he bought me 4 cans of tennis balls (thats 12 balls, fyi). then we went to best buy and the mall. we saw D (i dont know how to spell his name) Brown driving so i was excited. mike bought my a tommy hilfiger purse, fossil sun glasses, and something else,i think, but im having a really bad brain fart. i told u i was tired!! ill think of it later. today me and my mom went to champaign to go shopping for summer clothes and clothes for when i go to florida. i got 10 shirts, 5 shorts, a belt, a wallet, and a key chain. theyre all really cute and its really exciting. OH YEA MIKE GOT ME THE SIMS HOT DATE GAME! i remember now. whew, that was tough! and yea.....i  n e e d  s l e e p. . . im gonna go and get some....sleep, that is!

      Ive been goin to the tennis open gyms yesterday, today, and ill go again tomorrow. i cant move. I spent like the whole time yesterday serving and i cant move my shoulder. it sucks but its good for me. ive already improved. Squibb doesnt really coach too much, well compared to doug. just bein out there playin really helps me improve. after the open gym today me, lia, and agnes went to QQ buffet to eat lunch. i can tell that this season is gonna be the best one. Mainly because i get along really well with all the girls and we're actually like a team this year. i dont know what it is, but i wish doug was here to see it! mike said he'll get me a new racket for my birthday and i told him that i have a "new" racket and that im only gonna be playin for one more season and he was like well i know but whenever i get a decent racket we can play alot after the season, so im really excited!  Squibb is really awesome. hes really funny and nice...and cute! i miss doug cuz he was a good coach and squibb hasnt really proved that hes a good coach. i like him though, he seems really laid back. we always cuss and stuff and he doesnt care, he just laughs. so thats cool. i love squibb. i love tennis! My birthday is in 9 days! ill be 17! i wont have a curfew, well legally! my mom keeps askin me what i want but i really have no idea. maybe ill surf the web and see if there is anything i want. yes, thats what ill do! well i should start shoppin for ideas! lata!

      Tennis starts tomorrow! im excited! its just the open gym though. thats from 9-11:30 on tuesday, wednesday, and thursday. then i have to work tomorrow at noon. i havent decided if im gonna leave tennis early or not, i could just take my work clothes to tennis and then change at show place. eh, who knows? but more importantly, who cares? Today i hung out with mike. it was fun. we watched daddy daycare and just hung out. i had a church meeting at 3:30 about the National Youth Gathering in Orlando this july. im going and im really excited. itll be lots of fun. i have people like jeff stumpf, aj schubert, and kyle mccollum to have fun with. Lots of other people too! cant wait!....so yea. Rachel called me today from girls state and she was crying because shes had a bad time so far. but its only like the first day. she was just sitting in her dorm and i told her she needed to get out and make friends. hopefully she took my advice. this is gonna be a really long week without my rachel! i have a date with rachel reese on Wednesday. we're gonna go see a movie, but i dont know which one exactly. hopefully dodgeball since me, rachel, rachel r, and all of rachel r's friends got kicked out cuz we didnt pay and they were "sold out". my butt they were sold out!...sigh Show Place sucks. jk, but it made me VERY angry! im not goin to make u read about it though. i should prolly go, i have a long day tomorrow!

      Today is father's day. Happy Father's Day to all the father's in the world! yesterday i did a whole lot of nothing. i think....i cant really remember. i went to see Raising Helen again at like 10 at the Will. It was GREAT, once again! Today i went to church. Our praise band played and they did really good. Jon Schubert wrote a song for his stepdad and it was sooo sweet. me and my mom were both crying. And matt's, aj's and jon's real dad doesnt see them alot and hes never there for them, so it was REALLY sweet that jon wrote that song for mike, his stepdad. Then after church i went to El Rancherito with my fam for father's day. Muy sabroso! then we went to my gparents house for like an hour. my uncle joe and attie were there. he is the cutest lil boy ever! I went back to my dad's house, took a nap, and ate at their father's day cook out thingy. fun stuff. Mike is in st louis at a cardinals game. he didnt invite me :( its all good though, cuz jeff invited him. Rachel is at girls state. i really miss her already.

      Hola amigos! Alot has happened but i cant really remember what has happened since the last time i posted, so lets go back to yesterday! yesterday was britt's going away party. shes going up to Norhtwestern for 6 weeks to take classes that she can get college credit for. She's really excited. i would be too, itll be a great experience for her.  Her mom talked to me at work like on Saturday or somethin and asked me to invite a bunch of people. i called alot of people, but several of them were out of town so i was really stressin, and to make matters worse, rachel couldnt come. she had to go to champaign with her fam for fathers day. DARN THEM! its alright though. me and rachel are goin over to britts house after i get off work so rachel can give her an official goodbye, which is really sweet of rachel and i really admire that! So the party was lots of fun. it was me, britt, dina, danielle, agnes, scott, brad, bob, and michael mcgrady. we ate, laughed, swung, and laughed some more! Elyse is alot of fun. i wish rachel couldve been there, she wouldve had fun. so then after dina and danielle left, people like ray, will, ezra, tio, and a couple other girls ive never met showed up. we played ghosts in the graveyard. me and britt sorta played until she got bit by a bug. she said it really hurt. poor britt, hopefully her hand didnt swell up like a balloon today! so then after like an hour, everyone left. i went home and watched my Will and Grace season 1 dvds. i love will and grace. i want a friend like Jack. i want to be like Grace. I want to marry Will, but hes gay.     Today i have to work 2:45-8:45. not really lookin forward to it! but i like money. im startin to get used to show place now. like i really feel comfortable there now. and i can find myself around so thats good.      Tennis starts in like 4 days i think. im so exicted. i always get excited this time of year. i love tennis. I have to work at noon one day this week and tennis practice/open gym goes till 11:30 so ill prolly have to leave at like 11. but im sure it wont be a problem cuz they arent official practices. Those start like August 18th i believe. Squibb is our new coach. he seems pretty strict, im sure hes more strict than Doug, anyone is more strict than Doug!! i miss doug. everyone hated him, especially when he actually made us ran and do stuff that would help us. thats when i would like him more! But I'll just have to see what Squibb is like before i judge him. i hope he lets me call him Phil! heehee! i should prolly go. Adios Amigos!

      Hello to everyone in Internetland! (that was like Candace!) School is out, and much like maja, i dont know what to do with myself! But its a great feeling. I feel like there needs to be something i worry about...but theres not. Friday i went to school (for the hour and a half) and it was fun. i spent most of my time in jay's (aka mr mann..lol) room. I got alot of good pictures of my friends..well the friends that were at school that day.  i even got one with mr mann on rachels camera..which reminds me, rach, you need to develop those pics! Saturday me and mike had a cook out at fox ridge. rachel, stephen, me, mike, andy, jeff, and mike williams were all there. It was fun but it wasnt anything too spectacular. i was actually kinda disappointed because i was expecting it to be alot more fun than it was. but it was fun anyways. me and rach are GREAT at keeping the fire burning naturally! we dont need no stinkin lighter fluid...although it was fun to play with. but we got yelled at by stephen and mike whenever we used it.  Sunday i went to Royal for my godsister's birthday. it was fun because there were 2 really cute babies there. they would "talk" to each other. well then arent old enough to actually talk, so they talked baby talk. and im convinced that they understood each other!! and my family and i ate at olive garden before we went to the party! it was EXCELLENT! (doug meese voice) I got home and me, mike, rach, and stephen played basketball. it was alot of fun. i like twisted my ankle when i was just standing there with the ball. i wasnt even moving and i like kinda fell. stephen kept makin fun of me and i would fall to the ground laughing every time! hes so funny! My brother's hamster died last night. my mom called me when we were playing bball to tell me. She said that he was totally devestated and he wouldnt stop balling. he said that it was the worst day of his life....poor kid. i hate to break it to him, but he'll have alot worse! althouh, having your hamster die when you're 8 is pretty tramatic! hes ok now though...today i hung out with mike. we watched Varsity Blues....blegh... Then i hung out with rachel. we went to the mall and i got a skirt and a shirt. both for only $25. i was a happy camper! then we went to the Will Rogers and saw mike. i think mike was annoyed and wouldnt let us back in after we went outside. but me, being the awesome person that i am, broke rachels plastic key in the door trying to get back in. it was really funny! but i dont think she enjoyed it. then we went to wal mart and saw phil and jeff stumpf. phil thought rachel was drunk because she was being really crazy!!!! she eventually calmed down and i took her home. I think i have to clean my room tomorrow! BLAH!!!! so yeah! thats whats been going on....Adios!

      Hello everyone! im in such a good mood! i just got back from seeing "Raising Helen" with Rachel. it is SUCH a good movie! its my favorite movie! sigh...i want to marry a Lutheran pastor! lol.. we didnt have school today so i cleaned my car. it looks really nice. then mike came over and we played baseball, well more like catch, in Kiwanis park. it was fun. then we drove around for a wee bit and went to 4th street records. it was bloody cold in there! we saw Talitha and Ryan Spitz, which made me really happy! tomorrow is the "last" day of school, but its not really a day at all. we get out at like 10:30 and there are only gonna be like 100 people there cuz its pretty much pointless. those days are my favorites though cuz everyone is so happy...for the most part and its just a lot of fun for me. I need to see if i won secretary for Spanish Club...i really hope i did. i love spanish..i love mr mann...i love rachel..i love mike...i love everyone! well not everyone but pretty much!!  Hey rachel...its not too late, to whip it! whip it good!

        I just got back from the National Youth Gathering in Orlando. It was the most amazing experience EVER! there were 35,000 Lutheran teenagers gathered in the convention center. the theme was "Beyond Imagination". I sound totally corny, but it truly was beyond imagination. i became so much closer to everyone in my youth group, including the adults. Especially Kyle. Wow, what an awesome guy. It was a very emotional week going between me, kyle and mike. me and kyle started to really like each other and became VERY GOOD friends.we've always had sort of a thing for one another, but neither one of us had ever done anything about it. we began to wonder if anything would ever be able to happen between us. It wasnt exactly the most convenient time, thats for sure!   so after a very interesting conversation one night we decided to just let things happen and not try to force anything. we decided to enjoy the rest of the week and not have any worries since this was a once in a lifetime experience. we're very good friends now...and i guess we always have been, and hopefully always will be. We're doing Vacation Bible School together this week and im really excited. we're helping wit the 4 year olds. We'll prolly go out for lunch a couple times this week. Mike has been totally awesome throughout this whole deal. He told me that as long as im as happy as i can be it doesnt matter who im with. thats when i realized that mike was meant for me. and mike doesnt have any bad feelings towards kyle, he knows that kyle is an amazing person. kyle is just an awesome friend and im really happy to have him as a friend. There is so much to say about the NYG in orlando but i dont want to bore you. while we were there mr mccollum took pictures and put all of them on the church website. heres the link! --->  urlLink http://www.argenta.net/~immluth/Immanuel_Lutheran_Church.html        I will prolly continue talking about this for the next month or so...and if it doesnt interest you, im really sorry! but I feel like a new person and i feel so great!!!

I got an email reply from mr mann so that made my day. i love mr mann too! I have to work tonight from 5-10:30. blah that sucks. stacey called me earlier and wanted to know if i would go in earlier so she could go home. i didnt really have anything better to do but i said no. cuz bein at work for more than 5 hours seems like FOREVER! i hope shes not mad, she said it was totally fine though.  eh, oh well! Mike worked from 1-4:30 so i dont get to see him today, which sucks. tomorrow im off though. and then i work again Wednesday from 5-11. ick....im kinda excited for work today, i dont know why though. prolly cuz ive been home all day, but i didnt really feel like going out today. so yeah.  Rachel sang yesterday at red, white and blue days. she did really good! i love u rachel.  well i should get goin. adios!   Andy Roddick lost at Wimbledon to stupid Federer! grr!!!
