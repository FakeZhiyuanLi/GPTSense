        The cruel master of our lives spoke angrily this morning. It said, "Get up. Get up. Get up!!!!" The only thing worse than the alarm going off on Monday morning is when you forget to turn it off and it goes off on Saturday. On Saturday, it says, "Get up. Get up. Get up!!!!" For a second there, while it was going off, I contemplated the possibility that there had been a temporal time shift and everything had slid backwards in time two days and that it was actually Saturday all over again. It didn't work. I could not convince myself.  So, I rolled over, curled with Tammy, and wished her a Happy Birthday. It is angry water, breaking walls, and turning wheels day. The plan is to limit her doing much around the house today. I have put a load in the washer and a load in the dryer. She took Kyle to school (necessary, cuz she would be cleaning house if I were gone to do it). Chelsea is up, but achy, so we decided to force her to stay home from school. She did her litter box chore and then did the dishes. There is still a little more laundry duty for me. Is everything supposed to be pink ? I couldn't resist a little 'men don't know how to do laundry' humor. I mean, everyone knows that we do that just to be tossed out of the laundry room.  Of course, we can't stop her from doing anything. That would be a great birthday present. Happy Birthday honey, and for your birthday we want to show you how much we don't need you by doing it all ourselves. Here is your gift wrapped piece of worthlessness. So, in a twisted sort of way, letting her wash my dirty underwear gives her a sense of worthiness, a sense of being needed. Please, no accolades. It is the least I could do.  Guys, don't sweat the laundry stuff. They know we know how to do laundry. They do the same trick with the helpless act about fixing the sink or the toilet. It is all part of a healthy relationship. Fix the toilet. Be the hero. Screw up the laundry. Just go with it, man. Here is another shocker for ya. They can open jars too. (You didn't hear that from me.) Far be it from me to go against the traditional roles set thru the ages by men and women far wiser than I. Of course, there was that 5 year period when I lived alone. I did my own cooking, cleaning, laundry, toilet fixing, and jar opening. Fortunately, Tammy came along to save me.  The angry water, breaking walls, and turning wheels, by the way, is a trip to Comfort Suites in G'town (can't get too far away in case the police are called on the kids). The room has a jacuzzi whirlpool tub and the walls break away to make it part of the room. I won't extrapolate on the cost. I will just say it is sweet to have a son-in-law in hotel management. Thanks Chris.

       Here it is .. Picnic Sunday  Let me back up to the Birthday celebration. Last night was a blast. We went to Todd's Karaoke to celebrate a few birthdays. Tammy's is on Monday. Lisa's is on Tuesday. Crystal, Cynthia, and Shawn's are on Wednesday. Tammy bough her first and last drink. The four in the middle were bought by others wishing her a happy birthday. She was lit. I drank my usual, water. We sang, laughed, hugged and kissed everyone around. We made it home shortly after one AM. Tammy told me she was gonna take advantage of me but by the time I got to bed she was passed out. She owes me one.  We got up this morning and started the preparations. Tammy went to the nursing home to get her mom. We take her to all the picnics. She loves getting out. I sliced onions and tomatoes. I filled up the Mayo, ketchup, and mustard bottles. It was so exciting. Tammy came home with Mom. She was in rare form this afternoon. We think she has begun hallucinating. Talking to her is like coming in in the middle of a movie and trying to catch up. You never know who is lurking in the corner.  We picked up the charcoal that we forget to get at Wal-Metropolis-Mart. Jordan rode his bike here. By the time we were ready to leave, there were 9 kids on the porch wanting to go to the picnic. We packed a few into the Blazer and the rest into the Lincoln and away we went. We got to the park and there was not one picnic table available. Two of the picnic attendees went searching. They found a couple sitting at one of the picnic tables reading. They were not using the grill, so they asked the if they minded giving up the table. I was not there. I do not want to know what intimidation techniques they used, but, they got the table. The picnic was on.  It was good. I grilled 40 burgers and 24 dogs. We had sweet and sour cole slaw and deviled eggs. There were bags of chips and pop on ice. It was a hot Sunday afternoon filled with good food and good friends. It was one of those 'kinda make ya think things are alright' days. Feeling good is a scary thing. I hope it lasts.

        Myth: a person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence  Myth: Abominable snowman, Greek gods, Bigfoot, Loch Ness monster, slow Saturdays  We have been running already this morning. Tomorrow is our bi-weekly picnic for about 60 people. So, we have been on a supply run. Sierra has to be at work at Sonic from 6 til 9. Chris has to be at Eureka’s Pizza from 4 til 11. He worked last night until 11 at eureka’s and then went to work at Tolly Ho’s until 7:30AM. We have to be at Todds at 8:30PM for a Birthday get together for Tammy and some other friends that share close birthdays. Run. Run. Run.  We went to the local Wal-Mart Metropolis-Mart for our picnic supplies. This place is the size of a small third world country. It definitely has a greater economy. I believe Wal-Mart’s are built on large metaphysical vacuums. How else does one explain the constant stream of shoppers flowing thru their doors? On your first visit you are abducted by aliens and injected with a highly addictive shopping drug. The lights at Wal-Mart produce an eerie iridescent glow which feeds the addiction. It soothes the burning in your mind. Only there are you truly at peace.  Wal-Mart knows that all they have to do is get you in the store. You find your car mysteriously turning into parking lot anytime you are driving by, as if drawn by some magical source. The “vacuum” has you. Nothing real exists outside of the Wal-Mart. You think that you went home after your first visit, but you never left the store. You are strapped to a large bank of bodies, sharing thoughts, experiences, feeding the ‘vacuum’. Your mind fights but it is too weakened by the intrusion of the shopping drug. Listen to me. On aisle seven is a little old lady giving free samples of Fritos. Find her. She has the key to your escape. The antidote is in the sample of the Chili Cheese flavored Corn Chips. Free your Mind !

       Ok, here we are, 3 days from T-day. The plotting thickens. I have involved more people in the plot and left a few red herrings around to throw the dogs off of the trail.  One part of the Birthday present has arrived and been given to Tammy. There is a sick and twisted hilariously funny website that we visit regularly. It is  urlLink  ::ill will press::  . One of the characters at this heinous site is pilz-E. He is an ADHD squirrel with a love for little purple pills with the zzzzzzzzzzzz's on them. From this site, I ordered a shirt for her with Pilz-e on it and a caption which prescribes "extra medication for all". She loves her Pilz-E shirt.  The rest of the plot and present involves the kids, hers and mine. I am thinking when all this is said an done, the Ron stock will see a dramatic improvement in the market (not that the Ron stock has suffered any). I will give you a hint, but only a small one, because she reads my blog, as any good wife would (lol). I am seeing angry water and breaking walls. I am seeing wheels turning. (Of course, you know this is for her .. right now she is scratching her head going, "Huh?")  Oh yeah, it is raining here. Donovan has less hair. Malcolm is under the desk being blessedly gas free (so far). Ava escaped last night/this morning, but only went as far as behind her aquarium/terrarium. Dude tempted death by peeing on the bed sometime yesterday evening. Milenko is out of sight/out of mind. There was no school today. They took the kids for 4 days and then spit them back out at us. The great Kyle was excited. He was going to stay up so late. He was conked before midnight last night. That's the news that is the news.

        I have just come from a monstrous cavern of despair where I faced an evil life sucking vampyric ogre and her minion. Not, it was not the endless pits of despair of Algerspits. It is not the bottomless pits of Everland. Nooooooo. It is the family courts of Fayette county. My Ex had me there for the third time in three months to debate the great child support debate. Here is the rub. My income is approximately one seventh of what it was last year. Her income has doubled from last year. Yet, she and her minion has asked that I be imputed with wages 33% higher than I made last year. She has asked that my child support be almost tripled. In June the Judge lowered it but insisted that I put in 15 job apps per week. I did and still do. Next month, in July, she doubled it plus a little bit because I was working a short call. This month, she was in a quandary. The minion of the vampyric ogre was insisting that I have wages imputed to me as if I were making $50K a year (which I am not making anywhere close to) and that my CS be based on that. The judge didn't buy that. She said she believed I was looking for work. My Ex said she believed I was looking for work. Every week, 15 new people believe I am looking for work.  (Any lawyers out there wanna take a pro bono case ?)  We settled on a monthly amount that I do not have. The judge promised not the throw me in jail today for not having it. We come up for review on November 19th. We shall see if the monster of the quagmire gets me or not.

        OK .. Here I stand with cyber egg on my face. It seems that Iraqi cleric Al-Sadr has decided to change his mind once again and die for his cause. He has been quoted as saying, ''Either martyrdom or victory." He is now prepared once more to give his all for his Jihad.  Don't get me wrong. If you want to die for something you believe in, by all means, die for it. This country (America) was built by men and women willing to give everything for the very idea of dying free. The War between the States (You remember it .. The one everyone thinks was about slavery) was fought on both sides by men and women willing to die for their cause. That is the American way.  You remember that kid in grade school ? He/She tormented you. They may have even threatened you. When you got close, they said, "I was just kidding." You back off and as you are walking away, they attack, verbally or otherwise, but it is still an attack.You wheel on yer heels and head back. "I was just kidding." It just gets old. Not to mention that fact that all the wheeling around is hard on the ankles. Make up yer mind. Are you going to die for your cause or not? Make up your mind before we make it up for you.  In Washington, the Bush administration said al-Sadr needed to match words with deeds. ''We have seen many, many times al-Sadr assume or say he is going to accept certain terms and then it turns out not to be the case,'' said National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. OK .. A public official that says he will do one thing to elicit a measured response and then when time comes to pony up, he reneges. Look over your shoulder, Condoleezza. This guy has a great future with the Bush Administration.

       It is just after 9:30 AM and the pressure is rising. No, not the barometric pressure (Well, it may be rising, but it isnt what I am talking about).  Let me back up just a bit. It started at 7AM this morning. Alarms going off, demanding that we get out of bed and do the responsible thing and send the kids off to school. It was slap slap and 9 more minutes of cuddling. So, we get up, get the kids up, and begin the day. Today is different. Tammy has an appointment with her Physical Torturer .. er .. Therapist. She is having an assessment done on her wrist to determine the eventual usability for Workers Comp (she was injured at work by a client). She is taking Kyle to school and Sierra is going with her to the DR. I am taking Chelsea to school and Chris to work. Simple enough. No pressure.  She is out the door. Chelsea is dozing and ready to go. Chris is getting dressed. We are out the door at approximately 8:15 AM. Chella has to be at school no later than 8:30. Still, no pressure. I drop her off in plenty of time. Chris and I swing back around the circle and head to Eureka's Pizza. As we are driving past the house and approaching the stop sign just half a block from home, it happens.  The radio is on 98.1 FM, The Bull. There is some chick giving her gossip report on country music singers, as if it is the be all, do all, end all, of the world. Nothing is more important. I can hear her droning on like faint background noise when she wraps up her report. She says, and I quote, "Have a good rest of the day." There it is. Now I have to worry that my day, or the rest of it, will not be good. She could have taken it easy on us and told us to have a 'good rest of the morning'. That would be easy. It wasn't yet 8:30. The rest of the morning was only a few hours. NO ! She felt compelled to make it the 'rest of the day'.  Who teaches these people to apply this kind of pressure. Tomorrow, I will be up. The radio will be on. I will hear her voice droning again. It will be different this time. This time I will be researching my memory to be able to assure myself that the 'rest of my day' yesterday was good. It is almost 10AM. There has been no cake and ice cream. There have been no naked dancing girls. Tammy is off being tortured, so there is no cuddling and loving. The day is going downhill and I am still under the gun to have a good rest of the day.  Why ? Why ? Why? Why did I have to choose to listen the the radio? There are many CD's in the truck that would never dream of applying this kind of pressure on me. I could have had it off and been enjoying quiet quality conversation with Chris. We were talking. Not about imortant stuff like saving the world, protecting the envirnoment, or whether Brittney Spears is truly happy. It was just supposed to be back ground noise. Now, here I am. The walls are closing in on me. The sun is screaming thru the window. The traffic is humming out side. All of them, turning the crank, applying the pressure. I cannot take it any more. I am out of here.  Oh yeah. Have a good rest of the day, bastard.

       Please, can we vote tomorrow?  I am so sick of all the political ads saturating every air wave of every medium. There is no politically safe place. THAT'S IT !! We need a political free zone. There has to be some place where a citizen can go where they will not be bombarded with leftist/rightist propaganda. At various locations throughout the city, there should be a place where no ads can be seen, no radio can pick up a signal, no TV can broadcast, and giant mutated armadillos with 5 inch fangs attack anyone mentioning a candidate or political party. When you are feeling overwhelmed by your morning commute, you can rush to one of these Political Free Zones. They will replace the small smoking sections outside of restaurants. They will become PFZ's. In every bathroom in an office building, there should be a PFZ stall. Ohhhhhh, the humanity.   Can we write in "no-one" ?

         I have been reading the news of the world, the one outside of my door.   It seems that Iraqi Cleric Al-sadr in Najaf has decided that fighting unto death is no longer a good idea. Once troops got close enough to actually carry out his wishes, he decided that he needed to sign a peace accord. In the terms of this accord, he will remove and turn over the militants hiding in the shrine. Not only is he surrendering, but he is turning over those under his command or protection. What happened to the day when a person vowed to fight til death and did it. "I will win or get close to death trying" Just doesn't have the same menacing ring, does it? "I will defy you until you almost beat me up." Oooooo, scary !. "You wont get my lunch money .. Unless you threaten me a whole lot."  Kids playing in a grown up world with grown up toys. They will be the death of us all.

       It is time to meet the rest of the gang.  Living with us at the house is a menagerie of pets. The oldest of these is the boss of the house, Dude. Dude is a male cat. He was born at my old place and has been with me since his birth (mostly). He was 4 years old in May. I came home from work one day to a squirming bundle of kittens, a gift from Bob, their mom. This gets tricky. I got a cat and named her Allie. Later, the kids came home from a trip with a friend to see him race, with a solid black purr-ball. We named him Bob. About nine months later, Allie's balls dropped and shortly thereafter Bob was pregnant. Don't ask me to determine your cat's sex. Cat gender is not my bag. Well, bob had 5 kittens. I gave most of them away and gave Bob away as well. Allie decided he didn't want to hang around anymore. As I was giving the kittens away, one of them would mysteriously disappear anytime someone came to pick one up. Chasity named her 'Doodles'. Well .. As you might suspect .. He wasn't a her .. and I was not going to have a male cat named 'Doodles'. So, doodles became 'the Dude'. He is definitely a cat with attitude. My friends say he has 'personality'. About 5 months ago, Dude decided to leave. He hung around the house but would run whenever anyone approached him. Then just as suddenly as he left, he appeared on the porch seeking entry. He walked in as if he had never left. There was one small change. That small change was a miniature Pomeranian named Donovan. Donovan is about 3 years old. Leonard (who gave us this gay dog) told us he was house broken. Let me tell ya, always suspect this statement from anyone trying to give you a dog. I mean, do you really think they will tell you that the dog is going to crap every where, and you will still want it? Anyway, Donovan weighs about 5 to 7 pounds. He is a registered Champion Stud dog. He is scared of everything in the house except Tammy. Every noise causes him to jump, run, and hide. Every now and then, he will come to me and stand by my leg looking for attention. Now we are at Malcolm. Malcolm was born in May of 2003. He weighs about 80 to 90 pounds. He is a registered Boxer. He is a smart goofball. He takes to training quite well, but walks into doors and walls. We have only had him for about 2 months, but he is already a member of the family. He sleeps by the bed at night. He tries to sleep in it from time to time, but that doesn't work with his size, his nails, and our waterbed. He loves rough housing with the kids. He would never hurt them, except by accident. Now we are down to Ava. Ava was born in May of 2003 as well. She is about 22 to 24 inches long now. Ava is a Ball Python. She is friendly, but her once a week feeding of a live mouse reminds you that she is first and foremost, a predator. She love wrapping herself around Tammy's wrist in what Tammy calls a snake-let. She is growing and getting stronger all the time. Her growth will be controlled by her cage size. Right now, she has much room to grow. Temporarily, Chris has a white rat, Melinko. He has it in the room, but there isn't room in there for the cage, and the other room inhabitant does not like it at all. There will be discussion when he comes home today as to what we are going to do about this. There is no other place in the house to keep Melinko. Time will tell, and so will I.

         The dust  is settling. The kids have returned from their fast paced first day at school.  Kyle gets out at 2:50 at one of the worst traffic situated schools in town. You are not allowed to park in front of the school to wait for your child. You can park across the street if you want to arrive at 2:00 and wait, or you can try to park in the crowded school parking lot with just enough spaces for the staff. The problem with this is that the kids come out at the other end of the school. It was a source of constant fun last year when I would go to pick up Kyle. I would 'stop' in front of the school. They would come out to tell me that I could not park there. I would (politely, of course) explain to them that I was not parked, as my truck was still running and I was still inside it. This is known as stopping and not posted as an illegal activity. They would tell me that the police would write me a ticket. OK, let them. I would be the one to pay it and that too would be no skin off of their backs. They have decided that it is a waste of time to tell (threaten) us anymore.  Chelsea gets out of school at 3:40 at a school with just a slightly better parking/traffic situation. We meet Chelsea about a half a block from the school on the major street the school shares a corner with. It is just a parking bad dream, not a full fledged nightmare.  In the middle of those pickups, Tammy had to pick Sierra up from work. Her boss has scheduled her for starting at noon, several days this week. It has been explained to him that this has to be an only time deal. Her work cannot/will not interfere with her education.  Kyle is excited to be back in school. He has limited friend interaction here at the house. Most of his interaction is with friends of the older kids that visit. While Kyle is sometimes smarted than these visitors, he still needs friends of his own age to play with. Chelsea spent the day in the library or cafeteria, as the school has not gotten her schedule finished yet. Sierra is fussing with Jordan (her boyfriend) about being invisible. Yes, things are normal here.

        Here it is, the first day of Hallelujah. It is more commonly known by parents and children alike as the first day of school. I am sure the kids have a different name for it as well. Back to alarms going off early and kids complaining in the morning about clothes, books, and breakfast. Hallelujah ! It has been a long and eventful summer around here. It began on the last day of school for Kyle. Ronnie, Tammy's ex, was here to pick up the kids for his month visitation during the summer. A day later they were all headed to Florida and the house got deathly quiet. It was a creepy feeling, but one that rapidly turned to silent jubilation. Don't get me wrong, I love kids. I love my kids. I love Tammy's kids. Still, there needs to be times when, for extended periods of time, adults can be alone. This was our time. One month of no children. The month passed quickly, as they often do. Before we knew it, it was the fourth of July and time to go to Florida to pick up the kids. Tammy went while I worked 12 and 14 hours days here. The following month and a half of summer, the kids were here. Let me explain. They are not bad kids, they are not good kids, they are just kids. During the summer, they tend to stay up all night and sleep most of the day. They live a life without structure for that time. Any time, day or night, at least one of them is sleeping and at least one of them is awake. Then, add to this the coming and going of friends in varying numbers. It makes for some interesting evenings. Two weeks ago the summer took a decidedly sad turn. Two friends of the kids were involved in a shooting. One shot the other, then shot himself, as far as anyone knows. David and Tommy were arguing when David shot Tommy, then turned the gun on himself. Tommy died the next day. While the kids knew both boys, they were much closer to Tommy. He was one of the adoptees. He was broken kid from an ignoring family. He latched on to us. Tammy took him in like she does all the other stray kids. Like most, he called her 'Moms'. His funeral was last week. The kids are still reeling from this.  The kids. Let me introduce ya to the kids.  Kyle is 8 and starting 3rd grade this morning. He was so excited to be back at school, he almost didn't wait for the car to stop before he was trying to get out the door. Chelsea is 13 and starting 7th grade. She too is excited about going back to school. Perhaps not so much that she would jump from a moving car, but excited none the less. Sierra is 15 and homeschooled. She has ADHD, ODD, and is bi-polar. Public schools around here are just not able to teach her. Year before last she attended Crawford Middle School. Their idea of handling her was to put her in the back of the classroom and ignore her. This did not work. Last year, we homeschooled her with great success. She excelled in learning. With Sierra, the keys are to keep her on task and limit her frustrations by taking the time to explain and teach her. Then .. There is Chris. Chris is 18 and trying to get his GED. He can pass it all except for a part of the math. The trouble comes with estimation. He figures the answer quickly enough that he doesn't need to estimate. Then he tries to guess what the estimate should be by taking the number closest to his answer. That doesn't work. He begins his new job at Eureka's Pizza on Wednesday.  Back to the Hallelujah reason. In my humble opinion, kids require structure. They need patterns of events and behaviors. School provides that for them. The house being empty for afternoon sex is good as well. You know, we are still honeymooning. I'll let ya know how their day went when I get the reports back.

        Well .. Here goes .. I don't know if anyone is reading this or not, but that is not important (a lie). You know, the important thing is that I get my feelings and words out of my head (ok, almost a lie). Things get a little jumbled up in my head at times and it is better to slap it down on cyber-paper than to just leave it up there to interact with other nonsense and serious thinking stuff. Since this is the first post here, I will allow y'all a brief glimpse into my head. It might be scary. It might be enlightening. It might be like trying to swim in the shallow end of the pool. I am not sure that I think on a deep level all the time. I might be drowning in my own thoughts, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are deep. Right about now my deepest thoughts are how I begin a new paragraph. 'Enter' does not seem to work. My sister, now approaching 50, skipped school once while she was in High School. She went with some friends to Boonesboro 'beach'. OK, in Kentucky, we don't have real beaches, but we call this sandy spot on the side of the Kentucky River a beach. Sue us ! Anyway, she was enjoying her day away from school, splashing around in the water, when she fell. Underwater, she went. She came up, gasping, and down she went again. Once more, she broke the surface, gasped for air and dropped into the murky deep. She was drowning (a curse from God for her sin of skipping school). She was going down for the last time when a kindly gentleman walked over to where she was dying, and told her to stand up. She was drowning in water that was knee deep. That could be the case in my head and in my thoughts. My drowning in them and the depth of them are not necessarily related. I promise I will try not to drown in the knee deep thoughts of what color the bathroom should be painted or which side of the roll the toilet paper should unroll (the back/wall side or the front side). This is not to say that these things are not important to someone on some level, just not blog material, or so I think.  Oh yeah, and I figured out the new paragraph thing.  So, lets go for a ride in my head. The basis for much of my thinking will originate from my upbringing and outcoming. My father was a church pastor from the time I was 3 years old until a few years ago. I am running headlong now toward 50 myself. I do have the brief stops at 47, 48, and 49 to go. My mother is a full blooded German mom. Dad was stationed in Germany during the Korean conflict, where they met, fell madly in love and were married. They have been married just over 50 years now. I was a rebellious teenager in my own head, even though I have only smoked one pack of Marlboro's in my life (around the time I was turning 16), I have never (yes, never) been drunk, and I have never been high (heck, I never smoked the wacky backy). I got married at 19 after dropping out of college. I joined the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and began my apprenticeship a month before the wedding. My pay dramatically increased from $2.65 to $4.25 per hour. Around 21, I 'accepted' the call to preach and began working in the church pastored by my father. My father worked as an electrician and pastored the church as well. Until he was in his 50's, he never accepted any salary from the church. What is interesting is, when I was a boy, dad would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up. My answers varied, but the one thing that remained constant was that there were two things I never wanted to be. Those were an electrician and a preacher. How funny life is can only be topped by how funny life is. Twenty years, three beautiful daughters, and miles of water under the bridge, after Kaye and I were married, we divorced. We remained friends (mostly). My daughters are grown and growing. Two of them are married and have children of their own. Now is when I learn if those parenting skills (or lack thereof) actually worked. The divorce was 6 years ago. Kaye remarried, divorced, and remarried again since then. About 28 months ago I met Tammy, a beautiful lady who eventually (Oct 2003) became my wife. She and I, and her four children make our home in Lexington, KY.  That is the shallow end of the pool. Later we might venture into deeper waters, but for today, I think I will retreat to the safety of my cozy beach towel in the warm sand. Try not to block my sunlight while ya read.
