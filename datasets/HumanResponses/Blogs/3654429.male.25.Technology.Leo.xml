      So, this girl I was dating will text message me and say "Hope U had a good day" and thats it.  So, what do you say to that?  "Yep it was good" or "No it sucked".  It wasn't really stated as a question so should I respond to it?  How about just with a "thanks".   On the surface level it seems that this is just an innocent "hi" kind of thing, but I dated this girl for about a month, a little more (we went on several dates and I stayed at her house a bit), and once i got to know her I realized she wasn't that nice of a person.  So, forgive me for being a bit jaded or misguided here, but I think she is trying to be nicer than she really is because I stopped dating her.    Not only that, she was also one of those girls that wasn't quite sure what she wanted so she was pretty hot and cold aswell.  God I love the hot and cold ones!  (note the sarcasm).    So, my dilemna... Do I maintaing a friendship with her or do I just end all ties to her?   I have ended all ties with people like this before and I feel bad because I am very big on friends and family.   I think this time I am going to let nature run its course, just see what happens and not force a decision on anything.

      How many of you have a burrito guy come to your work?  Is he a retired smelly guy like the one that delivers luke warm potato filled burritos to us?  He doesn't even make the burritos, that poor SOB has to go talk to all the different businesses and get laughed at by the stuck up corporate types who run 15 miles a day and never eat anything with more than 2 carbs in it because thats the cool thing to do now.   The burrito guy...  Not only does the burrito guy keep raising his prices, he came up here yesterday with 1 beef burrito and 1 chicken...at 9:00am.  Now, I buy the occasional bacon and egg burrito in the morning but why even bother coming up to the 5th floor at 9:00am if you are out of all things breakfast??    I think he should deliver milk and cereal too..."how about some fruity pebbles burrito guy?"

      This is my first blog.  It seems to be a popular thing these days so I figured I would give it a try so I don't get left behind.   I'm gonna use this blog to rant about technology...and how it kills.  So, if you ever have one of those days where you go furthur backward than forward, let me hear about it....rant about it. If you ever get frustrated at your tech job and think "God, it can't be healthy for a person to sit in front of a screen for so long!" or "why is my screen flickering" and you realize its your eyes....then just blog it.  Well, I might blog some cool things, tips, and other generally useless information that might seem to make the work day go by a bit faster.
