      Well, I don't think you could say that I stuck with my new eating habits this weekend.  I did horribly actually, so I am not going to go into what I ate.  I am going grocery shopping tomorrow, joy to the world, and I am going to get a lot of weight watcher dinners.  I think if I make a habit of eating those for lunch and dinner and not snacking in between meal times that should help.  I am going to continue my work out regime also.  Mother, if you would care to walk with me or do my "Pilates for Dummies" tape with me let me know.  I am going to walk regardless.  I will beg Allen to come walk with me.  I just have to keep saying this "I am the only thing standing between me at my weight now and me 50 lbs lighter."  I alone can do it.  When you think about the fact that you could do it alone.  You can be the weight you dream about, you just have to work for it.  It seems ridiculous that you haven't done it yet.  So I am going to try and keep that attitude.  No more cheating on the weekend.  I have to keep this a regular thing or else I will never get anywhere.  I am all talk now, but I have to see if I can stand the test of time.

        I HATE BEING FAT!     Let's just start with what I ate today: Tacos - made with turkey meat(not beef!)  Turkey meat is 99% fat free I put cheese and salsa on my taco I had a bowl of cereal for breakfast one cup of La Creme vanilla yogurt. 2 diet cokes 2 waters  I did freaking good if you ask me and I still ate good foods.   I went to Walmart with Tina and we bought "Pilates for Dummies" Tina was too fond of it I could tell, but I liked it.  I think it would be better if I did the pilates and then walked for a bit afterward.  I was thinking of getting this tape called "Yoga Booty."   Obviously, it assists you in the booty area.  Which I need a lot of help with.  I have enough butts to give everyone in my neighborhood a booty like JLo.    I would rant more but I am fairly tired and a certain book is calling my name.

      Well, the little problem I am having with my poop is getting out of hand.  I have a constant feeling like I need to take a dump.  (I know, I know too much information.)  Allen was sleeping peacefully and he had his arms wrapped protectively around my waist as if I am his teddy bear that might run away.  Puts a sweet image in your head doesn't it?  Well, think of it from my angle.  This position is my normal sleeping position; which most of the time I love.  His arms are all I want around me.  However, on this particular night his arms are squeezing farts out of me.  Now, farts come out of the butt; which at this point in time is malfunctioning....I will let you complete the rest of that thought.  So as I am running to the bathroom with my hand at my butt as if I am going to catch it falling out.  I make it to my porcelain easy chair, and I call it this because I have been sitting there more than my lazy boy.  It is an explosion of atomic magnitude.  If you looked out your window around 12:30am tonight you would have seen a brown mushroom cloud over the interlochen area.  If they could re-create what I just did and put it in a missile we could take out Iraq and leave just a skid mark.    Anyway, I went on that tangent because after my anal explosion I had some tortilla chips and a little On The Border salsa.  I didn't eat a lot, but I had around 15 chips.  So, I was feeling guilty.  Since my screaming butthole, or as Allen so delicately started calling it my firebutt, wouldn't permit any shut eye until it had it's explosion I had some time to write it.  Thanks for the patience in reading this tangent, for that's what it is ladies and ladies!  I hate the runs, the trots, Hershey squirts, or whatever other cute name you want to place on it!  How could you place a cute name like Hershey squirts on something that has massive amounts of doo coming out of your butthole all the time?  I think a cute name like that should be saved for something involving bunnies or something froo froo like that.  This hell on earth experience does not deserve a cute name.  So here are a few names I found on the internet that better describe this hell: * wash the walls (that one is for mom) * bottom barf * chorro (Mexican Spanish for "You got the flu in your hole"  * shitathlon (it most certainly is that) * shooting soup  * supersonic sewer sauce  * ten-twenties (10 seconds to shit, 20 minutes to wipe)  * toilet bowl stew  There you are my friends!  I am leaving you now.  My butt is settled and I think I might get some shut eye.  At least until I get another atomic demand.    Love,  Courtney

      The runs suck but it will really suck if I don't lose any weight. For all of this pain I want to lose. Gloria

      Well, I don't know how long this will last, but so far things are pretty easy.  I am enjoying this new lifestyle.  I feel like I am doing something right.  I think my butt would disagree with me...I have had diarrhea all day. (Speak of the devil, I have to poop) Okay, I am back.  Well, I know this is bad, but all I ate today was dinner.  I had a headache and did not feel like eating earler.  So I ate the following today: 1 1/2 chicken breasts with serendipity seasoning  A few bites of mexican rice (it sucked so I didn't have a lot.)  A packet of La Creme strawberry yogurt  20 oz. diet coke Water  That's it!  I swear, no food lies here.  My butthole hurts though.  Courtney
