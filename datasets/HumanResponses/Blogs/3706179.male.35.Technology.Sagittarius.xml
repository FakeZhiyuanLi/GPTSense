						   It turns out this thing WAS on. Whodathunkit?  Busy day, short post. I AM going to try to stay in the habit of doing this, though. Not cuz I have any readership, but because it's good exercise. I did really want to be a writer when I grew up, but I discovered I kinda sucked at it. I never got past my writing sounding very pompous to my own ears, and so I kind of dropped any creative-writing exercises.  I still like writing. It's a bit like cerebral masturbation. It feels good to touch these parts of my brain on a regular basis again. Yeah yeah, TMI, I know.  More on why I'm doing a blog. Briefly. These 2 were kind of my inspiration:  http://www.wilwheaton.net http://www.internettime.com/blog/index.html  Wil Wheaton dot net? you might ask. Yes, I might reply. I never thought the guy who played Wesley Crusher would inspire me to anything, except maybe murder. I was wrong, and the central issue with that is that Wil is the guy who *played* Wesley. He isn't Wesley, although he really seems to be the best kind of modern nerd.  The other one is by a guy name Jay Cross. If you aren't into education or, specifically, e-learning, you might never have heard of him. I am into education and, specifically, e-learning, and this guy is the MAN. Trust me on that.  Short post, I said. I think someone ran the /v switch on me at birth.  Ciao for now

						   A new blog. What are the chances, huh?  Actually, considering it's me doing it, 6 months ago the chances would have been slim to none. Yesterday, the chances wouldn't have been much better!  I suppose I should introduce myself, should some unfortunate soul actually stumble across this and read it. Hi, I'm Laudinum! :-D  Laudinum is the gaming name I use. If you run across someone playing CS, TFC, BF1942 or sundry others with that handle, chances are pretty good it's me. No guarantees, though. It's startling the number of times I've been told I couldn't use that name, though maybe it has more to do with the fact that it's a bastardization of a drug name (laudanum) than any actual popularity online. A lack of popularity is why I chose it in the first place, and as far as the drug thing, well, that was kinda my culture at the time. No, I've never sampled any opium derivatives, but all the cool marijuana names were taken.  Why do a blog? I'm sure some would reply with "why not?". Why not indeed. In fact, that will have to do for now, as I really don't have a better answer. It probably has something to do with it being kind of a "forced" journal, that maybe I'll actually update. Just like buying that gym membership will actually "force" me to go work out. Heh.  More for intro info, eh?  From: Atlantic Canada, la belle province, New Brunswick Age: Heh, I'm a little more than a week past my 36th birthday. Perhaps my reason for blogging now is that I can smell my own mortality. Interests: Computers (surprise surprise!), computer games, canoeing, fishing,(I used to include hunting here, but the gun registry sucked the joy right the hell out of that!), reading, and, well, sex. What? I'm a perv cuz I stuck that on the end, there? Don't YOU like sex? If that had been an ordered list, sex would have been at the first. But no, in our little proto-victorian society we're still supposed to be ashamed of our sexuality, so I felt obliged to stick it on the end, and even thought about not including it at all. Hm. Employment: Yes, thanks! Seriously, though, I call myself a professional nerd, though some might question the professional, while others (*cough*linuxusers*cough*) might question the nerd part. More on this later, maybe.   That's probably enough for now. I'm getting a little bored, so I can't imagine what any poor soul reading this must be going through.   Cheers for now, Laud.
