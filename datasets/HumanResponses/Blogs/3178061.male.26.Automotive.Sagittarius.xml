      And in other news, Fenris the poet has written yet another offering of poor poetic skill and lackluster verse to sate your thirst for wanton sillyness and tom-foolery with this bit of fluf called "Can't Help  Hating You Now"  enjoy...   At the end I wish I still loved you I wish my feelings  Would last a little longer Than that song we both liked I wish it had been forever I wish I held you in my heart  Close to what is important  I wish that you were important I wish that you were important to me I wish feeling would last I wish hunger would last I wish we could last I wish For so many things to come to you I wish I wanted you I wish I needed you like you don’t need me I wish I could feel a part of you in my soul I wish I could feel me in you Not for sex Not for lust But truly for the reaching  Stretching for a bigger soul I wish I smelled you when I wake I wish I heard you in my house But the delicate plant that we grew Between us is dead from neglect Not long ago it passed into death Here at the end I wish that I held you Not for me Not for you I wish for the sake of holding I wish for the sake of loving  I wish for the return I wish for feeling I wish for … I wish                                   Bent.

      I was listening to Nirvana on my way to school today.  for those who don't know, (which is most) I live a half hour from work and school.  that time makes a great buffer between home and the other two.  I was listening to Nevermind.  Yeah, you all owned that one at one time or other, I know.  I myself like Bleach and In Utero more, but ya take what ya can, hey?  anyway, as I was coming to school, I found myself running a single lyric through my head "I found it hard, it's hard to find, the will what ever, nevermind."  or that is what it sounded like to me.  and I started to think about that, I know, first mistake.  Anyway, I was really digging what I was coming up with about that one bit of the song, with Cobain ripping the song from his soul up and out his mouth.  And I thought about how hard it is to keep the desire to live day to day at the grind.  I thought about primary motivation, what gets you out of bed in the morning. For me, it honestly is my faith in my God, my Heavenly Father.  For you it's something different.  But we all have a primary motivation that helps us face the day, to find the will to accomplish what ever we need to.  what's your Prime Motivation?  Answer silently.

      well, here I am just a few minutes later, I decided that I should post another poem.  This one goes with my heart felt thanks to Weis and Hickman for Dragonlance, and most especialy Sturm Brightblade, yeah, I know they will never read this.  I don't care.  I am sharing, because I want to.  Any way, here it goes...  Paperback Knight  You’d never know I live two lives, One out here and one in books. When I read, I move  Into a world of knights and swords, Armor and honor. With my own invented history.  “My Honor is my Life.”  Ranks of knights form and chant, Swords held at salute. Steel glows in the morning sun. The blade I hold was my father’s. I belong to him, much as the sword did. The sword his tool in life, I’m his tool in death.  “Est Sularus oth Mithas.”  The line of my family reaches long. Into the past our house extends,  Many knights of the Crown,  A few of the Kingfisher, And less of the Rose.  “My Honor is my Life.”  I mutter this oath to a pretend God.  This fictious code of false knights. Words in a language existing only in a book. The unreal world this way of life comes from Ends when I press the halves of a ragged paperback together.  “Est Sularus oth Mithas.”  Imagination fades, The book slides into my backpack. These knights slip from my mind.  Their wars and vengeance fade, But I am left with the oath. This code of life in a world I pretend to know.  “My Honor is my Life.” bent.     If you havn't read Dragonlance Cronicles, pull your head out and get to it.

      So, there I was at dinner, someone asked me what the most profound thing I have learned in the past year has been.  This comes at the end of my first semester as a colege junior. I thought about all the things that I learned in m upper division English classes, I thought about my spirituality, and lessons learned the hard way from the Old Man.  I thought about the two failed attempts at meaningful relationships and one real possibility, I thought about the new and growing relationship I have with my parents, and how I see them in an entirely new light.  I thought about a lot of different things, and the final result came when I read something a friend wrote about feeling content.  I have to say it simply, the biggest thing I have learned is how to grow and strive to be a better human being, and still be content with my progress so far.  Am I in a rush to find love and get hitched? no. Am I ubber involved in my church? no, involved yea, but I have time for alone time, which I need from time to time.  I am growing, and not breaking down, because I am content to be who I am right now, the bad poetry will get posted next time, I promise.  right now I am feeling too good to worry about poetry, perhaps tomorrow... any way, Thanks J, I honestly appreciated your post.

      Well now, this being an election year and all, I was thinking, why not start my own political party?  No, I don't want to run for president or anything like that, nor do I want to back anyone else, I just want to draw together some like minded folks so we can have a rally, wave the flag around and give out keychains with our names on them.  See, my folks got realy involved in politics since my dad retired.  They have been telling me to register to vote, and I will.  I believe that if you don't participate, you have no right to complain.  but anyway, back to the party idea.  I want to call it the "Codependant" party, you see, we have the Republicans who want to give aid to big buisness so that big buisness can give us, the citizens, reitrements and health insurance and what not, then you have the Deomcrats who don't think the average human being is capable of providing anything for its self and want to institute government programs wo hold everyones hands while they piss.  You have the American Communist party, well, the only place that communism has realy caught on is China, but they are culturaly disposed to it already.  Or Cuba, which, I honeslty look at as a dictatorship, because Castro Runs The Country!  then you have your independant party, they beileve in voting for candidates that will not win any big elections and probably never go anywhere.  throw in a couple dozen other fringe parties and you have the American Political system, according to my understanding anyway.  So I want to start the Codependant Party.  No, no codependant will ever run for office, because we are not good enough or capable enough to pull it off.  We know that government, regardless of Party will screw us in the end.  But hey, we deserve it.  we obviously did something wrong and need to be punished for it, and if we ever kick government out, it will come back all broken hearted and contrite.  It might even bring us flowers!  then we will take it back, eventualy we will do something that will deserve abuse again, and the cycle will star all over again.  But that is all beside the point, I just want to have a Political Rally!  wouldn't that be fun?  Or putting up signs with names on them on your lawn?  when the city council candidates are named Smith and Jones, you put up a sign that says Vote Murphy for city council.  anyway, for now that is as political as I intend to get.  If you think I am expressing a deep seated resentment for our government, I am NOT.  I love it here, I would never live in any other country.  Hell, I'll probably never visit another country.  I just feel that Government steps on peoples toes, but it hasn't tromped on all our toes all at once, unlike some other institutions.  anyway, enough said by me.  watch this spot for more bad poetry.  And remeber, Fenris loves you baby!

      OK, now for some of the Poetry, I know the one person to check this out will be drooling for some bad poetry...   here ya go I call it...  piecemeal  Tapped on rips Glued where pieces didn’t fit Puzzles pieced by maniacs Black on white it hangs From a rusted nail driven spike  On display before you   I held it up I drove the nail With my own hand, drove the nail To rough-cut beam I staked it   Inspiration impaled  Left out to dry----die There it hangs Before kings and fools Blackened blood seeps from the nail hole  On the beam I post my soul Out for all to see I’ve nailed it there To share with fools  who think they see. bent.  PS, ohhh yeahh, I almost forgot one of my favorite names, bent.  it's how I sign all my poetry, i know you wanted to know that, so I just figured I would share.

      The message that I formerly posted here has been removed in favor of a Poem called   PAGAN  Stone bakes my hands  Sweat burns at eye corners I cry as I worship my God Stretching for a crack I wedge my fist and hang  Heatwaves lick my chest and stomach Arms quiver searching the face of God A nob becomes a hold I advance and spread on stone Move before pain robs my grip Endurance drips away with sweat I lean in supported by feet  Pressed to rock Fire burns through shoes The face of God burns me  Chalk my hands and reach Making the move I fall from my God  I am glad for the rope  Bent  I dig climbing.  This is how I feel when I climb.

      Well, I just read a little Email from a good friend of mine.  turns out Terry Goodkind is putting out another three books in the Sword of Truth series.   I nearly filled my shorts with poo.  then I read another Email from the same friend.  June 6th will see Stephen King's Song of Susanah out on the market.  Then I was sure of it, I needed to change my shorts.  Now that I have showered and dressed in fresh clothing, well...  I guess the wait for Goodkind will not be all that hard for me.  News that my two favorite series will be concluding.  I am excited.  not dissapointed, no.  unlike the ignorant, who still read the series that features characters that the author himself isn't sure of their purpose in the story, (lil Bobby Jordan's Wheel of Time, God help it stop spinning!)  Both Goodkind and King seem to actualy have a concept of what it is like to limit the number of characters that get involved in the story.  Before I go off too much, I must say this, I am very excited to read the conclusion to the Dark Tower, which will be out before the end of the year, It will be a great year for those who read.

      Ok gang (I have always wanted to refer to my imaginary group of followers and friends that way)  you know that I always throw out the word turgid from time to time.  I would have to say that it is one of my favorite words, come on, just say it out loud "Turgid."  come on, this time with meaning, say it like you mean it. "TURGID!!"  it could be a battle cry, a strange and foreign call to arms, the name of a forgotten War God, but it isn't, however, it does mean, according to Webster's Unabriged Dictionary of the English language ("If it's not unabriged, it's probably shorter.") 1. Swollen; distented; tumid. 2.inflated, overblown, or pompus; bombastic.  according to Microsoft Word, some synonyms are:  Pompous, Dull, hard going, stilted, pretentious, affected, solemn and self-important.  Now, see how fun that was, learing can be great fun!  Anyway, I have a date in just a little while, so I'll be toodling along now.  hope you both have a great time doing whatever you do.

      But What of the Wolf?   What is he to become In this new enlightened age?  When honor is old fashoned And left out in the rain;  What is a wolf to do when  he feels he can't fit in?  What shall he do  with his outmoded ways?  Shall he cast off his coat, Turn in his teeth?  And take up man's ways, Sure to never offend;  Sacrificing honor for acceptance Is the wolf a fool?  This has been a bit of on line compulsive poetry, a first for this wolf. Fenris

      I have been thinking a lot about friends recently.  I never had that many until the past few years.  I can't quite figure out how a goof ball nerd like me gets to have the coolest friends.  I guess that is just the way it breaks in life sometimes.  But anyway, I have been thinking about how I watch my friends interact.  They seem to be a pretty good bunch of folks.  They never seem to judge each other.  There is always a healthy dose of teasing and button pushing, but it never seems to enter the cold malicious deliberate stage where people intend to destroy other people.  I am still getting used to having multiple friends, some in Logan, some in the basin, some in Provo, and a very very good friend in Kaysville.  I will not belabor the part about my friend in Kaysville, because those who know me know that I talk almost incessantly about her and you have or will hear me talk about her at some point or other.  I am not going to apologize for that.  I am in love folks, and ya just have to deal with it.  Anyway, like I said, this group of friends thing is new to me, and most of you have heard me thank you for your friendship.  Well, with fingers crossed (you have no idea how hard it is to type that way) I will try to put in words what friends mean to me, and why at some point I will thank you for your friendship.       No one is ever forced to become good friends with anyone else.  It is a free choice made by a person to like and trust, on some level, another person.  Now, for someone to accept a friend, well now, that is expressing trust and granting a value to the person befriended.  Not to say that the befriended person had no value before, but their value has gone up because someone besides god has recognized their value.  Come on, you know it's true, when you are valued by another person you feel better about your self.  Anyway, when I thank people for being my friend/friends, I am not groveling and saying thanks for giving me value, I am saying Thank you for recognizing my value and choosing to associate with me, it's simple people, don't tell me how easy it is to be friends with me, don't tell me it is silly to thank you.  All I am doing is saying thanks for reaffirming my value in God's eyes.  Because when you break it down, that is what friends do.  Any way, enough said this post.  Thank you all for being friends with me.  Also, if you are not my friend and you read this, well, you really are missing out, because I happen to belong to several of the greatest groups of friends on the face of the Earth.

      well, I have mentioned Robert E. Howard before.  I really like his writing style.  Anyway, I wrote this poem a while ago to try to express my feelings for Mr. Howard.  hope you enjoy.  Dear Mr. Howard,  I wish to write you Expressions of awe and  Ameturish admiration drip  From my mouth the words run  Too much separates you and I Forty one years from your death To my birth divide us Miles from Cross Plains Texas Too far to drive in a day  Mr. Howard, I wish you still wrote Yelling and beating words like forged iron From your Underwood came vibrant worlds   “By this axe I rule!” echoing in the night As Kull became king  Heroes walked tall in strange places  Hyboria was a living land to me  Countless others walked your worlds as well We still walk there and miss the creator-god Mr. Howard I see you working in the midst  Of the oil boom that made and nearly broke  Small town Texas where you grew and lived  You were a huge and strong man Paying attention to the physical as well As feeding your mind on the words of adventure Lovecraft, Doyle, London, Twain, Rohmer, Mundy,  Lamb, Haggard, Kipling, Scott, Bierce, Poe Their words and worlds aided you  You held your own in the ring prizefighter Toed the line with the worst Texas had to show Admire the strong defiant ones I wish to shake your hand as I stand over your grave I hate Hollywood’s murder of the mighty Conan Would you recognize the Cimmerian The barbarian they made of the King of Aqulionia  For a dozen years your fountain flowed Outward to the “pulps” While you were so much more Born to a world too old for you A notably noble savage forced  Into civilization barely  Wanting this life  Gifting it to your mother Whom you cared for  cried for  died for  Mr. Howard, did you speak aloud the note  Those final words you quote The Underwood a tombstone Keys caressed and  Pounded by your fingers no more  “All fled, all done  So lift me on the pyre. The feast is over  And the lamps expire.”  Did the paper rustle in the wind As you walked out to the car With the borrowed .380  Mr. Howard, what crossed your mind  As you placed the cold steel to your head  Did you enter the Grey Lands Did Crom weigh your soul  At the end of your eight hours dieing?  “Robert Ervin Howard (1906-1936) ranks among the greatest writers of action and adventure stories. The creator of Conan the Cimmerian, Kull of Atlantis, Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, ‘El Borak,’ Sailor Steve Costigan and many other memorable characters, Howard,… in a career that spanned barely 12 years, wrote well over a hundred stories for the pulp magazines of his day. While he is widely regarded as the ‘father of Sword and Sorcery’ and the creator of Conan the Barbarian, this reputation has been something of a double-edged sword. It has helped keep his work in the public eye for six decades since his death, but it has also obscured the astonishing breadth of his imagination, his talent for mastering a variety of genres and his ability to weave his magic in both prose and poetry.”  BENT.  *the first quote is the last thing Robert E. Howard wrote, left in his typewriter.     The second quote comes from a biography of Howard written by Rusty Burke.  More can be found at: http://www.rehupa.com .

      Check this out, I got this from my friend Anthonie, I have already shared my two cents with Pizza Hut.  If you believe in the second ammendment to the United States Constitution I encourage you to speak up as well.  "Screw Pizza Hut" June 1, 2004  “Ronald B. Honeycutt, 38, who has a permit to carry a concealed weapon, says he's been delivering pizzas for 20 years and has always packed heat on the job,” reports WorldNetDaily.com (http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38726) today. At around 11 p.m. on May 17th, just after he had made a delivery in a high-crime neighborhood in Indianapolis, a dirtball confronted Honeycutt with a loaded 9 mm handgun. At that point, Honeycutt pulled out his own 9 mm from the back of his pants and fired 15 times, hitting the would-be robber at least 10 times, killing him.  Sounds like pretty good gun “control” to us. And dare we say, an awfully effective “deterrent.  Anyway, Honeycutt went back to his Pizza Hut store and called the cops. The cops have since determined that Honeycutt acted in self-defense and will not face criminal charges. Nevertheless  Pizza Hut fired him.  For violating a company policy against carrying firearms.  BRUSHFIRE ALERT: Now, let’s be honest here. Pizza Hut, as a private business, has the right to make such a rule and enforce it.  On the other hand, WE have the right to voice our objections to such a stupid rule and refuse to do business with them unless and until they change it.  And if you’d like to voice YOUR opinion about how Mr. Honeycutt was treated, you can call the Pizza Hut corporate office at 1-972-7700 or give them a “pizza” your mind by emailing them through their website at http://www.pizzahut.com/contact/feedback_other.asp  You can also quickly and easily locate the Pizza Hut franchise store near you - along with their phone number - by going to: http://www.pizzahut.com/locator/.  I just called the store in my neighborhood and spoke with the manager. I explained that my family would no longer be dining in her restaurant and why. The woman’s response was, “You should call the corporate office. That incident in Indiana has nothing to do with us.” To which I responded, “Well, it does now. ‘Cause you just lost a customer over it. Maybe YOU should call the corporate office.  Something tells me she will...  Chuck Muth President Citizen Outreach www.citizenoutreach.com  Like I said, I am just reprinting an email forwarded to me.  Hope you all tell Pizza Hut off for me and for Ron Honneycutt.

      Well now, it has truly been an interesting few days since last I posted here.  Those who have talked to me know that I have a girlfriend now.  It is entirely too long a story to tell here.  But that is OK.  The best way for me to express it is to say that today when I talked to her on the phone, she said she loved me.  That made my day, hell, my week, year, life.  I don't plan on letting this girl get away, unless she really wants to.  Anyway, that's enough sappy lovetalk from me.  Perhaps I should throw a poem on here as well, to wash the sappy taste away.  So here goes...I call it   "Storm's Peace"  Small boy wandering the streets alone It's a small town in winter Shovel jauntily thrown across his shoulder Snow falls heavy and fat on the ground Hunter orange cap bobs with excited steps Streetlight makes the world a snow globe The boy shrugs his grey and blue coat Snow settles deep on a driveway The battered shovel swings down Someone's driveway feels steel scrape Pushing a shovel too big brings aches Down the road another walk is covered Shovel returns to shoulder Another streetlight creates another eternal scene The boy pauses at lights edge and looks An owl calls from a power pole Another walk calls the intrepid boy onward Silence crowds close not deafening just murmuring Homemade denim pants become snow caked Giant evergreens collect their white cloak The boy is frozen not by cold not by fear A rumble begins almost in the ground Sneakers in snow pivot the boy Snowplow crests the hill pushing with a chiming chain Eyes full of innocence and awe watch the rumbling jangling shovel The owl flies away A dog barks And the weary boy slings the shovel over his shoulder And begins his walk home Growing in ways he can't know yet   Bent  It comes from my childhood, winters in Flaming Gorge, most notably in Dutch John are beautiful.  The poem is third person about me as a boy and an expierience I had one night shoveling snow for the fun of it. Snowfall has always been comforting to me.   Well noble readers, I bid you good night.  You will also note that I have removed a previous posting.  having said what I did, I no longer feel a need to share it with the internet surfing world.  But I do want you all to remember this, a Nickel's worth of wisdom isn't worth what you paid for it. Fenris

      well now folks, I am cooking up a real doozey of a post and I hope you can all abide a little poetry again as I prepare a good solid well thought out and planned, pre written post that will have a definite begining and end, and some good stuff in between, but until then, you will have to content yourselves with this bit of filler I wrote and reworked a hundred times.&nbsp; I was once told to provide the answer in the poem, but that isn't the point.&nbsp; read on to find out what the point truly is...  Look for me  If you watch, carefully, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might see me. I am the silent one, slipping between people. If you listen, quietly,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might hear me. I am he who is not missed, unheard by man. If you close your eyes in the silence,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might feel me. I am mist, my touch, as a feather, seldom felt. If you breathe, deeply,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might smell me. I am the scent of empty, the odor of alone.  I circle you and your friends, slipping between, and gone I am invisible if you look, silent if you listen, texturless to feeling, Odorless to bloodhounds. You’ll never find me if you seek.

      Been a while since I shared a little ill conceived poetry with you all.&nbsp; This is called   autobiographical   Look ye and behold  The twinning beast  None like it in this world   Two halves wound round one soul  A creature of anger and honor  A child of fear   In juxtaposed heart  Emotion encased in logic  Encased in feeling   Fire captivates it  Burning in blind eyes  With deep fear of flame   A creature divided  Wanting to consume  Fearing the consumption   A diabolical paradox  Hungry wolf  Or naught but man   Fenris

      Well kids, I had a thought last night as I drove home from playing games with some friends.&nbsp; Now it was either the sleep deprivation or I was really on to something.&nbsp; We played a game called “Munchkin” last night.&nbsp; The explanation of what it entails would take entirely too much room for posting here.&nbsp; However, I must partially explain so that you get where I am going.&nbsp; Munchkin is a satire on roleplaying, most notably power gaming, or munchkining.&nbsp; But all that aside, there is a card in the deck featuring an item called the “+3 Really Impressive Title.”&nbsp; Now with many items in the game, you have a gold value attached to the item, see if you sell 1000 gold worth of items, you go up a level.&nbsp; The impressive title has no value though.&nbsp; Alas, we finaly get to my point.&nbsp; Titles really have no value.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; A title is nothing more than empty words.&nbsp; Some examples:&nbsp; Duke, Count, Archbishop, Lord, Mayor, President, Graduate.&nbsp; See, all of those things are just words.&nbsp; Show me a picture of what they represent, you can not, not without putting a person in the picture and that person is not the title.&nbsp; They represent one individual member of the human race. Now here is the shocker, that is all they are.&nbsp; Anything else is a title, an empty word attached to a person.&nbsp; In the past, some people thought you could buy titles.&nbsp; Today, in America, you can buy advertising spots which, if you buy enough advertising spots, you can buy a political office that comes with a title.&nbsp; Titles used to grant certain privileges.&nbsp; Some people still think so.&nbsp; Titles used to mean that the title holder was better than other people, those without titles.&nbsp; Some people still believe this, two stunning examples I have seen with my own eyes are in my religion and higher education.&nbsp; First, I want to talk about the particular title in my religion that irks me.&nbsp; The title of “Returned Missionary” bothers me.&nbsp; Now some of you will find this odd because I am a holder of this title.&nbsp; The reason that I find myself irked, is that it seems to carry weight that it shouldn’t.&nbsp; it is a title, just that, empty words.&nbsp; It doesn’t tell anyone what kind of man or woman a person is, those things are shown in a body’s actions, not in a title.&nbsp; It isn’t even an accurate reflection of what the person saddled with the title has done.&nbsp; Believe me, I was out there with many missionaries, I saw their actions, I watched how they treated each other and other people.&nbsp; I saw arrogance and deceit and evil every bit as black and ugly as any I ever saw among the rest of humanity.&nbsp; I also saw greatness.&nbsp; Don’t get me wrong, I am no saint, and I am not casting stones.&nbsp; You see, just like any other title, Returned Missionary means nothing.&nbsp; The character of an individual is not, I repeat NOT wrapped up in a title.&nbsp; Now as for the other group, higher education, they at least go so far as to provide a piece of paper suitable for framing.&nbsp; But the thing is, without that paper, your opinion doesn’t count.&nbsp; Without that paper, without that title, you have no intellectual value.&nbsp; In a college class I recently completed, I was told to write a paper giving my analysis of a work of literature.&nbsp; I was also instructed to cite other critics that supported my criticism.&nbsp; I encountered a problem, no critics read the work the way I did, nor did anyone draw any similar conclusions.&nbsp; So, when I wrote my paper, my criticism was not valid because I did not cite any critics who had their framed bits of paper on their den walls. &nbsp;Imagine that, when I get my piece of paper, I will have a valid and educated opinion.&nbsp; Until then I must rely on aping smart peoples opinions.&nbsp; Bullshit.&nbsp; I think that is about all that I have to say about that.

      Well folken, here I find myself, reading information on the internet about meeting people.&nbsp; I figure what the hell, I was honest in my add, maybe everyone else will be too.&nbsp; If not then it will be a real gas seeing what kind of responses I get.&nbsp; Any way, there is a certain book that I have been reading that I felt I should share with you all.&nbsp; The title is  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  It was lent to me by some of my best friends.&nbsp; Hey, they let me play with their kids, how cool is that?&nbsp; Any way, the book provokes thought by presenting new ways to think and some really amazing description to go with the deep thoughts.&nbsp; I think I am a hundred pages or so into it, and rapidly going nowhere, but not due to disinterest, mostly due to vast and almost overwhelming absorption.&nbsp; It has drawn me in.&nbsp; I am reading five other books at the same time just to keep from withdrawing into the book.&nbsp; All in all, I really just want to say thanks to David and Jody (hope I spelled your name right) I love you guys, thanks for your friendship.&nbsp; And thanks to all the rest of you out there that stick with me in the crazy times as well as the sane.&nbsp; The Sandman reminded me of what friendship is worth and what it really means.&nbsp; So you all get a virtual dugonut as soon as I learn how to attach them to emails.&nbsp; Be cool, be smart, and if you hear a howl, it's just me.&nbsp;

      Yup, it's a two post night, what ever will you do?  Read them both, that's usualy a good start.  I have been thinking story ideas and dreams recently, and mostly now that things are back to normal, I have been working on a few pieces of writing that have been neglected by me.  I will soon have a bit of Correspondance to send off to be rejected by the fellas over at Weird Tales.  With a little hope, I will get actual feed-back rather than the usual form rejection.  But we shall see, my first submission is a little thing I call "The Three."  Those who have hread about this, yeah I know, It is about time I got off my duff and thrashed it out and sent it in.  Only two of you have read it and the rest of you are in the dark.  Let me sum it up this way, normaly I have dispariging things to say about my own work, but this one has true potential.  It's cool too.  That would have to be because I don't feel as though I wrote it so much as recorded it.  The story has haunted me since the ninth grade.  I have written and rewritten it in at least four variations and twice that number of revisions.  Now that little dragon on my shoulder whispers that it is time to share it with the world, and we shall see, we shall see.

      **DISCLAIMER**  This post will include a few "bad" or "dirty" words.  Being a lover of the English language, I find it sad that we judge words on an individual basis, believe me, a writer worth his salt can offend and be vulgar and foul without ever touching the five or six "bad, dirty" words.  But anyway, I thought I should prepare you, so when you get to the bad part, just close your eyes while you get to the bad words. See how easy it is. The alternative is to censor my post, and rob it of its meaning and leave what I have to say pointless and asinine. With that in mind, read on o impressionable ones, read on.  I had a thought today on my way home from seeing the movie "Dodgeball."  The show was a hoot, kinda boring story line, but fun in that multi-level mockery sort of way.  Anyway, the idea that came to me was this, now bare with me, it relates to an aspect of baseball.  Every interaction you have with another person in this life is a game of catch.  Be it as simple as the simple toss, catch, toss of saying "hello" in the morning to a stranger; or the more involved game played with your boss and co-workers.  The right game of catch can last forever, and you will always be learning more about the person you are chucking the ball with.  Some folks like to throw like they are Nolan Ryan, closing a perfect game, a lot of fastballs and change-ups, with the occasional curve to keep the batter guessing.  Other folks like the soft game of catch like two friends at the end of the day tossing the ball back and forth, good throw for good throw.  Sometimes you find the odd relationship that reflects the father/son game of catch: one patient person throwing slow for another person who is, in all actualy a really shitty throw.  Now, if you have been playing catch for a while and you are still a shitty throw, you had better go find another shitty throw to play with, because a father plays catch with his son to teach him to throw better.  If the son never catches on, the games of catch will end.  Additionally, prolonged games of catch teach you how your buddy likes to throw the ball, and how he likes the ball thrown.  This usually comes about because of communication between the two folks tossing the ball back and forth.  If you are playing catch with a Nolan Ryan type and he keeps throwing the heat, but you don't like it, speak up, perhaps your buddy will calm down his throw.  If you are tossing the ball with a really shitty throw, provide pointers on how to throw better.  It is only through discussion and watching how the other person throws that you will ever improve your games of catch.  But ultimately you must at some point discover how you throw and what you like to catch.  But don't over think it.  You need to remember that line from "The Rookie"  When Morris walks into the locker room and says to Brooks, "You know what we get to do today Brooksie?  We get to play baseball."  after all, it really is just a game of catch.  This has been Fenris the Poet, saying to you, Find truth in what you already have, because you won't find it in something you haven't got.

      When a dream dies, we find ourselves watching a sad, horrid, final process.  Dreams usualy die when they starve from lack of hope, sometimes they are smothered between slices of reality.  But the most truly saddening is when we must take that dream and kill it ourselves.  When we find ourselves repeating cliches to asuage our guilt at the murder we just preformed... I have recently driven a final stake through the heart of a longtime dream.  When you find yourself killing things that you had held close to the heart, well, you feel as though you've become the ultimate betrayer.  So be it.  The truth is, the cuts scar over, the heart mends and you go on.  But in some instances the future holds nothing of the dream you had, and ghost-like afterimages and half measures to keep out the bitter winds, are better left out.  So it is with this dream, I can not have staked so much of myself, so much of what I am on what turned out to be a pipe-dream.  So, in retrospect, promises of continued friendship where lies.  The chance of holding on to a sad ghost of what I once felt will not be good or healthy.  So at this juncture, the Wolf (that's me) will grin and cry to the moon one last time as she takes her path and he takes his.    Why the Lone Wolf Calls  I walk the bluing world As the sun slides  Below the jagged rim of Earth All stretches into shadow Blue and black Shadow on shadow on shadow  Inches Yet miles deep As Earth’s eye closes  In twilight sleep My mistress climbs  The even-sky  Her form is full And purest white Above jagged peaks  My cry to her  Ripped from my throat It echoes   I alone Hunt To offer my mistress Sustenance in sacrifice  Crying for her Join me love Join me 		Fenris  The fable I've constructed here has an end, though few will like it.  The moon can not condecend to meet the wolf, and no matter how high our dear wolf climbs he shall never meet the moon.  And so the wolf will cease to cry for his moon.  The dream he held has been killed, and blood drips from the wolf's fangs.  For the truth is seldom pretty and real life is naught but pain.  But the wolf will run and he will cry out in anger and in fear and with pain, but never to the moon again, never. Well friends, this has been Fenris the Poet coming to you all with truth in fiction, feelings in prose and honesty in poetry. This is for the moon and all she represents.

      Well now you little postaholics, bet you never expected to run into a new post already.  It is sufficent to say, I am trying to keep my mind busy, very busy.  Some are no doubt shaking their heads wondering when my poor little brain isn’t busy with too many things to process.  Well, that’s true, and I usually let it run and run, but this time, there are some ideas and thoughts that I don’t want to dwell on.  But all that is beside the point.  When I got home from work today, my folks had gotten home from my brother’s retirement ceremony.  He’s retired/retiring from the air force.  That too is beside the point, I know, I know, get on with it already, well here you go.  My dad was watching one of my all time favorite movies, The Rookie, about that teacher that goes to the Major Leagues in his forties.  I am a sap I know, but when he gets called up, and he has that look of joy… well, it reminds me that dreams do come true.  The story of Jim Morris and his rise to the major leagues is the story of baseball.  For those who don’t know (I manage to keep it pretty well hidden) I am a huge fan of baseball.  It is a sport that grew out of the most difficult time this country has ever gone through, the American civil war.  Baseball is America to me.  I don’t know exactly how to express how I feel about it.  Baseball is not a game I watch on TV, and it has been a long time since I followed my favorite team (Atlanta) during the season.  But I will always stop and watch a few minutes of a little league game, or maybe an inning or two on TV.  I really don’t watch much TV so most of the time I run into a game it’s live.  I remember buying Topps cards with the chewing gum with the cards.  I also remember cutting my mouth on that same gum, from the fifties I think.  Once I even managed to blow a bubble with some of it, four or five packs went into that bubble if I remember correctly, and I got a Tony Gwynn.  I remember playing ball my junior year of high school.  Something about that uniform, having it on made me feel right.  I honestly think that a baseball jersey is one of the classiest looking shirts in the world.  Now if you have been paying attention, you have already realized, I never ever claimed to be any good at playing baseball, heck, I’m not very good at slow pitch softball.  But that is all beside the point.  I own a ball glove, and I have a few baseballs kicking around.  There is nothing in this world like a game of catch with a friend.  The feel of letting the ball fly, the sharp snap of a baseball in a well used glove, the sound of summer.  Satisfaction is to be had in a game of catch.  I don’t know if I have gotten anything across here except I am more than a little verbose and I like baseball.  I really like baseball.  I like what it used to mean and what it means.  So I guess that this whole post is dedicated to the boys of summer, from Babe Ruth to Hank Aaron, from Jackie Robinson to Nolan Ryan.  To the day I saw Mark Maguire knock number 62 out of the park.  To those guys who tried and failed, like Mr. Manning, my ninth grade English teacher.  To Jimmy Morris.  To a six year old some where breaking in his first glove. To an old man who played ball as a young man just home from World War Two.  To any one who has held that little white ball, swung a bat, or caught heard and felt the snap as their glove closes around the ball.  To baseball, to summer, to youth, to dreams.

      Tonight, well, I guess that I am thinking about the diverse things that draw us to other people. This comes directly on the heels of getting involved with a second job, and rediscovering that the whole social thing isn't hard, just distasteful. I especially find the social LDS Singles Ward/Institute setting to be particularly distasteful. Its not because everyone plays up all false, I honestly believe that it stems from the fact that they all seem to think that the only kind of fun available that is clean is juvenile fun. Where boys can flirt like they are still in first grade on the playground during recess. You remember, they knocked over the girl that they liked. Anyway, I ran into this girl (not litteraly, no pun intended) that I want to know more about. She came in to the shop asking if we could just check the fluid levels on her car. So, because she's kinda cute, I jump at the opportunity. Yeah, I'm like that. The reason that I want to know more about her though, is because she was dressed modestly and she had Converse Allstars on! Chuck Taylor's Converse Allstars! The Shoe That Separates the Cool from the Uncool. If you have owned a pair of allstars, you're cool. If you haven't, well, I don' t think we can be friends any more. What's even cooler is that the shoes fit with her overall style. She just had that cool vibe going. I don't know how to explain it. So I won't even try. Thanks for reading, and if you have some feedback for me, my email is now listed in my profile to the right. Just a few short clicks away is the ability to tell me to shut up. Or you could encourage me. Either way, I will still be here tomorrow.

      Well now, here we are again. I promised one that I had thought out before hand, so here you all go. I hope that you are able to discover something from what I have to say here. But before I launch into the meat of the post, I have a bit of business to share out. First, there will be no first hand experiences in this post, none. All that I discuss I have gleaned from my observations. Secondly, this has nothing to do with a recently terminated relationship (if you want to call it that, in the end it seemed more like bullshit to me) it has to do with a new level of understanding opening in my mind about romantic love. And now, on with the show as those of us in the business say sometimes, when we need to. Love, what is it, how does one fall into it, and why does it feel more like something you step in? As far as what love is, love is understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness. Those three words imply sacrifice. Understanding is the highest and truest aspect of love. Understanding is knowledge of what someone is. The next part of love is acceptance. Acceptance is what we are capable of because we understand something about the person we love. We are therefore capable of accepting things that we may not understand about them. Now, riding on the coat tails of acceptance is forgiveness. Why forgiveness? Because I don't care who you are, you will find aspects of your love that you can neither understand, nor accept, but, for love of that person, you will forgive those shortcomings. You will forgive because you understand what they can become, because you accept them for who they are and who they are trying to become. You will forgive them because you have honest love for them. Now, let us discuss a phrase that seems to confuse entirely too many people. Here it is: "I am in love with (insert name here)." Now, the key word in that phrase in not  love  it is not the name of the love, the most important word in that sentence is  with ! Why? Because the word  with  implies, virtual creates a duality of beings in love. Timmy can not in in the hot tub with Tina if Tina is not in the hot tub with Timmy. Likewise, Timmy's misguided affection for Tina is not love if it is not shared by Tina. You can not be in love with someone that is not in love with you. It is impossible. Love is a shared thing. If two people aren't involved, it ain't love. Sorry, but it isn't possible to share something with someone who doesn't share the same thing with you too. It isn't love, it is a sad devotion to a idea or an ideal version of the other person that doesn't exist. So, we can extrapolate from the discussion so far that Love in it's romantic sense is not a two way street, nor is it a bridge in spite of what those Judd chicks said in their song. It ain't a rope, a path, a connection, a cable, it can't tie, bind or hold in any way. Love is a mutual sacrifice. Too often it is like an old Sammy Hagar song lyric: "Well it's give and take and you just take and I can't take it you see." I am sure that everyone has been on one side or the other of this type of relationship. See, it's simple, like I said, love can't bee a connection, it's not a path or anything like that. Love has no material comparison, all attempts to compare love to a tangible thing will ring false. It is a binding of souls together, a melding. No fifty, fifty compromise. Love is giving one hundred percent of who and what you are, in exchange for one hundred percent of what your partner is. Any thing else in a relationship is deceitful. It is giving everything up for someone with no guarantee that they will do the same and finding out that they have. That's my opinion for what it's worth.  Fenris
