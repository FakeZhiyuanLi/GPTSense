      Website almost done. Free freelance work for my roommate. Working with one of my friends from school. We teamed up and together we helped my roomie, 3D Animator, come up with a concept and put it together. It will rock.  Lots of beer....

      Last day of classes for this mid summer session. Fall semester starting soon, can't wait, seriously. My girlfriend will be coming back to SF on the 16th. Can't wait to see her again.

      Everyone has an agenda, even I do with this post, I am looking for a certain outcome. Ever since Nixon and Watergate, more so since  JFK was assinated, america has looked at politics with skeptisim. The age of innosence was lost. This is my opinion.  Since that time there has been a steady decline in the confidence americans have in their politicians. Now I am not a political science major or claim to know much about politics. What upsets me is how hard it is to get a TRUE unbiased information. Most if not all media in it's many forms has an underlining agenda or bend to a certain political view and idiology. Granted there are programs out there like NPR that just state the facts, but who knows.  Since elections are coming around the bend I just want a source to do research on that is not biased. Every media outlet wants to be looked at as unbiased and true but most are not. It is all comerical crap that is carefully selected for our viewing pleasure. I don't care what your political views are but Rep., Dem., Green, they all SUCK!  I live in a heavily democratic area, San Francisco, where to have any other outlook on current politics other than Bush sucks and should be stoped, is to be an idiot and not know what you are talking about. On the other hand if you talk to a Rep. they defend him or sympithise with you but assure you that the other side is worse.  I just hate the whole "us and them" take on politics. I don't believe in a utopian socitey but it sure would be nice to just have some peace. But is that even realistic? There will always be a need to rise to the top, lead, compete, jealousy, greed, just the basics of all of us humans will keep a utopian socitey from being a reality. So that is not the answer, someone must lead.  Since a young age I have realized that when voting it is just who is the lesser of two evils. Or you can vote on the issues, but really can you be assured that they will be carried out? I think not.  Please someone shed some light on this....
