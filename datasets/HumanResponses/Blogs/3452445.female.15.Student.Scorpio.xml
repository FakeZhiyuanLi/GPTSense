      sitting there, reading my ramblings, do u ever wonder what life would be like if we were teronized people?  if we were known through out the world as cowards, and the kind of people that give in and give up?  so many people have died for this country, to make it its own country, to make it ONE united country, to keep all its people safe from wrong doers.  to keep the american way, and to help others.  this morning i went out in the rain and climbed some randomn tree by the pond. i layed on one of the branches and began thinking- would i actually be here- would this tree be here, if one decision was made differently in the making of our country? my mind started to wander, i cought myself and scowlded myself for drifting off such an important topic, as that of the brave men who fight, on their own will, and give the ultimate sacrifice for others, and for those who would have given the ultimate sacrifice- but instead watched friends die, wishes die, and probably what seemed like the whole world; die.  God Bless America  p.s i try to write these as moving as i can, to get people to think and reflect on what they do and say- i  know i know i probably am not doing it right now, but practice makes perfect.  comments would be appreciated greatly!

      so many insults go out to teens and kids who are involved, or are interested in politics.  i might not be up on all the issues but i sure as hell know a bad president when i see one.  busch really should NOT be in office, he is the STUPIDEST president, without any doubt.  i dont even know where to start with him!!  how bout when he made a speech in one of the states- he begins on this issue with iraq with this statement *in a woopsie doopsie voice* "so where are those weapons of mass destruction?" then everyone laughs and claps, how many brave men have died because that moron said that there were definetly weapons of mass destruction in that country??  over 600 brave innocent men have died.    dear ol' georgie wimped outta vietnam- now hes playing big bad boy- of course he doesnt have to go out there, he doesnt know what its like, he doesnt know what its like knowing ur parents are at home worrying about you, he doesnt know jack shit about war, except how to get outta service.  (kerry served, and know what its like there, so he can sympathize with troops and GIVE THEM THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE)  there are jeeps out there in iraq armored by bullet proof vests glued onto the vehicle, since senor jorge isnt getting them money or proper equipment.  george jr. went into office for the soul purpose of finishing daddies legacy, and getting revenge on sadam for trying to kill daddy.  9/11 first thing he says "what chance is there that iraq had something to do with this?" OSAMA BIN LADEN thinks sadam shamed their religion by shaving his mustache okay, and thats only one reason why he hates him, they just coincidently hate the U.S. their not the only country! and we cant start war just on that. the weapons of mass destruction- IRAQ wouldnt do JACK SHIT against us cuz they know we would send one of our nooks over there and blow up the whole damn country. it was not our place, to liberate the country.  the surrounding countries~ they should be in there, they speak their language, they practice their religion ~ and were not talking about the radicals here ~ and they definetly wouldnt have the same problems as us- like the prison scandal- as said by jon stewart of "the daily news" on comedy central: "sadam's torture prisons aren't really shut down- just under new management"  i think its wonderful that the iraqi people are liberated- but excuse me- they hate us now, we are the enemy, and i would agree with them that we are the bad guys.  in the 'end of the world' web site thing, the u.s says something, that definetly fits now and that is "fuck, were dumbasses" we are in deep shit, and george is not gonna be able to get us out of it.     BACK TO 9/11 we shoulda taken care of the people that did and ARE plotting against us- they are our real threat, just because the president has people making sure that there is no way he can get hurt, doesnt mean we all do! and us innocent pedistrians are the one al quida is aiming at!!   make iraq safe, after we are safe from our biggest threat, who has proven they CAN and WILL do ne thing to hurt us.  and i know that osama isnt the only one running a terrorist network, but they have hit us, and hit us hard and they cant get away with that.  IM JUST RAMBLING NOW, ILL EDIT LATER WITH MORE INFORMATION AND BETTER PUT TOGETHER SENTENCES  in the mean time- VOTE KERRY!!

         okay, so i was thinking about Brittney Spears, (not in that way!!!) and she's really not as bad as everyone says she is. and its some what ridiculous to say "i dont like her but i like her music"    she actually is writing some of her stuff now, which is a big improvement and thus makes her more of an artist, instead of a corporation.    her sluttiness... yeah not a good example for little girls, but come on she's growing up, and if you think about it, you would do the kind of videos she does, and dress the same way she does too.  her body sells, and she needs to make money just like the rest of us, shes not prostituting herself, shes just flaunting her stuff, and face it, if you looked like that, you wouldnt be running around with big t-shirts and baggy sweat pants.    the dances- come on i dance worse than that!! my birthday party? sha- and if u can believe it, i've learned worse since than.  Most of us could do a damn decent strip-tease.  We would show off like that for our lover, and her lover is her audience.    the 55 hour marriage- BACK OFF OMG!! how many people go to Vegas and get married for LESS time??  thats what vegas is all about, i would go just to see how many marriages and divorces i could get in one weekend!  i think it must have been a slow celebrity gossip week for them to make such a big deal out of it seriously.  ~ and at least she married someone she KNOWS!    guess what? she has feelings too.  my opinion on her really changed when she said in an interveiw "there is no cool bone in my body" shes self-conscious just like the rest of us.  sure she REALLY has no reason to be but shes human!!!   the national enquirer can kiss my ass first of all, second of all, im guessing the shit they say gets to her.  i heard a few rumors she wanted to have a baby and kill herself in her "everytime?" video, just to give the public what they "want."  i say stay strong brittney!!  question- how does lil kim get away with dressing WAY worse than brittney and yet no one calls her a whore? come on pasties!!! she gets made fun of for being so trashy, but no one says what a skank she really is- does race have something to do with this? dont get me wrong, im not prejudice, im just noticing a fact, but i do think pasties are a wee bit too far, save those for...not the public!

      "its a womans body let her decide what to do with it"...thats really nice...so apparently im apart of my mothers body...and wouldnt she then still have the same right to kill me? ~why doesnt this apply for before she had sex?  she could have used birth control to prevent the child all together so she didnt have to kill it at least.  if it has a freaking beating heart-ITS ALIVE YOU IDIOTS! just because its in what was once thought of the safest place, in its mothers womb, doesnt mean u can KILL THE CHILD  the choice is before not after- for God's sake take responsibility for what you do.  By killing the result of ur actions when its youngest, when it doesnt have a voice.  The kid doesnt get a chance to live... and if uve ever seen a video of an abortion being performed...u would see that u can NOT do that, the "embryo" has a face, and its frowning when they suck it out.  Or when they use a needle- the baby avoids it...it has more common since then its mother!  45,953,839 babies have been killed since Roe v. Wade
