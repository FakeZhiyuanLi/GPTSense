       ANNOUNCEMENT   Good and attentive CPW readers!  Mission accomplished.  I have had my fun with Berkeley's forever-just-fledgling conservative community and their treasured rag.  But it is time to move on to bigger, much better things.  I am ditching this narrowly-focused California Patriot Watch blog, in favor of a broader, all-purpose blog instead.  If the  Patriot  ever updates their site (never certain), I might just see the need to critique aspects of it from my new blog.  Plus, my impending departure to Santa Barbara makes me a lot more likely to deal with local issues there rather than here.  Oh, and what's the new blog gonna be?  It's called:   urlLink The Facts Machine   (http://factsmachine.blogspot.com)  Check it out!  Thanks!  Go Bears!  Go Gauchos!  Go Everybody!

        PATRIOT  HILARITY ON SIMON, DAVIS   Looking at Mr. Ratliff's piece on  urlLink Bill Simon and Gray Davis , a couple of sentences jumped out at me:   Therefore, Davis has sought to raise as much money as possible to viciously attack anyone that opposes him...    This was evident when Davis spent an unprecedented $10 million dollars assailing the centrist Richard Riordan during the Republican Primary- a race the democrat Davis should not have been involved with at all.   Second part first...   So Davis shouldn't have been running ads against his potential Republican opponents during primary season, that's an arguable ethical point that could go either way, fair enough.  But gee golly, such a strategy is good enough for Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who attacked Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill McBride in TV ads during the primary season there.  If it's good enough for the Jebster, why not Gray?  Hey  Patriot , contact the folks at the "Seminole Review" or the "Hurricane Patriot" or something and tell them to denounce Jeb for using the exact same tactics.  Now the first part...  Political Novice Alert!... The two sentences directly contradict eachother!  Riordan is described by Ratliff as a "centrist", as opposed to the conservative Simon.  Davis spent money to attack the candidate who opposed him LESS.  Allow me to clue Ratliff in.   The name of the game here, as any wise observer would know, is that both Davis and Jeb Bush attempted to pick their opponents for the general election .  Davis wanted to pick off Riordan so he could face a "garden-variety conservative", Simon, in November.  Jeb Bush, down in the Sunshine State, wanted to attack Bill McBride (who has bested Bush in some head-to-head polls in recent weeks/months) so he could face former Attorney General Janet Reno who, while a worthy candidate, has a lot of baggage (not all of which is her fault).   The thing is, Republicans in California and Democrats in Florida should both be able to see through this sort of cynical nonsense.   They should deduce that the sitting governors are attacking certain candidates because those candidates pose the largest threat to defeat them.  Did Florida Dems do this?  Yes, they saw through it (with the help of some effective McBride ads bringing all this up), and nominated Bill McBride to go up against Jeb in what looks like an exciting, to-the-wire race.  On the other hand, did California Republicans do this?  Well no, they listened to Davis' ads, and nominated Bill Simon, even though Riordan was Dubya's hand-picked, blessed candidate, as well as a proactive, popular mayor in Los Angeles.   This proves, if anything at all, that Florida Democrats are smarter than California Republicans!  Put that in your butterfly ballot and smoke it! (:   p.s. Congratulations to "successful businessman" Bill Simon for finding a conservative lackey judge to toss out the fraud conviction.  Hey Bill, maybe you and I can move in together and be domestic partners!

      From the AP wire:   urlLink Jewish settlers suspected of bombing Palestinian school   But of course, this was just a few extremists, not indicative of the whole, and this sort of thing is bound to happen amid such conflict and desperation... Hmm that's a rationale I've heard before...

        PATRIOT , MEET JOE MCCARTHY   Freedom of speech, it's a bitch, isn't it?  The truth is,  Patriot , that if you really want to celebrate American values, and if you really want to exude true patriotism, then you, my friends, need to celebrate every single word said by those with whom you disagree, whether it be Shingavi or anyone else.  Unfortunately, the Patriot's " urlLink news analysis " of the 9/11 events shows us, on their part, a level of tolerance of dissent that rivals the Ayatollah (one of Ronald Reagan's favorite business partners).  One line that had me dusting off my makeup kit to bust out my Khmer Rouge:   ...the term 'student voices' does, in no way, encourage, necessitate, or justify the eruption of politically charged speeches or  dissident behavior  which occurred. (italics Brendan's)   Did I just read the phrase 'dissident behavior'?  Next thing you know, the  Patriot  is going to publish a list of names.  Eight years of conservatives trying not only to blame President William Jefferson Clinton for any and every problem on the globe, but also to relentlessly assault Clinton with baseless accusations about his personal and professional life, and suddenly criticizing Bush is considered 'dissident behavior'?  The  Patriot  either has an incredibly short memory or an incredibly large pair of cojones.  I'm starting to see what looks like a childish obsession that the  Patriot  has with Snehal Shingavi.  Because they're such an immature and uninformed publication, the boys and girls at the  Patriot  know that the only fight they could possibly, possibly win, as conservatives, is against the most extreme elements of the Berkeley left that there are.  Snehal was right about the 12th being a day of war rhetoric from Dubya.  However, he didn't even have to wait that long.  Bush's speech at Ellis Island on the night of the 11th was a somber requiem for about 90 seconds, and then suddenly veered into very thinly-veiled words of war on Iraq.  Just a couple days after the Administration admitted that there is no link between Hussein and Al Qaeda, Bush had them joined at the hip in his speech.  Indeed, this was a "politically charged speech" on 9/11.  So  Patriot , if you are consistent in any way, you must also add some critical words for Bush's politicization of 9/11, right next to Snehal and anyone else.  Nevermind the planned Cheney appearance on Limbaugh, hehe.  Something wrong with the United Nations flag?  Guess you've been reading too many of those "Left Behind" books!  Two facts: 1) The UN headquarters is in... New York!, and more importantly, 2) people from many different countries died in the September 11th attacks, not just Americans.  But above all that, perhaps the flag was there in mourning.  This past year has given America the best chance it has had in a long time to become a fully responsible member of the global community, but now we see arrogance all over the place; Bush's unilateral Iraq rhetoric, not even the slightest push for renewable energy sources and alternative fuels from this administration, our continuing oil addiction, continued nose-thumbing at the Kyoto treaty, I could go on.  If the  Patriot  wants to criticize people for not being "responsible", they need look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania.  The "analysis" did get one thing exactly right.  The events described in the piece do constitute "typical Berkeley style".  For almost 40 years, UC Berkeley has been an institution where the questioning of both assumptions and authority has been strongly encouraged, and this was consistent with that spirit.  There were thousands of ceremonies across America that were somber and solemn, but at Berkeley that shoe doesn't quite fit, and the  Patriot  is just gonna have to live with that fact.

        PATRIOT  OUT OF CELLAR!   Congratulations,  Patriot !  You've been out-done in the defiling-9/11 race that it seemed you had in the bag.  Your childish priorities in memorializing 9/11 (putting flags and colors far ahead of the thousands of lost lives) have has certainly been pathetic and immature to quite an extent, but it is vice president HalliDick CheneyBurton who emerges from his "undisclosed location" to lap the field in this matter.  Cheney will be a guest wednesday morning with Rush Limbaugh, one of the most, if not THE most divisive, partisan, bigoted and mean-spirited person in all of the American media.  Consider that many of the thousands who died in the 9/11 attacks were the very people that Limbaugh rails against on a daily basis from his AM-radio pedestal, including liberals, feminists, homosexuals, foreigners, minorities and of course, many were Democrats.  Simply enough, this is a complete disgrace of the 2nd-highest elected office in the United States of America.  Shame on Cheney.  Of course, Cheney's not the only conservative to hideously politicize 9/11.  We at CPW recall Karl Rove's speech several months ago to Republican lawmakers and candidates, urging them to blatantly politicize the "war on terrah".  Once again, congratulations  Patriot , you are mere amateur hypocrites compared to professional hypocrites like our chicken-hawk VP.

       9/11 ANNIVERSARY UPDATE  (hit-and-run edition)   Semi-alert unnamed CPW reader with AIM screen-name "Kegger2003" has contested a small, slightly-relevant portion of my letter to the Patriot (see below).   After first referring to my blog as "pathetic" (a lovely gesture in its own right), he/she has directed me to the transcript of  Patriot  publisher Kelso Barnett's September 4th  urlLink speech to the Senate .  (perhaps they are the same person?  doesnt matter really)  (By the way, for Kegger2003's sake, I hope that his/her screen-name isn't Hawthornian in nature, if you catch my drift.)  First of all, Barnett's speech constitutes  a transcript, not any sort of journalistic article or piece , therefore the point I made in my letter (that the two pieces the  Patriot  produced on the current controversy made no references to the human tragedy of 9/11) remains completely intact.  The two articles did not make even a passing reference, but an item referred to as the transcript of an ASUC speech (and not an editorial column) did mention the "lives lost" . . . briefly . . . at the very end . . . snuck in . .  as something described by Barnett as apart from the central themes of the speech, the quick "not only" phrase just before the central "but also" phrase. And I should congratulate him for this?  Retract a claim in my letter that has NOT been refuted in any way?  Puh-leeze!  In the interest of fairness (something the  Patriot  is incredibly hazy about), let's just say we give Barnett and my anonymous online buddy the benefit of the doubt, and say that yes, the  Patriot  did reference the mass loss of humanity in the 9/11 attacks with the speech transcript...  That still does not excuse the two articles for such glaring omissions.  Reading through both articles, there are numerous points at which any legitimate reporter would have (and should have) mentioned that this is all going on because planes slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing thousands.  Why were there no direct references to the attacks in the articles?  There's a very simple reason:  Doing so would have underscored the seriousness, tragedy and humility that the events of a year ago spawned, and it would have rendered the flag and color-related hissyfit of a student-run conservative publication rather silly.   The  Patriot  doesn't want their views exposed for what they are, so naturally they sharply de-emphasized the human tragedy of 9/11 .  While the  Patriot  believed that they can get away with this in their two articles, Barnett's speech-- delivered to the ASUC senate, with its wide-ranging views and people who actually remember what happened on 9/11 --had to reference the "lives lost", but somehow get it in there quickly without it making their stance look "shameful, immature and unworldly", as I put it (again, see below).  So they sneak it in mighty quick, at the very end, as the insignificant front end of a conjuntive phrase.  Up to that point, the tone of this fellow's speech sounds as if we're planning Fourth of July events, and then the end hits us suddenly, almost bringing a sane reader/listener/senator to wonder "people died?"   Frankly, on Barnett's part, THAT is pathetic.   Kegger2003's AIM profile quotes The Sopranos.  I like The Sopranos (though nowhere near as much as Six Feet Under and Curb Your Enthusiasm).  Unfortunately, the Patriot's actions in this matter, as well as Kegger's quick hit-and-run departure, evoke the name of a certain character on The Sopranos from a while back...

       BRENDAN'S LETTER TO THE  PATRIOT    (when I hit "send" it displayed the page-is-unavailable thing, so perhaps it didn't work, nevertheless I'll post it here)   Patriot  writers,  Responding to your  urlLink staff announcement :  I will do my best not to have you count this letter among the "hate emails" you claim to be receiving.  If people are truly coarsening the dialog, they shouldn't be.  However, your crusade against UC Berkeley's 9/11 anniversary plans has sadly missed the overall point of remembering that day.  What makes it worse is that you do so by wrapping yourselves in the American flag, placing patriotic images and symbols ahead of the actual spirit of patriotism.  At the essence of remembering 9/11 are the thousands of lives that were lost on that terrible morning.  The more fuss that is raised about the presence of flags or the colors of ribbons on wednesday, the more that the men and women who died in the attacks are pushed into the background.  Neither of the your pieces regarding wednesday's events (from 9/4 and 9/6) even mention in passing the three thousand lives that were snuffed out a year ago.  9/11 was a human tragedy much more than it was a patriotic tragedy, and your priorities are shameful, immature and unworldly.  Finally, I should note that the reason we have a country to begin with is that back in the 18th century, a number of people behaved in a way the British perceived as not being "civil".  Thus, the sentiments of the your final paragraph are highly suspect.  They are even moreso when you consider the  Patriot's  idolization of Dick Cheney, a man who has no qualms about suggesting that those critical of the Bush regime are "unpatriotic".  Sincerely, Brendan Getzell California

       INACCURATE MIDTERM DISCLAIMER   The  Patriot  is partially Scaife-funded (see 9/5 entry), so technically Mr. Norman DOES hail from the department of Vast Right-Wing Conspirators.  Just thought I'd clear that up.

       SETH SPELLZ   I wont touch the actual content of Mr. Norman's  urlLink piece  on being a conservative in Berkeley.  But Seth did sneak another one past the copy editor:   From the looks of People�s Park, you�ve probably begun to wonder if Camp X-Ray hasn�t become overcrowded and the CIA is secretly shipping the Al-Queda to Berkeley.   Who or what is "Al-Queda"?  Is that some sort of Mexican micro-brewery? ("Would you like something to drink?  We have Al-kwaay-dah on tap...")  Mr. Norman atones, however, by somehow managing to spell "Greta van Sustren" correctly.  Perhaps because she's on the Faux "News" Channel.  Of course, who'd recognize her with all that eye work she's had done on her.  (fyi accepted spellings are "qaeda" and "qaida")

        PATRIOT  LIES & MISREPRESENTATIONS ON SHINGAVI   In their current  urlLink editorial  the  Patriot  has blatantly misrepresented Mr. Shingavi and his English 1A class in a variety of ways.  First, they contradict themselves.  The first line of the editorial reads   Conservative minds  are  not welcome even in the classroom at Berkeley, according to at least one graduate student instructor (emphasis Brendan's)   They ARE, you say?  Read a couple of paragraphs down and we find this:   ...the University... forced Shengavi to change his course description to include students of all ideologies   So suddenly present tense ("are") essentially becomes past tense (had been).  To compound the problem, the writer goes right back into present tense:   So, Snehal doesn't want conservatives in his precious class.   Does the  Patriot  even employ a copy editor?  According to their staff page, they employ one and a half of them (one of them is also a photographer... spontaneous joke: "a picture is worth a thousand words, and 995 of them are spelled wrong", hehe).  I can only assume, then, that the writers of the editorial saw their point as being more solid if Shingavi is referred to as still actively keeping conservatives out of his class, regardless of what the facts are.  The sentence in the original  urlLink course description  that caused the controversy was:   Conservative thinkers are encouraged to seek other sections.   Two points.  First of all, the editorial quotes the phrase "stay away", a complete falsehood, and yet another example of irresponsible journalism from the  Patriot .  This error is rendered even more egregious by their second use of "stay away" (in a mocking context) later in the editorial.    Secondly, the intent of the course is not to discuss the relative nobility of the cause of Palestinian liberation, but to explore, among other things, poetry and other forms of culture among the Palestinians.  Here's the pertinent comparison:  What Mr. Shingavi does not want is the equivalent of somebody enrolling in a class on Shakespeare to argue the merits of the British monarchy or colonialism.  The "departure point" in that case would be "Shakespeare was a good and historically noteworthy writer and poet".  For Shingavi, it is "Palestinian resistance culture exists".  He's not there to recruit.  The real motivation for conservatives in this issue is a desire not to have any sort of nuanced perspective on Palestinians presented anywhere, including in a small english course at Berkeley.  The mindless bleating of people like David Horowitz, essentially saying that all Palestinians can be summed up as child-killing terrorists, is surely indicative of this.  He and others (apparently including the  Patriot  staff) are afraid that people will view the Palestinians as actual, three-dimensional human beings.  The  Patriot 's piece on Israel from March is certainly in line with this sort of fear.

       NO  PATRIOT  IN WHOVILLE?   Regarding the  urlLink controversy  around 9/11 anniversary events organized by  urlLink UC Berkeley ...  First of all, I'm amused that the "national media", as the  Patriot  puts it, essentially means "Matt Drudge".  Yeah, that's some real integrity there.  The reporting the  Patriot  has done, whether they admit it or not, has a political agenda.  The thing is, their reporting produced two consequences, one was certainly intentional, but the other was not only unintended, but also serves to cheapen something that's supposed to be sacred.  The intentional part involves an ongoing narrative mythology that conservatives across the country have been trying to perpetrate for twenty years, being that the total ideological atmosphere of most American universities, including the students, faculty etc, has taken a dramatic turn to the left.  The right creates a bogus inferiority complex in universities just as they do in the media.  I could go on, but this is a short-attention-span blog, so we'll move on.  The unintended consequence?  I suppose it's well within the "character" of a publication called the Patriot to sell out to that grand American value: materialism!  Whatever you may think of the Berkeley student government's prior decisions, the  Patriot 's agenda puts the focus even more squarely upon colors and materials (the flag, representations of red/white/blue, etc), and as a result, so much less upon the staggering amount of humanity that was lost in those horrible atrocities.  For example, a video montage of the lost firefighters and cops with Bruce Springsteen's "Into the Fire" as the soundtrack would spark a  Patriot  writer to stand up and shriek "Where are the f****** flags?!?"   The country as an abstract concept didn't die; three thousand people, however, did, and that is at the center of what memorializing 9/11 is about.   This is a pathetic and immature mindset, and Chancellor Berdahl was right to say the things he did.  In Dr Seuss' "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", the citizens of Whoville knew that the spirit of Christmas was in their hearts and minds, and not encapsulated in material items.   If only the  Patriot  could learn that much about patriotism .

       FUN WITH "CONTROL-F"   Sometimes "too easy" just isn't enough.  I took a look at Mr. Barnes'  urlLink article  entitled "Israel: On Freedom's Side", and before I read it, I knew every word I was going to see.  So, because I'm a very busy man, I saved myself a little bit of time.  I hit control-F on my computer, and searched for a number of words in the piece, namely "occupation", "occupied", "settlement", "settler".  In all cases, no results.  Having saved much time, I went for a jog.  Do I deserve any congratulations for showing an outright pro-Israel bias in a clumsy conservative student publication?  Of course not, they'd admit they have one.  However, it should be noted that more experienced conservative commentators (such as at Buckley's old National Review, the namesake for so many conservative student papers around the country) will at least mention the issues of  urlLink occupation  and the  urlLink settlements , whether they agree or not.  The Patriot sets up a "red straw herring man" (so to speak), in representing the views of Students for Justice in Palestine (who are unrealistic and unconstructive certainly to a fault) as typical of anyone who doesn't back Israel 100 percent.  Those who are more informed about the current conflict certainly have a more nuanced opinion of the situation than the nonsense spewed by the  Patriot .  And hey, what if it was 1987, and this was a piece on the Apartheid governemnt of South Africa?  What a noble stance!  Sorry,  Patriot , but history is not on your side.

       PATRIOT DOUBLE-STANDARD ON SHOUTING?   Mr. McFadden's  urlLink piece  describing his view of the current state of free speech at UC Berkeley is certainly more focused on tactics than it is on issues, I'm sure he'd agree with such an asessment.  Sure, Robb is against the shouting-down of scheduled events so that certain people's views wouldn't be heard, and I certainly agree with him there.  So logic dictates that Robb must also condemn  urlLink this .  Yes, that's right, the Republican riot in Miami-Dade County in November of 2000, where hand recounts were taking place.  In this case, the deafening shouts of these men, combined with blunt physical intimidation, caused the cancellation of that recount.  Wouldn't the physically and verbally-coerced cancellation of vote-counting constitute a "dark [day for] free speech"?  And we mustn't forget that the "bourgeois riot", as the Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot put it, was organized by the Bushies themselves, who footed the bill for many of the protesters, who were flown in from far outside Florida.  And hey!  Doesn't this mean that George W. Bush endorses the EXACT type of behavior that the Patriot criticizes the Berkeley left for participating in?  Oh, and they were  urlLink violent , too!

       FOLLOW THE MONEY   Before we start in earnest, I had to check out who was funding the  Patriot , mostly because I had a sneaking suspicion.  It turns out that two organizations they list as major donors -- The Collegiate Network and The Leadership Institute -- are recipients of significant funding from none other than Darth himself, Richard Mellon Scaife.  The wonderful thing about the internet is, no matter how obscure your subject matter is, if you look hard enough, somebody has already done your research for you.  The Collegiate Network is a college newspaper project of the Madison Center for Educational Affairs, a group that has received significant funding from Scaife organizations (see  urlLink here ).  Researching The Leadership Institute (including taking a gander at their rather perky  urlLink website ), if you go  urlLink here , scrolling down about halfway, we find that Institute receives a lot of funding not only from Sarah Scaife (#1) and the Scaife Family (#8), but also from two other organizations, Allegheny (#5) and Carthage (#6), that are directly controlled by the Scaife empire.  It has been thoroughly documented in the public record that it was primarily Richard Mellon Scaife's funding that propelled the  American Spectator 's "Arkansas Project", a dirty-tricks operation that spent 8 years relentlessly trying to smear, embarass and ultimately attempt to impeach President Bill Clinton.  Among other things they propelled myths like the Clintons murdering Vince Foster, an affiar between Foster and Hillary, drug running with Colombians at an Arkansas airfield by Clinton, a love-child of Bill's born by a prostitute, and myriad others.  ALL proven false.  Before the  Patriot 's writers criticize the Berkeley left's conduct and discourse in any fashion, they would do well to think long and hard about their Scaife money.

       Greetings, salutations, and welcome to the unofficial (but fun!)  California Patriot  Watch .  We will be digging deep, and exposing the BS, hypocrisy, and amusing irony that can only come from a conservative student publication like this.  We do NOT, however, endorse any vandalism or theft of the paltry  Patriot , mainly for the reason that most of the publication is amateur to the extent that it takes less energy to challenge it intellectually than to burn or steal it.  Then again, if you have a short teenage daughter who is learning how to drive, and you don't have a phone book around, a stack of the  Patriot  may very well suffice!  But no matter, our work shall begin shortly, keep checking back here!

        PATRIOT  FINALLY HOPS ON THE BANDWAGON   Bravo to the  Patriot , which has finally chimed in on Trent Lott, by way of an  urlLink editorial  by Kelso Barnett.  Barnett, if you recall, was the person who had  urlLink predicted  that the Senate Majority Leader's views would be put front and center.  Oh wait, did I say Senate Majority Leader?  I meant  House Minority Leader .  But he gets points for, uh, trying.  Just as everything Lott has said since the comments has been inadequate (no matter what he says, the sentiment from the original comments remain), Kelso leaves a lot to be desired, some nitpicky and some not: 1)  "Clintonian"?  How exactly?   Or is that just a conservative buzzword to jazz up the haters?  Hmm, kinda like "states' rights"! 2) And speaking of "states' rights", Kelso is exactly right when he says they are code words.  I hope Kelso  also  knows that Ronald Reagan (who appears on the front page of the  Patriot 's website) appealed to groups of southern racist voters in 1980 with those two words. 3) Cheney voted against the MLK Jr holiday as well. and 4) Why are the future of the Republican Party and the conservative moment listed before American values as reasons Lott should not be Majority Leader?  This is painfully similar to the manner in which the  Patriot  handled the 9/11 commemoration issue three months ago.  In that case, they bleated about flags and symbols, trivializing the thousands of souls who perished that terrible morning.  Here, very similar to that occasion, the focus is politics, and race relations are on the back burner.  At least they're mentioned at all, the three thousand victims of 9/11 did not get a mention in any of the pieces produced by the  Patriot  back in early fall.  The difference between myself and the  Patriot ?  Both of us know that Lott keeping his position as Majority Leader would be to the political advantage of the Democrats.  Thus they want him gone.  Me?   I want him gone too .  Sure a more effective majority leader could emerge (Nickles, despite his homophobia, or Frist).  But what good are Democratic principles if we don't use them?

      Again, yeah that Nancy Pelosi has become the face of her party, hasn't she?  Oh wait, I meant Trent Lott.  In fact, over at the local  urlLink Daily Kos , they're coining a new term,  urlLink "Trent Lott Republicans" : Every controversial judge will be a "Trent Lott judge." Lott will  own  every conservative bill the majority leaders tries to steer through his chamber. This is  his  party now. Lott has shown that he can say whatever he wants and get away with it. The rest of his party fears him and the people he represents.   Even President Bush. In an anomatopoeia, "Mwa-ha-ha".

       SETH NORMAN, PLAGIARIST   I had a suspicion about something, and I was right.  From  urlLink Mr. Cranky 's review of  8 Mile : He learns that his mother (Kim Basinger) is a great lay for everybody but him and that she's not very self-reliant and that her boobs still look good from the side.  He learns that just because a chick will do you standing up in a factory does not mean she won't do a different guy who's trying to get her a record contract.  From  urlLink Seth Norman 's "seth sez" column in December's  Patriot : I think we were all touched by Eminem�s new film, 8 Mile. It really taught us some important lessons about the state of the human condition. Lessons like: never give up, believe in yourself and,  if a girl is willing to let you have sex with her standing up in the back of a car bumper factory, she�s also likely to sleep with a guy who promises her a modeling career . Whoops!  Ah the joys of laziness.  Is this the same laziness that caused the  Patriot  to illustrate the "protests" of their newly-elected thief-mayor by taking  urlLink pictures  of  Patriot staff members  holding up signs they made?  Is that lazy too?  (BTW I got a kick out of the "Nixon/Clinton/Bates" sign.  It reminds me of a fun fact about Majority Leader Lott: He voted for conviction of President Clinton, yet back when he was a member of the House Judiciary Committee, he voted  against  impeaching Nixon.  That's probably even harder to explain away than Lott's racism!  Oh and by the way, what exactly did Clinton steal?)   UPDATE :  I notified Mr Cranky of the situation via email, and he responded within the half-hour!  Here is his email: While our evaluations are similar-sounding, I don't think his qualifies as plagiarism as they aren't my exact words. However, were he to continue to make similar-sounding remarks, I might be concerned.  If you notice this, just let me know. I appreciate you looking out for the site. Thanks.  -jk Oh, and for the record, let's visit our friend the American Heritage Dictionary, shall we? "Plagiarism (NOUN): 1. The act of plagiarizing." Fuck.  Ok, my mistake... "Plagiarize (TRANSITIVE VERB): 1. To use and pass off ( the ideas  or writings of another) as one's own.  2. To appropriate for use as one's own passages or  ideas  from (another)." (emphases mine) Hmm, in that case it  is  plagiarism.  Hehehe, you've been warned, Norman.  Now don't go inside the sphere again!

       MAYBE IN BIZARRO WORLD, KELSO   From  Patriot  staffer and alleged-non-student Kelso Barnett's  urlLink holiday season wishlist : I want newly anointed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to become the most visible Democrat on a national level. I want her politics and background to become what America thinks of when they think Democrat. Isn't it ironic?  Don't you think?  Let me see... who right now is the most visible Republican on a national level, whose politics and background are becoming what America (and perhaps Louisiana last saturday) thinks of when they think Republican?  Hmm, maybe this guy?     By the way, Kelso, since you mentioned it, you know who the most visible Democrat on a national level is right now?  Al Gore.  And the Republicans are scared to death.  And don't you think criminalizing abortion might help Al's re-election prospects even more, kid?

      A more accurate summary of Bush's accomplishments:  "Bush has had some very important domestic accomplishments. He's reintroduced the peanut butter and jelly sandwich to the White House. He's presided over t-ball games.  He's cleared a heck of a lot of brush there from that ranch in Texas. So that's something. A few accomplishments there for our president."    --Paul Begala, Crossfire, 12/02/02

       GOOD WORK, TBOGG!   I love it when blogs I read  urlLink do my work for me .  The  urlLink Tom Bates story  came to tbogg's attention after Sully linked.   Mayor-Elect Tom Bates trumps free speech by allegedly discarding 1,000 Daily Cals  From something called the California Patriot run by the Berkeley Conservative Foundation. "Berkeley at its Best,� promised Tom Bates for Mayor campaign posters across the city this fall, but the Berkeley mayoral candidate fell miserably short of his campaign slogan. The day before Election Day, Bates was spotted looting the Daily Californian distribution stand and throwing hundreds of copies into nearby trashcans. In that issue, the Daily Cal printed endorsements for the upcoming election. For Mayor, the Editorial Board endorsed Shirley Dean.  Four eyewitnesses, including this reporter, confirmed the occurrence. �He just scooped up the entire stack into his arms and dumped them in the trashcan,� recounted Andrea Irvin, Treasurer of the Berkeley College Republicans. �I couldn�t believe my eyes.�   �I checked other trashcans nearby,� said Steve Sexton, another witness to the act, �and many of them had entire stacks of Daily Cals.� As evidence the California Patriot provide pictures. But not of any evil-doing. Just Bates handing out flyers as well as a picture of a newstand. That seals it for me.   I love this quote, though: �When we went to the Daily Cal with the story, the editor told us that they could not print the story with only four witnesses, since we are all Republicans. He told us that we weren�t credible since we presumably had an ideological bias against Bates,� explained Irvin.  �I�m agitated that the Daily Cal implied that just because I�m a Republican I would lie to further my own beliefs.�  Heh heh. Those wacky college kids.... Well said, well said.  UPDATE:  urlLink Bates admits  trashing the papers.  Still, having witnesses outside of a few  Patriot  staffers would have helped.  There probably wont be a recall, and hey, it's not like Bates conspired to trash people's votes, like some presidents I know.

       SPIN IT ALL YOU WANT, YOU GOT  SWEPT !   I was especially fond of this line from the  urlLink editor's note : Though the results in California were  not as joyous , there were at least some bright spots. First of all, I think I can speak for most when I say that  Gray Davis� political career is essentially over . (emphases mine) Two things:  1) "not as joyous"?  You got SWEPT!  California doesn't want you here!  2) Gray Davis' political career is over?  Last I checked, he won re-election.  Four years (or even two) is a long time in terms of politics, and plenty of time for Davis to overcome whatever liabilities Mr. Gallagher and other detractors say he has.    Wait, why am I even saying all that?  Davis WON!  Quick history lesson for Mr. Gallagher and the  Patriot :  When Nixon lost the California gubernatorial race, it was widely believed to be the end of his political career, and you know how that turned out.  So if his career wasn't over when he lost, how can Davis' career be over when he won?  You wanna know whose political career is over?  Bill Simon.  That's who.

       JUST SAY HUH?   The  Patriot 's unsigned* editorial on the  urlLink Drug Resource Center  sneaks in a happy little 'graph on Nancy Reagan's "Just say no" policy. In the 1980s, Nancy Reagan led a national campaign to �Just Say No to Drugs.� Today the effects of the program, which was roundly criticized as ignorant and na�ve by liberals, has reduced levels of drug use by 50 percent over the last 20 years.  Yeah,  urlLink that's one great policy .  How's that drug war doing  urlLink these days  anyway?  Also, not to be nitpicky, but the 2nd sentence in that paragraph is a grammatical nightmare.  (* - Perhaps it is unsigned because if it were signed, one of the  Patriot 's resident libertarians would kick the author's tuchis)

       THE BUSH CIRCLE-JERK   I got quite a kick out of Mr. McFadden's list of Dubya's accomplishments from his  urlLink Bush-is-a-genius-somehow piece : In his first two years, President Bush built up an impressive list of political accomplishments. He signed into law the second largest tax cut in American history, a bi-partisan education overhaul package, campaign finance reform, and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security - the largest governmental reorganization since the creation of the Defense Department in 1947. Additionally, Bush has reshaped American foreign policy in the wake of Sept. 11, defined the scope and breadth of the War on Terrorism, and set the precedent of pre-emptive attacks to prevent tragedies before they occur. - The education bill was essentially Ted Kennedy's bill , any president would have passed that, so we can't give Bush credit for that.  - Campaign finance reform?  Bush fought McCain-Feingold tooth-and-nail , and only signed it (grudgingly, I might add) when the stench of Enron, Halliburton, WorldCom and Harken became too foul, so we certainly can't give Bush credit for that.  - The Department of Homeland Security?  Bush fought that tooth-and-nail too!   He flip-flopped when it was politically convenient for him to do so -- a sure sign of an ideal, principled leader -- after the August 6 memo, among other things went public, so we definitely can't give Bush credit for that.  -But kudos to you, Georgie, for that tax cut for the top 1%.  Way to shore up your base.  (By the way, it's been 434 days since Bush said "Wanted, dead or alive".  Where's Osama, George?  And gee I wonder why Mr. McFadden didn't bring up that nugget.  Wasn't getting Bin Laden, the man behind the 9/11 attacks, central to the "scope and breadth" of the War on Terrah?)  Anyway, how exactly is Bush a political genius?  I thought it was  urlLink the Karl-Meister  who put the powerpoint together.  Furthermore, since when were Bush's policies popular?  The next two years will make the truth in that matter quite evident.  This is a laughable piece in general from the  Patriot , but I'm not surprised.  Berkeley's isolated, forever-just-fledgling conservative student community (the same state as any conservative student community on any campus in America, save for maybe Bob Jones and Liberty) will lap up this Dubya circle-jerk.  Democrats being stupid (which they were) does not prove anything about Bush's intelligence, political or otherwise.  If anything, the Democrats lost because they "mis over estimated" Bush, sucking up to him acting like fake Republicans in general.  We've all heard that Truman quote, so I'll spare my readers.  (p.s. how many legislators who voted against the Persian-Gulf-of-Tonkin resolution, thus drawing a "stark contrast with [Bush's] popular polic[y]", lost their seats in the election?  any backlash there?)

       FIRE UP THE LAUGH TRACK  We can be sure that some pundits will acclaim the speech as bold and brilliant; they would do that if he read from "The Very Hungry Caterpillar."  - urlLink Paul Krugman , 1/28 In  urlLink Mr McFadden , we've found one of them.  I could probably spread this one out over a week if I wanted to.  But I have a lot to do.  Hmm, I'm in a Fisking mood:  The State of the Union Address has been compared to the Super Bowl of politics,...  Hmm, I must nitpick now.  What is this magical "super bowl of politics", this mysterious third party to which the SOtU Address has been compared?  Either do some research and figure out what that analogical middle-man is, or get your copy editor in here, stat, and rediscover that magical phrase "referred to as".  Now let's get serious, Mr Mc.  ...yet last night's speech lacked the metaphorical high kicking cheerleaders and pyrotechnic halftime shows that have become a staple of the annual event.  But it had plenty of "noo-kyu-lar"!  In perhaps the most serious State of the Union speech in recent memory, it was what President Bush didn't do and say that set the tone. He did not introduce the First Lady. He did not acknowledge dignitaries and special guests in the audience. He did not mention the vacant seat he left open in memory of the victims of Sept. 11.  He did not mention Osama Bin Laden.  He did not mention any of the promises he made in last year's speech.  He did not provide any new or substantial evidence to add to his case for war in Iraq, other than to blanket-define Saddam Hussein as "evil".  Whenever I hear that, I think of the pictures of Rummy eagerly shaking hands with Saddam.  What lies behind your next verbal corner, Faddman?  He did not even tell a joke, although Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi found the speech amusing.  ...Probably for the same reasons I found it amusing.  Let's have a look at  urlLink what she had to say  (via Kos).  Onward!  As Bush enters the third and defining year of his presidency, his approval ratings have settled into the 50s, the economy still looms as an unsolved problem, and the country stands on the brink of war with Iraq.  Wasn't his 2002 SOtU full of promises to kick-start the economy?  It loomed as a problem then; it looms as a problem now.  Nonetheless, the President spoke with confidence and resolve, telling the American people that he (unlike his predecessor) will confront today's challenges, however big they may be.   "We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and other generations," the President promised.  Hoo boy.  Robb has now stepped into Burger King (well, not in Berkeley, muahaha, mmm curry!), cuz this is a whopper.  Hey McCheese (ironic I suppose), where in not passing along problems to other generations does  urlLink DEFICITS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE  fit in?  Yes, oh  urlLink where ?  (Note: I linked to those two bastions of liberal thoght, Mickey Kaus and the Washington Times).  One of Bush's themes in his 2000 campaign was to "usher in an era of responsibility," starting at the top. In the wake of a reckless and irresponsible Clinton Administration, Bush made it a priority to restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office. These efforts have been noticed in little ways - from a suits-only dress code at the White House, to the pre-screening of R movies on Air Force One - but Bush's approach to policy has also been a study in contrasts. While President Clinton seemed driven by polls and political survival, Bush has continually pushed big ideas, stayed true to his conservative ideology, and willingly confronted problems head-on.  I think this is as good a time as any to  urlLink link to this .  Robb can only point to little things (suits, R-rated movies) because nothing about Bush's budgetary ideas suggest the ushering in of "an era of responsibility", be they tax giveaways to wealthy contributors or anything else.  I dont know, but balanced budgets, and then surpluses, those things suggest responsibility to me.  McF doesn't seem up to telling us just how exactly Clinton's administration was "reckless and irresponsible".  That would allow people like me to compare their criminal record to that of the Reagan Administration.  And Bush isn't driven in the slightest by polls and political survival, like big bad Clinton was.   urlLink Riiiight .  Uh oh, get the editors back in the room,  Tuesday night's State of the Union address was sobering, serious, and stern. It's hard to believe that the speech was given by the very same person who was featured in Alexandra Pelosi's "Journeys with George," a campaign documentary that showed Bush crunching on Cheetohs and bowling oranges down airplane  isles . His sense of humor was also displayed soon after his election when he attended a commencement ceremony at Yale University where he offered some advice to graduating seniors: "To those of you who received honors, awards and distinctions, I say well done. And to the C students, I say, you, too, can be president of the United States."  I'm not sure how you can fit an island on an airplane, even if a presidential candidate is on board.  Anyway, filler paragraph for a minumum amount of characters, where were we?  But that was then, and this is now. Gone are the jokes, the niceties, the 'hi how're you doings?" Bush may have been a C student, but when it comes to politics he's done his homework and knows that popularity can vanish in a heartbeat.  Politics is all that he and Rove seem to know anything about.  But that only works for a little while.  Following the Gulf War, Bush Sr. had sky high approval ratings, but lost the fall campaign to a little known governor from Arkansas when the economy turned sour. With the new arrivals of two new economic advisors, and with a bold $674 billion stimulus plan, President Bush seems to have learned from his father's mistakes.  New economic team, same economic policies.  I see Robb is more than happy to use the B-word, that being " urlLink bold " to describe Bush's economic plan.  And by the way, if his economic plan creates one job, just one job, then I will have lost a bet.  His economic plans in last year's speech, he summed them up in one word: "jobs".  Jobs created since?  Zero.  Somehow, after all the nonsense in this piece, Mr McFadden comes to a sobering conclusion, increasingly unavoidable with each day that Bush occupies the White House:  Pundits and analysts predicted that the course of Bush's presidency changed with the terrorist attacks. Now, sixteen months after the attacks, an empty seat memorializing the victims of Sept. 11 was the underlying center of attention. The resulting prosecution of a second Gulf War, coupled with the performance of the American economy over the next eighteen months, will likely determine whether Bush's presidency is deemed a success or a failure in 2004.   Both are very good reasons for the President's state of concern.  Anything in those first 24 months about Bush and the economy give you any confidence, Robb?  His solution for the final 18 is more tax cuts.  Good luck!  He'll  definitely  need that second Gulf War!  Allow me to take the liberty of showing the difference between Clinton's SOTU speeches and Bush's on tuesday.  When Clinton recounted the legislative accomplishments in America under his Administration's leadership, he would put them in terms of their  actual results , as in jobs created, pollution curbed, etc, and not just talking about the legislation itself.  All Bush can say is that he passed a tax cut; if he talks about how it affected the economy, much less the federal budget, that wouldn't, um, say a lot of good about the "state of the union", would it?  Real positive results are not there.  And they're not going to be there, for instance, under continuing Bush economic policy (which outside of "tax cuts for the affluent" doesn't really exist).  Anyway, good try, Mr McFadden!  Don't call us, we'll call you!

        PATRIOT  MISSED THE MEMO   I see they have their  urlLink new-look site  up and running.  Well it didn't take long before the reality set in to this reader:  New look, S.O.S.!  They're devoting essentially their entire February issue to attacking affirmative action policies on campuses and elsewhere.  For our first barrel of laughs, let's proceed to Mr McFarlane's  urlLink "news analysis" , entitled "A Question of Race".  The third paragraph, shall we? At issue is the extent to which a university can use race as a factor for admissions. Michigan�s undergraduate college employs a point system: of 150 possible, one can earn 20 if either black, Amerindian or Latino. Categories of merit including grades and SAT/ACT scores can net a maximum of 80 and 12 points respectively, while other nonacademic criteria such as athletic promise and provost discretion can each provide 20. The addition of 20 points on the basis of race would thus overshadow even a perfect SAT score, which has angered many legal groups, legislators and unsuccessful applicants. Gee golly, I've heard that number somewhere before.  Where could it be???  Oh wait, I remember, from EVERY CONSERVATIVE TV PUNDIT in the days following the Bushies' filing of the brief against UM.  The spin, of course, is that since being from an underrepresented minority gets you more points than a high SAT1 score, then that means race is more important to UM than academics, by a ratio of 20 (race) to 12 (SAT1).  But if we actually look at the UM admissions system -- rather than, you know, trusting the  Patriot  -- high-level academic performance in highschool nets you  110 points , including for GPA, avanced placement classes, and rigorousness of the high school, all along with SAT scores.  Everyone from Tim Russert to Cal Thomas paraded out the extremely dishonest "20-12" spin in the days after the UM brief was filed by Dubya.  And that piece of spin has been thoroughly debunked (go  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here ).  But apparently the  Patriot  didn't get the memo, and has gone right on flogging that discredited spin.  Good work, kids!  Way to boost that credibility there!

       I WANT CLIFF'S NOTES   There's a lot I could talk about from  urlLink Kelso's FauxLennon-Moment , but I'm a busy man, so the highlights will have to do... I want Iraqi children to grow up with the same goals and dreams as American children, instead of growing up with fear of random executions, an evil regime, and no hope. Despite that Erin Brockovich is a Republican, safe drinking water never seems to occur to these guys, thus no discussion of the embargo's effects on Iraqi children (not to mention errant "smart" bombs) here!  Also, try at least  urlLink 200,000 , not 100,000.  After a couple paragraphs about Iraq's potential (but so far non-existent) nukes, how we've "given peace a chance" in Iraq, and a revealing anecdote about his inability to contain his emotions and rage over a sporting event ( urlLink here   urlLink you   urlLink go ,  urlLink Kelso , you're welcome in advance), Barnett makes the, um, obvious conclusion we've all been waiting for.  Quck, everybody, what's wrong with this? Since we've given peace a chance, three thousand Americans forever lay dead on the southern tip of Manhattan. Ok, everybody, you know the drill:  Iraq and Al Qaeda are NOT the same .  Given that Osama recently (on tape) called Saddam a "socialist", sounds like it's Bin Laden and the Neocons in a tag team!  Then we get the usual Orwelian peace-through-war stuff.  Fair enough, and par for the course from these boys.  But Kelso runs into more trouble in his last full 'graf: The path to peace is a long one. It won't be smooth or easy. But we're the freest, most special place on earth for a reason- because of the values this country holds.  If we want to be the safest, most peaceful place on earth, we must go to any length to make sure those who hate us can't hit us.  (emphasis mine) Soooo... pre-emptive wars, all over the world, would not call into question our nations status as the most peaceful place on earth?  And if Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck beat the shit out of the ticket-takers at Six Flags, is Disneyland still "the happiest place on earth"?

Let's go back to Mr McFadden's laugh riot SOtU piece: While President Clinton seemed driven by polls and political survival, Bush has continually pushed big ideas, stayed true to his conservative ideology, and willingly confronted problems head-on. Well that's lovely.  Bush not being driven by polls...  How did the Department of Homeland Security get the idea for  urlLink duct tape , among other things?   Focus groups ???  You can't be serious!  Anyway, carry on.  (via the horse)

       PATRIOT CALLS FOR BOYCOTT OF "FRENCH FRIES"   First off, happy Valentine's/Presidents' Day weekend from all of us at CPW!  meaning, me.  In the meantime, we all need to laugh this weekend, especially you fellows out there who don't have a special lady, I mean, special lady friend, I mean lady friend to spend friday with.  (or any other orientation, of course, completely legal, seth)  Have some fun reading Seth Norman's  urlLink painfully awkward analogy  regarding the French. Millions of people held hostage by someone in France. Change the channel to FOX News and you can see the same thing. Hmm, you're giving both them and yourself away!  And by the way, since you bring up the Cold War, Mr Norman, in 1962, didn't the removal of arms from Turkey serve to  prevent  large-scale nuclear war?  There's other silliness to be found there, but I have a train to catch.  Have a great weekend, see you monday!

       CPW FANMAIL!   ...doh!  It's always from the writers!  Goggles on...  Sorry Mike,  urlLink no retraction .  I have no problem with your article on the whole (the entirety of which I  urlLink linked to  in my piece, so much for dishonesty).  There are numerous legitimate arguments on both sides of the affirmative action issue, and the piece deals with some of them fairly.  However, the point discussed in that paragraph, which comes straight from you (no sign of "Opponents of affirmative action say that..."), is still what it is, that being dishonest spin.  And speaking of affirmative action at the Patriot,  urlLink hehehe .  Anyway, carry on America.  And why is this so important?  People, we're at   ORANGE   here!!!

       FROM AROUND THE WEB...   Paul Bruno of A Fortiori essentially  urlLink does what I did  to Robb's SOtU piece, only a few days later.  Nevertheless, good show!  Meanwhile, Kevin at CalStuff  urlLink skewers the Patriot  on their  urlLink Hernandez editorial .  And Jeff at Greenthink! makes a good point about the Patriot's  urlLink D'Souza impression .  All these guys run great blogs, by the way.

       SPEAK FOR  THIS , BOYS    urlLink Robb and Kelso  crack me up!  I will give them credit, though.  They mention Osama Bin Laden; Bush won't even do that.  But it's all downhill from there.  I found this especially entertaining: Lee concluded her statement by saying, "I am just shocked that young people would not be clear enough and informed enough with regard to the central elements of our Constitution and the right to provide a different point of view."  We at the Patriot take issue with Congresswoman Lee's assertion that, when it comes to the Constitution, we're misinformed. On the contrary, we know our Constitution so well, that we stand up for it against all enemies. When our country was attacked that tragic September morning, Osama and his band of thugs didn't just fly planes into concrete and steel. The World Trade Center and the Pentagon were symbols of this country's financial and military might--all possible because of our Constitution. Barnett and McFadden dispute Lee's assertion that the Patriot staffers are "misinformed" about the Constitution.  Do they counter this with anything the least bit scholarly about the Constitutional implications of her vote, or that of anyone's?  Nope, just a pile of empty, inflammatory rhetoric.  In terms of the Constitution of the United States, here's what Congresswoman Lee herself had to say, from her  urlLink government website .  I report, you decide: On Friday, September 14, I voted against H. J. Res. 64, which ceded Congress�s future authority to the President regarding the use of military force in response to the terrorist attacks. Our Constitution provides for checks and balances between our branches of government. This resolution does not obligate the President to report back to Congress after 60 days, as was required by Congress during the Gulf War, about the actions our military will take. Additionally, this resolution authorizes an open-ended action and significantly reduces Congress�s authority in this matter. We must bring the perpetrators of this horrific action to justice. But during this period of grief, mourning, and anger, the U.S. Congress has a responsibility to urge the use of restraint so that the violence does not spiral out of control and to consider all of the implications of our actions. Don't forget that in the days following the attacks, Lee voted in favor of condemning the attacks, encouraging Americans to fly the flag, expedite payments and benefits to those directly affected by the attacks, providing tax relief to victimsof and those directly affected by the attack, $40 billion in emergency funds for NYC DC and PA, and a resolution "Providing American Flags Flown Over the Capitol to Victims of the Terrorist Acts".  Robb and Kelso, would you like to join Barbara on the 5th column, then?

       AN AMUSING HISTORY   How about John Lee and the perspective he provides us on  urlLink the history of racism  and Republicans in America.  Right off the top: Poor Trent Lott.  One day, fourth in line for the Presidency, the next, a humiliated, ostracized senator stripped of his leadership role. Ah yes, the Republicans have exorcised their demons with the demotion of Lott.  Nevermind that not only is he still a Senator, but he's the new  urlLink Chairman of the Rules Committee .  Talking about the civil rights movement, Lee draws concern: The Civil Rights Movement flourished in America, despite water hoses, German Shepards, and  hooded hooligans . (emphasis mine) "Hooded hooligans"?  Wouldn't a person of well-developed moral convictions describe Klansmen with language much stronger than "hooligans"?  With this euphemism, Mr Lee, you serve to illustrate the precise problem with the Republicans.  It reminds me of Lott's first apology attempt, when he referred to segregation as a "discarded polic[y] of the past", a statement correctly characterized by that stalwart liberal Mickey Kaus on 12/10/02 as " urlLink alarmingly non-judgemental ".  What else?  Ah, Lee wonders why on earth the Republicans would welcome the racist dixiecrats into their party: Perhaps it was due to alleged racism, or the desire to win key southern votes at any cost, but it also presents the possibility that states� rights and local autonomy really are important principles for conservatives -- not just window dressings for racism. Either way, for whatever reasons, faced with all this societal upheaval, the Republican Party found itself perceived as squarely on the wrong side of history. Hmm, "local autonomy", eh?  Didn't Stephen Douglas and other pro-slavery types argue in favor of "popular soverignty"?  Of course, of the possibilities offered by Lee, I'd have to go with option B; just ask Richard "Southern Strategy" Nixon.  And please, when Reagan, Bush and Bush 2.0 head down to the deep south and use the phrase "states' rights", it constituted both a wink and a nudge; their audiences knew precisely what the implications were of such statements.  Eventually Mr Lee finds his way to affirmative action. The use of such blatant racial discrimination as that employed during affirmative action�s run, in one instance equating skin color as a more important qualifier than perfect SAT scores for admission into the University of Michigan, only exacerbates relations between all races. Hey look!  There's our old friend " urlLink 20-12 " again!  But this time it comes with a bonus!  Hmm "skin color"... I think this would be as good a time as any to point out that applicants with "socioeconomic disadvantages" receive 20 points.  Anyway, the rest of Lee's piece is the usual anti-AA bile that we're used to from publications like this.  Let's not forget, of course, that the  Patriot 's views are underrepresented in Berkeley, and they're bitching for more play.  Ahh, as Bart Simpson would say, "The ironing is incredible."

        PATRIOT  PROJECTION ON SUV'S?   Let's do a little rewording of  urlLink this , shall we?  Steve Sexton, now: In their effort to link SUV ownership with support for terrorism, Arianna Huffington and The Detroit Project are exploiting a national tragedy for an agenda far more dubious and much less noble than their purported goal of stopping terrorist funding. They use September 11 and strong national support for anti-terrorism activity to lobby for increased regulation and taxation of SUVs and those who drive them. Myself, on Kelso, Steve and the rest of the boys' crusade during the 9/11 one-year-later situation at Cal: In their effort to link the Berkeley left's desire for political correctness with support for terrorism, Kelso Barnett, Steve Sexton and the  California Patriot  are exploiting a national tragedy for an agenda far more dubious and much less noble than their purported goal of recognizing the anniversary with dignity. They use September 11 and strong national support for the purpose of advancing their own publication's agenda and stature, all while demonizing those who would rather focus on-campus events on remembering those who were lost rather than engaging in jingoistic fervor. Am I being silly?  Hell, sure.  But are Sexton and the  Patriot  as well?  The fellow takes down the ad, good for him.  Nevermind that everytime a microphone has been placed within a few feet of Arianna Huffington since she put out the ads, she has made the point that they are  satire , and meant to start a dialog.  The  Patriot 's economic reasoning is all good fun, though of course a drop in prices of oil resulting from decreasing SUV sales is not the end of the story.  Hmm... further penetration of hybrids into the market... even  Dubya  is talking about hydrogen cell cars... increases in fuel efficiency would eventually, if not sooner negate any increase in oil use that would arise from people being inspired to drive more, as they argue.  But I'm having too much fun with the projection angle.  Want more?  How bout that closer graph: Huffington and The Detroit Project use America�s unified response to 9-11 to advance their liberal agenda. They cynically invoke the most tragic attack on the U.S. to garner support for their controversial goals. Hmm, I seem to remember a certain group of people who used America's unified response to 9/11 to push for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, a nonsensical war in Iraq, and now  urlLink secret arrests and deportations .  Any reason I couldn't say the same about those fellers currently occupying the White House?

       PASS IT ALONG!   Ok it's been a few days, but only now has the laughing died down from Mr. McFadden's piece.  I'm sure his jaw is sore, but Dubya appreciates the effort.  But remember this? "We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and other generations," the President promised. Well,  urlLink Kos  seems to have the same problem that I have (about Bush, that is), and links to  urlLink this story . Over the next five years, the White House expects the budget shortfall to add up to more than $1.08 trillion, although as recently as 2001 the government was forecasting 10-year budget surpluses of $5.6 trillion. That's not something they're passing aong?  Hopefully President Kerry/Edwards/Dean will be able to clean up this mess.

       NOT THAT IT MATTERS   Hmm, it's March 19th, and  urlLink we're at war ...  It is at times like this that I must look to my leader and commander-in-chief for an example.  At a news conference a couple of weeks ago, George W Bush said he would call for a vote on a second UN resolution regardless of the chances of passage.  He wanted a "whip count", for people to "show their cards", and other homespun expressions, etc.  Instead he hid in the Azores and talked -- for  one whole hour , how's that for Potsdam Part Deux -- with the only two relevant people on earth who agree with him, and then snuck the resolution off the table, regardless of his promise.  So now we have to get behind Bush, right?  Right.  With that in mind, I am hereby following his example.  Meaning: no carbonated beverage for Mr Barron.  If he doesn't like it, that means he's going against the example set by his president.  (i could have also mentioned that  I  require a 2nd resolution, one that actually has language prescribing force in it, but the dubya thing will have to do)

       NOTES FOR BARRON   There is no direct link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.  If the Bush Administration had any positive information indicating a link, we would have heard about it by now.  They tried the travelling fellow who stopped in at a hospital in Baghdad, sorry, no dice.  (as if Atta and the other hijackers didn't go to the health center while in flight school in Arizona, please)  They tried a mythical meeting in Prague between Mohammed Atta and an Iraqi agent, sorry, no dice (except in Bill Safire's head).  Yet many Iraq hawks in the media and elsewhere make a deceitful, disingenuous argument that Saddam and Al Qaeda are one and the same.  Such nonsense is found in the  Patriot , no doubt.  Certainly Kelso "Since we've given peace a chance, three thousand Americans forever lay dead on the southern tip of Manhattan" Barnett is guilty of spreading such nonsense.  And now  urlLink Mr Barron  joins him.  On Representative Barbara Lee: Recognizing the backstepping among Democrats from the war they and the rest of Congress overwhelmingly approved in October, Barbara Lee has stepped to the plate once again to demand an end to all this crazy war talk.  "Calling the president's justification for a pre-emptive attack against Hussein's regime 'a statement of extreme arrogance and illegality,' Lee said at a Capitol press conference that the Bush doctrine 'undermines any moral authority of the United States in seeking peaceful resolution of any conflicts,' the Chronicle reports."  This is just absurd.  Did al Qaeda give us any warning before they attacked us? Oh, but maybe good ole' Osama will be polite enough to drop the White House a telegram next time he tries to kill thousands of our people and decimate our national confidence and economic vitality.  (emphasis mine) Again, the usual confuse-the-issue nonsense.  Once more, for the record, a quiz . . . In a recent statement Osama bin Laden said what of Saddam Hussein? A) "my ally in jihad" B) "a hero, a humanitarian, and a heck of a guy" C) "a socialist" D) "the only thing we have in common is that we were both on Bush's daddy's payroll" (answer: C, although D does apply)  What's so frustrating about those who push the non-connection connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda is that such irresponsible thinking has spread so widely.  From Tuesday's  New York Times , the  urlLink last two paragraphs  on a piece about recent Iraq poll numbers: Although Mr. Bush's statements at his news conference last week appear to have increased the nation's support for a war, he apparently did not succeed with one argument: convincing more Americans that Mr. Hussein had a role in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  The poll found that  45 percent of Americans said Mr. Hussein was "personally involved" in the attacks , a number essentially unchanged from a month ago. (emphasis mine) The fact that almost half of Americans think Saddam was directly involved with 9/11 means that both the press and the administration are not doing their jobs.  Wouldn't a student-run publication like the  Patriot  be idealistic and honest enough to make the case for war completely on the merits, rather than resorting to the cultivation of fear and confusion by falsely combining two very separate issues?  Guess not!

       "SOUNDS LIKE A WAGER TO ME"      Mr. Barron writes on the impact/non-impact of SF protestors, February 25th: Of course, none of this matters.  We�re still going to war within a month. Hmm, sounds like someone's gonna owe CPW a Coke!  Though I'm more of a Pepsi One guy.  We'll see how it goes.  UPDATE: Ben Barron accepts! (in comments)  Good, this will save me a trip to the store.  UPDATE PART DEUX: I hope the war is averted altogether, but I also hope for a free beverage, and given the US and Britain's sudden signals of  urlLink willingness to extend the deadline  for Iraqi compliance beyond the 17th, I just may be in luck.  Again, we'll see.

       WOMEN, PROTESTORS, BUSH AND NGUYEN   One more thing from Mr. Nguyen's piece on  urlLink anti-war protestors :  Peace protestors supposedly champion equal rights for woman  and minorities, free speech, human rights, democracy, and international law.  In reality, they practice none of it. For 30 years Saddam has murdered millions and committed untold atrocities, but there was no march for his victims . He has imprisoned, tortured, or executed anyone who possessed the courage to speak up against his actions, but there were no words spoken. Countless resolutions have passed by the United Nations Security Council yet the same number have been ignored. Instead of denouncing of Saddam for his treachery and flagrant violations of international law, the peace movement is silent.  (emphases mine) Nguyen, think harder.  Much harder.  Anti-war protestors are concerned about women's rights and human rights in a potential post-war Iraq.  Irrational of them?  Well hey,  urlLink look at post-war Afghanistan ! There are disturbing reports that an extreme and strict interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, is being nurtured in the post-Taliban era. Moreover, attempts are being made to include some of the harshest and most discriminatory elements of sharia in the new constitution and judicial system. The notorious Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which enforced religious conformity and meted out harsh punishments under the Taliban, has reemerged in a supposedly gentler guise. Abuses against women and girls continue, apparently with the support of police and the courts. Women and girls finally have the opportunity to go to school, but recent attacks and threats against schools for girls are keeping many away. Read the whole thing, there's much more there.  Surely Bush, Ashcroft etc are enlightened folks who wouldn't cooperate with Islamic fundamentalists in the oppression of women and nonbelievers, right?   urlLink Think again : Bush Joins Forces with Islamic Fundamentalists The Washington Post, June 17, 2002  UNITED NATIONS -- Conservative U.S. Christian organizations have joined forces with Islamic governments to halt the expansion of sexual and political protections and rights for gays, women and children at United Nations conferences.  The new alliance, which coalesced in the past year, has received a major boost from the Bush administration, which appointed anti-abortion activists to several key positions on U.S. delegations to U.N. conferences on global economic and social policy.  (...)  The alliance of conservative Islamic states and Christian organizations has placed the Bush administration in the awkward position of siding with some of its most reviled adversaries -- including Iraq and Iran -- in a cultural skirmish against its closest European allies, which broadly support expanding sexual and political rights. Oh, and there's also  urlLink this , which I suppose is the "soft bigotry" (as he'd put it) of Bush playing abortion politics at the expense of women around the world, including in Afghanistan.  You get the point. (links via the ever-helpful horse)

       NGUYEN WILL IT STOP?   First off, allow me to speak for the  urlLink anti-war movement :  Yes, that was a dumb sign.  You sure got us there!  Ok, back to speaking for me.  The Chamberlain/Hitler analogy has been regurgitated in so many conservative circles in these past few months.  Does Godwin's Law apply?  Or did it when Bush brought up "Hitler-ism" in the SOtU?  (a guy can get his own ism?)  Anyway, whether it does or not, the more apt analogy would be Eisenhower and the Suez crisis, and  urlLink Nicholas Kristof  agrees: There's so much chest-thumping, so many alarums about Iraqi menace, that I sometimes feel that the only patriotic thing to do is to invade Iraq and plow salt into its soil.  So it's useful to conjure a conservative war hero like Dwight Eisenhower and consider what he would do if he were president today. After his experience with Hitler, Ike would stand up to the lily-livered pussy-footing peaceniks and squish Saddam Hussein like a bug, right?  No, probably not.  Eisenhower, who led the European Allies to victory in World War II and was president from 1953 to 1961, faced a crisis in Egypt similar to today's and effectively chose containment rather than invasion. Likewise, even when faced with the threat of weapons of mass destruction, President John F. Kennedy chose to contain Cuba rather than invade it, and President Ronald Reagan chose to contain Libya rather than invade it. I hope we have the courage and discipline to emulate such restraint by Eisenhower, Kennedy and Reagan today and choose containment over war for Iraq.  In Ike's case, he faced a man perceived in the West as a far greater menace than Saddam is today � Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. Again,  urlLink here's that link .  Ah, the plight of the Kurds is brought up.  They control parts of northern and eastern Iraq.  Didn't our dear friend Colin Powell show us satellite photos of a certain camp in land controlled by the Kurds?  Then again, Mr. Nguyen is showing more compassion to the Kurds than the Bush administration is.  From the right's favorite columnist and truth-teller,  urlLink Mr Krugman : Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity! Beyond all this, the usual stuff is found in the  Patriot  piece . . . Saddam's been thoroughly deterred for 12 years, not a threat to world peace . . . Saddam has nothing to do with Al "Queda", there's that Norman-style spelling again, they're  not  a Mexican microbrewery . . . If Nguyen actually went to the protests, his perception of them might mirror how the Grinch saw Whoville's citizens after stealing all their Xmas cheer . . .   Hmm, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and South Africa.  Here's the short-answer portion of this post.  In 2 or 3 sentences, briefly explain why disarmament efforts in those three countries might have gone so smoothly.  Also, when Martin Sheen goes on TV and says "inspections work, war won't", or when MoveOn takes out a full-page ad saying "let the inspections work", isn't that a perceivable agenda, policy or direction?   . . . more UN-bashing . . . Hopefully Mr. Nguyen will soon get a telegram from the Bushies, telling him that Libya has served as our  ally  in the "war on terrah", and then we'll let the cognitive dissonance bounce around in his head for a while . . .   (my last name is "Getzell", it can be pronounced like "pretzel", feel free to joke)

       ANOTHER AMUSING HISTORY LESSON?   It's late, so I won't tackle all of this now, but Mr Nguyen's piece on the " urlLink dark side " of the Democratic Party, in terms of racism, was, well, underwhelming.  The simplest critique is, of course, that nothing any more recent than 40 years ago is mentioned about Democrats (aside from the usual conservative parroting of "robert byrd! robert byrd!").  And gee, what recent Republican "sin" does Nguyen fail to mention, lest he spoil the intricate GOP tapestry he weaved?  Oh yeah, that Lott guy.  This renders the piece some form of desperate damage control.  He's the Chairman of the Rules Committee.  Way to exorcise those demons, Republicans.  MLK is invoked... what would he have thought of his birthday being used by the Bushies to attack a university's admissions policy that sough to cater to an important American and world value, that being diversity.  Condi is mentioned . . . On "Meet the Press" a couple of months ago, she mentioned that she probably wouldn't be where she is today without a certain policy.  Gee, my memory's a bit fuzzy, what was it?  When Nixon said "states' rights", you honestly don't think that may have been a wink/nudge to southern whites?  (same with when ford, reagan, reagan again, bush 1, bush 1 again, dole and bush 2 did) In this campaign Nixon only endorsed those Republicans who were not members of the John Birch Society. Hmm, I'm thinking of a certain former governor of California who made a brief appearance in  American Beauty ... and will never have his face on any currency of any denomination...  That very last paragraph is some kind of joke, right?  Outrageous, check... straw man ("If you don�t believe in high taxes and an expansion of government programs, you are racist"), check... and of course, the final couplet: Fifty years ago Democrats campaigned by stirring up racial fears, opposing color-blind laws, and silencing those who oppose them. In many ways they still do. The word isn't "fear" for the Democrats, it's "denial" for the Republicans.  If the problems stemming from racism had truly been solved significantly by now, perhaps I'd think differently, but racism still rears its ugly head from time to time, whether through Lott, Bob Barr, Ashcroft's anti-White/Hormel crusade, the false-positive felon purges from the voter rolls in Florida, Bill O'Reilly's "wetbacks" comment, Bush's 2000 visit to Bob Jones University, not to mention his decision not to visit Jasper nor to condemn the flying of the confederate flag in SC, or otherwise.  anyway, that's enough for now.  I have a cold.

       CPW LOVE-LETTERS   I'd hate to steal a graphic from Bartcop, you know, like this one,     ...so, um, I wont. (:  But I will address my adoring fanmail in a similar mode.  (and by the way, I rather enjoy being  urlLink slightly more liberal than Bartcop , hehehe)  I love getting things like this, lets me know I'm not fully wasting my time, and these people feel they have to deal with me, or that they're on the defensive, etc.  Anyway, "Joan" writes (at 230AM, no less): Glad to see you read the Patriot- maybe it'll knock some sense into you. Bzzzt! I know you'll be incredulous to know that any non-conservative (and I'm not talking Snehal here, I'm talking John and Jane Q Centrist) is more or less impervious to the entirety of the publication.  Simply, it's just a circle jerk  (that's why every email I've received from a conservative or  Patriot  staffer regarding this blog has been rude and defensive, they don't like their circle-jerk having a wrench thrown into it and such).  I hate to disappoint you. It seems to me that what the Patriot argues with intelligence and wit, you counter with dried up liberal slander which has absolutely no basis. Yeah, playing on people's fear, euphemizing the deaths of thousands of civilians, and plagiarizing other web sites, intelligent and witty indeed!  Apparently I used dried up, partisan slander.  I'll address that by saying my site is not a liberal response necessarily, but rather a clash of "reason" against an "often stupid and intellectualy dishonest" publication.  I am a liberal, a proud one, and a patriotic one (I even - gasp! - support the troops!).  However, the extent of my political views is not directly pertinent to this site.  The  Patriot  often reads like parody, it's a fact.  "Joan"'s charge of slander on my part becomes even more amusing as her next couple of sentences arrive: Frankly,  I think you're an ass .  I just happened upon the site, but i guarantee that i'll return to get  commie-idiot  quotes to share with my own branch of the California College Republicans. ( italics mine ) If "commie-idiot" isn't dried up partisan slander, ma'am, then I don't know what is.  Smarter monkeys, please. I happened to be at the convention this past weekend, and the reason it appeared that there were fewer than 200 people is that republicans stay on the sidewalks so not to block traffic, occupy the police force, piss people off, etc. and were covering more than two full blocks at the time. Doesn't explain the pictures at the plaza, sorry. ...and, not to play the race card, but our 2002-2003 CCR chairman is african-american. Well whoop-dee-doo.  Judging from the pictures, such diversity doesn't seem to, um, "trickle down", if you will. so keep slinging shit onto the website, i'm sure our great country is now enriched and informed. -Joan Way to change the tone, sister!  As God once said (according to the simpsons, at least):   "Joan, give  me  your dessert!

       ("some") CONGRATULATIONS!   Mr Cise did his lil'  urlLink war recap  piece a couple of weeks ago, and that's all fine and good.  Before I go any further, it's time to present the  Patriot  with a medal:     That's right, girls and (mostly) boys, you are among the recipients of the "Civilian Warmonger Medal of Armchair Valor"!  My hat is off to you!  (via  urlLink whitehouse.org )  Anyway, Mr Cise needs some help figuring out who brought down the big statue.  The only way we'll find WMD's in Iraq is if Mr Cise plants them there, apparently.  And, in a euphemism that rings of "shmuck",  This victory was not without great cost. Even with great effort to avoid civilian casualties,  some  civilians were killed (emphasis mine) Hmm, "some", you say?  Let's crunch the numbers...  Right now, as of this writing, the  urlLink comprehensive count  has the number of civilian casualties between 2050 and 2514.  Only a few hundred more than that were killed in the September 11th Attacks.  Would Mr Cise or anyone else at the  Patriot  ever be caught saying that "some" people were killed on 9/11?  Very slimy, indeed.  UPDATE:  urlLink Paul Bruno  has more

       I'D ALSO BE INTERESTED TO SEE...   ...what the  Patriot  has to say about Senator Rick Santorum (R-Homophobe).  They spoke out on Lott, which gave them a slight shred of PC cred (though it's widely known that Republicans had other motivations for wanting to oust him as majority leader; if they were serious about racism, Lott wouldn't still be one of the hundred).  This is your chance, (mostly) boys!  You get to stand up for sexual freedom  and  small government!  One wonders if this is quite the wedge issue among the traditional conservative leaners and the small-L libertarians in the office...

       HOW QUAINT   Aww, how cute!  They assembled  urlLink two hundred republicans  -- "from across the state", no less -- and marched on people's park, a place that's home to people who didn't have their parents' money and social connections to fall back on!  (though I might like to mention that none of the posted photos suggest anything near "more than two hundred" students present.  charming nevertheless... when the antiwar movement takes to the streets, it counts by the tens of thousands or more, but two hundred is fun too!  and hey, it beats those 39 in Michigan a couple months ago!)  And a hearty congratulations to  Patriot  editor Steve Sexton for making it  almost  all the way through an article without quoting someone from his own staff.   CLUMSY ERROR OR HOPELESS WISHFUL THINKING?   A little further down in the article, Sexton mentions some of the honored guests at their wannabe "Heston-at-Columbine" convention: From  State Senate Majority Leader Jim Brulte  to Congressmen Doug Ose and George Radanovich, the republican legislators also impressed upon the young activists the importance of the role they will play in �re-electing President Bush� and �sending (California Senator) Barbara Boxer back to Marin in 2004.� (emphasis mine) As anyone who follows state politics could tell you (not to mention anyone with enough brain cells to conduct a simple Google search), Mr Brulte is the State Senate  Minority  Leader.  Oops!   I DON'T MEAN TO PLAY "THE RACE CARD", BUT...   Looking through those pictures, I can't help but see  beaucoup de personnes blanches .  At least 95% there.  Also, I don't know, but don't posters like "OUR TROOPS FIGHT FOR PEACE" and "GIVE WAR A CHANCE" kind of prove the other side's point?   AND ONE MORE PROBLEM   In the middle of  urlLink this pic  of a gathering at the plaza, a small poster in the middle reads "DISARM SADDAM".  First of all, something tells me that this was an old poster, which is good news, I'm glad to see that the ever-so-eco-friendly BCR's are recycling.  Secondly, didn't this poster-bearer get the word from the administration on  urlLink the search for wmd's ?  Ok that was fun.  Have a wonderful day!

       FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY   Ahh, campus conservatives.  From the  urlLink Yale Daily News : Several male students, one wielding a wooden plank, broke into the suite of an anti-war activist in Calhoun College March 27 and wrote a hateful note on her bedroom message board, said the victim, Katherine Lo '05. Lo said the incident occurred a day after she hung an American flag upside-down from her bedroom window to protest the war in Iraq.  Yale Police Lt. Michael Patten confirmed that a group of students entered Lo's suite, wrote a message on her whiteboard and left without confrontation. Patten would not confirm additional details because the incident is still under investigation.  After the group of students attempted several times to enter her bedroom, Lo said they wrote an inflammatory message on her whiteboard that was aimed at Muslims and anti-war protesters.  The message contained a violent call for the killing of Iraqis and Muslims, Lo said. She said the message ended with the words, "I hate you, GO AMERICA." Police would not comment on the content of the message.  Dean of Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg called the incident "heinous."  "People have a right to express themselves," she said. "People do not have a right to break in and harass students where they live." I'm gonna go on record and say that these conservative thugs at Yale are acting lower on the ol' discourse scale than, say, non-violent demonstrations at Sproul or Wheeler.  Also, when boys with 2x4's are at your door, they ain't coming in to steal publications, for example.  Imagine what these plank-brandishing students would have been able to accomplish if Mr Barnett had been there to  urlLink make some holes in the wall ...

       "DRILLING FOR FEAR MAKES THE JOB SIMPLE"   I just wanted to  urlLink stick this LA Times story  on support for the war out there, either just for the heck of it, or more likely, because of its closing paragraph: Nearly eight in 10 Americans now accept the Bush administration's contention � disputed by some experts � that Hussein has "close ties" to Al Qaeda (even 70% of Democrats agree). And 60% of Americans say they believe Hussein bears at least some responsibility for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks � a charge even the administration hasn't levied against him. Gosh, I hope some responsible, idealistic student publication with a nose for the truth cleans up that mess and enlightens America as to whether Saddam has "close ties" or helped carry out 9/11.  Could the  Patriot  do that?  While they're at it, they could also inform America that  urlLink none of the hijackers were Iraqi , I'm sure that would come as a surprise to many.  Yeah!  Sounds like a job for the Patri--  urlLink oh  . . .  urlLink nevermind .

       PROTESTING THE PROTEST   Initially, I decided to leave Mr Sexton's  urlLink account of the Sproul protest  alone, mostly because spring break came along, love was in the air, and I was spending too much energy being happy about this:     (if you don't want to hear him, tell him to make bad movies . . . you know, like bo derek and shannen doherty do)  Anyway... as I said, I had planned to leave it alone, but Mr Engberg's " urlLink news analysis " came along after Sexton's, so it's time to have some fun.  One of the implications here seems to be that the anti-war movement (in Berkeley or wherever else, it isn't clear after a while, there is a part-for-the-whole implication on Engberg's part here) is being anti-troops.  First of all, any rational thinker, not to mention rational observers of the anti-war movement in action (whether direct at a street corner, or through a lit candle) can tell you that opposing the war and administration policy are thoroughly different from non-support of the troops.  Engberg doesn't draw on any specific evidence regarding non-support, other than "ranting" and "raving" by speakers from the rally.  (where's the, um, "analysis"?)  Attempting to give him as much benefit of the doubt as possible, perhaps he is referring to the yellow-ribbon episode described in Sexton's earlier piece: Surrounded by the peace activists, members of the Berkeley College Republicans distributed yellow ribbons as a symbol of support for the U.S. troops. They were able to hand some off to opponents of the war, while others of the protesters jeered and derided the troops. Some anti-war activists took the yellow ribbons, threw them on the ground and stomped on them repeatedly. Others took the basket filled with the ribbons and hurled it across the plaza, causing many of the small yellow ribbons to fall to the plaza ground. Is it within the realm of possibility that the actions taken against the ribbons by some at the protest may have been a response to what amounted to an attempt by the BCR's to look for trouble and create a scene, all while cynically using our men and women in Iraq as pawns for their politics?  Part of supporting the troops is trying to get them home as soon as possible; they're not the ones who dragged us into this foreign policy debacle.  Quoting a Republican freshman doesn't reinforce the argument any further.  A longer discussion could center around the idea that the campus protest movement is a bit iconoclastic when it comes to "patriotic" symbols like flags and yellow ribbons.  But anti-symbol doesn't necessarily mean anti-patriotic.  Perhaps, also, a realization of the worldwide implications of our current action in Iraq renders the protest movement bigger than just an issue of American patriotism.  This idea is certainly relevant to the situation in Berkeley surrounding the 9/11 anniversary several months ago.  Ooh, speaking of 9/11, from Engberg's final 'graf, on how we should all join hands, sing songs and support the war gleefully, says: ...Remember the three-week bipartisan lovefest we experienced after 9/11? Why did it occur? It occurred because abnormal times mandated a deviation from normalcy. Under normal circumstances, our nation is divided strictly along partisan lines. We often forget that we are Americans. Now, however, the time has come to remember once again that we are not identified by the party we vote for, but by the country we live in... Engberg seems unable to understand how we could unite after 9/11 but not after this war starts.  What's the difference between 9/11 and the Iraq war?  We united after 9/11 because  we were attacked !  We were not attacked by Iraq, we have never been attacked by Iraq, and no evidence exists showing Iraq to be an imminent threat to our security!  (just yesterday, the discovery of white powder - gasp! - turned out to be, well,  urlLink explosives , again not our promised WMD)  There are many other reasons why there is not unity behind this war, but that one seems to stick out the most.  Oh, and  urlLink this too .  (hmm 764 Iraqi civilians killed in just over two weeks, I have a feeling that's better than Saddam's 2-week average over the course of his rule . . . just a thought, read into it at your peril, hehe)

       AT LEAST HE SPELLED "AL QAEDA" CORRECTLY   Page 22, Seth Norman's piece.  (go to their  urlLink main site  and download the May pdf)  If Mr Norman is really going into the Army this fall, then I salute and support him.  Though I wonder, gee, why might the job market be so tough this year?  (crackpot theory: dubya is putting the economy into a nosedive to force more people to enlist! yeah, that's it!)  Too bad about the  urlLink business thing , though history is fun.  My curious question is: What exactly is the link between observing the post-9/11 behavior of some in the Berkeley left, and supporting tax cuts, privatization of social security and gutting medicare (among other highlights of the Republican platform)?  This all seems like simple, us/them childishness to me.

       CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS   (the only implication of making the print edition available online only through a pdf download is that i can't excerpt it as easily.  hahaha, download it from their site and we'll play the home game.)  Page 12, John Lee's piece. The many Cassandras who predicted only gloom and doom in the run-up towards the war are now fiercely trying to backpedal on many of their previous pessimistic projections.  After taking positions that could only have been redeemed had both the United States and the Iraqi people suffered untold tragedy, many of these anti-war types are stuck with either feeling forlorn at the lack of death in this conflict or pondering that maybe, just maybe, the US is good for something in this world (first of all, yes, Clinton's military made short work of Iraq)  The Bushies told us, over and over again, that the reason for going to war was primarily WMD's, and that Iraq posed a threat both regionally and to us because of them.  But Lee, and the right, are trying to have it both ways.  The speedy conquest of Iraq doesn't have much bearing at all on the anti-war viewpoint; however, what it  does  prove is that Saddam's regime  urlLink did not pose much of a threat at all .  As Arianna points out in the linked piece, we told France, Russia etc that we couldn't wait another  30 days !  Obviously those opposing war were dead wrong.  On top of that, in the case of WMD's, our team is  urlLink leaving  without a shred of proof.  Either 1) there were never any, and we went to war on false pretenses, or 2) they've been smuggled off to other regimes or the black market.  Particularly in the 2nd case, boy did we do something good in the world or what, John!  Yeah, I know, I must be resorting to "factoids".  Of course, White House officials have  urlLink trivialized  the WMD-angle too.  (but of course, magically, suddenly it isn't at all about wmd's, the reason all along was liberation!  by the way, we've always been at war with eastasia...)  Most likely, our troops had authorization to use deadly force to protect the oil ministry.  Remember, we're telling them, with our actions, precisely how much we really care about their culture and history.  And hospitals were being looted too, if you want to talk about people.  Go ahead and keep your crow, kid.  You'll need it for when Bush's new tax cut  doesn't  create those 1.4 million new jobs.

      The  Patriot  briefly makes it into this hilarious  urlLink LA Times piece  on conservative student publications.  The  urlLink Liquid List  is right on the mark on this one, basically that 1) conservative publications on campuses are generally little more than front organizations for campus conservative outfits, 2) their "journalism" essentially amounts to threats, and 3) they believe free speech includes silencing others.  Tarek writes: Most disturbing, then, is the possibility that, to exercise the free speech rights of a conservative is to indict, intimidate and harass others exercising their rights. Many of the statements made by new right-wing journal editors cleave closely to the "everybody is a leftist, so it's my turn" philosophy, but they are making an assumption that is false: There has always been room for more than one belief, and your belief doesn't need to destroy or defeat another belief to get recognition. Indeed.

       "UNNAMED REPUBLICAN"   If you recall in Sexton's  urlLink piece  on the CCR convention in Berk last week, he mentioned legislators who spoke at the convention of encouraging students to play a role in "sending Barbara Boxer back to Marin in 2004".  (quick note:  It's been about a week, and Jim Brulte is  still  State Senate Majority Leader, you guys planning on fixing that?)  Now we're beginning to see why the higher-up Republicans want the students to play a role: as of this writing,  urlLink no one is running against her . WASHINGTON -- Republicans say they can't wait to take on Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer in next year's election. But 18 months before Election Day -- and 10 months before the Republican primary -- all they've done is talk.   Republicans mentioned as potential candidates: at least 10. Declared Republican challengers: 0. According to the SM County Times piece, they're even talking about  Ah-nuld  running against Boxer next year rather than against, say, Rob Reiner in 06.  Nevermind that he'll be coming off the third  Terminator  movie, which looks like a stinker from here, and is directed by James Cam-- er, an unknown.  Then again, if he doesn't throw his cybernetic hat in the ring, the GOP primary will be a yet-to-be-determined horse-race between "What's-her-face", "So-and-so" and "The ugly one".  And since numbers are so much fun . . . Number of declared Republican challengers to Boxer: 0.  Number of declared Democratic challengers to Bush: 9. (10 if you count LaRouche, hahaha).

       OOH!  IT'S FLASHBACK TIME!   Let's go back to Kelso Barnett's " urlLink I Want World Peace " piece from the lead-up to the Iraq war. Since we've given peace a chance, three thousand Americans forever lay dead on the southern tip of Manhattan. Who knows how many more there are to come if Iraq and Al Qaeda  continue  not only to exchange ideas and support, but weapons. Apparently  urlLink gullible  isn't in the dictionary. The report of the joint congressional inquiry into the suicide hijackings on Sept. 11, 2001, to be published Thursday, reveals U.S. intelligence had no evidence that the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein was involved in the attacks, or that it had supported al-Qaida, United Press International has learned.  "The report shows there is no link between Iraq and al-Qaida," said a government official who has seen the report. Make sure and read the rest.  UPDATE: elsewhere, from Seth Norman's column in the May print issue, on his desire to serve with the military in Iraq: In a lot of ways, working in Iraq will be a lot like working in Berkeley -- and not only because both are suspected havens for Al Qaeda operatives. Heh.

       "IT'S YOUR MONEY" . . . "DEATH TAX" . . . "YOU'RE EITHER WITH US, OR YOU'RE WITH THE TERRORISTS" . . . "HE GASSED HIS OWN PEOPLE!" . . . AND NOW THIS  Patriot  responds to study that finds conservatives oversimplify . . . by oversimplifying   You just  knew  they were gonna be pissed about  urlLink this .  First, read the above link, to UCB's release on the study.  Then,  urlLink Norman and Gallais' response  (note the 5:18am timestamp).  Then come back here.  Norman and Gallais (who is quoted in his own article, I don't get that) quote a portion of the report on the study: Particularly irksome to campus Republicans were examples in American politics, which the researchers claimed supported their argument.  �Concerns with fear and threat, likewise, can be linked to a second key dimension of conservatism - an endorsement of inequality, a view reflected in the Indian caste system, South African apartheid and the conservative, segregationist politics of the late Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-South S.C.).� BCR president Andrea Irvin, um, responds: �These types of comparisons are ridiculous,� Irvin said.  �To mention  caste systems , apartheid and Strom Thurmond in the same sentence implies that  racism  is a key feature of conservatism.  This is clearly a political agenda being passed off as a legitimate study. Rather than constructively addressing the issues, they attempt to offend their opponents through rhetorical spin.� (emphases mine) Andrea, Andrea, Andrea.  With this sort of A) blanket oversimplification of the nature of the Indian caste system, and B) misrepresentation of the researchers' words, you're going a mighty way to prove their point for them!  In the meantime,  urlLink read this , shouldn't take more than a day.  Of course, doesn't the elimination of the estate tax carry with it an "endorsement of inequality"?  Norman and Gallais attack the researchers by arguing that fascism is based on socialism.  Such a statement has just about as much importance as saying that the Republican Party should be dominant in America because we refer to our country as a "Republic".  Fascism is  urlLink nowhere  in the  urlLink neighborhood  of socialism.  Even  urlLink Trotsky, circa 1931  disputes this.  The closest you can get is to say that fascism employs some socialist tactics, and that Mussolini was a one-time socialist.  In marching down Telegraph and holding statement-making bake sales, campus conservatives endorse similar tactics to those of "campus liberals" among whom socialism is "popular", do they not?  And hey, David Horowitz and Christopher Hitchens were once socialists on some level, does that mean they still are?  Besides, even if there existed more significant overlap between fascism and socialism than actually exists, their statement would still constitute oversimplification.  Oops.  All that remains of the  Patriot  piece amounts to little more than subjective complaints about a study they have yet to read.  Sure, our tax dollars funded this study, but aren't they also about to fund, to the tune of $67 million plus, Darrell "Gone in 60 Seconds" Issa's attempt at subversion of democracy, one that even the national GOP washes its hands of?  Anyway...

       STATE OF DEEP,  DEEP  CONCERN   In light of Yellowcake-gate, I thought I'd revisit the Patriot's  urlLink SOTU piece  (by Mr McFadden, who from the tone of it, was trying to nudge Howard Fineman out of the way to take his place under Bush's desk), to see if there was anything, uh, let's be polite . . .  prescient  there. The resulting prosecution of a second Gulf  urlLink War , coupled with the performance of the American  urlLink economy  over the next eighteen months, will likely determine whether Bush's presidency is deemed a success or a failure in 2004. Fair enough!  Though, in hindsight, the most interesting thing about the  Patriot  piece is the cover photo:     Created from many opinions, details and revisions, a draft is  reviewed by President Bush , Counselor Karen Hughes, Chief of Staff Andy Card and National Security Advisor Dr. Condoleezza Rice (holding the notebook, foreground) in the Oval Office, Thursday, Jan. 24. (http://www.whitehouse.gov)   And I do congratulate the  Patriot  for exposing an even more obvious lie from the SOTU: "We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and other generations," the President  urlLink promised . Hmm, something tells me Redford wont be playing any of these guys in the movie.

        PATRIOT  WRITERS VS REHNQUIST   If you strayed past  urlLink Marissa's column  on her upcoming Peace Corps service in yesterday's DailyCal, you might have stumbled upon a piece by  Patriot  editors Steve Sexton and Kelly Coyne, on last weeks SCOTUS ruling on  urlLink affirmative action .  Of course, if you're familiar with the girls and (mostly) boys of the  Patriot , you can more-or-less guess at the entire content of the piece.  In fact, the first sentence will do: In its decision upholding affirmative action last week, the Supreme Court failed to once and for all put and end to  the greatest injustice in our nation's history : the institutional discrimination against a citizen on the basis of his race. (italics mine) That's some heavy company Sexton and Coyne are giving themselves there.  Reminds me of that time back in 1831 when Nat Turner got waitlisted at University of Virginia, and had to settle for Virginia  Tech .  Poor guy, no wonder he revolted.  Chief Justice William Rehnquist dissented, placing him on the  Patriot 's "side".  Obviously he wanted to end  the greatest injustice in our nation's history , right?  Well, if you recall, there's  urlLink this : I fully realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position for which I have been excoriated by liberal colleagues, but I think Plessy v. Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed. Anyway, better luck next time guys, too bad all those cookies went to waste.

       I KNEW THE '02 ELECTIONS WENT BADLY, BUT  JEEZ !   Reader Jon uncovers a  Patriot  writer whose lost track of time: By the way, I wanted to point you to this item from the BCR Bulletin.  In the column Get to Know..., there's a profile of BCR member Amaury Gallais.  When asked why he's a Republican, Gallais said, "I was a Democrat until the 2002 presidential election."  Ummm....yeah...  Somebody has a chronology problem. Oops!  I think Mr Gallais, the  Patriot 's managing editor, needs some help from his comrades.  And I have a suggestion...  In the February column titled " urlLink Barbara Lee Doesn't Really Speak for Me ", co-writers Robb McFadden and Kelso Barnett write: We at the Patriot take issue with Congresswoman Lee's assertion that, when it comes to the Constitution, we're misinformed. On the contrary,  we know our Constitution so well , that we stand up for it against all enemies.  (italics mine) Robb and Kelso claim to have a formidable knowledge of the Constitution of the United States of America.  Well, if that's the case, they don't seem to have shared said knowledge with their buddy Amaury Gallais.  Article II, Section 1 will do just fine ("He shall hold his Office during the  Term of four Years ").  Hopefully someone will bring this to Amaury's attention this thursday night.  Or else, he's got to be sitting there wondering why Dean, Kerry, et al are campaigning for the 2006 election so early.  At this time, I'd like to mention that the California Patriot Watch will be accepting submissions and tips via email, and those who send such items will be properly credited.  And speaking of the Constitution,  urlLink this is a great resource .

       THE ADVENTURES OF BARRON MUNCHAUSEN   Hark!  That "pathetic", summer-school-attending, "weak", "ass"-like "commie idiot" you all know and loathe is back!  Namely, me.  Last night I took a break from recording long enough to see that the girls and (mostly) boys of everyone's favorite clumsy student-run conservative publication are back from their yachts, country clubs, ranches, summer sessions, Cheney energy task force meetings, Toby Keith concerts, and  barracks  couches.  They have a new issue up.  Nothing worthy of a Drudge link here, especially given what the guy has  urlLink recently linked to , hahaha.  Nay, all we have here are a school of fish, flapping around in the veritable barrel that is the Berkeley right.  Our first fish is Ben Barron, who like Mister Munchausen, seems enamored with tall tales.  Only this time he isn't misleadingly  urlLink merging Saddam and Al Qaeda .  He's been put on the recall beat, putting together a rather entertaining  urlLink piece  that attempts to paint Davis as undemocratic for  opposing his own removal .  Unfortunately for Barron, the only way he can even argue this point is through deception and the use of outdated, selective information.  Goggles on...  The latest Gallup Poll  shows that  more than two-thirds  of the state will vote to ouster Davis, a whopping 40 percent of whom are Democrats. (italics mine) The little red numbers under Barron's name on the piece indicate that this story was posted last night, 8/27, in the evening.  The latest Gallup Poll on the recall was, well,  urlLink two weeks prior .  Why would Barron use a two-week old poll for his piece when there has been plenty of polling done since then by other prominent and respected organizations, such as, for instance, the  urlLink Los Angeles Times , whose poll was released just a few days ago?  Or the 8/15 Field Poll, released a couple days after "Gallup's latest", showing  urlLink 58% support  for the recall, rather than "more than two-thirds"?  Oh yeah, that's why:  Because Barron doesn't want us to see information that throws doubt on his viewpoint.  Over the last two weeks, polling has shown a decline in support for Davis' ouster from "more than two thirds", to 58%, to 50%.  But since Barron yammers on about the Gallup Poll, let's see what else he has to say. That's right �  California Democrats would rather risk  their party losing the most powerful position in the state than see Davis run their government for even one more day. Republicans could not push this recall through alone.   But despite the popular support the once-fledgling recall has seen, entrenched officials of the Democratic Party are doing what they can to preserve Davis's job, even though that means undermining the collective will of their own constituency. Of course, he's talking about the 40% of Democrats who supported the recall as of August 13.  Looking at the  urlLink poll , you can see those 40%, but you can  also  see that at that point, a majority of Democrats (52%) opposed the recall.  So Mr Barron, how can you be talking about "California Democrats" on the whole and be talking about a minority of them  at the same time ?  It's fitting that he mentions Orwell, for this is quite an exercise in doublethink.  Remember above how I italicized Barron's claim that "more than two-thirds" supported the removal of Davis, circa two-plus weeks ago?  Well, the poll itself shows 64 percent in favor of the recall.  This wouldn't be an issue if Barron had said that "around" or "about" two-thirds supported the recall on August 13.  However, he didn't say that, he said support amounted to  more  than two-thirds.  This is an outright lie.  Considering that the Gallup poll cited by Barron and the  Patriot  hit the presses before Davis even started in earnest his campaign to save his governorship, including his speech at UCLA on the 19th, using it seems, well, un-useful.  Support for the recall was high only because at the time the state's population was only hearing one side of the story.  A hypothetical: Let's say that governors in California (or " Kuh-lee-FORR-na ", as a certain 2nd-place recall candidate says) were not term-limited and Pete Wilson was still governor.  Let's also say that the public would be very upset with him, as the energy de-regulation plan he signed allowed our state to be gouged by the Enrons and Dukes of the world.  So upset are they that they'd gather sufficient signatures to recall him.  Now here's the question for Barron and the  Patriot : If Wilson launched an ambitious campaign effort to save his job and not be recalled, when a majority of Californians wanted him out, many of them Republican (it could happen, Wilson's raised some taxes before, and hey, that's reason enough for conservatives in  urlLink Nevada ), would it be acceptable to you for him to do so?  Or would you criticize him of "undermining the will of [his] own constituency?  The Gallup poll cited by Barron has some problems of its own, as  urlLink Paul Bruno  points out.  Of course, none of this matters, Davis will be re-re-elected a little more than a month from now.

"I need you to join me in showing we reject the divisive politics some in the GOP are passing on to a new generation of Republicans," Kerry wrote in the e-mail Thursday, also posted on his campaign Web site.

       ANGRY CLAM: A SAFE HARBOR FOR HATE?  (submitted by reader John P.)   This is not strictly the Cal Patriot, but  urlLink Angry Clam . However, Rory Miller of Angry Clam still wrote for the Patriot before deciding to go to UCLA law school so I guess it applies. I was looking at his  urlLink most recent post  on the 9th Circuit's delay of the recall election, but what was most interesting was some of the ignorant racist comments in the comment section. Here's a few choice selections:   "This furthers the case needed for a good old fashion lynch mob to overrule the 9th Circuit."  "The 9th Circuit does this because they can. It is almost like: 'This is what we're doing.. Now watchyou gonna do about it, whitey?'"  "By the way, the DMV now stands for Department of Mexican Voters..."  "the hordes of illegals would probably have trouble with them (it does require some degree of intelligence)"   When you post this on your site, can you title it "Angry Clam: A Safe Harbor for Hate"? ( Done! -cpw ) Rory Miller aka the Clam once wrote an article for FrontPage magazine on the web, titled " urlLink Berkeley: A Safe Harbor for Hate ." I just want to see if it provokes a reaction in him. Like the Reese Witherspoon character in   urlLink Election  , he must be stopped now before it's too late. (OK, I'm exaggerating here, but not by much.) Tend to your own garden, I suppose.  If you remember back to spring of 2002, Mr Miller was the  Patriot  writer who correctly predicted that "Bill Simon can't win", though he thought he was being ironic at the time.  Of course, thanks to the recall campaign, he was proven right  twice !  (note: because of the  Patriot 's new 2003 web layout design -- the best feature of which being that it is Reagan-free -- pre-'03 articles have gone down the memory hole, so no link)  If I were to add an Exhibit B to John's email, I'd mention Miller's " urlLink editorial notice " that he would, from then on, refer to Palestinians in the West Bank as Jordanians and Palestinians in Gaza as Egyptians (scroll down to his July 19 entry).  Doesn't such a tactic put him in league with this guy?     Slobodan tried to "ethnically cleanse" the ethnic Albanian populations in Kosovo, justifying such action by referring to them as Albanian, right?  I wonder what kinda rates STA has for direct flights from LAX to the Hague (hehe).

       MORE FUZZY MATH   Sometimes, you look too hard and miss the more obvious nonsense.  Thanks to Paul Bruno for the tip, after you're done here you'd be well-advised to drop by  urlLink his neck of the net .  From Angela Brewer's  urlLink recall piece , let's look at paragraph 2:  Efforts to recall Governor Gray Davis began almost immediately following his narrow reelection last November as many disgruntled voters accused Davis of deceiving the state�s populace about the dismal financial state and ultimately driving California into debt.   The state budget deficit is  now  estimated at upwards of $38 billion .  In late February of this year, petitions began circulating to collect the necessary 900,000 signatures to put a recall measure on the ballot.  By July, nearly that number had been amassed by pro-recall volunteers. (emphasis, and double-emphasis mine) Well, if Brewer wrote this back in early July, then yes, the Cali budget shortfall would be 38 bil.  Her comments at the end of the article on the apparent inevitability of Davis' ouster seem to suggest that it may well have been written in July.  But nooooo, her piece is timestamped 8/27/03, 9:31pm to be exact.  In the actual late-august definition of "now", the deficit, under the new budget, is  urlLink closer to $8 billion .  Say what you will about the budget the legislature passed and Davis signed--heck, no parties are happy with it--but it is what it is.  So to add it up:  In the  Patriot 's world, 8 billion is 38 billion, support for the recall is  urlLink increasing , and 64% equals "more than two-thirds".

       THE "TREND-CHALLENGED"  PATRIOT    Ms. Brewer's  urlLink piece  on the development of the recall election in California is actually somewhere in the neighborhood of straight reporting, much as former  Patriot  writer Mike MacFarlane's February  urlLink piece  on affirmative action was.  While her contention in paragraph 2 that the motivation behind the recall involved some sort of deception on the budget masks the greater motive for the Cali wingers (we...we wanted a do-over!), I'll let that slide.  But not that last paragraph, where Angela is suddenly afflicted with a serious case of Barron-itis, that well-known illness defined as "a viral infection causing the stricken individual to rabidly (and mercilessly) avoid any recent information capable of casting doubt upon the individual's point when writing a column for a clumsy student-run conservative publication".  Brewer writes:  The recall of Davis seems to become a greater reality with each passing day , and California voters must decide who can take his place and solve all of the problems he�s left behind for his successor. (emphasis mine) As I mentioned in the post on  urlLink Barron's piece , polling trends are, in general, showing a  decline  in support for the recall, from 64%* (Gallup, 8/13) to 58% (Field Poll, 8/15) to 50% (LA Times, a week later).  Perhaps if we had multiple recent recall polls from the same organization we'd have a more refined sense of public opinion trends, but this still seems pretty clear.  Just as with Barron's piece, Angela Brewer's is dated August 27, a point at which there was a highly sufficient amount of polling data available to essentially refute the idea that the ouster of Davis is becoming more and more of a reality.  And only now is Dianne Feinstein, arguably the most respected politician in California, beginning to run ads against the recall, so even with recent polling contradicting the  Patriot 's view, I'd advise them to check back in two weeks, because the news will be even worse for them.  (* - another symptom of Barron-itis is to refer to 64% as "more than two-thirds")

       SEXTON: RECALL BUSH!    urlLink Oh, that Steve Sexton . It may be too early to determine whether Tuesday�s landslide victory for Arnold Schwarzenegger marks a GOP realignment in California. Well, since Arnold ran much more as  Arnold  than as a Republican, and since both Republican-backed ballot initiatives  urlLink went down in race-baiting flames , I would file some sort of political realignment in the state in the wishful-thinking circular file. Democratic opposition to the recall was predictable. But the lengths to which Davis and Democratic hacks went to subvert the will of the people are telling. Thirteen times they went to court to try and stop the recall, which 55 percent of voters approved Tuesday. Republican opposition to the twice-elected Governor Gray Davis was predictable.  But the lengths to which Issa and Republican hacks went to subvert the will of the people are telling. In their defense of Davis and their opposition to the recall, Democrats have sounded outright undemocratic. It was Davis who quipped on the campaign trail that Schwarzenegger shouldn�t be allowed to be governor because he pronounces California as Caleeeforneeea. How does that show Democrats being "undemocratic"?  I'm sure all those women would have voted not to be groped, but anyway.  Look out, Dorothy!  Here comes a strawman: On Wednesday, lamenting Schwarzenegger�s victory, Califonia Congresswoman and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Tuesday a sad day for our state. �It shouldn't be that public officials have to watch their backs every moment for fear of recall,� she said.   But that�s exactly what we want: politicians watching their backs, not straying from the will of the people. We want accountability in governance and the recall gives us just that. Pelosi�s vision of a government that isn�t accountable to the people, should scare us all. That Davis thinks an accent is a greater disqualification for governor than five years of failed leadership should anger us all. Um Steve, contrary to your apparent belief, it  is  possible for elected officials to be held accountable by the people without the possibility that a former car-thief might bankroll a partisan power-grab.  It's called elections.  From the sound of it, Steve could also draw the conclusion that President Bush is, therefore, not being held accountable, and should be subject to recall.  He shouldn't have to "watch his back" for something like that, right?  Then, watch Steve as he gets a little star-struck and confuses special effects with actual executive leadership: And of course, as they are prone to do, they gave us another dose of puke politics. Failing to formulate a vision they could sell to Californians, they resorted to the politics of personal destruction. This time, though, they went up against a man too big, too strong to be brought down.  On Tuesday, voters said the greatest state in the country deserves a great governor. I can see Mr Sexton, in the MTV studios, screaming with his highest head-voice, as Carson Daly introduces Arnold to TRL.  (of course, Arnold would then introduce his hands to... oh never you mind)  And by the way, what did we hear about a "vision" for California from Arnold?  Other than an "audit", which happens anyway, and a promise to "clean house"?  From the NYT's post-recall editorial: The exit polls did not shed much light on the California voters' feelings, except their profound sense of irritation. A sizeable chunk of the Schwarzenegger voters said they had voted on the issues, but agreed that he had not really addressed them. The strategy was essenially "just stand around and look like Arnold".  And that's good news for me, because "just stand around and look like Dennis Miller/Kelsey Grammer" wont work next year.  Now, on to 'Ton's final graf: Arnold Schwarzenegger may be the man to lead a realignment in California, much as another movie-actor turned politician did 30 years ago. Together with Tom McClintock, Arnold and the Republicans garnered 62 percent of the vote on Tuesday�a sign that California will make room for a California Republican Party that makes room for moderate Republicans like our governor-elect. Awwwwwww!  I'm going to save this paragraph, and keep it with me for around a year.  Because somewhere in there, Arnold and his advisors are going to look at the budget in a sober fashion, realize the McClintockesque budgetary fantasies are just that, and they will propose a tax increase in some form.  The anti-tax  jihadists  of the Cali GOP will definitely fall in line, because Steve Sexton said they should.

       A THEFT GRUDGE IS NO REASON TO SPREAD A FALSE MEME, NOW GET OVER IT!   Damnit, they've grown lazy again, and are only making their stuff online in PDF format.  Where's the dedication, guys?  Well, at least they split the articles up.  Lots of laughs are surely to be had this time around, just as they were last month.  Oh, and we all should have  known  they'd try out a  urlLink Cruz-MECha story  on us.  Vanessa Wiseman goes after the motto, employing a translation meant to cast the motto in the worst possible light.  Journalist/blogger David Neiwert  urlLink explains  the meaning of a more accurate translation: One of the prime examples of distortion in the debate is the way a number of the anti-Mechistas, including [Michelle] Malkin and [Mickey] Kaus, have zeroed in on the MEChA slogan:  Por la Raza, todo. Fuera la Raza, nada .  Kaus offers the translation of this slogan that in fact has been used by every one of the MEChA critics: (Many American Jewish groups fight against assimilation too, but I haven't seen any with a slogan equivalent to "For the Race, everything. For those outside the race, nothing.") Before supposedly smart people go publishing such nonsense, it would help if they consulted, say, a native Spanish speaker (and one would think one would be available somewhere in Santa Monica).  A more accurate translation of the slogan would recognize that though "Por" translates to the English "For," it is used in a very specific sense of the word -- namely, "On behalf of" or "In the service of". "Fuera" is not "for those outside" but rather refers to the speaker, and means "Apart from." So what the slogan actually says is this:  In the service of the race, everything Apart from the race, nothing  There is nothing remotely racist, particularly in the sense of being exclusionist or derogatory, about this, of course. The second line clearly only refers to the need to maintain one's ethnic and cultural identity. It is only racist if you deliberately mistranslate it: "For those outside the race, nothing." I'm sure there's a Spanish speaker or two on the  Patriot  staff, right?  You'd be well-advised to read the rest of  urlLink Neiwert's piece  to get a better idea of whether MECha is or isn't racist.  Beyond that, Wiseman brings in a credible, important source for her article: a Klansman.  That's some good work there.  Oh!  Look, there's Tom McClintock! He was just a "moderate" member, involved more actively with student government.  But during an interview on San Diego radio station KOGO, Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom McClintock blasted such a defense.  "It's like saying, 'Oh, I was a moderate member of the Klan.'  It's incumbent on Cruz Bustamante to clearly and completely renounce the organization and its tactics and its views," McClintock said. If the  Patriot  had any true interest in seeking out and doing away with bigotry, then they should have looked at  urlLink McClintock's past (and present)  as well.  Let's hear about Tom's campaign manager, John Stoos. While we know a great deal about Sen. McClintock's political positions, we don't know much about John Stoos, and what his vision is for California. Stoos is not your ordinary right-wing ideologue: He is a politically savvy campaign strategist who has worked the California political landscape for more than 20 years. He was a former vice-president of the right-wing California Republican Assembly and helped engineer the takeover of California's Republican Party by Christian fundamentalists. Stoos has been a key player in the recall movement, coordinating the DavisRecall.com campaign. According to The Hill, "the Newspaper for and about the U.S. Congress," Stoos was active with People's Advocate, "the group that launched the recall effort earlier this year."    Stoos has a close, long-term association with Chalcedon, a Vallecito, Ca.-based  Christian Reconstructionist organization  . He is a regular contributor to its flagship publication, the Chalcedon Report, "the extended voice of the most important Christian theocratic theologian of the twentieth century, the late R. J. Rushdoony," said Frederick Clarkson, author of the highly acclaimed book "Eternal Hostility: The Struggle Between Theocracy And Democracy" (Common Courage Press, 1997).     "Christian Reconstructionism is a religious and political ideology that believes in the creation of a theocratic state governed by Biblical law,"   Clarkson told me in a recent telephone interview. While this ideology includes a range of beliefs, Stoos by "publishing in the Chalcedon Report, exhibits a fundamental agreement with the principles of Christian Reconstructionism and the people who are currently the standard bearers of CR undoubtedly see Stoos in that light." Some more of Stoos' greatest hits: In an article appearing in the June/July 2003 issue of Chalcedon Report titled "Freedom Under The Fear of God," Stoos writes: "All religions are not equal, and only Christianity reveals the truth about God's nature, creation, man's fall, and the great salvation available through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ. The freedoms and liberties that Americans have enjoyed are the product of this faith, and if we fail to understand the foundations upon which they are built, the United States will lose them in very short order."  Stoos: "Now this may sound simplistic, but these are the only two choices. Either people understand that basic rights come from God and choose to live in a proper fear of God by acknowledging His sovereignty, or people reject God and look to the wisdom and understanding of man to establish what is right and wrong. There are no other choices." And who can forget: At a 1995 forum sponsored by the Center for Ethics and Social Policy of Berkeley, California's Graduate Theological Union, Stoos "revealed that Jews would probably feel out of place in the Christian society he and others are working to implement," longtime writer and researcher Jerry Sloan reported. In the April 1995 issue of the Institute for First Amendment Studies' Freedom Writer Sloan stated that Stoos allowed that Jews and other non-Christians would be "tolerated." Fellow panel member Marty Kassman of the ACLU objected and challenged Stoos: "I don't wish to be tolerated in this country. I was born in this country. I don't think it is any more your country than mine. Or any more a Christian's country [than] a Jew's." According to Sloan, Stoos "shot back that in his vision of Christian society "you would not have total acceptance. You would feel more at home in Israel." And what does Tom think about this? When asked about these views, and whether Sen. McClintock subscribed to them as well, Stoos said that they were his "personal views" and that he wasn't sure if they were "the Senator's views." For that, he said, you'll have to ask the Senator. He added that the Senator was probably too busy to discuss these issues at this time. Well I'm sure the  Patriot  has some time to ask Tom about it!  They care so much about exposing the links between gubernatorial candidates and supposedly hateful organizations!  I can't wait to read about it.

       CISE OF THE MACHINES   (Open your  Patriot 's to page 9)   Patriot  writer John "some civilians were killed" Cise gives us a page worth of grade-A Arnold-fellatio, with his piece titled "Kindergarten Cop".  Look, if we're gonna keep naming articles after his movies, can their relevance be at least more than tangential?  See, look at my title.  It's a pun!  Nevermind...  This article is conveniently substance-free, focusing on little more than Arnold's, to be fair, "broad" rhetoric.  To be fair, that's about what I'd expect, as Arnold has given us precious little else worth writing about (except, you know,  that  stuff).  It's when Cise expands his discussion that he gets into trouble. On the other side of the aisle, Republicans have been in a constant state of celebration, often proclaiming that Californians were only a year away from triumphantly re-electing Bush and sweeping the Democrats out of their stranglehold on the State Legislature. Even if Bush wins the state next year (which, simply enough, won't happen), Gore destroyed Dubya here in 2000 by over twelve percent, so California wouldn't be re-electing Dubya to anything anyway.  Perhaps Cise's sentence requires a bit of a clarification. The pundits spent days after the recall theorizing that it was something of a political revolution in California with effects that would be felt across the whole country. They did?  From the looks of it, Mr Cise seems to be hanging out with fellow  Patriot  writer David Zelster a lot, because they're both using the same rhetorical trick:  Removing the critical word "some" when talking about the opinions of some pundits or experts on a particular issue.  Zelster did this regarding the relationship between the Bush tax giveaways and the economy (see the entry below this one), and now Cise does it regarding the recall.  Since I'm not one to hide behind weaselly language, i will provide the requisite descriptive phrase in my sentence when I declare:   A great proportion  of pundits have observed that the success of the recall effort was the combination of a group of wingers capitalizing on a leader's unusually low approval ratings by using unprecedented means, and the  non-partisan  factor of Arnold Schwarzenegger's celebrity, which gave him support not only many independent voters, but a smattering of Democrats including Bill Lockyer.  And now, Cise's very next sentence: Perhaps, but the recall at least was a very strong indication that Californians are tired of the  poor schools , poor budget management, and especially the political fighting that prevents real solutions to these problems. (emphasis mine) Say what you will about Gray Davis, but if he was voted out for anything, it certainly wasn't for  urlLink his record on education .  In a related story, Grophenfuhrer has just announced his first round of  urlLink proposed budget cuts .  He promised that education would be, in his words, "off the table".  Apparently, that depends on what the definition of "off the table" is: Education officials were distressed to learn that the governor was proposing more cuts to the University of California and Cal State systems after both were hit particularly hard in last year's budget. Among the cuts they face are $110 million for outreach efforts, and an additional $98 million in unallocated cuts.  UC spokesman Brad Hayward said the outreach programs, which seek to help prepare students from disadvantaged backgrounds for college, focus on the neediest students and ways to help them bridge the achievement gaps that exist in California's public schools. Surely, this was one of Arnold's more compassionate budget cuts, when you put it next to the cuts he has in store for those with mental/physical impairments and the developmentally disabled, not to mention the elderly, the blind, the working poor ($77 million in cuts for their children's health care), food-stamp recipients, foster children, and doctors who serve low-income Californians.  Remember, being the first round of budget cuts, they were the  easy  ones for Arnold to find.  Apparently this is the "action, action, action" that Cise and the  Patriot  have been jizzing their collective pants for.

        PATRIOT  FANTASIZING ON THE ECONOMY   (Open your mag's to page 18, for David Zelster's "It's the economy, stupid!")  First of all, let's put this in perspective:  It was one good quarter, that's all.  Hailing it as the start of a huge turnaround could be analogous to Nazi Germany doing the same about the Battle of the Bulge.  Naturally, I'll return to this point, but let's dive in...  Looks like the fantasy starts at the very beginning (a very good place to start): The Bush-bashing bandwagon is going nowhere.  After his three successful years in office, liberal opponents are still attacking President Bush's character and policy. Yeah, we'd better stop that.  We wouldn't want his approval ratings to stop their  urlLink steady decline  or anything like that.  There's nothing liberals trust and cherish more than advice from conservatives.  Anyway, what follows amounts to pure fantasy on Bush's tax cuts, with a side order of attempts to justify the top-heavy nature of said tax cuts.  Zelster devotes an entire paragraph to a strange and strained idea that liberals are trying to muddy the definition of "rich" in order to "siphon the fruits of middle class labor".  Does he provide any examples of liberals actually  doing  this?  Er, no, but I can provide a pretty big example of  conservatives  doing this!  Remember the estate tax?  Oh wait, if you're conservative and reading this, then you call it the "death tax".  A repeal of the estate tax would exclusively benefit the very rich, but when Republicans changed their terminology and started calling it the death tax -- death is something that happens to everybody, regardless of their tax bracket -- they fooled many of the non-rich into believing they actually had something to gain from the elimination of the tax.  I assure you, the middle class doesn't give a flying fuck about the sob stories of the super-rich  nouveau mort  whose estates are taxed before they are passed down to heirs, who did nothing to earn those estates.  (In fact, Democrats, who stand up for the middle class, were the ones who were trying to raise the cutoff point where the estate tax kicks in, in the interest of protecting -- yep -- small businesses and family farms!)  Does Mr Zelster mention the estate tax in his piece?  Nope!  By the way, I seem to remember that in 2000, President-elect Gore proposed -- gasp! -- a middle class tax cut!  Elsewhere, Zelster drags out a meaningless number trumpeted by Bush, and does so in the usual  Patriot  fashion: When Bush declared as part of his ten-year economic stimulus package an average $1,600 per family tax cut, he was acknowledging the fact that dollars are allocated more efficiently by those who actually earn them. Ahh, nothing like the right's favorite after-lunch activity, going out to the park, popping the cork on some  French  Freedom wine, and confusing average with median.  To borrow an example from Professor  urlLink Krugman : When Bill Gates enters a bar, the average net worth of the patrons soars, but that doesn't make everyone in the bar a billionaire. Exaaaaactly.  And as long as I've brought Krugman into this mess -- I know the  Patriot  must appreciate that -- let's hear what he has to say on how the  urlLink middle class  does in Bush's tax policies: Here's why: while the central thrust of both the 2001 and the 2003 tax cuts was to cut taxes on the wealthy, the bills also included provisions that provided fairly large tax cuts to some � but only some � middle-income families. Chief among these were child tax credits and a "cutout" that reduced the tax rate on some income to 10 percent from 15 percent.  These middle-class tax cuts were designed to create a "sweet spot" that would allow the administration to point to "typical" families that received big tax cuts. If a middle-income family had two or more children 17 or younger, and an income just high enough to take full advantage of the provisions, it did get a significant tax cut. And such families played a big role in selling the overall package.  So if a Democratic candidate proposes a total rollback of the Bush tax cuts, he'll be offering an easy target: administration spokespeople will be able to provide reporters with carefully chosen examples of middle-income families who would lose $1,500 or $2,000 a year from tax-cut repeal. But enough of that, we don't want Mr Zelster's house of cards to tumble, so let's move on.  Zelster's comments are in line with other pieces in this month's  Patriot  by Mr. Abramyan and Mr. Gallais, because it tries to paint liberals and Democrats as anti-hard-work.  Let me try this one more time:  Liberals hate Bush, in part, because  he never worked an honest day in his life  before being selected president.  Zelster keeps quoting Howard Dean, but he'd also do well to bring in John Edwards, who argues that the effect of the Bush economic plan is to "shift the burden from wealth to work."  Later, David quotes Senator Jon Corzine: But there is still more.  "The verdict is in:  The Republicans' multi-trillion dollar failed economic policy is one the (sic) greatest disasters for working Americans in a decade," said Senator Jon Corzine . . . However, while unemployment is currently at 6.1 percent, the rate has declined slowly since June, productivity rose almost seven percent in the second quarter of 2003, and the total number of non-farm employment has grown since July. Record deficits (after record surpluses) and over three million jobs lost, that's disaster material regardless of one good quarter.  Remember the 2002 State of the Union address?  He summed up his economic program in one word: "jobs".  Much applause followed... yet no net jobs have been created since that point, as the Bush tax cuts continue in their refusal to  urlLink stimulate the job market .  Zelster finishes off his piece with the usual ode to Bush's "poised leadership", as well as his "clear concept of truth and honor".  Really, I'm touched.  Oh, wait!  His headline includes the phrase: "Growth shows value of the President's tax cuts".  Does he support that claim anywhere in his article?  Er, no, but we can congratulate Mr Zelster for writing this story at the magical intersection of the business cycle and Bush's economic rhetoric.  We'll check on those job numbers again in a couple months.  P.S.  One of the things Howard Dean often says on the stump that Zelster fails to mention is that Bush's tax relief to middle class families has often been more than cancelled out by increases in state and local taxes, elimination of student loan programs, etc, because Dubya won't help out the states.

       FUN WITH GOOGLE   (my thanks go to laurie, who noticed this)  First, go to Google.  Conduct a search for "california patriot".  If you look at the  urlLink search results , there they are, and look who's right behind them!  Maybe if I do this long enough I'll make it to "I'm feeling lucky".  Heh.

        PATRIOT  CITIZENRY   (Page 19, "What does it mean to be a citizen?", by Hovannes Abramyan)  Shorter:  I am copying and pasting a big slab of Iron Curtain rhetoric, substituting a couple of nouns, and adding in a xenophobia grand enough to make Pat Buchanan proud, all because a city wants the opinions of those living within it. To those on the far left, it seems that being American is to be associated with a corrupt system of unfair and indecent policies.  America, in their opinion, can never be credited for its corrupt positive attributes because it simply has none.  As a result of their distorted worldview, extremists continuously look for ways to undermine the meaning of citizenship. Such as blowing up government buildings and women's clinics, stockpiling vast quantities of weapons, declaring racial holy war, going on "lone wolf" shooting sprees that target minorities, and buying copies of  The Turner Diaries  at gunshows by the bucketful.  Yeah, those extremists on the right are always trying to undermine . . .   Wait, did you say the  left ?  That's interesting, because Abramyan's paragraph, to a word, seems to be a spot-on description of the extremist right in America, the only difference being that they don't take kindly to  documented  immigrants either.  The point is, extremists of any viewpoint tend to act, well, extreme, and to isolate one group is a useless and deceptive exercise.  Hovannes goes through all the qualities that make up an American citizen, happily glossing over those nasty inconvenient ones, like the right to dissent and such (that's  soooo  September 10th, huh).  And on the way, there's some fun to be had, like:  --He brings up the immigration of his parents from Armenia and Colombia, as a contrast (presumably) to illegal immigration into California from Mexico.  That's nice, but if either Armenia or Colombia had a common border with the United States, think that might affect his example just a wee bit?  At this point it's apples and oranges.  --"...Americans have an understanding of the system they live in and work for change only through this system... Those who were born in this country sometimes neglect this understanding, and, in doing so, operate under a false premise that being American requires hating American democracy."  This is the same sort of projecting, narrow nonsense as Amaury Gallais' comment that liberals hate hard work and happiness.  (Memo from an actual liberal:  We despise Bush, in part, because he  never worked an honest day in his life  before becoming president.)  Two points for Hovannes:  First, as many people on the Aryan right hate democracy as your socialist bogeypeople on the left, and they do so with an even greater passion.  Secondly, if this comment is aimed at a greater chunk of the population than the fringes, then Hovannes is probably making an ignorant error by confusing hatred of  corruption  in democracy with hatred of democracy itself.  And the final graf? Being American is not about residing within a set geographical boundary. Rather, being American involves a love of country, a love of principles, and a love of others that transcends petty differences. (differences like the often desperate circumstances of those arriving in the country?  anyway...) The greatness of American (sic) lies in the greatness of people, but that greatness can only be fully realized when certain privileges are reserved only for citizens. My soft criticism of this is:  Then how are we supposed to spread our message of democracy and hope with such mixed messages?  And my hard criticism is: There's something very  Dred Scott  about that line...  P.S. Keep in mind that some who violate the terms of their visas have interesting jobs in this state.  Like  urlLink Governor .

       NO THANKS   Open your  Patriots  to page 27, and take a look at Amaury "2002 Presidential Election" Gallais' list of things for which he is thankful, "Cornicopia of America." ...I am thankful for this nation, under God. That's nice, enjoy that until it's deemed unconstitutional, as it should be. I am thankful for America being the country that has fought the longest and hardest for civil rights despite its long history of slavery. Yes, we fought long and hard, but thank Jeebus, we have completely snuffed out racism in America.  We don't even have to think about it, because gee golly, there aren't any lingering, inherent strains of racism in any aspect of American life anywhere, it never affects the judgement of a single American employer in the hiring process, and minorities can drive automobiles completely free from police harassment.  From sea to shining sea. I am thankful for America, the land of the free, which if you don't like, you are free to leave. The funny thing is, this is a rhetorical tactic used only by campus conservatives, I've never heard the rightiest righty on television, radio or in adult print say this.  But why does the  Patriot  use it?  Funny thing is, for those who remember autumn 2002, they're basically saying this:  "Liberal thinkers are encouraged to seek other countries."  Ah, how bout the  Patriot :  They hate Berkeley liberals, but they  love  their course descriptions!  (For those of you who need a refresher, the  Patriot  and others threw a hissyfit about an English 1A class on Palestinian resistance culture, taught by Snehal Shingavi, who included in his course description a line encouraging conservatives, who might want to turn the class into an Israeli-Palestinian debate, to "seek other sections".   urlLink See here for more , scroll down to "Patriot lies & misrepresentations on Shingavi".)  Let's see what else Gallais gives us: I am thankful to those who voted to drive out the Democrats. and (sic) for the Republican who will clean up this mess. I assume he's referring to the recall.  The voters drove out  Gray Davis .  Tell me, Amaury, what is the common thread between every other elected statewide official in California?  I'll give you a hint:  You refer to them as "wrong".  And how did those two Republican-backed ballot measures do in October?  They were, well, driven out!  Furthermore, if calling for a bond measure so that we'll have the same budgetary problems a year from now (aside from that, $2 billion in budget cuts that are more than cancelled out by the $4 billion cost of ending the VLF) constitutes "cleaning up this mess", then yes, that's what Arnold's doing. I am thankful for the Pro-War movement that did not spend countless hours and milions of dollars in putting together marches and rallies but in the end were victorious. Yeah, the Pro-War movement had to settle for using Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, talk radio, the editorial pages of the  Wall St Journal , the  Washington Times  and  Post , the  New York Post , and to a vastly lesser extent, the  Patriot .  Not to mention the White House, occupied by those who won neither the popular nor the electoral vote. I am thankful for the daily average of 1,000 hits on calpatriot.org. Of course, those thousand daily visitors won't have the opportunity to see this month's issue.  But I'm sure those visitors still want to know about Cruz Bustamante's racist ties!  By the way, until further notice, I'm going to assume that this month's issue hasn't been posted only because of what I'm doing.  If they can claim that Berdahl left because of anything they did, then I can claim that they aren't posting their issue online because of me.  I'm sure  Patriot  webmaster  Hovannes Abramyan  Pat Rodriguez or one of their other staffers can clear this up, and reassure me that they're just really lazy.  Moving on... I am thankful for all those who work hard and are happy: that irritates liberals! Huh?  I simply do not understand what Amaury is thinking with this one.  The only things this line reveals are some psychological issues on his part (and by extension, the  Patriot 's), or maybe a severe lack of understading of the liberal mind.  Being a liberal who is not only hardworking, but darn happy, I cannot vouch for Amaury's claim.  Wow, it took him a while to get to the "MEchA sucks!" paragraph.  Let's move on: I am thankful for my 16 gauge shotgun, which has killed less people than Bill Janklow's (R-SD) car. Well said, Amaury.  But ooh, Dr Freud says your slip is showing: I am thankful for a country that does not consider an obstacle  unconquerable  (emphasis mine) Hail Caesar! On 9/11/01, this country was shaken to its core.  Instead of lying down, the American people showed an incredible ability to remember who died that day while still continuing to move forward. You may remember that the  Patriot  itself had a hard time remembering who died, resorting to childishness about  urlLink flags and patriotic symbols .  (scroll down to "no patriot in whoville?")  It is a great thing to be thankful and appreciative of what you have and the world in which you live.  However, Amaury Gallais has hijacked the positive spirit of Thanksgiving and used it to bitter, partisan political ends.    All stuffing and no turkey.

       ONE EXTRA BIT ON DAVID LIMBAUGH   Go read my piece on Mr Lutske's review of Limbaugh's  Persecution , just below this one.  To get a better idea of the intellectual integrity of David Limbaugh, consider this very recent  urlLink example   (via tbogg).  David Limbaugh on  urlLink judicial nominations : Democrats took the gloves off beginning with Judge Robert Bork's nomination, and they've kept them off. Now one of them (Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts ) is even calling minority-group nominees "Neanderthals." Limbaugh's implication is pretty clear here.  Now hold on to that implication, and compare it to what Ted Kennedy  urlLink actually said : "What has not ended is the resolution and the determination of the members of the United States Senate to continue to resist any Neanderthal that is nominated by this president of the United States for any court, federal court in the United States." I report, you decide.

        PATRIOT  BOOK  PARROTING  REVIEW   Okay, everybody, we're a bit hampered by the  Patriot  staff not sticking the November issue online, so as we did last may, let's play the home game.  I won't be reprinting entire articles here, so go get your copy, or get your significant other to pick up a copy for you.  Open your  Patriot  to page 24, and let's take a look at Ethan Lutske's review of David "Fredo" Limbaugh's new book  Persecution, How Liberals Are Waging War against Christianity .  As you may have guessed, the publishing house was Regenry (the resident publishers of Coors/Scaife-founded Heritage Foundation).  And as you probably also guess, yes,  urlLink bulk-orders  have been reported.  Anyway, Lutske spends most of his "review" simply parroting various parts of Limbaugh's argument, not offering any actual opinions on the book until the final paragraph.  Problem is, a lot of this stuff has more holes than Christ's wrists.  (btw I hope that line was commie-idiot enough for "Joan", who I can only assume checks back here frequently for stuff like that.  Sorry, but I won't go to the prom with you.)  Apparently, Christianity is under attack here!  Its status as the west's predominant religion since, oh I dunno, the early 4th Century is teetering on the brink!  Sayeth Lutske: Too often today, Christianity is considered to be an affront to society and is banished from public and political debate.  Any type of religious expression, even in its most tangential form, is expunged from public lands, buildings, and schools. Obviously, the  Patriot  costs money to make, so I'm sure their staff has had a chance or two to look at their nation's currency, and look at the various phrases on it, I'm sure at least one of those might be relevant.  Also, given the  Patriot 's standing up for the idea of being a " urlLink law-abiding citizen ", then surely they know all about the judicial process, and what a witness does immediately before testifying.    Then, Lutske pines for the good old days: The first institutions that could be considered public schools were in fact created for the explicit purpose of teaching the Bible and other Christian-oriented texts.  Today, though, the story is quite different. So, uh, is that what you want?  For all the vitriol from right-wing Christians about fundamentalist Islam, they don't seem to have a problem with the concept of  madrassas , do they.  In the meantime, I'm pretty darn happy that my public education told me that the universe is billions of years old, as it actually is, and not six thousand.  But oh, that public school bogeyman: Children are often prohibited from carrying a Bible in school, or even mention the word "Jesus," should they offend those of other faiths. I attended a public high school in the most liberal part of the country (right here in the bay area), and we spent an entire unit of sophomore English reading large chunks of both the Old and New Testament--"Jesus" was uttered many a time--and not only that, there wasn't a hint of anti-religious bias in how the class was taught.  Not only that, but said high school has a Christian club, titled "Christians with a Vision" (C-WAV), that has weekly lunchtime meetings and teacher sponsorship.  It was only when a group of students started a Satanic thought club in 2002 that anybody raised a fuss, and it was Christians who were complaining.  (go  urlLink here  and  urlLink here )  Lutske discusses the tussle over a tile with a religious statement on it ("God is love") that was removed from a Columbine memorial at the school: Deemed offensive, the tile was removed as a violation of the First Amendment and  the mythical statute of the "separation of church and state ." The staff of the  Patriot  has, on numerous occasions before, stated a reverence for the Founding Fathers.  Thomas Jefferson fits that definition, I'm sure, and he seemed to believe in that "mythical statute" of separation between  urlLink church and state : Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man & his god, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state. But don't worry, Ethan, there's plenty of countries where such a separation actually  is  a myth, including at least one to which Reagan sold arms.  Moving on . . . Lutske spends a large paragraph going after the director of the Alabama chapter of American Atheists, as if this is supposed to help his, or Limbaugh's case.  This is just the usual rhetorical nonsense that conservatives spew, representing a fringe group as a prime example of the nature of their opposition. (A.N.S.W.E.R. sucks so the anti-war movement is illegitimate and wrong!  Snehal sucks so it follows that all Berkeley liberals do as well!  I quoted a Klansman talking about Bustamante, that means he's a racist!)  You don't hear liberals equating Tim McVeigh with mainstream conservatives, do you?  Well no, but you do hear endorsements of his actions by  urlLink Ann Coulter .  Even beyond that, the critique here is that a fringe group, atheists, are attacking an act by a Christian (Alabama Governor Bob Riley) that is, on Lutske's/Limbaugh's scale, rather benign.  I would counter that while President Clinton was a relatively moderate Democrat, the reactionaries on the far right (including David Limbaugh's pill-poppin' hypocrite brother) took every accomplishment as, in Lutske's words, "an affront to society".  Lutske moans about how religious symbols have been kept off public land, in the interest of the above non-mythical statute: Often, simply holding a show of faith on public land is enough to incite ridicule and outrage.  Two separate towns that tried to put up privately funded signs proclaiming the town's belief in Jesus were brought to court and forced to take the signs down. Well, that's the peril you run into if you try to slap a Christian label on non-Christians.  But there's a bigger problem here.  Lutske appears to be taking a bold stance here.  Does this mean that Lutske would favor the erecting of an anti-gay monument in Casper, WY by the uber-homophobe  urlLink Reverend Fred "God hates fags" Phelps ?  What was Phelps' argument?  The public park in Casper in which he wanted to put his monument commemorating Matthew Shepard's supposed arrival in hell also contained a Ten Commandments monument donated by a local organization.  To deny Phelps' religious monument, he argued, would mean the government favored one religious view over another, violating the First Amendment.  Thankfully, the town of Casper has offered to remove the Ten Commandments monument if Phelps takes them to court.  See, this is the problem for Limbaugh, Lutske, et al.  If you accept one religion, you have to accept them all.  Too many Limbaugh-Christians have this idea of manipulating the removal of church-state separation so as to render America a Christian republic.  Tom McClintock's campaign manager John Stoos, an avowed Christian reconstructionist, certainly fits this description.   urlLink But we've been through this .  Wow, it took him a while to get to the "Liberals love Islam!" paragraph.  Let's skip to the final graf: In the name of freedom of religion, groups like the ACLU and other liberal legal forces have completely mutilated the First Amendment, twisting its words into a doctrine that more resembles freedom from religion. Well, first you can go ask ACLU employee Bob Barr about that.  Secondly, from this article (and presumably Limbaugh's book), somebody isn't too clear on the concepts of "public" and "private".  I'd say a whole lot more here, but I think it could be summed up with the words of the  Patriot  itself, those being that if you don't like it, "you are free to leave."  (Thanks, Amaury "2002 Presidential election" Gallais!)  Lastly, Lutske leaves us with some fightin' words! Christianity is on the defensive in America, and  if it does not fight back , it will lose.  (emphasis mine) Uh, Ethan?  That's a jihad.  And I don't think you can declare a holy war on your own inferiority complex.

       THAT STORIED CAL-LOUISVILLE RIVALRY   (pick up your copy and look at the cover page)  I'm sure  Patriot  cover artist Taylor Overbey knows that the Stanford "Cardinal" refers to the shade of red, and  not  any particular species of bird, right?  More to come...  UPDATE: A source close to the  Patriot  explained to me that yes, they are aware that "cardinal" does not refer to the bird, yet included the dispatched animal merely for the purpose of making a thought connection.  In a related story, Albert Pujols, Emmitt Smith and Rick Pitino have cancelled the orders given to their hired goons, who were en route to  Patriot  HQ before such clarifications were made.  That's good, it could have been ugly.

        PATRIOT  HYPOCRISY . . . AGAIN   ( Submitted by reader JonP ) I know that Berkeley College Republicans can be hypocritical sometimes, but this time they're practically turning hypocrisy into an art form.  On page 6 of the new issue of the  Patriot , the magazine noted, "ASUC Kris-Cuaresma Primm was arrested last month on suspicion of public intoxication and possession of an open container."  When ASUC Senators said they "did not believe the incident to be indicative of Primm's ability to govern and represent the student body," the  Patriot  sarcastically replied, "Yeah, that law-abiding citizen thing is sooo overrated."  Of course, when you turn over the  Patriot , they have an ad on the back cover calling for revoking the ASUC boycott of Coors Beer that features several  Patriot  staffers holding... you guessed it...open containers of alcohol.  Hmmm...would the  Patriot  have been complaining of political persecution if Primm had been drinking Coors? No links to articles or cover illustrations, because our buddies at the  Patriot  have follwed their usual reverse-Darwinist track:   Issue 1: articles linked from main page in HTML format Issue 2: articles linked from main page in pdf format. Issue 3: screw it   The interesting thing is, this time they skipped a step, between 2 and 3 ( entire issue linked from main page as one large pdf file ).  For context, here are DailyCal stories on both  urlLink Primm  and the  urlLink Coors boycott .  Given that the recently-late Joseph Coors was closely afiliated with Richard Mellon Scaife*, who funds organizations that have given money to the  Patriot  ( urlLink see here , scroll down to "Follow the Money", 9/5/02), maybe that hits a little close to home.  (* - For example, Coors and Scaife were two of the founders of the  urlLink Heritage Foundation , a well-known conservative think tank)

      CPW reader jonp appears to be more  urlLink masochistic  than I am, going after former  Patriot  writer Rory Miller on veterans day, chickenhawks, and so on.  You go.  The Clam and his apparent allies try to fault jon for inconsistency in his arguments.  Here's a oldie but goodie that I'm happy to offer:  Angry Clam,  urlLink 10/25/02 , on Paul Wellstone's death: No, I'm not going to sit here and gloat. That, along with wishing death to your political enemies, is fucked up. Angry Clam,  urlLink 1/18/03 , on anti-war protesters: Today is the day when lefties will run amok downtown, and then get pissed off that a president whom they didn't vote for, and will not vote for in 2004, doesn't listen to them.  I had good dreams last night, by the way- dreams of riot police, tear gas, firehoses, police dogs, and rubber and/or real bullets. A less-than-3-month turnaround on killing political enemies!  How, um, encouraging.

      I dunno, after a 2nd episode of plagiarism in a year, critiquing the rest of the rag doesn't seem all that important, does it?  No matter...   THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A STUPID QUESTION, ONLY STUPID  PATRIOT  WRITERS    Patriot  writer Julia Baumgaertner  urlLink answers eight questions  that various Berkeley bogeypeople have about the right.  What's amazing is that all eight questions -- all eight! -- are shameless strawmen.  I knew this wasn't worth it.  The questions (look at the  urlLink piece  for reference):  1. The "Berkeley Communist" question.  One question, one strawman. Berkeley Communist: Don't Bush's tax cuts only benefit the rich? First of all, tell me who is arguing that.  I'd love to know who is saying that the only people who benefit from Bush's tax cuts are the rich.  I sure know a whole lot of people who argue that  most  of the benefits go to the rich, but what do I know, I'm not in the business of making strawmen.  Need I remind the  Patriot  of what the  urlLink critique  of who benefits from the Bush tax cuts is, as made by an actual liberal who, unlike the aforementioned "Berkeley Communist", doesn't exist entirely in Baumgaertner's imagination.  Julia's suggested response digs the hole even deeper: You: Horrors! Was Econ 1 really that boring? The economy would not function without investment, and for investment to happen there needs to be extra capital floating around in any budget.  But perhaps you also haven't kept up with the news recently. The economy grew by 7.2 percent in the third quarter of this year, the best growth rate in nearly 20 years. Coupled with low interest rates, the President's tax cuts have stimulated the economy to grow and  add jobs, which benefits every American . Next time, at least read the paper with the time you saved from not going to econ class. (italics mine) And how exactly does losing 3 million jobs in 3 years benefit every American, much less adding a paltry few recently, despite the high GDP growth?  Then again, if you want to talk about state and local taxes, college tuition, Pell Grants, etc, you can see why the  urlLink middle class  doesn't do all that well under the Bush package.  2. Julia's response the "BAMN Activist" question makes the mistake of bringing up the fascinating subject of Republican interpretations of the 14th Amendment.  3. Let me shorten Julia's answer for the "Homeless Guy" question, for the benefit of the  Patriot 's incompetent editors: "Social Darwinism".  There, now the monthly rag has that much more room to lift quotes from not only the East Bay Express, but also the Berk Daily Planet, the SF Bay Guardian and even the San Mateo Daily Journal, if need be.  4. I highly encourage Julia to bring up the topic with a UC professor that exists beyond her own imagination.  But beyond that, Dick Cheney and subsidiaries of  urlLink the company he headed ...  5. Okay, let's sort through Julia's entertaining response to a "Cal Democrat" asking whether Bush lied to get us into war: You: The Iraqi dictator's refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors and his known tradition of atrocious human rights violations forced the President's hand. Yeah Saddam forced his hand, some  fifteen years  after the gassing of Halabja (with weapons we gave to him, of course).  And of course, the gross human rights violations in, say, China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan (home of Islam "Boiler Room" Karimov) and our new friend Libya, they all failed to force the President's hand.  Oh, and given our inability to find even a single weapon of mass destruction (not to mention the impending resignation of David Kay), as well as the insistence of UN weapons inspectors that the process needed time to work, why in the world could Bush not have waited a matter of weeks for this war?  Anyway, what else do we find in Julia's reply? It has been shown that Saddam was actively seeking long range missiles and had â€œdual-use facilitiesâ€� that he could convert back into weapons labs after inspectors left. Passive voice alert!  Nice work there, ma'am. The world is a safer place now that Saddam has been deposed; the United States will follow through on its commitment to build a lasting democracy in Iraq . I dunno, Tom Ridge doesn't seem to agree with this "safer" sentiment of Julia's, having just raised the terror alert  urlLink to orange .  6. It is now time to give Julia Baumgaertner a harsh lesson in verb tense.  Let's look at the question from her "Environmental Activist", as well as the relevant portion of her reply: Environmental Activist: Why  are  Republicans out to destroy and exploit the environment?  You: ...such cynically packaged questions should be researched more carefully. Many landmark pieces of environmental legislation, like the creation of the EPA, were written, passed, or signed into law by Republicans. (emphasis mine) The EPA was created, oh I dunno,  three decades ago ?  The "Activist" was asking about what Republicans are currently doing to the environment, and you respond by bringing up the relatively distant past?  Jeez, Julia, stop evading your own question!  This strategy is similar to what the  Patriot  tried to do during its anti-affirmative action hissyfit last winter:  Paint the Democrats as racist by pointing to things they did many decades ago.  7. Of course, that SUV would still be fully tax-deductible to corporations that buy it, and its mileage would still be meager compared to other vehicles.  8. Schwarzenegger was elected because his name is Schwarzenegger and he acts in movies.  If Arnold had a "D" next to his name, it is highly likely that the  Patriot  would make that very argument.  Of course, aside from cutting portions of education and health care from the state budget, as well as  adding  to the deficit by repealing the vehicle fees, Arnold has barely done a thing that Gray Davis wouldn't have.  Borrowing from the future?  How charming.  How Bush, you know, with the whole "passing along our problems" and all.  But anyway, the  Patriot  is a chronic plagiarizer with lousy editors who don't know enough to tell their writers not to do that kind of thing, so this was a waste of time.

        PATRIOT  PLAGIARISM? AGAIN!?   Mister Cranky, meet the East Bay Express.   urlLink Kevin Deenihan  of Cal Stuff has the scoop, from an article in the  urlLink EAST BAY EXPRESS .  I shall now excerpt some of WILL HARPER's article, noting rather explicitly and honestly that the following words are written by WILL HARPER of the EAST BAY EXPRESS: ...the current issue of the California Patriot, a right-wing campus magazine produced by UC Berkeley students, contains a story on wacky Berkeley landmarks suspiciously similar to an Express cover story written by yours truly a few months ago on wacky Berkeley landmarks.   It's not so blatant as the Riders rip-off -- more of a lazy rewrite than a cut-and-paste job -- but some passages and quotes from the Patriot article are identical to those that appeared in the original. Hell, the writer even lifted inaccuracies the Express later corrected in print. Two people quoted in the Patriot version -- who seemed, oddly enough, to have used precisely the same words as when they spoke with the Express months earlier -- told Bottom Feeder they have never talked to the Patriot writer, Vanessa Wiseman, or anyone from the student magazine. For just a minute there, Feeder thought Wiseman had at least managed to do one original interview -- with Berkeley Planning Commissioner John Curl -- until another Expresso recognized his quotes as coming from a letter we ran complaining about the original story.   But there's a silver lining here: This whole episode helps us better understand the pillars of the Patriot's mission statement, which are to Expose, Educate, and Express. We hope that our  exposure  of this intellectual theft from the  Express  has served to help  educate  future members of our sordid vocation.  (italics WILL HARPER's) The  Patriot  has run a  urlLink correction .  Kevin thinks it's pretty lame, and that she simply stole the stuff and "wrote a hack article" (Though technically, with a wide enough net, you could call it an "editing error".  How Clintonesque of them!).  I'm inclined to agree, but just so you can make up your own mind, here's their correction, written by them, THE CALIFORNIA PATRIOT: CORRECTION: Because of an editing error, the article "Landmark Decisions that Shape Berkeley's Future" failed to attribute several quotations to the Eastbay Express, from which they were taken. The quotations of Mary Hanna,Mary Ann Beach Harrell, John Curl, and Leslie Emington were published by the Eastbay Express. The California Patriot regrets the error. A corrected version of the story appears below. Okay, have a wonderful night everybody, and good luck on whatever finals you have left.

       CONGRATULATIONS,  PATRIOT !   You have been chosen as #13 in Pandagon's 2nd annual  urlLink Twenty Most Annoying Conservatives  list.  Well, you and campus conservatives in general.  Jesse's analysis is pretty damn accurate: I think the saddest part about the rise of campus conservatism is that it shows you can master mediagenic conservatism by the time you're 18, with no real loss in shrillness or intellectual rigor. The half-life of angry, reactionary politics with no real point is apparently limitless.  This has been the year of the campus conservative...in much the same way it's been the year of the Milwaukee Brewer. Whiny, loud, and shameless, they've managed to start pushes at several colleges per year to complain their way into prominence.  There are 10 rules to being a campus conservative:  1.) Complain how you're shut out of every forum on campus by going to every forum on campus and using it to complain, prominently.  2.) Complain about how your professors are liberal, even though they grade your work fairly and accurately.   3.) Complain about the use of academic "buzzwords" in course descriptions without having actually taken the course.  4.) Complain about how much everyone else is complaining about your complaining.  5.) Complain about how nobody debates any ideas while strictly limiting your debate to telling everyone else that their ideas are horrible and shut out the ideas you can't actually elucidate.  6.) Complain about how the cable system doesn't carry Fox News, and complain when you get it but someone else signed up to watch Monday Night Football.  7.) Complain about campus oppression, and then inaccurately throw activist buzzwords at every liberal you can find.  8.) Complain about how you can't get spaces or funds to bring conservative speakers to campus to complain about the lack of conservative ideas on campus, ignoring that the space you wanted was taken months in advance by other groups.  9.) Take Econ 101. Complain about everything in barely informed economic terms.   10.) Complain about every stupid thing done on campus in terms of liberalism, no matter how apolitical it is. Bonus points if you can blame oversleeping for your 8:30 class on Paul Krugman.  See how easy it is? And it takes advantage of the natural talent that every collegian has, regardless of race, creed, income level or background: bitching about shit. Something tells me that 3, 5, 7 and 9 hit a little close to home, as do some of the others.

       A DEBATE CHALLENGE FROM JON TO "JUAN"   Reader/contributor JonP writes to challenge the  urlLink blogger / urlLink  Patriot -writer /pseudonym-wrapped-in-a-pseudonym known sometimes as "petty bourgeois" and other times as "Juan Carl Leal Solis" to a debate: Dear petty bourgeois,  I challenge you to a public debate between the two of us on the topic, Resolved: Immigration to the United States should be sharply reduced. You can take the affirmative, while I take the negative. The debate has to be in a public forum, not an Internet debate. If you feel you must maintain your anonymity, you may feel free to wear a mask to the debate. If you do not accept this challenge within two days, I will have to brand you a coward. Are you up to the challenge? Or are you yet another right-wing blowhard who can dish it out, but you can't take it?  Sincerely,  Jon C. Pennington (aka "jonp") I actually bought a halfway-decent mask in October, for a Halloween costume I ended up scrapping, so I can donate if need be.  As for the prospects of an agreement to debate coming about, I'll take the skeptical stance of "you'd have better odds getting Juan  Valdez  to agree to debate."  Though in that instance, at least there'd be refreshments.  But don't worry, I'll keep "pleasantly surprised" in the proverbial on-deck circle.  On a side, side, side note, labelling Hitler a "socialist" is, well, a meaningless exercise.  All of Europe circa WWI was using nationalism as a tool for political mobilization (you could even expand to say post-9/11 America does as well), so if that's the definition of "socialism" we are to accept, then boy are our faces red.

       SOME KERRYFICATION, AND MORE PATRIOT QUOTE ISSUES   Since I dealt with this over on  urlLink my sister blog  earlier today, regarding a piece from the  urlLink National Review , I think a cut and paste Nit Picklering job is in order...  When Hovannes Abramyan  urlLink brings up  the fact that he  urlLink once noticed  that John Kerry had, in 1997, spoke of Iraq's WMD threat and advocated military action, possibly unilaterally even, he fails to mention that at the time, Iraq was not cooperating with UNSCOM inspectors, while in the run-up to Bush's war, Iraq produced a declaration of weapons that has been shown to be  urlLink largely accurate , and weapons inspectors were receiving dramatically higher levels of cooperation from Iraqi officials.  Okay, that was fun.  But as I read Hovannes' excerpt from his old  Patriot  piece, something caught my attention.  Here's the paragraph relevant to my Nedra Pickler-style rebuttal: In 1997 Kerry stated that it was his judgment that the Security Council should authorize a strong United Nations’ military response that would materially damage—if not totally destroy—as much as possible of the suspected infrastructure for developing and manufacturing weapons of mass destruction, as well as key military command and control nodes. Hovannes does a good and thorough job in the September story of summing up John Kerry's arguments at the time.  But just for fun, let's look at how the National Review handles the same stuff in this week's issue: Kerry argued for Saddam to pay a grave price: "In my judgment, the Security Council should authorize a strong U.N. military response that will materially damage, if not totally destroy, as much as possible of the suspected infrastructure for developing and manufacturing weapons of mass destruction, as well as key military command and control nodes..." Ohhhhh, silly me, that was a  direct quote !  Verbatim!  Oh well.  This by itself isn't a big deal, of course, but it is symptomatic of a general laziness and clumsiness inherent in the  Patriot , particularly when it comes to quotes.

       PAGING MS WISEMAN   Get off your plagiarizing ass, and put together another  urlLink 2-page spread . SACRAMENTO, California (AP) -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger broke a state law during the closing weeks of the recall race when he took out $4.5 million in bank loans to help his cash-starved campaign, according to a preliminary ruling from a superior court judge.   If Monday's decision is upheld, the governor could be forced to pay back the loans out of personal funds.   "The judge has agreed with us in a strongly worded position that these loans were illegal," said attorney Lowell Finley, who filed a lawsuit in October attempting to stop Schwarzenegger from funding his campaign with bank loans that could be paid back by donors after the election.   Finley said the ruling from Judge Loren McMaster could spark sanctions from the California Fair Political Practices Commission -- an agency that recently threatened Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante with a $9 million fine because of campaign infractions.   At issue is a borrowing limit included in Proposition 34 that restricts candidates from accepting loans of more than $100,000 for their campaigns. The restrictions are intended to prevent a candidate who wins election from using his or her position to solicit special-interest money to repay the loans. Let's see some attention here, you wouldn't want to come off as a bunch of clumsy hacks now, would you?  A new issue (and word has it, new editor) awaits us just around the corner.  CPW predicts the SOS.

      From the  urlLink New York Times : The winner of the Iowa caucuses on Monday night will have an unexpected competitor waiting right around the corner, and he is not one of the Democrats running for president.  The opponent is President Bush and his State of the Union address, which White House officials scheduled for Tuesday night, only 24 hours after Iowa, to draw attention from the Democratic victor, a Republican close to the Bush campaign said.  "Was it planned?" the Republican said. "Yes. The fact that the Iowa caucus was going to be held on a certain date was not unknown to people in the White House." Oh, but Clinton was completely driven by the polls and cheap political gain...

       IT ISN'T AS IT WAS   (two holiday tidbits)  Former  Patriot  writer Rory Miller might want to update his post on the Pope's alleged  urlLink endorsement  of  The Passion , based on  urlLink this . VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Although Pope John Paul II watched at least part of Mel Gibson's film, "The Passion of the Christ," he made no comment about the film, said a senior Vatican official close to the pope.  "The Holy Father saw it, but he made no comment. He watched in silence," the official told Catholic News Service Dec. 24.  "The Holy Father does not comment, does not give judgments on art," the official said. "I repeat: There was no declaration, no judgment from the pope."  The official was replying to a request for clarification after numerous newspapers reported that the pope had watched the film and said, "It is as it was."  The purported quote was interpreted as papal praise for the movie. While you're waiting for that update (could be a while), you can also spend a comparable amount of time anticipating the  Patriot's  reaction to Dubya's  urlLink new immigration plan , which combines the one-two punch of 1) advocating a policy on undocumented immigrants that differs from immediate deportation, and 2) being a transparent electoral ploy.  In that spirit, a  Patriot   urlLink flashback  from Robb McFadden: While President Clinton seemed driven by polls and political survival, Bush has continually pushed big ideas, stayed true to his conservative ideology, and willingly confronted problems head-on. But now that he's moved on from Berkeley, the  Patriot  can disavow this opinion, right?

       AND NOW THE REBUTTAL   And you thought I would only go after  urlLink the "pro" piece .  True, I agree with a handful of the arguments made in the  urlLink "anti" piece , written by Melanie  "Colmes"  Smith.  But then again, there's this question: How did proponents of the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) come to the conclusion that we are in urgent need of a national definition of marriage? What do they hope to accomplish by defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman? Despite her critical stance on the FMA,  "Colmes"  Smith wouldn't dare think that by throwing the full force of its weight behind the amendment, the White House was even possibly pushing a wedge issue in an election year.  How could she think that, after that lovely Valentine the  Patriot  sent  urlLink last month  (of course, plenty of  Patriot  staff members are male, but we wont go there).  The White House support for the FMA was in the works long before anything Gavin Newsom did; consider the State of the Union address.  And unfortunately -- and here's where the  Colmes  in Smith comes out -- there is no mention of how the language of the FMA would put civil union and domestic partnership legislation at serious risk as well, something many yes-on-unions, no-on-marriages types might not know.  It's particularly maddening when  "Colmes" Smith says: The FMA is already unnecessary in most of the country, as 37 states have passed their own bans on same-sex marriage. But as I mentioned in the previous post, the wording of the FMA seeks to bring the hammer down on more than just marriage.  Over to you, Hannity.  All that being said, Smith's paragraphs on the "sanctity" of marriage and on the causes of broken homes are pretty well done, and credit should be given where credit is due.

       CARISSA EXPLAINS IT ALL . . . ER, SOME   Over the coming weeks/months, it'll be a blast listening to supporters of the Federal  Hate  Marriage Amendment justify their position without citing Leviticus or 1 Romans.  (I get the feeling we'll hear the word "traditional" used excessively in the near future)  Arguing in favor of the amendment is  Patriot  writer  urlLink Carissa Ritner .  She goes through a smattering of the talking points we've already heard on the subject, like this passage on Massachusetts: On February 3, 2004, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that banning same-sex marriages infringes upon the rights of homosexual couples; the ruling prompted subsequent outrage from opponents of same-sex marriage and left the entire nation in an uproar. Demonstrations in Boston on February 8 illustrated public displeasure with the court’s decision, a clear indication that the 4-3 ruling was more representative of the wishes of the court than those of Massachusetts residents.  The Massachusetts ruling demonstrates how this issue has spiraled out of the hands of ordinary citizens and into the agendas of activist state judges . (emphasis mine) And dear Dubya isn't being "activist" by taking this issue out of the hands of states and attempting to impose a strict federal standard.  What a remarkably Republican position, George.  Then there's the "streamlining" argument: Some states grant same-sex couples partial privileges of married couples, and some grant full privileges; a majority of states ban gay marriages altogether. The result is a messy, fragmented system. Through a Constitutional amendment, such a problem can be avoided. Oh yeah, a Constitutional amendment.  Great idea!  I think I have a name for it.  From now on, it shall be called the Fourteenth Amendment.  Spread the word.  But anyway, that's not where I'm going to put my focus in this post.  It's this:  The fundamental problem with Ritner's reasoning is that it is circular to the point of sheer hilarity.  And it manages to be hilariously circular in multiple ways.  In sorting out her "pro" arguments, she writes the following: A federal standard for marriage would also serve a protective role. First there is the matter of what makes a true family: the children. Through legal recognition of same-sex marriages, there are no longer any barriers protecting a child from being adopted into a gay or lesbian family, an environment too problematic for the upbringing of children. Really?  Do continue, ma'am: Children of homosexuals must endure emotionally crippling social stigmas, a situation which often proves detrimental and is always unfair. Damnit Carissa, you're letting me down, ma'am!  I'll say it very, very slowly:  Why does homosexuality evoke "emotionally crippling social stigmas"?  It is that way because there are people who seek to stigmatize it.  Part of the effort to stigmatize homosexuality is to work to deny the validity and legitimacy of same-sex couples as functional, positive units.  A good way to do that is to ban gay marriage.  It never occurs to Carissa that recognizing and accepting same-sex unions might, you know,  decrease the stigma  or anything like that.  Republican priorities:  Leave the stigma as is, there's nothing wrong with it, but same-sex couples have to go.  Women vote indirect.  Separate but equal.  And so on.  Carissa quotes a study! Child Trends, a child welfare organization, released a research brief in June 2002 stating, “Research clearly demonstrates that family structure matters for children, and the family structure that helps children the most is a family headed by two biological parents.” So are we getting rid of  hetero  adoption too?  Okay, let's move on.  Fasten your seatbelts, let's get stupid. Issues of health and healthcare also arise in the issue of same-sex marriages. Legal spouses are eligible to share health benefits, and this benefit would apply to homosexual couples were they allowed to marry. Unfortunately, this could result in major problems. Healthcare is expensive, and many diseases such as AIDS and other STD’s are more common among homosexuals. Through marriage, one would be eligible for health benefits through one’s partner, rather than seeking his own as an individual, though as a couple they would be more at risk than a heterosexual couple. This would transfer the costs from the couple as private individuals to the nation as a whole, for these benefits are paid for by tax dollars and employers. No.  Sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS included, are more common among  promiscuous  individuals, whether they be hetero, bi or gay.  Anyone who actually stood on the steps of SF City Hall a couple of weeks ago knows that the couples there didn't consist of promiscuous types out for some medical benefits, but rather people  urlLink like these .  The difference between straight and same-sex couples is that the straight couples have a legitimized legal framework into which they can enter, while gay couples don't.  Republicans find it quite convenient to deny gay couples recognition of their committment, while at the same time smearing them as being promiscuous.  Carissa and other Repubs have a chicken/egg problem here.  Okay, there's a paragraph that's oozing with Santorum, that was to be expected.  And from the final paragraph: Allowing a couple to reside together as “wife and wife,” or “man and man,” is not conducive to family life, nor is it practical. You know, if someone were, you know, born gay, and had to be wedged into a heterosexual relationship, that wouldn't be very "practical" for them now, would it? Add to this the threat of activist judges undermining the will of the people, Just like that activist Warren Court undermined the will of the people in  Loving v. Virginia ... the inefficient handling of the issue by the states, Because the federal government is much more efficient, right Republicans?  Reagan must be rolling in his, uh, grave. and the fact that most of the population opposes gay marriage, and the only pragmatic solution lies in a federal response. A line must be drawn somewhere, and the boundary has been found. Only Carissa and the  Patriot  wont tell you where the line is.  They make no mention of the implications of the  urlLink actual wording  of the amendment, and its effect not only on potential gay marriage legislation in the states, but also  civil union  and  domestic partnership  legislation.  Many in the media, including the supposedly-liberal LA Times, are having trouble  urlLink understanding  what "or the legal incidents thereof" could mean, and neglect to bother to discuss it.  Needless to say, the  Patriot  sure doesn't.

      "Dems go for the KO... on eachother!" screams the sub-headline of Reva's piece on the Democratic candidates.  Oh  urlLink ree-hee-heeally ? Democratic leaders, once fearful that their presidential nominee would inherit a demoralized and divided party, said Sunday that Democrats now seemed poised to nominate a candidate who had escaped damage from internal battling and enjoyed broad support from all factions of the party.  With Senator John Kerry's lopsided victories this weekend in Michigan, Washington and Maine, states that were once considered the heart of Howard Dean's support, many Democrats said Mr. Kerry could become one of the party's earliest nominees in memory. Some Democratic leaders had openly worried that if Dr. Dean lost the nomination, after being perceived as having it all but locked up, the eventual nominee would have to revive a broken party.  "There is unity within our party; they are not going after each other," said Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic national chairman, in an assessment that was echoed in the camps of Mr. Kerry's rivals. Mr. McAuliffe took care not to proclaim any winner in the race but said he expected the contest to be resolved within weeks, saying that would be "a great result."  Art Torres, the California Democratic Party chairman, said in an interview on Sunday that in a career dating to working for Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, he had never seen "a party more unified proceeding through the primary season." Mr. Torres said that development made him increasingly hopeful about his party's prospects in November.  "That's what Democrats are being smart about now: coalescing around a candidate that has electability, that has gravitas," said Mr. Torres, who has not endorsed a candidate. "The issue is to defeat George Bush and put America back on track." Sorry, but thanks for playing!

       BACK IN THE USSR   That's one  urlLink fuckin' dead horse  you're beating there, Hovannes!  Mr Abramyan really, really,  really  wants us to know that Saint Raygun was the man who singlehandedly brought about the fall of communist Russia. The Left attempts to diminish Reagan’s legacy by attributing the USSR’s reforms solely to Mikhail Gorbachev, as if due to some form of progressive thinking, he alone was able to abrogate totalitarianism. However, the evidence suggests otherwise. What follows is a clear, detailed yet concise analysis of the various actions taken by Ronald Reagan and his administration to bring about an en--  Oh, wait, what follows is nothing but vague fluff and a discussion of other communist regimes, though Hovannes makes one token reference to Reagan's "pressure".  He devotes a beefy paragraph to the horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the mid-late 1970's.  This is certainly a subject that deserves significant attention, as Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were especially terrible.  But hmm, how exactly did Cambodia become so politically destabilized that the 1975 revolution was even able to take place?  If you know the answer, then you know at least one of the reasons why there isn't a "Richard Nixon Circle" on the  Patriot's  donation cut-out on page 5.  Oh, but it gets better: The essential themes of this evil ideology continue to persist, defiant of their criminal record and repackaged with new, “honorable” intentions. Class warfare now goes by the name of income redistribution. Totalitarianism masquerades as social welfare—increasing the federal government’s ability to tax citizens and its oppressive role in everyday life. And the cultural revolution now likes to call itself the progressive movement—driving for the cultural betterment of society as it actually retreats from the values that have kept Western civilization strong. Social welfare as totalitarianism, eh?  Our government can debate, pass, and sign a rollback of Bush's tax cuts, and that would be "income redistribution"... done by wholly elected officials, accountable to their constituencies, and subject to elections in the near future?  And you should know, my "cultural revolutionary" compatriots in the "progressive movement" aren't out to destroy your institutions, but merely to give our own a voice, and to allow for the  choice .  Separation of church and state, for example, is not about the stamping-out of religion, it's about choice.  The marketplace of ideas!  Of course, there's no point in rationally engaging the material in the  Patriot  piece.  It's basically a package for their goal of lumping the American left in with the worst of totalitarian communist dictatorships from the past.  But to throw a bone to the  Patriot  masses, here you go:  While the legacy of Marx and Marxism in Russia and China became autocratic totalitarian regimes that slaughtered millions of their own people, the legacy of Marx and Marxism in continental Europe includes more humane work-days, the end of brutal child-labor, the creation of an extensive social safety net and universal health insurance in a great many European states.  Hitler and Nazism does not have this sort of parallel set of legacies, only one.  One last bit: It is time for true Liberals—those who value economic and individual liberties—to take notice. What eventually lead to the failures and horrors of communism should not be admired and repeated. "What eventually led..."?  As if totalitarian communism resulted from incrementalism.  I do, however, remember Marx arguing that immediately before communism can take hold, there should be a capitalist phase...  But it doesn't matter, this article wasn't really worth engaging anyway.

       GOTCHA!   The kids at the  Patriot  love a good game of  gotcha , as evidence by one of their "quotables" on page 7: "I don't think there is any longer a credible basis for doubting that the Earth's atmosphere is heating up because of global warming"  -- Al Gore in New York City, during the city's coldest day in decades and while wind chills have plunged some parts of New England to 100 degrees below zero! Well, guys, one good turn  urlLink deserves another : WASHINGTON - President Bush asked Congress to eliminate an $8.2 million research program on how to decontaminate buildings attacked by toxins — the same day a poison-laced letter shuttered Senate offices.  Critics said Thursday they were surprised by Bush's request, included in his 2005 budget proposal. Its release coincided with the discovery of the poison ricin in Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's office on Monday.  "It is a stunning example of the budget choices this administration has made, where tax cuts for elites are more important than public health or adequate homeland security," said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.   Daschle's office was the target of an anthrax-laced letter in October 2001 when he held Frist's job. Oh well.

       FUN WITH THE RANDOM QUOTE GENERATOR   Patriot  on the SOTU Address   When I clicked on the link to Angel Brewer's  urlLink State of the Union piece , the random quote was:  "Government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them."  -Ronald Reagan  Heh.  You know, if Reagan were still with us - he must be dead, cuz that's why conservatives wanted him on the dime - he might've had something to say about all those fancy and far-fetched spending proposals Brewer gushes about. After declaring that “drug use in high school has declined by eleven percent over the last two years,” he insisted that an additional $23 million would be needed to employ drug testing at school sites as an “aggressive, community-based strategy.” When he announced that in 2006, seniors would be able to obtain prescription drug benefits through the Medicare program, he also proposed that tax credits be granted so Americans could buy their own basic health care services.  Other suggestions for domestic strengthening were geared towards doubling federal funding for teenage abstinence programs, protecting marriage between a man and a woman, “opening billions of dollars in grant money” for accessibility to faith-based charities, and a four-year $300 million “prisoner re-entry initiative to expand job training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups.” Brewer refers to these programs as "honorable", thereby endorsing the solving of problems by government.  Two interesting bits about the  Patriot  recap of the speech.  First, a chunk of their recap concerns things that, well, didn't make it into the speech.  Brewer spends an entire paragraph on Bush's Mars program, which didn't make it into the speech, probably because it's  urlLink opposed by almost two thirds of Americans .  Second, while Brewer is ultimately critical of Bush's proposed increases in domestic spending - there are quotes from Stephen Moore and the Heritage Foundation - the piece tactfully omits the important bit of in-speech context that makes his new spending ideas outrageous from the eyes of fiscal conservatives.  From  urlLink the speech itself : In two weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important domestic needs, while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent. (Applause.) This will require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money. By doing so,  we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years.  (Applause.) (emphasis CPW's) Between all the new spending proposals, recent revelations that Bush's Medicare "reforms" will cost  urlLink a lot more  than previously thought, Bush's aim to make the 2001 tax cuts permanent (as well as future reforms of the alternative minimum tax), and inevitable future spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, this is pure fiction.  The Club for Growth knows this.  The Heritage Foundation knows this.  Grover Norquist, despite everything, knows this.   urlLink Even Andrew Sullivan  gets it (subscription req'd).  For Brewer to omit that from her analysis is very, very telling, because doing so paints Bush as "bold and compassionate", rather than "full of shit".  Lastly, a minor quibble from the final graf: While the annual speech this year did much to encourage and embolden the spirit of America in terms of foreign policy and security, it also created a sense of anxiety for conservatives with their eyes on his monetary policy. I do believe you mean fiscal policy.

       REVOKING THE  PATRIOT'S  POETIC LICENSE   Look out,  urlLink Robert Pinsky !  This is . . . so sad.  I'd post the whole thing here, but I want to save you the Windex costs for your vomit-stained monitor.  I will, my own health (and yours) notwithstanding, post relevant chunks, no pun intended. It's only been three years to date Yet your strategery's proven first rate. And you've established as an enduring fashion Your agenda of conservative compassion. Sure, roses are red, maybe violets are blue But these pleasantries are too wimpy for you:  For you seem more at home in a Stetson and a truck  You ooze determination; you make terrorists duck. Pop quiz for the  Patriot :  George W Bush has owned his Crawford ranch since A) 1982 B) 1977 C) 1980 D) 1999 Sir, history will long remember Your quiet strength of that September And your ensuing aim and charge Against the terrorists left at large. To the  urlLink LA Times ! President Bush spoke publicly for the first time Tuesday about his fears for himself and his family in the hours after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, telling a German television reporter he was "trying to get out of harm's way" before returning to the White House. But back to Leaves Of Ass: Economically, be still my heart: You cut taxes from the very start. (And I don't know anyone grieving Over marginal tax rates receding.) Of course you don't.  They wait on your tables.  They take out your garbage.  They teach in inner-city school districts.  They work so their children can be the first in their family to go to a state college.  Their property taxes, state taxes, and tuition costs all went up, more than cancelling out any positive effect of an income tax cut (and payroll taxes are taxes too).  So of course you don't know these people.  Then again, neither does Bush. You set education reforms that our future required, Leaving no child behind, setting my heart afire. Quick, think of a word that rhymes with "underfunded". Therefore, Mr. President, you won't find it surprising That your approval rates are  urlLink high  - and  urlLink rising . Oops! Issue by issue, you've accomplished your missions. So bring on the Democrats' scant competition! On Kerry! On Clark! On Dean! And opposers Like Lieberman, Sharpton, and other pushovers; For if you can pull dictators out of dirt holes, Surely you can trample these whiners in the polls. Why don't we  urlLink look at those polls , eh?   Gallup  : Kerry: 53% Bush: 46%  Edwards: 49% Bush: 48%    Quinnipiac  : Kerry: 51% Bush: 43%    Newsweek  : Kerry: 48% Bush: 46%    American Research Group  : Kerry: 47% Bush: 46% The only major polling organization in the past two weeks that has Bush leading Kerry is . . . Fox.  At least they got through the whole thing without the phrase " urlLink lump in the bed ".

       A-REVA-DERCI   I love when an  urlLink attack piece  about the Democratic candidates meant for the February issue of a publication was obviously written in mid-January.  Bravo!  On Kerry: Last October, he voted against granting $87 billion for postwar expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan, in effect giving the troops an unfunded mandate as he told them to rebuild Iraq with a bit of creativity and a lot of sand. I'll pose a question to the readers of the  Patriot  and this site, just in case anyone gets suckered in to Alavian's nonsense:  Did Kerry, and Edwards for that matter, vote against the $87 billion Iraq bill because they wanted to starve the Iraqi operation, or because they wanted to make bush  more accountable  in how he wants to allocate taxpayer money, rather than giving him a blank check?  Reva mocks Kucinich: Apparently, Grandfather Twilight, created by author Barbara Helen Berger, broke "20 years of silence" to publicly endorse Kucinich, because he so admires Kucinich's innovative ideas. Grandfather Twilight is not alone; woodland creatures have formally endorsed Kucinich as well, eagerly spreading the word. His website shows mice holding signs and some sort of forest dog passing the word along that Kucinich is the man with a plan. When the crazy run for President, they have to take what they can get. Think what you want, but  urlLink what about Bush ?  From the Observer, in a review of Stephen Mansfield's  The Faith of George W. Bush : Bush said to James Robinson: 'I feel like  God wants me to run for President . I can't explain it, but I sense my country is going to need me. Something is going to happen... I know it won't be easy on me or my family, but God wants me to do it.' (emphasis CPW's) If you think he was talking about 9/11, remember that he also gave interviews after the attack that he was trying to "get out of harm's way" on that day.  When Reva finally makes it to Clark, near the tail end of the article, we get this: Prior to 2003, Clark publicly voiced his support for US intervention in Iraq, with or without UN sanction, if need be. Could Reva be referring to, oh, I dunno,  urlLink THIS ?  A severely and misleadingly cherry-picked transcript of congressional testimony (in which Clark was arguing against  Richard Perle ) is what is behind Reva's insinuation.  I like the concluding graf... All in all, this is not a very impressive group. Democratic voters across the country are stuck with this sorry cast of characters, which will result in many breaking ranks and voting for Bush, or forgoing this election entirely and holding ritual sacrifices in hopes of appeasing the gods and doing better in 2008. The assortment of candidates does have an important message to both Democrats and Republicans, though: while we may not agree with everything Bush does, compared to the alternatives he is a prince among men, and he deserves our united support in order to keep the White House from turning into the Nut House in 2004. ...mostly because it gives me such a wonderful opening to link to the latest polls from  urlLink Gallup  and  urlLink Quinnipiac .  Lastly, I was modestly entertained by the sort of Dennis-Miller-with-smaller-vocabulary tone of this article.

       ANGEL BREWER GETS TIRED HALFWAY THROUGH FALSELY SMEARING THE CANDIDATES, TAKES A NAP, WAKES UP 15 MINUTES BEFORE THE DEADLINE, SAYS "FUCK IT", AND JUST SLAPS SOMETHING TOGETHER  Either Angel's really lazy, or really likes Edwards and Kerry.  You decide.   At least, that's what I'm guessing happened with  urlLink this piece , in which the records of both Wesley Clark and Howard Dean are blatantly distorted, but nothing nasty is said about John Edwards or John Kerry.  The paragraphs of the last two candidates may very well have come from their own bio pages.  Or at least the bio pages of a 6th grader trying to throw together a candidate advocacy website very quickly, but hey.  What's more, with six candidates remaining in the race, Brewer chooses only to profile four of them.  Quite the go-getter.  And to think the  Patriot  is passing up on an opportunity to throw mud at Al Sharpton.  Anyway, let's look at each one of these:  First, Retired General, and former Supreme Allied Commander (just like Eisenhower) Wesley Clark: Clark is most notably a retired four-star general of the United States Army, which he served for thirty-eight years. After graduating from Westpoint at the top of his class, he went on to study at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Other career highlights include his service in Vietnam, work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and an honorable appointment in 1997 as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. What may be interesting to note is the fact that Clark is a former Republican who -- whoooaa there!   Looks like new  Patriot  Editor in Chief John "some civilians were killed" Cise isn't doing his part to usher in a new era of journalistic integrity in the office.  Let's put it plain and simple:  urlLink Wesley Clark was never a Republican .  The linked story at FactCheck.org (easily found by googling "Clark never republican") has the details.  We'll be waiting for the correction, a chance for John, captain of the  Patriot , to show his quality.  Okay, back to Angel, mid-sentence, sorry for the interruption: told the Boston Globe in September that he “probably would have voted for the congressional resolution that authorized President Bush to wage war in Iraq.” In the first week of the first political campaign of his life, Clark slipped up a little.  It happens.  Bush nearly committed us to war with China in his first presidential campaign (though it was his fourth total campaign). Clark credits his changes in political sentiment to the presidency of Bill Clinton, whom he voted for in 1992 and 1996. The core of Clark’s campaign centers around his “Promise to America,” in which he states five goals to be achieved by 2008. These include raising the “typical family’s income” by $3,000, enacting environmental protection policies, increasing the number of students enrolling in higher education by one million, “lifting” two million children out of poverty, and granting health insurance to some thirty million people. In 2003 when Clark was considering a candidacy, he said to a friend, “My heart’s greatest gladness has always been answering the call and defending the country.” Among his prominent supporters are former Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth and liberal media mogul Michael Moore. Madonna!  You forgot about Madonna!  How can you guys be a respected conservative magazine if you left out the Madonna endorsement!?  Oh, and there's also  urlLink all these guys , but I forgive you.  And no mention of the successful campaign in Kosovo, a multilateral operation where not a single coalition life was lost, all while having the liberated population actually greet us  as liberators ?  Why wouldn't the  Patriot  mention that?  And now, Dr. Howard Dean, former six-term Governor of Vermont: Howard Dean is the former Governor of Vermont, and has also practiced medicine for over twenty years with his wife, Judy. He is a Yale alum and studied medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. During his tenure as Governor, he has focused on job expansion and creating accessible health care for children eighteen and under with his program Dr. Dynasaur. Dean has set himself apart in the primaries as the candidate most vehemently opposed to the war in Iraq, calling it “pre-emptive” and “misleading” for the American people. Another key element of the Dean campaign is his commitment to bringing universal health care coverage to America, a plan he intends to cost some $88.3 billion. Dean is also pro-choice, pro-affirmative action, and pro-same sex marriage. Well, he passed a  civil union  bill through the Vermont legislature, but the  Patriot  likes things in black and white.  Now, witness some hilarious circular reasoning from Brewer: After a disappointing third place finish in the Iowa caucus (eighteen percent), Dean screamed in passionate anger during his concession speech. Although he has publicly apologized for the action, which he says was made to “pump up” supporters, Dean is consistently pinpointed as an “angry candidate” by the media. In other words: We the  Patriot , who aspire to be part of "the media", call Howard Dean "angry", listen to Dean explain what he did, but then, again aspiring to be part of "the media", call him "angry" anyway.  And by the way, I don't ever remember Dean apologizing for the speech.  You got a source on that?  Because I can google "dean apologize scream" and come up with  urlLink this , from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: With just three full days of campaigning before the primary, Kerry led Dean 31 percent to 22 percent, a margin that was down 2 percentage points from his biggest lead. Dean's showing "may suggest that he has bottomed out and may in fact be starting to increase," said pollster John Zogby.  "I hope so," said Karen Creed, a bookseller from Londonderry, an independent, undecided voter who has been intrigued by Dean's campaign and dismayed by the late night television jokes about his "screech" in Iowa. "I'm glad he explained it, but  I'm glad he didn't apologize. There was nothing he should have apologized for ." (emphasis CPW's) It was at this point that Angel apparently dozed off and took a long, peaceful nap.  Brewer awoke to find fellow staffers screaming that the slanted candidate profile piece needed to be finished.  As a result, the only substantive thing Brewer has on John Edwards is that he strongly opposes President Bush.  Wow, quite a scoop there.  And no effort is even made to go after John Kerry, who happens to be, oh I dunno, the frontrunner.  But kudos to Angel for not dragging out Hovannes'  urlLink dishonest use  of Kerry's stance on Iraq in the 1990's.  The caption to the graphic that accompanies this article reads "Confused over which candidate is worse? We feel your pain."  Perhaps it should be amended to read "Too damn lazy to bother smearing all the candidates?  Angel Brewer feels your... your . . .  zzzZzZZzzzz... "

      Well  urlLink it's about bloody time .  Congratulations to John "some civilians were killed" Cise for his ascent to EIC.  May all cite their sources under his regime.  From the looks of it, critiquing the  January  February issue will be an effortless, yet time consuming exerCise.  We'll start in earnest this evening most likely.  But for now, two quick bits:  First, the  urlLink cover .  Guys, you just released your new issue.  Richard Gephardt has been  out of the race for  over two weeks!!!    And Governor Dean ain't exactly the frontrunner right now.  But nice try!  Second, they've tossed a Thomas Jefferson quote onto their homepage.   urlLink Here, guys .  Back later...  UPDATE: Apparently the quote at the bottom is randomly generated.  Still, I'm glad to see their enthusiasm about the 3rd president.  That is, until they advocate kicking him off the nickel in favor of St " Well... "

      Shorter Ethan Lutske, via  Fight Club :   urlLink History in the Making    ** On a long enough timeline, all wars are justified. ** One little bit deserves further mention.  One, while Lutske admirably mentions that rationales for the war have indeed changed and that the hawks should face reality, he unfortunately continues: We went into Iraq initially on the basis of WMD and a growing threat to our country; the thrust of our invasion was not the toppling of a dictator and the liberation of a people. Some people might want to obfuscate and deny this fact in order to save face; they should not, for there is no need. Wars have a natural fluidity to them. By the time Lincoln had given his Gettysburg Address and signed the Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil War had become a war about slavery. By the end of World War II, we knew why we fought. Wars change objectives. Of course, the Civil War and WWII were started by others who attacked us, so those aren't directly pertinent to the issue.  Note that Lutske makes no mention of 'Nam until the concluding paragraph, and it's only a passing reference.  What was one of the major problems with our war in Vietnam?  It was that our objectives were unclear!  They had, as Ethan puts it, a "natural fluidity" to them!

       THE MYTH OF HOVANNES ABRAMYAN   ( Submitted by JonP )  Abramyan's article,  urlLink the Myth of Class Warfare , states: But is a change in the system in favor of a larger welfare state needed? All signs show that the American system provides the opportunity for unbelievable economic mobility.  Consider a study by the University of Michigan Panel Survey on Income Dynamics. It found that only 5.1 percent of all Americans with incomes in the bottom 20 percent in 1975 remained there in 1991. Nearly 95 percent were able to move up the economic ladder. Twenty-nine percent actually moved up to the top fifth in the country. The first problem with this statement is that this claim was never made by any researcher at the University of Michigan.  Instead, the origin of this claim comes from  urlLink a 1995 report  from the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve, written by W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm.  Abramyan's appears to have cribbed the above quote from this portion of the Cox and Alm study: Tracking individuals' incomes over time gives a startlingly different view of the forces shaping America's income distribution. Let's begin with the people who were in the bottom fifth of income earners in 1975. The conventional view leads us to think they were worse off in the 1990s. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the University of Michigan sample, only 5 percent of those in the bottom quintile in 1975 were still there in 1991.  Even more important, a majority of these people had made it to the top 60 percent of the income distribution -- middle class or better -- over that 16-year span. Almost 29 percent of them rose to the top quintile. Although Abramyan tries to make it sound like his data come from an academic study at the University of Michigan, the report is actually the work of a journalist and a Federal Reserve bureaucrat, which did not go through standard academic peer review.  The Cox and Alm study also suffers from two major methodological flaws detailed  urlLink here .  First, the study looked at individuals instead of households, which leads to a misleading picture of income mobility.  Individuals in the study were as young as 16, which means that much of the income mobility was simply the result of teenagers and twentysomethings getting higher-paying jobs as they graduated from college.  For example, a teenager flipping burgers for minimum wage in 1975 would be in his early thirties by 1991, possibly working as a stockbroker on Wall Street.  This is not necessarily the result of America as a land of opportunity, but a simple consequence of getting older.  (In addition, Cox and Alm seem to pay no attention to whether the 16-year-old lived in a poor, rich, or middle-class household.)  The second major flaw is that Cox and Alm did not adjust income according to inflation.  If you don't look at inflation, it's easy to show income mobility, but that completely ignores how gains in income can be wiped out by the rising cost of living.  ( Edited slightly for HTML purposes.  Also, Abramyan and Carissa Ritner prove one thing:  Never trust the  Patriot  when they cite a study. -cpw )

       CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'... BIG TIME   I don't need his  urlLink bio page  to know that  urlLink this  is Josiah Prendergast's very first article with the  Patriot .  Before we say anything about his hilariously optimistic "Bush will win California!  And the Dems aren't united!" piece, let's give the man some  urlLink blue balls , shall we? With a week to go before California’s presidential primary election, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry holds a big lead (60% to 19%) over North Carolina Senator John Edwards among likely voters in the contest for California’s large number of 371 delegates to this year’s Democratic convention.  Over the past month Californians’ assessment of the job performance rating of Republican President George W. Bush has declined markedly. In January, 52% approved of the job that Bush was doing and 42% disapproved. Now, that rating has reversed to 43% approve and 51% disapprove, an appraisal that is the worst given him by California voters since Bush first took office in 2001.  The decline in Bush’s job ratings has affected his standings against his main Democratic rivals in simulated possible November general election pairings. Bush gets just 41% of the California voters preferences while Kerry receives the support of 53% in one such match-up. In the other, the President is preferred by 42% against Edwards’ 51%. Last month Bush was leading in both these match-ups – nine percentage points over Kerry and twelve percentage points over Edwards. Whoops.  That poll was released on February 25th, so there was no reason that Prendergast couldn't have included it in his article for the March issue, right?  (coincidentally, the 53-41 margin Kerry holds over Bush is nearly identical to Gore's 2000 victory over Bush in the Golden State)  Josiah begins his  Patriot  cherry-loss by pumping up his credentials as a highly-informed Democratic insider: The tides are turning and so are heads as the political climate, especially in regards to the Democratic Party, becomes increasingly chaotic. This heavily fractionalized institution is rallying forces to bring the ABB (Anyone But Bush) crusade to victory. Yet their newfound unity is at best a façade that chooses to neglect the reality of the Democratic Party’s void of true leadership. With the lack of a unifying candidate, as clearly they have none, the '04 presidential election will be for the Democrats what the recall was for Gray Davis—-a crushing defeat. Hmm, 60% in California, and no deep chasms of policy disparities between the two frontrunners, Kerry and Edwards.  Sounds like our friend Josiah has been afflicted with a bit of Berkeley Bubble-itis:  Just because Dennis Kucinich enjoys substantial support among Berkeley Democrats and liberals, it doesn't mean that this has any implication on divisions within the national party as a whole.  As if this weren't bad enough, Prendergast commits a Coulter tactic: Washington Post’s David Von Drehle noted, “Kerry led 2 to 1 among voters who rated electability as the quality they cared most about in a candidate.” This shows that Sen. Kerry is not supported because of his ideas, but because the public believes he is the “lesser of evils,” in a particularly bad pool of liberal candidates. The David Von Drehle quote comes from a  Washington Post  story titled "Rising Anti-Bush Sentiment Driving Democrats to Polls", dated February 4, easily found through Lexis-Nexis.  In the following sentence, the phrase "lesser of evils" is in quote marks, yet it does not appear in the  Post  story.  Yet what percentage of readers of the  Patriot , most of them either conservative or impressionable, will think that the  Post  writer David Von Drehle is presenting an objective piece of conventional wisdom by calling the Democratic candidates "evils"?  I'd say most of them.  Background:  In her 2002 screed  Slander , Ann Coulter artfully strung a series of different quotes from different sources together to lead her readers to believe that the  New York Times  called Clarence Thomas a variety of racial slurs on its editorial page.  (As you may know, this was all documented in Franken's book)  The citations for these quotes were hidden among several hundred endnotes at the very end of the book.  Here, Prendergast simply makes something up and sticks it in quote marks, irresponsibly -- or, tactfully -- a mere half-sentence after quoting a passage from a major paper, in the interest of smearing Democrats.  Moving on . . . cult of personality . . . cult of personality . . . Jews and college students will help cover the 12% difference between Bush and Kerry/Gore.  Yeah, college students are going to turn out for Republicans.  Sure, how are their student fees and loans doing?  Also, citing positive words for the Administration from the  Contra Costa Times  is supposed to be grounds for claiming that Bush is making inroads with the Bay Area?!?  Silly Josiah.  Would someone please mention to him that Contra Costa is, by far, the most  conservative  county in the Bay Area.  And the  Contra Costa Times  ain't exactly a bastion of liberal thought:  They didn't even  urlLink endorse a Democratic candidate .  I can't believe this stuff made it to print.  Let's see . . . empty rhetoric . . . empty rhetoric . . . nonsense about No Child Left Behind which  doesn't mention that Dems are upset about it because Bush and the Republicans  underfunded  it, but nice try!  And in the final paragraph, we find that the  Patriot  doesn't employ a "mixed metaphor editor": Whether you are on the campus, in the classroom, at your office, or enjoying the privacy of your home, rest assured that this state will regain its prestige with  the healing hand of conservative flavor . Wizzle-wazzle?  We at CPW look forward to many fruitful months of Josiah Prendergast columns, as their fish/barrel ratio is quite high, at least judging by this sample.  But sir, I do commend you for sharing half the name of my favorite sitting US President.

       A PARTING SHOT FOR CARISSA   I find it interesting that the  urlLink Child Trends 2002 study  cited by Carissa Ritner in the  urlLink pro-FMA piece  in this month's  Patriot  doesn't say a single word about same-sex parents.  It discusses a variety of other issues that contribute to both good and bad child-rearing environments, such as divorce, healthy vs unhealthy-but-stable marriages, the effects of welfare reform, and sex education.  (Interestingly enough, the study favors non-abstinence-only, heh)  Also, Carissa's quote is incorrect.  The quote from the Child Trends brief, on page 6, is: First, research clearly demonstrates that family structure matters for children, and the family structure that helps children the most is a family headed by two biological parents  in a low-conflict marriage . That's an interesting prepositional phrase there at the end that Carissa left out.  It would sure make people believe that the study had more to do with the health of marriages than anything about same-sex marriage.  Especially when the rest of the paragraph from the brief reads: Children in single-parent families, children born to unmarried mothers, and children in stepfamilies or cohabiting relationships face higher risks of poor outcomes than do children in intact families headed by two biological parents. Parental divorce is also linked to a range of poorer academic and behavioral outcomes among children. There is thus value for children in promoting strong, stable marriages between biological parents. So in short, Carissa Ritner, in her article supporting the FMA, used a cherry-picked, incomplete quote from a study that has absolutely nothing to do with same-sex marriage (unless she intends to condemn straight adoption while she's at it).  From the looks of it, the writers of the  Patriot  are just as shitty with their quotes and citations under John Cise as they were under Sexton.  But it gets worse.  When Maggie Gallagher of the  Weekly Standard  and Townhall cited the sentence used by Carissa, she used  urlLink the whole   urlLink thing .  She was using the quote to support Bush's "healthy marriage" initiatives, which are, you know, more closely related to the focus of the study.  Carissa Ritner wanted to use the quote to argue for the FMA, but had to lie about it to do so.  Until she rehabilitates herself, she is an official HACK.  But at least we know where she found that quote.   (note: In citing the whole paragraph, Gallagher leaves out the sentence on the effects of divorce, so when it comes to hackery, Carissa has some company)

       EVERYONE'S AN ANTI-DENTITE ON APPOINTMENT DAY   Lots of people hate going to the dentist.  I know I have for much of my life.  The imposing dental chair, the terrifying drill, the condescending hygienists, the sting of novocaine injections, and so on.  But guess what:  when it's all over and done with, my teeth end up quite nice and healthy.  It wasn't a pleasant experience, by any means, but the results were certainly very good.  Melanie Smith  urlLink hates tax day ...  --          --          --  In her article, Melanie takes a swipe at John Kerry: Even more maddening is Kerry’s recent voting record—or lack thereof. Since the beginning of the 108th Congress, Kerry has missed over 300 votes, or 65%. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States. Despite his dismal attendance rate, Kerry is still receiving full pay, which incidentally is paid for with tax money. How interesting. In a way, though, these facts have given me some insight into Kerry’s stance on taxes: I suppose if I were able pull in six figures while doing less than half of my job, I would not mind higher taxes as much as people who work overtime to maintain middle-class standing. Evidently, Melanie is either forgetting or witholding something about  urlLink her party's nominee .  From the April 8  Washington Post : This is Bush's 33rd visit to his ranch since becoming president. He has spent all or part of 233 days on his Texas ranch since taking office, according to a tally by CBS News. Adding his 78 visits to Camp David and his five visits to Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush has spent all or part of 500 days in office at one of his three retreats, or more than 40 percent of his presidency. And yet 1) He still receives full pay, and 2) It's taken about 8 crowbars and two jaws-of-life to get Bush to agree to overhaul overtime pay regulations, and even now there are still  urlLink many problems  with his decision.  And of course, this was a President whose reaction to the quite non-"historical" August 6 PDB was to take a  urlLink month-long vacation .  Melanie has other tax issues, too: President Bush realizes that it is a flawed system in which citizens are penalized for marrying and raising families. Additionally, he has successfully pinpointed the absurdity of forms of taxation such as the death tax. People do not think about this as much as they should; you cannot even die without paying the government for it. Well, Melanie, given the nature of the estate tax, you, as well as 99% of Americans who aren't multimillionaires, probably can.

       PATRIOT HILARITY ON KERRY   This month's  Patriot  hack-job on Kerry has been assigned to  urlLink Carissa "Child Trends" Ritner .  As I've mentioned, she's had problems with  urlLink telling the whole story  in past articles.  You just knew that since she was tapped to do the requisite "Kerry is a flip flopper!" story, there'd be problems here too.  And whaddya know?  On the Iraq war: Next is his extremely liberal voting record- one that puts even Ted Kennedy to shame. Wanting to solidify his position as the frontrunner for the Democratic Party, Kerry’s voting record has only been increasing in severity on the campaign trail. However, this has caused his hypocrisy, if not idiocy, to shine through once again.  For example, while he unquestionably voted in support of the current Iraqi war, he apparently did not fully read what he was voting for. When members of his party pointed out this major flaw on his nearly perfect liberal voting record, he claimed that he “voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations” and not actually use force. First of all, care to provide any examples of said liberal voting record, or are you, yet again, just parroting something you read in the  Weekly Standard  or saw on Fox News?  Secondly, I'm not seeing the problem.  John Kerry is in as fine a position as anybody else is to be able to argue that Bush made a mockery of the diplomatic process in the lead-up to the invasion.  Kerry has said, repeatedly, consistently, that his vote on Iraq reflected a trust that the president would fully and faithfully seek out all diplomatic avenues and form a real, expansive coalition.  Bush did none of those things, and Kerry is calling him on it.  Continue, Carissa: Similarly, after voting for the “No Child Left Behind Act” in 2001, Kerry is now completely reversing his stance, stating to the Associated Press in April 2003, “Between now and the time I’m sworn in January 2005, I’m going to use every day to make this president accountable for making a mockery of the words ‘No Child Left Behind.’” Moreover, after supporting tax cuts as an additional economic stimulus, he is now calling for a freeze on the tax cuts Bush passed through the Senate. Kerry also voted for the then-popular Patriot Act, but is now likening the law to Taliban constrainment and calling for its expiration. Ugh, we've been over all of this before.  Kerry is mad because Bush  refuses to properly fund NCLB .  In this case,  Bush  is the one who's flip flopping, and Kerry's calling him on it.  On taxes, Carissa gets in more hot water.  Just one paragraph prior she was berating Kerry for his "extremely liberal voting record", but now she mentions that he supported tax cuts "as an additional economic stimulus"?  Jeez, if you're gonna lie, get your lies straight, girl!  By the way, if you head over to  urlLink Project Vote Smart , you'll notice that John Kerry voted  against  virtually every Bush-supported tax cut aimed primarily at the wealthy that was proposed, including the  urlLink 2001 cut , and the 2003  urlLink divident tax cut .  He did, however, vote for Democratic substitute amendments to both bills, the former to raise the child tax credit among other things for the early 2001 cut, and the latter for the post-9/11  urlLink economic stimulus package .  Since of the two 2001 tax bills, only the post-9/11 bill was touted by anyone, Dubya included, as "economic stimulus", Carissa's hypocrisy charge must be based on Kerry's yes-vote on 11/14/2001, which was for the following: The amendment would provide approximately $73 billion in fiscal 2002 for economic stimulus measures, including $14 billion for refund checks to taxpayers that did not receive refunds during the summer of 2001. It also would provide $31 billion for unemployment benefits and health care benefits for displaced workers and agriculture assistance. It also would provide $8 billion in fiscal 2002, and $15 billion over 10 years for homeland security, including bioterrorism, food safety, law enforcement and postal programs. So Kerry's a hypocrite because he supported getting rebate checks to those who hadn't received them from the spring 2001 Bush tax cut?  Think harder, Carissa.  And that leaves the Patriot Act.  What Carissa fails to mention -- though you might remember -- is that EVERYBODY, save for Russ Feingold,  urlLink voted for the Patriot Act .  Given that it was passed in the wake of a terrorist attack, and it's now over two and a half years since the attack, it's inevitable that Congressional and public sentiment on the Patriot Act has changed.  If John Kerry has "flip flopped" on the Patriot Act, he has a lot of company.  Some civil-libertarian-oriented Republicans have questions about it too, by the way.  Again, Carissa, "extremely liberal voting record" vs "voted for welfare reform".  Get your lies together girl.  Angel Brewer was starting to worry me with her generally decent article on a real issue, but  this  is the  Patriot  we all remember.

       CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE   Congratulations to  Patriot  writer Angel Symoon Brewer for writing  urlLink an article  that is not only coherent, but also thoughtful, reasonably careful, even-handed, and happily lacking any hint of mouth-breathing.  The subject of Brewer's article is the continuing debate over the merits of outsourcing.  Angel doesn't really take a side on the issue, but even if a side had been taken, it would be forgiven, because the important thing is that the article  examines  both sides in an honest and fair manner.  A couple months ago I  urlLink chastised Brewer  for a very lazy attempt at a hack-job on the Democratic presidential candidates that didn't even bother trying after a while.  But now, Angel gives us a pleasant, informative article.  I hereby give myself credit for this.  [zoidberg] Hooray! [/zoidberg]  Just one thing.  I was curious about that BLS stat cited by brewer: The McKinsey Quarterly reports that, “the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that from 2000 to 2010, there will be a net creation of about 22 million new jobs in the economy, mostly in business services, health care, social services, transportation, and communications.” Relying on further data from the Bureau, they state “69 percent of nonmanufacturing workers are reemployed at 96.2 percent of their previous wages,” as a result. This still illustrates, however, that a great number of workers, especially those engaged in blue-collar industry, will face unemployment and financial troubles. Again, Brewer's brief analysis is reasonably sound.  The McKinsey article can be found  urlLink here .  Just curious:  Aren't we a shade behind that 22 million pace for the decade?  We know that from 2001 to now, we're looking at a net loss of around 2.5 million jobs.  We also know that the job creation rates projected by the Bush administration when they passed their most recent round of tax cuts are  urlLink far higher  than what we're actually witnessing.  BLS's projection seems to raise more questions than it answers.  Though I must say, "22 million new jobs", as a statistic, sounds mighty familiar...

       THE  PATRIOT'S  UKRAINIAN FRIENDS   Earlier today I  urlLink discussed  the  Patriot's  quick-hit piece on  urlLink George Soros  choosing to focus on their discussion of his position on campaign finance reform.  Forgive me, because I neglected the thrust of their tidbit, which was: It is in Ukraine, however, that Soros received the award he truly deserves. The "tireless philanthropist" was hit with glue and water by two unidentified men who also shouted anti-Soros statements. As you can clearly see, the  Patriot  sends its collective Kudos to the two "unidentified men" who assailed Soros.  Trouble is, those men actually  urlLink were identified .  From News24.com, a South African news org: Two students were expelled from a Kiev university after they threw liquids at billionaire George Soros while he was on a visit to Ukraine, a colleague said.   Kiev Polytechnic University students Dmytro Khmara and Atilla Selei-Dovzhenko of the nationalist group Bratstvo were expelled on Thursday, another group member, Oles Yanchuk, told the Associated Press.   The pair had claimed responsibility for throwing what Bratstvo said was mayonnaise at Soros at a start of a human right conference on Wednesday. So the two attackers were from a "nationalist group" called Bratstvo.  So what are they like?  Well, they are a radical  urlLink branch  of the ultranationalist Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA), a group that, among other things, has been accused of involvement in the 1999 bombing of apartment buildings in Moscow that led to the escalation of the 2nd Chechen War.  Bratstvo sent volunteers to fight against Russian troops in Chechnya in 1999-2000.  But it gets worse.  The Canadian Government has identified UNA as " urlLink one of the main neo-fascist groups " in Ukraine.   Not only that, they've been identified as an anti-Semitic, "neo-Nazi" group. (same link) [T]he UNA-UNSO has held large rallies where speakers denounce Jews for the country's economic troubles and, in familiar tirades, accuse Jews of stealing children, killing them and using their blood in preparing matzah.  (...)  In February 2001, the Russia Intercessory Prayer Network (RIPN) reported on an article that was published in January 2001 in the Ukrainian newspaper  Postup  (21 Feb. 2001). According to  PostUp  article, a rally took place on January 21 in Lviv in which the ... UNA-UNSO was in attendance, and a placard with antisemitic slogans was on display next to UNA-UNSO's party flag throughout the whole rally. The placard featured the following slogans: "Yids are the executioners of mankind;" "Jewish-Zionists destroyed millions of Ukrainians" and "The lot of the Yids-run the criminals out of Ukraine" (ibid.). Ladies and gentlemen, these are the people with whom the  Patriot  has taken common cause.  It's okay to be anti-Semitic, neo-Nazi, ultranationalist fanatics (and possibly, terrorists), just as long as you're willing to throw glue at George Soros.  Moral clarity!  (thanks, again, to JonP for the links)

        PATRIOT  ON AFGHANISTAN: "(NO) VOTES FOR WOMEN, STEP (BACKWARD) IN TIME!" AND "YOU GOTTA HAVE HERAT! MILES AND MILES AND MILES OF HERAT!"   Forgive my very awkward  Mary Poppins  and  Damn Yankees  references, I'm in a bit of a musical theatre mood right now.  Alert reader and CPW contributor JonP notes a couple of problems with Fatima Mojaddedi's  urlLink piece on Afghanistan , one trivial, and the other, uh, not.  The trivial problem is that, in both the print and online incarnations of the article, the city of Herat has been spell-checked into "Heart", which is either a cute gesture, or the type of mistake well-respected publications don't make.  The less-than-trivial problem?  Here's the relevant passage: American resolve and determination put an end to the problems the Taliban had and would create. Within the first couple weeks of October 2001 my relatives saw the days of the Taliban became numbered, and eventually turned into memories. The Afghan people were finally freed from the chains of ideological bondage and allowed to express their long delayed desire for democracy. Just months after the fall of the Taliban schools re-opened and hundreds of thousands of men, women and children flocked back to the classrooms in unprecedented numbers. Finally my relatives, their friends, and my friends were all awarded the rights they had long deserved and wanted, but were never able to achieve. The American dream had not only become the Afghani dream, but was also well on its way to becoming the Afghani reality.  This type of refreshing progress has continued since the beginning of the liberation campaign. The city of Heart, which was previously run by warlords, is now under the control of a democratically elected mayor, my uncle, Mohammad Rafigh Mojaddedi. Heart [sic] now has a total of 300,000 students... Hmm, that made me heart-[sic], heyo!  Take a moment to Google Rafigh Mojaddedi.  If you do, you'll find  urlLink a BBC story  on Herat (they have a more nimble spell-checker at the Beeb), which includes these passages: The western Afghan city of Herat has held what is believed to be its first election for nearly 30 years.  The vote, for the city's mayor, was carried out by a special council of about 700  men  representing various districts. So from the looks of it, the  Patriot  is trumpeting the arrival of democracy in Afghanistan, except that said democracy excludes fully half of the adult population.  Guys, 1920 called, and they...  Later in the same article: The BBC's Jim Muir, who is in Herat, says voting of any sort is a novelty in Afghanistan but this was hardly democracy in action.   The election was carried out with armed mujahideen guerrillas perched on the walls of Herat's magnificent main mosque, where the council chose the mayor from a list of eight male candidates. Okay, so it was democracy, but for men only, and at the point of a gun.  Now if they could just find some papertrail-free Diebold machines, the  Patriot  would hit the trifecta!  Now, to be fair, this election took place not long after  Heart  Herat had been liberated from the grip of the Taliban, and the situation was still volatile to some degree.  On the other hand, more than a year after the election vaguely described in the  Patriot , women " urlLink still suffered " in  Heart  Herat. The Human Rights Watch report concedes that women's and girls' rights have improved since the demise of the Taleban, with many now allowed to return to school and university. However it documents growing repression in social and political life.   In Herat, it says, religious police, government officials and squads of schoolboys monitor women and girls' behaviour and appearance.  The report cites the use of local television and newspapers by the governor to set standards.   Freedom of movement is restricted and when they do leave their homes, women and older girls must wear the all-encompassing burqa, or chowdra.   The group has documented testimony from citizens of Herat that women and girls who walk with men on the street, ride with them in cars, or even if alone with them in private homes, have been arrested.   That arrest can be followed by a gynaecological examination to determine whether they have recently had sex, or to test for virginity. And of course, as recently as a couple weeks ago western Afghanistan,  Heart  Herat included, has been plagued by  urlLink violence .  If the  Patriot  is gonna try to trumpet Dear Dubya's crusade for democracy, they're gonna have to try harder than this.

       THE BUBBLE OF  PATRIOT  COMPREHENSION OF THE LAW   From the  urlLink Minuteman  page: Another instance of Berkeley's partiality was shown in March when our “fair and balanced” Chancellor awarded the Distinguished Honor Award to billionaire George Soros for "his dedication to creating a better world." The Berkeley press release surprisingly left out that Soros donated several millions of dollars to an anti-Bush effort, shortly after advocating for campaign finance reforms, which seek to eliminate unbalanced financial contributions to political campaigns. Whether or not supporting Bush's ouster would lead to a "better world" is certainly up to interpretation, but that's another discussion for another post.  First of all, the  Patriot's  blanket interpretation of campaign finance reforms, which can only be the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002 (its Senate version often referred to as McCain/Feingold, and its House counterpart as Shays/Meehan, after the sponsors of each incarnation), is a bit off the mark.  Its purpose was to reduce significantly the influence of large financial contributions directly on political campaigns, by eliminating the ability for individuals and corporations to donate astronomical amounts of unregulated "soft money" directly to candidates and political party organizations, and not simply to "balance".  But of course, George Soros hasn't donated any money to a political party or candidate or campaign.  He has his own organization which has acted completely in accordance with the law as passed by Congress and signed by President Bush.  The  Patriot  would like to have us think that there is a direct contradiction here, one that Soros has not addressed.  Of course, not only is there not a contradiction -- Soros gives to his own organization, not to political campaigns -- but Soros himself  urlLink addresses this .  Furthermore, he notes that unlike much of the soft money of the past, funds contributed to the so-called "527" groups are fully disclosed.  Of course, the  Patriot  should know that the concept of wealthy individuals turning their own money towards political efforts is not one that is foreign to the right; Stephen Moore's Club for Growth comes to mind.  And of course, there's Richard Mellon Scaife, who spent millions out of his own pocket over 8 years with the singular intent of overturning the American people's popular will in electing, and re-electing Bill Clinton to the White House.  The  Patriot  should definitely know that, as they have crossed paths with Scaife's  urlLink sweet, sweet money  in the past.  (for the link, scroll to the 2nd-to-last post)  Certainly the  Patriot  would have no reason to grumble if either Moore or Scaife had been singled out for recognition by Berdahl, would they?

       FINISH THAT PARAGRAPH, PART 2! Abortion survivors edition   A sob story from  urlLink Errol Tremolada's  free speech piece: On March 3, 2004, a group known as The Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust came to Sproul Plaza. They were met with neither hospitality nor open arms. The group was first approached by the UCPD and asked if they were supported by a student group or if they had permission from the administration to be on the plaza; they answered “no.” The UCPD immediately attempted to remove the group and their “offensive signs.” Even a University administrator came out and told them to leave. The group wanted to videotape the conversation to provide an objective view, but the administrator would not hold a conversation on camera.  According to section 331 of the Berkeley Campus Regulations Implementing University Policies, “Sproul Plaza and Lower Sproul Plaza have traditionally been designated as areas for public expression. These areas are open to the public generally between the hours of 6:00 AM and 12:00 midnight. During open hours Sproul Plaza and Lower Sproul Plaza may be used without reservation for discussion or public expression which does not require or involve sound amplification equipment.” This reveals that The Survivors were not in any violation of University policy. So why were they being silenced?  “We were essentially prevented from expressing our views. There was no legal policy that could keep us from being on Sproul, but nevertheless the administration didn’t want us there,” said the group’s director, Kevin Mason. “When we went back the next day, another group [identified as the Cal Democrats] was out on Sproul holding signs in opposition to our group. We did not find any trouble that day and I think the reason why was that there were now students with propaganda in opposition to our pro-life views. I feel that the administration attempted to silence us solely on the basis of their beliefs and not because of any legal issue." Boo hoo.  A couple of things.  First of all, the  Patriot  article does not quote the entire relevant paragraph of UCB policy.  To the  urlLink Vice Chancellor's Office !  Number 331: 331. The Sproul Plaza and Lower Sproul Plaza have traditionally been designated as areas for public expression. These areas are open to the public generally between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 midnight. Between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m., these areas are generally closed to all activities except coming and going to a University building or crossing the campus. During open hours Sproul Plaza and Lower Sproul Plaza may be used without reservation for discussion or public expression which does not require or involve sound amplification equipment.  Space in both areas may be reserved through the Office of Student Life for use by recognized campus organizations or non-University groups in accordance with facility use regulations and established office procedures. However, use of these areas for discussion or public expression may be limited when such use interferes with the orderly conduct of University business or authorized events.  The italics indicate the portion of the rule not included in the  Patriot  piece.  So why was half the policy left out?  Was this group, the SAH, interfering with the flow of student traffic, or anything like that?  As I've mentioned before, the last time the  Patriot  chopped off the end of a quotation, it was to  urlLink mislead readers  into believing that a study about married biological parents compared to divorced and adoptive parents was actually about how bad gay marriage is.  So we can't automatically trust them with partial quotes.  I don't know what the answer is here.  But I do know that SAH hasn't had trouble getting on to the Berkeley campus:  The webpage for their " urlLink Campus Life Tour " prominently features these photos:     Note Wheeler in the background of the first photo, and the unmistakable arch from Sather in the right photo.  Were they blocking that relatively narrow thoroughfare?  Were they harassing students -- you know, slightly more than senate candidates with flyers attached to condoms to hand out do?  Who knows what happened?  All we have are the accounts of groups -- the  Patriot  and the SAH itself -- with axes to grind.  The Daily Cal makes no mention of the March 3rd incident, as far as I can see.  But wait.  Anti-choice groups have made  urlLink graphic, sensationalist use  of Sproul  urlLink before .  Also, SAH has a bit of a history of getting in the way.  In 2003, they blocked the way to an  urlLink elementary school  in Willows (north of Sacramento), barraging 1st, 2nd and 3rd graders with their graphic images (which they probably couldn't comprehend), until they were asked to move.  At  urlLink Eastern Michigan University , they skirted the rules, neglecting to gain permits to demonstrate on campus.  Of course, they tried to rely on a technicality: Survivors arrived at the University without talking to the scheduling office or getting a permit for the event. The University requires anyone using its property to get permission in advance. Without permission, the members were forced to physically hold up each poster, so that the displays weren't resting on the ground of the EMU. They also have a history of attempting to  urlLink disrupt scheduled women's events .  And they've been  urlLink arrested  for their tactics: Two people marching with anti-abortion signs were arrested at Citrus College for demonstrating in the wrong place and refusing to leave campus when asked, police said.   Abortion foes Harry Rader, 19, of Liberty, Mo., and Daniel McCullough, 40, of Twin Peaks, were walking and handing put pamphlets with five others at about 11 a.m. Wednesday on the campus, 1000 W. Foothill Blvd.   They also were carrying large signs depicting healthy babies and aborted fetuses, police said.   Problems erupted when the group wanted to march in areas not designated for free speech, said Glendora police Lt. Tim Dech.   Dech said the protesters told police and administrators the school is paid for by taxes and they could walk wherever they wanted.   "They wanted to march all around campus with these signs. If they'd have stayed where they were supposed to stay there wouldn't have been a problem,' Dech said. This sounds like the exact sort of thing the folks at the  Patriot  would, and have, criticized SJP for!  Now they're standing up for a group that has done a similar thing.  Conservative hypocrisy!  Anyway, the remainder of Errol's piece is some whining about the 527's, neverminding that Bush is doing just fine with the $170 million he's raised so far for the 2004 campaign.  And that's about it.  This was a fun way to spend 20 minutes.

       ASUC BILL ATTRIBUTION ERROR   Reader and fellow  urlLink IfSixer  Andy J notes a problem with the second to last paragraph of  urlLink this piece  by Jennifer Kolin on CalSERVE: When CalSERVE-sponsored symbolic bills are not political in nature, they are simply useless and a waste of time.  One Senator proposed a bill opposing physical violence in the Senate because one Senator pushed another Senator’s chair . What does this accomplish other than making the Senate chamber look like a kindergarten playground? While many would agree that this is already an accurate description of the ASUC Senate, many would also agree that such a resolution is self-evident, and therefore unnecessary. (emphasis CPW's) Take it away, Andy! The second to last paragraph mentions a bill opposing physical violence in the senate chambers, and implies it was written by CalSERVE senators.  Nope - it was a Student Action bill, after an action a CalSERVE senator did.  Again, not fascinatingly interesting, but most certainly incorrect. I'm sure the  Patriot  will act quickly to correct this error.  Their criticisms regarding the necessity of the bill are valid and subject to argument, but the picture they intended to paint by bringing up the bill implies a willingness to take leave of the facts to promote an agenda.  But it could have been an oversight, and they might correct it.  We're still waiting for Carissa Ritner to come out and mention that the Child Trends study she cited in her pro-FMA piece had nothing to do with same-sex marriages, but rather with comparisons between married and divorced/adoptive parents.  We could be waiting for a while.

       A HANDY GUIDE FOR THE  PATRIOT    George W. Bush:   urlLink Flip-Flopper-In-Chief .  Can they explain, clearly and without a lot of sass, how their flip-flop charges against John Kerry are fair, but the above-linked list is not?

       AT LEAST SEXTON WAS COHERENT   Ahh, another April, and with it, another edition of the   urlLink Patriot  .  Let's see what particular fish can be found in this springtime barrel.  Right off the bat, from the  urlLink editor's note , we run into problems.  Of course, given that most of these articles were written in mid-late March, perhaps it isn't fair that references in their articles to the "beacon of democracy" Iraq is becoming have to be compared to current news from Fallujah, Najaf, Ramadi, Sadr City, Kirkuk, and elsewhere.  But now we find  Patriot  EIC John "some civilians were killed" Cise treading in ridiculous waters.  Though he does get credit for spelling "Punxsutawney" correctly, even though later in the article, "two" becomes "to". Wait, who would have thought that in April, John Kerry and George W. Bush would be swinging at each other like they are now? Maybe because Kerry still cannot find a position on issues that is not poll influenced, or the relentless criticism the President is receiving from the anti-war left, television stations are reaping a bonanza in political advertisements and no newspaper reporter is going to lose his job. Aww!  What cute right-wing paranoia.  Though I'm sure  urlLink Richard Lugar  will be happy to know that the  Patriot  considers him part of the anti-war left.  Next, a line that wouldn't have been written if this piece had been written more recently, leading into the next paragraph: But what about this torrent of attacks? Is it at all warranted? As we examine in this issue, John Kerry has a history of taking to [sic] sides to every issue. When he claims that he “actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it,” referring to funds to help rebuild Iraq, the rational voter has to wonder where he actually stands on not only this, but a whole host of issues. Of  course  the rational voter won't know, if that's all you tell 'em!  If you also inform them that 1) Kerry didn't want Bush, a spending freak who can't be trusted with a budget, to have a blank check, 2) Kerry wanted to fund Iraq by repealing part of the Bush tax cut that went to the richest Americans, and that 3) In general, people who call themselves "wartime presidents" ask the American people to make sacrifices, usually including some tax increases to pay for the war effort... maybe they'd have a fuller view of the situation.  But who am I kidding?  This is the  Patriot  we're talking about!  They're a "well-respected" student journal dedicated to telling the  whole story !  To finish up his introductory piece, Cise uses that classic  Patriot  rhetorical trick, summed up as "Damnit, they're wrong!  And I'll tell you why: . . . well, actually I won't, but they're  wrong !" However, unlike the current criticism of Kerry’s waffling, the attacks on Bush’s handling of the war on terror are not fair. Led by the recent charges from Richard Clarke, Bush’s, Clinton’s, and Reagan’s former counterterrorism chief, the attacks on the handling of Iraq have risen to a new peak. Now that he’s promoting a book, Clarke seems to have forgotten that he did not speak out at all in the lead-up to the war. Encouraged by some Democrats dead set on convincing everyone that democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea, Clarke and others have continued to relentlessly trumpet the same claims over and over; claims that are invariably not true.  Take the claim that by invading Iraq, the President neglected the war on terror. Proponents of this opinion claim that the fall of Saddam Hussein will only encourage more people from the Middle East to develop a new hatred of the United States, leading to more terror attacks on the United States and its interests. However, they ignore the possibility that by creating a beacon of democracy and freedom in the Middle East (and yes, the United States will stay in Iraq until it happens), that other oppressive, U.S. hating regimes will open up; that hearts and minds will be changed by universal freedoms. First paragraph first:  Richard Clarke did not speak up publicly in the lead-up to the war because he was still a member of the White House staff, trying to exert some sort of influence on administration policy.  He wasn't writing a book or testifying to a then-non-operational 9/11 commission back then (a commission Bush initially  opposed , by the way... flip-flopper!).  Richard Clarke was a part of the lead-up to the first Gulf War, and he describes it on page 62 (Obviously Cise has read the book, and can follow along): By contrast, Bush and Baker knew that the thought of an American army going to war with an Arab nation could be enormously damaging to America's image in the Muslim world. They believed that the only way to inoculate against that damage was by extraordinary, unprecedented diplomatic effort and coalition building. Both spent long hours on the telephone for months, building and holding together the elclectic coalition. They knew that for that alliance to stay united, they had to demonstrate that they had taken the time and given Iraq every opportunity to avoid war. It could not just look that way, it had to be a really exhaustive effort to achieve a peaceful outcome. Only then could American forces go on the attack, along with the militaries of seven Arab nations.  Their historic efforts are in marked contrast to the go-it-alone, hell-bent-for-war policy pursued by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney twelve years later. Perhaps Clarke stayed on the team because, you know, he knew what good pre-war diplomacy looked like from experience, and was hopeful that Bush the younger would pursue a diplomatic strategy.  It was only after Bush dumped the UN negotiations altogether that Clarke left.  Nice try, John.  Second paragraph:  "Proponents of this opinion claim that the fall of Saddam Hussein will only encourage more people from the Middle East to develop a new hatred of the United States...".   Will ?  I'm pretty sure that opponents of the war are criticizing Bush because invading Iraq  already has  helped al Qaeda's recruiting, creating a new generation of terrorists faster than we can catch or shoot them.  And of course, at this point Bush claims that the June 30 deadline for transfer is  urlLink firm , and will not change, so depending on your definition of "be there", John might have another problem.  Of course, if Bush changes his mind and extends the deadline, wouldn't that be -- gasp! -- a  flip-flop ???  And the final pargraph: It’s time for John Kerry and Richard Clarke to stop the illogical criticism of the President’s handling of the war in Iraq.  The President did the right thing by removing an evil dictator. Freedom and democracy in Iraq are all but assured, which is nothing but a good thing. It's time for John Cise to stop the highly,  highly  illogical and fact-free criticism of those who oppose the President's handling of the war in Iraq.  And if freedom and democracy in Iraq don't seem all but assured given the events of the past week, just wait until June 30, when we get out prematurely, and set the stage for a factional civil war!  (In that case, Cise's comment about "freedom" is correct if you think about it in a Hobbesian sense)

       PATRIOT:  RECALL JEB?   Over in  urlLink Florida : Saying rigorous screening standards would ensure recipients ''won't be terrorists,'' Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday strongly endorsed issuing state driver's licenses to both illegal immigrants and foreign nationals who make Florida home for part of the year.  Hundreds of thousands of people could be affected by the proposal, which is currently making its way through the Florida Legislature. Sen. Rudy Garcia, a Hialeah Republican pushing the measure in the Senate, says it would enable those stuck in immigration limbo to drive with valid licenses and get insurance while they work to become citizens.  ''Our roads and streets will be safer because of this,'' Garcia said, adding that the sprawling nature of most Florida cities makes owning a car a necessity, and that the state, by not giving illegal immigrants licenses, ``almost tells these folks to break the law, because that's the only way they're going to be doing anything.''  Illegal immigrants wishing to obtain the licenses would have to submit to be cleared by background checks both in Florida and in their home countries. The state would rely on consular officials to sign off on background checks from abroad.

       WHY DO JOE SCARBOROUGH, LOU DOBBS, WOLF BLITZER, JUDY WOODRUFF, HOWARD KURTZ, LARRY KUDLOW, DENNIS MILLER, ROBERT NOVAK, CHRIS MATTHEWS, DON IMUS & MIKE BARNICLE HATE AMERICA SO MUCH?   Mr Wolter says of the  urlLink "librul media" : With the same intentions as Air America Radio, former Vice President Al Gore has come up with the idea to launch a liberal cable news network. He wants to see a station that unabashedly espouses leftist propaganda and displays a significant left tilt in its coverage. Unfortunately, many such networks already exist. Try tuning in to CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, and nearly ever other major broadcasting network. Okay, you're on!  I am now about to tune in to CNN.  As I always do.  See, I'm a liberal.  Okay, * urlLink click * [Kelli] ARENA: Neither John Kerry nor the president has said troops pulled out of Iraq any time soon. But there is some speculation that al Qaeda believes it has a better chance of winning in Iraq if John Kerry is in the White House. Ah, thank you for clearing that up, oh dear liberal media!  *click*  By the way, "CNBC"?!?  The  only  person employed by that network whose even  remotely  liberal in any real sense is Jim Cramer, and he's paired with an equally charismatic conservative on his show.  And I tremble at the thought that Mr Wolter had Dennis Miller in mind.  And MSNBC?  The network of "Welcome back to  Hardball , I'm Chris Matthews.  With us to discuss Al Gore's screamfest the other day at NYU -- and if anyone knows anything about screaming, it's me -- is our political panel.  Peggy Noonan is a longtime columnist for the Wall Street Journal.  Joining her will be veteran pollster Frank Luntz, MSNBC political analyst Howard Fineman, and from the 'left', former Democratic strategist Pat Caddell"?  The network that cancelled Donahue even though he had their highest-rated show at the time?  If these are examples of the "liberal media", then I weep for my country.  Yeesh.

        PATRIOT  VS. CONDI?   If you recall, in his piece decrying the "Tunnel of Oppression" exhibition/display at Clark Kerr, Mr. Tremolada  urlLink said the following : The most disturbing sign read: “US TERRORISM” and underneath it were pictures of the Klu Klux Klan. This is outrageous. The federal government never endorsed nor supported the blatant murder of innocent peoples. To say that the KKK represents America, or that our nation has ever acted like terrorists, is seditious. But then there's  urlLink Condi Rice : Condoleezza Rice said Thursday that terrorists today are driven by the same hatred that inspired Klansmen to bomb a church in 1963 in her hometown of Birmingham, Ala.  President Bush's national security adviser spoke to about 10,000 people — including a small group of protesters — at Vanderbilt University's Senior Class Day.   The bombing at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham killed four girls, including her friend, 11-year-old Denise McNair, and was meant to instill fear, Rice said.   "Those terrorists failed because of the poverty of their visions — a vision of hate, inequality. ... And they failed because of the courage and sacrifice of all who suffered and struggled for civil rights." The same "vision of hate an inequality" that fueled the opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, etc.  Again, I reiterate the complicity of local governments with lynch mobs, the cross-afiliation of Klan members and local front organizations like the White Citizens Council, and a long-standing Supreme Court decision that legitimized the idea of designating blacks as second-class citizens, creating, let's say, an environment less aggressively opposed to lynch-mobs.  Rice is right, the Klan engaged in terrorist acts, but it is important to remember that they were also a symptom of a frame of mind native to an entire region of our country, and supported, legally and otherwise, by our government.  I am unendingly happy that the United States of America ridded itself of such a legal cancer in the 50's and 60's, as I'm sure Rice is as well.  Of course, after all the ink and bandwidth the  Patriot  wasted last year trying to link Iraq to Al Qaeda and 9/11, it's hard to take their definitions of terrorist sponsorship seriously.

       NO, I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT   In the interest of building bridges, I should point out that flyover college Republicans make the BCR/Patriot types look not-so-bad.  From  urlLink Matt Singer of Not Geniuses : So, at a debate over Same Sex Marriage last night here on campus, the President of the College Republican Federation of Montana made a rather specious, offensive comment. After the President of the College Dems said that only one amendment had ever been made to the Constitution to restrict rights (prohibition) and it has proven a horrible idea and needed to be repealed, Jake Eaton, the CR guy, said that the 13th Amendment, which prohibits slavery (for those of you who are unaware), was a limitation on his rights.  Well, I suppose that's one racist way of looking at it.  It does make me wonder, though, why anyone would want to get involved in that party. How bout those Montana Republicans.  I suppose out-and-out stuff like that is easier, and more fun, than having to lie about Child Trends studies.

       CPW PRESENTS: THE COUNTRY INTERVENTION   At the back end of this month's  Patriot , Reva Alavian offers her tribute to the genere of  urlLink country music , mostly focusing on its "American values".  I must say, I'm thoroughly offended.  No, it doesn't offend me as a liberal or a person of generally sound judgment.  It offends me as a musician.  Ugh, country!  The obnoxious instrumentation!  The predictable chord-changes!  The twang!  The cutesy, but ultimately shallow lyrics!  The awful hair and ridiculous clothes!  And from the smattering of country acts cited by Reva, she isn't talking about classic country -- Merle Haggard, Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, etc -- which is at least bearable.  She's talking about this new young country crap embodied by the previous paragraph.  [sidebar] There's only one real problem, aside from glorifying country music, with Reva's article:  She cites Julia Roberts as anathema to American values, or at least those of country.  Now, I'm not the biggest fan of Julia Roberts.  But two things:  1) Her arguably most famous role, and the one for which she won an Academy Award, was when she played a   urlLink Republican   who, through her actions, displayed some very, very admirable qualities.  You know, the pursuit of justice, and making something of one's self.  Republicans like that stuff!  2) Julia was, for a time, married to . . .  a country singer!!!  [/sidebar]  Back to the task at hand.  In no way do I begrudge Reva or anybody else the right to listen to music that promotes the values they appreciate.  But look, ma’am, if you really have to listen to music that promotes conservative values, than you can certainly do a lot better than “It’s 5 O’Clock Somewhere”.  Consider this an intervention.  I assure you, Reva, that there is plenty of conservative music to go around in the world of pop and rock music, beyond the confines of the mythical pickups, 3-legged dogs and boots in the ass that modern country music brings us.  By the way, in CPW's opinion, country music died on  urlLink September 12th of last year .  So, for your amusement, use, and illegal downloading pleasure (be good), the California Patriot Watch is proud to bring you the following list of  conservative rock and pop songs .  Some of them promote conservative values, like family values, justice, religion, and so on.  Others have different associations that make them conservative-friendly.  Consider this a public service, to keep as many youngsters (and oldsters) off of country as possible.  Here we go:  The Beatles, "Taxman" -Self-explanatory.  Neil Young, "Let's Roll" -The Todd Beamer song.  Bruce Springsteen, "Empty Sky" -The most vengeful, war-oriented of the songs on  The Rising .  George Harrison, "My Sweet Lord" -Again, self-explanatory, that is, if you can handle a "Hare Krishna" reference.  Oh, and copyright infringement.  Led Zeppelin, "The Battle of Evermore" -It's vaguely about Tolkien, that counts!  Creed, "My Own Prison" -Well, maybe country isn’t so bad.  Lifehouse, "Hanging By a Moment" -And you probably thought it was about a girl!  POD, "Alive" -God rock from a low-rent Rage.  Cake, "Rock & Roll Lifestyle" -lines like "your chaos won't convert them" highlight the uselessness of an excessive, liberal lifestyle.  The Byrds, "Turn Turn Turn" -Ecclesiastical!  The Doobie Brothers, "Jesus is Just Alright" -A rockin' Jesus song.  U2, "Gloria" -An even more rockin' Jesus song  REM, "Radio Free Europe" -You remember what that was, right?  Zwan, "Jesus I / Mary, Star of the Sea" -Possibly the best hymn of all time.  Ben Folds, "The Ascent of Stan" -"once you wanted revolution, now you're the institution, how's it feel to be the man?"  Lynyrd Skynyrd, "Sweet Home Alabama" -A defense of the American south, arguing that since they don't care about Watergate, you shouldn't care about school segregation, apparently.  Guns N’ Roses, "One in a Million" -(better not tell 'em why this one's on the list)  The Clash, "Rock the Casbah" -For its association with Gulf War I  Madonna - "Papa Don't Preach" -She's made up her mind, she's keeping her baby.  Blink 182, "Stay Together for the Kids" -A pro-family-values song from a child's perspective.  See also Everclear's "Father of Mine" and "Wonderful"  Dead Kennedys, "Nazi Punks Fuck Off" -We all agree that Nazis suck, right?  (also, a highschool english teacher of mine stage-dived to this song back in the 80's)  James Brown - "Living in America" -From the great cold war movie,  Rocky IV .  NOFX, "The Brews" -Conservative Jewish punks!  Harvey Danger, "Flagpole Sitta" -The guy laments that people don't salute the flag!  Huey Lewis & the News, "Hip to Be Square" -Yup yup.  Weezer, "Pink Triangle" -Rivers Cuomo laments that a woman is lesbian, and not married to him.  Elton John, “Philadelphia Freedom” -A vibrant tribute to the birthplace of our nation.  Twisted Sister, "We’re Not Gonna Take It" -For its association with the Schwarzenegger campaign.  Red Hot Chili Peppers, “Knock Me Down” -A rockin' anti-drug song.  See?  Isn't that better?  And this is only a partial list.  There are plenty of other songs out there that promote American values and conservative values.  Feel free to add more in the comments if you want.  I list because I care.  My list was partially derived from  urlLink this list of 40 conservative pop songs  from a speech given in 2002 by Bruce Bartlett, a member of George HW Bush's Treasury Department.  Many of his songs were left off my list because, unfortunately, they suck.  (Paul Anka?  Neil Diamond?)  Other songs that made my list were the ones that occurred to me in one sitting.  Finally, if I may suggest a member of the Hollywood community whose work embodies conservative America to replace Julia Roberts in Reva's article, it is a certain Julia protege out there:  Reese Witherspoon.  Her two biggest movies?  1)  Sweet Home Alabama , a movie that shows us how much better the small-town South is than the general lameness of New York City, all while being completely non-judgmental about the Confederacy!  2)  Legally Blonde , a movie in which a not-so-bright person goes to grad school at Harvard after being admitted in a not-entirely-merit-based fashion.  Ring a bell?

       IN THE FISHBOWL Again, credit where credit is due   Two issues, two straight  urlLink generally decent articles  from Angel Brewer.  Her April piece was a  urlLink calm account  of the various issues surrounding the current wave of outsourcing in IT jobs.  This time out, she writes a story about an aspect of training for RA's (resident assistants) who aspire to serve the various UCB residence halls.  Go ahead and take a moment to read the article -- again,  urlLink here's the link  -- and come back here.  See?  There were three or four points where one would have expected sensationalist anti-left rhetoric, but never does it come.  All that being said, the article might be a tad naive.  Consider Brewer's closing sentence: The puzzling aspect of the program, therefore, is why a training session geared towards open-mindedness and the promotion of inclusion would be so forthrightly exclusive. Maybe -- just maybe -- the puzzlement expressed here is precisely the point.  Now, speaking as a liberal/progressive/what-have-you (and not as a "commie-idiot", Joan), I know that to be either white, male or Christian, any one of those is not automatically equivalent to "priviledge" in and of themselves.  However -- let's face the realities of the last 228 years -- the statement that those who have a combination of those traits have significant overlap with those who have a measure of "priviledge" in America is a roughly accurate one.  Nobody is getting discriminated against in a significant, long-lasting manner with this one "fishbowl" activity.  And from all signs, it has stirred dialog and "puzzlement".  If you read the article and were left outraged by the perceived Marxist rituals of UCB's RA training program, I suggest you 1) take a Zoloft, and 2) pick your fights.  In CPW's opinion, if the article was meant to place Berkeley's diversity programs in a bad light, it simply failed to do so.  It certainly could have if it wanted to, but that would have required less forthrightness and willingness to view the issue objectively than was shown by Angel Brewer in this case.  Kudos, if unwitting ones, to her!

      From the  Patriot 's quick-hit " urlLink Minuteman " feature:  Help our troops phone home   Sacramento’s KCRA Channel 3 offered viewers an opportunity to reach out to our troops by donating pre-paid calling cards to soldiers. The Cal Patriot couldn’t resist passing on the information to any of our interested readers! Check out any of the following websites for information: Army and Air Force Exchange Service (www.aafes.com) Navy Exchange Service Command (www.navy-nex.com) Marine Corps Exchange (www.usmc-mccs.org) This is definitely a worthy cause.  It's especially worthy right now.  This is particularly true because reports from Iraq are that Kellogg Brown & Root (a Halliburton subsidiary) is  urlLink blocking soldiers' email and net access  for the next 90 days, apparently on orders from the Department of Defense.  Why might they be doing that?

       ERROL'S TUNNEL VISION   Mr Tremolada  urlLink didn't like what he saw  in a politically-charged art display at Clark Kerr. Many students succumbed to the poorly cited facts that plastered the walls of rooms labeled sexism, racism, “class-ism,” and “religious-ism,” among others. Instead of facts, the signs presented falsehoods with implications that America was no better than any oppressive regime. One sign read: “Over one million black men are deprived of the right to vote because they are in prison.” This suggests that these men were treated unfairly because of their race. The reality is that the United States government does not allow any imprisoned felon to vote, period. There was another posting that read: “0 UC’s built, 2 CSU’s built, and over 100 prisons built.” Factually this is wrong as well, as construction for the new UC Merced is currently underway. The most disturbing sign read: “US TERRORISM” and underneath it were pictures of the Klu Klux Klan. This is outrageous. The federal government never endorsed nor supported the blatant murder of innocent peoples. To say that the KKK represents America, or that our nation has ever acted like terrorists, is seditious. Let's break down those three "falsehoods".  Regarding the "prison" item, maybe Mr Termolada should have a talk with Ms. Farenzena who, in her  urlLink piece  on Berkeley's diversity programs, argues that while  de jure  affirmative action (or "reverse racism" in Patriotese) is currently prohibited,  de facto  instances of it are still prevalent.  (Her article gets a little muddy, but that's beside the point)  Now we have Errol claiming that the stat from the tunnel has nothing to do with racism, because no  de jure  racism was involved.  These two articles appeared in the same issue of the  Patriot .  They need to get their stories straight.  Next, the "UC's and CSU's vs prisons" item.  Not to split hairs, but they said "built", and Merced is not near completion as of yet, so this is far form a falsehood.  Lastly, the "Klan" item.  The United States government both supported and endorsed the institution of enslaving an entire race for 75 years.  For over 60 years, ending in the 1950's, the US Supreme Court took a position in favor of racial segregation, one that the current  urlLink Chief Justice  has said should not have been reversed.  State and local governments in the US in decades past did not take harsh stances toward the Klan; indeed, the legitimate face of white-hooded racism, the White Citizens Council (now known as the Council of Conservative Citizens) had significant sway in local governments in the American South for many years.  I love America and want the very best for it, but I'd say all that makes the claim in the Clark Kerr display quite valid.  And with the three pictures in the online incarnation of his article (just one in the print edition), I sure wouldn't have minded if some of the material he discusses had been included.  Moving on... Mister Tremolada, expect a call in the next few days from Milton Friedman, asking why exactly you dragged him into this: This was not a Tunnel of Oppression, but rather of  neo-liberal  anti-Americanism. And finally, he caps off his piece with: My true concern with the Tunnel was that the event served as an anti-America staging ground. This kind of project completely undermines what America stands for: freedom and justice for all. How... does... it... do... that?

        PATRIOT :  DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO   Flashback time!  Last month, Melanie Smith  urlLink criticized John Kerry thusly : Even more maddening is Kerry’s recent voting record—or lack thereof. Since the beginning of the 108th Congress, Kerry has missed over 300 votes, or 65%. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States. Smith argues here that a political campaign is no excuse for John Kerry to miss work.  Glancing at this month's  urlLink issue , I see that staff writer Hovannes Abramyan did not contribute an article, and is not listed among "Staff Writers" on page 3, though according to their website, he remains a member of the  urlLink staff .  Guess he must've been busy  urlLink campaigning !  Okay, enough silliness...

       WHAT'S THE MOTTO WITH YOU?   In her  urlLink piece  taking issue with diversity programs at Cal, Alisa Farenzena kicks off her case by going after that ol'  Patriot  standard, MEChA: Imagine a campus organization whose every member was the same ethnicity and openly advocated putting his race above all others. Sound far-fetched? The description fits the bill for the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán (MEChA), whose slogan “For the race, everything; for those outside the race, nothing” is indisputably racist. Is it?  Cuz from the looks of it, it has been indisputably mistranslated.   urlLink See here  for more.  I made this point back when Vanessa "citations? we don't need no stinkin citations!" Wiseman wrote her Bustamante-Mecha story in  urlLink October .  The rest of the article is a strange read, occasionally hinting at some sort of straight-line connection between UC Berkeley diversity programs for enrolled students and its admissions policies, though reluctant to actually back up the charge.  Toss in one conspiracy theory about the motivations of diversity's proponents, and that's about it.

       DEMS FIGHTIN WORDS!   I'm sure Mr Lutske and Mr Gallais are mighty proud of  urlLink their joint article  (emphasis on "joint") describing the different ways the Democratic "attack machine" has assailed their dear leader.  Unfortunately, there are so many forehead-slapper moments in this article that if I had some white paint, I could join the  urlLink fighting Uruk-hai  several times over!  Quick!  What's wrong with this sentence? The first rounds were fired with the claim that our President went AWOL when he was in the Texas National Guard. The Alabama National Guard.  Alabama!  It's  three states over !  Okay, okay, maybe this was just an isolated case of ignorance and/or laziness on the part of the author, er, authors.  Pretty impressive, how two people can't get it right.  But let's give them the benefit of the doubt.  Continue, boys: Gaining notoriety when Michael Moore, between bites, accused Bush of being a deserter, it soon became a national story. Terri McAuliffe, National Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, picked up the idea but toned it down to make it more palatable. He, and other bleaters, started neighing that Bush went AWOL and demanded that the President releases his military records. The President readily complied. He showed them everything, they interviewed everyone and, as expected, there was no proof his service was anything less than honorable. Yet the sludge continues. Bzzzt!  Bush did  not  release everything.  He just dumped a pile of documents on the press and  said  they were complete.  Go  urlLink here  for more.  But if you two guys want to go through Bush's papers, make sure you look for Alabama, and not Texas.  Good work!  What's next?  Oh yeah, abortion: On Sunday, April 25th, approximately 500,000 abortion supporters assembled in our capital to advocate for the legalization of the murder. Whoopi Goldberg stood up with a coat hanger, a portent of what Bush might inflict upon the nation. Doesn’t this strike you as odd considering the last pro-abortion demonstration was over ten years ago? What could possibly prompt an arousal of and issue that had been dormant for so long? Is it just incidental that Bush is being attacked on all other fronts at the same time? A rather fetid coincidence. My only guess on this one is that Ethan wrote the first half of this paragraph, and Amaury the 2nd.  Because the former answer's the latter's question.  I'm going to be nice and explain this on the level, without condescending:  Bush's 2000 election was disputed, everybody knows that.  Some would go as far as to say he wasn't legitimately elected.  Whether or not you think so, that's the reason why no Supreme Court justices retired during Bush's first term; they wanted their replacements, whatever their views, to be nominated by a president whose election was legitimate and not in dispute.  With me?  Good.  If Bush is re-elected this November, legitimately, it's likely that a couple of justices  will  retire, notably the abortion swing vote, Sandra Day O'Connor.  Bush favors "strict constructionist" judges, Scalia-types.  I imagine the  Patriot  does as well.  Thus, a woman's right to choose is in jeopardy, and could hang (no pun intended) on the results of the 2004 election.  Of course, it could be part of the Democratic smear machine, but I'm gonna go with my hunch that the 500,000 demonstrators are serious about the issue they advocate.  Moving on? But now we turn to the centerpiece, the pillar around which all other criticisms can be laced. Even we must recognize that they have played this one quite well. A congressional commission that sets out to expose what went wrong on the tragic day of September 11th, 2001 and how future attacks could be prevented; seems reasonable. These are questions everyone wants answered, and Democrats have a body that has supposedly firm credibility; a congressional committee with members of both parties. This endeavor lacked foundations, however, weakened by a partisan bludgeon, and merely a shiver of opportunism has crumbled it. I hope that Ethan and Amaury know that there was a completely different commission, the Congressional investigation, that released its findings last year.  Remember?  They blacked out all the Saudi stuff?  They found no evidence of links between Al Qaeda and Iraq?  Anyway.  Of course, they're referring to the independent commission whose work is still ongoing.  Who created that commission, by the way?  (And who opposed  and then supported  the creation of the commission?)  The boys' Richard Clarke paragraph is full of head-slappers.  You'd better grab onto something... Richard Clarke’s was the first and perhaps most publicized hearing of the commission. Clarke published a bombshell book, a book of revelation, a book that would finally reveal all the evils of the Bush Administration, a book that was originally scheduled to be published on April 27th but was pushed up to coincidently match up Kerry’s vacation and Clarke’s hearing. Lutske and Gallais fail to mention that Clarke's book was held back  for three months  by the White House, and would have been released far earlier if it weren't for the extravagant amount of time it spent in the vetting process.  (by the way, "a book of revelation"?  interesting)  Okay, now THIS is just plain stupid: In this book we learn all about Bush’s failures and of the effort that the Clinton administration spearheaded to combat terror. Interestingly enough, however, Clarke informed us in January 2003, of President Bush’s “courage, determination, calm and leadership demonstrated on September 11th” in his letter of resignation. These guys can't be this stupid, can they?  Read Clarke's quote again.  He complimented Bush for his "courage, determination, calm and leadership demonstrated on September 11th".  Are Ethan and Amaury too dense to understand Clarke's implication there?  Looks like it.  Okay, I'll go VERY slowly:  When Clarke singles out Bush's positive qualities on September 11th, the implication is that  he acted poorly both before and after the day of the attack!!!   His administration deprioritized terrorism and did nothing to address the potential of a deadly attack on domestic soil before 9/11, and his administration launched a tangential, unnecessary, unilateral war on false pretenses that, oh by the way, undermined our efforts to combat the terrorist threat in a number of ways.  Got it, kids?  But wait!  There's more! Clarke informed the press in a background briefing that "there was no plan on Al-Qaeda that was passed from the Clinton Administration to the Bush Administration." Clarke was part of the administration at the time, and they gave him a script from which he needed to provide the best possible spin for said administration.  Your point? Senator Lehman also pointed out during the public hearing, that the 15 hours testimony that Clarke gave to the commission behind closed door is “tremendously different.” Suppose Clarke got the DNC memo that flip-flopping was “in” this year? John F. Lehman was never a Senator, guys.  There's two of you;  could  one  of you please do some research?  If you want to know, he was a  urlLink former Secretary of the Navy .  Five seconds of Googling, that's all it took.  Okay, we get the Gorelick paragraph, no surprise there.  How ironic, given that it was the Bush administration itself that used national security as a poltical game, declassifying various documents with the sole purpose of  urlLink embarassing their political opponents .  It's easy to smear when you're willing to play fast and loose with our nation’s security.  As for Bush, we’ll see.  Just curious, who’s slinging smut?  The only smut floating around these days seems to have been that which was enabled (and encouraged) by  urlLink Bush’s Defense Department .

      A new issue has arrived!  Huzzah!  And it's foreign affairs element, uh, suffers a bit from the fact that it's several news cycles behind.  Then again, technically Fallujah happened  after  the abuses, rapes, tortures and murders at Abu Ghraib took place.  This will be my last one of these, by the way.

      Congratulations to the new crop of  urlLink ASUC executives and senators .  Sadly, not a single  urlLink young-earth creationist  in the bunch.  Ah well, more time to man the table I guess.  UPDATE (6/10/04):  Alex of CalStuff  urlLink didn't think much  of said young-earth creationist's campaign.  Among other reasons, Alex comments: [T]heir candidate did almost no campaigning. Rather than get a sign and campaign on Sproul for two weeks rallying fellow Republicans to his cause, Amaury, it seems, expected three hundred votes to come his way by virtue of being affiliated with BCR. His brief flirtation with campaigning came on the Monday before the first day of voting. He handed out cards for a few hours. That's quite the sense of entitlement there.  What a welfare queen.  I'd say he was preoccupied with his hard work at the  Patriot , but then again, such hard work produced  urlLink stuff like this .

       SEX-NEGATIVITY FROM THE PATRIOT, BERKELEY/CALIFORNIA GOP   Back in August 2003, former  Patriot  writer and CalStuff proprietor Kevin Deenihan  urlLink commented  on a Sex On Tuesday column on "sex positivity" (written by a friend of mine, actually).  Said Kevin: The fact of the matter is that Berkeley is already as sexually liberated as it can be-- intellectually. What's holding us back is biological or emotional. I don't know that a sex column about intellectual and linguistic inhibition can do much about this. Well, apparently  urlLink not much .  From the Daily Cal: Just two days after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dubbed California Democratic legislators "girlie men," California College Republicans are taking his message to the street.  Republican students all over the state are wearing and selling hundreds of T-shirts reading "Don’t be a Girlie Man" to rouse Republican support against what they say are special interests at play in the state’s stalled budget.   "The new apparel is part of a larger effort among College Republicans to help elect Republicans in vulnerable State Senate and Assembly seats currently held by Democrats," said Michael Davidson, state chairman of the California College Republicans in a statement. Hmm.  A well-meaning Berkeley liberal chimes in indignantly: "It uses 'girl' as a derogatory term. What’s wrong with being a girl?" said Pamela Bachilla, president of the Cal Berkeley Democrats. "I think it’s ridiculous that they think its [sic] a joke, but it doesn’t really bother me that they demonstrate how insensitive they are." Ok, of course she's right that there's nothing wrong with being a girl, but the bigger problem with the shirts is that they attack girlie-ness, femininity in general, particularly in men (The Queer Resource Center rep quoted in the article right after Pamela gets it).  That they refer to a 17-year-old skit is not an excuse.  And what does  Patriot  editor and  urlLink vigorous campaigner  Amaury Gallais think of all this? Amaury Gallais, managing editor of California Patriot, UC Berkeley’s conservative magazine, said when Democratic legislators behave "as little kids when they are elected officials, the 'girlie man' comments could not be more appropriate." So being a male with prominent feminine qualities is tantamount to being childish.  Glad to have you on record!  Coming from a  urlLink creationist   urlLink VCM member , of course.  But of course, flip-flopper that he is, Gallais follows that up with some boyish excitement: "I think everyone will be excited about it," Gallais said. "I found the idea awesome—I can’t wait to get the shirts." Regardless, CPW strongly endorses the sale of these shirts.  If the California College Republicans and their allies at the  Patriot  intend to spread the belief that only men serve (or should serve?) in the State Capitol, who am I to stop them?  By all means, embrace that position, Republicans!  (And by the way, there's essentially been agreement on the budget for a while now, the sticking point is that Schwarzy doesn't want to pass it until the Dems agree to support two un-related  urlLink anti-labor measures , thereby pleasing the Guv's own -- gasp! -- special interest buddies)
