      "Come you masters of war You that build all the guns You that build the death planes You that build the big bombs You that hide behind walls You that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks" - Bob Dylan (Maters of War)  I saw and advanced screening of Fahrenheit 911 today.  The temperature at which freedom burns  seems to me to be alot higher. It seemed like it was about 1 trillion dollars&nbsp; the Sauds have invested in U.S oil companies. When big businesses have that much money freedom has long be left to the ashes.  "Let me ask you one question Is your money that good Will it buy you forgiveness Do you think that it could" -&nbsp; Bob Dylan (Maters of War)  The movie went on for too long in some places it shouldnt have, and missed out on some humour it could have had. Apart from that it was a great thing for anyone to see. The shear volumes of money involved in American politics and upper class life are amazing. The attitudes those tich have towards the poorer people of the world are disgusting. The pure stupidity of the American president is beyond belief. I know atleast half my grade of 15 and 16 year old school students are more literate than him.   "How much do I know To talk out of turn You might say that I'm young You might say I'm unlearned But there's one thing I knowThough I'm younger than you Even Jesus would never Forgive what you do" - Bob Dylan (Masters of War)  " Some people call you the elite, I call you my base" George W. Bush. He called himself a wartime president. He even fucking said whenever he thinks war is on his mind. The shear lack of any political criticism of the bastard is outstanding.&nbsp; The moderate left just&nbsp;dont have enough&nbsp;will power&nbsp;to be leaders opposing such a dangerous president. Fuck it being more electable to have a moderate political opponent. The moderates have a cry all they want. If they dont stand strong on this then why should the left want them. Hip Hop is the channel through which I rebel, but I quote Bob Dylan one last time.  "And I hope that you die And your death'll come soon I will follow your casket In the pale afternoon And I'll watch while you're lowered Down to your deathbed And I'll stand o'er your grave 'Til I'm sure that you're dead" - Bob Dylan. The most powerfull man alive cant do nothing to stop me.   &nbsp;

      "fuck Chuck Phillips and Bill O'ReillyIf they try to stop hip-hop, we all gon' rally"- Jay Z   A poll in Canada found that 40% of Canadian teenagers think America is an "evil country", 60% of French Canadian teenagers agreed. Bill O'reilly blamed this on two things Micheal Moore and Anti-American foreign Media. As I now have a blog I think I am officially Anti-American foreign Media. So I take half the blame and think I have to argue a bit with Bill.   After blaming me for making Canada hate the U.S. Bill started to list the good deeds America has done world wide throughout the last century. He calculated that America has "freed" 240 million people world wide. I think I need to quote the Russian knights in  King Arthur  when I say "I am already free Roman, I was always free".   As for the way Fox News channel demonstrated its ability as a strong source of fair journalism by not being able to find the amount of Foreign Aid France donates every year. In 1997* France donated $6.35 billion dollars in Development Aid compared to $6.17 billion donated by the U.S. Ofcourse this makes up only a small part (.45%) of Frances GNP the U.S gives an entier .08% of its GNP to Foreign&nbsp;Development Aid. The U.S obvioulsy give alot more in military Aid, for this&nbsp;the terrorists of the world are eternally greatfull. Yes, they should thank the U.S for fueling the fire before burning itself on it.   I dont hate the U.S. I like Bill says merely have a dissent for the nations policies. I do however hate you Bill.   *I`m sorry Bill, the massive power of me searching google cant equal the efforts of the Fox News network.   &nbsp;

      Are&nbsp;insults funny? I mean plain out stupid insults like&nbsp;"lewis i dont even know you, but i bet you have your own fucken blog that is doubles the gay of this one. Congratulations diphit". Thanks for defending my pride against lewis and all Ryan but it seems crude. I have a problem with the use of the word gay for one. I`m sure their is a word like crap or stupid u could use that would be insulting but make u look like ur less of an oathe. Everyone knows its you fool.   Im gonna have to look about blocking some of these posts Ryan, if they dont discontinue. You have been warned. I know how much I sound like one of those dickheads who run forums right now.   but u made me do it patisson... u made me do it

      School started again yesterday, looks like we could be in for a decent semester. Two things im glad about at school to start this term first of all:  1. Oh my god! Soccer season is almost over. Although soccer has been okay this year, I really want to get into athletics season. I think have a coach who gets very angry, very often, very loudly, has highlighted the problem I have with direct competative sport. Namely how stupid people get when they play it.  2. Dancing in P.E. Apart from being an uncompetetive sport, and aside from the stupid dances we`re doing, its fun and funny to watch people dance.   And the one thing im already angry about at school: 1. The senior courtyard still isnt finished!!! Oh yes, the counstruction yard/ school i have had my education in is still underway. I think perhaps if they hadnt decided to build and egg shaped fountain/ tribal worship altar in the middle of it construction may have been on time.   So 2 good and 1 bad. I`m coming of on top for the rest of the term.

      Ok so i saw King Arthur last night. I expected atleast some reference to be made to the holy grail in any recount of the legend. Just one of the necessities of that story. Even if its a metaphorical quest for the attributes associated with the first King of England.   Anyway this quest I had to go on was to find something equally as elusive as an moral high ground for the British for the next 1500 years. Yes, I was out to seek Free (yes Free not 90% free ) SMS. I am also worried about the impending crisis that whilst I am driven insane by this Holy quest my best friend will steal my queen and we will both be killed in a Bloody battle of revenge.  &nbsp; Woe, indeed, as I try the second Free sms website in a week. The 8 free sms I am supposedly to recieve each day also cost me $6 from my phone credit. King Arthur may have repelled Saxon invaders and defended the Christian values of his Celtic community (???), but did he ever have to unsubscribe himself from countless pointless channels giving him daily tadbits. Such as "Be unique and different, just say yes." Did the one who drank from the Holy Grail ever have to wonder how being an affermative sheep mimicking the rest of society make you different and Unique. &nbsp; And the legacy of my quest... Far greater than making the blood line of the British Royal family holy. I have managed sign up countless of my "contacts" to this free sms. Yes they to will sign up their "contacts" and so forth until an entire race of people has been created. Not holy but also without inbreeding, my legacy is a population with a fear of any Free SMS web. Yes never again will we trust small unstable internet firms with our mobile phone numbers or email addresses. Unless they offer free penis enlargements!

      My Blog.   Its about taking out anger on people, hopefully in the most constructive way. Insulting people using your ruthless cut throat wit. Thats why no comment to this blog will be deleted if its funny. Spam is never funny, and neither is James.   Look how good my insults are.

      Do you ever have the need to just jump? Specifically when your in a very rich part of the city and their are business people ehaving lunch?  I do too, its strange the sudden earge to throw your hands in the air and leap of even the smallest step. I do enjoy when you look at me funny. Yes you NRMA executive, you may be incharge of my insurance policy but when it comes to jumping of small obsticles and break dancing in hotels. You have nothing on me!

      The ADF (Australian Drug Foundation) give a yearly award called the "Boozie", instead of being for some sort anti-alcohol campaing that tackles youth drinking, this award goes to a television show. Not as you might think a television show that demonstrates to young people the dangers of excessive drinking but one that promoting alcohol abuse. The address for this award is  urlLink http://www.adf.org.au/news/press/pr20403.html  although that looks like it might change.  My P.E assignment takes me to many weird and wondeful places, others I find might follow.
