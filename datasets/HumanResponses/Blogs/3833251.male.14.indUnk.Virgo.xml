      yea....um....i dont know to much about the national day we freed each other or whatever happened but i know that its a day with tons of fireworks....Today when i woke up it was around 1030 so i got dressed and went to church which is always fun but today ecpecially becuase we got food....then we all (me, mary, all sams, and jeff) went to Two guys since NY Pizza was closed which we couldnt believe....no one had any money and it turned out to be 30 bucks so Baynes paid for half of it while the rest of us split the other half...yea you know it hes a dealer...no, but then i went to the record store with him and he bought some gangster wanna be rapper CD... Nitorous B or something like that...when we got back to Church i got picked up and chilled till nightime when i went over to a friend Dustins house...over there we set off tons of fire works with alot of friends and i saw some people that i hadnt seen in a looong time so it was fun....now im at home and reflecting...i still miss the people from BYC soo much that was awesome....later

      First i must say i forgot about the first days so i only wrote what i remembered and second im not good at writing long things i get drifted off into other topics so try to stay with me... BYC was awesome this year...i hadnt gone in two years becuase i missed last year so it was cool seeing everyone again...when i first got there it was a little akward because i wasnt sure whether to jump up and greet everyone or just stay relax and chilled...so what i did was just hang with the people from my church until either people came to me or i met them...two days later i was hanging out with everyone and was so glad to be back...that day i went tubing which sucked and was soo boring that i got out with Cameron which was cool becuase we just sat and talked....which is what we did in the river of HELL except we didnt freeze our asses off....when i got back i took a HOT shower and it felt really good becuase out there you had to wake up at the crack of dawn to get one...so i took cold showers every morning...anyways back to the topic...i went up to dinner and then it was time for the afternoon activity which was a game show....that was alot of fun and then i went to bed...the next day we just chilled and then at night it was the bonfire night so me 3 sams wade and jeff all acted like we were high so dillion would get mad....and it worked wonderfully....he got soo pissed and thats when we learned how good of a friend he was...he was trying to keep us straight during a church meeting so we wouldnt get caught even though we knew what we were doing...it was cool...after we told him he got mad and it was soo funnythe next day i woke up and while i was trying to tell everyone not to go on the river but of course no one listened and they all went and all came back miserable....but i must be honest while they were gone i went up with Jessi to the girls cabin and got some drink..yes it was time for Captain Morgan the greatest man alive....i got pretty drunk and was running around during free time trying to play soccer when i really couldnt....that night we had a dance whihc was awesome....i loved it when the seniors got up and sang queen and the mosh pits....what a fun night...but then the next day we had a serious group meeting which was really interesting becuase since it was a church camp we prayed and stuff...but this time we got to go to different people and they were standing there with a candle and we prayed for whatever we wanted...everyone was crying...and i even caught myself crying to although no one saw me its all good...I prayed for everyone else once and the other time i prayed for my family...it was alot of fun....afterward we had a talent show which was really funny...and the next day we all left which was really sad...hopefully though i get to see those people agian really soon like sometime in the winter so i dont have to wait a whole nother year...alright welll im oing to go...later     **MY DAYS MIGHT BE MIXED UP** its hard to remember
