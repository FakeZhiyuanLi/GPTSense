						    Ni Joi Barrios Congress of Teachers/Educators for Nationalism and Democracy - Alliance of Concerned Teachers   Ang akala ng lahat May layang magpahayag, Ngunit tayo lang ay nalingat May batas nang di mapaliwanag. (Mayroon nga ba talaga? Tiyak na tiyak?)  May estasyon sa telebisyon, Bawal magbilang ng resulta ng eleksiyon, May pahayagang waring pinagbawalan Tumanggap ng adbertisment ng kalaban.  Tanging ang Madam at kanyang mga katuwang, Ang sa bolang kristal ay may tangan-tangan.   Gloria Gloria salamangkera.  Pinagbubuhol na parang panyo ang balota, Paghugot sa sumbrerong mahiwaga, Lilipad ang kalapating may dalang korona. Dali-daling ipuputong sa salamangkerang reyna.  Mga kababayan, magbantay, mangamba.  Walang demokrasya hanggat may pandaraya. Walang kalayaan hanggat bawal magsalita. Lumabas sa dilim, Hiwaga ng salamangka ay itakwil.  Taumbayan ang siyang dapat na mangusap. Taumbayan ang mananaig nang higit sa lahat, Tayo ang taumbayan, at nasa atin ang lakas!  Ika-24 ng Mayo 2004   Dr. Joi Barrios, cultural committee head of the Congress of Teachers/Educators for Nationalism and Democracy, UP chapter (CONTEND-UP). CONTEND is a member-organization of the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT).

						   Wala kang damit, Kamahal-mahalang Emperatris. Nagtatago ka sa ilalim ng damit na habi sa hanging sinulid: di pa rin maikakaila ang iyong kahubaran. Ang iyong paglapastangan sa hatol ng bayan ay parang bulok na karne ng baboy  na isinilid sa banga: isinisigaw ng alingasaw na nasa tabi-tabi lamang ang kubling kabulukan.  Malilinis at malilinis ang banga, Mahal na Emperatris.  Mene thecel phares .

						   Hanep, blog naman ngayon... today the Internet, tomorrow the World! Muahahahahahaaaa—*cough, cough*.   Mga dalawang taon na rin simula nung unang taon akong naging miyembro ng Tinig (teka, parang ganito rin yung sinulat ni Gela a—para kaming gumagawa ng  testimonial  para sa Tinig); Unang-una ko pang nadaluhang EB e nung Anib EB ng 2002 (nga pala, me EB tayo sa darating na Linggo). Sa forums nakilala ako bilang erkon dahil sa aking "kayabangan". (Ano bang masama sa pagsasabi ng totoo? Talaga namang ako ang pinakaguwapong nilalang sa daigdig a!) Malaki rin ang itinulong  ng Tinig sa lubos na pagkawala ko sa gapos ng depresyon at, kahit nagkahiwalay na ng landas ng mga dating kabarkada, e nagkaroon naman ng bagong mga kaibigan (hindi ka- ibigan , iba yun) dito sa Tinig. ^_^  Sa ibang usapan...  Hay, hindi ko pa rin naa- update  sayt ko! Hirap 'pag nagse- set  ako ng  deadline  para sa  update  ng sayt, palaging nale- late  (nauna ko pang ma- update  v37 ng Tinig kaysa sariling sayt ko); 'pag hindi naman ako nagbigay ng deadline, naa- update  ko nang mas maaga.  'Di bali, me nasulat na akong tatlong tula (me pito pang nakapila). Pagkatapos ng mga tula e kaunti na lang: tatlong maikling kuwento, at tatlong  book review . Tapos ia- update  ko na rin yung mga  link  ko.  Samantala, ihahandog ko muna sa inyong lahat ang pinakahuling tulang natapos ko:  ======   End of Apocalypse  Upon the moaning wall, in rich blood,  Shall the Book of Heavens be written. When Earth is made barren by Plague's flood,  The final seal will then be broken.  In the world where beasts of hate ruled long  And where the seven angels contend, The final choice between right and wrong  Unveils an alpha: Omega's end.  The war to end all wars now comes near—  The last cry of anguish, last blood-let, The last reign of Strife, or Freedom's tear?  Only time can tell who'll win the bet.  We must make our choice before the light's death.  Do you play good's, or evil's wild song? Will you let Hope die by the blight's breath?  Which hand shall you guide to sound the gong?  Take up your arms and choose who's your foe.  Shall it be the demons, or angels? Whose head shall your vengeful blade bring low  In this blood-fed game of sentinels?  And when the trumpet heralds silence;  The symphony calls for the last choice. Which soul shall rise into eminence?  Make your stand, and raise your mighty voice.  Be quick, and choose, before the moon's wane.  Before darkness waxes evermore. Sing the choice while our minds are still sane.  Let us swim from blackness to light's shore.  ======  (Wow, lupit ng  font , bagay sa tula ko! Anong  font  kaya ang ginamit dito?)  Okey, yun na lang muna, at me  date  pa 'ko mamayang 11—LOL.

						   Hay, sa wakas at nakapagpost narin ako dito sa blog ng Tinig.Com. Sa ngayon ay medyo abala ang inyong lingkod sa pagsusulat at sana ay maipasa ko na ito sa susunod na isyu.   Naalala ko lang na malapit na ang aking kaarawan, at tila kailan lang noong nabuo ang Tinig. Isa ako sa mga naunang sumuporta sa planong ito ni Kuya Ederic. Ang masasabi ko lang ay nagabayan ng Tinig ang aking paglaki: namulat ang aking mga mata at isipan sa tunay na nangyayari sa aking paligid. At ngayong malapit nang maging legal ang aking edad ay alam kong patuloy parin akong magiging aktibo sa pagsusulat habang nag-aantay ako sa mga bagong posibilidad na mangyayari sa aking buhay.  Mag-iingat kayong lahat at magandang gab mula dito sa lungsod ng Winnipeg, probinsiya ng Manitoba sa bansang Canada. :)

						   Ang mga pumugot sa iyong ulo ay di silang kumitil ng iyong buhay.  Ang mga pumaslang sa iyo ay silang tagapamandila niyaong digmaan ng kahayukan sa "itim na gintong" ipinagbubuntis ng Iraq. Sanlaksa man ng lahat ng dugo sa daigdig ang ibubo nila, kung kapalit ang pagbaha ng "itim na ginto" sa Wall Street ay ano sa kanila?  May tanging puwang na laan sa kanila sa yungib ng Impiyerno.

						   She was born a daughter of the Church, And guided by the hand of a priest. Her mother gave her the love and faith; But the priest taught her lies of the Beast.  When the bells make way for silence's song, The priest resumes his rhapsody's dreams. Her mother's gone, no help from her now; All alone with the false priest, she screams.  The pious hypocrite holds a cross; He whips at her face with the Bible; He laughs at her dripping maiden-blood And pounds her head to the black idol.  The day has died. She's chained to the stake And bathed with the eager-boiling   pitch  . The "faithful" then gather and taunt her While she's burned at the stake as a "witch."  Nothing but her blackened corpse remains: Alone with the sound of the last silence.

						   I Bawat patak ng pawis ni Ka Linong tumulo sa pinapasukang pabrika ay kalansing ng ginto sa sako ng dayuhang kumpanya, ngunit sa bawat matapos na araw ay baryang parang limos lang ang naiuuwi niya.  II Bawat punlang itanim ni Ka Selo ay luntiang gintong inaani ng propitaryong sumososyo sa banyagang negosyante, habang ang kanyang kinakain ay sindami ng kangkong sa tuyong lupa.  III At pagtatakhan pa ba na ang kanilang martilyo't asarol ay naging mga baril? Magtaka ay parang pagkagulat na ang araw pala ay maliwanag.

						   Iraq! Iraq! Inilimbag sa dugo ang pagkakapatiran ninyo ng aming bayan. Ang laya mo'y gapos na gintong tanikalang bitbit ng mga tagapagligtas sa atas ni Tiyo Samuel-- ganyan ang aming kasarinlan. Ilang inosenteng buhay ang pinatid sa Balangiga't Falluja? Ilang bilanggo ang binuhusan ng dahas sa Fort Santiago at Abu Ghraib? At lahat nito'y sa ngalan daw ng ating paglaya.  Ngunit magkapatid nga ang aming bayan at ikaw, Iraq. Tinutunaw sa ating mga bundok at lansangan ang huwad na kalayaang sa ati'y aginaldo ng imperyong itinindig ng pagkagahaman.

						   Whoo, dapat nung June 13 ko pa ito ipo- post , kaya lang medyo nabubuwang ako nung mga nakaraang araw (kelan kaya ako 'di buwang). Kamakailan kasi, nakatapos ako ng maikling kwento. Pangalawa na 'to bali na natapos ko (marami akong nasusulat na kwento dati, kaya lang 'di ko natatapos dahil nagiging masyadong detalyado).  Sa totoo, nung nasa ikalawang taon pa lang ng haiskul ako nung naisip ko ang konsepto nito—at hindi, hindi ako pangit magsulat nung haiskul (mukhang mas magaling pa nga ako sa paggamit ng salita nung haiskul pa lang ako kesa ngayon, kaya lang tumigil ako sa pagsusulat ng 2 taon). Naalala ko bigla ang istoryang ito habang binasa ang isang maikling kwentong sinulat ni Haruki Murakami, yung  All God's Children can Dance  (kabilang sa koleksiyon ng mga maiikling kwento niyang nagngangalang  After the Quake , na pinublish ng Knopf Books). Wala silang pinagkakatulad sa istorya, pero pareho silang may pagka- surrealistic . Basahin n'yo na lang: =====   Beyond the Abyss of Minds     His face was like a frozen mask, one that held no light. As he looked upon the scented stationary, no emotion can be traced upon his features: no anger, nor grief, nor laughter; it was as lifeless as a newborn corpse.  Still he stared upon that piece of paper and its prosaic content. It's not as if they cared about each other the way married people should; they never did—never had, and never will. Their relationship was as empty as a bag filled with air. Why the hell should he care about her letter, then?  Reginald leaned back on his chair and adjusted his glasses. He cleared his mind by looking around his study. Then he straightened, and reread Hilda's letter. It ran:    By the time you receive this, I would be very far away from you. The two years we spent together have done nothing to improve our declining relationship. You have not even taken any steps for the betterment of our situation.  It's not that you're a bad guy, or anything. It's just that you've never done a thing to show that you really love me. You've done everything to keep me satisfied, and we've had happy times, but that's not enough.  You never loved me.  You never had.   "So what?" He murmured. "I never knew what love meant."  Reginald negligently threw the paper to his desk. He went to the kitchen, took down a bottle of beer from the chiller, and went back to the study.  He took two swallows of the cold brew, settled down in his favorite chair, and drank in his surroundings. The room was painted in gray, his favorite color—though, once, his favorite was blue. The desk was placed on the right wall, giving a convenient view of both door and window. His writing implements were arranged in an orderly fashion on the desk. A sturdy shelf can be found beside the window, on its left side; books on many subjects—from biology to literary criticism to history—embraced the spaces of that antique structure. There was a small bunk beside the door, which he uses when he needs to take a quick rest.  What always caught his eyes when he lets them wander, however, were the walls. To the left and right of the square room were the paintings of his best friend. On the wall behind his desk were three of her paintings: a vivid description of a quiet country setting on the left, a grotesque portrayal of the horrors of war on the right. In the middle was an ambiguous painting—anyone he invited to scrutinize it described it differently. Whenever he looks up from his desk, he will find two more of her paintings: to the left was a painting of them both, looking at the sunset; to the right was a portrait of her own face.  Trina's face.  His best friend, and Hilda's older sister.  Katrina...who died four years ago.  *****  He had known Trina for as long as he can remember. They might even have shared a cradle, for all he knew—but he could never have asked his parents; they were good for nothing, except providing for his sustenance. Between his every breath, he had never seen his father's pride and had never felt the warmth of his mother's heart.  They were always busy in their work, so he was almost always left in the care of Trina's parents, who worked at home. Trina's father was a sculptor, and her mother was already a well-known writer. They were always very compassionate.  Anytime school was done, he and Trina would always be together, brewing up things to do. Sometimes they would watch either Trina's mother or father at work. Other times, they would pester Hilda, and tell stories to each other. When they tire of their activities at home, they'll go out to freshen themselves. They would visit the park or buy things at the plaza; play in the arcades, or play pranks on Hilda.  As they grew older, he began to notice how pretty Trina was. Everybody began to notice, actually. While Hilda was, in truth, prettier than Trina, people automatically noticed Trina because she always seemed to have a smile on her face. But they didn't know that she could also be very serious, especially when painting. Painting was a natural thing to her, but patience wasn't. There were times when he irritated her, and that usually led to their throwing of colorful remarks to each other. They would shout at each other when that happened, but when they've sufficiently cooled down, they'll shut up and everything would be all right again.  When his parents died on a plane crash, he didn't feel a thing. He didn't feel any sadder than he should be. It was when Trina's mother died of cancer—and her husband's eventual death due to grief—that he cried. They were the only ones whom he could call mother and father, but now they were gone.  Reginald and Trina did the best they could to support Hilda's education. They were just gone from college, but Hilda was still struggling on.  It was a few weeks after Hilda's graduation that the tragedy happened. Reginald was just coming home from his work on the net shop. It was raining heavily outside. As he was nearing the house they stayed in, Trina ran to him, carrying an umbrella. She was only two paces from him when a speeding car ran her down. The driver didn't even bother to help. The car just changed lanes and flew away, leaving them behind.  He couldn't think clearly, but Hilda saw what happened and hurriedly called an ambulance.  The doctor told them that Trina's wounds were fatal, and there was nothing he could do. Reginald wanted to hit him, but decided against it. It would only be a waste of time.  He and Hilda looked in on Trina. The doctor said she only had a few minutes left.  "I'm glad you came," Trina said, "I almost thought I'd die alone." She smiled weakly.  Hilda tried to smile, but she didn't succeed. She broke down and cried.  Reginald took a chair and sat close to Trina's bed. He caught her looking at him. There was a strange look in her eyes. "I wanted to give you something before..." she didn't finish her words. Instead, she pointed at a small box on a table beside her bed. "It's your birthday today, you know?" She tried to sound casual.  He didn't open the box, but he put it on his shirt pocket. He smiled at her, and enclosed her hand with his.  She sighed slowly. "No matter what happens, I want you to be happy." She closed her eyes and slept.  Fifteen minutes later, she died.  *****  He remembered that strange look in her eyes, and the weight that came over his heart when he saw it. He also remembered the box. He opened the lowest drawer of his desk and took out the box.  He had never opened it since Trina gave it to him. He didn't want to remember her death back then, and that was why he kept it hidden—he had hoped, even to himself.  He looked at the curious engraving on it.  Trina , the letters said. He opened the box.  He almost dropped it when he saw what was inside. It was a silver locket, shaped like a heart. He took it in his left hand, and opened it. On a vibrant blue background, he found three words written:  I Love You .  Unbidden, the tears came to his eyes. He felt his throat constrict, and couldn’t breathe. Beyond the abyss of his mind, he knew why.  "And did it take you so long to admit it to yourself?" He heard a light voice behind him.  He turned quickly, and there, with a silver nimbus around her, was Trina. She was smiling at him.  He took her in his arms, and their lips touched.  Even unto this day, he was never quite sure that it was just a dream.  *****  The next day, his neighbor delivered him a letter from Hilda:    I'm sorry about yesterday. I wasn't feeling very well. It was unfair of me to make you suffer over our relationship; I had faults too.  We'll never be a true couple, but we can still be friends. We owe that to Trina.  Let's get this done the right way.    In spite of his situation, he smiled.  Why not?  He thought.  Their annulment left them without regrets, and they went back to their old friendship.  *****  The church bells sung the climax of the wedding, and the people cheered.  Two years after his disastrous relationship, Reginald met Melina. She was a new employee in the office he worked in. They became friends instantly.  The first time he saw her, Reginald's heart almost stopped. Melina, whom some people called Merry—but whom he preferred to call Lina—looked too much like Trina. His heart didn't stop, but he dropped the CPU box he was carrying...on his feet. The CPU was fine, but he had to walk slowly for a few minutes. Lina’s eyes bulged a bit, but she recovered quickly. She put a hand to her mouth and laughed.  He couldn't believe his eyes—and ears. Even her manner was too much like Trina.  But maybe it was just a coincidence.  *****  Later the next day, he opened the middle drawer of his desk and took out an old diary. He stopped writing on it ever since Trina died, but he wanted to write one last time.   The entry read:    Was what happened before just a dream, and what happened after that a coincidence? Who knows, and who cares?  ===== Nag- enjoy  ba kayo? ^_^  Natutukso akong isama 'to sa susunod na issue ng Tinig, kaya lang tinatamad akong ipadala kay Vlad (at sa dami ng literary na dumarating, mahirap itong ipasok niya). Ayoko namang basta na lang isaksak sa susunod na isyu, dahil wala naman ako sa  pool of editors  para sa  Literary Section . Nakakahiya na yun...^_^  Sabagay, tiyak namang maisasama 'to sa susunod na  update  ng  urlLink sayt  ko! (Siyempre dapat  energetic  tayo para sipaging mag- update .)  Nga pala, nakita ko kamakailan sa Power Books ng Greenbelt si Ronald[Atilano]. Mukhang namayat, at dumami ang puti ng buhok—siguro sa hirap ng trabaho (Kaya mo yan! Relaks lang.) Sa September na pala ang  due  ni Eris.  Okey, tama na 'to at baka humaba pang lalo.  (Sana pala makapag- set  ng EB bago matapos ang buwan na 'to; inaabangan ko ang panlilibre ni Melis ng inom...sana.) LOL

						   Naliligo ang Mindanao sa dugo ng mga taong binitay sa salang paghahangad na mamuhay nang hindi katulad ng mga hayop. Sa Malacañang at sa Kampo Aguinaldo, may mga naglalako sa White House ng dugong walang-patid ang pag-agos sa Mindanao.  May bahagi nating pinapaslang sa bawat buhay na maglaho roon. Tayo na't sa ating mga diwa't puso ay ipagtanim ng makataong buhay ang mga kapatid natin sa Mindanao.

						   Gusto ko lang sabihing  urlLink WordPress  na ang gamit ko sa pag-a-update ng aking  urlLink weblog .  Nakakuha kasi ako ng 150mb ad-less free space, at dahil pre-installed na ang Wordpress sa aking account kaya naman sinubukan ko. Noong una ay nahirapan akong intindihin lahat pero ayos na naman ang aking blog. Binura ko ang ilang mga entries kaya ang orihinal na bilang ng entries (308) ay nabawasan. Karamihan sa mga binura ko ay iyong mga bandang Oktubre-Disyembre 2003.  Kumusta nga pala kayong lahat? :)

						   Salamat sa inyong mahiwagang sabon, at ang mga dukha'y maaaring magkutis-mayaman. Sa kutis man lamang ay mapapantayan ng mga dukha silang karamiha'y kaya lang maputi ay pagkat kayraming nagtitiis ng pagngangalit ng araw para sa kanila. Di man ninyo sinasabi'y sinasabi na rin ninyo na pangit ang mga kutis nilang nagbibilad sa araw upang ipag-ani ang mga hindi man lamang nakakalabit ng kahit isang sinag ng araw sa bukid. Kaya't salamat sa inyong mahiwagang sabon, at ang mga dukha'y maaaring magkutis-mayaman.  Ngunit hindi hanggang diyan lamang ang pagkakapantay, at hindi ito mahahabi sa mabangong katahimikan ng isang banyo. Ito'y iaanak ng magkasamang himagsik ng kabunduka't lansangan!

Anyway, I've added 3 poems today: Post-modernistic Prostitution, A Requiem for the Damned, and End of Apocalypse. Check them out. By the way, for anyone interested, I'm also (as of v37) the acting-webmaster for Tinig.com right now. ^_^  (This was supposed to have been updated earlier, but the ftp account of the other host was acting stupidly, so I had to transfer to another host in the meantime—I hope.)   ==== Nga pala, kapag hindi gumana yung link sa taas pwede n'yo ring gamitin  urlLink ito .

						    * Woman Trafficking in South Korea     A PETITION DEMANDING A STOP TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF FILIPINO ENTERTAINERS IN BARS AND CLUBS AROUND U.S. MILITARY BASES IN KOREA    Many Filipino women who come to Korea with E6 visas end up working in bars and clubs in the vicinity of US military bases in South Korea. An intolerable number of these Filipino women have been subjected to sexual harassment, verbal and physical abuse, maltreatment and other human rights violations by owners of promotions or clubs and/or by their customers. Many of these victims were brought to Korea specifically for the purpose of sex trafficking and find themselves trapped in prostitution.  urlLink >>>>>>>more    * Mass Repatriation   Panaghoy ng Kabataang Migrante sa South Korea    Nagsimula ang mga pangambang ito buhat noong kami nagdesisyong magtrabaho at manitili sa bansang ito ng walang legal na pahintulot ang Pamahalaang Korea. Pero ano ba ang nagtulak sa amin para yakapin ang ganitong sitwasyon. Ilan sa mga dahilan ay upang makapagtrabaho at makahanap ng isang kompanya at amo na mayroong panggalang sa aming pagkatao. Ang kompanyang maka-pagbibigay sa amin ng isang simple at ligtas na lugar upang kami manatili at irespeto ang karapatan naming bilang manggagawa. Kasama na rin dito ay ang kompanyang magpapasahod sa amin ng naayon sa oras ng aming ipinagtrabaho. At higit sa lahat ay ang kompanyang mamahalin kami bilang tao.  Subalit taliwas at eksepsyunal sa aming paniniwala, karamihan pa rin sa amin ay naabuso at naging biktima ng sistema ng ilang mga ganid na amo. Ang gipit na sitwasyon ang kanilang sinamantala upang mapayaman at paunlarin ang isang maliit nilang negosyo. At dahil nga mura at puwede ang delay na salary namin ay nakasalba ang kanilang kompanya hanggang sa mapabilang sila sa ilang mauunlad na pagawaan dito sa Bansang Korea. At eto pa rin kami patuloy na kumakapit sa patalim at ang karapatan ay tila ibinaoon na lamang sa aming mga puso. Umaasa at patuloy naghihintay ng isang malinaw at deretsahan aksyon ng ating pamahalaan.  urlLink  >>>>>>>>>>more

						   Matagal na rin akong di nakakapagpost dito, paano kasi ay madami akong ginagawa -- mayroon akong dalawang trabaho at pagod na ang isip at bibig ko sa kakasalita sa call center at bugbog naman ako sa trabaho sa fast food. Hay, kailangan ko talaga ng pera para sa unibersidad eh.  Oo nga pala, kailangan ko nalang asikasuhin ang ilan pang dokumento at papeles upang maibigay na sa akin ang student loan na kailangan ko upang may pangbayad na ako sa eskuwela sa darating na setyembre. Natutuwa ako at makakapasok na ako ulit. Sana naman ay maging masaya ang pagpasok ko.  Napag-isipan ko narin ang mga kukunin kong mga subjects at eto ang limang kukunin ko:    Introduction to Japanese   Principles of Economics   Representative Literary Works   Topics in Mathematics   Introduction to Politics    Sana ay makuha ko ang lahat ng subjects na iyan kapag nag-enroll na ako via internet sa Lunes. :)  Sana ay maayos kayong lahat diyan sa Pilipinas. Mag-iingat kayong palagi! :)

      i have here a kurt vonnegut article i took from alternet.org. i love this piece. read on and enjoy! ;)    Cold Turkey  By Kurt Vonnegut, In These Times June 7, 2004   Many years ago, I was so innocent I still considered it possible that we could become the humane and reasonable America so many members of my generation used to dream of. We dreamed of such an America during the Great Depression, when there were no jobs. And then we fought and often died for that dream during the Second World War, when there was no peace.   But I know now that there is not a chance in hell of America's becoming humane and reasonable. Because power corrupts us, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Human beings are chimpanzees who get crazy drunk on power. By saying that our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees, am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East? Their morale, like so many bodies, is already shot to pieces. They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for Christmas.   When you get to my age, if you get to my age, which is 81, and if you have reproduced, you will find yourself asking your own children, who are themselves middle-aged, what life is all about. I have seven kids, four of them adopted.   Many of you reading this are probably the same age as my grandchildren. They, like you, are being royally shafted and lied to by our Baby Boomer corporations and government.   I put my big question about life to my biological son Mark. Mark is a pediatrician, and author of a memoir, The Eden Express. It is about his crackup, straightjacket and padded cell stuff, from which he recovered sufficiently to graduate from Harvard Medical School.   Dr. Vonnegut said this to his doddering old dad: "Father, we are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is." So I pass that on to you. Write it down, and put it in your computer, so you can forget it.   I have to say that's a pretty good sound bite, almost as good as, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." A lot of people think Jesus said that, because it is so much the sort of thing Jesus liked to say. But it was actually said by Confucius, a Chinese philosopher, 500 years before there was that greatest and most humane of human beings, named Jesus Christ.   The Chinese also gave us, via Marco Polo, pasta and the formula for gunpowder. The Chinese were so dumb they only used gunpowder for fireworks. And everybody was so dumb back then that nobody in either hemisphere even knew that there was another one.   But back to people, like Confucius and Jesus and my son the doctor, Mark, who've said how we could behave more humanely, and maybe make the world a less painful place. One of my favorites is Eugene Debs, from Terre Haute in my native state of Indiana. Get a load of this:   Eugene Debs, who died back in 1926, when I was only 4, ran 5 times as the Socialist Party candidate for president, winning 900,000 votes, 6 percent of the popular vote, in 1912, if you can imagine such a ballot. He had this to say while campaigning: As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I'm of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.   Doesn't anything socialistic make you want to throw up? Like great public schools or health insurance for all?   How about Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes?   Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth.  Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. ...  And so on.   Not exactly planks in a Republican platform. Not exactly Donald Rumsfeld or Dick Cheney stuff.   For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that's Moses, not Jesus. I haven't heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, be posted anywhere.   "Blessed are the merciful" in a courtroom? "Blessed are the peacemakers" in the Pentagon? Give me a break!   ----------------------------------------------------- There is a tragic flaw in our precious Constitution, and I don't know what can be done to fix it. This is it: Only nut cases want to be president.  But, when you stop to think about it, only a nut case would want to be a human being, if he or she had a choice. Such treacherous, untrustworthy, lying and greedy animals we are!   I was born a human being in 1922 A.D. What does "A.D." signify? That commemorates an inmate of this lunatic asylum we call Earth who was nailed to a wooden cross by a bunch of other inmates. With him still conscious, they hammered spikes through his wrists and insteps, and into the wood. Then they set the cross upright, so he dangled up there where even the shortest person in the crowd could see him writhing this way and that.   Can you imagine people doing such a thing to a person?   No problem. That's entertainment. Ask the devout Roman Catholic Mel Gibson, who, as an act of piety, has just made a fortune with a movie about how Jesus was tortured. Never mind what Jesus said.   During the reign of King Henry the Eighth, founder of the Church of England, he had a counterfeiter boiled alive in public. Show biz again.   Mel Gibson's next movie should be The Counterfeiter. Box office records will again be broken.   One of the few good things about modern times: If you die horribly on television, you will not have died in vain. You will have entertained us.   ----------------------------------------- And what did the great British historian Edward Gibbon, 1737-1794 A.D., have to say about the human record so far? He said, "History is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind."   The same can be said about this morning's edition of the New York Times.  The French-Algerian writer Albert Camus, who won a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, wrote, "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide."   So there's another barrel of laughs from literature. Camus died in an automobile accident. His dates? 1913-1960 A.D.   Listen. All great literature is about what a bummer it is to be a human being: Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, The Red Badge of Courage, the Iliad and the Odyssey, Crime and Punishment, the Bible and The Charge of the Light Brigade.   But I have to say this in defense of humankind: No matter in what era in history, including the Garden of Eden, everybody just got there. And, except for the Garden of Eden, there were already all these crazy games going on, which could make you act crazy, even if you weren't crazy to begin with. Some of the games that were already going on when you got here were love and hate, liberalism and conservatism, automobiles and credit cards, golf and girls' basketball.   Even crazier than golf, though, is modern American politics, where, thanks to TV and for the convenience of TV, you can only be one of two kinds of human beings, either a liberal or a conservative.   Actually, this same sort of thing happened to the people of England generations ago, and Sir William Gilbert, of the radical team of Gilbert and Sullivan, wrote these words for a song about it back then:   I often think it's comical  How nature always does contrive  That every boy and every gal  That's born into the world alive  Is either a little Liberal  Or else a little Conservative.   Which one are you in this country? It's practically a law of life that you have to be one or the other? If you aren't one or the other, you might as well be a doughnut.   If some of you still haven't decided, I'll make it easy for you.   If you want to take my guns away from me, and you're all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other, and want to give them kitchen appliances at their showers, and you're for the poor, you're a liberal.   If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative.   What could be simpler?   --------------------------------------------------------- My government's got a war on drugs. But get this: The two most widely abused and addictive and destructive of all substances are both perfectly legal.   One, of course, is ethyl alcohol. And President George W. Bush, no less, and by his own admission, was smashed or tiddley-poo or four sheets to the wind a good deal of the time from when he was 16 until he was 41. When he was 41, he says, Jesus appeared to him and made him knock off the sauce, stop gargling nose paint.   Other drunks have seen pink elephants.   And do you know why I think he is so pissed off at Arabs? They invented algebra. Arabs also invented the numbers we use, including a symbol for nothing, which nobody else had ever had before. You think Arabs are dumb? Try doing long division with Roman numerals.   We're spreading democracy, are we? Same way European explorers brought Christianity to the Indians, what we now call "Native Americans."   How ungrateful they were! How ungrateful are the people of Baghdad today.  So let's give another big tax cut to the super-rich. That'll teach bin Laden a lesson he won't soon forget. Hail to the Chief.   That chief and his cohorts have as little to do with Democracy as the Europeans had to do with Christianity. We the people have absolutely no say in whatever they choose to do next. In case you haven't noticed, they've already cleaned out the treasury, passing it out to pals in the war and national security rackets, leaving your generation and the next one with a perfectly enormous debt that you'll be asked to repay.   Nobody let out a peep when they did that to you, because they have disconnected every burglar alarm in the Constitution: The House, the Senate, the Supreme Court, the FBI, the free press (which, having been embedded, has forsaken the First Amendment) and We the People.   About my own history of foreign substance abuse. I've been a coward about heroin and cocaine and LSD and so on, afraid they might put me over the edge. I did smoke a joint of marijuana one time with Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, just to be sociable. It didn't seem to do anything to me, one way or the other, so I never did it again. And by the grace of God, or whatever, I am not an alcoholic, largely a matter of genes. I take a couple of drinks now and then, and will do it again tonight. But two is my limit. No problem.   I am of course notoriously hooked on cigarettes. I keep hoping the things will kill me. A fire at one end and a fool at the other.   But I'll tell you one thing: I once had a high that not even crack cocaine could match. That was when I got my first driver's license! Look out, world, here comes Kurt Vonnegut.   And my car back then, a Studebaker, as I recall, was powered, as are almost all means of transportation and other machinery today, and electric power plants and furnaces, by the most abused and addictive and destructive drugs of all: fossil fuels.   When you got here, even when I got here, the industrialized world was already hopelessly hooked on fossil fuels, and very soon now there won't be any more of those. Cold turkey.   Can I tell you the truth? I mean this isn't like TV news, is it?   Here's what I think the truth is: We are all addicts of fossil fuels in a state of denial, about to face cold turkey.   And like so many addicts about to face cold turkey, our leaders are now committing violent crimes to get what little is left of what we're hooked on.

      pimentel did get the whipping from the public yesterday. i was at the studio getting comments from the anc viewers while he was ranting like mad, and my did we get a lot of calls! and they were pretty nasty calls at that. one caller said, tell everyone at the gallery to get a piece of paper and write "shut up! shut up!" and throw it all at pimentel. then another said, please call security to bodily remove pimentel from the session hall. and yet another: "if i could only ask the heavens to strike lightning on him, i would!" and another: "serve him a poisoned lunch!" the calls were endless, everyone so annoyed at the good senator, i almost felt sorry for him.   but one caller surpisingly said something different: "i admire pimentel for standing up for his beliefs. he is doing a good job! keep it up!" that made me think twice. indeed, why not open the goddamn election returns for christsake, if that's what they want? unless of course the administration is hiding something. it's as if they are giving the opposition all the more reason to rant and rave. pagbigyan nyo na lang please... para matapos na.

      i went over to the college of social work and community development's new building yesterday afternoon to enrol on my women and development classes this sem. and my gosh, it was a virtual fortress! the new red-tiled building beside the center for women's studies is just so huge i was practically lost. and the library, wow. i could unroll a large cot and sleep in the middle undisturbed. the airconditioning left me with chattering teeth. and the student council is the luckiest of all. such a big office! i think a lot bigger than the usc.   the college of masscom's media center at the back dwarfs in comparison. what a pity to the old college. :(

      i'm up to my neck with school work this week. have to submit a paper this afternoon, and have to prepare for an oral report monday. argh. and glenn's been inviting for another get-together this friday. and oops i've got to write 2 articles&nbsp;for sonia's mag! one being, a review of at least 10 wedding movies. have to watch em all! ugh, poison! mapupurga ako.   anyhow, talkin bt acads en all... i love my WD 270 class. despite the gargantuan requirements... it's very stimulating to the mind. atty evalyn ursua is just the best. hear this, i used to be clueless bt gender being a socially constructed word. (how many sems have you been studying women and development girl? tsk, tsk.) but now when&nbsp;i say "gender",&nbsp;i know i'm&nbsp;also talking about&nbsp;power relations. that is,&nbsp;the subordination of women by men. and therefore there's no such thing as "gender equality". not in this world anyway. it's an oxymoron.&nbsp;&nbsp;   does that make sense? i hope.

      i chanced upon this web site while searching for info on the northern mariana islands. (an aside: i'm applying for a post as a reporter in this small boracayesque island or islands.) anyway, the gallery and articles in this site:  urlLink http://www.culturesontheedge.com  are pretty interesting. i love the gallery with its colorful shots. reminds me of national geographic. only better. do check it out. the pieces are very interesting as well. i read this one article on saipan. how sweat shops are out-numbering the golf courses and beautiful resorts. how filipinos and other nationalities from third world countries are migrating to saipan to work as virtual slaves in this u.s. commonwealth. and at a very low wage, poor living conditions and unfair labor practice. i wonder if i'll end up like that. with my passport being kept by my employer, and a hostage to misery. well, jacq and aggie failed to mention any of these things to me. it's either it does not happen to them, or they have learned to live with it. i'm sure it's the latter. they wouldn't have invited me to join them there if that was the case. and this afternoon, i'm going to my interview with the publisher of the Marianas Variety. i don't know what to think. i'll have to see.

      i just had a haircut. feels really good! and i also spent on hot oil. although this hair dresser told me hair spa is better. whatever. it's a lot more expensive, so...   anyway, i hope my hair will stay a-ok forever. or at least till after my interview with the publisher of marianas variety who's coming over to the phils this weekend. i hope i get the job so i can get out of this idiotic country. even for just a year. this place is losing it's appeal. as if there ever was at all. grabe na ito! ang angas! well, just for the record, i really want to go. i hate this place and all the people here. i just want out!!!!  enough. at least it's a good hair day today. and tomorrow, sonia told me we have to meet the publisher of "X for women", this fhm-style magazine i've been contributing to. things are looking up.   i also love my classes at wd. at least i have some diversion. if not, i would have gone mad already. really.

      last week, while i was in class, i got a text message. it says, "happy birthday suyin!" but it wasn't my birthday, and the message doesn't have a name, only the sender's number. which is of course not surprising. i still have lots of numbers to retrieve from my old phone's directory. anyways, i texted back and asked, "cno 2?" and the texter answered back, "ah, so nalimutan mo na ako." oops. then this morning, junn e-mailed me, telling me that rea texted me during her birthday and i didn't even know her number. ouch. i was frantic. i didn't know it was rea! gosh. but i know it was her birthday last july 28. the birthday alarm reminded me. i should really get all my numbers back. i can't keep asking the people texting me for their names. it's just so rude. argh. sorry again rea dear! promise it won't happen again. i'm running off to smart right after work so i can upgrade my sim card and have a bigger directory. ;) fortunately for me, rea is really understanding. thanks!

      my wd 270 class went to a girly bar along quezon avenue. my first time in one. it was absolutely shocking. as early as 10pm, you'd already see naked women. as in naked all the way. my gosh. and they have this floor show at around 11pm where one girl bares it all. her vagina absolutey exposed, feet spread-out and all for a better view. and then there's this other one earlier on who masturbated or at least made it look like she was doing so on stage. in front of all those lecherous men! then a group of naked girls goes up on stage, dances a little then go down to the audience. sit on the customers' lap, etc... then another group, barely clad, and with numbers on them. the customers will choose and they go to their table to entertain them. near the backstage, they have this "aquarium" where a customer can see all the girls neatly lined-up for them to choose. rumor has it that to take-out a girl costs P7,000 each.  i kept looking at this particular girl, she doesn't look like she belongs there. she's too young (well, i guess all of them are), and she's too thin, unlike the others who are more voluptuous. she could pass off as a rich kid. a student. all throughout, i've been thinking, what could have forced them into this kind of work? it's too degrading.
