       *** When I feel low, I feel real low. And when I feel high, I feel so high.    Halloween had been my favorite holiday from the time I was conscious til about two years ago. Two years ago, when I started feelin lonely around the fall season, it was replaced by the warmth, good cheer, and mulled wine of Christmastime. But this year, ladies and germs, Halloween's back on top! #1!   Everyone in the office is being ridiculous and goofy and having a good time. I received lots of compliments on my costume. Most people were like "Ew, gross: Bloody baby!" but a handful, mostly programmers, took one look and were like, "Alright... Kuato!" During the pizza party in the staff room the CEO announced all the winners of the costume contest and I won "Most Disturbing". Before I went up to collect my prize, I performed "The Birth of Kuato" for everyone. This is where George, Kuato's host, faces a wall, makes some orgasmic gasping sounds, then turns around to reveal Kuato. It went well and afterwards all these boys asked for my number...   When people have dogs or babies, it gives people a reason to socialize and interact. This theory apparently also goes for bloody baby parts glued to an old sweatshirt.  I'm feeling spastic and gleeful and outside, it's raining. First rain of the season... that strange fall rain where it's bright, crisp, cold, and showering. Outside this office, the world undulates with possibility.

       *** Downer Downtowners   Well, Abby, I feel your alienation. I was the only person on the 7:07 downtown express in a costume, let alone a costume with bloodied baby parts and hairy chest. The baby is Kuato, leader of the resistance, and I am his host, "George". This is from the movie Total Recall, starring our governor. I was the only one on my BART train too.  At work, it is a completely different experience than at your office, A. There's a voting ballot for best costume, so everyone parades up and down, walking in and out of cubicles, visiting and voting. It feels very neighborhood-like today, with people milling about and smiling and chatting. The only thing missing is alcohol.  About 30 people dressed up, but there's a lot of inter-department decorations with eyeballs and spiderwebs. The people who dressed up REALLY dressed up. Here are some notable co-workers: HULK HOGAN, Cruella de Ville, Bride of Frankenstein, and Nina fuckin Hagen! NINA HAGEN!! Oh my lord, I wish Halloween was everyday. I could almost say that I love my work today, but my supervisor is negating my festive mood by reminding me to fold those invitations for the mailing. She's reminded me three times already. I can only write this because she's upstairs getting her check.   I'll write more later. One more positive thing about this holiday at this douche-y job: pizza lunch!  Hang in there Fidel. It's hard to be a revolutionary-cum-dictator.

       Hallofriday  I'm one of the very few people dressed in a costume today (fidel castro) and it makes me want to stay in my cubicle all day and not come out. Because my cigar broke on the bus and i haven't had a chance to get a new one and someone just mistook my costume for 'a russian'. I'm Fidel, god damn it! Can't you see the Cuban flag on my pocket?? Arg.  Oh, and batty, i'm sorry i missed the seven oh seven. I hit the snooze twice this morning and lagged in a big way. But! I discovered that there is TONS of parking in my hood on weekday mornings. Good to know for next time I sleep over at my imaginary boyfriend's imaginary house and have to drive back home in the morning.   But back to workfools not dressing up when they said they would - WEAKSAUCE!!

       looking at the computer screen all day kills your soul  I'm so hatin' on my job right now. So let's take a break.  Yes, watching the oc last night was, indeed, like one hour orgasm. No man has ever done that for me...or even come close..pun intended. And I can't believe I ate 4 pieces of chocolate. That's more than I have eaten in the past 6 months.  And speaking of candy, my boss sent everyone in my department a bag of halloween candy, so i've been on a sugar high all day. my laffy taffy has 'a joke on every wrapper'...this one says (are you ready?) 'what goes up and down but does not move?' "stairs".....that joke was so bad, i think i better eat some 'sour skittles' just so i don't die of job-hatin'.

       *** Mi Taqueria Amor   Sometimes before Spanish class I duck into El Farolito on 24th & Mission to treat myself to a burrito. (Class is boring. Eating is exciting.) When I lived around there last year, the cashier was this tall 40-something dark-skinned man with a bulbous bumpy nose. He was scruffy and rugged and looked like he loved to live hard. He was always moving and talking at frenetic speeds like he was on drugs. I imagined that on his breaks he'd do blow with the cooks. Lately, though, the cashier has been a tall 30's-ish man whose face reminds me of Dopey Dwarf. He has big child-like saucer eyes, pale skin, and a saintly expression: calm, pleasant, and maybe a little amused. Maybe he was a little amused because the first time I ordered with him I chirped, "Super Sesos Burrito, por favor." (Beef Brains. Not a typical order, I bet.) I enjoy his placid demeanor and he has nice teeth too. He smiles alot. I imagine that afterwork he likes to write poems.

       *** Seth Cohen Is A TV Orgasm   Yesterday night Abby and I watched The O.C. together while munching on bon-bons. We didn't have on fuzzy high heel slippers, but we were both decked out in the bizarre combo of worktop + pajama pants. Are we geniuses or just lazy?  One thing was for sure, we looked really sexy. (And by "sexy", I mean "puzzling".) We squealed at Seth's charm and cuteness, were shocked by Marissa's scheming mother, and I scoffed at Ryan's cuff.  I have problems with Ryan's jewelry/ male adornment. During the first couple episodes, he sported this leather shoestring choker around his thick neck and it looked wrong for his character. Why would a boy from the cuts tie a leather string around his neck? If he was a handsome pretty boy, like aloof Jordan Catalano from My So-Called Life, it would work, but Ryan is too smart to be drawn to prettifying himself! Bad move, costume designer!   Then in this new episode, I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw that the awful choker was gone, but then I saw the leather cuff. I'm sure they're trying to make him hip and relevant to tween trends, but Ryan's too cool for that. Or he's not cool enough. If he wants to look cool and hott, then he should start with a haircut. His hair is so "Ben-from-Growing-Pains" that I'm appalled. Offended, actually.   And that's the news today on Hair, Make-up, and Boys. Byiiieeeeeeee!!!

       ***   My Bruised E-mail Heart   My newfound office friend often travels near and far for the company and lately we’ve started an email correspondence. I wrote to him yesterday morning and it is today afternoon and he still has not replied! My email heart is bruised! My reeling imagination does not help matters much. Here is the email that he has yet to compose:   Dear Batty, Though I enjoyed exchanging emails at first with you, it seems that as I get to know you better, I would like to get to know you less. I do not appreciate disparaging remarks aimed at our co-workers, “Ren-fair hairdo” or not. Despite my tattoos, I am a sensitive man who aches at the hurtful comments you indiscriminately fling at everyone in this office. Have you no mercy? I am scared to open your emails because of what you may write next. I am not concerned with who needs a makeover or who needs to lop off their ponytail or whose manboobs are getting bigger. That is none of my business, nor should it be any of yours. It is apparent that you detest your job, but I love mine. I cannot further associate with you because of the harm it may bring to my position in the company. Computer code encryption gives me boners like nobody’s business, so a word to you my ex-friend: if you can’t swing on the library software automation swing, then get off the swing. You catch my drift? When I come back, let’s pretend we don’t know each other, okay?   Miggidy Mickey    P.S. Give me back my Pee-Wee doll you thief.

       *** A Tale of Superheroics   Sometimes in life, we perform amazing feats and these amazing feats go unheralded because we are not friends with the proper scribes or historians who will document these occurences. Sometimes in life we must puff up our own chests and bray like mad donkeys and document our own histories. This is one woman's story. (Mine.)  Yesterday when Abby and I were driving back from chowing down on Ethiopian food, I smelled something weird in the car, like burning rubber, so I said, "Do you smell that? It smells like burnt rubber or like someone's brakes are on." I looked over and on her dashboard I saw the "BRAKE" light illuminated so I said, "Oh,  your  brakes are on" and cool as a cucumber I released her emergency brake which was still erect like a penis between us.   Ladies and gentlemen, that is my humble tale... I congratulate myself on my keen olfactory sense unrivaled by any other superhero, except, perhaps, Superdog.

       escape  i'm planning to sneak out of here 2 hours early today. i'm kinda sickly looking and have been sniffling and coughing all day, so i think it will be pretty easy. here's the tough part - i've been drinking tea like a racehorse for the past 6 hours and when i have to go pee, it's no longer that soft nudge in my belly suggesting i take a bathroom break, it's more like a one-two punch in the stomach that forces me to stop mid-sentense and sprint to the peeroom. so i'm just thinking - what if that happens on the bus ride home? the ride is really long and i don't want to have an accident in front of all the nice muni passengers, you know? i could, alternatively, stop drinking and wait for it all to come out in the safety of my office and  then  go home. but you see that would be missing the whole point.

       ***  There are three things on my mind this Monday morning:  1. Corporations. I work for one. This is my first corporate job and I have many qualms with my occupation, but what I've been pondering lately is this: how is it that I've worked here for one whole year, and just recently I've become friends with someone truly awesome who's only two cubes away? Where was he for the last twelve arduous months?  I think it's that I have hipster anxiety. I can talk to anyone except really cool-looking people. I assume that they think they're better than me or too cool to talk to me. Which, in the throes of my brand-spanking-new friendship, is completely untrue. I think he's just shy so I assumed he was a snob. I'm really shy too so I'm sure he thought I was the same. It all boils down to why I hate corporations: you never really get to know the people you work with. Not like a small business anyway. I miss getting to know people really well and really liking someone and really hating someone.   2. Getting old. Yesterday, Sunday, I drove with my mom to visit three people: my dad, my aunt, and gramma-and-grampa. My dad is officially in a nursing home now. I hadn't seen him since he was transferred and he is skinnier and has random cuts and scabs over his body. He was wearing a diaper and wasn't wearing his bottom denture so his lip was sunken in like an old man. Though my mom cooed and clucked over him, I didn't feel pity. Something else that's been on my mind lately is how I would like to be unborn. How I would like to age backwards and essentially return to the womb, helpless and dependent, fetus, embryo, then nothing. I think that idea is actually what life is. Seeing my dad in an infantile state further convinced me of the cycle. You return to nothingness, but instead of reverting backwards, and reliving exuberance and happiness, you must progress forward through pain and loss of strength, both physical and mental. You become enfeebled, but instead of being surrounded by happy faces and people eager to caress your hands and cheeks, you're surrounded by tired nurses and resentful family that visits only on occasion. That is what you must endure to return to the nothingness.    My aunt has cancer and gramma-and-grampa are hooked up to feeding tubes. The grandparents haven't spoken for years. My grandma had this huge blackhead on her cheek and my mom picked it out. In Vietnamese they called it "chung ca" which literally translates to "fish's egg". If I was given the honor to name a blackhead in Vietnamese I'd call it "cut ca" which would literally translate to "fish's fece", because that's what it fuckin looked like. I'd be fuckin pissed off if I was fuckin 90-something years old and I was still getting pimples.  3. Depression. I told my mom I was depressed and that I was starting therapy next week. I didn't tell her before, because she's got enough troubles with my dad, aunt, and grandparents and all, not to mention her own ailments. She was very concerned and told me that I should come over for dinner more often and that she would do anything to help. I said I'd be okay and that the doctor will probably just prescribe me some meds then I'd return to normalcy. But, really, I don't need pills. I just need a new job that makes me feel needed. I'm not needed here because any monkey can pass out pens and post-its. I need to work for someone who needs  this  monkey. Preferably someone with an afro.

       icky monday  it's monday and i'm feeling shitty -- caught a cold over the weekend. sneeze!. at the moment overdosing on chamomile tea in hopes that it will go away by this afternoon. other than getting sick, had a great weekend driving around and seeing friends and family. went to SFMOMA yesterday to see the diane arbus exhibit, which was fantastic. the lame part was trying to squeeze by all those last minute chagall viewers. after a while, jb and i started making up words and using chagall in new and exciting ways - i.e. 'all these art assholes are making me chagalled'. 'get out of my way before i chagall your ass'..it was fun.   oh! and it's my half birthday today. woo hoo! 25.5. will celebrate by purchasing fabric at britex and trying to catch up with the rest of my sewing class. if sucessful, will treat self to ethiopian food. if unsucessful, will treat self to ethiopian food.

       *** If I Had My Way   I would have a long stretchy periscope that would go up the stairs, turn right, go down an aisle, turn left, and kind of hover discreetly above XX's cube. I want to know what's going on! I NEED to know what's going on. For instance, what is he wearing today? Is he wearing his glasses? Another device I would be equally happy with is a spycam attached to a tiny helicopter the size of a fly... Wait, he's here... He just walked by. He is wearing a yellow shirt and his glasses. Humph... I guess instead of electronic gadgetry I can just use my humanoid eyeballs. They will do for now... until I get my X-ray specs in the mail.

       Pardon the Run-On Sentence  This is how I will remember being 25 when I'm a little old lady with white hair and a bitchin' brooch collection - dancing my ass off at a Bottom of the Hill show with Batty and Willo and Rick, driving home afterwards with two new pins added to my collection (it's always the cheapest thing on the merch table and we  have  to buy something), disecting the show on the drive with Bats to the tiniest detail (Why  did  he have that rather prominent double chin yet twig-like legs?), opening the door to my room and jumping from carpet island to carpet island, trying to avoid stepping on all the clothes and cd's and books and magazines that cover the floor, taking off my pants and bra in 2.5 seconds and while I laugh remembering something Batty said earlier...sleep..

       ***   the cooler's runnin dry as a pimp   Yesterday as we were gearin up for the Mando Diao (pron. Dee-OW) show, Abby said that she looked online at the lyrics and that there were some that were a bit odd. What was odder was the unofficial "Who Wants to be Abby's Husband Contest" at the show. During M-Diao's set there was this one smashed fellow in a brown leather jacket who jumped right in front of Abby ("the husband arena") and did some wild uncontrollable dancing. He did this move I dubbed "The Geyser" where he would crouch down low low during the verse and when the chorus kicked in, he would jump up to full height, fist shooting up in the air.   Once he danced out of the space in front of Abby, a second contestant entered. This one was a young geeky jock, all peach fuzz and XXL tee. I think there was a baseball cap involved too. He grinned ridiculously and flailed his lanky limbs. Abby couldn't decide which to choose so I chose for her: Bachelor #1 for "The Geyser" because everytime she says "Yeah!" or "Alright!" he will do "The Geyser" to punctuate her enthusiasm. In fact, they can do it together. In fact, I may even join them every once in a while. Yeah!

Another show, another sleepless night - will force self to drink caffeinated tea tomorrow (gasp!)  Before the show, I have to take my former neighbor Esther shopping. This Thursday, in addition to deep frying turkey, she's also making collard greens, sweet potato pie, corn bread and the best stuffing on this side of the Mississippi. Better be on her good side.

       *** Blog of Mortification   I feel as if I tirelessly go on and on about XX. It is time to stop the madness because it only exists in my head and I should stop nurturing it and feeding it with scraps of libido and imagination. I am changing my ways! From now on I will use this blog to document moments of mortification. Those are what make us human, what make us real. Well,  I  feel really real anyway... because  I  have to deal with the consequential and guaranteed embarrassment...   Yesterday as I was trying to catch the elevator for myself I stuck my arm between the closing doors. Usually the doors bounce off, right? Wrong! Those dumb doors crushed my flimsy measly arm and kept going. They wanted to close all the way. This arm was no obstacle to their destructive path of closure.  I felt like a muppet with my arm stuck in an elevator, jumping and wiggling around frantically.  Except I was no muppet. Unfortunately, I was me, and unfortunately there was another person in the lobby who witnessed this tawdry spectacle.

       Only a Week Away!  I just noticed the expiration date on the carton of half & half at work - December 4th, the date of my brother's birthday. I should get him something this year, now that we're friends. I know this because he doesn't make puking noises when I hug him good-bye anymore. I think he has fogiven me for that razor blade accident 13 years ago and I have forgiven him for being 20 months younger, which for some time meant that I had to cook and do dishes while he played video games.    G & I had virtually the same experience growing up, down to our ceremonious induction into the communist party and our obsession with the World Wrestling Federation, but have turned out quiet differently. While he has the ability to hold calm conversations with my father about his Future, I throw my hands up after 15 seconds and storm out of the house. While he can tell you 25 reasons why Shakespeare is the most brilliant writer in history, I am often bored by things I have to struggle to understand. So while mom & dad party it up russian style on Thanksgiving this Thursday, G & I will be sharing Stove Top and working on his article for the paper. He told me to not expect to have any fun.

       Sunday   I went to a memorial service yesterday for Genny's mom who passed away a few weeks ago. I never had the pleasure of meeting Michelle, but judging by the photographs scattered around the room and from all the things that people said, I'm sure she was just as funny, effervescent and lovely as Genny, who is one of the most amazing people I have ever met.  The drive to the delta, where it took place, took almost two hours each way and by the time we got back to the city, the sun was setting and it was too late to do anything outside. M went home to take a nap and I went to Marcus' to pick up the keys to his apartment, which I'm housesitting while he goes east for the holiday. Visiting Marcus is never as simple as picking up keys. Once I'm in, I better have a few hours to spare because he sure likes to chat. Marcus is an advice-dispensing machine (in a good way) and I'm a sponge that sits on the kitchen chair with my feet folded under me, trying to absorb everything he says and coming up with something half as clever in return, which is tough. He doesn't have any plants or pets, but insisted that I experience San Francisco from his apartment, which is perched on top of a hill next to Coit Tower. I told him that I'll try to enjoy the view from the kitchen window, which overlooks the bay. So this means that I can walk to my temporary home from work today.   Batty, you HAVE to visit this place. BTW, I didn't see you on the seven oh seven. I even looked back to see if you're running for the bus, but you weren't. Unless you morphed into that pudgy russian woman, in which case we did, in fact, ride the bus together this morning.

      ***  There was a reason for my non-post on Friday. Though XX moved to a higher plane of existence, the 2nd floor, we emailed back and forth jokes and barbs throughout the day. You know what this means, right? Wedding bells. Ding dong, ding dong. I'll even invite my boyfriend. He can be my maid of honor.  On Sunday was my friend Alli G.'s birthday and she hosted a shrine-making party. Scattered throughout the floor of her living room were organized messes of beads, baubles, tchotchkes, trinkets, glitter, gems, trim, paints, brushes, and glues and adhesives. Of course, our favorite cancer-causing glue was present: the E6000. I was in heaven. Whether it was the toxic fumes in an enclosed area, or whether I was feeling a more organic euphoria, I do not care.   She gave each of us a mini plywood armoire to decorate, and it was fun. She is very much into Mexican folk-art, so all of our shrines had a Dia de los Muertos feel to them. I glued on the card of "El Corazon" to my door but inside I put up a picture of a pin-up girl. I painted the inside of my box to look like her girly boudoir of pink seduction. I was pleased because ever since I lost my nudie pen I've been kind of bereft. I didn't know what else I could bring in to work to combat the general blahness of working in a grey cube and doing grey work. My new lady will do just fine. But something was missing: she wasn't saucy enough for me. I opened and closed the door. She was not turning me on. As a final touch I decided to squeeze some red glitter glue onto her faint nipples. There! It was perfect. Titallatingly scandalous, pun intended.

I don't know what to do about rent and feeding the kids, but to take my mind off things, I will focus on the aberration that is Luke of The Sleepy Jackson. He is the strangest, oddest looking fellow I have ever chanced to see. Boyfriend 2 was the ugliest, Luke was the strangest and oddest...  When he took the stage, the first name that popped into my head was "Porky Von Baron". He had a porcine quality because of his dark beady eyes, his piggish nose, and his sausage-like limbs. The more Abby and I tried to compare him to someone or something, more animals than humans came up: pig, lion, seal, walrus, otter. He had a jet-black blown-out lion's mane that recalled early Prince or present-day Michael Jackson: sleek, yet dry and crispy; straight, yet strangely curled at the ends. I imagine that this effect is achieved nightly by a curling iron he drags through each lock to straighten, then rolls in slightly at the end to curl. He holds this iron with his gigantic hands. He also has an enormous head that seems inhumanly gargantuan by his necklessness. Abby pointed out this trait several times, and it was true: he had no neck. It was head, torso. Head... torso. "No pedastal needed, the head will rest just fine on top of the torso, thank you."  His inky hair starkly contrasted with his chalk-white skin. On this ghostly face were black black eyebrows and a black moustache that I presume he buys special dyes for. But not only was he physically bizarre looking, he was strangely styled too. Hence the David Gest comparisons. He wore a huge blazer that only accentuated his huge, broad shoulders and drew attention to his necklessness. Around where his neck would be he tied a delicate lacy scarf in a Euro-male fashion.   Some reactions from Abby & myself: - Is that Meat Loaf? - Is that David Gest? - He looks like Prince's strange-looking cousin. - He looks like Jennifer Tilly crossed with a walrus. - He looks like a lion. - He looks like a pig crossed with Michael Jackson. - Is he Maori? Who are the aboriginal peoples of Australia? - I've already gone out with the ugliest person ever, might as well ask  this  guy out.

       ***   I am going to stab myself in the chest. With a key. In fact, I'm doing it right now as I'm typing with one hand, the other stabbing repeatedly, but very lightly so as not to inflict pain or damage. Why the melodrama? XX has been relocated to the 2nd floor! Are you as outraged as I? I shed a tear in the shape of a key. You know what a floor relocation means? The DEATH of ROMANCE. The DEATH of OFFICE ROMANCE!!! In my hysteria, I thought I just saw someone walk by wearing a cowboy hat. I quickly turned my head and realized that I am hysterically insane now: dude was actually wearing a khaki baseball cap. Is this the manifestation of my grief? That I think I see everyone in cowhand duds? How do I live?? LeAnn Rimes, tell me, how do I live?

       Fact 2 - at the Sleepy Jackson/Polyphonic Spree show last night:  Batty: He (lead singer) is the weirdest-looking person I have ever seen! And the guitarist on the left looks like Kenny G. Abby: Kenny G dressed by Axl Rose. And the lead singer looks like he was dressed by Liza Minelli. Batty: No, he looks like he was dressed by David Gest! Abby: (laughter ensues)  Later on the drive home: Batty: I think I will be him for Halloween next year. Abby: YES! You can be him and I will be David Gest!

       Order of Things  I sat alone in the corner booth and sipped wine while he took photographs upstsairs. The wait staff fussed over me and I thought to myself 'Hm. I could definitely get used to this.' I'm smart enough to know that it's all smoke and mirrors. I'm stupid enough to keep doing it. I told him last night that our budding, slightly awkward physical relationship will kill our frienship and he kissed me on the forehead and asked 'So you just want to be friends then?' ... good point. I have NO IDEA what the hell I want. I want someone else to make the decision for me, actually. Maybe Batty? Or Dr. E, whom I'm seeing tomorrow. A few days after my last meeting with her, I wrote down everything that I wanted to discuss next time. But none of those issues are on my mind anymore so maybe we can concentrate on this rather than the usual, overrated parents/career talk.  And Batty, while you dated the ugliest person in the world for two years, I dated the meanest for 5, which is infinitely worse...live and learn.

       ***    Yesterday I talked to my cousin and I implored her to devise a mental exercise to get my mind off of XX. (She used to work with me so she knows who he is.) She said, "Well, think about how he's fat and hairy." Check and check. He is fat. He is indeed hairy. She told me to think about how hairy guys smell because the hair traps in the stink and I agreed with her apt assessment, because it is true. But the difference between me and my cousin is that I don't care about looks. I once dated the ugliest guy I'd ever laid eyes upon. My rose-colored lenses are of a real strong prescription...  His name was Doofus Duck and he had the most jacked-up set of choppers I'd ever seen in my entire life. There was no order to the alignment of his teeth. If his teeth were a government, they would be anarchy; if his teeth were a Greek god, they would be Chaos; if his teeth were one of the seven endless, they would be Despair. They were disgusting and disturbing because not only were they beyond crooked, there was a hardened layer of green that lined his gums from his chain-smoking and non-teeth brushing. The balls of his feet were so bulbous and meaty that his toes didn't touch the ground. They couldn't. They were curled up and nestled in their high nook above the floor.  In retrospect, I shudder, but at the time I loved this freak and I would still be with him if he wasn't a liar, a thief, and no darn good. And, he didn't know how to shut the fuck up.   I thought that someone of this ugly calibre could only be wonderful and wholesome and like fresh-baked bread, but he was ugly, inside and out. He was a stale moldy heel. And I was with him for two years.

       ***   When XX gave me a ride across the bridge I couldn't help but feel a little sad about it. I knew that Dizzy D could never do such a thing for me. (He doesn't know how to drive.) It is such a treat to ride home with someone you like very much while seeing downtown SF from such a great view. It made me feel alive again to see the setting sun, the sparkling water below us, the ferry building with its clock, the pyramid, and all the marvelous skyscrapers downtown. These things aren't new to me, but somehow they seemed more beautiful -yet so familiar- that day. I'm accustomed to riding on BART by myself, sitting next to a stranger, and looking at and reflecting weary expressions. From the last East Bay stop to the first SF stop, I don't say a word during the long pitch black ride. That sole excursion with XX lingers in my mind because of the achingly beautiful scenery, the effortless conversation, his company, and all the smiling and laughing.

       ***   Yesterday Abby and I saw a movie "Anything But Love." It was recommended to me by my movie buff co-worker, Gargyle, and it was... ok. It was worth my time because the kissing scenes were so... terrible. I was amused by the way they made me uncomfortable and squirmy. The kissing was awkward and passionless. There were no squeaky suction-y kissing noises. No sweet puckering of luscious lippies. The first kiss was a chaste press of the lips between the guy and the gal. It was like they were co-worker and co-worker, priest and nun, or... my mom and my dad. Boring! I can see that shit for free at home.  Then there is a kiss at the end with the gal kissing Andrew McCarthy. I laughed because I was embarrassed. As she closes her eyes and goes in for the liplock, Andrew McCarthy coyly pulls away before he indulges his passion. That is so GAY!!! Andrew McCarthy, you are so gay!!! Why the hesitation? She is clearly better-looking, better-dressed, and a better kisser than you! I don't understand! That is such a metrosexual move! I am exacerbated by the fact that he was trying to be all sexy, but he has a weak chin and that unblinking googly stare! He is no matinee idol, but a pasty nerdling with an overbite. Andrew, know thy station!! He pulled away, as if he had other options and was reconsidering. That is unbelievable and so, so, gut-stabbingly, gas-inducingly gay. So I laughed, but really, I wanted to cry it was so gay.

       ***  Pictures are on my mind today.   1.  Pictures.  Pictures of myself make me cringe and they deflate my self-esteem. Today I looked at some pictures from my cousin's wedding and I look like a gothic clown. My bangs are black, stringy, and in my eyes and I'm wearing all dark clothes except this incongruously bright pink and white vinyl flower pin attached to my sweater. It looks like a cheap clown ploy, like it will squirt water at any minute -- black, inky, gothic water. I would be very happy if instead of my image being represented by this horrific monstrous strangely-dressed woman, I had a "Prince" symbol. He's not using it anymore because he's going by his name, so I figure it can crop up in pictures to represent something new, namely, me.  2.  The banana picture.  On Friday, I was in a weird silly mood so I just marched over and stuck it on his cube wall. He seemed pretty jazzed about it and he didn't kick me out or stab me or stomp me into the ground. He did not spit in my face or slap me either. He actually took it and hung it in a more prominent position: on his banana tree. That sounds kind of perverse, but it is one of those kitchen apparatuses that you use to hang your bananas on. It is a base, a shaft of curved wood, and at the tip is a hook where you hang your vagina, er, bananas. It is very Ron Popeil-esque. Why he has it on his desk is not a mystery to me, but a profound head-and-heart-spinning wonder. If I didn't hate being in this office so much, the sight of a banana tree on a desk would make me giggle. So now when I pass by and see my drawing displayed so openly, I feel a tinge of glee and pride to see a part of me accepted into his cube, his office-life. That is 40 hours of the week. That is 40 hours a week that he gets to gaze upon my most righteous depiction of a bunch of bananas.

       Ak!  I almost initiated the Talk on Friday, but what came out of my mouth instead was "Have you ever done e?" (stupid!!)...and then we made out some more and I fell asleep. I have ruined my chances with M2 and now that I'm deciding to end my psudo-something with M1, I'll be flying solo again. But that's just fine.   In other news, went for a six mile hike yesterday in Muir Woods with M1 and Genny and Alex and now my ass cheeks feel like ground chuck. It was worth it for the most incredible view I have ever seen and getting out of the city for a day.

       ****  The girl who sat next to me on the bus spoke russian to her brother on the cell phone. I should have minded my own business, but she was really loud and I couldn't help but overhear. She had a Moscow accent, but it turned out she is from the same town that I'm from, a small urban hub in the middle of rural ukraine. I kept hoping she would mention some of the places I remember, but of course she didn't. Instead I found out that her family still lives there and that her brother desperately wants her to move back. Their father remarried and had eight children with his new wife and now can't support them. The girl kept telling her brother (Nikita) that she can't move back because she won't be able to find work and agreed to send money in two weeks. I know things have changed in 15 years, but the picture in my mind is fixed - the marble statue of lenin, the flower booth on the far end of the town square, the bakery with the giant chimneys.

       ***   Sing Me a Song to Set Me Free   Today I spent 4 hours in the file room, making up for my month of slacking. I don't do stiches in time: I wait until I'm about to get fired, then I do nine. Then I burn out. Then I slump down and fantasize about XX coming into the file room and we turn off the flourescent lights and kiss in the dark between the rows of file cabinets...  In reality, we haven't interacted once today. Every evening I cross my fingers that he'll come up to me and offer me another ride home like he did last last Monday. And everyday I lock the door, and turn off the lights, and leave the office by myself.    God, this is so emo, I'm going to stab myself in the chest.

       Like Being Reborn  My doctor diagnosed me with post-viral-inflamatory-something-disease. She gave me a huge bottle of codeine to help me sleep ("Take only 1 teaspoon. If you take 2, you will sleep for 24 hours. That happened to my mother once. Tee hee.") and an inhaler and told me not to speak for a few days. Batty pointed out that I can finally relive middle school years, complete with glasses, retainer  and  inhaler. And this time I speak the english! Instead of taking the codeine, I cuddled it and my sleep and you know what..it worked. I have a positive mental attitude and willingness to take on new and exciting challenges. Yarf.

       ***   I'm putting my banana into the drawer.   Literally. Figuratively. Sexual Innuendo-ly. I drew XX this cute bunch of bananas to hang in his cubicle, but Monday I was too chickenshh to put it on his desk. Tuesday, he ignored me. Wednesday, wait, today is Wednesday. Wednesday is too late. The bananas have gone bad, so they're going into the bottom of my drawer. I pictured coming by his cubicle to give it to him but in my mind he goes, "What the hell? Fuck you!" as he crumples it into a ball and throws it at my head, where it bounces off and hits the ground nearby. He angrily swivels back to look at his computer as I burst into tears and run back to my desk where I will hide underneath it for the remainder of the day. I cannot show my face. Sneers, jeers, and mocking laughter come from his department. The world becomes hideous so I quit my job and become a wandering vagrant. I smell like poo and old underwear and sometimes I turn tricks so I can feed myself. I don't have teeth either, just a sunken, weather-beaten mien. It is a godless existence...   So... it's good that I'm keeping the bananas.

He looked at the book I was reading and said he owned it and had been meaning to read it. He asked how it was and I said voice, tone, style. Then it was over. I think I'm in love with him again. In honor of my renewed vows of crushiness, I will slack off. Or jack off.

       ***   Sometimes in a blog you just have to shoot the poo! There is no reason for this entry, save reluctance to work! So, XX is actually here today despite having worked the graveyard shift last night. Abby and I were talking about how in a corporate setting, there is probably a euphemism for "graveyard shift" for instance "Supplemental Shift" or "Supporting Shift." I think that XX suffers because he sees it as "Bootsy-honkin-fuckass-shift-with-absence-of-Batty's-graces-so-why-go-on-let-alone-provide-tech-support Shift."   Poor XX. Nestle your head in mummy's bosom. There there, shhhh... There there, don't cry... Batty's here... Just relax... Doesn't that feel better now that your belt is undone?  Shhh... shhhh... I'm only unbuttoning your pants... shhh... shhh... I'm not that heavy, what are you talking about... shhh... oh yeah, oh god yes... shhh... now don't look at the monitor, look at me... see, now, doesn't that feel good? ... uh, yeah, uh, uh.... let me just, ah, minimize your applications and activate your screensaver... ahh, a galaxy of  stars... now just sit back and shhhhhh...

       Show  Last night's Fruit Bats show rocked hard, in a sweet, hippie, folky sort of way. It was pretty empty at Bottom of the Hill, which was unfortunate for the bands but fortunate for me, as I scored myself a stool and rocked out whilst sitting comfortably and sipping water. I also talked to Bart Davenport, babydaddy candidate #2 (after Adam Green). He shook my hand and hugged me, which caught me a bit off guard. I was hoping he would do the creepy soul-searching stare into my eyes like he does on stage, but that didn't happen. Anyway, I'm pregnant with his twins.

       God Bless America  Saturday marked 15 years since my family moved here. Celebrating the occasion at Olive Garden like we do all others would have been ludicrous, so instead, I agreed to look at the condominium with my mom and G-brother and Leisure-Suit Larry (as we call the real-estate agent due to his uncanny resemblance to a character from a video game G & I played as kids).  After 30 minutes of driving, we finally got to Fern Valley something or other estates. The condo was exactly as I pictured - woodsy surroundings that could pass for college dorms, a loud freeway across the street, ugly architecture all around. I felt sick the whole time due to a lingering cold and wanted to go home, but Leisure Suit just kept going on and on about the tennis courts (don't care), swimming pool (don't care), club house (don't want to play billiards with geriatrics). We ran from building to building trying to escape the pouring rain. As I caughed and wheezed, G & I made jokes about the fact that I am frail and sickly and will most likely die soon. My mother stared at us in horror. I stuck my tongue out at her when Leisure Suit wasn't looking, signaling that I was ready to go. G kept pointing to old men with beer bellies and nudging me to meet my 'future neighbors and possible husbands'.  We ended up looking at a studio - the person selling it was still living there, although she wasn't home when we came by, and while Leisure Suit blabbered on about marble countertops and high ceilings, I checked out her shoe collection (mine is better) and at least 30 family photos. It was a drawn-out affair. We waited under the cover of the garage while Leisure Suit fetched the car and then drove us back. I never have to hear about this condo again and for that reason it was almost worth it. That and making fun of the place with G. I think I'm finally friends with my brother.

       ***   Doing Dishes Makes Me So Mad!   I have no patience for domestic maintenance. I do not like doing dishes, vacuuming, cleaning, or laundry. I don't like taking out the trash either. These tasks are unrewarding and do not end in orgasms, brain or vaginal. Yesterday night I again tackled the insurmountable duty of doing dishes because earlier in the day Dizzy D faux-casually asked, "So when are you going to finish doing the dishes?" (I've been chipping away at the mountain for a few weeks now.) I glared at him and declared it was a work-in-progress. I don't eat at home, so they're all his dirty diddies anyway. And they keep piling on! They don't stop accumulating!! I am going postal, but worse: I'm going "kitchen-al"!!!   After one load, I was impatient and frustrated at how little I'd actually finished compared to the remaining dishes that I decided that it was time to start taking shots. I drank two shots of vermouth, turned up the music, and tried to boogie away my woes. I finished another load and sighed at the sight of the Sisyphean task ahead of me. The vermouth wasn't enough. I took off the rubber gloves and lay down, defeated. I could not finish. And the sad thing is that the next time I muster up the courage to tackle the dishes again, there will be so many added that it'll be like I didn't even do any at all.   Also, one complaint. One domestic squabble. One glimpse into my private life. When Dizzy D cooks, he likes to eat -as he calls it- "Chinese style" in that he will serve and present all dinner items in separate bowls and dishes. Even when he eats alone. There will be a small bowl for the kimchee, and a tiny bowl for the soy sauce, and a bowl for the vegetables, and a bowl for the rice, and a bowl for the meat. And the bowl from which he eats. That's six bowls! For one person! Why doesn't he just get all his food straight from the pot/jar and put it into his bowl? Why the middlemen? Why the bowls in-between?* This, THIS, is the source of my angst river, ladies and gentlemen. And I can take it no more.   *(I have asked him these questions and he gave some answer along the lines of, "But, it's Chinese-style!" Ugh. One day I will convert him to the highly efficient way of "Batty Trough Style.")

       *** I love you... I honestly love you.   Ok, I am inventing a mental exercise. I call it "crush transferrance." No longer will I pester and harrass my co-worker. Because seriously, I am embarrassing myself. My co-worker doesn't do awesomely dork-wonderful dances and have retardo hand movements like Adam Green. He doesn't sing songs about Jessica Simpson like Adam does. He doesn't talk about how he never goes out without his Barnes & Noble card either.  How can he be my officebabydaddy if he says things like "firewall" and "computer parts"? This will not do. No, not at all. I'm in love with someone else now.

       ***  Adam is the coolest person in the world only because he is the biggest dork and doesn't care. Everyone, embrace your inner dork and just be. Just BE, man. Who cares that you don't work out and you're pale and pasty? Dance, Dance! People are cool when they release their demons of self-consciousness and just are who they are.   I once met this guy named Forest and my friend Gina and I hung out in his cramped studio before a show. On the way to his house, we passed by a Thai restaurant and he told us to look at this picture in the window. He said it was the coolest thing, and it was: the picture was a candid unflattering photo of Keanu Reeves eating dinner there. When we got to his apartment he gave us beer and was really excited to show us all his new rubber stamps that just arrived in the mail. Then he played us all these cool songs from his record collection. Scattered around his studio were all these random kitchen utensils, because he was attending the culinary institute. I asked about that and he told us about how he once rang his neighbor's doorbell to try to give them 2 lbs of cookies he'd baked in class.   When I feel weird and odd among the squares and bores in my office, I think of this grown man's impressive array of funny rubber stamps ("Look, it's a gun!") and I feel alright. I feel okay. Life isn't bad and I even laugh a little... on the inside.

He is amazing live - the cardiac-arrest-like full body gyrations, the retarded-esque hand waving, the bored and depressed look on his face that seems to say 'i hate you all' equal to 'cream-in-your-jeans' hot!. Batty and I danced right next to the stage and screamed "i love you" and "be my babydaddy" to him. Ok, the second one I screamed in my head, but whatever.   It's friday, halleluja. Today batty & I are off to see Ladybug Transistor...Only have one of their songs, but my friend compared them to magnetic fields and that's all I really need to become an obsessed freak of a fan.  And check this! => all the directors are at some retreat, so we're having a happy hour in the office. They're bringing in kegs and food and maybe music. This friday won't be as cool as last week, but free breakfast and beer in the afternoon ain't bad.

       ***   WPC   You're so shy and unassuming and with every blink I want to die... the mere turn of your head syncopates my pulse... If I can't do mundane things with you, I don't know what I'll do at all.  My life, my death, my love, my fate... I recognize myself in the loping bass notes from your mouth like an inverse black hole everything I've ever wanted to know comes out like stars but slow and with time... and when I seal your mouth with mine,  I swallow down what you are, and Fireworks go off inside me, beautiful and contained.

       ***   Tame Thy Libido, Self!   In an exercise to be less lustful, and more innocent, cute, and harmless, I resolve to write about innocuous funny interactions that occur within my office. In the office there is this one guy -let's call him Alan- that I don't talk to that much, except twice. Both times, he was funny. Here's what made me chuckle:  1. Before I enter a cube to distribute supplies, I whisper, "Knock, Knock...." Before I entered Alan's cube, I said "Knock, Knock" and he whispered back, "Who's there?"   2. I'm filling my cup with water in the kitchen and he's trying to use the espresso machine. Clouds of steam and screechy whistling noises are coming from it. I deadpan, "It's going to explode" and without missing a beat, he says back, "...or rocket to the moon!"

       erase and rewind  i called him just to ask whether i should bring red wine or white to his chicken dinner which i am actually cooking. i know perfectly well that he is just as illiterate as i am when it comes to things of this nature.  so i don't know why i wasted my precious phone minutes on that conversation, but there you have it. i guess i just wanted to say hello. i really don't have a master plan for this like i do for everything else in my life (such is the nature of the slightly obsessive compulsive and highly neurotic)...just seeing what will happen. probably nothing since my window of opportunity passed about a year and a half ago when we stayed up all night smoking cigarettes in his bed and then went to tahoe at 5 in the morning, sleep-deprived and sickly. nothing happened - i didn't think it was a good idea. but than was then and this is now.

       *** Fucking around   XX is here and in full effect. I am cool and composed though. I did not pick up everything on my desk and put it down, like last time. I didn't look wildly about in a confused retarded manner. He showed me his new shoes, so I showed him my boobies. He had a fucking hard-on so we went to his cube and fucked like bunnies in front of all his co-workers. Right before he came, he got so into it that he even paused to turned off his monitor. He's in love with me now.  Abby, that last entry was fucking beautiful. I am in awe of you.

       weekend recovery begins now  wondering if a certain eks eks is there today, making my dearest friend blush and fidget and move things around her desk nervously in hopes that all the clanging and banging will distract from the sound of her stomach gurgling...  yesterday was a day of visiting and driving and worrying and eating...listening to wise advice from former neighbor/surrogate gramma/toughest woman i have ever met...visiting old roommates just to sit around on the wooden floor and talk about nothing for 45 minutes, just because i miss the roommates and the wooden floor...visiting gramma, but only until she asks me to put on lipstick and grow my hair out long. that's my cue to leave...then on to my uber-hip lady friend's house, where i pick up her unwanted clothes and knick-knacks, which are scattered in my room right now, giving off a slight incense smell that reminds me of high school sleepovers and trying pot sophomore year. finally visiting my parents. over tea, my father hovers over me telling me why i should agree to move to san bruno, into a condo that he will help me buy. i don't want a condo. i don't want to live in san bruno. i leave when they ask me when i'm getting married and cry on the way home, upset at the fact that no matter how much i accomplish, there will always be something that they will nag and pressure me about. what happened to just being happy and supportive? if my mom wanted a drone whose life revolved around getting married and buying condos, she shouldn't have had those abortions - maybe one of them could've provided her with that crap. not me.  oh. i'm getting emo. time to stop.

       *** Fantasy = Reality, Reality = Fantasy    This posting is rated XX.   On Saturday night, XX picked me up and we went to a show at Gilman. Sure there were a lot of mange-y stanky underage punks, but the music was real good. There was a band called the (No) Apologies Project that is that punchy NYC art-funk-punk that I like. They all dressed in black with matching white belts and shouted out lyrics like, "Hey you've got the look!/ But have you read a book?" I was creaming my pants. I bought their CD, and I glued it into my stereo. I will never listen to anything else ever again.  After the show, I invited XX into my room under the guise of watching a Radiohead video, but we never got around to that. We hung out by my heater and listened to CDs. Here's the soundtrack to our platonic hanging out: (No) Apologies Project, Edith Piaf, Ministry, and The Beatles White Album. We were both lying down, and I made my move: I snuggled in close to him. He put his arms around me. We lay like that for a long time, just talking and making jokes and keeping each other close and warm. Then he started looking at me in that way of I-want-to-kiss-you. I looked at the ceiling and avoided his gaze. I wasn't being coy, I just didn't want to be mistaken.   Then after a while he said, "I want to kiss you, but I don't want to be thrown out." And I said, "I want to kiss you, but I don't want you to punch me in the eye." We smiled at each other then started kissing. It was nice. It was very very nice. It was so nice in fact, that I had the hugest internal boner I have ever had. I rubbed my crotch against him in a grinding manner. I kissed him some more. He whispered, " I can't believe we're doing this. I've had the biggest crush on you for so long. But I'm sure you knew that. " We kissed some more. My boner was getting so fucking hard and big that I thought I was going to implode. I had to do something. So I paused from kissing, and asked him softly, "Do you want to have sex?" He said yes, so we went to my bed and took off each other's clothes and boned like bunnies.   Afterwards when he was holding me he said, "I can't believe what just happened. I didn't even think you liked me that way." And I looked at him and said, "XX, I think I'm in love with you." And he was really taken aback. He said, "Well, I think about you a lot." That was kind of anti-climactic, but hey, whatever, I'll take what I can get. I kissed him and kissed him while caressing and fondling his dick until it was hard again, then I fucked his brains out.   Now that I've had him and etched a mark into my bedpost, what will become of us? What will become of me? Will my fantasies cease and my libido diminish until I'm as dry as a desert? What happens when the object of your lust finally comes into your bed and makes love to you until you almost can't take it anymore? What happens when the man of your sexual desires steps out of your head and makes you come and come and come and makes you love your body and love his body and fucking love life and love being alive? What happens then? What happens after this?

       My Sweetheart the Jerk   After what turned out to be the most splendid Christmasey Christmas of all time (also see Batty's entry about dinner with TJ's family & weed), M has gone on his travels to Central America and I'm here at work trying to meet an imposible deadline. Not really trying, since I'm typing this and listening to music and ignoring work altogether, but that's what weekends are for..hrrr. Yesterday I realized I actually miss the punk, even though we fought all the way to the airport...and all week prior. Still, I have a month to redeem self in the gift-giving department, since this is the first time in 15 years that I had lovely & thoughtful presents to open on Christmas morning (all from him since my family are a bunch of commies) but gave him a book he already owns in exchange.    The evening prior (birthday of Jesus) was spent with his parents and sister and porkchop the cat, at which point I realized what a terrible sucker I am for families and baby pictures and non-boyfriend's old bedrooms that are now antique storage rooms. Not that I'm getting sentimental or changing my mind about anything. It was nice, that's all I'm sayin.   After sending him off on Friday, I spent the weekend in Carmel-by-the-Sea with Alex and Nick and Genny & her family. Will write more about that later.

       *** The Most Wonderful Time of the Year   Last night, Christmas, our good ol buddy TJ MAXX invited Abby and I to his parents' house for dinner. On an otherwise cheerless block, the MAXX family had strung up colorful sparkly lights around their house, decorated their front window, and even had a big glowing snowman on their roof. I knew right away it was theirs.  Mrs. Maxx made the most wonderful Christmas feast. It was straight out of a Christmas cartoon: there was glazed ham, soft juicy turkey, tart sweet cranberry sauce with real cranberries, a bowl of tiny roasted potatoes, stuffed mushrooms, walnut and pomegranate salad and a cheese and cracker platter. We drank wine and champagne and for dessert there were homemade apple pies, cheesecake, ice cream, and Christmas cookies. I was in heaven. Thank god for Jesus being born! Happy Birthday Jesus!! Hallelujah, Amen, and Mm-mm-MM!  Afterwards Abby and I went home and TJ tagged along. He bombed her car with a foul wretched stanky fart, then he came into our home and bombed my room! I was like, "Damn you, TJ, poo already! I command you to release thy noxious fecal obstruction because Abby and I will perish in these ignominious fumes!" Oh, it was awful. After his punitive display of gaseous emissions was over, we got stoned and watched my favorite Xmas movie, Home Alone. We rarely smoke, but we were bored and all the bars were closed. I looked at us --the three of us so usually averse to smoking pot-- passing around a crushed Diet Coke can and torching the booger-esque herb perched atop it, and started laughing. I made choke-y sobby sounds and declared: "Look at us! We Are On Drugs!!"  And we all laughed together that stupid inhaling stoner laugh: Uhhhhh... uhhhhhhh... uhhhhhhhhhh.

       *** IM Retarded   Today is a slow day at work. My shift today is 6:30am-3:30pm, since the receptionist is gone. It's not too terrible because Abby lent me her sweet rollickin car and soul crooner Bart Davenport comforted me as I sped across the Bay Bridge...   On the mortification front, XX emailed me and asked me to be his "IM" buddy and I had no idea how to do this, so of course I replied "yes". I went to Yahoo and downloaded instant messenger and I thought that was enough. Then he asked me for my name. Huh??? I sent him three messages and I figure that would take care of it, but he never replied. Am I supposed to hit something, like "Check Mail"? I am absolutely clueless. He probably realized the extent of my ineptitude because he started emailing me within the office email system again. That was embarrassing and made my cheeks burn with shame. I'm stupid!!!  I only slept 4 hours last night, so I'm also grumpy and cranky. I'm mad at XX too because when I told him he should use colons as punctutation more often, he wrote back "Tough:shit."  He will be ignored for the rest of the day because no one emails to me that way, no one! It is also the lack of sleep that is making me mean. I want to punish him and make him cry for writing that to me. Why?

       So Good!!!  I admit I wasn't into the first two Lord of the Rings films (I slept through most of the first one), but this one made me wet myself right in my seat. Sword-wielding chicks, little homo hobbits, a giant flaming vagina, and mad fighting skills all around...and noone seems to eat or sleep. They just go on fightin'. Although if they showed that part, the movie would be 7 hours instead of 3.5. But yes, excellent. Go see it.

       ***   Blackout!   On Saturday, when Dizzy D and I got off the bus from our hectic day at Stonestown, we found our block pitch black and eerily still. The heavy raining had stopped for a moment, but there were no street lights on and as far as we could see, every single house was dark. I opened the gate and the front door of our apartment building like a seasoned blindman, but once we got inside and closed the door behind us, thick opaque blackness blinded us. Like an idiot, I was thinking, "Oh, I'll just feel along the wall a couple of steps, then turn the garage light on, so we can see our way up the stairs!" I'm such a dunce.  Dizzy D took charge and said, "Grab a hold of my arm!" He used his umbrella as a blind man's cane and tapped his way, side to side, down the lobby hallway til we got to the bottom of the stairs. The darkness was suffocating in its intangible and infinite vastness, so the light rhythmic clicking of his umbrella made me giggle in relief. If in the land of a blackout, the man with an umbrella is king, then his ex-girlfriend -clinging to his arm like a newborn marsupial- would have to be the jester.  On Sunday, he helped me move my furniture down to the van and I helped him look online for potential new girlfriends. This is the "Euro" part I was referring to earlier. I feel comfortable enough with our break-up that I'm actively encouraging him to move on and start seeing people, while he feels comfortable enough with my modern-thinking/ downright weirdness that he will let me be his matchmaker. So far, I've approved five online ladies that may do him right. We spent our penultimate night together, excitedly talking about our new lives and bright futures, while chowing down on beef taquitos and mini-tacos washed down with cold beer.    On the XX front, unrelatedly, I have a feeling that our mutual infatuations with each other are starting to diminish. My libido tells me so. When I put my ear close to my vagina, it says to me, "Girl, you best not take up widdiss wigga. You gotta do some of yo art, make some yo punk-ass songs, be yo weird-ass sef again. Hear? Pay NO mind to me... I won't pay yo bills or mek you a star... That's in yo brains and fo yo hands. Now get yo head from out between yo legs and do somethin real! For real now." Word.

       Party Time  I went to my first proper dinner-and-dancing-and-open-bar holiday party on Saturday night. After a day of carrying boxes and beds and arguing with M, I was exhaused and sore and wanted it over with. In the fancy hotel ballroom, I introduced him to my coworker friends (as my 'non-boyfriend') and forbade him to dance or talk about porn. He behaved. We had a caricature drawing done, ate steak and salad and downed a few beers. In my drunken state, I apologized to Nik for running into his office a few months back when I thought we were being bombed when, in fact, it was just Blue Angels doing their annual tricks above my building. All the 30-and-unders sat at the kids table and talked about fake tans and our feeble bonuses. M & I snuck out to the pier for cigarettes. I said some more inappropriate things to my coworkers and then it was time to go back. The power was out in my neighborhood and we used a lighter to navigate our way through Batty's room, up the metal spiral staircase, down the hall, through the door and to my bed, the only furniture piece I managed to move this weekend.   We argued some more in the morning and I realized that our arrangement has passed its prime. This is exactly what I did  not  sign up for  -  fighting over the blanket, fighting over the radio station, fighting because you have completely different values and don't have much in common and weren't we just having fun anyway? He called later to apologize for saying that I'm the insensitive man in this relationship and since he's leaving in a few days, I left it at that.

       Nerdfest  I practiced saying it at least thirty five times after getting off the bus, but when I finally ordered dinner, what came out was "thiken buweetto wiff sawa cweem puweez"...No, I did not gain a chromosome or become deaf. Last night Dr. Leif presented to me my new torture devise, the Shwarz retainer. I know, so rad!! All the other doctors admired it as it is the latest and greatest in the field of orthodontics for it will not just retain my teeth but move them to their rightful place in my mouf. Dr. Leif did the robot dance for me after which we laughed at my version of 'she sells sea shells'. Good times. Then I took it for a spin at The Lovemakers show. Thank you, Batty, for being my friend when the bouncer asked questions about my expired license and I embarrassed both of us by answering him in my new retarded/deaf/brooklyn accent voice, for buying my pear cider so I didn't have to order and, most importantly, for being patient when trying to figure out what the feck I was trying to say the whole night. Thith ith weelly fun! I'm at wok now and I can't wait to thpeak up at a meeting!

       Tradition  So it looks like I will be buying presents after all this year. Or at least one present. You see, many years of ignoring the holiday season completely with family, combined with boys who weren't big on gift exchange resulted in never having to brave the malls in search of presents or expecting them in return. Sure, G & I make lists of things we want - and then we go shopping and get them for ourselves. We may not be surprised, but we're never disappointed. Once every couple of years mom whips out her checkbook and asks "How much?" to which we reply  "Oh, I don't know. How about a hundred?", but this year she is too preoccupied with dad's existential crisis to remember that the holidays are in full bloom. Which is just fine. Except that two days ago, I received in my email 'A List of Gift Ideas for Me' from M. On the day before that, he had asked me what I want for Christmas and, thinking he must be joking, I said car air freshner (which I could ideed use). Well! His list contained camping gear, magazine subscriptions, photo books and ... um, other things of questionable practicality. Worried about what I may get in return, I emailed him a list of things  not  to get me -  anything that vibrates, porn, anything with heels and/or leopard print, etc..etc.. So now, in the midst of moving and working and dealing with family problems and school applications, I have to spend my precious time looking for something cheap and sensible only to give it to  someone else ? I'm afraid not, my friends. Must think of plan B.

       *** Holiday Party: Un-date #2   XX is my friend now. We went to the office holiday party together and he said I looked great. He let me eat from his plate and didn't complain when I asked him point-blank over dinner, "Is your mother dead?" He knew that in my bluntness I was asking him why he doesn't mention her; he laughed and said, "Is it because I only talk about my dad and my sisters?" I nodded. He told me his mother is alive and alone in Minnesota.   He looked very handsome and during the night after I drank a lot of wine, I found him talking to a co-worker and I playfully spanked his butt and he was like, "Hey!" He liked it.  He wants more, I just know it.  It was fun hanging out with him, but boy, can XX talk. He is a nonstop chatterbox, which I am wary of. I once dated someone who couldn't control his motormouth and late at night when I was trying to sleep I would have to plead with him, "Please, please, stop talking, please. Can you please stop talking? Please?" When one of my office friends asked me how my "date" was going, I mentioned XX's constant talking, and she said, "Well, that's good, because you're quiet."  I thought about this and have to disagree. It's  not  good. Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I want someone else's chatter to invade the still. I don't seek constant noise and stimulus. I like to be alone. I do things by myself. I want my head to be a tranquil and calm lake. I seek friends that are talkative, but in a potential boyfriend that I will be spending a lot of time with, too much talking is a dealbreaker.  I said pointedly to XX, "Are you EVER quiet?" and he said, "Of course. I mean, I like to read books." And I said, "Right, you probably read them out loud!" and he was a little hurt by this. While we were driving, he was being quiet, and I was thinking, "Ah, this is more like it" and I turned to look at him and he was grinning and mouthing, "See? I'm being quiet now!"   We stayed at the party until it was over, then we went to a bar with some friends until the bar closed, then he drove me home. I told him about this John Waters DVD I had that I'd been meaning to watch, "Pink Flamingos", and he said casually, "You should bring it over some time and we can watch it together." And I said, "How about tonight?" He fidgeted and drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and looked out at the pouring rain and harsh stormy weather. It was 2:20am and he was still on Eastern time. "Alright," he said.  We picked up the DVD and drove to his house. The rain was a monsoon. It was so torrential that the windshield was like shower door rippled glass: transparent but blindingly distorting. The wipers were ineffective against the driving heavy downpour. "Isn't this crazy?" he remarked. "Can you see at all through the rain?" He looked over at me for a reaction but I was serene and indifferent to the weather. Rain is stupid. Weather is inconsequential. I was in his warm dry car and I was on the way to his house to watch a John Waters movie with him. Life couldn't be any sweeter.

       Oh, For Fuck's Sake...  My gramma asks me to call her back in 5 minutes because she's not feeling well and has to go outside for some fresh air. She is convinced that she will die this week, possibly today, and there's nothing I can do or say to make her think otherwise. This is not unusual, so I stay quiet and let her talk. Every once in a while I tell her to calm the eff down. For fifteen minutes, she cries on the phone to me about wanting to jump off her 13th floor balcony if death doesn't come naturally and soon. Then she composes her voice for long enough to ask if I got her that eyebrow pencil I promised. Then she goes back to sobbing. Very dramatic, my grannie.   Other than G, the only other person who has spent enough time with my crazy family to understand the mess is cam, who happens to be in town this week. Last night over sushi, I tell him the whole story while his 3-year-old stepkid and M eat quietly, ignored by us. I tell him about how for the first time since Japan, I feel removed from the situation and refuse to get involved. Because they have too much of their own crap to worry about to bug me about school or boys or taking vitamins or getting exercise and 8 hours of sleep. He tells me to enjoy it while it lasts.

       ***   Live 105's Not-So-Silent Night   On Friday night, I met up with W-gal to check out Live 105's Not-So-Silent Night at the Civic Auditorium in SF. Never have I seen so many Hot Topic suburban kids in my life. Not since, erm, summer's Live 105's BFD have I seen such a sea of white teen angst. It was pouring rain, but all the acne-ridden girlies with cakey make-up were wearing spaghetti-strap tank tops and denim cutoffs. They posed and stared around dully at all the other alterna-teens while puffing coolly on their cigarettes. Ugh. Effin suburbanites! I don't care how cool you want to be! If you want to smoke a cigarette, fine, but you have to step outside. If you want to be a smoker, then you have to go out in the rain. Those are the rules. This is why I do not like all ages shows: the complete anarchy!!!   W-gal and I downed tiny $7 cups of beer and scarfed down some $5 pizza. We got pretty close for the talented and amazing BRMC. What was less talented and not amazing at all was the testosterone-soaked mosh pit and the 1993-style slam dancing aka "pass-the-dude". Who wants to pass a rain-drenched damp teenage guy? That is like getting the smell of wet dog on your hands. You would need some quick Purel action to sanitize that funk.   We stayed and watched Rancid, Iggy and the Stooges, and W-gal's favorite, The Offspring. Yes, it is a tragedy to see a grown woman know all the words to The Offspring, but as I told her that night, "W-gal, I forgive your nostalgia. Now go in peace."   The funniest thing that happened that night was when 3 teensy weensy girls wearing the exact same outfit -flimsy black tanks, jeans, and studded belts- ran in front of us, and in their excitement at hearing The Offspring, squealed, quickly grabbed each other's hands and jumped up and down in glee. It was like a baby-punk Ring-Around-the-Rosy. W-gal and I looked at each other. We knew what each other was thinking. We quickly grabbed ahold of each other's hands and jumped up and down and up and down. We jumped up and down because there were punk munchkins in front of us jumping up and down to The Offspring.

       ****  Hanging out with Greg is an adventure, so after driving around the city all day we ended up at Robot Wars, the most spectacular nerdfest of the year. Sure, I was one of only two girls, the other one not so much a girl as a grandmother of one of the contestants, but good times were had by all. Greg's brother had a robot in the 10 pound category and also in the 'Royal Rumble'. As I type, I am drafting sketches in my head for my very own fighting 'bot, complete with red stripes down the sides and a flame thrower. And maybe some sort of contraption that blows bubbles.   Afterwards the fun came to a screeching halt as I had piles of work to turn in on Sunday morning, so M cooked dinner and I typed up dumb reports on his computer. We talked about the weirdness of watching your parents' marriage fall apart as an adult, years after it should have already happened. I doubt they will go through with the separation because they're so fucking codependant, but G & I have already decided whom to excommunicate in case they do.   On the bright side, finally saw the apartment and it's soooo raaaad!!!! Looks a lot like the one from Real World New York, complete with the industrial spiral staircase and tons of Space and Light...Batty and I ran around like we were on speed and I tested out the toilets. Moving is set for this Friday. I can't believe I'm doing this shit again..But I've never looked forward to anything more.  Ok. Tonight ice skating and packing. Batty, let's get Gordo's afterwards, ok?

       *** The Foxgloves Family   On Wednesday night a wonderful band called The Foxgloves Family opened up for Mr.Bart. TFF are an acoustic duo comprised of two scrawny tall-and-skinny-white-boys with charmingly crooked teeth. They play country-ish music and harmonize in soft voices like The Kings of Convenience. The guy on the left had longish stringy hair and wore a beat-up trucker hat, old tattered clothes, and worn-in cowboy boots. I couldn't tell if he was a country-tinged hipster from Oakland or a real deal Southern boy. His face and his character lacked hipster self-satisfied irony and smugness. His dress did not seem studied and their music wasn't tongue-in-cheek or contrived hee-haw country, but simple and sincere. Another charming thing about them was when the guy on the right would mess up on his guitar parts and grin in embarrassment.   After their set I bought a CD from the guy on the left and asked, "Where are you guys from?" and he said, "Oakland." And I said, "I was wondering whether you guys were from: Oakland or the South." And he said, "Well, I'm originally from Nashville and Nick's from Albuquerque, but we're in Oakland now."  Their CD cost $3 and it's well-worth it for its DIY whimsy. The holder is half of a taped-up envelope and on the back the song titles are handwritten. On the front is an authentic old-timey black-and-white photograph secured with photo corners. Each CD has a different picture. Dude-on-the-left asked me which picture I wanted, and I said, "I want one with someone wearing old-timey glasses!" He flipped through all of them and gave me one that had a bespectacled dad playing with a baby.

       *** Sometimes, Life is Real Good   Abby and I have arrived. Last night, over dinner, she noted this in Cafe Claude's dim ambience. We were seated in a private booth and I looked around at our gorgeous surroundings, at us, and had to concede. Sure, we both find our jobs tedious and joyless and the base of our depressions, but our stupid jobs paid for our fabulous dinner of pate, oignon (onion) soup, truite (trout), and desserts of bread pudding (no raisins, thankfully) and creme brulee. Oh, our feast was sumptuous and rich and decadent. Oh, how high our main course was artfully piled. Oh, how the red wine was expensive. But how I didn't want to be anywhere else. Good food, good friends, and good health is all a girl really needs.   We will cry when we get our credit card bills, but for now, we will grin wickedly.

       *****  Best line spoken by Batty last night at the Bart Davenport show as she held a lily that A gave her between her legs to demonstrate the onset of a boner (Bart was about to start his set): "A is a very nice person. She gives us flowers and we use them as genital props."   The show was great even though he was bandless. And we got donuts and milk afterwards.

       I Almost Never Have Days Like This, I Swear  If I wasn't wearing heels right now, I would probably run to the bathroom and cry in the handicapped stall, but they (heels) negate all feelings of powerlessness and channel rage, so I spent the last hour angrily typing up labels on the old typewriter that could have just as easily (and quietly) been done on my computer.  I also spent about 30 minutes earlier looking for another job - preferably something not in an office building. Or perhaps on the first floor, where the cafes and restaurants and card shops are. This job was going well until my boss went psycho and blamed me for mistakes I didn't make. Because I'm the first one to admit when I do something wrong but this time I didn't and I refuse to feel intimidated by her 300 pound 6 foot frame. So I've been furious all day. Yesterday too, actually. So pissed off that I decided that I will skip the holiday party since I might quit/get fired anyway. Better tell M so he can make other plans. Ha!  Good news of the day (besides going to see Bart Davenport, # 1 object of my affection) - James is back from New York. Will write more about that later. Batty - you met James at K's high tea birthday extravaganza. I know! So exciting!!

       *** Tales From the Nursing Home   Nursing homes are depressing. Every week my mom and I drive out to Hayward to visit my dad, and every week mid-visit, I have to step outside for some air and some quiet. We usually visit him during lunchtime so she can personally feed him. Lunchtime is held in the common area where the big screen TV is turned up to a blaring rock concert decibel and all the residents ignore it. Nobody really pays attention to the program. I think it's used as a "Shut up" device. It's hard to hear and talk over it, so this makes people stay quiet. The last time I was there, the channel was tuned to this MTV-style show, all wacky angles and trendy music, with busty Carmen Elektra hosting a segment on the lastest fitness craze, Strip-robics. It was weird and sad and surreal to see these old, depressed, nightgowned people occasionally look up to watch Carmen Elektra grind like a stripper.  Perhaps I subscribe to the popular mentality that the elderly are innocent like children and need to be protected. But are they? I don't think so. To think this negates their sexuality and their adult consciousness. When the Carmen Elektra show was on, I wanted to shut off the tv to shield their innocent eyes, but one man wheeled his chair closer to peer at her gyrations. I was disturbed at first, but now I understand. Old folks, though enfeebled, batty, and helpless, still have sex drives.  Next Saturday, I am going to visit my dad again for a family holiday meal in the common room. I'm not looking forward to the mushy overcooked food, but I do look forward to being with him. He is almost completely insane... but this can make for some good laughs together.

       Highlights from Laura's tree trimming party, which was even better this year than last:  - Drinking barrels of red wine with Lila, most spectacular former boss on the planet, both of us saying some inappropriate things re: boobies. Mostly hers...oh how I miss Lila.  - Seeing Laura's fiance/corporate lawyer bizillionnaire rap to Young MC & Kris Kros on the badass karaoke system, complete with the lyrics guide part on tv. - Zachary's pizza - if you actually add topings, it tastes good after all...try jalapenos - Getting home in time to be in bed by midnight! Thank you sleep, thank you, thank you.

       Weekend in Review  It's Monday and I fell asleep on the bus this morning because I'm so fecking tired. And so very hungry too! On Friday afternoon I had a list of productive & creative things to accomplish this weekend but then the car broke down and taking the bus with a sewing machine/packing boxes seemed impractical. Instead: went to a Korean hostess bar, saw the midnight showing of Kal Ho Naas Ho, a 3.5 hour Bollywood epic of most outrageous proportions!!, went to dinner for brother's birthday where he announced that he'd been asked to become the news editor for the paper (it was actually the Shakespeare action figure I gave him that made the announcement...in perfect Elizabethan english), had talks with M about which one of us has to email my good friend/his ex about our little 'situation' (he decided it should be me), went to dinner for Genny's birthday where her dad and stepmom referred to us as a couple (crap!!) and made us pose for photographs together. In these photos M is smiling at the camera as I try to stab him in the head with a chopstick. Last night was spent watching the Hilton 'movie' on M's laptop (mediocre as far as pornos go), psychoanalysing each other to see who would get offended first - apparently I'm “stuck up and repressed” and he is “unbelievably superficial, tactless and has a lethal combination of a big ego with a small self-esteem”... Fortunately, we discovered that we're both dead inside as none of the insults had any impact whatsoever.   This morning was spent trying to kick him out of my house, but since he doesn't have anywhere to be and spends most of his time sleeping, it was impossible. Secretly praying that he's not trying on my underwear as I type this.

       *** Blog Meets Life   On Saturday night as I was at my mom's house re-reading the entry I just typed in about XX, XX calls. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to announce that our relationship has exited the workplace and is alive and present in our outside-of-work lives. Saturday night, ladies and gentlemen, s-a-t-u-r-d-a-y night. Reality and fantasy are now blurring. Get ready to catch the imminent babies that will be shooting out like half-Vietnamese Romanian gymnasts. It will be a spectacle - a fiery fertile showcase - and I won't have to wear pants.  The night before when XX was driving me home, I told him I was going to the Azure Ray show and he goes, "Oh my friend is going to that." So when XX called on Sat, he said his friend had an extra ticket and he couldn't decide whether to go to Azure Ray or his friend's band, Tom Jonesin. I was like, "Puh-leeze, you are going to the show, I am going to pick you up in my mom's car, and it will be fun." I was not that cool though. If you heard me talking you would've thought I was doing Jerry Stiller. I was talking too loud and shouting into the phone like an excitable old incontinent man. What can I say. I was excited.  I was going to meet W-gal and R-dude at the show, but before I picked XX up, I left a breathless message on W-gal's voicemail apologizing in advance if I act strange because, reality, fantasy, BLURRING. I picked up XX and we drove to the club. We got there around 9pm, but stayed in my mom's car and listened to this old mix tape I found because his friend wasn't going to show up with the ticket until 9:30. He was in high spirits and I don't know if he was on drugs or drink or what, but it was a relief to me that I didn't have to worry about him having a good time: he is self-entertaining. He also has a Minnesota accent that is becoming more apparent as he says the word "bar" more.  At the show, I found myself tapping and patting him on the arm a lot. Apparently I am in love with him. So says my tap-and-pat-crazy hands. He disappeared after David Dondero and I was distraught because we moved up and what if he couldn't find me? Normally I am sane because I'm sober, but that night I'd polished off 3 Captain & Cokes, and I was feeling a little emotional. Alcohol turns me from an empty mechanically-wired robot into a human with arteries and veins and a beating heart. During Azure Ray's set I was freaking out and W and R were very supportive and calmed me down from my beverage-induced hysteria. Here is a clip of in-between song conversation I had with them:  Me: Where is he? He HAAATES me! He thinks I'm boring and stupid!  Them: He does not think you're boring and stupid. You should just go find him and talk to him!  Me: NOOOOO!!! That reeks of despair! I don't want to be desperate! What if he's trying to hook up with that girl who's his "friend"? I don't want to be all intruding on that!  Them: Fine. Stay with us. You choose to stay with us. You don't need him.  Me: That's right. That's right! I choose you guys! I choose you guys!  [Azure Ray play a song.]  Me (turning around to talk to them): I am going to use this Captain and Coke to catch my tears. I think I want to stand right next to you guys so that you're my equals. I don't want to stand in front of you just because I'm short.  Them (now standing beside me): Ok. But now you have a really tall dude standing in front of you.  Me: AAK! I can see XX from here. He's standing by the side. I cannot handle this! Give me back my spot! He is talking to another girl! He wants to make babies with her!!!  Them: That *girl* is our friend Michelle. You just met her, remember? He's only talking to her because we introduced you two to her when you first got here, remember?  Me: Oh yeah. (I keep quiet and enjoy the rest of the set.)   Highlights From My Date(?)   1. On the ride home he says, You've been pretty nice to me lately, and I say, it is because you are from Minnesota. I like people from Minnesota. There are a lot of Minnesotans who've married into my family and he jokingly blurts out, "OK! I don't know what you expect to happen tonight, but-ah, maybe you should buy me dinner first!"   2. We were on Haight St after the show and he goes, so do you ever come by this area? And I said, "Yeah, I buy my shoes here" just as he says, "You probably buy your shoes here." We jinxed on "shoes". Are we going to be lovers now? Or is he Luke and I, Leia?  3. There were some bums on Haight St. with a boombox playing Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" and he chuckles, "It's the 'Say Anything' Song."  And I say in my faux-bum voice, "I'm LLoyd Dobler!" and in a 2nd-bum voice, "Gimme that boombox,  I'm  Lloyd Dobler!" And, oh my lord, I'm going to cream my office corduroys, XX starts to recite the LLoyd Dobler speech. The one that goes, "I do not want to buy or sell anything. I do not want to be part of anything that is bought or sold..." I, in my heart of personal hearts, love that speech and now I  like XX more because he knows that speech. Dammit, love!   Lowlights From My Date(?)   1. I use the parenthetical question mark, because it was not a date. Not really. He did not grope or maul or feel or pet me. In fact, there was no contact at all from him to me. R says that XX is a classic case of a man who just broke up with his girlfriend and just wants to have a good time. I have to consider this assessment, because I can't read XX's mind. I don't know how he feels about me, or if he feels at all.   2. Several times during the course of the evening, when introducing me to friends, or making random disclaimers, he would say, "I don't know you that well" or "this is kind of awkward because I hardly know you" or stuff like that. Apparently he doesn't see me like I see him. Because I don't say things like that to people. My theory is this: "I know what I know, and that's enough for now. Let's continue." Is that the same thing? To me, everytime he said a phrase that had that "I don't know you" meaning or weight, I felt a smidge disheartened, because, really, I would've preferred: "I feel like I've known you my whole life."   3. The end of the night when I dropped him off was a little uncomfortable for me because I've never been on an adult date before where I drop someone off. What is my line? Usually my brain is a teleprompter and I just read the lines, but there were no lines. There was no script, no screenplay. Only a blank. He invited me up, sort of, but I said no I was going to go home and close my eyes and he said, I hope you don't close them while you're driving, and I shook my head. I wasn't tired at all, but I just wanted to get away from the  Is this where we kiss? Does he even want to kiss me? How am I going to kiss him with a seat belt on? Is this even a date? I want him to kiss me. But I can't even look at him.  The entire dropoff I did not look at him. I couldn't. I stared at the steering wheel, hoping a teleprompter would appear on the horn. I waited for him to go inside, and he came back to the car, and he goes, "Are you waiting for me to go inside?" and I said, all embarrassed, "Well, yeah." And he goes, I'm going to smoke a cigarette, but I already have my keys.  And I -channelling Jerry Stiller again- shout, "Okay! Bye!" and I drive off into the night. Oh, sweet uncouth youth, how I hate thee.

       *** Backblogging, rest-of-week   Thursday, he asked for my digits, just in case something would happen... um, booty call? Please? As I wrote down my number on an autumn-hued post-it I hoped that he didn't notice my shaking hands. I also was aware of the heat in my cheeks and my inability to form coherent sentences.   Friday, I emailed him demanding his number so I'd know when it was him calling. I also asked what kind of stereo system he had in his truck so maybe I could bring the cool-to-the-earth's-hot-core Kill Bill soundtrack (Um, Abby, can I borrow please?) and he replies with his number and the statement that his vehicle sports an 8-track and to bring my ELO and ABBA. He came down later to say he was kidding and that he has a CD system. My secret plan is to bring my ELO and ABBA cds. This will make him fall in love with me, undoubtedly.   Then my undercover spy friend within the company came down to tell me that XX has a girlfriend. My robot heart sank. But what is weird and bizarre is that whenever I begin to feel downcast and doubtful about my robot love for XX, he does something to dispel the grumpy pangs. He offered me a ride home. And it was wonderful. And he doesn't have a gf. And he's still going to drive me. And we will listen to the Kill Bill soundtrack and live happily ever after. The end.

       *** Backblogging, Wednesday   I am going to the Holiday Party with this hot chick in HR. I'm excited because she always smells nice and is a sweetheart. She is definitely  not gay, and I'm probably not gay, but if I was drunk and feeling sexy I wouldn't mind making out with her. In fact, I would probably enjoy it. Like I said, she smells nice. But the most important thing that happened on Wednesday is that I emailed XX asking for a ride to the party. Isn't that ballsy of me? Why do I do what I do? Is it because I am the hunter and he is my hot and sexy prey? Not so much because even though he said "No problem" I was a wreck thinking about why I did what I did.   I knew I had to ask him because even though he makes my heart thump loudly in my chest, and my hands shake like a mutha, and my tongue incapable of forming words, I feel like I'm in fucking heaven when he's around.   In other news, Dizzy D and I decided to split up. We're being very Euro about it all. More on this later...

       5 minute break - go!  Damn it!!! Work is fucking me up the ass!! This is the third day when I came in early, didn't take lunch and will stay late. And did I mention I have to work this weekend? Luckily, the VP noticed, so hopefully there's a big fat bonus check in the mail. A big fat check I will spend on sushi.  In areas not work related, M is going to El Salvador for a month. This is good because I can figure things out while he's gone, like if I like him or not. We see each other every other day, which fucks with your mind when you're trying to decide on these types of things. So if I miss him when he's gone, I'll make him my boyfriend. Except that I don't want to be anyone's girlfriend yet. That word makes my stomach hurt. Either way, I don't have to make any decisions until January and by then, all kinds of things can happen.

       ***   Backblogging, Tuesday   When life spins you into a dizzy tizzy, there is no time to blog. On Tuesday I spent the entire day in the back of shipping, prepping boxes of See's chocolates to be shipped out to the company's customers. I accepted the sad fact that I would not see XX because of my imprisoned state. But for some strange reason he came back to talk to the other admins about something or other. I was deathly quiet the whole time because I felt my face grow hot and I was suddenly self-conscious of the task I was doing. I was at the cutting board slicing cardstock in half. Each half had a message surrounded by a bright pointsettia border. The message read: "In the spirit of the holiday season, please share these with your staff members."  Isn't that a bossy fucked-up message? It's implying that humans are essentially selfish pigs and need to be reminded to share. I was embarrassed that I was cutting up these stupid cards.   Anyway, the cat got my tongue like a howly bitch, and in my mind, I was like, "Damn you, self, can't you think of anything to say? Goddamnit, think of something to say! Something! Anything!" But no words came. Nothing clever, in fact, nothing at all. So since I was being retardedly cripplingly shy, I smiled during the jokes and smiled at myself smiling during the jokes like a socially retarded shyfuck cripple.  The back of shipping has a wall that is a chain-link fence. On the other side is the set-up room where computer people fiddle with computers. Later on I was alone in shipping for a while and we saw each other through the fence. I stuck out my tongue at him like the socially graceful adult I am, and he stuck out his tongue at me then we started talking. We talked through the fence for a while and I felt like I was falling in love with a convict. I pictured a rough future replete with sex through the fence and trying to smuggle him knives implanted in hot dogs.  He asked me if I wanted to hang out in the set-up room while he boxed up a computer and I said sure. We chatted and made jokes and I was very charming and talkative because my brain was trying to ignore all the signals coming from below my waist. If I was a guy I would've been completely rude and boorish because a big fat boner would've been bulging through my pants. Fortunately, I am a girl, so my boners are internal and thus, invisible to innocent office hotties. I know what you are wondering. Why didn't you guys just make out? It's because there were two other people in the room. And they were giving us glances like, "These two horndogs are gonna doo it and make fuckin UNIX babies back here."

       Move #18  We're signing the lease today. Batty & I haven't seen the place yet, which is probably bad, but from what we hear, it will be just fine. A bathroom for every bedroom? Yes, please.  I just want 'Wood' in my address....  So work has been ruining my boner the past couple of weeks. Which is why I can't write much. Because it takes me two years to write a damn entry and lately I haven't had the time.  But major developments are happening all around...kind of. Maybe.

       ***   Sigh. So yesterday I figured it would be another day without any interaction with my office boyfriend. But he came by. And here are some soundbytes from my fucked-up mouth...  "You've seen boobies before, right?"  (I showed him my shrine and he was about to open the door. I decided to forewarn him just in case... In case of what? In case of office boner.)   "You saw the exhibit with the ASIAN PROSTITUTES! Oops, did I say that too loud?"  (We talked about the MOMA and he didn't see the Diane Arbus exhibit. I deducted that he saw the other one. Then I realized that there were a lot of people walking by my desk right at my deduction.)   "Ooh... that'll be titallating."  (I don't remember what this was a response to. I just know that it was inappropriate and I made him blush. Awww...)   My problem is that there is no subtlety to my flirting. There is no coyness. Only balls on the desk. Or, in my case, vagina.

       Bart Davenport    Last night I went to Cafe du Nord to see my rock idol Bart Davenport. I have never felt as swoony and enthusiastic about a singer/band since my Juliana Hatfield obsession in high school. I'd only known about Bart D. for a couple of months, but I have seen him five times already. His sweet singing and impressive guitar playing make my heart swell with happiness and a general sense of well-being. If I was king, I'd ply him with fruity wine and ask him to be my court musician.  Last night he was wearing this striped shirt with a boatneck and 3/4 length sleeves. It looked cool on him, but as I thought about it, I was like, Hey, boatneck? 3/4 length sleeves?! That is a woman's shirt! Only Bart D. could pull this off. I told Abby and she said that when we saw him play at The Hemlock she swore he was wearing women's bellbottom pants. This could be true too. He is an emaciated fellow, slight and scrawny enough to merit shopping in the women's section. He was wearing the pants yesterday and they are blatant bellbottoms -- tight, but with swingy flares that make his feet look teeny. Though he may wear borderline-women's clothes, you don't notice this right away because he is so fucking cool. You are distracted by other things too, like his phenomenal musicianship, or the intriguing (non)alignment of his teeth, or the way he's always pinching his nose.  I think it would be a good idea to have a drinking game where one would take a drink everytime he pinches his nose. Drink, not shot, because since he does it all the time, it would turn into ill vomitous ruin, and many people would die from the eventual drunk driving.  Bart D. sighting -- On tuesday night he was present at the Kelley Stoltz show, front and center. He yelled out, "Why are you so good?!!!" after one extremely rockin and beautiful song. My thoughts exactly. I wanted to yell that out to Bart during his set last night, but I was afraid I would shatter my anonymity. I have to go to as many shows as I can without him thinking I am weird or psychotic. Both the beauty and the tragedy of BartD is that he is a local performer who plays frequently and in small intimate venues. The beauty is that I only have to share him with 50 people at a time; the tragedy is that he may start to recognize me.   I think I will make this blog The Blog of Mortification and Sightings of BartD.

       My Family Rules!  I know I talk shit about my dad all the time - about his bad temper, unsolicited food fights at The Olive Garden, existential shananigans where he refuses to speak to anyone - but he just called me at work and offered to help me buy my new laptop. He even had me talk to one of his co-workers about what kind I want. Woo hoo! I know it sounds bratty, but I've been working my ass off ever since the paper route days, so when this type of stuff happens, I say thank you and accept graciously.

       *****  After my book group on Wednesday evening, I received the following message on my voicemail: "Last week you chose door number 3 but opted out. Better make it this week". It was TJ MAXX, harassing me about going dancing with him at some new bar-club on Polk. Since I already had plans to take Thursday off, I called him back and told him I'll pick him up at 10:45. Despite my initial hesitation about going and my predictions of spending 3 hours watching scenesters trying to out-cool each other, it turned into an pretty fun night. Me, TJ, TJ's ex MK, JJ Fad's ex and her new girlfriend, all completely smashed and dancing to early 90's hits by such talented singer-songwriters as En Vogue, Digital Underground and Sir Mix-A-Lot as well as some new stuff. I was seeing double by the time we left, so I asked TJ to drive. At his house 15 scary minutes later, he revealed that he, too, was completely wasted and was 'just trying to do what all the other cars were doing'. Thank you lord jesus for getting us safely to TJ's abode. So that was Wednesday.   On Thursday, anticipating a day of much needed rest and relaxation, I drove home, called in sick, and got into my soft warm bed. Ten minutes later, Marcus called and told me to be ready to go to the sweatshop in 45 minutes. Fuck!!, I thought, that's why I took the day off, not to nurse my monster hangover. At the factory, Marcus explained to me how the whole operation works. I tried to pay attention, but all the machines were too intriguing, so every ten minutes I took breaks and ran around the floor. I had to hold myself back from jumping into the enormous piles of felt and cotton scraps on the floor. After that, Marcus got me my very own Costco card and we went out to lunch in chinatown. Then it was time to go to chem class.   It's finally Friday and I'm counting minutes until I can go home and veg out in my pajamas. Mike is back on Sunday. After finishing his scarf, I decided to keep it for myself, so I have to churn out another one by then. In addition to all the other stuff I was planning to get him for christmas but never did. He wrote that he lost weight in the last 6 weeks so maybe I'll roast a chicken on Sunday or something.

       ***   5 bands, 5 days   My record of show-going is 3 nights in a row. I did that twice last year and the 3rd show is always hard. I remember almost falling asleep during !!! (chkchkchk). This year, I didn't want to be so fucked-up-retarded about going to shows, but I'm on Day3 of a 5-day binge. Is it my fault that all these good shows line themselves up so neatly for me to knock down? It started Tuesday night with Beam/ Rogue Wave/ Kelley Stoltz at Thee Parkside, then yesterday night's Fiery Furnaces/ Ted Leo, both with my fellow enthusiast, W-gal. She's almost as crazy as me. Almost. I considered taking a break tonight, staying home, and skipping seeing Bart Davenport open for The Cuts, but I clicked on the Cafe du Nord website to read about the 2nd band, Duvall. They would determine whether should I stay or should I go. Duvall is made up of ex-members of The Smoking Popes! Jesus, I'm a dead woman. I am so dead. I'm going to this show, and I will be dead. Dead ecstasy.    For the curious and lonely, I'm going to South/Metric at Slim's tomorrow night and Coachwhips/Numbers on Saturday. Friday night I'll be skulking around alone, wondering what to do with myself inbetween bands, and on Saturday night I will guiding XX into the indie-punk pseudo-underground. You are welcome to join me. Come one, come all.

       *** "No one ever knows or loves another."  -- Robert Smith   There's this guy at my work who postulated that in most relationships, the core commonality and the balm that soothes all differences is carnal desire. I disagreed vehemently to his statement because I'm essentially a wide-eyed closet romantic and optimist, but I'm starting to understand the crux of his argument. Maybe my recent experiences have infused me with cynicism, but I don't believe there are soul mates, only mates of convenience.   If soul mates truly existed and we search for them, then more people would be single and the earth less populated. And look at all the people who marry and look into each others' eyes and utter their undying devotion to each other, then get divorced a year later. Perhaps the state of soul mate-dom is fleeting and temporary. Whereas mates of convenience would explain why I've had four boyfriends already, most of them friends that've turned into lovers. It's the convenience. Three of them were co-workers that I'd worked with a long while before we got together. It's the convenience. It's the proximity and the ease of making plans because we speak the same language,  live within the same city, and have the same schedule. What is love between a man and a woman, really, except sex and companionship? And when that gets tired, what are we left with?

       *** Drinking   Drinking causes hyperbole. A few drinks make me swoon and sway and stumble. And unfortunately, inflate words to stupendous meaning when I don't mean anything at all. After 3 sake martinis at Fly last night, I told XX he was "the handsomest man in the world." Now, in my stark Tuesday morning sobriety, I admit that this is not the case. I find him attractive, but he's definitely not the handsomest man in the world. He has a triple chin. Sometimes, on a bad day, the count rises to quadruple. Why did I lie? I think it was to get him in bed. Though I have fun with him and he's now one of my best friends, I really cannot see myself spending an eternity with him. I'll take it day by day, but I want more drama! I want to be swept off my feet! I want someone worldly and dashing and suave, and accepting of me for me instead of someone who constantly asks, "Why are you like that?" or "What are you doing?" or "Why are you doing that?"   I've told him that it irritates me that he's constantly questioning me, but he just shrugs. He's a little violent in his play too. He bought me a mini-drill and he turned it on and started coming at me with it, pretending to drill into me. WHAT THE FUCK! Other people may find this amusing, cute even, but not me. That is not funny to me. That is like "pretending" to shoot me with a loaded gun. That's how Jerry Garcia lost his finger, people! He was "pretending" to chop his finger off and he missed! I don't like play that could end in tragedy. I don't like play that could end in tears, blood, or a trip to the emergency room.  But, like all relationships, there's always redeeming qualities that outweigh the annoyances. He told me that he thought I was the prettiest girl in the room at the rockabilly show (even though I felt like a butch bulldyke) and he told me that I'm cuter than his ex. He was also drunk last night, so these statements probably were inflated. But that makes me think -- how can I truly communicate when I'm too inhibited in my sobriety to say heartfelt things, but when I'm drunk, I just pronounce meaningless words to lure him into my bed? Is there a happy medium?

       ***  If an old wizened fool like Michael Douglas can score a lovely soft and smooth babe such as Catherine Zeta-Jones, then Abby, you too can be mistaken as the gf of an older gent. I used to think that May-December romances were vile and gross, but as I'm getting older, I get it. Some women just want someone reliable and dependable: someone who can handle their finances and is ready to settle down; someone who can provide for and take care of a wife and possibly a baby. I mean, who doesn't want the easy life?  Me. Every so often, my mom sighs and reminds me to not marry an older man, like she did. Older men get old, she says, then you have to take care of them. My mom had it hard. She was my dad's nurse for over a decade as he progressed deeper and deeper into Parkinson's disease. She had to spoonfeed him and diaper and wash him and clean up after him and she was barely in her 50s while he was in his mid-60s. I told her XX is 30 and she gasped. She was worried for me. I said, don't worry mom, I'm not gonna MARRY him, but if I do, there's always divorce! I was joking, but I think I gave her a mini-heart attack with that one.  On Saturday, XX took me on a date. He promised awesome food at Thee Parkside, like Hush Puppies and Chicken Fried Steak, but when we went, they'd changed their menu to bar food burger fare. We went to Goat Hill Pizza instead and ate pizza and drank beer. Then we went to a rockabilly show at Thee Parkside. XX knew the doorman so we got in for free which was awesome! It's because I clip coupons and pick up pennies that I was so thrilled.   I'd never been to a rockabilly show before, and it was fun to see all the 50s-styled eye candy -- all the dungarees, the pompadours, and the coiffed made-up ladies with dainty shoes. I felt like a bulldyke with my messy disheveled hair, windbreaker, and bare face. The show was okay, but I ached for the familiarity and comfort of scrawny pasty humble indie types. Maneuvering through a rockabilly crowd is hard, because all the guys are big and assert their stance. At indie shows I tap people lightly on the shoulder and they sway out of the way, but on Saturday, it was like, tap. (No response.) Harder tap. (No response.) TAPTAPTAP! (No response.) Then I had to find an alternate route. To examine things anthropologically, do you think people are attracted to certain scenes because of their physical type? Rockabilly guys are huge!

       Monday Greetings  So I realized that whenever I write about having to work on the weekend, I end up procrastinating and feeling guilty but not actually going in. Which is good enough for me. It's much easier to think of an excuse for why something is not done than to spend my off time doing it.   On Friday, Marcus and I went to eat french food. To help him use up his gift certificate, we each got a 4 course meal (with "tasting fish"), some champagne and lots of wine. I got some interesting looks from other patrons who were probably wondering if we were on a date. He's old enough to be my father, perverts! Ok, so the good news - Marcus wants to go ice climbing in Canada for two months and agreed to let me look after his business. Even better news - if I make patterns that are halfway decent, he'll pass them on his japanese clients. Plans have been made for this Wednesday to visit the sweatshop..er..factory to learn how to 'inspect garment quality' and meet some peeps. Also on Wednesday is Wendy's memorial lunch, so I think I'll be sick that day.

       Back to School Blues  I was so tired when I left school last night, I almost cried. I tried my best to pay attention in class and solved all the word problems about condensation of hydrogen molecules. But when I left I was completely miserable (about having to wait for the bus in the freezing cold) and so so tired. I thought back to five years ago. I was doing the same thing - working full time, going to cal, eating take-out with beau, seeing shows and coming home at 2 in the morning. But I had so much more energy back then. Where did it all go??!?! I'm only 25!! School and work are sucking the life out of me. Which reminds me, I have to work this weekend. Tonight I'm having dinner with Marcus. Will try to convince him to let me help run his clothing business. He keeps saying that I'll find it boring, but nothing is more boring than running financial reports on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing.  And Batty - I love you for the way you are, especially you orientalism and the fact that I can be racist around you, but I'm so sorry I don't have a penis to offer you.  My borrowed penis is back in 9 days.

       *** The Beginning of the End   XX and I have not been together for a month and already we are fighting. We are fighting because he's gone all the time and I need more attention. I told him he has a small penis. I told him that he is dull and boring. They are empty fighting words, but I hurt him. I want to hurt him the way he hurts me.   I got angry that he ogled my model-like friend at my family gathering, though he vehemently denied it. I got upset at how he points out things about my appearance that I'm already aware of and already insecure about ("Your hands are very wrinkly... Look how big your head is... It's weird how you have fangs.") I am tired of having to explain things to him, like why Vietnamese people do certain things or why I want to eat greasy meaty savory things in the morning instead of cereal or like, a pancake.   He thinks I'm a racist, but I think I'm just too tired to indoctrinate another whiteboy into my very personal, very cultural customs and idiosyncracies. He says he doesn't understand why I'm like this (i.e. VIETNAMESE) since I was "born here." I tell him that just because I was "born here" doesn't mean I didn't grow up in a microcosmic vacuum of Vietnam in my parents' house. I'm too old and too tired to train someone to love me for who I am and for how I am. I thought that dating someone older would guarantee wisdom and worldliness and understanding, but I was wrong. As the late Aaliyah put it so succinctly, "Age ain't nothin but a number."

       *** Funeral   My grandfather had a beautiful funeral. My mom sang songs a capella and everyone chanted the prayers, even the fallen Catholics, even me. It was heartbreaking to see my mother cry, because the last time she cried was when I was very young, probably 20 years ago. She wept and called him "father" in Vietnamese which I rarely heard her use. From the time I was born, she used "grandfather" which is the Vietnamese tradition: to address people as your child would address them. Your formal relationships change when your child is born, so it was moving to see her as the child, instead of my mother, and to understand my grandfather as my mother's father.  The women ripped up sheets of white fabric into long strips and we tied those around our heads: women wore them with the long ends trailing, and the men wrapped the fabric all the way around and tucked in the ends neatly. In the chapel we stood in line to light incense and bow 3x in front of his framed picture, then we processed past the open casket. I walked up to light the incense with Green Marble and her bf Jason and I forgot how many times I bowed because I started too early, then lost count trying to synchronize with the other two. I hoped no one noticed my flub, but right when I thought that, Green Marble dropped her incense and the red-hot tip burned her on the way to the carpeted floor. "Ouch!" she whisper-shouted, jumping back a little. Jason recovered the incense from the floor and handed it back to her. She was embarrassed. I was relieved that a bigger spectacle dwarfed my own faux pas.  Afterwards, all the cousins got together and we went to Hong Kong Flower Lounge and pigged out on dim sum. We stuffed our faces with dumplings and various pork delights and when the bill came, the total only came to $14 a person. This included the subsidization of the 2 college kids and the one unemployed cousin.   We split up to go home and nap and at night everyone drove up to the city to see my and Green Marble's new apt. We drank beers and ordered massive quantities of Chinese, Indian, and Thai take-out. And everyone met XX. He was like John Corbett in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". We put him in charge of choosing the Indian entrees and he was like, should I order one order of samosas? (This was before most of the cousins had arrived.) We looked at him in horror and bafflement. I was like, "No! You gotta do 3 orders! AT LEAST." And one cousin laughed and said, "You're not from a big family, are you?" Everyone showed up and we ate and laughed and drank and poked fun at each other. We compared notes on who cried the most and who cried the least. My grandfather would have been pleased.

       *** Sign Me Up!   I have decided to join the circus. Kind of. I'm going to try to get a job selling tickets for the circus. The upscale $100-a-head circus named "Teatro Zinzanni." I'll apply, they'll muse over my application, then they will not call me. But I am making the effort! It's their loss if they don't want my freaky self working for them.

      K & I went to visit our old office yesterday. We stood in the back room among the buzzing sterilizing machines and instrument trays not sure of what to do. I was a little nervous because I hadn't cried about it yet but didn't want to do it in public. We brought cookies as way to break the ice. The assistant ladies told us of Wendy's last months there, how she could no longer drive herself to work, how she needed help getting up, how she would take naps/pass out in dental chairs. E got choked up while trying to tell another story and couldn't finish it. Every few minutes K & I looked at each other for moral support. Dr. Bossman came in and invited us to a memorial luncheon next week.

       Unday Mopdate  Long weekend, but not so much for me. With dental bills piling all around my room and the credit card balance slowly creeping up instead of working its way down, I realized that the days of spending money recklessly and treating myself to takeout three times a day must stop. Along with that, I decided that some weekend work might be necessary. So I worked two shifts at the International Art Expo. Easy money, fun people and free lunch. And I got to run around the exibit hall and look at the most amazing paintings and sculptures I've seen in a while. Made by people with actual talent and not just hipster art fucks wannabes. That gave me one day off, which I spent working on the damn slipcover (it's almost done)...and hanging out with Dave, Ari, Batty, Green Marble and their big ass extended family. There was tons of food, wine and I think I heard some singing around 2 am...Today, K and I are visiting our former place of employment since Wendy's family decided not to have a funeral and we need closure. Then off to school for chem lab.   Mike is back in two weeks. I'm mostly looking forward to it and a little bit not. I don't want the petty fights but I want the other stuff - the home-cooked meals, movies, hikes and the..um..good stuff. I will book our flight to the Grand Canyon today. This means that I must start training tomorrow in case my donkey rental plan doesn't pan out. Crap. I hate excercise.

      I know, doesn't it sounds terribly pretentious if I leave all that out? Ok. Wendy was my boss at the university dental office that I worked at through high school and have been going to every 6 months for teeth cleaning/biopsies/tumor checks/surgeries. K worked there after I quit so between us, we have about 8 years of work invested in "that" place. Wendy was our boss and she was awesome and laid back and generally the greatest bosslady one could hope for. She died of anorexia. It's terrible to think that it could have been prevented, but it's a physical manifestation of a mental illness and unless she wanted to change her eating habits, no one could help her. It fucking sucks. We both have funerals to go to in the next few days.

      ***   To my readers, I am sorry for not writing more faithfully. My months of detailed blogging during work hours has finally smacked me smartly in the rump. The work I neglected has become insurmountable and I feel like my relatively easy job has become Sisyphean. I update the database through my lunch hour and I spend my breaks in the file room, but still my email inbox is a triple-digit and the "to be filed" tower of paperwork looms high.   In my personal life, I have tomorrow and Friday off to attend the various funeral ceremonies for my grandfather. They span three days, with the actual funeral and burial on Saturday morning. I've never been to a funeral before, let alone a Vietnamese Catholic one. From my experience with Vietnamese Catholic ceremonies, I can tell you right off that there will be no booze, but plenty of prayer and stern glances of disapproval from the older folk. My aunts will gently chide me for my strange clothes and my cousin Hai will probably fall asleep sometime during the homily.   My cousins and I are all grown, but we still feel like little kids. We have cars, day jobs, responsibilities, and even children, but when we get together, it's like adulthood is an outside-of-the-family joke. We glue ourselves to the television, put off eating to play video games, and make fun of each other honestly and ruthlessly. Because there are so many of us, we all talk in quick, brief soundbytes. We're loud and obnoxious and always interrupting each other. It is the opposite of an American family and this has proved problematic for new boyfriends.   An American family is much like Diane Keaton's family in "Annie Hall". Each person talks for a few sentences while everyone else listens attentively. Then it is another person's turn to say things while everyone else nods their head in quiet thoughtfulness. When Dizzy D first started attending our gatherings, he'd be frustrated that every sentence he'd say would turn into a set-up for someone else's punchline. He subjected himself to undue ridicule because he couldn't adapt quickly enough to the cadence. It was his own fault! Extended talking in my family translates into self-importance and self-importance is grounds for ridicule. To further muse on this, I could draw parallels between rhythms of conversation as reflective of American individualism vs. immigrant values on group preservation.   Anyway, this will probably be my only post this week, as I will be grieving. On a happy note, Bart Davenport is playing thrice this month in SF and in my love life, (drum roll please) XX asked me to be his valentine! My grandfather would be proud!*  *I'm just kidding. No he would not. He would actually be indifferent as he blasted an ear-shattering fart and blew a snot rocket into a tissue-lined envelope while bickering with my grandma.

      Wendy died last night. She was in her early 40's and had just purchased a house in Hawaii with Jeff, which she excitedly described to me last time I saw her, about two months ago. K called this morning and told me this and since then neither one of us have been able to concentrate on work. The funeral is probably in the next few days, but we will try to go there tomorrow afternoon. Sadly, we knew this might happen sooner or later. She was down to 67 pounds. Kaiser didn't admit her because 'admittable' weight is 60 pounds. Even for a five foot woman. How absurd and ridiculous. Wendy was a culmination of all that is good and just and sincere and her death is shocking as it is heartbreaking. It's just fucking weird and unfair and so so tragic and it puts everything else in perspective. I can't imagine going there and not seeing her.

       Monday Monday  The plan was to go to the beach before work. It was decided on last night, after I took a hot shower and realized that there's no way in hell I'm getting dressed just to move the truck. The streets are cleaned from 6 to 7 am on Mondays in my neighborhood, so the plan was to get the truck (my brother's, we switch sometimes) at 6 and go to the beach with a cup of tea and the book I'm trying to finish, come back at 7, eat, go to work. But then I had this insane dream last night (about high school and Scooter and my first grade teacher in the motherland), so instead I reparked the truck in a 2 hour zone and went back to sleep to see how the dream ends, then moved it again at 7 to its spot for the day.   This weekend was quiet and restful and lovely. The house was full of people and tasty food smells and music and movies. I finally picked up the rest of my crap from the page street house, dropped off my dry cleaning, and sewed half of the slipcover for the couch. I saw two movies, ate too many ice cream mochis to count, had brunch with Batty, JJ Fadd and TJ Maxx and circled the airport 7 times waiting for my friend to land.  And I didn't have to tnink about work for a second.

       *** No Show   Last night I'd planned on seeing The Moore Brothers at Cafe du Nord, but I got a call from my cousin that my grandpa had died.   "Oh," I said, "So when's the funeral?" I accepted it matter-of-factly because he had been in a vegetative state for a long time and it had been a waiting game -- he had been dying for years. Before his vegetable state, about 3 years ago, he was completely senile, asking who everyone was. My aunts would ask him his age and he would say in all seriousness, "37".  Slowly he spoke less and less until he was eventually bedridden, eyes closed, and hooked up to feeding tubes.  Occasionally the hired help would turn him, change his diapers, and wipe him down. He mostly slept, and when his eyes were open, there was no trace of recognition: I didn't recognize him, and he didn't recognize -let alone register- me. So in my heart, though he's passed on, it's a great relief because I'm a proponent of quality-of-life, not quantity.   I really wanted to go to the show, but my date for the night was my narcoleptic cousin-in-law, P-diddy, who is goofy and lovable, but not trained in the subtleties of Vietnamese family dynamics aka keeping-your-mouth-shut. I didn't want news to trickle upwards to my aunts and uncles that I'd gone out the night grandpa died. In the game of family politics, this would be a disgrace to my mother. I didn't want to shame her so I stayed home with Abby and my roommate/cousin Green Marble and we watched a Chris Rock DVD together on the couch, each of us with a blanket over our legs like old men. We laughed out loud and sipped cheap wine.   I anticipate the funeral, because it'll be nice to see all my family in one place. Every single member. Though it's for my grandfather's funeral, I love being with them. I love the togetherness because, though sometimes nosy and sometimes bossy, I fucking love my family.

Abby and I have been busy bees, moving into our new place and battling the hordes and teeming masses of ants that have collectively decided to be our roommates. We declared war and won, because bees beat ants, 2 - 1 trillion, but it was not an easy victory. Our weapons of defense were a vacuum, a dustbuster, plastic ant traps and metal ant traps. And inadvertently, our massive gigantic ant-crushing feet. None of these were effective in the battles. What made us win the war was toxic ant chalk.   This little known secret among Americans has a cultish following among immigrant families and those that are down with Chinatown. Abby got some from her mom and what ensued was the most brutal, inhumane, and sadistic anthropod torture that two small girls could ever wage: we drew squares and boxed them in. It was a prison of poison, a poisonous prison. It was sheer hell for the unsuspecting ant, but sheer delight for us, their wronged captors.   "That's what you get for creating a mass suicide in my cider, you base, lowly, uncultivated, breeding bugs! Take that! (Draws a square.) And that! (Draws another square.) And this one, this one's for getting in my newly opened package of dried mangoes, motherfuckers!" It was sweet victory.   The next day, fallen ant bodies were everywhere. The battlefield was littered with the carcasses of our vanquished enemy.  But it was not an ignoble death, for in the end the big dustbuster in the sky descended upon most of them -the ones not along the walls or in corners- and carried their bodies up to meet their maker.

       Noisepop Day 4    Wrens @ BOTH/ Saturday 02-28   Before the show I cooked dinner for myself and XX and I swear I'm a lightning bolt in the kitchen. But in actuality, I'm a snail with a lightning bolt spray painted on its shell. Prepping a chicken to be roasted does not take 5 minutes, apparantly. Ultimately, when the chicken was done it was crisp, tender, and juicy -- well worth the wait, but it made me miss the first band, Communique,  one of my favorite local acts. We got there right as they were taking down the drums and carrying their equipment off stage. I was a little bummed, but I'd seen them twice before.   Low Flying Owls  -- the bassist has the exact same style as Kings of Leon: longish 70s hair with thick bangs and moustache. They were pretty good and I liked some of their songs, but there was nothing distinctive about them. They could play their instruments fine, but they weren't pushing any envelopes. Their sound is very "now" (Cure influenced, Gang-of-Four influenced, new wavish) but they didn't have that special something that makes me look up from my drink. They're ambitious with the sound they want to achieve, but I think they need some time to grow into it and own it.   Dead Science  -- This is what I came for. This is what Noisepop is about. Exposing me to new bands that will make me drool from my ears. When they were setting up I had no idea what they'd sound like because their individual aesthetics were so different. The drummer looked like an everyman: he had on a polo shirt and khakis (or something to that Gap extent), the bassist looked like Pee-Wee Herman's indie cousin: floppy asymmetric Flock of Seagulls hair, velvet blazer ruffly foppish shirt- I think there were polka dots or rainbow colors, and the singer-guitarist had a perfect pompadour, cowboy shirt, and denim jeans. XX said he looked just like Carl Perkin. Would they be Rockabilly? Electro? Hootie & the Rockabilly Electro? I was anxious with curiosity.      It was noisy and cacophonous. They were experimental: the drummer made screechy scratchy noises by scraping his drumstick in circles on the riding cymbal and he'd sometimes drum with the stick end of a maraca. The bassist played classical bass with a bow and when he'd switch off with electric, he played a fretless. But over all this avant garde ART sound, the singer crooned in a weirdly high, angelic voice. I loved it! I love shit like that.. experimental art school shit that's serious and frankly, NEW. Well, new to me. I don't come from an art school background, and I don't listen to John Cage, so I don't know what's what. But I can tell you what I like, and Dead Science, I LIKE! Thank you Kevin Arnold.    Wrens  -- Thank you Kevin Arnold. The Wrens were unbelievable. They're four guys that must be in their 40s, so I was skeptical if I'd like them. When I think of old rockers, I think of Fleetwood Mac or Bruce Springsteen, neither of whom I care for. The only 40s-ish band I like is The Cure, and they're established. They've been putting out records since the late 1970s. The Wrens rocked it like The Replacements. Great tunes, great post-punk fast, crazy guitar playing, great harmonies, and the best part: the moves!   The main guy had a lot of moves like pointing, and jumping, and he even flung his bass guitar over the audience but it jerked back to him because he'd hung onto the guitar strap. I gasped, I laughed, I clapped. What a great live show! And even though it was so energetic and dynamic, they did a lot of somber unmic'd singing too. The audience was enraptured and perfectly quiet so we could hear everything.  So intimate. And so risky too. I remember through Azure Ray's set a couple months ago, the audience talked the entire time. There was an annoying  chattery din throughout their set. Not so with The Wrens. I didn't want their show to end. I couldn't get enough.   Another highlight was this exchange: Singer: We've all been living in the same house since '91...  Audience: (Dead silence.) Singer: C'mon, I know. (Motions for the inevitable heckling.) It's sad, huh? Audience dude #1: That's Sad! Singer: You're probably wondering why we're not better. Guitarist: (walks up to his mic) I just had a date last year. Audience dude #2: God bless the internet!  All in all, Noisepop was a wonderful week in music. New bands to be excited about, new CDs to listen to, a bright new future on the rock horizon {shimmer, shimmer}. The best part was having people to share it with and be just as jazzed as me: W-gal & R-dude who showed on 3 nights and my cousins-in-law P-diddy & Big Bob at The Stills. No, the absolute best part of Noisepop were the turkey tacos that W-gal made before The Stills. I think that's what made the music so good: fuckin homemade turkey tacos. RAWK!

       Noisepop Day 3    Stills @ The Independent/ Friday 02-27    Elephone  -- Eh.   On the Speakers  -- Very good! The music was very exciting, like hearing The Strokes for the first time. But unlike The Strokes, they don't look bored and jaded. W-gal and I tried to get their CD, but they're between labels right now and it's floating in limbo. I'm looking forward to seeing them again opening for the walrusman aka Sleepy Jackson.   Stratford 4  -- Snooze. BORRING! They need some vocal harmonies and a more enthusiastic drummer. She looked like she did not want to be there. She looked like she'd rather be at home watching Ray Romano on CBS. Heck, gimme those sticks woman! I may not know shit about rhythm, but lemme show you how it's DONE.   The Stills  -- I was in heaven. I love their songs. The basslines are fantastic and the guitar tones are so pretty. The melodies and guitar sounds remind me of "To the Sky" my favorite Cure song. I'd seen The Stills a couple months ago at Popscene, and they were only alright then. I thought they were overhyped and also, Popscene is the worst place to see a show: low stage, obstructive pillars... But on Friday, they'd grown into and exceeded their potential with flying sonic colors. It was solid. {applause}

       Noisepop Day 2: Detroit Cobras @ BOTH    Salem Lights, The Demons, Starlight Desperation, Detroit Cobras   This lineup was more solid and rockin than last night's.    Salem Lights : dirgy and distorted. very tight. v.good. but not for me because there were no melodies and no hooks. lead singer reminded me of singer from Guided By Voices because of his puffy curly moptop   The Demons : i got to BOTH early, and these dudes totally stuck out, walking around. they were completely rockabillied out:  rolled denim cuffs, pompadours with sides slicked back, chain wallets, coasters,  grommeted belts, and cowboy shirts. and they had a suspiciously large amount of male jewelry: pierced ears, big silver rings. they looked like a 50s gang the way their style was clonish and cartoonish... a big gay gang. and they were all very handsome: strong jawlines, aquiline noses, symmetrical faces. Where were they from? why were they dressed so similarly? were they a boy band? were they homos?   The answer: they're from Sweden. Ah, I SEE. They were not homos after all, but EUROS. I was excited, because I love The Hives and The Sounds, but The Demons... were just okay. They played fast rock that bordered on punk. But their songs were too long. Each song should not have exceeded 2 minutes, but they did, and that sucked. Though they made me laugh because occasionally between-songs they would whip out a comb from their back pocket and comb back the sides of their hair. It was so West Side Story and so, so gay. I mean,  Euro .   Starlight Desperation  - I'd seen these guys open for The Kills a few months back and I remember being bored by the self-indulgent posturings of the lead singer. I was annoyed by his swagger and hip swiveling. This time around, I really enjoyed their set. They were as tight as can be and fun to watch. I don't know whether it's been my subjection to so many bad bands, but Starlight Desperation was like a fresh Q-tip in my dusty ears. The guitarist on the left was pale and waxy like a corpse. The singer reminded me of Bon Jovi with his tousled shaggy hair and chiseled features but W-gal saw him as Mick Jagger. He does have a big mouth and big lips.   Detroit Cobras : I thought they were awesome: swampy and soulful with a sexy hip-shakin booty-jigglin lead singer. She reminded me of Bette Midler the way she'd sass the band and the audience, but the difference is, she wasn't cheesy. She called us motherfuckers and rolled her eyes a lot. Maybe too much. Turns out she hated San Francisco, hated BOTH, hated the audience, thought we were zombies, and finally, declared the show terrible and stated that the shows they play in SF always fall flat. "The San Francisco curse" she called it. She had a great low smoky voice and she could really belt out the songs, but to insult the people who are your bread and butter? That is uncouth. I went with the intention of buying some CDs, but decided against it in the end because I felt jilted. I also thought about how I just dropped $200 on Coachella tickets.

       Noisepop Day 1: The Unicorns @ GAMH   I got there early because I wanted to hear the opening bands. I figured, Kevin Arnold (Noisepop Big Cheese) would not be unkind. He would open my ears to new bands and enrich my life. There were three bands that opened and here's my synopsis:  Restiform Bodies: Crap Irving: Crap Why?: Total Crap  I bear with crap because once in a while an opening band will rock my socks off and steal my heart. Examples: Bart Davenport, The Lovemakers, and Adam Green. If I hadn't arrived early to see these openers, my life would have remained shallow and meaningless. Not true last night. Last night the openers made me question my existence and why was I not snuggled up in the warmth and pillowy softness of my bed? Why... am I here? Why... am I being subjected to this crappy music made by egocentric and charmless indie guys? In the spirit of description and long-windedness here's an elaboration of the umbrella term "crap":   Restiform Bodies : Musically, they were like Gold Chains, but without the balance of a female voice to counter the testosterone. Essentially, RB is a white guy indie-rapper with dexterous and quick rhythmic rhymes. He had good flow, but not much range or performance. He wasn't magnetic or compelling, he was just there. White guy indie-rapper, what is it about you that'll make me take note? What differentiates you from the rest of your brood? It's not that I need a schtick, it's that I prefer to watch people with fire or hunger in their eyes. This guy was able but he didn't have a driving message or a palpable connection with the audience. He didn't need us, and so, it was torturous.   Irving  -- 5 skinny indie guys with overgrown mussy hair and scruffy faces. They started off singing a sweet 3 part-harmony that was fey and soothing, but 8 measures in, they turned it into a screechy wall of adrenalinized noise. Guys. Why do they always have to assert their masculinity? Why do they have to ruin good songs by putting up a wall? Literally and sonically? It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to sing sweet songs. I understand what they were trying to do: subvert conventional songwriting structure, continuity, and mood by juxtaposing sweet and light with heavy and charged, but they didn't do it intelligently. It wasn't balanced. They had some songs that were ditty-like and playful, but seriously, they need to practice more. They weren't tight and lacked cohesion. The best description I have for Irving is that they are 3 lead singers in one band. 3 run-of-the-mill, middle-of-the-indie-road lead singers.   Why?  - This band was tight. They were cohesive and focused. I just didn't like their music. The singer is passionate, but the crazy kind where you want to leave the premesis because you will get hurt. He spat a lot when he sang and during one song he went spastic and purposely smacked his head with his fist. He was full of self-loathing rage. Kind of like Oliver from "The O.C." Out-of-control and dangerous to himself and the people in front. Does lead singer also snort coke and tote guns? Where does reality end and TV begin? I can't remember what the music was like. I just remember tuning out and thinking why was I at this show when I could be at home listening to The Unicorns.    The Unicorns  - I endured 3 hours of sonic hooey to get to these guys, and it was worth it. It was worth the 3 hours of wasted non-refundable time. They came out barefoot and dressed in pink stage costumes. The keyboardist had a pink polyester cape with brown fur collar with matching pink pants. He wore a white shirt with pink suspenders. The guitarist wore brown pants with a regular belt and a pink fabric belt below it. He had no shirt on but wore a pink tie. The shirtlessness didn't disturb me because he looked like a 10-year old boy: small, pale, and undeveloped. There was a drummer too but he was a putz. I forgot what he wore.  They're fresh-faced and so young. The blurb in the noisepop program said they're straight out of high school, but they look straight out of grammar school. Once they started playing though, I was in heaven. If this is the future of rock, the future is in good hands. They're babies, but they're precocious, wise, sentimental, and enormously talented. Seeing them was like witnessing history. I was in the front row and they were alive and energetic and present in every song. How can a sound that's so relevant and versatile and perfect come out of these babies? Why is it that these Canadian boys can let down their defenses and sing without contrivance or a sarcastic sneer? There was no posturing, just silly fun, and great great music.

       Trouble in Mind Blues  I broke down in a rather pathetic fashion three times today. First time was in the car on my way to pick up dinner, for no reason at all. Second time was after my ex-boyfriend B and I decided that it would be best if we never see each other again, ever. Third time was five minutes ago when I put the backpack on too see how heavy it is and one of the plastic straps snapped. I don't know if it's because I don't sleep anymore and it's catching up with me or because I've been working a lot or because I'm scared of spending three days keeping up with boys. So I bawl for a while, make sure I get really ugly, and then laugh at the absurdity of it all. Cracking up. I think that may be what is happening. Today I wrote one of those mandatory pre-vacation emails at work to [#everyone]. It said "I will be gone from 2/27 until 1/2. Please see *** and *** for all your marketing needs". Then, realizing my mistake with the dates, I wrote again to [#everyone] saying "Sorry. I meant 2/27 until 2/2"..Then Rami wrote me "Abby, you meant until 3/2". Yes, I did. But at that point I didn't want to have to write yet another email to #everyone confirming my stupidity. Then I made about 234,542 more mistakes.  Wendy's memorial finally happened . We went to Farallon for lunch. Dr. Bossman's only rule was that we couldn't take any of our food to go as Wendy would have. We had to finish our plates. On the way there K and I worried that it would be a depressing, drawn out affair, but it actually turned out to be quiet light-hearted and dare I say, fun. There were even anorexia jokes flying around. Apparently her death is still pending even though she's been dead for over a month. Her sister is having a problem obtaining the death certificate.  OK. I better finish packing now.

      I just got this in my work email (it's from a word processor):   In order to serve you better, I’ll be off at 5pm to fetch my stylish new lenses (the better to see your typos and grammatical horrors with).  As they’re progressive lenses, I’ve been warned that I will likely be missing curbs, steps, and corners of walls for the next few days as I adjust from the 20-y.o. tortoise-shell atrocities that currently adorn my visage.  Then again, this sort of careening is nothing new for me.  See you (better) tomorrow…

       T Minus 3  I curse myself every Saturday morning as I wake up at 8 to go to draping class. I'm usually up by then anyway (sometimes as early as 6), but it's a whole different ballgame having to drive all the way to Hunters Point and be creative for 5 hours while trying not to poke myself with pins. Luckily, Derek the instructor know all this, so we watch a runway show for 20 minutes to get 'warmed up'. Then it's back to dress forms, pleats, flares and my personal favorite, apexes. When he talks about mannequin boobs, he makes little circles around the nipples of his dress form as Katherine and I try to contain our laughter.  That's because we're in love with him. No, it's not a seam ripper in my pants, I'm happy to see you, my sexy fashion deity. He knows that to be truly creative, one needs inspiring music in the background. So he puts on Madonna's Like a Virgin Tour video and I don't need caffeine anymore (last week it was Janet Jackson, another excellent choice).    After my class, I stop by my parents' house. Mumsy is terrified that I will die on my trip to the Grand Canyon this weekend. I quote Dr. Phil and tell her she's only scared because she doesn't know anything about backpacking or the GC. Let's go online and I'll show you. Bad idea. Mom doesn't bother to read the small print so, instead, she looks at the photo of a man dying of dehydration and the words "Don't Let This Happen To You" written above the photograph. She gasps and starts beating Alex (my dad) with a newspaper, screaming "It's all your fault!! She got this stupid idea from you!!" (in russian it sounds much more dramatic). Alex and I laugh because the only time we bond is when we conspire to torture my poor mother. "Maybe it'll be icy enough that I can just slide all the way down", I say. My mom's eyes sadden as she looks at us, her tormentors. "If you freeze, you won't have to hike up" he says. We laugh some more. "Oh, for fuck's sake, get over it. It'll be fine. Millions of people go every year. And thousands come back. What's the worst thing that could possibly happen?" That's another cue for us to laugh...and for me to leave because I can feel an onset of a panic attack, being at my folks' place for over 30 minutes now. I sqeeze my mom tight and thank her for the food. "I'll be okay. I promise. I think."  So yes, the trip. I'm excited. Mostly because I spent $250 on gear this weekend. M & I put up my brand new tent in the living room when we got home and I made him hang out inside with me as I worked on the rubik's cube. We argued only 3 times this weekend, our record. One of those fights occurred because I revealed to him the very unflattering name I've been calling him to all my friends for the past 2 years. He got angry and I felt guilty, so I offered to drive him to Chinatown to take photos for his assignment. I hung out with homeless people near the playground as he took photos from the top floor of the Holiday Inn. I looked up every once in a while to see his flash go off in the sky.   Ok. I better go. The hair dye needs to be washed off and I have another ten hour workday tomorrow.

       Juxtapoz    On Thursday night XX dragged me out to the 111 Minna gallery for a party thrown by Juxtapoz magazine. I was stoned out of my mind because when I got home from work I ate a small pot brownie leftover from Jason's (Green Marble's bf) foray into the "medicinal" culinary arts. When XX called to ask if I was ready, I said, "Sure, just knock on my door." But in my paranoia I asked, "But how will I know that it's you?"  "I'll do 'Shave and a Haircut'." "Okay."        "No, Indian!"   "Indian?" "You know,  KNOCK -knock-knock-knock- KNOCK -knock-knock-knock."   I laughed for a long long time. I can't tell if it was really that funny or if I was just really stoned.  The Juxtapoz event was full of artful-looking people. Fashionistas and fashionistos. Hipsters, mods, rockabillies, gothics, and all sorts of stimulating eye candy. I was high on pharmaceuticals so it was fun to look at everyone and what everyone was wearing. There was a small cabin built inside the space that had some art pieces hung up inside. In general, there wasn't that much art, like paintings and drawings, to look at. The real art that night was the people that came and turned out.   Everyone looked fantastic and great to see and observe. It wasn't full of models, but just regular weirdos styled and coiffed and dressed to the 9s. It was pretty laid back too. People didn't look at each other with haughtiness or condescension, but with curiosity. I feel like a pansy for saying it this way, but the gaze that night was one of respectful awe, much like how you'd approach viewing a painting or a sculpture. Perhaps everyone was so starved to see art that instead, we turned our sights on each other.   There must still be bud in my veins.

      Noisepop, here I come!  Next week is noisepop and boy, am I jazzed! Here's the list of the shows I will be attending. 4 nights, 4 shows in a row. Holy Jesus, arrest me, I am criminally insane:  Wed -- The Unicorns @ GAMH -- I'm excited about this show because they're a new band, but their album blows my mind. It's a delightful-edgy-beautiful-pretty-heartstring-tugging album that is sweet and quirky like The Flaming Lips, angular and bouncy like Hot Hot Heat, and with melodically prominent basslines like The Cure. The singing is sometimes soft and whispery like Elliott Smith, sometimes resigned and thoughtful like Grandaddy, sometimes frustrated and loud and yelpy like Steve Bays/ Robert Smith.  The album is tinged with an overall child-like charm and earnestness like the Langley School Music Project but with an adult consciousness. (Example: my favorite lyric: "Somewhere in the asshole of my eye/")   It's also a little Thriller by Michael Jackson in one song that has a comic-creepy Vincent Price-like voiceover. The album is wonderful and I'm hoping the show will be too.  Thursday -- Detroit Cobaras @ BOTH -- I have never heard them. I'm going because the Von Bondies like them and so does Meg White. It's already sold out! I have a feeling this show is going to be good.  Friday -- The Stills @ The Independent -- I saw them at Popscene last year, and they opened for Echo & The Bunnymen, so why is this show being promoted as their "Bay Area debut"? I was divided between this show and seeing Neko Case at Bimbo's, but The Stills won because it's 8 bucks cheaper. And it's closer to my house.  Saturday -- Communique @ BOTH. I'm dragging XX to this show with me. The headlining band is The Wrens, whom I've heard lotsa good things about. I'm going for the opening band, Communique, who are quite good. I like bands that dress in all-black and have solid dark dirgy music with melodic basslines(Interpol, BRMC, Communique). Though this formula seems idiot-proof, some fuck it up and make it a mockery, like one godawful band called MADELIA who are unintentional parodies that make shitty music. They're all posturing and artifice and are generally a horrible superficial band that do not rock. And they're serious about it! No tongues in cheeks. I've had the misfortune of having to see them twice. I left halfway the first time, and the following time I saw them take the stage, I ran for the door.   The great thing about living in San Francisco is that all the bands I love come to me. Even if a band is doing a 7-city American tour, they always hit SF. And I don't have to drive from fucking, like, Monterey to see them. Everything's just a bus ride away, so in regards to bands? Life is good.

       El Ex   On Sunday night I hung out with Dizzy D. at a small dinner party his co-worker held. Afterwards we took a cab to Market St. and he walked me to my busstop. He was mostly quiet and occasionally he would attempt banal conversation: "So what have you been up to? What's happening in your life?" I found it appalling because he doesn't talk that way. I didn't want to make him feel awkward, so I played along: "Oh, the usual --  job stress, whatever." When the bus came, I hugged him goodbye, but he just stood like a statue and looked at me. I remembered that this is how he (non)hugs his friends. I said, "Fine then, be that way!" as I clapped his back comically and boarded the bus. During the ride home I concluded that he is difficult to be friends with and I wasn't going to further waste my time.  Monday morning he wrote me an email saying that he saw "Maps" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs on MTV and it made him sad. He wrote that he missed me and still thinks I'm the most wonderful girl in the world. I cried at my desk because I didn't want this to happen. I didn't want to hurt anyone. But I wrote back and said that he is just feeling sad and nostalgic, and that it's okay to feel this way. I remind him that I'm an impatient bitch and a racist and that we didn't have anything in common and we never hung out with each other outside the apartment. I remind him that he didn't like any of the music that I played while we were living together and this included the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. I don't remind him of how he would always borrow money from me, point out my pot belly, or not allow me to have male friends.  He wrote back and said thanks for the reply, then chided me for having to work on a holiday: "Do the savages at your company not understand the sanctity of President's Day?" he quipped. Cheeky bastard.   I'm Dizzy's first adult gf and I want him to look back on this experience as the best break-up ever. If he had gfs before me, he'd have been able to recognize the signs of a stagnant relationship. Truthfully, if I hadn't met XX, Dizzy and I could have been together for a couple more years. But those years would've filled me with angst, irritation, and annoyance. I would've found any reason to delay coming home and any excuse to leave the house. These days I'm perfectly content coming home to an empty room with sounds of roommates coming from up the spiral staircase.

       Larva  I've been having pregnant dreams lately. The latest one was two days ago. In it, I was in a doctor's office, explaining to him my concerns regarding a lump on the left side of my stomach. He looked at me sternly and said "It's either a baby or cancer. Only time will tell". In my dream this made perfect sense so I went to my dream home and waited for 'it' to grow. About 5 seconds later I felt a little baby kicking at which point I thought to myself that regardless of whether I opted for the baby or an abortion, a miserable experience was ahead, so I might as well raise the little bastard.   When I wake up I wonder if having pregnant dreams is my body's way of telling me that there's a little M junior in the oven. Kind of like when I tell myself to wake up at 6 tomorrow and my body wakes me up on time without alarms. Because that (along with eating buffalo wings and cookies every day) would explain my recent weight gain. Despite being 25, if I got pregnant now, it would still feel like a teenage pregnancy. Luckily, M offered to punch me really hard in the stomach if that were to ever happen.

       The Loved Ones   On V-day XX took me to see my #2 man Bart Davenport play with his band, The Loved Ones at Slim's. BartD was up to all his usual kooky onstage antics. He did the splits, the fingerwags, the doublespins, the nose pinches, the helicoptering his jacket...   I have seen him a total of 6 times. This is more than I have seen anyone ever. I am officially crazy. I need to know where he lives and if he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. And if I can't have him, (pull out my gun here) NO ONE will! (female screams. BartD looks terrified but still manages to pinch his nose and kick the air.)  Yesterday I spent two hours hanging out on my bathmat reading design books. Green Marble crept down to look for DVDS and I was like, "Hi!" She looked at me like I was weird and said, "How long have you been down here?" and I chirped, "Oh, like, 2 hours!" She said, "What are you doing?" and I said, "Oh, reading. And hiding."   My bathmat is fuzzy and brand new. My bathroom is clean and well-lit. Hemingway knew the importance of these attributes -- it's a good place for reading. Also, I am becoming a hermit. I am shunning my bigger room for the pod which is my bathroom.  I like to think of it as my secret clubhouse.

       The Oracle Sez   Abby, sounds like you need a break. Also, you're smarter, worldlier, wiser, and funnier than M. You may be with him for another day or another decade, but there are a zillion other better-constructed and lower-maintenance doods out there. In my humble opinion, the beauty of men is their simplicity, loyalty, dependability, and supportiveness. They're not supposed to be whiny pouty bitches! At least, not in public. Don't tell M, but his occasional bouts of poutiness make him a big fat GIRL. How's he supposed to care for you when he's busy whimpering about his wounds?  Unrelated, I read today that Star Jones has 500 pairs of shoes. She had a special closet built into her apartment to house and display her shoes, like art, she said. That is not insane. To me, that is perfectly rational and a mark of absolute lucidity. I'm set on expanding my own collection by three pairs.  I've rid myself of 2 pairs, so I deserve a reward. Rewards in the form of red wedges, gold flower sandals, and scalloped black pumps. Who needs men, really, when there are so many wonderful shoes in the world?

      You know how secretaries are stereotyped as constantly insolently filing their nails? Well, it's the 2000s, and it's time for a new occupational stereotype. On observing myself, I would like to say that the secretary of the new millenium neglects her nails in favor of surfing the web for shoes.   Women! You can't live with em, you can't get your post-its without em.

      Over beers at the hawaiian diner around the corner, M told me about how some girl tried to pick up on him yesterday. "She was like 'Are you going home?' and I was like 'No, I'm going to my car.' and she was like 'Where's you car?"...blah blah blah.. "So did you get her number?" I asked. "No. I would have if I wasn't seeing you. I always get picked up on when I'm seeing someone." Oh really? Well, bitch! "This one guy left a business card in my shoe this past weekend and this other one asked if I wanted to kiss him while we were on the lift" (as a joke because we both had extra onions on our burgers for lunch, but I didn't mention that part).  We get jealous easily and know that sooner or later this will blow up in our face so we use these petty stories as artillery in the silent war of 'who got the better deal in this relationship'. We sat there pissed off and quiet for a while, him stuffing his face with a burger, me staring out the window. Then he said "For our trip we should get those sleeping bags that zip together" and in our own sick twisted way, I knew things were back to normal.  In other news - I woke up with a black eye this morning. I don't know if it's from boarding or iron dificiency or if someone hit me without me knowing it. Right now it's more reddish-purple, but I think it will go through other colors and eventually hit black. I'm wearing it proudly like a badge or a Bart Davenport pin.

       Weekend (Long-Winded) Synopsis   On  Friday  night XX and I cruised around Alameda after work looking for the Lucky 13 bar. He made a lot of U-turns and sped through yellow lights while I marvelled at the majestic and chimerical Victorians. My sole life plan is to eventually live in a Queen Anne victorian in Alameda and drive a Lincoln Continental or an old-timey Caddy. I told XX that I like the Queen Anne's whimsical pointed turret and he mused that it would make a great writing nook. I scoffed at his idea and said there could be a nook only if there's space left under the awesome candelabra. In my future house I plan to have a weather vane, wooden owls, and a ghost. But only if it's friendly and likes to conserve energy by turning off the lights AFTER I'm already asleep. And no howling.   I don't know how, but after crisscrossing the city a couple times and circling around its perimeter, we arrived at the bar. We had a few drinks, a couple piroshkis, then headed to the Alameda Auction House, a second-run movie theater, to watch "Rififi." I have two current cine short-term goals: one is to watch the entire oeuvre of Tim Burton and identify style and recurrent themes, and the second is to familiarize myself with the French New Wave. Rififi was good, but I dozed off for a bit because of the lethal combo of fatigue + 1 beer. The really riveting part about the movie is a long segment when there is no talking and no music, only gangsters working quickly and in complete total silence. The understimulus is compelling.    Saturday  I watched cooking shows on PBS and made two pots of chicken stock. Then I walked down to Clement St. and bought lots of dim sum for myself at the bakery. Each time I go, I like to try something new. There is this one odd dim sum item that is my current fave:  sweet bread laced with creamy mayonnaise and topped with wispy dried pork and bits of green onions. I don't know the name, but its description made XX blanch and confirmed my status as a thrill-seeking fatass.   At night we went to the Chinese New Year Parade at Union Square. XX brought his Super 8 camera to capture some footage for a future film, but we couldn't get a good spot. It was crowded and in the thinnest sections, 4 people deep. He held the camera above his head and hoped for the best. The parade was spectacular. There were gilded monkeys, long jewel-toned chinese dragons slinking along in S-shapes, noisy smoky firecrackers, lovely beauty queens, male cheerleaders, the KTVU news team, marching bands, and marching kids.  One elementary school had little kids dressed up as Italian tables with red checkered tablecloths, some walking pizza slices, and a little chef with a big poufy hat. I got a little choked up because it was so silly and wonderful and cute. Later on in the parade, there were little kids dressed up as firecrackers, puttering around, and having to turn their entire firecracker bodies if they wanted to look to the side or talk to their firecracker friends. XX leaned down and said in genuine honesty that he gets a little misty too, but not when he sees people dressed like pizza or explosives, but when he sees retarded kids. I was like, "What?" and he just shrugged, eyes starting to glisten. I was like, "I don't see no retarded kids! Where are they? Where are you looking?!" and he ignored me, thinking about some other time, some other parade that had retarded kids.    Sunday  I went to brunch sans Abby (boohoo), Urban Outfitters, and a surprise birthday party. XX went to the party with me and afterwards we ordered Chinese food and hung out at my house. He hasn't travelled much lately because of my petulance and whining, but is on the road again this week and frankly, I'm relieved. After hanging out allthetime with him, I'm crabby. I used to think it was cute when he'd fall on his rump, or trip, or drop things, or spill things, but now, it's grating my nerves. And like the bitch I can be, I let him know.   Yesterday night, he knocked over the fried rice container and spilled food across the table. I pointed out that he is clumsy. Later on that night, he spilled some beer on himself and so, I point out that he is klutzy. Post-coitus, I ask him to reach over and get me a napkin, so he rolls over and in slow motion his arms flail, his legs kick up, he reaches out for something, anything, to save himself... he grabs my metal, hot, free-standing radiator... he lands with a crash on the clown tray that I keep by my bed... the pitcher of water on it tumbles off and spills... I am not amused, but all I hear is his loud raucous laughter from the floor. He gets up and is embarrassed but chuckling. He has ruined the mood. I do not feel like cuddling or coming. I want him to leave.   He puts his clothes back on and in putting on his jacket, all the contents of his pockets manage to free themselves and tumble to the floor... cigarettes, keys... he looks up and shushes me before I sigh or scream. We say goodbye, and when the door shuts, the air is still and calm. I sleep soundly. In the morning, I wake up and turn on the light. On the floor, in pieces, is the ceramic dish that I made in high school -- the only piece from my ceramics class that was worth keeping...  But it's unimportant. When I was in high school I used to think how unfair it was that we couldn't take our possessions with us when we die. Our collections we worked so hard to amass become divided again. Our clothes and things we treasured and valued get sold or given away.... My thinking has changed since then. What I once considered an injustice is now a blessing because in the end, the material becomes immaterial. We leave our bodies behind and go someplace else. And when that journey begins, who the heck wants to pack?   But on a second note, I am XX-proofing my room. Before he comes back, I'm going to wrap everything in bubble wrap and marshmallows. Though the price of sex may be shattered pottery, I like to bargain, and I'm gonna try very hard to get my lovin pro boner, I mean, bono.

       Food Plans  My "Lunch in Tow for 2004 (4 pronounced fow)" has turned into "Shopping from the Freezer is a Breezer". You see, I had this great plan to start bringing lunch to work every day - I even purchased a Costco shitload of tupperware. I figured I'll eat healthier, spend less and feel really good about myself. But then I realized  that it's never going to happen. Because I am too lazy/busy to plan ahead and I HATE leftovers. So instead, I will now get my lunch from the freezer at Walgreens across the street. Usually I pay at least $7 for my mid-day face-stuffing. These little frozen creations run only $2-3 and require no planning. And  little  is the operative word. Today I had Lean Cuisine Swedish Meatballs & Pasta, which I rate 3 out of 5 stars. It lacked salt and the portion was too small. Instead of Lean, they should call it Tiny Cuisine as I could have easily polished off three of those. But not bad as far as reconstituted meat is concerned.   I just told Jann, my work mama, about my plan and she is horrified. She's throwing grapefruit slices across the divide. I think I also heard her say "I would rather die than eat that shit." That's ok, I'm not offended. I secretly think she's jealous of my plans to get Stouffer's Mac 'N Cheese tomorrow.

       Full of Air  During my mom's birthday dinner, I sat at the table and chatted with my brother's gf, while we waited for him to arrive.  I was complaining about how I'm trying to single-handedly finish this half-gallon of milk that expires in two days. I was like, "Oy, I put it in my cereal, I drink it with some coffee for flavor, but oof, all that milk just makes me so BLOATED!" Then this woman at a nearby table turns abruptly and shoots a disapproving glare in my general direction. She wasn't ballsy enough to look me directly in the eye, but shoots her pissy pussface look at the somewhat area of maybe my table. Apparently, she was an old crone-hag whose meal was soured by my indigestion.  I know I was in a restaurant. But who wants to make boring genteel talk, when there are more urgent matters to address, namely lactose intolerance? What is so wrong with the word BLOATED? I didn't use gasssy, I didn't use fartarded, I didn't use monster poot. I was just trying to make some pre-dinner conversation before our appetizers. Is that so wrong?    And, if she wants to get all Miss Manners-y, she herself should ascribe to the #1 adage of politeness: "Mind one's own beeswax!"

      ~*~*~*~*  Post-Lunch Slump  I'm drinking coffee because I stared into space long enough for drool to accumulate in my mouth and start making its escape onto my keyboard. Ten minutes later and the top of my head feels tingly and light and I can hear blood speeding through my body, all the way to my fingertips. I haven't had caffeine in years so I hope it will feel like crack very soon. I'm tired and sleepy because I forced myself to walk up the stairs instead of taking the elevator. I made it to floor 8 out of 17. With my big-heeled patent leather mary janes, it felt like climbing the everest. I was supposed to go to the gym this morning and work out properly like I said I would, but there was a naked boy in my bed and I couldn't get up until 5 minutes before my bus was scheduled to depart. So instead I went up the stairs twice and figured it equivalent to 20 minutes on the dreaded stair-master..  Over lunch my fellow downtown corporate whore homo friend Dirk and I compared our relationships. His long-distance boyfriend plays passive-aggressive mind games over the phone. My pseudo-sweetheart communicates too well about things that offend me "Yes, the last girlfriend didn't do much for me. It was a fetish thing." Dirk's Jake is obsessed with pop music to the point of absurdity. M is obsessed with oversimplifying people. And porn. We agreed that we have to accept these drawbacks for the positive attributes of our (in)significant others. Or good sex.. I told Dirk that all of my troubles would be solved if M was a deaf-mute. Maybe we can reach some sort of a compromise. I’ll grow my hair long if he stops talking.

       The Man is Trying to Kill the Love   Today I found out that I have to sit at reception from 12pm-1pm to cover the receptionist's lunch break from now until eternity. That is usually my break. That is usually XX's break. That is usually the 1 hour island of time that I get to gaze fondly into XX's eyes while stuffing my face with food: my two favorite things to do.   But I'm not worried. Because in the end, love conquers all. And by love, I mean carnal desire.

       Pointy Shoes   The joy of pointy shoes is that it is like walking around with two extra fingers positioned in the middle of your feet. Your feet are extended by at least 1 full inch. So far, the only thing I can do with these shoes on is turn on my computer while sitting in my chair. (I do not have to stoop below my desk and manually push the power button.) I'm sure there are other hidden functions that these shoes can perform. I will wait and see.

      |*|*|*|*|    20 minutes ago  I stumble into the kitchen with one eye open, my ripped up red coat still on, clutching my tea mug. Ron is cream cheesing a toasted bagel.  ron: good morning me: grunt.. me: thanks for the bagel.  ron: is that how much you like on there? me: yeah. now hurry it up. i'm technically still asleep. ron: we don't pay you to sleep. me: actually you do. it's in my contract. ron: that explains a lot with the kind of work you've been turning in. me: i'm not taking this crap. i'm going back to where people like me.  walk back to my cube where justin is blasting on my dinky computer speakers.  jann (50-something Fijian cube neighbor, my work mom): turn it up, tania (i mean abby)!  justin: Go on and just cry me a river, girl!

       5 days, 5 shows Round-up   Yee-haw! I am fatigued from my show ho binge-ing, but I do it all in the name of excavation and scoutsmanship. Here are my findings:  Wednesday 01-28  Yellow Press/ Fiery Furnaces/ Ted Leo @ BOTH    YP : I wasn't paying attention.    Fiery Furnaces : I liked the basic song structures and the tinkly piano, but Eleanor's voice was weak. She was a poor man's Janis Joplin. She had the conviction, the lyrics, the melodies, and the phrasings, but lacked the howl and growl of a true blueswoman. There was also a  majorly annoying, cacophonous electronic keyboardist to the right of the stage who'd ruin the songs with his awful blasts of noisy crap. R-guy liked them though,  and bought their CD. Were we at the same show?   Ted Leo : Good songs, devoted fans. This guy can fucking sweat! He wore a black button-down shirt which was soaked through with the buckets of perspiration careening out of his pores. I would not want to have sex with him. To the right, was a cute bass-player. He was very young, maybe 20, and he looked like a mini-Stroke. Cool style, cool poufy hair, like a cleaner-cut Albert Hammond, Jr.... But was he so clean? R-guy's friend noted that he was tweaked out on cocaine. He looked fine to me. But then again, the only symptoms I can register of coke usage is incessant meaningless chatter, and one's inattention to one's own frizzed out messy hair, and/or inadvertently undone shoe straps while one is dancing in a swaying a-rhythmic non-style.   Thursday 01-29  BartD/ Duvall/ The Cuts @ Cafe du Nord    BartD.  -- see review from previous post.   Duvall  -- This is Josh from Smoking Popes. Now he's in a trio without his brothers. If you liked The S-Popes, then you will like this. The songs are the same, but less frenzied and frenetic. Less punk, more post-punk, if you understand that at all. Same lyrical content -- simple ditties about love and longing, same tuneful poppy melodies, and same careful slightly nasal Morrisey-like singing. Last time I saw Josh was at a Smoking Popes show a decade ago and I remember he was thin with a shaved head and upturned impish nose (like the Quentin Blake illustration of a witch in Roald Dahl's "The Witches"). Now he's older, a bit heavier, and with hair. Same nose, though.  The drummer was a big fat fuck. He was probably one of those twins on motorcycles in The Guinness Book of World Records. He was huge, and he had a full beard. He was a sight for sore eyes because indie shows are populated with wan skeletal boys. This drummer was a man. In fact, I think he was two men.   Friday 01-30  Mellodrone/ Metric/ South @ Slim's    Mellodrone  -- missed him because my disco nap took on a life of its own. ( I was late.)   Metric  -- Female-fronted poppy new wave band. She looks like Winona Ryder with a touch of Famke Janssen. Classically pretty, high cheekbones, but small and pixie-ish. Aesthetically, the band reminded me of No Doubt. Older funky guys with weird hair who need their share of attention, but they ain't gettin any! The focus is all on the girl. Musically, the singing and phrasing is like Catatonia -- girlish, pure, and cute, with but not in a cloying way like Letters to Cleo. The girl plays synth keyboards and dances around to songs such as "Dead Disco" and "Combat Baby", two particularly bouncy tunes. They're like The Sounds, but not as blatantly 80s, but also less anthemically addictive. Metric is a little bit The Sounds, a little bit Bis, a little Komeda, and a lot Catatonia.  Audience complaint: I counted four baseball caps (actual sports logos, not trucker caps), two of them backwards! It was a people stew of middle-of-the-road sensibilities. There was a lack of eye candy. It was the opposite. XX calls it "eye garlic."   I attribute my audience complaint to the headlining band,  South . They are middle-of-the-road blokes from England. Their songs are melodic and uplifting and pretty and they sound much like another melodic, uplifting, and pretty middle-of-the-road band from England: Coldplay. The lead singer of South even looks like Chris Martin in that shaggy unshaved college boy t-shirt-and-khakis way. There is nothing wrong with this. It's just not for me. If you adore Coldplay, you will adore South. I don't adore Coldplay, so I think South is just okay.   Saturday 1/31  Elio Estevez/ Dynasty Handbag/ Coachwhips/ Numbers    Elio  -- Is Elio the guy in The Evening with the diabolical kidnap-the-girl-then-tie-her-to-the-railroad-tracks moustache? Are they one and the same? They had the same cookie duster, that's for sure. Elio is electroclash. One artfuck performer and his computer. He was wearing leather bondage pants with crisscross ties all up the sides. He was entertaining in that artfuck performance art kind of way.   Dynasty Handbag  -- Another electroclash artfuck. I don't hate electroclash. I love Tracy & the Plastics, Peaches, and Chicks on Speed, but there are just some bandwagoneers who are mediocre. Musically, that is. Her performance was entertaining: it's one girl and her computer and she came on with big early-90s teased hair, Yoko Ono wraparound sunglasses, a black ill-fitting baggy tent dress, and sandal flats with gold links and beads as the thong part. Very "Ban de Soleil", very ironic. Also ironic was the purse she wore the entire time, as part of her ensemble: it was one of those 80s Chanel knockoffs -- a black quilted rectangle with a long gold chain as the strap which she wore diagonally, artillery style. She was alright, music not tight, so I said goodnight. A couple days later I saw a review of Dynasty Handbag's record in Venus magazine, and on the cover of the album were 3 girls. Where were the other two on Saturday? I want my $$'s worth!     Coachwhips  -- They were excellent, as always. They played on the floor in the audience, as they always do, which sucks now because as they gain popularity, there are more dumb boys recklessly crashing into each other than fancy ladies dancing hard. The show was sold out, so that added to the chaos -- the packed crowd and the non-space to non-dance. Their set was too short and I regret that they didn't have any CDs to sell at the merch table. They were tasty and satisfying!   Numbers  -- They're hot with the hipsters and it was their record release. I wanted very badly to like them, but I was falling asleep! The music was loud and blaring within the confines of the squished club, but they didn't move my body the way The Coachwhips did. I wanted to like them because they're influenced by Gang of Four, but just because a band likes Gang of Four doesn't guarantee booty-shaking funk-nastiness. After the first song, which was pretty good, the rest of their songs sounded the same, with the same rhythms and drum patterns so this created a lulling effect for sleepy Batty. Batty want to say "nightie." Batty broke her all-time record of show-going: 5 shows, 5 days. Batty will never do this again... not for a long while, anyway... ZZZzzzzzzzzz.

       Sunrise, Sunset   My honey (as my co-worker R calls him to my dismay) is back, but he's going away again this summer. This time for three months to Wisconsin for a photojournalism internship. He wants me to drive out there with him. It will take us five days and we will stay in motels of my choice. I'm looking forward to the roadtrip but wonder what will happen when he's gone that long. A month wasn't bad, but three might be a bit much, no? And then I think, who knows if we'll even be together by that time, anyway.   It was awkward for a few minutes when he came over, us relating as bf/gf, more solemn and timid than we used to as friends. I tried not to make fun of him as much, seeing as he's more sensitive about it now and he refrained from doing anything asshole-esque. He laughed at my idea of us spending stupid Valentine's Day at home watching tv as 'letting the romance die too soon'. But I'm vehemently opposed to getting a mud bath, so we'll have to compromise somewhere in the middle.  He lost some weight and got darker. When I hug him, my small arms go all the way around his waist. He brought me trinkets from San Salvador and Antigua and agreed to get a donkey for the Grand Canyon trip. I gave him a book that he doesn't already have (which I purchased with the Stacey's gift card I found on the street) and I am almost done with his scarf. I looked at his photostory of the family who lives in a cemetery and told him of my recent visits to the factory. It's been 14 whole hours and we haven't fought once.

       Nothing Exciting  I was thinking - why do I have this instinctual need to smile at people in my company as they pass by? It's a girl thing, right - we are socialized to look friendly and non-threatening. My April resolution is to stop doing it. We'll see how that goes.  In other news, I'm putting my shopping freeze on freeze as I've decided to get my very own IPod (with my tax return money). The toughest part is figuring out what to engrave on it.  Talked to grammy a few seconds ago. She's having her annual Passover dinner next week and wanted to make sure I can make it. I asked how she was feeling. She said she was getting ready for death, but now that my brother got into a good school, she's collected strength and has made a decision to live a bit longer. She asked me if I have a boyfriend and if he treats me well. The last thing she said was that I should trade time spent with friends for some ambition and drive. Oh, granny granny, how much I love you and how you drive me crazy.  Tonight Batty and I are checking out Nellie McKay at the Independent. She seems cooky and original. Should be an interesting show.

       urlLink The Liars  @ BOTH 03-30-04     Opener:  urlLink Young People   Young People: trio of 2 guitarists and a female singer who sometimes plays minimal drums, sometimes minimal bass. She'll sing a beautiful line then tap once on a cymbal; sing a line, then lightly strike her tom. She'll pluck two notes on her bass for every verse. It was quite lovely, actually. She sang like a lark over her cohorts' noisy fuzzy guitars, and the songs were short. (Never a bad thing.)  The Liars: Agnus Andrew is one nasty MF. He was absolutely repulsive in a gross non-charming way. Dirty stringy hair, dirty clothes, dirty everything. He was a hobo-clown in his strange dirty attire too. He wore a lavender sweatshirt with stupid retarded silkscreening ugliness. Over this he wore a booger-green blazer worn inside out with a Halloween costume tiger tail pinned to the back. He donned a red plaid hunter's cap and a single black glove trimmed with fur. On his feet were Reebok pumps, but they were imitation pumps. They had the basketball on the tongue but they were a generic brand called Air-Rite.   I saw The Liars open for the YYYs and John Spencer Blues 2 years ago, and I was riveted. They opened up a whole new world of punk-funk sonic stylings and I got into the genre of Gang-of-Four influenced bands like The Rapture and Moving Units. Last night was a disappointment because The Liars aren't fun anymore. I liked maybe 2 or 3 numbers. The rest was tedious. I've listened to their new album a couple times, and it's pretty inaccessible. The last time I listened, I was falling asleep and I woke up with a start and yelled, "Aah! XX, turn it off! Please, turn it off!"  Celebrity sighting: John Dwyer from The Coachwhips.    Doppelganger Alert :     =   ?

       Batty is Watching MTV at This Very Moment  A bad start to my thus-far bonerrific Tuesday morning.. - via email my boss accuses me of fucking up on some dumb project. Say what? Luckily, I never delete emails, so I send her back an email of her own instructions. I underline, bold, and highlight them for good measure, letting her know I've done exactly as I was told. Realizing her stupidity and my stupendousness, she apologizes and ends her email with a happy face. Like that's going to get my crotch wet again. The day's ruined.  I can feel things spiraling downward and I'm enjoying the process. Yesterday in my cube I sang along with MF's "Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits" and played with Kinder Egg gnome toys that a coworker brought back to see if anyone would even notice. They didn't. I don't have a job. I have 8 hours to ponder the meaning of life, which is way too long. Marcus is coming back in a week, maybe I'll bug him for a job.  Today will be spent deciding what to take at city college over the summer - Garden Practices, Tap Dance, Art History or Intermediate Conversational French.    The second party at the Wood was even better than the first, if that's even possible. We toasted Batty's birth, ate cupcakes and poured about 25 bottles of wine into the giant sangria jar. Green Marble unapologetically watered the tree outside with her barft chunks, which is why I love her. TJ MAXX desecrated our Meg White shrine on the fridge by drawing an erect penis on her trousers. XX came dressed as Elvis, complete with a red jumpsuit and shades, which got some interesting looks when a few of us smoked outside.   I am broke. This month I can't even make rent. This means no eating out for the rest of the week. With self-imposed halt on fun, I might even get some errands done.  Finally, on Saturday we found out that G got into Columbia for grad school. Since that day, parents have miraculously stopped bugging me about my future. Does that mean that pressure's off? I'm holding my breath.  Batty, say hello to Jessica Simpson for me. I'm jealous.

       Feliz Cumpleanos a Mi      Presents I got for surviving 26 years:  1 bean portrait of BartD rendered by dearest Abby. 1 orange juicer shaped like an orange from dearest Green Marble. 1 impressionist-style painting of Karen O. from dear XX. Also from XX, The Cure b-sides box set!  From other beloved friends: earrings, lace gloves, a red hat, hazelnut chocolate, absolut citron, wine, 1 ticket to  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , a clock, socks, bath products, brownies, and everyone's presence at my bday party saturday night. (ho ho, pun intended!) The best gift of all came after all the guests had gone home: 1 comforter and 1 carpet, barf-free.

       urlLink The Von Bondies  @ GAMH 03-26-04     Openers:  urlLink The Cuts ,  urlLink The Vue   Celebrity sighting : Bart Davenport  Went with XX. Solideriffic line-up. Very impressed with The Vue. XX said they sound like The Stones circa 1960-something to 1970-something. I don't like the stones so who cares about dates. He probably named some albums too but instead of feigning interest, I tuned him out.  The Von Bondies were great. I liked their set a lot, though Jason Stollsteimer didn't talk much--I like a little in-between song banter. Marcy Bolen (redhead guitarist) is my new fashion icon. More about her later on in the week. Their set was about an hour, and XX kept marvelling at all the fashionable types in the audience. I said, "Honey, this ain't nothin. Wait til you go to the Arrow Bar." And he said, "When can we go?" and I immediately sputtered, "Ew! NEVER!!"

       urlLink Erase Errata  @ BOTH 03-26     I went with my new friend from work and I had a good time. It was my first Erase Errata show and I actually saw people I knew there. EE were so talentedly avant-gardly angularly noisy. It was one of the last shows for Sarah Jaffe, the guitarist and the rightmost girl in the above pic. Why's she leaving? What, is she allergic to adulation? success?? acceptance??! popularity??!! Crazy american. The club was packed and swampy and when the show was over, I bought their first CD, Other Animals.  Openers:  urlLink Whysall Lane  - solid pop with Asian frontman. Hooray!  urlLink Tussle  - Indie-rave music. Repetitive instrumentals that last, like, 7 minutes. They put up a screen and projected tie-dye imagery. As Summer on The O.C. would put it: "EW!"

       Vendredi!  Yesterday I spent $90 on a shopping spree at Target with mom and Batty. I assumed dear moms would pay for all my purchases, so I piled things up sky high in the cart without giving it much thought - a sexy Target bra, a clutch purse, a toilet cleaner, bath matt, a plant, a race car piñata, a new pot, some Swiffer refills, eye shadow, wooden serving spoon - only the products vital to my happiness & well-being. When we got to the register, she offered to pay, I politely refused, she didn't push it. What in god's name??... I felt robbed! Was this some sick way of her trying to teach me financial responsibility? I couldn't believe it! Especially since she now has a job. She redeemed herself when she gave me money to get sushi with Batty afterwards, but still, had I known that it would be my money blown on useless crap, I wouldn't have gotten so much of it. Anyway, I love my momma and I'm not stepping my foot in Target for the next two months.  After stuffing ourselves at Sushi Tomo, M came over with a big wrapped package. I like to pretend that I'm above gifts and that all I really want is someone kind and sweet who makes me laugh. But please. I've never ripped through anything so fast in my life. I almost peed myself when I saw it.  (http://secure.giantrobot.com/graphics/00000003/uglydoll_cinko.gif)  So fucking cuuuute!!!!   And so very generous and unexpected of M. As we watched cable for the next two hours, I wondered to myself "Is he turning into a mushy, sentimental, gift-giving boyfriend? Do I have to worry about him liking and respecting me from now on? Will he start complimenting me on things other than my bras and underwear?"..I thought back to the conversation I had with Batty on the way to get sushi - she very wisely pointed out that I like men who challenge me and give me the run for my money, which I agree with, but had never thought about in such clear, simple terms. It's true, I like men to disagree with me, argue with me and make me want to kill them. I won't marry this type, of course, but for some reason that's who I find attractive at this point in my life. Call it masochism, I don't care.  Inside my head I panicked at the thought of being in a normal, warm, lovey-dovey type of relationship with M. How can I stop him before he gets too far and ...and... stops talking about Paris Hilton's boobs?!?! At the same time I realized I hadn’t properly thanked him for my gift, so I leaned in to give him a kiss on the cheek. "Ack!! What are you doing? Please don't torment me with your wasabi breath!"..said he. I smiled and put my head on his bony little shoulder.

Imagine a shiny triangle bikini in  person ! within  reach ! ANNND she was wearing sexxxy stiletto heels. It just does not get any hotter than that, ladies and gentlemen. (Spanish accent) TOO SEXY, TOO SEXY!!!   I have seen them 4 times now. So in the final count for my favorite Oaklanders, it's Lovemakers 4, Bart Davenport 6. Who will be the ultimate victor?

       Mothers, Jew and Gentile   a response post   I haven't visited my mother for 13 days and the guilt is killing me. My own sense of worthlessness is boring holes into my Swiss cheese brain. It's only self-imposed guilt, because my mother is an angel. I like visiting her because she is my rock on which I sharpen my comedy tongue. She's the straightmom to all my inside jokes to myself. But there are some things that make me hesitate and reconsider a visit when I'm tired and grumpy. I was going to stop by today, but my hair is dirty and she'd immediately eye my bangs, cluck disapprovingly, and tell me how gross my habits are. This is a difference of opinion. What she thinks is "gross" and "repellant", I think is "cool". She'd say to me in Vietnamese, "Your hair is dirty. You go out of the house looking like that? Shameful!" and I'd say in English: "That's the style... it's cool!" And she'd say in English, "'Cool'? What does that mean?"  Another reason I can't visit today, is that I'm full. With a language and cultural barrier, the only thing we share and enjoy doing together is eating. She likes to make food, I like to eat it: it's the perfect relationship. Once dinner is over though, she starts into family gossip which I don't enjoy. She comes from a close-knit family of 7 siblings divided over a complex and sticky situation that involves my invalid grandma and money matters. I don't like to hear about this because she wants sympathy and for me to vilify certain relatives and lionize others. This won't work because I don't like to be a partial judge. I don't know the other side of the story so I just shrug and flip through a magazine, nodding on occasion. Flaccid family gossip without the reward of stuffing my face first? Until I built up my appetite, my visit will have to be postponed.  And Abby, your siesta idea is genius. Fuck company policy. We'll stage a mini-revolution with the simple closure of our eyelids and the sideways drool that'll spill from our lips. You and me. It's gotta start somewhere. Viva la revolucion! Office admins unite in snoozitude!  And No-bra Wednesdays should be called Boobless Wednesdays because au naturel, my pert padded boobs become unspectacular pancakes. Actually come to think of it, the best name for this midweek liberation would be "Boobless Hump Days." We will be heroes and the president will sign this into holiday with 20 pens. It has a nice ring to it, Boobless Hump Days.

       I Really Should Stop Writing About My Mother  My little brainy brother got into Boston University for journalism school. Mom called me on my cell phone to tell me the good news. "We should really celebrate soon. I finally found a job and G got into Boston...if only you did something important with your life, we would really have a reason for celebration," she said with a chuckle. I pictured little daggers launching towards her, words that would make it so easy to hurt her. Instead I said I had to go and took a deep breath...of my Camel Light. I called G and congratulated his voicemail. I also yelled at him for leaving me here to deal with this bullshit. I think the trick is to stop visiting. It's time to cut the fucking cord, Abby (pardon me while I have a conversation with myself). But Jewish mothers (and probably mothers in general) can be manipulative. After all, when I was 14, my own gave me pointers on talking to men in a way that makes them think your ideas were their own. At the same time she is kind and sweet and makes all my favorite dishes at a moment's notice and picks up my dry cleaning and gets my friends drunk. What would Dr. E say about this? She would say "Well, Abby. How would you feel about sharing your thoughts with her?" And I would say "Dr. E. We don't talk about feelings in my family, haven't we gone over this?" And she would nod politely and yawn and I would feel bad about boring my psychologist.   Week 2 of No-Bra Wednesdays and I think people are finally starting to notice. I think I'll write it into the company's strategic plan for 2004. That and afternoon naps. Why do I come up with all these brilliant ideas but still get paid so litte?

       Le Weekend      I was worried that crashing into a parked boat 20 seconds into our trip was a precursor of more dire things to come, but after kayaking around for twenty minutes, we learned to synchronize our paddling and got the hang of steering away from stationary objects. After a few hours in the water we landed on Talames Beach and, realizing that we were the only ones there, took a few minutes to stare at the tiny little cars driving on the other side of the bay. I knew what M was thinking because I was thinking it too - Are we going to make it through the weekend without hurting/killing each other? We had joked about bringing along a list of conversation topics we would refer to if the urge to stab each other ever came up, but no such list was ever compiled and now we were shipwrecked.  After unpacking the kayak (one tent, two sleeping bags, two sleeping pads, 2 bottles of wine, 6 wooden logs, way too much food, etc.), it was time to play ‘first man, first woman’. And I don't mean procreate. I mean setting up shelter and making some food. So naturally, being the gatherer without the need to gather, I read my chemistry book while he built a fire,  finished the first bottle of wine as he cooked dinner (pasta & salmon in alfredo sauce), took a nap as he cleaned up. In my defense, I did put up the tent and gave him pointers on cooking and cleaning, which, to my shock and dismay, he didn't appreciate. Then we took a walk in the mountains (which smelled like cow poop). When it got dark, the wind picked up and I got in the tent. Then began the bird wailing - loud, high-pitched crying that sounded like a beach full of pregnant woman giving birth, which kept me up until about 1 am. At one point I made M get out and check to make sure that it were birds indeed.  The next morning we hung out on the beach, ate eggs & bagels and drank coffee. It felt so peaceful and nice to not have to think about work or family or bills or my messy closet. My phone didn't get reception and there was no email access anywhere on the beach. Since then M & I have been emailing each other kayak links.

       Optimism and Positivity   Though I can be quite bitchy and sarcastic, I also think I'm a gushing fountain of optimism and positivity when it comes to creativity, oddball theories, and cockamamie ideas. XX accused me of being cynical, which I think is untrue. I can be quite sarcastic and funny in a mean raunchy way, but I'm not cynical. Cynicism = pessimism. Cynics sit in their armchairs and complain about the state of the world. They mock institutions and scoff at the condition of humanity, but they don't try to change things. I don't attend this school of thought because I'm too busy trying to glue two pieces of felt together. I used to be cynical and ridicule the ridiculous, but I realized I'm pretty ridiculous myself.   This weekend was spent decorating a CDcasebook that W-gal gave me. My muse:  urlLink Side 2 of Beatles vinyl ; my medium: felt, thread, and glue. I learned to embroider and execute a french knot. I did the backstitch until my eyes ached and my back hurt. I sewed on a sequin where the hole in the record goes. I used yellow thread to outline the bulb-like shape in the cross-section of the apple. In the end, it looked spectacular, but upon closer admiration of my handiwork, it actually really looked like a vagina. The bulb-like shape evoked the labia majora and the sequin was a big glittering clitoris. I showed Abby my masterpiece but warned her, "looks like a vagina" and she laughed at my deprecation. But upon scrutinizing the stitching closely, she exclaimed, "It  does  look like a vagina!" She placed her finger on the sequin and I yelled protectively, "Hey! You're touching the bean!"   5 reasons I feel positive today : --- Yesterday I won tickets to see  urlLink The Lovemakers  off Live 105. Thanks Disco Sean! ---  urlLink Soundcheck . Sunday nights on Live 105. Yesterday they played Blonde Redhead, The Start, and Stellastarr. Disco Sean (the sometimes DJ) is knowledgeable about good music and filled with fun facts and gossip. I see him at a lot of the shows I go to and he looks like Peter Brady. He's really nice too.  ---a silvery mesh scarf that I saw downtown yesterday. I am quietly gathering items for my Halloween " urlLink Sleepy Jackson " costume.  ---I applied for a new job. ---my roommates and my show buddies. I can talk in shorthand out of my derriere and my roomies know what I mean. I have show buddies who go to even more shows than I do and who are low down with the downlow. --- urlLink BartD  is finally playing with his band in April. ---Peeks at XX's cute  urlLink buns  when he's asleep.   Ok, that's 7, but despite the general funk and Monday-osity of today, I am brimming with glee!

          De-evolution  When I was a little girl, before I'd fall asleep at night, I'd devise mental lists and exercises to think about. One I liked to do was "freshening up on a date." I'd never been on a date before, but I imagined it involved dinner. To me then, dinner equalled breath putrefaction which could not be conducive to the "I had a really nice time" kiss, which was the point of the date, in my young perverted mind. After me and my suitor would eat dinner of 9-spice roast chicken at my mom's restaurant, I'd excuse myself to use the bathroom. Conveniently tucked in my purse would be a travel-size toothbrush, mini toothpaste, some floss and mini Scope mouthwash. I'd brush my teeth with lightning speed, floss, and freshen my breath in the same amount of time it takes to pee.   I'd emerge from the restroom with fragrant breath, which would floor my suitor. "What wonderful breath, we must kiss!" he'd think. We'd kiss and live happily ever after.   Flash forward 15 years later: Batty Apple has complete disregard for the condition of her breath. She ignores sound advice and regularly chomps down on onions, garlic, scallions and other yummy but vicious delights. She eschews gum and minty candies to keep boys at bay. Sadly, she's learned that they're crusty-lipped mouth-breathers who will not sweep you off your feet but devour your cooking while hurling insults, then demand more food. They're no good for watching movies with, or gluing magnets with, or sometimes, even talking to. The only thing they're good for, it seems, is sex and footrubs, neither of which require wonderful breath.  What will be the fate of our young heroine? Tune in next week when she exclaims,"It's just such a waste that I don't like to eat snatch!"

       Peeping Batty  Yesterday I took the day off and slept in. I did some eating, some DVD watching, then fell back asleep. So, basically I woke up to take a nap. XX picked me up later and we went to Baker Beach together to spy on the sunbathing nudes. This spell of weather has been really swell. Why be a grouch when the sun warms your shoulders and your bare legs? There's no reason for crankiness when the salty ocean kisses you with it's delicate spray and you can stare openly at gorgeously naked breasts from behind your sunglasses...  But for every trio of sexy women with fabulous tits, there will be 50 tall pale men walking around with a shaved pink weenie and an ugly NASCAR cap. For every boner, there will be an anti-boner. So it is with the laws of the universe. Why is this so?

        urlLink Yeah Yeah Yeahs  @ The Fillmore 03-16   What is the cross between a mohawk, a ponytail, a mullet, a shag, and a coonskin cap? Everyone? KAREN O's hair! When she galloped around on stage, she looked like a Comanche warrior rarin to scalp some settlers. When she stood still, it looked like a limp pelt. Abby goes, "Looks like some animal died on her head." Indeed.  It was awestriking because 5 people could stand around her, and each person would come away with a different perception. With each angle, she is squaw, brave, princess, warrior, Karen. Mad props for originality though. In an age where old know-it-all hipsters deride new bands for being unoriginal, I will counter with,"Oh yeah? How bout Karen O.'s hair? Where's that from, huh?" And they will walk away, defeated.  Her hair is an entity of itself and by itself. It is like The Phoenix, it destroys itself and is born anew every few months. It's not irony, it's just ugly; but like a trainwreck, you just can't look away.  Doppelganger alert:     =   ?

       No-Bra Wednesdays  Talk with M turned into me telling him that he's an asshole and him subsequently trying to justify why he is the way he is. blah blah blah blah. don't wanna hear it. We went to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs..Karen was sexy as usual with her hot pants and the sparkles. Batty & I talked about the versatility of her hairdo. "One haircut, five exciting looks". The funniest part was when Karen O. said something about the next song going out to all those who are in love and in unison, Batty & I went "Boooo!"..as everyone cheered. Not even "Psssss", but  B  fucking  OOOO .  XX and M were standing right behind us.   So I totally sleepwalked last night. I thought there was a squirrel in my wall and I was trying to coax it out. When I realized that I was actually sleep walking, I went to the bathroom and washed my hands casually, pretending like that's what I meant to do all along. M followed me, probably to see what I would do next so he can laugh about it later. Whatevs. He should be happy I didn't sleep-punch him in the ballsack.

       "Batty Apple will be out of the office tomorrow. Please direct all concerns to Abby Apple."   Tomorrow I'm taking the day off to laze about and pick at myself. I'll make a pie chart and attach a spinner in the middle to flick at languidly. The arrow will point to a pie piece that says "nose" or "zits" or "ladies choice." It's entirely coincidental that tomorrow is St.Patrick's Day because I don't celebrate that holiday. What do the Irish have to do with the Vietnamese? But since I have the day off and I'll be lounging about with unlimited stores of energy, I'm going to wear green and make some corned beef and cabbage. So, Irish, I'm celebrating your holiday. What are you going to do for me? That's right. You better eat that baby duck fetus! You best  gobble  that cake of pork blood! You better  dance  with that streamer and fan, if you know what's good for you... BEEYOTCH!

       Working Girl  My mommy found a job!! After two years of looking, interviewing, getting rejected, feeling shitty, gaining weight, feeling shittier - she starts on Friday. Thinking of cancelling kayaking (M pissed me off this morning, will have to have another talk tonight) and hanging out with the famfam and Oscar, who will be affected most of all. Besides, Captain Bloodsnatch is coming to town in a few days and bloody camping is not fun.  Beyond tired this morning. Went out last night to celebrate JJ Fadd's lady's birthday at Bruno's with the usual suspects. Oh, how wonderful it was to have all my favorite ladies and fellas at the same place at the same time (tougher than you might think), each dressed up in a fancy dress/dapper suit. How lovely to  enjoy their company in the most relaxed, slightly drunken state. This is what I will remember when I'm a wrinkled 70-year-old hag chain smoking at a cafe in Paris..   Skipping lab tonight so I can nap before the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

       A Period Piece   This month I saw a magazine ad for  urlLink Seasonale , the new birth control pill that reduces periods to 4x a year. What a miracle! Before I went on the pill, I had 5 weeks of play before I had to deal with "Aunt Flo" and now, it's 3. That's annoying, getting my period every three weeks instead of five. That's friggin SEVEN more periods a year! Seven more periods of (suggested) abstinence! I brought up Seasonale with Abby, and she said the only drawback is that you wouldn't know you're pregnant til you're well into your second trimester. Ew. That is a drawback. Fetuses are gross. An interesting  urlLink article  states:   "Giving birth is the primary biological goal of the female body and without modern contraceptives women would be having a lot more babies and a lot less bleeding. Women in 1900 had around 150 periods in a lifetime; women today have closer to 450."  Very interesting. I would like to read more from opponents of this new pill, but a scientific-based piece, not religious or personal opinion.   But, much like people jazzed about Lasik or Botox, I am wide-eyed and eager for Seasonale. Because I hate periods! They ruin cute undies! And stain cute penises!!!

       Aiaiaia..  The cube is spinning. Mostly greyish-brown, but some spots of primary colors. Oh, there go pictures of my dog. And the garden gnomes. I had coffee this morning. I've been trying to slowly ease myself into it by having a cup once in a while at home when Batty makes it. But this shit's strong and I drank a lot. I feel funny. I want to jump out of the 17th story with my umbrella because I'm sure I will land safely. I told one of the managers about my coffee binge and he said he'll check up on me in an hour. Good, I thought he was mad at me after I made fun of his outfit last Friday. There are tingles that keep going up and down my spine. ANd my legs feel hot.   Oh. Typing is more fun on coffee. O..  I'm going kayaking/camping this weekend. It's just going to be me and M since no one else can afford it/wants to go. It will be our version of Survivor, I told him last night: only one of us will come back alive and it won't be him.   Lunch in 10 minutes with bosslady. Please god don't let me make an ass of out myself as I suspect I will.   Oh. Shakey. I'm shakey. Will drink water now.

        urlLink The Sleepy Jackson  @ Cafe du Nord, Friday 03-12      How to be The Sleepy Jackson for Halloween: 1 striped shirt 1 blazer made for person with big shoulders; if you don't have big shoulders, replace with ginormous shoulder pads 1 slinky silver mesh scarf, tied like casual Euro-dandy 1 curling iron or, big rollers 1 hairdryer 1 pillow for flattening back of poufy hair 1 moustache 1 Liberace ring 1 pot aqua eyeshadow  Use curling iron, hair dryer, and pillow to create bushy lion mane. Put on rest of  ingredients all at once. Place tiny multicolored light between lips and play contraption that looks like cross between traffic light and motherboard. Cull sounds of heavenly Hallelujah choruses, souls in hell, and apocalyptic chaos. Ask your friend Abby "What does this all mean?" Hear her say slowly and gravely, "I think it means you're the devil."

       Friday Fashion News from the Catwalks of Emeryville, CA   This year, everyone in the office got a grey fleece jacket that commemorates our company's 25th anniversary. Everyone is wearing it. It lay on my desk awhile, and though I was reluctant to put it on because of its drab color, the emblazoned company logo, and the fact that it fits me like a sleeping bag, yesterday I wore it home because I forgot to bring a coat. I felt... like a soccer mom. I felt like... a frumpy American hausfrau. Boy is it soft and fuzzy, but man, is it shapeless and the opposite of sexy. I felt like I was in high school again, hiding myself in oversized baggy clothes. I've long outgrown these inhibitions because honestly, how can tourists marvel at my porcine pot belly if I'm wearing ill-fitting clothes? How can I flaunt my babyless bump in company fleece? It may be cozy and comfy like a blanket, but if I wear it, I might as well pin some mittens to my sleeves because it makes me look like a little kid: "Oh, she'll grow into it!" And you know what little kids are... snot-nosed perverts who have no fashion sense. I cannot be confused with them!  Comfort may also be the driving reason for  urlLink UGG boots . They're UGG-ly, and rank #2 for "Ugliest shoes in the world" (#1 being the irrefutable winner, Birkinstocks). People wear these monstrosities because Cameron Diaz wears them. People, come to your senses and shake off your sheeplike behavior! Uggs are unequivocally evil in their power to transform the smoothest sexiest legs into polska sausages. The length of the leg, the curve of a calf, and the comeliness of an ankle are wrongly obscured by these hideous beasts. Shame on you Cameron Diaz! You should be setting an example. You should be using your celebrity for good, not ruin.   On a final note, I'd like to salute the death of the ironic trucker hat. Death to irony and parody! Cheers to DIY, deconstruction, construction, and moving fashion forward! And a toast to the black zip hoodie, the classic staple of cool kids everywhere. I'm Batty Apple, and this is your Friday Fashion News.

       No More Fooling Around   Had 4 hours of sleep last night. Not because I was having fun at a show like Batty, but because M and I stayed up talking (i.e. arguing) until 2 am. I told him I didn't want to go on the kayaking trip next weekend if it's just going to be just the two of us and that I didn’t appreciate him coming around just so he can sit on the couch and do his homework all day. What should we do, he asked. I couldn’t think of anything. Last night he brought over some porn for me to watch, but it got boring quickly, so I read my chemistry book instead (to make up for the fact that I left my lecture 5 minutes into it even though I had gotten to class 45 minutes early)..I got through 3 chapters, pretending to concentrate on oxidation-reduction reactions and electron exchanges, just so that he wouldn’t bother me. Some of it actually sunk in. But eventually we had to talk things out and in the end nothing got resolved. I rolled my eyes at his ignorant comments about why people get together, which he couldn’t see in the dark. I told him that he’s making me depressed. He said it was probably Tindersticks playing on repeat. Yes, that too. So I’m back to thinking that this is not such a good idea. But on the bright side, my mums is taking me out to lunch today. Oh, and Tom is going to be a the show tonight.

       Pretty Girls Make Graves @ BOTH   Last night I went to see  urlLink Pretty Girls  and I had a great time. Here are my thoughts from the outskirts of the mosh pit:  Ouch! You stepped on my foot you rude ruffian! I wonder when I take off my shoes later if I'll have dangling toenails or missing ones that I'll have to look in my shoes for... The crowd is really jostly tonight! Oof! Their bass player is cute. He reminds me of Henry Thomas from E.T... Their singer has a similar style to Kelly Osbourne. Or is it the other way around? Ouch! Oof! With the rowdiness of this crowd, I better keep my mouth closed because I might get bumped and accidentally bite off my tongue.... Ohmilord, are they actually doing "pass-the-dude" at Bottom of the Hill?!! Wait, are they passing him to ME? No, that way! That way, people!    =   ?

       Smells in the Office (aka What's Grosser than Gross?)   What's grosser than gross is the smell of burning skin. Someone in my office smells like this. It smells like decay and charred tar and vile inhumanity. I know this smell because I used to smell this way. It happens when you are condemned to a life of bad skin and you decide to apply medically-prescribed acid to your acne. To get to the good skin you must burn through the bad. Unfortunately this smells like hell and pure evil. And the results aren't even worth the olfactory torture ("What  is  that foul smell? Jesus H., it's  ME !").   What's also grosser than gross is entering the bathroom when someone just laid a bomb. And as you're doing your business you conclude that it's not just #2 you smell, but the peculiar combo of #2 and apricots.

       *****  These are the picks that I  would  make sweet sweet love to if my fella was into that sort a thing, which, surprisingly, he's not (he says it makes him feel like he's filming a porno, but not in a good way..go figure). Hmm...they're pretty freakin emo, I know. That's because this is what I listen to regularly, when I'm not getting down with a boy (which is 99% of my time despite my recent tendency to write about sex). I don't think I can go the Marvin/Barry route, either.          Pulp is quiet sexy indeed, but also extremely cheesy, like you know Jarvis wrote it hoping it would inspire people to bone. Also there's that one song about old people and you'd probably have to make a decision at a rather inopportune time - do I look for the remote so I could skip this one so we're not reminded of old incontinent people (whom I normally love) which will inevitably ruin our boners, or should I just ignore it and keep going? Hmm...

       Music to Make Love By   I want to move past the boning-like-bunnies and learn to make love. But on my terms. I don't want gauzy billowy sheets or Enya or the sound of the pan flute. I'm teaching XX to stop jumping out of his clothes and instead letting me unbutton and unbelt and unzip and tug and pull and take off... What's the perfect soundtrack for a rhythmless Asian femme?  Air's new album,  urlLink Talkie Walkie . It's slow, pretty, and sexy. I feel right at home slowly taking off XX's clothes while this is on. I can't make love to old soul like "Between the Sheets" or "Smooth Grooves" because it makes me feel cheesy and like I'm acting a part. Like I should move with my hips instead of my elbows. Everyone's got a different style, and while I'm making my own rules for making love, "Talkie Walkie" provides the inspiration.

       Corpo-waves   When people quit work, they leave in waves. Not many people have left my company since I've started, but within the past week, I've learned that three people are leaving. I'm jealous!  I wish I could ride out with them. I can't catch a wave or be my own wave because I've been supremely apathetic in the job hunt. XX is here and though I complain about his motives, I really like getting a ride to work and having someone to go home with afterwards -- it bookends boring sterile robo-work with warmth and tenderness. Actually, that's all I want from a de facto boyfriend: someone who picks me up in the morning and gives me a ride in the evening... Wink, wink! Yee-haw! AWOOOOOOGA!

       Speaking of..  ..orgasms through intercourse, M is currently batting at 100%, which has never happened to me before. This is the number one reason that we're still together. I attribute my ability to get off to the fact that I'm not completely in love with him as I was with other boys I dated (though I like him a lot) and the fact that he is into porn and doesn't have hang-ups about sex. With him, I don't foresee marriage or kids or a white picket fence in ten years; I foresee great sex tonight. And tomorrow. In fact, I believe our entire relationship is based on this. We can't stay mad at each other for long because within 24 hours one of us will get horny and this kind of a thing is always better with another person. I sure will miss that when he leaves. Also him looking kinda pretty after a shower when his hair is all up in a fro.

       XX Pornographer  Yesterday night when I was talking on the phone with XX he told me that he once aspired to be a pornographer. A couple years back he wanted to get rich off of internet porn. And, the catholic in me was upset and morally offended. She stomped her saddle shoes then readjusted her knee socks. I said, "Hey quiet down in there, you're ruining my game!" I quickly got off the phone to sort through my mixed emotions.   I advocate porn usage. I love female nudity. But I don't want to be with someone who once considered "pornographer" as a career. Because look at two pornographers: Hugh Hefner and Larry Flynt. Hugh Hefner is always surrounded by a coterie of 7 or 8 of his girlfriends and Larry Flynt had a voracious sexual appetite that his wife couldn't satiate. She herself would look for girls to satisfy him. I can't do this. I don't want to live like that. I don't want a greedy man. I want a simple life with a simple man who doesn't have a "porn problem." He also openly checks out other girls in front of me. I told him that it's downright rude and he said, "Take it or leave it, baby!"   I can leave it because even though I like him okay, my disbelief isn't suspended. No matter how many times he tries to convince me he's just "big-boned" he is still fat.  He still has 4 chins. He is still hairy. He still snores even though he says "It's my cold." Well the cold's over and the snoring is still around. He still talks too much and only about himself. He gives me rides in the morning and when work is through, but he doesn't do it out of sincere niceness--he does it because he gets to congratulate himself for being nice. He does it because he gets to say, "I give her rides in the morning and at night" and to hear people say to him, "Oh, you're so nice!"  Another example of his character: we exchanged handmade cards for Valentine's Day and he spent the whole time admiring the card HE made.    Everything would be okay if he didn't talk so much. Everything would be okay if he talked less and listened more. If he didn't make fun of my clothes or my shoes. If he didn't have a wandering eye. If he wasn't so self-congratulatory. If he was humble, and modest, and sweet. Sincerely so.    XX is okay for now but I'm not gonna marry him. One of my goals for this year is to experience orgasm through intercourse, something that has eluded me so far. And to do so, I need a partner... so for now, I will have sex with a wannabe pornographer, as he is the only person who applied for the position.

       I, too, am bored.  You know, maybe I'll go to Japan with you Abby. I feel dissatisfied with worklife and lovelife. I think I've lost my faith in love. Or I feel cynical, the way old women do. Then, today, I had a pang that I wanted to have a child. I want to have a child because I'm bored. My theory is that people who choose to have kids have them because they're bored with their lives or with their mates. I'm not going to do it, but it would be nice to take care of someone and watch them grow. I'm only thinking this way because I need to justify why I'm wasting my life in the corporate world. I need a reason why I work the 8-5, because it's killing me. An unselfish reason. "I hate my job, but I gotta take care o' my kids" kind of reason. And the puppy theory isn't going to work, bec do you know how hard it is to own a dog in the city?

       B-O-R-I-N-G  Getting really bored with my job, to a point where I can't seem to get anything done. This has happened with every job I've ever had, sooner or later. Not that I'm irresponsible - I've always been able to find a replacement job within a week or two. It's just that this is my first 'career' job and I thought I could make it last at least a few years. But it looks like that won't happen.   I found a couple of teaching jobs in japan. Those are still pretty easy to come by. Maybe after my least runs out, I'll run away again. No northern village this time. Tokyo or Nagoya or maybe Kyoto.  Somewhere where the demographics include at least 5 people in my age bracket.   I came to the conclusion that I don't want a career. I want to bounce around for as long as I possibly can. Maybe I have some sort of a job ADD.  Ok. Back to the ol' database. Snooore.

       Party News, V.2   I'd like to thank my parents for joining loins and giving birth to such a kick-ass host as myself, the good lord for blessing me with my enormous garnishing talent, and Popeye's chicken. Green Marble's friends brought over a load of  urlLink chicken from heaven  and what ensued was out-and-out chickentime. I saw R-dude munching on a piece, and I had to have one too because I could not talk and watch him eat it without drooling. While I was eating mine and talking to Z., she too was hypnotized and had to grab a piece for herself. A little later I saw XX eating a piece and he said, "Well I was talking to Z. and...." Thank you Popeye's Chicken and god bless.

       Party News   The housewarming party on Saturday night was a huge success due to the wide array of dips on the table: salmon, spinach,  and  artichoke. XX decided to show up after all even though Dizzy D was going to be there. The weird part was that XX showed up exactly 5 minutes after Dizzy D left. I was like, "Were you waiting outside in your truck, waiting for the exact moment, fogging up the windows with your creepy breathing?" and he laughed.   There was one guy who showed up, who didn't talk much and lurked around, who was a friend-of-a-friend-of-Abby's-pseudo-bf. I jokingly referred to him as "The Columbine Killer." The next day Green Marble referred to someone as "Trench-Coat-Mafia-Guy" and I knew exactly who she was talking about.   The funniest part was when my friend Z. came up to me in the kitchen and said, "Uh... your cousin just puked out the window." I turned my head, and Green Marble was leaning over the railing. I walked over and there was an explosion of vomit on the sidewalk below. And the people smoking outside were looking up at her going, "Hey! Watch it!" She giggled and pointed out the recognizable chunks of the orange she just ate.   The grossest part of the night also involved barf. The joker TJ MAXX and his bf came up from my room and said, "Some guy puked on your bed." I laughed at their silliness and said, "Ha-ha, nice joke." And they were like, "No, SERIOUSLY. Some guy puked on your bed!" I walked downstairs, expecting to find some sort of prank, but there was a guy slumped on the edge of my bed, a firework of puke on my carpet, and a smaller one on my comforter. I ran upstairs and squealed, "AHH! Someone puked on my bed!" and the SWAT team of barfer's gf and Jason hurried down and cleaned it up within 20 minutes. They were profusely apologizing but I waved my hand and said, "Thanks for cleaning it up. You guys are wonderful." I was in high spirits and nothing could phase me, not even puke.  It was nice to have all my friends and family in one place and ply them with drinks and food. Before we have another party, though, I have to work on my party tricks. I once had a co-worker who's trick was that she would start crying if she thought about the movie "Sophie's Choice". She also could do on command the spray that comes out of your mouth when you eat sour candy (glerp? gleek?). Saturday night, W-gal busted a move. She bent over and revealed her bony spine poking alarmingly high out of her back. She told us that not only is she human, she's also a dinosaur: specifically, a stegosaurus.      I wonder which dinosaur I am? If I had a pinhead, I could be a pteradactyl. If I had a long neck, I could be a brontosaurus. Which dinosaurs have huge heads and speak valley girl Vietnamese? Cuz I would definitely be that one.

       Funny How That Happens  K-chan and I went on a double-date last night. Technically she was the one on a date. I was her friend cohort and Eaton (her sweetie) brought his friend Tom and before you knew it, it was just like high school...would have been if we went on double-dates instead of practicing dance routines in her living room and hosting bake-offs against the boys. Tom is a landscape architect who lives in the Mission and likes emo music. We bonded over Sleepy Jackson and "shy clams" (clams that don't pop open when you cook them). He was nerdy, courteous, sweet and handsome. We sat next to each other at the Asian Film Festival Music Videos presentation.  Before that, the four of us shared tapas at a French restaurant, told stories of car breakdowns and Canadian cuisine, and strolled down Fillmore street in the most amazing evening weather San Francisco has ever experienced, complete with lilac smell permeating the air. It might have been perfect if it was June 15th and M was leaving for good and I was looking for something (someone) to take my mind off things. But he’s still here and I’m finding myself getting attached even though I swore up and down that I wouldn’t. He spills champagne on the carpet and brakes the internet, sending me into bitch-mode tirade about "what it means to be responsible".  But all it takes is for him to sign his email 'wuv' or compare our "story" to some cheesy romantic comedy and I can't stay mad. I no longer feel clear-headed, sensible and pragmatic. Instead I feel slightly out of control, anxious and restless and if you tell me it's love I swear to god I'm going to puke this very minute.

       JC Chasez   He has the same initials as Jesus Christ. Is he the new messiah? Will he save pop music from Pharoah and the slave-driving Egyptians aka Hilary Duff? If you look at all his initials, it's JCC, and we all know what that stands for: Jewish Community Center.  I have a lot of CDs in my collection that others would term "guilty pleasures" but I am proud! They are mine! Sure they may have come about because of my dalliances with questionable women and horny himbos, but they are my legitimate slutty bebes. Yes, I own Jordan Knight's solo album, some N'Sync, and even Christina Aguilera's spanish album, "Mi Reflejo." Yes, I am ten years older than the target demographic, but I am only human. If you prick me, do I not bleed? If you test me with catchy hook-laden pop, do I not succumb? En espanol?    Lyric from JC's new album: "When I'm alone I lie awake and masturbate." Who can resist that? Can a wan and pale indie rocker meet that lyrical daring? C'mon Stuart Murdoch, I challenge thee in the name of Jesus Christ Chasez!

       Mrs. Dalloway Said She'll Pick Up the Flowers Herself  Shit. The housewarming is tomorrow and there's so much to do. Well, mainly cleaning up and putting things up and making it look like it's been that way all along. At work people are stopping by to tell me that they will 'round up the gang and come by'. What does  gang  mean? M says it will be a rager, but I refuse to call it that. REFUSE! It will be a nice, intimate gathering of all of our closest friends, neighbors, families, co-workers and random people off the street. Tonight is the purse party and house clean-up/craft corner. Batty and I came up with the same idea (separately!) to make little magnets out of candy pictures, so it might actually happen.  Oh man. Friday afternoon and there's no way I can get any work done. Instead, I'm listening to the Magnetic Fields and talking to my Fijian neighbor about fabric and making CD mixes in my head. Tomorrow is the sewing class and party shopping and party.

       Footwear Zeitgeist      I am of the opinion that feet should look like cupcakes. Shoes should only be fanciful, extraordinary, and fun. They should only come in the colors pink, sea green, and canary yellow. They should have sparkles and bedazzles to simulate sprinkles, and polka dots that evoke maraschino cherries. If everyone had shoes that transformed their feet into cupcakes then wars would end and world peace would begin. Neon colored jellies are back as are big floppy bows that are both ridiculous and ubiquitous. We are entering a shoe renaissance as they're becoming twee whimsical confections that come in all colors of the ice cream rainbow. People, we must wear these shoes while we can, before our children make fun of us for once having cupcake feet.

       Shoe Fetish  My beige  urlLink D'Orsay heels  finally arrived after a week-long tour of SF, courtesy of FedEx. I vowed to make this my last shoe purchase  at least  until my debt dips under 2 grand.  But I must say, I'm in love. Sure, they're too small on the sides and too long lengthwise, but the thought of exchanging them for a more 'fitting' pair over snail mail doesn't appeal at all. So I stuff the toe with wads of toilet paper and hope they don't fall off when I exit the bus.

       Ode to Ivo   Ivo is my hairstylist. He used to work at ZipZap on Haight St but moved back home to San Jose to detox. Last time I  got a haircut I was like so why'd you move back and he said, "Well, all I was doing in San Francisco was watching TV, doing drugs, then going to work." I opened my eyes wide and said mock-aghast, "You mean... you cut my hair... ON DRUGS?" and he waved his hand dismissively and said, "Oh yeah! All the time!" and I lisped solemnly, "No wonder it was so... INSPIRED."  I knew it was love at first appointment because the first time he washed my hair he was going on and on about a movie starring Carol Channing and Gwyneth Paltrow. He described it as dark and about two women in a corporate environment, one a top exec and one just starting out. He goes on and on, and it sounds familiar to me... I've seen this movie, but I'm not seeing Carol Channing in the role as the high power executive. I interrupted him and said, by Carol Channing, don't you mean  Stockard  Channing? And he stops for a minute and goes, "Yeah, right, Stockard Channing," and continues to describe the movie and how much he loved Gwyneth Paltrow in it. And I think a little more, and the  urlLink movie  is coming back to me and I say, "Hey, that wasn't Gwyneth Paltrow... that was Julia STILES." And he laughs some more, and goes, "Was it?"   "Anyway, I loved that movie."  My last haircut was 2 months ago when Abby and I made the pilgrimage all the way to  urlLink San Jose  for our fab 'dos. They cost us $70 each, tip included. For two months, that's less than $1 a day for awesome hair.  I'm feelin pretty shaggy these days, but $70 pinches my wallet. But for a haircut, an hour of celebrity gossip, Courtney Love impersonations, stories of his family life and his road to sobriety ("I"ll eat a whole dinner at home then drive straight to McDonald's and get a Quarter Pounder!"), and just the sight of his get-ups* alone are absolutely, fabulously priceless.  *He once wore an intricate necklace that looked like a gothic fishnet/chandelier draped across his chest. It was worn over a black t-shirt.

      Dear Dr. E, Thank you for helping me navigate the slightly bumpy road that is my life the last couple of years for the low price of a $10 co-payment. I appreciate your insight, patience, humor and the way you slid the tissue box over when my eyes were watering up and I looked like I would lose it at any second (which I sometimes did). I appreciate all your help but I think I will take it from here. And I know that just yesterday, at our last appointment ever, you said that my relationship with M borders on abusive (from both sides), and recommended cbt (cognitive behavioral therapy) so that I can reprogram my brain to think healthy happy positive thoughts. It's just that I think I'm finally okay with it. Yes, he talks about threesomes occasionally and I have gotten into the habit of physically restraining his speech by placing my hand over his mouth, but you know, every relationship is different and this works for us. Besides, he's leaving in June and it'll be over and I'll find someone else, maybe just as fucked up yet amusing, to spend my time with. But you should have seen us at the bar last night. His friend with the glasses and the facial hair said he liked me because he had never met a girl who talks so much shit about her boyfriend to his friends. You would've thought it was terribly unhealthy but I had a good time. And you're right about my family. Yes, we almost let my father die of a heart attack rather than forcing him into an ambulance against his will, but that’s just our way. And I've told you a million times that my parents pester me about marriage and career and children, but I never told you that that they’re the most youthful, fun-loving, smartest people I know (and they’re donating whole bunch of vodka for the party).  And yes, my gramma is a catch-22 in so many ways, but she’s the matriarch and I don’t think I’m supposed to agree with her about everything. And when she dies I will regret not telling her so many things, but I just can't tell them to her now. That's just how it is and I don't want to change anything. So thank you. Good luck with everything. Maybe we'll run into each other in the future.  With Utmost Gratitude and Appreciation, Abby

       How I Farted in the Grand Canyon and Lived to Tell About It   So I was going to write in great detail about the three day hiking trip in and out of the Grand Canyon. How it was storming when we got there, how the rain and snow never completely let up, how our muscles ached by first evening. I was going to describe how amazing food tastes when you're that hungry and physically exhausted, because working in an office I never feel quiet that desperate. How walking six hours a day up and down hiking trails releases chemicals in your brain that make you feel blissful despite of the fact that your clothes are soaked through with rainwater. I was going to say something about how being a part of such a monumental scene makes you feel humble and human. And happy. I was going to tell you that there’s a bar (!) at the bottom of the canyon and that a Tecate there costs only $3. I was going to tell you how fun it was hanging out with these boys. How I carried my weight and kept up and was probably the only person in the whole canyon wearing lipstick (I do things on my own terms). And how I cooked scrambled eggs and tortilla soup and quesadillas even though I hardly make anything at home. And how we saw mountain goats and California condors and very few other hikers. And that I learned to put up a tent in under a minute. But that would take me the remainder of the day and I have to get back to my piles of work. But I think you get the idea.

       What Batty Wants, Batty Gets   Batty Apple gets XX back. He's going away to Europe for a month, but yesterday B.A. got a B.J. And this time around B.A. says no way to s-e-x-x until XX becomes a BF. Her rules. Though she is having trouble sticking to them as she really likes to do IT. She is thinking that she is the most puritanical taskmaster ever to occupy herself.

       :)   Fucko is back in my life. He will be referred to from now on as XX/Fucko. He tells me that he wants to take me on dates when he gets back from Europe. He says we just moved too fast and he wants another chance. I said sure, but there will be no below-the-waist activity. He's okay with that. He says I can sleep in his marshmallow bed when he's away.   I'm like a battered woman applying her eye to the fist, but I'm gonna try again with XX/Fucko. I still carry a torch for him and his company makes my life splendider.   Though this time around, I will approach with trepidation as I'm fully aware of his heart-breaking skills.

       3:30  So who's got the best roommates in the history of roommate-dom? I do!! Why? They let me open my presents yesterday, reasoning I was already born by that time back in the motherland. And why else? Because they got me an awecome hand made belt (Thanks Green Marble!) and some hot peach Franco Sartos which I practically fell asleep in (Thank you Batty Apple!!). They effing rock. And Batty, I'm wearing the earrings. I'm such a lucky girl.

       Family  Alex, the father, gave me the gift of speech this morning. Specifically, he told me why he is refusing to talk to us and now I'm in tears and people are stopping by to wish me a happy birthday and I just want to hide in the filing cabinet. It's a good thing I don't wear mascara.  Basically he said that he's tired of putting everyone's wishes first when none of us are doing that for him. He said he is tired of having to ask my brother and my mom and me for simple favors over and over again when we never have to ask him for anything twice. It's true. He even phrased it this way "Abby, whenever you ask for something, it becomes my top priority, but I'm still waiting for the Rubik’s cube that I asked you to solve 3 months ago". He said he's tired of life and tired of everyone and that he's done talking for the day. And then we hung up and I have a lump in my throat and a freakin Rubik’s cube at home that I have to solve asap.   Growing up, Alex and I were thought to be so similar (both in character and looks) that my family called me by a name which roughly translates into "Alex Number Two" in yiddish. In second grade when the commie teacher made us pick a favorite parent (wtf?), I was the only one in class that picked my dad over my mom. We are both stubborn, moody, somewhat competent and rather dramatic and for these reasons we understand each other best. Or at least used to. I don't know what's going on with him now and it breaks my heart to pieces to see him like this. At the same time, he is being childish and manipulative and I want to punch him in the face.

       Someone's Birthday Eve!   Tomorrow is the big 26 for blessed Abby. What's in store for her, since I am really wise and experienced having been 26 for a month now? Well, she will fall in love, get dumped, hide in room to watch the dumper drive away, feel really low, then have her teeth cleaned and go on a job interview that goes really well. That's what's in store for her. For more predictions on the 26th year, tune in next month.  Speaking of birthdays, over the weekend I wrapped a box for someone's birthday. The box is well-wrapped and there is one pink ribbon adorning it. That is all that we will speak of for now, as the walls have ears and the Windows (Microsoft) have eyes.

       Taking Care of Bidness   I keep checking my own blog for updates, and since none are happening (no pressure Batty), I better write something so that I can refresh this page and be pleasantly surprised. Ok, so what's new, I'm really tired - was up all night with my cough. Finally decided to chug some Codeine around 3 am, so of course couldn't get up this morning for the life of me. The inhaler Kaiser prescribed is actually for asthma, Kelly told me, so no wonder it's not doing anything for the cough. This morning at the doctor's they said that I should wait another 2 weeks before contacting them about this (the purpose for my appt was my jaw tumor thingie). Yes, I was in the exam room, talking with a medical doctor after having waited for 45 goddamn minutes and they couldn't bust out the stethoscope for 20 seconds. Bastards!   On the bright side, my car got fixed today and it only cost 60 bucks!! I was waiting for Alex (the paternal parent) to help me deal with this situation, but surprise! he stopped talking again last Monday (a la November-December 2003) and since no one knows how long he will be in this peaceful state, I had to take the matters into my own hands with the drive to Coachella coming up in mere days. In addition to taking care of this, drove mom around all weekend - cheese shop, produce market, bread store, meat store, gramma's, lastly SF Center for some retail therapy. She is overly generous when Alex gets weird like this and while at Nordstrom, kept pointing at random things and asking if I want them. I didn't, but I did let her buy me some shoes and a sweater. Also had my kayaking class yesterday and dinner with Alex (friend, not father), Genny, M and some friends from NY.    Tomorrow is the big 26. Want to hide under my bed very badly, but that's not an option since I'm trying to save up my vacation time for the road trip. Jann Workmama is taking me out to a fancy lunch, bless her heart. Then might get some ribs for dinner. I'm foregoing offical party-dom in favor of pigging out all day. All week, actually. Just need for the cough to go away long enough for me to be able to say a sentence.  That's all for now.

        urlLink Willpower   @ The Hemlock 04-24-04   Will's the cutie in the middle.  With XX gone and Abby on budget, I'm back to seeing the occasional show by myself. On Saturday night I ventured to The Hemlock to see Willpower and Anna Oxygen. I'd seen Will (Imperial Teen) before and he puts on a good show. Dance music and hot moves with smiling indie earnestness. He has back-up dancers who aren't any good, but very enthusiastic. I like them because they're sincere and look like they got the gig just because they're Will's friends. I've seen Willpower twice, and the dancers change. I want to be his friend! I want to be a back-up dancer! Also in the band is a shyguy named Tomo who mans the Apple Mac computer...  Quick! Trivia time! Name two other local bands I've seen who also have a Mac onstage! (Answers at end of post.)  Mid-set Will told the audience that Tomo's parents were there and they flew in all the way from Japan. They were standing next to me, smiling and politely clapping. I wonder what they thought of all the queers, because that night the room was packed with fags, fag hags, lesbos, hipsters, and me. It was a room fulla love and good energy and maybe some B.O. emitting from the pit of the tank-topped guy in front of me. I love Will cuz he has the sweetest smile and always looks like he's having a good time. And he makes good eye contact with the audience.  The person before Will was  urlLink Anna Oxygen  a supersweet energetic girl-lady from Portland. I'd read a great review of her record in Bust magazine, so I was psyched to see her. Though she's a fantastic girl, I didn't like her music though I really wanted to. It was too tinny and hollow electroclash for me; the songs seemed off-the-cuff and hastily constructed. I like hooks and there were none. She got the audience dancing in a hyper kinetic way but I couldn't get into her songs. There was a sheet behind her onto which she projected visuals that were unthoughtful and did nothing to enhance her show. A good idea, but a waste of the medium. She's a great singer, but her voice is mired in mediocre songs. What can I say, her art is amateurish and bland. I'm sure she's a wonderful human being. This review was hard to write because I really wanted to like her. I support her ideas--I just think they need development.  The opening band was called  urlLink Mighty Bells  and they were twee and wonderful. Kitty Jensen plays chords on her keyboard and sings in a girlish clear voice. Michelle Kline is on drums. The songs are simple and sad, like a lo-fi Azure Ray. Kitty was obviously nervous and apologized for it, stating that it was only their third show. Anna Oxygen sat cross-legged onstage, singing harmonies and the music was beautiful and simple. I bought their CD afterwards for $5 and it was a burned CD, which Anna apologized about. She also apologized because she didn't even have a pen to write down the name of the band. I told her I'd remember and if not, I can always look it up online.   All in all, a great show. It got me back into the swing of things, post-broken-heart. Boys come and boys go, but live music lives on. Viva la musica!  (Trivia answer: Gold Chains, Lovemakers)

       :( x :( = Sad Squared   Today I feel lower than low. I cried at my monitor then sobbed at reception. But quiet tears as this  is  a library software company. Hot tears over crumply mouth, lump in throat, and immediate clogged nose will not get me any dates anytime soon. I don't care. Then when Mr.Hottie, my confidante, asked me casually how I was doing, I burst into tears in his office. He offered me a tissue and I had a therapy flashback. I'm a mess.   I have also turned into a psychotic. I saw Fucko leaving the building so I went upstairs to a secret room on the 3rd floor to watch him pull out of the parking lot. It was a nice day so he had his window rolled down and he was tapping his hand along to the music. Then I saw him check his phone. What does this mean? He's happy-go-lucky and carefree. He's waiting for some new girl to call him and be wonderful to him without the neuroses. I don't know. What I do know is that I felt so pathetic standing there in the secret room, my heart pounding, and more tears coming on. I just wanted to see him. So I saw him. But at what price? I'm now, officially, a creepy stalker.

       Update   I couldn't wait until Monday, so I called Kaiser about my cough and although they said they couldn't see me, they did prescribe a shitload of drugs for me to pick up at my local Kaiser pharmacy. I specifically requested more codeine and another inhaler and the nice lady nurse said "Sure, we can do that for you." Just like that.

       What I've Spent My Workday Doing:  15% - Emailing with Rami about her quitting our company, which makes me very sad. And very jealous. But she worked her ass off, so she totally deserves this.   60% - Staring at the picture of Prince William in his water polo outfit. Goddammit he's hot. Too bad I already have a boyfriend. I'll be unattached in June, wait for me William!!  15% - Working on two proposals. My boss is out and by the time she finds out I've taken on responsibilities "outside of my job description", it will be too late to assign them to someone else. Ha! (I might really get fired for this, but I'm ok with that).  8% - Planning the "girls only" camping trip with some of the fabulously sassy ladies at my company/gossiping about the girls who are not invited because they're bitches.  2% - Coughing up some nasty shit. What is going on with my body? This is ridiculous. On Monday I'm getting a head scan at the Oakland Kaiser, maybe they'll figure out this freakin cough.

       :(   I am not okay. I still have a lingering sadness over the whole Fucko affair. I want him to suffer, then perish. I want him to be riddled with disease and heartache like I could be and am. How is it so easy for one person to forget and move on so carelessly while the other person is completely devastated?   I still have a photo album of pictures on Ofoto entitled "I love XX." They're all pictures he took of himself to send to me and keep me company while on the road. There was a time when looking at pictures of his face made me feel so happy but now I look at them and want to cry. The solution? I deleted him from my Friendsters. Sure, I operate in utmost passive aggression, but it's the only way I know how. I know it will hurt him because he's superficial. He cares about how many Friendsters he has. And the photos he sent me I thought were private and just for me, but then he put two of them on his profile for everyone to see. What the hell is that?  I know what the hell it is. Him checking out other girls in front of me. Him never changing his profile to say something other than "Interested in Dating (Women)" even though I asked him to, and finally, him saying that he didn't want to be my boyfriend and was not interested in making any commitments. I know that I'm better off without him -even my mother knew this after only meeting him once- but I can't help but feel sad. Really really sad.

       Take Two  Three mintues ago I was introduced to Kelly's former boss (whose name I now forget). This time I was ready. I heard them from far away and knew that Kelly is taking her the 'marketing route' so that I can meet her. In preparation, I rubbed my right hand vigorously on the chair. Shit, I thought to myself, not again. But I'm happy to report, it wasn't as bad as the meeting yesterday. Yes, my hand was still clammy (gross) but my thumb stayed on its appropriate side and I managed to smile. I thought about telling her that I'm sick (which I still am) to avoid the handshake part of the meeting, but things were happening so fast that before I knew it, her hand was right in front of me and I couldn't do anything but shake it. Luckily, she was holding a baby with her other hand, so the conversation quickly switched to the its cuteness and preciousness. Phew. Another major disaster averted. They should teach a class on hand shaking. Really.

       Sex, Love, and the Diseases In-Between   I just scheduled an OB/GYN appointment and I asked for an AIDS test. I've never had one before and it's important that I know. What I already know is that XX and I had lots of unprotected sex, and before me, he was a dog. We're talking one-night-stands-on-the-road kind of dog. I didn't ask him to get tested because I wanted him to like me. I didn't ask him to use a condom because he didn't have any our first night and I wanted to get laid. I'm not going to do that anymore for anyone. I just read an article in Newsweek about a moratorium in the porn industry because one actor recently tested positive. He also infected at least one more person: a 19-year old actress. 19 and HIV-positive! That is scary and I'm going to err on the side of precaution from now on. I will think with my brain instead of my internal boner.   Sometimes late at night, I'm seconds away from dialing up XX and saying, forget it, let's just have a good time, roll around, romp, all that: No commitments. Then I figure, why do I need him? I don't. Why should I compromise myself? I shouldn't! I can't divorce physical intimacy from emotional intimacy so I end up turning off my phone and doing the deed with myself. Because I love me and I'll always be around for me. I would never tell me, "You know what? You don't look good in green" or when I ask myself to be true I don't sigh loudly and say, "I guess so. It's not like there's anyone else right now." After my O, my thoughts are clear and I remember what I truly want: Love.  Sex ruins things. My emotions get involved, then in the very end when the guy leaves (XX aka "Fucko") I'm hurt and confused. I can't just have sex with people. I don't care if I'm treading a trail to spinsterhood. I don't care if I have to wait 1 year, or 2 years, or beyond my lifetime for someone special. I'm going to wait until there's mutual love before I have sex again. I'm going to wait for love in the way that I want it and if it doesn't happen during this life, I will wait until the next.

       Bodily Dysfunction   What's worse than clammy hands? B.O.! In a tussle between a clammy hand and a stanky pit, I think the one that leaves the lingering bad impression is B.O. So Abby, my onionpit trumps your clamhand. Green Marble used to extoll the virtues of keeping some deodorant in the office, but I didn't listen because I'm a FOOL!! To counteract I have clamped my right arm shut to contain the effluvium, but to no avail: the B.O. only feeds on itself and becomes more powerful.  In wonderful news of my wonderful new life (despite odor problem), I have a job interview on Monday morning after my dentist appointment. I really hope I do well and get the job, because I need more new and exciting things in my life. To have a major job upheaval would occupy my mind with other things than, "Why, XX, WHY?"  I am slowly regaining my senses, and enjoying life again. Yesterday was the first day of absolutely no contact with him and I hope that it continues for a lifetime. Our mutual friend Lingling said that my hostile feelings will pass, but she doesn't know my capacity to hold a grudge. I told her, "This grudge will go beyond my lifetime. I'll pass it down to my children, and my children's children! Hear me now, woman, I swear it!"  I think the only way I can forgive him is if he drunkenly crashed his car into a lightpost and he's on a hospital bed dying. I'll look down at him pityingly, tightly clasp his hand, and whisper hoarsely, "I forgive you, XX. I forgive you." Tears will spring to my eyes but I will quickly dash out of the room, my bridal train trailing behind me.  Also, not trailing behind me would be my B.O. problem, as that would have been solved by then.

       Why I Can Never Have My Own Talk Show  Oh. Oh. Most embarrasing thing just happened. I was introduced to one of the new biologists and as I went in to shake his hand, my thumb somehow ended up on the same side as my palm and it was a COMPLETE AND UTTER DISASTER. He even said 'Oh. I guess I'll shake your hand this way." In addition, my hands are cold & clammy, which always makes meeting new people an absolutely mortifying task because they  know   that my hands are clammy and as they're shaking, they're probably thinking "It's definitely NOT a pleasure to meet you'. I want to crawl under my desk and stay here until lunch and then crawl back afterwards with my new shoes. And here I had high hopes for today. I guess I'll have to get Ethiopian food and eat it on my bed while watching Dr. Phil to make me feel better.

       Lunchtime Shopping  I just checked my bank balance, and yes people, I finally got paid. Sure, most of that money is going to rent, but since I have almost paid off my ortho bills, I think it's time to treat myself to a pair of shoes (square toe black oxfords, to be exact). And maybe some pants and a warm sweater. One of the few good things about being 'petite' is that I can shop at Brass Plum for the rest of my life, so that's we're I'm going today during lunch (in 2 long hours). I'm dragging Kelly too. We have a tradition of fish tacos followed by 15 minutes at Nordy's. It's absolutely freezing in the office today, as my nipples clearly indicate, and it's aggravating my cough. I take swigs of Robitussin but it doesn't seem to be doing any good. Co-drones are getting annoyed with my cough but what am I supposed to do?  Ooh. Costco folks are here to do a presentation and they've brought breakfast. Gotta go.

       Upswing  Oh my god, I feel so high it's like I'm on drugs. I feel so elated that I can't feel my body. It's like I'm floating on a frizzy cloud. My heart is full because of the following reasons:  *It's fun to talk and giggle about boys again! (Thanks booboolina!) *Hapa Hotstuff who is the biggest metrosexual I've ever laid eyes on, smiled at me. I gave him the indifferent-chin-thrust while my face turned red. *Yesterday night, my mom reminded me that she still wants to take me to Argentina this summer! "Make sure you have enough vacation time," she said. *A weekend jaunt to NYC is in the works with Green Marble and quite possibly Dear Abby. *Yesterday night was the first practice of my brand new possible band. Keep your fingers crossed for this one! *Out of the six jobs I applied for, one called me back! Cross your fingers on the other hand!  Jeez louise, I am brimming with exclamation marks. But another thing that makes me feel a load better is XX bashing. This makes me feel most excellent when I ask his close co-workers what went wrong and two of them said separately and with these exact words: "He's a dog." Gross! I had sex with a dog! I accidentally had a beastiality!   I'm so glad I can laugh about it now. The only reason I can laugh is that I deleted him from my IM buddies list. That was the only way he was contacting me. Now, I have barred all contact. Everytime I'd see the window with his name, it was like a heart attack. Could this be the one? The one where he says he's sorry? No, it would always say something anti-climactic like, "Do you have fill-in-the-blank's CD?" Groan. Who needs the undue heart duress? Not I. Everytime he'd IM me, the fluffy world I was regaining would crumble. A mundane question would make me silent and moody and sad again. Who needs that? Not me. Especially not from a nasty mangey dog!

       Catching Up  My brother is interviewing The RZA and Jim Jarmousch for the paper and I'm on the phone all day with the incompetent people of Solano County (boring work stuff). It's really not fair, but I'm ever so proud of the little bastard. After all, he did sacrifice at least 4 good years of partying in favor of classics and The Economist. Now he gets to move to NY as a reward. Maybe we can become a brother-sister badass journalism team. It's true, I don't have any training, but he can edit my articles. Or instead of articles maybe we can write a book about growing up in the eastern block. I've actually been approached about this by parents of some of my friends, but had refused to even consider it since I had forgotten so many details of my life in the motherland (and because my writing isn't good enough). However, since G & I had practically identical upbringings (down to being in the same grade and music conservatory), he can fill in the blanks and edit the book. And then I'll be able to quit this rat race. See, I'm trying to think of things I can do with my life that don't involve data entry. My boss mentioned a coordinator position opening up soon and told me to 'think about it' but I don't know what that means - she either wants me to apply for the position or wants me to feel bad that I'm so behind on my work that they have to hire someone else to do all of my fun projects so that I can concentrate on stupid data entry. If I apply and don't get it, I will be very bitter and I will quit.   Still sick from a few weeks ago. I was doing better last week until they told us at Sunday's kayaking class that we have to learn rescue and recovery techniques. An hour later I was in the freezing bay waters hoping my partner would rescue me quickly. It's a very strange feeling capsizing your own kayak for the sake of practice, but that had been my biggest fear as a novice and now that I know I can survive the ocean waters, I can get better at this sport/leisurely activity/whatever it's considered. M agreed to do the 'full moon' paddle with me in May.  In other news, Mom and I are getting along famously. This weekend, I randomly told her that she treats me shitty by burdeoning me with all of her unrealistic expectations. She said no, I do that to myself and use her as a scapegoat. I then started crying pathetically and told her that I'm sorry she got so unlucky in this lifetime with a horrible daughter like myself. I don't know what she said after that because I was running away to my car in dramatic slo mo. I felt bad the whole day and went over there again that night to see if she was mad. Of course she is  never   mad at me, which also drives me crazy. She met me at the door holding a fruit salad in her hands and proceeded to feed me all kinds of other goodies. The next day, while hanging out at the cemetery with my fam (me, G, parents, two grammas), I made a pact with myself to try to accept these nutty people as they are not as I want them to be (cultured & refined) because I know they're thinking the same thing about me. Going well so far.  Today going out for a run with Green Marble. So far exercise has been limited to Bollywood dancing and Tae Bo at the house, but I think I need a good run. There's no better day than today to start that kinda thing, right?  Called M a few minutes ago. He's in DC on some photo conference. Instead on talking about my day, he made me look stuff up on the internet for 15 minutes for his photos, that little jerk. Made me miss him a little less.   Shit. Work Bryan just came over and said really loud "WHAT IS BLOGGER??!!".."I don't know. What the hell are are you talking about you psycho?" I answered. So I better get back to 'work'.

       A Blessing in Disguise   The disguise was a most esteem-crushing brutal break-up that left me naked and in tears, but on today, Day4, the depressive clouds are parting and then, a revelation: I’m a better person without XX. In the muddy shitty wake of this most awfully agonizing and humbling experience, I want to better myself and make myself proud of me.   This weekend I finally attached a masonry bit to a drill, drilled two holes in my impenetrable concrete wall, pounded in anchors, and screwed in my IKEA lamp by my bed for bedtime reading. Hooray! I’d put off this task for months, hoping that I could cajole XX into doing it for me… but since he’s out of my life, I took off my pants, pulled my socks up high, and did it myself. I’m a hero! Now I can read at night! I haven’t read a real book in three months! I mean, why read when you could be having orgasms, right? Well, I will still be having orgasms, but instead of the subsequent pillow talk and hours of snuggling, I’ll cool down by feeding my mind instead of my id.  Other goals for myself: install curtains, take more walks, learn to sew, watch more movies.  Unfortunately, I’m not always this gleeful and pragmatic. Truthfully, the breakdown is 19% glee, 68% abject glumness, 6% ugly snotty crying and 7% contemplation on what I should do with the rest of my life. 86% of the time I still hope that XX will show up with an enormous bouquet of roses and utmost remorse. I imagine him groveling and admitting that indeed I’m a goddess and he was a fool to let me go. We’ll get back together with newfound mutual understanding, then live happily ever after, giving each other space and encouraging each other’s art. The other 14% of the time I wish him a miserable life replete with crippling STDs and an occupation as scourge of the earth, causing women to turn their faces in horror and babies to cry in fear and shame. I usually follow these two trains of fantasy by some logical thinking…   When XX and I were together, I was a mess. I neglected my music entirely and only made a few crafts here and there. I would be really proud of the stuff I managed to conceive and make, but XX didn’t support me. I’d talk to him excitedly about painting frames and gluing ribbons to felt, but he’d only ignore me and talk about himself some more. Even though my art is on a small homey level, he didn’t think what I did was important. He couldn’t see its importance to me because he was anxiously waiting for me to finish so he could resume talking about himself.  XX annoyed me a lot, but I’ll miss a lot of things about him too, like his ridiculous sense of humor, his tenderness, and his awesome sexual prowess. He had a small tool, but was very good with his hands and his tongue. He knew my body better than I did. He showed me a lot of things and made sex exciting again. But now that he’s gone, I can continue my interest without him. If the objective of sex is climax, then I will do just fine on my own.  I'm still very pathetic though: I check my phone all the time, hoping that maybe he’ll call to apologize and desperately beg my forgiveness, pledging his undying devotion to me; or maybe that he’ll slip a letter under my door with tear-stained ink and descriptions of his miserable life without me. I know there’s a better chance of popsicles in hell than these things happening, but until the heartache subsides, I'll still hope.  I took really good care of him, calling to check up on him and making sure he was content, but he said he didn’t like that. I should’ve known since he’d never call me when he was on the road: I’d always call him. And if I didn’t call, we wouldn’t talk at all. Maybe it would’ve worked if I played hard-to-get and read “The Rules.” But love isn’t a game to me. When I love, I love fully, exposing all my vulnerabilities and raw edges. And though XX couldn’t handle it, I have no regrets. I loved him in the only way I knew how, and he wanted out. I was never dishonest or “played” him. Maybe he wanted to be played and if so, it’s a good thing he quit, so he could find a more suitable partner: one with a poker face instead of one who showed him she was glad to see him; one who will bluff instead of one who said honestly, “I missed you.”

       urlLink Tracy and the Plastics  @ BOTH 04-15-04     Openers: Paradise Island, The King Cobra  Bottom of the Hill, for one night, was queer city. All the bands were queer-identified, so Mission lezzies galore in da HIZZY! Too bad I don't like to eat pussy, because it was a veritable fest of lovely lesbionics. Did I ever tell you that I'm a wannabe lesbian? Lesbians are rad! The only thing stopping me from crossing over to lovin ladies is my infatuation with certain boys and my desire to fondle them.   urlLink Paradise Island  is a one woman band, namely, Jenny Hoyston, the singer of Erase Errata. I recognized her voice right away so her disguise of a bear hat didn't fool me. It was just her, an acoustic guitar, and a drum machine. Her post-punk singing is honed, but she needs some guitar lessons. She's got an album out already! Holy cannoli can a name get you a record deal! Call me old-fashioned, but I think record deals should be for those who can play their own songs. But I enjoyed her set very much. I'm just jealous that she has a record out and I don't.   urlLink The King Cobra  were awesome. Even though their bassist stayed home, the two chicks on stage rocked it. I had a gut feeling once they started, that they had to be the chicks from The Need. It was the stop-start angular drumming and the sputtery singing style of the drummer/singer. I knew it had to be her because she looked like she'd been drumming for decades. She was so self-assured and had no need for audience attention. Then at the end of the show I saw tattooed on the knuckles of her left hand: N-E-E-D. Yes! I am their new best friends!!! I loved The Need, and now, I love The King Cobra! Go lezzies!  Tracy and the Plastics I saw open the Electroclash tour, and she/they blew me away. It's only one singer, "Tracy", but she interacts with two alter-egos ("the Plastics" on a video screen, "Nikki" and "Cola"). In-between songs, they'll have actual conversations. And they're all so funny because they talk in exaggerated valley girl accents... like ME! And I love the music. It's electronic, but totally danceable and catchy, like The Faint. And the lyrics are sometimes abstract, sometimes heavy. This time around, the video girls even harmonized with Tracy when she sang! God, I love it!

       Heartache Relief   The best way to get over heartbreak is to make a boy list. Here's mine:  *Jimmy Fallon *Seth Cohen *Carlos De. (Interpol) *Paul Banks (Interpol) *Fabrizio Moretti (Strokes)  If any of these boys showed up at my work to whisk me across the Bay Bridge, that would  surely  make XX seethe with jealousy and regret. He would hate himself so much that he'd punch himself in the face and in deep-seated sadness his organ would remain permanently flaccid (insert wilting-flower-slide-whistle-sound-effect here). While boy-from-boy-list and I drove across the bridge the sun would sink lazily, casting its golden spread over our new love and rockin music would blast from heaven.  Also the new boy at work randomly asked me about my last name. I said, "Oh 'Apple' is a hybridized bastardized Vietnamese name. I'm Vietnamese but don't ask me to speak it because I'll only embarrass myself AND you." Turns out he's half-Vietnamese. Huh. I thought he was Filipino. Huh. That's what people usually think  I  am. Huh. He's probably in love with me. He will have to dump his girlfriend then for this Grade A snatch.  "Boys, boys, PLEASE. Get in LINe! There's a little slice of Apple for alla youse!"  (My awesome attitude comes from this exciting combo: I look especially awesome today, and XX came up to talk to me and he looked like absolute hell.  urlLink Schadenfreude !)

       I'm Tired.  I woke up crying this morning. Not actually crying, but making those sobbing sounds that people make when they cry. In fact, that's what woke me up. I didn't have actual tears on my pillow, but it was still disturbing. In my dream, which I actually remember, my parents couldn't understand me and I kept trying to talk to them in every language I knew and they still didn't register a goddamn word. Hmm. It's not that far off from real life now that I think about it, but it was much worse in my brain, trust me. I think my nightmare was due to the fact that I'm hanging out with them this weekend. We're going to the cemetary on Sunday and I'm sure it'll be a hoot. At least G is forced to come too.   In other news, I still hate my job. I started this campaign in my head last week to change my attitude. I decided that I would dress in a more proper attire (and wear bras!), speak in more proper business terms, be more pro-active (I HATE that word) in going after the projects that I'm interested in and communicate better with other drones, I mean co-workers. And every morning, as I come in and sit down and get really excited about my new positive attitude, I realize that I simply don't give a rat's ass about this job and I can't force myself to. This means that my campaign will surely fail. This also means that either a) I take this job for granted and don't I know that enjoying work and doing it well are in fact mutually exclusive or b) I should be working at a job that is more challenging and interesting. Maybe both. My boss emailed me (from her vacation in Europe no less)  that she wants to have a 'talk' on Monday. Maybe she has finally realized that I haven't done anything in the past year since it's so goddamned BORING here and will fire me.  Then I will receive unemployment while I search for something better. That or she will give me more boring projects to not do.

       A Rant to Get Me Through the Day   My friend/co-worker Mr.Hottie took me to lunch and told me a thing or two about men. He said that men don't want to make commitments because they're always waiting for the-next-hot-thing to come along. So they don't appreciate what they have.  And they don't know that they can't get the-next-hot-thing anyway.   This is sagely advice and confirmation that XX is a member of this vile specie. The timing was off in our brief romance. I was sandwiched in-between a booze-filled, vice-ridden,  urlLink rockabilly weekend in Vegas  and his  urlLink first adventure to Europe . During our long break-up talk, he kept saying that he wanted "to be free" without stating the specifics. From what I had to infer, he wants to be free to carouse the great continent of Europe and cavort with European women. He has grand allusions that Europe will change his life and broaden his worldview. He probably wants to be free to engage in fleeting affairs and make Euro-notches in his manly belt. Whatevs. I think he's a fool. He's 30 years old and the biggest fool. Because I'm awesome and he's never gonna get anyone as awesome as me again. Anywhere.  And this makes me feel smug too: in the aftermath of a break-up, you can press your friends to state their true opinions and 3 of them commented separately on his social awkwardness. Ha! This makes me feel great! I've actually heard this before but my love-goggles distorted my perception. I thought XX was perfect and wonderful, but now I see what people are talking about: he's flawed and makes people uncomfortable. Ha! I'm awesome and he's not. I kiss myself!

       Exit   The road that leads from Break-up-ville is unpaved and rocky, but it's not a lonely journey. Though I've traveled it before, it's unfamiliar. Last time somebody broke my heart was 6 years ago. Yesterday was Day1 of my new single life, pushing the two heart pieces back together, and there were certain people and certain things that made the journey less lonely and a bit smoother:  *catching a free  urlLink Metric  show at Amoeba, then Ethiopian food with dear Abby *a brand new episode of The O.C. and tea and cookies with Abby and Seth Cohen. *The "2-tone box set" (70s ska) on loan from my excitable music geek co-worker *A cell phone with W-gal on the line telling me she's driving by my house and waving. I'd just taken a shower so I waved at her through the wall.  In my glumness it's heartwarming to see people still genuinely excited about things. It makes me want to feel that way soon. And even though I'm heartbroken, I'm glad I have friends who'll help me turn the sobs into laughter.

       A Crime of Passion   I told XX yesterday that when he gets a gf, I will shoot her, shoot him, then shoot myself. He said, "Is that really worth going to jail for?" and I said, "You're not listening to me. I said that I would kill her, kill you, then kill myself! I wouldn't BE in jail if I was DEAD!" The worst part of this whole thing is that we work in the same office. I was warned twice not to "dip my nib in the office ink" but I dipped anyway because I was bored and horny. Oh well, this morning I have applied to three jobs so far. If any good comes out of all this pain and this empty sad feeling in my stomach is that I'm gonna get outta Dodge. And by Dodge, I mean Emeryville, CA.  For some sordid details, I will tell you that he said our relationship was getting too serious and moving too quickly. He doesn't want to commit to anyone and doesn't want to be anybody's boyfriend. Blah-blah-blah, yada-yada-yada. A lot of nice things were said too, but I blocked them out because essentially in my heart of hearts, I think he wants to sow his wild oats. He wants to sleep around some more before settling down. I may be off the mark, but that's what I feel instinctually in my gut. And he basically said that he doesn't like me that much.   Oh well. Sometimes I want to yell, "YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE!!! YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THIS!!!" but I've lived and loved enough to know that that's just stupid. I've got some pride left. And I know you can't force someone to love you no matter how awesome you are or how much make-up you wear. And, if you do get back together, you will doubt yourself the whole time anyways. And you will want to hurt them the way they hurt you. I know all this. That's why I said he could still give me his CD burner before I totally cut him off. Who says women make decisions based on emotions? I'm awed by my amazing rationale.  He says he still wants to be friends and "get together" sometimes, but I passed on the idea. Because who wants to sleep with someone you're in love with who doesn't love you back? That's the shittiest dynamic ever. That's too sleazy for me; because underneath the steely glare and venomous comments, I'm a mushy romantic. I'm going to wait for someone who will be in love with me too. I think that's something worth waiting for.

       Dumped   Ladies and gentlemen, XX has dumped me. After four hours of crying/ rational talking in my adult voice, I am now a free agent. I will tell you the sordid details later, but it's my right to do some bashing to regain some self-esteem. (I rise by stepping on others, right?) Here are the things I won't miss:  * Fatty fatness * Incessant Snoring * Overall Hairiness * Quadruple Wattle * Small Penis  I am actually in great pain and my nose is permanently tingling from all the crying, but I'll be fine. I've got great roommates, good friends, money in the bank, er,  credit on my cards , and I live in a 1st-world country. Plus, my mom is still alive and I have a magnificent family. And shoes. Boys may come and go, but great shoes are forever...  Plus, I'm going to Coachella with Abby.  To get me through this heartbreak, I have pinned Bart Davenport to my sweater. He will ward off anymore deranged rockabillies from sniffin round my cooch.

       Kurt Cobain: 10 years dead.    When I was in high school, I didn't really like Nirvana, but admired Kurt's lyrics and his dress aesthetic. Thurston Moore wrote an elegant eulogic tribute for the NY Times. Here's an excerpt:  "When Kurt died, a lot of the capitalized froth of alternative rock fizzled. Mainstream rock lost its kingpin group, an unlikely one imbued with avant-garde genius, and contemporary rock became harder and meaner, more aggressive and dumbed down and sexist. Rage and aggression were elements for Kurt to play with as an artist, but he was profoundly gentle and intelligent. He was sincere in his distaste for bullyboy music — always pronouncing his love for queer culture, feminism and the punk rock do-it-yourself ideal. Most people who adapt punk as a lifestyle represent these ideals, but with one of the finest rock voices ever heard, Kurt got to represent them to an attentive world."

       Ladies, To The Stage   I sent XX a copy of my Casual Dots show review because he took me and wanted to know what I thought. He liked the post but said I gave Masmelow a lot more credit than they deserved. "They were awful!" he said. "If I played like that, I'd be embarrassed to go on stage!" I said that's true because he's a guy. I then went on a long diatribe about why it's important for girls to play rock music which I'll go into details about here. Warning: this will be boring and warning: he totally tuned me out.  It's an important act in itself for girls to even pick up rock instruments and play them, because rock is a male-dominated territory. It's a quiet revolution when a girl does it, because there's a dearth of female rockers. Until Courtney Love, there were no female role models who encouraged girls to pick up guitars and claim ownership of rock instruments. Rock may be less than 100 years old, but the icons are all men. There's Elvis, The Beatles, U2, and an infinite list of others, but who are their female equivalents? Who's sold this many records? What female plays guitar and swivels their hips and charms the world? Madonna is pop. Wanda Jackson is barely known outside of rockabilly and music geek circles. We're not talking jazz vocals or MTV pop or electroclash (genres with a formidable female presence), we're talking about rock n' roll.  It's subversive for the two Masmelow girls to pick up an electric guitar and tap on the drums because they don't approach making music with the typical male bombast of swagger, virtuosity, and technicality. They play with simplicity and reserve. It's almost annoying because they're timid, even, but all the more reason for applause. Why? Because it's a bold effort for women to enter the arena, let alone two shy Japanese girls. XX said, "People only liked them because they were Japanese girls; if I was up there, they'd laugh their asses off." This is completely true. It's because the rock playing field is all dudes. Dudes have to work harder to make themselves stand out from the sea of other dudes. Dudes get guitars for Christmas and have dude rock icons to look up to. Dudes get the adulation and the supermodels. Ladies experience resistance from the beginning, whether from sexist sound guys or overly-critical press that may question merit vs. sexual promiscuity (ex: this week's article on The Peels in SF Weekly). There are so few ladies, that the few that play deserve respect, regardless of their ability. And "ability" is subjective anyway. The traditional term of ability could mean mastery of an instrument, knowledge of all chords, and speed. That belongs to the male realm of technicality. But how about the ability to write a good song? The playing field is levelled with a new definition, but the gender ratio remains inequal.  One can argue that there ARE female Japanese rock bands out there, and Masmelow deserve no credit. But are there? Let's name some: The Boredoms, Cibo Matto, Blonde Redhead, SSKHKH, Shonen Knife, Deerhoof. That's six I can name. SIX out of one gadzillion bands. And they all have cult followings, with no widespread success. I have nothing against all the dudes, but when I see a band of two Japanese girls making rock music (a profession/ hobby comprised of mainly white men) I will applaud and cheer them on. My post focused on the positive, which is that they have potential. The mere fact that these physically and culturally conspicuous ladies are taking the stage conveys a spark inside them. A spark that will broaden definitions and make footnotes, if not pages, in rock history. A spark that could turn into a flame into a fire that just may fuck shit up.*   They're playing music on their own terms. And though they sound simplistic and rough now, I will clap to encourage them to go home and write more songs and practice and continue playing shows. I'll clap for young sloppy girl bands until female rockers are no longer rare but common. And by common, I mean equal in population. For all the shows I go to and all the opening acts I endure, I'll make an educated guess that for every 12 rock guys, there is 1 rock girl. And that's pathetic. So I'm going to clap until my hands fall off for the 11 girls who have yet to take the stage.  (*fucking shit up can also be done in a polite non-aggro way)

       urlLink Bart Davenport  @ GAMH 04-08-12     urlLink Rogue Wave  opened and I like them a lot. Their guitarist Golden Gram is one of the lucky few in my framed rock stars collection. I still don’t know what color to paint the frame though. The point of this is that they’re good. They just got signed to Subpop and they prove that the SF scene is not only alive, but flourishing.  Bart Davenport can do no wrong. He’s my main man and I always have a good time when he’s around. He’s a chameleon and in last night’s guise he was a hippie. He assembled a band this time around, but it was not the same band as the rockin hip-hoppin funkjam band Abby and I saw ages ago at Bottom of the Hill and Amoeba. I didn’t recognize anyone in his band and I’ve seen him in two other band-type incarnations. He didn’t wear his aviator sunglasses and satiny members only jacket. He wore a hippie peasant shirt and bellbottoms and the people in his band wore the same.  Many words are tossed around about Bart--dismissive encapsulating words such as “California”, “singer-songwriter”, “retro”, “Eagles”, “Jackson Browne”, “James Taylor”, “70s”, but to me, he is a slice of heaven, if heaven was a pie filled with local songsters. My parents came to America in 1975, so I grew up in a bubble of Mozart symphonies and Vietnamese folk songs. My mind wasn’t marinated in the American collective consciousness, so I can’t classify BartD as a throwback to some other era. To me, I’m hearing beautiful new music and it’s special and wonderful and makes me happy. He’s so great that I paid no mind to his hippie gear. Anyone else would be ridiculed to no end, but Bart is excused because he exists on a higher plane.   I’ve seen him seven times now, and I hope to see him 7x7 more times. I love him!  Kelly Stoltz was the headliner and I’d seen him once before at Thee Parkside during his residency there. Back then, W-gal and I only stayed for a couple songs because we were tired, but I left really impressed. He’s a talented and experienced musician and I remember thinking: Elvis Costello. It’s rockin pop delivered by a scruffy guy. This time around I was excited to stay longer and enjoy his set, but after 7-8 songs, my excitement petered out. Though the songs are good, and he’s a great performer, he doesn’t have that magnetism that makes me want to stay til the end, buy his CDs, and put his picture into a frame. W-gal and R-dude were with me on this. So we all headed home before the show ended.

        urlLink Casual Dots  @ The Hemlock 04-06-04      Opener: Masmelo  Masmelo: 2 cute Japanese girls in matching outfits. Very minimal. A post-White-Stripes Shonen Knife. Meaning, they're cute, but in the wake of the White Stripes blues-garage global conquest, there are smitchens of bluesy riffs in-between the cutesy verses. And by bluesy, I don't mean Howlin' Wolf black man blues, but Jack Whitey blues filtered through a Japanese-cute sieve. Gone is the grit and the dirt, the pain and the done-me-wrong woe. Present is a Hello Kitty attempt at soul. I think if these girls keep at it for four years, they'll conquer the world. Their hearts are in the right places, but they've got to learn some skills and gain some conviction. Also, say their name out loud: Masmelo. That's right. Too cute!  Casual Dots: They're on Kill Rock Stars. Stir together Kathi Wilcox from Bikini Kill and Christina from Slant 6. Add one drummer to the mix. What have you got? Solid Kill Rock Stars fare. I had a picture of Kathi Wilcox and Kathleen Hanna on the wall of my teenage bedroom and thought they were the epitome of cool in their miniskirts and ripped stockings. Seeing Kathi play for the first time, I was disarmed by how normal she seemed. She smiled like a normal person; she talked like a normal person; she wore black tights and plain vans like a normal person. I expected a sneer and a cooler-than-you attitude, but instead she was cool because she'd grin and laugh at her mistakes. Now THAT'S cool.  They covered an Etta James tune and during their encore they played another old soul song. If Christina likes singing the soul, why doesn't she incorporate it into her own songs? I think this is the logical direction, Christina. Take heed!  No other observations except her voice reminds me of Mel C. (Sporty Spice): same phrasing, same reedy tone. Who else can hear it? Hands?

       ****   M rings the buzzer at 9:40. On the way upstairs, he asks what I want to do. "Um...I was thinking we can have a little talk." "Are you serious?" he asks. "Yes." I say with a big sadistic smile, because to my own surprise, I am actually going through with it. It was fun for a while, but now, I had decided, it's time to end things. When we get upstairs and inside my room, I verbally diarrhea every thought that has been going through my head for the past two weeks. I generally suck at breaking up. Talking about 'our relationship' with my S.O. has never come naturally, so for this, I had gone through some serious mental preparations while engaging in the following activities: hour-long drives up and down Golden Gate Park, midnight cigarettes on our faux-balcony, solitary lunches on the roof garden (yes, I am at my emoest). At 26, and after years of therapy, I still lack the ability to communicate in ways that are not passive-aggressive. Of course I thought he would anticipate this because I hadn’t spoken to him all weekend, piled all of his 'forgotten' belongings in the middle of my room, refused sex, repeatedly told him that he’s unlovable. Strangely, he didn't. And more strangely, this is much easier than I thought. I thought I would be a mumbling, crying mess. But instead I'm composed, articulate, and deliver every sentence like I'm reading a children's book to a group of 5-year-olds.  Sitting on my bed in a sweater that makes him look less anorexic and thus slightly handsome, he looks confused for a few seconds but soon agrees with my assessment that our level of cruelty has crossed the line. “However,” he points out in a tone reserved for solving a math equation, “with our heightened levels of sarcasm, treating each other with respect and kindness may never be our thing. Besides, I didn’t know this was making you unhappy.” “Well, now you do”. We sit there for a while, waiting for the asnwer to drop down from the ceiling. I page through a magazine, he bites his nails. "Ok, now that you know all this, I guess the most diplomatic thing to do is to wait another week and re-evaluate things next Tuesday. If we can't change our dynamics, we’ll just be friends," I say..."That sounds good". Because after all, break-ups are all about diplomacy.   When we go to bed, he tries to be nice as I've instructed him to. He asks about my day, strokes my hair, shows me the cool new things his Mac can do, tells me about his press awards ceremony. It's sweet but seemingly contrived. I try not to make any decisions one way or the other. I guess we'll do that at the end of the judgment week (= last guaranteed-to-get-laid week).

        urlLink The Sounds  @ GAMH 04-05-04      Maja is a superstar. She's everything a rock star should be. She's brassy and bold. Irreverent and funny. Cute as a button but in an edgy tough she'll-kick-your-ass way. She's Joan Jett for the younger set. She'll glare and scowl at the audience, then flex her arm to make a muscle and kiss it. "Do you want to hear another hit?" she'll call out. The audience cheers and she continues, "cause we only play hits!"   Reasons Abby and I were glad we stood a ways back:  1. Unexpectedly, Maja dives off the stage into the crowd. It wasn't that packed, mind you. In fact, it was kind of sparse that night. She kind of sunk as an army of weak indie arms hoisted her back onstage.  2. After smoking a cigarette, she flicks it, still lit, into the audience. Ouch!  Reason I've had my fill of The Sounds: their relevance. After seeing them for the third time, I am questioning this. Their new songs sound like their old songs and all the songs are sounding the same to me. The synth guy knows he is extracting a distinctively 80s sound. How will he manipulate it to move The Sounds onward from novelty throwback to something current and fresh? How are they going to step into 2004? They don't have the versatility of the YYYs or the emotional range. They have an equally dynamic lead singer, but I feel they're going to stunt their growth if they don't show some vulnerability. All metal bands always have one slow rocker: Extreme's "More Than Words" and Guns N' Roses' "Don't You Cry" for example. Unless The Sounds grow, they're going to remain entrenched in 2003.   What am I talking about? Don't listen to me. They're one of the highlights of Coachella! I can't wait to see them in the hot sweltering heat! I wanna hear that synth blast through the desert air!

       urlLink Azure Ray  @ Cafe du Nord 04-04-04     Opening Bands: Okkervil River,  urlLink The Elected   I met up with my co-worker LingL because she's a diehard Azure Ray fan.  I'd seen Azure Ray in December at BOTH, opening for Crooked Fingers but I was too nervous (my first date with XX) to pay attention. I remember it being really slow, but my heart was racing. It's hard to be attentive when you're freaking out and really anxious. After the show, W-gal burned me their CD, Hold on Love, which after several listens becomes stronger and stronger. It's a solid album, if you like slow sad music. So for this show, I was prepared. I knew one album intimately and I also drank a strong cup of coffee.   Okkervil River: OK, kind of boring.   The Elected: Solid. Alt-countryish w/ the right amount of noise. Great melodies. They're on Subpop and the lead singer is also in Rilo Kiley. (Listening to the CD, the first song is totally Chris Isaak, while the rest of the album is acoustic guitar with some jangly countryish twang, but the singing/mood is whispery and melancholic like Elliot Smith.)  Azure Ray: Beautiful. Beautiful show. My favorite of the two girls is Orenda. She's the non-goth. Her singing and delivery is so subtle, but so moving. Her delicate facial expressions and the sad vibrato of her clear voice is balm to my heart. I got a lump in my throat during the first song she sang because it was so quiet and sad and pretty. The girls barely strum and they barely sing above a quiet indoor voice but this time around, I understood. I got it. I get it.

       urlLink Les Sans Culottes  04-02-04 @ BOTH     Openers: CocoRosie,  urlLink Rene Risque and the Art Lovers   CocoRosie: Two Sisters, one Bjorkish with a scratchy squeaky craggy voice, one with a vibrato-heavy opera voice. Bjork sister played on children's instruments and a toy car that made noises, the opera singer chose the more conventional instruments of keyboards and guitar. When the Bjork sister sang, Abby remarked, "She is half-girl, half-sheep" because she didn't so much sing, as bleat. It's like when you're a kid and you try to make the sound of a creaky door with your voice. Kind of like "ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah" Now imagine someone singing like that. I enjoyed their set a lot because of the strange weird singing from both these sisters. In a club setting, hearing someone casually sing opera while picking a guitar is really weird as is someone bleating like a goat while playing a small car.  Rene Risque were a bunch of broadway singers in a faux-band. It was very Hedwig in that they all played characters, had glammy clothes on (wigs and platform shoes), and played glammy 70s-style Hedwig-esque rocknroll. Too campy for my taste. I go to shows for whispered vocals and hearts on sleeves or straightforward rocknroll from earnest Swedes, but not for canned camp. RR&tAL were a cabaret act that belonged in a seated theater, not BOTH. At the merch table, they sold shirts that said "I fucked Rene Risque" and I was grossed out at that idea. It's meant to be funny because Rene is supposed to be this jet-set-fun-loving-ladies-man-type, but to me he looked just like Andy Dick. And Andy Dick is an ugly man.  Les Sans Culottes--Another hokey concept band. I had high hopes for LSC because I knew they were from Brooklyn and sing in high school French, but I thought they'd evoke Serge Gainsbourg and Umbrellas of Cherbourgh, not frenetic 60s gogo style. They were ridiculous in their campy outfits with one singer named Celine Dijon and the other called Kit Kat Le Noir. I wasn't impressed by their hyper need for attention and the sheer amount of band members on stage: 7. How many people does it take to start a band? These days, 2. Historically, 3-5. More than 5 is suicide. I convinced Abby that they were no good and we left after three songs.   BTW, XX was there with a bunch of his friends and he stayed for LSC's set and enjoyed them. He said they did a cover  in French of "These Boots Were Made For Walking", which made me yawn uncontrollably. I prefer my music with a little angst or misery. People say I should stop going to shows blindly and listen to the music first, but I don't really care. For every Les Sans Culottes and Rene Risque, there's a worthwhile CocoRosie. And I love going to shows!

       urlLink Nellie McKay  @ The Independent 03-31-04     Abby and I went to this show on a lark because Nellie was described as "a cross between Doris Day and Eminem." Also, in ElleGirl she stated that she likes to roll her hair and use her grandma's perfume. We arrived during Beth Waters' set, and everyone was politely seated at the tables set up. There were candles on the tables and Beth Waters was crooning some angelic song about babies or geese or heaven or something. It was the most annoying vanilla atmosphere I'd ever been in and I wanted to retch at every table and snuff out their candles. We looked around and everyone had flat hair and flaccid clothes. It was an invasion of khaki, denim, and understated stud earrings... BORRING! We were on an alien planet where a bongo drum was part of the drumkit. I turned to Abby and apologized profusely for bringing her to a show that had a bongo drum. And Beth Waters didn't help either. She was the epitome of serene vanilla-tude. She doesn't like to fuck, she wants to make vanilla love and make vanilla babies. Beth Waters sounded like the object of sex is to experience the joys of impregnation, gestation, and the female wonder of childbirth. Woman wanted to have babies and be Earth Mother! Unfortunately, her awful bowlcut may discourage potential hetero suitors.    Abby and I shuddered at the awesome lameness of our surroundings and the dull people who'd remark on the awesome bongoing of the bongo drum.  But when Nellie came on, she saved us. We stayed for her whole set because she is spiffy, sarcastic, irreverent, boldly political and entertaining as all hell. And she IS a cross between Doris Day and Eminem. She'll sing a sultry torch song in a rich jazzy voice, but her lyrics will be clever and modern, like, "Give me head/ Or you're dead." Her piano playing is stuff of recital legend, and yes, she had big poufy rolled hair and a vintage-y ensemble. So so charming. She's a clever and talented young lady and despite the gut-wrenchingly disappointing ordinariness of the sterile audience, I had a great time.   Here's a great Nellie quote from a  urlLink fansite :    "I think it's such a shame when people are taken surprise by fame. I think they should just quit then, and leave the playing field open for me. Because I really want it."    Doppelganger Alert :    =   ?

       Sunny Sunday  On Sunday I spent the entire morning making fruit salad that I learned from Jan Weir from KQED's Weir Cooking in the City. She has an annoying phony personality, but she's starting to grow on me. Anyway, the trick I learned from her is white wine marinade. A little Muscat wine, some honey, some orange rind, some juice, and voila, it's like a bowl of sangria-flavored fruit. Went to my brother's BBQ for his gf's bday and ate 1 cheeseburger, 1/2 a polish sausage, and 1 hamburger patty. And mac n cheese and fruit salad. Then the whole lot of us went to see  urlLink Saved!  at the Metreon. That movie was great. I'm a new fan of Jena Malone. She will save us all.  Then Green Marble and I went home and fragranced the apartment with parfums d'posterieur... then there was a trumpeting contest... Ok, I'll stop now.

       Sizzlin Saturday  I made some chicken breast sandwiches and wrapped them with waxed paper. At noon XX came by in his truck and we drove over the Golden Gate Bridge towards Mt Tam. I'd never been there before and he wanted to take me. We drove up relentlessly curvy, winding roads and I got carsick. When we got to the top, I stepped out of the car, burped a few times, and was fine.   We hiked along a trail, dodged gigantic birds, and ate our sandwiches. I had to rest a few times because I'm unaccustomed to activity. We saw some great views and downtown SF seemed almost like a page from a pop-up book. It's hard to appreciate a famous skyline if you live within it and don't have the perspective to see its stately silhouette. XX pointed out San Quentin, the home of Charles Manson and the Menendez Brothers. It was so quiet up there, at the top of the mountain; serene and almost somber. We snapped a few photos, hiked some more, then drove home.  On the way home we stopped by an inn for some beer. I was wearing a tight white shirt and when I washed my hands before we left, I noticed that in the mirror, my shirt was practically see-through. And I wasn't wearing a bra. I hope this'll make me more popular with boys. It certainly made XX a big fan of me. ;) ;)  Afterwards I took a nap and he went home. At night I was going to see a show with LingL.   urlLink Sondre Lerche  @ Slim's 05-29-04    The opener was some Tori Amos knock-off that looked like Topenga from "Boy Meets World". LingL kept faux-requesting under her breath, "Cornflake Girl! Play Cornflake Girl!" Dude, last time Sondre played at Cafe du Nord, the opener was a Fiona Apple knockoff named Rachel Yamagata. Say what you will about her, hype her all you want teen magazines, she is second-rate. They both are. They ape their influences but then water it down to a bland state. It's like calling something kimchee when it's really just boiled cabbage.    The upside to this, is that when Sondre finally came on, it was a blessing. Thank the heavens that opening crap was corked! Save me Sondre! His voice is remarkable and he is such a sweet singer. And the band was the happiest band I'd ever seen, god bless those Norwegians. They grinned from ear-to-ear the entire time. All of them. They looked so happy to be onstage and playing music. They were having a ridiculously good time and the vibe was infectious. Sondre with band is much better than solo Sondre. He rambles less and rocks out more. And from the Faces Down album there's a duet called "Modern Nature", which at Cafe du Nord, Abby and I were quietly singing the counterpart to under our breaths, but at Slim's all the teenage girls were singing it loudly together. Not only does Sondre sound like Donovan, will he be elevated to Donovan heartthrob status? Is it straight from Slim's to The Shoreline Amphitheater opening for No Doubt? I hope not. He's so earnest and sweet. If he starts going out with Winona, I will crack his CD over my knee.   Here's a more comprehensive  urlLink review  by my favorite Chronicle writer, Aidan Vaziri.

       Friday Fun  I guess you could call it a date. I made dinner for XX then we went to the Dali exhibit. Then he took me to the Treat St. Bar, which I'd never been to. This is a tiny bar filled with taxidermy. Taxidermy both fascinates me and gives me the heebie-jeebies. He bought me an Apple Martini which made me Drunk. The 2nd round I ordered a pear cider to calm down and the bartender was like, "The martini wasn't good?" and I drunkenly assured him it was breally vberry gooood and XX said, "Yup, maybe TOO good" and the bartender laughed. Then we headed to BOTH to go see a show.   urlLink Gravy Train  &  urlLink Ex-Girl  @ BOTH 05-28-04      Last time I saw Gravy Train, their equipment broke down and they didn't know how to fix it. There was a frustrating time lapse while they pretended to figure out their Casios. Their new member - this out-of-shape skivvies-only-clad black dude - "entertained" the crowd by inviting audience members to simulate fellatio on his crotch. It was downright dees-gusting and I left because it wasn't funny to me. It's funny when Chunx is raunchy because she's smart and tongue-in-cheek and respectful of boundaries. When this new guy does it, it's offensive because he doesn't perform with a wink and a smile--he's aggressive and bossy.  I clued XX in on Gravy Train when he was making beats on his drum machine last year, and he likes them. I figure, he should check them out because Chunx and Funx are awesome entertainers. Totally John Waters-y because, well, they're full-figured women with a knack for outrageous style and sass. We would just have to ignore the new member.   Their set was alright. Chunx and Funx are losing their baby fat and looking more like women. Their music is exactly the same -- house party music; the new guy was there -- running around grossly in his tighty-whities and baring his butt all over the place: it's the same old 'Train. They've been around a while now, but they still don't know their way around their equipment. They need to move on. Find a producer. Chunx is supremely talented and is capable of better things.   Ex-Girl are from Japan and man, I wish I wasn't crashing right when they took the stage (week-long morning shift--waking up at 4:30am). I checked out their merch before they went on and it took up an entire table and wall. There must've been over 40 items for sale ranging from polka-dotted canvas handbags and bright vinyl totes to pencil pouches. I bought a lime-green terry-cloth frog water bottle holder because it was a frickin terry-cloth frog water bottle holder! I love Japan!   They took the stage in elaborate flower costumes with gigantic iridescent petals framing their faces. They did art-y dances as flowers. They played some songs. Then they removed the petals and revealed huge puffy colorful wigs. Their music was punchy art-rock. They reminded me of Devo. XX said they were really good. And I was crashing. I'd close my eyes for a second and start dreaming while standing up. My eyes were streaming tears from the lack of sleep. Bye-bye Ex-girl. Maybe next time.

       Kiss and Make Out  I am making out with XX again, but only because I like to kiss. We hang out sometimes but more not than often. He is more tolerable and charming this way and I am my best self. I still find him handsome and sexy but I no longer inquire or care about his feelings towards me and I'm no longer annoyed nor elated by him. I'm redistributing my eggs and I'm deciding whether his one egg will be poached or rotten. I have more though. Here are the baskets that each carry one or more eggs:   Playing music  at Lennon Studios with SJ and J-Wo. The familiar ache and hardening of my fingertips is a great feeling.   Fiddling around in the kitchen.  Yesterday while Green Marble and Scooter ran laps and laps around a track and I watched them from the bleachers, I had a revelation: White Sauce Lasagna. Like an Alfredo Lasagna. I am thinking chicken and ricotta and roasted garlic and sun-dried tomatoes and chestnuts. I told GM & S my great idea and they, being gourmands, said white sauce lasagna has been done and were skeptical of the chestnut idea. They will see. I'm not a genius when it comes to making up recipes, but I am very creative and have great ideas. Though my risk-taking is hit-or-miss. Once when I was a very little kid, I wanted to "be punished" like how kids are on family TV so I announced that I would make dinner for everyone. No one knew what I was talking about cuz I was a little kid and how could I possibly make dinner. My aunt was preparing food in the kitchen so I took a big cup and filled it with scoops of rice, thit kho (salted pork), and vegetables. Then I poured orange juice to the top. When my parents and my brother came home, I said look! I made dinner, then demonstrated how to consume it by taking in mouthfuls of meat, rice, and OJ simultaneously. I thought it was delicious. My brother begged for an alternative. My parents laughed. My family sat down to their conventional dinner while I continued gulping down OJ and pork.   The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. This is the novel of novels in my book, er, world. The notoriety, the dense prose, the volume. I am completely intimidated by its formidable reputation. Thus I've convinced LingL and XX to read it with me. They rip through books, so I have a healthy dose of competition to keep my mind on the text at hand. We've formed a book club and it's called " The Kool Kids Book Klub ." There are no perks or rewards but there ARE membership cards which I crafted yesterday. I've made slots for six books to be read together by Kool Kids. Any joiners? The only thing you have to do to join is start reading The Satanic Verses and try to finish it within a reasonable amount of time. Oh, and you have to be kool.   I'm also trying to  exercise  more, but I'm not sporty or outdoorsy at all. When I tagged along with Green Marble and Scooter to the Kezar track, they ran at least 7 laps, and me? I pooped out after 3/4 of one. 3/4 of a lap and totally winded. Plus, I only have my sleepytime sweatpants that lost its drawstring years ago. My pants couldn't stay up! I had to choose between exercise and modesty. It wasn't my total surrender to fatassy-ness and sloth that made me take a seat and dream up white lasagna. It's because I'm a modest Christian. Butt cleavage is the devil's tools, doncha know.

        urlLink Bart Davenport  @ Hotel Utah 05-25-04     XX and I went to see BartD play solo/acoustic last night. We met up with LingL and her friend Charo at The Hotel Utah, which is a bar with a small stage. I asked the bartender to make me a drink that involved ginger or ginger ale and she made me a Jack & Ginger, which was ginger ale and Jack Daniels. BartD was sitting two seats down from us at the bar and XX kept threatening to start a conversation with him. It's a threat because I'm adamant about never meeting him or talking to him because what if he's mean? What if he's in a hurry and doesn't have time to talk to me? What if he looks over my shoulder or looks around the room while I'm talking to him? It ruins the fantasy! My fantasy isn't that complicated: I imagine that he's nice, likes to go camping, and sing songs for his friends. Also, that he has asthma and allergies and isn't a whore.  I tried to contain my excitement and girlish glee when I watched him play because I didn't want to look like a big goofy dork, but occasionally I'd look over at XX, who the entire time was grinning from ear-to-ear like an idiot, god lovim. I led XX into the wonderful world of Bart Davenport and now he's equally smitten. It's his 5th show. He even went once without me.   I love BartD. The only drawback of going to see your favorite performer at a sparsely-populated intimate venue is that you can't sing along. You must not, because if you do, everyone will hear you and the performer may even shush you as you will be louder than he is.   The headliner was Red Thread, who we didn't stay for. Charo and LingL said they were great. Next time. If they OPEN for Bart.  This was my 8th BartD show. He should just have some kids so I can send them to college. Next time I'll just skip the formalities and stuff bills directly into his pockets.

       ***  I've been feeling a little crazy the past couple of days, which culminated with me drinking a small glass of absinthe last night and throwing it up in my toilet three panic-stricken, embarrassing minutes later along with everything else I had eaten. There was also the incident on Sunday night/Monday morning of yelling at the parking attendant at SFO for taking too long with a car three cars in front of me. Having read the sign that said “$1 for every 12 minutes”, I asked him whether “I can get a dollar off for having waited in the fucking line for at least 12 minutes”...He didn’t say anything.   Last night, while submerged underwater in my bathtub, where I do all my best thinking, I realized that I’m doing these foolish things because M is pissing me off so bad I want to rip his balls off, but instead I have completely shut down. It was after my bath that I drank the absinthe in one big gulp and while back in the bathroom staring at the inside of my toilet, I realized that I would rather have my sanity than M.   So I finally told him everything. About how happy I was when he called me from DC to tell me that he misses me and how much I looked forward to seeing him and how I thought that we had finally gotten over our growing pains and that things could now be great, even if only for three weeks. And then I told him how he shattered my fantasies in less than a minute when he came out of the plane hugging some girl from his conference and then came up to me and asked me for his cigarettes without as much as a hello. I said I didn’t want to go camping this weekend with him and his friends and that I want space until our road trip. He said that if I didn’t go he didn't want to go either. We went back and forth for a while (while simultaneously reading subtitles of  Shoalin Soccer ) until I agreed to think about it. So I'm thinking (about what a fucking dickhead he can be).

       Weekend in Review    Fri  -- Target shopping w/ Abby and her bro, the funniest comedy duo ever.      --  spent the night with my aunt. she just got out of the hospital. I can muse on cancer, but that'll be too depressing. Let me just say that the worst part of cancer is being mentally present, lucid, and acutely apprehending the deterioration of your own body.    Sat  -- Abby picked me up and we went thrift shopping in Redwood City. We went to Stacks pancake house and I tried to like pancakes again. Semi-successful. Then we went to Nordstrom, then Haight St. Between us, 4 pairs of shoes were bought.  I will not tell you the ratio of how many shoes to which Apple because that would only embarrass someone who is not myself. ;) At night we collaborated on an evening meal which consisted of runny polenta(me), chicken with basil and mushrooms(me), and a fresh salad(she) and roasted vegetable medley(she). After dinner I met up with W-gal and R-dude at the Quasi/ Sleater-Kinney show.    urlLink Sleater-Kinney  &  urlLink Quasi  @ The Fillmore 05-22-04    The music, fantastic. Janet Weiss, mesmerizing as always. Time magazine once named Sleater-Kinney "best rock band" and it's easy to see why. Janet Weiss is a phenomenal drummer, Carrie Brownstein has got some dextrous guitar fingerwork, and Corin Tucker, what a voice! And they all do double-duty: both Janet and Carrie sing back-up and Corin plays rhythm guitar. They are really good at what they do. I think they're not more popular because they're women, and their music is an acquired taste. It's a little inaccessible because it's not instantly catchy or toe-tappy. When I first listened to them in 1997 (Dig Me Out) I had to get used to Corin's wavery almost-operatic voice and their unrelenting self-seriousness and the challenging song structures. But once you get used to it, it's really rewarding. They can play, and they're not apologetic or deprecating about it.  During S-K's set, I kept smelling grilled meat and onions. ???   Quasi is a drumming showcase. Sam Coomes, the singer/ keyboardist provides light pop fare for Janet Weiss to spectacularly drum to. That's how I see it anyway. I pay no attention to him, only to her, for she is amazing. (The local opening band was Whysall Lane. They were alright. I'd seen them before opening for Erase Errata.)   ***    Sunday  -- Had brunch at Miss Minnie's with Abby and LingL. I had a peach puree mimosa. I'm making conscious efforts to drink more, to decide whether I even like to drink. I didn't before, and now with the influx of fruity girl-oriented soju drinks and delicious cocktails like sake martinis, I'm reassessing my stance. When I was with Dizzy D, he was an irresponsible drunk to the embarrassing point of being obnoxious in front of my friends and in restaurants, peeing on sidewalks, puking, not being able to get home, and passing out in our hallway. To every yin there is a yang, and in that relationship he was the selfish, puerile drunk so I had to be the mature responsible sober one. This is no longer the case, as I am a free agent now.  Afterwards LingL and I went to the Lumiere to see  urlLink The Saddest Music in the World  which was almost a waste of time. It's an arty film done in a German expressionistic style, but it was bad. I almost wanted to walk out because the dialogue was weak, the acting mediocre, and the film just plodded along without any depth or meaning. It was visually very appealing, but tedious because it was bad in all other aspects. It was neither sad, funny, or engaging; it was very bland and lacked chemistry between the actors and a core of cohesion. In the evening, Abby and I had a Sex and the City marathon. We watched all the episodes of the current season just released on DVD. I cried 3x. That show is very moving at times.  And that was my weekend.

       Present Test Answers  He told me he got me a present and that I had to wait for it. I came up to his cubicle and kissed him in glee and anticipation. He took out a bag and reached inside. He handed me a mini-Eiffel Tower. We walked to get lunch and I said, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kissed you." He said, what you don't want to get into that again? I said nothing. He smiled and said what, you got a fella now? and I shrugged.  I don't have anybody. But I'd rather have nobody than somebody who gives me a stupid nothing.  Later he said he wanted to take me out on a date and I said no thanks. He said what's wrong? What's changed?  And I said, "I think I deserve better."

       I Hate You, Yahoo.  I stayed up til 1 last night writing M's paper on workplace reforms in China. I was supposed to merely  proofread   and  polish   it, but seeing as it lacked a coherent introduction, conclusion, thesis, and most of the other components that tie an academic paper together, I couldn’t help but add those in. He's away on internship training this week and gave me his email password so that I could email the paper to his professor from his account, which I did in the wee hours of the morning. I should have closed the window that moment and left it at that, but instead I took this opportunity to peruse through his inbox...The first few pages were unopened adds for Viagra and hot girl on girl action. I could've stopped there and now dearly wish I would have, but my curiosity got the best of me, so I hit  next   until I found and yes folks, read about 25 emails from two of his ex-ladies. There were emails about school, his job, their travels together, apology letters, love letters, plans for the future, plans for dinner. Though they were from four years ago and earlier, reading each one was like a punch in the stomach. It's obviously my own fault for opening the Pandora’s box, but now I feel shitty and cheap and the words exchanged between them ages ago are going to haunt me for the remainder of our soon-to-be-defunct-anyway relationship. I feel like Hronn Sveinsdottir must have felt in “In the Shoes of the Dragon” when she badmouthed Miss Iceland pageant on the radio and thought she had lost her chances of winning. Great documentary, btw, made by and starring Hronn, who, coincidentally, looks a lot like one of M’s two exes. Fuck you, cosmic forces, fuck you!! (And I'm sorry.)

       The Present Test 	 XX called me yesterday from his layover in Detroit and we had a brief chat. He blurted out, "You don't have a mini-Eiffel Tower yet, do you?" and I said no. If that fucker gives me a mini-Eiffel Tower, then I'm going to turn off all feeling for him. A mini-Eiffel Tower isn't a present that a lover gives--it's reserved for friends and family. My confidantes tell me that I can do better than XX/Fucko, but what if I just want to make out with someone  now ? This is the eternal dilemma. But to put my life in perspective, what would I rather have, immediate gratification or something better in the long run? Something better in the long run, I guess. Someone special who doesn't come home from Europe and present me with a mini-Eiffel Tower. If I get this mini-monument, I'll be disappointed, because there's nothing special about it--it's a common cheap trinket found all over Paris--and thus, it'll mean that there's nothing special between me and XX.   Details to come regarding the results of... THE PRESENT TEST.

       Homecoming   XX sent me an email today saying that he was coming home tomorrow and if I wanted, I could meet him at the airport. I emailed back and said no I already made plans and I'll see him some other time. I don't ditch my friends for Euro-losers who can't give a girl advance notice about things. I've been planning to see Supersize Me for a week now, and I ain't giving up a popular  and  critically-acclaimed movie to meet some ambivalent doofus at the motherfuckin airport! Know what I'm sayin?!!

       Self-Punishment in Form of Fish   Well, ladies and gents, I have reached a new low in the finance department. I am referring to my dental office check bouncing. It hasn't happened yet, but it will tomorrow when it is deposited by the nice folks who ripped out my molars. Upon finding out that my current checking account balance is $0.00, I hurriedly transferred some money from my credit card into my checking account (since I bank online now), but I don't know if it will get there in time. The reason I'm so low on cash is because I've been paying ridiculous amounts of cashmoney toward my credit card debt these few months in an overzealous attemp to become debt-free and, thus, spend (cautiously) on myself again.   To punish self for this blatant lack of responsibility, I went back to the freezer at Walgreen's a few minutes ago and picked up a cheap lunch - Stouffer's Fish Fillet and Cheesy Shell Pasta, which I'm eating right now. It's no Japanese mountain vegetable soba noodles which I normally get on Mondays (for a whopping $8!), but I've made up a game in my head that has made it fun to eat. In this game I pretend that I'm in prison and this is served in the prison cafeteria for lunch. For prison food, this stuff ain't bad. I think I just tasted a hint of lemon on the fish fillet!  Ok I'm done. I wrapped the tray in the walgreens bag because if I keep smelling it, I'm going to yarf.  (soon to be) Debt No More in 2004, Abby

       Things I Did This Weekend   Fri night : Made a spicy bulgogi, and cut up pork tenderloin for the first time... with a bad knife. Bad knife = struggle! Tearing and ripping, not clean slicing! Not like Julia and Jacques on the TV!  Sat : I had plans to see the Art Deco exhibit at the Legion of Honor, but my brother called at the last minute and we (and his GF) visited my aunt in the hospital at Stanford. She has cancer. On the way home, we went to Wing Lee bakery on 6th & Clement and got dim sum. I like my brother's GF because even though she's white, she likes to try everything. She got 6 rice balls and I was like I've never had those, what are they like? and she shrugged and giggled, "I've never had them either!" They were pretty good. It's sticky fried rice with bits of pork and green onions shaped into the size of golf balls. Quite tasty! When I got home, I watched half of Planet of the Apes. At night I bought all these cleaning supplies and scrubbed my toilet and tub. I also bought all these books from Green Apple: 3 are sex-related, and 1 is called "Crafty Girl". I can read them all and incorporate my knowledge into one grand project: a dreamcatcher for my cootch.            At night, watched SNL w/ Abby & co. Lamented  urlLink Jimmy Fallon 's hot-hot-hottie departure. SNL, hire more hotties! More stimulating droolifying eye candy! More handsome sluts to read your off-camera cue cards! Jimmy, why??!!!  Sun: had a drink at brunch w/ Abby & co., hung out with J-wo and bought Elton John 70s sunglasses, had 2 mimosas w/ Mr.Hottie on Haight St and got DRUNK, drunkly watched him try on shoes, went home and tried to do some drunk yoga, but collapsed in drunk heap and decided to take nap instead. after nap, met up w/ Abby again and watched a movie at the Women's Building that was part of the documentary festival. went home and fell asleep early.

       urlLink The Distillers  @ The Fillmore 05-13-04     Brody has blonde hair now and she looks like  urlLink Brittany Murphy . (Brittany Murphy playing Courtney Love, Abby remarked astutely.) Watching Brody makes me long for Courtney Love. Courtney circa 1994. Courtney before she became a C-list drug-addicted attention-seeking wash-up. Geez, Courtney, get it together! Learn from your imitator. Get off the drugs! Take care of your kid! Play some good music! Brody started out as a Courtney-wannabe, but if she keeps at it, she's gonna exceed Courtney herself. Courtney, Courtney, where did your love go?  With me at the show were Abby, W-gal, and R-dude. The entire gang was there. We were there to be pushed to the side by the enormous violent mosh pit. Holy Hay-zoos am I getting old!

       60 Years of Solitude  I am resigned to a new life of hermetic solitude. No, not resigned, more like I am preparing myself. It would be romantic and literary to call my new life plan "100 Years of Solitude" but I'm 26 now. I do not want to live to see 126. I will be quite content leaving my body at 86. Anyway, I have lost my faith in love and romance so I'm going to hang out by myself for a while. Because even though I feel disheartened that this XX thing was stupid and sad, certain things remind me that life goes on. For instance, on the bus ride home everyday, I feel like crying because the commute is so long and impersonal and the workday was hard and I feel really lonely among the corpo-drones, but at the same time, I will also feel that I also really need to do a #2. What is the meaning of my meaning? That whether you're happy or sad, life goes on. And life = finding a comfortable place to have a P.M. B.M. When I get home to my room full of distractions and my personal bathroom brimming with piles of glorious magazines, the sad feelings disappear. There are more immediate matters to attend to.  In contemplation of my new spinster life, what are the necessary components to being a successful spinster? I am thinking hella cats. Spinsters always have hella cats. Unfortunately this won't be feasible because my apartment building doesn't allow pets and my roommates are allergic to cat hair. I am thinking that the modern spinster has cool hair, cool clothes, and trampy underwear. And by "trampy" I mean limp cotton and baggy in the butt.  And hanging out with LingL makes me want to become a lesbian. The only thing preventing me from becoming a lesbian is that I won't eat pussy! I really don't want to because it requires so much effort. I just like to take it easy... Lay back... Relax... And when boyfriends'd come at me with pussybreath, I'd shriek at the foul fumes. I am thinking that perhaps eating pussy is like eating durian. The rank, uric odors will discourage the squeamish and conservative and heterosexual, but once you get a taste of the sweet fruit, you are in heaven though your breath is not. Maybe I just need a really hot girlfriend. If she was really hot, it wouldn't matter because when you're hot, your pussy tastes like ripe California peaches. This is true. I read it in a magazine.

       Countdown.   I would like more time, longer than 33 days. Because things are going so fucking amazingly well and I'm realizing these days just how much I'm going to miss M. He has taken to bringing me flowers and picking up takeout on the way over and making my bed. And he looks really fucking good in the green shirt he wore yesterday. And I made a whole list of places I want to go to that no one other than him would be interested in going to. Art galleries and picnic spots and bike rides that my ex-boys would have laughed at, but set M frantically planning. We're trying to squeeze in as much as we can in these last few weeks. (Oh, and speaking of sqeezing, we also have matching zits! They're on the very top of the bridge of our noses, in the same exact place (slightly to the right). Wierd.)

       Cute Band Alert  I spend all my money on CDs and shows. I blindly take risks on music, enduring hours of mediocre CDs and horrible opening bands, hoping for that awesome feeling of secret discovery. These are the bands I felt that way about last year:  The Sleepy Jackson BRMC Hem The Stills Mando Diao Tegan and Sara Wrens The Sounds Nellie McKaye The Kills Hot Hot Heat The Shins  Yesterday I went to Tower Records and plopped down $10 on a CD from their emerging artists section. I have that feeling again. I almost want to keep it to myself. They're wonderful and poppy with traces of the Beatles. (Two songs specifically: the chimey guitar in "Julia" is evoked in one song, and the brassy guitar tone in the intro riff of "Something" is used in another. They're also like The Beatles because they're strong singers.) But they're edgier than the Beatles. They're more atmospheric and less annoying. They remind me of the Britpop I listened to in high school mixed with that very-now, swaggery NYC sound. Ah sweet soaring melodies, ah enchanting pop hooks! I'm in heaven or love or both. I almost want to keep it a secret because I don't want to share... But here goes. They are...

       Mother's Day  On Mother's Day I joined my mom to visit my dad in the nursing home. I hadn't visited him for months since my mom and him--fairly recently--are embroiled in a legal battle. This has made her bitter and resentful so her visits have become terse and infrequent. Since she's my only ride to this boony off-road home and since she likes to make me happy, she relented to a visit.   We came into his room and I was alarmed at how emaciated he'd become: he was bony and skeletal and I could practically encircle his leg or arm with my hand. His face, to my relief, looked the same though he doesn't wear his bottom dentures anymore, making him look like a gummy old man. He was alert and talkative, and my mom took this opportunity to tell him how much grief he was causing her, but he'd only reply with confused unrelated statements like, "Did you turn off the radio?" and stubborn butthead-y comments like, "Fine, then, DON'T visit me anymore!"* While she was talking heatedly he closed his eyes and started snoozing. She continued chastisizing him but he was obviously asleep. I looked at her like, "This is absurd" and we looked at each other and realized how ridiculous it all was and laughed because it was all we could do. I said, "Well, we better go."  *(My dad doesn't talk like a teenage girl; I do, and unfortunately I'm the translator here.)  We drove down to Redwoodcity to visit my ailing gramma and aunt and we sat down to a meal of "goi cuon" with my cousins. This is where you wet a round sheet of rice paper, fill it with pork, shrimp, cilantro, mint, chive, lettuce and rice noodles, roll it up, and dip it in hoisin sauce and eat it. The key is to not overload your rice paper thus turning it into gigantic "burrito roll" or the defeated "soft taco." Your aim is to roll one that is uniform in size and shape, perfectly cylindrical like a sizable egg roll.   I started with a poor open-ended one resembling a big lettuce bouquet and my bro's GF made little lumpy ones tapered at the ends that resembled jumbo doobies. By my fourth and final roll, I'd mastered it, but I was already full. For dessert we picked at a cheesecake from Cala Foods then we went home.

       ID Badges  This year everyone in my company will be required to wear ID name badges. I had to go upstairs to HR to get my picture taken. I am thinking if I'm going to wear a photo ID name badge, I should also look REALLY important by wearing a lab coat to match it. Either that, or scrubs.

       What I Did This Weekend  This weekend my little cousin Kiwi flew up from Orange County and stayed with us. Entertaining guests always makes me a bit more active because I want to ensure they have a good time in SF. On Friday night we had drinks at the Hukilau with Green Marble's crew and on Saturday, we ate sushi at No-name, went to Japantown, caught the  urlLink Triplets of Belleville  at the Red Vic, then went to a party at my cousin's house.    My cousins were hosting a Mexican-themed party at their triplex/compound. (I'm really into that Mexican dish where it's meat and corn on the bottom and a layer of cornbread is baked on top? What's that called? Cuz I really like it.) My cousin, Duck-duck, likes to cook and her food is always delicious because the ingredients are fresh and she provides a smorgasboard of variety each time: there was that cornbread dish, enchiladas, carnitas, grilled chicken cubes, and all the fixins  plus  artichoke dip. For dessert she made rhubarb crisp and baked a mocha cake in honor of Abby's bday. She put candles on it and we processed into the living room singing "Happy Birthday" and it was funny because Abby was singing and looking around to see whose birthday it was. When she realized we were singing to her, she was really embarrassed. Hee-hee! Abby and I went home around midnight and fell asleep watching SNL.   On Sunday we went to see  urlLink 13 Going on 30 , which is actually pretty good for what it is. Afterwards we split up to spend Mothers' Day with our mommies. More on my mother's day later. Next show we're going to, as Abby is back in the fold:  urlLink The Distillers  this Thursday night.

        Mr.Airplane Man and The Husbands @ BOTH,  Pretty Girls Make Graves @ Cafe du Nord 05-06-04   Show Ho  I'm a show ho. But like I say, I'm a ho in that I go to a lot of shows, but then  not  a ho, because I'm discriminate. I maintain standards. Yesterday I achieved a new show ho low (or high) in that I went to two shows in one night. I started off at Bottom of the Hill to see The Husbands and Mr. Airplane Man.  urlLink The Husbands  include Sadie (formerly of The Vanishing) on guitar and another girl who sings and has a missing tooth. Not the eyeteeth,  the Jewel snaggletooth one. And there's one more girl who sings back-up and shakes the maracas. There were two dudes they were playing with too, but they don't count.* They were garage-y, rockabilly and fun. The ladies wore long vintage evening gowns and wouldn't look out of place in a John Waters movie. I think the missing tooth adds trashy mystique. I love local bands!    urlLink Mr.Airplane Man  were so tight and a testament to the power of rockin ladies. Some ladies I'll clap for politely, out of respect for the attempt itself and to encourage them to keep practicing--kind of a "you can do it" applause. But M.A.M. had me hootin and hollerin and clapping in like a "You fuckin GO, fuckin ladeez! Fuck yeah!!" I have never seen such precision in a guitarist, such natural talent. She played bluesy riffs like they were nothing, like it was no big deal. The drummer is a smaller woman whose drumming reveals Meg White as an incompetent fraud. I know that everyone has a crush on Meg White, and so do I, but after seeing this lady, let's all face it: MW is cherubic and cute and all, but her drumming fucking sucks. I've always defended Meg because she's a girl, and it's an advancement to have a lady play drums in such a high-profile band, but it would be even better if she blew everyone away. Meg blows people away because she's appealing and sexy, but can't she be sexy AND able?    M.A.M. are a garage-blues duo like The White Stripes. When I first read about them in Venus magazine, I though, "Oh great, another White Stripes knock-off band." Like The Kills, like The Black Keys. But come to think about it, I f'in LOVE The Kills and I LOVE The Black Keys. Jack White started an idea and all these great bands sprung from his model. Thank you Jack White for M.A.M. The only complaint I have about MAM is the singing. The blues melodies are there, but her voice is small and airy and girlish. She can't howl. Jack White can sing so sweetly then howl like a hungry man, but MAM can only sing sweetly. It's like, Black Keys kind of dirty delta blues, but with the vocals of a 3rd grade girl. There's no urgency or primal sex to her singing. But MAM makes up for the vocal inadequacies by respect-inducing, awe-inspiring playing. Who knows, this may very well translate to CD. MAM, I predict, will be on the lineup for next year's Coachella. And if they're not, then rocknroll is dead.   I didn't stay for the headliner, some band whose claim to fame is that the drummer from Metallica likes them. Anything with a Metallica stamp of approval makes me run for the hills. The hills being Cafe du Nord where  urlLink Pretty Girls Make Graves  were headlining. I missed their early show at Coachella last Sunday because of the sweltering heat and the 2-hour wait to take a shower. I met up with LingL and her pussy posse and we squeezed up front. PGMG were great, and I have a crush on them as a whole. A band crush. They're a really attractive band. I love Andrea's smile.      *[It bugs me when a band has extra uncredited players. I'll see a pic of The Husbands and think they're an all-girl trio, but then live, there are two dudes in the band too. Or the two back-up dancer/horn players in No Doubt. They're on every tour and add energy to the show, but why don't they get recognized as part of the band? Is it because they're black? Or Pat Smear, who toured with Nirvana in the end, adding another layer of guitar. Why wasn't he a member of Nirvana?]

       Sacramento  Yesterday I overheard one of the project managers talking to a group of people about how he needed documents delivered to Sacramento by noon on Friday but didn't want to use a messenger services. "I'll do it!" I screamed from across the room. After several phone calls between me, my boss, and the production department, it was settled - I would break the routine of my boring office life and visit our state capital.  Cool things  about being here - my car, Lucille, is parked FOR FREE downstairs (downtown SF garages rape you out of three bucks for every fifteen minutes), I have my own office with a view of said car, I can leave at 3 to go to Best Buy and get my iPod.  Lame things  about being here - it's effing hot!, there's lots more driving in store for me, and I'm missing the Free Food Friday at my sf office. Still, anything to change things around a bit..  Since M is busy all weekend and Bart D will take away dear Batty, I'm going to Chico tonight for a comedy show and some culture, of course.

       Carb-mania 		  I am reluctant to say that I've submitted to the carb-hysteria. It's a scare actually. People are scaring me with their hollowed cheeks and crazed stares and incessant mindless chatter about carb-counting. Yesterday I bought a bag of Atkins-brand bagels because the zombies are getting to me. I made a bagel sandwich this morning and it was like eating air. It was a fucking SANDWICH at 7am and now it's 10 and I'm fuckin looking wildly around for something else to eat. (Chris Farley whine:) I'm STARVING! Diets/Food restriction suck(s) because you're hungry all the time! That's why fat people are interesting to talk to--their stomachs are full and thus energy circulates in their craniums instead of wallowing in their deprived empty stomachs. (Caveman grunt:) Thinking, GOOD; Starving, BAD.  What do carbs taste like? How does their absence affect my eating pleasure? For instance low-sodium=bland, lowfat=dry, and "diet"=weird chemically-sweet aspartame/ nutrasweet taste and aftertaste. For now, my assessment is that carbs=substance and so, cutting carbs is like wasteful eating. There's no point since you're still going to be hungry!!! And hungry=angry!!!

       Rhubarb  Yesterday I bought some rhubarb and I held up the line at Cala cuz the incompetent cracked-out cashier didn't know the code, didn't know how to spell rhubarb to look it up, and didn't even know what kind of food it was. I was like, "It's next to kale and collared greens." And the line got longer and longer and people were silently cursing my pink produce. Then after paging 2 people who didn't know either, he goes, "I guess I just punch in celery, cuz it look like celery." Then he spazzes out a little then goes, "No, I just ring you up for kale then. No one will know. Just don't tell anybody!"

      Coac hell a  a joint entry    Batty:  On Friday afternoon, we picked up R-guy and W-gal and headed to the desert in Indio Valley for  urlLink Coachella . Let me get to the point. Two things: Great music, intense blazing heat. In order to see every single band you love in the same place, you will suffer weekend damnation for it. We camped at the adjacent site, and it was torturous. 2-hour lines for the mobile showers and no place to brush your teeth/wash your hands. The desert sun would rise at 6:30am, turning our tent into a hellish sauna. The temperature reached 110 degrees, transforming my deodorant into the consistency of goopy soft ice cream. The heat will get to you. It will change everything. The things you brought with you will alter states and your body will turn into a sweat machine; you will contemplate whether you need to buy shorts though you haven't worn shorts since high school gym class. It will make you buy a $4 lemonade. Twice. We used protection--hot drippy sunscreen--but our mortal defenses could not save us from sunburn and the ugly and awkward "farmer's tan". Holes in the ozone layer aren't created by the greenhouse effect or aerosol cans, they're made when an ungodly number of amazing bands concentrate in one area. There was a big hole over Indio Valley that weekend and the scorching sun punished us for being so cool.    Abby:  We were only gone for 4 days but we came back changed people. Not only physically (unsexy 1st degree burns), but also mentally and emotionally. There were many times throughout the weekend when I looked at us and thought "We are smart, educated, middle class women - how did it come to this?" I'm referring to our time spent looking for shade like two impoverished hags. First we stealthily crawled over to the side of our camp neighbor's giant tent and lay motionless in the shade. Batty pointed out that it (shade) was getting smaller by the minute as the sun made its way directly overhead. When we were down to an inch, we realized we had to migrate. Lucky for us, there were some palm trees in the adjacent lot so we trudged over. Soon other coachellites, goth, punk and pop alike, joined in. Oh how delightful it was laying around in 95 rather than 110 degree heat, but it did not last long. Soon a gestapo man came out of nowhere and ordered us to immediately vacate his premises. We then walked around looking for the next refuge, which we found near another tent. Doing this for 3 hours and then waiting another 2 in the shower line left us exhausted, but we were determined to make the best of it. So we let the security ladies feel us up and entered the premises of the festival.   Batty:  Here are all the bands we saw and loved while we sweated like hounds in heat: The Sounds, Sahara Hotnights, The Stills, Black Keys, THE PIXIES!, Junior Senior, Desert Sessions w/ Josh Homme and Brody Dalle, Death Cab for Cutie, The Rapture, Radiohead, Mindless Self-Indulgence, Moving Units, Kraftwerk, and Phantom Planet. And that's just Saturday. On Sunday we mainly stayed cool in the removed tents and listened to and peered at Muse, Broken Social Scene, and !!! We watched Belle and Sebastian as the sun set and later caught bits of Dizzee Rascal and Air. We randomly spotted R-guy and W-gal leaving the Bright Eyes show and joined them for a beer in the beer garden. And at night in the cold we watched The Flaming Lips, Le Tigre, and The Cure. We talked about how awkward Robert Smith is and always will be and made up scenarios to put him in: Robert Smith at In N' Out carrying a tray with his hamburger, Robert Smith pumping gas, Robert Smith melting in the unbearable Coachella heat. We talked about our favorite show "The OC" and Abby wondered when they were going to do "a special Coachella episode." Little did we know that we weren't watching it, we were LIVING it...    Abby:  Because, just as we were walking over to Bright Eyes and talking about our best friends from The OC, who did we spot near the Outdoor Theater but  urlLink Seth and Summer !!! I pointed them out to Batty, who immediately knew what to do. "There's only one thing to do - watch  them  watch Bright Eyes". Brilliant! So we did. We giggled like twelve-year-olds behind our sunglasses and hats as we watched Seth and Summer try to blend in with the rest of the crowd. I reminded Batty of our age, but it was too late, we were on celebrity high. Because it wasn't just anyone, it was freakin SETH and SUMMER of THE OC! Snuggling! Anyway, that gave us the energy to make it through the rest of the shows. Well, that's about it. I think we covered it pretty well. On Monday we drove back, stopping at In 'N Out and Anderson's Pea Soup Compound. ...Any additions Batty?    Batty:  When Abby pointed out our friends, I whispered urgently,"We HAVE to stand behind them!" and scurried over and stood right behind  urlLink Adam Brody . She followed and stood behind  urlLink Rachel Bilson . Some people, y'know,  talk  to famous stars, and some people, y'know, stand behind them. They look exactly like they do on TV--clear skin, cute, young. We stood behind them watching them watch Bright Eyes and Abby turned to me and faux-whimpered in horror,"We're 26!" We giggled at the absurdity of us, but that's the way it goes in Hollywood: 26 year-olds playing 15 in the special Coachella episode of "The OC."  To add to the legion of mediocre celebrity gossip, I watched one woman approach them and mumble, "Are you on The OC?" Rachel/Summer said, "I'm sorry?" and the lady repeated her question. Summer was uncomfortable and embarrassed and didn't know what to say. She looked at Seth/Adam and he laughed if off and (referring to Summer) said, "I'm not, but SHE is."  So all in all, it was hotter than hell, my deodorant melted, we spent too much money on overpriced dinky food, saw some fantastic performances, got sunburned, hung out with R-guy and W-gal, stalked Summer and Seth, and never felt so icky and sticky in all our young lives. But besides the celebrity stalkage, we did see something once-in-a-lifetime: Wayne Coyne got inside a friggin gigantic plastic bubble and walked/rolled into the audience during The Flaming Lips show. Now, that's not something I see everyday. My administrative supervisor does not provide me with that sort of ingenious entertainment. So, to recap my recap: sun, bands, friends, and a man travelling in a bubble. That was the Coachella experience for two bad Apples.

       urlLink    This is tick hanging out on my head on Friday two weeks ago. Batty said it looks like a clitoris, which I agree with, but thought I'd post anyway, in case you thought I was kidding. Also, because I like how shiny and fabulously fake my hair looks.&nbsp; urlLink

       Abby's Assholeness  The last couple of weeks I've felt myself slipping into extreme bitch mode. I'm not one to blame PMS, so I've determined that it must be due to very specific reasons, which are: 1)me being tired all the time 2)M's ability to create drama though he's not even here 3) mom's reminders of what a good gramma she would be if given the chance 4) not being able to see the people I love (G, Roomies, Fellow Show Hoes, Camp Peeps) enough to balance out having to see the people I don't like (people at work, everyone else)& 5)hating my job at least 5 hours a day.   New things are starting to piss me off that I've been able to ignore in the past - my cube neighbor's loud crow-like cackles, the constant interuptions made by the dumb girl in french class, the smell of the man on the bus, waiting for the elevator at my building. I know that life is cyclical and I can't always be jumping for joy, but I kinda want to snap out of it. On the bright side, my bitchiness has made me more assertive and direct. When I ask for things at work, I do so unapologetically, sans lame jokes. And I finally mastered the art of not smiling when I feel uncomfortable. I still feel uncomfortable (around strangers & classmates), but now I just stare at them blankly..which is definitely better.

       Batty's Slow Trek Towards Optimal Health   Ever since my upsetting BMI diagnosis, I've made several changes in my life.    1. I'm eating more fruits and vegetables.  Trader Joe's has made this transition a helluva lot easier by supplying interesting salads, 4-packs of white nectarines, and snack packs of celery sticks that come with a small pot of peanut butter. A warning though: don't get their curried chicken salad because the curry has RAISINS in it. BLEAh!!! Though TJ's makes vegetables fun, it's still a chore to eat them because I'd rather feed veggies to rabbits or horses. Or I'd rather dangle them from a stick to propel my pack mule.   2. I'm drinking more water.  This sucks sucks sucks. Drinking a lot when it's cold outside is really hard. It doesn't cool or rehydrate me because there is no sun interplay. In hot weather I chuzzle water like a maniac but when it's freezing outside in the cold cold summer, I'd rather be drinking other things, like spiked cocoa.   3. I walk during my lunchtime.  I don my pink Roos and trek to IKEA and back. Though this isn't a rigorous exercise, I think it's better than no exercise at all, which I actually prefer. XX says the secret to exercise is finding an activity that you like. You know what activities I like? Eating, sleeping, and sitting on my ass. I also like to take baths and read magazines. I also really like to play Taboo.   4. Smaller portions.  I eat less now. Before I'd eat a lot because I really enjoy the taste of food and the act of eating itself. I like to taste and chew and savor and swallow. I like the alchemy of cooking, the appetizing incarnations of food, and the aromas and textures involved. Eating is a pleasurable experience for me. But now, I've kind of lost my joie de eating because the repercussions of it hang on me like an albatross. An albatross around my mid-section.

       Fahrenheit 9-11  Yesterday I saw Fahrenheit 9-11 and stood in line to see the movie. I was lucky to get my ticket in advance because all the shows eventually sold out. I've never wept openly at a documentary but I cried throughout the movie and I still feel residual sadness now. The movie was really powerful and I'm even more conscious of how fucking lucky I am to cruise along happily in my show-going bubble. I have my criticisms about the movie too, but really, as the daughter of two war refugees, I realize that I'm very lucky that I don't have bombs or guns or soldiers or death in my day-to-day life. My parents came here so I could see war from an air-conditioned cineplex. And what I saw was horrible. I cannot imagine what it must really be like.   The most relevant question the movie tries to answer is, "What are we fighting for?" What is the purpose of this war?  Go see this movie. It's important. Even if you dislike Michael Moore, maintain your critical sensibilities and see this film.

       A Bad Apple in The Big Apple  This weekend I went to NYC for some fun. I'm really really glad I went. Here's what I did:  Went shopping down  Canal St.  which was mad. Store after store overflowing with bright knock-off purses. Congested sidewalks with pushy hurried women scrambling for cheap goods. Green Marble and I both commented on how much boobie action one gets walking down Canal. I counted at least 3 soft boobs that were pressed into me. There are street vendors packing the sidewalks with fanciful scarves and imitation Tiffany jewelry and grommetted belts. I bought a white belt there for $3! There are rows of Chinese women, purses hung from wrist to shoulder, shouting "PUHSS! PUHSS!" as you walk by. We pushed through the crowd and made our way to Chinatown and Little Italy.   Chinese bakery . XX once said that the Chinese food you get in NYC is different than the stuff that's available in SF. I was like, "Oh yeah, honky? Like what?" And he said, "They make these green onion pancakes there" and to this I laughed long and hard because he's such a food fool. But at the bakery there, they had tuna buns! I've been to a lot of bakeries and never in my 26 years have I seen Tuna Bun! It's exactly like a baked pork bun, but with soft tuna inside!   We went to  Dean & Deluca  the famed delicatessen and tried their cheese samples and bread samples. We bought cheddar and spinach muffins that were so delicious and dense, it was like a meal in a muffin.   We also went to H&M and some  local tourist shops . GM bought a pink T-shirt with a mexican-style drawing on it of Mary which read, "Mary is my homegirl." I bought XX the Jesus one that said, "Jesus is my homeboy."   I had a  hotdog  there for $1.25 and NYC hot dogs are the bomb-diggity-dog because not only for a dollar and a quarter do you get ketchup and mustard, you also get free sauerkraut, and a delectable drippy orange onion sauce they plop on top.  We walked through a  streetfair  that smelled so good. Everyone was selling whole roasted corn on the cob, grilled chicken kebabs, and this round sandwich everyone was eating (I forget the name) that's like two layers of crepes filled with melted mozzarella.  On Saturday night, we went to a Tapas restaurant,  El Cid , which was a pleasant experience. We (Green Marble, her friend we were staying with, Sara, and myself) sat at the bar and shared a pitcher of white wine sangria. We ordered 4 tapa plates: sweetmeats, a baked quiche-like egg omelette, sausage in wine sauce, and tiny croquettes. At meal's end our waiter gave us each a small glass of Muscat! Their muscat was so smooth, and sweet, and clean, not at all like the $5 Sutter Home muscat I usually buy.  Afterwards we went to a bar/club " The Park " which was a bar with an outdoor restaurant and an upstairs open-air club that included a hot tub. I felt frumpy because I didn't bring any "club-type clothes" but I had fun anyway with Sara and her crew. The men at that NYC club dressed really sharply in fitted ironed shirts with queer-eye type pastel stripes. They wore flattering jeans that were hemmed to hit just right over their Italian shoes. The girls all wore cute fitted halter tops or tank tops with tight bootleg jeans and strappy high heels or a top with a short ruffly tiered mini. I marvelled at how cute everyone looked but I knew this type of fashion-forwardedness would be impossible in SF because it's too cold to take off our coats!  On Sunday we brunched at  The Popover Cafe  and each had a popover which is like a brioche but big, airy, and crisp. They were served with strawberry butter which, when melted, tasted like Yoplait yogurt--creamy and not too sweet. Everyone else had eggs, but I got a chef salad because here is one of the tenets of my new diet: eat more salads. Who the hell savors lettuce? I salivate over chorizo and roasted pork and fried chicken, not lettuce and arugula. When you eat salads, you eat it because it's good for you, not cuz it tastes good. So when you're full, you stop eating because it's not particularly tasty and the smell doesn't intoxicate you into wanting more. Salads have no smell actually. No one ever come homes and exclaims, "MMMM... that salad smells so good!"  After brunch we split up. Sara and GM went to see the Yankees vs The Mets game, and I headed downtown to check out some   architecture . I walked from 59th down to 23rd and admired The Lipstick Building, The Chrysler Building, The Empire State, and the Flatiron Building. Along 5th Ave too, was the  NYC pride parade  so every once in a while I'd watch that and cheer people on. It was really crowded and everyone was in high spirits. I made my way along Stonewall, the historic street where the Stonewall riots occurred in 1969 and clapped for the senior citizens in the parade who were seated and waving their canes. Walking around NYC by myself along the parade route, with the sun warming my shoulders with all my amenities on my back, I felt really content and happy. For the first time ever I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I think, finally, I can forgive my parents for selfishly bringing me into this wretched world because sometimes, it's not so bad, and sometimes, it's kind of beautiful.

       Friday Wrap-Up  It's been pretty boring around here, so to pass time I've been torturing myself all day. First I had a strawberry yogurt in the morning, which gave me the worst stomach pains, being that my body refuses to digest dairy products. I don't even  like   yogurt, I have no idea why I did this. Now I'm drinking a coke, a carbonated beverage, another stomach no-no. My favorite thing to do at the office (besides talking to people on the phone) is taking tiny sips of cola, opening my mouth and listening to the bubbles crackle. I was doing that and reading today's Daily Dish about Britney getting engaged when one of the project managers decided to stop by to discuss upcoming projects. During the entire ten minutes that we talked, a banner reading "Britney Gets Engaged" was on the monitor next to my face. The fact that I even HAVE a job is remarkable.   In other news, M is lonely and depressed and calls almost daily to tell me this. On one hand, it upsets me that he's sad and makes me wish that I can do something to comfort him, but on the other hand, the fact that he's not having fun makes me feel better. He said he might come back for a weekend next month. The girlfriend me would have offered to split his ticket since he paid for mine from Chicago, but the friend won't. Instead I described to him of all the food I've been eating and places I've been going. So you see, I'm a masochist and and sadist at the same time. Have a great weekend the two of you.

       Friday Fashion News  In today's fashion news,  urlLink twobadapples.blogspot.com  has forged ahead with a sleek new look. Spurred by a hot tip from blog mentor, W-gal, the fledgling blog scrambled for a makeover just in time for a weekend debut. The cool summer interface leaves 1 reader upset and 1 reader befuddled.* Says co-founder Batty Apple, "When I fucked with getting a new template I didn't have our readership in mind. This is a completely narcissistic direction." Abby Apple could not be reached for comment.   *Actual readers could not be reached for comment either as the comments section has been unintentionally eliminated.

       Thursday Mumble  While on the phone with M yesterday, I officially changed my stupid friendster profile to 'single', which in this day and age is the most official record of one's life. Sure, I was in love with the bastard, but like my wise brother said last night "Love should trump logic" and if M wants to be  logical   about us living in different parts of the country, then it must no longer be love. And I'm okay with that. If he was still staying with me, every night he would be in the living room drinking my beer and playing on his laptop (probably looking at porn) and frankly, I don't need that. On a random note, I'm hanging out with his ex-girlfriend in a few weeks. Not the friend from high school but the other one whom I met at his Good-Bye dinner. He said that if we have any desire to make-out and get naked, we should take pictures and send them to him. I told him that, instead, we'll probably talk a lot of shit and send him the transcript. I'm so glad we're still friends.  This weekend Batty & Green Marble are in New York, which means I have the house aaall to myself. My sweet little gramma wants to come over, which means I'll have to clean my room. Also mom expressed interest in seeing Farenheit 911, which shocks me because she has only seen one other movie in a theater since we moved here 16 years ago and that was "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". Rami and I are hanging out Saturday and TJ Maxx is having a BBQ on Sunday. Then there's there's a possible hike with Aaron and Izzy, which I'm still debating over as the bump on my head a.k.a. 'Rick's former home' has gotten bigger in the last few days and I'm afraid Rick might have left a little brother in my head.

       Ooh La La!  I might write about my french class a lot in the next four weeks because it's so goddamn time consuming. This week, the prof decided to meet three times instead of the usual two. That's (3 days x 4 hours) + (2 hours of commute/day x 3 days)+ (1 hour of homeword/class x 3 classes) = .... 21 hours!! Good lord, that's more than half of my working hours! I now have a running french commentary in my head as I walk around downtown. I look at someone and mentally tell them that I would like to substitute a salad for the couscous that comes with my braised rabit. Or that they need not bother with the medicine, I'll just stay in bed and drink lots of fluids.  The people in the class are pretty great. There's a mail order russian bride named Anastasia whose husband is american. She's very nice but insists on speaking russian to me even though I make a poing to answer back exclusively in english (or broken french). The's also another girl named Lynn who is a close talker but is bubbly and fun. There are several other characters, but I'll have to describe them some other time. Tomorrow we're going out to get drinks after class. Yay summer! Yay H&M! Yay to moving to Paris with Batty next summer!

      Yesterday I went to see  urlLink Coffee and Cigarettes  by myself. My friend DJ G didn't show up so I went without her. I'm piqued by auteurism and my movie-going is dictated more by directors than by actors/stars. I like all of Jim Jarmusch's previous work like Ghost Dog, Down By Law, and Night on Earth. He's not for everyone though. Coffee and Cigarettes was shot in black & white film and at times its pace was plodding. But I like that kind of stuff. I don't care about plot or action in a movie. Like Harmony Korine once said, "Fuck plot."  Batty's Top 5 Auteurs: Woody Allen David Gordon Green Jim Jarmusch Wong Kar Wai Spike Lee

       Special Supplement to Friday Fashion News 		    Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.  urlLink H&M  is opening a  urlLink flagship store in San Francisco  next year. To those who don't know the thrilling glory of H&M, imagine Old Navy's prices, but better-looking clothes. The clothes are cut better and involve more details. Nothing is frumpy and everything is cute and smart. It's like Forever 21's older sibling who's dispensed the ho-clothes and gone  with better sizes and sturdier material but stays true to how fun fashion can be. Last year when Green Marble and I went to Europe we went to an H&M in all three cities we visited. And there was different stock in each one! I eagerly anticipate its long-awaited arrival. There were rumors of an SF H&M in 2001, but now it's finally true!  In other H&M news, Karl Lagerfeld will be  urlLink designing  a line for the retailer that will debut this November. I'm skeptical of big names designing for cheap brands because the Isaac Mizrahi line featured at Target is abominable. The inaugural season was filled with ugly oversized sweaters that were hideously clownish in their sherbet-like palette and the second current season filled with "classic" pieces is just plain boring. Now I admit I ordered a pair of his red pointy flats last year, but that was the only item I liked. I really tried to like his stuff but just couldn't. And how is it that the only thing I like of his I had to find online?   Thanks to field reporters Abby and Green Marble.

       Tuesday News  This morning the first news I got was from Abby:  urlLink Lollapalooza cancelled . I am totally bummed by this. It was a dream line-up: Modest Mouse, Le Tigre, Sonic Youth, BRMC, Morrissey, PJ Harvey, The Von Bondies. Together in one day. In a non-desert setting. What a loss. I'm easily consoled though because in the summertime, shows compete with another love of mine: BBQs. I will exchange my Lollapalooza sorrows for a grill of fragrant meats and kebabs in my cousin's backyard. So far this BBQ season, I have been to four. The last being W-gal's bday bbq that was celebrated with my consumption of a turkey cheeseburger. Birthday turkeyburger always trumps birthday cake in my book.   I'm sneaking peeks at a Time magazine article on bloggers and here are the sites they deemed notable:   urlLink fark.com   urlLink boing boing   urlLink instapundit.com   urlLink wonkette!   urlLink rebecca's pocket   In personal news, I went into Kaiser last week to get an HIV test and some other STD test and the nursedude stuck a needle in me and it was very painful then after a while I hear him say, "Sorry we'll have to do this again. Give me your other arm?" And I was already like almost crying so I go, "What happened?" and he said, "You have a rolling vein. It moves." He carefully pushed the needle into my other arm and I decided I could never be a heroin addict or even get a tattoo because it fucking hurts! I'm too much of a weenie. Then I thought if he doesn't get the vein this time, I am just going to have to live assuming I have a disease because I can't go through with it again. Then he goes, "It's working" and extracted two vials of my blood.

       I Love My Family  Yesterday my cousins cooked all day to make dinner which I was invited to. Here's what they made:  *Oysters-- they stuffed spinach, prosciutto, and breadcrumbs into the shells and baked them! *Polenta--they grilled polenta rounds and served it with a creamy cheese sauce that was nice and stinky. Gruyere? Gorgonzola? *Grilled Asparagus *Pasta--they made a gigantic vat of fettucine and served it with soft plump pieces of chicken, a chunky tomato sauce, and shredded fresh basil. There was more ingredients, but the lighting was dim so I couldn't really see. *Garlic bread *Dessert--Homemade lemon cheesecake cupcakes. My little cousin K-chef just graduated from Brown and we're all urging her to take the plunge and go to culinary school. Her presentation yesterday night was full of whimsy: she arranged polenta rounds into the shape of a flower and for the cakes she topped each with a single cherry and arranged them around a clear bowl of nilla wafers.   They also served my current white wine obsession: Muscat! Other  urlLink dessert wines  I want to try: Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Sauternes.  (I brought XX along and he did a minimum of complaining/whining. He even helped shuck the oysters. He says he wants to move down to L.A. eventually and this makes me sad sometimes. But other times I feel completely indifferent and think,"Good riddance, you stupid clown." It's because sometimes the man is impossible. But mostly he's nice. I'm divided. The ratio is 63% nice, 37% impossible.)

       Meet Rick a.k.a. Dermacentor Occidentalis      The story of my weekend is that last night I pulled out a big fat brown tick from my head that must have been there since Yellowstone (a week and a half ago). The background of the story is that I've felt something in the back of my head for about a week but thought it was a zit or a piece of gum and had been tugging on it ever since. Yesterday, after taking a digital picture of my head and examining it on my laptop, it still looked undefinable. So I twisted and tugged and pulled until I finally got it out. Upon placing it on my table to examine it, I discovered that it had 8 legs and was moving around. My bro called and offered to take me to Kaiser. But first we went to the bar for J-dogg's birthday. I carried Rick The Tick in a tupperware and introduced it to my friends until it was time to head to the hospital. The doctor at Kaiser was a very nice lady but kept saying things like "Yuck", "Gross", and "I'm sorry I'm not paying attention, I'm just so grossed out right now" which kinda put me off. Then the nurse filled out my chart..."Description: tick bite. Has the tick." Other nurses and doctors came to look at the little guy since, according to one, noone's ever brought a live whole tick in before. They told me I was very lucky to get the whole thing out - usually the head remains under the skin and has to be removed in less pleasant ways. It turns out it was much smaller when it lached on, but my stellar care had allowed it to grow about 5 times its original size. The doc thanked me for donating my tupperware and G & I went back out to the bars.  They're going to run tests on the little guy to see if he carries lyme disease and if he is, then I am too. The chances are small so I'm not really worried. My head is still sore from nursing a bug for so long, but I eat less now that I'm only eating for one.

        urlLink BMI   Yesterday I went to the doctor and she suggested I lose some weight. She sent me home with a BMI chart with my position circled. I'm in the grey area which equals "medium-risk for potential health problems." My pants have been getting snug, but I've blamed it on shrinking pants. I assume when one pair shrinks, they're all in on it, so they all shrink together. When I stood on the scale and the nurse kept tapping the square thingy further up til I weighed 17 lbs more than I normally weigh, I assumed it was my wallet and my shoes. When I was at my mother's house and she suggested we try her scale and it read the same weight, I immediately assumed I had a 17-lb ulcer or a massive goiter hidden somewhere (most likely my huge gut).   So anyway, I'm going to try to lose some weight, but not without resistance and plenty of whining. Yesterday I left my mom's house at 8:30 citing "tiredness" and she goes, "What? You're so young! Why are you tired?" and I said jokingly, "I'm FAT mom! Fat people get TIRED easily!"

      Today is extra boring. I'm looking for ways to entertain myself for if I combine immense boredom with immense tiredness, the result will be me falling asleep at my desk and I can't have that. It's not even noon and I have already taken my online class, signed up for fall classes, spoke with M (who got yelled at by a Wisconsin store clerk last night for trying to buy beer after 9 pm), spoke with mom about tomorrow's birthday plans, attended a meeting, and eaten my lunch. I have nothing left to do and 5 hours in which not to do it.   On the bright side, my French class is fabulous. Everyone in the class is a Europhile and the tiny little lady professor wears clothing that depicts the french flag. My speaking skills have improved tremendously and I can now say 'Rather than a suppository, I prefer a lozenge for my cough". The downsides of my 4-hour bi-weekly class is that my room looks like a tornado swept through it and I'm always tired the next day. Bleh.

        urlLink The Killers  In-Store   Tomorrow at 6pm at  urlLink The Virgin Megastore  downtown. I'm not going to this because I think The Killers stink. I actually saw them a while ago at a show I never posted for. They opened for Stellastarr*. Here's a nutshell post, because I feel guilty:  The Evening/The Killers/Stellastarr* @ GAMH 04-29-04   The Evening: local band. rilly good.   The Killers: they stink. they have a great song on the radio now, something about girlfriends and boyfriends. that song, stellar, the rest, stinky. i almost fell asleep even though i was up at the front. i had to leave to buy myself a coke. You will like The Killers if you like anything that sounds like The Strokes. I don't. I'm too old and ornery to be entertained by lifeless knockoffs.  Stellastarr*: good. great album. good show. singer: gorgeous. drummer: had a big asterisk taped over his nipple. something that irked me though (as I'm easily irked) is the girl-harmonies. she never sings any words, she just goes "ohhhhhhhh" or "uh-ohhhh" or "ahhhhh". R-guy joked that she must be foreign.

       Stand Up For Your Rights  In a high school English class long long ago, we were discussing the equality of men and women. The class clown -who wasn't that funny- piped up, "But girls can't pee standing up!" and I retorted hotly, "Yes we can, it just trickles down your leg." Now read  urlLink this .

       Office Talk   Me typing quietly at my desk. Dude comes up to me...  Dude: Hey, do you know where I can fax my personal papers? Me: HR. Dude: Really? Me: Yes.  Dude stands there blinking for a while.  Dude: I can just do it myself up there? Me: Yes. Dude: My  personal  papers? Me: (exasperated) Why would I lie???  In other office news, this other dude once asked me for "vanilla" file folders. Today he sent in a request for "creme" file folders. This is funny to me. If it's funny to you, then you are an admin.

       Beastie Boys Fever   urlLink     The Beastie Boys' new album,  urlLink To The 5 Boroughs  comes out today. To satiate your beastie appetites, here's a cool  urlLink article  where Mike D. talks about how much they like cheese. If you can fight off the Sandman, they're on David Letterman tonight.  Is it me, or does Mike D. kind of look decrepit in this picture?

       urlLink    I'm through with indie rock for the rest of June. I'm back into my aural-alterego of R&B, all the time. I'm really into  urlLink Teena Marie 's new album, La Dona, which has got some crazy-soulful songs that remind me of Destiny's Child and sweet-sounding Mary J. Blige. Teena's vibrato is wiggly and weird, but I really like it. She's been around for ages, since 1979, but this is the first I've heard of her. "La Dona" is her first release in ten years! Unfortunately for me, your show ho, she's only doing a 5-city tour which does not include the Bay Area. If she does an extensive tour, though, I am so there. Teena, my Vietnamese face is so so there.  Also, with the comeback of Teena, I think it's great that older artists are garnering some mainstream attention. This includes Loretta Lynn and her Jack White-produced album,  urlLink Van Lear Rose , and, and, okay I can't think of anyone else. But two is better than zero. Besides Madonna, career longevity in pop music is non-existent. So if I ever score a #1 hit, I am friggin saving my buckaroos! It's so sad to see  urlLink artists  make a $1,000,000  urlLink video , then promptly declare bankruptcy. If I had a million dollars, I'd say screw the video and buy a house in San Francisco. Or, half a house. Ok, scratch that. If I had TWO million dollars, I'd buy me a house in San Francisco.   In other R&B news, TJ Maxx told me to buy  urlLink Janet Jackson 's "Damita Jo" which I've already listened to twice through. It's okay so far, but it doesn't compare to "Janet." my all-time favorite JJ album. In return I forced him to buy "La Dona" which he thinks is off the chain.

       Batty's Less-Eventful Weekend   On Saturday I went to the company picnic with Mr.Hottie and his catty date. Cattiness always makes me laugh because I'm always pleasantly surprised when I meet someone who can out-mean me. Example:  Me: Hey, look at Hapa-Hottstuff. He's carrying a tiny Pomeranian. Who does he think he is, Paris Hilton? And look at his girlfriend, she looks like J-Lo!  Catty (turning to get a better look): J-Lo?! More like J-NO.  Me: (laughing hysterically.)  Catty: Or more like J- HO !  I shouldn't brag about my meanness, but it's really because I'm envious. I want blown-out pumped-up hair, big beige lips, and a closeted boyfriend.  The best part about the picnic was that I sat next to this girl I work with who's pretty, slender, stylish, and makes me feel kind of mannish in comparison. It was a sight to see her totally chow down and eat two plates of food. People eating a lot always forges an immediate bond with me. I was fascinated. She ate very fast and had a very methodical way of eating her second plate, a huge hot dog:  She plopped down next to me and started digging out the innards of the lower-half of the bun. Her movements were fast and squirrel-like. Mr.Hottie asked, "Hey, what are you doing over there? Low-carbing your hot dog?" "No," she said curtly and continued digging. I turned to him, "Duh, Mr.Hottie, she's creating a BOAT for her HOT DOG!" She ripped off the corner of a mustard packet and squeezed thin lines of its contents into the ditch. Same with the ketchup packet, same with the relish. She placed the hot dog into the trench and proclaimed "Open-faced hot dog!" and bit into it with great zeal. It was amazing.   Other things I did this weekend: didn't convince XX to take me to see BartD, as he's totally broke too. Ate the consolation smores he made me on Saturday night. Had pig-out-all-you-can-eat dim sum with my family Sunday morning because one of my cousins just won big in La$ Vega$. Requested encore smores from XX on Sunday night. Watched "Easy Rider" for the first time. Have crush now on young Peter Fonda.

       Highlights & Lowlights of M & A's Week of Wildin' Ridin'    Overall the trip was amazing. M was at his very best behavior which makes me forget all of his previous shenanigans. Here's the day-by-day play-by-play.  * Stayed in a $20 room our first night after driving 8 hours. It was called  Winners Casino & Hotel  in Winnemucca, NV.  * We got 2  speeding tickets  the following day (me in Nevada; him in Wyoming which he had to pay on the spot). Nevada is nothing to look at although there was a sign that said "Basecamp of the Mountaneering Community". I don't believe it.  * We grilled up steaks at  Yellowstone  after driving 14 hours on Tuesday. Went on a 5 mile hike the following morning to a waterfall. We walked through what looked like a huge Christmas tree lot. It turns out redwoods are a California thing. Still, it was all amazingly beautiful, complete with herds of bison and deer running around and about a million steaming geysers. Despite signs prohibiting this, we put our fingers in one of them and it was hot.  * We passed by truck stops with names like  Kum & Go  and billboards that said   "Abortion - the choice that kills"   and  "Abortion - Aren't you forgetting someone?  (picture of a baby) " . We laughed at these. We stopped laughing when we realized that Bush is going to win.   * I used my awesome new Canon camera to make one-minute movie clips of the towns and roads we passed through(they all ended up looking exactly the same). In each one I would eventually ask M "M, what are your thoughts on (Nevada/Idaho/Utah/Wyoming/Minnesota/South Dakota..)"..where he would do a little dance and smile at the camera. I end up crying like a retard when I watch these now.  * After Yellowstone, we had the best breakfast in the world in Cody, Wyoming at a diner called  "Our Place".. for $4/person!  * Later that day we were baffled while at  Mt.Rushmore , not at the architectural marvel that is the monument, but by how big and pink Americans are. Many looked like made-up piggies, with their baseball hats and sweats and pouffy hair and chinfat. Lots of  chinfat .   * That night we drove through Sioux Falls, SD where I fell in love with the town. We ate at an eastern european restaurant where the waiter looked just like my dad. M tried sourkraut for the first time and liked it. We stayed in Minnesota that night and watched Conan while curled up on a bed of a stinky hotel room.  * Next day we drove to Chicago and drank lot of beer.  * We saw teenage  Amish  couples at the  Chicago Museum of Science & Technology , with their white bonnets and long frumpy dresses and beards. M & I couldn't figure out why they would go to the museum of  Science & fucking Technology ! Think about it!  * Then we ran around the  Chicago Art Institute . M looked at photos while I checked out the  Paperweights  and  Quilts  exibits in addition to all the permanent stuff. I loved Modigliani paintings and spent a long time looking at these.   * We navigated our way around  Chicago , got lost in random neighborhoods, shopped at  H&M , went to a  Jazz club  where a big black woman sang just like Etta James and drank way too much wine. M fell asleep and I stayed up that night to watch the most spectacular  lightning & thunder show  ever witnessed from our 10th floor hotel room at  Hotel Wacker .  * M & I had our lovely last date on Saturday night at some famous Chicago  pizzaria . We split a medium deep dish without realizing how enormous it was. The couples at the next table told us they got another pitcher of beer just so they can watch us eat. We took pictures.  * I had a slight breakdown in front of all the nice folks at the  Chicago airport  at 5:30 on Sunday morning after kissing M goodbye. I called my brother just to say hi half hour later because I still felt shitty. I apologized profusely after realizing that due to the 2 hour time difference, it was 4 in the morning in SF (not like it's okay to call at 6 am on a Sunday either). He took me to see the Bukowski documentary when I got back. I love my brother. Too bad he's leaving in a month.  Shit. I have to do this from home because I'm starting to tear up and Karl just walked by and said 'Don't cry' kinda loud and now everyone around me knows I'm a wailing idiot. And I was doing so good this morning. Crap.

       Friday Fashion News: A Salute to the Olsen Twins      The Olson Twins are sublime. I don't know it they can act or not, but they sure know how to put outfits together. Sure they're millionaires, but even when you're rich, this doesn't automatically mean good choices in  urlLink hair , or  urlLink fashion , or  urlLink face . Give them credit! They haven't fucked up yet!     Plus, they're cute as a buttons.

       The Lovemakers & Bart Davenport   urlLink     urlLink     2 new articles about my 2 favorite local bands!!! (Click on a pic to read an article!) They're both playing this weekend, but I've run out of money. Image: Me turning out my trouser pockets to show sad emptiness. Maybe I can convince XX to take me to BartD tomorrow night.   In semi-related hilarity, I'd like to congratulate myself on the awful pixelation of BartD's pic above. It's truly horrendous/hilarious and takes this blog to new lows/highs. Sorry Abby, left alone, I've dragged our blog through mud. Pixelated mud.

         urlLink Blow Out  was bad. The hairstylist, Jonathan Something, is a retarded asshole. He is bossy, smarmy, jerky, creepy, lecherous, and most of all the tannest phony baloney ever on television. He is so retardedly fake that I wanted to snap off his Ken-doll head and replace it with a plum... natural, juicy, and sometimes sweet. And in the contest between Jonathan and a plum, the plum would win because plums aren't high on themselves.  And... he's STRAIGHT! The worst part about this show is he's packaged like a metrosexual, snappy and fey, but his cheesy oversexed gaze and his objectification of women is absurd. He looks gay, but acts like a fratboy. His appearance suggests sophistication and suavity, but his behaviour is sophomoric cheeseball. He hit on this Barbie-doll girl by saying something ridiculous like, "The book's not closed on you and me..." then he ogled her as she walked away, then chuckled. What a slimey scuzzoid! And, she fell for his inane lines! She was like, "Okay...." If this is how people communicate in Beverly Hills, I demand a civil war in California. We must seccede from the South!     Besides Jonathan himself, the unsympathetic stylist, the show is rife with flaws: 1. He has no foil. No one tempers him because it's his salon and everyone else on the show is his employee. Any opposition is met with a dull confrontation where he basically says, "It's my salon" and the antagonist will tensely nod their head. This exchange is supposed to equal resolution, but it only equals lifeless (i.e. frustrating) TV.  2. The show is too long. It's boring in its length. There was no actual haircutting til 40 minutes in. Just Jonathan talking about himself and saying insipid narcissistic things like, "I can't hire a guy in my salon who's taller than me." More haircuts! More analysis of technique. More secrets of the biz! LESS Jonathan! Shut his mouth! Since Jonathan is detestable, make the show watchable by censoring him! Censor him and force him to actually cut hair! Please!  3. He has no redeeming qualities. He's all hubris. Where's the humanity? The sad irony? The complexity and compassion? The layers? The depth?   4. This is clearly a "Queer Eye" knockoff: Take an expert in the field of makeover/transformation and follow them around because they're bound to be fabulous, right? WRONG. The difference between Blowout and Queer Eye, is that the Queer Guys are likable. They're affable and sincerely want to help their shmoes. They're generous, patient, and down with the peeps. They exude effortless charm. Jonathan is arrogant and doesn't even cut that much hair on the show. Where's the love, Jonathan? Do you even like what you do? What are you in it for? He's like a Beverly Hills podperson - empty, insipid, and overtanned. And he's got machismo problems. He can't get along with other guys as he's constantly trying to affirm his alpha-male status:  1. He fires a contractor who's his friend.  2. He's a real ass to his "difficult" male employee.  3. He won't hire the taller guy.   I spent an hour of my precious evening with this insensitive humorless poohead and I feel used. Jonathan turned my brain into jelly. Tasteless low-carb Splenda-sweetened jelly. This show is only a primer for those who are jerks-in-training. You want to be a dunderhead fratboy in metrosexual clothing? You want to brown-nose your own rear? Watch this show. As for the rest of America's couch potatoes, I think I speak for all us sedentary spuds when I say: Turn the channel! We work hard for our money to pay for cable! Who the heck wants to spend an hour each week with a jerk?!

       Tuesday Entertainment News   * Today a new reality show premieres on Bravo called  urlLink Blow Out . It's about a faaabluss Hollywood hair designer who opens a salon. Margaret Cho is one of his clients. I'm totally excited, but I'll have to set the timer on my VCR as I'm hanging out with a friend who doesn't want to watch this with me. Sometimes I question my friends. ("Why are you talking over Seth Cohen? Shht! No-talking-over-Seth-Cohen!")   *  urlLink PJ Harvey 's new CD, Uh Huh Her, comes out today. I own almost all of her albums and I adore Ms. Harvey. My favorite album?     * Over the weekend I went to the Art Deco exhibit at the  urlLink Legion of Honor . I highly recommend this exhibit. It's thoughtful and incorporates diverse aspects that comprise the movement such as fashion, furniture, and entertainment, as well as standard art like sculpture and painting. The one thing that was missing from the exhibit was a piece on SF's own Palace of Fine Arts! Our very own Art Deco monument in the city, missing from the exhibit! Fer chrissakes!! World scope is great, but allow us a little regional pride! For those who went to the exhibit and want some local learnin, here's some  urlLink hizzistry  for some KQED-style schoolin! Whoop-whoop, y'all!     * David Sedaris's new  urlLink book  is out! I love his essays, his books, his readings, his everything. He has such keen observations and his writing is so witty and succinct. I'm almost jealous of his literary-superhero qualities, but only almost. At his readings he always ends with a book recommendation that allows him to address the audience directly. He talks spontaneously and conversationally and when he does this, he can be inarticulate and--dare-I-type-- dithering . This makes him all the more awesome! Long live brainiac social retards!  * Lastly, I'd like to wish Abby Apple a safe road trip towards the wilds of Wisconsin. This week there'll only be one bad apple musing randomly from her boring office job. I will do my best.

       urlLink Franz Ferdinand  @ Regency Grand Ballroom 06-04-04	    Met up with R-guy and W-gal whose charming personality and sweet connections got us into a sold-out show. The first band  urlLink The Blood Arm  was lame. They sound very "now" but instead of influences like Television or Gang of Four, their influences are The Strokes' "Is This It" and The Strokes' "Room on Fire". The lead singer does a convincing impression of Julian Casablancas in vocal delivery, but he's no Julian because he definitely is not the offspring of a Nordic beauty queen and a modeling mogul: rather, he looks like a warthog. Like "Pumba" from The Lion King. R-guy was less scathingly mean: "He looks like Tattoo."  Another "now" element they incorporated that irked me was their basslessness. Where was their bass? Seeing a new band with no bass is no longer shocking, but annoying in its ubiquity. I don't care how long this band's been around. They sound like they were born yesterday and are hence, doubly derivative. They're derivative of derivatives. What's the pride in that? Where's the originality? The guitarist strapped his guitar high, a la Albert Hammond Jr. and they were uniformly clad in blazers over t-shirts and skinny pants. Blah. They're unoriginal Johnny-come-latelys.   The next band  urlLink Sons And Daughters  I really liked. They're from Glasgow, Scotland, but they make very American sounding music. Like edgy bluegrass. Like a plugged in Gillian Welch on strong coffee. Like a ramblin Lucinda Williams with optimism and an agenda. I enjoyed their set very much and I want to see them again. Compelling. Dynamic. Whereas The Blood Arm seemed like poseury hacks, Sons and Daughters played interesting thoughtful music and performed like they believed in it. 2 guys, 2 girls and cute, to boot. They're a class act.   Franz Ferdinand are the new Duran Duran. Dapper dudes who make rockin swanky dance music. There were so many baby-cheeked little high schoolers in the crowd. I felt like a chaperone at a school dance. I looked for a punchbowl to stand by. Franz Ferdinand played great and, except for the dazed bassist, have incredible energy. They demonstrate that it's possible to shake your booty and play guitar at the same time. We got as close to the stage as the excited teenage girls would let us, but towards the end the heat was exhaustive so we exited the pit and watched from the balcony. I highly recommend their album. It's punchy and full of danceable hooks. The show was terrific, but I'm too old for the audience frenzy and hyperactivity and muggy-school-dance-in-the-gym-sweaty-sold-outted-ness of Franz Ferdinand.

       Passing Time  It's about 30 minutes after midnight and I can't sleep. To be fair, I haven't attempted to because I know I will just get frustrated trying. Instead I'm on a burning frenzy. Tomorrow we set off for Winemucca, NV, first of several stops on our way to midwest, and I need my iPod ready. I'm simultaneously making M a 'goodbye' CD full of cheezy love songs I wouldn't normally put on anyone's mix exept that he's spending his last night at his mom's and I'm feeling sad and lonely and a little pathetic. Hmm..just looked at my playlist for the mix and one of every three songs is by a Stephin Merritt band. This is definitely a result of current pathetic mood. But I can't help it! I know I wouldn't feel so sentimental about us if there wasn't an expiration date attached to this relationship.  The past week has been a big haze, everything in soft focus and dreamlike (this state has led to several almost-car-collissions). I'd like to pretend that it's because I'm in love, but I know that it's really due to serious lack of sleep combined with having to work overtime. I have also taken to napping in the afternoon but when I wake up, I'm usually even more confused and tired than beforehand.  In preparation for the trip, I also got a brand new Cannon Powershot 4 megapixel digicamera. I shot a short movie, but I'm not sure if I can upload it onto blogger...will try when I get back..  It's 1:15..better try to catch the last 5 hours of some sleep. Tomorrow is going to be hell at work..and then lots and lots of driving.

       What I Plan To Do This Summer  Vacation days cleared. This summer I'm using my vacation time to take one day off every other week to spend with my mom. That's six entire non-working days. Our plans for Argentina got scrapped because of my aunt's cancer, so I asked my mom if she would give me cooking lessons. She agreed. I asked her if she would help me differentiate between meat cuts and show me how to select a ripe mango. I do not know these things. One time I bought her some coconuts and she smirked because they were "bad" coconuts. How was I supposed to know that I was supposed to shake them? And pretend I DID shake them, what was I supposed to listen for anyway? This summer, this knowledge will be mine.

       urlLink John Vanderslice  &  urlLink Pedro the Lion  @ BOTH 06-03-04      It started at 9:30pm, but I got there at 10 to a sold-out club and John Vanderslice playing "Me and My 424" as I waited in the line to get in. The combination of his floppy platinum hair and his goofy features made me want to dub him "Sir Pee Wee" but that is not the point. He's  actually not that goofy, but someone who's churned out two good pop albums recently: "Life & Death of an American FourTracker" and "Cellar Door." He's got more back catalog, but I have not yet listened to those. It's indie, it's singer-songwriter-y; not epic, or emo, but a good toe-tappin--yet laid-back--listen for your morning busride. He had an amazing bass player in his live band who added some righteous funk to his songs--as funky as you can get for a band of translucent-skinned indie rockers.  Pedro the Lion was next and they were okay. I have copies of two of their albums (thanks W-gal!) and it's bedroom music. You listen to it alone in your bedroom. On repeat. I've listened to them a couple times each but don't know the songs as intimately as their well-behaved yet quietly rabid fans. Their fans were rapt with attention, absorbing the music, and in ecstacy. But for me, the casual show-go-er, PtL didn't do anything. They made no impression on me. He's a good singer, but the PtL show is for fans only who come to hear the songs, because they provide no easy entertainment or showmanship. There's no urgency. They're self-serious and don't crack jokes. And the bassist looks like Al Borlen from "Home Improvement."   After a couple of songs, they took a break to field questions from the audience. This shook me from my stupor and I found this segment engaging. One person shouted out, "What do you think of Pitchfork?" and lead-dude (I dub him "Pedro" from now on) said that he reads  urlLink pitchforkmedia.com  every other day even though they gave the last album a 3.7. Someone else shouted, "What's your favorite book?" and Pedro cited Salinger's "Nine Stories." From the back someone yelled, "Did you ever finish 'The Idiot'?" and regretfully he said no then added, "But it's in my bathroom, if I ever want to pick it up again."   Okay, so they're not that self-serious. But it's not music to shake your hips or flap your elbows too. It's cerebral because the songs focus more on the lyrics (and where that takes you) than the melodies. There are good melodies, but not a lot of hooks. No juicy riffs, no punchy choruses. In conclusion, I left before midnight because I'm old, but I'll still listen to their CDs at home. On repeat even.

       T Minus 3   Only a few days until M & A's wildin ridin and I'm very excited. We cancelled our plans to see a movie with friends last night so we can go home and crash, but instead stayed up until midnight with maps and guidebooks and laptops spread over my bed, looking up routes and campsites. There are still phone calls to be made, information to be gathered, and rules to be agreed upon, but overall I think we're in good shape. I'll even admit that despite my initial hesitation, our little excercise in cohabitation is going rather well. Sure, he sleeps in until 11 and then takes another nap at 4, but as a result of all that rest he is very responsive to my naggy demands, like taking my car to the shop or picking me up from work. And, at the risk of sounding unfeminist, it's nice to come home after work and have someone else make decisions regarding dinner and evening plans. This definitely makes me see the appeal of a housewife.  He asked me the other night whether I think we'll be together forever. I stared at him with a crazy bewildered look in my eyes (which he couldn't see because it was pitch dark) and told him that since he is essentially leaving me to go live on the other side of the continent, no I don't. I reminded him that we're breaking up next Sunday. Which makes me a little sad, but, as has been done before, I will get used to the life of a singleton and fill my time with things more productive than snuggling all day with a boy. Let's see...studying for the GRE, my design & HTML classes, fruit picking with roomies, consuming huge amounts of alcohol with roomies, going to baseball games with Ira, sewing, cooking, and if I still have time left after all that insane productivity, visiting moms and pops and dog Oscar at the 'moms&pops' compound on the other side of the park. Sigh..

       urlLink Ben Lee  @ Cafe du Nord 06-02-04    Ben Lee is so much better live than his recent CDs. He's so funny and charming and full of good vibes and just an unparalleled raconteur. He came out with an acoustic guitar and a bright red sari-like scarf draped around his shoulders. He sang a tune, then told a story about how Mike Watt, who is currently playing with the Stooges, was told by Iggy Pop that he couldn't wear flannel if he was going to play in the Stooges. Mike Watt says what should I wear then? and Iggy goes do it like I do, go shirtless and Mike Watt says I haven't played shirtless since '81 but he decides to do it anyway. And Ben Lee says if Mike Watt can do it, so can I, and he puts down his guitar and takes off his shirt. Then he wraps the sari around his shoulders again which covers himself up almost completely, picks up his guitar, and proceeds to play.  He was joined by a sweet-looking gal named Lara on keyboards/bass and Jason Schwartzman of "Rushmore"/ Phantom Planet fame. I know earlier that I've stated that Jason Schwartman is a fugly dude, but I'd like to take this opportunity to rescind that statement. His characters onscreen are detestable, but in person, he's a wonder and kinda cute. He alternated between the keyboards, bass, and drums and was a non-spotlight-hoggy guy, not saying much and hiding under his green baseball cap. And when he drummed, he'd do that cool drumstick twirly-spinny move even though he was playing with  urlLink splashsticks .  Mid-set Lara prompted Ben to "Make [Jason] laugh!" and Ben started strumming his guitar and singing:  We've been on the run/ Driving in the sun/ Looking out for #1/ California here we come/ Right back where we started from/  And Jason hid beneath his hat, embarrassed, while I cheered, because he was singing "California" by Jason's ex-band, Phantom Planet. It's also the theme song to "The OC." But enough with starstruckness, Ben put on a great show and he played a lot of songs from his first album, including two of my favorites, "Away With the Pixies" and "Pop Queen". In all the shows that I've seen him play starting from, like, '95, he has NEVER played "Away With the Pixies." It was a real treat.   The opener was Sean Hayes, who I assumed was the actor who plays "Jack" from Will and Grace, but he's actually a local folkie-Americana singer-songwriter. Same name, different guy. He was good, but didn't appeal to me. He was neither painful nor delightful.

       Memorial Day  I spent the entire morning making Mac n Cheese from a recipe in Everyday Food. I made my own breadcrumbs for the first time. Then brought that over to XX's house for his backyard BBQ. I saw his ex-gf for the first time in person. He was with her for five years then she dumped him. I mostly avoided her because I didn't have anything to say and if I did say something, it would sound forced. Despite this one neurosis, I had a good time. I ate a cheeseburger and a grilled shrimp kebab and a polish sausage and lots of mac n cheese. When XX brought my dish over to the table he said that everyone cheered. Though I mostly hung back and tried to be invisible, his friends engaged me in conversations and made lots of jokes at XX's expense. This made me feel right at home.   After everyone left, XX showed me his collection of swizzle sticks and bar accoutrements and demonstrated how to play a nose flute. I tried, but it sounded feeble. I blamed it on his cavernous Caucasian nostrils versus my small pea-sized ones. He ignored my self-oppressive statements and said to keep trying. After a while I could manage some thin airy notes but I was starting to feel light-headed. I made him give the nose flute to me and I'm currently working on expanding my repertoire from three notes to five.  I'm also back to boinking, but with rubbers this time around. My friend, Mr.Hottie, is training to be a counselor for people with HIV/AIDS and the stuff he tells me is harrowing. I already have to deal with my fair share of physical afflictions and disappointments, so I do not want to add HIV/AIDS to my depressive hodgepodge. I would like to live a long time and die of old age. I would like to live a long time and die of old age surrounded by my coterie of gay male worshippers.

      Then there are times when I think working downtown has its moments:  Today on the corner of Montgomery &amp; Market there was a mattress set up with burgundy sheets and a pillow. On the mattress were a young man and a young lady, both clad only in underwear, cuddling and snuggling with legs wrapped around each other. A sign behind them read "Vegetarians make better lovers".. a large crowd gathered around them to see if they will actually do it. I couldn't stay b/c I was too hungry to wait around. Only in San Francisco I tell ya!

       Friday Mumble  This morning, while waiting for my bagel at Noah's, I realized that when I lived in my tiny fishing village in northern Japan three years ago, I imagined my life as I currently live it to be the ideal. Yes, at the time I daydreamed of essentially becoming a yuppie. How could I? I guess other than learning Japanese, hanging out with horse farmers and waiting for my eye lashes to unfreeze after showering, I had a lot of time to think of my lovely SF and what I wanted to do when I got back. The idea of a corporate urban lifestyle, as it was portrayed on Amerian and Japanese sitcoms alike, appealed to me. Up to that point I had only had jobs in food and retail and knew I didn't want to go back to that. It was actually a lot like the concept of suburbia, which I didn't learn about until college (I know, ignorance, but I didn't know a single person who didn't live in a city) but always thought of as this really neat place to live. Well, like suburbia, which I had the displeasure of 'getting to know' while dating someone who lived in buttfucknowhere, my realized current state of yuppie-dom has definitely lost the charm it once had in my head and has become  Office Space . So I am, once again, looking for adventures that marketing reports and proposals simply can't provide. Sure I can find another marketing or urban planning job, but soon it, too, will suck big balls.  M keeps pushing me travel with him around India later this year. Until now, I have given him the standard, broken record response for why I can't go - "I have a lease, awesome roomies, a boring yet decent paying job that allows me to read blogs while updating my own, and most importantly, a hefty credit card debt that I can't keep ignoring". Well, unless this fucking job upgrade comes through at the office, I will look for ways to ignore the debt and go traveling for a month or two. I will call it a sabbatical and ask for unpaid leave. This of course depends on where M finds a job in September - so far the dumb fool has only turned down job offers.  Anyways, that's all I have to say this morning, my head is still fuzzy from too much sleep. So, to recap (Batty, these have become my favorite three words) - I love my friends, I hate my job, I love SF, I hate Antioch. Oh and my little brother is leaving for Columbia tomorrow morning and I'm going to miss the little bastard.

       2 More Days    &nbsp; 2 more days of loafing around. I'm taking the rest of the week off just cuz. My work sent my a gigantic "Phalaenopsis Orchid" and a card. I'm hanging out with Green Marble's bf who is obsessed with " urlLink Texas Justice ."   Yesterday we walked all the way to the beach then all the way back. We took our blood pressures at Rite Aid at "The Geary Mall" and The Safeway on La Playa. He's lost a substantial amount of weight, while I've gained a substantial amount of weight, so when we stood on the scale at Rite Aid, we basically weighed the same though he is MALE and TALLER THAN ME!!!   In family news, we've all collectively gained weight, so there's a bet. It started with my brother. He's an ace gambler and loves to wager so he bet my narcoleptic cousin-in-law P. Diddy, his chubby equal, fifty bucks for fifteen pounds. Whoever loses 15 lbs first gets $50. Then all the other guys got in on it too. The bigger bet is whoever loses the most weight by August 20--the eve of my cousin Duck-duck's dam hoi (engagement ceremony)--wins. The players include my brother, P.Diddy, the fiancee, and P.Diddy's brother.   I'm secretly competing too, but shhhh. It's because relatives like to poke my brother in the gut and go, "Chubby! Chubby!" while I titter nearby. If he loses the weight, I do not want them to re-direct their pointy fingers to the nearest gut:  mine .

       Batty Update   My dad passed away on Saturday night. We were all out laughing and celebrating my grandma's life after her funeral when my brother got the call from the hospital. We quickly organized 3 carloads of cousins and honorary family and sped to Hayward to see my father for the last time.   I stood by the side of his bed and cried quietly. I heard my brother sniffling but I didn't want&nbsp;to look away from my father's face. I wanted to take one long&nbsp;last look. My mother&nbsp;hurried in shortly afterwards&nbsp;with the bag of white cloths that we had used earlier for grandma's ceremonies. We wrapped them around our heads and watched as she touched his face and closed his eyes. She then led a prayer for him.&nbsp;We all knew what to do because this&nbsp;was our third death this year. Grandpa in January, grandma last week, and now my dad.&nbsp;   I took 3 days off from work this week to fill my head with mindless television and&nbsp;fill my stomach&nbsp;with empty calories.&nbsp;I've been helping my mom with dealing with the paperwork and procedures of death:&nbsp;  get a death certificate,&nbsp; get a doctor's certification of death... notify health insurance, and notify social security...  I've&nbsp;taken to wearing a "mourn-iform"&nbsp;of a big grey fleece&nbsp;sweatshirt and baggy grey sweatpants. I've worn this for several days. Green Marble says I'm one step away from wearing mumuus.   Anyway I'm still&nbsp;realizing that&nbsp;my dad is dead&nbsp;so I really don't have anything concrete to say about it now. But I wrote this on Friday for my grandma and I was going to work on it and post it on Monday, but&nbsp;life got in the way. So here it is. Here is how I remember grandma...    My grandma was a smart-aleck who'd squeeze my arm and say with a smile,"Beu!" (This word is usually applied to a succulent fatty cut of meat.) She was fun to be around and liked to tease people in a harmless good-natured way. In my eyes she had always been old with a head of snow white hair that she'd wear in a loose bun. She&nbsp; pottered around her garden and liked to keep up with the kids.     &nbsp;   I remember when I was about 7 our whole clan went camping and though she was small and old, she went hiking on a sometimes steep, rocky trail with us kids... When I stayed at her house in the summer with my auntie and cousins, sometimes she'd microwave us mini pizzas and let me sip from a squat can of 7-up... She liked the taste of mint and she liked to smoke a cigarette when she did the #2... She was deeply religious and prayed a rosary every night with my grandpa. Once the rosary began, there could be no interruptions until they were finished. And if I wanted to watch one of my beloved weekly sit-coms on TV, I had to wait until they were done and a respectful interval of time had passed. Then I'd meekly ask my auntie, "Can I watch TV?"     &nbsp;   Grandma's house always had cobwebs in the corners, but it was never dusty. Her guest room and her extra blankets smelled faintly of liniments like eucaplytus or tiger balm... She kept a plastic flower mirror that I was really fond of for its simple charm. She also had an enlarged school picture of me that my parents gave her when I was in pre-school. My cousins teased me merciliessly for the immortalized trickle of snot&nbsp;streaming from my nose... My grandma was the smallest adult I knew and I remember feeling really proud of myself when I surpassed her height in the 3rd or 4th grade.     &nbsp;   Every Sunday my mom would drive my brother and I down to visit, and each week at the end of our visit, she would send us home with pouches of Capri Sun and other treats. And when I said goodbye to her she would make me wait as she pulled out a couple of dollar bills from her purse and hand them to me. I was a&nbsp;shy, sensitive,&nbsp;crybaby twat kid. No one ever gave me money (paper money, even!) for no reason. My grandma thought I was aaalright. &nbsp; My grandma was aaalright.  Cam on,   Ba .   Rest in Peace.

      Is anyone else getting completely ferklemped watching the Democratic National Convention? Instead of parking my car, running in to grab a burrito, and speeding home to scarf it down (on my bed, of course), I sat&nbsp;parked in front of Gordo's for 45 minutes listening to NPR&nbsp;comentary and finally Barack Obama's speech, parts of which I literally cried through. The way I see it is this&nbsp;- if Bush wins for another four terrifying years, this will have been our closest moment to victory, so I better enjoy it while it lasts.

       urlLink The Gossip  @ BOTH 08-22-04  urlLink     Openers: Dance Disaster Movement, The Rogers Sisters  DDM: The skinny dude was wearing a red "Annie" dress. I was not impressed. The more they played the more I liked them less and less.  TRS: They don't live up to the hype. Decent, but not amazing. Danceable music that sounds like The B-52s: girl singer, boy yelper. If you want to hear 80s music done right with modern relevance, see The Lovemakers. Their music is excellent, the singing is unbeatable and their live show is nothing short of exciting.  Gossip: They’re great. Beth Ditto is a powerhouse singer. She infuses my body with soul-wrenching blues. I love The Gossip and they’re one of the reasons I’m a member of the Church of Rocknroll. Here’s a mini-interview with them from  urlLink Kill Rock Stars :   WHATS YR FAVORITE FOOD?  BETH: hamburgers and fries for $2.80 at lews eastbay. BRACE: the number 9 at taco bell,3 soft tacos and a medium drink!! KATHY: sushi.   WHAT’S THE MOST EMBARASSING OUTFIT YOU HAVE EVER WORN?  BETH:a puff painted unicorn outfit,tightrolled with fuscia socks a pair of black suede shoes and a derby hat! i also had a perm at the time!! BRACE:my sister tried to tell me that i once owned a blind melon t-shirt,but, i know this is not true!! i swear!! KATHY:a tie with stirrup pants and a body suit.

       Thoughts   Here I am again, same year, same chapel, different funeral... There's my mom and all my aunts and uncles... there's my grandma in the casket... all my cousins are here... here we all are, dressed in black again... there are the huge wreaths of roses again... here's the funeral director again... Hey there's Chi Tram's new baby... ohmygod that baby is enormous... that baby is the Sta-Puft Marshmallow Baby, goddamn!...   Here we are praying again... the priest is saying comforting things for the grieving, but I don't feel anything... I don't feel sad, I don't feel grief, I don't feel like crying at all... what's the deal with priests anyway? what kind of god gives man a sex drive but enforces celibacy? what is a priest who takes vows of celibacy, then has sex with altar boys? what is up with the catholic church!...   here we are tying the white cloths around our heads again... why do i feel like i'm ralph macchio in the karate kid?.. hey, i can feel my heart beating in my skull... throb, throb, throb... uh, better loosen this knot; it's a little tight.  here we are chanting again, the familiar drone of rote praying... there's the kind-faced priest from last time who starts the Hail Marys and Our Fathers in English... here we are again answering in Vietnamese... hey my aunt's responding to the Our Father with the Hail Mary ending... she's going on automatic!... here I am saying the prayers in Vietnamese... I know the phonetics, but what am I saying? Ugh I'm a total charlatan, what am I doing here... hey! she just did it again! She's chanting the wrong response! isn't she paying attention to the prayer?...   last time at grandpa's funeral i remember the candelabra swaying spookily... ops, there it goes swaying again... here we go walking up to light the incense and do the bows again... here I am looking at my grandma's body in the coffin... she really doesn't resemble herself... what did the mortician do to her mouth and jawline?... oh look, she has gloves on; I was wondering how they'd cover her purple hand... why is she flat-chested? she used to have a big chest... do boobies shrink in death? that is really weird... her hair's pretty cute... her dress is pretty...   here are my cousins sobbing again... why are they so sad? maybe they were closer to grandma because they were older and back then there were less cousins and thus she lavished them with more attention... wait, what is this? am i jealous? no, no, i just feel guilty for not feeling sad... I'm trying to justify my lack of emotion... why is it that women cry and men don't really?... why do they expect women to cry? I'm a woman and I'm not crying... for men it's forgivable because they're "strong" but if women don't cry it's almost wrong... jeez, i know that afterwards everyone will talk about who cried and who didn't... I better bring an onion tomorrow... I better bring one for Saturday too.

       urlLink        Stop Talking    Ugh. Just came back from dinner with Rami and her&nbsp;boyfriend. &nbsp;It was one of those evenings I wish I could rewind so that instead of going out, drinking&nbsp;and saying lots of dumb shit, I&nbsp;would instead&nbsp;just go to my room and clean and pay bills and feel like a responsible adult. I have gotten better at sensoring the random offensive comments that come out of my mouth, but I still have nights like this when I'm having too much fun to care and then I regret it. We went to get Naan 'n Curry on O'Farrell and the whole time I&nbsp;poked my fork into the common biryani plate and pick out all the cauliflower because I love it so much and shoveled it into my mouth. I was aware of what I was doing but did it anyway because food overrides my common sense and my desire to act civilized.   Does anyone want two pittbull puppies? Coco, the female, is photographed above (or is it the other one?). I'm helping this guy in my neighborhood get these sweet dogs adopted. They are 7 months old, have had all the shots, are fixed and even have that little chip installed in their leg. I've totally lagged on posting the ad on craigslist - he's probably wondering why noone has called. Resposibilities!! Need to focus on that. No more driving off for weekends or drinking every night.

       Diet Schmi-et   Today is my 2nd day this week of non-walking. Instead of exercising today, I ate a donut. A raised chocolate donut. Here is a  urlLink reference guide  if you are unfamiliar with my donut lingo. Who here doesn't speak donut? Hands!  Yesterday for lunch XX and I went to  urlLink Rudy's Can't Fail Cafe . They were voted "Best Fries" in the East Bay Express and it's a quick 2-minute drive from work, so we figured what the hey. He ordered a Patty Melt and I ordered a Reuben and we traded halves. Each plate came with a huge mound of perfect french fries, crisp and golden. And the waitstaff there are supercute, young, and hip. Confession: I'm in love with my waitress. She was full of smiles and wore a denim mini and metallic silver slingbacks. Yesterday I felt old and tired so it was nice to be attended to by a young girl with good looks and quiet charm. Truth be told, she's probably only a few years younger than me, but sometimes when I feel really bogged down I feel like I'm a 50 year-old woman. My inside age is probably my physical age, but in dog years. So that would make me... hold on... Start/ Programs/ Accessories/ Calculator... click click click... 182 years old. Yup, that's about right.   And since I'm officially old, I'm now on the lookout for badges that will reflect my wisdom and maturity:    "The Diet Starts Tomorrow"   "A Moment on The Lips, Forever on the Hips."   I will also consider these in a tasteful fridge magnet.

       The Return of Diane DiMassa   In high school I used to be a comic book nerd. But not Marvel or DC. I used to read independent comics like the K Chronicles and Ernie Pook's Comeek; I supported artists like Ariel Bordeaux and Fawn Gehweiler; I loved Maus and Barefoot Gen which my friend  urlLink Raina  introduced me to, and I lamented the closing of Comic Relief on Haight St. I especially mourned the disappearance of my favorite comic hero,  urlLink Hothead Paisan , homicidal lesbian terrorist. Man, that comic was so funny. I remember I'd go to Haight St after school and if they had a new issue I'd immediately snatch it up, hungrily reading it and laughing out loud on the bus ride home.  Today XX let me pick out a few magazines at Border's and I chose Bitch and Magnet. And inside Bitch is a 7-page interview with Hothead's creator, Diane DiMassa! Oh happy day! What's she been up to? I'm dying to know! I can't wait to read it. I am drooling in anticipation.

       urlLink The Magnetic Fields  @ Palace of Fine Arts 07-20-04  I love going to shows, but I think I'm sick of writing reviews. I'm not sick of having an opinion though so I will say that, live, Steven Merritt is a magnificent grump. He doesn't say much when he performs leaving the between-song banter to the girlish and dorky Claudia. Partway through, someone from the audience shouted out, "San Diego Zoo!" and he grumbled, "No requests, please." When he sings, his voice is low and sonorous like a cello and I envy his lyrics and knack for clever rhymes.   Opening for TMF was an acoustic folkie singer-songwriter from Australia whose name I forget. At the end of his set he had his friends play some rhythm (cowbell?) from the back of the theater and it was a hilarious disaster. "Tempo! Tempo!" I mock-complained but the enthusiastic arhythm continued. It was like hearing two different songs being played at the same time, one from the stage and one from the last row. It was unintentionally cacophonous. This is why I love live performance: the spontaneity and the mistakes that ensue; the potential for either transcendance or comic disaster.  Fuck. I just wrote a review. Anyway, here's a fuller one below if you want more in-depth analysis. Just click on Steven Merritt's face.

       Hair Update   My hair is officially in the awkward growing-out stage. It used to be short, but now it's neither short nor long. The back used to stick straight out like a chick (God bless Asian hair) but now it does this bend thing where if a boa constrictor coiled itself around my neck it would not disrupt the back of my hair at all.   If a boa constrictor should coil itself around my neck, I would jiggle my goods and sing, "I'm a... Slaave 4 U!"

       Take It or Leave It   Today I am taking destiny into my own unusually small&nbsp;hands. And by that I mean I am circumventing normal company procedures and talking to the director into whose group I want to transfer to (HR is seriously lagging, it's been two weeks). I will look at him with a serious look on my face and say "Marvin, may I close the door? This is confidential." Then I will tell him about how awesome I am and why he should hire me&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of the 'mousy girl' he has been interviewing for the past two weeks. I will say 'You want this!' and I will point to myself. I&nbsp;went over all sorts of scenarios&nbsp;on the bus and most of them conclude with him saying "Thanks Abby, but no thanks. We&nbsp;already promised the 'rat-like girl'&nbsp;the&nbsp;job and you know how that is." And then, discouraged yet ever so determined, I will walk back to my desk and download and send&nbsp;porn photos&nbsp;to '#everyone'. This will likely&nbsp;lead to me getting fired, which will lead to limitless days of sleeping in and sewing and rock climbing and Dr. Phil and going camping while receiving unemployment checks. See? Either way I win!! Fuck, I'm a&nbsp;little nervous. Kelly has been coaching me on the 'urban planning' process so that the ass I make of myself will not be as enormous. And I'm listening to Franz Ferdinand to get pumped up. Wish me luck, gentle readers.  &nbsp;  Also - Tonight Battz &amp; I are seeing my number one favorite   Magnetic Fields   ..I'm wearing a shirt with absorbent cotton sleeves into which I will cry like a baby. A baby in love with Stephin Merritt.

       Weekend   On Friday night my grandma passed away.   On Saturday I visited my auntie (and also&nbsp;checked in with the family members who are taking care of her) and she looks even worse. She could barely talk to us because she was in so much pain from the cancer. She has a morphine patch that supposedly provides relief, but she was teary-eyed and her face was in a constant grimace. She tried to say hello to us, but then another surge of pain would shoot through her and she would hold her stomach and squeeze her eyes shut. This is from a woman who never complains about anything. I sometimes have to leave the room because I feel so helpless and sad and frustrated that I can't&nbsp;lessen her pain. I know the magnitude of it must be&nbsp;excruciating when she whispers, "It hurts."   After that my brother, his gf, and I drove up to visit my dad. On the way there my brother goes, "It's bright!" and reaches for his sunglasses. And I just about choked on my own spit because he puts on his face these monstrously huge, hideous, Yoko-Ono-type, my-pupils-are-dilated-so-I-have-to-wear-these-sunglasses sunglasses. And he puts them on OVER his regular glasses. I laughed so hard. "Where did you get those?!!" I said and he replied, "Walgreens. 5 bucks!" and I said, "God, I can't believe you were making fun of ME with MY sunglasses; just look at YOU with YOUR sunglasses on!" He stated in non-response, "I wear them to play poker."   Me: What??? Why??  Him: So people can't see my reaction. And so I can look at people and they can't tell.  Me: I can't believe you wear those. Isn't poker a coool game? Don't you want to  look  cool?  Him: No. I just want to win money.   Together we visited my dad who looks worse. His mouth was frightening to look into. His tongue was dried out and layers of skin were peeling off in rows. His entire mouth on the inside was peeling and it was like peering into the mouth of death. It was a cave of dried skin cobwebs instead of a regular mouth--an opening&nbsp;that is normally lubricated and alive. It was wrong and horrible. I wanted to help him. I wanted to take a spray bottle and mist his mouth with a couple squirts. I wanted him to respond when I talked to him or when the doctor shook his shoulder to try to rouse him, but nothing. The doctor told us he was still unresponsive and that he had kidney failure, a lung infection, and a urine infection. He said he would be able to tell us more on Sunday.   Sunday morning I got a call from my mom. There's no hope for my dad and we all decided together as a family that we could not prolong his life in the state that he was in. He's unresponsive, emaciated, doesn't talk, and cannot eat. We didn't want to prolong his state, connected to IVs and catheters, with a feeding tube. The doctors assured us that he would be comfortable and ensured us that they'd do their best to minimize any pain. My mom said that it was the right thing to do because he shouldn't suffer anymore. I told her that I agreed.   My mom said to me, "It's so sad that all these bad things are happening all at once,  con ." Then she corrected herself, "Well, not BAD; that's just life,  con ... It's just life."

       urlLink The Wrens  @ GAMH 07-16-04  urlLink    Openers: Film School, Jim Yoshi Pile-up  Went with LingL to The Wrens and scored a sweet spot smack dab front and center. Spotted a whole bunch of people I knew: R-guy and his crew, Jake, and my friend Eric from work. It was a good show. Film School were good, Jim Yoshi were boring, and The Wrens rocked. I must declare one more time that The Wrens are the best live band ever. The best show is The Flaming Lips, but the best rocknroll with no gimmicks is The Wrens. They're better than The Pixies live. The Wrens's albums pale in comparison to Pixies albums, but live, The Wrens take the cake. Take that, Fat Frank!  After the show I checked my cell phone and there was one text message from my cousin and one voicemail from my brother. I knew what it meant. You know there's something wrong when you get calls from relatives late at night. After the show was when my weekend began.

       Friday Fashion News   &nbsp;  In today's Friday Fashion News, the look is BBQ sauce smeared over faces and casual-Friday t-shirts. That's right; Work BBQ. Aah the sweet succulent smell of grilling Costco patties while&nbsp;imprisoned in&nbsp;an office&nbsp;is the ultimate olfactory reward for a job well done. The execs donned aprons and grilled burgers, dogs, and bbq chicken breasts on the patio while tremendous amounts of smoke billowed onto everyone and their pasty programmer complexions. There were trays of potato salad, regular salad, and beans. The condiments lacked bbq sauce but compensated with a strong showing of sauerkraut. There was also a respectable variety of cookies and desserts.  &nbsp;  In other fashion news, today is Nordstrom's Anniversary Sale and another day of Macy's Pre-Season Sale.  urlLink Urban Outfitters  has also come out with their new fall catalog. In honor of these events I'll be staying home, cleaning out my closet. Not to make room for more clothes but to create a fully functional, streamlined PULSATING&nbsp;GROTTO worthy of worship. Everything I reach for will be relevant and alive. A fashionista can also be an ascetic, eliminating mistakes from fashion past and turning her closet from hits, misses, and maybes to all hits, all the time. Unfortunately, mistakes from fashion past haunt&nbsp;the present in the form of&nbsp;credit card bills. This is the real reason why I'll be staying home--to keep my dreadful credit card monsters from charging and bankrupting my fashion future.

       Job Switch Update  &nbsp; Well, there's an associate&nbsp;position available in the group I want to switch to and what are they doing? Interviewing other people!! A girl descibed as 'mousy' interviewed on Wednesday, five thought-provoking days after my follow-up email to HR about how much I want to switch into this group. Maybe I have pigeonholed myself as an admin and they will never be able to see me as an associate. This weekend I will kick job search into high gear. My fat bitch boss&nbsp;will be here on Monday which will make me want to get the fuck out of here&nbsp;even more.&nbsp; To make matters worse I have the case of third eye - a giant zit on my forehead! Perhaps I will document it with a photo later.

       A Trying Time   Wednesday night my mom called to say my dad was in the hospital and I just lost it. One person dying is fine. Two people dying is PUSHING IT--I will handle it and cope. But the possibility of THREE? THREE IS TOO MANY!!!   I'm a fairly unemotional person but when I heard the news, I felt just... so distraught and sobbed like an animal for a long time. Then I went upstairs to tell my roommates and felt a little better. (sniff!)   So I took the day off from work yesterday and my brother took "The Sick and Ailing Tour" aka "The Skin and Bones Tour." I wore my big Elton John 70s glasses to hide my puffy eyes and he saw them and said, "Those are really big glasses" and I said "Yes" and he said, "No, they're REALLY big!" and I said "Yup" and he paused and concluded, "They're silly" and I agreed.   We drove to Hayward to visit my dad who was moved from the ICU to a regular wing and he looks awful. There were tubes and tape and bags. His shoulders were bony and his arms were like sticks. And his mouth was wide open which was shocking. It was beyond the relaxed "sleeping open-mouth." It looked like he had a fright. His eyes were open into tiny slits and we tried to wave at him and talk to him but there was no eye movement. There was no registry. We touched him and said "Hi!" and "Hello!" but no response.   We stayed there for a while and the doctor came in to talk to us. He said that my dad was dehydrated and they were slowly rehydrating him with the tubes. They said he was looking better than yesterday but they would be evaluating him on a daily basis. It's unclear whether he'll recover. It's uncertain whether he'll be able to move or even eat. We'll just have to wait.   We then drove to Redwood City to visit my grandma at the hospital there and we were greeted by three aunts who are keeping vigil over her. The doctor gave her 10 days. She's on morphine now so she's pretty sedated. Her eyes are closed but sometimes she'll open them real wide and look at something faroff... then they'll close again. I waved and greeted her but she didn't see me. She didn't register. She's still breathing heavily then stopping for long periods of time. Once I held my breath to see how long she stopped breathing and I ran out of air. A few seconds later she continued breathing. My brother said he overheard the doctor say that she's going to stop breathing for longer periods of time and then she will just stop breathing. Her hand is still puffy and purple and I know that beyond the morphine the physical pain must be excruciating. So we're all just waiting for the end for my grandma. I hope it will come soon because it will be an end to her pain.   After that we visited my auntie who talked animatedly but is still very weak and thin. Her cancer's spread and she won't be undergoing anymore chemo because she's not strong enough. We chatted for a bit then we walked across the way to my uncle's house (her brother) to sit in on the talks for my grandma with a funeral home director. This may seem gauche to write about the business of dying, so if you're appalled STOP HERE. If you're curious, read on...   The funeral director I recognized from January because he took care of the arrangements for my grandpa's funeral. He was very nice and was just going over the details of the funeral contract for my grandma. My relatives even negotiated a casket upgrade from metal to wood. While discussing the funeral arrangements and talking about how recent my grandpa had passed, my cousin, Little B, joked to the director,"So, is there a group discount for 20 or more?" and we all laughed.   Later when the director had left, Little B told us one of my aunt's went comparison shopping at a casket outlet. My brother and I's eyes both bugged out of our heads and we both whispered, "WHAT??? There's a CASKET OUTLET?" and she said just as incredulously, "Yeah! Can you believe it?" While we were sitting there, word came over from across the way that my auntie inquired whether we'd made arrangements for her ceremony, "since the director was already here and all." My cousin whispered, "Jeez! Morbid!" but that pragmatism towards death is typical in my family: most of my aunts and uncles have already paid for their own burial plots. At my great-aunt's funeral some time ago, while the tractor was pouring dirt over her coffin, my uncle&nbsp;bragged to Little B, "See that patch underneath the wheel? That's MY plot."

       This Week  Things are going shitty at work and with my family, so I have decided to throw my tent in the car and leave for the weekend. A friend just bought some foresty land up north (somewhere near Napa) so I'm going there for a couple of days. Also, my French class ends today and the HTML class ended last week, so I am finally responsibility-free.   I have started looking for another job. The promise of switching groups is still out there, but who knows how long they will dangle the carrot in front of my nose and my relationship with my boss is deteriorating fast. I'm trying to be 'pro-active' despite really really hating that word and reeeally hating the job-search process.  I saw my gramma over the weekend. When I came in to her cramped apartment, there were about 4 candy wrappers on the table and she was chewing on a piece of chocolate. Gramma, spit it out!, I said as I extended my hand, prepared to catch the piece falling out of her mouth. But she didn't spit anything out. She said that she wanted to overdose on sugar and die. Death by chocolate is odd but possible for gramm since she is extremely diabetic. She said she was feeling weak but then regained incredible strength as she proceeded to undermine every aspect of my life.  M is flying me to Missouri in September so that we can drive back together. It's been a month since our last trip and I've managed to accumulate a whopping 4 hours of vacation. Hopefully I will have enough by then. Or we'll get into a fight and the trip will get scrapped. Or I will quit/get fired and have unlimited time off.  Yesterday I took a sick (of work) day and went rock climbing with Marcus and Tomomi, a Japanese girl staying with him for two weeks. It was incredible - I learned to tie all the proper knots and belay others. This is what I would do daily if I ever met and married a rich man and quit my job. We went to get pho afterwards and then Tomomi and I did a little shopping. Today is the french presentation and I haven't even read my lines, much less memorized them. Better do that now.

       No more Montreal for me.    Yesterday Green Marble and I went down to the hospital to visit my grandma. Since last I saw her, a couple days ago, her face has become more gaunt and her breathing familiar. Familiar bad. Familiar in that  I've heard this breathing before  some months ago when my grandpa was dying. Heavy labored breathing followed by periods of no-breathing-at-all. And right when it's long enough and still enough for you to think, "Is this it?" you see a hand move and the breathing continues.  Afterwards we visited my aunt who is looking painfully thin. She was cheerful and even cracked a joke about death, much to the consternation of GreenM. It makes me sad to see my wonderful and kind aunt become weaker and more skeletal each time I visit. But she is so unselfishly generous that she makes light of things to keep visitors in good spirits. Even though she's in great pain, she makes jokes and talks about the future. Here's a bit of the conversation we had, last time I talked to her on the phone:  Aunt: So what are you going to do this summer? Me: I asked Mom to teach me how to cook Vietnamese food. I'm taking every other Wednesday off from work to go over to her house and  go grocery shopping. She's going to teach me how to buy food and cook it. I think it's time for me to learn. I don't know anything! I only know how to make fried rice. Aunt: (chuckling) Slow down! Slow down! I'll teach you how to cook. Listen, when I get better I'll teach you how to make  Canh Rau Day  and  Ca Gem !  Me: (voice cracking, swallowing lump in throat, faux-cheerily) Ok!  When I hung up the phone, I cried a little because I knew she wasn't going to get better and that she'd never teach me how to make my favorite meal. Then I got mad because why didn't she teach me these things when I was young and she was healthy? Why's she offering now when it's TOO LATE?? Then I got a little sad again. Then I felt okay.  So no Montreal for me. My mom says we'll have to postpone our trip together until things stabilize.

       Updates and Musings   * I might go to Montreal this summer for four days. My mom--who never goes anywhere--will be travelling to Maryland for a few weeks to visit her best friend there. Then together they'll take a train up to visit another friend in Quebec. I'm going to meet them there. My mom and her best friend talk everyday on the phone, but they see each other only once every 7-8 years or so.  *My aunt is losing weight. My grandma's in the hospital again. This time with a black hand. The nurse tried each finger to make an IV connection to her blood but was unsuccessful. All this blood pooled in her hand so from her wrist down it's dark purple, almost black. It's like Adam Sandler's foot in Mr.Deeds, but this time it's in person, it's my grandma, and it's not funny.   *I'm not playing music with J-Wo and her GF anymore. It's no longer a weekly affair, but downgraded to casual get-togethers whenever the spirit moves them. I'm neither happy nor sad about it. I still am holding on to my secret dream of rock star-dom. Why do I want to be a rock star? So I can one day make out with Alex Greenwald (phantom planet). Of course I will be 42 and he'll be twice-divorced and puffy and boozy, but I can handle that. A girl's gotta dream, right?  *XX and I have also downgraded to a casual affair. Though it's nicer when it's casual. I get presents when I'm not obsessive and wigged out. Why does it always happen that way? Why does indifference and disinterest get rewarded? Rewards like a matted and framed street painting that he bought in Paris; rewards like an electric toothbrush shaped like an ice cream cone!!; Rewards like him making me dinner though he doesn't really cook. He even made an effort to cook three things so I could have three different things on my plate: fish, spinach, and creamy risotto. I always think about how ideal it is to have three things on my plate at dinnertime, but I didn't know that I said it aloud. I also didn't know that he ever listened to me.   *The Satanic Verses is kicking my ass. Goddamn, is this a hard read. It's not THAT hard, it's just that once you put it down, it's hard to pick back up because of the allure of kickier reads like TeenVogue and Ellegirl. XX is 100 pages from finishing, and I can't let him beat me!

       BBQ Season   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    SF is a dismal place to be a BBQ enthusiast because of the implacable fog that smothers my part of town throughout the summer. The answer to this chilling depression is to (as Balki Bartakamous would say): "Get out of the city!" So far this summer, I've attended nine BBQs, 5 of them in hot sunny places a short drive from SF. Exotic, foreign, tropical locations such as Walnut Creek, Oakland, Milpitas, and Stinson Beach. These places have warm weather and clear blue skies. The heat is terrific. (So terrific in fact that I often retreat to milder conditions indoors.)   Two days ago, I hitched a ride with Jason and Green Marble to Stinson Beach for our friend Alden's 30th-bday BBQ. The best part about this fete was the whole roasted pig that was transported to the beach for our consumption. Oh my god, it was so good. Crisp crackly skin, juicy melt-in-your-mouth flesh, and a sweet peppery liver sauce that's drizzled on top of your portion.  Sigh.  Despite my valley girl accent, I'm a Vietnamese girl at heart, and I appreciate the rare occasions that call for a whole roasted pig. In my family there are only two occasions that guarantee one: the festive engagement ceremony and a ceremony celebrating the birth of a new baby. Everytime a Vietnamese baby is born, a pig dies. Such is the circle of life. The delicious mouth-watering circle of life... I love my Filipino friends because they commemorate special occasions with pigs too. And they're into chafing dishes! That is so so awesome. Portable units that keep food warm are so so awesome.  Also awesome about this particular BBQ were the group shots. There were rounds of Jack Daniels and rounds of Absolut Citron among other rounds that I had to sit out on. Sometimes when I'm at a staid BBQ, I think "God, everyone here should just get together and take a shot." But instead of shots, I'm just assaulted with more awkward silence and flaccid questions like what do I do and how do I know the host. This is what I endure to get cheeseburgers and grilled tri-tip. But this BBQ was all food, no work: cheeseburgers, grilled tri-tip, spicy papaya salad, mini lumpia, sausage-laden spaghetti, hot dogs, fresh oysters, roasted chickens, rice, creamed chicken breast... and of course, the pig. The lovely pig that oinked, "Screw your BMI worries, Batty. Eat me!"

       urlLink M.Ward  @ Swedish Music Hall 07-09-04    Openers: Etienne de Rocher, For Stars Show Buds: W-gal & Friends  Abby and I missed the first band, but we managed to catch the 2nd half of For Stars’s set. The singer was a man resembling Will Ferrell who wore a loud Hawaiian shirt. This made me crack up for a while even though he was singing heartfelt sad songs. I kept thinking I was watching a skit in which Will Ferrell parodies an emo singer-songwriter. When I got over the Will Ferrell resemblance, I enjoyed their set. The singer’s voice sounds like an oboe--very pure, warm, and reedy. They say that the oboe is the instrument that most resembles the human tone. Other singers I think sound like oboes are Celine Dion and Sarah McLachlan.  So in conclusion, did this man sounded like Celine Dion and Sarah McLachlan? At times. Which I think is a feat for a male singer. When he sang high, it wasn’t blatently falsetto, like how drag queens talk, all airy and fake. It was equal to the purity of tone that choir boys can achieve before their voices break. Now imagine an oboe singing sad heartfelt songs. You can forgive the oboe for it’s questionable taste in attire and resemblance to a deadpan comedian.  M.Ward was wonderful. His haunted songs made me think of abandoned performance halls… of ghostly loves and a time before I was born. His voice is deep, froggy, and echo-y giving him a maturity and wisdom that belies his youth. His songs had elements of jazz and blues and country all tied into brief, achingly pretty melodies. He reminded me of older-Billie Holiday in several ways: his phrasing is influenced by jazz vocals, but also his voice is roughened yet sweet like Lady Day’s became in the 1940s. If Tom Waits cleared his throat a couple times, this is what it would sound like mixed in with a little bit of Louis Armstrong’s craggy yet rich tone. In addition to Billie Holiday, Abby thought he also sounded like Leon Redbone and Nina Simone. M.Ward is a great musician. He sang a beautiful song that I didn’t even realize was a cover until I recognized these words: “And if you say run/ I’ll run with you”  It was a cover of Bowie’s “Let’s Dance” rendered sentimental and plaintive rather than imperative and bossy. Though M.Ward doesn’t talk much between songs, he cast a spell over the crowd that night with his quiet beautiful songs. Abby and I stayed til the very end.  Also, what does the “M.” stand for? I guessed he shortened it to M. because his real name is Montgomery and he didn’t want to be confused with the department store. Someone else said it was Matt.

       Friday Fashion News   From the Catwalks of Emeryville CA   Hi Everyone, this is Batty Apple reporting to you onsite from the catwalks of Emeryville CA. From my outpost at reception I am watching through the glass window and I can see the first model outside... She is wearing a white tank top and bright blue adidas-type shorts. She is a leathery woman of about 40 years and she is running with THE fashion accessory of mid-summer: a slobbery golden retriever. (5 minutes pass... 5 minutes of dead air, while Batty scans the various parking lots for more models.) Ok! Hi folks, I'm back. Two more models have appeared, a couple... They're dressed alike. Looks like the outfit  de rigeur  these days for a jaunt to the electronic goods store is khaki pants and a plain cotton t-shirt. (10 more minutes pass while no one passes by outside.) Ok! And back to you Anchor Batty!  Anchor Batty (in the studio):  Dude, Onsite Batty, don't ever do this feature ever again. There's a reason Emeryville CA isn't on the fashion map. Just look at the companies around you: Chiron, Siebel Systems, Sybase. You're surrounded by corporate casual!   Onsite Batty: I know, I know. But I think there's potential in Emeryville. I mean, look at the history... indian burial ground, then toxic dump, then breeding ground for corporations, cheap furniture, and national chain bookstores. You figure, what'll be next, right? Right?! And of course, the answer is hotbed of cutting edge fashion! Haute couture!  Anchor Batty: You MORON! Get back to the studio this instant! I'm scheduling a meeting in exactly one hour!  (1 hour passes. Setting: meeting room at twobadapples studio.)  Anchor Batty: I have scheduled this meeting to discuss your future with this corporation. You have made an embarrassment of us with your insipid feature "From the Catwalks of Emeryville CA". I want to touch base with you on that issue and resolve things before they spiral out of control. I would also like to say again "touch base" and add "let me know" and "we'll be in touch" and "thanks in advance." (Anchor batty raps on the table twice quickly to emphasize her point and signal that she's done talking.)  Onsite Batty: What? What the hell are you talking about?  HR Batty: (talking in a soft non-threatening voice) Do you understand what Anchor Batty has expressed, Onsite Batty?  Onsite Batty: No! She's talking in corpo-speak! I have to stop this madness. (Takes off hot pink pointed flat and holds it at Anchor Batty.) Get Thee Back, Corpo-Batty-Satan!   Anchor Batty: No!!! Too fashionable! Too trendy! My eyes! My eyes! Take it away! The shoe! The shoe...(Anchor Batty perishes in a cloud of beige and muted khaki.)   HR Batty: (says calmly in even tone) Well, from the looks of things, the issue has been resolved. Good luck on your continued employment with this company. (She gets up, excuses herself, and leaves the meeting room.)  Onsite Batty: (holds invisible microphone to mouth and announces to no one in particular) Fashion triumphs again! Tune in next week for another episode of "Friday Fashion News, From the Catwalks of Emeryville CA"!!  (Technical Support Batty passes by the open door, and shakes her head in amused pity. She is amused because she thinks Onsite Batty looks like a clown. Onsite Batty looks like a clown because she is only wearing one shoe.)

      Update - meeting with HR went really well despite my foul smell. The room was freeezing, which made me shiver like a retard & made my nipples poke out, but I managed to articulate my unhappiness about the job and especially about the boss. It looks like I may be switching groups within the next few months. Yipee!! Still have to decide what sort of work I want to make into a career, but have some time for that. In addition, bonded with another unhappy camper in my group about our boss and feel much better knowing that it's not just me.  Lessons Learned Today: 1)Ignore mom and her peasant, appeasing ways and go for the gold. 2)Be nice to mom at the same time in case I get canned over causing drama and need a place to live. 3)Take only express busses in the morning.

       The Man is Keepin Me Down  I smell like a homeless person today and I can't figure out why. WHY??!?!?! I will breathe through my mouth now.  My boss emailed me an extremely condescending email this morning about how I should not think about getting promoted any time soon, that it will happen "some day. Trust me.”  Fat Bitch! There are about 5 different sentences in the email that are not only offensive, but also plain mean, and I'm requesting a meeting with HR to go over my options (i.e. transferring into another group). Shit, what if HR ask to meet today and smell me and decide that I'm too dirty to be promoted? Oh lord, why me? Why?? AND!! I told my mom about the email and she said "Just listen to your boss. One day you will be boss. Others listen to you." Don't give me this immigrant bullshit, mom! What happened to fighting for what you believe in? I'm so watching Rocky IV tonight to pump myself up and then composing a polite yet resolute retort to my boss's email which I then may or may not send.  Damn, there’s the smell again! I don't have shit on my shoes and my hair is clean. It must be the non-express bus I took this morning. I think I contracted the smell of the dirty hobo that was sitting behind me. Gross.

       En Français  I have my french class tonight and I'm a little hesitant to go in. See, last time after class a group of us went out drinking in the Mission and after a few beers and a lot of getting-to-know-each-other, I said some things that might have been misconstrued by my lovely fellow classmates. There was something about me getting horny during the final exam season in college and also something about my dog licking my mouth and accidentally tongue kissing me. I don't remember the context exactly and hope they don't either. A few of them said some questionable things also, which I will have to recall in case they use my dog story against me.   In other news, my hair has passed the 'short' point into 'medium'. This is the longest I have gone without cutting it (myself or by a coiffant). I am determined to grow it long and noone can stop me.   One of my brother's letters to the editor was published in a major Bay Area newspaper. He's pissed because they cut out all the funny commentary and made him sound like a total bore. He won't tell me how many other letters he has written.   Batty forwarded me a link for this personality test. Although I don't necessarily like my assessment, I must admit it's accurate (except for having learned to channel my energies into improving my intellect):   urlLink Personality Quiz Link   And here's what I got:  You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.

       urlLink Auf der Maur  @ Slim's 07-02-04   Originally, I was gonna see this show alone, but at the last minute Abby and her friend Ira decided to come too. We ate nachos through Boyjazz and tried to guess what the singer's day job was. He was in his 30s, beer-paunchy, needed a haircut, and was wearing a tank top. I guessed "construction worker" while Ira and Abby bet on "Home Depot cashier" because as Ira reasoned, "He can't be in construction because look at his arms." (His arms were the opposite of muscular.) I asked Abby, "Where do you think they're from?" with my own answer already prepared (Sacramento) and she replied, "Stockton."   If I was alone, Boyjazz would've been painful. I would've again cursed myself for putting myself through another round of opening band torture. Luckily, friends and nachos can combat these ill effects.  The Husbands were great. They always put on a good show. A good combination is to smile and growl-sing through your songs. This works. What also works is a missing tooth. It's inconsequential if it's actually missing or just blacked out. In the modern-day frenzy of teeth whitening and invisalign, there's something horrifically charming about a missing tooth.   Auf der Maur were pretty good. I'd seen Melissa play in Hole in 1994(?) and I'd always been intrigued by her. She was the beautiful serene bassist who'd provide gentle back-up coos while Courtney Love drew everyone's fascination with her mess and sneering and attention-starved antics. With Melissa fronting Auf der Maur, I anticipated the second coming of Hole, but with more focus and a cleaner tighter sound. The primary guitarist used to be in this hard rock SF band, Stone Fox, which was around when I was in high school. She still rocks. Rounding out the band was a 2nd guitarist and a drummer, both dudes who rocked. The talent was there and the band was amazing, but I just didn't really like their music. They can really play and they're great live, but none of the songs were arresting. The one song I really liked was, ironically, the least rockin. She sang a slow pretty song for the encore accompanied only by her bass. Melissa is still the most babelicious lady in rock and roll, though. Too bad her music doesn't match the intensity of her performance.  Noteworthy: The drumkit was protected by a plastic shield which I dubbed "the sneezeguard." It was probably there for acoustic reasons, but I will safely assume that it also protected the drummer against germs.

       ***  Managed to clean my room a bit this weekend. I would say I'm about half-way done. I could always be extra anal and alphabetize books and organize dresses by color like I originally planned, but I don't think that's really necessary anymore. Other than that, didn't do anything productive this weekend, which was the plan. Saw Spiderman, caught a show at Slim's with Batty & Ira, went to BBQs, drove a lot, visited my ex-boss lady, ate noodles with Marcus and peach cobbler with Gwen, read, watched cable, played with my dog.

      On Wednesday night, my system crashed. My well-being took a dive and I blubbered on the phone to XX about nothing. I felt really frustrated and sad though I didn't know why. Perhaps it's because it's "that time of the month", or maybe it's because work is banal, or maybe because I'm a half-orphan now. He kept saying, "Tell me what's wrong" but I couldn't pinpoint it to specific reasons. I just felt bogged down by an inchoate cloud of sadness. So we talked for a while and then I drove to Cala Foods to buy ingredients for a carrot cake.   I stayed up late baking birthday carrot cakes with hippie ingredients: whole wheat flour, unbleached all-purpose flour, turbinado (raw) sugar, and frosting with no "beet sugar". (Yes, I'm secretly a hippie.) I slept a little and woke up at the crack of dawn to frost them and arrange walnut pieces into "flowers". I piped onto one "Happy Birthday Green Marble" and onto the other, "Happy Birthday XX." Baking is fun! Baking dispels clouds of sadness! The smell of cinnamon and vanilla turns sad clouds into carrot cake clouds!  Unrelated: lately, I've been in love with pugs. Pug dogs and pug puppies. I saw one last week and I wanted to dognap it because it was so cute. Now, normally I'm an animal hater and think they should all be caged, but now I will make an exception for the pug. I proclaimed my love for the pug to XX and he said, "Your biological clock must be ticking because my ex wanted a pug, then she started talking about having kids." And I said sarcastically, "That's a great generalization to make based on one person." What an idiot. Who said anything about wanting kids? Human kids are stinky and have chocolate smeared all over their faces and grimy hands. I stated calmly, "I want a pug. On my own. I don't want the pug to have a stinkin father-figure. If I ever get this pug, I'm going to the pug bank and getting it by myself." I told him all this because it's true. I ain't sharin my pug with no one! Except maybe Abby... and Green Marble... and Jason... and my family... and all my friends... and the homeless guy on the street.   If I ever have a pug this is the name I will christen it: Sir Petrus Bartholomew Maximilliam, III.  I will call him PB Max for short. Or Barky.

       ARGHx3  Also, I feel guilty for using the deaths for hating my job, but in the wake of all this dying, I feel like my life is stupid. And the stupidest part are these grey cubes and all this database entry and filing of all these papers. I hate paper.

       ARGH  Our network is down today and thus, tensions are high. The new opiate of the working masses isn’t religion or television; it’s the internet. Without a fast-speed connection to counter mind-numbing life-wasting work, we are left with the stark reality that work, in its simplest form, sucks. And not only does it suck, it fucking sucks.  Without a constant dose of celebrity gossip, I feel anxious and hostile. Especially towards this prick on the 2nd floor. Normally he just bugs me and I open  urlLink Daily Dish  to calm down, but today my hostility is untempered and I want to kill him. His name is Dick. That’s his actual name. Actually he goes by his full name, but in my head, he’s a Dick. He’s a condescending asshole that I want Monique from the WB to slap the shit out of. I’m not good at slapping people because I have feeble arms, but if Monique from the WB came by to give him a good slapdown, I’d stand on his desk, moon him, and send a big fat poot towards his face. I feel immense hostility towards this dildo-assbrain because he was talking to me about something or other and I mentioned that I don’t drive a car and he gay-drawls most snottily, “Ohhhhh… that explains a LOT.” Fuckin assface poobag! Kiss my ass! POOT! POOT! Oh, I’m sorry, did I do that?  It’s all in his condescending prickmiser tone and his beady judgmental eyes. I like most people, but this assfucker deserves no sympathy.  Speaking of pooting, I’ve been pondering within my head, Who the heck told us to hold in our poots in polite society? This causes debilitating stomach pains and the unnecessary exercise of the gluteus maximus. But today I understood why. I was washing my bowl in the staff room when I heard a squeak emit from the person getting coffee. I thought, Oh it’s just his shoe squeaking the linoleum cuz who the heck would let out a poot in polite staff room society? But then I stepped over to check the coffee selection and there was a most foul odor lingering in the air. It was a POOT! I swear it was a rank poot! Fucker. I quickly moved aside to show the offender I was most displeasured by his foul emission and appalled by his impolite act. And by “quickly moved aside” I really mean: walked slowly back to the sink and avoided eye contact.  So the reason why it’s polite to hold in your gas is because it fuckin stinks. Have you ever been to a show? I have, and obscured by loud loud music and the cramped crowd, people think they can just poot freely. You stand there, and all of a sudden it smells like farts. You didn’t hear it so there was no air raid warning to flee; there’s all these people around you so you don’t know who to slap down; and it's really packed so it's hard to get away. And suppose you do get away, then everyone will think you're the culprit fleeing the scene.  Today is Green Marble’s birthday eve, and also XX’s. They were born on the same day, different year. Another notable born on August 5: Beastie Boy  urlLink MCA  who turns 40 this year. Happy Birthday Eve everyone! Tonight I will be w/rapping presents.

       Unprepared  I'm listening to Adam Green and trying to relax myself in preparation for the interview, which , it turns out, can happen at 9 am or 2 pm or any time this week. Last night, instead of reading all of the prep materials my co-workers generously lent me, I did yoga with Green Marble. Poise, people, POISE! said the creepy man on the TV as I fell out of balance over and over again. Despite not getting the yoga thing right, my posture feels strangely better today. Although it does not increase my knowledge of the California planning process. Attempts to read about it on the bus this morning led to a nice nap. Hopefully the director will take notice of the fact that I brushed my hair this morning and removed lint from my sweater. I hope the interview happens today - I don't think I can keep this up.

       Deaf   I'm hard of hearing. Usually I mishear things, but it's actually entertaining because the world becomes filled with potty-mouthed trash-talkers. Or, I'm just lightly amused. Yesterday was the latter.  At the bar with W-gal and R-guy ...  R-guy: I want a Fanta Root Beer. Me: Did you say you want a Fanta Root Beer? R-guy: FAT TIRE BEER.  Ahahahha. Today I misread "Come Hither stare" as "Come Hitler stare".

      Woo hoo!!! The Director of urban planning wants to interview me. Tomorrow. I think it's the nerdling glasses I decided to wear today that changed his mind. Everyone keeps commenting on them. And my Dorothy shoes with band-aids poking out. Dear god, please don't let me fuck this up or have a panic attack.

       Weekend  This weekend was a little depressing. My brother left and I didn't think I would care but turns out I do miss the little bastard. On the way to the airport at 6:30 on Saturday morning we were cracking jokes (mostly about my hair) like we always do and then later that day I dialed his number to see if he wanted to go look for a Dreamweaver book with me and before I heard the ring I realized that he can't because he's in NY. At least I don't care as much as mom - I went to visit Oscar yesterday and we walked into G's room and she pretty much broke down. I was like "What the fuck Natali! Stop that shit." And she said "Oh, you don't understand anything. I couldn't walk into your room for two months after you left for Japan". And I realized oh lordy, I better visit them often so that she doesn't got crazy.  On the bright side, went to a much anticipated brunch at Kate's Kitchen with my favorite peeps and bought some brown sparkly Dorothy-type shoes at Shoe Biz on Sunday. I'm wearing them today and they hurt like hell. The little sparklies keep rubbing against my foot until I bleed, but what the hey. Maybe I can wear them as other types of accessories, like pins or ends of a scarf or something.  This day is promising to be laaaame (a random man in the elevator told me this this morning) but at least I found interesting jobs to apply for and my little radio gets decent reception. Carry on, gentle readers, and I will too.  (P.S. The receptionist just laughed out loud at my funny walk (due to shoe pain) and offered band-aids, which I gladly accepted.)
