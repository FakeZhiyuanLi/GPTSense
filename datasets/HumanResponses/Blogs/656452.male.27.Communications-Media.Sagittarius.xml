      Today I feel like I've been hit by a bus. The combination of yesterday's news and the drugs from the dentist ensured that I feel drained today.  But on the plus side, at least the tooth is a lot better.  In other news, I discovered that my student debts will finally be paid off by October 4 this year - hurrah!

      Not exactly the way I had expected to start off this blog, but life never goes the way you expect it to…..  I've been stuck at home all day nursing a sore tooth. Last night while attending a press dinner, I was suddenly struck with the most incredible pain. This continued all night. This morning I managed to get an emergency appointment at the dentists, and an x-ray revealed an abscess. Much drilling, cleaning and a root canal later it’s all fixed, but the anaesthetic has not worn off yet so I can't speak properly – it’s rather amusing to watch as I try and drink and spill half of it back out of my mouth.  Anyway – back to the point of today’s entry. I received the phone call today I was dreading, my very god friend Lynne has passed away, after suffering a brain haemorrhage while in Ireland on business. Lynne was someone I have known for nearly 10 years. We met at an exhibition, where she was working with Psion on a new modem launch. When I joined VNU in 1998 we began to work together a lot, as many of her corporate PR clients fitted the areas I like to write about (storage, telecoms, networking).  Work aside, we became good mates, and I consider Lynne to be among my closest friends. I’m really going to miss her. But right now my thoughts are not with me, they are with Lynne’s family, in particular her children – we’re all going to have to pull together to help them through this very sad time.

      .....My passport that is!  After 5 years of International Playboy-like jet-setting across the world, my US visa finally ran out just before Christmas. As a journalist, I need a visa in order to go and cover events across the pond, as as our redneck, gun toting friends in the former colony have a paranoid fear of anyone who is 1) Not American, 2) A Journalist, and 3) Has ever visited a country with Arabic-looking writing (yep - I went to Morocco on holiday once), I was expecting to either not get a renewal or have to jump through hoops to get it.  Well it got it, and in record time - just over a week :)  This good news as it means I am now free to travel again. Roll on March 14th - Viva Las Vegas baby!

      After three weeks of withdrawal symptoms since the journalist Blackberry trial ended, my new Blackberry device has finally turned up.  After deciding that a Pocket PC-based PDA with mini-keyboard, combined with bluetooth card and bluetooth mobile phone simply wasn't going to cut it, I splashed out £56 on a Blackberry of my own. I went for the  urlLink Blackberry 6230  connected to  urlLink One2One  (Yes - I know that they are called T-Mobile now, but that's a crap name - One2One was a much better branding name, and its colour scheme wasn't pink FFS).  Anyway - got it just in time before they axed their launch tariff - 100MB data transfer a month for £13.50 inc VAT. From yesterday it went down to 512k for £17.50 for all new customers.  Service is good, you can poll 10 POP3/IMAP/Hotmail accounts with a single device, though sadly One2One's coverage in my office is still as weak as when I used to have my mobile with them (and that was 5 and a half years ago!). that said, it's coping. Thankfully I have a desk with a window!  It compares well with my old Blackberry - bigger keys, more solid construction - though the screen is only 2/3 the size. A shame but something I can learn to cope with I guess. That's really the only gripe I've got with it to be honest.  I had been advised by the people I bought it from that O2 were launching a 100MB deal for £15 in Feb, with free hardware. This was very tempting as I had been on O2 for the trial, and the free hardware was likely to be the  urlLink Blackberry 5820 , which is the device I had for the first year of the trial. Full-size screen, very light, excellent solid keyboard (albeit with smaller keys), none of the phone feature crap. However it is only dual-band and has half the memory.  O2 also seem to have a good approach to roaming. Instead of charging you by the K for roaming, they opted for an all-you-can-eat daily charge - or at least that is how I'm reading it. T-Mobile charge 1p per K for overseas roaming, which isn't so bad.  Anyway - its all relative now as I am signed into T-Mobile for the next 12 months.  In short - BLACKBERRY'S ROCK!

          Sheffield Wednesday 1-3 Queens Park Rangers   We're back in Division 1 after two lowly, miserable years in Division 2, which have seen us lurch in and out of administration, and frequently having to hand the begging bowl around the fans in order to sign players and pay wages.  We can only hope that this is the start of the eventual rehabilitation of our beloved team, and that one day in the not too distant future, we can think about retaking our rightful place back in the Premier League.  Well done to Ian Holloway and the team - you've done us proud!  But most important - you've spared us the indignity of having to go to Cardiff for a play-off final again! :)

      Well, after several months of trying to come to terms with Livejournal, I've given up and decided to move things over here to Blogger.com.  I actually looked at using Blogger long before I set up my account with Livejournal, but decided that it was too limiting. However since those nice pople at Google bought it, they've been beavering away in the  background on some major changes to the interface and selection of default templates (essential for someone like me who cannot design a template for toffee).  Anyway - new blog, same old address:  urlLink http://blog.chrisgreen.co.uk   I also have an ATOM feed, which I am informed is a bit like an RSS feed, only different. Anyway, if you want to have a play at dragging it into a newsreader or dashboard, you'll find the feed here:  urlLink http://chrisgreen.blogspot.com/atom.xml   Enjoy!

      Thought you might. Looks like I'm going to set up home here on blogger.com for a while. So for all you people looking for RSS feeds, who cannot handle ATOM feeds, try this link:  http://feeds.feedburner.com/chrisgreen  It should give you an RSS compatible version of my blog - apparently!

      Well summer has finally kicked in, and with a vengence this year!  Anyway - it has come to my attention that I'm kinda letting this blog thing drift away, which is partly down to the fact that I'm undecided about going with  urlLink Blogger  or  urlLink Livejournal . Oh if only it was simple to create custom pages for Livejournal :(  On the plus side, I settled on one thing - I've got my photoblog service set up, and will be posting to it as of Wednesday, once I get my new Sony Ericsson T610 camera phone, and charge the thing up.  You'll find the photoblog at:  urlLink http://moblg.net/blog/chrisgreen
