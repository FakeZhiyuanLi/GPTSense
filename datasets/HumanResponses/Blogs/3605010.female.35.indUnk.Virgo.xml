      You know something is wrong in a relationship/friendship when you feel like you can do absolutely nothing right.  When you used to talk all the time and now you have nothing to say to each other.  When you even feel bad for thanking them for your support.  When you don't look forward to seeing them anymore.  When you feel anxious and bad when you don't see them.  When you start to believe that YOU are the bad person.  When you do just about everything you can to make something good and it still isn't enough.

      So I am off "sick" this week.  Not sure I really want to go back to work but suppose I have to.  I still haven't gotten the kind of motivation I was hoping for by being off from work, but I suppose I have to put more effort into that.  I have been "ok" the last couple of days but I woke up this morning to thoughts that didn't make me feel very happy.  I just never know if I'm doing the right thing or not.  I have words ringing in my ear and in my head that aren't very nice.  Words said to me by someone who supposedly cares about me.  Well, he does care, but perhaps in a different way than I am used to.  I have to be patient, but more importantly I have to be true to myself.  Guess what?  The same advise he gave me about B is about to work on himself.  I believe the words were "Just finish it."  Not a threat, just a warning.  While I enjoy very much the friendship and spending time with this person, sometimes I have the feeling that I am just second-choice and/or that I am being used, since I also happen to make this person feel pretty good.  On the other hand, I could stop thinking in this manner and turn it around a bit.  Just because I don't exactly get MY way doesn't mean it's a bad thing.  In fact, it's a good thing.  Something I need to learn and am willing to learn on most days.  Some days I just feel insecure and shitty and I take things the wrong way.  I have to figure the process to let go.  So that's what I'm doing now.  Maybe letting go doesn't mean that we have nothing left, maybe it just means that I can trust and relax a bit more.    The thing I worry about the most:  our friendship.  I think it's more painful to think of losing him as a friend than just about anything I can think of.   In other news:  My ankle is not broken.  I went to the doctor on Monday not only about my depression but also to double check that things were healing all right with my foot.  Doctor Drugs sent me to get an x-ray and there is a bit of damage to the ligaments but otherwise I'm fine.  So he wrapped me up today and sent me on my merry way.  Am still having trouble getting motivated to do things.  Think I will do something soon, but just need a few more minutes to build up to it.

       You just can’t believe me When I show you what you mean to me You just can’t believe me When I show you what you cannot see  You’re hiding from feelings, searching for more Sharing and hoping, untouched for so long Our lives still change from the way that we were And now I’ll tell you something I think you should know You just can’t believe me When I show you what you mean to me You just can’t believe me When I show you what you cannot see  You cause me confusion, you told me you cared He’s calling these changes that last to the end Ask me no questions, I’ll tell you no lies The past is your present, the future is mine You just can’t believe me When I show you what you mean to me You just can’t believe me When I show you what you cannot see  You tell me you need me, I’ll make it this time The thread won’t divide us, the sensation survives I was sure that I told you it was good from the face You’ve caused me some problems, you’ve taken my place  Why can’t you see what you mean to me?    You are confusing the hell out of me.

      I've been listening to Garbage lately.  I like Shirley Manson.  She's a very cool rock chick.  Something about rock chicks that gets my blood boiling.  Like Joan Jett.  MEOW!!  She is just gorgeous.  I'm sure I kind of look like her.  Anyway, I really like this song from 2.0.  I think I could apply it to someone, somewhere.   I was angry when I met you  I think I'm angry still  We can try to talk it over  If you say you'll help me out   Don't worry baby (don't worry baby)  No need to fight  Don't worry baby (don't worry baby)  We'll be alright   This is the noise that keeps me awake  My head explodes and my body aches  Push it (make the beats go harder)  Push it (make the beats go harder)   I'm sorry that I hurt you  Please don't ask me why  I want to see you happy  I want to see you shine   Don't worry baby (don't worry baby)  Don't be uptight  Don't worry baby (don't worry baby)  We'll stay up all night   This is the noise that keeps me awake  My head explodes and my body aches  Push it (make the beats go harder)  Push it (make the beats go harder)   Come on push it you can do it Come on prove it nothing to it Come on use it let's get through it Come on push it you can do it  Don't worry baby (don't worry baby)  Don't be uptight  Don't worry baby (don't worry baby)  We'll stay up all night   This is the noise that keeps me awake  My head explodes and my body aches  Push it (make the beats go harder)  Push it (make the beats go harder)   This is the noise that keeps me awake  My head explodes and my body aches  Push it (make the beats go harder)  Push it (make the beats go harder)   This is the noise that keeps me awake  My head explodes and my body aches  Push it (make the beats go harder)  Push it (make the beats go harder)   Don't worry baby We'll be alright  Don't worry baby We'll be alright    Actually, this is a pretty fucking appropriate song at the moment.     On another note: Am I the only one in the world who thinks Stevie Ray Vaughn is *not* all that?  I mean, all the songs sound the same.  I think it's a real bummer that he died so young, etc., but, please.

      B is attempting to fight with me again over our financial solutions within our impending divorce.  I would like to know just what the fuck *I* am supposed to do.  I'm so sorry that life in the UK is "bloody expensive" but that is not my problem.  I have my own problems.  You could have thought about all of these things, done a little homework and gone into it the right way, but you didn't.  Don't push it on me now.  I wish I was strong enough to handle this, but it just spoils my day.    On a good note:  It's already 1pm and I have food in the fridge, good, healthy food even, so I'm going to go and eat it.  Best to binge on healthy stuff, right?

      I went to the doctor this morning.  I like how you can go to 'inloopspreekuur' from 8 - 8.30 and just pop in to see the guy without making an appot.  I would like it even more if the doctor wouldn't walk in at 8.10 with 7 people waiting to see him. And why is it called 'spreekuur' when it's only a 'halfuur'?  I *finally* had my turn at 8.55.  Glad I (very carefully) sprung out of bed this morning to be there right on time.  He said it's ok, just incredibly swollen and bruised.  Gave me some cream to help in and some anti-inflammatory pills.  I asked him about my finger while I was there because it looks and feels weird.  He said there is definitely something wrong with it, but we just have to wait it out.  Perhaps still a small piece of glass or something.  He said it's better to wait and the pills should help my finger as well.  Otherwise he will have to cut my finger open to solve the problem.  No thanks.  So here I am at work.  Sigh.    Last night I went home after work, didn't bother to cook dinner and then put some ice on my ankle and sat down to watch Ellen (re-runs ~ better than football) and appropriately fell asleep.  Watched some other crap television and ~ even better ~ the Crap Tuesday Night Feature Film on RTL5 was 'Striptease'.  Go, Demi!    Luckily R saved me.  He phoned me and we had some shit-chat for about 1.5 hours.  Was nice.  I like talking to him and it's much better than watching Demi only halfway get her kit off.    He's coming over tonight.  Which is good since I'm cancelling the RHCP(can't stand on my ankle/foot too long) and my therapist (no dosh).  I'm glad, I usually always feel good when I see him.

      Foot is pretty swollen. So is the ankle.  Going to have to go to the doctor.   Went to R's yesterday. Was very nice.  We went to Subway (Yay! Subway!  It's the little things in life) then his place, watched a movie, drank a bottle of wine.  I hardly slept.  It was hot, too hot.  I actually managed to get up on time (5.30 in the godforsaken morning), get to the train on time (thanks R), get all my connections and my bike was still at Central Station.    Then I worked my arse off until about 3.30 (with a break for lunch ~ HR told me I should start taking my breaks) and now I'm exhausted.  Cancelled on Gwenn & Beth for drinks tonight.  Ankle is too sore and I'm tired.  Probably *not* going to the Red Hot Chili Peppers tomorrow either, in Amsterdam.  Can't stand on this foot for 2 hours or more.  I think I may have to be pretty flexible and not plan anything for a while, just in case.  Well, I didn't want to make many plans did I?  I had a dream with Amber in it yesterday.  Must be because I've been thinking about her and posting comments in her blog.  Also had another weird dream about being picked on, but I think it's just 'cos we watched The Shining last night.  Going to hobble home now.  Hopefully I won't kill anyone with my Big Foot.

      Ah Monday...  When we have a brand new chance to start the working week out right, make all the right decisions, get along with colleagues, do all the things at home you have on your list, don't stay up too late, don't drink too much, eat properly, exercise etc.  Monday is the day we all start a new diet.  Monday is the day we all believe we are going to get our shit together at work.  Monday is the day you think "Now it's all going to go better."  Well, actually this Monday I planned on being at work for 7.30.  That's not going to happen now and there is a few reasons.  For one, I'm writing this at 7.13.  For two, I'm pretty sore from my fall Saturday so I know it will take me a bit longer to get to work.  I did actually get up at 6 am, which I think is pretty impressive.  I did some laundry actually.  I ate breakfast.  These are positive things.  OK not to have a bad attitude or anything but fuck work.  I need to take care of myself.  Goals for the week: Let the man make the plans Exercise Try not to make too many plans after work Get enough sleep  Not in any particular order of course.  Well, Happy Monday.  Now I better get my arse in gear.

      I was just reading through a few random blogs and I thought to myself "Wow, everyone else is as insane as I am."  If you are really wacky, you know... crazy and funny and a little bit "out there", that's cool, but if you are the wacky type that cross-stitches and makes blinkies and digs (s)crapbooking, that's not cool.  That's OK though, because what it means... in this whole big bad world... is that we are UNIFIED by wackiness.  OK.  I'm sure this sounds like I have just gotten back from a "coffee shop".  I swear to Buddha, I haven't.

      Well, this has been an interesting and dynamic weekend in an interesting and dynamic period of my life and I've got the bruises to prove it.  I'm almost positive now that I shouldn't do anything anymore.  I should not go out, because it's too dangerous.  I'm actually surprised I'm still alive with the types of accidents that have been happening.  After a bit of a psychotic scuffle on Friday (use your own imagination here... kicking ass and taking names... I'm sure I look pretty damn cool doing that, yeah...), I managed to nearly kill myself last night at a club, by dancing on the bar and then appropriately falling off of it within minutes.  And, no, I wasn't even drunk.  Those two events added to the slicing of my finger 3 weeks ago and ripping my elbow to shreds last week after climbing on the kitchen counter to reach something (I jumped off, my my elbow was gravitationally pulled towards the edge of the counter), I am officially a walking disaster.  A Demolition Man.  Uh, woman.  Something different: I wanted to go out today after my plans made yesterday afternoon (for today) were cancelled and thought I would go to the cinema.  Of course when you are desperate to go out and "be normal" by just doing something nice and going to see a film, there's not a fucking thing on at the moment that I want to see.  Perhaps the universe is telling me to clean my house instead.  However, I wasn't able to rent that bulldozer I wanted to get to clear this shit out.  And I used to be so organised.  Guess I'm just going to have to face reality instead.  Or maybe not.  Maybe I'll just go to bed.  Or maybe I'll do my dishes.  Let's first start with the dishes and then I'll move on to saving the children or world peace or something like that.  Hey. I can do whatever I want.  That's supposed to be a GOOD thing.

      I want to have a blog too.  I want to be with the popular group.  I want various random unknown and known people to have a piece of this Pink Pie.  My life is *so* interesting, why not? I want to have a place where I can cleverly describe the mundane and annoying aspects of my day to day life.  What better place than here? Surely I will win friends and influence people with all of the exciting things I have to say.  Or rather... maybe I will just salvage the friendships I have that I seem to have let drop by the wayside. Who knows?  Only time will tell.

      So I said the last couple of months has been good.  But actually, in reading my blog, things were fairly crap on the 25th of June.&nbsp; That means that things have been good since the weekend after until now.&nbsp; Oh well, one month, two months, what does it matter in the grand scheme of things?

      Things are going ok here.&nbsp; It's pretty amazing.  That is, if I only think about the good things and not the bad things, then I'm pretty satisfied.&nbsp; I am still somewhat avoiding my reality though but that's next on my list of things to do.  I went last Friday to Glasgow for V's Hen Party.&nbsp; We had a great time and I got to tag along to take care of a few wedding errands and actually was at her dress fitting.&nbsp; It's strange, being a very small part of a wedding and being very excited about my friend getting married, when I'm on the brink of my 2nd wedding anniversary and the divorce is already in the works.&nbsp; I didn't do too well at a wedding in May, but it seems I should be able to handle it more in a few weeks time.&nbsp; Saturday was the actual Hen Night, Monday morning we came back to Amsterdam.&nbsp;   It was the first weekend in quite a while that I didn't see the man at all, or even talk to him.&nbsp; We already knew we'd see each other on Tuesday, since we were going to see Dido in Cologne, but I sent him a message on Sunday asking him if he'd be interested in company on Monday evening instead of waiting one more day and his answer was yes.&nbsp; In fact, Monday was exactly 365 days since we met at party in DH. Of course we were just friends at first, so it's not like a real anniversary of dating or whatever, but it is a sort of anniversary so we were happy to celebrate it.  Tuesday we went to Cologne to see Dido (like I said already) and we had a really nice, relaxed time together.&nbsp; Got back to his place around 1 am and I think we stayed up until about 3 or 4 watching music videos, talking, etc.  Actually the last couple of months almost has been perfect.&nbsp; Too good to be true really.&nbsp; Sometimes I can't believe this is happening to me.&nbsp; If I think about it too much it seems very complicated, for both of us really, but on the other hand, even if the timing is wrong the people are right together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we're just taking things one day at a time.&nbsp; No one is rushing to move in together or to the altar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter will never happen.&nbsp; I'm not taking the chance of the 3rd time being a charm in the case of wedding vows.&nbsp;   I have quite a few things to do in the next few days.&nbsp; I'm organising V's hen here in DH so I need to get the reservations made and check out the Bar to see if I can reserve a few hours just for us.&nbsp; I also need to organise my financial overview for B so that we can get the process going.&nbsp; I need to figure out if I can go to San Diego/Las Vegas in September as well.&nbsp; I need to clean my house.&nbsp; I need a haircut.  And now, I need to work.

      It's been a while since I last wrote something.&nbsp; I have no idea where I left off or how I could possibly catch up on the last couple of weeks.  Let's see, maybe a summary: with B:&nbsp; initial plans/arrangements aren't going to happen.&nbsp; Have to come up with something else.&nbsp; Won't be able to remortgage.&nbsp; hopefully after March next year things will be more "normal" financially.  with R:&nbsp; things are going very well.&nbsp; we've been out together quite a few times and things were good.&nbsp; overall we get along very nicely, have a lot of laughs, talk a lot, etc.&nbsp; I'm very happy.  with work: crap as usual.&nbsp; I'm dealing with it.&nbsp; I went to the Arbo doctor though, to explain what exactly goes on here.&nbsp; i want them to know I'm serious about not taking rude colleagues with attitudes anymore.&nbsp; Pretty sure I'll start looking for another job October/November.  Otherwise: I am the temporary mother of R's kitten.&nbsp; He is terrorising Frankie and running around like crazy.&nbsp; The other night he attacked Frank and was piggybacking on him while Frank was running, trying to get rid of the kitten!  My (soon to be ex) sister in law had a baby.&nbsp; A boy.  The meds seem to be working.  T-Bone moved down the street from me.&nbsp; Sweet!  This weekend I'm going to Glasgow for V's Hen Night.&nbsp; Should be nice.&nbsp; Will go to the Eggy on Friday night and hang out with G as well.  I finally got my couches.&nbsp; I have already fallen asleep on the big one several times :)  Tonight I'm going to see Mean Girls with V and Steve.&nbsp; Girly flick with two of my favourite chicks.  That's all.&nbsp; I should attempt to write more often.

      So, everything is A-OK over here.  I had a bizarre week last week with a lot of mixed feelings, emotions, etc.  I felt not only depressed, sad, angry, lonely, etc., but apparently also paranoid.  I am officially on anti-depressants now.  Not overjoyed about that but I'm willing to try anything at this point.  Everything is going well with the man as well.  Amazing.  Work is... work.  I'm going to do my job, yes, but I'm not putting up with any bullshit.  That said, I'm not going to give them any bullshit either so I can't be blamed for a do as I say, not as I do policy.  I know I will be stronger by the end of the year and then I will start looking for a new job in 2005.  Once all the crap is sorted with B and I remortgage my apartment, etc., then it will be time for the next step.  So, that's it. Back from the Edge of Psycho.

      I know you didn't want me to be angry with you and I wasn't at first.  I think I was just stunned.  Now I'm angry.  You know why? Because I have done just about everything I can to give you some happiness in your life.  I accept that you are ill and I *try* not to be too affected by it.  I have supported you.  I accept that you have children from a previous relationship, and although I was not sure I *wanted* children of my own, I opened my arms to them.  You have been a good friend to me, but I'm trying to figure out if you still are.  When I met you I needed you, but I'm trying to figure out if I still need you.  I'm not so sure anymore.  When I am doing everything with all the best intentions and then you hurt me anyway.  I may have fucked up in certain situations, but do you want to continue punishing me?  Especially after I told you how special your kids are to me, because I have caused "problems" for you, now I am "not allowed" to come to you on the weekends you have your kids.  Nice.  Have you ever thought that maybe you make some of these problems into more than what they really are... you do that yourself?  Well. Enough is enough baby.  I'm not persuing you anymore.  You can psycho out on someone else.  In the end you get your way.  Alone. Angry.  Disappointed. Let down.   You bring it on yourself.

      To my dear, dear friend,  As much as I would hate to lose you I'm afraid we are coming closer and closer to the crossroads.  I know you aren't well and that you don't intentionally try to hurt me but I have the feeling that I am doing *everything* I can to make things good for you and for us and it's simply not enough.  For some reason, perhaps you have forgotten that I am human and far from perfect.   hu·man     urlLink      adj.  Of, relating to, or characteristic of humans: the course of human events; the human race.      Having or showing those positive aspects of nature and character regarded as distinguishing humans from other animals: an act of human kindness.       Subject to or indicative of the weaknesses, imperfections, and fragility associated with humans: a mistake that shows he's only human; human frailty.       Having the form of a human.      Made up of humans: formed a human bridge across the ice.          Perhaps you have also forgotten that YOU are human and not perfect either.  I do not criticise you for this, I accept you, your behaviour and very importantly your illness.    Once again we are 'starting over'.  We had more than a month of good times together, only to have something negative dropped in your mailbox from your neighbours which directly relates to me and you.  Somehow I have the feeling you blame me for this.  I do take responsibility, yes, but I am not to blame fully.  Since then you have found ways to be annoyed with me, some ways are pretty justifiable, others I'm not so sure about (but, hey, it's possible they are all justifiable, but being a bit stubborn it's not so easy to accept everything negative that you hear about yourself).  Your reactions to these situations are also somewhat justifiable, but others are way over the top.  Why will you punish me with not being able to see you when you have your kids?  You know that I like them very much, I enjoy being around them... yet, you are not willing to take the "risk" anymore that you will be annoyed with me...  so, just as I'm building a relationship with them, you take it away from me.  I am sitting here, trying very very hard to understand what went wrong and when and how I can fix it.  First you were in love with me.  Now you are not.  You wanted us to have less contact, less emails, less text messages, yet many times YOU are the one who calls, etc.  Once again you shut me out... you want to think about what you want...  you know you want stability... I'm not sure where you are going to get that when you are not totally stable yourself.  You know I want to give that to you, yet you push and push and push me away.  So, my dear friend, the one I will never ever forget, the one who made a huge impact on me in a very short period of time, you will always have a special place in my heart.  If you do happen to want something with me, it's time to play by more compromising rules.  Otherwise, I think we may have to say goodbye.  It's give and take.  I have bent over backwards and turned cartwheels for you.  Not because I had to, because I WANTED to.  You take it but you give back only sporadically.  I don't know what you want or what you expect from me.  It's better now that you figure it out and get on with your life.  In the meantime, I'm going to take care of my life.  Love Pinky
