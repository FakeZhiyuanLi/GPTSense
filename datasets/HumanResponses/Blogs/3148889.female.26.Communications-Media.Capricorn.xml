      My first post on my new weblog.  I started Fat Girl Films last month....well, I've had the production company for a number of months but I'm just starting to do something with it.  It has also undergone a few name changes as of late.  I finally decided on fat girl films because it's funny, cute and gets attention.....hmm, sounds just like me...exactly!    I'm working a couple of short film scripts which will go into production in the next few weeks.  I am very excited and extremely nervous about this.  I also purchased a new 12 in. PowerBook G4 with SuperDrive....You gotta mention the SuperDrive just to let folks know that you spent a little extra cash.  I would have loved to get the 15 in. but the pocketbook was already starting to feel the strain of the 12in but hell, you gotta have the SuperDrive.  I have great eye sight and I can easily hook this sucker up to a larger screen if need be.    I so love this little laptop.  I totally changed platforms.  I used to own a Dell Inspiron 2600.....really great computer but there was always a little something off about it, like it wasn't meant for me but this PowerBook is totally me and I plan to do great things with it.  My creative juices are really starting to flow and I'm starting to feel so confident about this new direction my life is taking.  I've always known that I was supposed to do something where I get to be creative.  I've tried singing, dancing, acting and even dabbled in graphic arts which I still love but this filmmaking thing is the cat's meow.....totally me.    I am also a writer.  I wrote a wonderful novel a couple of years back that I have yet to publish.  I will probably wind up doing self-publishing...it's more my speed.  I'm a writer from way back and I've always written poetry...got into short stories then finally got the courage to do the novel.  It took me approximately 6 months(3-4 days a week in the barnes and noble cafe).  I would go into the cafe, order a frappuccino or hot tea....sit in my little corner and get to writing.  Oh, it felt so good...I miss doing that....it was a great time in my life....that's kind of why I know I'm going in the right direction because I love to write, I love being bossy so I'm perfect for directing and producing....lol!  Anyway, I've yapped for long enough tonight....laters!

      I was in a yahoo group for filmmakers in Oklahoma but the bastard had too many rules and I am not one for conformity so I had to jet!  Perhaps, I'll start my own...hell, it can't be any worse....

      I was supposed to start filming on a documentary today but the subject of my documentary has decided to make other plans.  It totally sucks so I will have to reschedule her for next week but I also have another one for filming next sunday but that should be fairly easy.  It's just this little idea that popped into my head.  It's mostly improv with a few lines provided by moi.  It looks really funny on paper...hoping for that to translate onto film.  alrighty, got to get out and enjoy this day....laters!

      Not much going on today but I did happen to catch that cute Citi.com commercial with the little old lady dancing.  It cracks me up so much and more so because the old girl has got a little rhythm.  It's 4am.....I should be in bed but I'm going to watch 'View from the Top' starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Mike Myers and Christina Applegate among others....btw, why is mena suvari, kevin bacon and andie macdowell in 'Beautyshop' the new movie starring Queen Latifah?  Things that make you go hmmm?  laters!

      We're having a beautiful day in Oklahoma City.  The sun is out but it's Oklahoma City, the weather can change any minute.  It's early in the day and I've worked on two short film scripts.  I'm very excited.  I have two short films ready to shoot and a third almost ready....it'll be ready by Sunday afternoon.  According to Tech TV, friendster.com is so 5 minutes ago.....

      I just found out about the American Idol results....I can't believe that Jennifer Hudson got the boot!  Are people crazy?!  I'm not saying that she had the best performance of the night but she certainly did not have the worst one.....Will people please stop feeling sorry for John Stevens!  He's not improving....well, at least his hair is...lol!  He's a one-trick pony and that trick is played out!

      What a day!  I currently live in Oklahoma City and I had my first taste of tornadic weather.  I was so scared today.  We had hail ranging from your normal pea size to baseball size.  It was crazy.  A few tornadoes touched down but I wasn't a witness to any but I was very close to the center of the madness today....twice.   I saw collapsed carports....dented vehicles and hail that was two feet deep on some streets....so much hail that it looked like it had snowed.  The biggest news of the day....I got caught in the ice on one street and this guy helped to free me but the truck had so much momentum that it took off and I couldn't catch up as it jumped a curb and landed in someone's yard.....yes, it really happened.  Now my truck is stuck in someone's ice-covered front yard.  The strangest part was that no one was trying to help me.  People were just standing around watching me struggle with my truck.  Finally, one older gentleman came to help me....he recruited two other guys to push my truck as I put the sucker in reverse....All I have to say is......FREE, I'M FREE AT LAST....

      I just finished watching American Idol.  Fantasia killed it.  She was so awesome....she really took the concept of rearranging the song to suit yourself.  Everyone did a great job except for John Stevens.  He'll probably go tomorrow.  I know I said everyone did a great job but most of them were boring even Latoya's....Fantasia really woke me up and ended the night on a great note.  Paula Abdul was just as boring.  Simon was actually fairly tame.  Randy just gets on my nerves....."yo, dawg."  "what's up, dawg?".....he's way too old to be using that type of lingo plus it doesn't sound right coming out of him......No Mo Rocca dreams today....darn!

      I'm finally back.  I've been without my new laptop since last thursday.  The little bugger was acting up.  The keyboard was replaced and now all is well.  I had the strangest little dream about Mo Rocca today.  I had a dream that he broke into my apartment and decided to move in with me.  I don't think there was anything sexual about the incident although, I am a fan.  Just strange.  I finally bought a new camcorder.  I'm ready to get down to business.  I'll have my first short film done in the next few weeks.  I'm very excited.  Gotta jet. laters....

       MUSIC TOURS    I would appreciate it if music artists wouldn't bypass Oklahoma City.  I don't want to have to travel to Dallas, TX all the time to catch my favorite artists.  OKC has a huge local music scene......Big THANKS to The Strokes and Kid Rock for coming out and rocking OKC.  The Strokes took over our local rock station  urlLink The Buzz  with Strokes Radio playing all of their favorite tunes.....awesome!      A CHANGE    I can't begin to tell you how much I need a change.  I need a new hairstyle.  I kind of want to cut it all off.  Right now, it is shoulder length and VERY thick.....tres annoying in this climate!  I like wild out of control hair.  I gotta do something new.....FAST!  My current hair state does not reflect me.  I'm an artist and I need to have that artist look.....It's going to happen really soon, in like the next two weeks.  My hair used to be super short and bleach blonde...it was awesome and total freedom....I probably won't do anything that extreme but it's definitely going to be something awesome and totally me!  Oh yeah, I want to be a DJ.  New career, ahoy!

      I bought my mother an awesome ring for Mother's Day.  It's sterling silver(hey, i'm a poor black chick) with fresh water pearls and sapphires(all real baby!).  It's so gorgeous....she could just tell someone that it's platinum....it looks that awesome!  I'm also going to get her one of those giant greeting cards.    I kind of had a slight panic attack about an hour ago.....well, i'm still coming down off of it.....I NEED VALIUM!

      I just finished watching the Mary J. Blige DVD that came with my CD.  It's pretty good.  I have a lot of respect for that woman.  I actually wrote a poem about her a few years back that's on my  urlLink  personal site .  Her new CD 'Love and Life' is just awesome.  I didn't become a Mary fan until around 1996 when I heard her song 'Everything'.  I'm not a big R & B fan but I love real music and Mary makes real music.  My favorite song on her new album would have to be 'Don't Go'.

       General Wesley Clark   After watching the television show STAFFERS on  urlLink Discovery Times   and kind of getting to know some of the candidates about a month too late....I can honestly say that I would have voted for General Wesley Clark.  I just really liked the way he interacted with his staffers as well as the public.  I wish others had the chance to get to know this man.  I'm not saying I'm a democrat but General Clark really impressed me.

      Had some bad chicken today.....grrr!  Toilet, ahoy!  Tough Crowd and Chappelle's Show was hilarious tonight.  Bought my firewire on eBay for $6....yay!  Bought my USB cable for my printer at CompUSA for $23.....grrrr!  I should have bought it on eBay but I really needed it as I need to print some scripts tomorrow for an actor.  I have a beef with Mac.....why don't they have all of the drivers pre-installed like Windows XP....I feel like I'm Mac's mom....I have to tell it...."Well, Mac, you must go to a website and download the driver for what you would like to use."  Steve Jobs sucks at this moment for me.  I'm back in love with Bill Gates until Regis and Kelly come on...lol!

       Incoherent Ramble  Sean "P. Diddy" Combs is doing "A Raisin in the Sun" on Broadway.  That's very cool because hopefully it will open young african-americans to the wonderful world of Broadway.  P. Diddy really surprised me with his performance in "Made" with Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn as well as his bit part in "Monster's Ball".  I personally think that Halle Berry shouldn't have won the Oscar for that role....she sucks as an actress but for some reason people like her....go figure.  Anyway, back to the main topic...the critics are being way too hard on Mr. Combs.....this is his Broadway debut!  This guy comes from hip-hop....he auditioned twice and the producers thought that he would do an adequate job of playing the main character.....that's major.  My beef with critics is that they come in with preconceived notions.....I absolutely hate that.....that's kind of the reason why we still have racism in this world.  I've whined enough...gotta jet.....laters!

      I was just catching the tail end of Parkinson Starburst on BBC America.  Samuel L. Jackson and Robbie Coltrane(harry potter films; hagrid) were the guests along with some playwright.  The playwright made the comment that he's the fart between two huge buttocks.  He was, of course, referring to the guys being in two huge movies at the time Star Wars and Harry Potter.  I suck so much at trying to get these jokes across.....perhaps, i'll stop....

        ITALIAN SODA   I love getting italian sodas at the Barnes and Noble cafe but in Oklahoma City, they don't offer irish cream....wtf?!  It's ludicrous that you can't get an irish cream italian soda!  It's the best most refreshing drink ever.... with or without the whipped cream.....I settled for the vanilla italian soda which isn't nearly as good but still good.  The italian soda at Borders is pretty good but they don't put milk in the drink which takes away from the kind of import look of the drink.....

      I was watching the Comedy Central Bar Mitzvah earlier and Dane Cook was one of the performers.  I love that guy...he's awesome.  Anyway, in part of his bit he says he enjoys watching Justice Files because 1. He loves justice and 2. He likes files.  He loves it so much that he enjoys a justicey jizz....lol!  Hilarious!  I'm sure I just fucked up his great joke but if you laughed then I've done my job....  Btw, do any other black people in the world watch The Office on BBC America....oh yeah, I watched it before it became mainstream....suckers!

      I wish I had known my direction when I first left high school.  I thought I wanted to be a sociologist and I also attended a black college because I wanted that "black experience".  It didn't work....I was a fish out of water around my own people.  I still feel that way because my interests lie elsewhere.  Sure, I love hip-hop music but I'm a bigger fan of rock music.  I watched Comedy Central before it was cool for black people to watch it.  I love Frasier and I'm totally bummed that it's going off the air.  I watch Friends but I'm not really a fan....it never had an impact on me like frasier.  I love the Bernie Mac Show and Girlfriends....they are smart shows although some of Girlfriends' characters are a little over the top and the episodes of late are getting really cheesy.....it's like they have run out of ideas but Bernie's show is soooooo good!    Back to what I was originally talking about....I studied music(trumpet) in high school...left that because of a really tyrant of a band director.  I went into creative writing....this is where I really blossomed but I didn't get enough out of it because it was the only class they offered.  I didn't have anyone to nurture me after that class.  Sometimes, it's about what you can do for yourself and going to a black college.....you don't get that support.  Black people have the same preconceived notions as any other race but they lie more on the socioeconomic level.  I tried to fit in with my classmates but it didn't work and they took my kindness for weakness.  There's so many things I wish I could do over.  I wouldn't change much but I probably would have stayed in Texas to attend college...a predominately white college.  I hate that I feel this way but it's my own people who have made me the outsider.  I'll become a great independent filmmaker and never look back....ha!  The best line I've heard all year was on Chappelle's Show on Comedy Central when Wayne Brady says "Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch?"

      I am so PISSED OFF!  Apple iBook now comes with an optional SuperDrive on the 14 inch model. It will run about 1499 with the addition of the SuperDrive.  I just spent $2000 on a 12 inch PowerBook with SuperDrive......grrrr! If only I had waited two weeks....damn it to hell!  Btw, why is it that Apple doesn't hook you up with a word processor like a Windows computer.  I feel so cheated.  Paying all of this money and I don't even get the thing I need the most......I'm a freaking writer!  I had to purchase a word processor.  It works great but I am just disappointed.  They give you a test-drive of Office for Mac for 30 days then you have the option of buying it for nearly $400....the reason I left a Windows based computer was to get away from any Microsoft......

      Oklahoma was listed at 47 out of 51 states for being healthiest for women.  My former homestate of Texas was 46.  Minnesota was ranked #1.  No wonder, I've been plagued with allergies and such.  I have some filming to do tonight...that should go well....looking forward to finishing up so I can start editing....

      I just read that William Hung from American Idol is 31 years old....I totally thought that guy was like 21 or something.....Worst than that...the guy is still a virgin....I'm not really knocking him for that but his mother still accompanies him to media events...isn't that a little odd?  When I first saw Mr. Hung...I thought he was "special" because he has that "special" look...and there's also the way he dances and sings which might lead one to think that he was "special".  Anyway, I gotta jet....big things starting to happen in Oklahoma.....

      I wish people like Britney Spears and Janet Jackson would go away.  They add nothing to society as a whole.  Their music is lame for the most part.  I'm not going to lie and say I don't listen to a few tracks from each artist but I can't take them seriously like say a  Coldplay or Dave Matthews Band.  They are cancers on our society.  Most people would say that it's jealousy but why would I want to be known for lip-synching and showing my ass....Nah, that's not me...  Janet Jackson is way too old to still be acting like she's still 21 and Britney is just too damn wild.  I know young people are to get out and enjoy their 20s but she's just annoying to me(I'd like to read my US Weekly without reading a Britney article) and grown people act like they worship her.  Truth be known, if she didn't have that body she wouldn't be anyone....

      Is this the real  urlLink Brad Pitt ?  Scroll to the end of the page.    There was a high school graduation down the street from my place last night.  Made me reminisce about the hell of high school...kidding.....made me wish I could start all over.  I would make so many changes.  I wouldn't have gone to Grambling State University and wasted all that money and time.  I would have stayed in Texas, gotten a job while going to school.  Nah, now that I think about it, everything I've gone through was worth it.  All of the ups and downs and feeling like a clown.  I'm finally heading in the right direction.  Hell, who cares if it took me 8 years and loads of tries.  I'm getting there and a lot of people will know my name by year's end.

      It stings so much more to get rejected by a black man.  It seems like more and more black men just don't want anything to do with black women.  This concerns me greatly because I always thought that I would marry a black man.  I haven't really dated a black man since 2001....isn't that sad?  I don't mind dating white men but when the men of your own race don't want you, that's just more than one should have to take.  I'm not one of those ghetto girls and I don't have any children.  I work, I have my own vehicle, my own place and I'm somewhat of an entrepreneur.

      The  urlLink Pledge of Allegiance  controversy is ignorant.  I don't believe children should have to recite it.  I never did as a child but that's only because I hate conformity.  I like that it has "under God" in it but I'm not going to force some little kid to say something they don't believe in.  If you don't believe in God then that's something you'll have to deal with on judgment day.  Good luck on that to all non-believers!  I'm a christian and proud of it!

      Serena Williams lost today at Wimbledon because I overslept and missed the whole thing.    I was so pissed when I went on ESPN's website and read that she had been beaten.

Yes, it's strange but that's me.

      If one believes homosexuality is wrong, why are they labeled homophobic?  I feel for today's Christian, we are to have open hearts yet we aren't to accept one when different.  It's not too hard for me but I have noticed that some churches are open to everyone as they should be but they seem to have forgotten the Lord's word when it comes to homosexuality.  You must lead others out of temptation no matter the sin.  I've always been taught to and just naturally feel it's my place to embrace everyone but not the "lifestyle" or whatever.  I don't believe in harming someone just because their beliefs, morals, interests or race is different from another.  Totally moronic to hate someone so much that you would want to hurt them.  Why are some gays total stereotypes?  Women acting like men, men acting like women.  Women looking like men, men looking like women.  Doesn't that seem a bit strange?  It would seem like a man would just be a man even if he enjoyed the company of another man and the same for the women.    I was reading an article about a music artist's concert being cancelled due to so-called homophobic overtones.  That's what inspired this post.

      John Kerry and George Bush are lame.  We need someone who is going to stick it out no matter what the controversy is.  When I read that John Kerry's campaign decided to distance themselves from Whoopi Goldberg after her Bush remarks; I just thought that was so rude and showed me that he has no backbone.  I'm not a republican or democrat but I will vote for the one who kisses a  FAT BLACK BABY .  There's no real difference between the two, so I think that's the only deciding factor left.

      Why are some movie critics calling Napoleon Dynamite another version of Rushmore or Election?  It's nothing like Rushmore unless you're just going by that it takes place at a high school and there's an election.  The setup of ND is different from the others.  You probably won't grow to love or care about any of the characters, but you'll feel like your $10 was well spent.  I urge all who love fun quirky films to go check this one out.

       urlLink Andre 3000  of Outkast was named Sexiest Vegetarian by PETA.  PETA sucks major ass for their extreme way of getting out the word on the mistreatment of animals but they got this one right.      PETA recently went after several well-known heavyset celebrities, like  urlLink Ruben Studdard  and Michael Moore by sending them care packages on how to lose weight.  I could never support an organization that would do such things.  If these celebrities get fat, it's not PETA's problem.  So, go back into your lettuce igloo and chew on some carrot sticks.  We, at FAT GIRL FILMS will be enjoying a giant steak with a side of fried pork sticks and a chicken shake...yum!  Oh yeah, for dessert, we'll be having an ostrich parfait....

      I sold my mother's old upright piano for $177 on eBay today.  She's very excited about the sale and happy to get rid of it.  She's moving at the end of next month and doesn't want to haul it to her next residence.  It's  great piano and someone in Midland, TX just got a really great deal.

      I've been having some tech issues with my old Lexmark printer.  I've done just about everything you can do to possibly fix the issue because I like to handle my own problems.  I finally gave in and contacted the tech people at lexmark.  They didn't know what the hell to do.  Then, I decide to ask around in some Yahoo! tech group with basically no help.  People just telling me what I already know and tried.  I put the damn thing on eBay last night and I'm going to make the switch to Hewlett Packard.      I've been doing pre-production stuff on my Tit For Tat short film.  I'm doing most of the work myself, but I've got some great volunteers helping me.  The only thing I have to is not f*ck it up!      I've got a bit of a stomach ache.  I'll be off today, so I can just pamper myself to no end while prepping my script for shooting.      I thought I wanted to listen to some old school Off The Wall Michael Jackson, but after listening to a few tracks, I've come to realize that I'm not really a fan of Michael.  It's funny what media hype can do to a person.      Also, The Streets only has a couple of hot tracks.  He's not really a rapper, he basically talks over the tracks.  He doesn't ride the rhythm of the track and his wordplay skills aren't on point.  He might want to take a couple of classes at the School of Eminem.      SONG OF THE DAY: You Make Me High by Toni Braxton

      Meet  urlLink Beverly Cheng and Johnny O'Neal , they married on July 24. I stumbled upon Johnny's website while checking out a fellow triggerstreet member's website. I read Johnny's blog and read about his engagement to Beverly. It's a very sweet story and they really seem to vibe well.

      It's late and I just finished watching Startup.com about two guys trying to get an internet company off the ground. I have learned that the co-founding member  urlLink Bryan Mundy  of their rival ezgov.com is dead. Incidently, ezgov.com is still going strong and govworks.com was bought out by someone and reincarnated as  urlLink govonesolutions.com . The documentary was awesome! Tom Herman has what looks to be a bi-racial child.  urlLink Kaleil Tuzman  looked like a total meathead but still you could tell that he was a cool and very intelligent guy. I felt bad for Kaleil's suffering girlfriend Dora. Dora made one point that most men don't get. Let's say you're running multi-million dollar internet start-up or even running Pizza Hut, if you're going to be busy for a few days.....let the girl know. Don't go about your life for a week without calling and expect for the girl to be happy to hear your voice. A couple of minutes out of 24 hours is not too much to ask, but men don't see that way. Ugh, I think I'm having a moment..... The guys have gone on to start another company called  urlLink Recognition Group .  Tom has a small page on his family's company  urlLink website  about the whole govWorks, Startup.com and other things people might be interested to know about.    Btw, Tit for tat's filming was postponed until July 31....this is the final postponement because I can't take it anymore....    I've got movies to make and by golly, they're going to get made!(doesn't that sound like a good slogan? I might have to use that....)

      I was totally grooving on some old school Keith Sweat.  Anyone remember the now classic    urlLink Make It Last Forever  album from the late 1980s?  Get educated on some of the grooviest R & B music and my closest friends know this is my least favorite musical genre, so this must be some good sh*t!

      Why do I always expect for my soulmate to be some lonely spaz until my vibrant spirit inhabits his world?  That's so silly for me to think because I would never want to be with someone like that.  I love people with personality, like moi.  Someone crazy and a bit off their rocker, because they would have to be in order to want to be with me.

      A cool female filmmaker.....Meet  urlLink Dina Mande .  The  Tit For Tat  shoot went well on Saturday.  I was running late as usual and it was a 30 drive to the set.  On top of everything, I was running on about 2 hours of sleep.  I felt good about all of the performances, I just wish I had more time for extra shots(closeups and such).  We didn't start filming until nearly 2pm and I had to be back in OKC at 4pm.  The film will be between 5 and 10 minutes in length.  The cast was fantastic and everyone got along so well.  I had a wonderful director of photography and lighting guy.  The total cost of production was around $60, which is basically little to no budget.  We'll be doing the editing next week in Tulsa.
