        urlLink    Alicita and I setting off for our journey. This is just after I had a talk with Alice's parents, and they told me to watch out for her, cause she was completely incapable. Little did I know that my parents were telling Alice how completely irresponsible I was, and how she needed to take care of me. Team reckless. Team Chastity. Reckless Chastity. Rock on. &nbsp; &nbsp;    urlLink    Well, Here we all are in It- oh wait, no. This is an Embassy Suites outside of Dulles Airport. This is where we all spent the night, cause the French and this woman named Rachel (We still have to kill her) messed up our "E-Tickets" or some crap. Poor Ms. Hefty. See that fake rose in front? It's no longer there. We stole it for Ms. Hefty. We love her so much. This is where we sat for a good while. Doing nothing. Dont worry, we moved to the lobby to the right and did a hell of a lot more waiting around. For nothing. For a long time. Woo. The saga begins: Operation SOMEHOW GET TO ITALY has commenced.    urlLink    This is the beautiful Embassy Suites Room where these lovely ladies and I had the pleasure of staying.  We got to eat dinner for like three whole hours that night!  And the lady thpoke a Thpanith.  (spokeaspanish).  Molly and I had a good night of Bridget Jones in the next room's King sized bed, and all four of us had a slumber party where we exchanged major secrets like any good sleepover.  It was quite fun, actually, for not being in Italy.  Or so we thought, until we actually got to Italy and realised that, wait, it was much cooler.    urlLink    Alice and I on the bus going BACK to the airport.  The sad part is that we're happy cause we THINK we have a flight.  Ah, so misled! God damn that Rachel.  No, we wasted our energy being happy thinking we were going to Canada.  Imagine!  Being happy to go to Canada!   Also note the matching polos and pearls.  Nice touch, no? It is our Puertorican Style showing through. Okay, so here's Cita and I looking wonderfully fakely happy and kind of not well rested.  I look really gross in this picture, why am I posting it?  Oh well.    urlLink    This lady was extreemely awesome.  Conor called her a "Mother Hen" cause she led us little chicks across this CRAZY WORLD we call.... Heathrow?  Yeah.  That one in London.  Right-o.  Anyway, the weird thing about Airports in London, or at least this one is that NOBODY TALKS! It's amazing, a public place that sounds like a library! It's increadible, and definately scary, cause we, the loud Americans that we are, made lots of noise.  Oh by the way, these are the lucky eight who made it onto a flight. Nine were stillstuck in Dulles.  Thus the happy smiles we all have.  Still Rockin the Polos, a day later. mmmm.  Rock on, flight attendant lady, we love you.    urlLink    This is us after a few hours in the airport.  Let's just say that we all smelled, well, quite aweful after a long time of traveling.  Planes smell bad.  Molly re-deoderizes, and saves us all from her stench.  Note Brett's expression.  Is he offended by Molly's smell? Nah, he's just tired.  No drama here, sorry guys.    urlLink    NOT AMUSED!  But we made it!  Molly and I are on a train from Rome to Naples, where we would meet Mr. Slipek.  No wait, Mr. Slipek was on the train.  Yeah, where we would meet Mr. Ross and the rest of the kids.  Those lucky bastards who made it.  Anyway,  this is us completely looking and feeling completely like shit.  again, why do I post this?  I know not.  But note the snazzy new $10 watch my mom got me from Target.  It broke, the jerk.  But oh well.  I think this is the last Polo picture, I am afraid, because we smell so bad that these clothes went directly into a bag I labeled "Condemned!" and were not brought out of it again until I got home.  Man did they stink.  Alright, enough about the stinking.    urlLink    My first ever view of..... that's right...... ITALY!!!! so we made it.  Note the, uh, glare from the flash on the left.  and the uh, mountains.... i think.... and uh..... anyway, this train ride was so amazing, it was one of the best parts of the trip because I got to take in Italy's beautiful scenery all at once, and while everybody on the train was sleeping I just kept looking out the window in awe, it was so cool.  the scenery was this dramatic, there were aqueducts in front of mountains and cliffs and the mountains went up into these rolling puffy clouds and you couldn't see the tops.  And the coolest thing about it was the yellow tint to everything, it seemed like another planet.  It was so increadibly beautiful, I was so so thankful to finally be there. Despite my expression in the last picture of utter fatigue.    urlLink    We reuinite with the oh so fragrant and showered Sara Warren, and then we showered, and this is the view from our room.  I'm talkin Ruins, Ocean, and yes, even powerlines.  We had our own balcony.  Did I meantion we were showered?  That is why we are so damn happy.  Besides the fact that we finally made it to the most beautiful place ever.  This is "The Villa"  outside of Naples, and Mr. Ross's favorite place we stay.  I like it Because of the Eggs in the morning, which is what I can eat.  Actually I like it for the general food.  Its really good.  Mmmm, showered.  Clean clothes.  You have no idea just how good they felt.   urlLink    The roomies.  And Sam Blankenship.  Who is quite Awesome.  This is just our room again.  It was a really nice room, too, if i do say so myself.  Note the view, my bed is the one in front, and um, yeah thats about it. The villa rocks.    If you went on the trip, or wish you did, make some comments for me so I'll post more.  Put your own captions to the pictures if you want to.  Also, if you went on the trip and have some photos, I'd love to put them up here, you can IM me at volleyballgal459, thanks.

        urlLink    This is a sweet ampitheatre and Sam Blankenship's Head.  What I loved about this place was that you could go everywhere in it, and we were like the only people in there.  It was a million times cooler than the Collosseum, cause even though it wasnt as big, there werent a million tourists from Brooklyn, or a buncha gates everywhere.  This place was beautiful, too!  It was well preserved, but just ruined enough to feel like we'd just stumbled upon it. It was overgrown slightly and just, in all, breathtaking.  I loved it so much more than the Collosseum.  Or however its spelled.

        urlLink    Sara Warren and I battle to the death in the Ampitheatre.  I won, of course.  Actually, Sara is a pretty hardcore streetfighter.  Maybe its all that NWA she's been listening to. *Shakes head*

        urlLink    Just Swarren, Roshelle, me, and Alice posing in the theatre.  I get a little camera happy my first day. So yeah, isnt this place sweet looking?  I told ya. And look at that sweet left to right documentation by yours truely.  Mmm I really loved this place.  If you can't already tell by my insane babbling.  I use the rest of my film here.

        urlLink    This is the UNDERBELLY OF THE AMPITHEATRE! I'm as excited about this as Mr. Ross is. Which is damn excited.  Anyway, these pictures really dont capture how beautiful this is, behind every little arch there's more arches and broken collumbs (how on earth do you spell that?)  This town was awesome, as we were walking along (or maybe it was the next town?) anyway, these kids threw glass bottles at us!  really close to us!  I felt unwanted.  But who cares, this place was so awesome I wanted to become a photographer just so I could do a photoshoot of this place.  Which I sort of did, with my crappy disposable camera and the help of one Miss Alice Hsieh.

        urlLink    So this is where like all the gladiators got ready and came when they were all bleeding and shit.  Lovely image, but I felt sort of gladiatorish.  When we were back up there I yelled I AM GLADIATOR! Russel Crowe style.  Unfortunately, people just looked at me weird.  Shoulda said it in Italian.

        urlLink    Who-wah- Huh? That's right! It's our favorite girl Jessica Burris in Italy! She came in Spirit.  And then inhabited the body of Mary Linell. Scary how good it is, right?  This is her dancing for the fans in the theatre.

        urlLink    Oh good, she got herself back from that Jessica possesser girl.  Yeah. Mary was awesome and always climbed stuff she wasnt supposed to. In all fairness, I climbed a huge thing too to get this picture.   And then got yelled at by this Italian guy through Mr. Ross. Yeah. I'm cool.  And thus ends this roll of film.

        urlLink    Ted's name in Italian Class is "Salvatore" and for some reason I saw that name everywhere grafitti'd.  Of course, there were like 8423029843923 names graffittied on like every wall/phone booth/piece of ancient artwork/architecture/sidewalk ever.  However, i just decided to take a picture of it anyway.  A bunch of people in my group looked at me really weird, too, cause I was taking pictures of a random......... a random......... uh I don't even know what this is. But rock on.  The most common grafitti was "Ti Amo" (I love you) whoever their love was.  And then something like "I can't live without you" or "You are my life" or "You are so damn special I grafittied your name on a wall.  This is love."     urlLink    Miss Molly (yes, good golly) (that was so cheasy.  Did I spell chease right? Or is it Cheese? Tina help.  I'm tiard. Right. Anyway.)  and I in front of whatever it's called.  Palazza Regalo?  Thats just my guess.  It's the palace for whoever rules whatever city this is.  This is pathetic.  It's Naples.  And It's huge, it goes around three sides of us.  It also has a LOT of couples making out all over it.  I swear.  There are like five around there on benches.  The person taking the picture is probobly making out.  This place is like chocolate or flowers I guess. So here are Molly and I, err, not making out, just, uh, posing.     urlLink    Some weirdo who thinks she's a statue, too. Psh, crazy tourists.  I like the strong image of womankind.  You know, ancient feminists and all.  Or maybe that's bullshit and I simply enjoy every available opportunity to be an idiot.  I think I'm going with B.  I have no idea who this is.  But damn, she must have tickets to the GUN SHOW!!!!  get it...... alright moving on.     urlLink    Tracy, Deanna, Emily and I in the ''backyard" of the Palace thing.  That big distant road going up that mountain thing is a feat that a lot of people climbed.  See that grey thing on the next hill up?  Sara, Tracy, Allie, Alice and I sat there.  Much more relaxing. Also: See everyone leaned over the rail? They're looking at fish.  Tons and Tons and Millions of fish.  They like kill each other over the food we threw in there.  I got one to jump out of the water.  We were touristy, but whatever.  This was like 30 minutes of fun, right here, feeding and watching those damn fish. It was so increadibly fun.  And then we ate sandwiches with our bare hands. Yum.  But all the fish though are dead on the other end of the pond. Yum.      urlLink    Sara, Me, and Alice  with Principessa Cane, A combination of the two names Alice and Sara tried to give it. I just call it that.  They have their respective names.  I dont care.  Its a street dog. There were so many street dogs in Italy. It was our pet for a while when we waited for the kids to do their climbing thing.  And so we posed with the waterfall and the dog and then played with it for almost as long as we played with the fish.  Oh, what a circus.  Anyone know that line? no. Sigh, where's Carlton when you need him.    urlLink    This is the view from where we were sitting.  There was a street below us, as you can see, so I waved to the cars for a while when other people were writing in their journals.  Or climbing that big thing.  Hehe, you can see that statue's butt.  Yeah.  Mmmm.  So our first day in Italy comes to a close thus.     urlLink    The next day we go to Paestum.  This is that awesome Temple to Hera II (And behind it there is Temple to Hera I)  And I dunno I thought I'd be artsy and take it with the tree and all, my first view of it because it was so damn increadible looking.  This temple is HUGE, and so so so so SO old.  It looks amazing, I'm so lucky to be able to see stuff like this.  I'm a dork, I was so totally into this stuff.  Isn't it cool looking? Alright, this is really the last picture on this roll, because I lied last time, I just didnt want to post any more pictures.  Right-o, then, till next time.

        urlLink    Me (and part of Conor (Connor?) Wakeman)  With a big bottle of Fanta. (Dontcha Wanta?)  We all drank so damn much fanta it was quite crazy.  Also notice the wonderful wheat adorning our table.  Mmmmm....... Anyway, this is at the Hotel Belvidere, where we, err, slept and ate I guess. It was quite a beautiful hotel, If I do say so myself. Which I just did.  Anyway, yeah. Fanta rocks.    urlLink    This is the rest of our group eating.  Notice the weird man to the right of Ms. Hefty? That would be Ciro the Awesome, our bus driver.  Even Coke, as you can see, comes in huge glass bottles like that, (like the fanta did) in Europe, which was quite weird.  Also all the water was bottled and if you didnt ask for it "senza gas" it came all bubbly.  Which was quite weird, but I somehow came to enjoy it.  I don't know how.    urlLink    And then, like the smooth kid I am, dropped the Camera.  Note the um, tablecloth, I guess, and I don't quite know why I put this picture in, but now that it's there, oh well.  I wonder what that is on the right.  A shoe? We may never know.  So that was interesting...... moving along........     urlLink    Alice and I at that same hotel with a view of the water and beautiful balconies.  This picture was taken by Francesco, a friend we all made at that town who was pretty cool and enjoyed Oasis.  So we all sang "Wonderwall" and had an Almost-Famous caliber bus sing-along.  It was wonderful.    urlLink    The view from this place was AMAZING, this picture really doesnt capture it, but man,  it was so breathtaking to look down upon the town and just to be able to see for miles (or I guess kilometers....... ew makes me think of Physics) out onto the ocean.  I loved this place.  Gaah, Italy is so gorgeous, I miss it now.    urlLink    This is the family that owned this Hotel Belvidere.  The man in the middle beside Ms. Hefty is Salvatore, who is the father, and his family was so nice and thoughtful and very excited to have Americans staying with them.  He brought out the USA flag and had a welcoming party for us, and explained to us how he made olive oil, and we got some of his olive oil, and, these people were just great.    urlLink    This is the lady that made me special wheat free food and talked to me about it for a while, and she was really nice to me.  She was like my little Italian friend and she gave me a hug when I left and everything.  I loved her.  Here's also a good view of..... well the view.  I forgot her name, but she was very cool.    urlLink    Me at the Beach in Sapri.  Sapri was the first big town we visited, which was nice.  Note the beach is not really sand, but more like little stones, which makes for interesting lounging.  Not quite as bad as the beach near the Hotel Belvidere, where the rocks were really big and really uncomfortable.

       urlLink    This is by Manet- It's called Bar at Folies Bergeres  I like this one, because if you notice, she seems so disconnected to the viewer, who sees her through the eyes of the patron, theres such a distance between us and her, and yet in the reflection in the mirror she's interacting with him-  its said to be a commentary  on sadness or loneliness, interacting with people and still feeling disconnected...... i dunno it intreagued me in some weird psychologist way.       * Pythagorean Theorem: 24 words     * The Lord's Prayer: 66 words     * Archimedes Principle: 67 words     * The Ten Commandments: 179 words     * The Gettysburg Address: 286 words     * The Declaration of Independence: 1,300 words     * The U.S. government regulations on the sale of cabbage: 126,911 words  and i dont know why that intreagued me.    so i guess im supposed to talk about stuff that happened  lets see, wow, um a week ago was prom.  carlton was so nice to drive ted and i there, i sorta got the feeling that maybe he didnt want to, but nevertheless he did, and im very greatful.    not like the dead.  which is spelled grateful,  and mary crook is very picky about it.  right, randomness.  anyway, um prom was wonderful, and even though we were increadibly late to dinner, both carlton and alice both managed to get their flowers that they forgot at home.  and carlton made it there in 15 minutes like he declared.  it was amazing.  or uh-mazing, tinastyle.  speaking of tina, i sorta wished she came, and was glad to see her at afterprom.  i won a sleeping bag, woohoo, which i came home and crashed in until the middle of the day.  chelsea and i woke up and ate eggs and i drove her home, and talked to her parents.  i skipped something, oh right the prom  it was so hot in there- everyone looked sweaty and gr- beautiful.  glowing. hot. alice and i were shiny in all our puertoriquenoness  these richmonders cant handle our heat.  this week has been a pain, since all i've been doing is avoiding all the work i should be doing, and this sounds so typical but its like those debt commercials, where the debt is just hanging over them and they stop answering the phone and start getting freaked out.  its like that.   i actually studied for a physics test though.  and what do i get for all my hard work?  the test pulled away from me before i was finished. that jerk.   so now i'm doing my vjas project, which mr zweerink is making me do  or else i cant graduate.  so im crunched, and its not like i havent known about it forever, but my procrastination has made it suck.  a lot.   and my experiment sucks so ill probobly like have to pay people to do it.  or just threaten them with communist takeover of their country.  speaking of which,

      I spent the entire night home alone, which was completely refreshing considering...........   just considering.   i watched 40 days and 40 nights, which was a sorta dissapointment, but i will never look at flowers the same way again.  i watched some PIMP MY RIDE!!!!!! which i have been completely obsessed with.  Jessie complains because every time we watch it i always say "JESSIE! Wouldn't it be awesome if they pimped out a RAV4?" and she always says yes, jackie, that would be cool.  and then she says we'd ahve to trash my car.  and then i say maybe it wouldnt be so cool   haha i'm like autistic, i swear, i have to have the same conversations over and over...... i dont even know if i realise it. oh well.  let's see, i ate mexican freezer meals, and ooh! it was awesome  i was trying to make a list of songs that were beautiful  but then it resorted to being a list of songs that changed my life.   it was awesome.  aah memories tied to music.  I also went through like a million magazines trying to find pictures of italy.  all i got was pictures of the Godfather and the movie Troy.  which was i think in Greece?  No, i'm a dumb fuck- it was in troy.  not in greece.     urlLink    I wish I was beautiful and Italian like that. mmm. I can't wait.  She's in front of some Important statue I was trying to find a picture of.  But I liked this one better.    I called mike to apologise for my mom hanging up on him last night, so he talked to me while driving from one place to another.  he made fun of ted a good bit, its become a pastime of him even though he doesnt even know him.  its pathetic.  i told him so.  oh- how about my mom totally freaked out sidropolous ( i so spelled that wrong)  by saying "I've heard so much about you!"  when really she hasnt, but she thought she'd flatter him.  now he thinks i'm his secret admirer.  i told him i had a shrine to him.  alice backed my story up.     let's see....... this is easier to write than i thought it would be.     i made fun of alice today for making fun of me...... so i was making fun of myself?  teal and pearls.  its a classic ladies.  its all about the teal.  i'm really obsessed.  why isnt this blog teal?  what color is it? i dunno its new.  alright thats all.  I wanna see who makes it to this new blog of mine. so leave a comment.

       urlLink    its so sad, all the seniors are leaving.  My spanish class is gonna be gone *sniff* that was always my favorite.   And tomorrow we get yearbooks, and yeah i hate signing them.  its so i dunno final? and even tho its not cause we're all gonna be back next year i know i'll forget most of this year and i shouldnt.  so the yearbook is how we all remember the little retarded things, so i dunno pressure?  haha i stress about yearbooks.  this year owns all over last year.     k thanks.     there was a bit, but for the most part so much less drama.  i'm learning to live with everything, i'm off of wheat, i'm off of yeah, i'm off of talking about things that bother me and hopefully others are off of feeling sorry for me.   i liked going to nyc, i liked hanging out at tina's (driving there too, even though short pump traffic is full of bastads)  i liked becoming increadibly close with chelsea, i missed some people who i used to talk to, too.  i liked that i could drive.  i feel independant even though my keys are currently taken from me.   i feel like my own person.  i liked key club, i liked prom.  i loved prom.  i feel bad that this summer   i'm going away, and yet i'm so excited about italy. its going so well now, i just dont want it to end, or get messed up over the summer.  i dont want junior year to end.  we're going to be seniors! old! our very last year of high school. of living at home.  our last homecomming, last prom, last chance to do whatever the fuck we want to do in high school.  and i plan on doing just that.  while keeping my grades up.   im such a governor's schooler.  i was like maybe, jackie, if you are so nervous about writing exactly what you need to in peoples yearbooks, why dont you try writing it down ahead of time, you dork?  man i cant even do that.  have a great summer.  love ya.  we should hang out.  (meaning we wont)  call me (meaning you wont)  and i love you (which i honestly do)

      If i had a million dollers.......  I'd be rich   i love that song so much.  so long time, no talk. Ted's home, which is awesome, cause i missed him a whole lot more than i ever thought i would.  i've also been hanging out with chelsea. so much. so damn much.  which is cool, cause we're catching up and all.  you konw, i dont talk to her for two days, we grow apart haha.    i'm taking her to the beach with the hamlin family.  she's never been on vacation with us.  actually i dont think anybody has. which is cool, i   think  i'm driving down there myself, and my that i mean with an adul.....chelsea.  an almost-adult.  wow, the big 18. that's cigarettes and porno, my friend. and voting.   i'm also hanging out with mike, who's leaving me for college, which he's not looking forward to, but i'm sending him off by being totally bitchy to him.  nah, just kidding, he likes it.  this was going to be really deep, oh wait, ......... *rest of entry deleted*
