      I lie among the leaves, Upon the forest floor.  Pungent scents of wood and moss, Singing wind and dappled sun. The sun doth not hurt me!.  Clothed in my hair, Long and dark as sin. I know not cold, or heat -  But I know hunger!.  Warm earth cradles, Living forest comforts. I lie.....and wait For my calling.  ~ Anakya

      Beauty in life...  But in death?  Are they the same?  Yes, I think they are  Because one may walk in death yet be alive.  The spark that dwells within  Is not gone, but shines  With a new luminosity.  What then is learned?  What is known?  Perhaps a chance to embrace the darkness...  To balance it with the Light.  To truly know thyself,  One must be willing to embrace ALL.  Form changeth not,  Yet change is a constant.  I grow and prosper:  Only when I am willing to BE ALL,  But who am I?  ~ Anakya

      And I lifted my hands Under the weight of his silken hair And felt his lips Brush my cheek.  And I stretch upward on my toes, To joing with him as one. Consuming, and being consumed by - Hot and cold, Darkness and light, No begining and no end - There is only US.  Faint night smells fill my senses. I am the night.... The night is in his eyes... And now, in mine too.  ~ Anakya

      The end of the dark tunnel of forgetuflness, or ignorance is coming.  Those who would fight against illumination and continue to spread darkness shall not be denied a future, but rather, they shall be forgiven all should they return to God. No creature shall be denied this enlightenment, or an opportunity to be part of the Golden age which is coming. All that is illusion and all that is aligned with the darkness is now revealed, as the light is shone upon it. The foundations are laid, and soon it will be time for the Builders to take their places. Now is the time for those who have slept to awaken.  Now is the time that the dead shall walk upon the earth and they shall interact with the living.  The ignorance of death shall be no more.  The churches shall crumble, and the markets shall fall.  The Governmental structures will undergo great change.  There will be great storms, and shaking of the earth, and there will be upheaval, but there will also be a seed of peace born of this chaos.  That seed will take root and shall come to fruition. Through chaos and destruction is founded Unity, and through that Unity there is peace.  Time is short for those who would return to God, for those who would cast aside their illusions.  It is not that they will be punished, but rather, this reality shall not be supportive of them any longer. These are the End Times, but they are only the end of this time, not the end of all time.  It is the end of the cycle of Duality, and the begining of the cycle of Oneness. Be prepared, this time is upon you.  ~ Gabriel

      Ascension is a term that has come to be more widely used in this time. It is a term that means 'to raise above' something. In terms of spiritual Ascension, this is the same concept. Let me explain this further. Everything is energy, and all energy vibrates at a particular rate or speed. The slower the rate, the lower the frequency, and the more 'dense' something appears to be. Reality exists on different band widths, like a radio station or a website. Anything that vibrates at a similar speed and frequency can be perceived in that reality, and can interact with it. Cause and Effect means that energy or frequencies can be changed by changing the nature of the object or by the actions of that object.  Your body vibrates at a fairly slow rate, and therefore the frequency is that which has come to be known as the 'physical' realm. The Third Dimension. You are capable of changing your vibratory rate at will, and it is affected by the changes in your spiritual growth. The realms of spirit exist on slightly different band widths to the physical one, and therefore are not immediately discernable to you unless you raise your own vibratory rate to further match the band widths of spirit.  All matter is energy vibrating at certain frequencies. The higher the frequency, the less dense the object. Atoms, broken down into their smallest form, would look like trillions of tetrahedrons (pyramids base to base) all interconnected. God is an excellent mathmatician. There is a 'force' which binds these elements together, to form mass. The mass is formed according to a Divine Blueprint. That is the plan for all life that began in God's imagination. OK, that is the physics lesson. Still with me? Ascension is the process by which you are able to 'rise above' your limitations. To go beyond what has limited you in your existence.  What does Ascension feel like? It is a sense of being one with all things, of knowing where you've been and where you are, and understanding fully how you got there. It is knowing yourself to be One with God. It is knowing without a doubt, that all things are possible because you have the power to imagine and make manifest. It is a merging of all the 'seperate' aspects of yourself which were previously fragmented. It is an embracing of you - all that you are, in total love, and an embracing with love of every other thing in existence. Are you limited to which band width you can exist on? No. Can you change from one to the other? Yes. Why is it that you think you cannot walk on water? Why is it that you believe you cannot levitate to a mountaintop?. Why do you believe that death is the end of your cycle?. You are limited by what you believe to be Truth. Your programming - from childhood, past lives, schools, religions, society. What you believe about yourself and your own capabilities. Self love - or lack of. Allowing your physical form to become the expression for all your fears and blocks and becoming dis-eased. Your beliefs select the reality you perceive and also the reality you experience. Do you have a genetic disposition to ageing and dying by a certain time? Yes you do. Can you override it? Yes. There is an older blueprint in your soul which carries a Divine Plan for what you were created to be. All you have to do is become it.  You do not truly die. You are discovering this with your forays into the realms of spirit. You know that the core essence of you cannot die. Only the slower vibrational mass - the body, returns to the energy from whence it came. The only way to 'cease to exist' is by rejoining God. By merging with All That Is, and then that is not really ceasing.  It is possible, with you will, your absolute faith, and your overcoming all limitation, that you can raise your body's vibrations into light. Not to seperate from it through the process you knew as death, but to bring it with you into the Light. Because you are not limited by the physical and never have been. All souls are on the path of Ascension. But it is an individual process. When you begin a journey into self exploration, and spiritual awareness, you are uncovering a Truth that is programmed into your very cells. It is programmed into your soul. It is part of the Divine Blueprint which you are designed to be. When you discover things about this Truth, a light goes on inside you. Your mind opens to new possibilities, and the reality you perceive changes. Because you have changed your frequency. With each discovery of this Truth, your vibration goes up. You can still perceive and even interact with the third and fourth dimensions as you were doing, but you can also perceive higher frequencies of reality too. When you feel and express love and compassion, your vibration goes up, you begin to fill with Light, and that light channels through your being. This is because when you do this, you are begining to recognize and fulfill your Divine Blueprint. You are feeling and expressing things that God feels and expresses. Incarnate, you are God's eyes, ears and hands. Through you, God knows Himself, and can grow.
