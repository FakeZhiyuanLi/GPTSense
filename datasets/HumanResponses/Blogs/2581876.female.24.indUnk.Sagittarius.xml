      "Don't look at me, that's misleading. If you want to know what I'm like, wait until we're in a tunnel, and then study my reflection in the window." - from p. 108 of _Flaubert's Parrot_ by Julian Barnes  Love is a butterfly left with one wing and that wing is on fire. We were never quite balanced. The Buddhist one hand clapping paradox made the butterfly flutter and fall on fire.   Women fall at your feet and shit falls from you. Wading into the sea until your belly button, you get the disease to keep in secrets and breed lies. Oh, drown yourself. Truth is there in the abyss. Kiss me only when you've resurfaced.   "Hang yourself with a sugar rope and you’ll have a sweet death." -Yiddish curse.  -solsol

      Finished Julian Barnes' _Flaubert's Parrot_: in an impressive style and asking the deepest questions: why life? why art? is there a difference. Flaubert is a step to enlightenment and the steps of his life mark the steps of questions that can never be answered. which parrot? there is no one parrot. but just that one... to be continued...

      liberty a flock. beauty on the dock. the clocks from all cities. that's where your package goes. clean prose. clean toes. no one knows. i'd like to try flying once. somebody could show me how. being permanently manic, i'd be a good mechanic. but depressed, don't make me undress--in my clothes i dream of nakedness. a hundred people go this way, without smiles, their guilt showing through their clicking fingers, their eyes lingering on their velvet dresses, insipid memories, buying memories, treating their lives with soap. a husband arrives, a wife at the same time. children not yet arrived. she has yellow hair, he dyes his black. the trials begin, and their collection of LPs or ducks or whatevers...a city full of luck and candy from hard work. i want to be there. i want to do that. i want to be that person who doesn't shit, eat or sleep. i want to look perfect. made up from the morning, skin shining. don't eat, shit or sleep. i want to be useful, work like a nyorker, not eat, sleep or shit. and then, i want to love you. but that comes last, after i've lived a little.

      lovely retards mark my progress. i've crushed all the black tulips. they were the pink streaked ones. child-care painting left the paint to drip oh. i've detected a delirious smell in my insides like something out of a b-grade horror movie. stuffed peppers rot in the fridge. everyone's running on empty, shutting down the movie theatres, living on vodka and ice. saturday (lie), there was a big snowstorm like the kind that imitates Nietzsche on his death bed. i've forgotten everything ER said. he's so normal that i can't understand him. caprice by paganini. elephants tracking dirt in the hallway. attempts to eat lettuce all day failing. coffee degenerates and craving for a dark one. let me write it down. for G-d's sake. smoke.

      Honey, i'm so glad i can talk you, with your lime green slippers and pink ribbon round your ankle. Oh, you ballerina, you.  I've walked my feet dry and shuffled along slush like you wouldn't believe. Everything about this city is confusing: there is not one grey skirt to be bought, not one off-white top to be seen. I'm going to buy all my clothes online and exercise to keep to one size. It beats wasting time in shop after shop. I'm starting to sound common. Well, i went to see AF and AP and saw PC and CV and SM. OF course, my dear ER is so right and good that i would live just to be with one like him. What did he say, let me remember....

      hair... i was at a funeral on Monday. someone cut a lock of the husband's hair and he put it in the open casket. he took the scissors and cut a lock of his wife's hair... luckily, i didn't see the body with so little hair left...all her amazingly beautiful perpetually curly black hair...she died of lung cancer. R.I.P. i've never taken an acid trip. i'm going to like people better...and their beautifully damned books. (p.s.: don't you know me?) IDM feels an impending sense of doom. had a dream that KB had left me out of the part. IDM and I at the border between US and Canada but in an airport tunnel: he kept kissing me. we were together. funny, what a friend... his sister packed her bags and left her husband (some Texan...with a gun...but that's not all.) praying she's safe. everyone's leaving losing lovers... should i go to Oundle and teach? 80 miles from the city... love your beautiful countryside babe...

Bella Rabinovitch's funeral yesterday...AP read Donne's Canonization: she had read this to him at their wedding two months before. He had his hair cut, and took some of hers... and put on her reading glasses... I didn't see her alive, so why see her in the open casket? Irish wake... She took Johnny Walker Red with her and woofed at the sailors. R.I.P.. The piano music was liquid: transparent...beautiful. The clay bells and Sister Cleevely. Should visit Marianopolis... AF hugged me. Again, R.I.P.. Zeida, I love you!

      Finished Pelevin's _Buddha's Little Finger_ (Viking, 1999) on Jan. 9. Want to know about men in white hats... Writing the book "American Fiction." January 7, 2004 The man with a hat.  Name for the novel: “American Psycho” or since it has been already taken “American Fiction” Just yesterday, I came across a ladybug, rusty winter colored pouring over the floor. I counted eight spots on its back and set it on a plant leaf to match the green. In a dream, the villagers spoke of water. Their faces were all scratched, as if a demon had handed them to the crow’s beak. Outside, the wind was fierce: the snow dusted along all the streets, fairy dust, blocking out the view of the town hall, a palace at night. The snow was light and hunger struck the meekest. A rising sun stroked the surface of the eyes of their leader, blue in the mirror, green in the forest. He was of pure mind and he catered to a ballet dancer. She danced for him, in her white shimmer, every night before dinner and even before breakfast, her muscles taut with hate. He would tie a green satin ribbon around her waist and a black choker around her neck. He liked to call her his Degas. There were sunny days that winter. Fireflies found a way of sighing at night in memory of summer. Birds rushed by windows, glinting like rainbows, tulip colored, intelligent. As he walked to the station, the investigation began. She paced the courtyard with Rachmaninov at her ears –one swan to each ear, killing it.  In the park, they met like strangers. She pretended to recognize him. He read her his collection of atrocious poems and wandered into the bushes to pee. Liquid poured from him in bitter strokes. He did not love her, but he craved her touch. He was lying to her, lacing ribbons round her wrist. The sound of angels laughing and Robert Frost's devil made him tremble and trembling leads to laughing. You have killed me, she sighed. He denied and went on his way.

      And as she stood over the bed, lantern in hand, the stranger appeared. His eyes were green with red lines instead of pupils and he wore a bright blue satin tie with white starched shirt and no blazer. His pants were silver: as if they were made of the wrapping paper you get for a wedding anniversary gift. He did not speak for a what seemed like a few moments. Every moment creaked. The wonder of it all. She had cleaned up all her books, sorted out all her creams and bandaids, washed every dish, dried every tear, but now she knew why she hadn't done it earlier: didn't she need that emergency suitcase: oh G-d help me so that I may never need help from others. The dizziness was tremendous. Emergency suitcase. Her heart did palpitate. nothing: a friend betraying. Nothing: it did not matter, was all perception. Nothing mattered. It was so funny because the saddest things were funny. Love was a guttural disease. Love was measured in dollar bills. Love was a nonety. of all clouds: that was the New Haven cloud. dark, misty, brilliant, silver on the outside. delirious, she leapt on her bed, longing to break it. All the drink, all the glamour, the breathy voice, the shimmery lipstick, where was the pain if not hidden--raw raw raw the weather--the world was on edge, and the dance had just begun. She would keep on writing.

      What day is it? What day is it? Sitting in my bed clothes on the floor, I feel cold. Who will listen when I do not? How could I respond? the birds are tired, living under an umbrella of fire. when the hail stones become jewelled, tears turn to blood. who owns language? who tells us it is wrong to write such and such a thing, that such and such a thing is in bad taste? i cannot decide. who writes badly is struck down by G-d. that is all i know. humans cannot see beauty more than truth. they lie before they can grow old, and grow old defying love. the mirror saves the desperate from forgetting their own place in ugliness and the reason they are laughed at. yet, the slug, the turtle and the monster share their face with the rose. if it makes me feel, if it makes me think--it is good--but how do they know if their feeling is pure and their thoughts true? no, bad words hurt them, bad taste makes them see their own. no, give me jewels to heap into my mind before i become blind with the hell of another's ugliness. i want the words to make my hair shine, my lips full and wide, my teeth white as i become the object of all poems.

       urlLink SALON Departments: Lit Chat: A.S. Byatt, page 2  "This just made me very angry, because it seemed to me that life was so varied and complex that it took up all your energy, and yours would never be the same as anybody else's description unless you were a bad writer. The only definition I give of how I know a novel is bad is: one, if it's derivative, totally derivative; and two, if the sentences are limp. I can't think of any other.   The nice thing about a novel is that everything can go into it, because if you've got the skill between sentence and sentence, you can change genre, you can change focus, you can change the way the reader reads. And yet you can keep up this sort of quiet momentum of narration. It is a wonderful form, despite my getting angry with Lawrence. You can do anything." A.S. Byatt

One thing is true--without truth, you can never have love.  Answer my prayer.... (aretha...) No one understands, no one believes, is it so impossible to see? The hand rests on the arm, the thigh on the branch, wings on the eyelids, lips on the stone. If music could do this to do you, then what about love? Does anyone know where it went? Why do you question it so? Why is it deeper than anything I know? I will never move with it, nothing is done with it, i must scorn it, i must become the dust of a moan, must hide it in the whisper of a sunrise, on the dew drop of an oleander leaf poisonous to the touch. I must cut it from my prayers, sweep it out with the dust, rip it with the papers i can no longer keep.

      last night, i had a baby in my dream. i held it to my chest, under my clothes, afraid it would fall even as i drew its impossible warmth to me. i cried because i thought it would die. i thought i did not know how to feed it, how to let it live. in one moment, without struggling, it showed me how unnecessary it was to be afraid. even though my body was shaking with tears, it took me in its mouth, gently, to drink my milk.   then, i awoke.   ["there, how can she sleep? how can she sleep when he wakes her?   she will sleep forever or stay awake always."]   i wish i could have said: "stay with me, baby." for a few moments, it had loved me, stopped my tears, and no one had dared to laugh.

      revisit the Anenberg Collection at the Met., saw I Am My Own Wife. view of the Plaza and Tiffany's... this is what i wanted to say: blog this. stay away: this is called the letting go of bob strategy. white paper tears on the train. the orient express ran over me. a drop of mustard in the palm, the radio on. it is dark, it is light, it is frightening. letting go: letting go: letting go. come June, come June, but from now, from now on. somebody can be letting go... somebody can be letting go... no one will know. goodbye from now. goodbye. well, i like your voice and i love you and come june i will still mean it, but see, i've got my girl here and you're far and up there and not viable and all. baby in my dream, warm to my chest, afraid it would die, not drink my milk, baby in my dream. this is medusa--her notes and she is alone. to be alone: not a big deal. not a big deal at all.  the people came to her and she couldn't stand it, but when she was alone she couldn't stand it either. she couldn't sing alone or together. either way, it's done, over. and it's nice to hear that you're doing well--the scene and all, and music and hell. and it's so nice to hear--but there, how can i sleep? how can i sleep when you wake me? i will sleep forever. goodbye--letting go of bob. goodbye bob. goodbye b--

      bought Brothers K. will this book change my life?  the red tent, herzog, the castle...why three books at once? wonder what would be left if i had my own thoughts...just pity for her. i can't of him b/c i just can't. he doesn't belong in my life and if i try and put him there, i will be putting more hell in it. arriving at hotel 31 is lonely. give me music, make it less lonely. anything to distract me, anything to make me feel warm--but music brings nostalgia or pain or memories or tears and happy music makes me sad and nothing is left untouched. my back hurts. could it be that i have nothing left to say?

      "I should have thought he was asleep himself, if it hadn't been for the quivering of his fingers. His hand fluttered in mine like a captured bird." -from André Gide's _The Counterfeiters_ (1925) p. 97, translated from the French by Dorothy Bussy. "J'aurais cru qu'il dormait lui-même, sans le frémissement de ses doigts ; sa main palpitait comme un oiseau dans la mienne" (101). André Gide, _Les faux-monnayeurs_ and then: "Psychological analysis lost all interest for me from the moment that I became aware that men feel what they imagine they feel. From that to thinking that they imagine they feel what they feel was a very short step...!"   Mom met J.G.: said he'd love to speak with me--Mom have number, wow, will he ever call ;) yeah right.   Would have loved to be a guy, friends with Jay, Jamie, Ryan, etc... Gigi is sooo cute (sala pages) i'm a snooper ;)  Here: titration, walking, language learning: little steps and then what is perceived to be a leap!!! Yes, it is true, nature never leaps:  See Gide's Counterfeiter's, p. 288: "Gradation; gradation, and then a sudden leap... Natura  non fecit saltus . What absurd rubbish! As for me, I am like the Arab in the desert who is dying of thirst. I am at the precise point, you see when a drop of water might still save him...or a tear..."  I want to dance...

      Chopin's Polonaise la flat major Opus 53: have to listen to it b/c it was in my head. that sweeping refrain...like a giant in my mind...it gives me something no one can. this music so divine. where is G-d? my room is in my head is a mess. listened to Ian's piece on Sunday...the first one: the middle part always makes me cry with its eerie softness and unresolved echoing despair...let me go, it says and then, with the confusing ending, so loud and unbearable, all faith dissolves--and the beauty of tenderness with it.

      so what was he supposed to do? laugh, stop talking, choke? even if he knew he could have made it, he would have stopped right there in front of the slope of the knife. a two inch book of spells with a warning not to put in the hands of children. collect my blood. I suffer because I can. I am not starving so I suffer more. what would life be without pain? at the corner of the street, she sat, her legs spread open, purple chains around her waist. heavy mascara made her eyes inhuman. she didn't know why she was still alive. would I write a whole story? I cannot freely express myself. I must be quiet because if I tell, there will be hell. I’d rather write nonsense than substance. I want so much to be with one person but that's not an occupation. That’s deranged for sure. I want, I want, and whenever I get back down I want it more than ever. It’s like I’m down just to feel that need. It’s desperate and I can't believe in myself anymore.  Matt just asked about the spanking case: really January 2004? I’m leaving for NYC on Thursday. Did you know greyhound and train cost the same? Well, greyhound is not as comfortable or is it? And it also is a shorter ride, but what should I do? I wanted to come into grand central, feel the stars riding on my eyes, my body feeling cleaner than it is but Penn station is such a wreck--is it 33rd street that looks like a garbage dump or maybe that's all the streets. lol. So, what do I once I get there, fall into your arms like a little baby? cry like a duck and let myself go. no, ok, here goes: I’m meeting Peter in the McConnell courtyard for lab treats on Wednesday at 2. lol. and Matt wants me to do his hmk ? law school--how can they write in that way without giving everyone a headache?  so now, I know what to do.  I build myself a truck, make sure the wheels are safe, straighten by back temporarily--can I have more bones there pls--and be good. I’d do anything to be free but that's not being human and I’d do anything to do well, but that's not always possible. I’m chatting in the dark, without air, without fear, without care. i've got to live longer than this, to see something better than this, to see the flower arranging in spring, to collect the Kyoto cherry blossoms in my palm’s heart and know when to stop. I have to live longer than this, to see the real sun hit your real green eyes and make me fall into your daze.  I can't breathe because I can't believe: your green eyes. leaf in my heart. heart should be replaced with another word. I need to write to Marina, Ayshe, Birkir I love you!, Tricia, Jieun, Randolph, Mark, Nat for her story, Y with my CV ?, Marina again...., Will yeah right, Tami...?, Colin (sp?), BLOOM!!!!!!!!, I’m sure there are others I can't think of now...why!!!? I’m deaf, blind, I get out and see people it's like being blinded by the sun as you come out of dark room...now I remember: CHRIS...seriously, once I know for sure, i'll write them all...start driving, toastmastering lol, dancing, violin--yeah met Jamie G. and if I work on it I can call him call June to play my violin and he the piano...c'mon you know what you have to do...oh yeah, I want to be part of this world, for G-d's sake, but I think I have to be what I have to be--it's true: English lit. is my calling...it's like IDM is my calling. hoobastank the reason

      U of T's campus is beautiful. I must read history as I would a text for clues as to why we have come to this... Concrete for miles and miles, nothing free, nothing natural anymore, no peace, only terror, and anxiety to succeed, loneliness and pain--but most of all the buildings that hurt the land and the heart... Destroying nature's beauty, we destroy our soul. Art must embrace nature, not crush it. Can't read the evil Brothers K, am now reading Middlemarch and was struck by the Zionist theme when I watched the film of Daniel Deronda on Masterpiece Theater's --moved me to believe more strongly in my Jewish soul.

      i saw a swan  on the water between concrete.  her orange beak, her winding neck, her black wide eyes led me to her dark child. what was her secret in loneliness?  how could she bear the blue of the lake with its bitterness, the dark water of her  pond beside it with a nuclear power plant nearby?  she was more  human than i but more like a swan ready to fly--   to give us what we need-- a smattering of red on concrete and white wings.

      read "The Middle Years" by James: "We work in the dark - we do what we can - we give what we have," it read. "Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art."   "Her pursuit of the origins of quotations was dogged and often ingenious. In stalking a Henry James phrase she wanted to include in the 15th edition, she considered skimming his entire works, but chanced upon a magazine article about Truman Capote that attributed the lines to "The Middle Years," an autobiography of James.   She read the entire book and could not find the lines. Then she noticed a little editor's note at the very end, saying James had taken the title from his short story of the same name. She got a complete collection of James's stories and found the quotation on the next to last page.   "We work in the dark - we do what we can - we give what we have," it read. "Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art."   Mr. Beck died in 1969. Mrs. Beck is survived by her sister, Catharine Cooper, of Islington, England; her sons Cameron, of Canton, and Gordon, of Larchmont, N.Y.; her daughter, Emily M. Beck, of Larchmont; and three grandchildren.   Her helpers on Bartlett's ranged far beyond the academic experts hired by Little, Brown. The organist at her church told her that the correct title of Thomas Grey's poem was "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard," not "Elegy in a Country Churchyard," as every edition since John Bartlett had claimed.

The moon shone down as it will On moments of deep introspection. The wind held its breath. And look, somebody left a mirror leaning against a tree. Making sure that I was alone, I took off my shirt. The flowers of bear grass nodded their moonwashed heads. I took off my pants and the magpies circled the redwoods. Down in the valley the creaking river was flowing once more. How strange that I should stand in the wilds alone with my body. I know what you are thinking. I was like you once. But now With so much before me, so many emerald trees, and Weed-whitened fields, mountains and lakes, how could I not Be only myself, this dream of flesh, from moment to moment?                    *************************************** >From BLIZZARD OF ONE by Mark Strand. © 1998 by Mark Strand.

"I don't want to hold you, I don't want to hold you down." so we didn't get into that new club, Atlantis. you knew it was under water anyway. what do i do to give you who i am? and then if i did, it would hurt more because you're leaving before i find out who i am. i can't deal with this. i just can't deal. we'll go our merry ways now.  and i saw you from the seats--Elvis, no you, and i thought i wouldn't be able to take the steps up.  "i walk everywhere," you said and i would have done anything to invite you in and  redeem your pleasure in my room.  flowers in the dark--all joy finds its veins in flowers in the dark and dies as they do, in too strong sun.  go, be hidden. you will never find me again.

       urlLink Yale University > 2004 Commencement > Baccalaureate Address   Richard H. Brodhead, Dean of Yale College Baccalaureate Address Woolsey Hall May 23, 2004 Some Words on Outcomes as You Go Out  President Levin and I entered upon our current positions on the same day eleven years ago. At our ten previous baccalaureates, I, an English professor, have read literary passages to graduates as they go forward. For those same ten years, Richard Levin, a professor of Economics, has felt the gnawing pangs of passage envy, aching to escape the rigors of the dismal science for the pleasures of literature. This year, in an academic transvestitism seldom before witnessed, I have magnanimously allowed President Levin to wear the glory robes of poetry. Encourage the boy: didn't he do well?  Actually, what I just said was false. Here is the truth. I myself will be going out with the Class of 2004. I too came to Yale College expecting to spend four years; but through a decimal point placement error only recently detected, I instead spent forty. In recognition of my belated departure, President Levin has invited me to give the speech that he usually gives at the Baccalaureate. That is real magnanimity, and I thank him most sincerely. Is there life after Yale? I admit that it's a novel concept. But as with the traces of water recently found on Mars, the signs are newly encouraging.  Friends of '04, I note that you are dressed in black. Why the gloom? I suppose I know. You are dressed in mourning for the fact that your revels are all ended, and the life and friendships formed here about to dissolve. Four years ago, when we last gathered in this room, your college years seemed to stretch infinitely far before you. Well, infinity does not last as long as it used to, for here you are already, with only few grains remaining to pass through the hourglass before your college life is done.   Or might I guess that for some, your suits of woe bespeak a deeper gloom? At a freshman assembly some years back, I had the experience, like a bad dentist, of jabbing a nerve straight on. On that occasion I told of students who had confided that they thought they has been admitted to Yale by mistake. As I said this, at least eight hundred freshmen gasped as if I had divined their inmost secret. It's thrilling for a speaker to wield such power - so with a sadism unbecoming to a dean, the dentist will venture another probe.  As for the robes of gloom: could it be that one or more of you have arrived at the end of your ride here with your future plans still a perfect blank? Might there be some who have plans but know deep down that what you've signed up for is a perfect figleaf, marginally covering and only temporarily postponing exposure of your scandalous nakedness of real life plans? Haunted by this uncertainty, might there be one or more of you who have had twinges of feeling that - as the Yale Precision Marching Band chants to opposing goalies in Ingalls Rink - It's All Your Fault: all Yale's fault for having failed to provide you with a single marketable skill? If students in the room have not yet felt this, there may be some in the upper balconies who have, or will. Some while back I met a woman in Southern California (I name no names) who revealed that she had not one but two Yalie sons who had come back home after graduation to a new life, not quite what she expected, of getting up late, eating bizarre amounts of cereal, and watching reruns on TV; and who, when pressed about what they might want to go out and do, glared the unspoken words: Don't Go There.  If anyone in this room resonates to this description, I have a message for you: it's going to be all right. Is it any wonder if the end of college should produce a pause before you find the onward way? For the great majority of you, the end of college marks the end of a far longer stretch (for some it began in the days after birth) in which your life has been defined by the fact that you were in school. Since kindergarten or preschool, school was where you spent the day. School was the answer to the question what you were doing with your life. (Remember the convenience of this? Question: what are you doing with your life? Answer: I'm still in school.) A succession of schools set you your annual tasks and challenges. And school said what came next - more school, of course: after fifth grade, sixth; after high school, college.   Now, for the first time, you are about to step out of that structured life into the abyss of the undetermined. No wonder if it's disorienting - what else would it be? But another name for life unstructured in advance is freedom, and other words for the life lived in that territory are independence, maturity, and adulthood. Welcome to them. Will it be beyond your power to orient yourself in that world, find your way in it and make something good of it? In bad moments it may seem so; but think back to your arrival here. When you came ashore at your last terra incognita, you may have felt at a loss, but then something kicked in - some mix of courage, spirit, curiosity, and desire - that helped you go forward to meet this unknown place, engage its challenges, and make it your own.   Do I doubt that the same thing will happen again when you leave here? I do not; you've done little these last four years to make me think of you as helpless or resourceless. I saw the mother from California recently, and when I asked about her sons, I learned not only that they had gone on to absorbing and fulfilling things but that she had no recollection of their homebound or deadbeat stage. The early modern philosopher Bacon wrote: " they are ill discoverers who think there is no land, when they can see nothing but sea." So with you: the solid land of a good life is out there for you, however little you can discern its shape or shores. Courage: the strengths that brought you this far will bring you to it yet. And when you find it, you'll learn that you've carried all kinds of valuable things forward from this place, however little they may be visible as assets now.   In recent years there has been much discussion in this country about the need to identify goals and measure outcomes in education. I do not wholly disagree with this mode of thinking as it applies to elementary education. In our world, the cost of allowing young kids to move forward without having mastered fundamental skills is simply too high. But I am much more skeptical about outcomes-based theories as they apply to the kind of education you have received. What we have put you through here has involved some element of marking things to be learned, making you learn them, then measuring to see if you did in fact learn them. But that did not yield what was most worth getting here.   One limit of the outcomes concept of education is that it treats acquisitions as fixed that can prove in fact quite transient. Every one of you has mastered complex subject fields sufficiently to display that knowledge on cue on a final exam only to have it begin seeping from your brain soon thereafter. By a conservative estimate, the things members of the Class of 2004 collectively learned in Yale courses that you have already forgotten is probably equal to the sum of human knowledge gained since the early Renaissance. Parents shocked at this statement are welcome to come onstage, where I will subject you to a public quiz on Ohm's law, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the workings of the passive subjunctive future tense, or other outcomes you once reached to great applause before relapsing into the contented ignorance of today.   Such inevitable forgetting is not a scandal in education because the original act of learning taught something more deeply valuable and left a deeper trace: trained deep habits of mind that survive the specific content that was originally attached to them and can then be put to a different use. When the Duke of Wellington said that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, he did not mean, I think, that organized sport consciously or purposely taught the arts of war. He meant that deep skills learned at hazard in one world, that of play - skills like physical courage, working together in teams, coordinating strategies over space and time in a way that requires continual improvisation and revision in face of changing circumstances - these skills turned out, in ways wholly unforeseeable at the time of their acquisition, to serve a second function, equipping a later self to act in a context radically different from the one where the skills were learned.   In an office I was given the use of at Duke a few weeks ago someone had posted this saying from Ruskin: "The highest reward of a person's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes through it." That comes closer to my own philosophy of education, since to my mind, the real outcome to aspire to is the building of the self - a process that does not lend itself to authoritative measure because it is never over and because its ways are oblique. Whatever we pretended course by course and week by week, what Yale really required was that you use its challenges and resources to develop your latent powers and build the more capable you. If you can't yet say what what you learned here is good for, that's because you are not yet in the place where it will show its value and help. The fruits of the deeper education only reveal themselves in time, as a life's and history's emerging challenges - like the Napoleonic Wars unforeseen in the youth of Wellington - call forth their stores of strength.   Could I be more specific about the equipment I see you carrying forward, possibly unbeknownst to yourselves? Men and women of the Class of 2004, you have done a lot of homework. There are 1300 of you and you each took 36 courses running for twelve and one half weeks. Equipped with these facts, I tried to estimate how many books you have collectively read, papers and lab reports you have written, and problem sets you have worked, but my brain got tired before I got the answer. I congratulate you on your colossal diligence, but now that it's behind you, it might be safe to reveal a secret. The point of all that homework was not for you to complete it, but rather, through this exercise, to develop powers that can only show their value when the days of assigned work are past.   In my life I've met people who seemed absolutely to have stopped thinking at a certain point, and to be living on a stock of frozen opinions as limited and antiquated as their aging wardrobes. I cannot promise that this will not happen to you, but I pray that it won't, and if you escape this fate, the work you did here will have helped protect you against it. With luck, years of artificial school exercises will have developed an instinctive drive to keep identifying and assimilating new sources of information and subjecting them analysis and synthesis - dispositions now sufficiently rooted in your nature that they can carry on without external or institutional support. So internalized, the habits that made you a good student in early life can begin to make you something more interesting and more important: an ongoing student of your world and a constructive contributor to its needs.  At Yale academic education never takes place by itself, however, but in energizing interaction with a certain social environment. We've provided you with a thousand classmates, like you in skill and thoughtfulness but bizarrely various in their origins, outlooks, commitments and beliefs, to live with in intimate community and daily exchange. It's my profound hope that the form of sociability you have become accustomed these last four years will prove habit-forming as well, and that you will seek and recreate this sociability on your own when an institution ceases to provide it for you.   As you know, the Brown v. Board of Education decision ending court-legitimated school segregation was handed down fifty years ago this week. But for all the changes it has made, this country is far from having solved the problems of social separation and inequality. It will be for your generation to make progress on these fronts, unless, which God forbid, you fail to make that progress. The role of the well educated here is not altogether reassuring, since as much as any group, the well educated have tended to live and work in enclaves with those who are comparably privileged. Hard to see how that isolation will be of much help with problems of which, nevertheless, all will suffer the consequences. But perhaps the battle for an inclusive society of equal rights and mutual respect will turn out to have been won - or if not won, in some measure advanced - on the intramural playing fields of Yale or in the rooms of Vanderbilt or Bingham or the dining halls of Silliman or TD, scenes of interactions and understandings won across social divides. I have always regarded the intellectual cost of separationism to be as great in its way as its social cost. In this country, those who have stopped thinking are typically those who have stopped interacting with people who might make them think - people, namely, who do not already think more or less the same as they do. With luck you will seek the educating differences others shun, without necessarily remembering where you formed that taste.  Last let me say a word about the idea of service. A loveable feature of this school is its culture of other-directedness, the generosity with which you regard your gifts as existing not for yourself alone, but also for the good of others. I've seen you, unknown to your teachers and for no conceivable credit, working with neighborhood kids in sports camps, or giving music or health lessons or making science cool in local schools; I know of your efforts in this and other countries on behalf of the sick, the poor, the uneducated and the displaced; I know what you have done within these walls to make this community's life more interesting and more rewarding. When college's somewhat artificial world of organized activity dissolves behind you, as it will, I trust it will leave a seed in place for future growth, the habit of using your intelligence to enrich the lives of others. Numbers of you will go to work in teaching, in community health, in environmental causes, and in government service, and I praise you, but those are not the only ways this start could be extended. The world needs every known profession (well, almost every); and in every profession there is a way of practicing that is small-minded and self-serving and another that serves the larger good. Whatever you do, I look to you to make that difference: the best legacy you could take from Yale.  Men and Women of the Class of 2004, you leave here for the valley of uncertainty also known as life. If that brings anxiety, it also brings opportunity, the chance to make a life - and you will. A poet in your class whose words I prophesy you will soon be hearing - David Goren, Trumbull '04 - has written these lines, spoken as to a graduating senior by a soon-to-be-former beloved named Ivy:  I confess, I've grown attached to you -  But now we both have other walls to climb. Growing is something you'll be doing As long as you live, and you should learn to do it elsewhere than the paradise I made for you, imperfect as it was. He's right. You came here, you saw, and you overcame. You grew into this place, you grew up here, and you grew strong here. Now it's time to break its bounds to win room to grow some more. If Yale wanted anything for you, it was to nourish and confirm your will to grow, growth that will continue though we must leave, now, to allow it to continue.  Do you understand me? I think you do. All right then: Let's get out of here.

      Toxic by BS  This poem is dedicated to you: Pierce May 12th, 2004 at the club: Pravda, Luzern, Pierce: tight black shirt, jeans, two friends: one named Stefan or Sylvan? blond straight hair, dark green eyes, a bit tanned, an 8 pack, i swear, arms so hard and strong--Tarzan, anyone? MBA graduate--job interview the morning before the party.  ok: here i go Pierce.  i should have whispered in your ear: "tell me what you want me to do, i'd do anything."  we moved together, the pressure greater than the breath of swan wings, your hands on my waist felt like mountains. i pressed my neck to your lips and didn't draw away  until you had left the mark. swans' necks craning for love, craning for the shining forests in your eyes-- i cannot forget you, but you left me as i was starting to be afraid of what i felt. what can i do but remember your kisses as you held my cheek towards you, taking my mouth into yours? it was so hard then to be in my body that i forgot my name. i was dirty, you were clean. i had to leave. i should have whispered: "i'd do anything..." dirty swan cleaning my nails, Medusa, severed at the neck  by her prince Perseus: oh--your victory--i would have let you  do anything in that green daze.

      Dearest Natalya:  I miss you more than ever. Each day, I listen to conversations about money and deals and contracts and money, then scotch whiskey on Fridays and weekends of parties in which rich lawyers who work 24 hour days play golf or eat lobsters flown in from Nova Scotia and think about nothing at all because they can't any more.  How are you? Please tell me when you can. I hope you are taking some rest. It was so good to see you and talk to you again. I loved meeting your whole family and wish i could have chatted with them...   For some reason, I am not receiving any more poems from Knopf. I'll have to ask them about that... As for music, I've come to the conclusion that The Beatles rock the whole world. ;)  Here's a stupid poem I wrote just now...impulsively, i'm sending it to you. Most of it doesn't make sense (bad excuse: because i listen to 'sensible negotiations' each day):  "it's as if... no, like... no, as if, i never sent you anything-- no record of a breaking spoon, orange balloon in your mail, darling. i've locked you up, retrained my brain to see without your eyes inside my palms upon waking. can you live on  a poem? a fast thick poem that stinks of marshmallows and softener. oh the white taste, the alien couch, the expensive scotch, the justice league and the questions i cannot answer because they are so simple that i think too much about them. reciting Rilke in the dark, crying over that life with you. i'd say: "oh, i thought you'd need me but i cannot live without you." in losing my spirit, i eat money and deals, mergers and wheels  and my poetry, never good, now hurts to read. they say: "greed." watching a dragonfly dancing over your rainbow pond, a miracle in this world, saffron and cardamom, cinnamon and myrrh, in a new church with windows as big as cradles and candles of burning fingernails, i've caught you  inside this book. the pages rustle, crumble and turn."  I'm coming slowly back to creation and will read your stories soon without pain...  Sending you all the best.  Love and Hugs, Anny.

      i live on chocolate as a fairy. they say darker is best.  i few days ago, i dreamt about my Armenian piano teacher.   he kissed me before i gave my best performance.  on the forehead where the star awaits me, i want him.  can i believe in anything beautiful without feeling pain?  i have no art in me, secrecy and sex is my only territory.  i can give you love. that's all you need, right?  Medusa's way on a Florentine grave, Perseus a great, grand criminal, i'd conquer.  i'll have to stay awake to fuck you, i'll have to wear my skin.  how do i begin to give you what they want if they don't know what i can give?  i sell the apples without the seed, the sunset without the fire, the water without the peace.  can you come near me, stop talking about money, let me touch you there?  your code of ethics, your grand religion, your tight belt keep you good.  i wanted to release freedom, the way the light hits me, the way i'll never mean love.  i would eat the cherries in Kyoto as the sun traps my silence in the fur of your tongue.  your kiss was clean so that i felt in my body and that it had one soul.  swan neck, dirty neck, clean bathroom, clean word,  i'll leave you by the lake, with the clearness left in it, a cutting blond arm.

      it was natural the way the eyes swept onto those flowers that smell strongest at night, purple in between the white frills to make the front look nice. in the mirror swept with Victorian haze--almost the color of mercury fazing into lead, you could see a black figure that had shrunken into a skeleton. bones branched out of the figure and a yellow hue on the face of it made the color of the bluish sky paler. it had ended up being cooler as the land laid itself into evening. it was almost the Solstice, coming to almost the heavy rain of a barren word that leads into limp suicides. of course, it didn't matter. of course, if they asked you what you felt, you would say, i'm stuck in a city that i never liked the first place. there's nowhere to go but around and around and around and back to the end. if as cool as nature it is, as cool as nature it was. a heavy lidded eye forgotten by the sun, a word that enervated its followers, an option to leave the incinerator on, a closing of a wor(l)d: _The Sun Also Rises_ would have been his. what a bloody birthday. sickening now, i'll need to burn it. Jake, the main character, lost his dick in the war. this is the end:    "Oh, Jake," Brett said, "we could have had such a damned good time together."     Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his baton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me.     "Yes," I said, "Isn't it pretty to think so?"                     THE END.

I love you NS, girl. do you know that? why do i never read your stories, thesis, or write you in time? i suck.  garbage...medication...garbage.  sweeping the dust with my shirt off all my life. that's my job, G-d. take me to Mishima for his lesson.

       urlLink Turner watercolorist sublime - Tour of Switzerland   Hello from Lucerne. I wanted that peace to happen. Be something. Every day, i want to hurt myself, to burn, cut, stab, smoke, go out and sell my body. Every day, I hear how I fail. How can I go on? Lucerne. There was something about the way you held me: I knew I could never be wrong again. Lucerne. I'm going back because if I can't: where will I go? It's me trying to walk on your water and feel my soul wet with passion, with ideals, with action. I need to do, not to be. Even if it hurts me. Please.

I've written a couple of pieces on you for the  local paper, but they all seemed to be disparaging: the editor wants to know why you dissimulate while holding others to an impossible standard of honesty. I've been advised not to send this.  I thought you were being paranoid as you asked me to take myself off the news, but now I know it was just your favorite technique to get me started... Hope you're having a great time with Wanda. Don't worry if the goldfish want to eat you. They can't without my poison in their gills. But, i'm coming soon to help them. Grin. Have you heard...?

      you called me by the morning rain, a right animal without road killing, eating the leaves from your land. nothing laughs harder than love, a fistful of containment and promise.  in your genius, you miscalculated your spending allowance, and started too many love renewals.  i'd be here for you as a butterfly for its cocaine, watching the blue moon eat the sunrise into eternity.  honey, you talk as if you know more than i do about lying, but this time, i want to open before dying to some man like you.  tomorrow, i'll walk to work, or exercise, work as an angel does, feel the love if there is any there my dear, have a smoke into oblivion, clean my room, make preparations to leave forever.  if i could love you, i would.  i've said so many things to make you walk away. you're holding on because you can't lose in this affair.  must i be so cynical? maybe your heart is true. only you could know. and what you don't tell me is nothing at all.  be clean, be free, talk little, do much.  and since you are wanting me, i have to still be as good as you think i am. i'm into the highest risk investment. look good, be there.  i need to make extra money and be a stripper. is that so bad? i'll need to exercise a bit more. yeah, you go girl.

       urlLink 'To Say Before Going To Sleep' :: A poem by Rainer Maria Rilke :: PoetryConnection.net   To Say Before Going to Sleep by Rilke  I would like to sing someone to sleep, have someone to sit by and be with. I would like to cradle you and softly sing, be your companion while you sleep or wake. I would like to be the only person in the house who knew: the night outside was cold. And would like to listen to you and outside to the world and to the woods.  The clocks are striking, calling to each other, and one can see right to the edge of time. Outside the house a strange man is afoot and a strange dog barks, wakened from his sleep. Beyond that there is silence.  My eyes rest upon your face wide-open; and they hold you gently, letting you go when something in the dark begins to move.

      what can you do to control your illness? a shot of vodka, and again. i'm out of words for pain.  let me go back to Rilke and curl into his lap.  if i wake up tomorrow, i won't know what to do.  i have such a pain in my center that i'd cut it out if i could.  the spaces here are so grand that i feel suffocated.  i want one room--one room of peace.  i must pace inside this room to lose the dirt of my back, center and lips.  fuck you to hell. fuck you. i can't believe i ever thought i could get off sleeping with you.  "in this silence"--Sarah McLachlan and Delerium's "Silence"  "Give me release, witness me: I am outside, give me peace.  Heaven holds a sense of wonder and I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides.  Passion choke the flower 'til she cries no more possessing all the beauty, hungry still for more.  Heaven holds a sense of wonder... and I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides.  In this white wave, I am sinking, in this silence, in this white wave, in this silence I believe.  I can't help this longing: comfort me. I can't hold it all in if you won't let me.  Heaven holds a sense of wonder...  In this white wave, I am sinking, in this silence, in this white wave, in this silence I believe.  I have seen you in this white wave: you are silent, you are breathing in this white wave I am free.

       urlLink Rilke: New Poems   before going to sleep by Rilke...  i live for the last arcs of Christmas, despair in the word of my mother's left eye. one day, the snow will cover the sword, cut the blue fingers who touch what they cannot feel. oh, how i held you without thinking about love and then, when the next dawn came, love had evaporated into the soft mist of the Roman poplars. i remember his travels as if they were mine and  i could only show you myself through my body for i am nothing without it. do not linger on the absurdity of this world, on the cruelty of feeling. reach into the moss where the earth lies and blacken your fingernails to scratch the pure marble of perceived perfection. he is nothing  without it and you must destroy it with black strong veins.

      shoes in the hall, black blisters to the right, i could have taken you for food, as strawberries dipped in wine. your caffeine-free green tea, your perfect library of books and CDs, the neatness of your desk, floor and bed, the view from inside your heart. if i had a body, i would give it to you. fast beginning fast ending. but, as you rationalized--we've known each other for one month already. i see you standing, taut, on the edge of how, your light brown eyes inside your open palms.  i have knelt down to wash your feet, as if the demons had left me, and i would take your eyes into  mine in perfect symmetry of passion and pain if i knew that i had nothing to fear but death. in your hand, i could have found relief from the tears of Brahms' chords, the tenderness of fingers of the world inside a sound of God. silence is free and your words are as true as rose petals strewn over the sidewalk cracks awaiting the warm white rain.  Concert Gala Vendredi 4 Juin Brahms' Concerto no 2 en si bemol majeur, opus 83--if you hear the Andante, you will walk with feet steeled for flight above the family of your dreams inside the kiss of life. (Sergei Salov played--he won the Concours Musical International de Montreal) Peter also loved Jacques Hetu's "Impromptu pour piano, opus 70 and Ravel's Alborada del Gracioso. i also loved Prokofiev's Concerto no. 3 in do major, opus 26.  "where did you get this body?" you asked me at least twice. inside your dreams. the smooth body of cupid is yours. paint us here, before the dance falls.  troglodyte vituperate sybaritic  you played the first act of Wagner's Parsifal--the CD with Peter and the Wolf. oh, your body was a marble statue of naked Cupid.  you told me: "you are so beautiful." but, love cannot be? why am i so sad? you are leaving--will i ever see you again, the way you said i would...? i can't count on it. no matter what, you will be dear to me always. you said: my one wish is to "have a family" and you asked me to live with you over the summer...even to marry you, lol. of course, our last contract was to "go with the flow." the feeling i have of tears during Brahms' andante. it will pass like a kite through the leaves, barely touching their veins.  if you have more time to think, you will think against me--though my whole soul is for you as an angel emerging out of the tulip's purple petals into violent dusk. i cannot have but true feeling for you. your warm skin and statuesque form remind me that Casanova's figures can be given life. Galatea lived once, too. G-d Bless you all. mother working in the garden with a smile on her face...the birds chirping at 4 a.m. have a place in this too. xox to you, Peter.  of course, your reply contains no such xox. the joke's on me. cruelty is in everyone, a burning desire to vanquish the one who holds your heart.   you have exercised your right, as a tiger would, extinct in your precision, wise in your decision to shut me out. why not be prudent with a fat girl like me? fuck you, too, honey, and take your stupid dick elsewhere. have a nice life.  i have the honey ingrained in my leaves, a moment of hell needed to deceive, a heart through a wire festering on a spear of hope. you have the  cleanest cuts, the words protected from pain, the olive skin for the desert sun. what have i done? given myself away as a drummer  crashes his drum, washed your feet as a sinner washes those of Sin. bitter, my blisters multiplying in the growing heat, i walk away from the idea of you, almost protected now from further surprise, feeling sick enough to kill what little love i have left. i should have struck you instead of kissed you, and in the dark, taken your soul to cast into the flames. what have i now but regrets? what have i now but the  certainty of further pain?

(yeah, so now i see you for dinner--you won't give me your lab number!-to celebrate your residence acceptance with Mr. Kissinger on the board, HELLo and then a stupid concert...somebody give me a new body with new clothes!) so you sent me stuff, i was just thinking about sending you Billy Budd or more to the point, a short story, Bartelby the Scrivener...then we're even....the angels are screaming: fight me! and it's sad how many people are counting on me for a reply: natalya, kim, birkir, contiki bunch, chris, etc... ok, i feel like i'm getting ahead of myself here. you breed lies like gadflies. the blood punches through.

      "to keep from falling...shoes...here burning..."  On the day she found out he was really a girl, she decided not to cry. It was raining in the sunshine outside on a Sunday. She walked the streets in search of a cheap predictably sexy dress for a wedding she might not attend. Micki--that name he had used over and over again, his dear friend. Well, had she ever been given the chance to see his translucence, his vibrations and defiance? No--his name was Micki. He had hid behind his fake dick.  In the corner of her white bathroom, a spider quivered. She shot herself an unsteady look in the mirror, realizing he would not call her again.  When it came time to scrub her teeth, she felt the wetness on the top of her thumb. The spider had hid away and she searched the gray sky and brick from her dirt framed window. Nothing.  She could still go to sleep and wake up tomorrow.  There was a quiet sniffle from across the way. Perhaps her neighbor was reading on the porch, getting ready to recreate.   Give me incense as charity, she thought. Give me anything but that stale smell of a weed tower memory--she and R taking that joint and fulfilling R's fantasy of doing it high.   Why does every man have a fantasy he can describe so mercilessly? You've satisfied that one, they say. Or will you satisfy this one? Who will, the next? I won't be there.  The light went on in the room across her window. A fat framed figure appeared and sat, face blocked by the screen. Often, she would walk nude into her bathroom.   She cupped water to spit out toothpaste and any other stupid thing she had not eaten.  She would not try to open her mouth tomorrow. Those catatonic patients had taught her how to break up desire. Even when they coughed, they made no sound. Nor when they choked or needed to die.  A few blocks away, rich people were getting ready to party if their party won. Well, what the hell? She would have joined a pity party anyway. Every one had looked so good going off to vote, their make-up perfectly done, their eyes hidden by dark glasses. They were famous in their heads.  She would have needed to run a hundred miles to win for her own party. How stupid could she be? Alone, she would burn all her books and write something no one would see.

Then save me, or the passed day will shine Upon my pillow, breeding many woes,--   Save me from curious Conscience, that still lords Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole;    Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards, And seal the hushed Casket of my Soul.  Oh, Keats, dying overlooking the Spanish Steps, feeding us poppies from his grave.

      July 30, 2004 Because I could, I started my sentence with because and had a child called Marcia. She looked like Elvis in the good days and never spoke a bad word to Mamma. I treated her like a princess and made sure she had strawberry bubble-baths every frigging day. She was older than me in no time and loved to tell me stories about her sexual conquests. I would just sit back and listen to her winding voice meander through the convolutions of my alcohol soaked brain, in awe of her beauty of both mind and body. I must confess, whenever she moved, I found myself looking at her, obsessed with her blond ringlets shining in both the rain and the sun. She was my only baby and she treated me sweetly. I didn’t feel in any way inconvenienced by her desires and fell asleep soundly each night she stayed at home. When she was four, she left home to conquer the big wide world with her big blue eyes. She would write to me from Paris, then from Rome, then from London, and so on and so forth about meeting famous people in the business. She learned everything from the Can-Can to the Rachmaninov 3 during her travels: she was professional in everything she did. Although she never did return home to Blueville, she remained my fervent admirer and would sign her letters with an effusive flourish of both penmanship and wording: “I love you, Darling. Send my regards to your whole body, your Marcia Baby.” She wrote me once from Switzerland, from some spa— I’ve forgotten it’s name—where she was staying with a beautiful banker of the dark flavored variety, that she had given up chocolate for good and was playing the violin as well as Paganini would have if he had been blessed with six fingers on his left hand...

      I chatted with Tricia in Oxford for the first time in months and her younger sister's married in St. P with a 7 month year old girl named Rada. She's going out with this M.A. student in History named Masatake and the world is perfect. I found her perfect letters in the Renoir book. I feel as if i'm losing my faith in the watch towers...England: "chronic alcoholics, godless.."  Some older guy from my Dad's congregation or whatever introduced me to his kids as i was walking on Greene Ave. yesterday. He said i saw me dance up at storm at that Boccelli wedding...oh did i? Well he didn't see me in Luzern...hah.   urlLink HYPERCOM.ca - love Dear Mr. A:  Somebody told me that to pass the time, you must stop breathing.  Of course, when youre dead, you pass the time beautifully. If feels as if someone hit me in the head with a sledge hammer.  In the dream I was about to go to IDMs concert and then I realized I should fix my hair and use the bathroom. For some reason, I thought the bathroom was outside the concert hall. I go out again into this deserted street in New York City. It happens to be quite cold outside and windy. Perhaps we are in Autumn--is it November? And as I walk out, I see no one on the street---this deserted street, except the man I saw before, a tall dark figure waiting in a light beige trench coat near a lamppost with a heavy long black rolled-up umbrella. I notice him looking straight at me and then I realize it is finished for me. He runs towards me and it is clear he is wearing a black mask over his face. It is also clear that he is about to lunge at me with his heavy black umbrella--to impale me. I cry out: No, please dont kill me. Take my body instead. He does not speak but motions with his hand, stopping in his tracks, at which point five or six muscular men in tight white T-shirts encircle me. I know what they will do and I cannot look at them. I cannot feel anything but nausea sweeping over and through me. I cannot even swallow. Then, more women appear seemingly in the same position as me, with muscular men surrounding them, ready to take their bodies and do what they will with them. I know that rape is not the only activitythey will try to kill us as well. But to be raped over and overdoes that not amount to death? To pass the time Somehow, light is added to the image and I find myself still prostrated in front of the men who watch over us, but now on grass. I cannot remember their conversation  but I remember thinking, as their banter heats up, that I can escape. I run so fast I cannot see, right back into the reappearing buildingthe light is almost the light of the fire and I see IDM. I slink underneath a table, trembling, but still he catches my eye, as he sits up front, overseeing the show. At the endthere were only five minutes left of some jazzy music with three girls in gaudy costumes doing some sort of Can-Can inspired danceI run to him and crouch in a corner, hiding. I think he puts his hand over my head as I hunch over in a feral attitude, in a rabbit's stance, not knowing how to breathe. He is wearing blue and his face is dissolving into his glasses and mouth. I do not remember what happens next and then I wake up.   I grope my way out my dream. The rest of the day is spent determining how much I shouldnt eat and... Then, I get the alarm about my fever and I cannot do anything but fall into bed. I rule out the fact that I have taken in too much German wine. The blue bottle with Germanic lettering sits empty on the counter in the morning.   Mr. Robot must be on drugs. Well, you were four months on Sangria...  What happened? Ill get you so drunk and youll tell me to my advantage. Its not in the past: its in the future. You will repeat it. I am not the same but you are the constant and I must find out what you did to let go when she did or whatever.  Ah, dont make yourself out to be so important. Even if I told you everything, you would not be able to know me any better.  You will never...  Program for tomorrow: mail that letter, fix the files, kill the flies, paint my nails, find the hammer, avocado, tomato, salt and Feelings with lime....never go wrong...it's as seductive as Audrey Hepburn in her pillow feathers. i intend to be free. someone agrees...norton norton i want you to enter me as sweetly as Shakespeare did his black lady.

(Although only seventeen letters long,  sesquipedalianism  (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sesquipedalianism) deserves a mention. It was used as a  nonce word  by the  Roman  author  Horace , in his work " Ars Poetica "...The quote is as follows: "Proicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba," which means, "He throws aside his paint pots and his words that are a foot and a half long". The word sesquipedalianism means "the practice of using words one and half  feet  long".) succulent--that is...  i'd go here for alcohol:   urlLink  Isis and Osiris  : "piece"   but the alcohol would end up here:   "Everything that is veiled, everything mysterious, contributes to the terrible, and is therefore capable of sublimity. Of this variety is the legend, that one read at Sais in Egypt above the temple of Isis. "I am everything, that is, that has been, and that will be. No mortal man has lifted my veil." -- Precisely this uncertainty and mysteriousness gives man's conceptions of the future after death something of the dreadful; these feelings are very well expressed in the well-known soliloquy of Hamlet." -Schiller, 1793 from "Of the Sublime" in English translation...   take me...take me there Hamlet and Co...   but not alone...(said the lily to petals...)

      Alta Pete: Aim High to hit the center...  &nbsp;  three quatrains, and a concluding couplet  abab cdcd efef gg  go back to thee:   Sonnet 147 by Shakespeare (c. 1603)   My love is as a fever, longing still  For that which longer nurseth the disease,  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill.  Th'uncertain sickly appetite to please:  My reason, the physician to my love,  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,  Hath left me, and I, desperate, now approve  Desire is death, which physic did except.  Past cure I am, now reason is past care,  And frantic mad with ever more unrest;  My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,  At random from the truth vainly expressed:  For I have sworn thee fair, and though thee bright,  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.  &nbsp;  (Almost there for that Yeats' essay: "Until I Die:&nbsp; Consummation of Love Only After Death in W.B. Yeats' Early Poems" February 1003 by A.V. for Prof. Sue Laver)  &nbsp;  Now, from Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_:  Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 (overlooking Dover...right into the sea...)  &nbsp;  Let me not to the marriage of true minds  Admit impediments; love is not love  Which alters when it alteration finds,  Or bends with the remover to remove.  O no, it is an ever-fixed mark,  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;  It is the star to every wand'ring bark,  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks  Within his bending sickle's compass comel  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,  But bears it out even to the edge of doom.  If this be error and upon me proved,  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Love does not exist except in the words of sonnets such as these.  It is&nbsp;created by artists because only artists can truly conceive...

I hide myself within my flower,          That, fading from your vase,   You, unsuspecting, feel for me   Almost a loneliness.   and again: by Emily Dickinson  What if I say I shall not wait?   What if I burst the fleshly gate   And pass, escaped, to thee?   What if I file this mortal off,   See where it hurt me,—that ’s enough,—          And wade in liberty?

       urlLink Paroles.net - Sko - Montre moi le chemin   On my way to getting a pedi (then a mani), two people accosted me. must not overuse that word, but here it fits. one really cute girl, as i was smoking (but not really) down McGill college past the suggestive photos of horses, almost near St. C., asked me in French how to dial on her cell to leave a message "boyfriends: Pierre,..." (or am i hallucinating?)--it said on her crimpled piece of paper): she sounded completely confused. 1-514 or not, i got rid of her. she was cute, though. did i say that before? long blond hair, slim, and confused. then, as i entered Eaton Center, this East Asian dude, who was wandering around with his white friend, apologized to me like five times for running into to me, in an American accent. what a tactic! he didn't even run into me--it was some old man who got it... anyway, he asked me where to cut his hair...he said somewhere on this floor...yeah, same place i was going. when i started walking quickly, he was like: "why do women have to walk so fast? please slow down." he was a trip. so, at the salon where i might get hiv, hepatitis and a host of other diseases, all of the four Vietnamese women were busy working on Caucasian, African Canadian, French Canadian, Arabic, Italian, Jewish nails. It was a real multicultural scene. Haha. Then, i met Nadia. A new one. We talked only in French. She kept asking me what color she should use on her mile long fake nails (hands, not feet.) She was really cute with her almond brown eyes, tan skin with a pink glow on her cheeks (or was that make-up), great bra or..., came from St. Eustache, told me she was 20 and dating this hot Lebanese guy who only wanted to marry a virgin (a problem in both our cases, hah) and wanted her to look great 24/7. She also admitted that she never saw him without her blue contact lenses. She was like, I think i look ugly without them. Can you help me? I was about to say, go tell this guy to fuck himself. She said he was driving her up the walls. No joke? He had forbid her to wear mini skirts, but she admitted that he ogled all the mini-skirted shiksas on St. C.. She was like, never date a Lebanese who is Muslim. I was going to say--you don't have to worry, but why lie? ;) I'd be great with my virginal spirit... Anyway, what can you do but be a slave--or use a whip? When she left, we kissed the Montreal way (her idea) and she said: see you next time. How many times do I go...? Hello...last night, Alina and I went to Place JC--surprise fireworks and the more than delicious smell of crepes coming from a booth near the water--she almost got the nutella, banana crepe made in front of our eyes (i was so hungry, i had to get away as i was going out of my mind with that perfume), (later, we passed by a woman and her bf with his evil dog--the dog went beserk and she fell flat on top of this evil animal onto asphalt--luckily, she didn't break her chin!!...) lights around tents that sheltered old books--like in "Paris", as Alina remarked, and then a moon all orange and huge, lightning more beautiful than any firework show--white light illuminating a purplish blue...then up Brazilian-decked Crescent...all those beautiful people are an illusion. If only I had blue eyes. Bavaria is my drink? Then, why stuff business cards in a green suitcase when i can fit a person?

      please don't shift, jitter or try to fly off the incline  and somebody behind you, ruffling its body as a ghost  through a house, through a house out in the nature of the world  the word of the day is efface  tears in bed and a mirror so pure it cannot show our faces  the sound of names, the sound of water bubbling in a spring, forgiving.

      of gold dust that the whole world can eat, in time, the water of the Seine will enter your breast, tasting more of love than lust:  August 8, 2004 10:27 am "News from France"  "Dear Anny,   It's been a few months since we met. I first would like to tell you that I really appreciated our meeting and I think my parents were delighted too to see you. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed your trip in Europe.   As far as I am concerned, I left a few weeks after we met to Scotlant to visit some other cousins I've never seen before and  I went then to Roma with some friends. Both of these trips were great.  I met many people and I saw a lot of beautiful places I've never seen before.    Then, at the end of June, I've started in Paris my one-year internship in the financial department of a big French company. Even if it's sometimes exhausting  I find it really exciting and quite interesting. And besides, as I now live in the centre of Paris, I can benefit from all the assets of the city. And at the moment, it's very pleasant to live here especially because Paris is totally empty in August.   Otherwise, what are you doing during this summer? What are your plans? Next year you'll start law studies at Mc Gill, won't you? How is Nathan?   I really would like to see you again so if one day, you plan to come to France, just tell it to me so that we meet up again. And don't forget that you're really welcome to come and stay at my place.   I'm very much looking forward to hearing from you.   Emmanuel"  one day of "pure and simple happiness"  "Mary, you shouldn't let them make you mad. You hold the best you can. And Mary, after all the pain is gone, I'm always going to live to be your man." (from the Scissor Sisters' "Mary")  ...i'm very much looking forward to hearing from you...

      July 13, 2003 Low-key, I walked.  With a smile, I closed eyes.  In agony, I walk.  Now, what indulgence  Can you give?  My loneliness will never  Be as Christ's, will  Always be more, be less.  G-d travelled with me  But He left me when  You arrived.  And if you leave,  Will he return?

      "It is absurd to think that the only way to tell if a poem is lasting is to wait and see if it lasts. The right reader of a good poem can tell the moment it strikes him that he has taken an immortal wound--that he will never get over it. That is to say, permanence in poetry, as in love, is perceived instantly. It hasn't to await the test of time. The proof of a poem is not that we have never forgotten it, but we knew at sight we never could forget it." -Robert Frost

       urlLink Telegraph | News | Alcohol sharpens your brain, say researchers   "Our results appear to suggest some specificity in the association between alcohol consumption and cognitive ability," said the team. "Frequent drinking may be more beneficial than drinking only on special occasions."  And in other news, researchers at the University of Bordeaux have concluded that drink water is terrible for your health.

      graze the skin chew it well down to the bones drinking vinegar  from pretentious and egomaniac gymnastics of Harper's March 2004 Issue: from Terry Eagelton 'discusses' Roy Porter's _Flesh in the Age of Reason_ (W. W. Norton, 2004) in "I Am, Therefore I Think: The plight of the body in modern thought": "Although [Samuel Johnson] suspected that his ailments had a psychological cause, he continued to believe that soul and body were entirely separate affairs. His biographer, James Boswell, suffered nineteen bouts of the clap. Despite laying bets on the matter and reminding himself to be "helmeted" ([...]), he could hardly keep himself free of some form of sexual infection for more than a few months at a time. He also had a sizable drinking problem, which hastened his death. "If it were not for the restraints of reason and religion," Boswell wrote ruefully, "I am afraid I should be as constant a votary of Bacchus as any man." (In fact, it would have taken a straitjacket to keep this fearfully eccentric Scot off Booze.)"
