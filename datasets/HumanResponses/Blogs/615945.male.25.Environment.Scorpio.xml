      Hey, I'm up in Cloquet now, just finished up my second day of work. Haven't seen any ruffed grouse yet, but I saw a black dog sitting on someone's front porch. Oh, and a dead cat in a ditch. We haven't started actually surveying for them yet though. So far I've cleaned one of the survey routes of saplings and debris to make actually doing the transects as easy as possible when the time comes (probably next week). I took forever and might have fucked up... oh well, I'll do better tommorrow now that I know what the dealy'o is  I also had to take an animal handling exam that was pretty much a joke. It was all about anesthetising rats and monkeys... nothing even remotely dealing with catching grouse in traps to measure them and then let go.  Cloquet itself has everything a person needs... nice wilderness to live in, and a bustling town within 10 minutes (Subway, liquor store, generic yet large grocery store, Hardees, McDonalds, Grandmas and a Wal-Mart). My cabin is large and cozy... next weekend when I come home, I'll haul my TV up with DVD player and GameCube. What really sucks is missing wrestling though. I'm pretty sure folks taped Raw for me (if they could figure out how to work the VCR... which is a toss-up), but then at the end of the show my friend Mike leaves me a message freaking out about how so and so beat so and so under such and such conditions, which would have pretty much spoiled the show for me had I not immediately hung up as soon as I realized what was going on.  I know from how his mark-out began that it involves Shelton Benjamin though, which makes me very happy since that guy is one of the greatest talents the WWE has right now, and is finally getting his well-deserved singles push, especially for being a relative newbie.  I've never been a good cook, so my eating habits = down the tubes while I'm up here. For breakfast I had 3 hot dogs, and for lunch I had a TV dinner which I realized while eating it contained an exhorbitant ammount of saturated fat.  I have 9 more of those in the freezer.  It sucks not having a computer of my own where I can install With Authority! (some online trading card game, similar to Magic, but with wrestling instead of spells). Bringing my own computer up = pointless too, since the internet is only available from the labs. I'll be coming home on Friday and leaving again Sunday evening. I realized from the drive up here that it really isn't all THAT far... It took my Festiva only about 4 gallons of gas while fully loaded up with my shit, and it's about a 2.5 hour drive.

      Not much new to report.  Played lots of DDR over @ Liz's on Friday.  Fun times... next week I just need to remember to bring my GCN so we can continue on our multiplayer Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles game.  Rest of the weekend was just relaxing, eating burgers, playing WA!, etc.  On Saturday the 8th of May I'm going to New Prague with Mike to go see Shawn Daivari wrestle.  I was surprised to see he still had shows booked in Minnesota, so I guess I better go while I still have a chance.  He must just be finishing up contractual obligations with local leagues, since he just made the move to Kentucky or wherever he went earlier this month.  The weekend after that I'm meeting up with Mike & Sleezy for walleye opener. Work is still fun but took a major downturn today.  Found 2 deer ticks today and one wood tick.  I don't really care about the nuicance... I can get used to that; but I'm just fuckin' paranoid about getting lyme dissease.  I can't think of a more effective way of getting it than by walking around in the woods for 8 hours a day like I am :-/

      Happy belated Easter!  This one's gonna be short... I'm about to head into town.  Easter was great... we all (me, sister, brother-in-law) met up @ my folks' place.  Great food, great fun.  Replaced the alternator on my car with my dad.  Pain in the ass to do, but saved over a hundred bucks doing it ourselves. On Friday I went to hang out with Mike in Brooklyn Park.  His friend Egypto was there, and took us out to a cool shiesha bar in Northeast Minneapolis.  Great food and great smokes... smelled really nice in there, unlike a bar full of cigarette smokers.  It was mostly Arabs playing cards... everyone had their own hooka pipe.  There was a guy who just went around the entire time changing people's coals.  It was pretty neat. I also got myself a PS2 with DDR using a gift certificate from my dad and my friend Dan's employee discount from Target.  I brought it all up here, but the floor in my cabin is so damn squeaky (you can feel loose boards moving around as you walk across the carpeting)... the squeaking totally throws the beat off, but I'm starting to get used to it.  And with 3 ppl in the cabin, I have to wait for the other's to leave before breaking it out because the floor makes so much noise.  Well.. I guess I don't HAVE to wait, but I think DDR might be a little too "out there" for this particular crowd :P Grouse are drumming now.. found a couple drumming logs so far, but it's still a bit cold for most of them to start (I don't blame em either, it's still below freezing up here, and they have to flap their wings pretty hard to make the noise). Oh yeah.. I shaved my beard off too.  I just wish it didn't get so damn scraggly after two weeks :-/ Bye!

      Not much new to report today event-wise, but I did come to a major decision while walking in the woods alone with plenty of time to think.  I decided that I want to go to grad scool and get myself a masters in education.  Yup... I think that sounds pretty good.  It's something I could see myself doing, teaching middle/high-schoolers biology, or even in a crunch some German (heck, I have a degree in it.. I just don't know the grammar rules all that well since I'm a native speaker and just speak it on instinct).  Anyhow, now I'm gonna have to scramble to take the GRE's and hope I do allright on them.  I'm pretty much set on going to Mankato State University for it.  They seem to have a good program, and their requirements aren't so harsh.  They let you get in with a 3.0 GPA over the past 2 years of study rather than a straight 3.0 like the U of MN.  I have a 2.7 overall, and a 3.2 over the last 2 years.  Anyhow, my sister is getting some study guides for me from a friend of hers, so hopefully she'll have them on Saturday when the family is all together for Easter.  Yes, I know Easter is on Sunday, we just do things different I guess :P

      Sunday night on my way back to work I stopped by at Grand Casino in Hinkley... it's pretty much right on my route, about an hour and a half from home and an hour from work, so it's a nice place to split up the long trip.  A couple of friends, Rich & Halie, were staying there for the night, so I joined them for some 5 dollar prime ribs (actually the already ate, so they just watched me) and some gamblin'.  I started off playing The Price is Right (nickel slot... I always play conservatively :P ), and I accidentally hit the wrong button, of all things the Max Bet button!  This sent me on an emotional roller-coaster ride- at first I was like oh shit, that's a lot of money... 90 nickels wasted in one instant.  But then to my utter glee and astonishment the machine started making all kinds of noise and the graphics started going bonkers.  I got 50 bucks out of that errant spin, and it was off of the first 5 bucks that they gave me for registering for their Players Club.  Then I played some DDR (I suck at it, but Rich was tearing it up) and some virtual boxing where you actually have to move your body to duck and jab.  Weird shit. Yesterday @ work the third guy on the crew arrived... seems pretty cool.  On our transect we found all kinds of huge fresh wolf prints in the snow.  Today we did our first real surveys, with data forms and all, but the drumming season hasn't started yet so I only found one grouse on my route (well, three if you count the 2 remains I stumbled over that were most likely eaten by a raptor).  The grouse flushed from like 5 feet away from me and scared the shit out of me, but hey... it's better than finding another boring carcass :P I hauled my TV and Game Cube up on Sunday, so now I'm off to play some videogames.  I'm pretty beat from a long day, so I'm in the mood for an aggressive fighting game.  Hasta later!

      I'm back home in Lakeville now... my first week of work ended 2 days ago; it was a rather exhausting week, but great fun nevertheless.  Still no actual surveying- I spent most of the week hacking away at shrubs & branches to clear nice convenient paths through the woods.  That way we can quietly sneak through the trees when we actually do our surveys, haul bulky traps in and out, etc.  Getting paid to walk around with an axe and destroy things...  how great is that?  I also saw a deer that had been killed by a wolf.  All the stomach contents were still there in a neat heap that had been carefully eaten around, and the bones were picked completely clean.  It was amazing how throughly they/it took care of that deer... even all the little cavities in the spinal column were picked clean.  I also found the remains of a grouse that had probably been killed by a Goshawk or some other raptor.  The boss is really cool, and there are a lot of nice guys up there, but being that it's a mainly timber research station there aren't many women up there.  Lots of beer, hunting/fishing stories and dirty jokes. My favorite indie wrestler, Shiek Shawn Daivari, was in the Super 8 last night (big annual tournament on the east coast that features some of the best indie wrestlers from around the country).  He got eliminated in the first round, so I still have to decide whether or not to get the tape of the show.  If they just made it a DVD instead of VHS I think I'd go for it, but I hate tapes. I also got good news from my brother-in-law, Kyle, who has a winery (www.winehaven.com) with his family in Chisago: his merlot won first place in a prestigious competition in New York, up against wines from California, Germany, France and all over the world.  His port wine got 3rd as well, and it was only bottled a year ago.  The judges commented that given 10 years to age like the majority of those he was competing against it would be unbelievably good.  I don't know much about wine, but hey, I like drinking it and it's cool that WineHaven got some madd props from the competion.  I just got back from a great party in Brooklyn Park trying my hand @ karoke until about 4 AM (I sucked... mainly because the music selection lacked any kind of metal :P ), only had about 3 hours of sleep, and have a slight hangover, so I'll be chiming out now.

      Heyyyyyy! (Fonzie-style) I just got back from Duluth!  It's super-nice there along the Lake Superior shoreline.  Kind of foggy and windy, but that all added to the atmosphere; it was really peaceful... no people.  I'm gonna have to come up there more often- it only takes about 25 minutes to get there, and there's tons to do.  I think I'm gonna go to the Great Lakes Aquarium at the harbor later this week.  Gut (my boss) gave me most of today off since it's Memorial Day (all I had to do is my 3 hour morning survey, and then I was done).  I was quite pleasantly surprised that he just said I could take the rest of the day off, since he's still giving me another full paid day off to make up for the fact that I worked on a holiday.  But the survey had to be done, since the grouse won't be drumming anymore in just a couple weeks.  I'll take my day off credit around July 4th, so I can make a 4 day weekend out of that. Last night I met up with Rich @ the Burnsville Mall arcade... Played on the DDR machine and some other cool new machines like Percussion Freaks, where you have to play a drum set to the music with a couple of actual drumsticks and a foot pedal for the bass drum.  I haven't really been to any arcades since their big slump in the early 90's, when consoles replaced any need to leave the house for video games.  Nowadays there's so much fancy stuff you could never afford to put in your house, let alone make space for.  It almost seemed more like a futuristic fitness club than an arcade :P Saturday was primarily a loafing day, since I had planned to go to the arcade then, but Rich ended up having to work all day.  I did help move a bunch of my sister's boxes into the garage in preparation of her moving, and moved my folks' computer onto a different desk.  Other than that I just played a bunch of With Authority! and updated stuff on my blog.  It's all in that skinny column to the right of this- like the profile, links and FAQ (so check it out :P ). On my way home from work on Friday I stopped by WineHaven, where Kyle said he saw 4 morels (Minnesota's state mushroom, which technically speaking isn't really a mushroom).  As it turned out, the woods around their house were LOADED with morels.  I got 2 giant bags to take home.  I actually felt kind of guilty that Kyle and his folks didn't keep a bunch of them... I got about 10 pounds bagged up with Kyle's dad, and the market rate is around $36 per pound from what I've heard.  I'm sure we only got the tip of the iceberg though, as we only covered a small portion of their woods in about a half hour.  They tasted GREAT sauteed with butter... mmmmm. I also signed up for the GRE's late last week.  I'll be taking them in Duluth at noon on the 21st of June, and they'll last around 4 hours :-/  I just need to get 500 points on either the language or the math section to be able to apply to Mankato State University's education program. LOL @ the blog's own built-in spellchecker... the word "blog" is not in its dictionary, and it recommended that I replace it with "bloc" :P

      Hey! It's been a while.  Been home just about every weekend, hung out @ Liz's a couple times in the interim, and spent a weekend @ Mike's place in Wilmar for some fishing.  I never got to go to go see Daivari wrestle, as the show got cancelled (though I did get his DVD, and found out I'm actually on it during one of the matches he showed from First Avenue).  Instead I had a bunch of ppl over for a BBQ, emptied a couple cases of beer and made the mistake of going to see the worst movie ever made (Van Helsing).  My faith in Hollywood was, however, restored last Thursday when I had the extreme pleasure of seeing Kill Bill vol. 2 in a theater I had all to myself, with a huge jug of Cherry Coke and a giant popcorn (I never buy that expensive theater shit, but being that I had the rare fortune of having a theater all to my lonesome, I felt that I should seize the opportunity to live it up a little).  I just discovered the coolness of Kill Bill when I saw the first half hour of Volume 1 @ Mike's, but then fell asleep.  I ended up buying it the next day from just what I had seen of it thus far, and Volume 2 ended up being even better.  Seriously 2 of the best movies ever made, imo. The week before that I made a fortuitus stop @ WineHaven on my way back up to work in Cloquet... Kyle hooked me up with a couple awesome bottles of wine I'm just now finishing off, and his folks gave me a kickass jacket.  They had just gotten a new line of custom WineHaven hoodie jackets that are great for wearing around all over.  Now they just need to make an online store so ppl reading this can order one for themselves right away :P This Saturday was Kyle's graduation with an MBA from St. Thomas (congrats!).  It was raining, so it got taken indoors where there wasn't enough room to seat everyone (subsequently forcing us to watch it on a projection screen with a live video feed).  Then we all met up with his family at Sig & Kyle's apartment probably for the last time ever, as they are moving in a month.  2 weeks from now there'll be another graduation when Sig finishes up her medical school residency. In other news, I've also gotten better @ DDR, and even whooped some random dude's ass at the machine in Grand Casino on Sunday (though I think one of the arrows on his mat may have been defective, from what I recall Rich complaining about a while back).  Next weekend Rich & I are going heading out to the Burnsville Mall to take on the DDR machine there. As far as the job goes things are starting to wind down, with the grouse drumming less and less.  Soon we'll stop doing grouse surveys altogether and instead do vegetation surveys around their drumming logs for the remaining couple of months.  That sounds like it might be a little monotonous, but there might be the possibility of adding some variety to the schedule by surveying for Golden-winged Warblers... the boss just got a notice that because of a decreasing population, some big ornithological society out of Cornell wants ppl to collect data, and the place I work in Cloquet is within their zone of interest. You've probably noticed I changed the layout of my blog to make it look nicer.  Over the weekend I'll try to get my links back up and maybe a couple pictures.  It'll probably take me some time though... I haven't tinkered with web code since high school, so my HTML is a bit rusty.

      OMGYAY!  w00t! I just got finished up the GRE exam a couple hours ago in Duluth.  They wouldn't let me bring any water in because they were afraid I would destroy their valuable computers that were at least 10 years old.  The monitors had such a poor refresh rate that my eyes instantly hurt from the intense flickering.  Then they got on my case for hanging my jacket over the back of my chair.  They gave me the option of either sitting on it or putting it on the floor :P  Oh well, at least all went well! I got a 690 on the quantitative and a 620 on the verbal section.  Needed 500 on either one to be accepted to Mankato State University.  So this week I need to get all my application shit turned in to them and hope for the best! Also got an EyeToy yesterday with Groove.  Quite fun!  Not as much of a workout as DDR, but I like almost all the songs on it.  For those not in the know, EyeToy = camera for playstation 2 that puts you on TV... then you move around to hit things on the screen at the right times.

      Well... Geronimo just woke me up by jumping on my desk and throwing things on the floor, so here I am with 5 hours of sleep on a weekend.  I have my GRE on Monday, so I should really study some more today and tomorrow.  First off though, the blogging. Being that I'm able to work 10 hour days now and be done on Thursday, I was able to come home just in time to catch SmackDown.  It seems like they're finally getting back on track with some quality programming since last I've been able to watch over a month ago.  I just wish I could catch Raw every week... I've already missed the monumental rise of Eugene as a WWE superstar... I know it's evil of me- but I just love gimmicks like that, that push the envelope of common decency :P  I saw the half-hour promo from a while back when the Coach was ripping on Eugene, and then the Rock made a surprise visit intervene.  I've never seen a crowd get so passionate about cheering a wrestler in long time like they did over Eugene... best decision for ratings ever.  His next big push, -Eugene vs. HHH- , is tomorrow night... and I'll be back in Cloquet just in time to miss it! pffft Anyhow, last night I was @ Liz's for most of the day.  We watched Roger Rabbit and played lots of DDR with her roommates.  Lately I've been trying to push myself real hard to get out of Light mode.  I am starting to get more used to the faster 8th notes now, but am still just getting C's and D's on Standard.  One day I'll get as good as Rich and start owning Heavy mode ^_^  After I got home, my eMule download of The Pirate Movie was finally completed after over a month of downloading it on weekends only.  I hadn't seen it in years, and it's still great fun.  Now it just needs to come out on DVD. *EHEM bastards @ Fox* Knowing there's a game today between Germany and Lithuania in the Euro Cup, I checked the TV listings to see if perhaps ESPN2 was carrying it.  Nope... only iNDemand PPV- and guess what?  THEY WANT FUCKING TWENTY DOLLARS TO WATCH A SOCCER GAME THAT SHOULD BE FREE!! What do they think this is, a monthly wrestling pay-per-view?  If someone wanted to follow the entire Euro Cup from here, and watch every game for $20 a pop, it would cost a fortune!  Oh well... I guess I'll just continue simply reading the www.euro2004.com results. Anyhow, that's all for now.  I'm off to wrestle a couple matches on With Authority! now, and then see about getting some breakfast in me.

      I know I said I'd edit the post last time too fill in the gaps, but it's already been 2 days now, so I might as well start with a brand new post.  Anyhow, Sunday proved quite eventful too!  Even though we had just been planning on packing out and heading home, Kyle suggested, and I was happy to agree, to go out on the lake again!  This time we got in from Superior (the city, not the lake... but it was still on Lake Superior.  Confused yet? :P).  Then we cruised up to near Two Harbors where Sig climbed out onto some rocks and ran up to a knitting shop she wanted to go to.  Kyle and I enjoyed a peaceful hour of waiting on the water and hanging out, while Sig was deciding what to buy.  Then I got to drive most of the way back, handing control over to Kyle to navigate the Duluth harbor and go under the famous lift bridge.  After getting back out of the lake and were about to call our adventure to a close, a most unfortunate gust of wind tore the cover off of the boat and tossed it into the highway.  About 15 minutes later we were finally able to get back and retrieve it, though most of the buttons were destroyed by the force with which they were ripped off.  Hopefully it won't be too much of an ordeal for them to get it fixed back up.  After this final adventure, we were all pretty much ready to go home.  Fortunately for me, home was only 15 minutes and a stop at Subway away (though Sig & Kyle had another couple hours to go) ^_^ Skipping on to yesterday, we started doing vegetation surveys at work.  They're actually really fun, even though the others seem to hate them :P  Lots of counting, identifying and measuring of plants around grouse drumming logs.  The only downside to the work is having to stay in one place for a long time, allowing the bugs to keep gathering around me in thicker and thicker swarms. I'm doing 10 hour days now so I can get Fridays off, so that should finally allow me to catch some good ol' wrestling action on Thursday nights, and make my trips home on the weekends more worthwhile. After work I went into town to get my oil changed... I'm way overdue.  None of the places in town were open though except WalMart, and they were backed up past closing time so they wouldn't take me.  I guess I'll have to do one more 200 mile trip on the same old oil and change it this weekend with my dad, since I wont have any time to get it changed tomorrow, and I leave for home on Thursday.  Oh yeah... then there's still the issue with the broken headlight.  Shit :P Ok, that's all I got for now. oot!

      Greetings!  I am typing from the lobby of a Super 8 hotel in Ashland, Wisconsin- about to check out.  Sig & Kyle dragged the boat all the way up to Cloquet to pick me me up on Friday, after which we stopped by @ the Fitgers Brewhouse for some dinner, did some shopping nearby and then continued on to where we are now.  Yesterday was our big day of doing stuff, and it was awesome!  All day was spent boating through the Apostle Islands.  I've never really driven a boat before, and my first experience at it yesterday was over cold, windy, choppy water- with every wave we plowed through throwing dropping the boat hard on the surface, causeing a nice solid jolt and a giant spray of icy water to go over us.  It was only somewhat nerve-racking to drive through, and then I got used to it and it was fun as hell.  First we stopped at the farthest out Devil's island, and walked accross to the lighthouse on the opposite side and also checked out some cool rock formations and caves along the northern coast that faced the open water.  There were TONS of flies, but luckily we had Kyle along with his white sweater to attract them away like a beacon ^_^  It was pretty cold everywhere on the lake, except for around Madaline island, where we docked next.  It felt like we drove through an instant barrier of warmth as we approached... we got out of our boat in jackets and sweaters only to see everyone ejoying the tropical Madaline weather in their shorts & t-shirts.  Then we rented 3 mopeds and tore the island up with our motors buzzing a the swarm of killer bees.  Ok, maybe that's overdoing it a bit, but it was great fun!  lots of nice open roads (there were very few cars on the island, being that the only way to get there is by ferry).  I had never ridden on a moped before, and it turned out to be one of the funnest ways ever to get around.  Then we had a burger, stopped by @ one last island (Michigan) for a final adventure before the fuel tank became too low.  Here we just went up some stairs to check out another lighthouse (actually there were two... the morons who built the first one made it too short to see over the trees :P), this one was much better groomed than the isolated Devil's island lighthouse, but everything was closed up so we left after only a brief stop (also, Sig was waiting down at the boat which she had to constantly keep from banging into the dock).  Meanwhile back down @ the Michigan Island dock, 3 middle-aged bimbos had taken a zodiac in from a larger boat anchored about 50 meters out.  The lady steering rammed that thing up into the shore, and it started grinding into the rocks hard, causing all kinds of smoke and noise.  Instead of turning it off right away, she threw her arms up in panic and let it grind for another good 10 seconds.  Kyle & I had to help them out onto the dock and get their raft free from the rocks, as the guy waiting back @ their big boat on the lake looked on disaprovingly ^_^  Ok, so this post is getting pretty long, you'll just have to deal with it- we did a ton of cool stuff :P Anyhow, after Michigan, we came back to the mainland and had some Dairy Queen.    I'll edit this post later to finish it up.  Gotta get ready to pack out now, sig will be up in about 5 minutes so I can shower.

       AAAARRRRRRGGHH!!!!111  OMGWTFBBQ!  All of a sudden this morning I got absolutely SWARMED by mosquitoes.  I was at my wits end- about ready to gouge my own eyes out just do distract me from the swarms of agony circling around me with their incessant buzzing and stabbing.  After a couple hours of walking through these clouds of doom, my survey route brought me close enough to the cabin that I could run in and grab a bug shirt.  That kept the skeets off my face with a mesh mask that zips over your entire head, but traps the humidity and heat inside.  My glasses fogged up and I was quite uncomfortable breathing in the same hot air over and over, but the agony brought on by the mosquitoes was at least alleviated.  Due to the distraction caused by the mosquitoes, I also could no longer feel when there was a tick crawling up me as I could before.  For the first time ever, after having found literally HUNDREDS of ticks crawling on me over the past couple months, not one but two actually managed to latch on to me. Supposedly this is how it's going to be for the next 2 months... I don't know how I will keep my sanity.  Today changed my overall mood in a major way.  I really did like this job a lot over the last couple months, even with all the ticks.  But this turn of events has me praying for August to arrive quickly.

      OK! I'm finally done for the day @ 7:00 PM!  I just saw a grouse up close dancing around and screaming, trying to distract me from her brood. She was getting stressed, so I just took a couple of pictures of her and moved on.  That's about all I've seen for grouse action in the past week... things are really slowed down.  Starting next week all we will be doing is vegetation surveys for the next 2 months.  I also saw a pileated woodpecker (the really big ones that look like Woody Woodpecker) swoop really close to me. On Saturday was Sig's graduation party which turned out AWESOME.  Most of Sig's in-laws were over (except for Troy, who unfortunately couldn't come, being that he works at Target where a lot of the workers were at their own graduations), a couple influential teachers out of her past, some friends, lots of beer, great food and WineHaven wine ^_^  So now she's a real doctor! Crazy to think about, but I'm impressed as all heck, and so happy that things worked out so well for her getting a real life established.  Hopefully I'll get there someday too.  For now I just need to worry about taking the GREs.  I studied a little bit today but kept dozing off.  Either tomorrow or the next day, depending on my work schedule, I'll head down to the Caribou (where that creepy homeless dude came up to me last time) and hit the books hard for a few hours. Yesterday I had brunch with my folks & a couple of their friends in Prior Lake... got stuffed as all hell.  Later on I picked up a used copy of Final Fantasy Origins from EBGames.  It kicks major ass.  They redid the original Final Fantasy 1 & 2 for NES with all new graphics a while back for PS1, and updated the original musical score to sound more symphonic than the original 8-bit beeping.  The games themselves, however, are 100% intact from a gameplay and storyline perspective, so it's kind of a cool mix of modern and retro gaming.  Being that Final Fantasy is my favorite game series of all time, I figured it was well worth the $16 bucks I paid for it ^_^

      lalala... went to Duluth again yesterday.  Rather than cool and foggy like Memorial Day was with no people, it was warm and sunny with lots of traffic (including the &#9792; jogger variety ^_^).  I went to Fitger's Brewhouse and had a couple pints of some very tasty IPA that Gut recommended I try, skipped rocks off Lake Superior, went to the Great Lakes Aquarium (neat, but way overpriced.. I'd rather spend the money to go to the Minnesota Zoo), and walked around the shops on Canal Park. Toward the end of my stay, as I was having a coffee on a park bench, some homeless guy threw down his duffel bags on the bench next to me and started talking to me.  His introduction line was, "HEY! Do I know you from prison, man?"  uh... no :P  Then he kept going on about how the government shouldn't be able to tell you what kind of plants you can and can't grow, how he thought necrophilia is worse than raping a live person, and then asked me how I felt about violent criminals.  Good thing this all took place on a busy street.. I was happy to finally get away from him :P Tonight is Sig's graduation from her medical residency, which I unfortunately have to miss, being that I'm 2.5 hours away and have to work tomorrow.  At least I'll be able to catch her grad party on Saturday. Now I have to cut it off short, Gut and his friend who lives around here are making elk tacos for dinner.  Free food = yes ^_^

      Ok, now that it's been so long I have a lot to go over as briefly as possible.&nbsp; Hung out with ThrusH from WA! a couple Thursdays ago at his pad in Duluth... had a couple beers and watched SmackDown, and played some SD:SYM, which we ended up drawing&nbsp;every game :P&nbsp;&nbsp; It was cool to hang out with someone whom I only knew thus far from a computer game-&nbsp;it was weird actually talking to someone about WA! strategies, players, etc. in person too :P&nbsp; Still on WA!-related news I ended up actually winning my first WA! title the following weekend&nbsp;too, scoring the US Championship in a tournament&nbsp;^_^&nbsp;  Went with Mike, Laura &amp; Marc to Mystic Lake Casino and lost 15 bucks but had a good time.&nbsp; Work = still sucky... hot and bug-infested.  hmm.. that brings us to this weekend and I'll be done (I don't really feel like typing too much... just want to get things down quick).&nbsp; Went to Little Havana's with a bunch of friends Mike got together to have drinks in downtown Minneapolis... cool but overpriced.&nbsp; Then we went to Laura's apartment and&nbsp;finished getting drunk, before going&nbsp;to IHOP and&nbsp;sobering up ^_^&nbsp; Sunday I stopped @ WineHaven to wish good luck to my bro-in-law's brother who's got some surgery coming up (ugh).&nbsp; I'm sure he'll be fine but it's not the kind of thing that's ever fun to go through.&nbsp; I was going to lend him my GameBoy SP, but just as I got there he showed off the brand new one he just bought along with the new Mario Golf :P&nbsp; At least he can still borrow games from me, plus that means there's one more person to link to&nbsp;:)  Last night I was on the lake of one of the forest manager guys&nbsp;around here, Ron Severs,&nbsp;fishing along with my co-worker... between three of us we got a few smallish Northerns, a Walleye and a Blue-gill... enough to fill us up with a heavy dinner.&nbsp; Now I'm back at work, in my 2nd to last week... waiting for the torture to end.&nbsp; It sucks that such a cool job has to go out on such a bad note just because of the damn bugs and heat throughout the last month or so.

      Wellll... the 4th of July was a blast!  Hope whoever is bored enough to read this had a good one too ^_^ The new house looks AWESOME.  Somehow Sig & Kyle managed to clean out almost all the moving boxes by Sunday and move in their new furniture.  They still need a couple more things, so Sig & I stopped @ the furniture place before heading over to WineHaven for dinner. Then we went out on Green Lake where I tried to water ski, but after gorging myself on all the good food Kyle's mom made, not to mention his grandpa's famous beans, I really didn't feel fit to make repeated attempts at getting up on the skis and crashing (I don't know how to ski ^_^), so I opted for using the innertube instead.  Then I made the dumb decision of asking Kyle to try to dump me off.  He kept going faster and faster, swinging hard turns, and I was able to hold on until he eventually got up to 30 miles per hour.  That kind of hurt ^_^  My eyes hit the water, filling my eyelids up like sails, and my legs hit in a weird way pulling my groin.  I didn't even notice I had a pulled groin until we were about to get out of the boat hours later and I realized I couldn't lift my right leg to put my sock back on ^_^  Kyle kept apologizing, but hopefully I convinced him it was all my own fault for making the unwise request- but I did have a blast getting pulled around that fast.  Then we caught the fireworks in Forest Lake, and that was about that for the day. On Monday I convinced Dan to get a Playstation 2.  Hopefully he won't end up getting mad at me for it.. he was originally planning on getting an XBox.  I showed him around EB Games, where he got a membership and a couple games/memory cards and I picked up a copy of Silent Hill 2 for 12 bucks. Now I've been @ work for a couple days, unable to do field work due to my gimp leg.  It's nice doing paperwork all day instead of dealing with the skeets & ticks outside, but I feel kind of guilty that the others are still working out there.  I told them to save me a few plots for to do later on while they're in here doing paperwork (secretly I'm still hoping they finish it all up though :P).

      OKAY! My sister and Kyle moved in to their new house!  It took around 5-6 hours.. not bad.  I finally got to see the pad after hearing about it for the last 6+ months.  It's a really nice cozy suburban neighborhood, but at the same time close to downtown.  It has an awesome kitchen, a fireplace, and is a new house built in the middle of an older established neighborhood, so they already have nice big trees all over.  Only thing I didn't like is the steep driveway... my Festiva wouldn't stay in place even with the gears locked in, so I had to park 2 blocks down (their road was being paved, so I couldn't park on the street).  I guess I have to pack some blocks in my trunk from now on to wedge behind the wheels ^_^ Yesterday I went to the Mall of America to get a couple  urlLink DDR accessories , but they were sold out, so I ordered them online.  I also went to see Fahrenheit 9/11.  Tough movie to watch, but something everyone should see nonetheless.  Not that any of the information is new, but it's refreshing to see someone actually not afraid to talk about it, since Bush has all the mainstream media wrapped around his finger.  Such sadness and pain... all caused by a complete MORON crackhead who had no idea what he was doing to ordinary folks in both the US and Iraq (not to mention that he wasn't elected in the first place).  I also tried out a new sushi shop in the weird round store in the middle of the walkway that seems to change ownership every few months.  The chefs are all inside a rectangular bar-style seating area that you sit around.  It was reaaly good, and they had an awesome wasabi sauce, but it cost like $7 to get just 6 pieces of veggie sushi (I can't do the raw fish thing :P).  Anyhow, that got me in the mood for sushi, so today I'm gonna stop by & pick up a couple trays from the good ol' Sushi Express on my way to Sig's.  Then we're gonna head up to Chisago for some water skiing and to watch the fireworks from Green Lake. JoniK recommended an awesome computer game from 1998 that I somehow never heard of before, but is really awesome... Fallout 2.  So I'm gonna go kill some time on that now. l8r!

      I haven't updated in a while, probably because applying to Mankato has been foremost on my mind lately, even though I still haven't done that.  Tomorrow I have a weekday day off @ home so I can call around for what I need to send where.  This weekend was cool.. hung out on WA! most of the time, but also spent a good few hours in Grand Casino with Rich & Halie playing penny slots & DDR, then smoked a couple cheap cigars before I headed out.  Rich also filled me in on the upcoming DDR Extreme for PS2, which supposedly will use both the EyeToy and dance pad simultaneously. As for work, it's getting extremely torturous.  Because of the bugs, I need to wear long sleeves.  But the tremendous heat and humidity are hard to bare even in short sleeves when you're working outside all day.  Just 100 or so more logs to visit for some minor vegetation data (with 3 ppl hitting about 8 logs a day).  Then it's air-conditioned data entry for the remaining few weeks of the job ^_^ So that's about it!  I have a 5 day weekend starting up right now... tomorrow = application to grad school, Friday = helping Sig & Kyle get moved into their new house, and the weekend plus Monday are open.  Hopefully I can find something to do... if not, veging out really doesn't effect me negatively either ^_^

      My job ended! Kind of wooo, kind of boooo. I'm glad to get away from the bugs and heat. My folks went for a walk up in my woods and couldn't stand the bugs... even though they were pretty light that day. I dunno.. it was a really cool job though. I'd come back again if it wasn't for so long. Partied @ Liz's new house a couple weeks ago.. cool house with TONS of rooms. She's renting there with like 4 other ppl, and it sounds like a great deal. A couple nights ago I ran into Rich's brother at the arcade (I forget Rich's brother's name, so I guess I'll just call him Rich's brother... sorry Rich's brother ^_^). Rich's brother kicked ass on Percussion Freaks & DDR... I don't think I'll ever get to his level no matter how much time and effort I invest. Anyhow... he said they were having a big party next Friday downtown, spending a whole day @ GameWorks &amp; getting drunk at a nearby hotel. Unfortunately I can't go cuz I already lined stuff up, which brings me to the next thing! : Mike is driving up to Canada (Winnipeg) with Sleezy, Marc and myself. None of them are much the DDR types (except Marc, but I know he has it in him... he just hasn't gotten enough exposure :P), but we're still planning on getting drunk and having fun for 4 days up there. We're planning on seeing the city by day and partying hard @ night, but I wouldn't be surprised if I don't remember a thing about Winnipeg by the time I get back home :P Sig just got a DVD burner, so I spent the day over @ her place figuring out how to copy movies for her. Works great! I've bought enough DVD's in my day that I don't have anything to feel bad about... just another way to augment my collection with movies I probably wouldn't have bought otherwise. I'm still eagerly awaiting the release of Kill Bill 2 in four days, which I'll buy the moment the doors open @ Best Buy ^_^
