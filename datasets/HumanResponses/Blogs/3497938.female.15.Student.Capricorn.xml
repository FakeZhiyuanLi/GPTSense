      This is an e-mail I wrote to Greg Lee, my youth pastor...    Life is sooo pointless. You live, then you die. Wow, how wonderful. You are supposed to trust a God that puts soooo much pain into your life. Im sorry, i just cant do that. Why would He do that to me? Im supposed to love him? I dont think so. He should build me up as a strong Christian and then pile all this crap onto me. I cant handle it. People say, 'oh, but shelby... you are such a wonderful person. you can handle this.' NO I CANT!!! I wear a mask, and I like to. I dont want anyone to know that i'm at rock bottom. people look up to me, and i cant be broken in front of them. I am their mentor, their advice seeker, and their friend. How can they come to me if Im even worse then they are? Like, Cheyenne and Kristen come to me with their boy problems, school problems, etc... and i love to help them, i love to know that i can be there for them. But i feel like its all in vain. Like how can i tell them something, the right thing, and im not even doing it myself? How does that balance out? I love those girls, and all the people who come to me. And i lvoe to help them. I think thats my place... but im not taking my own advice... and i dont know why. Everything is sooo blury. Like im living my life outside my body. Like im watching everything happening right before my eyes and there is no way to stop it from happening. I work myself so hard, so im so worn out that all i have to do is jump in the shower then sleep... b/c @ night, i have the chance to think. and when i think i get really depressed. like i am now. and i put this mask on, so noone will know how im dying inside. There is just so much going on. Drew is breaking my heart. And he has no idea. Seeing him do the things he do is tearing me apart. and u told me to try not to let it get me down. i cant do that... when one of my friends hurt, i hurt with them. And even though he wont even look at me or talk to me, I still love him as my best friend... and i want to be there for him no matter what, no matter where, no matter what time, and no matter what kind of situation he is in. Its like i see it happeneing, i wish i could tell him to stop, but he wont listen to me... im trying to talk to him and he shuts me out... like im nothing. he has made me feel like im nothing of worth. like im not worthy to be look at or talked to. what did i do? yeah, i broke up with him... but it was better than going on and hurting him even more in the long run. so how can he sit there and hate me for trying to save him pain? i cant do anything right when it comes to him. Half of me wants to say screw it, do whatever you want. but the other half is like you cant do that, he needs you... There is just so much going on. ill have to write more about it later, or tell you on wednesday. my fingers ache. *lol* So, now you know the under lying pain that i hide. **now you know the real me... the real feelings that are deep inside of me**

      Yesterday and today was awesome. Tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday will be awesome. Looks like everything is turning out ok. Like the storm is starting to blow over. Yesterday, I went to the movies with my grandma and we saw Shrek 2. It was sooooo cute, I loved it. Im willing to see it again, which is probably what we are gonna do. Then tonight was church. I got to see Lauren and Chelsea and Justin and Hannah and Sam, etc... We chilled and had fun. Then tomorrow, the youth group is supposedly goin to the Braves game. Then we are gonna take Justin home and Lauren is comin to spend the night with me. Then Friday we are goin shopping for Justin's birthday present and going out to lunch, then taking her home. Then Saturday, im getting dropped off at Lauren's house and Justin and his mom are going to pick me and Lauren up to go bowling (for Justin's birthday) and then out to eat. We are meeting some guy named Jeremyup there. Then I am going home with Lauren and spending the night with her. Then we are going to church Sunday and then going home, and then back to church Sunday night. NO DRAMA!!! YAY!!! It's about time. *lol* We gave out our flyers tonight for the cleaning business. So hopefully we get some good, positive feedback from it. I think I'm gonna get off and play the Sims.

      Everything seems so... blah. Like, I hardly talk on the phone anymore. Im always on the internet. I havent seen my school friends in forever. Drew is in Maryland, so no drama with him. Me and Kayla dont have any drama goin on. (which im thankful about) It's all good. Today im going to the movies with my grandma (haha, sounds so corny) to see Shrek 2. We dont get to spend quality time together, so I promised her that I would go with her. I have started talking to Kyle lately, and I used to hate him. But he is ok now. I guess I never really gave him a chance. *lol, sorry kyle* So yeah, i think its about time to start getting ready. I'll post later on tonight.

      Today was a pretty boring day. I got up and went to the Orthodontist, and now my mouth is killing me. Then me and my grandmother went shopping and then out to eat, then shopping again. After that, I came home and talked to Lauren and Rusty. Then went swimming. Then talked to Danielle. My mom came over and Jack fixed the turck. So now its my mom's truck. Then they left and here I am. Bored...

      She called to talk to my grandmother about something about the truck and I dont know what else. And she got mad at me... oh well! I dont care. Anyways. I didnt go to church this morning, I was feeling just blah. So Rusty calls me and tells me to come tonight because we r goin to Brittany's church and our church is singin with theirs. So I go and he's not even there. *lol, typical rusty thing* It was a pretty boring service, but me and Lauren and Chelsea messed around and played with our flags. *lol* After that, we all (me, lauren, chelsea, michelle, mrs ollie, and kenny) went to Krystals to get sumthin to eat. We decided to sit outside until it started to rain. Kenny looks at us and says head to the van. We get in and start the van and it starts pouring! Go kenny. Then my grandma picks me up ad we come home. And here I am. Now im waiting on Chelsea so we can go to NEOPETS!!! *lol, chelsea*

      I just got up, the usual time (its 1:45pm), and nothing has really happened. Like, no one is home and everything is quiet. I kinda like it. Everything is so... content. Today, Im going to try and go shopping. For what? I dont know. Just to go and get out of the house. Or maybe I'll take my mom out to lunch/dinner. Yeah, that sounds like a good plan. Drew left for Maryland yesterday and didnt even call to say goodbye. Oh well. Maybe we need the break from each other. But, what he said Thursday night on IM really hurt me. He tells me he loves me, and I beleievd him. And I fell in love with him. I know I love him, and I want to be with him. But he said that 'I dont love him and all Im doing is looking for another hookup.' And that really hurt. When you love someone you take up their side, no matter if their right or wrong. And you believe them over anyone, no matter what they have done in the past. I would usually take it and move on and still love him. But not this time. It's going to hurt now, but I guess it will be better in the long run. Maybe we are supposed to be together, but not right now. I'm going to try to be friends with him, if he lets me. Wow, we've heard this before... But this time im going to stick to my word.

      Let's see. Me, Hannah, Drew, Amber Tolbert, Callie, Casey, Chloe, Sam, Stephen, and the 6th graders went bowling thursday night. We had fun. We just messed around and had fun and laughed and stuff. Drew was mad at me and he wouldnt tell me why. So at the end of the night, we were still at the bowling alley, he told me why he was mad. He talked to Kayla on the phone and the subject of FLA got brought up. Of course it cant be dropped and left alone. Kayla tells Drew that I was "all over" this guy, Jeff, I met in Florida. (I think I wrote about him in a previous post) So of course he is really mad. But the thing is I didnt do that. How can I be  so sure? Because I am afraid of guys. With the exception of Drew, because he is the only guy that I truly trust and I know wouldnt hurt me. (physically at least) So I IMed Kayla and told her I needed to talk to her. (she had an away message on) And this is the conversation: rockalwayz88: hey u needed to talk to me...? IXIrebel2007IXI: yeah... IXIrebel2007IXI: y did u tell drew i was all over that guy? IXIrebel2007IXI: and i would appreciate it if u wouldnt share with him this convo rockalwayz88: well shelby...i was telling my side of the story and that was a part of it IXIrebel2007IXI: but i wasnt "all over him" rockalwayz88: well yes...u were...u grabbed his penis...i think that qualifies for "all over him" IXIrebel2007IXI: what? nooo i did not rockalwayz88: whatever gets you to sleep at night IXIrebel2007IXI: when did i do that? rockalwayz88: after i left and then came back to talk to you and you and whatever his name was invited me in... IXIrebel2007IXI: i didnt do that. b/c i have learned my lesson about guys rockalwayz88: well you know what...i really really dont want to fight with you...i told my side of the story justl ike you told yours...and i dont think i was hallucinating when i saw that...but again, whatever you gotta tell yourself to get through the day IXIrebel2007IXI: havent u ruined enough in my family? guess it wasnt enough... u had to ruin me and drew with something that didnt even happen. so i thank you for that rockalwayz88: yes shelby...i am a life-ruiner, i get paid $30 an hour for it...so your welcome, just doing my job IXIrebel2007IXI: well u really good at it rockalwayz88: shelby...i dont want to fight...your vision is tainted and you have a warped sense of reality right now...i think you need to get some sleep IXIrebel2007IXI: tainted sense of reality? riiiight... u r the one who needs desperate pshycological help.  IXIrebel2007IXI: im threw with this So, Im the bad guy here. And she has drew to believe her and he wont talk to me. Thanks alot. Some friend. I dont think I have ever been so upset. I cried for what seemed like days. My mom came over, ans she is very mad about the situation. So is my grandmother, who supposedly acts like a 5 year old according to Kayla's psycho cousin, Brittany. Thats a whole nother story to be posted at a whole nother time. Then this morning, when I went to bed at 3, I got up at 7:30 and went over to Lauren's house. Then we got picked up by Mrs. Terri and went to clean their house. That was fun. Then she drove us back (us as in 9 people in her excursion... Terri, Loribeth, Devin, Lauren, Chelsea, Dalton, Me, and Jordan) to Lauren's house. Then I came home, went to sleep and here I am. Im back into depression again. Thats pretty much it...

      To finish up the PC posts: Monday we drove home. We went to Wendy's and messed around and ate. Ally and Chelsea had a little argument... i thought it was pretty funny. Thats about it.     I got back from Lauren's ouse a lil while ago. I have to call her, drew, and chelsea to see if they wana go bowling tonight with the church. So I guess I will post later on tonight.

      Sunday was father's day, which sucks because my father is a piece of crap. So I was feeling kinda down, but I love my friends. They brought me up and took my mind off my problems. So we got up at 6:30 and went to breakfast at 7:30. It was ok. After that we went swimming for a little while. Callie and Chloe met up with Cody and Corey and hung out with them. They were flirting and we gave them SUUUCH a hard time. We kept yelling out hand check. *haha, jordan* Then we had a church service and Steve spoke. It was an interesting message. Then we went swimming again... im kinda backwards, i think... but oh well. Then we went to lunch and then went swimming and went to the beach. Where me and a bunch of other people talked to other random people. After that we chlledin our rooms and Callie and Chloe and Casey danced and we laughed and ate M&Ms. Then we went to dinner and sang christmas songs and VBS songs. We had soo much fun. At first we (me chelsea and lauren) embarrassed drew and amber and hannah, but after a while, they joined in. It was awesome. Then we went back and I put on a secret (haha lauren and chelsea) and we bought our tickets to Miracle Strip. I was feeling bad because, well, i dont really know. But we got there and we were loud and laughed and I overcame my fear of ferris wheels and got on one. Then we rode the acrophobia ride 2. Then we were talkin to this guy named Daniel. He was pretty cool. He rode rides with us. It was about time to go and we got in line at the Shockwave, kinda like the Looping Starship at Six Flags, and we were on and strapped in and we had to get off so they could clean up where someone had thrown up. *EEEEEEWWWWW* Then I gave him my phone number and we left to go back to Laguna Beach. They shaving creamed Jordan and I found Drew and we talked. Then me and Drew talked to Greg about something that happened a couple weeks ago. Then everyone went off to bed. And that concludes Sunday. I'll write about Monday a little later on. RIght now I have to get ready for church.

      Saturday, the 19, my grandparents drove me and Amber to Panama City to be with my youth group. We got there around 4, then we headed over to Pineapple Willy's.  That was fun, not too much happened there. Then after that we headed over to Wal*Mart. Alot of ppl bought airbrush shirts. Me and Lauren got matching shirts that say Lauren and Shelny, Best Friends, Panama City 2004 on the back and Big Sister and Lil Sister on the front. While we were waiting on those to get done, me and Chelsea and Amber went to buy sheets b/c we didnt bring any. So we were walking and singing Jesus loves me and talking to random ppl. We get to these guys and we start talkin to him and Chelsea notices one has a hole in their pants. So me and Chelsea get on our knees and bow down to him. It was hilarious. After that we went up to the counter to get them to page 'Ritaboo', but they wouldnt. So we had to settle for them pagin Rita Martin (Ally's real name) and they did it 2. Then 5 minutes later we hear it again. And of course we, being the dorks we are, cracked up. Somewhere in all of that, me and Chelsea carried around granny panties. *lol* Then we came home, some people went swimming and then we did our devotion, the people went back to swimming. After that, me callie chelsea and lauren went "around the corner" to talk to Corey. Then we got in trouble and mrs shelia was being mean for no reason. We talked for a little while, and I finally went to sleep around 2:00. Then Sunday came around...

      Where was I... oh yeah. We picked up Amber at the airport and then went back to the resort. She unpacked and we talked and got our bathing suits on and went swimming. We met up with Mariah and swam until 3. Then me and Amber took showers and talked and then we straightened our hair and we looked cute. We were craving some chocolate so we went down to the Reefside Grill (at our resort) and ate some cheesecake. Thats where we met Justin, our 22 year old waiter. We talked to him for about 2 hours. Then we left there and met Tyler (14) and Nick (16). We chilled in the game room for a little while and then some annoying girls came in so we told them goodnight and went to bed. Wednesday we went to Islands of Adventures. We bought these Express Passes that let you skip the lines. We went to eat and met this girl, well she was 23, named Lori. She was awesome. We hung out with her all day and since she didnt have an express pass we told the ppl it was her birthday and they let her skip the lines with us. So fun. We got home from there about 9, and my grandmother got sick. We had to call an ambulance. They picked her up around 11:30. I had to fill out paperwork. She and my grandpa came back around 3 am, and then i made sure everything was ok and we went to bed. We got up at 4 pm, messed around and went swimming. We were in the hot tub with Mariah when we met this girl named Kelley. We were talkin about this guy named Colby, and come to find out it was her brother. We laughed about that. We met Travis and Tony and then we went swimming. (We as in me, amber, kelley, tony, and travis.) The kicked us out because it was 10:00 and the pool was closing. We met up with Colby, chilled with everyone until 11:30 and then went to bed. Friday me and Amber got up, went to MGM studios, and then came back, packed, and went to bed. Saturday morning we left for Panama City... thats a whole nother blog. *lol*

      Wow, so much has happened since I left for Florida. Me and Kayla left for Florida on Saturday morning. (the 12) We stopped in Daytona and stayed for the night and then left Sunday morning for Cocoa Beach. We got there around 2, but couldnt check in until 4 so we messed around for a couple of hours. We got unpacked. Then went and walked around and checked out the place. Then came back and went to sleep. Monday we went swimming, and I met up with Mariah and she introduced me to Jeff. We (as in Me, Mariah, Kayla, and Jeff) went on the water slide and then Kayla decided to go lay out. So we did it again, like 3 more times. Then we (me, mariah, and jeff) went to the lazy river and talked and swam came over and said that i left her and she was goin up to the room to call her mom and rest. So, i said ok. I went up about an hour and a half later to get some food and get Kayla. And she was on the phone crying. I asked my grandma if I could go back down there. And she said yeah. So Kayla came back out and was depressed and upset which was bringin me down. We decided to go to Universal Tuesday and Thursday. She called her mom and her mom was coming to get her. We flew Amber out to Florida and went to pick her up Tuesday morning. Debra (kaylas mother) came and picked her up and they left, without telling my grandmother. It made my grandmother sooo mad and she called Debra to tell her that it was the wrong way to go about the situation. She hung up on my grandmother. Oh yeah, real mature. Like mother like daughter i guess. Kayla knew she was goin to be gone for a week. If she couldnt have handled it, she should have tunred down the offer and I could have taken someone else. It was rude of her and very immature and her mother isnt doin anything to help her by getting her out of something when she is upset. But whatever... I'll post more about the trip later on. My fingers hurt.

After our stay in Cocoa Beach, my grandparents are driving me over to Panama City to stay with my church friends. Im happy about that. I went to Whitewater yesterday... that was awesome. Not many people went, like 15. I got really close to Callie and Amber Tolbert. Im glad, they are fun. I'll post when I get home from Flordia... Im getting ready to go to the movies with Kayla and Drew. See you in a week!!! *muah*

      There was no church tonight, so I am CrAzY bOrEd... no one is on. Except for Katie, not saying she is boring or anything. *lol* I'll probably talk on the phone tonight, get a shower, blow dry my hair, go to bed, then wake up and go to church. *YAY* Then we are going to Whitewater... I have never been, so it should be fun. Plus, I get to see Drew. Maybe I'll post again tonight if I remember. But right now, grandpa is here with food! Chick-fil-a is the bomb!!!

      I didnt get to go to church today to see my friends because I had a dentist appointment and my mom took me. We had fun goofing off. I hope there is church tonight... I miss everyone sooo much. I'm IMing Chelsea so hopefully she'll tell me if we do or not. or, I could just call Greg and ask him. Yeah, thats probably what I'm gonna have to do. Me and Drew talked until 5 this morning... so I was dead tired. Oh well, it was WAY worth it. I like him alot... and I think I am falling in love with him. He makes me feel all happy and stuff inside. I like that feeling. I'll post later on about the church situation...

      I spent the day with Amber and Larry. I sure do miss Amber. She is growing up soooo quickely. She is like my little sister, so when I see her putting on tight pants or doing her makeup I wanna cry and help her and tell her not to do it all at the same time. But I dont, and i just hold it back and smile at her. She is getting so beautiful. And the guys know it... they better be good to her. I leave for Florida in 3 days! I cant wait to get away. I need the vacation. I wish I didnt have a dentist appointment tomorrow, because I want to go and see my friends at church. But Im going thursday and then we are going to Whitewater. I have alot of self esteem now. Like, all of a suuden I dont care what people think of how I look or if they dont like me. I like who I am and the people who love me like who I am and I have decided that all of that is enough. God made me this way for a reason, and God dont make no junk. *lol... i saw that on a little kids shirt today* So yeah... i'm going to wear my new bathing suit from Old Navy and my new shorts from Old Navy to VBS and then change into cheerleading shorts @ Whitewater. Yupp, thats the plan.

      Yeah, im sick... and i feel horrible. My grandmother thinks I have the flu. And it sucks b/c I was supposed to help out at VBS this week, and now I cant. :( But maybe i'll be able to go and see my friends before we leave for Florida. Speaking of Florida, we leave on Saturday morning!!! I'm glad I got sick this week instead of when we were in Florida. Other new, hmmm.... I broke up with Blake. Yeah, it just wasnt working out. I have feelings for Drew. And I want to be with him again. But i'm going to stay single this summer... ya know, just be me and have 'me time.' I think im going to lay back down and sleep.

      Summer brings new things... There is going to be a new me. It might not happen over night, but its goin to happen. New clothes. new attitude, ne hair, etc. Before, my style was preppy and laid back. I want to go edgy... not gothic, but kinda punk. Not all the way yet... but I need a change. Me and Drew are ok, i guess. I mean, we are talking and not yelling at each other. So, thats a good thing. Things wont be back to what they used to... but I wish they were. I miss him. Not as a boyfriend (even tho we had good times) but as a best friend... Today I went shopping with my mom, we got to bond a little bit. She was on the phone alot, which kinda was weird. But oh well. She said she was going to stop by tomorrow to see the girls. That will be fun. Well, thats all for now.

      I just got back from shopping at Southlake Mall with my grandmother. It was fun. I bought 4 new pairs of underwear from Aeropostale (2 thongs and 2 lowrise boy cuts), stuff for the girls that are coming to my party, a GA Bulldogs shirt, a FLA Gators shirt, and a bunch of stuff from the Icing. Me and my grandmother got to talk about stuff, and I think we bonded. I'm glad I got to spend time with her. Tomorrow Im going shopping with my mommy, that should be fun. Hopefully on Saturday (around 12) i'll get to spend some tmie with Blake, if he's not busy. We wont get to spend time together b/c he has to work. :( But I miss him sooo much. Then Saturday afternoon my friends (as in my gurls thaty i love and miss already) are coming over for a swimmin party. Thats gonna be awesome!!! Well, thats about it... lots of love!

      Summer is going to be fun. Saturday, which is the 5th, I have invited the girls over to go swimming and to chill. I invited Kayla, Amanda, Tonia, Hannah, Lauren, and Chelsea over. Kayla will definitely be there... dont know about everyone else, tho. Imma call them after I get off the internet and remind them about it. So yeah, food, swimming, shaving cream fight... we're gonna have fun. Yesterday me and Amber went to the mall and got pictures made. If I knew what I was doing I would put them on here... but I dont. So oh well. We got to spend time together. So that was good. Then we took her home and I came home and called Blake. We talk for an hour and a half. He is so sweet. I'm really glad that we are together. I'm finally over Drew.. so that is a good thing. I want to be friends with him, but im not going to push it. He'll come around... eventually. Thats all for now.

      Summer is probaly the most boring thing in the world. I miss everyone at school soooo much. Hopefully I'll get to spend time with all my friends. I have a boyfriend now... I have known him since kindergarten. Then we left and went to different schools in 5th grade, and he ended up at Grace. Coincidence? I think not... His name is Blake Combs. He's 15; 6'2; blond ish brown hair' blue/green eyes; so sweet. I could go on and on about him, but i better not... I'm going to Florida on June 13 (11 days from now) and will be gone from the 13th to the 20th. Kayla is coming with me... we'll have a good time. Amber is over here. So i'm gonna go and spend some time with her. Buh~Bye

      Ok, I have a bad worrying problem. Mark said he would call last night, and he didnt. And now his blog said he feels lost right now. I really dont want to lose him. I love him soooo much... I am worrying myself into craziness. Maybe I am just crazy and nothing is going on, or maybe something is going on and I'm too stupid to realize what I have done.

Thanks Mr. Fisher for the lovely driving comment: Oh, and by the way - be careful out there - I hear Shelby is on the road - do I hear the sound of screeching tires and the screams of nice old ladies crossing the road???????  I miss Mark...

      Wow. I am sooo happy. There was so much drama yesterday, but i'm soooo over it. The drama was: Hannah McClamma came over and Gilbert looked at me and said," I'll tell Hannah what you said." She asked what I said and I was like, oh yeah I hate you Hannah; you didnt hear? And we started laughing and she poured red fanta on my grandfather's shirt. *a braves shirt, and he said be careful with it* So naturally, I was pissed. So I walked off. And she started crying. Then one thing lead to another and she talked to me and Lauren in the bathroom. And I just started saying whatever came to mind. And i told her not to talk to me, I dont want the drama. And she told her mom and as I was walking off to go tell Mark bye, her mom has the audacity to ask what was on my shirt. I hate her mother. And I dont care who knows that. But, through all of that I got to spend all day with Mark. It was great. And then I went to Fun Town with Lauren and Callie. Then we went back to Lauren's house and spent the night. Callie came hone with me and then we met Mark and Adam at the movies tonight. We saw White Chicks. It was sooo funny. But even better than that, I was with Mark. He makes me soooo happy. We were sitting in the movies holding hands, and I had the best feeling. I was/still am sooo happy. He means so much to me. When he looks at me, I get lost in his eyes. And when he smiles, I cant help but to feel wonderful because I caused that smile. He makes me feel like I am beaustiful. I wish I could tell him how much he means to me, but I cant. Words truly can't describe how I feel. I love this feeling...

      Oh ya'll, or whoever is reading this, I like Mark soooo much. He makes me feel so special. Like, I cant explain it. I get all jittery and happy when I talk to him. Like i'm talkin to him now on IM and I am just smiling from ear to ear. *twitch, chelsea* Even tho he is like, 2 years younger than me, he makes me feel like he is all I need. This is like the first time in a loooong time I have felt this way. I dont like to use the word perfect, but he is seriously perfect for me. When we were together at Stone Mountain all I could do was smile. When I hug him, its like the&nbsp;most comfortable feeling in the whole world. He makes me feel safe and secure. And thats a really big thing for me. I love to look into his eyes, they are so sincere and caring. Like I'm the only one he's looking at. Oh man.... I like him sooo much!   And Mark, if you're reading this... you mean so much to me. *if you couldnt tell from above. lol*

      It's 8:35am right now and im getting ready to go to Taggarts for the last day of driving school. Well, its not really the last day, but its the last day of class. I have to take an 88 question final. Im soooo nervous. I know I could have studied more. Pray that I pass...   I cant believe how happy I am. I was talking to Drew last night about me and Mark and him and Kayla, and we couldn't even imagine to be this happy... ever. Mark makes me smile and laugh and gives me that warm and tingly feeling all over. People are probably thinking, a guy 2 years younger can do that to you? Yeah right... Well, yeah I am right. So, if you're gonna laugh or joke or you dont like it or you're jealous or you're just plain mean, shut the "h" up! *thanks Ted for that lovely little acronym*

      Tonight the church group went to Stone Mountain. It was soo much fun. I got to spend time with Kayla, Drew, my friends... AND MARK! I love spending time with him. He is sooo sweet. He always makes me laugh. When he was leaving he gave me this big hug *well, I have to stand on my tip-toes to reach him, lol* and a kiss. It was so sweet. And our friends were around, and he didnt care. That means alot to me. We are workin out pretty good, so far. And I think we could last for a very long time. At driving tomorrow we have to take our final exam. dum dum dum! Im sooo nervous and afriad I wont pass. Then on August 6 and 7 I have to drive to Atlanta with Ted. yay! NOT!!! So yeah, im still on my 'mark high', lol, and I dont think I have been this happy in a very looong time. I like this feeling.   Mark, if you are reading this I had such an awesome time tonight and I miss you already.

      Wow... so much is going on. Driving school is goin ok. Molly isnt talkin to me... Like, she's hanging out with Sara, so whatever. I am hangin out with Jessica and they guys. So that is kinda fun. Drew and Kayla are going out now. Yeah, did anyone tell me? No, I had to find out by joking around with him.&nbsp;*dont ask* So yeah, my "best friend" couldnt even call and tell me. So, whatever. Im happy for Kayla and Drew. They deserve to be happy. But what about me? I deserve to be happy, too. Dont I? I like a guy, but he is 2 years younger than me. I dont know if it would work or not. Plus, I know I would get made fun of by someone. Dont know who, but someone would. But, maybe it's worth it. Maybe not. He doesnt feel that way about me...&nbsp;I dont think. I got to drive alot today, thats a woohoo!!! Tomorrow is another day of driving school. Im kinda lookin forward to it. But that means its almost over. I'll have to get numbers from people so we can all chill. Yeah, thats it for now. But, whatever...

      I went to driving thingy today. It was so much fun. Joe King is Jeremy Hilton's cousin. So ironic. I had to take the A&amp;DAP (alcohol and drugs awarenesss program) test today. I was so nervous. It was 20 questions... I only missed one. Therefore getting a 95! YAY! Josh *really hot guy that goes there, and sits by me* and me were talkin alot today, and kinda flirting. And Clayton was kinda flirting with me. Josh took a drink out of my yummy chocolate chip cookie dough milkshake. Im not all oh my gosh, i cant believe it. It was like, wow, how weird. So yeah, it was a good class. Then my mom let me drive home from Jonesboro High School. But my grandmother wont. And I have to drive to Atlanta with Ted. I am soooo nervous about that. I'll hopefully post later.  &nbsp;&nbsp; **I miss the Awkward Romance... I wanna see Stu and Seth**

      Me and Kayla had a great talk last night... well, this morning. We are "back together" as we decided to call it. Yeah, I'm so glad everything is cool with us. Im really happy that she and Drew are happy. She deserves happiness. Today I went to that driving thing. And to my surpise it was actually kinda fun. I made friends: Molly *crazy cheerleader*, Sara *sweet runner*, Caroline *beautiful, nice, kind girl*, and I talked to Joe, Clayton, and Josh. We talked and stuff and goofed off. Ted, the instructor, is sooo different. He's 52, black, and has a bad knee. He is veeeeeery outgoing and cracks jokes on everyone. He says pissed off alot, and what the h, or scare the h out of you, etc... But he never says hell. Its soo funny. But, he says stuff and is joking, and looks sooo serious. Its kinda creepy. So, this week will definetly be interesting. My mom let me drive from my house to Golden Corral. There I saw Lauren Roberts and her family. AND my 1st grade teacher and her family. It was so cool. Everything is going pretty well around here. And i keep thinkin "Well something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good." -Nickelback, Feelin too damn good.- Thats all for now... maybe more later.   I LOVE THE AWKWARD ROMANCE... IM OFFICIALLY OBSESSED! go to their website,  urlLink www.theawkwardromance.com

Yeah, I care about him... but whatever happens, happens and its for a reason. Me and Chelsea are officially obsessed with The Awkward Romance. Yeah, we love them... alot.&nbsp;I am in a happy, yet tired mood. I wonder how that works... Tomorrow I start driving school. Its only for a week, so I hope it wont be too bad. Maaaaybe i'll meet this really hot guy there, and i'll fall madly in love with him and spend every moment with him. Or maybe not...

Drew went to Kayla's church today. He really likes her alot... like ALOT alot. You can read about it  urlLink http://www.xanga.com/bmxpunks2000 &nbsp;there. And I feel so left out. Like we had this awesome conversation last night, well this morning really, and I thought it was going to get better. But not once did he mention me. It's all Kayla, Kayla, Kayla... I love Kayla, dont get me wrong. I&nbsp;am just&nbsp;pissed at Drew.

      I LOVE THE AWKWARD ROMANCE!!! k, thats out of my system. The concert was sooo awesome. They are so cool. It was totally awesome. Im still hyped up and deaf from it. Stu gave me a drumstick and he and Andrew signed it. Hey Michelle-> "ELI DRANK OUT OF MY WATER... OH MY GOSH *shrieks and gets all happy, then faints*" It was fun. We were jumping around and head banging like idiots. It was great. On a more drama front- Drew is bein totally mean. I dont know what his problem is. I told him I love him and he said he doesnt believe me. What the hell is up with that? Ya know, whatever. Im going to have to get over him, at least for now. I cant constantly be down because of him. Martina McBride sings a song called how far and it says "How far do I have to go to make you understand; I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are. So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far" and thats how I feel... Im here if he wants me, but im not going to waste my summer feeling sorry for myself. And maybe I'll go out with another guy and have fun. He'll get mad, but oh well. *man, that sounds bad* But, I deserve to have fun...

I told her I was sorry and that I still love her and she is still one of my best friends. She said she has to think about everything going on. Good sign I hope. Tonight we are going to see the Awkward Romance play and then&nbsp;Lauren is coming home with me. So yeah, im in a pretty good mood...

      Im on an ancient computor... it is so slow. But, it has the internet, so I am happy. Not too much is going on. Tuesday me and drew stayed on the phone from 3:00am to 7:15. Then we went to the church at 8 and worked at the food pantry. After that Drew went home and me and Lauren and Rusty stayed at the church all day. I hung out with the day camp and watched 'The Ring'. That is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. But it was good, tho. Then i was in the nursery for the meeting. It was sooooo hecktic. Today I just chilled out and went swimming. Tomorrow night we are going to see the Awkward Romance play. I have been thinking alot about everything going on. I miss being friends with Kayla. She is the person I could come to about tampons, boy problems, anything. I miss not having her there. I dont know what else to do. I sent&nbsp;her an e-mail apologizing. So, whatever happens... happens. Im so happy for Amanda and Terry. They are finally together, well they have been together for a while and im just posting about it. They are sooo cute. *lol* Im in love with Drew. He makes me soo happy, but then he makes me sooo mad sometimes. But, thats just him. *lol* My grandparents are making me go to this stupid driving thing next week. That sucks. Well, thats about it. &nbsp; HEY MARK!!! There, you're in here. *lol, honeybee*

      Im over at my moms house. Last night, me, Jessie (my brother) and Nikki (his girlfriend) went to Wal*Mart to get some stuff. We got home around one. Then me and Jessie were sitting outisde near his car and we were talking. It was about 2:30am. I told him that a man was walking down the street saying he needed help. Come to find out, he had been jumped and pistol whipped. He had 2 big gashes on his head and a big bump where they kepts hitting him with the pistol. His hand was broke and had cuts all over them. He was only 16; he was walking home and people puled up in a car and jumped out and started beating him. He looked soo pathetic and helpless. i was talking to him and telling him it would be ok. You cant even walk home these days without getting almost killed. I hate the human race...

      MAAAAN... I hate not having a computor. We have a bunch of viruses in ours and now the people have it and are fixing it. Therefore Im at the library. IN THE SUMMER?!?!? Dont tell Amanda. *lol* Not too much has really gone on. Me and Drew made up, and we are best friends again. I have to admit, I lied. I love him and I want to be with him, more than anything. He completes me. Me and Kayla havent made up yet, but im not going to be bothered with it anymore... Whatever happens, happens. My grandmother is doing alot better. Her bite doesnt hurt her much. I got a new phone. And it was about time. It is a Cingular LG flip phone. It's ok. Its pretty square, but cute. In it's own lttle way. *lol* Thats all I can think of to write about. I know I will be back to get on the internet. Ok, if I think of sumthin I'll write it down so I wrote forget it. Like someone else I know, AMANDA!!! *lol*

      Friday and Saturday was such an awesome 2 days... Me and Lauren went shopping on Friday, so we were excited about Justin's gifts. I got him 2 shirts (one said baseball on the front and had a bat and a ball, and the other one is green and says lucky on it) and the Linkin Park cd. She got him an outift, boxers, a bathing suit, the nickleback cd, and socks. (dont ask... i dont know) So, we came together and picked out a "gag" gift for him. We found this awesome baseball bag. Then we bought him a pickle card (inside joke... again, dont ask) and signed it. We bought him a thong, which he has to wear on the beach in FLA, some spaz juice (again, another inside joke) and something else... but i dont remember what it is. *lol* We got to his house around 2, opened presents, left at 3, picked up Jeremy's mom. Went to the bowling alley, met up with the rest of his family. Thats when I met Jeremy and Amy (a.k.a. "Brown Eyes"). Jeremy is really hot, and funny... So we went to laser tag, in which we got KILLED. Lauren kept shooting me (and I was on her team) on accident and shooting herself. *typical lauren* Then we went to Ryans and ate. Then we went to the movies. (it was 7:15 by now) We decided to go and see White Chicks, but it didnt start until 8:10. So we walked over to Barnes and Noble, then went to the movies again. We got in and it filled up FAAAAAST. So we left there and went to see 'The Terminal.' We sat like *Jeremy, Me, Justin, Lauren, and a seat over was Amy* She was feeling left out... We left the movie before it ended, but its ok. Then Jeremy went home (he didnt say bye to me, he will die the next time I see him) and Ms. Debbie took me and Lauren to her house. And we talked to Mrs. Lynee for a while, ate a snack, and then went to bed. It was such a fun day/night.

      Last night we went to the Braves game, in which they won 9 to 1. It was fun... Then the van ride was interesting. Rusty brought this really hott, sweet, funny guy with him. His name is Andy. He is 16, blueish green eyes, dirty blonde hair, and a really nive body. He's pretty skinny, and I dont really like skinny guys, but I can make an exception. ;) But im gonna try to get Rusty to bring him more often. We just chilled and talked and stuff. Then me and Lauren came home and talked and watched tv and went to sleep. Then we woke up at 9 this morning, got ready to go, went to the mall, then I went back to her house, and then I came home. We wrapped Justin's birthday presents. He is soooo hard to buy for. My goodness. It was crazy. I'll write about what we got him a little later. But, Im wiped out. I had to fix dinner tonight... well, its cooking. Maybe thats what that burning smell is. Hmmmmm

      I'm sitting here, in such a good mood, eating some delicious birthday cake... (its my g-pa's birthday) and im basking in my good mood!!! Im sooo damn happy. Today I went to church. And class kinda sucked, but it was ok. I got to see all my friends and chill with them. I got to see Drew, man I love him. :) He's nuts. (no pun intended) Got to see Adam, my pimp daddy! He is just too sweet and cute. dumdedumdumdum#2 and i like you but i dont like you. *inside jokes* Hes such a hottie! And got to see Mark. Ah, this is what makes the night great... He wouldn't look at me. Not once. It was hilarious. He is soo pissy and bitchy. But, I didnt do it. He put himself there. So, its funny to me. Maybe I am a sick, twisted individual. But other people agree with me. And, I got to talk to Danny, which is awesome. Tomorrow Im goin somewhere with my g-ma and then goin to my moms house then over to Wanda's house and spending the night with her. Then Friday we are doin a yard sale at her house. And then goin home from that and to Orientation at 6:30 for school. *yay, gotta look cute for that* Then back with my mom, spending the night with her. Then doing the Yard Sale again Saturday. Come down and see me, and buy something. (140 Amanda Court, Stockbridge... the street after Ricos.) Well, thats about it. Love You! *unless you are Mark, Hannah McClamma, Shelia McClamma, and any other bad people I cant think of... hahahahaha, i crack myself up!*

      I think, or would hope, the guy who this goes out to knows who he is... if he doesnt then he needs to be slapped. *lol*  I thought it was too good to be true I found somebody who understands me Someone who would help me to get through And fill an emptiness I had inside me But you kept inside and I just denied Some things that we should have both said I knew it was too good to be true  Cause I'm the only one who understands me What happened to us? We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us? And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only?  Remember they thought we were too young To really know what it takes to make it But we had survived off what we have done So we could show them all that they're mistaken But who could have known The lies that would grow Until we could see right through them Remember they knew we were too young We still don't know what it takes to make it  Wow, I love the lyrics to that song...

Im probably going to watch movies and talk on the iternet all day. I have nothing better to do. Tomorrow is church. Danny, a guy that I met thru a website, talked to Mark last night. It was so sweet. He stuck up for me like no one else has. I feel so special... I cant post it b/c it is too long. Danny is sooo awesome! School orientation is Friday night. So that should be fun. I think I am going to spend the night with my mom on Thursday and Friday night. I dont want to see my aunt and uncle, who are coming down on saturday, so she is my escape route. *lol* Thats about it going on here... Myabe I will post later... if it lets me.  And I don't want to fall to pieces I just want to sit and stare at you I don't want to talk about it And I don't want a conversation I just want to cry in front of you I don't want to talk about it 'Cause I'm in love with you

      Geeze... not too much is going on, but im so worn out. *hence the title, lol* Lets see... Thursday I dont remember what I did. Friday I went to my moms and to Wanda's house. I got to chill with Chris and hang out over there for a while. Then I spent time with Denise and talked to her about my problems. *will talk about them at a later date* Saturday I drove with Ted. WOW, that was an experience. I drove on the expressway, downtown atlanta, and I have never done that. Today I drove with him again and parallel parked and backed into a parking space. That may not sound like much, but i broke down in the car. He was yelling at me. But, I passed. Which is sooo good. So then I went to my mom's house. And then to Wanda's house. Me and Chris hung out for a couple of hours and did crossword puzzles. *haha, brother!* Dont ask, inside jokes. But yeah, he is really cool and fun to hang out with. Tomorrow I have a counseling appointment and then I'm going to get my hair highlighted and trimmed up beofre school starts. So yeah, thats about it. It's about 15 minutes until midnight. I think I might shut it down for the night and read the books I have. It's about astrology and its awesome. *thanks karane* So yeah, ttyl.

TaLlDuDe1120: ....... TaLlDuDe1120: im sorry  for being an ass purpleXfairyXtar: ? TaLlDuDe1120: im sorry TaLlDuDe1120:  for being an ass purpleXfairyXtar: what are u talkin about? TaLlDuDe1120: i d/k TaLlDuDe1120: kayla to me to apologize TaLlDuDe1120:  for being an ass purpleXfairyXtar: if u dont wanna apologize for being a jerk, then you dont have to TaLlDuDe1120: well i did purpleXfairyXtar: do u mean it? TaLlDuDe1120: yeah purpleXfairyXtar: ok purpleXfairyXtar: do u still like me? TaLlDuDe1120: not really purpleXfairyXtar: ok... TaLlDuDe1120: ok... I am sooo hurt right now. I am depressed, yet again. I hate Mark. I hate guys... God, I hate the way I feel. And I cant believe I still like him. I am so stupid! I am not going to fall for another guy. At least not for a while. I feel like I could die. Things Im thnkin about: Why do you care about me now when I want to die, and not then when I wanted to live? The scars will last forever, But nothing compares to the pain that put them there. How can someone come into your life for such a short time and leave such a bad scar on your life and heart?

      Wow, I am sooo tired. Monday I went to Six Flags with Amber, Tina, and Johnny. It was fun. We get there about 12 and left and 6. I spent the night with her Sunday and Monday night. We stayed up talkin and playin with Katelyn. Then Tuesday I came back home and we went to Tanger Outlet Mall. Then Danielle came over to spend the night *shes here now* and we stayed up until 5 or 6 and then got up at 12. *lol* Today we are just gonna chill here. We might go to church. But I dont know if I wanna go. *shame on me* But, Oh well. Tomorrow I wanna go shopping. Friday I should be going to my mom's house to help with the yard sale. ThenSaturday I am going to drive to Atlanta with Ted. *not fun, not looking forward to it* So, I should keep pretty busy. I might post in between. Who knows...

Thanks alot guys. But whatever. It hurts really bad, but I have to but that same happy masl on and play it off like I dont give a shit. Well guess what... I DO! I am so mad and upset all at the same time. And the really bad part is, I still have really strong feelings for him. How do I always get myself into these things? No more expectations and hopes for me. I'm not getting let down anymore!
