      On this site i plan to create a kind of history of my involvement with comics, my status as a creator of comics, and perhaps a bit about why i think it is that comics are important to me.  At the moment, i'm reading 2000ad ( urlLink www.2000adonline.com ), the best british comic out (non-indy, that is), and i also borrow graphic novels from my local library, to keep abreast of the latest boredom from d.c, or to be amazed by the works of Neil Gaiman, esp the 'Sandman' series.  I recently read Scott Mcclouds' awesome work, 'Understanding Comics' for the second time, and this lead me to discover his website,  urlLink www.scottmccloud.com  . There is some amazing stuff on there, and a great section on his inventions. My favorite of these has to be the '24 hr Comic', basically it does what it says on the tin; a comic in 24 hrs, 24 pages (with or without cover), with 6 panels per page, totally spontaneous. Well, in the coming holidays, that's what i plan to do.  Along with this 24 hour comic, which by the way is getting to occupy a large % of my thoughts, i.e, 'i wonder if i can do it', 'i wonder if it'll be a good story, well drawn', etc etc , blah blah, i am also doing a more controlled comic-album, more of which later...ctd...

      Comics History/Update #1:  October 03 - I attended a talk on 'Underground Comics' in a local library by cartoonist Hunt Emerson,  . This talk inspired me to turn my constant doodling into comics form; my doodling/comics output increased significantly following that talk. The talk itself was not attended by many, but the few who were there were true comics fans. Hunt Emerson (website -  urlLink http://www.largecow.demon.co.uk/ ) also drew a cartoon for me with my fountain pen before i left. A month or so after that i dedicated a Sunday to making my first mini-comic, which i called 'Jam-Packed Comics'...to be ctd...     urlLink

       Hello again chums! Well, i'm slightly less obsessed with comics for the moment (due to the fact that all my pens and good paper has run out - must remeber to get some this weekend). Well, this floomatozalia strip (my most visually...aesthetic to date) is in my new comic, as is the robot strip, avec a page of 'mysterious-explanatory-text (a paradox if ever i typed one). Also 'a day at the seaside. All these will be computer edited, with the robot-strip page being used for promotional stuff, ie flyers. I still need to scan floomatozalia.  Anyway, i'm sure you find all this terribly exciting. Oh, and the munificent Paul Scott has offered me space on the 'Solarwind' table at the next convention, but you probably knew that anyway, didn't you? Also, check out the site;  urlLink www.solarwindcomic.co.uk  .    As i say, the quality of my current output (excluding the finished strips etc) is a bit scrappy, and i know a good workman shoudn't blame it on his tools but...   Music: it's the long hols for me now, and i have been enjoying my latest purchases cd-wise; the debut self-titled album by 'the music' (on the zane lowe show next week on radio 1!).   Gtg! Bye!

       Hello again! Well, now is the time i like to refer to as 'that time when you don't have anything to do, so fill the time with making weird comics', or, as others may have it, the 'summer holidays'. Yes, it's that time again kids.    Well, i haven't been doing much more than a couple of random panels a week this past month, but these past few days, yesterday esppecially, it's all made for a much more creative me. Yesterday, i completed my first 2-page (a4, that is) comic strip, which i entitled alternaively 'floomatozalia', or '03:04'.   The idea for the story came from this word i'd made up about 4 months ago, and has been bugging me since in various ways, so i decided to do a comic about it. Well, in this particular comic, floomatozalia is a ghost-like, abstract representation of an ancient monarch whose "kingdom was his own mind, his subjects were his thoughts and creations". King Floomatozalia goes crazy in the end, mainly because his clock stops. Etc...    This story is certainly one of the most visually enticing, revolutionary, if not entirely professional-looking, of all my comics to date. I'm talking with web-wise friends at the moment on how i could find a means of displaying these paltry wares to you, the non-paying public, some time in the none-too-distant future, so thats something you have to look forward to, anyway.   Cheers!

      I've spent the past couple of days using whatever ingenuity i may have in me to publish my first 'professional' minicomic, from an old story i did, 'A Day at the Seaside'. I've done a test-run of them, and there are now two copies in existance, one which i will keep, and one which i am sending to a canadian comics creator (hopefully) along with something totally non-related. This comic Will see light of day at upcoming Comic festivals in Bristol, and possibly London, and it is an Alternative to my megalithic comics project which may not be printable in such a format.  Ok, the cover of the comic is now online, at the usual site, (  urlLink http://www.nuls.biblio.net/~jrmorris/141521/page_2.html  ) and if anyone wants to get hold of a copy (8-pages, lovely blue paper used for the minimalist cover) just contact me via my email, found on my profile (top right of site).  Cheers,  -James  p.s: I'm planning another minicomic, same format, all about self-penned haiku. Other randoms in progress aswell.

      Well, the cover for the comic is complete now, and a new title has been finalized : 'One, Sayeth the  Spider'. After a bit more jiggery-pokery on l'ordinateur i should have all my strips fonted where there are great chunks of my   writing, and i also need to practically layout the proposed 8 pages for printing on 4 pages of A4  . More interestingly, i did a rough layout for a new random strip which may just squeeze its' way into the comic, 'Barnaby Frozen', a title i had for a while, and felt like putting pictures too. It's primarily a humourous/abstract story, and Barnaby himself is a funny little guy.  cheers,  -james

      Amongst other things, i'm working on one about insects - existential and stylised insects. I'm trying to finish part 3 of floomatozalia (the difficulty is in maintaining the same structure of the 1st two without copying them outright), and there may be a few randoms in the near future. Editing of old stuff continues.  A Bientot,  James

      Well, i'm fairly new to this blogging lark, so i hope you'll forgive me for not posting the pictures directly onto the site (I will do when I figure out the coding for it). Part 3 of Floomatozalia is in development stage at the moment; it involves themes such as inca temples and ancient sacrifice. And the moon, that's another favorite of mine too. I think for my comic (should be ready and printable by September) i'll have 8 pages - special cover, with details, title etc, back page, with bonus strip, contact details etc, and inside the complete floomatozalia story (or maybe 3-page, and something else to fill it. Ok, bye everybody.  -James  p.s - the screenshots for Gta San Andreas are looking slick

      Today, an interesting thing happened...i got a new dell pc, with printer/scanner/photocopier. All means for swifter publishing of new comic.     News - A good pal of mine, Steven, has joint-created a new idea for a strip, all about a morse-communicating giraffe of the name Brucey...more news to follow...  Be pure, be vigilant, behave!
