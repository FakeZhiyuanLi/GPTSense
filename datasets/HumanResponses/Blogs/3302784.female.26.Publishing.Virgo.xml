      I swore I wasn't going to turn this blog into a moaning and bitching forum, but I have to share my feelings.  Some sort of twisted therapy, I guess.  The following is a letter I've fantasized about sending out to Markell's entire family and all his friends.  Then I thought about having someone hand it to him at the hospital when Chamberlin is born. Then I realized that I'm being insane and I can't actually allow anyone to read it.  But it's real, and I wish they could all know the truth.  I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW:  When he was sick, I took care of him. When he was broke, I gave him a place to stay. When he didn't have a car, I drove him. When he was hurting, I was warm and caring and supportive. When he was sad, I tried hard to cheer him up. When he needed me, I was there.  I thought that these things meant that we were friends.  When I got pregnant and found out about the cancer, he abandoned me. When I was broke, he asked me for more money. When I didn't have a car, he refused to drive me anywhere. When I was hurting, he took advantage. When I was sad, he ignored me. When I needed him, he turned me away.  I may not be the girl for him, but I deserved better.  I want you all to know that he cannot be trusted or relied upon.  No matter what he says, his selfishness will always reign supreme. He is a coward, ruled by an obsession with what others think of him. He can be charming and gentle, but it is an act.   He is heartless at his core, and cold to his center. He does not know sympathy, appreciation, or friendship. He knows betrayal, pettiness, and cruelty. He cannot fathom what it means to respect. He will allow you to take the blame, pay the check, make the first step, and carry the heaviest load each and every time you offer.  Continue to love and support him because you can't possibly stop - but know that he is undeserving. He is not worth your effort - any of you. He gives nothing and feels nothing in return.  He is empty.  His misery will infect you if you let it, and he will use you up and leave you as empty as he is, if you allow it.  A fair warning from his best friend, S.

      I'm feeling very pregnant today.  I have a big round belly and it feels good to hold it.  My back and legs defy my commands when I try to stand up.  I have to sort of roll sideways into a standing position, and the image of the Michelin man comes to me in flashes.  Little known fact: Pregnancy somehow affects your shoes.  My work shoes make my feet look like potatoes and my sandals cut off the circulation to my brain. The May-May and I walked the spongy-turf track at GE this afternoon, then went out for ice cream.  My left foot is bitching loudly about it, but I pay no mind.  It was raining on and off, and steam was rising up from the pavement.  Late spring in the South is something to behold.  For some reason, when the guy asked me "wet nuts or dry nuts" for my hot fudge sundae, we started snickering and eventually both became hysterical.  Loving this innocuous diatribe about potato feet and wet or dry nuts.  But, then again, not so much.  S.

      I can tell by reading these posts that I haven't really accepted that I'm going to be a single mom; that he's really gone; that he really doesn't care.  But last night something happened that devastated me, and my new goal is to move on from this as quickly as possible.  I have to get over him.  There are no more games to be played with myself.  To quickly summarize our past, where was I?  Oh yeah, epilepsy.  So we'd known each other about three months and his seizures were becoming out of control.  He took medical leave from work and started taking a medication that had him sleeping about 12 hours a day.  At the same time, the child support for his son kicked in for the first time, and his roommate stopped paying the bills.  When he lost his apartment, I let him move in.  It took months for the doctors to find a medication that would stop the seizures and allow him to be awake for the entire day.  During this time, it seemed like he was either sleeping or having a seizure 24 hours a day.  I learned how to cook a few things, and bought a lot of fruit, trying to nurse him back to health.  We moved the mattress from the bedroom into the living room floor so that if he had a seizure while I was gone, he wouldn't fall off the bed and injure himself.  I was working as a waitress but I tried to spend as much time at home as I could.  I stopped going out with my friends completely, and some kind of bizarre maternal instinct took over.  He was miserable, lonely, felt lost without his work (counseling adults with mental disabilities), and Kam's mom (Trish) was being no help at all.  Eventually the bills got out of control, and I took a second job catering to businesses in the mornings.  Markell and I drank a lot of beer, even though he wasn't supposed to, talked a lot about his son Kam, and generally fell in love over hamburger helper and late night TV.  By the time the doctors discovered that phenobarbitol would do the trick, we were like two peas in a pod, and no one could separate us.  The interracial thing made our families raise eyebrows, and Trish did everything within her power to use Kam as a bargaining chip to get Markell to come back to her, but those things just seemed to knit us more tightly together.  We had fights though, big ones, mostly because of stress and our enormous daily alcohol intake.  During one of these fights, Markell told me he might have a daughter.    Crystal (another one-night stand, much like Trish had been) thought the baby belonged to another man, but she'd had the guy tested and he was not the father.  She was sure that Markell was baby Cassidy's dad.  Markell thought I would break up with him after this announcement.  After all, I was 24, had no children, paid my own bills and generally partied and had fun most of the time before I'd met him.  But I was fascinated by all the drama by this point, and I stayed, never dreaming that I would one day be a part of it.  I'd been a journalism major in college, and was kind of watching it all from the outside.  It was a mistake of gargantuan proporations.  As it turns out, if you play with fire, you DO get burned.  So Markell was in fact Cassidy's father, and Crystal turned out to be much nicer than Trish about visitation.  Whereas we had to fight tooth and nail to get Kam for a weekend, we had Cassidy whenever he wanted.  She is a beautiful, quiet, well-behaved and VERY loving toddler, and I had a blast getting to know her.  (I miss her so much right now.)  Financially, though, the timing was terrible.  Just as Markell was beginning to bring in a full-time paycheck again, Cassidy's child support kicked in and it was as if he'd never gone back to work at all.  The lack of money on top of the medication and Trish's antics depressed Markell beyond all help.  There was nothing I could do to cheer him up, and eventually he started going out every weekend and spending what little money he did bring home on beer out at the clubs.  We broke up that summer, just after our one-year "dating anniversary," and we both found someone else to occupy our time.  In August, Markell left his new girlfriend's house (see how he just moves in and uses women and their money until he's done?  I should have known all along...) and Jared broke up with me when HIS long-time girlfriend came back around. Markell and I had a tearful reunion and vowed to stop fighting and pushing each other to "that point" that had us throwing clothing around and vowing never to speak again.  I landed a fantastic job (a career really) making twice as much as waitressing, and we moved into a really nice two-bedroom apartment and actually started to get along with Trish a little bit.  We had the two kids every other weekend, and we took them everywhere we could think of.  I learned the diaper routine, how to get them to eat, how to read bed-time stories, and how to be patient.  I fell in love with them in no time.    But Markell and I were still drinking, and still fighting, and he was still going out without me on the "off" weekends.  He's kind of a cold guy, and every time I thought I'd broken down a little of his wall, he'd put it back up again, and with reinforcements.  Some days I thought we were really close, some days I thought we were best friends, and some days I thought he was using me and didn't care about me at all. Then, in January, I found out I was pregnant, and he lost his job at the Disabilities Board.  We broke up twice before this final time, but I always thought he was my friend.  We'd been through the worst together, and I thought he knew me and trusted me.  But yesterday, we were supposed to get together so that I could see the kids and he avoided me all day.  He couldn't be straight with me and tell me he didn't want to see me.  No, he just kept saying he'd call me back and he'd call back with another excuse about why I couldn't come meet him and the kids.  Finally, he invited me over (to his mom's, where he's staying) at about 11PM, and the kids were, of course, asleep.  I kind of fell apart and told him through these huge embarassing sobs that I was in a time of need right now and just needed to know he cared.  That I was seven months pregnant, had just been diagnosed with cervical cancer, and still hadn't accepted the fact that I was going to raise this child without him.  I told him that I didn't need all the answers about whether we were going to be together, I just needed him to want me around.    He told me that he wasn't even thinking about me right now.  That he couldn't support me through this pregnancy because he had "too much going on."  And then...then he said that he predicted I was going to be like Trish after the baby was born.  Me. Me, who's not even going to ask for child support, me who spent the past two years helping him and supporting him and being THERE for him.  Trish met him at a club and had unprotected sex with him that night and decided to have his child.  She's constantly begging him for money and making him feel like he's not a good father.  She is a money-hungry, petty, lying, loudmouthed, ghetto-talking, RIDICULOUS sort of person, and she's also a questionable mother.  There is nothing he could have said to hurt me more than that, and I think he knew it.  With bruised feelings and an inflated sense of pride, I told him that he didn't have to worry about me and the baby at all.  That we weren't going to need anything from him, so he could mark that off of his list of things to feel pissed and worried about.   I also quietly said that if he ever compared me to her again in front of my face, he'd regret it. I held his hand and told him Goodbye, for real, forever, GOODBYE.  And I sobbed hysterically on the long drive home.  This morning, I've set my answering machine to two rings so I can easily screen the calls when I'm home.  I will not answer calls from his family, from Trish or Crystal, from anyone on "his side."  I'll decide what to do about each of them once the baby is born.  I have to ask all of you, anyone who's listening, did I deserve this?  Did I let him get away with too much for too long so that his lack of respect toward me is my fault?  Oh, well...back to work tomorrow.  I'll have something other than Markell to talk about from now on. I HAVE to forgive and forget, starting right now.

      So, yeah.  Today was my doctor's appointment and all is well.  It's time for me to start going every two weeks instead of three.  She measured my belly and let me hear the heartbeat.  I paid $130, the first payment in a set of four. Joy.  Also had insane car trouble today.  This could only happen to me. The crooked-toothed mechanic wants $1350 to fix a head gasket.  Driving on it will cause the engine to eventually blow.  Nothing to do but park it here and save money for a few weeks.  Listen to the goodness that is my May-May.  Mary picked me up from the mechanic's, bought a small bottle of pinot grigio and an oven-baked pizza, brought me home where we ate on my balcony, and then walked Morgan, my mom's wiggly cocker spaniel.  Mom broke her foot two weeks ago and I've been doing all the walking.  But because my feet were swollen, the May-May took over.  Markell did not call back last night, and I haven't called him either.  Here's the lowdown:  We met in May of 2002, outside my building at the illustrious Fairway Club apartments.  He lived in the next building and was friends with the guy living below me.  We started dating and he immediately began having seizures that summer.  By August he'd been diagnosed with epilepsy...  Shit, he just called complaining about his life and I don't even want to talk about him anymore.  I'm going to bed.

      OK, so he called.  Just now.  Sadly, there were no answering messages to ignore, I was just here and answered the phone.  Also sadly, the much-contemplated conversation went like this..  Him: Hey. Me: Hey. Him:  What are you doing? Me: Nothing.  What are you doing, working? Him.  Yup, you know it.  Hey, have you checked the mail lately? Me: No. It's raining right now.  I'll check it tomorrow.  Why, did you need something? Him:  Yeah, the bank's supposed to send me an ATM card. Me:  OK. Him:  Well, that's all I called to...  Are you doing all right? Me: Yeah. Him:  Are you going to be up for a little while? Me: Yeah. Him:  I'm going to call you back.  I'm going to TRY to call you back. Me:  OK.  See, I should have said, "Don't bother!  I'm sick of being last on your list, asshole."  Or something.  Maybe eventually I'll get there.  S.

      "IF MY HEART'S SOAKING WET... BOY YOUR BOOTS CAN LEAVE A MESS." -Tori Amos  I am seven months along.  According to the various pregnancy websites that continually try to get me to spend money, this means that the baby is currently stealing all of my calcium in his quest to grow bones.  I'll let him, for now.  Today I am angry at my answering machine.  Each day that I come home and that little red "0" is displayed where a "1" or a "47" should be, I want to destroy the dusty black screen and yank out the snaking wires.  Day 16 and Markell did not call.  Of course, he could have called me at work but thinking of that wouldn't allow me to direct my anger at the answering machine.  Directing it at Markell isn't working.  I keep thinking that he'll leave all these messages and I'll ignore them.  I will not call him back for weeks, and then...One Fine Day...I will be home when he calls and I will say...  Me: "I have to go." Him: "Why?" Me: "Because I'm done. You will never hurt me like this again, and it feels great."  or  Me: "No, I don't want to hang out with you and the kids this weekend." Him:  "Why not?" Me: "Because I don't want you anymore.  I can do better and I aim to start this weekend."  or I could turn his words back on him...  "I have to get my head straight right now, but I'll let you know when I'm ready to talk."  or I could be really, really mean.  Him (after multitudinous bitchy remarks from me): "Wait, listen, how about if..." Me: "No. NO!  How about if you fuck off and I get to be happy for once?"  But...all of these nasty little jibes work better if he actually calls.  Which he hasn't.  Which I mentioned already.  Thank god Mary is coming over tonight.  She's taking care of everything - coming with me to the doctor's appointments, throwing me the biggest baby shower of all time; and spending every free moment with me so I don't have time to hate the answering machine.  I know I'm supposed to call him and tell him when the doctor's appointments are scheduled.  I know I'm supposed to be the bigger person and accept a mild sort of friendship/parenting thing with him.  I know it's time to grow up.  I'm having trouble with that though, because he cheated.  But I'll talk about that next time.  S.

      Welcome to the blog that will dazzle and amaze you and your friends.  I am Shelley - a full-time technical editor, a poet, a Women's Studies minor, and a former participant in the Late Great Illegal Drug Experiment.   I am intelligent, yet dulled by persistent clouds of years-old pot smoke.  I am confident, yet plagued by the same beauty ideals that afflict most of us.  I'm generally shy and polite, but the two-faced Southern bitchiness I grew up around has jaded me to various tenants of social etiquette. (I will not put on a fake smile while meeting your racist stepdad.  I will not pretend to pray at most dinner tables.  And I refuse to smile blankly and nod when I disagree, despite everything I've been taught.)  I read a lot, laugh a lot, talk to my cats sometimes, and listen to Tori Amos really loudly when I clean.   I'm also 29 weeks pregnant.    My boyfriend moved out sixteen days ago, and now it's just me and the cats.  I get by with the help of Prozac, a group of merrily supportive friends, and now this blog.  For the sake of my own sanity, I'm going to let you follow me on this "long, strange trip" toward motherhood.  Join me, won't you?
