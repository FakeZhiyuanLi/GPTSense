      i just got home and i'm sober. i know. i'm makin that face too. u'd think i'd be all drunkies since it's like 2:30 but nope. i'm sober. how pathetic huh? i went to the yacht club(that's right. workin on my salsa moves!) with some kids from work and was dancing so much that i didn't have a chance to drink. i had two drinks the whole night. it was fun tho. we danced and made fun of people like always and just chilled. nothin special, but hanging out is always cool. now i'm home and jason and alexa were too drunk to drive so i told em they could crash here. BIG mistake. I think i hear em havin sex. i didn't really feel like washing but now i have to wash the sheets and stuff. they're weirdos so i'm sure they're not jut having "normal" sex. maybe i should sleep in the living room or somewhere where i can't hear em. my room&nbsp;is too close to the guest. anway, i guess i better go to sleep. i don't have to be at work til noon but i gotta go to my mom's to pick up my mail. ok yeah so i'ma sleep in the living room. this is retarded.

      I'm watchin for better of for worse right now and i dunno how these stupid people would put their wedding in the hands of other people. i dunno bout that. anyway, i went to sears today to try to get a fridge because the one i have at home is an old one my sister gave me. it's not working very well anymore tho. my ice cream looks like milk or like those frostys they sell at wendy's. so the guy was showing me fridge's and i found one. so then he starts trying to sell me a washer. i'm like, "no. i got one thanks." he's like, "well how bout a dryer?" and i said that i had one of those too. he's like, "well u really should take advantage of our no interest til 2006 sale." i was already irritated cuz of work and this retarded guy just made it worse. anyway, he kept offering me all sorts of things and i was like, "listen dude. all i need is a fridge." ugh. he's not well. needless to say he finally left me alone after 987454365 hours. after that i went home and went for a swim and now i'm watching for better or for worse. i swear. these people r dumb.

      Yeah thought I'd get ur attention with my subject. Anyway, this is my first entry let alone my first online journal I've ever done but I thought it was about time. So sorry to disappoint but that's why the subject is what it is. So I wish I had some cool stuff to say but I don't. Oh wait I do have a funny story from lunch today. I was at McDonald's eating by myself like a loser cuz I took my lunch late and all of the people from work hadn't eaten in like 56 years so they left without me. I was sitting by the door and some guy in a suit walks up to me and is like "Hey what's up?" I'm like, "I'm eating. That's about it." So he was asking for my name and shit like that while I was thinking how much I wasn't enjoying my meal anymore and deciding that I was gonna take this to go and putting my food in my bag . I mean who hits on people at a McDonalds?!? Oh well anyway, I was being all short and he noticed and left be4 I got up from the table. He was walking forward with his head turned back saying bye to me and smiling like a dumbass and BAM! He went face first on the door. Apparently he didn't know it had to opened first or something. Maybe it was a "u had to be there" moment but I thought it was pretty fuckin funny. Then of course I called everyone in existence and told em bout it. Anyway, that was the highlight of my day. Other than that, got outta work, went for a swim, and went to the track like any other day. I also cleaned up a bit which I needed to do cuz it was smelling kinda funky in the living room after this weekend. Which reminds me, someone left their trunks in my dryer. They're red and black just in case someone who was here this weekend reads this and knows the owner. Well I got them. I think they're sending me to Houston this weekend at work but I'm not sure yet. I hope not. Traffic there sucks. Plus I don't really feel like getting shot either. We'll see. Ok well I'm off to bed.

      so i was told that by answering those questions yesternight really helped in getting to know stuff about me. Of course not the deep stuff but just stuff that i like. i'll finish the list of questions later. i promise. Don't you wish that everyone wore a tag on them saying their pet peeves and what they're looking for when ur dating? Mine would say something like, "Sense of humor is a must, smart, modesty, and don't bother with me if ur looking for someone who's patient and doesn't have a bad temper." Whoa! I'ma get all the boys with that one huh? I was talking to a buddy of mine about that today and he said that that just takes all the fun out of going out with people. U'd never meet anyone like that. But i just don't like people to waste my time i guess. I'm not looking for anyone or anything, i just thought it was an interesting point. I was asked how many people i've loved in the past but i couldn't answer that becuz at that time i felt i did and then later on i get over it. then, does that mean i didn't really love em? i care about some boys that i've been with be4 and i think about them. but if they were to come into my life right now, i don't think i'd be with any of em. that is, if i weren't with anyone at the time. but then again, i dunno if i'm taking into consideration why we left each other or who did what to who. i don't make sense. anyway, we were talking about how he's been with girls that have done the whole "i've never loved anyone as much as i love you" speech. i told him i've gotten that too. then he asked, "do u think that if, let's say that person and i were together and then we break up, she'd be telling the next guy the same thing and so on and so on?" i dunno about that one either. that'd just be an endless cycle. til u got married of course but even at that, who knows. anyway, it's all complicated but oh well. that's how it is i guess. i don't know why people, girls especially, are in such a damn rush to meet someone. i guess i shouldn't say anything cuz i dunno what they're going thru. ;) ok well just wanted to share that convo i had with bob. i'ma go get some water. night people.

      so i haven't written in a long time. i've been stupidly busy with work and stuff. plus i went out of town. anyway, i haven't done much else but work. my cousin was in town and she's a pain in the ass so i'm really glad she left. martha and i are always arguing when she's here cuz lori's just back and forth telling one person stuff about the other person. ugh how annoying. anyway, i left to houston on friday which couldn't be more convenient for sylvia. syl moved over there for some stupid reason. well, it's cuz the girlfriend took a teaching job up there and she went with here. ahh the things we'd do for love. anyway, we all tried to talk her out of it but she just laughed it off and went anyway. i tried helping her unpack as much as i could but with these stupid conventions and what not, i did get pretty tied up. i hate houston. i dunno why anyone in their right mind would wanna live in that awful city. it's gross. anyway, they've got that cancer center there. that anderson hospital is supposed to be the best. least we get one good thing outta her living there. that's pretty much all i've been up to. haven't gone out or anything. i did manage to steal some water and 7up from some forgetful people at wal-mart. well, i wouldn't necessarily call it stealing. we got outta wal-mart and someone left a crate of drinking water and a 12 pack of 7up underneath the shopping cart. guess they forgot it. no one was around so i just took it. i had fun. and that's about it. gotta get back to work.

      So i just started this thing and i'm already slacking off. It's only cuz i wasn't here.  family from mexico came and i let them borrow my house. not cuz i'm nice or anything it's just that my sister bel who's getting married went to some church marriage retreat thing and she wanted someone to housesit. well my house is closer to my mom's than hers is so i let the mexico people stay here while i stayed at her place. kinda complicated, i know, but whatever trevor. anyway, i made everyone go over there to hang out but it was just alright. on friday we watched fast and the furious and gone in 60 secs and drank alcoholic beverages. wasn't exciting at all. yesterday i went to the mcallen all day and bought all kinds of stuff and then chilled at my mom's house. today the whole fam came over cuz fatty made burgers and chicken wings and we were all here. it was nice. oh oh oh i bought a flat iron from some infomercial and i love ittttt!!! it's the shit! it was a little pricey but i just love my hair. anyway, i pretty much had a boring weekend except for my cool hair. i didn't go to houston but i'm going this weekend. blah! i hate houston. oh i went to go see the village. i can't decide whether i liked it or not. i mean it was pretty good, but....um....ugh how do i say this without giving it away for those people who still haven't seen it. ummmm......fuck it. i wanted to damn monsters to be real or something. they were made up!! how disappointing. but i did like it. i can't decide. ok sleepy time.
