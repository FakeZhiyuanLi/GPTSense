        Now i don't think im the only one who thinks this year has gone fast!!!!          Welcome to my blog. This is the first time I've done anything like this so enjoy!          mmmk.          For all who hasn't got a clue who the hell I'am, my name is Katie, or, if you can't be stuffed saying that, like my parents, I'm fine with Kate!I'm 15 years old, in year 10, and i live in Western Australia in a small oddly shaped city called Perth, and on behalf of my state government, COME TO PERTH, IT'S er... GREAT, COME AND SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY SO WE CAN GO TO AMERICA CHEAP! so that shall be my tourism commitment for now. maybe later i'll post pics of my small city with my flashy digital camera.          Apart from dreaming i lived somewhere else i like to go to movies (Dosn't everybody!!), i like to listen to music but when you live in my house the biggest thing you could regret is giving your father a Dido CD only to have your mother and sister discover it and play it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.......          i'm a bit of a sheep when it comes to music, no i don't know anything about it and yes i only like the songs i know about, not some tiny little Perth rock band called Crown Fold that is cool to like because nobody knows about it and you can tell who ever the hell you like that there music rocks!!!! but in reality Sucks. Quite. A. Bit.          i like to think i like horror movies but i cant name one that scared me, unless i was alone in a cinema with no popcorn (a.k.a comfort food) and the movie was a jumpy horror (one with a lot of SUPRISES) e.g. dawn of the dead....i liked that one.          for future use heres my list of friends and what i think of them if i use there names in the not so decent future:     me besties:grace:           grace is real perdy, and shes real good fun cause she laughs at all my jokes (she laughs at anything) and she never gets on anyone nerves (cant say the same for myself!).          amber: shes GREAT fun we have so much fun doing random stuff together (we are both blondes) which i will share later in my logs          Sophia: is my rock! ( she says the same about me) now we have fun doing stuff weve never done before!!! and making fools of ourselves (share later).           i met all my betsties at school in year 1 (thats 9 and a half years i've known them!)at my very posh-yet-not-so-posh school (all girls)          TL: TL is my crush i wont tell you anything about him because he might come across this for some reason and i would be very embarressed!!! my besties know who he is!!!          today i walked home 7 km from Freo and it was pouring wid rain!!! anyway when i got home i saw my hair had blue streaks!!! i screamed then i thought of the possible possibilities of how it got there. they are:          1. amber and a blue high lighter          2. the stamp ink on my hand (doubt it)          3. some other mean person with a blue highlighterwill update with the answer when i question amber!!          anyway must go for today, cant wait for tomorrow when i add another chapter to my blog!          stay tuned
