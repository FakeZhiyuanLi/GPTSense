      Arthur is officially an outside cat now.  He's definitely a savvy guy, and convenience won out over my need to protect him from cars and coyotes.  He'll be okay, I'm sure.  And now I can open the windows and doors (and get some fresh air in this stuffy house!) and if he roams around and tires himself out he might not be so bored that he has to keep me up all night.  He really does enjoy his new freedom, and I know I'll enjoy it too.  Even Juno had a blast chasing the kitty around the back yard.  I worked late again tonight, stopped by Trader Joe's on the way home from work, and made salsa for dinner.  (Darn it, fresh salsa is good!)  No exercise today, especially since I drove to work.  In fact -- once again! -- I ought to get to bed so I can wake up in time to catch the bus tomorrow.  Yup.  G'night.

      And it's a tasty beer.  Go IPA!  I rode home from work again.  Bike odometer says it's about 5 miles, but I think it might be off -- maybe becuase I haven't bothered to calibrated it.  I'm thinking it ought to be 6 miles or so to get home.  Not a bad ride when it's such a great day.  Oh, and the benefit of leaving work at 8:30 is that it's starting to cool off outside.  (Yeah, I had to work late and wrap up some bids, so I gotta slip that nugget in wherever I can!  Cry me a freakin' river, eh?)  So I've been ever so slightly adventurous on my trek home.  I found a bit of a shortcut, where I can ride along a busy stretch of Northup -- by Lowe's -- but I get to avoid a heck of a hill.  You give up the super-duper downhill half of the big hill, and have to fight off cars, but it's really not a bad trade.  So then I get on the 520 bike path by Innovative Audio, cruise the nice gentle downhill slope there, and then get off at Cash'n'Cary to avoid the next big-ass hill.  Works well.  The overall trip is much better, and probably a hair quicker.  Short term goals:  Let's see -- I want to get my hommade wood-fired oven going.  Or ready to go -- that's the first step.  Gotta add some mass to the top to absorb more heat, and then some insulation to keep the heat in.  That would be a good weekend project; maybe even an evening project if I could get to the store sometime for the vermiculite to use as insulation.  That's tough, since the stores that might sell the stuff seem to close super-early, like 6:00 pm.  Also, I want to build a second oven at my parents' house.  They have way more room for such a big thing, and -- more importanly -- they'll stay put for a few years.  I think.  I, on the other hand, will probably move in a few months, so it'd be silly to invest much time in an oven here.  For the one at my parents' place, we need to work out what materials to use as a base.  Probably hunks of discarded concrete -- or "urbanite," as someone referred to it -- would work well, but I'd be concerned that they'd look tacky.  Bricks would be nice.  Nice large rocks would be awesome, if I could make that work somehow -- but I don't think that's gonna happen.  Urbanite it is.  Other goals --  get outside more.  Riding my bike is an awesome excuse to get some exercise.  1/2 hour a day is a good goal; if I can't bike, then I need to just go for a 1/2 hour walk.  Juno would love that, so there's really no excuse.  Get to bed on time.  Oops, it's getting to be dangerously close to "past bedtime" territory.  Better wrap up this rambling.  Get some dinner.  Damn, that's a good idea.  Bye y'all.

      I guess that's why they call it "work."  Gotta snap out of it -- I can't get crap done!  And there's lots of crap to do!  but I'm home now and having a beer and relaxing in this stuffy house in front of a fan.  can't complain at the moment!  it's freaking beautiful out and I got to ride my bike all the way home -- yay!  I should go play fetch with the dog now so I can get to bed soon.  I love to stay up late but damn if it doesn't just about kill me to do so!  In any case, I'm a happy camper today since I finagled a Gmail account invitation.  $2.25 on eBay was all it took!  I'm surprised by how clean and easy it is -- and I didn't expect that it'd be too much different from something like Hotmail.  In fact, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more to play around with at first.  But now that I've sent and received a couple e-mails, I see the beauty of it all -- a very clean and intuitive design, which is truly an accomplishment considering that they display things differently than most other e-mail interfaces.  Significantly different, but you can still figure out exactly what's going on with only a second or two of poking around.  And it's quite snappy, with all their fancy little javascript routines or whatever they use.  Beautiful.  Send me an e-mail -- just string together my first name and my last name, @gmail.com.  That's my biggest disappointment, I suppose -- your username has to be 6 or more characters, with a period being the only special character (and the period doesn't count as a character to get you up to 6).  I wanted mjt@gmail.com, but that's not gonna happen.  Alrighty.  This is the beginning of a beautiful blog.  We'll see how often it gets updated!

      It's a lot like the Adult Swim cartoons.  Super-spectacular for those of us who don't have cable (becuse Comcast sucks!) but still want to watch TV.  Don't miss the  urlLink Teen Girl Squad .  (BTW, it's taken me a week to post this, 'cause something on this site always distracts me.  Like  urlLink Strong Bad's E-mails .

      Now you can hook your iPod up to your  urlLink BMW !  Even better -- for those of us without BMWs, anyway -- you will soon be able to do the same thing with an  urlLink Alpine car stereo !  Way cool.  And this is way better than the little cassette adapter or AUX input, since you can control it from the dash.  And it'll tell you what song is playing on your car stereo.  And it won't use up your iPod battery -- in fact, it'll recharge it.

      It's been a beautiful weekend, but now I just feel like crapola.  Too many thoughts to sleep, too little interest to write much down.  Here are a couple.  1) I don't want to go to work tomorrow.  Yeah, big deal, I know -- but it's getting to a bad point where I don't know if I should stay there or not.  I love it, but I also dread it at times, and that's not right.  Time to move on?  2) If I quit, should I stay in Seattle?  I've spent four years here.  It no doubt has a bunch to do with my personality -- too shy, I suppose, to ever say squat to someone I don't know -- but so far I haven't found Seattle to be a friendly place.  So I'm thinking either Portland or San Diego.    3) Oh man, if I move, I'm going to have to get rid of a lot of stuff.  Time to go through the garage and start giving stuff away.  I should be happy.  New places are fun.  I shouldn't be as worked up as I am.  Part of it is that I love the people that I work with -- for the most part, anyway -- and I feel like I'm doing quite well at a reletively difficult job.  That's worth a lot!  But I'm still burned out as heck sometimes.  Well, I'll try again to get some sleep.  I can usually count on myself to change my mind by morning time.  Not sure if that's good or bad in this case.

      I've got to say,  urlLink Trader Joe's  has an absolutely amazing array of nuts.  The Tamari cashews are super!

      I am -- at this very moment! -- connected to the internet by my new Motorola v710 phone.  Truthfully, I'm surprised that it works at all, but it does.  It's especially amazing, since I have an iBook and they only seem to ever make the "official" software for PCs.   urlLink This site  was super-helpful in getting things to work.  Of course it's slow.  But oh well, when I can't find an open Wi-Fi network, this'll do!

      I got my phone finally.  What sick bastard decided that Radio Shack should get to sell these things before Verizon stores?!  Oh well, the folks there at the Factoria RS were nice -- perhaps a little overly excited about the phone, but nice.  So, the phone is pretty nice too.  It's got a lot of things in the "good" column, like reception (Yay!  I can use it at home, unlike my AT&T phone!) and a kick-ass speakerphone.  And voice dialing, which the sucky AT&T phone had, but with this one, you don't have to record your voice -- it can recognize the name you say and matches it up with the correct entry in your phonebook.  Or you can just push the button and belt out the digits in a phone number, and -- after confirming that it heard you correctly -- it dials for you.  Don't know for sure how helpful that is, but it's a totally nifty thing to play around with.  Bad things, so far, are:  Bad outside display -- color, but still sucky.  The camera is sucky too, even though they advertise it as a 1.2 megapixel camera.  It's not, as far as I can tell.  The volume is a little weak in the earpiece, but it's not as bad as the AT&T phone, where you had to hold the phone in the  exact  right spot to hear anything.  Oh, and the ringer is super loud!  I can actually hear the phone ringing -- surprisingly, the Pansonic folks didn't seem to consider that important.  And the new Motorola can be silenced with the buttons on the outside of the phone, so if it does ring at a bad time, you can shut it up without wasting precious seconds fishing the phone out of your pocket, opening it up, and pressing the "end" key.  Seriously, when your phone is ringing at an inappropriate moment, it's super helpful to be able to shut it up instantly.  Bad phone with bad service:   urlLink AT&T's Panasonic GU-87  Good phone with good service:   urlLink Verizon's Motorola v710

      Oh, I was so happy to get an e-mail today, saying that Verizon Wireless was now selling a  urlLink cool new Motorola phone !  I just ditched AT&T and went back to Verizon -- using my old phone, so I still have the option to get a new one before my contract is up.  Perfect!  Except that they don't  really  have the new Motorola phone at Verizon stores.  No, that'll be later.  But it turns out that  urlLink Radio Shack  -- of all places! --  is  selling them.  And at lunch today, I tracked down two in the Seattle area: one at Totem Lake, and one in Woodinville.  I even managed to have the Woodinville folks set it aside for me.  So tonight I scrambled to make the bus to get home, then made my way through traffic up to Woodinville (thank God I don't have to do that every day!).  But guess what?!  No, really -- guess.  You'll never believe out what happened.  They already sold it!  D'oh!  Who could'a seen that one coming?!  They were kind enough to call the Totem Lake folks for me, but you know what?  That one was gone too.  Those bastards.  Now I have to wait, like, a whole freakin' week!  Life is hell, I tell you.

      I have Verizon DSL, which is great -- no problems at all -- except that I have to pay for my regular old telephone line too.  And I really don't use that phone; the cellphone gets me free long distance, so why bother with the landline?  So, in reality, it's $50-something a month for DSL.  Today I found out about a new deal from Speakeasy:  For an extra $6, they'll hook you up with DSL with  no  phone line!  Speakeasy isn't cheap, so in the end it'll still work out to $50-something a month, but it'll be twice as fast, and through a nice local company that, by all accounts, deserves my money far more than Verizon.  Right on.  In other news -- one reply to my ad on Craigslist.  Gotta go find pics of the place to send out now.  Cool beans.

      Oh, my poor neglected computer!  It's been so long!  A quick rundown of the things competing with the computer for my time:  I bought running shoes tonight.  Now I have to do some running.  I refinished the hardwood floor in my living room.  It looks suprisingly nice!  Goodbye dirty carpet!  My roommate moved out.  Now I have to put an ad up on Craigslist.  It worked well enough last time, but hopefully I can find someone who a) doesn't drink all my wine, b) doesn't smoke, even if it is just outside, and c) doesn't leave rotting food in the sink and fridge.  A dog is a bonus, so Juno has someone to play with during the day.  My car won't start.  I'd take it to someone, but -- well, I'd have to start it first.  Dang.  I really don't want to call a tow truck.  I bought a pasta maker.  Wow!  Homemade pasta isn't too tough to make, and it's pretty tasty.  This is fun.  I broke my record player's needle.  The poor guy has been sitting there, unplayed, for weeks now -- and when I do go to put a record on, I break it.  Gotta take it to the stereo guys at the store now, since I never figured out what's involved with aligning a record player needle properly.  Shoot.  I bought new molding for around the living room.  It's pretty simple -- just unfinished pine boards -- but now I have to stain and finish them.  Oh, and cutting them to the proper lengths is probably important.  Shouldn't be too hard, but it has been too hot out for me to want to be cutting boards and inhaling stain fumes.  My Apple Airport Express came.  It's fun!  I can play songs on the living room stereo from the computer in my bedroom.  Very cool -- now I can put something like 2 months' worth of downloaded music on random.  Only problem is that if iTunes is playing in the living room, I can't play anything in my bedroom.  I bought Beastie Boys tickets and David Byrne tickets.  Both should be good shows, but it's depressing that these are the only two shows I've had to look forward to in a couple months.  I need to check out more of the smaller shows around town, which I usually find more enjoyable anyway.  That might be about it... oh, I did do some laundry -- not normally a monumental task, but I had quite a pile going.  It took a while to get things under control.  Next up -- vacation planning.  Gotta take some time off and go somewhere, but where?  Portland would be a good idea, and then I could say hi to Ty.  Oh, and his birthday is coming up soon... almost sounds like a plan!
