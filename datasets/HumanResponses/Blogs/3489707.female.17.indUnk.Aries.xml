      i feel so damn bad..i cant believe im actually doing that, albeit all that crap abt not skipping any lesson and being a good kid. :( shoot me please. and my grp.. they give me the feeling that im redundant. well i admit i didnt contribute much to the grp but..sigh. im not going to be good enough. but i will not start pitying myself. i deserve to feel what im feeling right now. i sux. :( and i gt to go explain to my ct abt not turning up for the chi test. im sorry. im really sorry for being a pig and a lazybum. i promise..this is the last time- i will   not   skip any lesson from now on. if i would to break my promise, he shall not talk to me or msg me for the rest of my life. that  is   bad enough.  speaking of him, i dreamt abt him. again. in my dream he joked around with me and inspired me to jump 2m for my sbj. LOL. choke on ur drink please. silly dream, but its still very funnie. he's cute :)  and i dreamt about my grandpa. in my dream he's sitting on the chair near the telephone and i walked up to him..asking him abt his children,abt his feelings for everything. he has a calligraphy class apparently, in my dream. is it because i miss him so much that i dreamt of him sometimes? i love him. if he were to know i wanna tell him that im still loving him. miss him loads.  i keep getting headache these days.. i must start taking panadols every nite to ensure a good night rest. hmmph. and i shall go school tomorrow. oh yes i will

      Hmm.. all right. im going to spill everything out now. its not like  he  will read this.  first up, about my feelings for asso, i think it might be infatuation. i think im soo dumb, i cant differentiate true love from crush. but then again, you cant blame me. i didnt experience true love before. bleah. i sound so damn desperate. i assure myself,  I am Not  despo for him. aniwae, he said he has a target already, and he's going to go after her probably end of this year or next year. im burning with curiosity. really.. he said it before too, that girls with loong rebonded hair and good complexion  and    not sporty   catch his eyes. i really wonder, does he think that all sporty girls are butches? or violent? or tomboyish?? hmmph.. darn it. he really got sth up his sleeves. i just know it. im really curious about his crush. a small part of me really hopes its me, but then again, i dont fit his description of course. stupid me. im not gd looking, dont hv smooth complexion, dont hv looong rebonded hair and definitely  am  sporty and not pale. i mean, who am i kidding? sheesh.  stupid him...urgh 2nd up, the more i get to understand her, the more i  don t understand her. sound paradoxical, but well, i realise that's more to her than her usual family and friends' problems. i @@ the real her, the more i get to know her, e more i realise how smart she really is. how cool headed she is. how intellectual she is. how... the list could go on and on. and im not surprised di is so over her. i mean, those with eyes can @@ right? LOL. im blabbling. as usual. haiz.  3rd, im getting real lazier and lazier by each day. i promised myself to follow my schedule for hols but i didnt today. bleah. i must stop being a procastinator. right now. tomorrow i shall do everything and finish what im supposed to do. by tomorrow. come on, im not that bad right? right.  4th, im still sick. but then, mum's words made me wonder whether i imagine it all up or not. is it because of stress or plain lazy? my not going to school has already attested to it. hmmph..  5th, whatever that i said..is crap. not really... haiz. i still like him. esp since he just msg me. even though its just a forward msg. but i hv a nagging feeling that he's just using me. they say women really think a lot. i think so too. hmmph.. but hey, im trying to be a lady here. so yeah :) im unique k..

      Last night was the worst night for me. i hate vomitting. i absolutely  hate  vomitting, and i did that last night. on my bedroom floor. how disgusting is that! esp the feeling of the vomit in ur nose. GOSH! i felt absolutely awful. that drink sux totally. i vomitted after my first cup. then i went to the sink and got ready to vomit again when i began drinking the second cup. i told myself, think of him. nothing but him. and i did it. not vomitting i mean. what a miracle. i miss him loads. tml's econs lect. yucks, but at least maybe i can get a glimpse of him. hopefully. how desperate i sound. haiz. but everytime he msg me.. even if its juz asking me sth, like today for example, i would be sad to delete his msg. he has absolutely no idea how much i miss him. asso.  yay! on a lighter note, tml im watching harry potter! with froggy. but aiyah.. read iona's blog, she said that it didnt explain everything. but then again its hard to compress like 400 pages into one movie. of course some parts have to be foregone. opportunity cost. right? blahh harry potter!!! ooohhhhh.. (^.^)v

       oh gosh..   its been what.. AGES since i last blogged. in my personal blog i mean. looking back my previous blogs.. i think ive really really grown up. matured mentally i mean. im like.. oh my gosh.. damn childish. yeah.. tt's the word to use. some things worth mentioning..     My health   Im fine now. though having headaches everyday for the past few weeks. its worrying man. and i fall sick easily. if its not fever, it will be backaches, or flu. damn! what does this tell u? that jc life is damn stressful. bleah.. but its better than having bacterial fever eh.. bless me.   My class  I still miss A1 & Sherry.. but somehow, after the june hols, ive kept tt feeling to the minimum. its like my body wants me to concentrate on my present class, and my mind.. i dunno.. subconsciously did tt? haha.. sounds silly.. but yeah, tt's what i mean. and ive grown to love and understand my classmates better. But its damn frustrating.. the more you understand them.. the more you feel.. argh.  Why are they like that? shall not think much. just hoping everyone would change. I think I think too much.   My er..crush on him  Okie... its official. i don't like him anymore. i know.. im fickle minded. im being an ass.. but then again.. i already know im like that. and i cant control my feelings. someone shoot me please. hmm.. shall not say much. just hope my present feelings for the other him* will fade away soon. and i mean REAL SOON. i cant tahan anymore..   My family  I love my family. didnt talk much to him. i think on the average.. i speak to him ONCE per week. afraid the real statistics is worse off then this.. younger bro is growing up.. that asso.. friend called him to go play bball he dont want.. and tt friend called three times loh.. waste of $$.. tsk.   My Life  After sorting out my incredibly childish thoughts.. life has been pretty cool. except for my contradicting feelings for him.. Im putting effort into my studies. at least im trying to learn. making an effort to do so. and i really really need to STUDY. correction. REVISE. I never like the word study. so pressurising~! i gotta admit.. my only worry is him. besides him.. i think i dont have anything to worry about. the london/paris trip is kinda confirmed. i mean im going. parents are being great and cool about it. and the thailand trip too. cool~! abt the china ocip.. i gotta think abt it. mother said i cant go all three. i mean i know.. we are going on a trip on our own at the end of the year too. cant afford to go so many places. i know.. im sensible  k ... i just packed my shelves.. threw away most of the worksheets. but kept the lit exam papers. haha.. a reminder of why i need to pull up my grades. i need to score well for the coming common tests. correction. i  want  to score well. :) better. hmm.. playing Unwell now.. i think im like that. the person in the song i mean. sometimes i think i think too much. i need to act like myself. i need to  be  myself. i dont wanna act like someone else when he's around. but its dificult. argh.. sucky. why do i have to be like that? bleah. i hate myself. ahhhhh
