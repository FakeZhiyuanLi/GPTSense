           UNDERSIZED T-SHIRTS      &nbsp;   Going to SF Annual Gathering also means getting exclusive t-shirts for free. Scholars have even been receiving school bag starting last year. Anyway, we're supposed to wear the t-shirts for several programmes, i.e. team games and gala dinner on day 2, and social trip on day 3. For male scholars (and female scholars who don't wear head scarf),&nbsp;it means lighter luggage on the way to the venue.  Pas moi . Since none of the t-shirts&nbsp;were long-sleeves, I still had to bring long-sleeve shirts to be worn underneath the SF t-shirts (*sigh).     &nbsp;   I don't mean to show lack of appreciation for the t-shirts. They are&nbsp;of good fabrics and neutral colors. But those t-shirts never fit me perfectly. Last year they were oversized. This year it was the opposite. And I wish we'd get long-sleeve t-shirts, at least for the outdoor activity. That way I could still use the t-shirt even after the annual gathering was over. Last year I gave away several of the t-shirts to some (male) relations because they (it's the t-shirts&nbsp;I'm talking about, of course) would be of little use for me. Where else would I wear them if not inside the house? This year I've been meaning to give away t-shirts again, but they are the kind of t-shirts that fit only for women.  Kaos adik , you know. Well, I guess I'd give them to my family's housekeeper. Lucky you, Mbak Sarminah. &nbsp;  &nbsp;     HAUNTING HYMN       &nbsp;   Three days have passed since I got home from Annual Gathering, but I could still hear clearly SF's theme song "Spread Our Wings" buzzing in my ears over and over again. Thanks to SF crew who had played the song repeatedly during Annual Gathering, now I could barely think of another song to hum when I'm doing my works. "SF's trying to brainwash us," my fellow scholars said. Yeah,&nbsp;a successful one.     &nbsp;   It's not a bad idea actually to sing it over and over again, since the lyrics are inspiring. The song is hard to catch the first time we hear it. But once you&nbsp;get good grasp of&nbsp;it, it'll stick to your head and won't wear off. It creeps into your soul and it haaauuuunnnttsss you, hahahahaha (*  udah gila, hehehe  )! Go check the words below and you'll understand what I've been raving about. Enjoy.     &nbsp;      Spread Our Wings  &nbsp;      (Sampoerna Foundation Theme)        &nbsp;        I can dream the impossible      I fear not the obstacles    For if I believe in me    I can make it possible     &nbsp;   I'll shine my light for all to see    For a gem can't be polished without friction    Nor a man perfected without trials     &nbsp;   We all take different paths in life    But no matter where I go    I will feel safe knowing that    We're all together in this journey     &nbsp;   For we are one big family    There'll always be time for sharing    and caring for each other    even when we are far apart     &nbsp;    Chorus:     Like an eagle we spread our wings    Soaring high in the sky of dreams    Always strive to be the very best    And help others to soar as high     &nbsp;   We remember the start    We will go through the journey    We will reach the goals    Let's lend&nbsp;our hands to our brothers and sisters    Let's make a brighter tomorrow for others    Make their impossible dreams possible    For when we believe, when we are together    We can make a difference

              ANNUAL&nbsp;GATHERING  &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Hi!  Been wondering where I've been for the past 2 weeks? Hm, busy, busy, busy! First, I got my thesis to work on. Next, I had to prepare myself for several activities held by   urlLink  Sampoerna Foundation   &nbsp;(SF), one of which was the 3rd Sampoerna Foundation Annual Gathering 2004.  &nbsp;  Each year, SF invites its scholars and alumni from all over Indonesia and abroad to a special gathering. It's special, because it's no easy job contacting almost 200 persons and gathering them in one place. On the part of the scholars and alumni, the event is a special one because it's the only time that we can really get to know scholars/alumni from other regions (to meet them in person, more precisely). Moreover, it's time for fun (I hate to mention that it is also time for lectures of social responsibility, team and leadership, blabla),&nbsp;because we chance to play team games during the three-day event. Winning is not important since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;togetherness, the laughter and all the fun&nbsp;we can find that matter most.  &nbsp;  This year, the Annual Gathering was held in Prambanan camping complex, on 23-25 July. Yup, it's the Prambanan temple I'm talking about. One thing for sure, this year's Annual Gathering is a whole lot different from last years'&nbsp;because this year we slept in&nbsp;a ... tent. Well, not exactly a tent. It was a complex of small houses made of bamboo, which were called 'omah'. We cannot exactly call them 'houses' because I could barely stand straight in that 'omah'. Plus, we used sleeping bags in exchange for beds. I don't mean to complain or anything, but for a person who has been to the previous annual gatherings, in which we stayed in cottages (Anyer, 2002) and hotel rooms (Lido Lakes, 2003), I might as well call the Annual Gathering 2004 'modest'.  &nbsp;  The good thing was that food and beverages were lavish. Imagine, two coffee breaks a day, plus one more during the night, and of course, breakfast-lunch-dinner were served. We ate not one kind of  lauk , but three! Another good thing was I had a good time laughing almost to tears there. My fellow scholars and alumni were extremely, hilariously funny. Well, I think we were all ready to have a good time that nobody put on groovy face and everyone was ever ready to please others. A pal who is known as a complaint maker seemed to enjoy the time spent there (I could judge by the zero complaint the person made,&nbsp;as far as I knew, and the happy face that lingered on the person's face up to the last day of the event). Here's a scholar's testimonial of the event, as a prove:&nbsp;     Wuaahhhhh...... akhirnya sampe lagi Jakarta..... tp tau ngak seh..(baca: gaya ABG..hehe..) pas masuk kamar kost2-an perasaan kayanya ada yang ilang... rame2... ngumpul bareng temen2 baru... omah... sleeping bag... makanan yg siap sedia.. plus Enuaaakkk banget.... makan tinggal makan... minum tinggal minum.... semuanya itu udah ngak ada lagi..... yang ada VCD warna merah.. langsung aja di puter.. dan hey.... perasaan itu baru aja.. emang bener itu baru aja terjadi..... hebatttt.... ngak nyangka dapet pelayanan yg gitu profesional banget dari SF ama Rakata, DSA.... secara pribadi saya merasa bangga dan seneng banget bisa kumpul di AG kemarin.... semuanya saya alamin bener2 asik.... workshopnya bagus buat ngasah "kapak" saya biar bisa nebang pohon lebih banyak lagi.....   One thing that got in my way during the three-day fun: My sore cough that hasn't ended although it's been two weeks already...

       urlLink    Dawson Creek's back on TV! Satu hal yang gue seneng dari Dawson Creek (DC) adalah serial ini bercerita tentang beragam  wisdom  kehidupan. Nggak semua pesan yang disampein di DC gue suka sih, karena ada aja yang nggak sesuai dengan nilai-nilai yang gue pegang. Nggak heran lah, karena itu film buatan Amrik. Tapi ada juga nilai-nilai  wisdom  yang buat gue mengena banget.  Seperti DC seri Rabu ini. Salah satu bagian film nyeritain tentang Pacey yang baru aja dapet pekerjaan di resto. Padahal dia mati-matian bilang ke semua orang kalau dia itu mestinya kerja di atas kapal/ yacht . Tapi tuntutan perut bikin Pacey yang lagi gak berlayar harus segera dapat pekerjaan. Untungnya kakaknya datang dan nyuruh dia ke resto tempat temennya kerja.  Meskipun awalnya nolak, akhirnya Pacey mau juga kerja di resto. Itu juga dia  ngeyel  dulu gak mau kerja jadi pencuci piring dan cuma mau jadi tukang potong ikan, seperti salah satu kerjaannya kalau lagi berlayar. Pas dia mau pulang dari resto itu, dia sempetin diri ngobrol-ngobrol sama salah satu kru resto, sambil menatap matahari terbenam nun di ufuk barat sana (di film ketauan banget kalau  sunset nya itu tempelan dari, tauk deh, Animal Planet kali).  "Sebulan yang lalu, gue lagi ngeliatin  sunset  kayak gini di Karibia. Sekarang gue di sini," Pacey ngeluh ke temen kerjanya yang baru. Ketahuan banget dia masih kurang sreg kerja di resto (baca: di daratan).  "Elo mesti belajar menyukai tempat ini, Pak, karena   in the end, what matters most is who you're with, not where you are  ," si cewe teman barunya Pacey tadi nyahut.  Das! Dalem banget omongan tuh cewek! Dan itu emang yang selama ini gue yakini. Gue selalu suka  hang out with my friends, spending time with them . Gak peduli mau jalan ke mana, asal jalannya bareng temen, gue akan sangat enjoy acara jalan-jalan itu.  You might think this one's silly , tapi gue pernah ama temen-temen kuliah S1 gue jalan-jalan ke ...    urlLink     Bunderan HI!    Yap! Yang lebih konyol lagi, kita foto-foto di sana kayak turis kesasar, hehehe. Dari pengalaman inilah, gue makin yakin bahwa gak peduli kita berada di mana, asal kita ada di sana dengan teman kita atau orang yang kita sayangi, itu udah cukup.  Tapi yah, gak semua orang berpendapat sama. Ada satu ex-temen kantor gue yang cerita, waktu dia  traveling  ke Eropa sama cewenya, dia cuma mau foto-foto di tempat-tempat yang bagus, misalnya monumen, gedung, atau patung. 'Ck, sayang banget,' gue langsung mikir gitu. Kalau gue jadi dia, gue akan cuek aja foto-foto di tempat manapun yang kita singgahi, mau itu cuma sebuah halte bis atau resto, kek. Yang penting kan momen gue ama temen gue ada bersama di tempat itu yang perlu diabadikan, bukan tempat yang jadi latar belakangnya,  because what matters most is who you're with, not where you are .

       urlLink     Kalo lagi nyetir di jalan, empat hal yang paling gue benci adalah: 1. sepeda motor 2. sepeda motor 3. bis/bajaj 4. bajaj/bis  Biasanya orang paling benci ama bajaj karena "hanya Tuhan dan supir bajaj yang tahu ke mana berikutnya bajaj itu mengarah", gitu kata banyak orang.  Not me . Di jalan yang sering gue lalui, bajaj bisa dibilang gak ada. Yang ada tuh sepeda motor, sepeda motor, sepeda motor, baru abis itu bis, bis, bis.  The problem with motor cycles  adalah kemampuan kendaraan beroda dua itu nyelip-nyelip di antara barisan kendaraan roda empat.  I truly despise motor cycles because it seems to me all motor cyclists assume that the road belongs to them and them only, that other vehicles besides motorcycle simply do not exist!  Hhh!!! Tapi gue gak sampe menerapkan salah satu teori dalam Murphy's Law sih, yang bilang, " You never really really learn how to swear until you learn how to drive ". Paling tampang gue aja yang keliatan betenya, hehehe.  Sebenernya, pas pertama-tama gue (mulai bisa) nyetir, gue masih berbaik hati berpikir kalo para pengendara sepeda motor itu just  as civilized as car drivers . Jadi kalo mau ambil jalan ya lihat apa di belakangnya ada mobil atau kendaraan lain, nggak sembarang  selonong boy/girl  gitu. Waa, sangkaan gue salah! Malah gue dikasitau kalo orang-orang yang naik motor ya selalu berpikiran bahwa pengendara mobil akan ngalah sama mereka.  Yikes!  Alhasil, gue sering 'notol' motor, hehehe. Ada pengendara motor yang melotot ngeliatin gue, sementara gue dengan cueknya cuma melambai-lambaikan tangan nyuruh dia maju. Ada juga yang nggak memperpanjang masalah dan langsung jalan - mungkin takut dia yang disalahin. Yah, gitulah perang gue dengan sepeda motor. Korbannya? Adik gue dong, karena mobilnya gue pake untuk  extreme action , hehehe :P  Note: Blabla tentang teori Murphy's Law diambil dari novel "Cintapuccino" karya Icha Rahmanti (a novel that will soon be a hot gossip topic, I dare say).

       urlLink   &nbsp;  P as baca komik " Parfait Tic! " part 2-nya Nagamu Nanaji, gue 'kesenggol' 1 kalimat yang diucapin tokoh Daiya dalam komik itu: "  Jangan samakan, dong, kebaikan hati dengan hanya sekedar bersikap baik  ". Selintas sih dua istilah itu ga ada bedanya, ya gak? Tapi setelah gue pikir-pikir, wah, emang beda ya.    Say , pas elo lagi  feeling good , ga ada beban, elo bisa enteng aja kasih duduk ama orang lain di bis yg penuh sesek. Tapi coba kalo elo lagi beteeeee dan capekkkk berats, terus elo harus nunggu bis di bawah sengatan matahari. Pas dapet bis, bisnya udah kayak tas gue yang segala macam barang masuk. Tapi untunglah gak berapa lama ada orang yang mau turun dan dia udah ngasih sinyal ke elo untuk ambil tempat duduk dia begitu dia berdiri.  Phew!  Akhirnya,  luck is coming your way!  Tapi...  what the ...!!!  Ibu-ibu yang berdiri agak di belakang tau-tau nyerobot dan ngambil kursi yang mestinya bakal jadi kursi yang bakal elo dudukin!!  Talking about wanting to scream at the top of your sore lung at that exact very moment!  :P   Jadi apa yang sebenernya mau gue omongin ya? Hehehe. Maksud gue, dari ilustrasi di atas, antara "bersikap baik" dan "baik hati" jadi kelihatan bedanya. Orang yang "baik hati" akan bersikap sama meski hujan melanda, badai menerpa, gempa mengguncang, gunung meletus, dan ... nasib terburuk dari yang terburuk menimpa dia. "Bersikap baik" adalah perilaku ( behavior ); "baik hati" adalah  attitude . Dan  attitude definitely lasts longer than behavior .  Mark my words ...

                I'M FLYING! I'M FLYING!    It was on the second day of the AG and we were just dismissed from the last activity we had that afternoon so we could get ourselves ready for the gala dinner, a special event which the Sultan himself chanced to come (and I was busily taking pictures of my friends instead of listening to his speech, hehehehe). Suddenly  urlLink Fitri , my college buddy, tapped my shoulder and said: â Ke jembatan situ yuk, kayaknya seru deh di sana .â I glanced toward the bridge and tried to see what was going on there. But I couldnât get a clearer view until I reached some kind of a valley near the bridge. There I could see around six fellow scholars â all except one were men - and trainers staring at a person standing on this roofless tree house set up on a tall tree across the river. The guyâs all wired and buckled up, his hands hanging onto a pair of ropes, ready to lurch and glide all the way across the river to the place where the devoted crowd had awaited for him to jump into action.     urlLink    There, he finally made his move. Swoossshâ¦ Itâs a bird! Itâs a plane! Itâs a â¦ scholar trying out an outdoor game called the  Flying Fox *. Like a Superman he flew his way straight to where we were standing. âArrhhhh!!!â An expression of excitement, and a bit of fear blasting out of his mouth. Hm, it seemed fun. Soon all the scholars there, including Fitri, begged for turns to try out the game. But I wasnât moved and challenged to try it, considering the eagerly-waiting-long line and the time that was approaching night time. I was thinking of the natural view around the game area and wondering whether there was a good place to take one or two pictures of the surrounding. I did so because hey, I was taking my camera and during AG it never went far away from my grip. Yeah, itâs just an automatic camera, but the sense of beauty inside of me was hungry for beautiful and interesting scenes to be captured.  So, after watching for some people taking turns for the Flying Fox, I decided to walk to the bridge and saw whether the view from there was a good one. The bridge was a cable one, so when one walked over it, it would sway a bit. It turned out the view there was neither as good as where I had been. I stayed there a bit longer though, watching my friends fight their way crossing the bridge and climbing the tree and then âflyingâ to the landing spot. Not all lurched well. Some âflewâ with their feet facing the different direction, not straight as they were supposed to be. But the scream remained the same: They all show the thrill and exhilaration, also a faint fear here and there, hehehe.  After a while, I got tired standing on the bridge by myself without the company of any single scholar. So, I decided to get back to the landing spot. As I walked my way there, a photographer (he was one of the photographers hired by SF to take pictures during AG) who had been standing on the other part of the bridge all the time, dropped a line: â Nggak mau nyobain? Mumpung gratis lho. Kalau di Bali kayak ginian mesti bayar .â  Bang! I believe the word âgratisâ paced my nerve all of a sudden :) When I got to the landing spot, I had partly made up my mind to try the game. But the line was already a long one. The sun was slowly hiding its ray and I still had to wait for two more people before my turn. It felt sooo long. Finally, when Fitri was up on the tree house, a scholar was âflyingâ her way to the landing spot. That meant my turn had come.  As soon as the fellow scholar landed and released all the equipments from her body, I prepared myself to wear those equipments. They consist of a strap of belt which spanned from your joints to your shoulders. We wear them like we wear a jumpsuit, only itâs not a suit; itâs only a kind of belt. Then, we wear a helmet (to protect your head, of course) and a pair of hand gloves (to keep your sweaty hands from slipping off the ropes). But I was a bit nervous at the time that I forgot to have my gloves with me. After I put on the strap of belt and the helmet, I dashed off to the tree. However I think another reason I forgot them was because the trainers had urged everyone to hurry as twilight was about five minutes away.  Actually there was one thing I hadnât told. When one by one people were lurching and landing and my turn was coming near, I actually had a moment at which my heart was pounding fast. Darn! âI canât step back. No, not me,â I said to myself. To ease my nerve, I made myself to think that when my time to die had come, so let it come. Pretty scarry things to think of, huh? But that was the only way for me to overcome my fear. I say, to have courage in our heart, we must let go all feelings and wants, including the wants to live, and surrender ourselves totally to Allahâs will.  It worked although not instantly. I forgot my gloves, thatâs a prove. But there was no doubt in every running steps I took toward the tree and every pulls of rope I groped to reach the tree house (My friends were right; It was a tallll tree). There was no single moment of hesitating. âThis is it, no stepping backâ was what I said to myself. Yeah, the talks that the two trainers made while waiting for the maghrib call to finish did a big help, yet the most important motivator came from within myself. As a result, when time came for me to lurch, I held tighter to the ropes, whispered goodbye to life deep down inside my heart in case it was my last time on earth, counting one, two, and bismillah â¦  urlLink    Iâm flying! Iâm flying!   *The game is named after a kind of bat species because the way our hands spread when we lurch is similar to the way bats spread their wings when flying.       Pictures shown are courtesies from other websites, due to the absence of pictures taken during the event :D
