      My mom came home from the nut house yesterday. IT was her medicine giving her insomnia. I feel like I can't do anything right. I mean, if I shat gold my grandma would still find a way to criticize the way I was doing it.

      Today I slept until about 2 pm. Then I woke up and did nothing. Then I got on the computer and did stuff. I'm now getting bitched at for various things. SIIIIIIIIIIGH

      It's official, my life is now a music video. And what is the song.. you might ask? It's "Goodbye to You" (Michelle Branch.) I. Feel. Like. A. Fool... I mean HELLO, when you ask someone to MARRY you, you don't bring your girlfriend to where you KNOW she can see you two together the VERY NEXT WEEKEND! And what is his excuse... he has money and a boat and a house tied up with her. I can understand him not wanting to piss her off by just all of the sudden breaking up with her, because he would lose a lot of money. But he doesn't have to parade around down here with her.  Ok, so the question is, do I still want to marry him? Of course I do, I love him.. but I'm not going to marry him because he has no respect for me and I don't trust him. And I dreamt that if we continued our relationship like it is now, something bad will happen.... something worse than what has already happened. Last time I ignored my dream, and it happened, I don't plan on ignoring it again. I wonder if he thinks I'm stupid. He's right, I am stupid in a way. Love may cover my "eyes" but it doesn't completely blind me. I can see I am being played, but what he doesn't know is that the cards will fall my way in the end. There is so many things I can do to hurt him, but I don't want to hurt him. But, if he continues to do what he's doing, someone has to teach him. He's not just playing me either, he's playing his current girlfriend. If she doesn't see it, she's a fool. He won't have his cake and eat it too.. that he can be sure of though.   Ok, enough of that kind of talk. I guess I will talk about my day. I had my 2 year old brother yesterday and today (JC). I called my dad to come and get him though! My mother is in a mental hospital (ack), the doctor thinks she's having a nervous breakdown. Actually, I've known she's crazy all along. She would have to be crazy to have an affair like she did, with that ugly piece of shit. Then, she told Shelby (my sister) our father wasn't her father. I'll never forgive her for that, Shelby is too young to have to deal with a secret like that. If my dad found out I don't know what he would do.       I wonder if things will ever be the way the were before last summer. I was happy, really happy. Then came July and I ruined it all, though I didn't know it at the time. Then came October and I figured it out. It's funny how you can totally screw your life up and not even realize you're doing it... and you'll be screwing other people's lives up in the process. The end of school is near, so Shelby can come stay with me. I can't believe she has a boyfriend that's a senior, I just hope she doesn't make the mistakes I've made. Oh yeah, and Teri can stay with me! I haven't seen her since the summer. I will never forget that weekend lol. I got her so drunk then she puked everywhere. She was in the bathroom floor crying and puking. That was some fun. LOL.. then the time Shaylon and I were down here and we were pouring glasses of water on us to try to be 'sexy'. What a bunch of idiots we were. Then there was the Karaoke weekend where a very drunk Louis came and sang a song and thought he sang better than us. It was hilarious, priceless actually. I miss singing... I really do. I need to find some people to form a band with. I miss Shaylon, if only she hadn't turned into a pot headed 'gangsta' wannabe. I miss Christi aswell, but my family hates her.   I guess since I've ruined what I had with Ricky by telling him about the 'engagement' and am planning on ending the relationship with Steve, I am single. I hope I stay that way for a while, but I never know what or who will come into my life.  So.. that's all for now.
