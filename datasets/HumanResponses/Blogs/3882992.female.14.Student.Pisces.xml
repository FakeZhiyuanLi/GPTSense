      Love-->I hate It  Why do I fall for it everything? Why do I seem to care? Why do I seem to lose my mind? Now love's an empty chair.  Once I heard all the lies, I seemed to be complete. I'm sick and tired of cries, I'm sick and tired of defeat.  I refuse to fall in love now, And now I refuse to cry. I refuse to think of somway, somehow I could believe in you lies.  Never again will I get my hopes high, Never again will I wait. Love used to be the only thing that mattered, Now it's the only thing I hate.

        I reallly am an idiot.        &nbsp;   When I say I love soembody like on the second day after I know then what I actually am in love with. I am in love with the idea of love. I fall in love with the idea of lying down and having somebody to think about and have them also think about you. I fall in love with the idea of always having somebody there for you to hold and to kiss and to love you forever. But it's not love--it's the idea of it--that's why I fall so fast. I find myself very mental. I fall in love with the idea of love--I say things&nbsp;I don't even mean--I lose all the time and then it comes back again to bite me in the ass. I dont even know why I bother anymore. So I guess from this day forward I am promissing myself never to get hurt again, to protect my heart and to not let myslef fall in love or in love with the idea or whatever you want to call it. The reason is because even though I am slowly trying to recover from the death of a guy that I honestly did love with every ounce of my heart and soul---I don't want to feel like that again. With him it was different. I was never in love with the idea of love with him. I was in love with him. His eyes, his heart, his mind. Everything that he did I loved, because I loved him. I never want to feel like this ever again (even though I feel like this 24/7). I try to act happy--and from the way&nbsp;I act you could never even tell. But whenever I am alone or I drift away from the world for a few seconds--tears form in my eyes--and in my heart.      Recently when I drifted away for a few seconds tears formed up. My friend kept asking&nbsp;me what was wrong but I just ignored it and told him that I got a mosquito in my eye. It happens to me all the time-the fact that I cannot accept to move on with my life and leave old things&nbsp;in the past. But&nbsp;for me the past makes my future. And without him there is no future for me. Death to me is a really funny thing. Because it makes you realize the small things around you. Like now for me--no more drumming sessions with him-no more sleepovers--no more talks--no nothing....     Death makes you realize deep thigns too--like what you lost and what to make of yourself and how the hell do you recooperate form this feeling. For me I was never a fast healer. Hell I am still trying to recover from my grandparents dying (that was in november) now I get dumped on with this??? What the fuck? Why does life or god or whatever life force there is out there, always pick on me? Why Lindsay? Why Ryan? Why the girl next door?       &nbsp;   I swear if it were'nt for a talk I had with a friend one night (while watchin a really cool movie) I swear I would not be here writing this right now. So I will protect my heart--and save myself the trouble of nver falling in love again.Ever.....       &nbsp;

      &nbsp;I'm flirting with suicide right now-there is no real reason for me to live anymore. I have nothing really left to live for. I stayed up till five&nbsp;in the morning with my friend trying to figure it out and&nbsp;I can't -There is no happy ending for me and the fairytale for me has turned in to&nbsp; a horror movie. &nbsp; I can't get over small things. People keep telling me that the small things don't count but when I add them all up I see what nobody else can see. I see a giant problem and the problem for me at the moment is living. I'm not trying to figure out the meaning of life--I'm trying to figure out the meaning of MY life. Also for some reason everytime I try to put the pieces back togeather it always falls apart a billion times worse again. It makes me frustrated and I tend to give up---all the time and I want to give up again-this time for good. &nbsp; Maybe I just want to get away from the love I get that always seems to shatter or maybe I want to get away from all the people I know and all the things I do. I mean what's the point of living if everybody I love dies or leaves me. Love hurts, people die, friendships crumble, people move away, fights. Nothing seems to matter to me anymore. I don't care. I honestly feel like I have no reason to put myself through all this pain-I have too much of it to handle. I'm not a very open person either-i don't like it when people know how&nbsp;I fell about myself or about others-because I always get hurt in the end. There is honestly no reason to go on. Who do I have to live for? Nobody.Nothing. Nobody because all the people I have ever loved has left me or killed themselves or died. &nbsp; Sure, people are going to try to tell me what I have to live for but I have finally figured what I have left to live for-nothing. Nothing because there is nothing out there for me. Nothing can help me or make me stop feeling emptiness. You could be in a room with 50 other people and still be alone. It's the most horrible feeling in the world. So now I refuse to stop loving-living and putting myself through a whole new world pain and suffering. I'm sick and tired of it all. I'm sick and tired of living this life and getting hurt. I'm sick and tired of loving somebody so much I would die for them and have them leave me. I'm sick and tired of fights and friendships I can't rebuild. I'm just sick and tired of living. So now for me...there's no reason.......and no hope. &nbsp;

          I don't know why I ever didn't believe in love in the first place. What I mean is that I always had a hard time trusting the person I was with. Never really understood why either--maybe too afraid or maybe like I just wanted to deny the fact of getting my heart broken--again.  My friend dies, my family and my whole love life shattered on me--so I never really thought that love existed--was just a word or a commitment. A word that you just never really knew the meaning too, but somehow you knew what it meant to you when you said it, and how much it mattered even more when somebody else said it to you.  I never really thought I could ever love somebody this much that it hurt. It sounds kind of weird cause I always used to see love as a good movie that had a weird twisted ending. Then I guess I met him and I guess I thought maybe I made a new friend--afraid that I would hurt him I tried to avoid him--cause I was at a stage where I thought anybody that came near me would leave me for good ( like tyson who is gone forever--save a place for me up there--ill miss you). So I kind of denied the fact that I really liked this person ( in an intimate way).   Then I guess out of nowhere he kind of just decided to really be there, no matter what I thought (not that I ever told him) he would still stick around through hell or high water. And at first it was weird for me to have somebody caring for me--especially when I was crying.  I thought love was never fair to me. Always stabbing me in the back when I really needed it or being there when I didn't need it. I guess for some reason I look at this person in a different way than  I did to all the others. For some reason I fall in love all over again and  I feel like an idiot for doing it too. I guess that I fell all over again. And it makes me go insane.  So I guess I am guilty for not letting people in when I needed then Guilty for not being there for other cause I was too stuck in my own little fucked up world. And guilty for falling in love.. all over again

          I hate to feel used and I hate to feel down. Tonight I felt both. When I attended the so called "perfect place" I saw "him" again and it broke me down. For some reason I can't except the fact that he is gone and that I have to move on with my life. I broke down tonight. While all those "perfect people" watched me express my darkest moment.  Luckily somebody actually understood. Somebody not to stuck up to help out a friend somebody actually cared for once and I never had to give anything  in return for the favor (but I do owe that person).If it wasn't for that person I probably would still be there, in my little world with my head up in the clouds to messed up to realize that somebody actually cares. That person made me realize that no matter what I will always have him and other people. As corny as this sounds it's true.  So thank you so much for helping me out. I owe you big time and I love you lots though I rejected your attempts to make me happy the first few times you didn't give up. So thank you again.

         Seems like the perfect place. A place where you're bored and you can hang out. Nice people your age. Cool new people. I was way too blind to see what it really was.  I got involved with the people that go there. Them becoming some of the most trustworthy people I have ever met. Him for example. Seemed like the perfect friend. Always there for me, whenever I would cry he would be there and he was always there, having my back, defending me. When my family started to die he was always there to help me cope. Then i just don't know what happened he like dissapeared in to his own little world. A world where  i mattered no more and where he would look down on me like the piece of shit that i once thought that i was, before he came along. Now my life is so much different. I so want to escape the "perfect place" the drinking, drugs everything. Not saying that i take drugs anymore.. The only thing  i do these days is smoke. I can't help thinking that one day everyone will want to do something else. Can't help thinking that one day the "perfect place" will actually be perfect. Where  i won't get involved with things that i don't want to do. I won't even have to deal with the pressure of being somebody that I'm not. I like the way I a right now. And  i really like the trustworthy people I described in the beginning.   Now I guess I just have to search for that "perfect place"

          Emptyness  Just a little speck of dust, Lost inside a world of lust, So invisible you can't see, Love shatters when it's near me.  It never shows, Until the pain explodes. So much to live for, So much to die for.  Underneath it all, Is a heart that is so small Inside my soul, Is an unrepairable hole.

       I never in my whole entire life really ever had a best friend. Nobody I was willing to open up to enough, and when I did, I always (without fail) got hurt.      I hate getting hurt because I always think that it's my fault. Maybe sometimes it is, but I put most of it on myself. I can't go through each day knowing that I hurt people or worse, that they hurt me. I hate the feeling of having nobody to really "belong" to out there. Not saying that I want to be loved that much, but I do really like to be considered as a good friend sometimes.       I never really actually tried to be somebody lovable. I'm not an easy person to love in the first place. I'm selfish and I am a real idiot most of the times. I have an ongoing pain for some reason most of the time too. Why can't I be a happy-go-lucky kind of person. I'd love to wake up one day and have some kind of meaning to my life. I hope that one day I'll finally wake up.   Wake up to some kind of light.   Some kind of shadow that will lead me to hope or faith or meaning.   I hope some day soon because I can't stand this nightmare.

      I guess I might be a little over dramatic about soem aspects of my life. But things always go wrong for me I guess. I mean my best friend in the whole world, Ryan, won't talk to me anymore. We're not even friends because of my stupid phobia of loving him so much (as a friend) the he would die away with everything else. I am really afraid to love people because I'm afraid that they will leave me or hurt me or worst of all--I'll hurt them. I just wish I could have never made it happen. I really regret what I said and I totally wish that I could completely restart. I don't want to fight anymore.I miss him too. I hate seeing him and not be able to laugh and talk to him.I guess I fucked up big time this time.I hope that we do become friends again-but that won't probably happen for a logn time 'cause he's probably majorly pissed at me at the moment. I guess I'm going to have to deal with losing a really good friend. Even thoguh it hurts I hope that I can get through this one.But if I could wish for anything in the world--I wish that I never said anything because I fucked up something great.
