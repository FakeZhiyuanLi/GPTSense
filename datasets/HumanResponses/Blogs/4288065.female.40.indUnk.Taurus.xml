      Howdy Ya’ll,   It’s me again. I been sittin’ here on my porch lookin’ at all the sale papers that came in the mail. It’s time fer the young’uns to git back in school, so they got all the school stuff on sale. I never will understand what differnce a certain kind of notebook is gonna make in the way a young’un learns. I seen wired notebooks, zippered notebooks, colorful notebooks, plain notebooks, ones with movie stars pictures on ‘em, ones with cartoons on’em, and ones with ever color of the rainbow on ‘em! They got regler pencils and fancy pencils, regler pens and colered pens and pens with special grips. Crayons now come in big boxes of 96 differnt colors, and paper is in ever color you could want to write on. They even got special stores that sell nothin’ but school stuff!  They got them backpack things fer the young’uns to lug all this mess back and to in. The TV said the other day that doctors is worried about the young’uns back messin’ up before they even get out of school to get a job! They just ain’t no sense in any young’un totin’ that much on their back! We didn’t have to tote that much when we worked in the fields ‘till we got older and big enough to handle it.  Can anybody out there prove to me that all this new fangled stuff is teachin’ the young’uns any better? Most young’uns now ain’t got sense enough to get out of the rain unless some game tells ‘em to! The young’uns that make it to college are taking so long to graduate that they done got gray hair before they know what a job is! And when they do git a job, guess where they go first? To the store that sells all the school stuff so they can git fancy stuff fer their new jobs! ‘Cept now, they’re called “office” supplies! Don’t make no sense to me, neither.  Since we done got all the supplies, are the teachers any better? I wonder. I see on them school calendars that they schedule teacher work days. These are days that the young’uns could be in school, but today’s teachers need the time to fix up report cards. I figered it shouldn’t take ‘em as long today ‘cause they got them computers to do all the work. In my day, the teachers had to do the figurin’ themselves, and the writin’ themselves, and there weren’t no such thing as settin’ up an appointment to see your young’uns teacher. If you needed to see her, you just stopped by the school when you had a minute. Boy, if you try that now, they’d have you hauled off! Yet all the time you hear the teachers whinin’ about they cain’t get the mamas and daddies involved in their young’uns schoolin’! They need to learn that you cain’t have it both ways. Either you want me there, or you don’t. They need to learn that time is important to mama’s and daddies, too. Some mama’s got jobs, and those that don’t got meals to cook, homes to clean, and probably got clothes to fold! Most daddies got jobs, too. They have to take off to go see the teacher. The least they can do is work with the man!  They need to learn that supplies don’t teach the young’uns, good teachers do. What is wrong with the good, old fashioned ways of readin’, writin’, and arithmetic, as long as you throw in some of that computer stuff so the young’uns don’t fall behind the rest of the world? Now a days, they’re teachin’ girls how to be welders and boys how to cook. They got health and safety classes, babysittin’ classes, and picture takin’ classes. If the mama’s would teach the cookin’, and daddies would teach the weldin’, and we all raised our young’uns with a little common sense, and left the picture takin’ as a hobby, they might find they could teach something that mattered.  Today’s young’uns ain’t as dumb as most of ya’ll think. They got plenty of brains to learn with. It’s just that what are we teachin’ ‘em? I was told one time to keep an open mind by some of the young’uns that I run up with. The only problem is that if your mind is always open, there ain’t no tellin’ who is goin’ to dump what in there!   ‘Till next time, Gran’ma Gertie

      Howdy Ya’ll!   Welcome to the world of Gran’ma Gertie! I reckon I aught to interduce myself. I was borned Gertrude Maybell Smith somwheres around a hunderd years ago. I been married to the same old geezer fer what seems like forever. I got more gran’young’uns than a pear trees got blooms in springtime. I got my share of wrinkles, and my hair’s been gray fer so long that I done fergot what color it used to be. I’ve always been a big ol’ strong gal. My daddy used to say it was ‘cause I come from good stock. I was born and bred in the country, and never took a shine to the city. Except for my ol’ man. He was a city boy all the way, and thru and thru ‘till I got hold of ‘im! Had to teach him everything he knows. Now that you know a little bit about me, I reckon we can discuss a few things, you know, chew the fat a bit.  I reckon at my age, I’ll never git used to all the new things this world keeps comin’ up with. Some of my gran’young’uns just spent around $300.00 dollars fer me a miker-wave. They said it would cook real fast. I just ain’t figered out what they think a rotatin’ light bulb is gonna cook! It does make a perty good shelf to put some of my what-nots on, though. I reckon I’d like the clock part too, if’n it did’t blink 12:00 all the time! It seems to me that the women now-a-days have just about cut off their noses to spite their faces. What with all the new fangled gadgets and thing-a-ma-jigs they got now. Take them biscuits in a can fer instance. Now that they ain’t got a use fer a rollin’pin, what do they think they’re gonna WHOP their ol’ man with if’n he needs it? Only thing I can think of is to fix them sudden biscuits in a cast iron skillet and use that to hit him with.  They got telephones that do everything but make a phone call. I, fer one, sure don’t like them answerin’ machine things. I don’t need some machine tellin’ me to leave a message, I ain’t so old I cain’t call back! They got cars you have to plug in and teli-visions that you don’t, addin’ machines that are so little you gotta have a magnifyin’ glass to use ‘em, and radios so big it takes two people to tote ‘em. They got perfume that’s s’posed to smell like real vaniller flavorin’, but they use imitation flavorin’ in their cookin’. They got take out food that s’posed to taste like homemade, and their homemade taste like it should be took out, maybe to the dawgs!  Women used to know their place. Then some gal must’a thought we ought to get smart and start makin’ us a new place. These modern women got things so messed up, I’m beginnin’ to wonder if’n we were better off where we were.  What with all the gadgets and such we got now, I don’t know whether I wish we could go back to yesterday, or whether I should just keep hangin’ on to see what the heck is next!!  ‘Till next time, Gran’ma Gertie

      Autumn Afternoon  As I sit on the front porch using the last of the day’s light to glance over the evening paper, I feel the slight chill that has crept into the air. I have spent the late afternoon watching the golden brown leaves of the sycamore tree float slowly and gracefully to the ground. The pine straw is a bit heavy on the now browning grass in my front yard. I know I shouldn’t be wasting my time just sitting on the front porch. I know I should be in the yard raking up the leaves as they fall. I just can’t bring myself to leave my perch. I, after all, have a perfect autumn view. I can sit quietly listening to the birds getting ready to nest at evening light. I can watch the squirrels preparing themselves for the fast approaching winter. I can see the pink shimmer of an autumn evening sunset. I can smell the soft fragrance of a fireplace beginning to burn. I feel the cold breath of winter beginning to creep into the fast approaching night. My toes, poking out of the sandals that I have lived in since April, are suddenly quite nippy.  I know that soon, I will wake up to a yard that has been diamond studded with the first frost. All the leaves will have finally found their final resting place in my front yard. The children will be catching the school bus in the early twilight of morning wearing new sweaters and jackets. Thanksgiving and Christmas decorations will soon be showing up, glowing brightly in windows and dancing across lawns. The sound of chainsaws whining and axes cracking will be echoing across the neighborhood announcing the golden glow of fires and the perfume of smoke to come.  I almost hate to think about removing the fallen leaves from the yard. They are a signal of the coming changes. The slow, methodical grace of the leaves falling down is as graceful as the soft, gray, billowing of smoke coming up from the chimneys. The newly grounded leaves are the signal that winter is fast approaching. They act as a reminder to get out your winter coats and blankets. They tell you to winterize the lawn mower, to break out the rakes and leaf bags, and get the yard ready for colder weather. Listen to them.  I don’t think I’ll worry about the leaves today. I may not worry about them tomorrow, either. I may just spend the early fall sitting on my front porch. Just sitting and watching as the season shows her finest colors and changes moods as quick as the fall wind blows.  Then again, I may not have to rake them. Maybe there will be a good strong wind to blow them all away into the oblivion of my next door neighbors yard. I never liked her anyway.

      Tombstone Of A Home   Where there now stands a lonesome chimney, there once was a home. The chimney is all that remains as a testimonial that once upon a time, someone cared. With loving hands, each brick was carefully lain in a mortar of mud. Even though all traces of the home have long since disappeared, the chimney still proudly stands.  How many cold mornings did this chimney serve it’s purpose? How many children were warmed by it’s hearth? How many times has it warmed both soul and bottom, faces and hearts? How many times did the children of it’s past warm their hands before going out into the cold, perhaps to school or to do their chores? How many times has a father warmed his feet and hands after working in the fields? How many clothes did the mother press with the flatirons that were heated here? How many ? How much? How many times? So many questions, so much history.  The lonesome chimney now stands as a grave marker in time. It has many memories that it could tell. It makes a person wonder if it had a mantle. If so, were the family portraits there? Maybe a bud vase of wildflowers given by a child. Think of the labor that went into the building of this chimney, and also of the building of the home and family that it warmed. It now serves as a reminder that long ago, someone’s father was young and strong enough to cut and split the wood for it’s use. That long ago, someone’s mother was young and strong enough to keep that fire burning brightly.  The outline of the home can still be seen if you look hard enough and possibly have a little imagination. If you listen long enough, you can almost hear the voices and laughter of the family that once lived here. You can see where there might have been a rope swing tied in the ancient oak that still stands in what must have been the front yard. If you are lucky enough to be here in springtime, you may see some of the mothers now wild gladiola and tulip bulbs peeking through the soil. You can imagine where the clothesline was, where the garden, chicken coop, and hog pen must have been. You can see what could have been the children’s favorite place to play, and where the mother kept watch over them. If you listen closely enough, you may even be able to hear the family dog scratching out a cool place in the sand under the porch that once stood here.  The mother and father that once lived here grew old and watched as they slowly lost everything. They were no longer young and strong enough for the old house. Life had called their children into a different way of life. Not better, not worse, just different. The children rarely visited after they grew up and moved away. Sometimes, the old couple would receive a photograph or letter from the grandchildren, but not very often. You know how busy our lives can be. The children decided that they were too old to remain in the house. Sometimes, the roof would leak and the cold breath of winter would come creeping in the cracks around the doors. After a lot of convincing, the couple was moved into a “retirement” home. It was here that they passed away. The children never returned to the old home place.  Almost like a person, a home needs love to survive. When no one cared anymore, slowly, board by board, and nail by nail, the old house lost it’s strength and gave up. No more laughter would fill it’s rooms, no more dinners in it’s kitchen, no more fires would burn. Maybe the chimney still stands in the hopes that someday, maybe a family will return. Maybe they will see how well it has stood the test of time and rebuild a new home around it. In the meantime, the lonesome chimney will continue to stand proudly, with the memories of the past. Always and always, forever hoping.

      If Only They Could Talk   I have always been what you could call a yard sale shopper. I cannot count the Saturday mornings spent with my family looking for that perfect bargain. I have furnished my home, bought gifts, clothed my entire family, met many interesting people, and saved plenty of money in the end. An estate sale, though, is an altogether different story.  For those who do not know, a yard sale is when people are cleaning out closets, re-arranging, moving, or making room for new things. They are held on lawns, porches, garages, or sometimes in living rooms when the weather is too cold or rainy. They are held in every month, with spring and summer being the best. They are held in big cities and small towns, and in neighborhoods everywhere. An estate sale, on the other hand, is often just as it says - the selling of a persons estate after death. Perhaps I have a melancholy view, but so be it.  I have attended several estate sales with my mother. She quite enjoys them, and has a different view than I. She feels it is a privilege to be able to purchase treasures that the family doesn’t want or need. I feel it is an invasion into a persons personal life. Just a way for the adult children to dispose of family “junk” so as to settle everything before they return to their busy lives. I wonder if they would feel the same way if these items accumulated over the years could talk? If they knew the rich memories behind all of the family junk. If they knew what each piece had meant to the family member.....  Hello, I am  Grandfather Clock . I guess you could say I kept the time of this family, not just in minutes and hours, but in memories, too. It was me that father watched as each child was born into this family of mine. It was I who counted the time before the children went off to school, and before father went to work. My numbers taught the children to count. It was I that let out the chimes to signal bedtimes and curfews. Often, I was hated by the children because I signaled the end of some enjoyment, or the beginning of some dreaded chore. Over the years, I’ve seen the children come and grow and move away. It was I that was stopped when father passed away. I didn’t know then if I’d ever run again, but just as life kept on, so have I. Simply standing in this hallway, ticking away the minutes of this families life. Now that mother has passed away, our home is being separated and sold. I wish I could tell them all the things I remember. My memories are for sale at the price of $ 55.00.  I am  Miss Mirror . I have hung in this hallway for over fifty years. I was a present from father to mother. He used to stand in front of me, with his hands wrapped around mother, and tell her how beautiful she was. I’ve seen so many smiles! I’ve watched as mother fixed her hair before going to church on Sundays. I’ve watched father check his tie. I watched as son and daughter primped and checked their looks before dates, prom nights, and weddings. I saw the children grow from babies amazed at their reflections, to proud adults. I’ve also seen the tears when the family was told of brothers death in a war, of sisters car crash, and all the little arguments of a family. I’ve seen so much, but can tell them so little. I’m not worn out or used up, but I guess I’m useless to son and daughter. If only they could unlock the memories I have. My price is only $ 35.00.  I am  Mrs. Rocker . I’m the one who watched sleeping babies in mothers arms. I remember all the nights of colic, fevers, chicken pox, and broken hearts. I remember all the sleepless nights mother spent with me while waiting for some member of the family to return safely home. I’m the one who stayed up with father when he sorted out problems ranging from a disagreement with mother, to how to pay for daughters wedding. I’ve seen more worry than most of the house, but I’ve seen plenty of joy, too! Like the time mother discovered sons first tooth while nursing him right here! And the time mother discovered what it felt like to rock a grandchild for the first time. So many memories wrapped up for the small price of $ 45.00.  I am  Mr. Hammer . I supposedly belonged to father, but spent most of my time with mother. Oh, sure, father used me from time to time. To fix a few things like the nail in the front steps that keeps coming up, or putting up targets for sons first BB gun. Mostly though, I was used by mother. To open stuck windows, open paint can lids, and pull out old nails. I was once used to threaten a sewing machine that wouldn’t cooperate with mother while she was making a quilt for daughters wedding! I’ve had a few new handles over the years, but I work just like new. It seems with my experience, I would be worth more that the price tag of $ 2.00.  My name is  Ladle , and I guess I’m the speaker for the kitchen crew. I assume we are the least thought of because we are the cheapest priced. We range from a dime to a dollar. We all wonder if son and daughter remember all the after school snacks, sleep-over party favors, birthday cakes, and Sunday dinners that came from us and mother. Nothing could make us feel better than to see their smiling faces after they had finished eating mothers homemade cookies or special Saturday muffins. The things she made for this family were pure labors of love. The kitchen was so hot in the summer. We didn’t have fans or air conditioning. Mother always made things from scratch, never from a box. Everything in this kitchen speaks of her love for this family. We wonder if our new families will have that same love, or will we be considered outdated and thrown away at the end of this sale. If only we could talk!  With the breakdown of the family unit, it seems to me that some of us have forgotten just what the word family means. Think about your life. About your parents and your children’s lives. Will your children hold memories, or an estate sale price tag at the end of your life? How about you? Will you hold a tag, or will you remember the smiles of a gift given? You know, the trinket box you gave to your mother when you were little? Will you remember the fishing trips with you father when you see his old tackle box, or will you see the price of a lure? Look in your home today. Remember where you got each little knick-knack, each picture. Sure, some things may have no sentimental value, but what about the things that do? Think about these things the next time you see.......  *ESTATE SALE* 1234 ANY STREET YOUR TOWN, USA SATURDAY 9AM TO 2 PM
