       OMIGOD, I can't believe I forgot to write this in my first post about Chicago...there is the BIGGEST EVER Lerner (NY & Co) store here, on State St (one of the main shopping streets). It is heaven. We passed it when we got into Chicago on Wed night and I pointed and said "I HAVE to go there!!" It is two levels, with an escalator connecting them, and each level alone is bigger than any NY & Co store I've ever seen. I went there Thursday afternoon without buying anything (!), and then again today to get a zip-up jacket. It was in the high 50s and windy today, so I was very cold in a short sleeved t-shirt and capri pants! I thought that was a good excuse to go again, and it was a $17 well-spent, because it was even colder and windier this evening! :-)

       Lauren and Steve's trek across the country continues...last week, we were in Winston-Salem together for Z's high school graduation, each took brief trips to Las Vegas (me) and Seattle (him), and then back to W-S. After only 2 days back in State College, we were on the road again.     Why are we in Chicago, you ask? For a conference, the American Psychological Society (APS), the more experimental, research-based counterpart of the American Psychological Association (APA). My advisor, Lynn, was one of the invited speakers, so she encouraged me to submit a poster on my masters thesis. I did, it got in, and here I am. Once Steve looked at the program and saw all of the interesting talks, he decided that he'd pay the registration fee (freaking $100) to go also. We drove in Wed morning, 11 hrs in the car! I went to the State College library to get some books on tape--among them Paul Reiser "Couplehood" (I knew you'd be pleased with that choice, Erica!) and Dean Koontz "Intensity." We started Intensity and are 3 yrs, only a fourth of the way, through it! It is 12 hrs, 12 tapes! Craziness. That should get us to Minneapolis on Sunday (where Steve's family is, where we're going for a week after this) and even through the beginning of the return trip!   Thursday morning we went to a grant-writing workshop, and the keynote speech (given by Tulving, for those of you in psychology) "Memory, Consciousness and Time." He's an old German guy, but still gave a good talk and did one thing in particular that was HILARIOUS. He was talking about knowing the difference between things we've actually experienced vs. just imagined, and said "so, if you were getting bored at this talk and imagined that a gorilla came in the room, sat down and started listening to the talk, you would later be able to remember that that was only in your imagination and not an actual event." Then, the curtains behind him parted and a person in a gorilla suit came out, beat his chest on stage, and sat down in the audience. LOL!!!! That was great, after sitting in this packed lecture hall for over an hour, through boring award addresses! :-) After that, Steve & I found this great little Greek restaurant for dinner, where he ate almost an entire chicken (seriously!) and I had spinach salad with walnuts, blue cheese, tomatoes and plums, and spanikopida and olives. YUMMM.  Today, Steve and I "conferenced" (my new verb) in the morning and through mid-afternoon, and then headed to the Art Institute. It was great. I went to the impressionism, photography, contemporary and modern art sections...missed the stained glass, armor, earlier paintings, etc but we had limited time! Right now, Steve is napping (I got up after about 20 minutes), while I updated this. Next, we're heading to an Ethiopian restaurant for dinner, which is supposed to be good, spicy and vegetarian-friendly. (This was recommended by my friends Erin, Annie and Leah who were here for a conference a few weeks ago!) Apparently, they don't give utensils, just pita bread, which you're supposed to rip and use to eat the food! I can resist referencing the joke from "When Harry Met Sally," the line, "oh, I didn't know they had food in Ethiopia, this should be a quick meal!" LOL.   TOMORROW, I'm soooo excited because after conferencing in the morning, we're heading to the Museum of Science and Industry, which has an exhibit of actual human body slices :-O so you can see cell layers, internal organs, etc, as well as an exhibit on Jazz & Blues, and an IMAX movie about Jane Goodall and the chimps. I loooove comparative research with non-human primates, so this should be great!!! Later that night, we're going to the APS-sponsored show at the Second City Comedy Club. Woo hoo!!! :-)  Well, that's all, folks. It's time to wake up Steve (he's been sleeping for over an hour!) and head to Ethiopian food for dinner. I'm excited about trying something new!

       hmmmm...I was trying to post a comment to Erica's blog, but it sent me through the process to create my *own* blog when I thought I was just creating a username! Weird. Well, people have been bugging me to get a blog for a while, and apparently now I have one. I can't make any promises about how frequently I will update it...on one hand, I can see myself really getting into it. On the other hand, I can see myself losing interest in it. And on another hand, well I don't really have another point, I just wanted to pretend I had a 3rd hand.   So, welcome to my blog! :-)

       Mine grows very well! Hopefully this won't jinx it. TOMATOES: 3.5 weeks ago, I planted 2 red ones and 1 yellow/red striped one. However, when I was at Lowes last week, they had more tomato plants that already had little green tomatoes and looked very healthy. I couldn't resist!! I just had to get it....though I guess that's cheating a little, planting a plant that already has tomatoes on it! :-)  On the new addition, there are about 4 sizeable green ones and about 6 more budding. The most exciting breakthrough is that there are little tomatoes budding on the 2 red plants I planted originally. They're so cute! I can't see them unless you pick up the bud and turn it toward me, but when I do, there they are, little fetus tomatoes about the size of a pea! Mr. Stripey (red/yellow striped tomato plant) is not doing nearly as well, though. He's not as bushy and his leaves keep turning yellow & falling off.  :-(  I'll blame it on genetic engineering, to protect my newfound garden self-esteem. :-)  OKRA: planted from seeds, they are fabulous! They started to poke through the soil at 7 days (right on time) and the leaves & stalks are now about 6 inches tall. No signs of actual okra yet though. PEPPERS & CILANTRO: the rain almost drowned my cayene pepper (being a novice gardener, I hadn't noticed that the container didn't have very good drainage) and it successfully killed my cilantro. I replaced the cilantro with two more $2 plants, and re-planted the cayene pepper to a container with better drainage (it's looking better). Also, feeling pessimistic, I got a second pepper plant (cherry peppers, I'd never heard of them before!) just in case the cayene can't pull through. I feel like a new parent whose child has gotten sick or injured, so guilty.   :-\  SQUASH: the two plants are getting much bushier (and smell like squash too), but no baby squash yet. BASIL: by far the best. Every 3-4 days I have been using a handful of leaves, and it keeps replenishing, getting taller and bushier! ROSEMARY: also victim to the frequent rain and poor drainage container, it too has been replanted but is looking much better.  I think I'm hooked on vegetable gardens, and could definitely see myself planting them yearly! I just wish everything would grow faster. This is definitely not an activity for the impatient! I am getting better...I no longer check twice a day to "see if I have tomatoes for dinner yet." Steve said that he was going to go buy tomatoes and put them in the container as a joke! I wouldn't put it past him :-)

       It occurred to me that I haven't put an update on Steve's dissertation defense last Tuesday! It went well, although it was tough, and he passed with revisions. I actually got to sit in on the first hour, because he had an open defense. That means that anyone can come to the first hour to hear his formal presentation, and ask questions afterward, but then for the second hour everyone except his four-person committee leaves. It's a blessing and a bane to have an open defense (he got to choose): a blessing because people from the dept who aren't as familiar with your work may come and ask you relatively simple questions, but a bane because other faculty members who are not on your committee may come and be tough on you. There was some of that going on, faculty members asking Steve tough questions or challenging his theoretical position, all that seemed to come from the mindset "dammit, getting a PhD should be difficult and I'll make it difficult for you! I was given a hard time at my defense, and you should too. The dissertation defense is a rite of passage!"  Anyway, Steve has a month to do revisions, give it back to his committee to approve, and send to the Graduate School by the end of July. Then, he'll be Dr. Steve! :-)  By the way, I'm officially not getting my masters at the same time he gets his PhD. It would have been nice to have the same ceremony and celebration, but it also would have made my summer crazy. So, my goal is to defend my masters in early fall.  We just got back from Philadelphia, where Steve found an apartment for his move there. He'll be living in this cute little area of Philadelphia proper, that has a cobblestone main street, family-owned local places, and neat little shops. His apartment building is the tallest in the area, 16 floors! He has a big one-bedroom apartment on the 11th floor, newly renovated (new carpet, appliances, etc) and a pretty big balcony off the living room. There's space to put some plants and an outdoor table, so that will be nice too. We also made a trip to the King of Prussia mall, where I got THE most comfortable sandals in history at the Aerosoles store. They feel like bedroom shoes!  I have been feeling a little more panicked about him moving, as it becomes more real (e.g. his dissertation defense, finding an apt, other friends of ours finishing & moving)…I’m fine during the day, but at night I get sad.  :-(  Our lives will just be so different than they are now. Instead of working a decent day and kicking back and spending time with each other in the evenings, it will be work intensely during the week, so we can take the entire weekend off to spend with one another. It will take some getting used to, but I know we can do it. In the long run, 2ish years isn’t that much. I just have to keep telling myself those positive things even when I’m sad!  :-(

       Nothing too major, no life crisis. (“what, who died?!?”)  Allow me to explain:  I had a really long, semi-frustrating day. After hours and hours of mini-frustrations and irritations, they pile up and explode. I started the day at 8am, continuing to prepare as much as possible for my data analysis consulting appointment at the PSU Methodology Center. They provide two free appointments in one's graduate career, though they can't advice on dissertations, to help students and faculty analyze their data (especially when things get into sticky, unfamiliar, or unpredicted territory). For the most part, it was really helpful to explain my data and research questions to someone else, and get their feedback on the best approach to it.   The irritation of the day started though,   when in the beginning I felt like he was talking down to me (him: "you can do what's called a CHI SQUARE TEST."  me: "yes, I'm familiar with chi square"), though I quickly but politely established my areas of experience vs. non-experience. That appointment was at 2:00, though it started late because the man I was meeting with taught a class until 2:15 that his secretary was unaware of when she scheduled the 2:00 apt for me. So, we went 2:20-3:30, and I got back to the lab later than I had planned.   When I walked in, Lynn had begun talking to Libby, our wonderful undergrad RA (research assistant, not resident assistant!) about a task she wanted done by the end of the day...which I was supposed to explain, but was 20 minutes late! Lynn was a little snippy about it, which left me   internally snarling,   "well if my advisor was better with data analysis, YOU would be my brainstorming partner instead of the Methodology Center!!!" Then, Libby and I proceeded to do what was supposed to be a task that took a few hours. Ha! It actually took both of us 4 hours (so 8 hours total), until 8pm! By this time, I was tired & hungry (though I had a granola bar for snack, it was long gone).   Next frustration:   the campus bus out to the stadium (1.5 miles away) where I park, only runs until 6pm in the summer. So, I began walking, trying to think positively that this would let me blow off some steam. My spirits were lifted temporarily when I saw a city bus (though free on campus) at a stop sign, tried to flag her down to open the doors for me even though it wasn't a bus stop, to which I was greeted with obnoxious head-shaking and an accelerating bus. Argh. Give a girl a break! Or at least, don't be so rude about it. asdfhasdhfjahsdfahhsfjh!!!!!!   Next frustration:   traffic on the way home.   Next frustration:   being home for only 5 minutes, in time to grab mine & Steve’s stuff for dinner and head to his place.   Next frustration:   trouble finding a parking space in his neighborhood.  Next frustration:   it’s almost 9pm, I’m even more tired and hungry and have been on the commute (psych bldg-->parking lot-->home-->Steve’s place) for an hour.   Next frustration:   some rude woman beeping her horn at me way too long, loud & suddenly as I was getting out of my parallel-parked car (ok, I guess I should have looked for traffic behind me first, but I was running on low fuel!) That was the straw that broke the camel’s back. It took all the self-control I had to not scream at the top of my lungs and throw something at her (which would have, in essence, been screaming and throwing something at my entire day, just for a release). My solution was to pick up sticks, break them, and throw them on the ground, as I was walking to Steve’s place. Funny image now, but at the time, it was totally serious.  When I got to his apartment, I grabbed a cracker from the pantry and started crying. :-( Low blood sugar, 12-hr day, and small frustrations sum up to this! He made me eat a banana and hugged me for a long time (awwwww). The banana made all the difference! Then, I was able to speak more calmly and rationally about everything, and heated up dinner (leftover pesto, a good mood-lifter dinner for me!). Whew. Even for the rest of the night, I was sort of a mess—cried while watching Sex & the City, etc.  Better now. And going to bed. :-)

       [opening news channel music]  Hello, I'm Lauren and this *IS* [insert Dan Rather smile here] my blog.  Z has reached his first town on the Appalachian Trail, after a week and a half of hiking 100 miles! They had planned on two weeks (to arrive Wed June 16), but were ahead of schedule and got there Sunday evening, June 13. A few days before that, Z started having knee trouble, the same knee that he had twisted when he sprained his ankle in ice hockey this winter. Apparently it was really swollen and he could barely walk on it. Our family doctor, Dr. Kelly, had given him his home and cell phone number, in case they needed any medical advice along the way, and Z actually used it. That means that the pain must have been *really* bad, because Z doesn't like to admit he's in pain, or seek help! He told him to put cold compresses on it, wrap it if they had anything to do so, keep it elevated whenever possible, take Advil, and do a few slower days if possible. They did, and got to this town in Maine in one piece. He has now seen a doctor there, and is taking a few days off the trail, until Thursday.   PERSONAL OPINION AHEAD:  I'm a bit peeved at Pete, Z's friend who is hiking with him. The first day that Z first started having knee problems, Pete was a little ahead on the trail and kept wondering where Z was, since he wasn't catching up. Finally, Z came hobbling up, obviously in a lot of pain. That's the evening that he called Dr. Kelly! Anyway, why was Pete so far ahead of Z in the first place, and why didn't he backtrack a little when he noticed that Z wasn't catching up? What if Z had fallen and truely couldn't walk, or if he had been attacked by a bear or moose? (They did see a moose, which they said was about 8 feet tall!!!) Or what if Pete had gotten into trouble? Isn't the point of having a partner on a 6 month hike so that you can keep an eye out for each other? Second, Z is taking a 3 day (Mon-Wed) break to recuperate, and going back on the trail on Thursday. Pete left this morning (Tuesday) and went on ahead, instead of waiting! On Thursday, "the pie lady," a friend of the Appalachian Trail who takes care of hikers coming through, is taking Z to a location to meet Pete. What's so bad about waiting 2 more days so your hiking buddy can heal? Would that really kill him?! It seems a bit bull-headed to me. Once again, what's the point of hiking this thing with a partner if you're not going to watch out for each other?   Another funny story: they met this guy along the way and set up camp with him one night. The next morning, the guy started hiking before Z and Pete left the campsite. Later, they were hiking along and Z (who was a few feet ahead of Pete) stopped in his tracks and Pete almost ran into him. Z pointed ahead--they had caught up with the guy, who was in front of them, hiking merrily along wearing only hiking boots and his backpack. He laughed at their reaction and said this was something he had always wanted to do, and where else is the best place to do it than on the Appalachian Trail? :-) LOL.  In a related story (nature, outdoors), my garden is growing wonderfully! Yesterday I noticed that I have okra leaves pushing up from the soil. I planted them exactly a week ago, and they were supposed to sprout in 7-10 days, so they're right on schedule. My baby cayene peppers are also getting larger slowly but surely, the basil is becoming more bushy, and the tomato plants are getting taller!  :-D  In the meantime, I can go to the Farmers Market to get vegetables from area farmers and Amish.  OHHH! That reminds me! Also in a related story (Amish), I forgot to tell a funny story about our yard sale this past weekend. A van full of Amish women and children came to our yard sale. You know you're in central PA when Amish come to your yard sale, LOL! The van was actually driven by a woman "dressed English" (as they say), since Amish aren't allowed to own or drive cars. Recently, Steve and I saw a documentary ( urlLink Devil's Playground by Lucy Walker ), about Amish youth going on their "rumspringa" (Dutch for "running around"). Once teens turn 16, they're allowed to experience the outside world. For them, this consists of "dressing English," partying, doing drugs, drinking, owning and driving cars, holding jobs, having sex, etc. Then, they make the choice whether they want to join the Amish church or not, and the Amish feel that this makes their decision more informed and real. (The question is: how informed is it really, since they have the equivalent of an 8th grade education and are qualified primarily for factory jobs or hard labor? How realistic is it for your exposure to the outside world to be such intense, hardy partying?) Anyway, only during rumspringa are women allowed to wear jewelry, and one of these teen girls who attended our yard sale bought one of Nassim's bracelets. After they left, I said, "I bet she was buying that for her rumspringa!" and I felt very in the know.  That's all for tonight. For now, I'm Lauren (tomorrow I might be someone else). Thanks for tuning in! :-)

       Ta da! I changed my template again, and I think I'm finally unique. First, I chose "dots dark" without realizing that that's  urlLink Nicole's template . Then, I chose "Rounders 4," which turned out to be  urlLink Tucker's template . Now, I have "tic-tac blue," and gosh darnit, I'm committed to it this time! I hope no one (who I know, that is) copies me to drive me insane.  :-)    You'll also notice that I have a profile of sorts now, inspired by  urlLink Erica . Note that I made Erica a link just now (and to Nicole and Tucker's blogs in the previous paragraph!), and that in my profile, the headings are in bold. I used html formatting to do that (also, thanks to Erica), and I'm very proud that it all worked on the first try! :-) For some reason, the buttons for bold, italic, and making links don't show up on my browser, though sometimes I have a spell-check button. Weird. I need to check it on a different browser and/or different computer...Jack sent an e-mail about blogger disabling those on certain browsers that had trouble with them.  This weekend, my roommates and I had a yard sale on Saturday. I made $50 on old clothes & shoes, Nassim made $115 on jewelry, clothes, and household items, and Lyndsey made $30 on the same sort of stuff (though hers was priced much lower, most 25 and 50 cents!). Then, Steve brought over homemade pizza and salad for dinner (he had taken my car over to his place that morning). It was especially exciting that we topped the pizza with basil from my garden! A week ago, I planted 4 basil plants, 2 regular tomato plants, 1 red/yellow striped tomato plant (he's called "Mr. Stripey," LOL), 2 squash plants, a bunch of okra seeds, rosemary, cayenne pepper, yellow pepper, and cilantro. I already have baby peppers on the cayenne pepper, and the tomato plants have gotten much thicker!   Then, Steve went back to work on his dissertation, and I went to see “The Stepford Wives” with some girlfriends. It was good…very funny (satirical mostly) but dark dark dark! The idea of making wives into domestic robots is so creepy!  Well, that’s all folks. Ta ta for now!

       What the hell is up with this?! So, recently I witnessed an incident that I think was demeaning and unnecessary. A friend (Person A, a graduate student) and a friend of a friend (Person B, an undergrad, but an adult student, he's about 29) were having a conversation. Person B started talking about how he wants to stop smoking, but has heard that the reason you gain weight is because of the stress hormone "cortisone." At this point, Person A smirked and said in a ridiculing tone of voice, "cortisone?? You mean cortisol." He was obviously embarrassed, and my heart went out to him. :-(  What is the point of this? Does it make Person A feel better to put others down? Does she really need to stoop that low to boost self-esteem? She could have corrected him just as well without the attitude, without the belittling. Argh. Pet peeve!

       Nassim and I just got back from seeing the Harry Potter 3 movie. It was excellent! It has been a while since I read the 3rd book, but they left out some important details (e.g. who are Padfoot, Wormtail, etc and why did they became animaguses). I had to explain that to Nassim after the movie. Overall though, WOW! I love the flying and fighting scenes. I even found myself ducking for flying objects and the Whomping Willow! :-)  Other movies I want to see: Shrek 2 (but first Steve has to see the 1st one), Stepford Wives.

       Yay!! After being on the road since Saturday morning, I'm back in State College! We got in at 5:30pm, after leaving Toledo at 11:15 this morning. We didn't want to set an alarm, and were shocked that we slept in until 10:00 (Steve) and 10:30 (me)! That's the same as the 9pm rising time we did every morning in Minneapolis, so maybe our circadian rhythms hadn't reset yet. In any case, I'm home and about to go to the grocery store (Wegmans!), because my cupboard isn't bare, but my section of the fridge is. I have salad dressing, cheese, Indian curry sauce, and eggs...not really dinner-able.  And yes, I'll be on Sunday chat. I even have an alarm on my cell phone set for it. "See" some of you peeps at 9:30 EST!

       As I write this, it is Saturday night (June 5) and we are driving across Indiana on I-80, a little over halfway on our final trek from Minneapolis back to State College. We’ve been on the road for about 11 hrs (ugh), but we are going to drive another couple hours to Toledo, stop for the night, and drive the remaining 6 hrs tomorrow, Sunday, in hopes of getting there with time to grocery shop, catch up on mail, do laundry, etc and jump into the week feet first on Monday. Steve will be finishing his dissertation this next week, to give to his committee next week, to defend his dissertation the week after that! :-O Needless to say, he’s a little stressed about that.   The rest of the trip to Minnesooooooota was great! At the Mall of America on Tuesday, I bought new black sandals (slight heel, criss-cross straps).  Later that night and also Fri after dinner for drinks, we went to visit Steve’s college friends and roommates for his last year at “the U” (The University of Minnesota): Pam & Aaron (married now), Betsy, and Dave (a new edition the past couple years, Betsy’s boyfriend). I had heard a lot about them, and it was fun to hang out and get to know them! Their tradition when they get together is to play Monopoly and listen to David Bowie. I only observed both games, as they are a sacred tradition and any newbies change the dynamics of the game. Well, I was Steve’s official dice-roller in the second game, his good luck charm (and he won!). I’m not mean enough to play Monopoly well (with them, anyway), to exchange property, wheel and deal my way to fortune, etc. :-)  Of course, I got the inevitable question, “what are your intentions with our Steve?” when he was out of the room, and he got the “so where is this going, heh??” question when I was out of the room. LOL. And just in case YOU are wondering, our plans are to be together, but an official tying of the knot won’t happen for 2-3 more years.  Wednesday morning, Steve’s dad Gene had also made us his cracked wheat breakfast cereal, which was so excellent, I brought back the recipe for it.  It tastes like a nutty oatmeal, especially how he fixed it with apples, raisins, cinnamon and brown sugar. YUMMY and good for you! Then, we continued having a healthy morning and went to the gym. In the afternoon, we both went to Stillwater with Steve’s mom Kathy, and his sister Jen. It’s this cute little town about 30 minutes from them, on the St. Croix River. They had lots of antique shops, arts & pottery studios, hip boutiques, and the like—something for everyone! I bought a $2.50 used copy of a 1940 edition of “Anne of Green Gables,” which I absolutely *loved* growing up.  We also found the perfect Fathers Day gift for both their dad and mine—a flax seed grinder (a good source of fiber and Omega-3s…especially important for vegetarians but a good supplement for everyone). They’re both into health food, raw food, vitamins and supplements. Too funny that it’s perfect for both dads, isn’t it?? Steve & Jen already gave their dad his present, and at the Jax house, it now sits on the table beside the pepper and salt grinders!   We also went to a hip uptown theater to see a documentary, “Super Size Me.” It’s about this guy who decides to eat nothing but McDonalds for 30 days, and the effects it has on his physical and emotional health. He had a team of doctors and a nutritionist follow him—he was eating 5000 instead of the needed 2500 calories to maintain his weight, and as a result, gained 10 lbs in the first 5 days, and 25 lbs total by the end of the 30 days. His cholesterol doubled, his liver wasn’t functioning well, he was depressed, and started to become addicted because he felt elated only immediately after eating. :-O  If it comes to your town, see it, though be warned that you may never want to eat fast food again!  Thursday we went to the gym again, and had a lazy day, sunning ourselves by the neighborhood lake, reading and we even took a nap. We have invented something we call “Naps Across America,” taking note of the public places where we’ve napped. So far, it’s Pittsburgh, Florida Keys, Detroit airport, San Francisco park by the Golden Gate bridge, and now Shoreview MN. :-)  We also took a walk around a different lake that night with Kathy (Steve’s mom) and saw several deer up close, some less than 10 feet away! Check out my webshots soon to see pictures…deer are such beautiful animals, even though I fear them when I’m in my car!  TOTAL LAKE COUNT that Lauren has seen in Minneapolis: 7 out of 10,000. Total lakes walked around: 2.  Friday, we went to the Minneapolis Institute of Art in the morning, where I bought postcards of my favorite pieces of art. My ultimate plan is to put them together on the wall above my bed in a collage, and after several years of collecting them like this, I have quite a few! Then, we met Jen (Steve’s sister) at the free zoo in the afternoon. I have some pictures of the gorillas and orangutans (a baby one too!) that will be appearing on my webshots soon, so stay tuned.  Well, we’re now in Ohio and only about 30 minutes away from our resting place for the night! We haven’t had dinner yet either, though we did have a late, filling lunch of Indian food (yumm). Leave me a comment if you love me! :-)

       ["Minnesota" should be said with the drawn-out "o" of the midwestern accent]   Yes, another city! We rolled into Minneapolis/St. Paul on Sunday night (May 30) and met Steve's mom, dad, and sister downtown for Thai food. I had the vegetarian pad thai, which was excellent but HUGE portions--I swear, this must have been 3 cups of noodles. Why can't restaurants give you half of the food for half of the price?!? Then, we took Steve's sister, Jennifer/Jen/Jenny back to her new apartment near the University of MN (where she'll be a senior) that she had just moved into that weekend. We chatted and hung out for a little bit, and she warned us that two bedrooms were prepared for us back at the house, though Steve's mom had said she didn't know if we'd be sleeping in the same room. This surprised Steve...he had figured, even though they are Catholic, they'd be cool with us sleeping in the same bedroom--after all, he's 26, there aren't small kids in the house, they know we've been on trips together, and we even got a hotel room across from them in Lancaster last summer during their visit! Anyway, Steve was prepared to just ask them if it was OK and lay out the rational reasons why, but first tried the subtle approach--just go in and put our stuff in one of the bedrooms. His logic was simple: they're non-confrontational, so as long as we don't ask, they won't correct. It worked. :-) Maybe they just didn't want to assume, which is nice, but it's also nice that we can continue to cuddle at night and in the morning. :-)  Today, we just "farted around" (as my mom would say)--slept in, showed slide shows of our pictures of various trips, went to the grocery store, got a tour of the town and neighborhood, took a nap. Then, we met Sarah (our good friend from State College) in uptown Minneapolis, for dinner and walking around a lake. Sarah is from Tracey, MN (about 3 hrs southwest), and is in MN visiting family for a few weeks. It just so happened that she was planning to be in the cities for a few days when we were here, so we decided to meet up!  Tomorrow (Tues JUNE 1, omigod I can't believe it's June already!), we're going to the Mall of America in the morning/early afternoon. I am on a mission for cute, comfortable black sandals with a small heel. It's a rare find...dun dun dunnnn. Then, we're going over to grill for dinner (veggie burgers and pineapple for me, chicken for them) with Steve's college friends Pam, Aaron and Betsy. He lived in an apartment with Aaron and Betsy his senior year, and they still keep in touch. Pam is Aaron's wife. I've talked to both Aaron and Besty, because Steve gave them my cell phone number, and they sound friendly--and very excited to meet me, which is ego-boosting!  Nicole asked, "what's the scoop? how do you like his parents? DETAILS!" :-) His parents are very nice, I like them a lot. They're just kind, gentle, midwestern folk. I had met them last August when they came to PA to visit, and we even took a mini-trip to Lancaster/Amish country. They both grew up on farms in Iowa. His mom is a nurse/manager at a VA Hospital in "the cities" (as they say locally), and his dad is a retired VP of Finance at several different companies. Now, his dad spends his days fiddling with the grill, making smoked meats, and designing gadgets, it's cute. And, his dad is really into health food, vitamins, and juicing. He and my dad would get along well on that area, though as a whole they are very different! Gene is more soft-spoken and logical than my dad! His mom (Kathy) is also cute, into gardening, crafts, planning her retirement, and her kids. The way she talks about Steve & Jenny's childhood, you can tell they are fond memories! Jenny is cool too, a kindred spirit. She reminds me a lot of Alice the Bunny :-) in style of dress, decoration, music, etc. She loves ethnic things, especially anything having to do with Mexican culture. She speaks fluent Spanish, and has an internship in St. Paul at a Latino cultural/advocacy center. It's really cute how much she looks up to Steve--e-mails him her papers from college to proofread, called him for comfort when her boyfriend broke up with her a few months ago, etc.   RANDOM FACT: The license plates on Minnesota cars say "10,000 lakes" because there are lakes EVERYWHERE. It is my goal to count how many I see. So far: 4. And, I've walked the 3 mile perimeter of one of those, with Steve and Sarah tonight! :-)  Ta ta for now!

       Hellllooooo! I'm in NC for a week. I got here Wed July 28 and I'm leaving Tues Aug 3. Steve is in Hawaii during this time.  :-P  What a hard life he has!!!  ;-)  I took him to the Baltimore airport Wed morning, and I'm spending the night in Baltimore again this coming Tues night (and hopefully Katherine will be joining me!) and picking him up Wed morning. He's having all sorts of fun:  went scuba diving (touched an octopus on the head!), snorkeling (with wild turtles!), hiked to a waterfall, and tomorrow he's taking a helicopter tour around the island. He's on Kauai, the most uninhabited, natural of all the Hawaii islands. He went by himself, but met up for a few days with two of our friends from Penn State. They were there for the APA annual conference, but Steve sure isn't, LOL!  Thursday I cleaned out my room at home, for a new tenant to move in today. For 10 years, my parents have been talking about renting a room to a student at some point and it has finally happened. They wanted to do it the spring before I went to graduate school, but I had a fit because I would have had nowhere to live for 3 months! I told them that, once I went to Penn State, I wouldn't mind, but before, I would be very upset about being displaced. Anyway, their ultimate plan has always been to renovate the basement into an apartment (kitchen, bathroom, etc) but that would cost a lot up front, so for now they're just renting my old bedroom. It's upstairs and only shares a bathroom with Z's room, so there's more privacy than if all 4 bedrooms were together. Plus, Z is on the trail until December, so he'll have the whole upstairs to himself! The guy's name is Eddie, and he's a physics graduate student at Wake Forest, from China. His wife is in a graduate program at Appalachian, so this was a perfect deal for them--it's cheap ($200) compared to all other apartments around town, which is good since they're paying two rents, and he'll only be in W-S during the week, and Boone for weekends and holidays. It sucked that I had to spend a whole day at the beginning of my visit cleaning out my room (leaving furniture though), and I have to stay in Z's room for the rest of the time, but it makes sense because I'm only home 2-3 weeks a year. What remains to be planned is where I'll stay once Z gets back from hiking the Appalachian Trail, and moreover, where Steve & I would stay if he comes home with me for Christmas this year. There is a pull-out couch in the basement....but the basement is cluttery and makes me insane!!! We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, I guess.  Friday, I went down to Greenville and Furman and saw 3 people in 5 hours! I walked around campus & chatted with my friend Julie (just graduated, 2 yrs younger than I am), then visited with Sophia (aka "Dr. P," my wonderful undergrad research advisor) for a little while, and then had dinner with Bryan (aka "Bryyyyyyyyaannnn," as Z says). All of these people are moving from Greenville in the next couple days, too, so I caught them just in time! Julie is moving to Columbia SC for the music education graduate program at USC. Sophia has resigned from her faculty position at Furman :-O because she was burned out after only 5 years, working too much, and although everything looked great for tenure, decided that a life that crazy was not a long-term solution. She, her husband, and 2-year-old daughter are moving to St. Louis, where her family is, and she will be teaching at a community college. She’s happy about the choice, even though it’s a serious downgrade, and one that’s not easy to reverse. She won’t have a lab or have any active research, so it will be difficult for her to get another four-year college job ever again. It’s sad and scary to me that one of my role models has already burned out on academia! Sophia was one of my inspirations for going into this field, and I hate to see that she has become disillusioned with it so quickly.  :-(  I caught Bryan on his way out of town, to move to San Francisco CA, seriously. He had spent all that day packing the moving van with his & his girlfriend’s stuff. He locked his apartment, dropped off the keys, met me at Subway for dinner, and then he & his girlfriend were heading to Chattanooga to spend the night and continue on to CA today. Crazy!!! Get this…he will be working for the Girl Scouts of Santa Clara County, doing web and computer stuff. Even funnier, everyone who works for the Girl Scouts has to join! ROTFL.  Today, I’m hanging out with my mom & grandmother, and might meet up with my aunt (“Aunt Sister”) for coffee in a little bit. Lazy days are lovely things.

        Tonight, Steve and I went to Mary & Dan's place for a little birthday celebration for Dan. We got him the&nbsp;game   &nbsp;  urlLink  Set   &nbsp;for his birthday gift, and it was already a hit! It took everyone a bit to get into the rhythm of the rules, but we played it for about an hour and a half! It is a hoot playing it with other psychology graduate students...it's such a game of cognitive psychology...we were discussing how it could be used in  visual search experiments (e.g. how efficiently you look for a card that would complete a set),   how salience affects speed of judgments (e.g. solid color ones "stick out" more),&nbsp;  divided attention (e.g. whether we knew the words to the song playing affected how many we&nbsp;sets we could get per minute), &nbsp; how response&nbsp;inhibition is important (e.g. checking a set before calling it out...did you know you're supposed to deduct a point for every false call?),  etc. All of this on a Fri night...yes, we're psychology&nbsp;nerds but proud of it! Dan was especially good at it, which is great since (1) his dissertation defense is Monday--ego boost! :-)&nbsp;and (2) his area is cognitive psychology.     &nbsp;   Also, check out the  urlLink Set website  for daily puzzles, and new rules to play by...pretty cool!     &nbsp;   While playing Set, I told the story about  urlLink Erica asking Jack , "will you marry me?" jokingly, because he was straightening the Set cards into a neat grid, 6 or so months before they even started dating .(Although she already had a bigtime crush on him!) Whaddaya know...and now they are married! Awwww....&nbsp; :-D     In other news, I can't sleep....at 2am. I had several cups of coffee at our gathering tonight, and I am wired! I never think coffee affects me that much during the day, but I can tell a big difference when I drink it at night! I am also typing this in the dark, since Steve is asleep. I'm doing pretty well on typing accuracy too, since the keyboard is dark and my glasses prescription is several years old, so I have to get a few inches away to get enough light and have it in focus! LOL. This is a situation when a "KIK" moment could happen, if my fingers were on the wrong keyboard row. :-)     You may have noticed that my blog is&nbsp;all different colors today, with more links than usual!&nbsp;This is the first time I've updated my blog from a PC, and I have all the cool buttons for font, color, links, etc that I don't have on Internet Explorer for Mac, or Safari.   Hmph. :-P     Just because I can, I'll end by providing a link to the picture of  urlLink my first ripening tomato !!! This was actually taken last weekend, but I picked this one and two of its siblings yesterday. They are waiting patiently to be turned into tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella salad for Saturday dinner. YUMMM!!!!     Here's to hoping I can sleep now....g'night!

       I'm using this forum to vent a little on my two otherwise great roommates. First of all, they’re great friends and mostly very clean and considerate. But, I feel like I'm the only one who does the little things--clean the microwave, sweep the floor, mow the lawn, wash the dishtowels. Second, although everyone is good about doing their dishes, they are not so good about putting them up. Example: roommate A made blueberry muffins last Monday. As of Sunday (yesterday), the mixing bowls and muffin pans were still on the counter next to the drying rack. I think they're dry after a week, don’t you?! They were there because she didn't put them up, and I refused to, sort of timing how long it would take for her to do so. I finally got fed up and put them away myself. I've timed other things like this in the past, and the longest "drying dishes" situation has been two weeks. TWO WEEKS!!! This is a repeating pattern, with me waiting until I’m fed up, or until I need counter space to cook, or until I’m about to have friends over and feel the need to clean those little things (microwave, putting away dishes, sweeping, etc) beforehand. Also, our lawn has needed to be mowed for several weeks, but again, I'm not going to suck it up and do it. I’ve done that too many times before, and then been resentful about it. Not only have I mowed the last **three** times, but my allergies have really bothered me for about 24-36 hours afterward (e.g. headaches, sneezing, stuffiness). Maybe that's because one of the things I'm allergic to is grass!  I feel caught between a rock and a hard place because I don't want to be the police, asking people to do chores they should do in the first place, or be a pain in the ass and suggest a chore checklist. On the other hand, I know I'm being a little passive-aggressive by not doing things on purpose, just waiting to see when someone else will do them. I have a tough time speaking up about things I need to be done, as you can tell. However, I also dislike it when others don't communicate their needs to me, and then get mad about it. So, I'm being a total hypocrite and I know it, but yet I have a hard time speaking up about this, because I don’t want to be the mean roommate police. What’s so wrong with asking people to put up their own dishes, or mow the lawn because I’ve done it the past couple times and it bothers my allergies?? I just feel weird about it, because people should keep up with their own shit, do their share of the community work, and I shouldn’t have to tell them to do it.  This is part of the reason why I want to live alone starting next fall, for my fourth year at PSU, even though to do so I'll have to take out a small loan to subsidize my graduate stipend. If there are dishes in the sink, they’re mine! If the house is a mess, it's my mess! For six years and counting, I have established that I can live in harmony with others (current irritations aside), and I’d like to be a little more independent before Steve & I move in together in Philadelphia the following year.   Advice? Comments? Suggestions? Actually, in mid-August, one roommate moves out and a new person moves in, so this may be the time for change, without me feeling like the roommate police. :-)

       That's what I did this weekend, Sunday night to be specific!  You're probably thinking, "OK, that's it, Lauren has officially gone nuts."  Why?  I was watching the 4th of July fireworks!  It had been nice weather in State College for about two weeks (which is amazing and never happens) but it just had to break the record on the 4th of July.  It didn't actually start raining until 8:30, and they had already made the decision to go ahead with the $300,000 fireworks show, the best one in central PA.  Steve & I didn't want to fight the crowds to go by the stadium to watch them, especially since it seemed likely they would be postponed, so we had planned to watch from a nearby cornfield.  The fireworks were nice as always, especially since they actually managed to syncronize them to the music on the radio this year.  Usually it's just background noise.  About halfway through, lightning and thunder started too, which was a cool effect until we realized that we were standing in a thin tree cover in the middle of a cornfield, holding metal sticks (umbrellas)!!  :-O  When the show was over, we were running back to the part of the path that was covered by trees when I slipped on my flipflops and one of them broke!  (The part that holds the middle thong in between my toes came out.)  So, I had to walk one-shoed the rest of the way.  It was raining so hard that umbrellas didn't even help us, and our clothes got all muddy from the splash of our walking/running and wet from the blowing rain.  There was one part of the path that was flooded too, it came up to mid-calf!  We were soaked to the bone by the time we got back to the car, but laughing at what an experience this was too!    Steve wasn't even that crazy about going to see the fireworks, but went with me because he knew it was important to me.  Then he trudged through rain, mud, and subjected himself to lightning.  I have the best boyfriend, I am so lucky!  :-)

       It's midnight on a Friday night, and I just got in from covering my tomato & squash plants with a tarp, sheets & wool blankets. The low was 48, and I was concerned for their well-being. I read on a gardening website that you should cover them if the low gets below 55 degrees. I brought in the smaller containers to the garage (e.g. basil, rosemary, pepper plants, etc) but didn't dare move the squash and tomatoes, because they're so big and delicate. I clustered them together, taped tomato stakes on lawn chairs for height, and draped the covers over them to the ground. (The tomatoes were taller than the chairs, so if I had draped stuff on the backs of the chairs alone, it would have crushed the tops of them.)   I now have a tent of sorts in my front yard. Steve said that even his mom doesn't go to such lengths for her garden! But, it's only early August and I couldn't bare (no pun intended) to see them hurt! I think I've become too emotionally attached to my garden!

       I'm back in PA, safe and sound. Tuesday night, I drove up to Baltimore to spend the night, and be there when Steve got in from Hawaii at 10am the next morning. Katherine was going to come meet me, but she didn't feel well, so I ended up having a "Lauren night." I had thought staying in a hotel room alone would be scary or creepy, but it was actually quite fun! I got Panera take-out for dinner, had South Carolina peaches & vanilla ice cream, and watched a special on developmental psychology research on the Discovery Health channel ("The Baby Human"). It comes on again Sat 8/7 from 12-3:00, and I'm going to try to tape it to use in a class of my own someday, whenever I get to teach Child Development. It had clips from research that I was already familiar with, but it was awesome to see actual examples of the studies! It was really interesting, and I got re-excited about my career as a developmental researcher! :-)  Speaking of which, we found out our fall teaching assistant positions. No surprise, but I got Psych 213, Intro to Child Development. The students go to lecture by the faculty member Monday and Wednesday (class size 300+), and on Fridays they are divided into smaller sections of about 30 people. I'll teach 2 or 3 of those every Friday, doing more hands-on things like discussions, debates (things like "Is Spanking Good or Bad for Children?"), and applied learning activites. For example, when the topic is language development, small groups have to form their own language and teach it to another group, without using English, similar to the challenge that a baby has when learning his/her first language. TAs also give guest lectures sometimes, grade papers, and meet with students if they have questions about studying, tests they've taken, or writing papers. I've had a research assistantship my whole time here so far, but teaching & mentoring is one of the things I've enjoyed most about working with my undergraduate research assistants during that time. So, I'm really excited about teaching in a more formal setting.  Katherine & I reached a new height in craziness....on Wednesday, Steve & I were heading back to State College on I-83 North after I picked him up from the airport, and we were 20 miles from York and getting hungry for lunch. I called Katherine to see if she was feeling better, and if she wanted to meet us before she went to work. She couldn't, because she was already on I-83 South to meet Hay's mom for lunch. We figured out that we would pass each other in a while, and periodically updated each other on where we were in terms of mile markers. A few minutes later, she was just north of mile marker 4, and I was just south of it. I was stretching my neck to see over the high median, but I missed seeing her as she passed.  :-(  However, she said, "omigod, are you beside an orange truck??" and I looked beside me and I was! She thought she had recognized my car, and saw that the driver was on a cell phone, but couldn't really tell it was me. We had a good laugh at that one, passing each other at about 140 miles an hour (we were both going 70 mph)!! It was like those math problems from middle & high school:  Katherine leaves York going 75 mph on I-83 South, beginning at PA mile marker 19. Lauren leaves Baltimore going 70 mph on I-83 North, beginning at MD mile-marker 20. The MD/PA state line is between MD-mile 39 and PA-mile 1. In how many miles, and in how many minutes, will Katherine and Lauren pass each other?"  ROTFL!  :-)
