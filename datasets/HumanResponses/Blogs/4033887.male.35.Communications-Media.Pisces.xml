      Hmmm...well despite the mess I was in last nite, I actually had the best nite's sleep that I've had in weeks. I was so refreshed today and just zoomed through all my work at the office. Weird how things like that happen. I thought I'd be a hungover mess but I feel great! Not sure if I should tempt fate and go out again but I'll play it by ear.  On another note, my friend David, who lives in SF, ended up falling on a wet, metal grate and sustained abrasions and a sore back.  urlLink Get well David!

       urlLink     urlLink More than 1500 people lined up  for half a mile to pick up their new iPod Minis at the Tokyo store. Emaciated, drug-addled models were also on hand to push the new Minis.

       urlLink     If some of you have gone to my friend David's  urlLink "We make Rice-A-Roni from Tourists" blog  then you'll know he's referring to a near accident on my recent trip to SF. I was one of the tourists almost made into a San Francisco treat. There was much screaming, not from me I SWEAR, but from some middle-aged couples also on the ride. No picture of that event BUT here's a pic of us hurtling down the hill before it happened. I was holding onto the pole and hanging outside the cable car for this shot. What a rush!

      Whew! My&nbsp; new iPod turned out to be ok and is working fine. I'll be putting up my iPod mini (awww!) up on eBay for the world to bid on. I'll miss the mini but well I decided I should've bought a color instead of silver and I'd like to wait till it holds more and costs less. It was fun for the&nbsp; 5 months I had it, though.   >  urlLink Here's a link of note for you iPod fans.   >  urlLink You can even turn the iPod into a universal remote!   >  urlLink Oh yeah and here's the Ebay listing for my iPod Mini I'm selling.  :-(

       ::POLITICS::   All day I keep getting asked "Did you watch the Democratic Convention?". Nope. It's ironic that I live in DC but could care less about politics. I know how I'm voting so I don't need to see all the rah rah rah of it all. Personally, I'd love to see Clinton come back but that's not possible. Besides I live in the "hate state": VA!! We always skew Republican irregardless of the voting. But yes I'll be voting for Kerry of course.    ::TV::   It's tv night and my favorite reality show is on; at least it better be. If the convention pre-empts it I'll&nbsp;be pissed.&nbsp;If you haven't watched  urlLink Amazing Race , you owe it to yourself to check it out. It's the most exciting reality show on TV and it even has a little educational tidbits thrown in. I'm rooting for the little person and her cousin. Go Charla!   Also of note that is on tonite is Nip/Tuck and  urlLink Joe Schmoe 2 . That scene where the girl pretends to be into porn and is having pork and beans thrown on her in a bathtub is the funniest sh*t I've seen in months. I think the title of the fake porn is called "Porked &amp; Beans"..hahahah!!

       urlLink     I just recently got back from a fantastic trip to SF. I was trying to get over my fear of flying which I've always had. Well ok, I was trying to get over my fear of plummeting to a fiery death but I digress. Thanks to my friend  urlLink David , who gave us a fantastic tour and overview of the area, I'm itching to move there now. We'll see. Oh and that's my ex trying to sneak into my picture. Thanks for ruining my shot, Chad! Grrr..

       urlLink This is just ridiculous . Can't believe the artist changed this and frankly she can say it wasn't from outside pressure but I think otherwise. Isn't this akin to covering up naked sculptures to "protect us"?

      so I'm sitting here at work and bored. Don't get me wrong; I actually have things to do. Right now I'm more interested in fixing this blog and the weird niggily things that I find wrong with it. I'm a designer. It's in my nature.   Also my new iPod gave me the scare today. I stuck it in my messenger bag so I can listen to tunes on the metro (DC's version of the subway). Well it promptly died after the second song. I'm charging it up now at work hoping that not enough charging is all that's wrong with it. Ugh. Apple store has 10% restocking fees. That's just criminal.

      Well Catwoman rated a 10% out of a 100 on  urlLink rottentomatoes.com ..gad I knew that would be a stinker right on the heels of Van Helsing and so many movies with no plot and lots of CGI (badly done CGI at that) action.  urlLink Even Matt Damon beat her out.  &nbsp;What a pile of cat litter.   Movies have been sucking lately. The last good movies I saw were Farenheit 9/11 and Spiderman 2. The Village looks like it might be good but M. Night Shymalan (sp?) &nbsp;gets on my nerves. I "tried" to watch the "documentary" on him this weekend on Sci-Fi but it was just a big piece of self promoting blather. Sort of like this blog!   Meanwhile, the next Star Wars flick is called  urlLink Revenge of the Sith . I hope it is better than the other two. I will always like the original 3 though.

      I bought a new  urlLink iPod  today to replace my iPod Mini. I've only had the Mini for a few months but decided I needed the space. I suppose I'll put the Mini up on eBay. It's crazy how they are actually going for more on eBay than what I paid for it originally.

      So more details about me. Oh yeah, I'm gay. No big deal. I've known and even dated guys when I was 16. The last few weeks I've been hanging out with this one guy. I like him. Problem is I have no idea if he is even interested in me. We talk a couple of times a week and hang out maybe once or twice during that time. But nothing happens at the end of the night. I'm not sure if he's just not interested or if he's protecting himself from his recent breakup. And well, do I really want a rebound boy?

      I should introduce myself before my 15 mins runs out. I'm a graphic designer working in Washington, DC. Mostly I do interactive work unlike my other coworkers that do print. Working downtown only a block from the White House is interesting, stressful and annoying all at the same time. Constant terrorist threats, clueless tourists and an occasional crisis  (i.e. crazy man with tractor drives into pond and snarls traffic)  makes for a "unique experience".  &nbsp;  So what would possess anyone to write a blog? For me I thought it would be a good way to rant, suggest cool stuff to check out and document my thoughts and my life in DC  (and hopefully elsewhere soon..more on that later).

       :: Chaos ::  Well I haven't posted in awhile. Have you ever had one of those times where you put something off that you've meant to start months ago and then when you finally start it, you get really busy at work and in your personal life? That's been my week. And this week looks more of the same. I'm in the process of looking around for other job opportunities and now that I've started my new portfolio website it seems I'm hella busy at work all of a sudden. I guess I shouldn't complain since it is job security but what poor timing. I barely have time to go home, workout and go to bed nowadays. Hopefully after this week things will slow down.   :: Dating ::  On another front, my new friend that I was interested in says he's too much on the rebound from the ex to even think of dating right now. Oh well. Guess we'll just be friends. Thank god I have other friends to "play" with.   :: TV ::  I'm excited tonite! It's the finale of Joe Schmoe II. I know I'm probably the only one watching and enjoying this show but I swear it's funny as hell! Also checked out the final episode of The 4400 last nite but it was kind of a letdown. This is about all the TV I'll get to watch this week unfortunately. I'll let the trusty ReplayTV record The Amazing Race tomorrow. What would I do without technology? Probably working on my long overdue portfolio.
