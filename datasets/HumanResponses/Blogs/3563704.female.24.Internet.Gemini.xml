        hmmm... well, well, well. Today is Inauguration day of 'our center' and it just happened in a flash. But it was memorable. Why? Because due to a sudden twist of events, I had to be the master of the ceremony - the emcee, that is. It was an impulsive decision to take the part and it was worth it. There were tounge-twisting moments and reading bloopers but i believe they were barely noticeable. I did fine and I'm glad I took the opportunity to speak publicly (eventhough it was just a brief stint). Darn, it feels good!I feel like I'm born to do it. Hehe.  Yesterday was another euphoric day. I've heard from my oldest bestfriend through e-mail and i am so happy she wrote. Thanks a lot to friendster, I found her youngest sister who in turn informed her about me.She wouldn't have recognized me if not for my posted pictures in my profile. She said that she has been trying to contact me for ages but with no such luck. Nwez, she gave all her contact details and a brief account of what has happened to her through the years. She graduated, got her own store and a 2004 Mustang. Cool beans, huh? For someone my age, I guess she already accomplished a lot. I wonder if she already got married. I did ask her this question in my email to her so i'll just have to wait and see...  Reuniting with an old bal brings a sense of nostalgia. I just couldn't help but reminisce about old times and reflect about the present as well. Somehow, I tend to ponder and analyze my current situation with that of my friends (one of human's natures?)I start to question how I fared so far - in life, generally. Well, success is something difficult to quantify. I think success is relative, a state of mind, really. It is something that can't be measured by material wealth, forune or fame one has achieved but rather by the fulfillment one feels with the things that she/he does. Success for me is going to sleep at night thinking that it feels good to be alive and feeling lucky to be where and who I am today.  Well, there are symbols of status quo and I wouldn't be a hypocrite to admit that I would want some of these. But I wouldn't want to own some possessions which I think I don't deserve. I don't know but if one believes she/he is successful, everyone else follows - fulfillment, recognition, as well as the material rewards that go along with it.  Success - an abstract term defined as the 'progressive realization of one's pre-determined goals'. Or something to that effect.And it got me asking myself, what are really my goals? Do I have concrete ones? Hmmm...

         limbo. it's an area of uncertainty right? a certain space of floating and drifting to nothingness. Or maybe it's a transitional period - of reflecting and putting things into perspective before one proceed with a journey. It can also be a venue for resting, relaxing and unwinding or taking the time off from all the hustle and bustle of a very busy, complex and chaotic world. These and maybe the word means more. A lot more than I know.  limbo.limbo rock.why was it called that, nway? well,i guess this takes another mind-boggling self-brainstorming session.

          we don't need money to celebrate. yeah right! would anyone kindly tell me how to do that?  i would really appreciate the rationalization.  birthdays can sometimes be dreadful coz let's face it, we've got friends and they expect you to celebrate and they would love join the celebration. but when there's no means to celebrate, there's the dilemma. i mean, c'mon. how would one celebrate without spending? you need to have at least some food to share - and it's gonna cost for a group meal. sigh. money does make the world go round.and why do i have to be in this state in time for my upcoming birthday? my birthday could have been last month or in December. But i'm stuck with June when resources are scarce. talk about perfect timing...

        How do one start a blog anyway? I know that this is suppposed to be an online journal - a venue where I can record my thoughts, opinions, ideas, and the likes. Much like a regular diary, only this one can be published and viewed by everyone. So much for privacy, huh? Going back to my question... Where do I begin exactly?  Hmmm... It will almost come to the 24th year of my existence here on earth. I guess, I better take this as a take-off point.  Wow, time does fly! It'll be a few more days before I turn 24 and sadly, I don't think it's going to be a bashful birthday. Why? For the mere reason that I'm in the middle of a financial crisis lately and I can't afford to throw even a simple party. I know that a party is not the only way to celebrate another year that was. I guess, I could just focus on the Thanksgiving part.  I started associating Thanksgiving with my birthdays as soon as I realized what a blessed individual I am. So blessed that I felt the need to devote a day and be grateful. And what better day to offer all these thanks than on the day of each year which marks the end of meaningful years and the beginning of a hopeful one.  Yes, it will be a new start for me. Here's another opportunity for me to fulfill my goals and desires, to realize my hopes and dreams as well as to atone whatever mistakes and shortcomings I've done in the past. I never did think of birthdays as growing older, just getting wiser. I hope that's what I have been doing so far...  Advance birthday greetings to me.

           i'm here at work early as usual. i'm scheduled for such ungodly hours and i don't know if i'll last. it can be pretty alarming commuting from home. paranoia gets into me, specially with all those horrendous news i see on TV - of kidnapping, hold-upping, snatching, rape, you name it. Jeez, just thinking about these crimes give me the shivers.i really need to&nbsp;practice leaving&nbsp;for work earlier than what i have been doing. better safe than sorry.&nbsp;seems like the world is getting more and more dangerous to live in. or are we just more scared as we grow older?        &nbsp;    maturity comes with age, right? or is it with the amount of experiences and exposures that we get as time goes by? a friend gave me a little book from an Indian author which contained such profound statements. one of his passages said&nbsp;that our thoughts and experiences are not our own, and this got me thinking. when we think about it, from the time we were born, we have been sorrounded with a lot of different things as well as people. Thus, influenced by so many factors. We grew up around our parents or whoever raised us and our best way of learning is by mimicking them. It has been said that 5 years old is the time when all of the values that a parent wants to instill in his/her child, are already intact. after this period, a kid tends to be exposed to outside environment and explores a bigger world on his/her own.        &nbsp;    perhaps each person is unique. but we have to admit the fact that all of us have similar experiences, varied in some ways but still similar in nature. it's interesting to know that our lives are definitely intertwined and we are all connected to each other - whether we like it or not. what makes us special is the combination of experiences that we have and how we respond to these. this is what separates us from one another. we may encounter the same circumstances but we react differently. we rationalize in various manners depending on our biases and prejudices. we justify things based on our values.and these values that we acquire aren't actually ours. rather they are the product of who we were and who we becomes, eventually.fascinating.        &nbsp;    who would have thought that i'd be interested with philosophy - if one could consider my thoughts philosophies. it's funny how little we know of ourselves and realizing some things that define us. we barely notice it but other people define us. their thoughts, their words, their actions, their works help us better understand ourselves. they may talk to us directly or indirectly -&nbsp;through books, arts and other pieces of man's work which convey their thoughts, ideas and perspectives. communication is everywhere and it's just up to us which ones to pick up because these are the ones useful to us or what we think would be applicable to us. messages can be overwhelming and confusing at times that we tend to have a hard time segregating and organizing them to fit us. sometimes, out of confusion we get frustrated and lost. that's why we seek guidance to assist our dilemmas. that's why we need other people or anything that can keep our sanity intact. others hold on to a divine, supreme being for guidance. by believing that they exist for a reason and that their lives are part of a big plan is motivation enough to keep on going. and i believe this is a very effective way of leading one's life.        &nbsp;    sigh.i miss group discussions.intellectual masturbation, so to speak.ones that leave you still thinking even if the event has long been over. ones that create a huge impact on your values. ones that makes you doubt about your own belief system. ones that are so influential, they'll leave an unforgettable mark. i wonder when can i hear one again?

           newsflash! i'm inspired again. thanks to Josephine March of Little Women. i hope this lasts.           it's dawn again and we haven't been that productive. well, work-wise, that is. during the entire shift (although we're just halfway through the shift, i don't think there will still be calls coming in), i only received a single call. it was a good one considering that i made a sale, but not good enough 'coz i wasn't successful with any of the upsells. i must admit that i need polishing with my 'selling capabilities', most specifically my convincing power. one of my experienced (meaning well-adept with sales and has been to other call centers previously) teammates gave a lecture on coming up with effective rebuttals during calls and while he was sharing what he knows and what he learned, i realized that i still have a lot to practice. problem is, there isn't much opportunity right now. we only get to receive at most 3 calls (that is if one is lucky enough) during a shift and these calls are certainly not enough. oh well, i hope more calls would keep coming in the coming days. i can't wait to apply what i recently learned and improve myself. it's pretty addicting once you already experienced handling the live call. so far, i have only talked to 4 people and the first 1 hung up on me, the 2nd changed her mind because i placed her on hold for a considerably lobg time, and the last 2 ones bought just the base product (which is a set of knives, actually). frankly, i'm not yet used to persuading other people to buy something mainly because i'm a thrift shopper myself. i have always been a practical one and i believe that i don't have to acquire stuffs that i don't need. now, i'm in a business where i have to charm people into agreeing with me and spending some of their money into items that aren't really necessities. it's a tough act and i bet it would some time for me to master the 'art of  selling'.           come to think of it. being a salesperson is actually similar to being a lawyer wherein both have to prepare for rebuttals or arguments in order to succeed - either to sell a product or win a case. A salesperson needs to convince and explain to a prospective customer while a lawyer needs to convince and explain to a jury or a judge. The former  formulates rebuttals based on the merits of a certain product or service while the latter creates arguments based on the evidences of a particular case. And both profession requires a very effective oral communication skills. This is quite interesting.            One of my greatest dreams is to be a lawyer. this is primarily because of Ally McBeal. The show depicts an exciting courtroom drama and comedy that i couldn't help but wish to be a part of it. But i know now that being a lawyer is more that just intriguing cases, winning speeches and victorious parties with colleagues in a bar. The profession is much more complicated than these.     I do hope to deliver a winning speech someday and a victory party as well. For what specific reason, i have no idea.           another great dream of mine is to be an author. i have always been fond of reading and i deeply admire those who can wonderfully weave stories and tales which captures a lot of imagination. My huge respect goes to those writers who can fuel plenty of people's dreams and aspirations, who can create a spark with her/his readers, who can ignite the innermost longings and hopeful thoughts of many individuals. words are indeed very powerful. they can open hearts, release sorrow, arouse joy, give hope and inspiration. they can change lives.           truly, blessed are those who can create magic out of words. they hold great power.           ~~~           there are so much things to write about. from one's own experiences to accounts of others stories. from objects to human beings. from abstract to concrete ideas. but what makes a good writer?           i've read from a book that a composition with impeccable grammatical composition nor does an interesting piece filled with grammatical errors, doesn't guarantee a bestseller (meaning a good read for many). Then what does? Obviously, it has to have a balance of both. A good story not only requires appropriate grammatical style but an interesting tone as well. Most importantly, it must connect with the target reader. otherwise, the whole process of writing would be pointless.           so how do i do this exactly? well, first things first. who are my target readers and what do i want to tell them? what am i willing to share? hmmm...

         here i am again. living a new life. making changes. adjusting to new things. i guess, as we grow older, there tend to be more changes. life gets more fast-paced and we have less room to breathe. one moment we belong somewhere and doing something. the next thing we knew, we're in a different place, with different sets of people. old comfort zone has to be thrashed and new ones are developed. i wonder how long (or how short) will this last this time?  people. places. culture. at first, it's exciting to to explore and expand our horizon. but as we go further and we see more, we wonder what's in store for us. or whether there's really something splendid in store for us. dreams. goals. objectives. i'm sure everyone has these. each person believes that he/she has a purpose in life. every individual harbors some purpose during his existence. others may be confused. torn between what she/he can do with what she/he really wants to do. desires. ambitions. it's human nature to want something that doesn't belong to him or her. of course, why would you look for something if you already have it. common sense, right? but how do we distinguish what we need from what we want? 'coz what we want doesn't necessarily means that they're what we need. yes, it's a different thing and it's something that's so hard to figure out. we want something because we think we need it. how do we know that we really need it. can we decide for ourselves? can we justify what's right for us? does the decision lie solely on us?  the answers maybe coincids with our quest for happiness? but does it have to be one's own happiness only? wouldn't it be selfish that way? well, maybe depending on ones's definition of happiness. but then again, this should be another thought to ponder.

        it's fascinating how one's persona redeems itself. whoever said that 'first impression is lasting' is a closed-minded individual. i say that we should give every person a chance. of course, first impressions are there but we shouldn't make it last. we can assess one's personality according to how we see him/her at first but let's get to know the same peson better and i'm sure the impressions can change - be it for the better or otherwise.           why did i come to the above realization? well, i've been somewhat relieved when i heard one of our sups talk earlier today. she made a lot of sense, unlike the other two. at first, she struck me as someone who's irresponsible and unprofessional. but obviously, i was wrong. she actually provided good pointers earlier which made me realize that she knows a lot and she knows what we are doing. i guess, this is a silent apology for her. even though, she does not know (i hope) how i misjudged her, still i owe her this.    ~~

        jeez! i dunno what went wrong. i've been trying to access this account for a few days now and i couldn't. i'm sure i had the correct username and password but my account was blocked somehow. finally, i'm here again. maybe, someone took pity on me. maybe, i was just really doing the wrong thing. whichever the case, i'm just glad i can write again and not start from scratch. i kinda developed an attachment to this particular account already.  comfort zone. it's something so easy to acquire and yet very difficult to let go. a comfort zone can be developed in as short as a few minutes or as long as some years. nevertheless, we create something to hold on to. some habit we get used to and as days go by, it's something that is so hard to change.  so what have i been up to lately? thoughts. so much thoughts. things that occupy my mind these days range from deep to shallow to romantic to tragic and so on and so forth. maybe, i'll just lash them out in random.  a weird friend who pops up once in a while... a new job with nothing much at this time... an old friend who sent a mail with such deep impact... a traumatic dog-incident late one night... a contemplation of what has been, what is and what could be... an analysis of being in power... a vivid image of some sexual fantasies... a clear situation opportunity i've allowed to pass by... a lot of grieving thoughts on our country's sorry state... a depressing realization that i'm part of this state... keeping in touch with friends, old and new... catching up with someone whom i haven't heard from for sometime... status quo symbols.... the difference between wealth and poverty - access to resources... friendster and its advantages... books and how i love them... shopaholic - a friend and a book... money and why i badly need them right now... lovelife and what it constitutes... who am i right now?... where am i?... friends... casual sex... money... wealth... social life... spirituality... challenges... time... life... existence... chaos... complexities.

      just read an e-mail from an old friend and her words totally affected me. she's in the US right now and you could say that she's living the life. she has this great job and she's not modest enough to hide the fact that she's earning so much and that she can easily get what she wants, whenever she wants them. i dunno but somehow i can't help but think that i don't know her anymore. maybe, it's the fact that we're miles apart and it has been ages since i last saw her. but the distance is more than just physical.  she is a different person now. she has obviously embraced the american culture and she now thinks like a typical american girl. that is, with high regards of herself. i was kinda hurt with the way she looked down at Asians who can barely speak english, not minding that she is technically an Asian herself. she was so pissed off dealing with them that i wouldn't be surprised if she gets mad at me defending their position. it's scary how money and power can get into us. she even went as to belittling her country herself asking me of what's keeping me here when there is nothing for me to stay. well, true enough. there's poverty-driven problems around. but these are what keeps us tough and oh well, i guess it would be best if i just post her email and my response to it. I deleted some details which I think are unnecessary. Nwez, here goes...    HI! So sorry for not being able to reply back. I have been very busy with work lately. My staff is mainly consist of immature (yeah, and they're like what, between the ages of 18 and 30) and that means a lot of supervision. It's annoying sometimes but I have to deal with them because I am the store manager after all right? Even my right hand, which is my assistant manager, sometimes can't lead the floor. I constantly have to be there. It's like, I am put in that store to remind everyone of how things are supposed to be. I know that the old store manager didn't do a great job on them. She is so lenient and let you get away with things when I am totally the opposite. I am nice but if you push the wrong button, I can be a bitch. I think that most of us have our limits and mine is not that long. I am working on it though because I know that I have to do. I can't ran a business like that if my patience is short. And u know what tick me off the most, too, is the mall that I work at. My clientele is full of Asian, who for goodness sake barely know how to speak English. It's so damn annoying trying to do an action language to them because it makes me look stupid. How the hell do you get to United States without knowing a word in English? Isn't that pathetic? I might sound so mean and totally out of line here, but it's true though. How are they going to survive like that? Well, I guess I am grumpy right now. Sorry, what I think I'm doing is venting. It just gets upsetting sometimes, and it's not like you'll always have translator around or something like that.  Anyways, I've been good. Lots of happs (short for happenings) here and there. We just finished celebrating one of my nephews b-day. I got 2 more to celebrate this month. I'll try to send u pictures. Lately, I have been hating photo shoots though because I haven't gotten my tan yet and I look too white in picture. Plus my boyfriend is not photogenic at all, so that makes me like it least. On th 7th, I have to go on a trip with my boyfriend's family (his cousin is actually getting married and they are having the bachelorette and bachelor party) at Catalina Island. Heard of the place? I am not that excited to go but the trip has been paid for, and if I cancel, they will have to pay more. The only thing that I am looking forward of is the tanning part. It'll be nice and hot out there. I'll be toast by the time I come back. =)  I am thrilled too because on September, i am going to a Linkin Park concert. I have been to a bunch of their concerts and this one is supposed to be great because it has a collaboration of a bunch of different artists such as Snoop Dogg. I like them a lot and I can't wait. They're really good live. Chester, the lead singer, is awesome.  Now that I think about it, I wonder what my life would be like had me and my family stayed there. I wouldn't want to imagine what my lifestyle would be like though. I mean, no offense to you and to anyone else who's still living in our country, but let's be realistic. What else is still left for everyone there? When u get the opportunity to make it here, don't even think twice. U need to grab that and really try your hardest to make it here. The opportunity is not only here but everything else. I mean, we necessarily don't pick up golds or money on the street just like what most people think, but money is so much easier, yet quicker to be spent. For my age, I seriously make so much money, but because I have so much expenses, not to mention 8 credit cards that have been cut now, I barely see that money. I don't ask my parents for money at all, unless I am down to a penny in my bank. I pay for everything. I am so used to it. I have so much freedom to spend my money on whatever I want... yeah, my closet by the way is exploding. I love clotehs, and I love to shop! That's all I dis especially when I went to FIDM ( The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising) . When I am in a foul mood, my boyfriend would know to give me his credit card so I can shop. I shop so much that I get sick afterwards. It's like a disease... I know a lot of us females love to shop, but with my case, it's different. I have no control whatsoever. If I want it, I'll get. What size do u wear anyways? Every season, I do an inventory on my clothes and by the time I'm done, I will have 3 big bags that are all full of clothes. I usually give it to a charity, but lately, I have been giving it to my co-workers. Make it worth it. My boyfriend have suggested to put it up on e-bay to make money, but it's just an idea. We haven't really thought of it. Maybe later on. I wish that u're here so I can give it all to you. My sense of fashion though has been changing so quickly lately. It's more of a fad than fashion now. I wear clothes that make me stand out on the crowd, something original. I hate knock-offs... it's all about originality. I did my inventory recently and I just discovered that I have 60 belts and chains, 80 pairs of shoes, not even including flip flops, and about 70 pairs of jeans. Wow!!! But anyways, I got to go. I didn't realize that I have written this nonsense mail to u forever now, so I must stop. I'll try to catch up with u via e-mail. Sorry, will u e-mail me back ur address and phone #. I lost it. Ciao!!!     and here's my reply:      Whoa! You were venting all right. So much that i could almost hear your blood boiling all the way out here. Hope you have already managed to simmer down by now. =)  Well, you do have great responsibilities out there and i'm sure it can be trying at times. But just like you said, you are the manager and with the position comes a great deal of power. Use it to your advantage. However, be reminded of Peter Parker's words as well (or was it his grandmother's?) that "with great power comes greater responsibilities". ü I can totally relate to your encounter with Asians who can barely speak English. I had a call myself a few days ago with a Chinese customer and she was really having a hard time expressing herself. She even asked me if we had a Chinese agent around. Unfortunately, we don't so i just told her that she was doing a great job and that i could perfectly understand her. I could also hear her constantly discussing with her father, who was obviously with her in the room, in Chinese. Our conversation lasted for 40 minutes and i was supposed to have it in less than 10 minutes 'coz we have this standards to follow. But i decided that it was fine, it was just one call after all. Besides, it felt good to be of help to someone. My heart just goes out to these people. And i realized that we're lucky we're here in the Philippines 'coz english gets to be our second language. Compared to other Asian nations, we fare well in terms of communicationg globally. Thus, it's also easier for us to adapt anywhere. Have I ever told u that i tutored Koreans and Japanese before? They have to come all the way here because internationally, we are the 3rd best English-speaking country. And I guess, this is something to be proud of.  Yeah, you're very lucky you're there and I wouldn't be a hypocrite to deny the fact that I would love to be in the same shoes that you are right now, given the opportunity of course. Actually, I'm planning to get out of here one of these days. Hopefully, even somewhere in Europe. I dunno how i'm gonna do it though. It's just a plan. But you know what, it isn't that bad. I may not get everything that I want but I believe that have everything that I need. ü  Funny how you badly need that tan when tanned people out here go crazy over those whitening creams and stuffs to lighten their complexions. Human nature, huh? We just can't seem to be satisfied...  Feel free to send your inventory rejects if it wouldn't cost you that much trouble. I would love to have them over. =p Thanks for keeping in touch. Till next time. Keep calm! ;-)        ~author
