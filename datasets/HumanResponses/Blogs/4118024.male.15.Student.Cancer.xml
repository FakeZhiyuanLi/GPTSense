      Today was not a very interesting day in my life.    I did nothing at work except eat ramen and read Star magazine (My grandma loves Star and the National Enquirer, so they have many of them laying around the house. They make for interesting reading). We didn't get to work on Satan Car at all. I made a total of $8 today. We did have a little adventure today though... My cousin had to go to Houston to get a new fender for his truck, so we all piled up in my grandpa's new Dodge Ram and went to a used parts shop in a neighborhood that made me feel like I was in one of those goofy GTA: San Andreas screenshots. Well, he got the fender, and then we were half-way back to my grandparents' house when he discovered he didn't have his wallet. So we went all the way back to the parts shop, and his wallet was there with all the money intact and everything. We then all went back to town and I ate two cups of Chicken Picante Ramen.    I got an e-mail from Simon today. It's like the movie thing never happened. We're suddenly friends again. That's cool. He asked me to call our friend Bryce (who, off the subject, is the lead guitarist and singer of a band called the Unlikely Heroes) to find out where we are meeting on the first day of school in two days. I had actually called Bryce earlier, but this was before I got Simon's e-mail (I had been meaning to ask him anyways). All we did was talk about what we are doing tomorrow night (We still don't know, but we'll probably end up playing Halo or something).    Speaking of school, I finished my summer reading assignments today while watching the Resident Evil movie. We had to read through and put notes in the play Our Town and the novel A Seperate Peace. I put a lot of l33t speak and obscure anime and gamer refrences in A Seperate Peace, which is one of the most homoerotic books I've ever read. I take that back. It's the only homoerotic book I've ever read. Basically, you have a bunch of boys going to an all boys school. They frolic and stuff, and I would've thought nothing of it if the main character Gene hadn't said in one of his magnificent inner monolouges that another male character had a "healthy rump". Our Town was good though...    Well that was my blog for today. I'd write more, but InuYasha comes on in 30 minutes and I still have more stuff to do, like get a new screename.

      This is the second time I write this intro. I just accidently deleted the first one, right in the middle of a rant about how 2-D fighting games are better than 3-D ones. Anyways, my name is Rex III, and this is my blog. It's a very fine blog. Yeah...     Anyways, I'm a sophomore in high school. We're in the middle of summer vacation now, but we go back in 3 days. This blog was supposed to be about life at our school, and how f***ed up it is. I changed it though, because my life is much more interesting.    Here's what's happened in the past few days...  I was the main guy in a film studio called S3 Films, and I had been for a little over a year (I started the whole thing!), but I decided to abruptly leave when I got an e-mail from my best friend (not sure anymore) Simon, saying that I had been getting a swelled-head over the movie thing, that I thought I was proffesor Punk Rock (I am a very avid punk rock fan, favorite bands include Alkaline Trio and Bad Religion... no radio bands for me anymore, except I do like Yellowcard), and that my scriptwriting sucked, among other things. So I left, right when we were about to finish pre-production on The Quiz of Fighters '99: Neo Dream Match Millenium, a fighting game parody (in the King of Fighters universe) we were working on (I spent a long time doing that script). That movie, sadly, will probably get shafted after the whole studio restructures itself into making Jackass movies (something they've been wanting to do since forever, but I never let them because I consider it selling out), but Simon said they're going to probably make the Splatterhouse movie we just started planning about a week ago.    So basically, what happened today. I went to work. I am a mechanic. Today, I was told I was to change a compressor on a Honda car from the 80's, so I took it out, but then my grandpa (my employer), told me that the car had exhaust problems and that the compressor was in decent shape so I put it back in and began working on the Satan car. That car's been in and out of the shop since I first started working there 6 months ago. Not 2 months can go by before it shows up again. Every time it's been a compressor problem. I've put at least 3 compressors in that thing, and they still don't work, and every time I work on it I swear it's getting harder, or maybe Satan Car's just messing with my mind. No, I am 2 l33t 4 7h47. So I start working on it, and all of a sudden... BOOM!!! Coolant Explosion! Green crap goes everywhere! It was kinda cool. So, I took the compressor out (I had a few encounters with coolant before I finished though... Kids, remember to always use a vacuum to drain all Freon out of a compressor before you take it out!), and went home. Tomorrow I have to put a new compressor in (I give it a month before it comes back), and I have to put new brake pads on it. I hate Satan Car.    Well, that was my entry for today... Come back tomorrow, if Satan Car dosen't swallow my soul first!
