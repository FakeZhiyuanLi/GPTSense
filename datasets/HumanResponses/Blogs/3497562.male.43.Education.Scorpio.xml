      Human beings, including academics, journalists, and political commentators, are incredibly tribal animals.  Most individual political perspectives are strongly influenced by the tribalisms of the Left or Right.  I began studying economics as an idealistic Leftist.  As I became convinced of the power of economic arguments, I did not lose any of my idealism:  I just realized that Leftist strategies for improving the world were simply not very well considered.  At the same time, as I became more interested intellectually in economic analysis, I found that most of the perspectives that I studied included a certain "there ain't no free lunch" cynicism.  I have found it difficult, in relative isolation, for my thoughts not to be distorted either by the mindless idealism of the Left or by the intelligent cynicism of market advocates.  Flow is an attempt to create a community of intellectually sophisticated and intellectually honest idealists that can transcend the magnetic pull of these opposing forces.  Given the fact that "intellectual" was nearly synonmous with "Leftist" for much of the 20th century, it may seem odd or biased from a left-liberal perspective for me to claim that Leftist strategies for improving the world were not very well considered.  For those on the other side, the fact of 100 million Marxist murders alone is shocking and horrifying proof that Leftist strategies for improving the world were not very well considered.  Sociobiology provides compelling arguments that a sophisticated capacity for self-deception was genetically useful in the competition for genetic replication.  In order to be a realistic idealist, or a realistic visionary, one must take complete cognizance of the depth and pervasiveness of human self-interest and self-deception.    Young people, eager to believe themselves good, and eager to position themselves as morally superior to their elder tribesmen, are thus vulnerable to shallow idealisms.  Academics and intellectuals, many of whom spend their lives surrounded primarily by young people, often occupy a social status niche in which they maximize their psychic well-being, at the cost of intellectual integrity, by claiming moral superiority to the rest of society by means of their Leftist politics.  There are even sociologists who conduct formal research studies to determine what social and psychic pathologies cause conservative beliefs:  surely a healthy, sane, decent human being would share their Leftist political beliefs?    There is pressure from decent, well-intentioned left-liberals to leave the communist murders behind.  None of them advocated such murderous regimes and they consider arguments that they were somehow complicit in these murders to be spurious and in poor taste.  Spiritual and emotional maturity has to do with taking responsibility for one's actions.  When I was in college in the 1980s, communist enthusiasm among university faculty was common.  To a remarkable degree, it still is.  Noam Chomsky, the Pol Pot apologist, is still a hero among the Left.  In the eighteenth century, classical liberals developed a sophisticated body of political analysis showing the necessity and the means of limiting political authority.  The American founding institutionalized many of these insights.  The French Revolution served as horrifying proof of the need for such constraints on power.  After the 1790s, anyone who blithely talked about a "dictatorship of the proletariat," as did Marx and his followers, is complicit in murder.  Others, who endorse the ideas of such advocates of murder, are also complicit.  Che Guevara whole-heartedly endorsed mass murder.  Idealism has been discredited by the 100 million communist murders.  In order to create a legitimate idealism, we must purify ourselves by acknowledging wholeheartedly the crimes of idealisms of the past.  Until the fellow travellers and communist apologists come clean, the cause of idealism will be discredited as morally corrupt and suspect.    There was a specific intellectual failure:  well-educated people, who should have been adequately educated in classical liberal political theory, nonetheless were enthusiastic supporters of those who advocated a "dictatorship of the proletariat."  The fact that these nice intellectuals may have envisioned a benign, romantic, idealistic "dictatorship of the proletariat," with lots of comradely poetry and art, is no excuse.  Drunk drivers who kill people are often just nice kids out having fun while drinking a few beers in the car.  Good intentions do not absolve people of responsibility while driving drunk nor while intoxicated with political ideals.  When an alcoholic becomes committed to serious recovery through AA, one of their first duties is to apologize to every individual who may have been harmed by them while they were drinking.  This step of taking responsibility for past actions is rightly considered to be a crucial stage in healing, spiritual growth, and emotional maturity.  In order to create a spiritually clean idealism, it is crucial that the moral contamination of Leftist intellectuals has been fully acknowledged.  One cannot build on crumbled foundations.

      The purpose of Flow is to create a dialogue community that combines two contrary trends in existing social/political discourse:  1.  The progressive, humanist desire to make the world a better place by means of conscious effort.  2.  The increasing recognition that market solutions to social problems are more effective than are command-and-control government strategies.  Hitherto, for the most part, advocates of the first position have identified themselves as "Left" and they have pushed for government legislation to fight "capitalism."  For the most part those who have advocated the second position have identified themselves as "Right" and have been considered "conservative" rather than progressive.  As an inveterate do-gooder, I am constantly horrified that the Left continues to advocate policy measures that will increase poverty and human misery while failing to advocate measures that would significantly enhance human well-being.   I am an educator who has created public school programs and private and charter schools from scratch.  For me, school choice is not an academic issue.  Given adequate freedom from government control, I can create schools that are significantly more humane and intellectual than are standard government schools.  (Those interested in creating better private or charter schools should email me, socraticpractice@yahoo.com, and we can get to work immediately on designing a great school in your area).  It disgusts me that "progressive" advocates of public education continue to undermine the development of new and better ways to educate young people.  Advocates of social mobility, human potential, intellectual ability, independent thought, spiritual awareness, creativity and innovation, and most other valuable human traits need to band together to destroy our public school monopoly.  Microsoft has a smaller market share and less control than does the government school system.  Those who hate Microsoft's influence in the software industry should hate government schools ten times as much:  the stakes are much higher, the constraints on innovation are vastly larger, the extent of monopolistic control is incaluculably tighter.  Consider other sectors of the economy:  In the 1970s health food stores were tiny, hippy places that were only open occasionally and forced us to eat carob instead of chocolate.  If Safeway and Albertsons had had a government-enforced monopoly in the 1970s, Whole Foods and Wild Oats would not exist and Safeway and Albertsons would not carry health foods.  If Crown Books and Waldenbooks had had government protection at the time, then Barnes & Noble, Borders, and amazon.com would not exist.  If IBM and DEC had had government protection, the entire microcomputer industry, the consumer software industry, and the internet as we know it would not exist.  If Keds had been controlled by the government, there would be no Nike or Adidas.  And on and on.  As an innovative educator, my projects are constantly attacked and destroyed by the government education monopoly - endless specific anecdotes are available on request (Or request my manuscript  Whole Lives:  The Creation of Conscious Culture Through Educational Innovation .)  A few more conventional examples from the globalization issue:  1.  Global Trade:  Although certainly the WTO is no model of social justice, the fact that the WTO is imperfect is not a justification for fighting globalization.  Oxfam, hardly a right-wing organization, recognizes that increasing international trade is the _only_ way that global poverty will be reduced.  We can, and should, be concerned regarding the rules for international trade.  In particular, Oxfam cites the $1 billion per day in agricultural subsidies in the wealthy nations that greatly reduces income in poor nations.  Glaring injustices such as this are cause for pushing for  more freedom in global markets, not less.  The fact that Jose Bove, the French agricultural protectionist, is celebrated as a hero by the Left, strikes me as surreal.  2.  Immigration:  Increased immigration should be one of the top agenda items for Leftist do-gooders.  By means of remittences, education, contacts, and familiarity with first-world social and legal institutions and customs, immigration is probably the single most effective means of transferring wealth from the first world to the third world.  The $30 billion in remittances that U.S. immigrants sent home last year is a very small fraction of the total value of these cross-cultural exchanges.  The creation of a thriving software industry in India is due to the know-how and contacts that Indian software engineers and entrepreneurs acquired in Silicon Valley and then transferred back home in hundreds of ways, formal and informal.  Those who are concerned about global population growth should note that immigrant families who move to the first world typically have much smaller families than they did in their home countries.    3.  Out-sourcing:  Why should a U.S. software engineer make $80 an hour if an Indian software engineer will do similar work for $5 an hour?  The wealthy industrialized nations provide relatively high incomes for their citizens in part by excluding competition from the billions of needier human beings on earth.  Do-gooders should celebrate the transfer of jobs to the third world.  4.  Economic Freedom:  The Economic Freedom of the World index, published by the Fraser Institute, rates countries around the world on their economic freedoms, including trade issues, but also banking laws, the free flow of capital, etc.  There is a high correlation between those nations highly ranked on this index and most of the those features of society desired by the Left:  health, education, welfare of the poor, etc.  Finland, often regarded as a "socialist" paradise, is the top-ranked nation outside the Anglo-American leaders (including former British colonies Singapore and Hong Kong as Anglo-American).  In general, Scandinavian "socialist" nations might better be described as wisely capitalist nations with extensive social welfare benefits.  They tend to have low corporate tax rates and significant freedoms with respect to the flow of capital.  Leftist rhetoric, if followed, would destroy Scandivian "socialism."  Leftist rhetoric, as followed, creates poverty in the third world.  If third-world nations allowed their citizens the same economic freedoms as Finland, they would all experience a dramatic increase in their standard of living.  It trouble me that most advocates of markets do not adequately advocate for the amelioration of social problems and for the reduction of injustices in global markets.  At the same time, Leftist attacks on market mechanisms cause much greater poverty and injustice than do the greediest capitalists on earth.  We need to develop a coalition of individuals and organizations who seek to improve the world and who recognize that, often, market mechanisms are the best means of doing so.

      A concern that many people have about market mechanisms is the fear that, given the opportunity, people will choose poorly and make themselves miserable rather than happy and well.  In addition observers often note that an increase in income does not necessarily lead to an increase in happiness or wisdom.  Finally, there is a common perception that market activities focus human attention on short-term stimulations rather than on sources of long-term well-being.  For those people who care most about human happiness and well-being, these three facts often convince them that an increase in market activity will result in an increase in human misery rather than an increase in human happiness and well-being.  I used to share these concerns myself.  I certainly care more about human happiness and well-being than I do about markets.  The most succinct understanding of markets is that they are a source of creative destruction.  It is undeniable that "the system of natural liberty," in Adam Smith's language, results in rapid change.  Communities are destroyed, traditional ways of life are destroyed, small farmers and store owners find they can no longer make a living in the old ways.  Again, many find the destruction so painful that they are hostile to markets.  There are two parts of creative destruction:  creation and destruction.  The destruction aspect is clear.  Creation is obvious in most technological areas:  machinery, electronics, aircraft, materials science, medical technology, drugs and medications, etc.  Creation is also obvious in entertainment:  television, movies, videos, computer games, gambling, pornography, nightclubs, resorts, cruise lines, theme parks, etc. all flourish in a market economy.  The area in which market creation is least obvious is in areas specifically addressing long-term happiness and well-being.  It does appear as if markets specialize in short-term stimulations.  This appearance, however, is misleading.  After fifteen years of in-the-trenches experience in education, I have finally realized that the reason that markets do, in fact, specialize in short-term stimulations is because markets in long-term well-being are illegal.  We need to legalize markets in well-being.  I exaggerate somewhat.  For many people, churches provide an important source of happiness and well-being.  I am not one of those.  I have found a market in well-being through teachers and practitioners of tai chi, meditation, energy therapy, cranio-sacral therapy, bodywork, men's groups, musical groups, alternative educators, outdoors groups, etc.  Indeed, I realize that there are thousands of practitioners of wonderful, healthy, exciting, innovative ways of living who are eager to share their expertise.  In addition, health food stores such as Whole Foods are flourishing; healthy restaurants are springing up everywhere; bookstores are larger and more diverse than ever; fitness and health clubs are ubiquitous; and people are hanging out at coffee shops instead of bars.  How can I claim that we need to legalize markets in well-being?  Because I am certain that all of these positive trends would grow considerably faster and have a much deeper social impact if markets in education and health care were liberated.  I have spent the past fifteen years creating schools that teach happiness and well-being.  The obstacles against doing so are enormous.  Public schools teach misery and meaninglessness (This is the real message of the Columbine massacre).  We need to free parents and educators to create schools at which young people can develop healthy habits and positive attitudes.  I pay property taxes to supports schools to which I would never send my own children because they would be trained in cruelty and bad habits there.  Meanwhile the healthy schools that I create can barely survive financially because all parents are forced to subsidize the cruelty factories known as public schools.  Nearly 100% of my health care costs for my family are alternative health costs that are not covered by insurance.  Meanwhile I pay $6,000 per year for insurance that, while useful in the case of catastrophic illness, I never use.  Two-thirds the cost of health care in the U.S. goes to pay for chronic illness most of which can be avoided by lifestyle choices.  While paying $2000 per year to alternative health providers that I can't afford (and I would like to spend an additional $2000 per year on alternative health), I am paying $4,000 per year to pay for the costs of people who eat poorly, don't exercise, smoke, drink, etc.  Because I can't spend the money on taking care of myself that I would like, I live less well than I know that I should.  When I receive bodywork I am less likely to eat poorly and drink alcohol.  I live in a world in which bad habits pay and good habits are penalized.  My personal experiences with respect to education and health care are tiny vignettes that illustrate a profound truth about our society:  by maintaining government control over health care and education, we have created a world in which there is a thriving market in short-stimulations but one in which long-term happiness and well-being suffers.  Surprising though it may be, the best solution to the market's current focus on short-term stimulation is to liberate education, health care, and community creation.  Future posts will show in greater detail how we can thereby create thriving markets in happiness and well-being.

      It is often true that politics is war by other means.  And just as war is a costly waste, so too are combative political battles.  At a time in which our nation is so polarized politically, it may be difficult to imagine a reduction in the scale of conflict.  But it is worth imagining a path to less conflict simply because we would all benefit from a reduction of conflict.  There are three primary sources of political conflict:  1.  International policy 2.  Economic policy 3.  Moral/cultural issues  I will sketch a path to peace on each of these issues.  1.  International policy:  Although the war in Iraq is a source of great political passion, it is not clear to me that there is as much disagreement regarding international policy as there appears to be.  There was a fairly broad consensus in favor of weapons inspections supported by the threat of force.  There is a fairly broad consensus in favor of getting the U.S. out of Iraq sooner rather than later (whatever the wisdom of this).  As the world gradually becomes more fully integrated economically, global conflict will decrease.  The Millennium Challenge is a great improvement in foreign aid strategy.  In the absence of additional unilateral military action by the U.S., there is reason to believe that in the decades to come international policy will be less a source of violent political conflict than it is today.  2.  Economic policy:  A broad consensus in favor of the reduction of government would benefit most people in the long run.  This consensus does not yet exist.  But it has been gaining in momentum for several decades now.  Although there is a constituency in favor of greater government involvement in health care, with the exception of the health care issue almost no one wants "more government" anymore.  As intelligent market solutions for health care are developed, it should be possible to create broad support for market solutions to social problems that would allow us to reduce the scale of government.  We need to de-politicize these issues so that large gains are available for everyone.  With attainable levels of economic growth, average American incomes could rise dramatically within our lifetimes.  By allowing more immigrants into the U.S., we can contribute more to the alleviation of global poverty than any group of humans in history.  By means of eliminating the tragedy of the commons, we can combine high rates of economic growth with a constantly improving environment.  3.  Moral/cultural issues:  At present, both sides are engaged in an all-out culture war.  Yet our society has powerful tradition of cultural pluralism and tolerance for other cultures.  Why not apply our tradition of cultural tolerance to our internal cultural battles?  If some cultures do not want homosexual marriage, let them refuse to acknowledge it.  If other cultures want homosexual marriage, allow them to acknowledge it.  While this solution sounds simple enough, in practice it would mean very dramatic changes in our cultural identity and in our legal structure.  Instead of one national cultural identity, it would mean allowing for radical pluralism of culture.  In order to support a radically pluralistic culture, distinctive cultures we need to be able to enforce policies (no abortion or yes homosexual marriage) within their own communities.  Vermont and Georgia, perhaps, would need to be allowed to be even more different culturally and legally than they are today.  Perhaps the cultural/legal entities would not be states; perhaps they would not even be geographically contiguous.  With both the economic and moral/cultural issues a "live and let live" philosophy could allow for dramatic gains in happiness and well-being for most Americans.  Both the Right and the Left would have to give up their desire to force other people to be like them or to support financially certain goals.  People would have to let other human beings voluntarily choose their cultures and the goals that they wanted to support.  We would have to let other people be themselves in whatever way they pleased.  We would have to become more peaceful and tolerant.  Does this sound so hopelessly utopian?

      I began my career in education fifteen years ago.  I wanted to improve the world by means of education.  I believed that it was important to train young people to think independently.  I began leading Socratic Seminars in public schools, open-ended discussions of texts bound by the constraints of evidence and reasoning.  Students were free to have whatever opinions they pleased, as long as they could defend those opinions cogently.  I discovered that there were some students in some communities who could do this well and many other students in other communities who could not.  In order to have a coherent intellectual discussion, it turned out that there were three pre-requisites:  1.  The ability to read critically. 2.  The ability to participate constructively in a group. 3.  An inclination to take ideas seriously.  If any of these three pre-requisites were missing, the discussions were weak.  Without the ability to read critically, the discussion could not really use a text productively.  Without the ability to participate civilly, discussions turned into a chaotic mess of insults, domination, and irrelevance.  Without an inclination to take ideas seriously, the discussions became flat and meaningless.  My colleagues and I then developed an approach to train students in these pre-requisites.  It required daily discussions, at least an hour per day.  Sometimes the discussions focused primarily on reading techniques, sometimes they focused on group dynamics, and sometimes they focused on why ideas should be taken seriously.  Some conversations combined all three pre-requisites.    Leading these discussions was an interesting, engaging, sophisticated art.  But after a solid year of such Socratic Practice, as I called it, even inner-city students were able to read much better and engage constructively in intellectual discussions.  They felt liberated, they enjoyed the conversations (students love to talk), and they learned crucial teamwork skills for the real world.  SAT-Verbal score gains at some sites have been double or even triple the national average.  Given the need to provide students with a better education, one might have thought that such a pedagogy would flourish.  Instead, it is practically illegal to engage in this pedagogy.    The well-intentioned national standards movement, codified by No Child Left Behind (NCLB), puts pressures on teachers to "cover" specific standards in each discipline.  While daily conversations that raise SAT-verbal scores and provide useful workplace skills may be intrinsically valuable, they prevent teachers from covering state-required content.  While intellectual argumentation was the core educational experience in ancient Greece, in medieval universities (which educated 12 year-olds), aristocratic education throughout Europe, Jesuit education, Jewish education, and the best prep schools in the U.S., extensive use of this core experience of western civilization is practically illegal today.  In addition to the "standards" obstacle, there is the teacher obstacle.  I have never had any difficulty finding interesting, intellectually capable adults who are eager to lead these conversations with students.  Unfortunately, most of these adults are not credentialed teachers - and most credentialed teachers are not capable of leading sophisticated intellectual dialogue.  Again, NCLB forces public and charter schools to hire "highly qualified teachers," which simply means teachers licensed in their discipline.  This does not mean that they are capable of leading intellectual discussions.  I attended St. John's College, where all professors are required to teach all disciplines:  The Greek Ph.D. must also learn to teach Newton's calculus, Racine's French, Bach's fugues, etc.  Almost everyone in our society would regard this as horribly inappropriate:  Why allow people to teach outside their range of competence?  What happens at St. John's, and at secondary schools that have used this same model, is that the people who are willing to do this (and there are long waiting lists to teach at these institutions) are people who love to learn, who have a passion for learning - in every discipline and in every way.  These are the kind of people that I want teaching my kids.  My ideal vision of education would train young people to be extraordinary autodidacts.  It has been suggested that the ideal St. John's foreign language exam would be one in which you don't know what language you will be tested in:  Perhaps Swahili, or Mandarin, or Polish, or something else.  You show up for the exam, are presented with a passage in the language to be translated, and you are provided with a dictionary and a grammar.  And you figure it out.  The same type of exam could be extended to science:  You are provided with a technical paper in physics, or chemistry, or biology, or something else.  You are also provided with suitable technical materials that will enable you to figure it out.  And you figure it out.  Or perhaps the exam is a sophisticated software package still in its box.  You are required to install the software and figure out well enough to accomplish a specified task.  It is possible to become a more capable, more independent learner.  It is possible to train young people so that they can learn on their own.  In my view, such an education would be vastly more valuable than the education that students currently receive.  But in any publicly-funded school, it is illegal to provide students with this type of education.

      I continue to be fascinated with the Scientific Revolution in general and with the transition from the medieval cosmological world-view to the Newtonian cosmological world-view, in particular.  So much had to change in men's minds in order for this transformation to be achieved.  There were medieval human beings who looked up into the sky and saw small fires in crystalline spheres.  Three hundred years later, Newton could look at the very same sky and see earth-like planets and sun-like stars moving in accordance with the same mechanical laws of physics that he observed on earth.  No one scientist, no one piece of evidence, no one argument was adequate to complete this transformation.  Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, and Newton were all crucial to this transformation of vision, as were dozens of lesser-known figures.  Each saw just a bit farther.  Many entered blind alleys.  Finally, the old medieval way of seeing the heavens was no longer possible.  The transition from terracentric to heliocentric astronomy played a significant role in this transformation.  It is important to remember that one of the clearest, most certain, most pervasively observed, and most indubitable of all physical phenomena is that the earth is stationary and the sun moves.  This is perfectly obvious to all who open their eyes.  One of the achievements of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton was to take one of the most obvious and certain of observations and show, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that it was false.  We, who have been trained since elementary school in the heliocentric hypothesis, can no longer even imagine how outrageous and absurd it is.  Our most basic intuitions should shout out to us:  The earth does not move, the sun does.  There are many observers of social and economic life for whom the harms of capitalism are so self-evident, it seems certain that no one in good faith could conceded to such a harmful system.  Although such people are now fewer and less vocal than they were 20 years ago, many still exist.  The popularity of Michael Moore testifies, in part, to the ongoing vitality of this view of the world.  Such people seem to believe that if they "expose" the system, if they shout loud enough and long enough, eventually people will wake up, lose their false consciousness, and revolt.  Having once viewed the world in this manner, and having now completed a shift in perspective, I view such people now, sympathetically, as I would a terracentrist around 1680 or so.  The terracentrist finds the heliocentrist doctrine to be a gross violation of his most fundamental and most certain beliefs.  The empirical proof that the sun moves and the earth does not is utterly obvious.  The frustration and outrage at someone who calls black white, and white black, is extreme.  To someone who has visualized the new paradigm, the frustration experienced by someone on the other side is understandable.  Yet the "proof" offered is utterly ineffectual.  Someone could point to a stationary horizon and a setting sun as much as he pleased, shout about it as much as he pleased, and you or I, or Galileo or Newton, would not find our heliocentric beliefs altered one iota.  The evidence presented is simply not addressing the key issues.  Likewise, while I certainly want to help the poor and the unemployed, and to prevent government corruption, when someone becomes animated about these problems and then concludes that capitalism is the problem, I view them much as one would a terracentrist.  With compassion, I wonder how I can explain to them that they are not seeing the world as it really is.  My efforts at explaining this paradigm shift in a compassionate way are not helped by the history of political enmity between the Right and the Left.  The newer intellectual understanding has been undermined by violent political antagonisms.  In order to see the world anew, people need to forget the language of capitalism, communism, and socialism.  They need to learn the ideas, if not the language, of "catallaxy" and "spontaneous order."    We need to de-politicize these concepts so that more people can understand them.  I seek to show how an authentic idealism is not only possible, but will be far more effective, with an ever-deepening understanding of Hayekian spontaneous order than without.

      The ultimate result of shielding men from the effects of folly, is to fill the world with fools.   -Herbert Spencer  Although some may take Spencer's quotation above as a witticism, it strikes me as one of the most succinct analyses of social life of which I'm aware.  There is some software being produced by means of evolutionary processes.  Instead of programming the software, line by line, as is done in traditional programming, a programmer will create a specified environment and specified outcomes and then write a very simple program that constantly creates new, mutating versions of itself.  It turns out that there are some software problems which are extremely difficult to solve by means of deliberate human design but for which evolved software solutions may be created quickly and easily.  Such evolved software results in computer code that is an absolutely incomprehensible mess; it would be very difficult to figure out the resulting "logic."  But as long as the resulting software performs well, it doesn't matter how messy it is on the inside.  Clearly, in order to obtain software that functions, it is necessary to specify conditions accurately.  Software that evolved in a false environment would not function correctly in a real environment.  It would be stupid to evolve software for which there was not hope of it functioning correctly in a real environment.  Although some may find the analogy offensive, there is a serious, non-trivial analogy between evolved software and human behavior.  I am not talking about biological evolution here at all:  I am strictly referring to the process by means of which young human beings acquire skills, habits, and attitudes which they will later depend on as adults.  Many humans in our society have evolved skills, habits, and attitudes which are not optimized for the real world in which they live.  Current welfare and education policy seemed design to create human beings who cannot function successfully as adults.  It would be comic if it were not so brutally horrifying.  It must be admitted that, with respect to human behavior, we are largely clueless about cause and effect.  Although there are large numbers of social scientists, therapists, social workers, public policy analysts, and others who make their living telling us about cause and effect in human behavior, enormous social problems continue.  Crime, poverty, addictions, high-risk behaviors, etc. have in no sense been definitively solved by the professionals who study these issues for a living.  At present academics debate the causes of dysfunctional behaviors; then without any resolution to the debate, other people design "solutions" to the problems based on the theories of a particular group of academics; then a politician or private funder backs one of these approaches for awhile.  Later, when the problem hasn't been solved, then some other group receives public support and funding.  And, meanwhile, by some measures our social life improves and by some measures it worsens.  With fewer constraints on our lives, some of us will do extraordinarily foolish things.  Some will die by means of foolish choices.  Some will allow their children to die, in ways that could have been prevented by experts, because of foolish choices.  But allowing us greater latitude in the choices that we make will also allow us to discover new and better ways to live, individually and collectively.  From the perspective of most societies, our culture's unwillingness to impose censorship is seen as unbelievable stupid.  But, as a society, we have committed ourselves to freedom of thought.  Freedom of action is the next necessary step.  All the advantages of freedom of thought, in terms of allowing a discovery process that can result in new and better ideas, applies 100-fold to freedom of action.  For precisely the same reasons, freedom of action will result in new and better ways of living.    The cost of new and better ways of thinking is that foolish ideas and degrading images are pervasive.  The cost of those new and better ways of living is that fools will harm their lives and the lives of their children.    But I’m convinced that freedom of thought is worth the cost.  And that freedom of action is worth the cost as well.  As Alan McConnell quips, "If it can't be abused, its not freedom."

      “The Master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is always doing both.”   			Zen Buddhist Text  The quotation above is an excellent statement of one of my ideals as an educator.  In addition to mastering the art of living as described above, I would want my students to be complete autodidacts:  Capable of learning anything on their own by the time they are 18.  They should be polite and respectful, independent and creative.  I believe that most young human beings can be educated in such a way that most young people, even those from the poorest families, could develop abilities that are superior to those of our most capable adults today.  As an educator with 15 years experience in innovative education, I am certain that our existing efforts at education are analogous to medicine circa 1500:  Primitive.  How could such gains be possible?    To begin with, when I hire teachers, I look for three things:  Do they love young people?  Can they set boundaries with young people?  Are they truly masters in their area of expertise?  If I were allowed to select students, there would be one criterion:  Is this person ready to commit him or herself whole-heartedly, heart and soul, to excellence in the chosen course of study?  Then, in a large, diverse market of seekers of excellence, an innovative dynamic among truly committed expert and novice learners would develop, capital would rush in to support research and development, and new ways of learning would be developed that are strictly unimaginable today.  As the learning process began offering real results, more people would commit their lives to excellence in the various learning paths being offered.  Note immediately that, despite massive spending on education and participation in education that the description of teachers and students stated above describes less than .0001% of our existing teacher - student interactions.  One would have to conduct a very careful search to discover any such interactions in today's world.  Perhaps a music student here and a martial arts student there have relationships with teachers similar to that described above.  Such simple and obvious pre-requisites to excellence in education are almost non-existent in today's world.  Suppose that a ruler once read a beautiful love story, in which two hearts' longing for each other was at last blissfully relieved when they found each other, consummated their love, and lived happily ever after.    Then suppose, having read this love story, and thus concluding that love was a good thing, this ruler forced everyone in his land to marry immediately.  In order to ensure that marriages happened, police would enforce the law.  Experts in marriage, who had received licenses from universities in their expertise, trained each participant using a state-approved textbook on marital happiness.  Then people were forced together and required to use the "research-driven" techniques for "marital happiness."  Worse yet, the "marital happiness" manuals continually emphasized the importance of "love."  Individuals were trained in "love" and certified in "love" based on the scores they received on tests.  The tests, of course, were based on "research."  People would come to loathe love and marriage.  Young people, forced into their "marital happiness" courses, would hate the courses and rebel.  While there would be earnest professors doing their best to write good books on "marital happiness," many people would realize that the whole system was a joke.  Or, in terms of last Friday's post, it was all crap.  This is precisely where our education system is.  Education should be based on love and a commitment to excellence, a longing for the true, the good, and the beautiful.  Education should not be a forced marriage supervised by government-licensed experts.  Former communist nations are going through a long, painful process of re-creating the most basic human virtues and civic institutions.  If we dismantled our education system, we would have to go through a similar long, painful process of re-creating healthy educational relationships.  But it is important to realize that we cannot get to a better place by continuing in our present direction.    No Child Left Behind is a Kafka-esque extension of the insanity of our existing education system.  The nightmare would be that, after it fails, the response is to increase control more, with more specified curriculum and more tests and more dishonesty about what is really happening to the hearts and souls of our young.  I await a time when the Berlin wall of government-controlled schooling is finally shattered, and we can begin to share the art of living with millions of young people in honest, straightforward, real relationships.    A new era of human happiness will begin at that point in time.

      One of my favorite parables is Flatland, in which a two dimensional-being who learns of the third dimension is ostracized and made to feel as if he is crazy for speaking of a third dimension.  It is a helpful reminder of the limits to our vision, and how those who see only two dimensions will consider someone who sees three to be insane.  Most intelligent, responsible, educated people more or less believe in our existing social and political arrangements.  They believe that there are smart people at Harvard and Stanford and elsewhere who study these things and that the latest, cutting-edge theories for how to improve society are well represented by the academic leaders.  They may know personally a top clinician at Johns Hopkins, or a great teacher in Evanston, or they may follow the latest ideas in Harper's or The New Yorker.    There may be a general sense that conservative Neanderthals are harming the country, embarrassing us internationally by foreign aggression and dishonesty, undermining us domestically through crony capitalism, destroying the environment, and pandering to the religious right.  The hope remains, among the educated elites, that once John Kerry (or Hilary Clinton) has been elected, and Democrats once again control Congress, that the top clinicians at Johns Hopkins and the great teachers in Evanston can continue their intelligent, responsible approaches to solving social problems.  Because I want to be liked, I would very much like to be able to believe in the good NPR Democrat vision of the world.  I feel no affinity for Bush Republicanism; given that I'm not for Bush, my life would be so much easier if I were for "the good guys," the Democrats, the intellectuals, the professional classes.  Worse yet, the notion that "there is too much regulation" or that we should "eliminate credentials and licenses" sounds, frankly, whacko to most people, including the most respected and responsible voices in our society.  It would be very helpful to me if I were capable of believing in the existing system.  But no matter how hard I try, I can't believe in the social and political world that has been created.  I feel very much like the poor Flatlander who has been exposed to the third dimension:  Yes, it seems crazy to believe in a third dimension, and yes, it is difficult to explain the third dimension to people who have only experienced two dimensions.  Nonetheless, those facts do not change my belief in the third dimension.  At bottom, the problem is pervasive crap.  Yes, I know we are supposed to respect those people at Harvard and Johns Hopkins who believe in the crap.  I just can't.  In the former Soviet Union, the joke used to be "we pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us."    In education today, for a large percentage of high school students, a similar joke could be made, "we pretend to learn, and they pretend to teach us."  This is crap.  Bill Cosby's recent remarks on the African-American underclass were a refreshing break from crap.  I hate the mean-spiritedness of Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter.  But the reason that they have such large and enthusiastic audiences is because, despite the fact that sometimes they make ridiculous exaggerations and rude or mean-spirited remarks, on many key issues they cut through the crap.  The politically correct, overly sensitive, self-imposed world-view of universities today has led many of the respected voices in academia mostly to speak in terms of crap.  If decent, conscientious human beings like Bill Cosby won't be honest (and thank heaven that he chose to be honest), then demagogues like Limbaugh and Coulter will be.  In order to make the world a better place, people need to be more direct with each other and we need a culture that supports greater honesty.  Lazy, rude, incompetent people are not going to get good jobs and should not get good jobs.  People with terrible habits with respect to eating, exercise, substance abuse, and choices of sexual encounters are not going to have good health and we shouldn't spend inordinate amounts of money compensating for their self-destructiveness.  Young people who ridicule learning, who don't respect teachers, who don't study or pay attention in classes, are not going to get an education and shouldn't be allowed to destroy education for others.  Young people love honor and courage.  The medieval splendor of "The Lord of the Rings" is appealing to them.  They love brave, audacious heroes, people who are not afraid to "tell it like it is."  Thus Eminem is widely respected by the young. Although young people would love to admire an Aragon, leader of men in Lord of the Rings, if they can't have an Aragon they would rather have a freakish-but-honest Howard Stern than a full-of-crap Jesse Jackson.  We have created a world that is substantially dishonest.  Young people escape into drugs, sex, fantasy, music, and violence instead of striving for excellence with respect to health, education, honor, and idealism.  Not all young people, of course.  The children of the elites are most likely to go to good private or suburban public schools, where, with the advantages of a lifetime of parental attention and private lessons, they are more likely to excel in athletics, academics, and a social life the entry to which requires costly cars and clothes.  These winners within the system, the children of the professors, diplomats, doctors, and lawyers, seem to validate the system as a whole to the elites.  If only Bush would give the poor more money, then everyone could succeed the way that my child succeeds!    Bill Cosby took a great personal risk by being honest.  The establishment rewards conformism to the mainstream message and penalizes those who do not conform to the message.  Cosby violated the accepted boundaries of decent political discourse.  It is a testimony to his personal credibility and undisputed decency that he was able to do so.  There will nonetheless be a backlash against him for having done so.  We have very few opinion leaders in any fields that are willing to be honest.  The best way to mute the Limbaughs and Coulters is not to launch a Left-liberal radio station with Al Franken – unless Franken is ready to cut through the crap on the Left as seriously as he is willing to cut through the crap on the Right.  The best way to mute the Limbaughs and Coulters is for more national opinion leaders to have the courage of Cosby.  Be honest, be real, and then we can begin to solve our problems.

      I recently ran across a survey that claimed that 80% of college graduates want work that is "meaningful" when they graduate.  As a school administrator, I frequently receive resumes from people in their 40s and 50s who have "retired" from the worlds of business, law, technology, or banking and now want to have a second, more meaningful, career.  As incomes continue to rise, an increasing percentage of our population will have the option of spending an increasing percentage of their work career engaged in employment for which meaning, rather than pecuniary gain, is the primary rationale for their choice of work.  Often college graduates are attracted to "activism" as a meaningful career.  Although there is certainly a role for activism, often activism treats symptoms rather than causes.  The ultimate cause of poverty is that people don't have adequate marketable skills and sufficiently professional job habits.  Until and unless poor people develop the marketable skills and professional job habits required, they will remain poor.  The position of office manager in a school is key:  The person who runs the office ensures that all the systems runs smoothly, that parents get the information that they want, that teachers are properly supported, etc.  In Palo Alto during the dot com boom, our school couldn't find an adequate office manager for $40,000.  Tech companies were paying similar people $50-80K and we couldn't offer a similar salary.  This position does not need a college degree, or even a high school diploma.  A person simply needs to be smart, organized, responsible, and with good people skills.  "Training" programs do not supply these pre-requisites.  Basic computer knowledge is also useful, but basic computer knowledge can be taught very quickly to the right person.    While I love education,  most education is a ridiculous waste of time.  If someone simply wants to earn a living, were it not for government-mandated credentials, there would be numerous career paths for bright people with (or without) a high school diploma.  Often sales people earn more than $50K, in many cases over $100K.  These positions require no education:  just excellent persuasion skills and verbal style that matches the social class to which one is selling.  Rather than a worthless high school diploma and a worthless four year degree, bright young people could be taught to speak in a particular manner and make great incomes selling.  At no point in our education system is this option recognized.  One of the marvelously democratic aspects of the early tech boom is that no credentials were required.  As a consequence, many high school and college drop outs became programming professionals.  The last tech expert that I hired was a high school drop out who had been making more than 100K working for Sun Microsystems.  What if activists, instead of fighting zero-sum battles on behalf of the poor, fought battles that resulted in endless opportunities?  Credentialism limits access to, and increases the cost of, education and health care.  Yes, activists can fight to obtain more funding for education and health care for the poor.  They may or may not win.  If they win, they may deepen resentment from other taxpayers.  They will not have made much of a difference in terms of why the poor are poor.  And because they will not have resolved the root causes of poverty, they will feel a need to keep fighting.  War is costly, and so are political battles.  The idealism that motivates activists could be re-directed towards creating a society based on creation rather than conflict.  What if we were to create lower cost, and ultimately much higher quality, health care options by means of eliminating most (or all) government regulations concerning health care?  What if we were to create lower cost, and ultimately much higher quality, education options by means of elimination most (or all) government regulations concerning education?  The same applies to housing and community creation.  Looked at from this perspective, a horrifying conspiracy exists to keep education and health care expensive, hard to obtain, and not appropriately designed for the needs of the people.  This conspiracy is led by some of the nicest, most conscientious people, including professors at our best universities.  Nonetheless, the result is the same:  limit quality and access, and raise cost, for those things that are most important to human well-being.  If it were legal to do so, and if there were visionary entrepreneurs who helped to make it happen, the millions of young people who long for meaningful careers, the millions of older people who are ready to retire into meaningful careers, could flood into the fields of health, education, housing, and community and reduce poverty more than any government program possibly can.  "Let us do it" is the true meaning of "laissez-faire."  We want to do it, we can afford to do it.  We need visionary leaders and we need freedom.  Given these pre-requisites creative idealists can begin to improve life for rich and poor alike.

      Most readers, on both the Left and Right, are likely to be shocked that I could be outraged by the fact of regulation.  The need for government regulation seems to be profoundly and widely accepted across the political spectrum.  A suggestion that there be less regulation seems to signal a failure, on my part, to take certain issues seriously.  What such a perspective fails to understand is that there are legitimate alternative to regulation and that a strong case may be made that those alternatives would result in a better, happier, cleaner, healthier society than is possible by means of a regulatory society.    Politics is war by other means.  Political solutions often sustain conflicts and attitudes of mutual hostility.  It is hard to envision a better world based on endless conflict.  Our approach to solving social and environmental problems ought to be to reduce conflict, rather than to increase it.  Pollution trading rights are an effective alternative to regulation for the control of pollution.  Pollution trading rights passed in 1990 were described as "one of the most successful programs that Congress has ever put together in the environmental area" by a senior attorney from the Environmental Defense Fund.  Although there will be conflict, sometimes bitter conflict, over the initial level at which pollution trading rights are set, once the rights have been set up the result is a system that encourages corporations to invest in creative technologies that constantly reduce pollution.  There are better and worse ways to set up such systems; I would not claim that all pollution trading systems are equal.  That said, a well-designed pollution trading right system reduces pollution more effectively, with less conflict, than do regulations.  Idealists need to educate themselves on strategies like these that will allow for endless positive gains instead of endless battles.  Creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship have improved human life far more than anyone has ever thought possible.  Life five hundred years ago in Europe was similar to life in the third world today:  poverty, disease, pain, and misery were the day-to-day norm for most people.  Creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship have utterly transformed everyday life for millions of people in the first world.  With wisely designed institutions, all remaining social, health, and environmental problems may be solved by the same powerful formula.  What people don't realize is that institutional frameworks determine which problems are amenable to creative, entrepreneurial solutions - and which are not.  "If it can't be abused, it's not freedom."  The freedom to create implies the freedom to destroy.  It is frightening.  People will be hurt.  But the net gains are dramatic.  As an educator, I can create schools that will ameliorate social problems and poverty to a significant extent.  But in order to do this, I would need radical educational freedoms that would, necessarily, result in crazy, whacko schools as well as mine.  Advocates of regulation are especially horrified at the notion that the drug industry would be unregulated.  They envision a nightmarish world in which greedy corporations spawn a new generation of thalidomide babies.  Meanwhile, the FDA has delayed or blocked drugs and devices that could save the lives of heart attack victims.  Because of the FDA, between 20,000 and 40,000 people have died unnecessarily because they did not have access to medical treatments that are widely accepted in Europe.  Unlike AIDS activists, who aggressively pushed the FDA to approve life-saving drugs more rapidly than usual, these heart attack victims were dispersed and often were not aware of their risk, thus preventing them from lobbying the FDA to save their lives.    Any evaluation of the value of regulation has to include not only the harms that have been prevented, but also the goods that have been prevented.  Both quantities are difficult to estimate.  But an overall opinion concerning regulation that does not consider both the gains and losses due to regulation is not an well-considered opinion.  When, in a recent issue, Scientific American argued for the regulatory state, they failed to include the costs of regulation.  20,000 - 40,000 deaths is an enormous cost to ignore, and it is but one among many.  Upper class people spend large sums of money to go mountain climbing, which has a higher death rate than almost any activity or substance from which we receive government protection.  Our entire approach to risk is highly paternalistic:  Educated elites seem to believe that the kinds of high risk activities that they pursue are legitimate somehow, whereas allowing the poor to expose themselves to much lower risks is considered to be immoral.  When my charter school is damaged by regulation, or when fathers in their prime die becaue they are not allowed access to medical treatment, the harms, while relatively invisible to the public, are still available to us at the level of anecdote and statistic.  Innovations that have not occurred due to regulations are completely invisible.  There is reason to believe that the stillbirth of such innovations, invisible though they may be, is much, much greater than the subtle harms described above.  Auctioneers in France must be licensed.  As a consequence, Ebay was initially not allowed to operate in France.  Had a similar law existing in the U.S., Ebay would not exist at all.  After starting out as sort of global garage sale, Ebay has become a major force in business-to-business commerce as well.  Ebay has saved millions of people millions of dollars; it has allowed many thousands of people to create businesses from their homes; it is one of the most democratic marketing mechanisms on earth.  Who would have imagined that a small law requiring that auctioneers be licensed would prevent a major force for global market democracy from coming into being?  Even the most imaginative of us lack the imagination to envision the ways in which regulations harm us.  In order to create a better world, we need to find ways in which health, wellness, community, happiness, spirituality, transcendent experiences, and other wonderful things may be more effectively made available to more human beings.  The elimination of regulations, licensing, and other obstacles is essential in order for us to find creative solutions to life's problems.  Thus my outrage at the existence of regulations is not because I am blind to social problems; it is because the regulations inadvertently prevent wonderful solutions to social problems from coming into existence.

      Public choice economists, those who study governments, would claim that it is possible to predict that regulatory agencies in government will be "captured" by the industries that they regulate.  Meanwhile, most people are outraged at the notion that regulators are cozy with the industries that they regulate.  According to the public service notion of government, conscientious individuals who accept positions in regulatory agencies are there to serve the public good.  It is a matter of personal integrity not to be corrupted by the corporations that they regulate.  Thus the moral outrage when regulators are corrupted by the corporations that they regulate.    From the perspective of the Left, such outrage is evidence of human decency (much as, from the perspective of the Right, outrage over sexual misconduct, such as adultery, is evidence of human decency).  From the perspective of public choice economics, Leftist outrage over regulatory capture is evidence of naïveté, not of human decency (there are likewise economists who would regard outrage over sexual misconduct as a matter of naïveté on the Right).  We evolved in small tribes in which feelings of moral outrage served a useful purpose.  In a small tribal environment, those who did not conform to the moral dicta of the tribe were sanctioned communally, often by means of tribal feelings of moral outrage.  In such a context, social feeling was itself the primary form of legislation and enforcement.  It is a serious problem of modernity when, where, and why to feel moral outrage.  We do not want, and should not want, to extinguish our moral feelings.  And yet the situations described above should encourage us to become somewhat thoughtful concerning when and where outrage is a useful feeling.  It feelings of outrage no longer serve an effective enforcement purpose, but merely result in personal frustration, then perhaps we ought to learn to temper or redirect them.  In the case of regulatory capture, part of the reason that economists regard regulatory capture as a predictable behavior is due to the asymmetry of interest and knowledge.  Industries that are regulated typically have intense incentives and extensive information regarding the issues on which they are being regulated.  Ordinary citizens, and even the politicians elected to represent them, typically have very weak incentives and very little information concerning the relevant issues.  Often regulation becomes highly technical:  how can an ordinary person possibly keep up?    Moreover, the difference between sincere, well-intentioned public servants and corrupt regulatory officials is not as large as is generally imagined.  Because regulatory issues are often technical, usually even conscientious regulatory officials represent the existing opinion regarding "best practices" in each industry.  But upholding the existing opinion regarding "best practices" in each industry is almost identical to maintaining the self-interest of the more responsible portion of the status quo.  Thus, simply due to ordinary circumstances, regulators almost always stifle innovation (This is certainly the case in education; again, endless specific instances are available on request).  Thus I am outraged by the fact of regulation, not by corruption in regulation.  From my perspective, conscientious regulation is often almost as bad as corrupt regulation.  In practice, relatively few regulators are openly corrupt.  It is much more common for regulators to have similar attitudes, interests, and professional standards as the regulatees.  The best regulators do come from industry and then receive jobs in industry when they leave their positions.  In many particular cases, the moral status is very blurry.  Most people believe themselves to be good people.  When they are surrounded by like-minded people who reinforce their views, it becomes even easier to believe this.  Soon "the public interest" and the views one happens to hold naturally coincide.    I know several of the good people in the State Department of Education who have harmed excellent charter schools, my own included.  They are good people, doing what they believe to be right to the best of their ability.  And, like many other regulators, they are destroying innovation and good education.    They can't help it.  That is what they are paid to do:  uphold current best practices.
