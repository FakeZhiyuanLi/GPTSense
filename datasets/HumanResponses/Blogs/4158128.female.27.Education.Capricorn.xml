       I had planned on blogging about my trip to Cincy but in light of Tony's victory today at Watkins Glen, I dedicate today's blog to him. This was the second win of the season for him and in both cases, I was not watching the race except for the last few laps. I hope I'm not jinxing him by trying to watch every week. Anyway, Tony was suffering from stomach and leg cramps and was unable to attend his victory lane celebration. Hope you feel better soon Tony!!        Congratulations Tony Stewart and the #20 Team!!!!

      There are a few forever optimistic people in my life who live by the motto "If it's meant to be, it's meant to be". They tell me this little nugget of wisdom whenever I am faced with a hard choice or dilemma of some sort. This makes me think that it's all a matter of fate and I should just shut up and stop wasting everyone's time when destiny is going to take care of it and all my whining will not change that. Sometimes, they will pull out the big guns and say "If it's God's will, it will all work out." This makes me think that if I start questioning things, I'm questioning The Big Guy and I will surely be struck by lightning. I always found a measure of comfort in these people. They make me feel better, they give me a gleam of hope because after all  IF  it's meant to be, it will be.  "That," my best friend Robin told me recently "is what people tell you when they know good and well, it's not going to go your way but they don't want to be mean."  Now, that was a downer. But it got me thinking...do these people really believe what they are saying or is Robin right and they are just telling me this to get me to shut up?? I started paying closer attention when I was telling someone a problem. Generally when I tell someone my problems their advice isn't that much of a priority because hey, it's  my  problem and I want to  talk  about it. But I concentrated really hard to see if they would drop the "meant to be" bomb.  What I've decided is that some people are meant to ponder and overanalyze every single detail of their lives. I'm one of those people. And some people just absorb the facts of the situation and turn it over to fate or a higher power or whatever. Those are the people that make lemonade out of life's lemons and play the cards they are dealt and all those other cliches.  Like one of my racing heroes, Bobby Labonte for example. One day in a practice hour interview someone asked Bobby what he thought his chances were for the next day's race. Bobby said something to the effect of-and this is not a direct quote but it's close-"Well, the car's not running too good but you know we're gonna work on it and well either we'll fix it or we won't." He made one of his trademark faces and went on with his business.  He wasn't sweating it.  This is the kind of philosophy I wish I could have. Either he'll call or he won't. Either you'll get the job or you won't. So starting today, it's my goal to adopt the Bobby philosophy. To stop worrying about things, stop overanalyzing and just let it ride. I'll let you know how it goes.  Either it will work for me or well, it won't.

      My mom likes Neil Diamond. I can remember her playing his greatest hits LP on our huge stereo that took up half the living room as a kid. A few of them stuck in my mind like "Sweet Caroline" and my favorite "Cracklin Rosie". Flashforward about twenty years when I saw my favorite party band The Menus for the first time. The songs they cover are mostly late 60s, 70s and a few 80s and I didn't recognize many of them. But as soon as the first notes of "Cracklin Rosie" kicked off, I was all over that one. Finally, a song I could sing along to! It was my favorite until I learned more of their songs. ( A year later, I might add I can sing all of them!). That became my nickname, the name my friend Bonita uses to introduce me to strangers at bars, and "Cracklin Rosie" became my signature song. Whenever, we are planning a Menus adventure-such as the one this weekend for April's birthday-someone will mention "Cracklin Rosie".  Which is all well and good except that I have no idea what the song means.  "Cracklin Rosie get on board/We're gonna ride til there ain't no more to go"  Get on board what? A boat? A train? Where are we going?  "Have me a time with a poor man's lady "?    Who's   lady   is   Cracklin Rose ?  Why is she hanging with a poor man ?  And finally, " Cracklin Rose you're store bought woman "   What the heck does that mean? Is Rosie a ho ?      Despite my confusion, it is fun to have an alter ego. Whenever I see The Menus I can leave Mindy the mild mannered accountant at the door and let Cracklin Rose take over. Which is pretty cool...even if I'm not real sure what I'm supposed to be boarding.

      I went to church this morning with my family like a good girl. An elderly couple two rows  up from us announced it was their 59th wedding anniversary. There were lots of oohs and ahhs and my cousin Roger who was sitting behind me said, "Most people don't last a year anymore" and everyone laughed and agreed with him. I turned around and said, "I can't keep anyone a month!" and I laughed. By myself. No one else laughed with me. They just looked at poor pathetic terminally single Melinda.  The thing is I've decided you might as well laugh as cry. It's become an almost running joke with my friends and family that I can't seem to keep a steady relationship. Maybe it's something I should be seeking counseling for but really it isn't my fault. In the past year: Brad* didn't want a relationship, Steven* was a little too boring, Daniel* lives in another state and Kris* just put me "on hold".  None of these were my fault. So there's no point in feeling hopeless and depressed for me. I don't. Oh yeah, I'll admit, for a couple of days after the end hits I might mope, weep, eat ice cream, and cruise with the top down cursing loudly with my best friend. But then it's all ok.  This makes me think of my favorite Lonestar song called "Heartbroke". This was before "Amazed" came along when they were unknown and John Rich half of today's obnoxious duo Big and Rich was the lead singer. The song's chorus says  Don't you know/I'd get my heartbroke every day if I could.   I used to think, how bizarre. But now I kind of get it. There's always the fun stuff, the good stuff that happens before you get your heartbroke. The giggling and the daydreaming and the hearts doodled during staff meetings. That's the cool part. And I'm sure there are people out there who never get to go through that. So, it's my new attitude to think positively from now on when I get dumped, ditched or dissed.  Somebody remind me of this when I go from being 'on hold' to being a 'dropped call'.  *Names changed to protect the guilty.   My Brickyard Thoughts: Jeff Gordon took off with this one and never looked back. I had my fingers crossed that he would have an engine prob like his...um teammate Jimmie but alas it didn't happen. There was a little more action this year as there actually was some passing going on. Unfortunately, a lot of the action was due to cut tires. Robby Gordon tested my pledge to be nice to him by insisting on keeping his car on the track until his left front was on fire rather than pitting when it first cut down.  My guys' finishes: Tony 5th, Bobby 15th (I know this from   urlLink  www.thatsracin.com    not because I actually saw him on the track anywhere), and Terry 39th as a result of being an innocent victim of circumstance.

      On a normal day, you can drive all over the fair city of Richmond in about fifteen minutes. However, if you are too impaired to drive or plan on getting too impaired to drive and need a cab don't expect them to make such a speedy trip. The cab companies are located pretty much smack dab in the middle of town as are the bars. The major apartment complexes are located at either interstate exit about ten minutes from downtown. This would lead you to think that getting a cab is a fast process. It's not.  The promised twenty minute wait for our cab downtown took almost thirty five. "I'll be here at midnight", our cabbie Jeff told us. "We line up all the way down the street when the bars close." Good deal we thought until we exited the bar. Lots of cops waiting to arrest poor drunken souls. No cabs to haul our sorry asses home. We waited for a few minutes and I gave up and called the cab company. "Well we had some cabs down there," the dispatcher said. "But no one wanted to ride in one." Meanwhile, the cops are yelling that the bar has been closed for twenty minutes now and it's time to go...somewhere. They herd us to the corner of the street to make it easier to hail the cab that is nowhere to be seen.  We eventually give up and take a ride from one of our group's cousins who has a Bible and two packs of mini donuts on his dashboard.  There isn't really a moral to this story. It's just the only part of last night I want to talk about right now.   Tony News:   Tony will start 24th in tomorrow's Brickyard 400. At last practice, he was running 13th. Good luck #20!

      The only worthwhile thing I picked up in a week of college business management conferences is that you can create a blog for free. So, I thought maybe I should get into the action and create one. Not that my life is so terribly exciting that the world needs to hear it but since writing is an interest of mine I decided to put some words out there for everyone to check out.  My goal is to post several times a week-maybe more, maybe less.  Upcoming event: The Brickyard 400 is this weekend. This is the most overrated race of the season. A lot of hype for a race that's generally a total snoozer. I haven't been to Indy myself but those I know who do attend tell me it's not much more exciting live and in person. Will this be  Tony 's year to win? I hope so. Nothing would make me happier than to see Tony, Zippy and the rest of the team kiss the bricks. Good luck in quals tomorrow, Smoke! Check out the results at  urlLink www.thatsracin.com
