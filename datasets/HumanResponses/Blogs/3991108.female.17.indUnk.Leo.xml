        miss su  used to be my living skills teacher when i was in form three. she passed away recently due to appendix eruption. she was 47. it was a real shock to all of us. most of us found out through an sms forwarded by the headmistress. it was a saturday. i couldn't believe it when my friend told me. it seemed surreal. a few days before i just saw her.&nbsp;it didn't sink in till monday. her funeral was held at the school chapel. all of us were given a chance to pay our last respects to her. i'm not sure if this is the right word to use but her funeral was beautiful. many people including a few of the teachers, her sister and students talked about how she touched their lives. many cried their hearts out.&nbsp;  she has touched me as well in many ways. when she was teaching me she used to do our kh project for us even though she grumbled a little and scolded us. she sewd almost the whole project for us. i'm thankful to her for that. i don't think i could have finished it by myself.  during the last few months of her life she was touched by the lord. she joined the rcia. she was very keen to be baptised. her enthusiasm in getting to know god better puts me and many others to shame.she even said she would share with us(cathecism students)&nbsp;her experiences in the rcia. i was really looking forward to it. but unfortunately she went back to the lord before she could share with us.    miss su  was a very talkative person. once she starts you cannot stop her. she'll go from one topic to another. she was an open book. she would talk about everything from latest issues to family problems. she opened her heart to everyone. she would go out of her way to help people. she was one person who lived her life to the fullest. its hard to believe i wont be seeing her around school anymore.  i believe she is in heaven now. i also believe she died because god loved her so much that he wanted her by his side. she is by the side of her creator whom she loved so much.  thank you  miss su  for all you have done for us. you will be in our hearts forever.
