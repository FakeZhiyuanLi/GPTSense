       Hello hello hello again. It's lovely to speak to you all. Really. Let's see... seeing as my mother is off at work for another 40 million hours and I have neither A) a license or B) a car (though I have a permit and could easily drive anywhere I wanted to had I my Jeep), I am inherently under house arrest.  'Oh,' you say, 'But it's such a lovely day outside! Why don't you take the dog for a walk, or go for a bike ride, or read a book in the sun?' Well, first off, I will not be taking anyone for a walk because I am just now regaining said gift of movement back myself. Yes, I have begun training for cross country, and it  hurts . Secondly, my dog is quite content to nap, and continue on in a napping way until about 6 o'clock when he will undoubtedly begin to go mad with hunger. Yes, I starve my dog. He never eats. He is bone thin, and can barely survive on the bits and scraps from the garbage left over from the feast last night.  Actually, he is getting rather portly.  We feed him the same two meals a day, it's just that he hasn't gone for any walkies in a bit. I should go throw the ball for him outside. But not now, he's napping. And besides, that much physical exertion after a long and strenuous day of, err, doing stuff, might just kill me. And I have practice tomorrow. Need to preserve my energy, I do. Of course, the scheduled practice was to go swimming. Well, coach calls it swimming, it's really treading water for forty minutes. But it  is  much more fun than drills and sprints, or even a long run. No, though. We can't go swimming. The swimmers are going swimming. Wait a bit, it's not even the swim team. It's... the children! Little children who are afraid of the water and cling to their mother's legs before getting thrown into their cold, wet, doom, only to be met by some overly-perky girl with a long blonde ponytail, enthusiastically encouraging the little kids who are innocently flailing their arms about to "relax... be one with the water... and blow little bubbles... and..." So, while some children will become forever aqua-phobic, I and my fellow cross country runners will succumb to the pain and torture that is... the DP weight room. Again, actually not as bad as some workouts. It's just that, well, we did it on Tuesday. And it hurt. A lot. And it smells. A lot. And swimming is just way more fun. Ah well. C'est la vie.  Friday's workout is going to kill me. Sprints. I hate sprints. Sprints are the reason (besides wanting to devote my precious time to the beautiful art that is theatre) I quit track. And not only are we doing sprints, oh no, we are doing sprints  on the BEACH!  Ooh, it just keeps getting better. (Dear reader, you must know that, while I do seem rather sarcastic and cynical, I really do love cross country. Besides the pain, it's a fantastically fab group of people. It's just that it's very easy to complain about. Not that anyone reads this... but I digress). Yes, so, anyway... ah yes. And, on Saturday, whilst everyone is dragging themselves up Gaviota Peak, I, in my Jeep, will be happily driving around in Los Angeles, shopping for back-to-school supplies, writing (in Italian) to  Sig. Cicale  back in Prague (or are they in Italy now?), and maybe taking in a nice leisurely bike ride around the lake.  Oh, and shopping for something to give to Ariel for her grand birthday spectacular that I know she will have in a few weeks. I feel like an old lady around all my DP frieds. Well, all my freshman friends anyway. I was just at Karisa's for her 15th birthday, and Whitney hit 15 in March, Ariel will be on the 16th of August, and Molly - not until January  of next year!  However,  I  shall be happily celebrating my Sweet 16 come November.  A round of huzzahs!, if you will. Well, I suppose I must be going now. I've loads of important people to see and many things that need tending to. Perhaps we shall chat again sometime soon? Baci, ~K

       So hello.  I've become so fed up with my other blog that I just need to start a new one. I've littered the other with stupid quizzes and mindless babble. So here I am.  I've not much to say right now, but I just can't leave a brand new blog naked, so I thought I'd post a quick note.  That being done, I shall leave you now. Tata. -K
