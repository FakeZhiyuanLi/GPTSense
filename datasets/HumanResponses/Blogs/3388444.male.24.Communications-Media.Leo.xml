       So yea, I didn't go to work today... It's Friday, and who wants to be at work? I watched Gandalf fly on his uber horse lastnight until 6:30 in the fucking morning. So getting up at 11:00 wasn't happening for me.   I think since it's Friday, I get to drink... although I've been drunk EVERY night of the fucking week... I'm such a lush, uber.  Dance Dance you fucking homo's..  Rawr

       "How about my hot pink dildo" is the conversation in my left ear between Holzer and his 37 year old girlfriend... according to Holzer, thats for "when im not there". So yea. Enough about those...   So I played some  urlLink EverQuest  lastnight, it was fun... although we had to do some some CR.  urlLink Holzer  always tends to n00b it up for us... gg pathing bug chardok.   I bought the Probot album this week and don't really understand why I didnt buy this fucking album like the day before it came out. Dave Grohl is the man... I cant stop listening to this album. If you really loathe 80's metal then you are a faggot and shouldnt buy this album.   How is it, that I've had digital cable for years and just now discovered On Demand... I mean, wtf. I realize its only about 6 months old... but how did something that fucking badass slip by me????? Free movies and I was retarded and thought I had to pay for them... so lastnight I rented like 16 things just to do it... all free, fucking something good finally came of Comcast.   I think that coming in to work today at 2pm was amazing... and that I'm done posting  Later

       Oh, good fucking game... I made a blog. These thing's are fucking retarded, yet I feel compelled to create one so I can fit in with the rest of the pretentious cock suckers ( deadwood pwns ) on the internet. So yea, I will probably post a lot of shit about  urlLink EverQuest , because it is indeed the greatest fucking game on the planet. I will probably post a lot about my hyper homosexual boss Mr. Betz. I will probably not talk about my gay friends... as most of them are indeed... gay.  Ok, enough rawr... I LIVE IN ATLANTA WHERE IT IS 90% GHETTO AND 10% RICH WHITE PEOPLE WHO TRY TO ACT GHETTO SOMETIMES. ITS SO AWESOME HERE>>> ALTHOUGH I FOUND A SMALL COMMUNITY HERE WHERE ITS WHITE PEOPLE WHO ACT WHITE SO IM GTFG RIGHT NOW>>>  Good Game...
