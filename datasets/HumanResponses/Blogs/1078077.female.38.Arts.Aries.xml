      Sitting here holding my baby on my shoulder after just having a wonderful chat with a sexy man online.  Thinking of how I used to have a life outside of diapers and nursing and how much I would love to go be intimate with someone RIGHT NOW.  Yum.

      If you live in Seattle and have never had a bonfire on the beach at Alki, GO!  NOW!  It's amazing.  We had one last night for the Winter Solstice and it was just wonderful.  Listening to the waves lapping at the shore, the crackling of the fire and feeling the moon gazing down at us from between the clouds on the longest night of the year was pure bliss.  Hell, just go build a bonfire wherever you are.  If it's private, strip down and be primal then write me at kymberleev@hotmail.com and tell me all about it.  ;-)

      I was just chatting with my friend, Mike, who ROCKS!  He made yet another CD for me of my favorite songs.  The last one has laser burns from being over played.  I'm a sucker for a good groove which is why I highly recommend the song, "At Night" by Shakedown.  Check it out.  I think you'll be shakin' your thang in no time.  I think blogs are made for people like me who have lots to say and need an audience.  I would love to be the Spokesperson of Self Expression and Sexuality.  That's a great job, don't you think?

      A little thingie I cut out from a magazine and put on a collage.  I love this:  "This isn't just a course in art, it's a course in living."   It reminds me that OUR LIVES ARE OUR WORKS OF ART.    It's my picture.  I think I'll get out my brush and paint some more broad, colorful strokes. :-)  What color are you painting today?

      Sunday afternoon.  Almost the New Year.  Thinking about the regrets of the last year (NONE!) and all of the promise that exists in 2003.  Working on my website.  Making the most of the resources available to me and FINALLY letting go of relationships, situations and stuff that no longer serves my highest good.  Oh, the juicy possibilities that abound when we free ourselves of what we don't need and move FORWARD.  Here's to new adventures in 2003!  (insert sound of clinking glasses in your imagination).

      Jammin' to my new Jamiroquai CD, "A Funk Odyssey".  It's a wonderful piece of art and I highly recommend it.  Check them out  urlLink here   I had the opportunity to shake my ass on Friday night when I went dancing with some friends at a club called The Bohemian.  I had my first shot of Tequila, which was amazing and danced my legs off.  It's amazing what happens when you just let your inhibitions slip away and melt into the moment.  When I allow myself to really be present in the moment by drinking in the sunset, smelling my daughter's hair, responding to a lover's touch or just being aware of the blood coursing through my veins, I feel FREE.  I feel at ONE with the Universe.  Try it.  I think you'll like it.  :-)

      Here's some inspiration for these times: "I have learnt through bitter experience the one supreme lesson to conserve my anger, and as heat conserved is transmuted into energy, even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power which can move the world."  "Nonviolence and cowardice go ill together. I can imagine a  fully armed man to be at heart a coward. Possession of arms implies an  element of fear, if not cowardice. But true nonviolence is an impossibility without the possession of unadulterated fearlessness."  "I have not the shadow of a doubt than any man or woman can  achieve what I have, if he or she would make the same effort and cultivate the same hope and faith." -Gandhi.

      I just finished reading James Twyman's book, "Emissary of Love".  I highly recommend it. You can order it  urlLink here . In the book this question  is asked.  "How would you act and what would you do if you knew that you are an Emissary of Love right now?"  You are LOVE.  Be LOVE.  Begin.

      Write a poem for peace and send it to  urlLink mailto:kokua@olympus.net   by February 12.  The poems will be presented that day.  You don't have to be Yeats or Whitman.  Just write from your heart.  And remember to hold PEACE in your heart while doing it. If we want  peace, we must embody it.  BE PEACE my friends.  Feel it.  Taste it.  Live it.

      Ahhhh....it was SUCH a beautiful day today!  My oldest daughter stayed home from school today to have a Mommy day so we hung out much of the day then went to Carkeek Park in the afternoon.  The sun filtered through the trees and made the ferns in the forest seem to glow as we hiked the trails.  My baby was in her backpack and I held my 6 year-old's hand as we climbed up up up to the vista that overlooks the water.  She had her "spy" glass and looked around to see what she could see.  Later, we went down to the beach and stuck our bare feet in the freezing water.  By the time we got back to the car, our feet were completely numb.  I decided there isn't much better in life than being outside on a clear day with my beautiful children. I am so incredibly blessed to be alive!

      Sipping some delightful French pressed coffee, listening to my new  urlLink Christina Aguilera  CD (thanks Mom!), watching my girls play and just relaxing on this beautiful, winter day.  The holidays this year have been a time of more simplicity which has allowed time for what is most important to me.  I have made fewer commitments, done less and spent more time at home taking care of myself and my children.  I just spoke with my Mom on the phone who said, "you sound so relaxed".   I am.  It feels good.    I think working out regularly really helps with relaxation.  I started this intense, effective, kick-ass work out program called Power 90.  You can more information about it at  urlLink beachbody.com .  It's a six day a week program that alternates cardio/abs and circuit training every other day.  I'm loving the physical challenge, I'm sleeping better and generally feeling like a new person.   The best part is that it's only 30 minutes a day and I do it at home!  That works for a busy mother of two.  I need to refine my skill with my new  urlLink Canon Digital Rebel  camera before tomorrow morning.   I've waited a long time for a new camera.  This is the one!  It's light-weight,  multi-functional and as close to a pro camera as you can get without spending 4K.  Now I just need to tackle the learning curve.  I am looking forward to our  urlLink Tofurkey  dinner tonight, to sipping some red wine by our beautiful tree and being steeped in love and light.

      I am getting ready for my trip to Hawaii presently.  I'm doing a presenation for the  urlLink National Expressive Arts Therapy Association's Annual Conference  in Honolulu.  It feels a little scarey but also exciting.  I am most delighted that I get to sink my toes into the sand in Kauai for a week after the conference.  MMMMMMMMMMM  I am feeling silky smooth after a visit to  urlLink Olympus Spa  in Tacoma.  If you've never soaked, scrubbed, steamed and saunaed (is that a word?) there before, you really should treat yourself.  It's amazing.    It's truly amazing what a difference a little self care can make in one's life.  I feel more grounded (and a little shinier!) after that experience.  Self love is a beautiful thing.  Yes, that DOES have a couple of  meanings.  Speaking of self care, consider the benefits of good colon health.  Did I say COLON?  YEP!  Did you know that colon cancer is the #2 cancer killer?  I had a colonic at the  urlLink Tummy Temple  the other day as part of my cleansing process.  The space is amazing, the people that work there are completely beautiful and I came out feeling better and more informed about my colon.  Stop feeling embarassed!  If we were all more open about such matters, colon cancer wouldn't be killing so many people.    So, indulge in a little self care and a whole lot of self love and live your best life!

      I am deconstructing my entire life, ego, sense of reality at present.  It's both frightening and liberating.  I feel as though every relationship, every role, every assumption I've made about anything is under attack by the part of me that seeks authenticity.    The hardest part of this process of self-discovery is figuring out what (or who) will be left when the dust settles.    That remains to be seen.

      When you are stripped bare and are so transparent you feel as though you have no skin.&nbsp;   When time is suspended and the world opens up to a new possibility that you could never have imagined.&nbsp;   When the scent of honeysuckle in the night air or the tender kiss from your child makes&nbsp; your heart feel like it will explode.  When these moments become part of everyday experience you know you are alive.  And you are deeply grateful.

      Tonight, I went to a screening of  urlLink Quick Brown Fox  at the  urlLink Henry Art Museum .&nbsp; It is a very touching film done by a brave woman, Ann Hedreen of  urlLink White Noise Productions .&nbsp; It is an account, in the first person, of a woman whose mother is dying of Alzheimer's Disease.&nbsp; During the Q&A, I asked her if she found the process to be therapeutic.&nbsp; She said she found it was not only very healing for her but for her entire family.&nbsp; She said producing the movie helped them learn to talk about it.&nbsp;   My grandfather died of Alzheimer's and my partner's father is currently dying of it.&nbsp; It is tragic and the number of people stricken with it grows every year.&nbsp;  urlLink You can help  get this movie seen and heard by more people so that the research can continue.&nbsp; As Mother Teresa said,   "We cannot all do great things, but we can do small things with great love."     The courage of this woman to document her struggle with her mother's dying is tugging at me tonight.&nbsp; I do believe what wounds us the most is what we bring forward to the world as healing.&nbsp; I see this every day.&nbsp; I believe strongly in the power of art to heal.&nbsp; That's why I'm volunteering with  urlLink Art With Heart , an organization that uses art to help children in crisis.&nbsp; I became an Expressive Arts Therapist because I believe in this work.&nbsp; I feel so inspired to do more because of people like Ann.&nbsp; Bless her.&nbsp; May her wonderful film be seen throughout the world.

      Wishful thinking...  I am masking my face at this very moment with the kind of mask that  hardens  on your face.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's suppose to "lift" it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure if it does but it sure does SOMETHING.&nbsp; Anyway, my 8 year old was wandering aimlessly about as she has all week and I suggested that perhaps she read one of her summer reading books that have been neglected for awhile.&nbsp; She replied (grudgingly), "Okay.&nbsp; I thought you couldn't  talk  with that mask on."&nbsp;   I remember thinking things that like about my Mom.&nbsp; I find it all very amusing.

      This morning, cool salty air was blowing in from the Sound.&nbsp; The pungent, sea air mixed with the delicious scent of pine.&nbsp; As I stood at my window breathing in the fragrance, gazing out at the water and sipping my coffee, I thought of how at one time, those were the scents that&nbsp;the Northwest First&nbsp;Nations people&nbsp;woke up to every day.&nbsp; There were no petroleum or plastic smells.&nbsp; Just the organic bounty that nature brought to them.&nbsp; I feel grateful for my warm house, this computer&nbsp;that connects me to the world&nbsp;and my modern conveniences.&nbsp; I am equally grateful for the simple pleasures of smooth rocks under my feet, the scent of the morning air or the feel of moss under my naked skin in the forest.&nbsp; Life is so exquisitely beautiful, I ache some days.
