       There are scores of hearts as yet untouched by the light, be it described as love, or knowledge, or goodness. We meet and see such hearts in action every day.  Hearts come cold and heavy, these days.  Hearts devoid of love, of passion, and of the inability to absorb positivism around them.  Hearts of stone.  These hearts require no understanding, nor do they have to try at anything for fear they will let something get in its way.  They come this way, frozen, freezer-burned, iced-over, prepackaged and ready for deep-freeze distribution, seeping its frigidity out into lives unprepared and uncaring.  Hearts of stone attract hearts of stone.   Enter the heart filled with light.   If you are one of these positive souls, filled with the milk of human kindness, then the world here, and those beyond, knows of you.  You are literally an angel living amongst us.  You will be discovered, for you are rare indeed!  You came into this life from the other side to carry worldly burdens, its pains, while caring for your own, only to be scorned for your courage, time, and strength of effort, mistrusted by others, who only want to feed on your allure until your bones become dry and scattered to the seven winds.  Fear not.  You are filled with light.  They will not overcome you.  If we think about the positive evolution of our spirit too hard, we only complicate a very simple premise.  Hearts, good or bad, gold or stone, attract.  Pure, plain, and simple.  Just go back to the last relationship or trial you’ve endured, be it friend, family, lover or stranger.  Were you gold when there was gold to see?  Were you stone as you bore the weight of their stones falling?  As an infant you had a golden heart.  So how is your heart built now?  We often talk of the five senses in addition to an indefinable “Sixth Sense”.  The Psychic sense.  In a large way, the heart is our psychic organ, not the mechanical heart that makes our blood flow,our heart of hearts, the one that lies in close relationship to our individual will, character, our being, and eventually its projection into our world around us.   The Sixth Sense.    Where did we get our psychic heart  and is it filled with stones or gold?  (How can I find out?)  Most likely, where your gift came from, how it was obtained, will never be known, for it lies outside our sphere of present understanding, but one thing is for sure, we know it exists.  We’ve had the clues.   They came to us by way of instinct, intuition, and yes, as crazy as it sounds, a psychic revelation.  Some have said or postulated that our heart of hearts came with us at birth from other past lives ... bearing our souls ... which we have had all along, since the beginning of Time eternal.  You hear people speak of old souls.  Old souls have learned to grow like the grand trees of the Sequoia, they have broadened like rivers and seas during drowning wet seasons, and they have borne an eternity of burdens, much as a mountain carries the sky on its back.  Old souls are recognized rarely, and are less understood.  Yet they pass by us everyday.  If we would only look up from our desk, our phones, our televisions, our sorrows, our own personal burdens and take the time to observe, we might rub elbows with one or two.  You will recognize them if you operate your psychic heart, for most are like you.  We have also heard of powers that charm others, of charisma, and of ancient stories telling us of certain “Illuminated One or Ones”.  We have learned to instinctively feel when there are positive or negative influences within our lives.  Sometimes we listen to our inner heart’s voice and sometimes we have tuned it out, ignoring it altogether.  However, we consciously or subconsciously gauge such things by an  affirmation process seeking out the positive:  Does touching this (issue) bring reward?  (Good or bad?) Do I recognize this?  (familiar or strange?) Do my own abilities outweigh whatever drawbacks arise from this?  (survival or failure?) Do I have within me a stronger power?  (can I endure no matter what?) What help will I receive if this is too much?  (my failsafe?) (And this one is the clincher of all clinchers:) If the world ended tomorrow, who would I turn to first, trust in the most, and rely on to guide my heart in those final hours?  The answer ... myself!   To guide My Heart  ... not my corporal body, not my car, my bank account, my career, my social calendar.  My heart.  And so we lend our minds to a higher power.  We think of and pray to God’s unerring love.  Will we draw our faith before the world ends?  What about now?  This very second?  What gets us through?  Who or what steps up to our own personal plate?  What about our children’s plates?  Where, how, or when can I find all this within myself with or without God’s divine knowledge?   The psychic heart has the answers  ... just listen.  We are all much stronger in spirit than we believe.  Such great strength in our most dire moments comes through under its own power.  The true psychic heart has somehow seen us through before and it borrows from everything for survival for the journey that has passed or is to come.  Is all this about the psychic heart just another way to think about God?  Yes and no.  To be sure, the psychic heart is His most vital tool beyond this earthly plane.  A psychic heart somehow knows when to love and be loved.  It just does.  We don’t have to tell it to.  We can’t force it to be that way or even to block it away.  We, our rational selves, can’t, won’t  decide if such love will be an unconditional love or a love platonic.  Love finds its own resonance, good , bad or ugly.   A hungry, lonely soul knows by feeding on companionship, they’ll never want to go back to being alone again.  There is a value and beauty to life of being embraced in positive experiences and it enlightens and excites our living lives.  How do you know if you can go the road alone, if need be, regardless of what is to be?  Such is the dichotomy of the individual spirit, which is a self-sustaining, strong, enduring, radiant light, yet it yearns for the companionship of others.  Our hearts have learned not to be afraid, yet they often remain wary.  If you feel your heart can remain unguarded, then the pristine citadel of your heart is open for onslaught, an injury that may embroil you sometimes for years, affecting everyone around you.  If you feel it does ring true that you can keep a hand upon the gate of your heart, then somewhere, sometime, somehow you have healed through a process of trial and acceptance, of self-doubt and self-confidence, so that you have grown emotionally.  The really good news is that, now that you have healed, you can begin healing those around you.  You don’t have to try.  It’s like falling in love, the psychic heart knows its own way.  Now that you know your heart is a radiant one, you will see by its light, others who are also radiant like you!  So, enter the heart filled with light.   It knows its way!  It’s been there, gone around the block, bought the map, seen all the sights and attractions, and brought home the commemorative trophy cup.  You should know when your inner self is channeling positivity, charm, magnetism, allure and appeal; you’ll get immediate, and positive feedback.  How many times have you heard the voice of your psychic heart?   The Child within.   Now that you have this psychic heart filled with capricious light, what do you do with it?  How do you keep it safe?  Treat it as if it were your most precious child!  Watch it grow inside you.  Protect it, keep the engine warm and running, and carry it without the weight of knowing.  Keep it within your sight.  Listen to its laughter.  Learn its words and messages to you.  Learn to love its nuance as you learn to love yourself.  Never turn it away.  Truth, with a capital “T”, awaits your discovery.  Be open and receptive to what your heart unveils.  Everyone has psychic energy to one degree or another. Unfortunately, most people start losing their psychic gifts at puberty.  The remaining child within the psychic heart is your clairvoyant Empath.  Unencumbered by the corruption of the world around you, the inner, intuitive heart is keen on honesty and simple truths.  It doesn’t examine its findings, however. That part is up to your cognitive abilities.   The child within, thus unencumbered, sees energy as pertaining to psychic futures and pasts.  That, in itself, can also be the energy of Karma, relationship energy, past lives energy, emotional energy, as well as the energy of immediate thoughts and concentrated intent of yourself and others.  Here’s how it goes:  How did you know when you were entering into a bad situation the last time you noticed?  What told you even beforehand, if only in seconds, that it was time to put up your guard?  As a child, if you remember, it was far easier to see certain things coming.  Your mind was a thirsty sponge absorbing knowledge, processing it, delivering information at rates that even today’s super computers can’t match.  You were a clean slate, so to speak, being programmed at lightning speed.  Your inherent intuitions were sharper, more reactive, and in tune to the subtleties that now, as adults, we have tuned out as just background static.  But even static is at least a noise.  It has a form, a volume, and though can’t be read at first pass, it does retain patterns that we  only glimpse now.  As children we could separate the needless from the useful.   Information gathering was far easier.  We were learning about harm and what it could do to us and we watched for it like radar sweeping the open sky.  After all, as children, it hadn’t been that long since we were in that nether state of "just becoming", into being.  We still retained ties to that realm.  We were closer to God.  It was easier to believe in things of the spiritual, fairies, guardian angles, Santa Claus, the Boogey-man, and the Sand-man.  We had only just  recently been released into life to become complete, seeking life, achieving Karmic wholeness.  Karma is simply incomplete energy requiring completeness.  It is the energy of spiritual contracts, bonds and commitments beyond our range of now-life reach. It comes from and arrives at the soul-level.  Souls communicate all the time.  Two souls can be making contact and talking to one another in the here and now....not just between reincarnated lives, as is the common understanding.  Now that you know you have this childlike intuitive device of the psychic heart ... connecting you to other souls ... the task of translating what the emotions are and are not, how those emotions affect your life, your relationships between people you’ve met, lovers (old and new), family, bosses, co-workers, and teachers, and even extending into your career choices, awaits your rapt attention. When reading your emotions, empathic abilities can help you to understand how your emotions are getting in the way of your choices, easy and difficult. Your emotions affect your ability or inability to act. You can highlight certain emotions and sometimes even pinpoint the source of a blocking emotion if you feel you’ve reached an impasse.  Once you see what is going on and know what is blocking your choices, it is much easier to get around the block and make a different, more life-affirming choice towards the "completeness" ... happiness!  There’s that Karmic connection again!  With a psychic heart, you have been truly blessed with an amazing God-given gift of insight.   Your heart and others around you can benefit, if you so choose to listen.  Remember, nothing happens by chance. The moment we meet someone with whom we are linked, the element of destiny is at play. All that stems from our relationships with one another in our previous lives, remains to be worked out in this life.  Connecting with the spirit, lets you take a walk into the heart of your soul-connected one, and allows you to find where you both fit in.  From this experience you will accomplish a peace of mind, understanding what is going on around you, as well as those loved ones. It can also give you the "inside track” and hidden truths into deeper perceptions, enlightened insights into people’s feelings, real intentions and the future of their relationships, and yours ... whether together or apart.   Feed your heart love and it will grow.

       Let’s take up where I never left off…  It was the summer of 1997.  The glass-edged truth shining through his world came as the sun piercing the darkness after a storm.  His short life (shall we call him: "Elektor"?), had combined to the youthful sum of 31 years.  Nothing, nothing had prepared Elektor for what was to be and what was to become of it, become of him.  He saw it all so clearly.  No great surprise.  It comes with age.  Gods either smile in our favor or turn their backs ... Still, Elektor found comedy residing inside tragedy, laughter rained among his tears.  His muse sought succor in his trials of life, with him, on his behalf, then was consumed by other things.  Such things are dealt down from Mount Olympus.  Elektor saw only what he wanted to see, as do we all.  He had led an orderly life up until the moment, as if Virgo ruled his destiny. Elektor’s feet were on the ground. His spirit unfettered after finishing his schooling.  Days of destitution, dedication, dereliction.  But then that describes every college student and Elektor was no different.  He was an artist. Working in an old renovated mansion once belonging to a prominent doctor of yesteryear. Elektor had two employees in a small, downtown studio. Summer apprentices both.  Dawn, was a vibrant, Swedish-Scottish, tallish, adorable redhead, a magnificent body and strong muscle-tone, possessing a keen eye for microscopic detail.  Dana, was the mousey sister of an artist in residence down the hall, sweet, zero personality.  Dana’s last name was Love. The two (sometimes with both of the Love girls), would come along with Elektor, on weekend hot air ballooning rallies.  They were a joy, but it was Dawn who could really pull her weight, hauling the fabric envelope out of and into its storage bag for travel.  The envelope, being the part of the balloon most visible from the ground, was heavier than it looked when spying those bobbing bubbles of colorful hot air floating in the sky.   But this, Elektor didn’t see coming ... His fate appearing in the guise of a woman.  A young lady from  Iowa.  A balloon pilot herself, she commanded a ragtag crew of guys, as all were holding her balloon to the ground,  standing it vertically, about to jump aloft from  the campus grounds as it waited for  take off .  She walked toward Elektor, unseeing, unaware that two lives were about to cross.  Sparks on the wind.  Balloonists talk of such things.  Sparks and fire, of love and champagne.  And of course the winds.  The sun, where its at.   The clouds, how high?  The fuel in those aluminum canisters, how much?  She walked closer. Elektor, she saw, was smoothly handsome.  Aura, an attractive young woman, with an offguard beauty, strikingly appealed to Elektor.  He could almost reach out and then, suddenly, a burst of flame roared up into the void of the envelope, climbing to meet the mixing volume circulating at the top.  The top strained to leave the ground, pulling its puny payload with it.  The pamphlet with the pilot roster listed her name, we’ll call her "Aura".  Names on the roster are usually matched with the N-numbers on balloons. Elektor’s:  N-72RR.  Aura’s: N-47RR.  Aura drifted over to Elektor, handing him the end of a rope which reached far above his head to the yellow and orange crown of her Raven Rallye balloon.  She asked Elektor if he wanted to hold on.  “More than anything in the world.” he informed her.  Not the rope.  Just her and to the moment.  To life, as it absorbed their flesh, transforming feelings into butterfly wings. Fire reflected in Aura's eyes.  It was the flame going up into the envelope.  Aura smiled and turned away.  He watched how she filled her yellow jumpsuit, as it shrank smaller and smaller over the green, grassy knoll of the balloon takeoff field.   When she returned to the basket, she hopped in.  The thing between Elektor and Aura, that tether of life, connecting ground to air and he to her gossamer craft, held him to her.  She to he, he to her, in that way.  In those silvery moments where the slipstream of time connected them, they were already destined together.  It would be forever.  Such things never die.  In the moted dust of yesterday, the vague mists of tomorrow, all things lost the significance of their meaning.  Aura’s balloon went up.  So did others around her.  Someone shouted for Elektor to let go.  Why should he?  She was gone.  One Year Later: Between the time of Elektor’s burgeoning love for Aura and their fate together following, he watched from the ground one sun-speckled afternoon, as a local fellow pilot fell from her burning balloon from 5,000 feet, climbing above a trail of black smoke.  Awful percussions. Propane tanks exploding.  Furiously popping, high-tension power lines below. Elektor watched helplessly as a small, gray cross fell to earth.  The legs and arms of a fellow human being.  A good person had died having fun.   Her balloon: purple, blue, magenta, left a dead aeronaut, with her two small children back home who would never see her again in this life. Elektor was never to be the same after.  He started dying too.  Inside, day by day.  He never meant to.  Of course no one ever does.  But not long afterward Elektor accidentally bumped into Aura at the Ballooning Federation of America Museum.  She was standing behind the counter.  They were drawn together magnetically and he was stunned beyond words. For Elektor and his new love Aura, it was already too late ... The gods had made all the arrangements.  Somewhere in the background Stevie Nicks was crying out, “Sara”.  “Wait a minute baby ... stay with me awhile.  Said you’d bring me light.  But you never told me about the fire.”  Elektor should have known his life had taken a great turn and all the love stories in the world, all the musicals, and their choreography, lighting, the sets, had put Elektor onstage for all wondrous eyes to perceive a man who was losing his heart.  It was all he had left.  The Fairgrounds: No one told Elektor of the pain.  Agony scattered across the glistening sand, reeling in the heat of a hot, desert sun.  Burning flesh, drying bone.  Evaporating life.  There are a few stories of hurt and ultimate recovery that have drizzled down through the centuries.  They never, never, make us aware of the actual feelings coursing through our veins, the darkness of it crawling up inside us.  Seizing the hovel of our body as its black domain.  The end of all feeling goes away, save the rawness and howling desolation, the weeping desperation. No one explains this.  Someone should.  We are never ready.  It was evening, and the barn dance had already begun.  All the contestants, the balloonists, their wives, families, friends, all had congregated in the barn once the music had begun.  Somebody was playing a Willie Nelson song and butchering it.  Elektor stood in the shadows, along the edges.  That’s where people were watching the players, witnessing the celebration of life and the very instant  they would leap into profundity.  Aura held a beer in her hand.  She remembered Elektor from the day before and enjoyed his entertaining glances.  Elektor could be that way under austere circumstances and could easily fill a vacuum.  For Aura, he filled it, filled it in places she never knew was empty.   She stood on one foot, then the other, smiling, talking, listening ... who knows what?  Her lips were in motion and that lovely flutter made Elektor float.  She disappeared then outside the barn.  Elektor watched from a corner as she secretly met someone, who was trying very hard to persuade her of ... Something he wanted, she didn't.  Elektor watched her return moments later.  They danced closely, all the while Aura seemed wary.  They talked for hours, adjourning to a picnic table in the open night air.  Aura and Elektor were holding hands by the time an older woman, a stranger who seemed to know him, came over catching the lovers unawares.  Out of the blue, she spoke Elektor's name, as if she knew him all her life.  "Maybe a past life," she said.  Perhaps she got his name from the printed roster of balloon pilots.  Perhaps she had asked someone.  They say that ... Souls know souls.  Elektor was secretly wary and alert ... Part of him believed her.  She knew Elektor's lineage, knowing things about him she had no right to know.  Like a shaman, she announced that Elektor had been born with a caul over his face.  He had never known it to be so. Elektor asked his mother sometime afterwards.  It was true.  His face was covered at birth.  "It is a sign," the soothsayer said, "Of exceptionality."  Aura was mystified by the sudden attention lavished on her new heart's desire.  Aura and Elektor wrote letters back and forth with the odd phone call here and there for the better part of three months.  He floated like a ghost for weeks on end.  It never seemed to stop.  Elektor was able to put Aura out of his mind.  But she would be back.  Elektor never made plans for anything.  Elektor actually fooled himself into thinking the two only held high regard for one another and that was that.  There was nothing important about it.  That’s the way things happen.  It seems to have nothing at all to do with you.  Destiny has its own agenda.  The gods play such games.  The Balloon Fiesta: Elektor found himself on an airplane heading for Albuquerque, New Mexico.  It was the Grand Nationals, still held to this day during a big, Balloon Fiesta every year around October. 1,000 or more magnificent balloons in the sky, all at one time.  You feel like you are flying with eagles. Elektor, went thinking that maybe, just maybe he’d see Aura there.  He didn’t.  A week of ballooning was marvelous for his spirit. Elektor had never had such a good time.  He met new friends, rode in their balloons, supped with the “almost famous”, people, pilots, winners, losers, competitors all … The ballooning crowd.   The ballooning crowd have reputations for being a fast, hard-living, hard-loving, tight-knit bunch.  They fly with sheer determination.  They live life off the cuff.  They generously wear their hearts on their sleeves, and they party-down hard.  One thing in common, propane and champagne along with the occasional rousing good breakfast after a successful early morning flight.  When they aren’t drinking champagne, they’re swilling coffee ... Starbucks ... 100-proof caffeine.  Flying hot air balloons takes every ounce of your attention to everything ... 200 Per Cent of it.  You get to where you’re better at the weather than the weatherman.  You have to be.  One minute you are over power lines, the big steel derricks standing tall in the middle of the open pastureland crossing the countryside, the next, you’re eating alfalfa on some farmer’s newly planted field as you land in 20 knot winds.  The basket “dog-houses” on top of you, just like that!  You have to pony up hard cash to the farmer, for destroying his crop along the narrow swath you just mowed down.  Albuquerque?  It’s wide open, no power lines to speak of.  Virgin territory, except for the Indian Reservation where they’ll impound a pilot’s balloon for landing there, unauthorized.  A few fast bucks, so they can go spend it at the casino, later.  Perfect weather that year.  Bob and Mary, of Eugene, Oregon, were Elektor’s ballooning hosts. They handed over the throttle near the last day and Elektor glided the three of them over the Elysian Fields of those Arizonan circular lawns (all their sprinklers water in wide, green circles, visible from the air).  That morning was brilliant.  They sat down to pick up new passengers, ferried up to the landing spot in vans, waiting for their turn aloft. Elektor jumped out in the middle of someone’s pig farm.  Thank God for dry sand!  Mary’s daughter, Stephanie, climbed in, and together, the whole family, took off into an endless blue sky.  There were other flights, but Elektor would recall that particular, overwhelmingly beautiful day, remembering less and less as the years slipped by.  After the Fall: November came and went, and still there was no Aura.  Sometimes in the middle of the night Elektor would wake, looking out his window at the nightime sky and see the Big Dipper hanging there, framed, upside down. Emptied out.   By February, Elektor recieved a phone call.   Aura wanted to meet him at the BFA’s Safety Seminar held in Chicago. Through the ballooning grapevine she had heard he was going up with his crew.  Fine, Elektor said.  The heart-coals had grown cold.  What would be the harm?  So, the week of the seminar, Elektor packed, counting time.  Another call from Aura.  She can’t make it to Chicago.  Her car won’t make the trip.  She could make it half-way and maybe ride with Elektor??  Okay!  What would be the harm? Elektor’s crew bales the last minute.  He called Aura.  She’s still fine with it ... If he is.  Okay!  What would be the harm?  They made plans to meet in Davenport, a hundred miles away in Iowa.  Out of Elektor’s way, but when a fellow balloonist is in need ... Who was he kidding?  What was he thinking?  A half-day later, after driving all night long (not unusual for balloonists to drive all night long!), Elektor was listening to Paul McCartney’s; “Ram” album.  A little radio.  A little CB talk.  Truckers pointing out “Smokies in the bushes”.  Somewhere along the way, maybe Peoria, Elektor had the “World’s Best Cup of Coffee”, from some roadside truck stop.  He was wired for  the rest of the way to Davenport, by now, only 50 miles away. Elektor actually thought, he actually, really thought, he was headed to Chicago and the seminar.  The weather was clear as a bell and the sun was out.  All was fine and the world made sense, in an obtuse kind of way.  Paul McCartney kept singing, “We’re so sorry, Uncle Albert ... We’re so sorry if we caused you any pain, today!” Elektor should have taken heed.  Once in Davenport, Elektor waited in the restaurant parking lot. A Denny’s no less. Elektor waited for Aura to show.  It was getting late.   The road was calling, but he waited patiently.  He had brought a gift for her.  A gown for Aura to sleep in.  He felt it was innocent enough.  He wanted to be appreciative.  The lights to the parking lot came on. Elektor had already been in and out of Denny’s so many times from all the coffee, that they thought he was a derelict.  And he was, just not in that sense.  About five minutes after he had started his engine, sat back, put the shift in Drive, put it back in Park, Aura pulled in with her trademark-green, Volkswagon Beetle.  Aura flipped up her sunglasses and rolled down her window. Elektor looked at her, feeling blood boiling inside his body.  He acted on instinct alone, when Aura turned her face up to his.  Not a “hello” word was said, not a signal given.  Not a soul outside their little sphere of reality existed within six feet of Aura’s car.  The window slid farther down.  Something clicked inside Elektor, Aura’s eyes were wet.  Her hand came up to touch her nose.  That’s all it took. Elektor grabbed hold of the “rope” again, his lifeline to her.  The rope connected and led to the sky above.  It connected as no other two people had ever been connected before. Elektor leaned into the window and placing his lips hungrily on hers, they kissed hello … for long, tremolous moments, they kissed in just that way. Both adrift in a landscape of unreality.  "I’ve been waiting for you," Elektor said, (such an understatement).  "I’ve been waiting for you too," she returned, and stepped from her car gleaming with a smile.  Holding hands they made their way across Denny’s lot and into a motel.  The luggage would wait.  His present for her would wait too.  A week later Elektor moved, lock, stock, and barrel, to Des Moines, driving all night through a blinding snowstorm that was threatening the whole Mid-west with a full-fledged, spring blizzard.  Trucks, big ones, had driven (slid actually), across the road and into ditches all along the way.  Aura was waiting, worried sick.  Reunion ... Another motel.  Heaven on Planet Earth.  The day was bright with the new snow.  Two hearts beating together even brighter.  They spent the next day looking for an apartment .  By week's end, Elektor had a new job, doing artwork for a small art house, Energy Graphics, in downtown Des Moines.  Elektor painted a mural of the Mona Lisa on the side of their building.  It was visible from the expressway for years.  Aura spent her lazy summer days operating a printing press with an insurance company.  Their glorius nights were spent in virtual bliss, locked in one another's arms.  Before the next big balloon championships came along, they had moved in together.  They were flying in her balloon together too.  It had been an absolutely incredible year for balloonists.  The sky belonged to love.  Love had flown home.

       By the bush I stood today again. Each branch was filled with thorn. Amongst its brambles hid a rose, Its prize was thus adorned:  Red to warn her idle hand, Whose bud she might have shorn. Petal’d secrets to draw the eye,  Where crowns of seed are borne.   Perchance m’lady thought the flower A trifle to bright her morn, Reaching she, her thumb thus pierced, The bush had shown its scorn.  A cry shot out her sharp complaint, Red tears where flesh was torn. She pled the rose had stuck her so, What reason might I inform?  The answer plainly; she wished to see, Only a rose as yet unworn, Would it not serve my love far better, To see her rose a bush of thorn?

       The next time you do laundry, while you’re putting in the soap ... sloshing water, sudsy soap ... take a good look.  Life is like that.  Socks, t-shirts, underwear, all the stuff getting cleaned, rinsing out the dirt ... leaving behind in the wash-water what you want and getting rid of dirt you don’t want.  Isn’t that a lot like putting your past behind you, the mistakes, the poor decisions and poor judgment, our past issues and our mis-steps in life?  Cleansing your mind of old,  shop-worn baggage?   All our "dirty laundry".  Remember that bad stuff?  Sure, we remember them!  After all, you can’t exactly eliminate every sock, can you?  Well, you could throw them away or wait until they disappear into the Black-Hole of Missing Laundry, where all separated socks go to die.  No, we have to live with these, our soiled laundry items, and sore issues, our memories of bad and unfortunate experiences. However, if you do want to toss them out, give it a shot!  You’ll still have to drag the trashcans out to the curb in the morning.  So remember, they  will  wash.  Soap and water does wonders after all...  Isn’t this what happens during baptism?  We go down to the water to wash away our sins?  The sins  (okay, the socks),  they suddenly become whiter.  Life goes on.  You put your Yesterdays in the washtub.  Time, the soap powder of all old ills.  Laundering really does work, believe me!  Between the washing and the spin-dry, Old Man Time passes us by and goes on, with or without us.  After awhile, one day, we reach that much awaited "Final Spin" on how we dealt with all the bleakness, and then suddenly, its already Tomorrow.  The whites are somehow whiter than we ever remembered them being.  We’ve taken pains to round off the edges of hurt and injury, of betrayal and heartache, of loss and recovery.  Same old socks mind you, just a bit cleaner to look at.  We can now reflect back on our damaged lives in just this way.  The laundry room is a pretty funny place to find philosophy.  But it is a great place to separate the whites from the darks.

       I'm confused ... is this the Digital Age or the Electronic Revolution?  Did they split hairs over, "The Gaslight Era" or "The Gay 90's"?  When you take the electronic intrusion out of the equation, what's left are too many choices without much fanfare as to how to decide.  Should I have Take-Out for lunch today?  The Take-Out window has 100 other choices and you have to be fast in picking yours.  Should I embrace Reality TV or just try to dress so I'm not taken for a thong-sandled anarchist?  Do I get into Evanescence or do I let them get into me? Do I enjoy Alanis Morisett to the point of changing my gender to either get off her or onto her? Do I hold on to the deeper Enya and develop a multi-tracked voice?  (Hey ... didn't that happen to ABBA?)   Do I stick with my age-old chocolate or become newly Tic-Tac oriented,(as: I think I'll have a Tic-Tac for desert!) huh?  And finally, do I just pick up that pen scribbling thoughts on inside covers of matchbooks or fill out this funny little blog window? How many choices can the human mind process? Why does it have to be so hard?  When you're little, the biggest decision you make is: "Do I ride my way-cool bike or my little red scooter?"  Then, how many times can you ride around the block where the cute girl lives? Hopefully someone hasn't made that decision for you by stealing your bike out of your front yard. So-o-o-o; with the Digital Age, there are so many, many more decisions.  We're not talking the difference deciding between Starbuck's latte and espresso here!  We don't have time to digress or digest anymore.  We have to act impulsively ... there is no time!!!!!!  THERE IS NO TIME!!!!!!  What about the other side of that coin?  What about all the things you've decided that require no further action?  I think we call them "committments" or something.  Do I stay in love with the same old girl or fall head over heels into it with Jennifer Garner?  "What would Jen say about this", you ask!  Then there's, "Well, why can't I have both?"   Who decided that?  I want some serious face-time with that person.  God forbid, I actually try to grasp ahold of my life rather than keep griping about it.  Funny how it's always much easier to gripe, than to do something positive.  No, see, this way everything is the Wheel of Fortune, except Vanna's not any help.  "Vanna, can you decide what vowel I need please!"  Vanna would just stand there, trust me.  So here it is.  Wear Titanium underwear!  The cheep cotton ones don't hack it.  Try to put a little beauty in every moment.  Find it or do it or at least think about it some before you keel over.  Fall in love every other minute if you have to, just don't go start making plans to pick out curtains together.  Tell someone you love them, even if its a screensaver of Jen or Natalie Portman or even the poor little brown beetle you saved the life of last night, when you picked him up, and scooted him gently outside.  Point is, is it's not comin' your way anymore, dude!  This is the hard part of the hill.  You know, near enough to the crest, so it aches to put your feet out in front of one another and you're panting like a puppy on the 4th of July.  Try not to think of how it'll be when you climb up and ... and there's nothing at all to see!  Remember, it's the journey through that fast-food window that counts ... not so much what you get for your few measley dollars.  Oh - tell the service-window-gal to have a nice day, that her hair looks nice, that if you could, you'd take her far away from here to a hidden island world!  She'll laugh, snicker maybe, think you're nuts or a quacky-romantic, just another nut at the bottom of her bag of kooky-krums.  Does anyone know the name or phone number of that Vonage girl you see her picture on at: http://www.dreamwater.org/art/artkeeper/Vonage_girl.jpg  ??  I think I want to know what I know now and be 30 again.  In closing: "Why is that chick-singer of Dido's singing "White Flag" expressly to me?"
