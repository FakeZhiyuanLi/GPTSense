        Our first "unofficial" unit study will be on the 2004 Summer Olympic Games.  We will be studying every subject in regards to the olympics, Greece, gymnastics etc..  We have about two dozen books from the library on such subjects as the summer games, the Parthenon, Mary Lou Retton (winner of the gold in the 1984 summer games), Bruce Jenner (decathalon winner), Greek Mythology, Marion Jones, Olympic history.  We will also be looking at the significance of the Torch, Olga Korbut (medal winner of the 1972 summer games), Nadia Comaneci (7 perfect 10's and medal winner of the 1976 summer games), we will be listening to Nadia's song, we will explore greek food and desserts and study the globe.  While researching all of these subjects in our books we will incorporate spelling, vocabulary, math, science, history and crafts into the study.  We have made some really fun crafts to decorate around the t.v.  We made two olympic torches to go on top of the television, we have American flags hanging on the wall, we made the Olympic rings out  of colored pipe cleaners and we are hanging olympic articles on the wall.  We took the girls and two of their friends to a Greek cafe for lunch on Saturday and we made them eat Greek food (ok, so it was only a grilled cheese pita),  Michael and I were a little braver, we tried gyros.  While we were waiting for our food the girls all worked on an olympic word search puzzle that I made out of  grid paper.  There is a restaurant close by called "The Partenon" so we will take our Parthenon book with us when we go to eat another Greek meal.  I told all the girls on Saturday while we were all having a blast that this is homeschool.  We had our Tivo unit shipped to us so that we could record all the events and pause and rewind whenever we wanted to discuss something or see it again.  We are going to eat Greek desserts while we watch the games.  This is basically an introduction to the girls on what homeschooling is going to be like, and how our lives have changed.  We are having a blast.

        I am also expecting that God will be my guide. I have always prayed that if we were supposed to homeschool that God first would give me the desire and then the ability. Well, here we are. He has definitely given me the desire and a million creative ideas and I now expect that He will give me the ability to do this. When we left Florida I asked God to change me. If I had to go through this painful and emotional move then I wanted to be changed for His glory. One of the things that I have always despised within myself was the lack of discipline and diligence in my life. My heart's desire is to be stronger in both those areas. Guess what? He is changing me . The only way I will be able to successfully homeschool my daughters is to exercise more discipline (being in the Word and prayer on a more consistent basis) and diligence (sticking to what I have chosen to do). I'm sure that I will still "fly by the seat of my pants" just as I always have, but that will be the exception and not the rule to my life. I don't plan on giving up my spontaneity or spirit of fun, it will now be incorporated into our homeschool life. I can't wait to just up and announce to the girls that we are doing school in our pajamas, or guess what, we are going to do school at the pool, or who wants to blow off school today and go shopping, etc.....Please pray for me that God would direct my paths and give me discernment.

        My plan for Hannah is similar to Sarah's only in the math curriculum. Hannah will be using hands on manipulatives called "fraction layovers" and will also share the blocks with her sister. This program is designed to teach the child more critical thinking, and to give them a clear understanding of the math that they are learning and now to use it and apply it in life. I am sure she will do great. Now her other curriculum is called "Total Language Plus". This is based on the reading of a lot of literature and similarly to the math curriculum, will teach her critical thinking, make her think outside the box and come up with her own answers and ideas. Hannah's spelling, grammar, and vocabulary will also come from this language program (plus). Once again we will be doing a lot of unit studies to incorporate every area of their education. We as a family are looking forward to a lot of field trips in our RV for these unit studies (Washington D.C., Mt. Rushmore, Grand Canyon, Williamsburg, Underground RailRoad, etc.) I think Hannah is going to group spiritually and intellectually over the next year.

       My plan for Sarah is to really concentrate on her comprehension of phonics. I am starting her on a program called "Explode the Code". This should give her a firm foundation to build her reading skills on, hopefully boost her confidence so that she will fall in love with reading. It has been suggested that I don't force her to read books right now, just concentrate on the Code and give her a chance to develop her reading skills. I was told that this is basically called "delayed academics" and if we give our children a little time to get ready naturally then they will soar as soon as it clicks....kind of like potty training a toddler....you can't force them until they are ready. I also ordered her a math curriculum with manipulative blocks to teach her to understand the math that she is learning....not just memorize it. It looks fun. Those are my main two focus points for Sarah for at least the next four or five months. Then of course I will be using unit studies on all kinds of fun topics to incorporate the spelling, history, science, crafts etc....
