      my last day of work today...  spent my entire workday crying and shitting (that's right!), because i was too sad and neurotic, my stomach was fucking up on me.  i have been crying like a bitch as soon as i walked into the company, and i would start crying over something utterly utterly stupid, for instance, today i brought sugar to the company for coffee, and this guy made a comment about me being so nice for buying sugar for everyone, just like that, i started crying hysterically! so u know how much i must've cried today! i really hate crying, it makes my big nose seem even bigger (and red, too!!!), but i just can't help it, my tears are always easily triggered.  as i was walking out, larry shouted from far behind: "stop crying!"...i just wish i could.  got to spend my entire week off remastering microsoft excel, i hate that shit, i hate anything that has to do with calculations and formulas. anywayz, if u need to hang out this week, do call me!! i need to shop for business outfits, too.  ready for a new life?

      hey remember i told u about this hospital job i was interviewed for? well, i got it!!   u know i wasn't confident enough about getting the position because the entire interview process was much to complex and detail oriented..i wasn't sure if i was really on the "top of the list" as what the recruiter lady'd told me two days ago, until my general manager today got a call from the hr asking for my reference, then i knew they were really finalizing the candidates...i literally screamed when i got this call!   i told my general manager about this new job, his eyes became teary and said he never should have given that reference! as advised by everyone in my company, that i should only tell the boss on the day i leave, not prior to, because she is mad shady, who knows what kinda shit she's gonna pull&nbsp; when she finds out i am leaving. well, saying goodbye is tough, especially to those nice people who's been with u nine-to-five for 4 years. "no banquet lasts forever"   the only thingie that kinda bothers me is the travelling, it's crazy! :) but my meager little wish is just to work happily, that's all. i hope i can make it there.   BTW. WHO EVER READS THIS WILL NEED TO BUY ME DINNER AS CELEBRATION, YOU, YOU AND YOU, YOU KNOW WHO U ARE!

      my gal becky is 6-week pregnant! so happy she's finally decided to keep the baby, and i am the registered god mother! although it is 10 months away, but still i'm very very excited because it's the closest experience i have for ever being a mom! everyday i can see her changes, such as increasingly compulsive eating behavior (we called it ICEB, heheh), dramatic mood change over some chicken shits, all that exhausion and sickness...it must be tough. being chinese, i know the extreme importance about the month prior/post to the delivery, but it is hard for an american to&nbsp; understand it.   today's pauline's last day of work, very happy for her to get out of this hellish place. she is opening up a restaurant in whitestone some day next&nbsp;month,&nbsp;she said if i ever visit that place, she will give me free drinks and 50% on everything else, lovely!&nbsp;   just finished watching&nbsp;an old school kung-fu movie for i guess the 10th time, strange as i am, i feel safe&nbsp;and protected by&nbsp;repeatedly watching movies that i am&nbsp;familiar with.&nbsp;in my house i have countless collections of kung fu related movies and tv shows, it would surely be hard to save myself from my own torment if living without these old movies.   i feel i am turning this board into an old lady blah blah place, totally aimless. check out keith's blogboard, his funny, prolific messages are my inspiration for writing my own bullshit :) it's good to spit it sometimes, my old shrink from teenage years used to say so.

      it's monday!!!  the recruiter lady at the hospital (the one i'd been interviewed for) asked me to fax her a copy of my recommendation letter. the gm at my company is mad cool with me, so he wrote it exactly as how i'd wanted it to be, self motivated, highly organized, pleasant to work with, no excessive absences (which is totally bs,&nbsp; just think about how many fridays i've left work early because of the so called "women's monthly cramp", which all coincidently happened on nearly every friday, heheh.) however, after i faxed, i called the recruiter lady to confirm receipt,&nbsp;she confimed it, and conveniently told me that i was "on very top of their list"..yeah yeah yeah, like it means shit.  imagine i can't find a job and gonna get stuck here for another 4 freakin' years? then please drive a car and run me over.

       urlLink     ray is taking some girls to a scenic spot, so he came to me for suggestions. pete and i are nature loving people, the first places on my list were: sand's point somewhere in long island, oakland lake in bayside and oyster bay.   apparantly one of&nbsp;my girlfriends anita did not enjoy sand's point at all, she is&nbsp;such a metroplitan girl who sees&nbsp;no&nbsp;beauty in "unpolished beauty" hehehe.. hey when it comes to natural scenic places, i can probably name a whole bunch, but no matter what, central park is definitely out of my list, it's all man-made, deliberately reconstructed for human convenience and interests. what a turn-off.   &nbsp;

      lovely day today,  the cool breeze sweeps away all undesirable stress that a regular sunday would bring, it is good to feel emotionless sometimes, don't you think?   called dad today, as usual we spoke about chinese calligraphy, world politics and how a decent human being should act when facing various situations...urged him to see a doctor if he felt anything wrong, of course, i pretended i didn't know anything about his decling health as advised by mom.   taking a two day off from sending resumes, starting a new job is painful, like falling in love in the first couple of weeks, must get used to that person's logics, hidden intentions, even&nbsp;the bodily scents.   how does burden-free feel like i often reckon?

      i have given this website so far to anita and ray, therefore i must keep it up~~well, at least for another week or so..man just realized all number keys on my keyborad are dead, shit.  anywayz, back to today..my day did not really start until ray picked me up, pete'd left early, so i was stuck in my house alone, having absolutely nothing to eat in the house..so hungry i wanted to make myself a coffee, but then realized the milk powder was expired two years ago. ray was totally late by two hours, pissed off hungry, so i ordered&nbsp;two medium pies plus two side orders to be delivered to my crib..well my happiness finally started with a satisfying burp.  went to ray's for a fun game called "eye toy", sort of like the famous dance machine game except it uses hands, i played hardcore and sweated like a motherf.cker..anita played so all-over-the-place like there's no tomorrow....anywayz, i shall end my bull shit here, tomorrow we are taking pete's dad out to oyster bay, love that place~

      dearest friend kai after two years of job hunting has finally settled with an excellent one...he invited 5 of us to dinner: lazybuddy, serena, me, and charles. at first i thought we were going to this fancy japanese all-u-can-eat, but turned out that dumb dumb lazybuddy suggested a korean bbq place on northern...what the hell was he thinking? in door bbq in a hot summer night?? i didn't touch any meat at all, all i had was grilled mushrooms...at first the atmosphere was a little frozen because not everybody knew each other. hey but things started to change after i came back holding a raw sardine in my plate! it looked so pretty when i was holding it, i thought i was the coolest girl in the restaurant! so five of us ended up grilling that poor fish together, topped it with onions, scallions and oranges! but in the end it tasted really nasty so we forced lazybuddy to take it in....holy cow.

      after 4 years of stable employment, today i went to my first ever interview!   i was interviewed for the position of assisting this doctor who is the chairman of the board. oh man the whole process was dreadful! i was totally interviewed by&nbsp;4 different peeps separately, first this old recruiter lady who sat down with me to discuss about the job requirements and all that crap, then i was led to a nice looking man in his private office, he asked many questions about my current job and told me about the pensions, benefits, vacations..etc, then later on met with another old lady who was said to be the secretary of i-can't-remember..two hours passed, finally i was brought to the operation room for dr.bendo for the final confrontation. overall, i think i did okay.   they are supposed to notify me yes or no by end of next week..not that crazy about that position and the environment, which is incoveniently located in downtown downtown brooklyn on clarkson near flatbush avenue, quite of a rough neighborhood, on top of that, the commute time was unbelievable, gotta take the #2 train all the way down to the final few stops..in addition, the hospital facility is seemingly undesirable. but if i am really given the chance to work there, i'd still go for it just to get out of my current job. oh yeah, the salary was so-so, not even close to what i am getting now, but for a young person like me, it'd be silly for me to only look at what's in front of me at present time, rather than considering the whole big picture ahead of me.   ps. i'm supposed to be the assistant/spokesperson for dr.bendo who is the head director&nbsp;of the anesthesia department. b4 the interview, the word anesthesia just wasn't in my very limited vocabulary! i told the guard i was heading toward the " anastasia"  floor (u got it! it's one of disney's animations), he just didn't quite get it...

       changing ur job means a fresh start, but being a newbie really really sucks!  the doctor has started to give me tons and tons of work to do, which i don't mind, because i usually work fast. but not knowing anything about medical related can be a pain~ and this doc i work for has a tendency of giving ambiguous instructions, as if i've been working for her for 10 years or something, but u don't wanna keep asking because she is always in a rush. so today i stayed late trying to figure out what exactly she was saying about my assignments..phew~  god damn cable is down, can't watch the olympics! so i watch kung fu even more now, because that's all i've got. :(  the hr guy told me i am on a monthly payroll, fuck! getting paid only once a month? fuck!

       was chatting with janice pleasantly on the phone last night, she said she will be starting a new job next month, it's also in brooklyn, and she has to be there at 8am, which means she has to get up every morning at 5am, even worse than me! that just made me feel so much better~      i must look on the bright side about finding things to do during the everyday 2 hour train ride, although i never get enough sleep, i can never fall asleep on the train-just too alerted. now i have started to read the front section of the newspaper (before it was to be tossed away), instead of reading *only* the arts and metro sections. the biggest flaw about american papers is that they never have enough celebrity gossips, unlike chinese papers, always dedicate at least 8 entire pages to star gossips, categorized by different regions. that's what we called "news"; news of all sorts, okay?      saw dr.bendo today for the first time as she came back from vacation, terribly nervous, she seems a bit compulsive, i hope i can live up to her standards.

       i used to make fun of those doctors who always insist on being called doctors, or who never fail to put "m.d." next to their names in whatever they write. after seeing how these prospective doctors are brutally tortured by the system, i must say i now give them a lot of credit for being doctors. they surely deserve all the respect out there :)      u know i am in charge of the routines of all 63 medical students in anesthesia (we call them the residents), and i came in just in time to work on their vacations for next school year, man i'm telling u, it is a monster! because only certain amounts of residents from each level are allowed to take vacations in the same period, and everyone of them has such a tight schedule to work with, it's extremely difficult to arrange their vacation~ why i said these residents are brutally tortured? well, not only they have to work 80 hours a week, on top of work, there's tons of study, and they have to be on-call during late nights. although these people have 4 week vacation each year, but sadly they don't get to choose the time, instead, it is assigned by us, today a resident came to office to "beg" me to have his vacation time switched, because he has to attend his sister's wedding in brazil, my svp then stepped in and explained to him that only under these 3 circumstances would the vacation be allowed to change: 1. you mother dies 2. your father dies 3. you r getting married. my svp then ended his inquiry by asking :"which one do u think is more important? the medical school or ur sister's wedding?"      today i was introduced to all the residents in a lecture hall during their weekly colloquium, i was kinda nervous, gladly i dressed pretty today :) and i was wearing my "glasses of confidence", i even remembered to suck in my tummy! sigh~after two dreadful sleepless nights, finally i was really able to get some sleep last night-feeling refreshed again!

       thank u all for ur concern! i am doing okay with the new workplace~  just that i am still trying to get my body adjusted to getting up and going to bed early-used to be the other way around just a few weeks ago.  nothing much to do actually, which is a bless. but u know pretty much all the people in the world think they've got the most stressful job..like my spv keeps complaining about not being able to get her work done, but she doesn't seem that busy! so one day i pulled my chair next to her and watched how she performed..hmm..no wonder she could not get her work done, she is a computer moron! today she downloaded an attachment from email to her computer, after she made changes to the attachment, she then CLOSED it, later on she wanted to access that file again, so she actually went back to the email and downloaded the file again, then she SCREAMED: "why is it that all the changes were not saved???" my goodness! so i was kind enough to explain to her about what happened using the plainest language, but she just would not get it...eventually she ended her own confusion by saying: "oh well, the computer has a mind of its own"...anyway, so i asked her to do the changes again and i sucessfully saved the file for her..man no wonder she cannot get the work done.  on the stress level scale of 1-10, my ex workplace would be a 20, and i would give this place a 0.5. besides the work, people seem to be nice there. i wish i can get my hands on things fast, so i can stop volunteering myself to do those kindergarden stuff like making photocopies and filing documents..  hehhe pete is buying that gold swatch for me this weekend! (heheh keith don't frown)    ps. stole this website from keith(  urlLink  http://cokecat.blogspot.com/   ), pretty interesting~    urlLink  http://www.intellectualwhores.com/masterladder.html

       my last day of weekend!!  pete advised me about not showing attitutes to those people from new work, excuse me? i am the biggest ass kisser in the world! don't u know it by now? well, in my very first day, i will be performing the overwhelming ass-kissing to EVERYONE, including the janitor HAHAHHAA, because at that time u still don't know who the key person is besides ur boss, but by next week i should be able to narrow down the ass kissing lists a bit. i will then try to pretend to be "hungry for knowledge"( oh, teach me! teach me!), patient, and even somewhat "vulnerable"...too bad i have to perform these operations all over again, like playing a dating game; during the first few dates i eat so little in front of that guy, but after 1 week or so, i begin to chew on a cow before the guy's eyes.

       hmm..just trying to enlighten u guys with some numbers:      according to the 2003 census, no surprise, the asian is rated the highest in education by comparing with other ethnic groups.      for those who completed high school:   87.4% asian   84.9% european   49.1% latino      for those who completed bechelors or higher   asian 50%   european 35.4%   latino 11.6%      for those who entered the professional or executive fields   47% asian   41.3% european   12.7% latino      finally, we also have the highest incomes, of course, according to the result, 53.8% of asian earn over $50k per year, pretty impressive right?      oh by the way, u know the movie "open water" which is coming soon to theaters, is directed by a chinese lady? (well, it's done by husband &amp; wife, and the wife is chinese) ((the lady's last name is "LAU", like "ANDY LAU's LAU", heheh)), and the entire movie was made via a handheld camera, sort of like the famous "the blare witch project"..speaking of which, the whole movie i waited and waited to be scared, but in the end, i got nothing, except for tired muscles for waiting too long to be scared.

       YEAH!!!! there are 20 ppl on my counter now!! that truly deserves a celebration!! (although i bet half of it comes from me..)  alice, ray, janice, john, tianji, shirley and i all gathered together to "celebrate" joyce's leaving to TN this coming thursday. seven of us went to my favorite dining place in oyster bay called "tiki bar". it's outdoor, with a great ocean and sky view, the best place to go to especially during sunset, absolutely beautiful. the whole atmosphere was fun and relaxing, enough to put a perfect ending to my 1 week in-between-jobs break. see, that's what is so bad about chilling with old friends, which makes u feel lazy to develop other friendships elsewhere. those people just know u so well to the bone, there's really nothing that cannot be said or done. for example, if i want to go to the bathroom in the middle of a discussion, i could just simply say: "i wanna take a shit", rather than: "oh, excuse me, i need to use the lady's room". fuck that.  after the dinner around 9ish, called up lazy and keith trying to catch the second round, well, instead of drinking and chatting at the SAGO place (a place full of skinny bitches which really makes me feel like an elephant!!!), i suggested ray's so i could get myself some drinks, because i knew that keith and lazy would never ever go to a bar with me!! and it is absolutely impossible for me to start my weekend without a few drinks-although later on i just became a totally different person after a few rounds of mixed drinks, good that i didn't seem to surprise anybody there, they've all seen me wilding out ever since high school. some people never change...only for the worse.  keith is also leaving too, and he is really leaving for real :( :( it has been good knowing u as a great great friend, u know it is hard to meet a friend like this during ur adulthood. it was such a short time but we certainly had our "connection" heheh. although we won't be seeing each other as often, but i will certainly be seeing u A LOT on msn, that's for sure. :) GOOD LUCK!!       P.S. so pathetic i forgot to pay my credit card again!!!! the fines are sky rocketing!! so now i've made the credit card page into my wallpaper and startup webpage, see i'm pretty smart right? :)

       wrote an email to the orange bus system, it goes something like this:      "after my long term obeservation which involves anger and disappointment, you have finally achieved the goal in becoming the worst bus system in the entire state of new york, for your outstanding performances in absolute untimeliness, and the indecent professionalism toward customers. Please keep up the good work and I shall move to a different neighborhood where your services are not needed. Thank you."        @6:14 pm while i was pleasantly engaged in grocery shopping, i received a phone call from a girl who called from JETRO, one of the very first companies i sent my resume to. it is conveniently located as close as two blocks away from my house, even closer than trisonic. strangely they waited 1 month to call me, i believe that's how american people handle their routines; slow, slow, slow..the interview is scheduled to be held on tuesday, although i already took a job offer, i still said yes anyhow, just in case if something goes wrong on monday (my first day in the hospital). as i said, salary isn't a factor, it is the room for advancement that holds the key.      wow writing in different colors is awesome!!!

      i overheard a stupid news today;  an old lady filed a complaint against her neighbor for wearing a shirt all year long with a marijuana leaf and next to it reads: I AM A DEALER. the cops showed up this morning and raided his house, and turned out he was in fact a dealer, also a farmer who doesn't grow corn, but other stuff, u know. on tv they blurred out his face but kept the shirt because the shit was funny.  oh man how can anyone be this retarded?? i think all these stupid idiots out there should look up to him as a role model.  had a wonderful afternoon with keith in the city today. first i went to dim sum with joy in the morning, she just came back from tw, and told me she'd run into mad stars on the streets, she'd even met one in an amusement park!!! how lucky! so i spend the entire dim sum time asking about those stars, like if they really had big boobs and flawless skins..man that gossip was hot! then immediately rushed to st.marks to team up with keith, didn't do much tho, well, except for the "massive walk", we started from st.marks then walked along broadway then to chinatown, after we were through with chinatown, one of us suggested to walk backwards....geez no one can look pretty in such a muggy weather like today's, good thing that we are going to the met tomorrow, i can pretend to be artistic for just one day if they blast the AC hard enough.

      i had a full day today! well, i slept and slept until 1:30pm, then i woke up and cooked something for myself, after watching tv for an hour, i went back to sleep again! this time didn't wake up until 5ish, then quickly i dressed up to go back to my ex company to get my paycheck and also to have dinner with 7 of my former co-workers: lily, tommy, chi, leng, albert, rebecca, and hermia.  the dinner was fun, but i wasn't digging the food tho. we went to this chinese hotpot place on main street..man to me eating hotpot in a hot, steamy summer night is a bit too much, but whatever, they were treating anyway :) one thing about hanging out with ur coworkers is that there isn't too much to talk about except for talking and complaining about the work, since i am out of the game already, i wasn't really participating anymore, my mind was somewhere else. in the end leng invited to her house next weekend, i said of course, but will i really go? don't know if u understand how i feel; well when we used to work together, we had the same enemy (the boss), and we fend the fort together, now that i have a new job, we are left with nothing else in common, so what is going to hold us together in the future? everytime i think of this i feel sad, but i guess that is how life goes.  however, i have another dinner arrangement with another group of co workers, heheheh, my popularity is just unstoppable!

      ray, wayne and anita were going to the jersey garden mall, and asked me if i wanted to tag along, actually they didn't need to ask, why would i ever say no to shopping?  the traffic was more than just slow, it PAUSED. this black car in front of us was so freaking slow which made the idling traffic even worse! one of the reasons why i never drive is because i'd be a furious driver; at one point i actually opened the door and tried to walk to front to tell that guy to move his fucking ass! but ray stopped me because i think my violence shocked the girl sitting in the back, well i forgot her name by now, but she is a tourist who came with anita. that girl asked anita:"does everyone in new york act like her?" no sweetie, if i were the direct representation of all new yorkers, new york would've been a warzone.  okay, the shopping part was rather normal, so i am gonna skip it and jump right to my next program...met up with keith, serena and lazybuddy, the usual crew for dinner, lots of chatting and shit talking, then we proceeded to the movie:the bourne supremacy...another matt damon's "not-only-i-am-cute-i-am-immortal" or "after-many-fights-still-no-scar-in-my-face" movies. a typical guyish movie i reckon; totally action packed, but with an uncomplicated story. i think i've complained wayyy too much tonite. anyway, it was a fun night, totally hung out with the right peeps!  just found out joy came back, greeeeaat! another person to hang with in my time off~~
