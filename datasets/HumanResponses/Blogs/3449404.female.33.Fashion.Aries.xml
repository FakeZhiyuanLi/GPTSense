      First off I would like to express my heartfelt appologies to Sunza.  I am very sorry and would like to let you know that I do care.  Now onto the other stuff.  I screwed up again, lol, no surprises there.  That will teach me to talk to ppl online when I am inserting a CPU into a Motherboard.  I put it in the wrong one and snapped off 4 pins.  1 dead CPU, sh1t.  Dad found out and is on the warpath for me, guess I had best lay low for a day or 2.  On a Side Note I found my Seal CD's so I am happy, got some nice music to listen to.  Killer is by far the best he has done IMHO.  SDaw Van Helsing the other day, ownage film.  I want to be a werewolf, they look cool.  That is all for now.

      Millwall lost 3-0 but that isn't the point.  Point is I (and the rest of the fans) had a great day out.  Considering it was their FIRST EVER Final they did pretty good.  Anyway, enough of all that, Lisa spent a grand total of Â£500 (shock horror)...on 2 pairs of shoes, 3 dresses & nice handbag (also some lacy undies ;)).  OZONE - Dragost Din Tei (got to be my fave song today and yesterday too it seems)# Metallica - Sanitarium  (hell cool song, get it) Metallica - Fade To Black (song for the moment) Camel - Stationary Traveller (if you need to relax or practice your guitar skills this is for you) Barenaked Ladies - Another Postcard (Chimpanzees)  (a must for a good laugh) C&C Red Alert - Hell March (too cool for it's own good)  Here are a few Lyrics to inspire you...  Life it seems, will fade away Drifting further every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters no one else I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free  Things are not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly lost, this can't be real Cannot stand this hell i feel Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony Growing darkness taking dawn I was me, but now he's gone  No one but me can save myself, but it's too late Now i can't think, think why i should even try  Yesterday seems as though it never existed Death greets me warm, now i will just say good-bye    PS: I love you Jess!!!

      I'm in Cardiff tomorrow, watching the Millwall vs Man U FA Cup Final.  Good mood today, I joined the Priesthood.  Yea I know what you must be thinking, well think again because.....I am a volunteer Priest in the CoS (Church of Satan).  Our local priest is ill and will be in hospital for a few weeks so I am taking over :D  Today my most listened to songs are: Barenaked Ladies - Who Needs Sleep (thanks to Katie) George Michael - Amazing OZONE - Dragoste Din Tei (thanks to Jess) Our Lady Peace - Not Enough (thanks to Taylor) Camel - Stationary Traveller (courtesy of Michael) Boyz II Men - End Of The Road (courtesy of my Mum) Sarah Connor - Bounce (thanks to Katie)  Today I have had great fun, spent a few hours with Jason downing shots and playing poker (I lost as usual).  I haven't seen Lisa for 2 days, no biggie, she is going up to Cardiff with me, except she will be shopping (with my credit card *gulps*) but we will link up after the game.   Lame Excuse of the year (so far): "i'm not ready to be in a relationship right now" next day she is with Joe & still is, lame excuse or what???  Ant

      Well, first post so I guess I had best lay the groundwork.  This is to help those that don't know me & some that do to understand me better.

On Saturday I am going to Cardiff to watch the Millwall vs Man U FA Cup Final so am looking forward to that a lot.

Katie keeps my head in the clouds so I am constantly walking into things, Today it was 2 doors & a wall.  I will warn you all that some blogs might just be me posting my fave song's lyrics so if I do that, bear with me and download that song to hear the words in action.  Thats all for now, catch ya all later.  Ant

      Passion is a beautiful creature.  It is graceful, carefree & desirable.  Can you feel passion?  Can you feel the love in your heart?  Love and Pain are combined.  To love is to admit pain.  Pain & Pleasure are also combined, can you feel pleasure in pain?  I don't have much to say at the moment, but....I have recently joined a Clan on Operation Flashpoint.  Clan [sT] aka Stormtroopers.  http://www.stormtroopers.ch

      Well, I was playing Kings of Chaos until today.&nbsp; One of my officers deserted me to join my enemy.&nbsp; If that is how friends treat me then I don't want any.&nbsp; It's not just that sghe deserted, but she had to rub my nose in it, that was not nice, not nice at all.&nbsp; Right now I do not care about anything, life sucks, love sucks, everything sucks.  &nbsp;  It is at times like these that I get out my boxing gloves and beat the living hell out of my bag again.&nbsp; I am not going to, i'm just going to bathe in the anger, in the hatred for my fellow human beings.&nbsp; Why can't people be honest about things?&nbsp; What I wanted yesterday I no longer want, and what I want today I won't want tomorrow.  &nbsp;  SOil - Obsession  SOil - Love Hate Game  PanterA - I'm Broken  Godsmack - I Stand Alone  Ozzy Osbourne - Suicide Solution  Puff Daddy &amp; Faith - I'll Be Missing You  Linkin Park - Lying From You  KoRn - Falling Away From Me  Metallica - Fade To Black  Metallica - Sanitarium  Our Lady Peace - Life    urlLink http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=GRS8BSE&amp;key=TMV

        Lying on my back on a railway   Looking at the sky and its full moon  In the back of my head I feel the rumbling wheels  Shaking my memories  It's getting darker and darker and darker  My hands are frozen and steam comes out of my mouth  As I whisper my last words  Seem to fade away   [Chorus:] The train is moving forward and closer  Can't stand up and walk away  Once I made my mind up so long ago  Now I can't change  It is just too bad   I feel so left alone, so forgotten  Nobody knows where I am, no one misses me  Cold water runs from my eyes  And the cold is freezing my last tears  Like I'm only half in my body, I can't feel  I think I'm already half gone, I can't think  It's getting colder and colder and colder  I can't breathe   [Chorus:]  Cold metal - burning in my back  Cold cold metal - freezing  Cold cold metal - my head will burst open  Cold cold metal - it's been too much   Cold Metal - Ambeon     I feel so cold, so alone has everything in my life been for nothing?  A part of me wants to believe that is not true but there is a part of me that will always be there telling me that the negative is the positive.  Why am I still trying?  A part of me is still stronger than steel never willing to give up - always reaching for my goals and all that life can offer - a part of me just wants to let the cold enter and give me the frostbite that will keep the pain away - I am so tired of this struggle all I ask is for the chance to be happy why must that always be so far out of my reach?     Beautiful red  beautiful red blood is leaving my veins  running out of my hands  dripping on the floor  I'm bleeding and it feels good like my release finally arrived beautiful red is surrounding me no threats, no fears, just free at last  beautiful red blood is fading to black  no I cannot see, I'm losing my life beautiful red is all I can see suffocating, I cannot breath falling, I cannot stand no regrets, facing my death  beautiful red  dripping down  drip drip, losing my beautiful red just a body dripping to death, just a soul, finding it's way no regrets, I'll see my friends again  beautiful red blood is what I've seen pain in my life is what I've felt hate for stupid is what I've shown I lived my life and now I'm gone  beautiful red  dripping down  Ambeon - Beautiful Red

       Rofl....*ouch*...bloody hell - Is everyone around me giving up?  First actual communication with soon to be ex husband and I get the above - WTF? We have not even seen each other in over 2 years and only very brief phone conversations to try to get the seperation papers rolling.    Dare to live, dare to follow your heart, dare to find your path and never look back and you will have your reason to live - there is no courage in dying - choose death and you extinguish the fire within - you choose to give up - hypocrytical statement? perhaps but I lived through an attempt I should not have - I will never take my life for granted again.  I feel as though I am being put through a test of strength - why must it be now?  There are still days where I barely have strength enough to hold myself up much less everyone around me - but if I am needed I will be there if it is my tenacity that is needed by my friends and loved ones than it will always be there - I will take it from wherever I can draw it from and give what I can.  There is always hope, there is always love - there is always something to reach for.    Even in the fog of darkness I found one man - and my heart is safe in his hands as his is safe in mine.     Angel of the night In my mind you're by my side See you - wherever you are I feel you're touching my skin The time stands still just for us Without you there's no hope in my darkness  You give me the moment Which is never ending Let me feel your heart And I'll go with you to the end of this world  My angel of the night I'm forever by your side fly with me to eternity hold me in your arms and kiss me I close my eyes and dream with you Carry me so far away Never let me down and kiss me  Angel of the night Unite in one soul You lead me on the way, the way of our shadows Show me your burning desire I follow you I follow you into the garden of pleasures   Angel of the Night - Blutengel

        I wish I could breath, I wish I could stand.  I wish I had a chance here holding your hand.  Wish I could speak, I wish could talk  I wish I could breath   Since the first day, I was alive,  I feared we would meet here in the misty outside  I wanted to run, I wanted to hide  I wish I could breath   I fear I can't over come this place  I know your face, your hands  I wish I could breath.   I feel a chill deep in my bones,  Nothing can heal, the way my blood moans.  Nothing can quench, My bitter thirst  I wish I could breathe.   I grasp at my heart, That burns in my chest,  It's your precious art, That makes my soul stressed.  I run short of blood, light headed I swoon.  I wish I could breathe.  Breathe - Abney Park     There is no need of words when pain can be felt in every song - they are superfluous - although I did almost choose Trapped Under Ice.     Life it seems, will fade away  Drifting further every day  Getting lost within myself  Nothing matters no one else  I have lost the will to live  Simply nothing more to give  There is nothing more for me  Need the end to set me free   Things are not what they used to be  Missing one inside of me  Deathly lost, this can't be real  Cannot stand this hell I feel  Emptiness is filling me  To the point of agony  Growing darkness taking dawn  I was me, but now He's gone   No one but me can save myself, but its too late  Now I can't think, think why I should even try  Yesterday seems as though it never existed  Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye   Fade to Black - Metallica

       My soul is burning but the chill of dying love is whirling around me - trying to find an entrance - I have no armor - no defences left I have no more will to fight for something that I no longer feel.  I have chosen a different path...there is one I wish to walk with me if he chooses but it cannot be you.  You have let this happen, you have watched the disintegration for months - you still choose to fight when there is nothing left to fight for.    You tried to clip my wings but they have regrown.  I am stronger, wiser and more free than ever before and I need the freedom to explore every realm of possibility.     When the dark wood fell before me And all the paths were overgrown When the priests of pride say there is no other way I tilled the sorrows of stone  I did not believe because I could not see Though you came to me in the night When the dawn seemed forever lost You showed me your love in the light of the stars  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me  Then the mountain rose before me By the deep well of desire From the fountain of forgiveness Beyond the ice and fire  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me  Though we share this humble path, alone How fragile is the heart Oh give these clay feet wings to fly To touch the face of the stars  Breathe life into this feeble heart Lift this mortal veil of fear Take these crumbled hopes, etched with tears We'll rise above these earthly cares  Cast your eyes on the ocean Cast your soul to the sea When the dark night seems endless Please remember me Please remember me  Loreena McKennitt-Dante's Prayer

        Beauty is truth, truth beauty, a thing of beauty is a joy for ever. John Keats     Pity that there is so little truth in my life right now....caught in confusion twisted around in circles by what is real and unreal - I can still Love that is a Truth, I can still Dare that is a Truth, And I still have the Courage (or Stupidity) depending on how you look at it to risk everything on my desires.     Soul receives from soul that knowledge, therefore not by book nor from tongue.  If knowledge of mysteries come after emptiness of mind, that is illumination of heart. Rumi     Reaching out with everything I have needing to touch, needing to know that everything I feel is returned - When the real world meets will everything still hold true?  The fire rages inside me igniting me but not consuming me - I need to quench this thirst and feed this hunger burning within - passion must meet passion two souls aflame with desire and fueled by love.     Love under the linden tree      Be my druidess Be my everything Be my druidess Be mine  Around the Pyre, a circle of thirteen Thoughout these woods, ecstatic screams I look deeply into your eyes I smell your hair, caress your thighs  Now we'll make love by fire light A blaze so high it lights the night Long fingernails dug in my skin Yourself so wet invites me in  Our lust increased feeds desire As we combust, yeah we on fire I feel you shake so deep inside O oh scream my name and hold me tight  I'll do anything to make you come  Type O Negative - Be my Druidess

       I smash the glass into my face Cutting through to my disgrace Disregard for bone and flesh How can I be in such a mesh of unlikeliness? I smash my likeness  At my fingertips With this blade turned in on me Cutting an ancient tree A cutter in a forest of industry Upturning usurping  Love me Hate me Help me Save me from me Hold me Hurt me Stop me Take this love out me  Anger tinged with sadness It's always been like this Place the dagger 'twixt my breast My nearest and dearest I hurt it I hurt me Hurt everything around me There's nothing no trace Still cutting to find the place  Love out me! Love out me!  Anger tinged with sadness It's always been like this No nothing no one no more No no no no I can't take this  Love me Hate me Help me Save me from me Hold me Hurt me Stop me Take this love out me!  Love out me! Love out me!  Siouxsie And The Banshees - Love Out Me    When it rains it just has to fucking pour - still no financing - R is so unstable that it is difficult for me to hold on to what strengh I have - I keep digging and digging - deeper and deeper - I think I'm scraping my baby toes now.  Only good thing this morning is that I finally reached my ex husband well technically still husband but we have been seperated for quite some time.  Seperation papers are ready to go he just has to have them notorized on his end - send them to me I do the same - we file and hey presto 8 years of my life down the fucking drain.  Although I try not to dwell on the ending of our marriage I can't help but be very thankful we did not have kids.  We had some amazing times together but once again I had someone lie to me right from the beginning about interests so when I decided to get back into the scene all hell broke loose around me.  Now I'm repeating the pattern with R why can't the truth be told at the beginning?  There are other women to be with, to fuck, to lie to in order to get them into bed why does it have to be me?  3 years of my life.....choking down my needs - trying to explore different things with him and then getting no feedback - For almost 8 months now he makes me cringe when he touches me - I need to be honest with him I need to tell him so he can move on but I am afraid to do that alone - He has become so violent and angry that I never know from day to day what is going to happen - What I did with his cc may have been a little over the top but I *did* have his permission - I never gave my consent to be physically or verbally abused - It is over, done, finished it will end - the only question is how to handle it.  I need to love who I wish to love - with no conditions attached the only thing I ask is honesty - I need my lover or lovers to support me emotionally -rofl - it might be financial for a month or two as well - I need to have space for myself without someone stomping off in a tantrum because I am working.  I can only be me and if that is not enough then it is best to move on.    My heart is leading me to a new path one that is unknown but feels safe - it feels right whatever may happen I will know that we had the courage to try.  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Flames in the Garden of Eden Heaven in pieces at my feet I faced the raging ruin Of a million sleepless nights I need to rest my weary head On your resurrection bed  Storms across the horizon Whirlwind tuggin' at my sleeve Just when my heart was turning To an icy shade of blue You came into the night Held me so close How the hell ya found me God only knows  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lies in the Valley of Evil Like shadows fallin' 'cross my eyes When there's no santuary You came and turned the storms away You made the darkest night in my life Into Judgement Day  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  I see forever in your eyes For your love I would make any sacrifice, yeah  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lead me into temptation Save me with your healing hands Show me the fires of creation Baby be my holy man  Lita Ford - Holy Man

       Even though it feels like I am fighting a constant uphill battle - I am still determined to make this work - decisions have been made now I just need to find a way to make them happen - I won't give up now I have already done so much to start this & love is helping to keep the dream alive.  Behold the heart of mine in flames A top the highest mountain Below the darkest depths In the valley of hate I wander My frost bitten heart is set ablaze, set ablaze  Ravage my soul Plunder my mind Branded by thunder, fire and ice  Trampled in fury by hordes of the light I am crushed by the hand of my sky My sky has forsaken me  Rivers of crimson lead me now Trail of fire In a place of fire eternal Left in flames  Scattered in a world of thorns Torn from my earthly self Aggrieved in tears and bitterness I fall beyond stars, beyond stars  Ravage my soul Plunder my mind Branded by thunder, fire and ice Trampled in fury by hordes of the light My fiery heart is stronger than ever It's stronger than ever before  My heart in flames  In Flames   The air tastes just like you, it's the smell of june A sensory shock that jolts my spirit, i slowly swallow you A spray of little droplets, a fragrance so refined The spirit of nostalgia is passing me by  Opium and poison, jasmine and rose Dream of ambrosia, all flavours glow, it's sensual,it's sensual, sensual  It all began so easy, with you on the floor Against your willing flanks and knocking down your door Until the day it crumbled, no game of win and lose You told me nothing, you left me confused  Expelled like poison, a trim of the dose, A limb disposed of, in a whim she chose,so rigorous,she's vigorous  She's vigorous,  Heart of the hardest world, it's just the thought of you All those variations, the air is full of you The smell of summer rain, once more the scent of june This sweet concentration ,brings me back to you Opium and poison My taste of june, my taste of you Inhale, inhale your trail Opium and poison, jasmine and rose, dream of escape with me, all flavours go, It's sensual, it's sensual, it's sensual  What was ours will drift away, a simple breeze on a humid day  Oh, nothing lasts, nothing lasts, forever   Clan of Xymox - Jasmine & Rose

       The prey of the beast screamed Bloody murder The line is so fine between Hoping and hurting Former believers they beg for release As love looking down on them Smiles and picks his teeth Trapped in between heaven and hell He knows all the secrets And donât want to tell Thereâs nowhere to run and thereâs Nowhere to hide Love knows you all too well He will find you  Love is the ghost haunting your head Love is the killer you thought Was your friend Love is the creature who lives In the dark Sneaks up, will stick you And painfully pick you apart  Love is a poet, love sings the songs Pointing his finger you follow along Voice are calling, The monster wants out of you Paws you and claws you, you try not to fall  Love is the leech, sucking you up Love is a vampire, drunk on your blood Love is the beast that will Tear out your heart Hungrily lick it and Painfully pick it apart  Love is a ghost, haunting your head Love is the killer you thought Was your friend Love is the teacher who lives in the dark Sneak up and stick you And painfully pick you apart    Concrete Blonde - The Beast

Love is the driving force - love for others, love for yourself, love of live, love can be pure passion and desire it can take you to heights never known before and it can drive you lower than you ever thought you could go - in the end all you have is you and the honesty that should always remain - love is not a game, love is not a weapon - love is an emotion that can rule your life and should never be given carelessly or to the unworthy  adulation, affection, allegiance, amity, amorousness, amour, appreciation, ardency, ardor, attachment, case, cherishing, crash, crush, delight, devotedness, devotion, emotion, enchantment, enjoyment, fervor, fidelity, flame, fondness, friendship, hankering, idolatry, inclination, infatuation, involvement, like, liking, lust, mad for, mash, partiality, pash, passion, piety, rapture, regard, relish, respect, sentiment, soft spot, taste, tenderness, the hots, weakness, wild for, worship, yearning, zeal  Love will feed the fire of desire and allow your passion to burn bright, hot and true.  When you feel true love for another there is no mistaking it - it is better to follow your heart and allow yourself to live then it is to stay static and always wonder what could have been. Love me forever,or not at all, End of our tether, backs to the wall, Give me your hand, Don't you ever ask why, Promise me nothing, live 'till we die,  Everything changes, Live all stays the same, Everyone guilty, no one to blame, Every way out, Brings you back to the start, Everyone dies To break somebody's heart, We are the system, we are the law, We are corruption,worm in the core, One of another, laugh'til you cry, Faith unto death or knife in the eye. [Repeat]  Love me or leave me, tell me no lies, Ask me no questions, send me no spies, You know love's a thief, Steal your heart in the night, Slip through your fingers, You best hold on tight.  Doro Pesch and Lemmy

       I wanted to live on top of a mountain but it's cold and forsaken there without you now  I wanted to dive into the ocean of love but I got shipwrecked on the shores of broken dreams  For you I sang songs of the nightswan and each line I wrote was a beat of my heart  Forever burning on love's funeral pyre: Stop beating now, my bleeding heart! For this knife did cut too deep so for the last time I'm trying not to breathe  Once there was a fire in the lighthouse of my heart: I gave you so much more than just my love and you broke so much more than just a promise  Our planet vanished so devastatingly amongst the mists of time There was no treasure to be found at Rainbow's End somewhere behind Andromeda  I've been waiting till the end of december but no more will I ride for the winter solstice's child will pass away silently on a midsummer's night  So may you come now, my Dead Romantic Angel serenade Kyrahnean Hymns to me Hold me in your arms cover me with elder flowers and take me down to my beloved sea  I'm so tired, so tremendously tired Please wait for me under the midnight sun where I will sing and dance again and my laughter will be heard echoing down the hillside again...  Oh, how I tried to believe how I loved, How I tried to hold on to my dream; How I wanted to live - but now I'm going home to a place where love is more than just a four-letter word and as I kiss the memory of your goodnight I'm beginning to see the light...   Antichrisis - The Farewell

Look, look in the candle light See in the flame of life     And my spell our lie     Taste the love, The lucifer's magic that makes you numb     The passion and all the pain are one     You're sleeping in the fire     Taste the love, the lucifer's magic that makes you numb     You feel what it does and you're drunk on love     You're sleeping in the fireI gaze as the flame and fire burn     And cry out the name of which I yearn     Taste the love, The lucifer's magic that makes you numb     The passion and all the pain are one     You're sleeping in the fire     Taste the love, the lucifer's magic that makes you numb     You feel what it does and you're drunk on love     You're sleeping in the fire     &nbsp;

        Beauty and sadness always go together. / Nature thought beauty too rich to go forth / Upon the earth without a meet alloy. George MacDonald     Finally the breaking point..I am still not sure how I feel - relief is dominant, not having to live what has become a lie.  He is enjoying the fact that his family and friends look upon me as the one to blame - it will be the last enjoyment he will ever feel before I leave.  One of the worst things you can possibly commit to each other is lying about how you feel.  Although I laughed my ass off when he called me a cow and I shot back that the reason I won't fuck him is because he looks like a skeleton and then told him I was looking forward to him coming home :)  Never piss off a bitch that has control of herself regardless of R's opinion.  In November of last year there was no will to live, no will to follow my heart - I was embraced by the dark and all I wanted was to sink further down into it.  I'd say I've improved significantly since then - I will follow my heart, I will follow my dreams and I WILL live.  If I leave Canada there are good friends that I will miss dearly but thanks to the invention of pen, paper and the internet the loss should be minimal.  I need to be supported not knocked down every time I try to do something - he still thinks my company is a huge joke but he keeps forgetting that I am still looking for a part time job if needed to supplement income.  ROFL....once again he called me a liar, stupid and crazy - he feels that I am incompetent to make my own decisions...hehe...the only reason he thinks that is due to the fact that we are through beyond any shadow of a doubt.  ROFL....he wants to know the date of every Dr's appt so he can go with me - I told him he would have to wait in the waiting room if he wished....Ding, Ding back into the ring.  He found out today that I have been having my Dr document the bruises - and instead of blaming himself for his lack of control - he believes that it is me that is completely at fault....at least I am free of him for the rest of tonight and possibly tomorrow as well...please wish me luck on that one and if possible let a platinum credit card with a $50,000.00 limit land in my lap....pretty please Te Precore Dulcime Supplex *bounce*  He is still trying to get me to give him all my passwords on the computer and I won't do it....I will not surrender to him....I will never give up...I am keeping my fingers crossed that an answer I am waiting for on Wednesday morning is YES!  I want to be in the arms of the man I love and I hope he feels the same because we may be together soon.      Pain's deep... but it passes, after all. It's passing now but love remains.      Ciao everyone I really should finish the baby blanket that a friend is buying for a baby shower.     Spoken) Come over here!  Some girls, they like candy, and others, they like to grind, I'll settle for the back of your hand somewhere on my behind. Treat me like I'm a bad girl, even when I'm being good to you, I don't want you to thank me, you can just spank me. Mmm.  Some guys like to sweet talk, and others, they like to tease, Tie my hands behind my back and, ooo, I'm in ecstasy. Don't slobber me with kisses, I can get that from my sisters, Before I get too cranky, you better...  Chorus:  Like hanky panky [hanky panky], Nothing like a good spanky [good spanky]. Don't take out your handkerchiefs, I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky. Like hanky panky [hanky panky], Nothing like a good spanky [good spanky]. Don't take out your handkerchiefs, I don't wanna cry, I just wanna hanky panky guy.  Oooo.  Please don't call a doctor, 'cause there's nothing wrong with me, I just like things a little rough and you better not disagree. 'Cause I don't like a big softie, [no], I like someone mean and bossy, Let me speak to you frankly, you better...  (chorus)  Oooo, yeah.  Spoken:  What about? Yeah. That's an interesting... Oooo. My bottom hurts just thinking about it.  [She wants you to] Treat me like I'm a bad girl, [She needs you to] Even when I'm being good to you. I don't want you to thank me [Don't thank her], you better...  (chorus)  [Hanky panky] Oooh, yeah [Good spanky] Get the picture? [Don't wanna cry, I just wanna]  That's the way I came into this world, The doctor said, "Lady, she's a beautiful girl." He gave me a spanky and the doctor smiled, So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it. Yeah. [Hanky panky, good spanky, don't wanna cry, I just wanna] (okay, okay I'll fess up its Madonna)   ******************************************************************************************   I ache for the touch of your lips, dear, But much more for the touch of your whips, dear. You can raise welts Like nobody else, As we dance to the Masochism Tango.  Let our love be a flame, not an ember, Say it's me that you want to dismember. Blacken my eye, Set fire to my tie, As we dance to the Masochism Tango.  At your command Before you here I stand, My heart is in my hand... Yeech! It's here that I must be.  My heart entreats, Just hear those savage beats, And go put on your cleats And come and trample me.  Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany, That's why I'm in such exquisite agony. My soul is on fire, It's aflame with desire, Which is why I perspire when we tango.  You caught my nose In your left castanet, love, I can feel the pain yet, love, Ev'ry time I hear drums.  And I envy the rose That you held in your teeth, love, With the thorns underneath, love, Sticking into your gums.  Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches. The last time I needed twenty stitches To sew up the gash That you made with your lash, As we danced to the Masochism Tango.  Bash in my brain, And make me scream with pain, Then kick me once again, And say we'll never part.  I know too well I'm underneath your spell, So, darling, if you smell Something burning, it's my heart... [hiccup] 'Scuse me!  Take your cigarette from its holder, And burn your initials in my shoulder. Fracture my spine, And swear that you're mine, As we dance to the Masochism Tango.  Tom Lehrer - Masochism Tango

       I am so, so tired - I am tired of pretending that everything is ok when its not - I am getting tired of trying - and I am really fucking tired of everyone (almost) telling me what is good for me - what my doctor *should* be doing - FFS - Hate to inform anyone that does not know this yet but dealing with depression/anxiety is *NOT* an exact science....so fuck off leave me alone because you are draining what little strength I have left.       Story of my life - and don't tell me how easy it is to change the story because no matter what you do to rewrite the story the song will always remain the same and its a painfilled dirge that will make you fall to the ground every time it comes around.        And it is never beautiful to look upon          Alas who is there...Who calls my name?     We must awaken now, my dearest,     Sink thy blade deeply within my dying heart     Shed for me one final tear... my loveFarewell and the dream is cast away...     Forever seek but only the garden for me...     My dark angel... my saviorI shall await thy mourning dream          Autumn Tears - Commiseration in Mourning
