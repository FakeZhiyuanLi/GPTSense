       To get you started on the world of my life, you should first learn some basic stuff.  I was born Sept 20 1991. I'm turning 13 next month. Pwns.  My family is weird. On my mom's side, we have my brothers Paul and George. Unfortunately, their father died an alcoholic. He drowned in a lake. George is a drug addict. Paul I wouldn't say is addicted, but he has drinking problems. But regardless of this small detail, Paul kicks ass. He's graduating from college next year, and he owns a Sunfire, the most owned car in Canada. You cannot drive for 5 minutes in Canada without inevitably seeing a Sunfire. He's my hero in life. George is a nice guy, but we don't see him much. It's odd being around him.  On my fathers side is my brothers Sunny and Tariq, and my sister Tasha. Sunny is awesome. He's a really nice guy, he knows everything. He and his wife have a daughter name Sierra Stefania Mohamed. She's the closest thing to a little sister I may ever have. Then again, with My Sister Tasha and her Fiance Jay,  think they';re considering children. Tariq is ripped. He's huge. I swear to god, he could kick your ass so badly. He kinda has mental problems though. He's in a home. He's a really nice guy though. the three of them barely see their mom, she lives in Guyana. And sadly, they are the breed of my father.  My father is a fat old bastard who should have died a long time ago. He and me mom are seperated, thank god. He's a kind face, with a bitchy aftertaste. I hear stories about him from everybody. How he beat everybody. How he kicked mom on the floor with a steel toed boot. How he made Tariq eat his own vomit. How he stole all of Sunny's money. How he deported Tasha, and how ariq had to rescue her. I sometimes wish to leave hiom forever, and let him live his sad life with the 38 girlfriends he hates. The only remotely good thing about him is his cooking.  My mom on the other hand is my best friend, she is a hard working woman who raised 6children on her own. It's sad though. She never gets a break. It's hard to watch her say things like how her life is a wate of time, and why she has no will to live. It breaks my heart.  My friend Ryan is a pathological liar. He's pretty rich though. He has a frickin swimming pool. He's a fun guy. He's pure silliness. I sometimes like to be the olderbro to his little bro, Kyle.  My friends at school are Adam, Matt, Aaron, and Josh. Adam and Matt are all round cool guys. Josh is a fuckin hillarious idiot. He once raped my leg. Aaron is my best friend though. All day we just goof around. It's the best thing ever.  As for me, I've won 2 math contests, and am probably smarter than you. I'm an atheist. You can call me Inu, Yahsa, InuYahsa, Metabee, Meta, Bee, The Original double EB, Jesus, Beeman, but not InuYasha or Beeboy.  Lets get this party started.
