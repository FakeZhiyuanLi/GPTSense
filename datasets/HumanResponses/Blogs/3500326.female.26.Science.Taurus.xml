                 Thought I'd share some  surgeon humor....... :)              &nbsp;     Things you Don't want to  hear during Surgery            &nbsp;                                 Better save that.        We'll need it for the autopsy.   Someone call the janitor - we're        going to need a mop.   Wait a minute, if this is his spleen, then        what's that?   Hand me that...uh...that uh.....thingie.          Oops! Hey, has anyone ever survived 500ml of this stuff before?          Rats, there go the lights again...   Ya know, there's big        money in kidneys. Heck, the guy's got two of 'em.   Everybody stand        back! I lost my contact lens!   Could you stop that thing from        beating? It's throwing my concentration off!   What's this doing        here?   That's cool! now can you make his leg twitch?!   I        wish I hadn't forgotten my glasses.   Well, folks, this will be an        experiment for all of us.   Sterile, shcmeril. The floor's clean,        right?   Anyone see where I left that scalpel?   OK, now take        a picture from this angle. This is truly a freak of nature.   Nurse,        did this patient sign the organ donation card?   Don't worry. I        think it is sharp enough.   She's gonna blow! Everyone take cover!!!          Rats! Page 47 of the manual is missing!   FIRE! FIRE!        Everyone get out

      I have decided to do it, start a blog.  I have never really gotten why people feel the need to blog, but I also have never tried it out. So, I figured I'd try it.  There is something interesting in sharing your inner most thoughts with the anonymous millions out here in cyberspace--like proving that I am an interesting person and people want to hear about me.   But what is there to say? Hmmm...well, lets start at the beginning!!  I am now the grand old age of 26 years old (now past 1/4 a century)!!!  I have just graduated from medical school (the kind that gives M.D. degrees no less!!)  I am a doctor of medicine, having spent 4 years learning the physiology and pathophysiology of the human animal and various ways to fix it once it breaks.  It still feels weird, like a big dream, not real yet.  I am hoping I can convince myself of it when my degree actually shows up in the mail this August!  :)  And do you know what glorious career I have now?  I am a cashier at a Target! How is that for anticlimactic?  I decided to not do a residency this year, because my mom got really sick and needed me to be around, and I was not sure I'd be able to afford the travel expenses of interviewing at 10-15 places.  To be honest, I am a good clinician, I listen well and communicate well with my patients.  But the tests at this level kick my behind!  So I am doing research for a year to boost my resume, but can't start until August.  But the rent and car needs paying, and the cats need food, so I've taken some part time work.  I feel a little humiliated at times, but you have to do what you have to do.  I should feel no shame in being back on the minimum wage ground floor with a doctorate degree, but I still do sometimes.  But it is only for a few months, I can be humble for that long anyway!  So there you have it, my very first blog.  I'm sure there will be more musings from me in the future, as this is kinda fun!    Later :)

                Today I'd thought  I'd share a random rant-and-raves!         &nbsp;     I have been thinking  about our current government administration (yes, I know, politics can be  boring).&nbsp; I have noticed for a while the blatant lies and failure to  disclose important information for a while (and nothing burns me up more!), but  what really worries me is that there are a lot of people who don't seem to have  noticed or care!         &nbsp;     Bush's approval  ratings have plummeted, but notice it took a several major scandals to make even  a dent in it?&nbsp; Prisoner abuses, failures to prevent Sept. 11.&nbsp; I'd  have more respect for the Bush administration if they would at least take their  lumps, say they were sorry and maybe (gasp) discipline or fire those  responsible? No, they are prosecuting the small beans perpetrators of the  prisoner scandal, taking out the non-commissioned officers while all those CIA  operatives and officers running around aren't even named.&nbsp; Rumsfield will  not be fired, instead they sacrifice his under-secretary (a new position created  especially by this admin, by the way), a man who was  supposed  to be  supervised by Rumsfield.&nbsp; Condelezza Rice has become the big bad b*tch of  D.C now, flat out weaseling her way out of responsibility for several serious  oversights on her part as security advisor (notice how every picture of her now  shows her scowling and pouty and p*ssed off?).         &nbsp;     But I can't say I  expected much else, his father conducted the first Iraq war from the bloody golf  course, and Reagan was becoming affected by Alzheimer's at the end of his terms  and was  non compos mentis .&nbsp; Bush, Sr. was involved in the  Iran-Contra affair way back when, and Reagan was elected by actually   dealing  with terrorists holding American hostages!!!&nbsp; But we  forget all this.&nbsp; I will grant, sometimes Democrats aren't knights in  shining armor, but at least they have never lied, cheated and war-mongered, then  ran up a many trillion dollar debt, insist on cutting taxes (don't want to pay  that debt, now do we?) and then continue to increase spending on&nbsp;in poorly  managed war zone and say "oh, its them democrats! they don't believe in cutting  spending!!"&nbsp; The hypocrisy turns my stomach.         &nbsp;       &nbsp;     Ok, I've said my  piece now.&nbsp; Go Kerry, and all that :)&nbsp; Oh, and go see Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11, it should be illuminating.         &nbsp;     Me         &nbsp;     (also go see the new  Harry Potter, lol)
