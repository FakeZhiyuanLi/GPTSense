      well, i took a big step, and finally sent the e-mail i had been reading, writing, re-writing, deleting, writing again, on & on... anyway, i sent it yesterday, and he wrote back immediately, and he was happy? amazed? stunned into silence? it's hard to say, he can be so obtuse.&nbsp;&nbsp; he wrote of&nbsp; my soul poetry (which&nbsp;is touching and sooo &nbsp;sweet)&nbsp;&nbsp;and of&nbsp;sharing it with me again.&nbsp; i don't know what to think, so ya know what?! i'm not going to , i have to live in the moment, i need only be, i need only be, &nbsp;i &nbsp;&nbsp; need&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be  "be here now" -Ram Dass

      today........i just need somewhere to write. I'm thinking that maybe if i write all of these thoughts down i can get them out of my head and get on with it, life i mean, get on with life.&nbsp; I am 33 years old, this is really hard for me to believe. When i was little it seemed that one day you realize you're an adult, and that day you start feeling like one, but i feel the same. Probably everyone does i don't know i haven't asked. Anyway, I'm married, I have 2 little girls, a cat, a job, a yard. So, i find myself thinking 'is this it?, is this what i waited my whole life for? i thought it would be so much more, more exciting, more fun, more friends, more everything. i sound dissappoinited, don't i? i do. i am. it is only my fault, i chose, or didn't choose and just let things happen, some of both, either way, it's all up to me, always has been...somehow i just didn't know that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old&nbsp;boyfriend of mine from a long time ago has been calling me quite alot lately and this ,....i don't even know what to say about it.&nbsp; i still really really love him.&nbsp; that's all i&nbsp;can say&nbsp; ........ &nbsp;
