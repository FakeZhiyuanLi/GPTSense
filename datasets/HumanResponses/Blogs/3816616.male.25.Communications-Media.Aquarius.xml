      I only have about 20 minutes for this post; the library closes at 8 p.m. But my friend Samantha ( urlLink www.foxinthesnow.com ) dissed me recently (gently, of course) for making "excuses, mexcuses" about not having a blog. So now I do. And the topic I'm sure I'll be addressing in the next couple of entries is Elliott Smith's posthumously released final album, "From a Basement on the Hill." It's funny -- I got it around noon today, then lent it to a coworker, who reported that track four or something is "an homage to&nbsp;Nick Drake." It kind of irks me when people talk about songs as though the influence prevents the song from standing alone, on its own merits. Maybe it IS a Nick Drake ode, or maybe the "homage" is accidental. Does it really matter? If you're reviewing it formally, perhaps, but in a casual sense, I think just enjoying the song for what it is should be enough. I dunno. Maybe I'm just pissy because someone else heard the album before I did.  Hmmm... Apparently, John Kerry will win the 2004 election. That's what my manager at Seattle Weekly ( urlLink www.seattleweekly.com ) has determined, with help from an L.A. Times election-predicting tool whose complexities I have yet to explore. Good news, I guess. I haven't begun my much-talked-about (by me) work for the Kerry campaign, but I guess now's the time. I've noticed the Youth Of America in red T-shirts getting people registered and trying to squeeze $100 out of Capitol Hill Block Party attendees. (Hello? Did ANYONE study the three-job-working, just-enough-money-left-for-booze&nbsp;demographic that is Cap Hill punks and hipsters?) Anyway, those red tees are looking pretty fucking Republican, as one bus rider mentioned a week or so ago. Maybe next time we should coordinate our colors better and forget that red brings out the amber highlights in Tiffany's hair. Although it does, actually. Tiffany's so pretty.    Which leads me to... Please, friends o' mine, stop getting engaged! I know, selfish and bitter and crabby... But it's too early. Wait a few years, get a dog, see if you can agree on a parenting technique (or at least maintain a balanced, fair, nonjudgmental, casually feminist household), and THEN pop the question -- mutually, so as to avoid falling into patriarchal gender roles. SHEESH. To&nbsp;roughly quote&nbsp;George Constanza from "Seinfeld": "I'd like to have a kid. But I guess I'd need a date first." Egads. Did "The Rules" get republished recently or something?  Also, please let it be hotter and more humid. Because those of us who feel fat love the sensation of being still larger and more sluggish and clumsier than ever before.   I guess the solution would be a nice session or ten with Mickey, the slightly dim but highly enthusiastic trainer who showed me the literal and figurative ropes at Gold's Gym a few months (eep!) ago. Yeah, all that money going into my membership, and only three workouts and an ill-fated spinning class (can anyone say "cardiac arrest"?) to show for it. But the future will be brighter, I'm sure, since a colleague told me yesterday that I looked like I'd lost 10 pounds, and I'm hoping to enroll in the much-feared, widely reviled Weight Watchers just as soon as I get a free Wednesday to go to Meeting. That's what I'm going to call it: Meeting. Like I'm Quaker. Or an alcoholic.  Okay, the jackbooted library fascists are coming for me. More later from the blog that dares tread where few blogs, rightly enough, have trod before.  Yours in geek, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NS
