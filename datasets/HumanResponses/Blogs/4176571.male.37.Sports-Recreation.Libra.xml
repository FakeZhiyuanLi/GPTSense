      Well, I have decided to "raise the bar" on my fitness and health. After a few days of convincing by my friend and fitness consultant Tony Gray, I am entering a Mini Triathalon.   Yes, I am absolutly insane.   It is usualy held in the month of March or April so I have some time to start training for it.  No, I'm not ready, mentaly or physically.  I am completly scared to death of it...and thus is the very reason  I have to do it!   Here is a sample of my First 8 weeks for preperation:       My Goal            ·              Weekdays 30 grams of Carbs            ·               Weekends 150 grams          Foods to Eat          The following foods have virtually no carbohydrates and so can be eaten freely:

       urlLink    And here is the   "Holy crap! How did I ever let myself look like this??"   picture. Like like to tell everyone in the fitness industry that it was a long term  " bulking phase "  of my fitness to allow maximum muscle in a all natural state.....for 10 years......

       urlLink    So this is about 2.5 months into the whole    "I don't eat crap"    anymore process. I still have a long way to go towards my 2 year goal of being more fit than I was in my 20's however, I think I am off to a good start on a permanent lifestyle change. And I feel damn good about it too!

      Yeah, I decided after seeing a picture of mine to venture into the world of "Low Carb" not to outdo myself I bought more books than I could ever read then dove into the process (excuse the pun) of avoiding processed foods and garbage.  I guess I was like 90% of the public, excited that I could eat all the bacon I ever wanted and still lose fat. I also guess I was like the other 90% of the public who was afraid that I was going to harden my arteries, and die of a massive cornary heart attack.  ...wait...90% + 90%... oh well, you get the picture.  However, it wasn't long before I was able to see the "big picture" from a low carb lifestyle point of view..and the myths of unlimted bacon and cheese and red meat flew out the window.  It's not like that at all when you choose to Low Carb.  Now it's kind of funny and sad to me all at the same time that; on the one hand I can tell a person that I chose to Low Carb as a way of life and I get hostle responses like the later 90% telling me I am going to die a horrible death. I can't blame them really, I mean, what have you been told by big buisiness for the last 60 years?  Then, the irony comes in...I could tell that same random person that asked me "my secret" to weight loss and when I tell them I no longer eat "sugar, starches, or processed foods" but instead eat, Raw vegiatables, fruit and unprocessed meats they are amazed and in awe. I here things like, "wow I could never do that etc etc.  Now I don't really care one way or another what other folks belive, but when you start poking through my shopping cart and telling me how to eat while you have donughts and a carton cigs in yours THATS when all hell will break loose.   The True Low Carb  people have been eating and living this way for centuries, they don't buy into the hyped low carb market...and they continue to have great blood lipis and wonderful health. I invite you to take a deeper look into what Low Carb  IS ...and not what other people  THINK . Oh and incase you like to listen to and belive what the media says...remember, they say what sells Bacon and Cheese sounds scarier than Salmon and Salad (Athough they are both low carb...) :)

       urlLink    My wife Veronica, my daughter Trinity and I decided to leave California for a more "Family" oriented state.  Knoxville TN was a great opportunity for us since the company I would be eventurally working for was owned by someone I had worked for in the past, but is also considered by many a pioneer and driver in the health and fitness industry.&nbsp; urlLink
