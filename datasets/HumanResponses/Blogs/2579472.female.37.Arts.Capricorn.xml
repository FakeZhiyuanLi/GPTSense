         Yep, Just an older fan of Bon Jovi!  I've been a die hard fan since I was 16...and Runaway hit the airwaves.  Loved them then, still love them now!  It's been 20 years... and I feel like I've grown up with their music.. It has always been a part of my life... or so it seems!  This fan will be a fan forever!

       I just got back last night from New Hampshire and the CGOA Chain Link Conference! I'm tired, my feet have blisters from walking so much, but I had the BEST TIME!  I arrived on Tuesday evening and almost immediately had a meeting with Carolyn Christmas and Janet Rehfeldt. The three of us were finalizing the last few details of our presentation the next day for Professional Development Day.   Wednesday, I had the honor of meeting Tricia Malcolm, the editor of Family Circle Easy Knitting and Crochet Too. (Vogue Knitting as well!) She was the main speaker at Professional Development day. She covered trends, how to find them and Photography.  Then Jocelyn Sass spoke. She has had a column Crochet World for the last 15 years as well as being a designer and self-publisher in her own right! She spoke about writing clear patterns. It was wonderful!  After the Lunch break, Janet, Carolyn and I were up to talk about Self Publishing. We had the whole afternoon! It was a fun experience and the presentation was well received!  After PDD was over, We had a break and then at 7 PM was the PJ and Pizza Party. OH MY! We had to crochet our own socks to go, and there were some WONDERFUL socks there. One lady did the three little pigs on one sock (The toes) and the other sock was the big bad wolf! TOO CUTE!  Thursday started the normal class schedule. I taught Crochet an Evening Bag and Crochet a Scarf that day. Thursday evening was the Keynote, and Gwen Blakely-Kinsler, CGOA Founder and President spoke about how the guild got started. It is really cool how it all came to be. After the Keynote was over, the Fiber Market opened! Another OH MY!!! But I will talk about that later!  Friday was more classes and I taught Intro to Filet Crochet and Intro to Camel Crochet. That camel Crochet Class was the best class ever! I was nervous because it was Sold out (The first class to sell out!) and I was hoping everyone got what they wanted to out of it. I think they got more. The jokes that flew because of such terms in the technique such as "Camel's Foot" and "Camel's Hump" and "Cross Camel Crochet" were hysterical, but honestly, you had to be in the class to understand... But I have NEVER laughed as much as I did that day!  Friday evening we were on our own and I had dinner with Jocelyn Sass and Janet Rehfeldt. We talked so much we missed the business meeting.. but we had a great time!  Saturday, I had to fly back home although the conference was still not over, I did make it to the fiber market that morning! I bought about $180 worth of wonderful luscious yarns that I will be bringing to my next guild meeting for show and tell.. I plan to have most of it made up... but we will see... I'll also post pictures of it on my Blog when I have a moment. I also was happy and a little surprised to see that one of the vendors was selling our new Kustom Kraft Line of crochet books! My Scarf book that should be in Hobby Lobby shortly was featured there!  By the time I got on the plane, I was so tired, but I had the time of my life!

       WOW!  I am so excited!  After 2 weeks of being a single parent (My hubby has been in Florida for Work training!) I finally got an adult night!  Tonight I met up with 2 crocheters in the area!  We are going to start a local guild! How fun is that?  We all brought projects to work on.  I had my halter-style top that I am almost done with now!  2 more rows of edging and I will have a pic for you all soon!  AJ brought some great cotton yarn that she is crocheting a summer top out of.  I can't remember the name otherwise I would post it here!  I'll ask her again!  Josie worked on a crocheted Choker with beads.  It was too cute!  I loved it!! :)  I am so excited because we all want to meet again on the 15th of the month again!  So I am going to find out if we can start our local guild meetings at a Library in the area tomorrow!  I sure hope so!! :)  Anyway... that is my crochet excitement for the day!  More later~

          This is the purse I completed for my daughter.  It is made with Patons twister yarn and some specialty handles I found that I decorated with beads.  If you look closely, one handle has her name on it!   You can get the pattern here.

       I just made these for my daughter today!       I just love them! They really turned out cute!  I got the idea from a thread at  urlLink Crochet Partners .  I used Bernat Eyelash yarn with a Size L (8.0 mm) hook and joined with a sc on one side of the thong and just kept sc along until it was as full as I wanted it!  I made a second pair for my niece!  Quick, easy and she loves it! :)

       I learned to crochet at age 7.  I was taught by my Italian "Nonna" (Grandmother) and learned all the stitch names in Italian! Since Nonna didn't know how to read patterns written in English, I had to teach myself.   Here is a picture of my very first crochet item!  I finished it in 2 hours!     I didn't start my career as a designer until 1999. Up until that point I would follow patterns I bought in the store. If something didn't work out to my satisfaction, I would modify it. Then in December of 1998, I met Terry Kimbrough through one of the many crochet lists on the Internet. Terry, who has always been one of my favorite designers, encouraged me to try her hand at designing something. my first designs were Flower Dishcloths and to my amazement, Annie's Attic liked them! From that point my career took off!  My favorite items to design are Afghans. I works with both yarn and thread but  I definitely prefer to work with yarn! Baby items and kitchen items are also favorites! Many of my ideas come from the things I see around me. Nature is one of my biggest triggers for new idea, but I loves to browse the stores to see patterns and fabrics that also give new ideas.  urlLink Click here  to see some of my Published Designs!  When my design career started, I also opened the doors of  urlLink Crochet Legacy . Crochet Legacy is a multi-dimensional company. My hats include, Pattern Design, teaching private and group crochet classes, eBay auctions, a monthly newsletter and a web site featuring my original patterns.   I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest with the best husband in the world of 14 years, David and my 2 children.
