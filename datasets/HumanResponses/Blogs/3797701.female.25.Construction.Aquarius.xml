      July 01, 2004 7:46 morning Thursday Semi-windy day skies almost blue  I had a much weirder dream the night before. It was blackout in our neighborhood and it was past 10 in the evening so everything was real dark, save for the faint glimmer of candles in some windows in the houses. I also noticed that there were no cars passing by that night, it was all so silent. There were a few people outside passing time and the heat of the night. I was walking away from our house when I saw this three people walking in my direction. Two girls were at the extreme right and one guy was on the left. As I got closer  to them I noticed they were talking, but what really freaked me out was the guy had no head! His head however was dangling from his back, I quickly ran for what seemed such a long time back to our house and decided to take my cellphone with me.  *There's a consistency here, this and the other had one common denominator = 3*

      June 30, 2004 Wednesday  11:47 morning Windy day, stormy   I dreamed this just a few hours ago. I was with this two men and a another woman. The other guy had long hair that reached his shoulders his hair was black, and curled on the ends. His lips red and curled to a cruel looking smile. He towered above me, he had a pallid complexion. The other one had soft light brown hair he had a soft expression on his face his lips thin and pinkish and he had a boyish atmosphere to himself. The woman however was beautiful with raven hair. That's all I remember. Despite the boyish ambience of the other guy he had a dark plan to bed this woman.  I on the other hand was walking alone on a path and I could hear them talking inside the abandoned looking house. As I was walking, I *foolishly* scraped my ring's stone on the wall that enclosed the house and to my horror, found that half of my stone was missing. As I looked at it closer I realized it really was broken, a big chunk was missing from my stone. I felt so sad knowing that I had only lost the original stone a few months ago and had it replaced with a new one.  I went in the house and talked to the other man whose lips were carved to a cruel smile. The others were there. The beautiful woman was sitting on the floor playing with something the other guy was making this box spin over and over again with one hand as the other supported himself on the floor. As I told him what had happened, it dawned on me that he was my brother. And he was so furious when I told him that I broke my stone, he dragged me to another room and the others, the beautiful woman and the man with a boyish ambience heard as he slapped me.  That's it I woke up...I hope to dream bout this again, funny but I think I know what it means...

      10 mins to 6 eve Thursday Fair skies  I just have to put this out or else I will explode. I refused a job offer from a great company because we are going to undergo changes in our systems such as upgrades and software changes only to find out that mr. GM doesn't trust my department for a mere document due for position papers *hard to understand terms i know, sorry rushing this* I gave a job offer to stay in a company where the GM is suspicious as an old jealous husband of that of his young wife! DANG!

      July 02, 2004 3:30 afternoon Friday Sunny  I dreamt of alot of weird things last night. First I dreamt of a box full of coins, I was trying to get some to pay for my fare a little later but no matter how hard I dig in, I couldn't get the amount. I needed 5.50 but all I keep getting is 2-3 pesos.Weird.  The next one I found myself floating in the sea and I was too scared or too stiff to paddle my way to dry land, there I just lay in a floating position letting the waves take me in its waves of confusion. At least the water was blue and calm, yet cold!  Another one I found myself walking aimlessly holding an umbrealla going against the rough rains, unable to see where I'm heading or where I am.  ~Whew~ What dreams. Hmmm. As I can see in these dreams it seems like wherever I was going I can't seem to go there, something always seems to be in my way. From the coins, to the sea to the rain. Hmmm. Hope it's not what I hope it is.   Be back a few days from now. I'll sleep for two whole days.
