"the worst thing that can happen is to see someone u love.. love someone else.."..  i didn't understand it my friend tell me this.. i finally understand lei.. this few days i so weak.. body keep shivering.. guess is cos of my sadness.. ha..   u don't need me lei.. all u need is him..     but the only thing that i am glad is that u are happy... really.. its better that both of us are upset... can let me take this?.. i can take it de.. just give me more time.. i am just an extra holding on.. u don't need me lei.. all u need is him..    what everyone says was actually right..   "wake up la.. she don't need u anymore..", "hey.. i saw how close they are lor.. plz.. u think u still got chance?.. don't be a fool..", "she is playing with u lor.. u still can't see.. haiz.. dan chi zhe mi pang guan zhe qing"...      u don't need me lei.. all u need is him...                 what do u take me as?...              my heart so pain.. cos i keep remembering the good times we had.. but u will never miss those times lei.. cos u are so much happier now.. so much more.. so much close to him than u were with me..   u don't need me lei.. all u need is him..

"good morning".. and it bacame a good morning.. ha.. sms-ed her.. wanted to lend her my phone during PE cause she not taking it.. but she stop sms-ing me.. then during assembly.. i saw that she went over to talk to him.. plz lor.. he is not looking at u or even have the "want to talk to u" look but u still went over to talk to him.. i very jealous.. at that moment then i realise how important is he to u..           Rain offer me sweets.. the first thing i thought of is to get the whole tube for her.. cos she have to eat bitter bitter medicine.. beg like nothing... flirt like nothing.. in the end rain agreed to give me the whole tube.. so happy.. put it in my pocket the whole PE.. when to find her during PE lesson a few times.. but either rain is with her.. or that i can see her anywhere.. finally saw her in the canteen.. pass it to her.. so happy.. saw her smile.. but she really hurt me when she shouted to me that she will pay me when i bought her drink when she didn't order.. make me so pei say.. in front of the whole group of people there.. but i never blame her la.. after sch.. i sms her about the ocean cd.. also a excuse to sms her.. and she told me she quarrelled with that ass hole again.. didn't know what happen until i read her blog.. HE STARED AT HER?!!! my God.. the only time i remember seeing him stare at someone is at me when he ask me to fight.. downstair her house.. no matter what she did.. she don't deserve stare.. especially from stead.. nvm.. i very worried for her when she told me she not happy.. went down immediately to find her.. ha.. fate step in.. the moment i am making the turn to guzheng room.. she also there... saw her.. i was so happy.. then i try to cheer her up.. haiz.. but she have to return back shortly.. so didn't achive much..           my meeting ends at 4:10.. she say she will be meeting me to pass me something at 4:30.. no time lei.. but i really wan to cheer her up.. so i decide to get her somethings she like.. ran like mad down.. no bus!.. can't wait.. chong all the way to kovan.. got the stuffs and chong back.. ha.. made it on time... she is not out yet.. suddenly i felt very scare to see her.. don't know y.. maybe cos she meeting asshole immediately after that.. don't wan to "know" he meeting her.. so i placed the stuffs under the box.. but she saw me.. so i came out.. pass her the stuff and she pass me the notes... (thanks.. really very useful).. when i saw her walk out alone.. i called her.. wanted to pei her as much as possible.. and talk to her all the way out.. but i wonder if she knows how pain i am at that time.. ha.. pei-ing someone u love all the way to meet "someone"'s him.. ha.. guess she don't know ba.. but i am still a fool lor.. knowing it will hurt me.. i still called..           after that.. my friend send me a good night sms.. i sent it to her.. after about half an hour.. she reply.. she misunderstand my sms.. i very worried.. i called her.. find her crying.. so sad.. like thunder strike.. somemore she give me the tone that she don't want to talk to me..  ha.. know she is with him.. after that finally got chance to talk to her.. its when he goes off of some reason.. and she say i don't understand her.. say alot of things to hurt me.. i very very sad..           then until very late at night.. she still outside with him.. very worried for her.. she is sick and tired.. yet she is willing to pei him until so late.. haiz. very jealous.. i always wonder what she take me as?.. everytime i ask her to pei me.. she will say she very tired.. if i ask on further.. she will always scold me.. but i wonder.. y she never do that to him... who am i?... a rehabilitation.. come only when i am needed... kick aside when u are healed.. ha... who am i?..           19/8/04.. ha.. one month ago.. exactly one month ago.. she rejected me right at my face.. rejected me infront of him.. hee.. why am i still there for her.. i ask myself also.. i don't know..

                today is a very boring day.. i woke up at four and realised i fell asleep.. sob.. felt so guilty.. cos i was sms-ing her and i fell asleep.. but the reason i fell asleep is my mother.. actually i woke up when u wake me up.. but my mum ask me to go back to slp awhile more.. saying that she will wake me up later.. but my mum in the end didn't.. sob..           i was late for sch.. almost.. so i decided to take a taxi.. ha.. suprized!.. saw 80.. and when i look into the bus, i saw her.. so happy.. told the driver to drop me at the next stop.. ha.. when i got up the bus, saw her smile.. my day was made.. it ended not very well.. she saw someone sms me.. actually i thought if i told her that my phone hang, she will be happier.. but she thought i purposely trying to tell her that someone sms me... i was not angry with her when i walked off to sch myself.. i am only afraid that her "he" may see or her "he"'s friends may see us together.. when i reach sch.. when she join her group of friends, then i dare to go over.. rack my mind of jokes to cheer her up..           the test was really hard.. at least for me.. didn't know how to do a single sum.. after the exam.. i look at her.. know who she was sms-ing.. i went off.. decided to go get something from cheers.. when i return, i saw them waiting at the gate.. i know she is going to meet him.. but i just don't feel like knowing. so i didn't dare to sms or call her.. but i still call in the end.. when she told me that she going TM to meet him.. i don't know y i felt so down.. i know i am not jealous.. cos i already see them together so many times lei.. should xi guan lei.. but i think is more that it remind me of she coming to look for me when i was sick.. i was really touched that time.. and it hurts so much that she will not be doing that to me anymore lei.. cos i am no more her stead..           i started saying qi hua.. really regretted.. cos it not only hurts her.. it hurts me more.. i went around.. in the end met my church people.. then i went to meet her at the library.. she likes my phone alot.. and she is the only one that treats my phone so gently. ha.. but i can't be happy.. knowing that i hurt her just now.. so guilty..           she went to meet her mum after that.. i went home.. cooked noodles.. so nice.. in the end i fell asleep waiting for her sms.. sorry sorry..
