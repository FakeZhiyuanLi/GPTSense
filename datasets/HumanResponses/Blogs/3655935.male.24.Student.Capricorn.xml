       urlLink According to a recent news article , the Archbishop of Canterbury has professed he is willing to do a voice on the  urlLink Fox  tv show,  urlLink the Simpsons .  The Archbishop is head of the Anglican church and an avid fan of the Simpsons.  Soon after openly praising the show for its humor and humility, he was asked if he would be willing to do a voice on the show, to which he replied affirmatively.  While no official agreement has been set, both sides are willing to make it happen, so I’m sure it eventually will.  Many evangelical Christians oppose the Simpsons, saying it fails to promote family values.  True, the show fails to provide a model for most families, but this criticism fails to see what the Simpsons is about.  In many ways, the Simpsons is a critique of Western culture, pointing out its flaws and absurdities through a  reductio ad absurdum  played out on a cartoon.  Unlike many American evangelicals, the Anglican Archbishop gets it.  While I am not an Anglican, I say “Hooray” for the Archbishop being willing to participate in one of our culture’s most popular and influential parodies.  The “cynical truth” portrayed by popular icons like the Simpsons and David Letterman could provide a model for revealing Christian truth to the next generation that also gets it.

      Sometimes mundane truths of which I'm already aware strike me in bizarre ways.  For example, today I realized I'm 24.  I don't remember being 23 or 22.  What does it mean to be 24?  I don't know.  It's weird when someone asks me how old I am, and it takes me a second to figure it out or my gut impulse is to say 21.  Why is my default response stuck on 21?  Maybe I have serious problems and should seek professional help.  Nonetheless, I find myself in this perplexing state of mind.  I wonder, does it get any better once you get older, or will I have to calculate my age every time someone asks me from this point forward?

      According to  urlLink The Associated Press , the Wright Entertainment Group (famous for managing music acts like Britney Spears) and Matt Crouch (Trinity Broadcast Network--you know, the so-called "Christian" channel that features Benny Hinn and other "evangelists") have collaborated to begin a new television show called " Gifted ."   Gifted  would be a talent-search contest that scoured the nation for the best talent, and the winner would receive a singing career under the management of Wright and Crouch.  Not only is this idea positively boring (just look at all the other "idol" imitation shows), but there are essential Christian values that will likely be compromised by  Gifted .  First, the creation of  Gifted  reminds me of an unhealthy mingling of the holy with the profane.  Much of the so-called "Christian culture" merely takes something from the world's culture and "baptizes" it in Christian external appearances, while leaving the rest of the structure in tact.  Second, as the name "American Idol" explicitly states, these talent searches intend to discover, hone, and market the next celebrity that American culture can idolize.  Third, the whole talent search contest smacks of the world's (mis)judgment.  According to 1 Samuel 16:7, "God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."  Finally, I fear  Gifted  will focus on everything except the music.  The talk will be all about the singers personal lives, who's the hottest, and in worst case scenarios who proves to be the most "spiritual."  I wonder if there will be anything Christian about  Gifted , or if it will be  exactly  like "American Idol" with different lyrics?  My guess is that  Gifted  will be an attempt at Wright and Crouch to make money, and it will be promoted as an evangelistic tool to reach out to the world.  Most likely, people in the world will not watch it, and even if they did, I doubt they would see a substantial difference.  If reaching the world is our goal, I suggest we stop imitating the world, and we live like we should.  1 Peter 2:15 " For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men ."

        urlLink   Yesterday, I hung out with Beverly.  Beverly is one of my best friends here in Abilene.  She is much older than me and requires some help getting around, but she still has a sharp mind.  She is one of the few people in town who I can talk forthrightly about philosophy and theology and who actually enjoys it!  Beverly also gives me advice for my love life and is constantly urging me to get married.  Back to my original story.  Yesterday, I took Beverly to a doctor’s appointment and then we went to lunch.  She was a little afraid that she might undergo some pain at the doctor’s, but thankfully she did not.  In fact, she seemed to be in much better health and spirits than I have seen her in a long time.  Beverly has been a source of encouragement and joy here in Abilene, which has been a cauldron of despair for me in the past.  I will miss my days with Beverly, especially since I know she is a one of a kind.

      Today I was considering starting a new reality show: “ Who wants to date me? ”  To be honest, I’ve just about given up on the whole dating enterprise.  I’m not an unattractive human being.  My personality is not utterly repulsive.  I’m a great guy who just hasn’t met that beautiful, intelligent, funny, Christian lady who   also   likes me.  In order to hasten things along their natural course, I believe my best option would be to create a reality show where a variety of eligible ladies compete for my affections on national television.  Sounds like a win-win scenario to me.  Actually, upon little reflection, I see this is a terrible idea.  I guess I will just have to do things the old fashioned way.   Uuuurrrgghh....

      The position known as “ determinism ” includes the belief that all choices have pre-existing sufficient conditions that determines the outcome of those choices.  In other words, there are no real choices to be made because other causal factors have already determined their outcome.  Determinism comes in many forms.   Physicalism , a type of absolute reductionism that believes only material entities exist, is inherently deterministic, since all that exists is simply matter in motion.  The present state of matter coupled with the laws of nature ought to determine the outcome of the world.   Theological determinism , a logical consequence of five point Calvinism and Jonathan Edwards’ theology, would also qualify as deterministic.  The world is not physically determined, but according to theological determinists everything is determined solely by God’s will.  Aside from untoward pragmatic by-products of determinism, I think the biggest philosophical shortcoming for any form of determinism comes from a problem of internal coherence.  For determinists of all stripes cannot answer this dilemma: “You believe in determinism either because (a) you have been determined to do so or (b) you examined the evidence and freely drew the valid conclusion that it is true.”  Option (a) is the answer most consistent with determinism, but if one has been determined to believe in determinism, then they really don’t have good reasons to believe it.  On the other hand, if the determinists suggest option (b), then they have admitted that at least one choice is not determined by pre-existing sufficient conditions, which would be tantamount to abandoning determinism.  But there is no need for one's philosophy to get impaled on the horns of a dilemma.  Rather, I suggest that all forms of determinism should simply be dismissed as self-referentially incoherent, and you should accept some form of genuine freedom instead.  In his essay, “The Dilemma of Determinism” William James proposes the following sound advise: “our first act of freedom, if we are free, ought in all inward propriety to be to affirm that we are free.”  Or as Geddy Lee, from the band Rush puts it, “If you choose not to decide  You still have made a choice You can choose from phantom fears And kindness that can kill I will choose a path that's clear I will choose free will!”

      Hello Everyone!  Welcome to "Fides Quaerens Intellectum," [Latin: "Faith seeking understanding"] my weblog where I will pontificate on subjects like popular culture, politics, philosophy, and maybe even my personal life.  So why  another  one of these pages?  First, this will be different because it is  me  who is writing, so my insights will inevitably be different from others.  Second, I hate to break it to you, but this is not just for you.  I think this will be a good place for me to spill my guts as well.  Take it or leave it, the blog has begun!  Before I have my first real post, I guess I will say a short word about myself.  In a few days I will be moving to Michigan to begin graduate studies in philosophy at  urlLink Western Michigan University .  I recently completed a master's degree in religion from the  urlLink Logsdon School of Theology , and I have a bachelor of arts from  urlLink Hardin-Simmons University  where I double-majored in philosophy and theology, and I minored in biblical languages.  More about my academic life is available on  urlLink my website .  My most effective humor is extremely dry.  I am a huge fan of artistic music and film.  In many ways, I am an amateur writer and artist myself, some of which may appear in my future blogs.  You'll see more of who I am through my postings.  One last thing, like I said, I am moving to Michigan in a few days.  So, sometime in the near future I am going to be unable to post online for a period of time (maybe a week, I don't know).  Welcome to my blog, and come back when I give a  real  post!

      I don’t have tv, so I wasn’t able to watch John Kerry give his acceptance speech to be the Democrat’s presidential candidate.  Fortunately, I was able to read it  urlLink on the net , and I heard large portions on the radio.  First, I have to admit this is the best delivery I’ve ever heard Kerry give.  He picked up the pace, and succeeded in not lulling me to sleep.  On the other hand, I thought his speech was deceptive at times and his words rarely matched his core values we can see through his voting record as a Senator.   First, I am perplexed by his strong rhetoric (which he has continued to use in speeches after this one) in the phrase: " I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war ."  This is puzzling because Kerry (and John Edwards) strongly supported the necessity of the Iraq war based on the same evidence President Bush had.  Moreover, he voted to give the President the authority to conduct the war, although he voted against giving the President the funding for the war.  This record of his positions on the war makes me think Kerry is driven by popular opinions, not core ideologies.  Who knows where he’ll stand on the war next week.  Kerry also blasted the state of the economy.  Yet, the economy is doing  great !  Unemployment is below 5%, which is lower than it ever was during the 1990’s.  Good high paying jobs are being created, and the average American worker has received a big cut in taxes.  Let’s not forget that President Bush has marshaled this powerful economy after the devastating September 11 attacks and two wars.  All indicators show the economy continues to improve.  Kerry has voted on numerous occasions to raise taxes, especially on gasoline, and during the primaries, Kerry said several times his first action as President would be to repeal the Bush tax cuts, which is a nice way of saying he will raise taxes.  These strategies will immediately cripple lower and middle class people, and will have stifling effects on the whole economy in long run.  Another interesting turn Kerry took in his speech was to cast himself as a strong supporter of the military and intelligence.  Most of this was backed up by his rhetoric on being a soldier.  But his voting record as a Senator says something completely different.  He has voted against implementing every modern piece of military hardware currently used by our soldiers (examples: F-16, F-15, B1-B, B2-A, Apache Helicopter, Patriot Missile, etc.).  In 1996, Kerry introduced a bill that would cut defense by $6.5 billion dollars, which thankfully was not passed.  Despite the rhetoric, I have no reason to believe Kerry is the strong military man he promises to be.  Kerry’s speech either directly stated or subtly implied that he would send more troops to Iraq, hire more police in the US, provide healthcare for everyone, and not raise taxes on the lower and middle classes.  In fact, he actually said he would lower taxes on the middle class.  How is he going to accomplish this fiscal feat?  Not by cutting any government programs, he said that he wouldn’t do that.  The only adjustment seems to be to raise taxes on the "rich" Americans, which are those who make $200k a year.  Granted, that’s more than I make, but I would hardly call that rich.  In many places that have a high cost of living, that income would be dead center on the middle class.  Furthermore, I find it difficult to believe that this will provide enough funding to supply all the promises he gave.  Either he is lying or he has a bad policy here.  My blog has already become rather long, so I won’t make it much longer.  I’m keeping my ears open to what Kerry and Edwards are promising, but so far I’m not impressed.

      Victor Reppert recently published a book called  urlLink C. S. Lewis’s Dangerous Idea , which is a spin off Daniel Dennett’s title,  Darwin’s Dangerous Idea .  Dennett’s thesis was to show how Darwin made metaphysical naturalism to be an intellectually compelling position.  Reppert’s book draws on C. S. Lewis (mainly from his work Miracles) to show that metaphysical naturalism cannot comfortably claim to possess rationality.  His argument could go something like this:   1.  If naturalism is true, then human brains are the result of accidental, purposeless physical forces.  2.  If human brains are the result of accidental, purposeless forces, then they cannot be trusted to acquire true beliefs.  3.  Therefore, if naturalism is true, then human brains cannot be trusted to acquire true beliefs.  4.  Therefore, if naturalism is true, then it entails the self-refuting claim that we cannot trust our brains to tell us it is true. This is a very watered-down version of what Reppert calls the Argument from Reason.  In his book he goes in much more detail, and shows other compelling reasons to doubt metaphysical naturalism possesses a robust metaphysical framework to uphold rationality.  Consequently, he has gone under fire from the  urlLink Internet Infidels .  He must have done something right because in turn Richard Carrier wrote a  urlLink lengthy response , which is full of the usual rhetoric and often imprecise thinking that is common to the Internet Infidels.  Fortunately, some theists have begun to fight back.  For example, Bill Vallicella has posted  urlLink a response on his blog .  I haven’t had time to pour carefully over Carrier’s response and write my own rebuttal (yet).  I believe Reppert is on to something dangerous, though, and the naturalists know it.  Reppert struck a chord, and now the naturalists are fighting back like a cornered animal.  I say, "Good job Victor!"

      I strongly recommend visiting the  urlLink Philosophical Lexicon .  This is a hilarious compendium of philosophical names and terms turned into jokes based on the word being satirized.  Some philosophical background is needed to understand the jokes, so I recommend not spending too much time on an entry if you don’t get it.  Here are some hilarious examples.     alvinize , v. To stimulate protracted discussion by making a bizarre claim. "His contention that natural evil is due to Satanic agency alvinized his listeners."    buber , v. To struggle in a morass of one's own making. "After I defined the self as a relation that relates to itself relatingly, I bubered around for three pages." Hence buber, n. one who bubers. "When my mistake was pointed out to me, I felt like a complete buber."   derrida . From a old French nonsense refrain: "Hey nonny derrida, nonny nonny derrida falala."   gadam , v. To expound the meaning of abstruse writings, dreams, arcane and necromantic symbols, and the rest of the universe, in ways pleasing to the humanist. Hence, gadamer, n. one who gadams. Hence, also the adjective, gadam, gadamer, gademest, of or pertaining to the activity of gadaming. "I done my gadamest."   heidegger , n. A ponderous device for boring through thick layers of substance. "It's buried so deep we'll have to use a heidegger."   kripkography , n. The opposite of cryptography: the art of translating a meaningless message (about, e.g., de re necessity) into expressions that an uninitiated observer would take to be straightforwardly meaningful (e.g., "Look, it's not so hard. All he's saying is that since the term is a rigid designator, it refers to the same thing in all possible worlds"). "He used to claim he just 'couldn't understand' essentialism, but now, thanks to kripkography, he just sits there nodding and smiling."    kuhn , n. A fox often mistaken for a hedgehog; it is usually attended by such a commotion that it appears more than twice as heavy as it really is.    mctaggart , n. A black hole which not only sheds no light but in which time stands still. "Some mctaggarts are rather broad."   moore , v. To try to win an argument by taking something out of your pocket. "I couldn't think of anything to say so I hauled off and moored him."   rort , n. m. (1) an incorrigible report; hence, rorty, adj. incorrigible. n. (2) Fashionable but confused discourse. "Don't talk rort."   taylor , v. (in the idiom, to taylor the argument) To defend an absurd position or conclusion by inventing equally absurd premises or inferences; as in. "It's easy to get a proof of fatalism if you know how to taylor the argument." Also, taylor's dummy, an absurd principle on which to hang bits of metaphysical nonsense. My hope is that someday I will make an important contribution to philosophy and be immortalized by a silly pun in the philosophical lexicon.  I would encourage readers to come up with their own creative entries and post them in the comments.

      When many Christians are posed this question, I think they are tempted to start spouting the classic arguments for the existence of God.  Honestly, that may be the correct answer for some people, particularly those who came to have a relationship with God by examining those arguments (like C. S. Lewis).  My answer is different, though, and I suspect my response probably ought to be along the same lines of most Christians.   The reason I don’t appeal to any arguments for the existence of God is because I did not learn these arguments until much later in my Christian life.  In other words, I clearly believed in the existence of God prior to discovering cogent proofs for God’s existence (and, yes, I believe there a numerous successful arguments for God’s existence).  When I was six years old and committed my life to Jesus, I am certain I did not even know there was a cosmological, teleological, axiological, or any other “-ological” argument for God’s existence.  I would say that I knew God directly.  No argument, no logical proof, no Bayesian formula.  Scripture tells that God, through the work of the Holy Spirit reveals himself to us in a complete way, which gives us assurance of our faith (Rom. 8:15-16; Col. 2:2; 1 Thes. 1:5).  So, how do I know God exists?  I know there is a God because he has revealed himself to me through the Holy Spirit, and through that direct relationship with God, I am aware of his presence.  It is important that I mention a caveat or two about this answer.  First, I don’t expect to use this inner testimony of the Holy Spirit as a convincing way to explain to others why they should believe in God.  Most non-Christians would find such a response to be comical at best.  Second, this does not mean there is no place for the arguments of God’s existence.  The arguments may be useful in showing others powerful and compelling reasons to embrace the Christian worldview (Col. 4:6; 1 Pet. 3:15).  Moreover, these arguments can confirm the inner witness that the Holy Spirit has given Christians.  My point is that these arguments have a lot of good uses, but for me, one of them is not convincing me to believe in God.  The Holy Spirit does that in much more powerful way than any argument can.

      After watching  Casablanca , I have decided to compile the ten most relevant quotes from the movie and apply them to my life.  I think this proves eisegesis can extend beyond the Bible.    1.   Rick : “Here’s looking at you, kid.”   Sometimes a man finds the right words to endear his girlfriend, and Rick nails it perfectly with this line.  Granted, I’m not as smooth as Rick, but I’ve had some good moments.  These moments are dedicated to this quote!   2.   Ivonne : “Where were you last night?”   Rick : “That was so long ago, I can’t remember.”   Ivonne : “Will I see you tomorrow?”   Rick : “I never make plans that far ahead.”   Rick always knows the smoothest lines in how to deal with women who are constantly nagging him.  It goes without saying that I need to have a whole stock of these lines too.   3.   Capt. Renault : “And what in heaven’s name brought you to Casablanca?”  Rick  “My health.  I came here for the waters.”  Renault : “Waters? What waters? We are in the middle of the desert.”  Rick  “I was misinformed.”   This describes how I felt at Baylor.  I came for promised goods, only to discover I was misinformed.   4.  Renault : “Rick is the kind of man, if I were a woman, and I weren’t around, I should be in love with Rick.”   This is one of those unplanned homosexual moments in classic movie history.  God only knows how many of these types of Freudian slips have fallen out of my mouth throughout my life.   5.  Rick : “Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine. . .”   This classic line fits my life in two ways.  First, it seems that I can’t avoid my ex-girlfriends.  Whenever I accidentally run into one of them, I always think of this line.  Second, in a positive way, I say this line when I accidentally meet someone beautiful and wonderful beyond all my expectations.  I wonder, why am I so lucky?   6.  Rick : “How long was it we had, honey?”  Ilsa : “I didn't count the days.”  Rick : “Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one.  A wild finish.  A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out.”   This quote memorializes the one time my heart truly got broken.  Like Rick, I totally fell head over heels for a girl who broke my heart in a terrible way.  I can’t think of a better description for this feeling than “a guy . . . with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out.”   7.  Strasser : My impression was that he was just another blundering American.  Louis : We mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918.   This exchange between two Germans reminds me of what atheists are saying about Christian philosophers today.  As Christians continue to increase throughout the discipline, some non-Christians have the attitude that we are just more blundering Christians.  A great reply to this would be “We mustn’t underestimate Christian blundering.  I was there when Plantinga’s blunder solved the logical problem of evil, when Swinburne explicated a successful probable argument for God’s existence, when Craig presented a cogent cosmological argument, when van Inwagen decisively refuted compatibilism . . .”   8.  Rick : “Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean - what you're fighting for?”  Laszlo : “You might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.”   This is great quote from the movie.  In some ways, I identify my calling in Christian apologetics, philosophy, and ministry to have this kind of impetus.  By the way, movies nowadays don’t say powerful things like this any more because it would be overtly pro-war.  Try this as a fun game: try to imagine what current liberal players in Hollywood would say during in World War II.   8.  Rick : “We'll always have Paris.”   . . .and I’ll always have Texas. . .   10.   Rick : “This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”   This is my attitude in Michigan.  The prospects for collaboration in acts of mischief and tomfoolery seem to be good here.  Yes, this does seem like the beginning of a beautiful friendship . . .

      This line comes from the movie  Meet Joe Black , the 1999 remake of the classic movie, "Death Takes a Holiday."  There is a scene early in the movie where Brad Pitt’s character is the "super-me."  He’s funny, charming, brilliant, and a smooth gentleman.  Susan (ably played by Claire Forlani) is putty in his hands.  Immediately after meeting Susan, Pitt’s character is killed in a delightful car accident (completely unbeknownst to Susan).  Then, Death incarnate assumes the body of Pitt’s character, and meets Susan again as Death (once again, completely unbeknownst to Susan).  Of course, this time his personality is much different, and she poses the question that is the title of this blog.  This made me wonder.   Am I really the fun, happy, smooth character at the beginning of the movie,  or  am I the quirky, awkward, out of place character throughout the rest of the film?  I believe I once was the suave Pitt character, but now I’m death incarnate to the ladies.  I’m not sure what exactly has done this, but perhaps I can blame my intensive studies.  I ponder this thought because of Death’s response to her question, with which I will close this blog:   "I’m sometimes not quite at home around people.  I get busy doing what it is I do.  And I don’t seem to have developed....  I have a certain function to perform, and it seems to take up most of my time.  But sometimes I speculate.  But I haven’t left room for anything else."

      In the latest issue of  Faith and Philosophy   urlLink Lynne Rudder Baker  penned an article entitled, "Why Christians Should Not be Libertarians: An Augustinian Challenge" [ Faith and Philosophy  20, no. 4 (2003): 460-78].  The basic gist of the article is to explain how essential Christian doctrines (original sin, predestination, and divine causation) cannot cohere with libertarian freedom.  Thus, Baker claims we ought to be compatibilists because compatibilism makes the best sense of these doctrines, while libertarian freedom complicates matters.  Baker’s fine work is intriguing, but in the end I have to confess it is built on weak grounds.   First, in order to prove her theological doctrines are only consistent with compatibilism, she cites Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, and Jonathan Edwards as her theological authorities.  The problem here is that all of these theologians are compatibilists themselves!  So, Baker fails to capture the big theological picture behind these core Christian doctrines.  If she had consulted Irenaeus, Luis de Molina, Menno Simons, Jacob Arminius, John Wesley, and numerous contemporary theologians, she would have a more realistic consensus on what are the essentials to core these Christian doctrines.  Since Baker has not done this, she has only shown compatibilism is most consistent with compatibilist theologians, which is a hollow victory at best.  My second critique is that Baker fails to see the overwhelming philosophical difficulties with compatibilism.  Most Christian philosophers are not willing to embrace compatibilism as an easy answer to major doctrinal issues because compatibilism seems like a contradiction.  For example, if compatibilism is true, then it would be true that God causes a person to perform a free act.  But to talk that way is contradictory.  Just because I can say, “I see the invisible man,” does not make it intelligible.  Since compatibilism is too philosophically far-fetched, many Christian philosophers are going to avoid it all costs, even if it presents solutions to issues of interest to Christians.  Similarly, denying the laws of logic would relieve all apparent contradictions in Christian doctrines, but no one is willing to make this move because the philosophical price is too steep, even in light of its benefits.  I think compatibilism is in similar company.  I have more to say on this topic, but I think you get the point.  Baker has much more work to do before she shows that Christians should be compatibilists.  For me, Christianity makes best sense through a libertarian understanding of freedom.

      For some reason, the girls I feel my strongest animosity and bitterness toward are those whom I wanted to date but never gave me a chance.  I know all of my readers must find the existence of girls who would turn me down as a logical impossibility, but trust me, they’re out there.   I’d also like to add that I am equally perplexed by their existence as well.  Back to my point...  When I reflect on my numerous dating relationships, none of them really irks me like my memory of Christy Glasow.  Christy was the girl I always had a crush on in high school.  After years of trying to get a date with her, she finally does.   But then , on the night of the big date, she stood me up!  I never got to go on a date with her.  I heard she started dating some older guy, and I never heard from her again.  To this day, that memory evokes stronger feelings than any other.  Stuff like this sticks for years.  For crying out loud, I’ve been carrying this one around for about six years!  The funny thing is that I can’t tell you the names of the last three girls whom I dated for almost a year each without thinking hard.

      Here are blogs I try to visit every day, and I think you should check them out too.  I first have to give credit to  urlLink Matt Gierhart’s Blog  because it inspired me to start my own.  I hope he keeps blogging now that he’s back in the states.   urlLink God, the World, and Other Things  is an interesting blog that I forced my friend Michael to create. Michael is a good writer, and it’s unfortunate he can’t blog more often.  I especially enjoyed his comments on  urlLink Christians and Tattoos .  (His other blog,  urlLink The Instant of Irony , is about Kierkegaard... check it out too!)  Max Goss, a philosophy PhD student at the University of Texas, authors the blog  urlLink In Hoc Signo Vinces .  I enjoy his sharp cultural and political criticisms.  For more straightforward philosophy check out  urlLink Certain Doubts , an epistemology blog headed up by  urlLink Jonathan Kvanvig  (although it has numerous esteemed contributors).  The  urlLink Prosblogion  is a clever title for a thought-provoking philosophy of religion blog, which I highly recommend.  One of my favorite theological oriented blogs is  urlLink Doug’s Theology Blog .  I think the main reason I enjoy it is his strong anti-Calvinism.  We need more of those...  A blog that simultaneously exhibits creative writing and disturbing stories is  urlLink What’s the Buzz? , authored by one of favorite friends in Abilene.  So these are blogs I checkout everyday, which perhaps says something about me and my choice of friends...  If you haven't looked at these blogs, go check 'em out!

      I'm looking for my faithful reader(s) to give me some critical feedback.  Let me know what I can do to improve an  urlLink article  I recently wrote in defense of the Doctrine of the Trinity.  Thanx!

      Lately I've felt extremely sluggish.  Not depressed or sedated, but I would go the whole day feeling like I do for the first ten minutes when I wake up (except it wouldn't go away).  This morning I made coffee, and I already feel better.  I am trying to break my dependence on coffee, so I would welcome any suggestions from my educated readers.  And since today's blog is on the random side, I would also like to inform everyone that today is  laundry day .  This one of the few times when you call something "______ day," and it's not particularly exciting.  Some might even say it is postively mundane.

      Apparently I am behind on the times.  Less than a week ago the word " urlLink metrosexual " was introduced into my vocabulary.  My first understanding of "metrosexual" was of a man who was concerned with the smallest details of his appearance, especially his hair, clothes, and fingernails.  But after some reflection, I'm not really sure if metrosexuality is not just a euphemism in Western culture to denote self-absorption in males.  Maybe as a neophyte to cultural jargon I'm alienated from its precise meaning, but no matter how I've tried to understand the word, it just seems like good old selfishness and pride.

      I have always admired John Wesley, even when I’ve disagreed with him. Recently, I have meditated on Wesley’s  urlLink "Address to Clergy" , which should be required reading for all Christians. In this address, Wesley has two aims: "First, What manner of men ought we to be? Secondly; Are we such, or are we not?"  Wesley investigates matter of character, calling, and education. Just about every minister I know (including myself) can improve on these matters. Moreover, his standard for education among the clergy seems very distant from what is expected of ministers. He challenges the clergy to be learned in logic, history, Biblical languages, philosophy, the sciences, and detailed knowledge of the early church and its "Fathers." When I was in seminary, if they required ministers to do all of the above, most of the students would have become communication majors. But I side with Wesley on this issue. Sure, it’s a lot of stuff to learn, but isn’t it important to be prepared for one’s calling to follow God than to take the easy road? At one time ministers were considered intellectual giants in their community. You be the judge as to what they have become today. &nbsp; [More Wesley:  urlLink Wesley's Sermons  |  urlLink More Wesleyan Works and Resources ] Ahh, my sweet Wesley...

       One of the most interesting developments in philosophy of religion over the past twenty-five years has been the application of analytic philosophy to higher issues of theology. (In many ways, it is much like a return to the medieval era.) No other idea in classical theology has been impacted by this research than the doctrine of divine immutability. In the classic sense, immutability means absolutely immovable, unable to change in any way. Given Aristotle’s metaphysics, immutability seemed like a coherent divine trait. Perhaps even a necessary one. Nonetheless, this doctrine has been brought into question for two key reasons.  First, many philosophers find the notion of God being temporal to be convincing. If God exists in time, then he must undergo some change. For example, God’s knowledge of what is past, present, and future, would constantly be changing with each moment of time.  Second, a careful examination of the classical notion of immutability made it difficult, if not impossible, to reckon the God of the philosophers to be the same as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Joseph. If God cannot change at all, how does he have a relationship with us? How does prayer work? How did he become incarnate? The Bible seems to speak of God as a more dynamic being than just an unchangeable mover.  Of course, the Bible does speak of God remaining the same throughout the ages, and rejecting classical immutability does not mean one is left with a waffling God. Rather, I lean towards the proposal that God remains essentially the same in his character. In that sense he is immutable, which is why he is trustworthy. On the other hand, God is still able to change, but this ability to change never compromises his divine character. In fact, it is precisely because he can change in these ways that God is the awesome being that Christians can enter into a dynamic relationship with.

      Here’s one way to determine if your moving company is taking too long to deliver your stuff:   if while you are waiting you buy an 18 oz jar of peanut butter and empty it making PB&J sandwiches before your stuff is delivered .  As many of my insightful readers may have surmised, I just passed this mark.  At first, I was elated to discover I had actually finished a whole jar of crunchy peanut butter.  But, then, it struck me: I just finished a whole jar of crunchy peanut butter!  Unfortunately, I could not conduct a “jelly test” because I bought two different types of jelly in order to give me some semblance of variety.  I was told by Allied that my stuff should be delivered by this Friday (no less than 15 days past the latest estimate they originally gave me).  Moreover, since they have not lived up to any promises they have made thus far, I’m not sure if I can expect to have furniture before the weekend.  If not, tomorrow I crack open a 40 oz. jar of peanut butter, and should I empty that one before my stuff arrives, I think I’m legally permitted to go to the national headquarters and… and… and… uh, do really bad things.

        urlLink   The Beatles released  urlLink Revolver  in 1966.  Often, it is heralded as their greatest recording.  One reason for this is that the album emerged as the “old Beatles” (you know, the guys who dress alike and sing “yeah, yeah, yeah” songs) were being replaced by the “new Beatles” (the ones with longer hair who did drugs).  Revolver brought together the best of both worlds in a creative blend.  In my opinion, Revolver demonstrates how the Beatles could individually write great songs.  For example, George Harrison’s  Taxman  is a sarcastically humorous take on taxes (probably in light of how much of the Beatles income went to taxes).  Harrison also succeeded with  I Want to Tell You , an upbeat song that conveys the frustration of having something to say but having no way to spit it out.  Now, I should point out that George failed miserably with his song  Love You To .  In  Love to You  George didn’t realize that the sitar would never become an appealing instrument in popular Western culture.  I always skip this song.  It really hurts to listen to more than four seconds of it.  Incidentally, John Lennon hated this song so much, he refused to play for its recording.  John wrote some experimental songs on the album, such as  Tomorrow Never Knows , which reflects the later avant garde style he would try out with Yoko Ono.   Doctor Robert  is an ambiguous tune, which is arguably about a doctor who would prescribe certain clients happy medicine.  John wrote the trippy tune  She Said She Said  based on an LSD induced conversation.  Although John does return to traditional songwriting like the guitar duet  Your Bird Can Sing  and his song about sleep deprivation,  I’m Only Sleeping .  But the reason I truly love Revolver is for the songs Paul McCartney wrote.   Here, There, and Everywhere  could be Paul’s best written love song of his career.  In passing, I would like to note that I use this song as a test for love relationships.  I’ve always wanted to be with a girl to whom I could sincerely sing that song.  Paul explores themes of religion, death, and meaning in the symphonic  Eleanor Rigby .  Once again, another landmark in Paul’s songwriting career.  Paul brings a positive note into the album with  Good Day Sunshine , which can put anyone into a good mood just by hearing it.  Paul writes a bittersweet love ballad with  For No One , a song that is beautiful because I’ve never experienced it.  Finally, Paul wrote  Got to Get you Into my Life  as an ambiguous allusion to his experimentation with LSD.  Despite its subject matter, the song sports the Beatles attempt at Motown with its full brassy sound.  This is another one of those songs that can instantaneously put you in a good mood.  Revolver might be my favorite Beatles album.  It’s hard to pick one.  At any rate, its musical and lyrical content provides one with plenty to think about and enjoy.  I think I’m going to listen to it right now.

      Allied Van lines has an  urlLink online delivery tracker , which sounds cool.  So far, it doesn't seem to be much help.  Nonetheless, I want to make sure everyone can join in the fun!  For "Reg #" put in 330701, and for "Agency" type "and".   Click on submit, and then you get to partake in the magic.

      How embarrassing.  I spent a good portion of my past evening sitting in my apartment (which has no furniture) listening to  urlLink Chicago’s Greatest Hits (1982-1989)  reminiscing how I was a fool for leaving girlfriends from middle school (which, incidentally I never had) while the following lyrics played in the background:  What kind of man would I be, living a life without any meaning.  And I know you could surely survive without me but if I had to live without you, tell me what kind of man would I be.   The good news is that my furniture is supposed to be delivered by this Friday.  The bad news is that all my ex-girlfriends have married rich men and now probably make fun of me.  I guess that’s just part of every man’s life though.  I think being forced to live off the floor of one’s apartment is conducive for depression.  I’m not really depressed, but the following lyrics ringing in my ears brings me down:  You’re the meaning in my life, you’re the inspiration.  You bring feeling to my life.  You’re the inspiration.  I wanna have you near me.  I wanna have you hear me it.  No one needs you more than I need you.   The obvious solution would be to turn Chicago off and destroy the CD.  True.  Still, there is that satisfaction in feeling crappy that often comes with self-pity.  Plus, I don’t have much around me to cheer me up anyway.  I think I’d rather kick myself for letting all those now seemingly flawless girls get away than put on the Counting Crows and feel better.   Being without you takes a lot getting used to.  I should learn to live with it.  But I don’t want to.  Being without you is all a big mistake.  Instead of getting any easier, it’s the hardest thing to take.  I’m addicted to you, baby.  You’re a hard habit to break.

      Another reason I am not a Calvinist is that God’s providence is hardly praiseworthy.  Contrary to the rhetoric furnished by Calvinists, God’s glory is diminished on their view.  For God simply determines exactly what will take place in accordance with his will.  An omnipotent two-year-old could exercise this kind of providence.  As I understand God’s providence, he is praiseworthy because he wisely works with utterly free creatures who continuously rebel against his will, yet he is still able to accomplish his desired end.  This kind of providence would require vast wisdom (dare I say omniscience) in order to work.  Moreover, this providence demonstrates genuine love and respect for free creatures, rather than forcing them to do whatever he wills like some kind of divine rape.  In the end, this comes out to be a praiseworthy providence.  I am reminded of Paul’s words in Romans 11:33: “Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!”

      I love these things:  To me, it's a good idea to carry around two sacks of something when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, "Hey can you give me a hand?" you can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."    Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine which is probably why most of us died of tuberculosis.    If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, do you think it would be okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures? To teach him some tricks? But only if you're serious about adopting the vulture.    Broken promises don't upset me, I just think, why did they believe me?    I hope that after I die, people will say of me: "That guy sure owed me a lot of money".     You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown that makes people happy, but inside, he's real sad. Also, he has sever diarrhea.    If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to say is, "God is crying". If the kid asks why, a cute answer would be, "Probably because of something you did".    Here's a good trick: Get a job as a judge at the Olympics. Then, if some guy sets a world record, pretend that you didn't see it and go, "Okay, is everybody ready to start now?"    If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though, it's Hambone.    When you go in for a job interview, I think a good idea is to ask them if they ever press charges.    I think the mistake a lot of us make is thinking the state-appointed shrink is our friend.    If Alien was my friend, I'd like to be with him when he went to the dentist. When they started drilling, he'd probably go nuts and start eating everybody. That Alien!    "Of all the imaginary friends I've had, I don't think there was one that I didn't end up having to kill."

      Recently a Norwegian man decided the best way to complain about McDonald's was to dress up like Ronald McDonald and make a big scene until the police had to come and take him away in handcuffs. [I couldn't make this one up,  urlLink check out the news article .]  This makes me wonder about future possibilities for complaining at restaurants.  If I am displeased with Red Lobster, ought I dress up like a huge red lobster and rail diatribes in the restaurant until the police have to haul me away?  Should I complain to Hooters by dressing up as an owl and hooting my displeasures up until I am arrested?  I'm not sure if the method is very effective at communicating to management your grievances or getting your money back.  But one thing is for certain: you'll get to go to jail and read about it in the news.

      Analytic philosophy of religion has erupted with a number of different ways of dealing with the issue of divine foreknowledge and human freedom [for more see  urlLink Linda Zagzebski's article  in the  urlLink Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  and/or  urlLink my M.A. in religion thesis ].  One of the dividing issues on this subject is whether divine foreknowledge and human freedom are compatible.   Theological compatibilists  in accord with their name believe the two can intelligibly coexist, while  theological incompatibilists  claim they are not compatible.  Aside from my belief that there are solid arguments that demonstrate theological compatibilism, as a Christian I think there is another route I would take to safeguard my views against theological incompatibilism.  I recognize the Bible broadly portrays God with foreknowledge and humans as free, and if I can't figure it out, I assume it is beyond my abilities to figure it out.  To budge on either God's foreknowledge or human human freedom seems to risk sacrificing something too important.  I'd rather take God at his word and accept my own ignorance.  Fortunately, I am brilliant and have discovered some cogent arguments that show the rationality of my position.

      I am currently working on a popular writing I want to put on  urlLink my website  defending the Christian doctrine of hell.  The focus of my apologetic will emphasize the seriousness of sin as an infinite separator humans put between themselves and God and on God's character of justice.  I plan on discussing other issues like free choice, God's love, and the fact that hell is not a place of physical torture as an unskilled reader of Dante may think.  I'll post another blog to announce the completion of this work.  Any insights from my readers is welcome.

      Lately I’ve been listening to  urlLink Dashboard Confessional .  Dashboard is an acoustic, emo-ish band that mainly writes cathartic songs about dating.  While large doses of Dashboard can lead to depression and unhealthy obsessive thoughts about why she stopped calling me when I’ve done nothing wrong—I mean, did I say something wrong? Is she interested in someone else? Does she think I’m gay?... Sorry, I seem to have digressed.  The following song, “Again I Go Unnoticed,” has been especially helpful:  So quiet another wasted night, the television steals the conversation exhale, another wasted breath, again it goes unnoticed.   Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break out of touch, out of time. Please send me anything but signals that are mixed cause I can't read your rolling eyes out of touch, are we out of time?   Close lipped another goodnight kiss is robbed of all it's passion, your grip another time, is slack it leaves me feeling empty.   I'll wait until tomorrow maybe you'll feel better then maybe we'll be better then so what's another day when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you this mood of yours is temporary it seems worth the wait to see your smile again out of the corner of your eye wont be the only way you'll look at me then.

      I’ve decided to do a segment on blog focusing on a cool Beatles’ album once a week.  After all these years, the Beatles will finally receive their due by being acknowledged on my blog.  Don’t worry, I’ll notify the press.  First, I would like to turn to their self-titled album, popularly known as the   urlLink White Album  .  This two disc (originally vinyl, now available on CD) album was composed in 1968 as a follow up to their creative and sophisticated work, Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Sgt. Pepper featured an extravagantly colored cover with equally elaborate musical pieces.  At the time, most critics believed the Beatles could not outdo this major production.  The genius of the White Album is that the Beatles made it a simple album comprised mostly of simple acoustic guitar tracks.  Rather than trying to surpass the grandeur of Sgt. Pepper, the Beatles displayed beauty through simple, basic songs.   Martha My Dear  is one of my favorite songs on the album.  The song is primarily carried by the piano and catchy, melodic vocals.  George Harrison sports one of his best compositions,  While My Guitar Gently Weeps , which shows his maturing abilities as a songwriter that would be more evident later in the Beatles and in his solo career.  Songs like  The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill ,  Piggies ,  Rocky Raccoon , and  Cry Baby Cry  have a narrative feel like country music.  These songs add an eclectic mix to the album, which leave first time listeners delightfully surprised at what could come next.  Paul McCartney contributes playful works like  Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da  and  Wild Honey Pie , which easily elicit smiles from Beatles’ patrons.  Paul’s well-known  Blackbird  appears on this album as well, which is a staple for all acoustic guitar players.  Ballads like  I Will  and  Julia  are perfect for those romantics in need of a fresh and simple exposition of love.  The album rocks out with  Everybody’s Got Something to Hide Except Me & My Monkey ,  Helter Skelter , and  Back in the U.S.S.R. .  In short, the White Album has something for everybody.  In one album, the Beatles capture in beautiful simplicity a broad range of genres.  Not only did the Beatles manage to produce successfully a good album after the wide success of Sgt. Pepper, but they truly made a fresh, innovative contribution to popular music itself.

      So, I’m reading  urlLink The Idiot  (I know it’s not listed on the “What I’m Currently Reading List,” but it’s a pain to update all the time), and I came across some dialog that was absolutely spectacular.  The “idiot” is talking to some women, and he gives all of them an assessment of their lives based on their faces except for the most beautiful one among them.  They ask him if he thinks she is beautiful and in response he says, “ you are extraordinarily beautiful Aglaya Ivanovna.  You are so pretty, one is afraid to look at you .”  I wish I could have thought of such great words.

      Upon moving to Michigan, I entered into the Eastern time zone.  Everyone I know lives in the others, so my time is later than theirs.  So, when I'm on the phone with them, I like to joke about how I'm calling them from the  future .  Needless to say, most people respond by saying it's not the future, it's just the differences between time zones.  They are completely unphased by my clearly witty observation and application of time zones.  Still, I'm resolute on using this joke until people respond appropriately.  It's bound to happen eventually.

      1. God is Omniscient [For any fact  f , God knows  f  perfectly] 2.  Some facts are essentially  tensed  [ f 1   is tensed if the truth-value of  f 1   essentially depends on it occurring relative to  now ] 3. Therefore, since God is omniscient and knows tensed facts, he too must exist in a tensed state, which is a fancy way of saying God is temporal.  Premise 1 seems uncontroversial.  Premise 2 requires a tensed understanding of facts, which is the tricky premise.  In short, saying some facts are tensed recognizes that there is a difference in saying: (a) I have a meeting at 4:30 pm Friday; (b) I have a meeting now.  There is something about the reference of  now  that cannot be substituted or translated into other expressions of the same fact.  Premise 3 is a clear consequent from premises 1-2.  Let me add that this is a good thing too.  If God only knows facts tenseslessly, then God would know that you prayed for help at 6:27 pm, Friday, July 3, 2004, but he would not know if you were praying for it now or even if it had already passed.  Without knowledge of the present, God would know a series of facts without knowing when they occurred in relation to  now .  Of course, this assumes the A-theory of time, but perhaps I’ll blog more about this later.

      As I may have alluded to previously, I just moved to Michigan (hence, the long silence in my blogging).  The first sign I came across looks like this:     I thought this was a bizarre way to welcome someone to Michigan.  My guess is that this slogan must be based on the two most fond memories stated by those polled who were leaving Michigan.  First place="Great Lakes"; second="Great Times."  I am now officially living in Michigan.  Currently I have no furniture.  I do have, however, my computer and some clothes.  Today I met a fellow philosophy grad student, James, who showed me around.  Thus far, I have experienced great times.  Looking forward to the great lakes....

      Remember when the USA olympic basketball team was called  The Dream Team  because it had Michael Jordon, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and a dozen other monumental players on its roster?  The current so-called "Dream Team" got trounced by Puerto Rico,  urlLink 92-73 .  That's ugly.  They lost the lead before halftime and never regained it.  This means they didn't lose by some technicality or a fluke moment in the fourth quarter.  The other team just beat them in a bad way.  Why is this so?  I share some of the sentiments of  urlLink Bill Simmons , who suggests that we didn't pick the best roster for this year's team.  I think there's also something to be said about the current state of the NBA.  While there are some outstanding players like Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, and Tracy McGrady, there still isn't that same immortal essence that one associates with Jordan, Bird, and Magic.  Even while they were still playing they achieved this demigod status.  I wish the current US olympic basketball team the best, and I would watch them if I had a tv.  But they aren't a  Dream Team .  Lately, they've shown they are the   Creamed Team  .  (I know it was cheesy, but I couldn't think of a better way to end this post.)

      Lately I've been reading (among other things)  urlLink N. T. Wright's  ( urlLink another Wright link ) landmark work on the resurrection,  urlLink The Resurrection of the Son of God .  I'm still working through this book (hoping to finish it before the semester starts), but already I can see why Wright is a significant cut above the rest of scholarship.  First, he writes with clarity.  Moreover, he brings clarity to a large sampling of data.  For example, he distinguishes five meanings of the word "history," so when he critiques others or uses the word himself, there is no doubt what he is getting at.  Wright is generous to contemporary scholarship, but quick to point out how his peers are imprecise with their analysis.  Another real strength in Wright's work is his prolific background in other disciplines.  He goes between the worlds of Homer, Plato, Virgil, Moses, Isaiah, Daniel, Antiochus, Jesus, and Paul demonstrating expertise.  Once again, he regularly brings clarity to these gargantuan and clouded issues.  A final word of praise I will mention in this post is that the apparent impetus behind his work is getting to the primary sources.  Wright is concerned with answering questions that address the origins of these beliefs.  Why did Christianity continue powerfully despite the death of its leader?  Why did the earliest Christians believe what they did?  Wright skillfully shows how many modern scholars present intriguing insights, but fail to answer significant questions like these.  Moreover, by focusing on primary sources, Wright regularly shows that scholarship goes awry when it disregards a wealth of information that sheds precious light on the people and world from which these ideas originated.  For those unfamiliar with N. T. Wright, I urge you consider making yourself acquainted with his work.

      Within the past couple of hours a new edition of the online mag,  urlLink the new celebrity , came out.  My friend Matt heads up the project, although the web-mag sports a number of contributions from his friends (most importantly  me ).  First, go check out  urlLink www.thenewcelebrity.com .  After doing that, come back and read the next paragraph.  I'm impressed with Matt's work.  The  new celebrity  is definitely a work of visual and literary art.  I think it is a real show of creativity and artistic talent.  Still, I was somewhat frustrated with this latest issue.  It took a long time to load the pages on my dial-up connection, which was exasperated by taking several attempts to learn how to navigate through the pages.  To be honest, I'm not even sure if I've seen everything on the latest mag because the navigation through it is confusing.  I'm also a little perturbed by the fact that Matt axed (in my opinion) my brilliant contribution to the mag and he published my weaker contribution.  While I am impressed by the new format with its fusion of new images and fonts, I found it difficult to read some of the entries or follow their flow.  Maybe I'm just not postmodern enough to get it...  Returning to the positive side, I thought Josh's piece on how to write a composition was a creative and humorous commentary on writing.  Indeed, this was probably the strongest piece in this edition.  While part of me longs for the format of the first issue, I'm hopeful that the new issue will grow on me.  (After all, when I first heard Pearl Jam's  No Code  I hated it, but now I love it.)

      In some recent research, I had the opportunity to reflect on how influential Saint Augustine has been on setting the theological agenda for Christianity.  This has had some good and bad consequences.  Augustine stressed the sovereignty of God and fallenness of human beings, which are important points in Christian theology.  I would much rather see Augustine's general view of these things followed than Pelagius's.  The downside is that when Augustine got something wrong, it has taken thousands of years for the church to recover from his error.  For example, Augustine based his theology of original sin on the Vulgate's incorrect translation of Romans 5:12, which suggested that all humans sinned in Adam.  The Greek text, however, bespeaks a different truth, namely that because of death all sin.  In practice, one big difference in these two views is that Augustine's view requires infant baptism to wash away this original sin of which all people are born guilty.  On these specific doctrines where Augustine's analysis is questionable, Christian theology has struggled to free itself from these mistakes.

      Recently, I accidentally found the blog of an old friend who I haven't spoken to for over a year.  Ok, it wasn't just a friend, it was an ex-girlfriend.  I was pleasantly surprised, and wanted to leave a comment on her blog just for sake of indirectly saying, "hey, I found your blog."  I realized this wasn't a good idea for a couple of reasons.  First, I haven't talked to this person in years.  It is possible that the last thing she wants is to communicate with me.  Second, I'm not exactly thrilled at the prospect of re-opening the door to resume normal communication.  My typical policy with ex-girlfriends is to burn all bridges.  This is possible when you leave the state.  ( Holy crap!!!  I just realized George Strait's song " urlLink All My Ex's Live in Texas " describes my life.  What a revelation! )  Despite the fact it was a cool discovery, it is an experience I will have to keep to myself.  ...and all of this brings back feelings of guilt.  Why am I so good at hurting nice girls?  I'm a bad person.  No female should be allowed to be nice to me.  I'm considering living the quiet life of a hermit so I cannot harm anyone.   Bad John!  Bad John!

      I think that there is good reason based on the doctrine of the atonement to conclude that God is in time.  If God is timeless, then he never has complete victory over sin.  This is because if God is timeless, then all reality is simultaneously present and real before him in his “eternal now.”  This would mean that sin is eternally present before God.  It never goes away.  It never diminishes.  In fact, Jesus’ death on the cross is forever before his eyes.  Of course, God is aware of his victory over sin and the resurrection, which are also eternally present before him.  However, these victories are forever mitigated by the evils that are eternally before God.  If God is timeless, he never has complete victory of sin.  Oddly enough, only creatures in time would have that victory because those who are redeemed will eventually live in heaven where there is no more evil, sin, and death.  So, if it is important for God to have an undivided victory over evil, then God must be in time.

      Once again, I dare to post on the world wide web the deepest darkest secrets of my teenage life.  As I mentioned in  urlLink Confessions of a Teenage Rockstar (pt. 1) , I was in a short-lived band called  Sweet Debris .  Today, I’d like to share another brilliant song I wrote.  This one, entitled " Getting Over the Hill ," is the way I dealt with being rejected by a girl named Hillary (notice the pun).  Once again, this is for your pure entertainment.   "Getting Over the Hill"   Vs. 1  You told me to call you, then I get your machine.  I hear the same tomorrow, and do the same thing.  I ask you why you never call me at home.  You say it's all my fault, the you leave me all alone.    Chorus  You push  The blame  You ruin my name  You show no shame    Vs. 2  You watch me fall, watch me cry  Watch me die, I'll be alright.  I'm passing over this insignificant hill.  You don't even know, you made my heart ill.

      One big issue that has taken center stage for Senator John Kerry's run for the presidency is his service in Vietnam.  This movement has been led by  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  who are using ads and a  book  to promote their claim that Sen. Kerry did not deserve the commendations he was awarded for his service in Vietnam.  I don't think they have a convincing case, but even if they did, this all just amounts to a big stinking red herring.  True, Kerry does seem to talk about his service in Vietnam every other sentence, but I think that's relevant either.  What I care about in this presidential race is who will be a better President.  What Kerry did (or didn't do) in Vietnam is largely irrelevant to the key issues (national security, economy, social issues, etc.).  I'm glad that the Bush campaign is distancing itself from this mess.  It shows that they are concerned with the issues, not mudslinging.  Let's keep in mind that President Bush has some nasty skeletons in his past, which most of the people in the nation have forgiven as part of his misspent youth.  If Kerry has done nasty things in his past, we owe him the same forgiveness we've given Bush.  Let's forget about the red herrings of Kerry's Vietnam record.  Instead, let's evaluate both candidates on the real issues.

      I haven't worked out in detail how I understand the causal relations between God and morality.  Here's some of what I have so far:  If morality is going to be absolute and binding, it needs to come from a divine authority.  Although, I don't think morality is the consequent of God's creative whims.  In other words, I don't think God arbitrarily choose some acts to be good, others bad, and others indifferent.  Some things like rape and infanticide seem to be morally wrong in all possible worlds.  For me, this is like the truths of basic math.  God, even though he is all-powerful could not have forced 1+1 to equal -18.  Of course, the difference between math and morality is that math lacks a moral imperative.  Like my first sentence says, I don't have the details worked out, but here's my rough and ready explanation.  Morality (and math)  need  God to exist.  God being perfectly good and wise knew prior to creation what logical boundaries would pertain to creation.  So, morality exists as a result of God's will and is enforced by his divine authority.  I know I still have a long ways to go, but this is a start.

      I don't want to be one of those guys who is over twenty-five who still listens to music high schoolers think is cool, but I also don't want to be known as listening to some lame music like  urlLink Richard Marx .  So, instead of relying on my own discernment, I've decided to bear my soul to my closest friends and ask for help.  Basically, I want to know if it is okay for me to listen to certain bands.  For example, if I listen to Moby, is that cool or is that lame?  Should I roll down the windows if I wanna play Nirvana's Nevermind album or should I roll the windows up and pretend it's Hoobastank?  Are the Gin Blossoms considered acceptable relics of the nineties or lame rock-pop?  I've been known to listen to Styx, Rush, Billy Joel, Cat Stevens, Van Halen, Neil Diamond, and Kansas--should I be embarrassed to confess this?  Am I too old to claim bands like Evanescence and Nickelback?  Is it acceptable to listen to the Smashing Pumpkins'  Siamese Dream  album nowadays?  If I went on a date and put on Seven Mary Three's  Rock Crown  album would this be a clever move showing my accute taste of music or would it be a demonstration of how "out of touch" I've become?  If you are my real friends, you will love me enough to tell me the truth.

      As you probably noticed, there are some huge changes to my blog.  First, there is  urlLink the new url .  Also, there is this smooth new template.  It should be quick to load, not using a lot of graphics.  Notice that there isn't an ad at the top of the page as well?  Pretty nifty...  I decided to remove the "Click here to read more" option.  It was nice, but it was more annoying to see it when I there wasn't more to read.  I'll try to be a good blogger and keep my posts short.  Bear with me as I work all the bugs out of this...  Let me know what you think of the changes!

      As those of you who know remotely anything about my life already know, I recently made a big move.  In the process of moving, one finds opportunity to discover forgotten treasures of the past.  Lo and behold, I found an old spiral of high school writings.  Before I destroyed the evidence, I saved some gems from it, which I will unashamedly share with my faithful readers.   You can expect to see a few more postings from my high school and middle school writings.  As few of you may be aware, I was the lead singer and guitarist for a punk band called  Sweet Debris .  While we never played any shows as a punk rock band (all of our drummers were fired or quit), I still have some of my masterpieces saved through the notebook.  Today’s sample is my great hit, “ This Day .”  Enjoy. . .    "This Day"    Vs. 1  I tried to miss you, but you were gone too long.  I wanted to kiss you, but you were scared of what might be.  Holding you in my mind... closely... what'll never be.    Chorus  Break my mind.  Change my heart.  Tellin' me, it's all my fault.  Not a word  Can ever say  What you've done to me on this day.    Vs. 2  You're my apathy. You're everything I never cared for.  I tried to play your game, but you broke all the rules.  I showed you my love, and now I'm the fool.    Bridge  Breaking apart...at the seams.  Losing my heart...and my dreams.    I know what you’re thinking: why did John go into philosophy when I should have gone into professional music or creative writing?  Let’s just say I haven’t ruled it out yet.

       Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.  These verses have always been a powerful reminder of the nature of God.   It begins with describing God as one who guards ( phulasso ) us from stumbling--emphasizing his love and concern for us.  This is ultimately demonstrated by making it possible for us to be in his presence and experience great joy (not condemnation).  How can we stand before God and rejoice?  Jesus makes us blameless ( amomos =the LXX uses this as the same word for a sacrifice before God) through his death on the cross.  We don't earn this status.  God graciously grants it.  The doxology continues to describe God's nature.  First, God alone is God.  Nothing else has the status of being God, which is one reason why we worship him.  God alone is worthy of worship because only God is God.  God has  glory ,  majesty ,  dominion , and  authority .  In short, all of these attributes describe God as all-powerful and all-good.  Finally, God is described as  before all time and now and forever .  This does not mean God is timeless.  Rather, it teaches God is not dependent on time.  God's existence is prior to time.  Even time depends on God to exist!  If the big bang model is correct (which is most likely), then it concurs with this observation.  For space and time would literally begin to exist (that is, they are created out of nothing) at the initial moment of the big bang.  God speaks time and space into existence out of nothing.  Wow!  Indeed, God alone is worthy of praise.

      One of the five points of Calvinism is God's irresistible grace.  This might oversimplify things, but the basic idea behind irresistible grace is that when God reveals his grace to anyone it is so compelling that no one can reject it.  I find this hard to believe for a number of reasons, but in this post, I think I'll just focus on one, the Bible.   I was reading Hebrews 12:14-17 this week, which included the command "See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God."  If God's grace is irresistible, then there is nothing we can do to ensure no one falls short of it.  The obvious implication is that God's grace can be resisted to some degree.  In 2 Corinthians 6:1 it says, "we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain."  Once again, the obvious implication is that some who receive God's grace could renounce it in vain.  To make a long story short, I don't see good reason to deny these verses their plain meaning.  I would rather deny Calvin's doctrine of irresistible grace and hold on to the Bible, than keep irresistible grace and compromise the Bible.  More needs to be said, but I think you get the point.

      Right now, I am in a state of strange inner-turmoil concerning certain things in life.  I'm not sure how to explain it without betraying my own privacy.  All I can ask is that you pray for me.  Sometimes things get so complicated.  I am at a total loss right now, which is an unusual feeling for me.  Sometimes I think I'd rather be wrong and resolved than undecided.  Aaarrrggghh!!!  ...pray for me...   [This is the end of the post, so there's no need to click on the link below.]

      Ok, on Wednesday I’m giving a five-minute teaching presentation as part of interview process with  urlLink Kaplan .  Since I’ve had some experience teaching and preaching in front of people, I’m not really bothered by the public speaking aspect of this assignment.  What has me hung up is finding a topic I enjoy, and can be covered in five minutes.  Here’s what I have so far.  My current plan is to teach  urlLink the logical problem of evil .  Several people have told me that this is not a good idea.  It may be too academic, and the employers may think I am some kind of religious fundamentalist.  What else can I do?  Here’s my backup plan.  Why not give a five-minute speech entitled "What I do to people who don’t hire me"?  I would go on for five minutes giving detailed descriptions of how I would key their cars, stalk their families, and burn down their homes.  I see only two possible outcomes: (1) They laugh at it, and hire me, or (2) They are scared to death and hire me.  If they decide to pass me on the position, at least I can tell the police I warned them. . .  If you have any better ideas, I’m all ears.   Disclaimer: Johnny-Dee would   never   commit acts of violence, arson, and terror against anyone solely because they didn’t hire him for a job.  The above story is a fanciful humorous bit with no serious intentions. Also, this is the end of this post, but I can't get the "read more" link to disappear.

      I recently got turned on to the  urlLink Boston Sports Guy  (aka Bill Simmons), who is my favorite sportswriter (I guess technically he is also my least favorite, since he is the only sports columnist I read).  Even if you don't love sports, I think you would benefit from reading some of his work.  I like to dip into his writings every now and then, and I always come away satisfied.  Here are some recommendations:   urlLink The Jeopardy Guy ,  urlLink Laker's Ignore History  (for trading Shaq),  urlLink Bill's Trip to Vegas ,  urlLink Running Commentary on Wrestlemania XX , and  urlLink Dazed and Confused  (A movie review of  Dodgeball ).  Or you can check out the  urlLink index of Bill's articles .  Enjoy!
