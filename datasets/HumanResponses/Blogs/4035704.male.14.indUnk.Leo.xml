      Well lets see how Minky does tonight. He just got his first hit a few seconds ago. In his old stadium. Nice. He got the standing O which was much deserved. It must have been akward for him switching sides of the stadium.  The nomar trade has finally sank in. :'( sigh. We can always pick him up in the off season.   Great game pitching wise for D Lowe. Maybe Theo was right. strange how the first pitch of the game was a grounder right to Minky. Good sign??????  Offense has been okay and to this point (9:11) they have kept it close.   (9:13)  Nice hit by damon up the middle and we've taken the lead.    (9:20)  Damn it! Lowes getting tired. I can tell. Cuddier hit a homerun to tie it. Thank god Embree's warming. Maybe Theo's theory was wrong.   (9:35)  Why is is he still on the mound?... o wait. He's gone. Phew.   (9:40) Crap. hell one to hell two. Jones parked it in the 8th. we have our work to do. Timlins coming on now.   (9:48)  well just who you want up... Minky,Millar and Muller the M&Ms lol. I crack myslef up.   (9:49)  nice a two hit game for Minky. Welcome to the team. Kaplers coming on for him. Good move.   (9:51)  Kapler tries to steal,but gets picked by a mile. Damn. One Down. And Millar Flies out. and its up to muller who saved the game one week ago.   (9:52)  Muller Takes a ball. Next pitch eh hit one bareley fowl. It missed by about twenty feet. Alright a base hit. But now its up to Gutierrez.  He has the most hits (teid with Minky nice)   (9:54)  Youkilis bats for Guiterez. Takes a strike. He swung and missed on the next pitch. Throw gets to the plate and Muller advances. So if Kapler didnt steal, he's on third. The next pitch is a ball in the dirt. Youkilous K's to end the game.  So the game after Nomar leaves, they lose. Omen? Decently played game. Just Lowe missed a few spots and it cost them.   Red Sox:4   Twins:5

      A collective gasp went up in RSN. I cannot belive what I am seeing. We give up Nomar, and get shit. We trade one of our best bats and defnese men for two great defensemen who cant hit for crap. This is a joke. I seriously hope theis was a joke.because its making me laugh.   Red Sox Get:  Doug Menkavitz,Orlando Cabrerra   Cubs Get: Nomar Garciaparra, Matt Murton (minor leauger)   Expos Get:  Alex Gonzalez, Prospects   Twins Get:  Justin Jones  If I met theo, I would kill him. NOW!! I wanted him traded. I knew it would happen, but not for this garbage. I mean come on! This is a joke. It cuts the hot Kevin Millar out of the line up and replaces him and Nomar with to crappy batters. ugh.  This seems like a duqette deal.  I would rather keep Nomar rather than give him up for this dirt. Theo, the boy wonder, what the hell were you thinking?   Edit(6:10) : CBS new is reporting that  The sox had a fifth team in this. We got dave roberts from LA for a prospect.

      Right now the Red Sox are dealing with The Cubs. D-Loew and Nomar for Clement and the montreal will get some prospects for Orlando Cabreara. cabrreara will then be traded to Boston s part of the deal.  Red Sox get: Orlando Cabrera and Matt Clement  Cubs get: Nomar and Derek Lowe  Expos get: Prospects  thats ESPN's deal so far. Updates later.  The only thing is the trade deadline is now only 15 minutes away. They better hurry their asses up...

      Today I'm not expecting anything huge at all. Maybe a few prospects. Nomars departure. And some bum bullpen person that we've gotten throughout the years. Maybe a Livan Hernndez if wer'e lucky. Maybe Lou Merloni again. Even Walker.  What has surprised me to this point is that Randy Johnson hasnt been traded yet. I hope he goes out to LA

      Well i havent been able to watch much of this game becasue my little brohter wants to play video games and i am left without a radio. Whats a sox fan to do? What i know from gameday is that they stranded a ton of people, kapler is three for three right now and that they are up seven to nothing. My dissapointment is how badly they have LOB problems. Why they cant hit the ball is because they cant play small ball. They all have to hit homeruns. Always. they'd have many more wins had they been able to get a clutch single. Even have a drasitally smaller distance between them and the Spankmees. Dont get me wrong. Gabe is what we need. Fast, a good hitter and a good defenseman. I like him. I dont see why we are loooking for someone to platton with him .Hes too good to be wasted. (as i type this, kapler poped out. lol) Might I add that Bronson is pitching well again. I may have been wrong. Hes on a tear right now. I means like three of his losses came due to lack of run support. Hes only given up the one run to this point.(1o:25 pm)  (10:35) Well I've complemented Bronson now hes blowing it three straight hits in the eighth. A run in and two men on. Uh oh.  (10:50) What a night for tek huh? Three hits, and a home run. 8-2  (11:00) they did it. i was shocked that old foulke could close this game out   My play of the game:  Kapler/muller OF assist   Final:   Red Sox: 8   Twins : 2

      Now dont we feel like idiots. The DNC is over. Done with. We paid millions of dollars to protect the city from terror. Traffic lanes were closed. T stops we shut down. To protect us from....what didnt even happen. All of that money di dnothing but stop&nbsp;a protest that lasted for a bout an hour. That was the worst. Its done.   The four day party is over and Bostons up and running again. I thinkit was once again anohter overreation. The only imppact htat was had is that most Bostonians were scatterd on to the cape, down to Florida, out to LA, etc. tis like a bomb dropped and no one is there anymore.   Anywho, the sox play tonight against the Twins. Damn that metrodome.

      Well folks this is it. Nomars final day as a red sox player (BTW anyone know how to say the singular of red sox, I think its Red Sock, but then the X. hmmm... ad it in your comment). Anyway. This is probably it. Randy Johnson will go to New York, and Nomar will leave Boston to go out west.  Why? You ask. Its very simple. Nomar has already declined a 60 million 5 year contract. The indicated that he wont sign with us. So why let him play the rest of the year and let his contract expire, and A. Get no one for him, and B. Have no control over where he goes, when you can trade him now? It makes much more sense that way. So the Nomar fan club can move away, out to where ever Nomar ends up, and I will sit back, drink my soda, and wait for him to sign his contract or get shipped out.  So bon voyage Nomah  Quick question: Since Nomar is leaving, that leaves us with one less player who's name ends in "ar". So now we have on less player whose name to phonetically bash. I mean we can we can strech Muller, but that wont fit. So my quick question is.... Who should we get to fill this phonetic gap?

      I think it has to do with the rain. They came into that game so hot., but that died faster than Ruben stubbard without breakfast once the rains came. So now they lost miserablely tonight. A great pitchign game from borkowski or what ever hsi name was but the red sox offense is just not cutting it. WHY CAN'T WE BUNT GOD DAMN IT!!!!  nomar would have scored after the lead off double. I mean christ. Is Terry afriad of bunting. Not willing to sacrifice the out? Becuase  if th ats the case, He's already doign it with his "swing for the fences" policy. sigh. BTw what a way to got out for Ortiz. See him after the suspension.   Final Score:Red Sox:1                 Orioles:4

The gods of basbeall may not be on our side, but hell , the gods of rain are..... anywho. saved by the rain. lol.  Final Score   Red Sox:0 Orilols:0 Rained Out

      Okay before I start blogging this game, I would like to bring this up. There was a brawl Saturday in case you live under a rock,A-Rod and Jason Varitek&nbsp;got into it. Now Alex Rodriguez claims that he only had a rebuttal at Bronson arroyo (the pitcher). Psh. Sure. Fuck You! Fuck You! Fuck You! Is a simple rebuttal. And he made a motion that said "bring it on" to vartiek. And yet he claimed old varitek started the whole thing. Idiot.   I'd love to complain about this game. But i cant find much. So far, its been solid. Millars keeping with his hot streak (damn. I'm going to open my batting stance) The sox manage twelve without the help of a home run. christ.   My only real problem was that Pedro tried to stay in the game, after what ever injury he got. This is what killed the Sox in Game 7 last year. Pedro's inabiltiy to admit he is tired. Ik now he's a horse, but hes an old horse. He thinks that he can reamain in a game even if he's hurt or tired, but he cant anymore. If he's hurt or tired he should leave the game.&nbsp;   FINAL SCORE: Red Sox: 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orioles:&nbsp;5

      They held it out tonight. If you can belive it. After the dismal start to  the game riding on the heels of the announcments of Tek and Nixon being out for the game. Even when we were up by six, i knew we'd be freaking out at the end. I was right ( I love being right). A fuckign grand slam. Courtesy of Mike Timlin. Who, by the was wus struggling. If he blew this for D. Lowe I would be the first to form a Lynch Mob outside the sox clubhouse.But luckly he got out of it. THANK GOD! And then they brought on Foulke who has scared me shitless everytime he comes on the mound. If he gets the save tis usually a nailbitter. If he blows it, its one that should have been saved. But lukly he gave the Yanks a 1-2-3 inning. PHEW!  So, we won 9-6   Yankees:6   Red Sox:9

      Pedro pitch a complete game four hit, 10 k strikeout. He walked no one. He didn't have a 3 ball on any batter until the 9th. He was thorwing 90 all game. He's back! Its the best start he's had since like 2001.  The offense was good. Six runs, 14 hits, but once again did Dale Szuem Blow it. HE allowed two runners to be cut down at the plate. Off Roco Baldelli.In the same inning. The same dude who threw Dave Roberts at the plate a couple of games ago. Dale is a dumbass. I want cubbage back.

      Strange game so far. The sox are winning 8-1. Crushing the D-Rays. The strange call was when Johnny got called out on interference. It was unintentional, so only he was out. and the sox got the run back promptly. But still, weird if you catch it on SC.    8:34 ITs 13-1 now. Tek hit a shot off the top of the wall with the bases loaded. Almost a grand slam. but I'll take it.   Say hello to the 2003 Red Sox....   9:45  Alright David! A wall ball double. HE has 100 RBIS woo!   10:08 And the game is over. They win. A slaughter. Nice. No bitching to be done here. 4-1 in the last 5. Kick ass.

      The sox ahd a one run lead over the D-raysm courtesy of a solo shot from Gabe Kapler. But They lost that lead when the d-rays scored three with two down. The sox got one back and its 3-2 now. Tek is batting third. All I can say is WTF?   9:00 Damn Toby Hall! HE hits a two run sht on top of another homer. ITs 6-2 Schillings gone. Adamns coming in. I think Terry is trying to drive this team to suicide.   9:08 See? I told you. Adams gave upa homer to the pesky pole. Suicide!   9:25  Its the seventh, but hell they need to get ot work.   10:10  SO the sox are losing 8-3 and they need acolosal comeback in the bottom of the ninth to win.   10:14 The sox anouncers brought up a good point. The sox record after losign thourhg 8 is 3-42. Yikes. No Come Backs for us...   10:20  and they lose.  What a dismal game. They lost 8-3. When all the other teams that are in the wild card hunt lost too. Damn it and were tied for the top too. This was schillings worst game fo the year.

      Well, wake's having an off day, but the sox are playing enough small ball, yes i said small ball, to have a tie game going.  Strange how last night PEdro pitch a Red Sox record for K's. Wake pitches a red sox records for homers given up.  The reason I say that Wakefield's having a bad day, is becasue he's given up 5 homers.Yikes. That ties his personal record, and the club record.  The sox and tigers are now tied at 6.   2:19  Welcome back David! So much for the small ball! A three run homer adn the sox are now up by three. Six runs with no one out! This is last years Red Sox!   2:48  Well, wakefield has done it. 6 Homers. Thats a record. Good thing thje sox are being explosive on offense.   3:22  Youk's got his first two homer game. Homer down the line. kick ass.   3:40 Uh oh. Timlin gave up a bomb. 11-9 now. Gulp.   3:43 I'm in awe. Cabrerra has two doubles. In one game. It usually takes him a whole season to get that!   3:48:  Killed again by Dale Sveum. He let yet anothter runner lose when they shouldn't going home earlier. and cabbrearra was thrown out at home on an attempted sac fly.  I WANT CUBBAGE BACK!   3:57 : Well damon caught it to end the game. The sox give up a total of seven homers but still win. Thats last years sox for you.

      Well, the sox really need a win here. They are under 500 on this road trip which was cruical and was also supposed to be a given. With the D-rays,orioles, and Tigers. But no they had to make it hard. They are 4-5. and now 10.5 out of the east. They need to be over 500.They are 4-5.  The one thing of good news is that they have Ortiz back. Now its 3-2 sox   9:06 : Alright! Youk gets an RBI and gets the sox some needed insurance.   9:11 : Ortiz got on with a hit and he drove in Youk. Kapler was on third. Ortiz got in a run down and Kapler scored. Nice baserunnign from the Red Sox. Wait did jsut say that?   9:17 : Pedro has 11 K's tonight. 96 10 K games for him in his carear.      9:46:  Oh great. Foulke on the mound two outs two strike and he give s up a homer . 7-4 now.   9:48:  Phew! Ball game over.  Well, so far so good. Texas and okland have oboth lost and the angels are teid at 4 with KC. So we win. Pedro pitches a Gem... the most double digit strike out gamesfor a Red Sox pitcher.  Anyway... Goodnight. I'm going to watch SNL.

      Well the sox lost on the road yesterday. Hmmm.. A loss? on the Road? Thats new. They ahd a 3-2 lead over the tigers. Of course a one run lead is a s good as a five run deficet when D-Blow's in the mound. You could be up 17-3 and still be worried about losing with him.  So the lead is now inverted to 4-3 tigers. And leave it to Cabbrera to come up with two outs and the bases loaded. Tieing run on third.Oh, and then Strike out. .085 BA from the new guy. Great.  So the dismal Red Sox are now 10.5 gmaes out of the east 2.5 out of the wild card. Sigh. Thigns just arent getting better.    Red Sox: 3   Tigers:4   This game gets a:  FUCK!    only because of the fact a loss was sort of expected.

      I seriously hate off days. Boring as hell. You could always watch the ESPN games, but they have that annoying theme song.I'd watch the Braves, but their games dont matter to me. Its all very annoying.  It leaves you with very little to do. It drives me mad! Becasue I'm writing a Red Sox blog which no one reads anyway. So that denotes i realyl have nothing to do past the Red Sox. Sigh.  So today I've surfed the net, watched TV, goen swimming, and watched my bro play little leauge. Sigh. Oh and listen to Ted Nation on WEEI. Now quickley what I would like to know is why people are still talking about the Nomar  trade. Is like they think taht he's still goign to come back. Callers on EEI are still talking abotu Nomars seemingly less than sunny disposition and him being a dugout cancer. Give up. Alright. Either way, if he is a cancer, we're cured and the cubs caught it.  Anyway beyond the Red Sox, I am left to read my Redneck jokes calender, post on one of the billion message boards I've joined and forgotten about, and then post here. Somone help me!!!!

      Sorry I didn't post last night. Ijust couldnt get my lazy ass to the computer.  Well, last night was a real Gem for Curt. 9 full innings, only allowing two. An excellent game by the sox. Even defensivley. Manny made that great catch on the wall. Nice. I thought he was hurt when he did the somersault, but then he got up and hugged Johnny, which lead me to think the fall cause him to be gay, or he was fine. The bad news was i thought they were going to lose. The linup was crazy   Roberts Cabrera Damon Ramirez Mientkiewicz Varitek Millar Mueller Youkilis   Damon? Before Manny? I think Terry need to lay off the mushrooms. If it asnt for Curt, we'd have been screwed. Minkey got a double though, Highlight, but again, if it wasnt for pitching from Curt, we'd have been done.   August 4,2004   Bronson's on the mound tonight. He's been pitching great lately. The line up is the regular one with the exception of Youk batting third and Tek batting fifth.Oh and Muller playing second. I really dont get this logic. But dam . Our second basemen are getting killed.Pokey's hurt, Bellhorn's gone. Damn. At the point im typing this it's the bottom of the 7th and the sox are up 4-1   9:13 The Rays have loaded the bases with no one out following a double play ball that was booted by youkilis. Everone was safe everywhere.   9:14 Damn it. Toby hall hit a grand slam after an 0-18. So nows its 5-4.Bronsons done. And the error hurts.   9:18  The innings over. But man does that sting. Could have ended the inning. They had Tino on 0-2 and walked him and Youk couldnt field the DP. Yikes.   9:46  Damn the tying run was cut at the plate, luckily the sox have niky at second. Damn what a good throw from baldelli.   9:48  Kapler got hit with a pitch Runner on third for Johnny.   9:50  Does that play hurt. Tino caught a pop up from Damon to end it. Damn You Svuem! Damn You!!!  Well, this game was current staff acting like fired staff. Terry played Grady, by not pulling Bronson when he should have. Sveum played Wendell Kim.By sending roberts home with no one out on a shallow line drive ith a godo arm in center. I mean thats coaching fundamentals. Dont make the first out at home. Dumbass. Sigh. I cant wait for tommorow when the order with be this...     Jason Varitek CF    Kevin Millar 3B    Mientkhoweverthehellyouspellit SS    Johnny Damon C    Orlando Cabrera LF    Kevin Youkilis RF    Dave Roberts DH    Bill Mueller 1B    Manny Ramirez 2B      Yes, folks. That's the predicted Line Up tommorow.  This game gets a   MEGA FUCK!!!!    Red Sox: 4 Devil Rays:5

      Tim wakefield got to pitch on his birthday and damn did he do it well, allowing two runs in the first and that was it. Excelent game by him. Also Mcarty hit the Homer in the first to put us on top. Honestley a great game by everyone. I'm still pissed at the Nomar trade. Noamr hit a homer yesterday. Meanwhile, Minky's soaking up the bench, and Cabbrera is hitless since the homer in his first at bat. So far this trade seems to be working out as the bum deal we thought it was.     Red Sox:6   D-Rays:2   PS. Anyone here Roger Clemens got ejected from a Little Leauge Game for pittign seed a at an umpire? lol.

      I heard on the Radio, that larry luchino asked nomar about how he was feeling. (ankle-wise) Noamr said he's fine. SO apparently he was lying about feeling bad so he could stay out of the lineup. If that s true i'm glad he was traded.  Well, i missed the first hour of the ball game,because I had to play my own (we won 6-1) but when I came home I found that Cabrerra hit a Homer in his first at bat.Welcome to the team lol.   NOMAR WATCH : Nomar as a cub has grounded intto a double play and hit a pop fly.   (3:07)  Hey nice hit by Manny. Only our second hit, but its our second run.   (3:25)  Pedro seesm to have godo stuff tonight. He's given up five hits, but only one man has scored. Great game for him so far.   (4:00)  SAc fly for millar. Jeez bad throw from Jaques Jones. Should have let hunter get it to have a chance. Oh well. works for me.   (4:25)  Timlin came on and hes worked himself into a jam. Secoind and Third and no one out. Yikes. Lucky hes geting pulled.   (4:32)  Damn it. A sac fly from Morouto the track was bound to bring in a run ,but cabrrera dropped the cut off and kicked it away. Two runs in. (4-3 twins)   (4:37)  Just when you think its going to work out. They have the tying run on first and Manny at the plate. He grounds into a double play. To end the game. Great.  They played well, but an error by the new dude cost us the game. Figures. And he kick the ball. If he still droped it and it stay on the ground where it was the man was still at third. I bet nomar would have made that play.   Nomar Watch:  Nomar went 1-4 with an RBI in his first cubs game.

      Well I'm back and the sox are winning 2-0 in the top of the thirds. I have no details because I'm lazy. My semi-angry rant about the past week will come after the game.Wake's on the mound too dont know if thats good or bad.    8:14 The sox got another two in the forth from miribelli its 6-1 ionce agian I missed how they got the first two. Sigh.   8:14 Snyder whoever he is grounded into a double play with two outs   9:20  I jsut figured out who this snyder dude is. Hes a local boy. ohhh. he got a standing ovation. He came close to a homer last time up. Base hit for him. BUt thanks to dale svuem who sent muller home on a hard hit liner to left ruined it as muller was out by a mile.   I HATE DALE SVUEM!!!!!    9:30  Alright I'm fdoen with foulk. He coms in a s a great closer and then he pitches liek this. It was 6-1 with two down base hit after base hit made it 6-4.  With the go ahead run at the plate Foulke gave a loooooong drive to center abotu a foot from going out. i would have kill foulker.  Dale Doesnt get off easy wither a nohter bone head move from him in the eigth. Bill go killed at the plate. I hat e svuem and folke is losing me.

      I cant belive they lost his one. Dispite the fact they only lead once in theseond inning. I wasn't even going ot blog this one considering I'm leaving for a vacation at like six in the morning tommorow. But I am fucking pissed. And not at Svuem. The damn bullpen. The sox wer weree up 3-2. Then were down 4-2. Manny Shot them back. BUt man did they blow it. IT got to the point where it was 6-4 With two men one for the sox. Ortiz hit it to the wall in left but it was cuaght and the inning promptley ended. But Embree gave up three. 8-5. In the bottom of the ninth with one out milar hit a two run homer. Happy day its a one run game. And if my Embree could just get a fuckign second out..we win. But no. And it figures who was next. Orlando fucking Cabrerra. Replacement of the great Nomah. So what he do. He lines to left to end it.  Two words.  PINCH FUCKIGN HITTER!   But I guess not. Considering Terry's legally retarded.  So after todays game my decision is final   Cabrerra=Stupid Douche  Minkey=God Almighty  Well Im going to the mountians to escape the two most destrucive things in Boston. Cabrreara,and Charley (future sitcom name...must remember...)  So see ya'll bitches

      Oh happy day. I was doen with my braces. They were gone the way of Pokemon. Great! As I walked out the door, he told me to stop. When I asked why he hande me a plastic reincarnation of satan himself. A retainer. A green plastic bitch. Thank god for the internet. Because if Iit wasnt for typing, I'd should like a retard. For those of you who don't know what its like to talk with a retainer, try cutting off your tonuge and then try to talk. It sucks. And, I have all this spit in my mouth and it fals off every 1/9th of a second. Also, I have to wear it 24/7. For Six weeks. School starts in four. AHHHHHHH! I'm sick of this. So from today until I learn how to talk again, I will have a sever case of laringitis.

      I think my computer is possed by the devil. Its like the Exorcist: for PC. Its evil. I was going to post some things that i had slaved over for days to make perfect here for your humor pleasure. Sigh, but it all died. Litterally. I copied my sketcehs and funny typed things onto a disc. Well, I burned it, and launched it today. I put it in the drive. The computer couldnt read it. It was liek dyslexic. it couldnt read the dammn disc.  But, i went "okay, at leasst I dont delete the recycle bin often. so i right click to open it. And when i wasnt looking, i accidentally clicked obn empty recycle bin and me being lazy, didn't read the damn thing that came up to warn me what I was doing. So i hit yes.adn now all of my funny shit is gone. DAMN YOU COMPUTER!!!!!!!  And of corse it froze just as i finished this blog entry for the first time. THIS THING SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!   DIE SATAN COPUTER! DIE!

      Everywhere I go, I see people talk about how 12 and 13 year olds are childish. Um. yeah. I am openly 12. Yes I said it. I'm 12. Every says " I act like a twelve year old kid" when they've never really met a 12 year old. Though its illegal, many adults from Alabama are actually dating 12 year olds (see  urlLink this ). We're not society's garbage.  urlLink These  are. We dont act childish (most of the time) and we can hold a decent conversation. So think twice before you bash twelve year olds. Because its not our choice. Plus every person is 12 for 1/100 of their lives. I mean thre are some adults, whom i call dozensexual, who arent twelve but act it. You'ss see them at Mcdonalds,in the stands at little leauge games, and in the Oval Office. There are many 12 and 13 year old celebrities. t=That girl form still standing for instance. There are also dozensexual celebs. For instace, John Kerry (he has the botox in his face so he can have the 12 year old look),That old dude from MTV news, and Micheal Jackson who, dispite a contrasting opinion from psyciatrists,lawyers, and doctors, thinks he is a gay 12 year old boy. So really people... Think before you discriminate .
