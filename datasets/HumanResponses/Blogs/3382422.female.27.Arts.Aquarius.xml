        Well.  I started today laying bed looking at the ceiling.  It was very odd to me because I usually spring out of bed at the butt crack of dawn with nothing to do.  Just for the sheer "springing" part of it.  The sad part is I am a total bitch for the first waking hour.  I can't seem to say or do anything nice, so I just don't talk at all.  I wonder about this because I am not wishing I were still in bed, but rather that no one will bother me with their pathetic shit in the first waking hour of the day. Should someone dare, I am sure to be a complete cunt about it.  It's just a knee-jerk reaction.  Maybe I should try coffee.  Anyway.  I just felt like laying there.   I decided to get the exercising part of my day over with.  Thought about this and that and decided to put some mileage on my bike.  When I got in the garage my front tire was flat, yet again.  The damn thing was in the bike shop and has been repaired by my husband twice.  I haven't ridden in a week because my fucking tire is always flat.  I mean the same fucking tire.  How many times am I going to have to replace the fucker?  So I did what any rational person would do.  I said fuck the exercising.  I mean I'll fix the tire myself already.  Who wants to go exercise at this much effort? Me?  After a kosher dill and a slice of cheese I figured I better eat something for real.  I went to the store and bought a pound of rainier cherries and a half pound of Angus roast beef.  It was $13.00.  I mean what the fuck is up with that.  I could eat out cheaper than that.  When did a sandwich and a piece of fruit become the price of a cheap steak dinner at Chili's?  Then I thought I could buy a brick of lard foe $0.69.  Someone shoot me and put me out of my misery.  Am I the only one who notices this type of shit?  Why are we so health conscience?  I mean have you seen these women with the thongs hanging out and the belly shirts?  Some women look damn good in that kind of thing, but let's be honest, most of the women I see wearing that I can't believe.  Do they not see the shirt rolling up because it's too small of a size or their fat is saddle bagging down the side of their pants.  Do they thing I just don't give a fuck what anyone thinks?  Could it possibly be they think they actually look good?  What is it?  I'm still having a hard time wearing shorts this summer because my calves are so cut they are like a man's.  It was 103 degrees today.  Am I overly self conscience? Probably, but shoot me down if I ever decided to wear a thong.  Even if no one knew I was wearing them I would think when I put them on in the morning "Who the fuck are you kidding? Your ass should not be wearing these.  This is for a rump shaker video or a freaky deaky night with the hubby." I don't know, but I think I need help.   So everyone says exercise, eat healthy, and then they cram a tub of Ben and Jerry's at you that costs $48.00.  I am going to go stare at the ceiling, without a thong on.

      On Monday I went over to my friend Vlad's (the name has been changed to protect the guilty) house.  Atom (also a name change), Vlad and I get together on Monday's to watch baseball and eat lunch.  This time was a little different.  I am a huge baseball nut.  I don't like to miss any of the game at all.  We were supposed to meet over at Vlad's and all make breakfast together before the game.  We planned it the previous Friday.  I told Vlad to set up the time we were all supposed to be over there and email me the time, but as usual there were "complications".  Vlad has a girlfriend Tess (name change).  She's coming around, but before she was really weird about me being over there.  I think it was a protect her man type thing.  Tess has been married 3 times and Vlad also has been married twice.  They live together in a house that they both picked out, but for some reason it is Tess's house.  I know Tess has told Vlad it is his house too, but for some reason Vlad has not partaken.  I don't understand this.  There is no sense of Vlad in the house at all.  O.k. there are a few easily removable items that belong to him.  This just baffles me.  How can you live, sleep, and breathe with a person if they have taken over (or you have given them) your whole personality?  Isn't being in a relationship about there being two separate and distinct people? I can't imagine living like that.  I mean I would feel so stifled.  Vlad however embraces this as a way to "serve" Tess.  In some sick and twisted way this is supposed to help him get laid.  I tell you there is no logic in this.  Is the power of the pie so overwhelming it would cause someone to give up their ideas?  The answer is no.  I think some men use that as an excuse.  In Vlad's case, I feel like he uses it as an escape route. If he doesn't get married and only has a few things in the house he never has to be emotionally committed.  If your not emotionally committed, why be in a relationship?  You can go fuck any girl, why bother moving in? When do you say enough?  I'm not even in his relationship and I am yelling enough from the sidelines.  It's not fair to Vlad or Tess.  Does she even know he is not all the way there?  Who knows.  Shit I am giving myself a headache with all this thinking.  Anyway, we met at the little cafe nearby and ate breakfast. We couldn't follow the plan because Vlad never talked to Atom and couldn't communicate that to me until Monday because of the "no Nina clause" on the weekend.  He doesn't want to upset Tess. So we settled on the cafe.  It was weird.  I looked up to find both of them staring at me with little grins and giggles.  When I asked what, they said it was the way I eat my potatoes.  How can you be so observant of me and not of Tess?  That's what I was thinking anyway.  Then I wondered if he can not tell the whole truth to Tess what makes me so special?  I mean he fucks her. Funny potato eater, I think not.  So we watched the game, and the Diamondbacks lost to Florida.  It was a trouncing.  Atom left to go home to his dog Muttley(dogs need protection too).  I stayed around and decided to take a dip in the pool.  Needless to say my ass is sunburned. When I am naked it looks like I am wearing a white swimsuit.  It's now Thursday and conditions have not changed much.  I was thinking on Monday maybe I'll just go by myself.  I need the rest from all this drama. Just say NO Nina.

      I can't sleep.  I am excited to go out and do different things while Michael is gone. I don't have to come home in time to cook dinner. It seems like all my deadlines are met.  I think I am going to go to a bar tonight.  I hardly drink, so I better go with one of my friends. I talked to Vlad.  He figured out he's in the shithouse with me. He offered to lie to Tess and go to the bar with me and my friend Nessa.  I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea.  Nessa will have my back though. Plus, I am still mad at him.  I miss Michael. I do like sleeping without having someone push me to the edge of my bed.  The no snoring and keeping my pillows through the night is very nice.  His cat misses him too.  She won't leave me alone.  She usually only likes me when I have a ham and cheese sandwich or chocolate ice cream. Then she begs like a dog.  It's really sad.   My mom ignored the entire 4 hour conversation we had about the renter for her condo.  She gave her the keys. What a waste of my free time. She's moving out here on the 18th.  Every time Michael leaves on business I always say I am going to do something fun and different.  I always end up cleaning, do errands, and a lot of work. I always picture myself jumping off of the sofa playing the air guitar, walking around the house naked, and eating bon-bons.  I seem to be fresh out.  I better go get some.

      Well, I just couldn't bare writing yesterday.  I was too upset. I knew it.  I have been lied to by Vlad.  My best confidant in my neighborhood.  Life stinks.  I thought he was for real.  My day started out a little rocky, but I tried to make the best of it.  I woke up and decided to watch the news in bed.  After 3 solid hours of hearing about the weather in other places I turned it off. I did mention to hear the other 3 hours of news, which was about how many people died in the cars on their way to work.  It's horrible traffic here.  I have lived all over the country and traveled to most of the states.  I think L.A. and Atlanta have nothing on the Phoenix metro area. Everyday someone dies from some asshole running him off the road because he didn't want to let him merge.  It's depressing really.  On the lighter side we talk about other cities weather because our weather is the same all summer. Hot and hotter, oh yeah and sunny.   My t.v. in bed watching session was over when my friend Ty (name change) called. He's getting married on the fourth of July,on a boat, in Newport Beach.  His bride, (let's call her Ava), is really wonderful. He was calling to discuss some plans.    After I talked for a while I decided to go to the bagel shop by myself.  It was really quite relaxing.  I read the entire Sport's page without interruption.  I had a yogurt and apple juice life was good.  I had been struggling with some issues and I talked to  Atom about some stuff.  He was very attentive and supportive.  I told him I felt like a shitheel for doubting Vlad.  I felt guilty. I felt I should be a better friend, trust and believe in Vlad.  Atom could see I was hurting.  He said nothing.  I told him I really didn't want to discuss it in detail because Vlad is his friend too.  I don't want to put him in an awkward situation.  I told him I saw stripped sheets on Vlad's spare bedroom floor,overheard Vlad on the phone saying something contrary to what Vlad told me,and I knew he was lying when another friend (Lustig) said something in conversation to me.  Lustig does not lie. He once told Michael he couldn't go bike riding because he had the runs. Now what grown man says that to another grown man? I know he wasn't lying. Someone confirmed.  It may have not been one of these two people, but I will not say.  They did not give details, and they did not do it out of spite.  They did it to help me.  I was devastated.  I only have one rule to being my friend.  NEVER lie to me. That's it.  I don't care how bad you fuck up.  We can work through it.  If you lie to me, I will find out, and it will have consequences.  In this case I feel betrayed, hurt, mad, and stupid.  I should of trusted my instincts.  Vlad made this whole thing and issue to begin with.  I said I didn't want to know.  I didn't believe he could boldface lie to me.  I hung my whole self out there, flaws and all to be a true friend to him.  I no longer know if I can confide in him.  I don't know if I can open up my life to him the way it was. The longer he acts like nothing happened the more I feel disposable.  So this was a major setback for me.  I trusted him utterly and completely.  I have a lot of friends, but I think you only get a couple of lifers.  Where are mine?

      It has been too long since I screamed one of these out. I just want to have an hour to myself.  I want to enjoy the nothingness.  I am dealing with Vlad who I think may be lying to me.  He is constantly in search of a piece of ass.  He has a live-in girlfriend.  She knows nothing about him.  He spends his life keeping it from her and sharing it with me.  I think he stays with her because of fear.  Fear of being alone.  I think she keeps him around for the same reason. If your going to life a fake life, shouldn't it be exciting?  My husband left for a business trip today.  I was so proud if myself for not asking him if he remembered qtips and nosing into his luggage to check.  I just want him to have a successful trip.  I think going away and working at a different site will help give him a break from the monotony of everyday work.  Michael will have a chance to visit with his family during this trip.  I think that is great.  The only problem with this scenario is my husband is not the most organized person, or perhaps I am overly organized.  The preparations for this trip started in full swing last night. All week long I was asking about this trip. Wondering about the flight info, rental car and directions.  Michael has told me on several occasions that I am nagging.  I see it as helpful reminders for a prosperous trip.  So I don't want to nag.  I was so proud of myself because I didn't this time.  I asked how he was getting to the airport and he was pretty much indifferent.  I thought, if he's indifferent, what the fuck am I worried about?  So I let it go.    Fast forward to about noon the next day. Michael calls all pissed off because he left his magazine and driving directions on the shuttle bus. I started to ask why he didn't buy the magazine in the airport terminal and was met with abrupt egging on type lingo.  Normal Nina would start to get shitty, but super cool Nina was asking if she could get the info to him, and calming him down.  Then I thought he actually bought the magazine at the gas station because it would be cheaper.  Hmmm...wow. Forethought.  Holy goat balls!  I need to reinforce this concept.  I said, "Don't worry, buy another magazine and we will figure the rest out."   Fast forward to 20 minutes later.  Michael calls.  He can't remember who his rental car reservation is through.  No problem, I am pulling into Vlad's garage in his girlfriend's car.  I was coming back from getting her oil changed for him so he doesn't get busted for not doing his chores while she was on vacation. Let me just get into her house, sit down at her computer, and access the info for you.  Still, I was super fucking cool Nina.  Not a PEEP.  Vlad is now sitting there contemplating the swing of his relationship, and I need to listen.  To his credit he always listens to my bullshit.  I wonder though how honest he is with himself, but that's a whole other chapter in this saga. Vlad drove me home the block and a half to my house.  My shoes would of melted to the pavement if I tried to walk.  It was like 112 degrees today.  After checking the mail I attempted to pee uninterrupted.  Big Mistake.  I spent the next 3 hours on the phone with my mother and her girlfriend explaining what I would do if I were in their situation.  You see my mother wants to move to Arizona from Indiana.  I'm fine with that.  The problem is selling her condo.  She hired some jackass realtor to help her.  He did nothing and when the contract expired she was supposed to go different one (friend of her alternative family).  Instead she decided she would do for sale by owner.  Well she didn't even do that.  I told her at least get a lawyer to look over any contracts, but what do I know.  I just closed on my first house in February.  Blah, blah, blah....diarrhea of the mouth...blah. So there is a mentally unstable, social security collecting, lesbian attempting to rent to own my mother's condo.  The only problem is she's balked on the payment and contract arrangements four times now.  My mom wants to know what I would do in that situation.  The answer; I would never be in that situation.  I would of called the fucking realtor.  Fast forward.  Yogurt and peanuts for dinner. No time to cook realtor friend of mine stopped by.  She wants to know what's going on with my friends who purchased a house from her.  They are backing out for the 4th time.  Look stage left, the telephone rings.  Why it's my friends who are buying the house from her.  I am not picking up.  Can't take it.  Me wants to kills them. To kills everybody.  Fast Forward. Michael calls  he had to charged the fully paid for and reimbursable rental car. $362.36. Super cool Nina, be super cool.  Supportive is the word of the day.  Forward.  Michael calls.  He's approaching Fort Wayne. His laptop isn't working right.  He has no driving directions.  Super Cool to the rescue.  I am getting on Mapquest as we speak. No big deal.  Super cool, be cool.  Mapquest isn't working the way it should. O.k. try again.  Michael is growing impatient.  Michael has done it millions of times.  I am fucking it up.  I can't see the words plainly in front of my face.  He's right about the website while he's driving in a rental car, in the dark, with no directions.  Losing cool now.  Not because directions lost, because indignation of Michael over the website. Oh. His cell phone went dead.  Future Fast Forward: Me under a rock, my rock, by myself.  If you need advice on homes, rental cars,cell phones,love, lesbianism,packing for a trip,knowing what voids a contract,skimpy dinner cuisine,the life of oil, or directions to my rock, go fuck yourself. I don't want to be super cool.

      Well, I must say it looks like everything has come full circle.  Michael is on his way home from his business trip, my mom is moving in down the street,Vlad and I made up,Nessa has moved on to a new victim, and the crazy Mormon friends of mine finally cancelled out on their house. I wish I could've changed the outcome of some of these, but what can a girl do?  Michael's trip sounds like it was successful.  He met his uncle.  He didn't even know he had one, let alone two.  His father lied to him his whole life.  He told Michael and his siblings that he was an only child.  Can you believe that?  Michael met him at the new site he was trying to implement. Frank is head of security at the site.  How ironic. Michael also got to visit with his sister,mom, and grandmother.  He seemed to really enjoy himself. I, myself, do not have very much in the way of family.  I am glad that he got to reconnect with them.  It's only us out here in sunny Arizona. We are taking on the world together.  I really enjoyed my time away from Michael.  I felt the burden of responsibility lifted.  I realized that part of the expectations that are required of me, I put in place. I think I am going to lower those for the mean time. I think it will make me happier and less worried.  Atom's birthday was on Saturday. We were going to meet for lunch to celebrate.  Vlad and I had to talk.  We live in BFE, so we rode together.  It was really hard.  We started to talk and it just felt sad.  After persuasion from Nessa and Michael I traded in my zero tolerance for lying policy (just this once).  I had become too close to Vlad.  I needed to make it clear though that this was a one time grace given to him.  He made it clear that he felt horrible and upset.  All is good though, we are back to talking about  baseball, farting, and the best way to cool your balls off in the summer. Isn't that beautiful?  I went out with Nessa on Friday night.  She goes to the same dive bar about three nights a week.  It's a pretty nice environment, except it's super smoky.  I knocked a few back while listening about Nessa's latest guy she's trying to land.  He came in and it was like nothing else existed.  I spent most of the night talking with Brian.  It was o.k. At least it was a change in the routine.  I found out for sure that the crazy Mormons cancelled their house.  I haven't called them though because I don't want to deal with it.  They have no support system.  Their religion places a huge emphasis on family and helping others.  The parents of the guy are leading them in the wrong direction.  They threw away $30,000 in equity.  The house wasn't even finished all the way and it already had that much on it.  Their family members were calling them telling them not to get the house because they wouldn't be able to afford to travel to visit them.  How lame is that?  Anyway,  I just feel like a broken record with them.  Someone has to help them break the cycle though right?  I bought Michael a present while he was gone.  He likes to play video games.  At first I thought it was just a juvenile habit.  I have changed my mind.  I think he plays them for stress relief.  Some people exercise,play guitar,cook, but Michael plays video games.  He really enjoys it.  I bought him the game "Manhunt".  He said he wanted it a while ago, but those games are $50 a wack.  No wonder I still have Dr. Mario.  It costs too much.  I guess it could be worse though.  He could like something like golf.  That's an expensive sport.  That's what most people our age are doing.  Not us though.  Anyway.... all seems to be right.  We'll see what happens tomorrow. Hope the shit doesn't hit the fan.

      Well.   I don't know what in the crap I'm supposed to do now.  My back is killing me today.  My half sister called me last night and told me my step uncle had passed away.  Their family lives here in the Phoenix metro area. My step mom flew out last night to comfort her sister.  My dad and half sister are driving out today from Albuquerque.  It's about an eight hour drive.  My Dad has visited me twice since I have lived in AZ. I grew up with out him. It was mostly my mother fault as to my lack of seeing him, but that's neither here nor there. I have lived in AZ for a total of five years.  The whole family never comes to visit me.  Just him.  He was supposed to come out at the end of July.  I just brought my first house with my husband, so it's quit a big deal.  Well since my step uncle died, whom everyone pretty much despised, I think they are trying to squeeze me in.  This seems wrong to me.  I me the time before last the squeezed me in because they were picking my step sister up from rehab.  They of course didn't even bother to tell me she had a problem with meth until she was half way through it. I don't want to be squeezed in.  I deserve more and so does my poor step uncle.  Is this so wrong?  I asked Michael to help me clean up a bit and we got into a horrible argument.  I'm in too much pain to do it all myself.  I just feel like since my dad and his family never gave me anything, I need to show them that I can provide for myself.  I mean I want to be a part of my dad's life, but I don't think that it is really going to happen.  That makes me sad because he really is a great guy.  I don't want to fight with Michael.  He's at a party we were invited to. He wanted me to stay here.  Lustig is going to give me shit about this though. I wonder if Vlad and Tess went.  What the crap is a girl to do?

      Here I go again.    This week has been interesting.  I still have too much drama going on with Vlad. I think I might have found a place to meet like-minded friends on the web (which is very strange for me). I was very social with neighbors I thought hated me and Michael. Last, I saw Fahrenheit 9/11.  One at a time.....and away we go.....   Vlad Situation   Vlad and I continued to talk about how our relationship would be affected based on Tess's declaration about Michael.  He seemed to think everything would be fine.  He decided it would be.  The next day Tess got rear-ended  by a F350.  That halted all peace talks, as it should. The following day we had to meet in secret at our breakfast spot.  We only got to visit for about an hour. During that hour both of us received several phone calls and text messages.  Later that day we met for frozen yogurt to visit.  He drove out of his way to meet me.  It still wasn't the same.  He has be contemplating leaving Tess. I don't want to be the cause of that.  I don't think I am though.  He tried talking to her about changing things up a little and expressing himself better. She seemed to only see black and white.  I think if you approach your partner with a problem or concern both people should work together to resolve this issue.  She was just indifferent.  She didn't seem to want to budge on her issues, but just gave up.  She decided Vlad is going to do what he is going to do.  So it's o.k. to leave her, but she's not going to change any to make him stay.  Isn't that messed up?  It seems like someone's got to be worth fighting for,  If she won't fight for a person she's shared her life with for two years, who will she fight for?  Will she even fight for herself.   Things have changed with Vlad.  We aren't talking like normal.  He's not happy.  I can't see him or talk to him when I want.  It's all fucked up.  I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt either Tess, Vlad, or whatever it is they call a relationship.  Boo Hoo, Vlad. I'm sorry life sucks.  I miss you.   New People Situation   Michael found a great website for me.  I have been posting regularly. I feel refreshed.  There are smart, funny, interesting women out there.  Yay, I might be able to have some more girlfriends!!! Now everyone won't think I'm doing all my man friends.  I have only been a member for a week.  I will continue to test the waters.  If it is safe I will share more details later.   Neighbors? Social? Who me?   Today Michael played hookie from work.  We went to breakfast and while we were there bumped into one of our neighbors.  Cali (name change) is actually one of Tess's neighbors.  He has a girlfriend that also lives in the neighborhood, Bell (NC).  I was pretty sure they disliked Michael and me.  This was carefully based on time we spent with them and the fact that Tess doesn't care for us.  We ended up spending all day together. Cali, Michael, Lustig and I all went to see Fahrenheit 9/11. We met Bell, Lustig's wife, and two of Bell's coworkers at a Japanese Sports Bar.  We had a great time.   Fahrenheit 9/11    I went to this movie open minded.  I read earlier in the paper that is was a Bush bashing.  In all honesty I can say it was a great movie.  It was tastefully done.  I learned a few things, cried twice and laughed once.  It was the first movie I have been to in a long time where people were actually clapping several times throughout the movie.  Good Job Michael Moore.  This week was pretty interesting.  Let's see what tomorrow brings.

      Well it was another interesting day.  I am so sick of all the drama around here. I have never seen so much drama around forty year old men.  I'm better off hanging with a bunch of high schoolers.  The latest saga: Tess had a party that was related to work.  Things didn't turn out that way though. Vlad just went with the flow. He didn't invite me, Lustig, or Atom, which wasn't a big deal because it was kind of a corporate party.  After several hours of drinking, Lustig and I determined that several non-corporate people were invited.  Hence, the point, we were intentionally uninvited.  This blows.  Michael rode his bike drunk to scout out the party.  He delivered a bottle of wine as a good gesture.  He gathered information and reported to headquarters.  Unfortunately Lustig and I were more impressed with Michael's ability to ride a bicycle while intoxicated. No big deal, or so I thought.  This morning: Vlad calls me and needs to discuss something with me.  He calls at the ass crack of dawn usually.  It was already nine, so I knew there was going to be trouble.  Basically he says Michael is weird, and Tess feels "uncomfortable" around him. Translation: Tess is set in who her friends are and you and Michael are not going to be two of them.  Well I say horse shit.  He is going to stand there and let one person dictate four people's relationships with one another.  Not on my time.  I am way too close to Vlad, to let someone else but into our friendship.  This afternoon: We had a talk. Were cool.  It wasn't fun though.  I am disappointed that Michael is finally trying to create a social circle and this bump has come along.  I am sad that Vlad gets mowed over by Tess. I am confused that Vlad lives a totally different life away from me, Michael, Lustig, and Atom.  It's like a double agent type of life.  I don't quite understand though why it's necessary. It was a disturbing and upsetting conversation.  We fixed it though.  I stuck to my guns too.  Yay me.  This evening: Michael and I went to the town hall of a nearby town to oppose the incorporation effort in our city.  I'm not really against incorporation, but I don't think we are ready for it yet.  We just wanted to go on record as saying there aren't enough registered voters in our area yet(since we're so new and in a different county) to represent a good dichotomy.  It wasn't necessary though as the incorporators were removed from the agenda.  I made two fat ass rib eyes and a pile a broccoli.  We watched the D-backs game.  Half way through I decided to add some things to my blog. D-backs are sucking.  I can't help feeling disappointed in adulthood.  Not because of the working or responsibility part, rather the lack of buddies.  Did I mention there is a little too much drama in this for me too. Holy crap I'm losing my mind with all this bs.  Help!  Normal people I know you're out there!!  P.S. Lustig kept trying to pee in the coat closet because he thought it was the bathroom. Boys and girls, say no to vodka.

      Wow.  I was just getting ready to check on an ebay item I wanted to bid on.  Michael, as usual left his computer shit up all night.  It just so happens he left his blog up.  I read his last entry.  I didn't like it one bit.  I think it is based in dementia.  I personally think women sell themselves short in a lot of aspects.  Some women can be needy, manipulative, and greedy.  One thing is for sure I feel sorry for those women.  I personally feel no need to "secure" anything from a man.  I feel complete as myself.  I don't need a man to feel beautiful, happy, intelligent or anything else for that matter.  I know my worth and didn't have to have some man tell me what it is.  I think as a whole women have done this justifying themselves to men far too long.  Unfortunately there are women out there who do these kinds of things.  It only makes it harder for us women who aren't that way to convince men of this.  Why do we need to convince them?  Well men have most of the power and were given so by us dopes.  Men have most of the high paying jobs, most of the fringe benefits, most of the acceptability of bad behavior, most of everything at their fingertips.  Men are born into a role of respect.  As for us women we have to earn the respect of men and even other women.  Why is this?  Why did our predecessors sell us short?  I for one can't stand for this any longer and won't.  As for sluts.  They are people who are incomplete and trying to find a way to fit in the acceptability ring of society.  I don't think it ever occurs to someone in this mind set that you have to love and accept yourself first.  I think women who degrade themselves for no gain are searching for some sort of fulfillment in their lives.  They are reaching out for an answer or purpose.  It's a shame that men swoop in there to take advantage of someone in such a desperate state of mind.  What else was going to happen though?  Society has determined that's an o.k. behavior for men.  So all you women out there that are feeling worthless and down, look inside yourself.  Find love, beauty, strength, and power inside yourself.  Quit looking for a man to give you that.  That's how we ended up in this fucked up situation to begin with.  You need no one to conquer the world.  As for you people who just enjoy sex, make sure your getting something out of it, whether it be an orgasm, the union of two into one, or revenge.  If you choose to be with a man for love make it true.  Find compromise on both ends, never forget who you are.  Each person is in control of their own strength and power.  Man or woman, never let anyone take that away from you.  So I don't know who the fuck you are, but I know you are someone in your own rite.

      As you know I haven't written in a while.  The big holiday weekend snuck up on me.  Michael and I went to Newport Beach, California for the weekend.  I wish I could say it was for pleasure, but I can't.  We had some friends from the Air Force that were tying the knot.  As usual our travel plans got all f***ed up.  We missed our first flight to Santa Ana due to no available parking at Sky Harbor Airport.  Here in Phoenix, the third ring of hell, they under estimated the amount of people fleeing the heat over the weekend. We were booked on a flight only three hours later.  When we arrived Michael called the car rental place to arrange for the shuttle. They assured us they were on their way.   Four phone calls, and an hour and a half later we hopped into a cab. It was one of the worse travel experiences in my life so far.  What's next?  We arrived at the hotel.  I reserved rooms at Days Inn in Santa Ana.  I would have been better off at a Motel 6 or Super 8.  It was the most disgusting room I had ever seen. Days Inn owners, Be Ashamed!!! The phone was ripped to of the wall, the sink would not drain, the bathroom flooded because of a crazy shower head, the toilet ran, and there were stains all over.  Yuck.  I just started laughing at this point.  We went to a BBQ arranged for the out of towners only. It was located 45 miles from the designated city of the wedding.  The  bride's family was incredibly nice.  Seeing the to of our friends so happy to see us kind of made up for the shitty day.  Their wedding was on a yacht at duck on the 4th of July.  It was very beautiful.  Michael and I has an especially nice time on the boat.  They are going to Jamaica on their honeymoon.  I was robbed I tell you.  I went on a tri-state tour of Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky on my honeymoon.  I thought I was lucky to get to go to Cincy.  We got a short visit in with them before we left on Monday.  We went to the beach.  We both got sunburned.  Funny.  We have lived in Phoenix 3 years and rarely get sunburned.  We were at the beach less then an hour.  Anyway.  There is more drama, but I rather not relive it.  I need a vacation.

      Wow. My best friend from high school came to visit me this weekend. She had planned to go to Las Vegas with one of her coworkers for a couple of days and then travel down to Arizona to visit me. I was a little nervous about the visit, but things turned out fine.  I have a lot of friends, but I have a hard time establishing really good friends. When I was younger we moved a lot so I didn't really get to keep in touch. Since I have left home and gotten married my husband went into the military. I made good friends but not only did I move, they did too. My friend that came to visit is very unpredictable.  When we were younger she had this huge competition thing with me. I never felt that way at all toward women in general. I feel that way when I play sports. I have never really understood that feeling. Anyway we hated and loved each other during this time. Her parents deprived her of a lot of love, but gave her everything else. My mom was an alcoholic, but was an excellent communicator (feeler).  There have been several times in my life when I have felt I no longer have anything in common with her. I felt like what's the point of continuing this friendship? I have been friends with her for almost 15 years.  I had a really nice visit with her. She seems to have grown a lot. It got me thinking about other people in high school though.  Nathan if your out there I miss you.

      My cricket is dead!  Vlad came and took care of my house.  That damn cricket's friends better not come over to lament his untimely death.  I will have to shower them with sweet toxic death.

      Here in Arizona the monsoon is upon us. It hasn't even really rained here. Actually we are in desperate need of rain. Like all living things we need water to live. Unfortunately there is a mysterious cricket chirping in my bathroom.     I feel bad about inhabiting a space that once belonged to the cricket, but not that bad. I am fine if it stays in it's habitat, but trying to co-exist with a cricket, I don't think so.     I was minding my own business playing a game of Tetris when this incessant chirping began. It wasn't a regular cricket. It was loud, like a mother-in-law cricket. It just wouldn't shut up. I know it was probably looking for water, but I wished it would look someplace else. I called Michael into the room. It continued to chirp, except when the light came on. It was echoing throughout the bedroom and master bathroom. As soon as he would turn on the light. It would stop chirping. It was like a freaking Abbott and Costello routine.     Vlad has his own pest control business. Finally we decided to call him. I found out that crickets can climb. I didn't know this. Maybe the cricket was up high. Maybe he was hanging out on our plant shelf laughing at us everytime we turned on the light to find him. He'll probably go into a cricket bar and crack jokes about the two dumbass humans he played.     We filled the drains in the sink like Vlad suggested. He made fun of me. I'm not afraid but after hanging out with someone in the pest control business you learn things. Things you don't want to know. For example humans ingest several bugs per year in their sleep. EWWWW! Also most children's ear aches are caused by bugs (mainly cockroaches) crawling into their ears and then dying. Double ewww and a yuck for good measure.     I want bugs to complete the cycle of survival of the fittest, but not in my bedroom. I can't find the mysterious little fucker. Michael seems to think it is in the actual door frame. I'm sure he looked thoroughly. I hope I can sleep tonight, otherwise all be back here writing about the fucking cricket that kept me up all night. If I do, you can bet the mysterious cricket will be a dead mofo cricket.

      Well. It has been a while since I posted. I haven't really had time to even check my email. Michael started school again and occupies the computer most of the time. I finally got a chance to finish a couple of drafts that I had previously started. During this time I had an opportunity to read Michael's blog. I don't want to taint the purity of his personal thoughts, but I feel I must respond to some of the creative license he has taken  pertaining to me.  First, I almost never read Michael's blog. Most of the time I read it, it's because he has started watching a movie and has left it open along with several other applications on the computer. I also have permission to read his blog, but prefer not to. He stated in one of his posts that I "bellowed" from the computer room for help with the computer. This isn't correct. I simply was asking if I could close all the windows he left open so I could check my email.  Second, I never said I had a problem with porn. What I said was I don't like Michael looking at real live people on the internet. It's like watching your neighbors fuck. It think it's very invasive and I don't like it. I don't particularly care for porn, but I think it has its uses. If he wants to view porn stars I guess I don't have a problem with that. I did give him a subscription to playboy for three years. I prefer 2 dimensional images over 3, but I never forbade it.  Third, I want him to have a creative outlet, but I don't want the view he presents that pertains to me to be totally based in creative writing. I'm all for putting your own spin on a situation, but some of what he says about me I want to be based in truth. It's kind of like that saying there are three sided to every story.  Fourth, I have sex when I want to have sex. Sometimes I'm just horny and others are to pacify my husband. Any length of time that goes by with out sex is due to one thing. Poor communication. If two people are taking care of each others needs everything falls in place. I think we have a great sex life. I think problems arise when I am not meeting his physical needs and he is not meeting my emotional needs. Six and a half years later we're still here. We must be doing something right.  My point is I don't want to taint the purity of his blog. I can't let the other side of his story not be told though. I was there too. I don't want my blog restricted either. So I'll say that and be done with it.
