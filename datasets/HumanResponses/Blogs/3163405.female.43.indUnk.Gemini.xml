       Highway 37 Big Truck Blues  After 4 days of keeping 20 eight & nine year olds from killing themselves or each other in the wilds of Marin County, they all nearly perished today on Highway 37 when a super long truck lost control and toppled over crushing a 4 by 4 and disabling our bus full of sunburnt, happy kids watching "Piglet avoids the death penalty" yet again on video.  Miraculously, the children and the truck driver are safe and sound.  Even the driver of the 4X4 is alive and not in critical condition according to a woman wearing butterfly glasses, thick makeup and a sequined bodice sent out by the bus company's insurance carrier (the woman, not the bodice).  As I return, Bill reports that Karl Rove has, apparently successfully, got Kerry on the defensive by going for the jugular--what's unimpeachable about Kerry is his war record--attack the war record.  You see, you not only sell by the weakest attribute, you attack the opponent's strongest attribute.  It's brilliant and insidious and shouldn't win, unless Kerry takes the bait--which he seems to be.   Louis Armstrong ain't got nothin' on this scat...  More tomorrow after sleep and no morning filled with camp songs.  Although I did like this one:  It starts with an "S" And it ends with a "T"  It comes out of you And it comes out of me.  I know what you're thinking, but don't call it that.  Be scientific, and call it "scat"  It was a piece of scat! Piece. of.  scat.

       We Consensed!  No.  "Consensed" is not a word.  And yet we did it.  At 16:30 hours today, Southside Park Cohousing Association congratulated itself on a record-breaking achievement of concensus to spend $1800.  We are the only government I'm dealing with that is operating in the black, so we can spend, spend, spend!  Victory is mine.   Into the wilderness  Curiously, having just reeled you into my clutches only a week ago.  I am to let you go.  Tomorrow, I journey to a remote portion of the world, where no cell phone or computer line can reach.  I will be unavailable, unassailable, unattainable.    I'm speaking of course of Marin County.  I'll be at Marin Headlands Institute on a field trip with my son's class for the week.  It's very hot in Sacto right now, so good to head out.  To make it worth your while, I'll let you chew on these thoughts that I'm mulling over.  I'm interested in your reactions, thoughts.   Ask for More, not Less  The central problem in American politics and maybe in American life is not thinking big enough and not asking enough of each other.  In an era of rapidly declining civic and community participation, combined with an extraordinary degree of corporate control over our political system, the solution of the past 20 years has been to shrink expectations.    We can't have real comprehensive universal health insurance, so we’ll ask that children of working poor be partially covered.  We don’t have stay-at-home mothers to staff our PTA so we ask parents to write checks instead of participate in the classroom.  We don’t have enough people in the neighborhood for a full-fledged neighborhood watch, so we have an email list instead.  This trend of diminishing expectations feeds on itself.  As we ask for less, we receive and perceive less and we ratchet it down another notch.  The identified phenomenon of “Bowling Alone” becomes inevitable.   Permanent.  We come to expect only what we can out of ourselves and our internet connection.  Yet, what has been the central lesson and trend of successful education of our children: expect more get more.  The Jaime Escalantes of this world get our children to stand and deliver when they tell them, not only can you do algebra, but you can do calculus.  Try this.  Work on that.  Do it again.  Suddenly those children are not only doing calculus, but loving calculus, loving school, loving life.  They are more confident, more energetic, and most of all more hopeful for the future.  They are engaged.  But who is applying this known universal principle of education and life to adults, to citizens, to the members of their own community?   Answer: where it is applied, it is successful, but it is applied less and less.  Nowhere is this clearer to me than in the political context.   Despite the overwhelming advantage of money in politics, the promise of genuine grassroots activism swamping big money Astroturf still exists and still happens.  In California, where term limits creates a large number of open seats in the legislature to fill every two years, we recently saw Lori Saldena beat two infinitely better-funded insider opponents in a heavily contested Democratic primary to fill a state assembly seat from San Diego, running only on the strength of her grassroots support.   Why does this continue to happen in a world where the conventional wisdom has it otherwise?  The reason is that when real voters are given hope and believe that an election or an issue really matters, they find the time to make the calls, walk the precincts, get out the vote.  They are energized, excited and motivated by the feeling of making a difference.  But you can’t excite, motivate and energize people to work for things that don’t matter.  Ten years ago when Proposition 186 was on the California ballot, people took leaves of absence, cuts in pay, moved to the state, changed their lives to gather signatures, raise money and work hard for even the remote possibility of enacting a single payer health care system in the nation’s richest most populous state.  The initiative tanked.  Still, the bumper stickers, friendships, and memories of a good fight remain over ten years later.  Contrast that to a failed fight to stop the recently passed Medicare Prescription Drug bill in Congress.  The die was cast when Washington insiders set their sites on such a low goal to begin with, passing an extension of Medicare prescription drug coverage that the drug companies could live with.  The decision was made:  we can’t unlock the deathgrip the pharmaceutical industry has on Congress, so we’ll come to the table and negotiate (from a position of weakness in a Republican Congress) and we’ll see what comes out.    What came out was a multibillion dollar boondoggle for the drug companies—new taxpayer money for new drugs and give up the right to bargain for the best prices.  Oops!  This won’t do, says Ted Kennedy now, after eagerly agreeing to the talks, everyone stop everything and fight this.  Too late.  It passes in the face of a confused public.   How can you muster a grassroots fight to stop something that might or might not be good for you or bad for you?  We asked for too little and were trounced.  A savvy reader might point out at this juncture, but Sara, you’re trounced either way:  You push for single payer health care and you’re rolled.  You push for a modest extension of coverage of prescription drugs and you’re rolled.  What’s the difference?  The difference is that in the first instance you’re back where you started but with a full-fledged joyful fight under your belt and in the second instance you’ve actually lost ground with a massive diversion and possibly undermining of the most successful health program we have: Medicare.  Those of us who care about universal health care, affordable housing, creating jobs that pay a real living wage, top-notch schools, clean air and clean water, need to start playing to win.  We need to look at what needs to be done, see what needs to be changed to get there and make a plan to do it.  This is true whether it’s a 10, 20, 30 or 50 year plan.  Those years are going to come whether we plan them or not.  When we sit down and we look at how do we get from here to there, we can easily get overwhelmed, but we mustn’t be.  We need to take it seriously and break it down into manageable chunks.  Not of low expectations, but of real winable fights that matter.

       24-Hour Consensus  After months of trying, the call came.  "I can have a construction crew outside your door at 9:00am Monday morning.  All I need is the go-ahead and $1800 cash.  Is it a go?"    A go?  A go?!  I think.  My God, it's got to be a go.  I've spent months, months!, trying to find a contractor, real or fake, it didn't matter.   And now, a good one.  One I trust.  Ready to go.  It's got to be a go.  But is it?    All that stands between this go and me is 24 hours and a consensus.  The consensus of 24 households.  Consensus cannot be rushed.  Consensus cannot be urged.  Consensus must be *found* (the italics feature on this web service looks awful, sorry).  You see, I live in cohousing.  Southside Park Cohousing at the corner of 5th and T in downtown Sacramento.  An intentional community of 24 households, well 25 really, but one doesn't count.  The community operates by consensus.  Yes.  Don't play coy with me.  You know what that means.  You tried it once in your women's co-op, your recycling club or your group house.  It's everyone agrees.  No majority rule.  Every person has veto power.  It sucks.  Big time.  "Yes!" I say, brightly.  "It's a go.  Of course, it's a go.  We'll see you Monday."  In a flash I'm off that line and onto another one.  How will I pull this off?  I've just got to.  I've been trying for over a year to develop a consensus around paving my neighbor's pathway behind her house.    She's disabled and rides a hand-operated bike or walks with crutches.   It's really tricky for her to negotiate the uneven dirt path.  I can't watch her go through this another week if we could do it now.  So it's off to the races.  I call two key households right away.  The ones that everyone calls to see what they think if there's a problem (well, I'm one of those too, but I'm in).  They're in.  Next I work the perennial naysayers.  I've got to get every single one of them neutralized or it's curtains.  It's going well.  I cross off household after household on my list.  After living with these people for years, you know things.  For example, you can't always let one member of the household speak for the other.  You can get the husband, assuming he brings the wife along.  And bob's your uncle, there's the wife showing up at the meeting threatening to blow the whole thing up.  Oops, I realize!  Even though we have the serendipity of a community meeting the next day where the decision can be legally made and even though I've gotten it onto the agenda in the last minute, there might not be a quorum!  I could get everyone ready.  Everyone on board.  And the thing fails for lack of a quorum.  Every lawyer's worst nightmare--win on the merits, fail on procedure.  A rooky mistake.  So, I call them back.  If they're not going to be there, I need a written proxy stating they're for the expenditure *and* (this is key) they're for consensus without a quorum.    Now technically it's dicey;  if you don't have a quorum, you can't have consensus.  And if you don't have consensus, how to you consent to waive the quorum?   No matter.  I proceed at high speed. I corner them at the Earth Day festival, when they're relaxing on the lawn.  I corner them on their way to catch a plane to Europe.  I consider visiting one household member in the hospital, to get her to sign a proxy--something akin to wheeling in Strom Thurmond to break a filibuster.  "You should be a lobbyist," one of the neighbors quips.  "No.  She should teach a *class* on lobbying," another counters.  The two of them fall over with laughter at my expense.    Okay, I think.  Let them have their laugh. Sure, I'm a trained lawyer and lobbyist.  I've broken real filibusters in the U.S. Senate.  But I have nothing now.  I raise my kids.  I teach my little lobbying class.   Developing this consensus is likely to be my biggest personal political triumph of the year.  I.  Must.  Prevail.  But will I?  Tune in tomorrow night...

       What is a blog, exactly?  That's roughly the level of on-line savvy of my average reader.  The answer:  no earthly idea.  It's short for "web-log," but you know knew that, right?  It's an on-line journal.  My God, man, isn't it obvious?!  I won't respond to anymore of these inquiries!   Snichols Announces Snout-based Movie-rating System--first movie, Dogville  Although Snichols, the author of "Snicholsblog," renounced her love of pigs over a decade ago with a party on Capitol Hill, a haunting reminder remains (mostly in a box in her closet marked "pigs" which may cause some faithful readers to hum "pigs in the attic, there's no denying.  pigs in the attic, there's bacon frying.  they are blue.  you are pink.  they leave no hairs in the bathroom sink...")  Yes, despite, or perhaps because of, this long dead porcine obsession designed primarily for people to have something to give you on Christmas (or Hanukah--when winter comes, look for my "Shiksa Hanukah" series), I find that the only way that I can convey my rating system for movies is not stars, nor thumbs nor animated popcorn, but rather snouts (up to be precise)--(:)   To give you a sense of my system and sensibilities (the new Jane Austin):  Level (:) = "Bill and Coo," the all-parrot western Level (:) (:) = "Clan of the Cave Bear" with Darryl Hannah--grunt if you want me Level (:) (:) (:) = "Kramer vs. Kramer" good acting, good script, okay, what's next? Level (:) (:) (:) (:) = "The Big Easy" 'You ain't from around hea, ah you sha?' Level (:) (:) (:) (:) (:) = "Moulin Rouge" this movie was  made  for me! Play it again!    3 Snouts Up for Dogville -- "Our Town" Gone to Hell  I rode my bike to the Tower Theater (Save the Tower!) and saw the movie Dogville.  I'm too tired to do it justice now, but I think you should see it.  It's like Thorton Wilder's "Our Town" gone to Kafka hell before your eyes.   I'm certain I've never seen a movie like it before--shot entirely on a sketchy crime scene of a set.  It's not as hard to watch as I'm implying, but requires more of the patience of a Eugene O'Neill experience, with all the philosophy, but without the glorious dialogue--very memorable though and completely unique.  The only reason I'd deny it the 4th snout up is that I didn't think it was that well-written or acted, but it was certainly well-conceived and extremely riveting.   The straight poop on cubscouts  Let's set the record entirely straight:  the game I played with my son's cub scout troop is called "the movie game."    Invented by me and a group of twisted theatre kids in 1979 over a couple of bottles of Boones Farm Strawberry Hill (oh God, was I sick), the game went on to achieve its 15 minutes in Lisa Birnbach's College Handbook description of Reed College's favorite drinking game.   Decades later, I morphed it back into a kids game, minus the drinking and the obscenity.  I'll describe how to play it another time.  Sara

       Where there's a Who, there's a Horton!  Hey, remember that public financing bill I told you about?  Horton, Levine, Longville and a last minute addition of Gene Mullin from San Mateo, voted for it in the Elections Committee Wednesday--it passed without a vote to spare!  Bill Magavern, Sierra Club, husband, father of my children, was one of the many Who's who chorused loud enough for Horton to hear them and vote the right way.  Now it's on to the Assembly Appropriations Committee, aka Graveyard.   My Bill & his Sierra Club  Well, while I was trying to get semi-catatonic cub scouts to play the tame version of a game my college friends used to know as "fuck me fuck me" (oh boy, this sounds really bad...), my Bill & his Sierra Club were rockin' and rollin' today even more than usual.  The Sierra Club board successfully fended off its hostile anti-immigrant takeover and Bill bashed hummers in the New York Times.  I can't find the link, so this AP cut & paste will have to do.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  April 22, 2004 Schwarzenegger Has Yet to Retrofit Hummer By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   Filed at 6:06 a.m. ET  LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Labeled an environmentalist-come-lately as a candidate, Arnold Schwarzenegger answered his critics by announcing plans to retrofit one of his gas-swilling Hummers to run on eco-friendly hydrogen power.  ``I think that's where the future of fuel will be going,'' he said at the time.  But seven months later, the high-tech Hummer has yet to hit the road. For the moment, the project has produced more talk than torque.  Seven companies submitted bids to do the work -- ranging in cost from $40,000 to $150,000 -- but no contract has been signed, said Rick Margolin, assistant director of Energy Independence Now, a Santa Monica group that evaluated the proposals on behalf of the governor.  ``He does have people working on it,'' Margolin said.  Schwarzenegger, who has owned as many as six of the enormous SUVs at one time, raised his proposal for a clean-fuel vehicle with officials in the Hummer division of General Motors Corp. But for now the company is not engineering a hydrogen-fueled Hummer for him or anyone else.  ``It's out there as an idea,'' said David Caldwell, a spokesman for Hummer. ``It's not something that exists currently. It's not something you would expect to see in the near future.''  He added, ``We would never do a Hummer on any energy source that would not perform like a Hummer is supposed to perform.''  Schwarzenegger took delivery of the first Hummer made available to the public more than a decade ago, a civilian version of a military vehicle that caught the public's attention during the Gulf War.  His popularity in Hollywood helped transform the brand into a favorite status vehicle. He was forced to defend his association with the hulking, low-mileage Hummer during the campaign when rivals questioned his environmental credentials considering his choice of transportation.  General Motors markets and distributes the latest version of the vehicle, the 6,400-pound H2, and estimates it gets 10 to 13 miles per gallon. Dealers put the figure at 8 to 10 mpg.  The issue hasn't vanished. Activists planned a Thursday news conference in Sacramento to urge the governor to stop driving his signature vehicle, citing its impact on air quality.  Sierra Club lobbyist Bill Magavern said the gas-greedy Hummer ``wreaks havoc to our environment'' but viewed the governor's promise to retrofit his sport utility vehicle as ``largely irrelevant.''  ``The Hummer is the opposite kind of vehicle from what we would like to see on California streets,'' he said. ``What's more important to us is whether he keeps his promise to reduce California air pollution by 50 percent. ... We have yet to see his strategy.''  There was no mention of his Hummer on Tuesday, when Schwarzenegger directed state agencies to work with private companies and research groups to develop a statewide network of stations offering hydrogen fuel within six years: ``Your government will lead by example,'' he said in announcing the initiative.  With the governor working on the alternative-fueling plan, the retrofitted Hummer was ``pushed down on the priority list,'' Margolin said.

       Blog Me Flog Me Make Me Write Bad Checks  Hey, thanks for signing up to receive my blog on a regular basis.  Quite a vote of confidence, given how uniformly boring and tame my first few entries have been.  Complaints have been issued from some quarters who are more used to my incendiary, obscene, Pigbitch S. Thompson style of journalism and less used to my informative, sincere, public-has-a-right to know mode.  How to reconcile them?  No fucking idea...   National Thought for the Day:  Better Marketing for the Good Guys  You're going to have to get used to this now if you're going to be one of my readers--I have rants.  One of my rants is what I call "Jif peanut butter marketing."    When Madison Avenue has to sell an inferior product, one of its tricks is to advertise the product using its weakest, not strongest, attribute.  If this is the first you are hearing about this, you'll now notice it everywhere you go.  The most obvious examples are junk food sold for their healthful properties.  How do they sell Jif Peanut Butter?   "Choosy moms choose  Jif ."  If you're choosy, no way would you choose the peanut butter that contains way more salt and sugar than real peanut butter, which is just ground-up peanuts.  Same with Kool-Aid or Hi-C--crap in a can--"filled with vitamin C" or of course the recent KFC marketing of fried chicken as health food.  Think fast:  what's the worst thing about HMOs?  Limited choice of doctor, poor quality of care.  Everywhere you'll see billboards selling HMOs on choice of doctor and quality of care.  Citibank sells you credit cards by making fun of identity theft (to see how Consumer Federation of California makes fun of Citibank go to these hilarious spoofs:   urlLink CFC Spoofs )  The important issues have so much going for them, that's why the good guys always hype "we're for clean environment, jobs that pay a living wage, affordable housing."  But what if that's not the right approach?  What if we need to start marketing like Madison Avenue to get people back to our side?    "Be Progressive, do it for the fringe benefits." "Uncle Sam does it quicker, better and cheaper." "Pay your taxes, America needs the money more than you do."  On a closely related topic, read  urlLink How the Democrats Were Betamaxed  telling how Republicans have "betamaxed" the American public into buying Republicans, a weaker product, instead of Democrats, the product that more meets their stated needs.

       Ah-nold Intrigue: Doing what he puts his mind to, or not?  Like the rest of the nation, I find it fascinating to watch Governor Arnold.  Oh, not so much because he's a movie star--I only recently saw one of his movies for the first time, the one where he's pregnant and looked better than I did in maternity outfits--but because he seems to be the very epitome of actualization.  I tend to agree with Dan Weintraub's column in the  Sacramento Bee  today  urlLink 4/29/04 Weintraub Column   (and I don't often agree with Weintraub anymore).   Weintraub looks at the Governor's can-do attitude and asks the question, when is he going to use it to deliver on his promise to disinfect the corrupt government with sunshine.  "I will open up the windows and doors of government," he said, before he was elected.   "No more decisions in the dark."  So far, his top "victories" have been backroom deals.  But he is capable of amazing feats.  Witness his turn around of the recent (ill-advised, in my opinion) pair of initiatives to borrow California's way  partially  out of this year's debt.  The initiatives were polling at 39% a month out.  He campaigned vigorously pronouncing, with all the vigor of a daily affirmation, "they will pahss."  And they did, over 60% of voters opted to leverage their future.  Think what he could do if he applied that power to something that really mattered, like getting public financing of elections for the State of California, or universal health coverage.   International National Outrage:  SIERRA MAGAZINE STORY REVEALS U.S. MINING COMPANY'S SUPPORT OF TERRORISTS LINKED TO AL-QAEDA   Read the amazing Sierra Club story at  urlLink http://www.sierraclub.org/terrorism   revealing how a Denver-based mining company secretly paid off Al-Qaeda-linked terrorists under the auspices of "international security."  ABC is reporting on it on Primetime Thursday too.

       Political Alert--Will Horton hear a Who?  Will California take its first major step towards clean public financing of elections like the voters opted for in Arizona and Maine?  Tomorrow, March 20th, the California State Assembly's Elections Committee is scheduled to vote on AB 2949, the public financing of elections (or "Clean Money") bill introduced by Assemblymember Loni Hancock (D-Berkeley).  As of last night, Chair John Longville (D-San Bernardino) and Assemblymember Lloyd Levine (D-Los Angeles) were inclined to support the bill.  The bill needs one more vote to clear its first hurdle.  The two Republican members of the committee are committed to voting no.    That leaves Assemblymember Jerome Horton (D-Inglewood), fresh from defeating the Walmart, as the key vote.  Will Horton, usually motivated by money and self-interest, be true to his constituents' interest and vote for this historic measure?  If you live in any of these members districts, call them.  For more information check out the website for the California Clean Money campaign:  urlLink www.caclean.org     Stay tuned...   Local recommendation of the day:  Aching back?  A good masseuse in Sacramento is Sandra D'Amici (916) 752-8765 -- On J between 26th and 27th.    Unsolicited advice of the day:  Have goals  Quiz, who said "the main thing that gets in the way of people achieving their goals is not having any"? Answer:  me (and everyone).  If you want to accomplish anything at all, get goals--big ones--the kind that make you feel like a little kid waiting for Christmas.  Write them down on an index card at least once a day.  Even that little act will put you on the road to achieving them--no matter what you do (oh, and subscribe to  urlLink Rich Results  newsletter). Peace, Sara

       My First Blog Ever   Aha! Almost a year after my last birthday when my brother suggested I create a Blog, I create one. Wow. Here I am. My very own blog.  Checkout my picture in today's Sacramento Bee front page of Metro section story "Broadway Plan Raises Hackles."   urlLink http://www.sacbee.com/content/community_news/sacramento/story/8946499p-9872695c.html   It's an okay picture--I made sure I stood slightly behind the guys in front of me to minimize my hips--but I'm listed as "President" of the Southside Park Neighborhood Association, which I'm not.  I'm the "chair."  This may strike you as a distinction without a difference, but it has resonance in my community.  Anyway, I'm glad Terri Hardy wrote the article.  The surrounding neighborhoods to Broadway in Sacramento are concerned about the apparent interest of our City Councilmember in giving control of the revitalization of this strip to business interests, to the disadvantage of neighborhood groups.

       Sara's Silly Subaru Saga  1999 - buy white Subaru Legacy Wagon brand new, "Brighton" bottom-of-the-line loss leader model from Shingle Springs Subaru (negotiate great price using techniques so excellent Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook, former head of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration once asked me to help her negotiate car purchase).  2002 - tree limb falls on roof, comprising passenger cage.  Sara is convinced by auto safety expert Rosemary Shahan that car cannot be safely driven again.  Cannot get declared totalled.  Car is impeccably repaired under close supervision.  Then we purchase 1998 white Subaru Legacy Wagon 75,000 miles, lotsa options from  urlLink Shiller's Subarus .  2004 -  (two weeks ago) Sara rear ends a car that rear ends a car in a classic mommy driving kids to school accident.  "Mommy, you didn't fill out this permission slip!"  "What permission slip, oh, that one...wait, look out!..." CRASH  Car being fixed.  Have PT Cruiser rental paid for by insurance--woo hoo!  Look at us in the PT Cruiser!  Oh, it's "totalled" (as in, they can recoup enough by selling it for scrap to offset cost of settlement).  Back to  urlLink Shiller's Subarus  .  (last week) This time I buy a 2002 silver Subaru Legacy Wagon, 89,000 miles loaded.  Sam Shiller grows used Subaru's on his little farm outside of the Sonoma County Airport.  I've known several people who have bought from him.  It's well worth the trip.  He and his wife are the salts of the earth.  They certify these vehicles have never been crashed and they get them in top condition for you.  They sell them to you at the bottom of the dealer blue book price and don't dicker.

       President Gore Speaks  Al Gore's statement issued today is nothing less than presidential.  It is impossible to do it justice through any remarks I might utter in this ridiculous blog, but you can't blame a blogger for trying.  If it were the speech of a sitting President, rather than a defeated candidate for President, it would be remembered and quoted.  If it were John Kerry's stump speech, we would be on our feet 'til we turned numb.  It calls for resignation of Rumsfeld, his deputies, Condoleeza Rice, and George Tenet.  It eloquently, and quite perfectly, says everything that needs to be said about the court-appointed President, his team, and the conditions he has created.  To quote only a bit:   George W. Bush promised us a foreign policy with humility.  Instead, he has brought us humiliation in the eyes of the world...  These horrors were the predictable consequence of policy choices that flowed directly from this administration's contempt for the rule of law.  And the dominance they have been seeking is truly not simply unworthy of America--it is also an illusory goal in its own right.  Our world is unconquerable because the human spirit is unconquerable, and any national strategy based on pursuing the goal of domination is doomed to fail because it generates its own opposition, and in the process, creates enemies for the would-be dominator.

       More on Randi Rhodes  A few weeks ago, I plugged  urlLink  the Randi Rhodes Show   (AM 1240 in Sacramento) as being the left's answer to Rush Limbaugh.  Now, after several weeks of listening to her (and Al Franken) regularly, I second my own motion: she  is  Limbaughesque, in the extreme.  To wit, I am afraid I must report that, like Limbaugh, she is grossly inaccurate, rude and very seldom knows what she's talking about.  Moreover, she's not so much "left" as profoundly anti-Bush and pro-Kerry.  What put me over the edge was her rant on Nader--not unexpected and not undeserved--however she repeated several times that Nader had "founded the Green Party" to run in '00 and that the Green Party had "rejected him as their standard bearer" this year and so Ralph was forced to desperately turn to that "loser Ross Perot's Reform Party" for help.  As most of my readers know, none of these statements are true.  Specifically, Ralph did not found the Green Party; it is more accurate to say that he rejected their nomination than vice versa and lastly, it seems more strategic to turn to the Reform Party than anything else--"loser Ross Perot" was polling ahead of both Clinton and Bush in May of 1992 and the skeletal structure of his party gets Ralph easy access to several key states.  She also called Ralph an "egomaniac," a term I've heard people I respect throw around as well.  I strongly disagree with that, but I'll call it a debateable point rather than flat ass wrong.   Don't misunderstand me.  I still enjoy the show.  It's just that from here on out, I think you'll find the reception better from on top of a lick of salt.

       (:)(:) Two Snouts Up for  Calendar Girls   I thought I was going to just love this movie.  Great story (nude middle-aged women).  Great cast (Helen Mirrin).  Came highly recommended.    Instead, to me it had about the production and script value of a quickie made-for-tv-movie.  Just about every "twist and turn" was predictable from 5 steps out.  What is the value of a true story if it's not stranger than fiction?

       Faithless Unitarians in Bush Country  According to the Austin  Star-Telegram , the Texas Comptroller has denied a Unitarian Church tax-exempt status on the grounds that it "does not have one system or belief."  So, a centuries-old religion to which 2 former U.S. Presidents belonged, has been deemed belief-less.    With even religious freedom threatened by the Bushocracy, why am I the only one who seems to believe that we could win a campaign against Bush on freedom issues alone?  Freedom is the defining issue for Americans.  Question: what swings voters? Answer: freedom of choice over women's bodies, freedom to own a firearm.  Bush's supporters are running ads talking about Bush fighting for freedom, working to preserve America's freedoms.    Yet, America's freedoms are facing their greatest threat in 50 years:  freedom to speak, freedom to associate, freedom to check out whatever books you want, freedom to fly, freedom to vote, freedom to tithe to a Unitarian church are all under systematic attack by the Bush administration.  Even though I am equally passionate about the rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure and habeas corpus, we need not launch this campaign for freedom by fighting, as we usually do, in the context of the rights of "criminals."  The average American will never identify with criminals.  Bush will continue to be able to play upon fears and insecurities and us vs. them to justify the need for stripping us of our cumbersome civil liberties.    But should we make it easy on the ABCs (Ashcroft, Bush and Cheney) of fascism?    I say, no.  We should take a page from Karl Rove's playbook.  Rove succeeded in getting Kerry to play defense for days on whether he was really a legitimate war hero.    The lynchpin of Bush's campaign is fighting for our freedom.  Let's ask, what freedom?  What is Bush fighting for?  The scandal in Abu Ghraib prison is just the tip of the iceberg of what price freedom for Bush.

       I just met a girl named Maria  So my mom is all excited about this interview with Maria Shriver she read in  Sacramento Magazine .  It details the children's books she's written to answer questions she gets from her own on various tough topics like death ( What's Heaven?),  disability ( What's Wrong With Timmy? ) and Alzheimer's disease ( What's Happening to Grandpa? ).  That's all well and good, but what I don't understand is why so little has been made of the book she's currently writing-- Why Did Daddy Grope Those Ladies? --which should be a huge bestseller.

       One step ahead of MoveOn.Org  Dude.  Check it out:  2 days ago I called for a campaign on Kerry to be bold and articulate a vital and winning strategy to get out of Iraq; and today, MoveOn.Org does exactly  urlLink that .    Can I call it,  or what?  (uh-oh, I'm starting to talk like Dik)  On the off chance that you're not on the list of the most effective and important national on-line advocacy group ever.  Here's what they have to say:   Dear friend,  As George Bush's poll numbers drop quickly, John Kerry is facing an important choice -- perhaps the most important choice he'll make in his campaign. He has to decide whether, as some consultants will urge, he should be cautious and run toward the center, or whether he should present a bold agenda for change and rally Americans around a vision for our future.   Through his history, Kerry has made a practice of standing up for bold initiatives to provide health care, protect the environment, and safeguard the right to reproductive choice. Together, we need to let him know that we want him to be his best, boldest self -- to go big, ask more of us, and power his campaign on the politics of hope.   Please join me in calling on John Kerry to "go big" at:    urlLink http://www.moveonpac.org/gobig/?id=2845-3349305-nC7MUGKp49Zo_f4Dk5BpXQ    Thank you.

       Let's Pressure Kerry on the war  Hey, you know, it just hit me like a ton of bricks: I helped raise $63,000 for Kerry's campaign and I don't think he's pushing the President enough on the war.  MoveOn.org and the Kerry campaign and the DNC are on my back every f***ing day to do more for Kerry, and I will, but hey, let's put some pressure on him too.  He's our best chance for really making the case to the public and putting the heat on Bush.  How shall we do it?  And what shall the message be? And who else is doing this that we can piggyback on?  And how can we do it without undermining him or highlighting the "flip-flop" that the White House is trying to tag him with?

       (:)(:)(:) Three Snouts Up for  Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself   Before I talk about the movie, I have to add and subtract some previous snouts (I'm just getting the hang of this whole movie critic thing and my snout-based rating system).  1 or 2 of you that actually read my blog will remember that I gave  Dogville  3 snouts up and  Japanese Story  4 snouts up (out of a possible 5 snouts).  In hind(quarter)sight, that really should have been reversed:  Dogville was the better, more unique, creative and enduring movie.  Now for  Wilbur :   I liked the movie very much--it is a small independent picture by the director of  Italian for Beginners .  It is sweet, well-acted and well-conceived.  Despite the title, the movie is not at all depressing.  You care about these people and what happens to them and you believe that these are their real lives running a down-at-the-heels book shop in Glasgow.  Jamie Sives is dreamy and compelling as the magnetic yet despicable Wilbur--I wouldn't be surprised if we eventually see him on the American screen.  Even the most minor characters in the strange hospital that intersects with this family's lives are well-drawn, well-acted and interesting.  See it, and let me know what you think.

       From  the Washington Post:   Nader's Advice To Kerry By William Raspberry      Ralph Nader, according to many who say they used to admire him, has become the self-centered star whose press clippings have gone to his head, the dog in the manger, the skunk at the Democratic garden party.     After all, the man whose name comes to mind at the mention of the phrase "consumer advocate" is also the man who almost certainly helped elect President Bush -- by siphoning away a few thousand Florida votes that otherwise would have gone to Al Gore.     And now he's running for president again!     Well, the advice here is that the Democrats -- very much including presumptive nominee John Kerry -- would do well to pause in their brick-throwing long enough to listen. Because what Nader is offering, he genuinely believes, is a road map to a Kerry victory.     "A part of the problem," Nader said in an interview last week, "is that the Democrats have become too cautious -- too indentured to the same money the Republicans are dialing for. Kerry's consultants and handlers are telling him to tone it down, and he has. For example, he's now saying, 'I'm not a redistributionist, I'm a centrist,' and that speaks volumes. Because the issue isn't redistributing wealth in the old-fashioned sense but stopping the redistribution that's already going on through corporate welfare."     In fact, ending corporate welfare is one of 10 elements of what Nader is certain would be a winning campaign. "Democrats would like it, but so would lots of conservatives, liberals and progressives who don't like the way wealth is being redistributed in this country." Here are some other ideas on Nader's list:     * Support a living wage. Kerry should propose a living wage -- and act as though he means it. Huge numbers of Americans (10 million  households) earn less than $10,000 a year. Those workers would be substantially better off if the minimum wage had simply been indexed for inflation -- "like congressional salaries" -- over the past 35 years.    * Go after corporate crime. "This would attract a lot of conservatives to his cause -- certainly as many as there are Reagan Democrats. I'm talking about people whose 401(k)s have been destroyed by what Enron and the others have done through corporate greed."    * Repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. The prospective yield turns out to be "almost exactly what the American Society of Civil Engineers said last year it would take to restore America's deteriorating infrastructure" -- roads and bridges, schools, libraries, water and sewer systems, public buildings. "Everybody could get behind this, from labor unions to the Rotary, from workers to the corporate suppliers. And the best part is that it would create thousands of good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced to China."    * Protect the poor. Low-income Americans have no legal protection for many of their ordinary transactions -- either because the appropriate legislation hasn't been enacted or because of "a congealed lawlessness that goes unprosecuted." Nader's list includes check-cashing businesses for people who don't have access to bank accounts, tax-refund loans at usurious rates, rent-to-own schemes, dumping of tainted meat and shoddy merchandise in inner-city outlets, bank red-lining, and all manner of predatory lending. "Democrats should flock to this issue, and the Republican blur machine couldn't do a thing about it. You know how they blur issues: passing an inadequate prescription bill and saying that takes care of the elderly, or passing No Child Left Behind and saying that takes care of education."     Nader says Kerry should demand reform of a tax code that taxes work more than it taxes wealth; promote reduced reliance on fossil and nuclear energy; and support a reversal of policies that "make it almost impossible to form a union in the private sector anymore."     As for the war in Iraq: Kerry needs to set a date for withdrawal of American troops  and   companies. "The way to separate mainstream Iraqis from the insurgents is to make clear that there will be no American occupation -- stop building those 14 military bases -- and no puppet government. Bring in peacekeepers from neutral countries and from Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world, until Iraqi forces take hold with internationally supervised elections."     "If Kerry takes these positions," Nader concludes, "the only thing he'll have to worry about is how big will be his landslide."     Maybe. At the very least, it would provide an answer to those who've been looking for some reason to support Kerry besides the fact that he isn't Bush.

       Ralph and Me  I know, I know.  The emails keep coming.  Sorry people, but the cock is never gonna crow thrice with me and Ralph.  He's my hero and Joan Claybrook thinks I may be the only person in America who has a signed written apology from him.    That doesn't stop me from wholeheartedly supporting Kerry this time.  Nor does it stop me from wishing that Ralph would energize his 9 percentage points to vote for Kerry, but you're not gonna get me to say it's his ego or that he's selfish.  This is a man who built a vast network of public interest organizations by putting the truth and issues above ego.  He never wanted it to be about him.  He has always loved to see other advocates come into their own, get the byline, the spotlight, the gig on Nightline.  He has never played the Mirror, Mirror on the Wall game, not with anyone.  But he is arrogant and he is sure he is right.  That pigheaded quality has generally served him well, but sometimes it hasn't.  Jeez, the whole way I got that apology was that I had organized a dinner at $5,000 a head with wealthy arab-americans to support single payer health care.  All Ralph had to do was waltz across the street to his favorite lebanese restaurant and put in an appearance.  He wouldn't and we had words.  He wouldn't because health care was Sid Wolfe's turf, not his, and he wasn't going to intrude on it and it wasn't his responsibility.  We had words because I wouldn't take no for an answer.  So I know Ralph can be pigheaded, but he had to apologize to  me  because he thought I was too pigheaded.  This tour of duty is entirely consistent with how Ralph has always been, uncontrollable and more concerned with telling the truth and letting the chips fall where they may, be they on Democrats or Republicans.  Let's just hope we don't all end up covered with chips this fall...

       Kerry Beats Clinton Hands Down  This is true in so many ways, but the way I mean now is that everyone needs to stop fretting.  Everyone keeps talking about trouble in the Kerry campaign, but all the polls show a statistical dead heat between a relatively unknown challenger and an incumbent President.  The Bush operation has been playing defense for several days straight due solely to their own ineptness on the world stage.  75% of the American people are "shocked and appalled" by the torture of prisoners in Iraq (leaving aside that the same 75% is completely unaware and unconcerned that similar abuses happen every day in American prisons).  In May of 1992, Bill Clinton was running third for President against Big George after Ross Perot, 19 points down.  Granted he was the comeback kid, but we've got the (gag me) "comeback Kerry."  My point is that if this is "foundering," let 'em founder and we can laugh all the way to the inauguration.

       Getting Used to Air America Radio  After 3 1/2 days of lotsa listening to Air America (AM 1240 in Sacamento, find a station near you  urlLink here ), better known as that new liberal Al Franken radio network, I really love it.  But it takes a little getting used to.    Normally I only listen to rabid talk radio when it's 2am and I'm on the interstate outsida Gary, Indiana trying to get to Buffalo by dinner time--that is to say, almost never.  And there's a big fat reason for that (his initials are R.L.).  Al Franken of course wants to be the leftwing answer to Rush--after listening a while, I can tell you he's not.  He's too laidback and generally sweet to pull that off.  Oh, he is funny.   And they've wisely paired him with a Minnesota public radio pro who knows more about staying funny on the air all morning.  But the real anti-Rush is the afternoon host,  urlLink Randi Rhodes .  A hilarious, obnoxious, fast-talking Brooklynite who puts (even suspected) Republican callers right in their place and randomly switches from what she read in  The New Yorker  to how's she not getting laid to her problems getting the Pottery Barn to deliver her new couch (and "why don't they selling any f***ing pottery?").  This show is to die for.

       All Nonessential Email Must (not) Leave Iraq  Chris McGinn tells me to link to this  urlLink blog  to read about how Halliburton employees in Iraq are on 90-day nonessential email suspension per the pentagon.

Give Hetch-Hetchy One More Chance  If you enter Yosemite National Park on Highway 120, you drive right by the entry to the Hetch-Hetchy Valley entrance to Yosemite.  Have you ever gone there?  Although it purportedly broke John Muir's heart when Hetch-Hetchy was made into a reservoir to quench San Francisco's thirst, the valley is still breath-takingly beautiful, especially this time of year.  Today we hiked from the dam to Wapama Falls, about 5 miles roundtrip.  Amazing wildflowers, butterflies, great path all along the "lake" and a spectacular waterfall payoff at the end.  Do it in April or May to survive the exposure and see a lot of water.   Sign *MY* Petition to Oust Rumsfeld  I returned from 3 days out of town to emails from MoveOn.org, the Kerry campaign, the DNC and TrueMajority.org, and a couple of friends to sign "their" petition to demand Rumsfeld's firing.  Setting aside for a minute the question of why President Bobblehead is going to care what I and my *liberal* friends think of his cabinet choices, or how it's going to help us to sacrifice one pawn in the Cheney/Rove game only to replace him with another, just *whose* petition is this?  I signed the Kerry one.  Click on  urlLink this  and do it if you haven't.

       Don't Ralph, Don't!  I field a lot of questions these days from people who want to know, am I supporting Ralph again this time?  If not, why not?  If I strongly feel Bush should be defeated by any means necessary, why didn't I last time, etc.?  None of these questions have particularly easy answers, but they do have answers.  To wit, no, because I like Kerry, because I didn't like Gore.  Am I furious at Ralph for running again this time (the way so many people I know are)? No.  He has a right to run and I don't think he's doing it out of ego, if anything it hurts him.  Do I wish he weren't running?  Yes.  I really do.  At first I really wished it for him, because I thought it was worse for him.  But right now, with polls showing Bush and Kerry neck and neck with Ralph with 4-9% (depending on the poll).  That troubles me.   Read  urlLink this article  on Nader taking aim at Kerry on war.    Of course, everything Ralph is saying is fair game and true (it almost always is) and it is very hard to justify Kerry's tap-dancing on Iraq.  Maybe Ralph's numbers and visibility will force Kerry to take a firmer stance on the war--and maybe, just maybe that'll still be able to swing the right voters in the right states.  Right now, all we can hope is that most of the Ralph support is coming in states that will go for Kerry anyway--after all, that's where I campaigned for Ralph last time.  More to come on this subject.

       (:)(:)(:)(:)--Four snouts up for "Japanese Story"  Saw and loved brilliantly-acted Australian film 'Japanese Story' directed by Sue Brooks and starring Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, About a Boy).   Collette and Gutaru Tsunashima, the Japanese man she leads around the deserts of Australia have the same build and a marvelous subtle androgyny to their relationship.  Gotta love the camera directed by a woman slowly caressing Tsunashima's lithe form on the beach while matter-of-factly announcing Collette's ass in her khakis.  Oh but there's much more to this romantic, strange and unpredictable Australian woman/Japanese man outback road movie...   Reader Mail  "Kill Bills' 92 Personalities" and related entries provoked some strong responses-- Mark Worthington of L.A., himself a creator of Hollywood film environments, currently teaching in Hong Kong, felt that my response to "Kill Bill" might be akin to what an "an uninitiated viewer might think of the 'emoticon'."  It all comes down to context...  Jane Macauley of Sacramento on the other hand seemed to agree with me wholeheartedly yet went further to suggest that Ted Koppel's recitation of the names of the dead U.S. soldiers in Iraq was equally emotionally numbing and unnecessary as "Kill Bill" or the story of the woman with 92 personalities.  Mateo Burtch of San Francisco likes the blog in general, but thinks there should be more porn and recipes.  Mark Stivers of Sacramento reacted to an earlier posting, "[w]hen you wrote in your blog, 'If this is the first you are hearing about this, you'll now notice it everywhere you go,' you indirectly referred to a phenomenon known scientifically as an acausal synchroneous event and informally as 'the shrimp thing.'  This describes the situation where you see something for the first time in your life and then immediately see it three more times in the ensuing days.  While I haven't seen the movie myself, 'the shrimp thing' is a reference to the movie 'Repo Man.'   Writers beware  Be careful, if you write to me, I might publish it.  Also, if you're a subscriber--watch out, when you reply to the group, it goes to the group (some readers found out the hard way!).

       I thought my new emoticon ate my 92 personalities but I turned out to be wrong  Maybe it just wasn't meant to be, but by inadvertantly clicking on my own installed emoticon link above, I just negated 20 minutes spent composing a lenthy emotionally stirring piece regarding my evolving opinions on fictional vs. factual horror and abuse.  I am way too tired to recreate it now, but here were the highlights:  My mind turned to real and imagined abused after being forced this evening to watch a decade-old Oprah interview with Truddi, a woman who copes with her horrific child sexual abuse through the use of her 92 personalities (actually, in a sad addendum to the piece, we learned that two of the personalities were former navy seals turned mercenaries who died in Iraq this week, so she's down to 90.  Ted Koppel has not decided whether to read their names on the air.).    [all right, I'm tired and cranky--in the original piece, I did not make fun of the 92 personalities.  But what am I gonna do, that fucking emoticon ate some of my best work!]  I revealed my ancient rules for avoiding hideous depictions: leave during the second anal rape. never read any of the well-written books sent to me by my well-meaning and wonderful mother-in-law.  I bare my deep and abiding contradictions by waxing semi-eloquent about the brilliant contrasts in the movies Pulp Fiction and Blue Velvet.  I confess that I had to create an entire personality just to cope with the basement scene in Pulp Fiction.  I close by dissing Kill Bill and its sequels, suggesting that if whatever we put our attention to grows and comes to fruition, we better not put our attention to Lucy (not to be confused with Carol) Liu and her severed heads.  Not to mention I would rather not have started my evening hearing how a tiny girl was raped by her stepfather and covered with snakes.

       My very own emoticon!  I am so excited.  My insanely brilliant friend Mateo Burtch created it to celebrate and represent a certain period of my life that he was, frankly, never really part of, but may wish he was.  Click  urlLink here  to see it.   The Merits of Kill Bill's 92 Personalities  Tonight, as part of a writers' group, I was subjected to a decade-old Oprah interview with a woman named Truddi who claimed (quite credibly, I'm afraid to say) to have 92 personalities as a coping mechanism for the horrific abuse she suffered as a child.    Naturally, in order to better understand Truddi and the made-for-tv movie about her life that was airing that evening on other ABC affiliates, Oprah needed to probe deeply into the twisted and psychotic torture Truddi's stepfather dealt her from the age of 2 on.  I knew I would hate watching this and I did.  I have always hated any depiction or talk of child abuse.  I simply cannot abide its existence.  And isn't that the way it should be?  Shouldn't *everyone* loathe, abhor, reject and condemn any such instance?    Obviously the answer is yes.  But the more complex question is what form that condemnation takes?  Does a dramatization and books about and subsequent interviews with survivors of such horrors make it any less likely that they will occur again?  And on a related question, for years I drew a distinction between "real" and "fake" terrible stories.  Oh, don't get me wrong.  I have never had a high tolerance for hellish scenes or stories of any kind.  For years I've been served well by a basic rule of thumb:  I walk out of any film during the second anal rape.   I also don't see horror films (exception:  The Shining ).  And, truth be told, I don't really enjoy the experience of reading the many well-written novels depicting childhood evils given to me my wonderfully literate and completely sunny and optimistic mother-in-law.    Yet two of my favoritist favorist films are  Blue Velvet  and  Pulp Fiction .  Now what is up wit dat?  Blue Velvet contains at least two rapes (albeit only one anal) and I have created at least one additional personality whose only job is to remember the basement scene in Pulp Fiction.  I have often waxed on, completely unoriginally, regarding the brilliance of the contrast between the happy sunny 50's society and its seamy underbelly in Blue Velvet and the sheer audacity of violence and over-the-top cartoon characterizations of Pulp Fiction.  (Sadly?) I find that tolerance and appreciation of incongruous over-the-top violence coming to an end with the 60 seconds I saw of  Kill Bill  the other night (my Bill was watching  Kill Bill  to prepare for  Kill Bill II ).  In it that asian actress from Allie McBeale and Charlie's Angels was lecturing an audience while holding up a severed head--it was out of context, but I was given to understand that she had a hand in why head was now bodiless.  As I understand more and more that what we visualize and put our attention to in this world comes to fruition, I fret increasingly about visualizing creative new, untold horrors.   Maybe what I'm saying is the same as people who dislike violent movies because they believe violence begets violence, but it feels different to me.  It's more about where we focus energy, money, attention, time than it is about the ultimate product itself somehow.  So I'm relatively clear on this:  I won't see Kill Bill or Kill Bill II and I don't really want anyone else to see it--although I'm sure many of you have.  But what of Sybill, 92 Personalities and the like?  Does it do harm to focus on what's (I presume) true and most vile in our socieity?  Or is it better to focus on what we want to bring about, a world where children are treated with love and respect?   Can we we create the latter without acknowledging the former?  I invite your comment...

       Today's Outrage  Technically, this may be yesterday's outrage, but I was too tired and blissed out by community yesterday to be outraged.  Today, I've recovered enough to rally.  It's this:  Sinclair Broadcasting Company, a huge Republican-leaning media conglomerate, refuses to run a segment of Nightline on all 13 of its ABC affiliates because Ted Koppel was reading the names of the war dead in Iraq and this goes completely uncovered by my local paper,  The Sacramento Bee .  Nor, as far as I can tell, was this outrageous censorship covered as such by any of the major dailies in the country (please someone, tell me I'm wrong).  I see it was on the AP wires, mostly as "Ted Koppel reads names of war dead on 'unusual' show," with some coverage of the controversy.  But who picked it up?  That this administration has things so clamped down that solemnly reading the names of dead soldiers has become a "slanted news story" staggers the imagination.  Surely this story of censorship should not itself be censored.   Sacramento Restaurant: Taste of Thai  On an entirely different note (with apologies to out-of-town readers), but have you tried the Taste of Thai restaurant on Broadway?  If not, do.  I think it may be the best Thai restaurant in town--with the possible exception of Thai Basil on J.

       The toxic mimic of community  I spent my May Day in seven hours weeding, mulching, scrubbing, drying, stretching and k'vetching with around 40 other neighbors in my cohousing community.  We ranged in age from four to 78 and in ability from limited use of hands to whole body.  We ate, we laughed, we argued, we sprayed each other with water (a high of 90) and at the end we had a May Pole and a drumming circle that lasted into the night.  I recently heard a story on NPR's Talk of the Nation or something regarding these "sim" games on computers where people spend hours under a fabricated identity living in a fantasy world (although it's not clear that it's really their fantasy, more likely the creators or "gods" of the simulated world.  Plus, it has to be said that these places are no longer the shangri-las they once touted themselves as, they have crime, prostitution, drugs, nasty backstabbing everything I would think one might want to escape given a choice.).  Caller after caller described themselves buying and selling real estate, running for office, organizing controversies.  They touted the ability to change their name, their body, their gender, their income and live out this simulated existence.  What was palpable for me was the degree to which a yearning for community was driving the need for these people to log in dozens of times a day.  I was aghast as they described how the sims filled the void created by the emptiness and loneliness of their own lives.  As a listener who is deeply involved in real world politics, and genuine in-person community, I frantically dialed the 800 number over and over (to no avail) to tell my story, to offer my existence as a solution, a different choice.  If these people put half the energy they put into running for President in a fake world into organizing their own real neighborhoods, that would create real power, real change, real community.  I was reminded of something Caroline Casey (a wonderful inside-the-beltway astrologer for cynics) once said as she was trying to explain the inexplicable popularity of Princess Di and other celebrities: to wit, our culture lacks, and therefore craves mythology.  We no longer have gods and goddesses to worship; therefore, just as fast food sucks toxic faux nutrients out of its stryofoam containers, we seek the toxic mimic of a goddess:  goddess Diana.  And we feed on her image.  So it is with the Sims.  Human beings simply must have community.  It is essential to our survival in every possible way.  So, some of us who keenly feel the lack of community seek its toxic mimic in simulated on-line community.  Given a choice, would anyone really trade genuine tired muscles (at least one of them from smiling), full bellies and three-dimensional love of one's fellow man for the illusion of thin thighs, a faux castle and a thriving real estate business?  I, for one, like to think not.

       Campaign Against Bush: EPIC Style?   This part of the conversation is run-of-the-mill cocktail party chatter across America right now : "It's completely unprecedented!" says I. "I mean, think about it, when has it ever happened that millions of people have paid  money  to see an in-depth anti-incumbent 2-hour movie?  I mean, it hasn't!  And in  red states  too!"     This part is new:  "Actually, it's not completely unprecedented.  This is basically what the right wing did against the EPIC campaign," says CLCV So Cal Political Czar, David Allgood.  " EPIC ?" screech I.  "What's  EPIC ?"  Okay, so then he reminds me:  EPIC: Upton Sinclair's radical comprehensive plan to End Poverty in California, upon which he built his race for Governor in 1933.  A modicum of insufficient internet research (found some USC grad's Ph.D. fascinating thesis called  urlLink  Going Negative: the Smear Campaign Against Upton Sinclair  ) reveals both more and fewer parallels between the campaigns than even Allgood, no doubt paralyzed by temporary alcohol and nicotine withdrawal, contemplated:  True, cinematic genius and studio controller Louis B. Mayer played a key role in defeating Sinclair and electing conservative Republican Frank Merriam by creating and widely distributing several fake newsreels purporting to show the disastrous results if Upton Sinclair were elected Governor.  But a closer look at that 1933 election reveals even more similarity to this Presidential race.  The real reason Sinclair seems to have lost was an unravelling of his own base, his own party.  He was, it seems, successfully portrayed at least, as so far out of step with the mainstream FDR Democratic party that large factions defected every day on the campaign trail.  Throughout the campaign, Merriam seems to have laid relatively low and allowed Sinclair's many detractors to bring him down.  The apparently wild success of  Fahrenheit 9/11 , especially among middle American possibly previously apolitical types, coupled with ever-amazing outcries from the Republican oldguard elite (former ambassadors and admirals come to mind), show that Bush is in deep deep doo doo.  And, frankly, ala Merriam, who can blame Kerry for standing steady while his opponent sinks ever lower into the Michael Moore raked muck?  Let's just hope the result is the same: the radical (Bush) defeated.

       No, Simply Music isn't giving me a kick-back for this promotion  If you've ever wanted you or a child to play the piano with fluency, but haven't succeeded, consider taking a course in the  urlLink Simply Music  method.   urlLink Simply Music  believes that everyone is musical and teaches you to play blues, classical and popular songs in your first few weeks without forcing you to learn to read music first or practice scales (like I had to for years).  In December of 2003, at the age of nine, never having had a piano lesson, or, indeed, any formal music instruction before, our son began taking  urlLink Simply Music  lessons in Sacramento.  The results were astounding.  Our son has always been interested in music, but he is really just a normal 9-year-old boy.  He likes to play and watch basketball and other sports, read  Captain Underpants  books and run around giggling and being silly with his friends.  At the end of his first lesson, he was playing a real piece of music nicely.  At the end of three weeks, he had memorized three pieces and was playing them with expression and feeling.  He couldn’t wait to go to his lessons or to practice, or watch the video or listen to the CD or, indeed, anything associated with the program.    None of the homework was overly time-consuming or difficult to fit into a busy family week.  And the lessons are only ½ hour long—perfect for a child’s attention span.  He learned to play over 12 pieces in as many weeks, everything from Beethoven to Blues to Amazing Grace.  When I contrast this to the many years as a child that I put in doing scales, learning to read music and slaving away doing piano exercises—I have so much less to show for it today (and even then) than my boy does after just those few weeks.  I am learning more about playing the piano from watching his lessons and practice  than I did in over seven years of lessons!  Both he and I are completely hooked on this affordable and stunningly aptly-named program,  urlLink Simply Music .

       911 Centigrade  I didn't think I would do it this weekend.  I had friends visiting.  I had things to do.  There would be other weekends.    And I uncharacteristically scorned MoveOn.Org's suggestion of a week or two ago to take a pledge to do it.  A pledge to watch a  movie ?  I don't think so.  I'll pledge to call my congressman, give money, or hold a house party.  But I won't pledge to see a  movie .  Much as I adore Michael Moore, and much as I planned to see the movie, I drew the line at that.  And I didn't even blog about it (or much of anything--hey, I was camping, cut me some slack!)  And then, the weekend approached and people began to ask me which showing I was seeing and could I watch their kids while they went to this showing and did I have tickets and what would I be wearing and who would I be going with and would we be renting a hotel room and did we hire a limo and...well, you get the idea, it was no longer an option not to attend this weekend.  It was no longer a question of whether, it was all the other details that mattered.  To not see this movie on the first weekend it opens is like not voting.  It's not an option.  And so, like everyone else in my corner of the demographic political woods, I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11  this weekend.  To be precise, I paid $5 to see it at 12:15pm on Friday, the first showing in Sacramento at the Tower Theater  urlLink Save the Tower .  The 7:45 showing was sold out before we got there.  Our showing sold out, and the one after it did too.  Rumors of Bush-supporting hecklers spread through the crowd like wildfire (okay, fueled largely be me, but...).  We glared suspiciously at each other, looking for the telltale signs: hair that doesn't move on women, lack of hair on men, flag lapel pins or crassly displayed crosses.  Surely that man with a beard and birkenstocks couldn't be one of them?  Nah, the notebook means nothing.    Due to a misguided last minute attempt to cop soup and bread at the Tower Cafe, we're stuck in the front row with Susan Barnhill and Ed, necks craned to take in even 50% of Michael's girth.  We are thrilled.  We are atwitter.  At the last minute, I cause everyone around me to gasp by asking loudly sotto voce, "this is the  Passion of Christ , right?"  It's not the  Passion of Christ .  But it does have an audience of true believers and plenty of gore (both upper and lower case).  And it's moving and educational and provocative and everything else it should be.  And now, a day later, I'm babysitting for my niece so my brother and sister-in-love can fulfill their civic duty.  Yes, (:)(:)(:)(:) Four Snouts up for Fahrenheit 9/11 and for the hype and for Michael Moore's projected $30 million dollar weekend.   Meanwhile, my son is eager to take the pledge to see  Spiderman 2  at midnight this Wednesday.  He can't wait to see Doc Oc.

       Protesting a Referendum on Public Funds for a Sacramento Arena  Last night I participated in a good sized rally outside the City Council meeting to protest Mayor Heather Fargo's concerted effort to use hundreds of millions of dollars worth of public funds to subsidize building a new sports arena for the Sacramento Kings--thwarted by her council representing its constituents well, she is now trying to get     City Councilmember, soon to be Assemblymember, Dave Jones led the troops as we packed the hearing room, standing room only, with a crowd outside pushing to get in.  After 3 hours of pro stadium drek, culminating in a stupid LA-like statement by some (Sacramento King-owning) Maloof or another, flanked by the usual bimbos and bodyguards, Mayor Fargo let the public speak.  You can read about it in today's  urlLink  Sacramento Bee  article , in which I, or someone remarkably similar to me named "Sara Nicohols", am/is quoted.  What I said when I testified in the hearing was different from what is quoted.  I said that although the residents of Southside Park would love to have a new sports and entertainment complex walking distance downtown, we are currently trying hard to get the city to build us a new playground, put more lights in the park, dredge the polluted lake and keep our youth club fully funded.  We, like virtually every citizen of Sacramento, are vehemently opposed to public funding of a sports arena.  We find it impossible to believe that the Mayor and the Council aren't well aware of the public's strong opposition to public financing.  And the revelation of some tortured polling can lead us only to believe that it will be used (like most polling) to sell the public something we don't want or need.  I didn't say this, but I, for one, will really resent having to fight this referendum on the November ballot.  Doesn't the predominantly Democratic City Council understand that we've got a U.S. Senator to re-elect and a President to defeat?

       Run, Dennis, Run!  Okay, so I was phonebanked by the Dennis Kucinich for President campaign last night.  Apparently, the campaign is really picking up steam.  Dennis just won a primary last week and has picked up 2 more delegates.  Maybe my friends are right, maybe I've just become too mainstream, because I could barely keep from laughing at the well-intentioned phonebanker with a surprisingly good rap--at the end of the call, I complemented her on her pointless message and she said, "yeah, I give good phone."  (maybe once the campaign raps up, she can make a little more money with that skill on a 900 number...)  Anyway, Dennis wants you to sign all these excellent  urlLink petitions  to pressure Kerry and the Democratic party at the convention.  I signed all of them except the one to create a "Department of Peace"--it's probably a great idea but it just read a little too loony-tunes for me.

I took the kids up into the Sierra foothills for the day and floated and played in a glorious mountain lake...er...reservoir.    Completely peaceful except for the motor boats and constant walkie talkies of families talking to their kids in the woods to make sure they are safe.  "Bobby! do you read me? over"  "Yes, mommy, I read you. over"  "What are you doing, bobby? over"  "I'm being torn limb from limb by a mountain lion aaaaaargggh over"  "well.  at least I know where you are.  over"

       Exhausted blogger  To return from one's college reunion tired and hungover to a national week of mourning for (as my mother used to put it) "that man" is too much to be borne.  One close friend quips, "Haven't we been to enough Reagan funerals over the years?"   As Arianna Huffington observes in her most recent  urlLink column , comparisons between Bush and Reagan are in-apt.  Reagan was loved because he painted a bold, optimistic big vision of the future.  Bush's only strategy is to prey upon our fears, not hopes.    Kerry, on the other hand, is capable of playing to our hopes.  Arianna is pushing Kerry to play big to win big--this a winning strategy.    But it takes more than just big talk, it takes the right words and images to win the American public on the right terms.  Maybe Berkeley framing expert George Lakoff's recent tutorial on  urlLink "Simple Framing"  could be used by Kerry to change the lens through which the media see the important issues of today.

        SacBee  Columnist Dan Weintraub Scorches Me  After reading my extremely weak latest  urlLink Eye on the Pie   column, the ever Arnold-phantic  urlLink Dan Weintraub  comes back with this (which is, incidentally, a more succinct compilation of similar thoughts expressed by  urlLink Vince Marchand ):   Nice column, even with the gratuitous slap at your favorite SacBee columnist. Your trust in Kerry is touching, but it does seem a bit out of character for you. I don't picture you as the "save me!" type, but more as the engaged citizen who knows what she wants and demands it from her government, even if it is a government she trusts. Actually, while you were reading the Economist, Kerry was starting to answer the question himself. And it is starting to sound as if he and the Hated One almost agree on the future of Iraq at this point. Provide security. Get the UN and other nations involved. Get out as soon as possible (stay as long as needed and not one day more). As badly as Bush has screwed up on the details to date, I really don't think there is much difference between them about how they would proceed going forward. I think the real questions for them to debate are 1) was it right or wrong to invade in the first place, 2) knowing what you know now, would you do it all over again, and 3) would you ever do something similar in another country. I think Bush's answers are yes, yes and yes. Best I can tell, Kerry's are no, no and no. And that difference, not who should be the minister of finance in Baghdad, is where the real debate should be engaged. I would pay big money to see it.   My response:  while I agree in large part that it is somewhat out-of-character and distasteful for me to rely on the politician to provide the answer, in my defense I want to steer my readers to the end of the column where I clearly stated that we had to force Kerry to articulate this clear position.  I disagree vehemently with the assertion that there's no difference as to how Bush and Kerry would proceed going forward.  I think there's a decent chance that they might issue disturbingly similar sounding  statements  about what they'll do in the future, but their actions in interpretation of those statements and their likelihood of success will be radically different.  And here's where trust is a big issue again:  He who is "missing his Herbert" has demonstrably lied to the American people more than once on this war; he has destroyed decades of credibility and diplomacy; he has blown apart important world alliances and burned bridges.    JFK will not do this.  His record in Congress unequivocally shows that he can and will do this right.  Karl Rove and his merry men are working double-time to convince Americans that John Kerry is a wishy-washy flip-flopper.  I can tell you from working in Washington as a public-interest lobbyist that this is far from true.    Like Horton (when he hatches the egg), Kerry has a record of saying what he means and meaning what he says.  He has a record of doing the right thing, or, when he's wrong, admitting it and taking responsibility for correcting his course.    As someone who has worked with a multitude of politicians at all levels of government, I can tell you that this quality matters, ultimately, more than any other.    Perhaps, it is why, when the nation finishes mourning the loss of our greatest B actor, you will hear attack after attack on exactly that fundamental and extraordinary truth about John Kerry.

       Burn, Baby, Burn   My pal Doug Heller at Arnold Watch (Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights) gives us this insight into the latest outrage from Enron:     urlLink http://ArnoldWatch.org weblog  - June 2, 2004 - 12:45 pm  "Burn, baby, burn," is what one Enron electricity trader gleefully said about a California wildfire during the energy deregulation crisis.  The fires, which knocked down power lines, helped push electricity prices higher.  But that was one of the tamer comments found by CBS news among tapes in which Enron employees talk about shutting down power plants to steal "money from California to the tune of about a million [dollars a day]," and selling electricity to "grandma Millie... for f-----g $250 a megawatt hour."  The tapes also show that Enron's head honchos, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling were in the loop on the schemes to rob California blind.  (Even with these revelations, the feds have not ordered the billions of dollars in refunds that Californians are due.)  The tapes can be heard  urlLink here .

       4 Snouts Up for NYC  I can attest that New York has still got it. While  everyone  else in the world was in Boston this week, Bill and I were in Manhattan. Among many other diversions, we saw two plays:  Bug  and  Caroline, or Change .   (:)(:)(:)(:) 4 Snouts up for  Bug   Very dark twisted minds created this stunningly well-acted and well-written play set entirely in a rundown residential hotel on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.   urlLink  Bug   "off-Broadway" at the Barrow Street Theater in the west village is for you if you love a good paranoid schizophrenic naked violent comedy. If you're tired of that genre, go see  Cats  for the 3rd time, see if I care.   (:)(:)(:)(; 3 and a half Snouts up for  Caroline, or Change   Still far from the  Cats  set but squarely on Broadway (well, the Eugene O'Neal on 49th, but who's counting) is the new Tony Kushner play  urlLink  Caroline, or Change   .     This one is a musical set in 1963 Louisiana centered around a black maid working for a white Jewish family.  Tony Kushner's story and Jeanine Tesori's music are fabulous, compelling, perfectly and unpretentiously staged and acted.  I absolutely love Tony Kushner's writing in the two-part critically acclaimed  Angels in America  (which, if you haven't seen the made for HBO movie of, you must).  The only weakness, and for me, it is a biggy, is that so far I sense no particular talent in Kushner as a lyricist, and he wrote all the lyrics.  The lyrics tell the story well and vaguely go with the music, but that's the end of it.  Now I'm not lookin' for Cole Porter here; I know that era is sadly long gone.  No.  I'd settle for Webber or Rice (whichever one does the lyrics)--despite the great story, bouncy enjoyable early 60's rock 'n' roll and R&B score, there is not a single memorable song in the show.  I hummed nothin'.  And that says to me, why bother?  Stick to the straight show, Tony.

       President Kerry!  Hey, I'm trying to say this before every blogger and pundit in the nation does: Kerry's nomination acceptance speech tonight at the Democratic Convention was masterful in content and delivery (and he only used the word  values &nbsp; 375 times!)  How did he do it?&nbsp; I am blown away by what he accomplished.&nbsp; Somehow he was simultaneously presidential, measured, serious, bold and inspiring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some pundits are already trying to define this speech as centrist.&nbsp;&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; It has phenomenal centrist appeal.&nbsp; But it is far from typical tweedle dum/tweedle dee DLC fodder.&nbsp;   The typical Clinton era "new Democrat" speech takes Republican policies and softens them for Democrats and the mushy middle.&nbsp; This speech did the opposite.&nbsp; It took hardcore liberal Democratic policies and goals--FDR and LBJ's Democratic party--and cloaked them in the rhetoric and value-laden language that the Republicans have previously owned.  This speech was a George Lakoff wet dream--Kerry took all the advice this Berkeley professor and his team have been turning out for the past two years and put it to good use.&nbsp; Example: "instead of talking about  family values,  let's talk about what we're going to do to  value families."&nbsp;    This simple turn-of-phrase (which would be dubbed a "charlie the tuna" in the advertising world--Starkist doesn't want tunas with  good taste , Starkist wants tunas that  taste good ) plants a seed of doubt in the minds of every idiot swing voter (hey, I'm not promoting&nbsp; Slimfast , I can be as hatefest as I want)&nbsp;who has salivated over Bush's  family values-- what do they really mean? it asks.&nbsp; Do they value families?&nbsp; Are they telling the truth?&nbsp; What if they're not?    And that's not all!   Bill Magavern of the Sierra Club thinks that this is probably the earliest that the environment has ever appeared in a Democratic nominee's acceptance speech (within the first 5 minutes, in case you weren't timing it at home).&nbsp;&nbsp; Kerry hit all the key issues: the economy, Iraq, health care, dependence on foreign oil, fair trade and good jobs, ending racism, education--plenty of red meat for the party faithful.&nbsp; But instead of pandering to the crowd or giving a traditional partisan speech, he did something brilliant, he took our issues and spoke about them in a new way, so that they were everybody's issues.  And&nbsp;he did it with passion, sincerity,&nbsp;and&nbsp;conviction&nbsp;as if he were already President.&nbsp; And so it is.

       New Progressive Action Group formed in Sacramento  I am pleased to announce the formation of People United for a Better Sacramento (no website yet), a grassroots membership-based&nbsp;issue advocacy and political action group working to enact progressive policies in the Sacramento area.&nbsp; Brought together in the wake of a successful push to elect City Councilmember Dave Jones as the Democratic candidate for Sacramento's state Assembly seat, the group is the first explicitly progressive cross-cutting issue-advocacy organization working to bring real change to the Sacramento region.&nbsp;   The board (of which Dave Jones is President and I am Vice-President)&nbsp;reflects a diverse&nbsp;cross-section of&nbsp;activists&nbsp;coming out of various communities: environmental, civil rights, labor, youth and student, senior, neighborhoods, disability rights, housing and other grassroots groups.  Our first action is to oppose taxpayer funding for a new sports arena in Sacramento.&nbsp; But, last week's City Council meeting brought a referendum on that matter that much closer.&nbsp; The  Sacramento Bee   urlLink reports  that the (Sacramento Kings-owning) Maloofs are seeking a referendum&nbsp;in a special election (even more expensive!) in March.&nbsp; That article also contains the first (as far as I know) news clipping reference to the new group we've founded--shorthand, "People United," please, not "PUBS."&nbsp;

       Meanwhile, back in Sacramento...   Well, I'm not back in Sacramento, but other people seem to be and the Democratic Party is hard at work capitalizing (sic) on Scharzenegger's most recent gaff.&nbsp; Go to  urlLink sacramentogirliemen.com &nbsp;to buy the actually really cute eponymous t-shirts--all proceeds go to the Democratic Party.&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Get this straight: this is a t-shirt making fun of a governor who was making fun of the Democrats by making fun of an ancient&nbsp; Saturday Night Live  skit that was making fun of him before he was governor.)

       Dateline Buffalo   Just got in from seeing the Psychedelic Furs play at the Continental Club on Franklin near Chippewa&nbsp;in downtown Buffalo, NY.&nbsp; The highlight of the opening act was a band called Kristofferson Airplane playing a cover of "Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch Cherry Bomb" a tiny hit from the early 80's, which gives you an idea of what caliber acts typically play the Continental.   The mix was bad and the acoustics terrible, but the Furs show was great--high energy, lots of fun.&nbsp; Chippewa street was hopping on a warm Wednesday night in Buffalo.&nbsp; Some 20 years ago when I lived in Buffalo, Chippewa never  hopped .&nbsp;&nbsp; Chippewa might have sold you drugs at 4am when the bars closed.&nbsp; It might have put its highheeled foot on your car and straightened its fishnets.&nbsp; But it never  hopped .   Buffalo is kind of dichotomous these days.&nbsp; On the one hand certain strips in the urban core are alive with independent restaurants, bookstores, coffee shops and throngs of customers.&nbsp; Property values have risen steeply in the gorgeous huge old homes on quiet tree-shaded residential streets spoking out from these hubs.&nbsp; Yet the City of Buffalo is financially unviable.&nbsp; Soon voters will consider a referendum, supported by the mayor and the county executive, to merge the city into the county government, because the city can't run itself on its tax base anymore.   Despite repeatedly grilling my father-in-law, probably the foremost expert in the region on state and local government and fiscal issues, I still don't fully understand how both these things are true at the same time.   But I take it as instructive&nbsp;for Sacramento now that we're fighting a big push for a taxpayer-funded sports arena in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the most exciting, thriving retail environment can't take the place of real jobs, it just gives the rich people somewhere to spend their money while the city dies.

       Nip/Tuck on F/X is Fun/Vile   3 Snouts Up (:)(:)(:)  Have you seen this tv show?&nbsp; It combines soft porn with graphic&nbsp;surgery--what could be more enticing?&nbsp; Brought to you on basic cable: two men in a plastic surgery partnership in Miami--one cute, sweet and ethical,&nbsp;the other&nbsp;gorgeous, slutty and unprincipled.&nbsp; The scenes cut abruptly (sometimes literally) between slightly more than Sex-in-the-City level "love" scenes and vacuuming out "cottage cheese" during a lipo-suction (dieting tip:&nbsp;just try and eat your late night cereal in front of this show). &nbsp; Somehow it's hard to resist--it's reasonably cleverly written and conceived and so disturbingly edgy that you're drawn to it without wanting to be.&nbsp; It doesn't hurt that Vanessa Redgrave's daughter plays the good doctor's wife and Vanessa Redgrave plays her witchy know-it-all psychotherapist mother obsessed with her own looks.&nbsp; At one point Redgrave senior gets it on with the unscrupulous 40 year old son-in-law's partner and then gloats about it to her daughter--nasty, vile and irresistible.&nbsp; But resist if you can, this is one show which signals the end of civilization is at hand (and do we need reminding?).&nbsp;  urlLink Tuesdays at 10pm.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       There is no blog  Thus far, I've proven an unreliable summer blogger. One week in Yosemite, no computer, no phone, no blog.&nbsp; But then one week back, computer, phone, only one entry. &nbsp; In my defense, I was readying the entire house for repainting and recarpeting--a job only slightly short of what's required for moving.&nbsp; And only slightly less irritating to the people around me, it turns out. &nbsp; Everyone's heard the stories of marriages gone bad from remodelling a kitchen.&nbsp; Months without end of washing dishes in a bathtub take their toll on even the serenest souls.  But who has ever heard of&nbsp;1 month's worth of prepping for painting and carpeting driving a family insane?&nbsp; Well, actually, just driving me insane,&nbsp;I think.&nbsp; My husband and children never complained.  But after about the 5th dinner conversation where Bill introduced some interesting topic from his day, worthy of say, an entire blog, like the inside scoop on&nbsp;Schwarzenegger's shenanigans on the budget in the&nbsp;California&nbsp;legislature&nbsp;and I responded with something as fascinating as "yes, but have you looked at the sample  Sedona Sunrise  streaks I painted on the wall?," I was boring  myself , yet I couldn't  stop .&nbsp; I had to have him see the  Sedona Sunrise , I  had  to. &nbsp; Okay, it's behind us.&nbsp; It's in the painter's hands. &nbsp; So, now we're here in Buffalo, New York for two weeks.&nbsp; It's cool and rainy and everything is fabulous.&nbsp; After months of unrelenting Sacramento sunshine, it&nbsp;is delightful to sit on a porch swing and read while the afternoon thunderstorm pours down around us. &nbsp; I'm hopeful that I'll write something more interesting tomorrow, but at the instance of the Rev. Julie Interrante, I'm reading  No death, no fear  by Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.&nbsp; As such, I've learned that there is no death and no birth.&nbsp; By extension, I think I can easily surmise, there is no blog.

       Don't Blog About  urlLink Nader    urlLink Bill Magavern  tells me not to blog about Nader any more, but then we watch Ralph interviewed on   urlLink The Daily Show with Jon Stewart   (hosted by  urlLink Stephen Colbert , not  urlLink Jon Stewart !) and Bill raises some interesting questions:  [full disclosure: both participants in the interview are former employees and current devotees of  urlLink Public Citizen , an organization founded by Ralph Nader, and Magavern is a former employee and current fan of  urlLink U.S. Public Interest Research Group , which is an idea Ralph had in the shower that now is a huge national network with branches in several states.  Magavern has, in the past, travelled with Ralph several times and Ralph asks about our children when he sees us.  Magavern currently works as senior legislative advocate for  urlLink Sierra Club California .]  Nichols:  You seem outraged at the lack of thoroughness of this  Daily Show  interview, Bill. Why?  Magavern:  Well, if the substitute host for a fake news show won't ask the tough questions, who will?  Nichols:  Yes.  But what exactly are the tough questions?  I mean, he asked him about the spoiler thing...  Magavern:  Look, with Edwards added to the ticket just that day, the question to ask was, obviously, isn't it true that Kerry and Edwards have been consistent allies of yours in fighting corporate power?    And isn't true that you in fact advised Kerry to have Edwards as his running mate?  And given this fact shouldn't you support this ticket and stop hiding behind the canard...  Nichols:  Hold it.  Can you hide behind a  canard  ?  Magavern:  Well now you're applying a standard to the quality of writing in your blog which frankly...  Nichols:  Okay.  Okay.  Stop hiding behind the canard...  Magavern: ...that there is a unified Democratic position that's soft on corporate power, when in fact Kerry and Edwards, if elected, will lead the Democratic party and it will be what they want to be which is not soft on corporate power.  Nichols:  Well, you make some good points, but what about the free trade thing?  Isn't one of Nader's strongest anti-corporate positions against trade uber alles and aren't Kerry and Edwards free traders?  Magavern:  No.  Kerry is.  Edwards isn't and hasn't been and Kerry's reconsidering his position on trade...  Nichols:  Since he's been running for President?  Magavern:  Well, yes.  Nichols:  What about the Iraq issue?  Ralph is out there raising important questions about the war and Kerry voted for the war powers.  Isn't that a legitimate difference between the candidates?  Magavern:  Ralph can raise the issues without being a candidate for President.  Can I check my email now?  Nichols:  Sure, honey.  Magavern:  Don't forget to tell them that Ralph scooped everyone when he announced that Jon Stewart was absent because his wife just had a baby.  That was the best part... Nichols:  I won't, honey.

       Back from Paradise  So, yes, I've been on vacation for nearly a week.  Out of cell phone and email range for the most part in Yosemite--truly awesome, in more of a 19th than 20th century way.  I spent more time contemplating subjects such as the pursuit of excellence, and how all people are essentially good, than I did politics per se, or other favorite topics (gee, are there any?).  Midweek, when turned back from a hike to Dog Lake at Tuolomne Meadows due to a not yet recovered son (waaah!), I stopped in at the Tuolomne General Store for a soda and some cashews.   When asked if they had the newspaper, the young man behind the counter said, "yeah, maybe, we have some newspapers, but I don't know if they're today's."  I walked over to it and chose between the  Fresno Bee  and  USA Today --a tough one: I chose  USA Today , first time buying it in years without knowing that I was quoted in a story (okay, gratuitous reminder that I once was quoted with frequency--now, if you Google me, you get some 19 year old soccer playing Sara Nichols and a question I asked of a cohousing list serve 8 years ago).  And then I read the headline as I walk back to the counter to pay for it--"Oh my God!" I scream.  "Have you even  looked  at these?  We have a Vice-President--it's  Edwards !"  "Whaaaa...?" said the rocket surgeon behind the cash register.  "Lemme see that," he glances at the headline.    "Whatever," he pronounces.  "Whatever indeed," I cleverly admonish, paying him a dollar for the paper.    Fortunately our son is more excited than the cashier about the selection.  "Joe [his best friend] loves Edwards even more than Kerry.  He shook his hand when he came to Sacramento."  Sure he shook Edwards hand.  Who didn't?  But did he talk his way into the $1,000 donor circle room upstairs along with 40 other people and shake his hand under false pretenses like me?  I didn't think so.  I like Edwards for VP.  As the Republicans will remind us daily: we've got the first most liberal and the 4th most liberal vote in the US Senate (by one credible study, truth be told, although Bill and I both think first place should've gone to Boxer--whose nightshirt I'm wearing as I compose)--woo hoo, what a team!

       Today's Ruminations on Kerry  Everytime I think I'm too slavishly defensive of Kerry, I get a boost from an Arianna Huffington column; this latest column looks at Kerry vs. Clinton as candidates( urlLink  Political Real Estate: John Kerry's Room with a View  )--read it and tell me what you think.    I tend to agree with her on this (and many things).  While Kerry isn't half the candidate Clinton is, he'll be twice the President (and hey, that's saying a lot, Clinton is looking pretty damn good right now--well, he always  looked  good, it was just--slap!--down girl, I've always had a little thing for Clinton, but it's purely physical not political, back on task...) and isn't that the main thing?  Fortunately, this is the best election year for a not-so-great candidate in decades: with only a pulse, a different last name than Bush and a (D) after his name, most of his voters would work their rear ends off for anyone to beat the chimp.  The secret, and I wish it weren't one, is that this year we've got someone as our standard bearer who has the makings of a great President.  I think he's going to win and I think it's going to be a different experience than any of us in my generation have ever had.

       Bill and his children in the news today  It's a busy day in the Magavern household--trying to handle all the press calls.  Here's what the fuss is about:  Both kids made all local evening news and  urlLink online sources  today by appearing at a press conference protesting diverting money from youth programs, like parks and pools, to a new taxpayer funded downtown sports arena.  The announcement was (clearly purposely) overshadowed by a sudden breakoff in negotiations between the (Sacramento Kings-owning) Maloofs and the city of Sacramento, causing local news to speculate that children were forcing the Kings to leave.  Bill was rockin' and rollin' in the  New York Times,  in  urlLink Plan Would Consolidate California Agencies  where he unveils shocking news that regulation of air pollution actually works and would be harmful to roll back--who knew? (apparently, not Arnold!)  In the meantime, I forced my kids to make picket signs, drove them to press conferences, and cheered them all on dressed impeccably in white (actually, I was wearing a purple t-shirt and capris with unidentifiable stains and hadn't brushed my hair in days, but who's counting?).

       Why Kerry will Win  Okay, this'll be one of those little headlines I stand a decent chance of wincing about next year, but here's what comes to me like a flash when I watch these candidates on the trail: Kerry wants to win and Bush doesn't.  Really.  Yesterday, while I watched clips from Bush on the stump, I thought: this man hates his job.  He doesn't want to win.  Oh, he likes airforce one and all the good golfing trips, but the campaign is seriously cutting into his vacation schedule and it's become a pain.  And then when you look at Kerry you see utter utter determination, focus, force of will.  This man is in the fight of his life and he refuses to lose.  And then today Randi Rhodes reads this clip on Air America Radio from  Capitol Hill Blue --a mudslinging websheet of some sort--which reports  urlLink Bush's Erratic Behavior Worries White House Aides --read this!  If anything in here is to believed (actually, upon closer inspection, this little piece is 2 months old--why was RR only just reading it today? and why hasn't this blog been updated lately? and some of it contradicts my initial thesis, but heck read it anyway, it's awfully fun).   Bottom line: Bush is losin' it, people.  He needs to be sedated and taken to a quiet place, not re-elected.  For God's sake, if you love the President, get him help!
