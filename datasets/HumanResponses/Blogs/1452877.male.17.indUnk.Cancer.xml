      I thought I was gonna get some Doritos, but I got a doughnut instead.  A Bismark to be exact.  Where do they come up with names for doughnuts?  Insane.

      How do you start a blog? Really. Do you just start typing, and dive into deep meaningful thoughts and blog-ri-la (If you don't know what this is a reference to, look it up.)? Or do you start with short blogs until people get used to you? There's nobody reading this blog yet, and most likely no one ever will, so I'm gonna try a new tactic, the "Question How You Should Start a Blog" blog starter. You just watch, this new approach will be the biggest thing since Pet Rocks.  I'm ashamed to even know about those awful little things.  That's it for this blog entry. More later. Or not.

      Thanks to my tracker, I've discovered that this blog has gotten it's first visitor!  The person then proceded to click out of the browser, unplug his/her computer, throw his/her computer on the ground, stomp it into oblivion, and then took several showers.  This information was also provided by my tracker.  Scary huh? :)

      It's down to 5 days until pain, and 9 days until bliss.  That sums it up.  And please keep your fingers crossed that I don't pass out during the pain.

       Countdown to Movie-Going Bliss     Okay, so to counteract the "Countdown to Excruciation" I'm also going to have "Countdown to Movie-Going Bliss."  As many may already know, (meaning the two of you that are reading) I'm talking about The Matrix Reloaded. I was hoping to go in a black leather trenchcoat.  That fell through. Mainly because of the whole money issue.  Chhh.  This movie is gonna be so sweet.  Anyway, there are 10 days until movie-going bliss.

       Countdown to Excruciation      Okay, so it turns out I'm gonna be drugged (I like that word it's like a combo of being dragged, being drugged into submission, and bad English!) to my sister's piano recital!  It's on Mother's Day, which is even worse, not because I was going to do anything fun, but because Mother's Day always lands on a Sunday for some reason. So there goes my Sunday, utterly wasted. Since Mother's Day is on the 11th this month, so there are 6 days until complete and total excruciation.

      It wasn't so bad (The Pain).  If you don't consider sitting for 45 minutes in a hard, wooden pew while 5 year olds mame and torture their songs beyond recognition bad.  Other than that, it wasn't bad.  The lemonade afterward was okay too.

      Sweet!  Going to Matrix2 tomorrow with a good friend of mine who's name will be "Brett" since it's not a good idea to give people's real names out on the 'Net.  It should be really good.  I'm also thinking about getting the new  Enter the Matrix game .  Looks really good.  They say it's going to re-invent gaming.  I'm skeptical.  Ooh commercial for it!  Looks pretty good.  The whole Atari thing is kinda a throw off, since they're kinda an old game publishing company.  Oh well, I'll find out eventually.

      A long time since I last blogged.  Didn't see The Matrix2 on opening day.  Something came up.  I also tried Saturday night.  It was sold out a ways into the night.  Like two showings or something.  Well, I'm going to try Thursday night.  Hopefully it's not selling out a week after the release date.           ------- So, a couple of movies were rented last night, which I watched.  One was The  Truth  About Char lie  and the other was Catch Me If You Can.  Catch me if you can was pretty good, little long, but you know, pretty good anyway. -------  music.msn.com  is down.  So you know, don't go there, it won't do ya any good. ------- Found some cool Matrix-esque flash animations.  But  do not  go to them.  People with weak stomachs, do not click  here . ------- That's about it.  Out.

      I've been looking at other people's blogs to see what they blog about because I was curious.  Really.  I was thinking I was doing it wrong or something.  Still haven't found out.  Though I have formulated a theory.  People make stuff up.  I really think so.  They just make up stories and say they really happened.  I could be wrong and probably am and there's no way to prove it, I know, but too many of them seem too perfect or too unrealistic.  Updates later.

      Well, today was something else.  I helped a couple of other guys move a horrendously (I probably spelled that wrong, oh well) huge copier.  And I'm talking about those wussy copiers that they have at Kinkos, I'm talking a gigantically large copier. Somwhere around 600 lbs.  This is where it get's interesting...First, somebody forgot the ramp to wheel the copier onto the trailer.  Impossible?  Not on your life.  These guys jack up the front of the trailer so the back of the trailer is almost touching the ground.  Then they use levers and such and tons of pushing to get it onto the trailer.  So, we're en route and then the copier breaks through one of the floorboards (I told you it was heavy), fortunately not all the way through.  So we get it back to my house and then we have some trouble getting off the trailer, but it works eventually, and we get it inside, and to butt-copying nirvana. Haha, you just read a post about moving a copier!!!  Grr, I just wrote a post about moving a copier.  I guess you win.

      So, I decided to "edit my blog" which means I'm gonna add a post.  "Edit your blog," who comes up with this stuff? ------- The Matrix 2 was too cool.  You have to go see it.  If you have no money, sell your dog (or cat) to go see it.  I'm sure someone will pay $10 for some dog.  Or maybe you could find a stray...  Anyway, it was really awesome.  "The Smiths" scene was beyond belief.  It was like ten minutes long.  And just beautifully choreographed.  Just really beyond words (other than the ones I used).  So, go sell your mangy mutt.  Or do something.  Just go see it!

      Okay, so it's been a couple weeks.  Let me give you the Cliff's Note of the life of Scott (that's my name).  I'm taking golf lessons.  Lots of fun.  The instructor is something else.  Really.  He's pretty good though. My grandpa is coming out from Washington State.  And I'm going camping over 4th of July weekend.  That's it.  Later

      I'm gonna take the rest of the weekend off.  I have to get ready for a bunch of friends coming over tomorrow.  Since I don't like cleaning, which is what I have to do, when I was making french fries for my self someone thought I might cut my finger off to get out of the work.  Well, I didn't do that.  It's a good thing too since I need my fingers.  So I changed the awful colors of my blogskin.  It was just bad.  It made me sick.  Made me want to cut some fingers off, lol.  And I put some links, which I'm gonna keep adding to get my blogshare price to go up.  That's it creeps, out.

      Okay I think that I can't use titles because my blog skin isn't supported anymore.  So I have to change my blog skin.  This is gonna take a while.  Uh, I'm thinking about launching another blog with a friend of mine.  I don't know if it will work out.  It should be interesting if it does.  Man, I wish my life was more interesting so I had something to blog about.  I need to shut up now.  You know something wierd?  I use the spell check on this blog thing.  That's not the wierd part.  When you use it, it shows the word "blog" as incorrect.  Heh, somebody messed that up.

      Well, I think I just made a bad mistake.  Or it might turn out okay.  I just change this blog's URL from manuforti.blogspot.com to manu-forti.blogspot.com.  I have no idea what this means.  It could mean that my blog will show up twice in the most recently published blog and it might not don't know.  And it probably messes up the search engines too.  I wish there was something funny to say.  I think that's it.

      So I'm testing comments.  I'd like to say people are asking for a comments page--they aren't.  In fact, people aren't asking for anything, at all.  I'm doing this because I'm bored and it might be interesting if anyone makes a comment.  It will, no doubt, have to be censored.  Here goes.

      I've been messing around with the "Jedi Academy" demo.  I had a point to this story, but it eludes me now.  The demo's really cool (it should be for a 180 MB download that took a whole hour), but it only gives me  two levels.  I wish I wasn't so cheap as to just go buy it.  I probably wouldn't be so cheap if I had any money right now.  Though I think "cheap" sounds better than "broke."  So now I am going to test out the URL field so if it comes out wierd and there's a random link somewhere on the page, it's probably going to be the link to the Jedi Academy website which everyone should look at even if you aren't a Star Wars fan, because it's in top ten best games ever.  Booyah.

      I can't figure out how to use the drafting tool.  I lost a wonderful post on the Seahawks.  They were losing at the time.  I explained how there's only two TVs in my house.  All for shame.  I have no idea what the last sentence means.  Well, the Seahawks won by 1 point.  3-0 baby.  Monday night football with the Broncos is what I'm looking forward to.  Go Broncos!  So, I've been spending most of the day sanding doors for a job remodeling job my dad is doing.  Hand-sanding.  Tedium.  Arthritis.  Serious abdominal pains.  I'm guessing it pays well.  Maybe not.  Later folks.  And send your friends here!!  Blatent self-promotion.  The things I do for more hits.

      So what.  I took a hiatus for summer vacation.  It's not like anyone's reading.  The last viewer was someone using the keywords "nothing+better+to+do."  Really that person...had...nothing better to do...  So nothing happened over the summer.  I sniffed enough perfume to shut down my nose for a few days.  I hate perfume.  I went to the arcade.  I played golf.  I played playstation, more playstation.  A couple of friends moved here (here being where I live, and you don't need to know where that is unless you are stalking me, and if you are drop me a line so I can tell you not to stalk me anymore).  I got my Driver's license.  That's it I guess I'll blog later about stuff that comes up. Though nothing ever seems to.

      Okay, one of my good fiends, Burst, has a brother, Burly, just bought himself a sweet 1992 Ford Cummins diesel, five speed, with a splitter.  If this wasn't a cool enough, it has a power inverter to plug household items into, powering off of the truck batteries, a touch screen radio/CD player.  Ooh, so cool, but this is what caps it off: a sweet folding 13.3 inch LCD TV/monitor.  It also has jack to hook up a game console, which is exactly what they are gonna do.  And I'm going on a road trip with them this spring!!!  XBOX sweetness....

      I'm finally getting around to writing about the weekend.  This is because I'm finally getting over it and memories are coming back.  Well, a few of my friends were here and so one of them saw a lightsaber prop I had made a while back and since it looks somewhat real, and he didn't know that they couldn't exist he asked how to turn it on.  I told him to point it at his face and mess with the buttons.  He was all like "really?"  I about busted my gut laughing.  Anyway this probably isn't that funny to everyone else, but it was too me. I went and stayed the night at another friends house and played video games a lot.  Which was fun then I went over to Jaq's house (the lightsaber guy) and helped him with his new computer.  And let's see, I had to drive to the library to turn in some books and stuff yesterday.  Wow, nothing happens in my life.  Hey, if you are a member of blogshares.com, go buy some stock in  urlLink my blog (this blog you're reading).  It's a good blog right?

      Ever had electric nachos?  Me either.  But apparently, someone was stupid to name Jennifer Garner's character's name.  I just saw Daredevil.  Electric nachos.  Yum.  So I'm still trying to get my computer savvy friends to get on blogger.  It should be soon, they a little uncooperative though.  I'm still laughing at the computer savvy comment.  One of them is, the other two or three aren't.  They know how to get around and stuff, and they can spell, so the should be fine on blogger.  I think I'll keep this blog after "Captain Pinkbeard's less incredible sidekicks" launches.  It might be a couple of weeks before that happens. And all the requests for this blog is really sad. Not one positive comment.  Wow.

      Okay, so I've been gone,  well my internet went out.  Out cold.  Must have spent a day all together trying to fix it.  It finally starts working under more than questionable circumstances.  Anyway, it's working now so I can write.  Well I got a new video game and I've been playing that too.  Nothing's been going on at all.  School, school, school, that's all that seems to happen.  No one is buying stock in my blog.  Someone would have to read it before that happens, so it may be a couple of years.  Oh well.  I was thinking, and I know how profound this is, that Donald Duck has the last name "Duck."  I know what you're thinking "Well, duh!"  That's not my point.  Though it would have been a good one.  Anyway, Donald's uncle, Scrooge McDuck, has the last name "McDuck."  Another good point there, but that's not the point I'm getting to.  Why is Donald's uncle's last name have the extra "Mc?"  I don't know.  If McDuck is an uncle on Donald's dad's side it wouldn't work, and if it's on Donald's mom's side what are the odd of her having the last name "McDuck" and marrying a dude (Donald's dad) with the last name duck?!?!?  This thought process scares me.  Later creeps.

      Oh so much has happened.  Things got so busy which is quite weird for me. My shoes never dried so I had to scrape the silicone off and redo it with some other stuff.  I started tutoring a little girl.  So I tutor her on Thursdays.  It's somewhat interesting.  I've been playing The Sims a lot.  Everyone now knows why things got so hectic.  It has taken away hours of my life that I will never get back.  Ever.    Later.

Apparently, there's is one very dedicated person who keeps coming back every few days and then there's nothing here!  Well, I have nothing better to do but write on this which shows that if I have time to write on this that I have nothing else going on so this is gonna be boring!  Let go for the ride.  I'll be back to catch everyone (the one person who reads this--you know who you are 64.210.196.197!) up on what's been happening.  A fair bit actually has.   You notice how at the top of your blog blogger will put ads that reflect what you are writing? Well, they have Donald Duck ads right now!  I gotta change that so:  Audioslave Audioslave Audioslave Audioslave Audioslave Audioslave Audioslave.  There that should do it. Laters.

      I'm currently reading The Art of the Deal by Donald J. Trump.  It is quite good and I highly recommend it.  Of course now that I've recommended it its sale will immediately drop.  Trump know how to write an interesting book that's for sure.

      Well, I'm going to start where I left off back in November.  I don't remember anything from November.  I do remember some in December.  The Broncos were ousted from the playoffs.  I believe that was December, if not, it was early January.  At the time I was in the booneys and didn't find out until the next morning, which, may I say, sucked.  I then watched the rest of the playoffs, somewhat less enthused.  And then the Patriots won!!  AGHH!    Anyway in the middle of January There was a party and I played Madden and won once and then lost badly.  Towards the end of February there was another party.  At this one  of my friends got piss drunk.  Seriously lit.  So later his parents find out and they aren't happy and then everybody's parents find out and now no more parties.  So the night that he (Jaq) got drunk, as I later find out, was the night that a senior was going to ask me to prom.  Woah.  As a guy and a soph, I found this highly odd.  And I know you're probably thinking well she must not be that hot.  Well you're wrong if you were thinking that.  She's pretty hot.   Though I probably wouldn't date her after going to prom with her.  Well the next night, she calls.  I'm dozing on the couch.  All the sudden my dad tells me there's a girl on the phone.  So I'm still in la-la land and then she just right out of the blue says "you wanna go to prom with me?"  Ayaiyai!  I must have not said anything for 15 seconds though it seemed longer and just stammered.  I was dumbfounded.  I said yes of course.  And then called her cousin(whose name will be Parmesan) who was going to go get his tux the next day.  So I go with him to get my tux too.  My date to prom and her sister come with us so we don't make any horrible choices, we do anyway, but it was fun to have them along.  So while we're there my date's sister is helping choose a tux.  At this point and every point I'm having more fun with her.  So Parmesan and I get horrible tuxes that have tails and such.  I dared him to pick that tux and told him I would wear one if he said no then later picked it.  GRR.  So right after the prom, parma and I realize that we got our dates the same corsage.  That was bad.  Anyway at prom nothing much happened.  I didn't hang out with my date much.  I think she just needed someone tall enough to do the grand march with (I'm 6'4").  So I danced with other girls from a school I don't go to.  It was a blast though.  They played "Numb" and there was a mosh!  Moshes are fun.  I went golfing the next day.  Okay, we got a new puppy a week ago...  And my sisters piano recital is coming up again.  The fun never stops.  More to come.  Out, creeps.

      Walmart hates you.  If you're a skateboarder.    I was toolin around on my board on my way to Wal mart.  So I get there to pick a few things up and this lady that stands by the door to hand out carts and puts those little Wal-mart happy-face stickers on little kids tells me that I have to leave my skateboard with her while I shop. Hah.  My immediate thought is she must be in a drug-induced stupor.  So I'm like "I have to leave my board with you?"  She's says "Yes, it's Wal*mart policy.  I keep all of the boards here."  "I want a receipt." I say.  She suddenly gets mad and says "I've been keeping you kids' damn skateboards here for years."  This I believe, that's why I asked for a receipt.  It's like she never met a skateboarder smart enough to ask for a receipt before.  I mean, how am I supposed to know if she doesn't have some sort of racquet where she steals skateboards and gives them away or sells them?  So she immediately turns around and starts putting way too many walmart stickers on these little toddlers.  I stand there for about two minutes in disbelief.  So she writes me a receipt. I go get my stuff and to my amazement it's still there when I get back.  Anyway I'm just a little steamed about this.  The moral is:  Wal Mart hates you if you ever take a skateboard in there.  You're a second class citizen if you skateboard.  So, either this lady is lying through her teeth or WalMart hates skateboarders.  Grrr.

      So yesterday I went clothes shopping.  Got some DC and some jeans and stuff.  Then after I was done shopping, I went to the skatepark with Jaq and his friend, Brown.  It was really too crowded to do anything fun.  That's my life, I'm gonna go skateboard.

      Our new puppy is stupid.  I'd give you some examples, but I'd probably have PETA on my butt in no time.  If they read this blog.  Oh well, I'll give some anyway.  She's a collie so, it isn't entirely her fault, but she tries to herd the bigger dogs (two of them).  Well needless to say, the big dogs don't like this.  Why'd I say that?? I don't know, I just said it was needless.  I'm soo stupid.  Then other times she'll jump off this step with grass under it and she'll land on her head and do a flip.  No coordination at all.  Our other dogs when they were puppies weren't like this at all.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  We had the weirdest pizza last night.  It had huge crust.  The pizza was half crust.   And with the cheese and sauce, it looked like a very large, infected boil.  Yeah....  Whatnot.

      I'm listening to Dare You to Move by Switchfoot.  I get the weirdest (well probably not the weirdest, but weird) deja vu when I hear this song.  It's downright scary.  I really think I heard it or a song like it a few years ago.  Maybe it played while I fell asleep or something and so now I think I've heard it a long time ago.  Good song though.  I've been doing the  urlLink blogshares  thing lately.  It's going pretty well.  I bought some shares in  urlLink The Pool House  and then someone came and bought the rest of the stock which made me a lot of money.  My net worth, with all my other stock, is about B$ 8,000.  I'm pleased since I haven't really done anything.  I wish I had $8,000 in real money that would be sweet.  I'm off to watch 10.5.  -----------------------------------  A pen becomes a clarion.                  -Longfellow  What's a clarion???

      Well, I'm certainly weirded out.  Apparently someone likes my blog enough that they wanna drink it.  Why you'd want to drink moose drool is beyond me...  But you can go to Alaska and find a moose...whatever.  Of course it might be one of my friends messing with me... I don't think so though.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, check the comment on my last post.  Yeah...  Moosen Drool...  What else??  Well, I'm going to my friends graduation in a week, that'll be fun.  I think I'm seriously messing up my blog on blogshares.com.  It's way too overpriced so no one will touch it...not like anyone would before...

      I play the piano while I skateboard...got ya.  I'm learning all the notes and stuff on the piano so I'll know what they sound like when I start guitar.  The only problem is trying to get a guitar. Once I have that figured out it will be smooth sailing.  Skateboardings been a lot of fun since I've gotten my new shoes.  I think the shoes are going to cost someone a lot of money since I've torn up that board more in a week than in six months before the shoes.  That's it. Go skateboard.

      I just wanted to give a heads up to my peeps out there that like games.  Check out  urlLink Scorched Earth 3D .  Very cool freeware game worth paying for (I wouldn't, but that's because I'm rather against spending money unless you have some which I don't).  And at only 19 mb it's mind-blowingly cool.  You have a position on a map and you have a stationary tank. Tank choices range from a ATST walker from Star Wars to Kenny from South Park with a gun.  You then adjust your trajectory and power and try to shoot other tanks.  You get money for winning, and you can buy better weapons and such.  Very cool, go check it out.

      I watched House of Sand and Fog last night.  It's the kind of movie you wish you would have seen in theatres--until you see it.  Actually, I jest.  I liked it.  I think they could have done a better job on one point though.  They didn't make you feel bad for Jennifer Connelly enough.  I just saw her as an irresponsible loser who should have taken care of things better.  And I just saw Ben Kingsley's side of the story almost throughout the movie.  So here's the basic high-points.  SPOILERS!  Jennifer Connelly is evicted from her house.  One of the Shah of Iran's Colonels has escaped Iran (this movie takes place sometime in the 80s) and is living in a San Fran hotel Penthouse.  He has some money in savings.  He works two jobs--one on a road construction crew the other the graveyard shift at a gas station.  How he can afford this isn't explained.  Maybe credit cards or something.  He goes and buys Jennifer Connelly's foreclosed house.  He moves in.  Jennifer Connelly gets upset, goes there a couple of times, causes some trouble.  She eventually gets so upset she decides to commit suicide in her old driveway.  She can't because there's no bullets.  She gets taken in the house by the people that bought her house and then takes a bottle of pills, then vomits them up. Yikes.  So then Ben Kingsley's son gets shot when Jennifer Connelly's Boyfriend takes Ben Kingsley and his son hostage so he will give the house back.  So Ben Kingsley is so upset that he can't tell his wife so he decides it's easier to just kill her with poisoned tea.  So he does that. Puts her on the bed then gets dressed in his uniform and tapes a bag over his head.  He dies too.  So Jennifer Connelly goes back to the house and finds them.  The last scene is her being asked if it was her house by a police officer. She says "No."  I didn't explain why I liked movies like this.  The reason is that they make me realize how good my life is.  My life is really, really good.

      I've decided that I don't spend enough time in thoughtful contemplation anymore.  Where's my brevity--the soul of wit??  My wit is souless, it just keeps going it's not brief.  It's long.  Really, really long.  Whatever happened to Chipper the Squirrel and the handy bathroom foot stool?  Who watched the Survivor finale?  Show of hands.  You--in Seattle--you don't count pending the restraining order.  I don't know what to say about the finale.  I still think Rupert should have won--and hopefully he'll get the second million.  Well, yesterday was quite fun.  My sister's piano recital was yesterday.  That wasn't the fun part.  Honestly this audience is the jumpiest one I've ever had.  It's the only one I've ever had.  Splat!  More zingers like those coming.  But I got to ride in my friend's new Pontiac Trans Am.  He was able to do 100 mph easily.  He broke loose in third gear. Sheesh.  Excellent sound system, 12 CD changer.  Then I went back to his house and played catch.  We soo bad.  We have to get a game going.  That's about it.  Scotty McHotty signing off.  And yes, I did steal that name, it was too good to pass up.

      Okay folks, who here has gotten that annoying letter about going without gasoline for a day.  Ha.  Well, I have a different version here...  I'll post the high points (at least the points where I could easily reverse the meanings).  Oh and the views expressed in this email do not necessarily represent the views of the this blog, it's owner, it's parent companies...blah, blah, blah.  GASOLINE GUZZLING DAY (WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 2004)  IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED BY THE TWO YEAR ACCOUNTANT THAT I KEEP IN MY BASEMENT THAT IF EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND DID NOT PURCHASE A DROP OF GASOLINE FOR ONE DAY AND ALL AT THE SAME TIME, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THEN KICK RHODE ISLAND OUT OF THE UNION. WHO-HOO MORE GAS FOR US!!  AND WE WON'T HAVE THE WUSSY STATE WITH US NO MORE!  TO THE 49 STATES OF AMERICA!  WHAT DO WE NEED THEM FOR??  THEY AREN'T EVEN AN ISLAND!  THEREFORE MAY 19TH HAS BEEN FORMALLY DECLARED BY THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST PARTY AS "STICK IT TO...WHOEVER IS MAKING THIS GASOLINE THINGIE'S PRICE SO...(what's that word I'm lookin' fer darla? oh. that's right.) HIGH!" DAY AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND SHOULD NOT BUY A SINGLE DROP OF GASOLINE THAT DAY.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT A DROP OF GASOLINE WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $0.002.  SO THERE!  THE ONLY WAY THIS CAN BE DONE IS IF YOU FORWARD THIS E-MAIL TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN AND AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN TO GET THE WORD OUT.  WE WANT RHODE ISLAND OUT!  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REDUCTION AND CONTROL IN PRICES THAT THE ARAB NATIONS PROMISED TWO WEEKS AGO?  WHAT HAPPENED TO A FREE MARKET??  WHAT HAPPENED TO DRILLING IN THE ALASKAN WILDERNESS??  REMEMBER ONE THING, NOT ONLY IS THE PRICE OF GASOLINE INCREDIBLY LOW BUT AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE ARE BITCHING ABOUT IT!  WE CAN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF THEY DON'T GET THE MESSAGE AFTER ONE DAY, WE WILL RENDER OURSELVES INTO FUEL!  THAT'LL SHOW 'EM!  SO DO YOUR PART AND SPREAD THE WORD. FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW. MARK YOUR CALENDARS AND MAKE MAY 19TH A DAY THAT THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES SAY "GIVE ME A GASOLINE INJECTION!"  Audioslave has a really good song called gasoline.  Anyway I'm gonna go get a gasoline injection.  Yeehaw.

      So I'm just gonna make something up.  So everything that follows is completely fake.  So that's it.  I'm just gonna improvise.  So I'm cruising along in my Mitsubishi Eclipse.  Just joy riding.  That's it, I'm joy riding.  So I have a couple of friends with me--who should they be?  Well I can't have all my friends with me... I'll just randomly pick names.  Jake and Bo.  Heh, Jake and Bo.  So we're listening to, uh, In Da Club by 50 cent.  Yeah...  So I get pulled over for joy riding.  So the officer gets up to the window.  He's a really big guy..300 lbs or so.  He has a handle-bar moustache stained by years of tobacco chewing.  How the tobacco juice got over the top of his lip into his moustache is beyond me.  Though let's just say that he often goes to trick tobacco spitting contests and his trick is to spit his tobacco juice into his moustache.  So it turns out he didn't pull me over to ticket me, he pulled me over to join our joy riding party...yeah...  So we let him in since he is an officer and we don't want to get him angry enough to give us a ticket for angering a peace officer.  Don't want that.  There's heavy fines for that.  So we start driving again.  We drive along having a good ol' time.  Turns out that the police officer actually does go to trick tobacco spitting contests.  Go figure.  And then out of no where a huge thirty point buck comes out of no where.  That sentence was intentional.  He lowers his head and readies for impact....  TO BE CONTINUED...

      Apparently I'm not the only "Moose" person that has people wanting to drink my "drool."  Which is odd.  I bet there's some weird faction out there that just goes around to moose blogs and asks to drink their drool.  Hey, whatever.  It's all good, but don't expect me to join any moose drool drinkers faction thingy.  So the other dude who's had this happen to him is some guy named "Moose."  Odd coincidence, eh?  You can check out his fledgling blog here urlLink Dao of Moose .  Ooh, pretty hyperlink.  Go check out my fellow moose's blog.  Oh and no one calls me moose.  "My friends call me buffalo."  "Why's that?"  "Don't know."  Lol.  Until someone else comments about drinking moose drool, or I have something to blog about--out.

I spent most of the day playing a football game with some friends and playing catch.  Nothing really happened.  It was just like any other get together with friends.  Oh well.  I still have a stomach ache from the food.  Or something.  Out.

      It always seems like I lose time for blogging a little while after I start again.  Okay, Memorial day weekend.  Saturday, I went to a small party.  Hung out with some friends. Stuff like that.  I then went out to eat with a buddy of mine.  I had Rocky Mountain Oysters.  Food for real men.  For those of you who don't know what rocky mountain oysters are (I would assume most don't) (squeamish don't read this) they are BULL TESTICLES!!  They slice them up, bread them, deepfat fry them, and serve them up with special sauce.  Uh....  Anyway, they are extremely good!  The kind of stuff you wish you could eat every day!  Yum.  BULL TESTICLES!!  Sunday I went to another party.  I then went to stay the night at a friend's house.  I know, I'm a little bit old for "slumber parties," but I had to in order to play a softball game the next day.  So I did that, played the game, which was fun, then went home.  I got driven back in T Dizzle's Trans Am.  We had to fuel up, so when I got out this guy was looking it over and he's like "You got an LS1 in that?"  Since it's not my car and I have no idea, I say "I don't know anything about this car man, this is just how I roll."  So then a girl that's sitting in the back asks "What did he ask you?"  And I say, as a joke, "Something about LSD." loud enough so that he could hear me.  I looked over at him expecting him to laugh or something, and he just stared at me like he had death in his eyes.  So I got back in the car quickly.  Well, that's what happened.

I also got three new cats.  They were named Fidel CATstro, MOUSE-olini, and CATfucious.  Pretty brilliant eh?  Well, I'm gonna go lie down.    Later creeps.

I got a job yesterday which  I'm happy about.  I've needed money for a long time.  It's a job as a farm hand and I start Monday.  It pays well too, at least compared to the $0 an hour I was making before.  XBOX, here I come...
