      Tonight. Was really. Interesting. And I don't really want to talk about it. And I probably won't want to talk about it with most of you for a real long time.    "They say time will make all this go away, but it's time that has taken my tomorrow's and turned them into yesterday's...it's so hard to do, but so easy to say..but sometimes, sometimes...you just have to walk away.." Ben Harper - Walk away  And I'm really sad. But it's not so much sad as it is shocked, because it's not like I didnt ask for it, and it's not like it was horrible, it's just. Not okay. But theres nothing I can do about it, and I do not regret it. I do not regret things.   It's just one of those things that you talk about like they dont matter and you never let it phase you, but once it happens it just so...not how you expected. Nothing like that ever turns out. But theres going to be lots more times, and I have my whole life ahead of me, so this one time shouldn't be so important. But it is. I feel so pathetic.   On the lighter side of things. Sean is a real nice guy. I like him alot. And I really kind of hope he likes me too under the given circumstances.   I'm going to do something else now. I really have nothing to say.

      WEll. Let me tell you how great I am. I'm not at all. Therefor I am unhappy. Then again. When am I not unhappy? Its not real nicwe waking up beside a 19 year old guy you know you're never going to have any emotional relationship with, and when your just so stupid that your biggest trouble is that I needed so desperatly to brush my teeth at that very moment. Because you know, thats definetly my biggest problem at that point. And also allow me to inform you that me and Troy have been divorced, but I suppose we never really had a relationship to begin with, and I knew damn well we never would. Thats just the sort of messes I get myself into. So I geuss all the pain im feeling right now because he dosnt want to be with me and it feels like he dosnt love me was all self-induced. I knew all along. And last night i've never cried so much in my life. And I dont even really know why I was crying because its not like I didnt know what he was going to say, but for some reaosn even if he had said nothing I would  have cried just as much, because thats just how pathetic I am.  And also allow me to inform you that Cam is a douche bag.  Why is it so hard for him to get off my back for even just five minutes?? He says he wnats to try harder to get along and then he says "Why havnt you helped me unpack my camping shit yet?!", or "Get off the phone I  need it." Atleast be kind enough to use some manners, as everyone so clearly forced upon us our whole life.  We went to the river yesterday. It was good clean fun. We took alot of pictures. Made alot of friends. And I'm very sorry Brandon and Christian for ditching you, as is Ashley sorry. We dont like to swim at the river. Bobby, we're sorry for finding new friends to replace you, haha. Anywyas, the rier was a hoot.  And I dont have a whole lot to say because me and Ashley are going to meet Chris at the Powell River Ferry really soon and I cant vent my whole anger when I'm so distracted...

      phosphorescence   1 : luminescence that is caused by the absorption of radiation at one wavelength followed by delayed reradiation at a different wavelength and that continues for a noticeable time after the incident radiation stops -- compare FLUORESCENCE 2 : an enduring luminescence without sensible heat  Stars in the water. Last night we swam in them. It was good. It was real good. The boys came. That was good too. They're real nice. They have a truck. Trucks are nice. So is theme song music haha. I don't really know what's going on with them. Nor do I know what to think. They either like us a lot. Or they really need to get laid. But either way is fine. Because if they like us a lot, well then, I guess we found ourselves some winners! And if they just want to get laid. Well then, that's what we assumed all along, nothing that hasn't happened to us before. Last night was really good though, we should probably start doing things like that more often. The whole truck thing really makes me smile. Because we can stand up at 12 am and say "Lets go to the beach" and actually make it happen, and not have to walk. I love phosphorescent. Its so pretty. And there were so many stars. But those stupid boys wouldn't swim too, which kind of made me sad. I also kinda find it sad that they may never talk to us again...but then again, maybe they will.  Hornby was nice. Its been a long time since I've actually been able to say I had fun. I didn't think I had the ability to do so anymore. We didn't meet any boys, and we didn't drink any alcohol. We wrecked our "liquor priviledges" on the way their because we slammed down Cam n' Doobs Rootbeer Screwdriver *I think that's what it was?* We read a lot. And we went boating. We got so tanned. Its good. We ate lots of popsicles. And Doob peed in the ocean. That was very, very cool. At the time I really hated it there, and I wanted to leave, but looking back I can say I did have fun. Which is something. I'm happy.  Troy came online last night. I was watching a movie with Brandon and Christian. I was so sad when he left. He's never online anymore. It kinda makes me feel bad for myself. He dosn't even email me anymore. That makes me feel just as bad. Either he's kinda fading like I though, or he's just really disappointed. But I suppose anything he's feeling was induced by me. So really its my fault and I have no reason to complain.  I hope they don't fall asleep on the drive home. That would really upset me. And I don't know why I think about these things but I just do.  Sean is nineteen. That's kind of odd. Its strange that he's four years older than me. Not a bad strange. Just strange.  I'm so tired. Must sleep now.

      I have a new hate. Hornby. Hornby Island BC. I used to love it there. I looked forward to it so much. Now I loathe it. You can only take the stench of the outhouse scent. It starts to invade your life, you cant run from it, nor can you hide. Its out to get me. I don't like camping when I don't have a friend. I don't like it all. The boy I have stalked for the past three years it there. He's cute. And he's also growing increasingly older. Soon he will be old, and he'll move away. And he wont go on family camping trips anymore. Everything there is growing older, and fading await. Everything I used to look forward to is gone, and everything that's left is fading. When I talk to people there it feels so distant. Like I'm talking into a receiver and no ones on the other end. Because that's all that's there anyways. Because anyone who is there is so far away, and they don't care. Its like they don't exist. Because they too, have faded away. Ben was there for the first night. He left the next day after dinner. We went kayaking. It was kind of fun. I was happy to talk to Ben for the first time since two summers ago. Hopefully we can continue our conversation next year. We had a water fight. We both got exceptionally wet. I like being wet. And because it was Ben who got me wet I didn't care. If it was anybody else I would have been pissed off. Ben's nice. He's really cute too. It was good to have a friend for one day. I got a nice tan. I guess it wasn't all that bad. I did a lot of thinking. I thought about Troy, and how one day before we're old we'll have a boat. We'll talked our boat and go somewhere far away; we'll a escape. That made me smile. Just thinking of him makes me smile. But it also makes me cry a lot. Because sometimes when I think about him I think about how much I'm missing out. I think about how I've screwed things up with one of the only people I could ever count on. And the only person I've ever loved like that. And that makes me cry. But I guess even if things don't work out I never really lost anything. Because just by knowing loved existed, even for just that short amount of time that I felt it, it allowed me to know that its real. So I guess everything's okay. We rented a boat today. I got to sit up front, not on the seat, but on the ledge. It was nice, listening to the waves crash. I didn't think about anything for awhile. Just the crashing of the waves. I couldn't see anything but ahead. I felt like I was flying. It was like for that 3 and a half hours I was escaping. And I loved it.  I talked to Peanut today. It gave me some reassurance of everything I've been doubting. I realized some things. About me. About him. About us. But not so much I realized some things, because if you asked me what they were I wouldn't know. Its one of those things you just know. Like you feel it. And I really don't know what I'm feeling. But its there. And its good.  I would like to thank Brandon Bird for being phone when I telephoned him while I was on Hornby. You prevented me from killing myself. Also. Thank you for being home a lot of times. You and I are tight. Tight like a Tiger.  I'm dying. I cant breathe. my skin seems to have litle bugs crawling beneath the surface. But I know they're not really there. I need another Aspirin. I need one real bad. I actually need several. I also need to go to the doctor. Real bad.  I'm going to Hornby again in the morning. I think I'm going to kill myself. But I guess if I get liquored up, and we pitch our tent in the bushes alone everything will be okay.  Peace, I loved you all so much. But Cam probably wont take me to a doctor. So if I die, its been real.

       Desolation    Pronunciation: "de-s&-'lA-sh&amp;n, "de-z&amp;-Function: noun1 : the action of desolating 2 a : GRIEF, SADNESS b : LONELINESS 3 : DEVASTATION, RUIN 4 : barren wasteland                 I'm here to inform everyone of my approaching death. Camping tomorrow. Leaving early. Ashleys not comming. I won't survive. You'll see. If I don't kill myself with the sharp shells on the beach, my being forced to use the outhouse will kill me. And if that doesn't get me, I can assure you that an over-dose of family will. The desolation will be too much for me to handle.     I miss Troy so much.     Might go swimming tonight. That could be interesting.    My blogger is finally working again. The happiness is almost unbearable.     On Saturday Ashley and I went and saw thee aunt. We got nice and loaded with our new Heliforks. It's like heaven wearing a Helifork. I don't think I will ever take mine off my sweet, sweet Helifork blessed body. It will rot before I take it off. After the arrival of the Helifork's we went to the show. "The Villiage". Such a funny movie. It's great what you can make out of a twelve dollar budget and a blind bitch. The skank one aisle down from us told us to shut up. It was rude. How could we restrain from laughing at something like that? It was too much. Last night we all went to the beach, good old quality time with the Fam. The torturous car ride there consisted of hick style 'rap' and CBC Radio, allowing my brain to slowly shut-down. We all argued most of the time. Its like a Steph and Ashley, Vs. Cam and Doob battle out there. So after awhile I went for a walk. The sun was going down so I went out to this little 'island' in the sand. It was peaceful until these flesh eating bugs started to devour my feet. So I fled.     Now I'm packing. Packing for my death. Preparation before entering hell is important. Wish me luck. I loved you all so much.

         Etymology: French, literally, sabbath, from Latin sabbatum: a midnight assembly of diabolists (as witches and sorcerers) held especially in medieval and Renaissance times to renew allegiance to the devil through mystic rites and orgies   Now. First off I would like to express how Brandon and my friendship is currently on Hiatus. I really do not appreciate the way he says I use him only for the purpose of having a QUOTE: Pillow to cry on END QUOTE If I really mean so little to him, maybe he should stop talking to me. If he honestly, in his mind beliefs all I do is use him and treat him like shit, maybe he should stop allowing me to walk all over him. Which I can assure you I do not. He meant a lot to me. But I have reason to belief I didn't mean a lot to him. So much for being "best friends". Maybe he should stop being so insecure, and actually try and get to know me, and me him, instead of sitting around and assuming how things are, because I can assure you it will not get you far.   I haven't talked to Peanut in so many days. I really wish he would come online. I miss him.   Last night we hung out with Garret. And Brandon. And James. But Brandon doesn't seem to think it counted, as we QUOTE: ignored him END QUOTE. But that's beside the point. It was an interesting night. We all went to the pool. Its been so long since I swam in the pool. We're hanging out with Garret again today.  Steven came over on Friday night. He hasn't called me since then. Same old.   I really miss Troy.  Must send him another email. I hope his steppe folder is almost at his goal amount. hehe.   I love him.  Also.  I'm sick of everyone thinking Ashley and I are whores.    1 : a woman who engages in sexual acts for money : PROSTITUTE; also : a promiscuous or immoral woman2 : a male who engages in sexual acts for money : a venal or unscrupulous person   People really shouldn't be so judgmental, and if they are to judge us they should really know the definition of the words they are using. I'm sick of everyone assuming things about me, and Ashley, and more so our friendship. When in truth, none of you even take the time to get to know us. Why cant you even try to get to know us? Is it that difficult for you? Or do you really dislike us that much?   You hate us because we are different. Would you like it better if we changed the way we are and were the same as all of you? Everyone always has a problem with the way we are, because we are different, they refuse to let us in on what they would like us to be, if you don't like the way we are maybe you should make yourself damn clear on how you want us to be, before you start trying to mold us.   You all totally contradict yourselves. Everyone of you always says that they respect individuals, and people who strive to be different, but yet when we do just that, you reject us, and you want us to be the same as everyone else. Stop trying to change who we are. This is us. If you don't like it maybe you should go and find some new friends. I don't need any of you to tell me how to be, I am happy being who I am. I do not need any of you; maybe you should all re-think your opinions and your judgmental views. Stop looking to other to please you, and relying on other to make your life okay and complete. With such high standards, you will never be complete and you will never be okay; I can assure you that one day you will realize that everyone is different. I can assure you that when your life catches up to you, no one will respect you, they will reject you, just like you did us. You will have spent all your Highschool years trying to conform to what you thought was "normal".   Highschool is only three years of your life. After Highschool is over, we'll be in University, driving our Porche, because we got out there and expressed our feelings and opinions, instead of conforming. And maybe I'll see you boarding the city transit system, on your way to your trailer trash life. Maybe you should start seeing through your own eyes, instead of everyone else's.   In closing, stop being so ignorant, and selfish, because its going to get you nowhere, and really everything you don't like about us, is exactly what you are. You are selfish, and have no regards anyone else. You are opinionated, and more so stupid.

      From my last blog until now I have became I rather happy person again. Last night was...uhh..words can't describe what last night was. Although, I can assure you, it was definently 'interesting'. First off, Cam, Doob, Ashley and I had an extremely 'heated' discussion on sex. The result: being allowed to go to Hornby alone for a week. Hehe. Excellent. Also. Swirnoff, and Kahlua mixed make you extreamly "intoxicated". Don't ever try and talk to anyone when you're under these circumstances. It will get you abso0lutly friggen nowhere, except closer to the dirrty suicidal edge; as Ashley and I have clearly learned. Last night was like an emotional rollercoaster. A rollercoaster with lots of yelling. And numorous threats of an ended friendship. Good times. As the night progressed I managed to throw up several times. That is never something happy. I thought I was gonna puke up my stomach. And while on topic; My stomach is falling out of my belly button hole. So say goodbye, as I can assure you I will be croaking shortly.  ...And then she sunrise came. Causing Ashley and I to become extreamly spontanious. Lighting candles in her back yard...the result: intersting photograghs. Caleb was extreamly helpful in this venture-very good tips. We'll hire you real good when we're famous...doing..what we did.  Today we're going to the parade. Steven is comming over. Although I'm sure he will call and say he can't come anymore. And then me and Ashley are going to the fireworks. Maybe Ashley and I will win a golden prize...or a black prize-a very, very, African-American-Prince-Shaped-Prize.  I highly doubt it. But one can only hope.

      This has got to be one of the worst weeks of my life. And the funny thing is I dont even know why. Other than a few minor things that went wrong..theres really nothing "horrible" that happened...depending on what your idea of "horrible" is. But for some reaosn I cant stop crying and maybe in a few days you will see Ashley and I hanging from 17th. St. Bridge with a rope around our necks. Thats what I'm kind of in the mood for.. although honestly, at this point I dont even fucking care. Because I know that I'm just being stupid like I always am, and its the same bullshit that everyone has to listen to about me every day. So I'm not even gonna start.  On Friday night I jumped off 5th. St. Bridge. Allowing me to realize just how easy it would be...*thumbs down*  On Saturday me n' Ash went to Nautical Days. Bobby Sang. We met a black boy. Too afraid to talk to him. We blew our chance with our African American Prince.  Were supposed to go see Steven yesterday. Didnt work out..The bus system is full of uneducated FOOLS.  Today I had to go to the doctor, because my belly button infection is out of hand. They gave me some good stuff. Mmm good stuff.  Now I'm waiting untill I can call Steven, which I can now, but I'm not going to because I'm procrastinating..  Everythings so screwed up.  I'm not even okay anymore..  Maybe if I didnt have the tendancy to screw everything up things would be better, but I dont think thats really something i can do right now, because the only thing I really want to do is sleep. Sleep and get drunk. That would be so great. Maybe if Cam didnt find that note I wrote to Troy things might be less awkward. But I highly doubt it. But its not even bad that he found it. Other than now he has one more reason to think I'm a whore. And I don't really want him to think that of me right now.  I might be alot happier if Troy lived here, and if Steven would call me, and if other boys would notice something more to me than my chest. But they arnt going to stop. Because honestly, right now I cant think of anything worth noticing about me. Im a selfish immature whore. And no one really want to pay attention to that...
