      Well today is my Friday, sorta. I have off tomorrow so that is good, I can get some rest. These new 12 hour shifts at work are a little tiring, but they pay off, cause we have a 3 day weekend every other weekend. I will just be glad to lay around and accomplish nothing but laziness tomorrow. Though there are several productive things I could be doing, staying home helps me to save money. Seeing as whenever I go out I end up spending some amount of money I should have saved.  I will most likely lay around and write some in my book. I have been flooded with ideas lately so I am going to take advantage of it.  /End Blog for now.

      OK this is a very touchy subject for me and at some point I reach this point where I have to vent, and since other people can do it so publicly then why can't I.  Why war you ask? There are plenty of reasons sadly enough many think that this war is merely a distraction. I can further you more on that, it is not. I worked in the military, in a field where I handled and decoded much knowledge of what exactly America is in threat of, and why persay there is this war. No I can not speak of what I knew then and the knowledge that I obtained from my training and the job I did for my entire military career. But I will tell you this, threats on our freedom? You bet your little ass there are some threats. I can guaran-damn-tee it!  You can call me all the names you want. You can put me in the category in which you put all the other self-righteous, dimwitted, deluded fools. But know this as I speak from experience: Our VERY NATIONS LIBERTY IS AT STAKE HERE!   Lets see about under imminent threat of nukes, oh wait~EVERY DAMN DAY. Every day we are in danger of losing our freedom. Maybe not right away, but why not break us down bit by bit, city by city, friend to family member. Slowly but surely bring the great nation to her knees.  There is yes a hairy and not so attractive maggot that DID pose a very serious threat to this nation. You weren't there, you are the general public here is a secret, there is ALOT the friggin "general public" does NOT know. Oh and probably for your own damn good, as I can only imagine the sick state of panic you would all be in if you really knew. Does this maggot pose a threat to us anymore, him personally no, his contacts and pupils, you better damn well believe it.  Then there are those of you who say we should not support those that protect our freedom, that we should protect our nation from our own assfucks that govern her. News flash, I don't see in office. You should fit right in as some of them can relate, I will agree there are a few government officials that could pull their head out of their asses. I wont argue with you there.  Oh and those soldiers that would be put to death for treason had they choose not to take part in the war, here's another news flash: When you sign up, you expect it. Wether it benefits America or not, its what we do. We fight for freedom, America's above all else, but freedom is why we give our very lives. Think about it, from the past to the present, without America where in the hell would the world be? No really answer me it might actually humor me.  Am I saying that I am right on all aspects of this post, no. Am I making a point, maybe. But we are all graced with the ability to voice our freedom of speech, something else we defend might I remind you. So this is what I have to say to all those of you who simply look for every friggin damn excuse to bitch, whine and spit about how shitty a descion this war is, its my 2 cents of freedom of speech. Take it how you want it.  If Uncle Sam called me tomorrow off inactive status I would gladly go, because I know what I would be fighting for. I guess its a different side of the tracks and maybe that is why our views are different.   Do I think it's time to bring our troops home, YES. But there is obviously a reason why they are not coming home, and I bet it is for a worthy cause.  /Rant off  Bonnie Rae

      Well hello bloggers! Today is Sunday the second day of the three day weekend that everyone has but I am working all three days, lovely! Course it pays off because next weekend I will have a 4 day weekend! WOOT! And my mother and little sister are coming to visit so there will be many funfilled things planned I am sure!  Its funny because on my way to work I can think of so many things to blog about, but once I sit down in front of the PC my mind goes blank. Anyhoo I did get an email from a very good friend of mine today~ Woot YAY Ryan! I haven't talked to him in gosh months so I was very excited to see that he had sent me an email. /Wave Ryan~ He is one of my old Everquest buddies. I haven't been able to play Everquest in like a year, but I will have my apartment soon in which I will be able to pull my poor boxed up pc out of its hibernation state and actually put it to good use again. YAY! Course then I am sure I will have some pc problem that I can't fix myself and I will have to call the "God of PC fixitness" Shane (my bestest friend way over in California) to have him walk me through trouble shooting. /Hugs Shane. What would I do without you!  I haven't been able to write lately in either of my books, it really bites but I always go through these phases. Some days pass and its an endless reel of writers blockage, then all of a sudden something will pop in my head and I cant get the words on paper fast enough. I prefer to write all my works by hand first, then transpose them over to type. I am weird, I feel like writing comes from the heart and soul, I feel more connected to the piece knowing that it came straight from within me and released on paper. I have always thought, "The true writer/author is the one with the ink stained hands", but that's me. I know that there are very talented writers that only type, I guess it is what ever floats your boat. =D  I will close for now, may be back later~ I leave you with a simple question though, ask yourself......  Does change set you free?  I heard that in a song today and it really made me think, how bout you?  Bonnie Rae

      Hello all! I am Bonnie Rae, I am 24 years old and reside in central Florida. I am originally from California around the San Diego area. I served 4 years in the US Air Force and was stationed at Biloxi, MS the entire time. Sad thing is I actually joined the military to travel, but I stayed at the same base my entire first term and it was really well boring to say the least. Don't get me wrong my job was exciting but Mississippi was rather a bit of a culture shock compared to busy California! My whole family moved to Florida so when I got out I moved here as well.  Right now I currently work as a police dispatcher, which is rather interesting. It is definitely something different everyday! It also gives me an insight as to what police officers go through and how they handle situations. In the spring of 2005 I plan on going through the police academy, and hope to become a K9 cop with in a couple of years. Though all this may change as I have just recently switched my major in college to International Business. My life long dream is to travel the world, exciting!  I am a avid writer and love all things fantasy based. I am currently working on two novels, one of which is a series. Will I ever get them published, I have no idea. I also love poetry and write daily in my personal journal!  that's all I will bore you with at the moment as all this will be in my profile! Looking forward to blogging with the best of ya!

      My Lifetime Love, My One True Friend By: Bonnie Rae  She laid her head upon his chest. A lifetime of mortal love, undying passion now comes to rest.  He holds her closer to him, Watches the wind unsettle her golden hair. Embracing a lifetime, Letting go just doesn’t seem fair.  The first time they touched was all on fates chance. Taking his rough hands, she led him in their first dance.  That captivating smile, Embedded in his mind. That comforting laugh Emerald eyes so kind.  A lifetime ago they pledged their love and a kiss, under the willow tree. He holds back stinging tears, for now he must set her, his truest love, free.  Her breaths now grow quieter still. His heart breaks for she makes it whole. How can he live without her? Who now will have his soul?  “We were meant for each other,” he whispers soft. “Not in this lifetime my darling love,” she weakly replies. Tears fall from his eyes and he holds her dear. “I’ve always loved you,” he finally cries.  She lastly speaks, “Do not weep my love for we shall meet again, This is only one lifetime and surely not the end.”  You never say goodbye, But I’ll see you again. You were my lifetime love, You are my forever one true friend.  This poem was inspired by two characters in one of my novels I am diligently working on finishing. Just thought I would share with you all!  Bonnie Rae

      My dearest friend, 	I don’t even know how to begin, to tell you the tale of my aching heart. The treachery that in lies my web tangled soul. You came to me at a very hard time in my life, and somehow helped me to see a light. But I tossed you away like cold trash in the morning light. I was a fool, and we have gotten past that; or so it seems. But I still sit all my days and wonder why I can’t explain what you mean to me, not even to my own self. You know every inch of my soul, every beat of my heart. You have my laugh memorized and would be able to find my smile in a sea of transparent illusions of human beings. You whisper to me in the wind even though you are so far away, always there when life seems so hard. Black tears fall endlessly, not even waterproof mascara can hide this pain. I lay and stare at the velvet night, so many stars. The moon witnesses my endless tortured tears; I can only wonder if the moon can understand. Wrapped in the dark of midnight, swallowed up by my own confusion or maybe it’s an inner madness I shall never beat. I don’t think I am crazy, nor does the moon. I think I just can’t understand why my heart beats so heavily for you. Its not fear, or I would come running free. It’s not remembrance of others, or there would be no reason for this letter at all. It’s just simply unexplainable at this moment to all and especially me. Have you always been with me? In all my lives? Is that why I feel so close to you, so connect straight in my soul? You are innocents in me that is pure and real, that I know because that much I can feel; with heart and soul. Forgive me for this letter, but I have no other ways to express this confusion of my mind. No way to outlet the stinging tears that feel like newly sharpened knives. You are what you are to me, and at least every time I think of you a smile. At least I have that little blissful piece to keep me going. I sigh as I truly do not even know how to end this letter, this plea, and again wonder how did it even start?  Always with love Me

      Scorn  Something fathoming From deep within Something burrowing Wrapped in sin  Taking over my body Controlling me Entangled in deadly vines Eyes pierced, I cannot see  Blood falls, deep crimson From a reopened wound Fed toxic poison, vile From his “silver” spoon   Now I lie dying, slow and raw Skinned pierced by sour thorns When I am reborn, remember still The horrible wrath, of a woman’s scorn  Bonnie Rae  Just thought I would share. Dont know where it came from the words just flowed into my head.

      I am off soon for my three day weekend, YAY. Though I am broke and will be doing nothing but renting movies and working on my book! But before I go I leave you with this. Do you remember your first love? After reading a novel by Nicholas Sparks, I thought I would quote one of his writings:  "The first time you fall in love, it changes your life forever and no matter how hard you try the feeling never goes away. Your first love, no matter what you do, stays with you forever." (Nicholas Sparks, Author)  That could not be more true!  Bonnie Rae

      I am so tired today! I am working the day shift and I only received 4 hours of real sleep last night! Due to the fact that I was in pain half the night.  Well my doctors appointment went, ok. Course I am left with antibiotics and of course no pain medicine that I can take while working, dang it. So believe it or not I am sitting here at work with a heating pad, is that pathetic or what. Anyhoo what can one do?  Lets see, not much else has been going on. Just taking it easy as the doctor ordered. This weekend is my 3 day weekend so I am excited about that, in which I will be doing more resting I am sure. YAY for getting to sleep in, ALOT. Even though I sleep in like everyday cause I am not do for work until 2pm each  day, but still. Sleeping in and not having to get up and go anywhere is a lot better~ trust me!  Bonnie Rae

      The air is warm and saturated with the smell of newly cooked bread, banana perhaps. Tall blades of grass glide amongst my legs as the plush earth caresses my bare toes. There are no prickles or thorns amongst this ground, so I am free to roam with naked feet. No worries, only the love for life. An endless summer day in the perfect world, of this dream. Running freely to the shore, racing the seagulls in their epic flight. Pausing only momentarily to collect a shell or two. Dress wet now from playing in the emerald ocean, suddenly I realize I am not alone. The white mare, again now for the fourth day, comes to pay me a visit. She keeps her distance but acknowledges that I am there. She is my friend and I hers. We have an unspoken bond, both curious but unafraid. I watch her frolic to and fro from the waves and up the sand salted banks of the pearl white shore. I bid her good day as I have now for this fourth time, just as the last, leaving her some carrots atop the same rock as the days before. Running free so fulfilled, nothing here is vacant in me. Racing the wind I tumble to the soft ground, the grass catches me. Laughing I look to the sky, so blue, I can’t stop smiling.

      I know I haven't updated in a few days, forgive me. I have been dealing with alot and working on top of it. But I am off tomorrow so hopefully I can get some rest!  My mother and little sister have gone back home, so I was saddened some by that. But we had a blast while they were here!  Life seems to pummel on. As do many things within my life, but lately I have been feeling as if I am standing back watching my life take place without me. Its wierd I know, but to me it makes perfect sense.   La de da~  Bonnie Rae

      Tonight and the Rest of My Life By: Nina Gordon  Down to the earth I fell with dripping wings Heavy things wont fly And the sky might catch on fire And burn the axis of the world thats why I prefer a sunless sky To the glittering and stinging in my eyes And I feel so light This is all I want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Gleaming in the dark sea Im as light as air floating there breathlessly When the dream dissolves I open up my eyes I realize that Everything is shoreless sea A weightlessness is passing over me  This is a wonderful song, and it is how I am feeling at the moment. Such is life, I guess. I was off for four days back to work today then off two more. This week is a breeze or so one would think. I am happy because my mom and my little sister are visiting, and we have had a blast. But my mom can tell I seem worried about something. I guess moms know best. I just have a lot of complicated things going on right now and sometimes life can seem so bleak. I tend to live worrying about making other people happy always sacrificing my own happiness. I hide it well I guess but sometimes I really am falling apart at the seams.  Both my best friends live tons of miles away from me. I try to talk to my boyfriend and sometimes he really is comforting. I know I have a ton of family and friends that love me, but why do I feel so damn empty, so alone. I guess that is a famous question asked by many, one that can never truly be answered. For one can only answer their own questions, those questions that haunt us day in and day out in our soul all the days of our lives.  I guess that is when faith steps in, I feel the need to pray. I will be the first to admit I am not as into my faith and religion as one should be, but I believe in the Lord. Sometimes he is the bestest friend one can have. I also can feel Brandon's presence around me, he is caressing me with his warm spirit.  Some people go through life and never know true love, I have loved and felt true love. Its the one blessing I am forever thankful for...  Bonnie Rae

      Wooot! Today is FRIDAY! TGIF!!! And I am off for FOUR DAYS! SO excited, can't you tell?  Ok so there is this song that I love, by Evanesence, of course. Because they are the best, which on that note I am excited because I get to see them in concert July 27, 2004, so sweet! OK but anyhoo~ So there is this song by them that I just love and it reminds me of two characters in my book and their undying friendship, William and Erina. They are my most favorite story line out of all the storylines that I write, maybe because I have a friendship similar to theirs. In tribute to them and the friendship that I have I want to share this song's words with you!  Will you forgive me again. I don't know what I said, but I didn't mean to hurt you. I heard the words come out. I felt that I would die, it hurt me so much to hurt you.  Then you noticed me. You're not shouting anymore, you're silently broken. I'd give anything now, to kill those words for you. Each time I say something I regret, I cry, I don't want to lose you. But somehow I know that you will never leave me.  Because you were made for me. Somehow I'll make you see, how happy you make me. I can't live this life without you by my side. I need you to survive. So stay with me.  You look into my eyes and I am screaming inside that, I'm sorry.  Song By -Evanesence-  Could they be anymore talented? What a beautiful song and so beautifully written, you can feel the passion in it. Fits the mood I am in, and the friendships I talked of earlier. You know who you are ;P!  I think this is a good way to end the week and take off for a great FOUR day weekend! Blog ya later loves!  Bonnie Rae

      So I have been sitting around yesterday and today just thinking. I keep asking myself what it is that would truly make me happy career wise, and I have always wanted to do something where I make a difference in this world. What I would love to do is be a zoologist, and travel the world studying and educating people on Big Cats. But the rest of my college tution for that is way to expensive and seems so far out of reach.  So hence the wanting to become a K9 police officer, I still get to work with animals and make a difference. But my dream is to study aboard in Africa, and aren't we told all our lives to do the best that we can to fullfill our dreams? I am 24 now, I am getting old, not fast but it is happening. I dont want to run out of time on my dreams and I have yet to feel that I have fullfilled any of them. You just know when something is your calling, because it calls out to you the minute you see it. Everytime I see a big cat, whether in a zoo, magazine or tv~ I get that feeling in the pit of my stomach. That jolt from my soul. I know this might sound pretty lame, but its true. And its how I am feeling at the moment.  What does one do? The practical? Or take whatever leap and bound to catch the dream? What would you do?  ~Bonnie Rae~

       Well, we put Jeff's cat to sleep today. It was sad and I really felt bad for him, but it was really for the best. We buried him in the backyard in a really nice spot in the garden area. Jeff said he wanted him buried there cause I guess that is where they have some of Jeff's mom's things. Course we didn't plan on hitting every damn root from every damn tree in the yard, but with patience and a really nice axe (yes we actually had to axe the shit out of some of those damn roots) we buried Maxwell. He lived a long and happy 17 years of life, and is certianly in a better place then all of us now.      Anyhoo after that whole deal I went back to bed and slept for about another 5 hours, since I only got about 3 hours sleep last night.      The slut biznitch never called back, so we are guessing whatever she wanted can't be that imporant. Jeff is getting the number changed Monday - good thing too!      Anyhoo I think I will venture to the kitchen and see if I have any cheez it's left. They were Jeff's but I kinda took them over and told him to go and get his own damn box! *evil grin*      ~Bonnie Rae~

       I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ALL MEN SUCK! With the exception of the slight few that actually exist and give a shit about what women feel (which is like almost an extinct animal at this point).  Anyhoo so I am sitting at work - doing what I do there, working. And my cell phone rings so naturally because we are not busy I answer it. Low and F***ing behold it is this same slut ass two bit hoe that has called the cell before asking for my boyfriend. Now, yes I use his phone, and I know he has not talked to this girl in well over a year. BUT - still it pisses me off. This is the same slut that called us at 2am one morning in fact waking us both from sleep. And anyone who knows me KNOWS that for me to fall asleep and actually stay asleep is a rare thing, so you can imagine how pissed I was. I asked him to please (as long as I am using the phone) to get the number changed, so I no longer would have to deal with stuff like this and he agreed. Course he never did it, laziness on his part. Laziness on my part for not making sure he followed through with getting the number changed but I since thought that this problem was solved and would not have to hear from this hooch again. That was until I so innocently answered the phone earlier this evening, innocents was shattered and in stepped my fiery Irish temper.  I was calm to her (for the most part, an extreme effort on my part - my lip was probably on the verge of bleeding from biting down on it so damn hard) but held a mature "F*** YOU" kind of attitude so she would get the point! She addressed she was just an old friend, YA RIGHT, to which I informed her I knew better. She then said I had nothing to worry about cause she was engaged. Now lets think about this ladies....  I KNOW I HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT YOU SLUT BIZNITCH BECAUSE HE IS WITH ME AND NOT YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE NOTHING BUT PLAIN ASS TO HIM, YEP THAT'S IT PLAIN I NEED TO GET OFF QUICK PIECE OF ASS! I know this for it has been confirmed, by even my best friend who knew him back when she worked with him when he mention this c*nt slut.  Now, I know that I am slightly contradicting myself through my anger, by stating that I am not worried. Now what I mean by that is,  I am not worried . I do not worry that she is any threat to me. And I trust Jeff, but as I discussed with a friend earlier (while venting I should say) it's women that can't be trusted. This hoe called once at 2am, you don't call some one at 2am (especially when you were merely that to him, a HOE) just to say "hey". Can we say BOOTY CALL. So there ya have it, she is a slut ass hoe that can't be trusted. You women out there that have had similar situations know what I am talking about. Oh and what "engaged" woman calls another mans (one she used to sleep with) cell phone? How dumb is this bitch!?!  Anyhow now that I have vented - I feel somewhat better. I told this bitch she can call back on the cell tomorrow when Jeff is with me (in a polite manner) and gave him one and only one option:  "You tell her when she calls you have no need to converse with her or have contact with her anymore what so ever. That you are involved with some one and would appreciate it if she never again tried to contact you."  If he can not do that well then I told him I would just pack my shit and be out! I don't need this B.S.  La de f***ing da!  /Rant off /Vent over  ~Bonnie Rae~

       Sooo Jeff's cat is like on the verge of death and he is tearing himself up about whether or not he wants to put him to sleep. I hate that he has to make such a hard choice but something needs to be done. This cat is 17 years old and Jeff's mother got him the cat, so I can see where he is emotionally attached to this cat - in a sense another way he holds on to the memory of his mother. It is an active memory, alive; and to lose it will only make him feel as though he is losing another piece of what little "live" memories he has of his mother. I can't imagine losing my mother so I can't feel his pain. I can only stand on the side lines and watch him get tackled by his endless pain. He is dealing with his mother's death much more healthier now then he ever has, but I ache for him. When you love some one so much you yearn to take their pain from them. No matter how much it hurts, on top of all your other pain; you want theirs as well. He means so much to me.     &nbsp;   Tomorrow is another day -     &nbsp;   ~Bonnie Rae~

       Well life goes on, whether we are ready to accept certain things or not. The past 6 months have been and up and down non stop hell of a ride rollercoaster.&nbsp; I have been staying at Jeff's alot more lately, which is something I like. I like being with him, falling asleep next to him, having tell me he loves me first thing in the morning. But on the downside I have his family drama to deal with. Which lately has been less with his dad being away visiting his girlfriend, but his grandmother is a non stop deal. She lives in the apartment attached to the house and though a very nice old woman, she is very needy and I think her needs have been overlooked for sometime. But with everything going on in my life at the moment it is hard to have to deal with her  every  day. I like her and love that she see's me as some one who cares, but dang! I need to be able to breathe!     &nbsp;  Well I am off to get ready for work. I am sure if I have some time I will post more later!    &nbsp;  Bonnie Rae

      I had a muse this eve! Hope you like:   &nbsp;  Drifter  By: Bonnie Rae   Visitor amongst the shadows  Silent friend, you come and you go  You never hang about long  Just enough to reassure and know   Drifter amongst the soul  Come and stay awhile  Sit at this mad tea party  It just might make you smile.   Come and drink some tea, let’s talk.  We are just evil racing thoughts  ~Yes you have those too  We are childhood fears and forgotten what nots.   You do not visit us enough  Let us toy within your mind  Let us weaken the lasting strength  Break down that empty swine.   We come to you in the dark of night  Interrupt peaceful dreams  Awaken you with frigid sweat  Ultimately never letting you be.   If you would just stay awhile  Take an unforgiving chance  Look us in the eye, and;  Amongst the shadows dance.   You will see we are not so bad  So stop trying to push us past  Live within yourself  Make this change forever last.   &nbsp;   ~Bonnie Rae~

Soooo lets see, yesterday was Jeff's 21st Birthday - YAY Jeff! Course I was to damn sick to even celebrate with him, but he know's I love him.  Good thing is I get off work at 10pm this evening (woot only an hour to go) and I will be going straight home and crawling in bed, with my Mooshu (my kitty cat).  Already then - Blog ya later!

      The title of this blog is that of a song a very good and special friend of mine introduced me to. In just listening to it, I remember times we spent together and goofy things we've said and done. I remember the love we shared for one another and the angry end that we were dealt.   It is funny how at one moment of the day you can be in your own dark place. Then one person just makes the darkness all fall away, without even trying! I am sitting here with a smile I can't seem to wipe from my face, and it feels so good. He came into my life like a shooting star graces the night's velvet sky, entering quickly but everlasting in my memory; from the beauty that encompasses his free spirit and soul. I didn't realize how much I missed him until this evening and I am so glad I got to once again here his voice!   I am so glad for him and that he came into my life when he did. I am glad I was allowed to get close to him and I am glad he taught me how to laugh again. He is a special part of me, we had something very unique and still do. We both want more then this world has to offer and we both refuse to settle for less. It's a common ground we share and to one another souly understand.   There was this time after my divorce (which was hell and we won't get into) that I went to visit him. I will never forget he took me to this park, and it was so beautiful. We played around like two little kids free from the imprisoned chains of school on an eternal trip into the perfect summer with &nbsp;an endless&nbsp;playground. I was at peace, far away from my normal hectic hell I live in, I was at peace. I felt free and not a worry in the world. As humans I think we all look for that feeling at some time or another in our lives, but rarely do we ever find it. I was lucky to have felt it, and feel it still every time I am reminded of him, talk to him or simply just get an email from him. He is so real to me and what we had was real, it was true and for the first time in a long time&nbsp;I felt as if I was living. I say  was  as if he is in past tense to me, but that is so wrong. For after talking to him again this evening I realized that he is real, we are real.   I could go on and on, but I will close with this, words from the song he introduced me to, a song I feel we very much relate to. Thank you, for being you and for finding me and showing me all that you do. I look forward to this friendship, hey ya never know ;-)   "I was thinking its a sign, that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images.  And when we kissed they perfectly aligned.  And I have to speculate that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay.  And true, it may seem like a stretch, but its thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you are away and I am missing you to death.   They will see us waving from such great heights.  "Come down," they will say.  But everything looks perfect from far away.  "Come down now."  But we'll stay. " &nbsp;~Lyrics by Postal Service~   That song makes so much sense, cause we kinda have always had our "own little world" that other people just don't understand. I guess the important thing is that we understand it.   Life is short, but it is even shorter if you never choose to live  in  it.   ~Bonnie Rae~   &nbsp;

         What is life? Do any of us really know? Subdued by this monotoned reality, walking effortlessly in this paradox of a suffocating world. What the hell propels us to keep moving? Is it because we are forced to? We have no other choice but to wake up and face yet another day? Have you ever just been driving along listening to whatever music fancies you at the time and suddenly just thought "What the hell am I doing?" Everything that you attempt to grasp as making sense falls swiftly away and&nbsp; you are left feeling emptier then the day before.   I had one of these moments today on my way to work. I was listening to a CD that a friend made me, one I favor because it is one of my lasting memories of us. But I was listening to it and I watched as two beautiful white birds flew past me, almost as if in slow motion. Like something you see out of the movies. I felt tears swell in my eyes but they never fell. I thought for a brief moment maybe it was a sign, but then struggled to analyze in what kind of sign. I have pretty much given up on those things. I have an intuition like no other, but fight to ignore it. I am blessed with a sense that most are not, and though as a child it scared me, I have grown to appreciated it as an adult. But in the recent years I have slowly taught myself to black it out, push it away. I have seen things, I have seen truth but somewhere along the way I have lost faith. Faith in all that ever made me feel safe.   Maybe I put myself in my own darkness. No, but I choose to continuously revisit it. I don't know how I can feel safe there being surrounded by such emptiness? Maybe it is not safety I feel, maybe this darkness is all I know.&nbsp;Maybe it is not a safety blanket but a velvet cloak of&nbsp;vacant shadows that I am wearing. I have known this feeling and not in just this life. Above all I have always known this feeling.   I miss him for he was very much a part of me, but I pushed him far away; just like the ones before. I am shrouded in a mystery that even I can not cut through. I have stopped trying to figure out how to step out of this fog, for it is eternal. I have realized that it is not an object to overcome, it is in me. It is who I was, who I am and who I will always be.&nbsp; If you can't accept me, you were never ment to; that much has been written amongst the stars. But if you get it, who I am, then you are a part of me; eternally.&nbsp;   *~Bonnie Rae~*

       Let me just start with 'yawn'!!!! It's 0338 am and I am sitting at work hopelessly watching the clock. I am working 7pm to 7am shift, covering for another coworker. I hate the all nighter shift, cause around 3am my body thinks that it is time to go to bed, since that is when I am normally crawling into my bed from my own shift! Bring on the COFFEE! If I round it off, only 3 more hours to go!!!!!! Oh but it seems so far away! Then when I get home, the cable guy is due at the house between 8am and 10am to get my pc online! All I am gonna want to do when I get home is SLEEP! Not deal with cable connections and all that garb!     &nbsp;   This week alone is hectic for me! I work 4 days straight instead of the normal, 2 on 2 off. I am working 2 of those nights as 7pm to 7am, then the other two are my normal hours but I am still going to be tired as hell, cause when I am supposed to be sleeping I will be awake and vice versa! My body&nbsp;schedule is going to be totally off balance this week! But I have Friday and Saturday off so I can go out of town, that will be nice!     &nbsp;   Jeff and I have to take his dad to the airport this Friday, he will be going out of town to WI to visit&nbsp;his girlfriend for about a month! It will be kinda nice cause Jeff and I will have the house to ourselves for that long, and it will be good to see how we get along. Good test for when we get a place, or should I say "if" and "when" we get our place. But anyhoo we have to drop him off at Orlando International, so we are going to just stay the night in good old Orlando. And since Jeff turns 21 this Wednesday, we are going to celebrate then; since I have to work all night the night of his b-day!     &nbsp;   I am looking forward to this weekend. It's always nice to get out of town, even if it is only for 1 night. We love to play miniature golf in Orlando, they have some really kick butt neat courses!&nbsp; I should be getting my digital camera soon, hence I will finally be able to post some pics!     &nbsp;   Well I have to go and get another HUGE cup of COFFEE! Only 3 more hours to go, I CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!     &nbsp;   ~Bonnie Rae~

         Well another doctors appointment has come and gone and still there is no positive answers I have been given. I am tired of shrugged shoulders and confused looks. I am human, and I am real - I can see you and hear you talking about me and all the tests; stop acting as if I am not in the room!      &nbsp;   Today is my Friday then I am off for 3 days - YAY! But next week I have one hell of a schedule!&nbsp; We (Jeff and I) are supposed to go to the springs this weekend and go canoeing with some of our friends. I am not one for paddling in a canoe, but I am game to get some sun and swim in the springs! As long as their are no alligators - those things suck! *shivers at the thought*     &nbsp;   I am excited to get to go see Nikki this October! I really miss her alot - we have been best friends for so many years now - and living in different states really sucks! I miss big spending at the mall, beach hopping in the "maro", Los Tres Amigos (only the best mexican food restaurant in the world), Pina Coladas and Corona's poolside then zzzzzz's. Gosh so many memories! OMG and who can forget&nbsp;Shmad and "Danger&nbsp;Zone"!!!&nbsp;The best friend I will forever have - I would do anything for ya sis!&nbsp; Looking forward to seeing ya!!!     &nbsp;   ~Bonnie Rae~     &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Well our Evanesence tickets came yesterday - I am stoked about that! Now all I have to do is wait till the 27th then its off to the concert!  I will be off for a few days - more doctors appointments tomorrow, really not looking forward to it. I just wish they would figure out what's wrong already, and if there is something wrong - can it be fixed!  I am tired today and in slight pain. The pain comes and goes, the medicine doesn't really help so I just have to tolerate it. But I am looking forward to going home and getting what little sleep I can before my appointment tomorrow. I am more looking forward to after the appointment when I can just close the door and rest, without being bothered - or having to answer all sorts of questions. Ahh sleep my favorite pastime!  Whatever darkness be laid in front of me, let there be light in the deepest depth of thy soul. Let it fight when I have given up, and let it be victorious!  Bonnie Rae

      Faith By: Bonnie Rae  Waiting for the heavens On this rainy day For the angels to descend And kiss this hurt away  In this mist that binds me Shadows swirling fast Lost souls linger about decaying  I can’t remember the first sin from the last  I tripped and I have fallen Upon this earth rotted ground The smell of death is putrid and copious Please angels let me be found  I didn’t mean to come here I’ve somehow lost my way Please hear my prayers and save me Don’t chastise me to forever stay  The vapors of death have consumed me My eyes, I can’t fight to stay awake My body is now lethargic My soul is feeble and willing to break  A soft whisper in my dead ear, “Awake my child and play amongst the stars Let the clouds caress you and release you from hell’s bars”  I can hear virtuous music From somewhere deep within It’s then I realize the realm of heaven Has saved me and released me from my sin.  Have faith

      So I have been off the past two days and in that time frame I have done alot of thinking. The one thing I think I have finally come to realize is that love finds you when you least expect. And that love can be in many forms, and is never perfect. If love was perfect then life would be boring.  In the past two months I have been back and forth with doctors and still not knowing if I can ever naturally have children, which is a huge damper on things. I have lost a good friend of mine, or some one whom I thought was a good friend of mine. He so kindly informed me he could no longer be my friend, how lovely and what great timing might I add. I have internally been dealing with my real father and his entire side of his family in the pressure of meeting my 9 year old half sister, whom knows nothing about me and I know nothing about her. That and I have not talked to my father since I was 3 years old. He never really gave a shits worth, and personally that is how I feel about him. Bitter anger, how lovely. Anyhoo - just shit I have been dealing with.   And in all this I have been in a new relationship, well not to new as we have been together now about 8 months. Not long but long enough to really start to get to know some one. I battle with alot of inner demons, many that cause me to have negative outlook's on relationships. But these past two days I realized that the prince charming I have always been looking for, might not be some white knight in shining armor that rides in and saves the day. He might be a common man with common thoughts, who is average in his own way. And it may be as simple as him grabbing your arm and not letting go of you, when he has realized what you and this relationship means to him. He isn't perfect and never will be, but he loves me and its as simple as looking in his eyes.  I have loved and I have lost. I have been scared and I have been torn to shreds, but only to be put back together again. Did he help fix it, yes. But the best thing he did was help me to allow me to fix it on my own. He may have helped me pick up some of the pieces, and find some of the ones that were lost; but he handed them over to me and let me fix them. He let me put them back together, there is no greater feeling then that. I still have a long way to go on my road to healing, as we all do. But I know now that perfect love doesn't exist, because real love you have to work at it and I am so glad I have learned that if you work hard enough it all pays off in the end. He might not be perfect, but neither am I. And I might get mad and scream and yell at him, but he is patient and wipes the tears when I am ready to cry. I am thankful for him and for what he doesn't even know that he has taught me.  Love does change us forever, and I would like to believe always for the better, because we are always learning from it!  Bonnie Rae

      Sooo yesterday I was all mad at my car because it was acting up on my way to work. Naturally when I learned it was supposed to rain and storm horribly I cracked a joke about maybe I would get lucky and a tree would land on my car and total it, thus then I could just get a new one. Well the tree didn't land on my car but two hours after I has made that comment a tree (a very large one at that) landed on my boyfriends car =/. I felt so bad for him since he LOVES his car.  luckily it did not total his car, just left very LARGE and DEEP scratches all over the car and some dents. Also broke the seal on his back window, all of witch can be fixed. It was his neighbors tree so her home owners insurance has to pay for what his auto insurance company won't. Needless to say he gets a nice brand new paint job out of the deal and doesn't have to pay any of his deductibles. Anyhoo it was a lesson in being careful for what one wishes for, or rather I should say jokes about.  Bonnie Rae

      What would you do if one of your bestest friends told you he felt more for you then just a friendship, and that he can no longer remain your friend because he can only have you all or nothing?     I have a best friend, whom I love beyond belief. He is one of the greatest friends I have ever had and the fear of losing him tears at me everyday. But I know how he feels for me and has felt, I try so hard to respect his feelings; as he does mine. But we live on the complete opposites of the USA, for one. I know "true love" knows no boundaries, but still. Now there is this issue that he can't just be my "friend" anymore, its tearing at him in and out everyday. I know what this means and it kills me. I don't know why I can't feel the same way on the same level with him, because he probably is my soulmate. HOW THE HELL DID WE WIND UP LIKE THIS!!! You are my best friend, you know me - every inch of my soul. I would do anything for you but now you are telling me you can't do it anymore.    Am I angry, no. Am I hurt? Of course. I love you, I always have, but I can't love you the way you love me. Believe me if I could I would not be sitting here at the moment. Do I want to lose you, hell no. But if I have to in order for you to be able to live happily every day for the rest of your life, I would make that ultimate sacrifice for you! You have sacrificed so much for me, and I know that. I know you don't want this, to have to let go and walk away from me. I know you, you don't want this. But I understand you when you say that if I can't return the love you long from me, you have to. I could never be angry with you, but I will not lie and say that this doesn't hurt. Its like being told you are dead, only to learn you are alive and I can't ever speak to you, to share your life with you again.    You said you have never had to act so brash in selfishness like this before, and I know. But you were my friend, my best friend. You weren't some made up being, you were real. You were real to me. And now I don't have you anymore, or at least left with the feeling because I don't feel for you what you feel for me on a romantic level. It hurts to love some one, and to especially to love some one from afar - I know this. But trust me when I say it hurts more to lose them, when you could have always had them somehow in your life. I loved and I lost, God did not take him from me, God only called him home; and I still sit to this day after all these years and wonder if he knew how much I loved and cared for him! I walked away from him, because when you love some one sometimes you have to let them go. If I would have know he was going to die a week later I would have never ever walked away. But we can't tell the future, that's why we live to take risks.    I understand what you have to do and why, my beloved friend, but know that walking away is harder then remaining. Because you are forever filled with wonder and what if's, and only God knows when you will see or hear from that person again. I know this because I live it everyday of my life. I only warn you because I wouldn't wish this torment on anyone. You've never loved if you've never lost. If I have to lose you I will forever be pained, but know that if you ever need me I will forever be here for you. No matter when and no matter what. I will never cut myself away from another friend again, because I would rather have you in my life then to not have you at all. You do what you have to my sweet friend, but know I am always here.

        Fall from Grace By: Bonnie Rae  I found my old ballet shoes Amongst boxes of aged dust Comforting was their site Again for dance, my feet did lust  So melancholy is this day For bloodstains I can not wash away.  Lost in a sea of infinite doubt Tormented by memories of you Confused as of why I love Hands that cause this black and blue.  Echoed piano music hauntingly plays along, As my feet and body whimsically sing this song.  Out in the rain I purge my sin Flanking the edge of an empty pool Dancing silent the with closed eyes Never remembering that I’m a fool.  Little melodies in my head Remembrances of things you said.  The rain beats down upon my skin I am soaked, sodden with a day’s grief But I feel no more pain, no more strife. This happiness from my dance I know is brief.  No one can touch me; I am as light as air. Dancing endlessly; free and with out a care.  Wind and rain now thrashing upon me, Tree branches blow viciously past. I care not, for I am not on this earth I am dancing amongst the stars at last.  “Come back down”, I hear you say, “Please don’t throw this all away.”  Alas I never knew the plight I took I just wanted the dance to take me away From this hopeless life, and all the pain But you caught me and alas begged me to stay  Blonde hair now crimson, blood stained is my skirt of sheer lace. I am sorry love, I must have hit my head; dying instantly as I fell from grace.             I have no idea where this stuff comes from! But alas I share it with you, the world! Enjoy~      Bonnie Rae

       At some point in all our lives, we realize we have a calling. Mine came to me at a very young age when I was a child. I knew, I have always known what I wanted to do. But life isn't perfect and sometimes you don't get to take the path you wish you could, for various reasons! This is why I have not fulfilled my dream, for all those "various" reasons. And then you fall into that slump of, "well I have put it off for so long and so much has happened, I just don't know that it is possible anymore."   Remember that saying: "Where there is a will, there is a way"?   Well that saying was renewed in me this evening while working. I don't know how I am going to get the ball rolling, but I am going to start researching what I am going to need to do, and equipment that I might need.      I must remember that my soul and my spirit are to free to ever be tied down. Some one told me once that I was living a pipe dream - and that none of what I wanted would ever happen. News flash for you - Up until now I realized I haven't been living at all. I have surrendered to what life has given me, but life gives so much more once you open your eyes. No longer will I choose to live blind when I was blessed with the ability of sight. This day I step out of the shadows, this day my life begins anew. This day my spirit and my soul are once again set free...      The path that I have chosen is a hard one. Relationships will have strain because of it, but if the persons involved can withstand it, then so be it. If they can not, as hard as it is I am sorry but I have to spread my wings and fly. I have always searched for love, when deep down I have always known that my "true love" would be my work, my calling. All other love would be emotional and the test of times.      I know what I want. I don't know that it will happen, but I have to be fair to myself and at least try. It's not like me to give up so easily, and I was foolish to just surrender. Here I am world - brace yourself for here I come!      I shall see you always my darling, for our souls forever dance amongst the stars; as our spirits fleet around with world indulging in our dreams. Today I am thankful, moreso then the days before.      Dreams can come true, but at a price. You shall gain and you shall sacrifice, for dreams are hard work!      ~Bonnie Rae~

       I will not make this a plea~      But I have to ask...   Now that you are without me, all complete contact as you asked; are you happy? Because I miss you miserably. I know that you have gone away, but I can still feel you. And I know that you can still feel me. How is this doing either of our souls justice?      ...I just had to ask, though I am sure I will receive no response. I won't allow myself to stop loving you, no matter how far you turn from me; you taught me that remember. You were the only one that could open my eyes and I bet you didn't even know you did. I love you.      Bonnie Rae

       ***NO OFFENSE TO THOSE WHO ARE MORMON***      oK! I am content and comfortable in my Catholic faith! If you knock on my door, I tell you this and then you still try to push you "Book of Mormon" on me, you are gonna get a door slammed in your face. I am sorry, I am not trying to offend anyone by any means; but those damn people have alot of damn nerve! People ***HATE**** it when you knock on their doors and try to push you religion! So STOP DOINING IT! And please if you are going to percede, then at least pay attention to the "NO SOLICITING" sign. It will save you door slam in the face!      /Rant off~      Bonnie Rae

       I am just a normal girl, well depends on what your definition of normal is~      I am standing still as the world explodes behind me, but I do not flinch! I hold my ground and clench my fists. I shout out and end it in laughter. The world crashes down and I slip away to play amongst Jupiter. I watch the planets realign but decide dancing amongst the stars is alot more fun!      Back in reality, Oh darn. I am just a girl, I love to chew my bubble gum and wear sandals. I hate McDonald's (yes it is true, by lack of choice I will result in eating there but ewww), but can't live without Taco Bell. I love to wear blue mascara and paint my toenails. I am 24, but I still love my video games!      I write poetry and other works. It is my serenity, just like my evening or morning run (depends on when I work). I am a peacemaker, but a drama queen just the same. I love to fall in love and give it all I got! A hopeless romantic is in my bloodline! I hate spiders and love kitty cats! Mooshu my Siamese is evil to everyone but me, he is my bestest little guy!      I am just a girl at heart, a woman if you please.      I am complicated simplicity!!!!!      ~Bonnie Rae~

       I wrote this poem, inspired from my novel I am currently working on.       Seduction By: Bonnie Rae  Help me to step into something A world of enchanted bliss Seduce me with your stare Allure me with your kiss  Take me unto you Touch my soul so deep Whimsical is this dream Into my virgin mind you creep  Let me savor this lust That so many wildly speak Let me believe the pleasure That so many desirably seek.  Stroke my body delicately As if it were your last The ending of your tragedy Corrupt by your savage past.  Compel me into insanity With your rhythmic love Make me cry out endlessly To the saturated stars above  I am just a pawn for you But a desire none the less You have to ravage me My breasts ache for your caress  I am innocents for you Something lost long ago Within me is a fiery burning But this you already know  Help me to step into something A world of enchanted bliss Seduce me with your stare Allure me with your kiss……         Oh la la!!!!!      ~Bonnie Rae~

       Exile, endless exile is where I live. It's not so bad once you get used to it and once it takes over well then no one can touch you.      I live in a world of endless bullshit. From normal people right down to the sick and insane, this world is fucked up. Some how I have been able to see through the crime, rundown towns and bullshit filled people. Some where along the way I was given a gift, and it helps me to see the world still and clear. When it rains I see the sun. And when it is sunny, well then I can feel the thunder, frigid rain drops amongst my bones. But the axis this world spins on is small. I feel one day the world is just going to slip, and fade away to an unseen universe of endless black. I am going to laugh all the way there.      Before they were junkies, well they were innocents. Before there was fear there was contentment. Rare as it sounds it has happened. Before there was grass and trees of jade, there was only savage dirt. Before the end there was always a way of begining, but ulimately the end beats us. Its what we fear and it kills us slowly.      I am screaming inside so loud, but on the outside I have a quiet smile. You'll never see it coming. When I come crashing down, just like the world~      Think about it~      Bonnie Rae

       I read a fellow poets poem today - and it reminded me of my bastard of a father! How he abused both me and my mother.  Funny that even though I was only 4, I remember he held a shot gun to me and my mother and tried to kill us. It is because of him I hate the dark. She was the mother of his child, and his own child. How can you kill them - or even think it. Amazing what drugs do to some one. Can I forgive, I don't know. I have no pleasant memory of the man and as far as I am concerned at this moment I still desire no contact with him. He's changed my ass~ to bad he can't "change" my internal and external scars!!      /Rant off      ~Bonnie Rae~

       This is a song by Jessica Simpson, the words remind me of a very special friend I had.      "You Don't Have To Let Go"   I don't need your strength anymore cause you've made me strong   You may not see the woman in me    That you dreamed of holding me in you arms    All the days that you gave   All the moments you've saved me,   Praying for my life Sacrificed,   just to make me who I am on my own   You don't have to let go   You don't say it   But it's in your eyes   All the fears of good-bye   But I can promise   You'll always have a place, and a way to my heart   All the days that you gave   All the moments you've saved me,   Praying for my life   Sacrificed, just to make me who I am on my own   You don't have to let goI can live   Cause you lived for me   And I can love   Because you loved me.   All the days that you gave   All the moments you've saved me,   Praying for my life   Sacrificed, just to make me who I am on my own   You don't have to let go   ~Jessica Simpson~      I don't know if you read this blog anymore, but if you do well you know who you are, and I hope you know.

       TURN SIGNALS WERE PUT IN YOUR CAR FOR A REASON PEOPLE, USE THEM PLEASE!   I can not stress this enough people! Ever since I have moved to Florida I have noticed that down here I guess people are just all psychic or something. We should all just know what direction you are going to turn when you slam on your breaks with no damn warning only to come to a complete stop forcing me to come to a complete stop only to turn onto a street in which you had plenty of time to slow down to the proper speed and use your signal so I had some sense of warning. I just don't get it, people down here just don't think. ARG, anyhoo just a pet peeve of mine!      Bonnie Rae

       So today was not that bad of a day, or should I say yesterday seeing as even though I am still at work it is a new day. Anyhoo - the day was not that bad. Work was interesting when I first got here, but has it's dry moments as does any job. Later on in the evening a co-worker and friend of mine and I worked up a funny little "fake" news cast, mocking incidents that have happened here at work. It was funny as heck and we got a damn good laugh at it! It's amazing the crazy stuff one can come up with when you have to much time on your hands~      I have about 20 minutes left and I can feel it. I am tired and not looking forward to the drive home. I am hoping that when Jeff and I find a house, it is closer to where I work. Even if it just knocks off 30mins of the drive. We shall see, now that we are going to start looking for a house to rent we are going to be really picky. Not too picky, but we don't want some dump, ya know.    I haven't been able to work on my novel lately, do to all the dang drama and stress that I have had to deal with from Jeff's family. I am hoping that since I am going to be staying at my house for the next 2 days I can buckle down with my cd player and knock out some chapters.     And on the note of "drama and stress", I will be having lunch with Jeff's cousin Sarah on Thursday. We used to get along very well until Jeff moved out of her house and back into his dad's, then we just seemed to be testy towards one another. But we need to get it (whatever it is) out on the table and see about working through it, because we both love Jeff and he is important to both of us. I am his girlfriend (and the way he has hinted and talked the last 2 months, possibly fiance "maybe" around Christmas time) and she is his family - in order to get along I really think we need to get past all these differences we both feel is there. Who knows, I just hope we can come to a common ground so there are no awkward feelings when we are at family events. At least I am trying, I made the call - asked her to lunch and she accepted, which shows me she at least wants to attempt at fixing things.    Ok I am tired and need to put my cases in the book because if I forget again I think Larry will knock me upside the head with it.    ~Bonnie Rae~

       On one of the poetry forums I belong to we have a quotes section, one of the members posted this one and it just hit me slap in the face. It is so true, so very true..     "To make the right choices in life, you have to get in touch with your soul. To do this, you need to experience solitude, which most people are afraid of, because in the silence you hear the truth and know the solutions" Deepak Chopra    ~Bonnie Rae~

       Well today is another day. I woke up and realized that I had a ton of shit I have to do! Most of which I would have taken care of yesterday, but then we had to get the cat put to sleep and alas my life was again put on hold to service that of another. So now I have a ton of shit that I could have gotten done yesterday that HAS to get done today. Now I know it sounds selfish for me to say "my life was put on hold", cause the poor guy had to get his cat put down. OK but for most of you that know the situation. know that I give alot more in this relationship that I am in then the other party. And lately that has really been eating at me. Most of you would say, "well then change it," but it is not that easy.      I just got done reading a friend on mines blog and he had a really good point! Men are hard to change, they are very much set in their ways and getting them to change is like literally pulling their teeth. Boy when I read that I was saying "Amen" to myself! As much as Jeff changes with everyday, he seems to fall back to the same cycle - and allows me to pick up all the damn pieces for him. I usually find myself swallowing my anger or pain and not telling him when something is bothering me. Now this is not healthy. I should rely on him as much as he does me, but I just feel that compared to his problems mine pretty much amount to nothing. I do everything for him and he does so little for me. But that is partially my fault, because I have allowed him to act this way. So in reality most of my grief is my fault. Alas the endless circle of bullshit my life seems to be filled with!      I really dont want to do any of this crap I have to do today. I would rather go to the movies like I had planned with my friends, but with picking up a new schedule this week ~ I would really just like to get as much of it done as possible. SO later on I can relax (if that is at all possible) and get ready for the next couple of weeks.      I have come to the conclusion that I need to get a second job though, or find a  reliable  person for a roomate. Because relying on Jeff to get his shit together is just getting old. One minute it is one thing and then the next minute it is completely divergent. I love him and would rather live with him, but in reality I need to get back on my own and fast. So needless to say I will be stopping by my old work today to see if I can talk with my old manager. Not sure if there is a way I can work getting a second job, because my full time job is complicated when it comes to hours, but I have to try. I can't just keep living under other peoples roofs, its not who I am and its killing me!      Alrighty I am off to start the day of hecticism! More later I am sure!      ~Bonnie Rae~
