						   From New Yorker Magazine..I couldnt Agree More   A PRAYER by PAUL SIMMS Issue of 2004-07-05 Posted 2004-06-28 Lord? Please don’t let me die in a funny way.  Like being beaten to death with a shoe. Especially not my own shoe. And, if it absolutely has to be my own shoe, I’d rather not be wearing it at the time.   Or like choking on my own fist during a bar bet.  Perhaps I should clarify a little. I do know that I’m going to die someday. (Maybe soon! That’s Your call.) And I know there’s nothing funny about death—at least, that’s the current thinking from this side. I’m just asking to not die in a way that leads people who don’t know me to e-mail one another news items about my death. For instance:  Please don’t let me get so fat that paramedics have to come to my house and cut out a wall to remove me but then bang my head against a load-bearing pillar in the process, thus killing me.  Please don’t let me die on or near or—perhaps worst of all—because of a toilet. (This includes a urinal or a baseball-stadium-style urine trough, in addition to a standard commode.)  Please don’t let my death in any way involve one of those giant inflatable rats that union protesters put up outside non-union job sites. Or a blimp of any kind. Until I see some evidence to the contrary, I’m going to have to say that my dying because of just about anything inflatable would be something I’d rather avoid. A hot-air balloon, I guess, would be O.K., but only if I’m actually in the balloon at the time. At least that would be kind of rugged and outdoorsy. What I’m trying to say is: if someone else’s hot-air balloon falls out of the sky and smothers me while I’m lying in a hammock reading Hot Air Balloon Enthusiast magazine, I’m going to be a little pissed.  I apologize for that language, Lord, but I’m just trying to be honest with You.  A vehicular accident? Fine. Bring it on. I understand that, statistically, there’s a pretty good chance of that happening anyway. Just please don’t let it involve a moped. Or a go-kart.  Also, I’d prefer not to die in a head-on collision with someone who—against all odds—has the same name as me. Or anyone named, for instance, Roger Crash. Or Ed Oncollision. Or Jennifer Safedriver. I could go on, but I think You get the point.  I’m sure You get this one a lot, but: please don’t let me die during sex. Unless the technical cause of my death is a heart attack or a stroke. If I have to die during sex, please don’t make the cause of death any of the following: extreme dehydration, a previously undiagnosed allergy to fruit-scented or “massage” oils, dermatological complications arising from severe rug burn, or anything involving the use or misuse of any object best described as “foreign.”  Please don’t let me die in a way that allows the Post to run a small item about my death on page 12 or 13 or so under the headline “dude, where’s my corpse?” Or “dumb and deader.” Or “dead and deader.” Or “the house of sand and dead.” Or “j. lo’s latest nuptials postponed due to lethal tent-raising mishap.”  Please don’t let me cut my own head off while trying to revive the lost Scouting pastime of mumblety-peg.  I would have to consider any fatality involving a prolapsed anus, of course, absolutely beyond the pale. I mean, come on, Lord.  Also—and I’m not trying to split hairs with You, Lord—when I ask You to not let me die in a funny way, I also mean please don’t let me die in a noteworthily ironic way. Meaning: whether my death is “ha-ha” funny or the other kind of funny, neither of those is what I’m in the market for. For instance, please don’t let me go on a Sleepwalkers Anonymous Outward Bound-type retreat and sleepwalk into a canyon or gorge in the middle of the night.   And, if You deem it necessary (or just amusing) to take my mind before You take my body, let’s try to keep the progressive dementia noble and epically sad rather than comical. For example: please let the last face I recognize be the photograph of a long-lost high-school girlfriend and not one of the plucky toddlers from the animated show “Rugrats.” In my final moments, let me awaken—apparently lucid—in the pre-dawn hours calling out for a kiss on the forehead from a dead great-aunt rather than from the mustachioed black bartender on “The Love Boat.”  Or from the actor who played him, for that matter.  Even if I don’t die in a funny way, I’d still rather not die on the same day as some other person who does die in a funny way. Because I don’t want any version of the following conversation to occur between my friends:  Friend One: Did you read his obituary?  Friend Two: Yeah. Nice piece.  Friend One: Very nice.  Friend Two: He would have liked it.  Friend One: That he would have. That he would have.  (Awkward silence.)  Friend Two: Did you see that other obituary about the banana wholesaler who actually slipped on the—  Friend One: Yeah. You couldn’t make that up!    Well, that’s about it, Lord.  Actually—as long as I’ve got You, let me just mention a few final ways for me to die that may or may not seem funny to You, depending on Your sense of humor.  I would rather be burned beyond all recognition than burned almost beyond all recognition, especially if the pictures are going to end up on the Internet.  If some kind of rare organism eats away at my body from the inside, please let it be microscopic. Or just slightly larger than microscopic. Let’s put it this way: if it’s big enough to have a face, that would be too big.   Thank You for Your time, Lord.  (Also: Ted Lange. That’s the name of the actor who played the bartender on “The Love Boat” whose name I couldn’t remember before. I Googled him for You, Lord. Which has got to count for something, right?)

						      I was writing a letter to someone today and somehow went off on a tangent on my Theory of why Thelma weas the hottest chick on Scooby Doo. Here it is in it's full glory.  "I always thought Thelma was probably the sex pot of that show. I mean Daphne was just too into her own self to really get into it. You can't really picture Daphne getting dirty you know? And Fred? I think Fred might have some sexuality issues. I mean an Ascot? Really? All the guys I know who wear ascots are named Maurice and they are hair dressers in the Village get my point? Now I wont even get into the whole Scooby Shaggy dynamic that's left as a coefficient to the watcher. But Thelma.. I think under those knee socks and glasses and that nerdy exterior Thelma was probably a Nymphomaniac . I mean really all the Nerdy girls I've ever been with always perform 70-80% better then all the " Hot Chicks" I've been with so I think my theory might bear fruit."

						    Sandy began a job as an elementary school counselor and was eager to help. One day during recess she noticed a girl standing by herself on one side of a playing field while the rest of the kids enjoyed a game of soccer at the other.  Sandy approached and asked if she was all right.  The girl said she was.  A little while later, however, Sandy noticed the girl was in the same spot, still by herself.  Approaching again, Sandy offered, "Would you like me to be your friend?"  The girl hesitated, then said, "Okay," looking at the woman suspiciously.  Feeling she was making progress, Sandy then asked, "Why are you standing here all alone, little girl?"  "Because," said the child with great exasperation, "I'm the fucking goalie."

When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours." -- Stephen Roberts  4- "There are 10 kinds of people in this world, those that understand binary and those that don't."   5- Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most manage to pick themselves up and hurry along as if nothing had happened.  - Winston Churchill  6-Por favor mantenganse alejado de las puertas  7-"Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and good with ketchup."  8- "Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe." - Albert Einstein  9- One should try everything once, except inscest and folk-dancing.  10- Freedom  is the right to say "I Won't"  11- Bad Spellers of the World - Untie!!  12- Any resemblance between the views enclosed herein and those of my employer,my terminal, or the view out my window are purely coincidental. Any resemblance between the heretofore-mentioned views and my own views is non-deterministic by definition. Neither the validity of these views nor the existence of any sentient beings to hold them is asserted by this material, either implicitly or explicitly. The question of the existence of views in the absence of anyone to hold them is left as an exercise for the reader. The question of the existence of the reader is left as an exercise for the second god coefficient.

A discussion of non-orthogonal,non-integral polytheism is beyond the scope of this disclaimer. No purchase neccessary. Tax and titles extra. Use only as directed. Void where prohibited  13- "Don't be so humble, you're not that great". - Golda Meir    14- "Never argue with an idiot, they only drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience"  15- "Illinois Nazis. I hate Illinois Nazis." The Blues Brothers   16- Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum sonatur.

Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. - Calvin Coolidge   20- "Pimps have it all together. They do real well with women.    You never see two pimps at a party and one pimp saying to    the other, 'Go over there and talk to her, I think she likes    you.'"     21- "Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Give a man religion and he'll starve to death whilst praying for a fish."   22- "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction."         -E. F. Schumacher   23- "Worry is a circle of inefficient thought pivotting on a base of fear"   And one more so long that I'll never use it and don't want to bother with it so Tough Shit.

						   Here is an E-mail exchange between my boss and I. As I attempted to blame him for my Wardrobe Malfunction today.  >>> Mark Blei 06/09/04 02:53PM >>>  Jim:   I've thought this through and The reason I split my pants can be directly attributed to you.   1- Yesterday you instructed me to be more relaxed and lean back when making deals -    2- Today when closing a deal I as you directed both leaned back and relaxed   The leaning put tension on my pants and the actual relaxing caused me to relax my butt which is usually clinched causing the aforementioned split.   Since you have provided me with cover . I will not prosecute , however I strongly suggest you think through your suggestions next time as they can have dire physical consequences.   Sincerely, Mark L. Blei     Mark Blei  - Ass Crack Exposedl List Manager The XXXXXXX Network A service of XXXXXXXXXXX Worldwide XX XXXXXXX Avenue New York, NY 10010 212-XXX-XXXX mblei@XXX.com www.XXXXXX.xxx www.XXXXXXXXXXX.xxx Aim - MarkXXXXXX   >>> Jim XXXXX 06/09/04 03:13PM >>>  My take on this is slightly different.  I believe you should be thanking me.  You took my advice and closed a $6000 deal.  Minimum commission on that will be $180 at 6% of gross margin.  In the process you sacrificed a $30 pair of pants.  Net result, you gain $150.  I would make that trade everyday of the week. With that being the case, you can buy your pants in bulk and make your daily net gain even higher.  YOU WIN!   PS - the term you use:  my butt is usually clinched .......i think the phrase for that has a negative connotation, which is tight ass   Jim XXXXX - Manager The XXXXXXXX Network A service of XXXXXXXXXXXX Worldwide XX XXXXXXX Avenue New York, NY 10010 212-XXX-XXXX www.xxxxxxxx.xxx www.xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx

						   Remember the Gulf War? The original one, under Poppy Bush? Seventeen Americans remember it very well; they were US soldiers captured by Iraq, tortured, and threatened with death if they didn’t reveal American military secrets. Last year the former prisoners were filed suit under a 1996 law allowing terror-sponsoring governments to be sued for damages. They won, and a judge awarded them damages totalling nearly a billion dollars to be taken out of Iraqi assets.   The Bush administration, having frozen Iraq’s assets, has blocked the award, arguing that the money is needed for the Iraqi reconstruction. After all, “No amount of money can truly compensate these brave men and women for the suffering that they went through at the hands of a truly brutal regime,” says White House spokesman Scott McClellan. So might as well give them no amount of money, right?  urlLink  LINK

						   VIA&nbsp;  urlLink Things People Said     Yogi Berra's second claim to fame is for being one of the most quoted figures in the sports world. He is credited with coining the deceptively simplistic observation, "It ain't over till it's over." But he's also known for his flubs. Here is a collection of the most notorious of these.     &nbsp;   "This is like deja vu all over again."   "You can observe a lot just by watching."   "He must have made that before he died." --  Referring to a Steve McQueen movie.      "I want to thank you for making this day necessary." --  On Yogi Berra Appreciation Day in St. Louis in 1947.      "I'd find the fellow who lost it, and, if he was poor, I'd return it." --  When asked what he would do if he found a million dollars.      "Think! How the hell are you gonna think and hit at the same time?"   "You've got to be very careful if you don't know where you're going, because you might not get there."   "I knew I was going to take the wrong train, so I left early."   "If you don't know where you are going, you will wind up somewhere else."   "If you can't imitate him, don't copy him."   "You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."   "Baseball is 90% mental -- the other half is physical."   "It was impossible to get a conversation going; everybody was talking too much."   "Slump? I ain't in no slump. I just ain't hitting."   "A nickel isn't worth a dime today."   "Nobody goes there anymore; it's too crowded."   "It gets late early out there." --  Referring to the bad sun conditions in left field at the stadium.    "Glen Cove." --  Referring to Glenn Close on a movie review television show.    Once, Yogi's wife Carmen asked, "Yogi, you are from St. Louis, we live in New Jersey, and you played ball in New York. If you go before I do, where would you like me to have you buried?" Yogi replied, "Surprise me."  &nbsp;  "Do you mean now?" --  When asked for the time.    "I take a two hour nap, from one o'clock to four."   "If you come to a fork in the road, take it."   "You give 100 percent in the first half of the game, and if that isn't enough in the second half you give what's left."   "90% of the putts that are short don't go in."   "I made a wrong mistake."  "Texas has a lot of electrical votes." --  During an election campaign, after George Bush stated that Texas was important to the election.    "Thanks, you don't look so hot yourself." --  After being told he looked cool.    "I always thought that record would stand until it was broken."   "Yeah, but we're making great time!" --  In reply to "Hey Yogi, I think we're lost."    "If the fans don't come out to the ball park, you can't stop them."   "Why buy good luggage? You only use it when you travel."   "It's never happened in the World Series competition, and it still hasn't."   "How long have you known me, Jack? And you still don't know how to spell my name." --  Upon receiving a check from Jack Buck made out to "bearer."    "I'd say he's done more than that." --  When asked if first baseman Don Mattingly had exceeded expectations for the current season.      "The other teams could make trouble for us if they win."   "He can run anytime he wants. I'm giving him the red light." --  On the acquisition of fleet Ricky Henderson.      "I never blame myself when I'm not hitting. I just blame the bat, and if it keeps up, I change bats. After all, if I know it isn't my fault that I'm not hitting, how can I get mad at myself?"   "It ain't the heat; it's the humility."   "The towels were so thick there I could hardly close my suitcase."   "You should always go to other people's funerals; otherwise, they won't come to yours."   "I didn't really say everything I said
