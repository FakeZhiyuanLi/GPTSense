      syet kinakareer ko na papa jayr ko. gusto ko lang i-share ang mga kababalaghan na ginawa ko yesterday sa S.O.P. warning: mahaba ito. kung  may ginagawa kayo wag nyo muna ito basahin hehehe nanood kasi ako kahapon live kay JayR. kasama ko mga .. op kors.. mga taong nahuhumaling din sa kanya.    Ok.. i admit hands down.. im a certified groupie (God help me) ang haba nito. sobra hyper kasi ako ryt after. ang saya saya!   -----Original Message----- From: che Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 9:56 PM To: jayr_online@yahoogroups.com Subject: [jayr_online] SOP ver. che (super haba nito)   i had lots of fun today with my new friends from jayr_online (charing!) bagamat maraming kabagot bagot na nangyari.. i think what's important is what i feel at the end of the day. and i can say that, im very happy now. i have a feeling ang haba na naman nitong kwento ko. ang saya saya noh?! *tita glow accent*  nung nasa loob kami ng studio hindi masaya. masakit sa rear x_x halos 3 hours ba naman kami nakaupo sa wooden benches.. naanalyze ko na yata shape ng mga buto ko sa ahem butt sa tagal tagal namin nakaupo. tapos the whole time we were there di kami makalapit (like what jayson said) kasi pati ata fans ni jolina at angelika nagpapa autograph sa kanya. dinumog talaga! on the bright side.. nakakatuwa kasi nga mga kala namin di sya kilala.. lumalapit sa kanya.   anyways meron pa isa bad trip experience kami. nasa 3rd (or was it 4th) row kami na seat. by the way.. the studio was quite small and the audience seats were divided into 2. right side was for the fans (dun madalas tinututok ang camera) kasi kami ung maiingay, mapalakpak, at masigaw na people. then left side ung plain audience.. they're just there to watch the show. so op kors andun kami sa fans side. and we expect na mga kasama namin maiingay at magalawgaw coz theyre screaming for their favorite stars diba. eh may banner kami. ano ba ginagawa sa banner. diba kailangan itaas at makita? so ayun ginawa namin. tinaas namin! albeit di naman the whole show nakataas.. pero tinataas namin whenever we think the camera is focused on us so we can advertise the yahoo groups and JayR. eh syet! may mga @!@#$@#$!# mga lalake sa likod namin. tama ba namang sabihan "ibaba nyo yan!!! itapon ko yang streamer nyo e!"  chet. sinagot ko nga. sinagot ko talaga. sabi ko !@#!@$!@$ kayo! eh #$@#$@ naman e! %^#$@!~~!#!@*^@ #@$@# !@#!@! lolz jowk.. basta  sinagot ko...ayoko na idescribe ung buong sinabi ko.. baka mawala lalo "breeding" ko hehehhe *ayos buhok* Katakot nga eh. they were directly behind me and i was expecting to get a knife buried between my shoulder blades the whole time they were there. Good thing na lang umalis sila mga 30 mins before mag end ung show. buntong hininga kami ni ate fil (katabi ko kasi sya e.. kabulungan ko sa mga pinagagagawa nung mga taong un sa likod namin)  *nakikinig ako ng wave ngayon. narinig ko na naman si jayson. hmp di mo kami binati hehehe*  anyways..after that.. we were quite disappointed kasi hindi kanina ung launching of his new video "Bakit Pa Ba".. Si Nyoy Vollante pala ung Director's Cut. The balloon i was waving felt like it's a kilo heavier. My back and knees were as stiff as wood. I felt that my rear swelled 100x times its normal size sa sakit.  naisip ko na lang "uwi na tayo..." *buntong hininga* and we cant even get near him *buntong hininga ulit* we could hardly wait for the show to end.  *wait singit ulit... what? di alam ni jayr kung sino mga kapatid nya? heheheh! natawa ako dun ah. i remembered what jayson said kanina..makakalimutin nga si papa jayr. ....uy jayson favorite color ka pala nya bwahahahahaha! grabeh peborit ka tlga ni papa jayr. palakpak tenga! he's so bananasszszszsz*  balik sa kwento: So ayun.. uwi agad. Papicture kami at the studio one last time as a group. Uy post nyo un ha? we were holding the much publicized banner.. then uwi na. Lizzie went back inside to get her camera kasi it was confiscated by the guard. sinamahan ko sya and iniwan namin sila jayson tish and leslie hehehe! inikot namin ung loob.. looking for lizzie's cam. then nasa guard na kami.. dumaan si jayr. we thought he went home already kasi he wasnt among those sa last act ng SOP. imagine my surprise nung nakita ko sya sa likod ko! siko to death ko si lizzie nyahahaha! kapiranggot kong mata lumaki tlga.   sinundan namin nung nakuha na nya ung cam. mega text/call effect kami para di kami mukhang ewan na aaligid aligid kay jayr. then tong si jayson hindi makapasok para kausapin si papa jayr hmpp..kinapalan na namin ung peys namin at naghanap ng paraan para makausap sya. at first nagpapapansin kami sa personal assistant ni jayr.. si venus. wala pa isang metro ang layo namin sa kanila and kaharap ko si venus. bulong bulong pa ako "venus.. venus! venus..." we asked her kung san na si jayr pnta. eh hindi nya alam so we had to ask HIM talaga. he was right behind my back. ako kunwari may tinetext. nagtutulakan kami ni lizzie on who will talk to him para imeet ung ibang ppl from the group. so ayun naglakas loob na ako  "hi jayr... aalis ka na ba?"   oo daw eh. i told him kasi si jayson nasa labas. gsto sana sya makita. he was gracious enough to come out and meet us all. ang saya sya ng feeling ng naglalakad kami 2 ni lizzie tas sya nakasunod sa amin ahihihihi  *uy si lizzie tumawag nga ehehhehe! go sisssssss!! binati nga ako! nyahahaha! kelegzz!... langya jayson na naman tumawag.. batiin mo kami!! hehehe*  oops im distracted again. ayun basta napakiusapan namin si jayr na lumabas to see jayson. so mega chika kami lahat ever. at may pic na  rin ako at mega akap for picture. nakakatawa kasi may dumaan bus habang nag chichikahan kami. kaway si jayr. kaway din kai lahat..  feeling artista hahahaha!  hmm i do hope the pictures turns out ok at gawin ko wallpaper sa office hehehe! at nakapagpasign ulit si lizzie ng 2nd album nya (sis bow tlga ako sa iyo..kung nakalimutan pa ka nya eh.. ay sabagay mga kapatid nya nakalimutan nya name hehehe) tapos chika chika.. then bye bye..   hay bye bye papa jayr... feeling close na ako sa iyo lolz!  lessong learned. watching SOP live is not a good idea. but seeing JayR in the flesh is soooo peborit! oy ate fil, di ko peborit si Gabby! yak yak yakidakdak!  un lang... hep! un lang daw eh noh.. nobela na naman. sorry! i got carried away O_O  *HOY JAYSON GRABE KA ! 3 times!!! todo na toh!! tenkyu sa bati! hehehehe*  heto nakalap ko impormasyon:  5 brothers kuya mario kuya glen kuya gil kuya benjo kuya alvin twin 2 sisters ate jhing ate joy

      this is one post i made in jayr_online yahoogroups. lipat ko na lang dito in case i want to remember mga kababalaghan ginawa ko hahaha ____________________________ ako na ito:   hay naku leila.. sana nga andun ka. next time punta ka!! :D  ano pa ba kkwento ko about industry? actually wala ako masyado maalala. slytly tipsy ako and wala ako iba inisip kundi "nasan ang cr?"  *concentrate*  we got there mga around 10 (im with tish and joan) tapos we wanted to use up that 50 off jayr texted us through fantext kaso sabi sa saturday (kahapon) daw un magagamit kasi last day yesterday. not thursday.  wala pa masyado tao so tumambay muna kami dun sa lounge area. then dumaan si jayr. tameme kami dalawa ni joan. @_@ nakatingin lang at nakangiti. si tish lang an may lakas ng loob magsalita hehehe! so while they're talking, preho kami ng gaping expression ni joan. Diba sis? galing natin sa conversation noh? lolz!  Then after a while, we decided to position ourselves strategically for a better view of papa jayr. Dun kami sa harap.. sa tapat. as in IN YOUR FACE harap ng impromptu stage nila. Tapos dumating sila lizzie and friends. Tamang tama dumating din si papa jayr.  Eto si lizzie winner din sa pagpapakilala ng sarili. Tumayo sya.. nag hi kay JayR then beso beso at hug. Kami ni joan .. guess what. Gaping expression ulit, hehehe! We got to watch JayR and Jimmy practice and  list the songs they would play for a while then the party started. Tamang tama dumating si ate eliza all dressed up and nanlibre pa ng beer! tentyu sis!! *mwahmwahh*  i think i remember some of his songs: i got a girl, tongue ring, bakit pa ba, design for love and gameface. tapos meron b2k why i love you (his favorite song daw tlga!), keith martin - because of you(favorite ni tita geleen), r kelly/nivea - laundromat, usher - nice and slow, r kelly - ignition remix, stevie wonder - overjoyed, brian mcknight - one last cry, tsaka ung bounce bounce song. i forgot the rest. kasi 1: di ako familiar and 2: i was slightly out of my head.  Sometime in the middle of all that, we got the chance to be the focus of his attention.  He would stare on each one of us tapos kakantahan nya kami isa isa chetttt *kilig to death* tapos there was this one time (oops dami palang times) na sumasayaw sya sa harap namin bwahahahah. Eh mejo windang na ako nun. I was thinking "wow within arms reach na lang sya" Kahit ako nagulat nang makita ko nakapatong sa chest nya kamay ko bwahahahahaha!!! Gad what a riot!  Then what else.. nakita namin si brad turvey at greg turvey sa likod namin.  We managed to get a picture with brad kasi mejo makapal na mukha ko. Inisleng sleng ko pa ng pilipit lolz! Si Tish yung kumuha ng pic i think. Off center noh? Bakit kaya tish? lolz! Ok lang at least nakita ako *wink*  The pic where he was pointing at me happened right after that tats sa dibdib incident. Now that i think about it.. isip ko siguro narecognize nya ako. Siguro sabi nya "bad girl ka.. nananantsing! tsk tsk" lolz  We got to meet cherryanne din. Pano mo kami nakilala sis? masyado ba halata na yahoogroups members kami? hehehe! Then after 33 or so songs (he repeated 2 songs kasi raw naputol sa recording) he finally had his break. Hay naku mga sisters and brothers.. i tell you. It's better for you to hear him live kasi dun mo maaapreciate ung voice nya (even if you're drunk ganda pa rin ng boses nya)  What else.. hmm ... after that.. lizzie left na. tama ba sis? itong si lizzie nakabeso beso na naman si papa jayr. bow ako seyo sis! lolz! kami ni joan urong sulong sa paglapit. si te eliza at tish lapit ng lapit! sugod mode everytime! *samba* hay nakow te eliza.. if know. sino ba tlga nilalapitan mo? hehehe!  Before we went home, nakakuha rin kami ng chance (at lakas ng loob) magpa-sign ng autograph at magpapicture.  Si cherryanne mega chika. Ako tameme ulit.  Pero winner naman picture namin ni joan hihihi! Pagkakalat ko ito.. shemay *sigh*  Kahit na di nya maalala name ko.. there was this one night that i was held by JayR *sigh ulit*  We dawdled around after we said goodbye to Jayr (kiss nya kami sa cheek tsaka hug *sigh*) kasi baka may mangyari pa. I was with tish and ate eliza that time.  Si Te eliza major chika with friendships kaya we got to see a playful side of JayR.  Katuwa sya mabantutan sa shirt nya.  Amoy amag daw kasi ung bagong palit nyang shirt. Di kasi natuyo ng maayos ... Ang cuteee *kilig* Nagulat ako sa mga expression nya (scrunch ng face parang diri tlga) tas tinaas pa nya  shirt nya sa harap namin *himatay*  Hahaha pati ba naman un kwento ko. Yun lang! We went home around 3 na ata. Nauna na si joan. Sabay kami ni tish umuwi sa kanila. Spent the rest of the nite/morning there.. reminiscing...   O diba.. to think di ko pa naaaalala lahat. What if sober ako nun?  That's all for now :)  --- In jayr_online@yahoogroups.com, "hmph_08"   wrote: > talaga che got to touch his abs???!!!! kainggit naman! grabe gusto  > ko rin gawin yun! hehe! kinikilig ako for her! ang saya naman dun.  > sayang hindi ako nakapunta. oh well,, >  > leila >  > --- In jayr_online@yahoogroups.com, "Tisha Mae Dimaya"  >   wrote: > > honestly, wala talaga ako mashadong makwento. medyo wasted ako  > nung  > > gitnang part eh. hehe. > >  > > i remember him saying that he sang 33 songs.  > >  > > basta for me, unforgettable yung part where he started dancing  in  > > front of us tapos che reached out and touched his abs. hehe.  > >  > > basta, that night was super fun talaga. it was wild and  > everything.  > > i hope they put it out in cd soon ."

      I just can't get enough of admiration.  Just this morning, while i was on my way to the FX terminal (kwentong lakad na naman *sigh*) i passed by these 2 kids.  They're barely six, i think.  They were all over the swings and seesaws of our village "park" and i thought.. aww how cuteeee!! Napaka inosenteng mga bata...  when I was directly in front of them, i heard someone shout "ang ganda ganda ng babae!! miss! miss! san ka pupunta?? ang ganda ganda mo!!!"  And i thought "HUH?" sabay ikot ang lingon ... to... those ...  KIDS ???  Ngumiti na lang ako and said, "Thank you! Gsto nyo sumama sa akin?" or some lame reply just to shush them.  I heard a faint reply "ayaw po namin.."  Takte ano ba yan? catcalls coming from six year olds?? What is the world coming into?!?!  Uhm..Nakakaflatter kasi they must be telling the truth *fluff hair* shempre isipin ko kids don't lie.  They're much too young for that (sana) pero sino namang hunghang nagturo sa kanila mag tatawag ng ganyan sa mga dumadaan?   Ok na sana umaga ko eh pero nung nakalayo ako ng konti narinig ko sila nagsisigawan pa rin:   "Miss maganda! miss maganda!  BAKLA KA BA? "    chet __________ I was almost late.  Ano ba nangyayari sa akin? I think I'm losing the drive to work.  There's no PASSION in what i do.  Nagiging "trabaho" na nga.  Bilang na araw ko sa opis.. i can't take any more of this.  Next year wala na ako... (i hope)  Nagastusan ako ng sobra kanina sa pamasahe.  It's either take a taxi or Ma-IR dahil sobra late na ako this month.  I timed in 8:26 AM.  Not so bad.   I saw the skirt na iniwan ni ahia (bagong tawag ko sa kanya lol).  Ang cute grabeh. Its a plaid skirt, highlands kilt inspired.  Iniisip ko na nga kung kelan ko isusuot or san ko ipapares.  I need to get the right shoes hmm... Anyway katakot takot na tenkyu ako sa kanya.  pero thru email lang. Hindi ko sya kaya makausap harap harapan or ill turn into a hundred different shades of VERMILLION which i imagine would be doubly embarassing.  Hanggang ngitian lang kami pag nagkakasalubong.  yeah.. toothy grins.. parang nagpapa-check kung may tinga ba o may nakasabit sa gilagid lol  Kanina nga nung lunch, nakita ko sya and his group.  Di ako makatingin.  I just feel them staring at me.  Deadma lang ako kunwari di ko sila nakikita. But i don't want to be such a snob so silip ako kung nakatingin sya.  Nagkataon naman he was looking at my direction and nginitian ko na lang. He smiled back. *heart aflutter*  Then, umupo kami ng mga kasama ko sa gitnang table para kumain.  When we were about to finish, dumating sila and HE sat right in front of my line of vision.  I mean.. he sat a few meters away from me. diretso sa harap ko. As in smack front of my face.   Chet di ko kaya itich!!!!! aatakihin ako sa puso *hingal*  Tingin ako sa kanan, sa kaliwa.. sa malayo, sa mga katabi ko naghahagikhikan (dang bad idea)... sa plato sa harap ko.  Kunwari pinag aaralan ko ng maigi ang chemical composition ng sabaw ng pork steak *squints at my bowl of soup*  At di ko rin napigilan..tingin ako sa kanya... Nakabungisngis sya.  Sige bungisngis din ako hoping wala nakasabit sa ngipin ko. Sabay sabi ko sa mga kasama ko "ey una na ako ha? tapos na ako kumain eh"  Karipas ang takbo palayo ng lola  Hayyyy, buti pa email ________ Lei messaged me sa chikka (nung may internet pa)earlier this morning.  Lei (not the real name) naman ung isa pa tinutukso sa akin.  Shet ngayon binabasa ko ito para kaming high school. tuksuhan blues. to think nasa opis kami ha? anyway he told me na dumaan sa department nila. i know galing lang siya ng baguio (kasama nya si ahia i think) so isip ko hmm baka may dala.. Nung bago kasi sya umalis niloloko ko sya na dapat may pasalubong ako.  Sa totoo lang it was just a joke.  Its not as if close kami to demand/ask him that..  I guess siniryoso nya and he promised he will bring something back.  Tawa lang ako..  So nung nagparamdam sya, i kidded him, "dapat pagpunta ko dyan may fud ha?"  alam nya takaw ako eh lol and he said "oo meron pero konti lang ito ha" sinabi ko na lang din maya maya ako dadaan pag lunch na.   di na ako dumaan. kahit makapal ako minsan umiiral din "kahihiyan"  ayun.. pagdating ng 5 pm pinadala nya sa isang ofismate ung krinkles at strawberries na pasalubong nya.  i emailed my thanks sa kanya.  he just said a promise is a promise.  now how do i reply to that? Thank you na lang ako ulit.  Nung pauwi na ako nakita ko sya and his friend sitting and smoking.  Ayoko naman dedmahin after what he did.  Nakatalikod sya sa akin eh so kinalabit ko sya.  "Thank you ulit ha?" so shempre hiyawan ung mga kasama nya.  Di ko na narinig ung sinabi nya dahil tumalikod ako agad at nag time out.  Tapos may nagtanong "boyfriend mo ba si romel? ano ba meron sa kanya na wala kay lei? sya na lang" at kung ano ano pang chuchumaru.    Tapos etong si craig david *kilabot* lumapit (ung isa pa tinutukso sa akin) sabay sabi "eh pano ako? (sya naman joke lang tlga at di siryoso pero binubulungan ako nung isa kong friend na may crush ata tlga daw sa akin un) shet ano ba ito ginagawa ko. para akong EWAN.  di ko malaman kung matuwa ako at may nakakaisip sa akin or madiri sa kalandian ko.  Ang hirap maging babaeng BADING.  OO KIDS. BADING ANG LOLA. un sana sinigaw ko sa kanila kaninang umaga. pano ba yan puro lalake ang pinagkkwento ko dito.  Ano ba nangyayari sa akin hwaaaahh!!! tulog na nga ako! at bukas eh ma-late na naman ako nito at wala na ako swelduhin sa kaka-undertime ko.  Wala rin naman natatapos. Nabubuwang na ako sa kaka tunganga sa harap ng pisi!  gudnyt!

      *reviews past blog*  i must be scared shit of boredom if im always harping at tragedy.  new years resolution: i will forget him. git awta mah head u @$$#*!%  otei back to lil ol me of the present...  been up to no good lately. hehehe just kiddin. nothing spectacular happened. ahh! i take that back.  i met up with an old friend/classmate last week. boy was that an experience.  Talk about taking a walk to the past. It was Joe L. and another former classmate Noel E. They were my classmates in Grade 5 and 6. That was like.. uhm 10 years ago since i last saw them.  Nag eyeball ang mga bata.  But now that i think about it.. di na bata grabeh.  When i saw the two of them i immediately thought "WHOA BIGATIN!" I can't recognize the snot nosed little boys i knew back in elementary.  I mean the guys i saw were.. dang how do i describe them? Basta parang mga bossing hahahaha! i had to fight back the urge to say "sir" or say "po" or "opo" every so often.  Must be the long sleeves and tie that did that hehehe!  Joe if you're reading this, no offense meant ha?  I just can't get over the fact na ang tanders na natin (sama mo na rin ako) Thank you so much again for that wonderful time (sm north and sm mega.. di naman tayo taong sm noh?) I enjoyed it so much.. lalo na ung mga reminiscing.. nakakahika sa kakatawa (syete boys, manual computer games, diet at regular *laki mata*)  What else? Uhm.. nakakainis. i didnt get to go to one mandy moore show.  and to think kmi pa sponsor. hay nakow. it wasn't meant to be. tsaka isa pa.. nakakatamad lumabas. init init. ang layo layo...  i did get to help setting up the christmas decors for the house.  i bought mama a bday/xmas gift. a belen. for as long as i can remember, we haven't owned one set. there was this paper belen that we used to have when we were poorer. that was long gone. and there was this very expensive looking baby jesus given as a gift by a family friend to mama long ago. but it wasnt a set. it was just baby jesus. no mother mary or papa joseph.  and besides, its missing a foot and a hand. parang bata na venus de milo  so now that i can afford to buy one, i got it.. as a present. o diba haw sweet? thanks again to joe for getting me a discount for that hehehe!  mama isnt the kind of person who would be over demonstrative or over emotional over a gift.  sa totoo lang, ang hirap nya i-please sa regalo.  that's why i got to be so stingy in giving gifts.  nakakadisappoint kasi na after all the trouble of picking it out makikita mo na lang nakatabi sa isang gilid  *sighs* but i guess she was very pleased with what i got her. kasi nung weekend she was so excited over the fixing up of the decors for the house.    there are christmas lights twinkling outside the living room window.  multi colored running lights *shudders* ayoko tlga running MULTI COLORED RUNNING/CHASING/SKIPPING/DANCING lights. mukhang kulasisi ackk! i was prodding them to get just white stationary lights pero wala na magagawa. un na available e.  just make do with what we have.   hay nako what am i complaining.  It's good enough.. at least di overly done, i would give them that. naisip ko lang pwede pa improve eh. i just don't what to be such a killjoy and make them redo the design. baka ako pa papag ayusin nila ulit. im done climbing that rickety ladder to fix the lights. i have enough bruises as it is.  the christmas tree's up.  i arranged the belen.  nakakatuwa. its the first time i get to arrange our own belen *kandirit*. san ko ba ppwesto ung three kings? san ung shepherd? pano ung angel? kailangan pa nya ng pedestal para makasilip kay baby jesus. ill fix that up next weekend. hanap ako ng stable something para effect.  ano pa ba kababalaghan ginawa ko... binigyan ako ng pasalubong ni romel from his trip to baguio.  skirt daw. dang kinakabahan ako sa gift na un.  part of me is so happy/excited.. dpat nga papasok ako ng sabado para lang makita ung regalo na un.  tapos may maliit na part na bumubulong "AT BAKEETT KA BINIGYAN NYAN???" ewan ko bah.    che may girlfriend na un ha. don't do anything stupid. don't prove yet again that you're stupid.   hmm.. bibigyan ko sya ng gift in return para quits (bulong sa sarili: is that stupid?)  hayy monday na naman bukas. yet another day of slaving in front of the computer.  32 days before christmas.

      *emote na naman ang lola*  I was browsing my friendster and i came across this name on an acquaintance/old classmate's music list --> Shawn Colvin.  She described her as a Lilith Fairish artist.  And i thought, hey, i like Lilith Fair artists.  So i checked it out.  First thing that caught my eye in winmx was the song "never saw blue like that." I downloaded it as soon as i could.  And played it as soon as there's decent enough bytes recieved.  I liked it.  Simple piano chords.. an honest and soulful voice.  And lyrics that throw a punch right into my heart.  Today I took a walk up the street And picked a flower and climbed the hill Above the lake  And secret thoughts were said aloud We watched the faces in the clouds Until the clouds had blown away  And were we ever somewhere else You know, it's hard to say  And I never saw blue like that before Across the sky Around the world You've given me all you have and more And no one else has ever shown me how To see the world the way I see it now Oh, I, I never saw blue like that  I can't believe a month ago I was alone, I didn't know you I hadn't seen or heard you're name And even now, I'm so amazed It's like a dream, It's like a rainbow, it's like the rain  And somethings are the way they are And words just can't explain  Cause I never saw blue like that before Across the sky Around the world You've given me all you have and more And no one else has ever shown me how To see the world the way I see it now Oh, I, I never saw blue like that before  And it feels like now, And it feels always, And it feels like coming home  I never saw blue like that before Across the sky Around the world You've given me all you have and more And no one else has ever shown me how To see the world the way I see it now Oh, I, I never saw blue like that before  Oh, I, I never saw blue like that  ________ I remember when i first fell in love.  It was the most wonderful feeling I ever knew.  Its like walking towards a beautiful sunrise.. the dew-moist grass tickling my feet as the morning breeze lifts me up into the clouds.  Its like being surrounded by the beauty of all the stars in the sky and being one of those lights in turn.   Like a tight hug.  Like i could hug everything in sight and i will be hugged in return.  Everything was happy and beautiful.  And there was always a reason to smile, grin, laugh.. jump up for joy and shout my happiness to the world.  Like everything's in celebration.. and there's peace and rightness in my mind. in my heart.  How do you keep that feeling forever?  Why does it have to end when it was so beautiful?  Shouldn't beautiful things last so everyone could be happy?    Will i ever see blue like that again?  God bakit ganun?  Napapagod na ako sa kaka emote na ito.  6 months and counting.. and im still here. bawling like a brat in front of this stupid computer. shit.

       fickle    adj   1: marked by erratic changeableness in affections or attachments; "fickle friends"; "a flirt's volatile affections" [ syn: volatile ] 2: liable to sudden unpredictable change; "erratic behavior"; "fickle weather"; "mercurial twists of temperament"; "a quicksilver character, cool and willful at one moment, utterly fragile the next" [ syn: erratic, mercurial, quicksilver(a )]  __ i always see this word plastered in some or other piece of paper or billboard.  last time i saw it was yesterday sa sm when i passed by Kamiseta.  There were logo tags there saying "fickle me!" and i thought hmm.. parang may pahiwatig ito ah.  haha no diary, im not referring to him even though it fits him to a T.  Im thinking its me.. my attitude towards my friends.  There are times that i feel so friendly towards other people and there are times that i just want to shut them out of my life.  Tell them to leave me alone.  One moment i want to talk and talk and talk.  And the next moment i just cant wait to get rid of them.  Nahihiya na nga ako sa kanila .. lalo na sa kada ko nung highschool and people from the jayr online yahoogroups. di na ako nagpaparamdam eh. i just dont feel like talking anymore.  or writing that much, in my case.  o maybe im just...   capricious    adj   1: changeable; "a capricious summer breeze"; "freakish weather" [ syn:  freakish (???)  ] 2: determined by chance or impulse or whim rather than by necessity or reason; "a capricious refusal"; "authoritarian rulers are frequently capricious"; "the victim of whimsical persecutions" [ syn: impulsive, whimsical ]  teka pareho lang ata yun  Cha pointed out earlier that di halata na malungkot ako.  Nakakatawa pa, able to lead a seemingly normal life.  Ganun din sabi sa akin ni April, yung ofismate ko, a few weeks after the "tragedy."  She knows what had happened between me and my ex.  Sa totoo lang, when i realized di na kami magkakabalikan.. nagbago attitude ko.  I became more outspoken, more impulsive.. at hyper.  Comment ni ape..  "ang galing mo. nakakatawa ka pa.. eh ako nung nangyari din sa akin un, ilang buwan akong di makausap ng matino."   Eh kelan ba ako nakausap ng matino? lolz! To tell the truth, akala ko nga im being a pain in the neck to those who i confided with.  Kaya nga i try really hard to be normal. to be happy. to stop being whiny and bitter about it (to myself: eh ano ba itong blogspot na ito??) I should count myself lucky that i have been given a second chance at a LIFE.  To think of it, i should be thankful na i will not be tied down to someone na at the first place i wasnt so confident about.  I am free!!  -I can talk to anyone i want without anybody breathing down my neck, asking me a thousand questions -I can go to a bar, a mall, or just about anywhere without feeling guilty that i left somebody "waiting or worrying" (except my parents, that is) -I can meet new friends and stay friends with my present ones *grin* without anyone making me feel bad -I can catch up on sleep, read a book..just plain having time for myself. -I can wear whatever i damn want!! skirt and heels!!  Yun nga lang, it feels lonely sometimes na parang walang nagmamahal sa iyo.  When the computer's off. the phone's being used by my brother (kahit naman wala gumagamit, wala akong kausap sa fone eh) and no one's texting me (ang pathetic ba? LOL)  Ok, ill just leave it to that bago pa humaba ang listahan ng downside of being single.  Maybe i am capricious/fickle.  Tignan mo, i jump from one guy to another.  not seriously though. sabagay crush lang naman e (pero dun nagsisimula un diba?) i just feel na parang ang lalakero ko pala.  is it normal to be entertaining/flirting with guys that much? O laking gubat tlga ako at walang alam? lolz  its good though that it doesn't get to the point na may masamang nangyayari.  Farthest so far was angelo..that asshole.  Muntik na talaga mahulog ako dun.  Then i had this gut feeling something's wrong kaya bigla ko na lang sya dinedma without any explanation as to why ( fickle mode ON .)  Tama pala hinala ko.  May girlfriend pala ang gagu.  Hay.. men could be real pricks. Is there any guy ALIVE who believes in FIDELITY?  *nguya cornflakes*  ok im done with my train of thoughts. ano ba pinagagawa ko ngayong araw na itech?  yung kahapon muna...   november 14, friday:   day after the bday kiss... este birthday. nothing particular happened... except this one:  i was rushing/walkathoning my way to the fx terminal, when this white jaguar (ata.. di ko alam kung ano tawag dun) that was coming out of a street stop just when i was about to cross.  tapos nakababa ung window may nanonood sa akin.  kinabahan ako syet.  eh malabo pa naman mata ko.. di ko makita kung sino un. di binilisan ko na lang lakad ko.  then when i was a few meters away from the car, naririnig ko nasa likod ko lang. ang bagal ng takbo nya. parang sumusunod lang sa akin. takte ano ito??? kikidnapin ako sa loob ng VILLAGE MISMO???  tumabi ung jaguar sa akin.. then may dumungaw:   "miss, miss.. diba ikaw ung sa kanto ng street namin?"   mejo matanda na na guy.. mukhang disente pero katakot pa rin eh. tinanong ko na lang "ay anong street po?" sabay maputlang ngiti   "sa isaiah.. diba dun ka nakatira? san ka pupunta? sabay ka na sa akin"   sabay turo sa passenger seat sa tabi nya.  tinignan ko sa loob ng kotse.. sya lang mag isa.  pwede rin ako sumabay dahil male-late na tlga ako pero di ko pa sya nakikita ever. sabagay maraming bagong kapitbahay pero wala tlga ako kilala.  don't talk to strangers turo sa atin diba. buti na lang nakaisip ako ng magandang excuse. buti na lang di ako slow nung umagang un.   "ay naku tenkyu na lang po. may susundo sa akin eh"    sabay karipas takbo.  buti na lang di ako nalate.  kakabahan lang nga lang ako tuwing may makikta ako white na sasakyan sa loob ng village. dang sino kaya un?  sa ofis naman.. ayun tukso ako kay romel ng ofismates. reliving ang tamis ng unang halik ang drama.  chinika ako ng boss nya.. kung ano ba kami? kung bf ko daw ba sya ? LOL sabi ko nde.. joke lang un. pero nakikisakay na lang ako sa tukso nila. sinasabi ko na lang "aww miss ko na sya tlga" sabay simangot. tawa lang sila. they can't believe na crush ko sya nyahahaha   nakakasalubong ko sya sa corridor, pero dedma lolz. pero sa email ang kulit. nagsosorry pa rin sya. sana daw di ako pikon. sabi ko its ok. thanks na lang for making my bday memorable. tawa lang sya.  sa uulitin na lang daw. jusmio! be still my heart *blink*  then dapat field work kami.. kaso malakas ulan so hindi natuloy. malas lang kasi may pasok pala si papa nun at hindi nya ako masusundo sa office (de sundo pa rin ako) kaya byahe ako pauwi. i stopped over sa sm west kasi its where the fx terminal is.  naglakwatsa ako sandali.. sabi ko sandali lang pero paglabas ko grabe lakas ulan. so i had to wait for the rain to stop sa loob. 2 oras ako nag lalalakad. i ended up deciding na ill wait for papa to pick me up kasi ang hirap sumakay. andami tao!! eh isa pang malas wala ako load sa celfone nun so kailangan ko maghanap ng payphone na tatanggap ng COINS.  dang nakakainis pa eh pagdating ko sa payphone may babaeng nagtetelebabad. naka bente pesos ata sya ng barya!! may mama sa harap ko na inis na inis na rin.. sa inis eh nakipag small talk pa sa akin.   "alam mo kanina pa yan sila... parang ginawang private phone"  "oo nga po e"  "humahaba na ung pila"  "oo nga"  "kasali ka ba sa talent show kanina? dami pumunta dun eh"  "hindi po"  "hindi naman kasi importante ata ung tawag nila eh.."  sabay turo nya sa babae sa payphone  nainip na rin ako. i ended up buying a cellcard and calling papa na nasa sm lang ako. hintayin ko na sya.  nakauwi ako 10 na rin.. hayy. pagod pagod.   november 15, saturday:    1. woke up 9 am 2. texted romel a forward msg (ha? ano kamo? nagpapakatiwakal na ba ako?) and he replied back. he calls me baby and i call him angel. HINDI ITO SIRYOSO SYETTT 3. sat in front of the pc and chatted till noon with ate cha concerning men and the theories concerning their uhm.. ethnic differences :D 4. ate lunch and cornflakes 5. read halfway through a book 6. sleep again. 7. woke up 6 pm.. ate dinner 8. went online for a while.. saw nothing interesting. downloaded a couple of mp3s. 9. sat down to write serious testimonials for geri, anne, connie and joe lagon 10. uploaded a new pic!

      happy birthday to me!  im 23! now what?  *stares blankly at the computer screen and listens absentmindedly at the news flash on T.V.*   "..at sunod sunod na trahedya dahil sa full moon! susunod sa mga balita.."   nyahahaha bigla ko tuloy naalala sinabi ko kay cha.  its been almost a week since i posted here in my blog.  ive been feeling low/slow/numb lately.. coz.. i dunno. i guess for one, i got to think about what we (cha and geri) talked about: our future plans, our opinions on a certain person, and our topsy turvy feelings.  Tatlo kami pare pareho ng nararamdaman.  I remember commenting siguro kaya kami ganun kasi  bilog ang buwan.  I heard somewhere the phases of the moon really affect the emotions of some people, like it pulls the tides of the earth.  *shrugs*   Its not that i want to keep whining about him.  Gusto ko na rin sabihin sa sarili ko "get over him demmit!"  Pero i can't help thinking na i will never be over him.  Unless umalis ako ng bansa! nyahaha! Kainis kasi kahit saan ako lumingon naaalala ko sya.  FX ride.. mga kanta na pinapatugtog sa FX (u know about that one ate cha), mga palabas sa tv (kwento ni yoyoy butsekik.. da worx) hay naku!!! dang its my birthday at eto pa rin kwento ko. maiba na nga.  lammo diary nakakatawa pag naalala ko when i learned he likes yoyoy villame music.  butsekik, philippine geography, mag exercise tayo...  syet ok ibang kwento hahaha!  what have i been up to these past few days?   saturday:  i went to jayr's mall tour sa sm fairview.  i brought along ate lorie (our househelp) to see him kasi crush din nya un. nakakatuwa kasi pagpunta namin dun andaming tao sa entertainment area ng mall.  we were late in coming dahil nagpakikay muna ako (shempre papa jayr eh) tapos ayun. i thought we couldnt get near him.  i was eyeing dismally the albums we bought.  Kala ko wala na pag asa magpa-autograph. But i got to see the jayson and jastine and francis (members of the yahoo fangroup of jayr) who were in the backstage helping organize the show.  close sila eh hehehe. we squeezed in through the crowd and.. hayun nakaupo kami malapit lapit sa stage. at first i wasn't quite sure na makakalapit kami. iniwan lang ako ni jayson to brave through the guards cordoning the area around the jayr.  sabi lang nya "sige basta pasok lang kayo kasi siksikan na dito sa likod" so hayun..lakad ako paimporante, taas noo, taas kilay. i saw the guards motion to stop me from the corner of my eyes pero wala naman pumigil. nasa likod ko si ate lorie and ung isa pa jayr fan. hehehe astigin!! pinaupo pa kami ng guard. ang saya saya noh? tas chika kami ng fans. alam mo ba diary all ages ang fans ni jayr? grabe andami lola dun.. may banner pang hawak! jusmio por dios por santo!  tapos hayun.. pumila kami for the autograph signing. nagpahuli na kami ni ate lorie para may chance na makausap si crush.   nakakatuwa kasi nung nakita ako ni jayr nanlaki mata nya. parang isip nya "hmm kilala ko ito ah?"    Dapat naman siguro naalala nya ako eh pang ilang beses na nya ako nakita.  Sinabi nya na lang "heyy!" (hey ano? di nya maalala pa rin name ko bwahahaha) and he signed the 2nd album i bought. sabay beso beso sya. *ikot mata* ate lorie was duly impressed kasi MUKHANG naalala ako ni papa jayr.  halos magtatalon sya sa tuwa nung nag beso beso rin sa kanya.  super bait nya promise. may pic pa kami (me, ate lorie, jastine and jayr) that time.  memorable tlga. nakakaaliw! ang bait nya noh?  pero im not as excited about all that as i was a few months ago.   sunday:  went shopping back in sm fairview.  had too much to spend. bought a dictionary. bought penshoppe cargo pants. bought sandals. skipped mass *sigh* nagiging pagan na ako.. im sorry Lord.    monday:  first day back in the office.  i bought the cd i burned for april. and for romel. hep hep hep! have i told you diary about romel? ok flash back muna...   romel is this new guy sa office na i have a crush on. he's from a different department but he's just next door. matangkad, maputi, yatot. kamukha ni hua ze lei na short hair. mukha rin autistic. hehehe! actually its not that big a crush. o sige na, basta crush. eh may tukneneng na nagsabi sa kanya na crush ko sya so ALAM NYA! nakakatawa kasi sya pa nagemail sa akin.  mabait naman.  at first wala nakakaalam na nag uusap kami through email. i got to know him a bit. he's older.. around 25. AT MAY GIRLFRIEND. when i learned that sabi ko opsss! off limits. kaya i kept quiet na we've been "communicating" to my other officemates na machismis.  baka gawan ng issue. ineentertain ko na lang sila sa fact na crush ko sya.  (yeah im an entertainer). they kept teasing me loudly whenever i see him sa corridor. tinatakot nila ako na sasabihin nila sa kanya na crush ko sya. sus kung alam lang nila `day.   anyway fast forward to sunday night. i was copying a cd april was asking me to burn for her (may bayad.. benta ko sa kanya (hehehe) then nagparamdam si kuyakoy (kuyakoy is the name codename) through text. nag text back naman ako .. i asked him if he wanted to have me make him a cd PERO MAY BAYAD.  he was game, so ayun ginawan ko ng CD ng black eyed peas and a few other rnb/rap songs. except jayr songs. ayaw daw nya sa kanya hahaha. i confided him na patay na patay ako dun and lalo ata di natipuhan. he liked design for love pero un lang.  the next morning, wala si kuyakoy so he can't get the cd's he ordered. he went to lipa. i gave the cd's april asked for.  tatlo din un. back to work for me   tuesday:  i was talking to april that morning sa office.  meanwhile kuyakoy emailed me asking for the cd. sabi ko asa akin na.  kunin lang nya.  i was daring him to show his face sa amin. pasimpleng tukso kasi mga tao sa department namin e. tumama naman sa oras na konti pa tao kaya hayun pumunta nga sya.  gulat ako.  i gave him his cds but i could feel a blush creeping up my neck while i talked to him.  di ako makatingin sa mata hahaha. despte the fact that we've "talked" a number of times through mail, through text.. di ko sya nakakausap face to face. so mejo hiya rin ako. siguro natatawa sya kasi madalas ko sya alaskahin through mail pero napakasiryoso ko kausap IRL.  nanlaki mata ni april. tas pagkaalis sinabihan ako "bagay kayo.. magkamukha pa"  dang nadedevelp na ata ako bwahahaa! ay hinde.. hay naku magulo yan.   wednesday:  got through the motions of work again. i was late though. 1 for the month of november. i was late for 2 minutes hayy! pagdating ko parang lantang gulay. nakapagpabuhay lang sa akin si liza. she (jayr's girl) messaged me through ym.   natawa lang ako kasi nagkwento sya tungkol sa kawindangang ginawa nya sa work. hehehe basta grabeh.. lets just say na kakaiba tlga nagagawa ng email.   thursday:  today!!!  ang haba na nito pero sige tuloy lang.  i woke up 6:20 this morning when im supposed to be up mga 6 pa lang.  isip ko chet LATE NA NAMAN! kahapon late na ako ah?wahhh! buti na lang i got a short work of fixing to leave (2 lang palit ko ng damit nyahaha) and i wasn't late.  i was kinda worried kasi mama will be the one who will arrange to have pizza hut deliver my blow out to my officemates.   Sya ung may palm card (for buy one take one promo) and i was thinking baka kulangin yung orderin nya.  anyway i was keeping my birthday a secret from everyone dahil i don't want to offend anyone kung di ko sila madadalhan ng food.  sa totoo lang eh kinukulit na ako ng mga yun. they were asking me kelan ba tlga bday ko. for the past few days i was telling them matagal pa. i kept throwing them off by saying some other date as my birthdate.  then today came and nung inamin ko na NGAYON talaga bday ko. di sila naniwala.   nyahahaha! nagbackfire   when i finally convinced them na ngayon na nga birthday ko..si TRICIA, isang opismate, got this idea na dapat puntahan ako ni kuyakoy para batiin ng happy birthday. halos atakihin ako sa puso nung nagkakaway sya sa kabila (we have glass walls separating each department so we could see through the other side).  Naririnig ko tinatawag nya si romel by name and asking him to come over. langya niloloko lang pala ako. wala pala tao sa kabila.  praktis lang daw jusmio!  then after 30 minutes narinig ko SYA. naghahalwat ako ng gamit sa sahig nang malaman ko nasa tabi ko na pala SYA, CHET! i looked up to see him looking quite puzzled sabay tingin kay tricia. tanong nya "Bakit?"   tinawagan pala nila para pumunta at batiin ako. ayun buti naman di nainis at binati ako ng happy bday sabay ngisi. tas alis na sya. chet chet chet!!   mga maldita tlga un hahaha! *kilig tawa windang*  Dapat daw nagpakiss ako, syet sila hahaha!  come 3 pm time for break na.  dumating ang picha pies na pinadeliver at pinakain ko na ung mga un. i called them to come and get it. then i settled down to eat my pizza while waiting.  *nguya nguya*  dumating sila tricia and company. nasa likod si papa romel. este kuyakoy. may hawak na plastic rosseeeeeeeeee!!!!! then binati ako sa harap ng mga 20 na tao ng bday. eh natopak ako. sabi ko, "wala ba kiss?" sabay turo sa pisngi  he gave me the plastic rose and leaned over to give me a kiss sa cheek  bwahahahaahahha syetttt  napanganga na lang mga kasama ko. di daw nila akalain na mangyayari un *ikot mata* the whole time we were eating un lang pinag uusapan.  they never thought i had it in me to do that. or that he would even acquiesce (shet lalim nun ah)   they were asking.. kiniss ka nga ba nya? ang bilis ng mga pangyayari!!! sino nagkiss? sa lips ba? (takte sa tanong) eh andun sila lahat. all eyes were on us nung dumating sya.  ang lagay eh kala nila malikmata lang ung nag uusap kami.  andami left over na pizza. they decided that I should give the rest to HIS department.  okkkkkkkkkk! pwede rin noh? marami nga natira eh. over 3 boxes. i gave one sa oxygen, another department. then i decided, what the heck sige sa kanila na rin yun. sila na lang naman kilala ko eh. so i marched over to their side of the office.. albeit mejo kinakabahan ako KASI MAY AUDIENCE NA 20 kataong sumusunod sa akin (not counting ung pipol sa department nila mismo and ung mga nakikisilip na usisero)   then i plopped down the box sa mesa nila, announcing pizza for them.  they were 5 in all sa area. sir noe, sir someone i dont know, cindy and romel. ay 4 lang pala hehehe!  nung una dedma. so sige alis na ako.  only to be blocked by tricia. then she announced loudly na birthday ko raw at nagpapapizza ako. wala daw ba kiss?  tinginan ung apat sa amin (at sa mga nakasilip sa corners na nakikiusyoso) then sir noe stood up and gave me a hug and a kiss. bading sya `day. ok lang! so sige alis na ako.  *about face at bunggo kay tricia*  dapat daw si romel mag kiss.. walangya...  by that time hiyang hiya na ako kasi over papansin na ha. sya rin kita ko namumula na. naaawa rin ako kasi kanina pa pinagttripan kmi. pero he stood up (dragged by sir noe) and kissed me again sa cheek.  *ikot mundo*  i left the rose sa mesa nila together with the pizza. props ng visuals yun eh. i thought they need it kasi nga property ng opis un. when i went back to my seat i saw nag email sya, asking why i left the rose. ngayon daw pinipilit sya ng mga kasama nya dun na ihatid ung rose sa akin. syet tama na!  so ayun nagsorry na lang ako at nadawit pa sya sa mga kahibangan ng tao sa amin. he's ok with it naman daw. sana di daw ako napikon or whatever.  i thought.. "duh pikon ba ako?" bwahahahha  ___________ hay ayan na muna kwento ko. ill try to post as much as i can. all in all my day was great.  i was greeted by so many people who remembered my birthday. nakaka-touch. nakakataba ng puso.  un nga lang nakakahiya rin kasi most of those who greeted through text di ko mareplyan. wala kasi load eh.   even my friends nung high school nagbati di ko man lang na acknowledge. si mea nga tumawag pa para kantahan ako ng happy birthday.  grabe i owe you so much mga bading.   thanks guys.  you helped me through a difficult phase in my life. kahit nung nakalimutan ko kayo nung may jowanations pa ako u didnt forget me.  ill give you guys that lechon uve been hankering for.  ate cha and geri, the only two other people i know who's reading this. thanks sa session LOL.  and thanks for sharing your lives with me.

      hokey eto na, i hope this post makes sense *tawa*  just had a chat with ate cha and geri. and read their blogs. nakakatawa and yet comforting.  they mirror my emotions exactly. same thoughts, same sentiments at the same exact time.  must be BS KLAB at work.  i remember watching one episode of will and grace.  grace just got dumped by her boyfriend and she was feeling out of sorts after that.  an understatement if i have anything to say about it.  nagkulong sya sa kwarto nya for days, not talking to anyone, eating hardly anything and just cried.  she viewed slides of her pictures growing up.. forever asking what went wrong between her and her ex had to have some connection with wrongs that happened to her in childhood. as in obvious na depressed sya.  her friends wanted her to be happy again so they dragged her out of bed to enjoy the sun, have a life, go out and be her normal self again.  although her friends meant well, grace explained that she's not as strong as her squeaky voiced friend; not as practical in life as will; nor as flighty as that flamboyant gay guy (forgot the names) her only way of healing is crying it all out and sharing her loss with her friends (nyahaha)   in many ways, i see myself in grace. especially in that episode. i wanted to be strong and practical and at the same time bouncing back to a normal life after what happened but i can't.  not now. not yet.  but i will be better. i should be.  or else ill have all my nose hair plucked by ate cha if i ever resort to sinking down to their level.  but for now, im still into that analytical phase.  im dissecting, studying and rationalizing the what and wherefores of, not what had happened, but the complexities of ME (kaya puro self test ang pinopost ko dito eg i am a hidden artist).  Maybe if i find my true self i will cease being such an immature kid about everything.   Maybe someday ill feel what geri feels, understand what cha knows.  That when i look back, there's only thankfulness for the experience and knowledge gained from loving someone.  in the end, its the friends that helped grace overcome her grief.  lovers come and go but friends are forever.  i love you friendships :)  o diba para na akong hallmark card. thanks ulit ate cha and geri for your pearls of wisdom. tatak natin sa bato!  bukas kwento ko ung date namin ni jayr nyahaha

      I am a hidden artist:  You're a very down-to-earth woman who has an optimistic outlook and believes in enjoying the good things in life. Life should be "balanced" with lots of time for fun, spontaneity, and romance. You refuse to settle long-term for a boring job or doing something just because it's expected of you. Love is the same way. You can't pretend to care for someone if you're missing a deep connection. You have lots of friends who really enjoy listening to your jokes and great stories. In fact, you put the ones you love ahead of everything else. You're ready and able to experience romance and a powerful "spark" with someone special. Your biggest challenge may be finding time to connect given your busy (and often frantic) life

      bakit ganun, pag wala ako sa harap ng computer nakakaisip ako ng isusulat dito.  pag nandito na ako wala na.. writer's block? di naman ako writer eh. isang hamak na tao lamang ako hahaha  ok sige eto na lang kwento.. woke up around 8 am then languished and rolled around on my bed for 2 hours trying to hmm sleep again? hay ewan. bsta tumunganga ako.  its saturday and i dont have work! im going to enjoy my rest as long as i can.  come monday i'll be piled with work again and im really getting sick of it.  im counting the days till i think im ready to resign.  im just waiting to get my 13th month pay before i say goodbye to **** (insert company name here) then i'll find another job that will take me far away from here. i swear.. ill get out of here and all the bad memories.  i'll make new ones somewhere far away. i'll live my dream. i will see scotland, england, australia and new zealand... all those lands that until now ive only read about.  i will see the world (or parts of it in any case) and speak dozens of tongues before im forty.  ang sarap talaga mangarap.  first things first, though. kailangan ko mag ipon. DANG! ANG HIRAP!!! pano ba ako mag iipon nito eh in the whole year im working wala pa ako naitatabi. SYET! basta in 5 years i'll be out of the country and traipsing around in the streets of new york or champ elysees bwahahaha! hinay hinay muna ako sa shopping.   sana magkatotoo naman ung mga plano ko.  i really want to leave here.  despite all my patriotic comments about staying here in the philippines and helping improve the economy (ang plastik ko talaga) gsto ko mangibang bansa.  its the better opportunities (ive heard that even a house sitter makes more than what i earn in a month) that lures me.  the new sights, new people.  sa dami ng mga makikita ko, im sure i won't even have time to be depressed.  diba ate cha?

      hahaha here again.  senti naman.  i just want to share my thoughts on the fallen song by sarah mclachlan. excerpts lang  brace yourself cha. another one of those stuff about HIM  __  ..we all begin out with good intent when love is raw and young  ___  when i met him, i thought ang sarap nyang kausap.  he listens. he understands. its him. he's the one.  my first real guy friend  i never had a guy friend.  i never bothered to get one or keep one around.  boys are at least, eye candies.. and at most, someone to bicker with, someone to have a crush on. something better left alone.  you might think i live in a hole somewhere in Antarctica to have thoughts like that. But its true.  I never had a guy friend.  I was to shy to have one as a pet (haha).  But with him...It just amazed me that this smart, handsome and almost saintly boy would spend most of his waking hours talking to me.  Listening to my stories, laughing at my jokes, and loving almost everything about me WITHOUT EVEN SEEING ME.  I thought he must really like me.  The inner ME.  My personality.      I met him through the internet.   We became good chatfriends until i told him that i really liked him.   And i loved him.  He loved me back.   It was the most beautiful and wonderful thing that happened to me.  He gave me a gift that i will never forget.  So i tried to give him my best.  My world revolved around him.  ___  we believe that we can change ourselves the past can be undone   But then i began to realize im losing myself in our relationship.  It wasn't the fairytale i read in books.  Yes every couple have their ups and downs, but trust was lost.  I kept on wishing he would trust me again.  He reassured me that it will return.  In time.  _____  but we carry on our back the burdens time always reveals in the lonely light of morning in the wound that would not heal   There are times when i feel like the world is swallowing me up and i point the accusing finger at myself.  I asked for this.  I brought this to myself.  My fault.  But i did not.  It was never meant to be.  It was wrong in the first place. I knew it all along.  ___  its the bitter taste of losing everything ive held so dear   Just this morning, i woke up to see the first light of the day through my window.  My head was blurry with sleep.  But i remembered how it felt 3 years and 6 days ago, the morning after we exchanged "i love yous."  I was looking out that same window.. that same dawn.  That same sky.  It was beautiful.  I felt wonderful.  I was hugging my pillow so tight.  I was in love.  But that was 3 years and 6 days ago.  Today is November 4, 2003.  So many things change in such a short time.  Another day of work ahead of me.  Wish me Luck

      Dear Diary,  Guess who sat beside me today? WALA! boring boring boring! Sa ngayon wala ako maisip na maganda ikwento. Hm.. ay meron ako idea.  Kunwari exciting buhay ko.  Once upon a time there was this girl from a suburb in Quezon City who had the ability to control time with a sleepy blink of an eye.   ___  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _   _   _   _ Example:  I woke up past 6, not feeling myself.  Then had to scramble to the showers first dahil pag naunahan ako ng kapatid ko aabutin ako ng isang siglo bago makapasok. Normally it would take me an hour to prepare to leave (im a girl, need i say more?) But fortunately i had the foresight to plan what im going to wear the night before.  So all i had to do was fix my hair(what little is left), fix my face (this is the crucial part) and fix my bag (need to bring lots of junk to fix the face).  In 30 minutes im done and i...  Rush outside the house..  ..walk A MILE in a breakneck speed towards the fx terminal ..and weave through the mile long queue of waiting passenger where i managed to snatch myself a place in a waiting fx (sa tagalog nakasingit ako bwahahahaha)  I left the house 7:20 and im in the office 7:56 *kandirit*    ___  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _   _   _   _ Another super power this girl has is to change personalities and physical attributes like a shape shifter (parang mystique) sans the blue skin, red hair and yellow eyes in her normal state. ___  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _   _   _   _  Example:  I walked into the office with blue black hair (courtesy of hair color) and blue eyes (say what?).  Alam ko iniisip nyo...Ok fine bading na bading na ako.  My officemates were used to me changing my hair color/hair style but not yet with eye color.  Sabi nung isa mukha akong pusa.  Sabi nung iba mukha ako napossess (tamang tama todos los santos.. panakot!! bwahahaha).  Pero bagay naman daw.. I was thinking:  mukhang bampira tapos bagay? ano kaya ibig sabihin nun?  Sa totoo lang, naimpluwensyahan lang ako ng isang opismate ko na binentahan ako ng contacts.  I got them last friday and today was only the second time i wore them in the office.  Gad, first time i tried them on akala ko mabubulag ako.  Putting it in was hell but removing them? chet kala ko katapusan na ng buhay ko.  I tried pinching and pulling and pushing them off my eyeballs for 30 minutes while thinking "syet ano ba itong ginawa ko sa sarili ko!!!! argghhh"  My life flashed before my eyes .. followed by a headline on a tabloid that reads :   "Syoke natagpuang dinukot ang sariling mata:dedbol"    But i did get them off.  Im getting to be a quick study when it comes to wearing and removing it.  Sanay na ang lola! Next i'll be getting green eyes and dyeing my hair red.  bwahahaha!.  Then after a few weeks, i'll tan myself then get blonde hair and purple eyes, then ill move to jamaica, have my hair done in dreadlocks and sing songs of peace and revolution while smoking a tobacco imported from mexico *windang*   ___  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _   _   _   _ Exciting ng buhay ng talented girl na ito noh? She can control time AND shape shift.  But did you know that she could absorb a tremendous amount of FOOD? ___  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _   _   _   _  Example:  Ang sarap magtrabaho sa GABC.  I have a frustrated chef sitting at my right (april) who would bring in baked goods like cakes and pasta every monday.  And i have newcomer officemate  sitting at my left yayan) who brings in SACKS of chips, cookies, and biscuits.  Tapos di nya kinakain.  Sa AKIN nya binibigay LAHAT .  Pagkain kaliwa't kanan.  WALANG KATAPUSAN.   Tulad kanina.  Start off with breakfast (chicharon) then naglabas itong si yayan ng choco chip cookies.  Tapos pagkatapos ng cookies naglabas si april ng pilipit at shingaling.  tapos lunch na (nilagang baboy ata un at kanin).  pagkatapos lunch may chicharon pa rin.  may choco chip cookies pa rin.  bumili na ako ng kape para di mauhaw. tubig na rin para MASUSTANSYA.  tapos naglabas ng cotton candy itong si yayan ulit.  Come 3 pm time for break.  Tinawagan ako ng isang ofismate ko.. kain daw kami (babae ito eh sa kasamaang palad) I was like huwatt?? kain na naman???? di pa ako tapos sa kinakain ko ah? but i missed her company so sige sama ako.  kumain ako green peas tsaka dalawang yakult (yeah wat a combination) then chika chika.. balik sa desk. back to my cotton candy. and shingaling. and pilipit.  Majority ng food ako nakaubos.    Walang hiya daw ako.   Ok lang...busog naman hihihihi. Libre pa.  `Nuff said *gulong gulong sa sahig wid my belly full of junk food*   But for all the excitement happening in her little world, this girl still is bored.  Her yahoo messenger's busted (no power to fix one i guess) and mail is slow (nothing new but a few GIGS of videos sent by another bored officemate to forward)  So while working she surfed the net looking for potential friendsters who she can force into joining and writing testimonials for her.   She reeled in a half dozen new friendsters.  Not bad diba?  ___  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _   _   _   _  Scene 3  ( di na example.. kakasawa na ung word na un eh ) Nakakatuwa rin kasi ung friendster kasi nakita ko na naman ung mga old friends ko.  Like Joe Lagon.  Kaklase ko nung elementary.  Eto nga ktext ko na hahaha. Halos kapitbahay lang kami tapos dun ko lang nakausap ulit after. . . what? ten years? shet ang tanda ko na! wahhhh!  Then i saw Ann from the jayr online groups.  Fan ni jayr kumbaga.  Friend pala sya ng kaklase ko nung highschool na si Cindy.  Grabeh small world! Note to self: tanungin kung pano nya nakilala ang brewhang un lolz  Tapos nag testimonial itong bading kong kaklase nung college, si Inna.  Pucha sa description.  Isa pa magsabi mahilig ako sa pusa mangangalmot na ako *spits and bares my claws*  What else? O eto maigsi na lang.  Enumerate ko na lang a-la Charol style   done:  1) Fitted 6 shirts and one khaki jeans (di lang ako designer, mannequin pa.. pumayat daw ako? ng lagay kong ito?) 2) Finished Ms. Daisy's (boss) Infosheets 3) Sent Tricia her Price Doc 4) Started doing the new collection spec sheets (sheet bakit puro sheeeettt sheet naman o) 5) namura ni ate eliza (jayr fan/friend) dahil pinupuno ko raw inbox nya sa sandamakmak kong forward     going to do tomorrow:  1) december brochure 2) summer spec sheets 3) finish artworks for my suppliers 4) bring in sarah mclachlan's new album for me to listen 5) gawa ng testimonial para kay joe, inna, connie and ann  Mukhang mahaba haba na itong post ko.  Before i forget anything else i just want to say CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAROLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!! haylabyu so mats salamat salamat!! may pagkakaabalahan na naman ako bwahahahahaha! kakabasa ko lang kanina sa opis nung seyo and natatawa na lang ako.  bs klab.. exes.. the ex. the love.. the life.  Sa dami ko ginagawa why do i still have the time to think about that. Bakeet bakeeett bakeet!   Yun lang!  A day in the life of a near-sighted cat girl  Love, Yeye  P.S.

      Dang.. another blogspot. Alam mo cha meron na ako nagawa dati.. i forgot the password hahaha! Hope this one's for real. This first post is for cha. Thanks so much for letting me in here.  Thanks for listening/reading all my e-rants and e-whines.  Here's to you.. MORE RANTS AND WHINES *yebaa!!!*  Seriously though, I have hopes of being a writer/novelist someday. So watch out. I'll be spilling out words of great literature here *yeah right..boinks myself*   Oke here goes nothing..   Welcome to my life.   First entry of the day...  I put up this site so i can have someone to talk to when i'm alone.  Something i could pour my everything without losing anything.  This journal is where I'll ask the questions, seek the answers, and expect nothing but the understanding of the reader.  And also my day to day experiences.  Sana nga lang sipagin ako magpost heheheh  It's  midnight.  All the thoughts that i got spinning inside my head since i woke up is long gone.  I haven't got anything decent to put here anymore, so I'll start with a song.  Sarah Mclachlan.  OO patay na patay ako sa kanya, next to JayR.  She just released this new album called "Afterglow"   "When you look up Afterglow in the dictionary, it is defined as 'the glow or light that remains once the sun is gone'. You're used to this bright, shiny beautiful glow but the moment the sun disappears, all of a sudden you have to readjust everything. It's a very transitional moment. A lot of these songs are about transition...the turning over of the rock, what's underneath, the murky, shadowy uncertainty where everything looks very different."  - Sarah McLachlan   Transition is such a big word.  It puts to mind a slow process especially in terms of hurt and pain.  Yeah yun muna topic ko ngayon.  That's me.  I'm in Transition.        Fallen   Sarah Mclachlan  Heaven Bend to take my hand And lead me through the fire Be the long awaited answer To a long and painful fight Truth be told I tried my best But somewhere long the way I got caught up in all there was to offer But the cost was so much more than I could bear  Though I've tried I've fallen I have sunk so low I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here and Tell me I told you so  We all begin out with good intent When love is raw and young We believe that we can change ourselves The past can be undone But we carry on our back the burdens time always reveals In the lonely light of morning In the wound that would not heal It's the bitter taste of losing everything I've held so dear  Though I've tried I've fallen I have sunk so low I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here and Tell me I told you so  Heaven bend to take my hand I've nowhere left to turn I'm lost to these I thought were friends To everyone I know Oh they turn their heads embarrassed Pretend that they don't see That it's one wrong step one slip before you know it And there doesn't seem away to be revealed  Though I've tried I've fallen I have sunk so low I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here and Tell me I told you so I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here and Tell me I told you so

      i just can't sleep.  what happened earlier bothered me so much i was so afraid to get back in my room.  there has to be a logical reason why what happened, happened.  i found it! its here.. so if anybody's interested.. What i had was Sleep Paralysis.  And evidently.. i am also suffering a bit of narcolepsy (if what the results of the sleep test i did was to be believable)  http://www.castleofspirits.com/sleep.html _______________  The Evil's of Sleep Paralysis    Have you ever been asleep and suddenly woken only to be paralyzed, seen a dark evil shadow looming over your bed, felt somone sitting on your chest or body holding you down trying to choke you, or perhaps heard strange noises and felt an eerie feeling of evil descending upon you? Chances are you are more than likely a suffered a Sleep Paralysis.     Symptoms   Paralysis whilst entering or exiting REM sleep (dreaming).  Total body paralysis, with sparing of respiration and eye movements. It lasts from seconds to minutes and can be a bizarre and usually terribly frightening experience. With the paralysis you can experience some of these common things:   A feeling of being choked or suffocated  A feeling of someone pinning you down or sitting on you (your chest in particular)  Being able to hear noises including footsteps and voices close by  Being able to see beings or dark shadows surrounding or standing near the bed  A frightening feeling of evil descending upon you  Shaking of the body or rumbling sensation (ringing) in the ears  A feeling of untold evil surrounding you or trying to suffocate you  Noises such as knocking or banging on the walls  The feeling of being in a dream like state but yet thinking you are awake   I'm sorry to say that all these symptoms mean that you are most probably not being abducted by aliens or experiencing a spirit visitation or a paranormal event. They are all symptoms of the sleep disorder known as Sleep Paralysis (SP).   When you sleep your brain shuts off the signals from your brain to your muscles therefore you don't get up and act out your dreams. For people with sleep paralysis, you come into consciousness before your brain returns control of your muscles which in turn makes your feel paralyzed and gives you the symptoms that sometimes are very frightening and realistic.  If you suffer from this disorder you are not alone, it's actually quite common and it's estimated that quarter of the population of America suffers from it. It's a hereditary disorder so if you are suffering from it chances are that someone else in your family is also suffering from sleep paralysis and not owning up to it.  I can't find any logical reason as to why most cases report a feeling of being choked, suffocated or someone sitting on their chest - but it seems that being in this state brings out your very worst fears. Some sufferers have reported such things as loud banging on the walls, spinning objects in front of their face, dark evil figures standing over the bed, calling out of their name, and the most common is a feeling of evil descending upon them.   It is generally thought that some people who believe that they have been abducted by aliens whilst sleeping at night such as in the story "Communion" could actually only be sufferers of this phenomenon. Some people use Sleep Paralysis to induce Lucid Dreaming or Astral Projection, although most people have no idea how to induce an episode of Sleep Paralysis.    Sleep Paralysis can be a symptom of another sleep disorder called Narcolepsy. This is a more severe sleeping disorder and would need treatment by a Physician.  The visions you see and the things you hear whilst in this particular state are just sensory hallucinations that are very difficult to distinguish from reality.....think of it as being awake but having a nightmare that is terribly realistic. In the eastern U.S. & Canada in the 19th Century people would say that the Old Hag came last night and sat on their chest during their sleep. But however no matter how much danger that you think you are in you cannot be harmed whilst in this state, even though you feel as if you are being chocked or suffocated - no harm will be done!  Being involved with the paranormal myself I find that Sleep Paralysis is one of the most common ghost stories I hear - people always start telling me how an evil spirit was sitting on their chest at night trying to choke them - I always stop them and to their great dissappoinment tell them about Sleep Paralysis. It's sad to see someones face fall when you know that they've been telling all their friends and relatives for years how they had an experience with an evil spirit. People quite often refuse to believe it's Sleep Paralysis - but I'm afraid to say it's a scientifically proven thing - there is untold evidence available on the net regarding this condition - People don't want to believe because it all seems to real. I have suffered Sleep Paralysis myself on various occasions and I can say that YES it is realistic and YES it is difficult to believe that you are not going to suffocate and die, but belive me if you let yourself go and fall back asleep, you'll wake up later thinking it was all a dream - with no harm done to yourself.    A Few Suggestions on How to Escape Sleep Paralysis   Willing yourself to make a sound or at times just moving your finger will help you to get out of this state  Travel at least 350 miles away  Scream out loud and carry on after you wake up for a while  Sleep in a hammock that automatically swings all night  Seek professional help - there are actually many drugs and treatments used for this condition such as antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors  Strategic napping  Regulation of sleep/wake scheduling  Scheduled vigorous exercise and avoidance of sleep deprivation  Vigorously move the eyes, then flutter the eyelids, and then move the facial muscles  I find that shaking my head does it every time - I get scared and feel as though I'm not awake properly so I start dreaming of shaking my head from side to side   Many will tell you that you need to cry out the Lord's name and that will save you - but to be honest you could call out Mel Gibson's name and you'd still come out of the paralysis and not be eaten by an irate demon. SP usually only ever lasts a few minutes and rarely has any negative effect - it's virtually a harmless state to be in - just very frightening.

      was it the ghost of christmas?  or a malicious entity  or indigestion?  whatever that was.. it sure scared the heck out of me.  well.. not that much but it IS creepy  i just finished Nicholas Spark's book "The Guardian"  Its the story of a widow who finally got on to living a life, four years after her beloved husband's death.  She had the pick of 2 men, a dashing engineer and a downright nice guy and old friend.  It turns out the dashing engineer was a psychotic stalker.. and the old friend was the soulmate.    Everything rolls down to the end of the story, and the dog, who was a gift of the late husband to Julie(widow) saved the day and guarded her to the last second of his life.  Sort of like a guardian angel  nice.. very nice. it made my cry  Hmm.. a few days ago, i watched Lord of The Rings, featuring the infamous gollum.  Smeagol. Deagol. Or whatever.  The movie was phenomenal.  It made me laugh, made me grip the cinema seats with fear and anticipation.  It made me applause and whoop the adventures of the heroes.  It pulled my heart at those memorable moments, specially when Denethor denied his son, when the princess slew the dragon, and when a friend did not give up despite rejection and betrayal.    Ah... and it made me wonder at gollum: his multiple personalities and his battle with himself.  Anyway,  just a few hours (?) ago (December 25 3 pm).. i fell asleep in my room after finishing the book The Guardian.  i was flat on my back and hugging my body pillow with my right arm.  i think my head was facing my right side as i slept.  I was dreaming something i can't remember when i suddenly had the impression i wasn't alone.  I was rising above the stupor of sleep.. trying to think where i was.  Was i in mama and papa's room? was she beside me? i felt an arm behind my neck.. as if supporting my head.. and i felt a presence by my right side.  then i felt something touch my lips, as if somebody's tentatively kissing me. i felt teeth.. and slight probing of a tongue. at first i thought what a strange dream. it felt real...could this be real? i was swimming out of unconsciousness and my mind was racing.. i was stock still.. and for a moment i had that icky feeling that it could be mama? EWWWWWWWWWWWW! i know! but in my muddled brain i thought.."who else could it be? THAT'S DISGUSTING!! while i was being lightly kissed, i thought "shit if its true THIS IS SO EMBARASSING/DISGUSTING/ACCKKK*VOMIT*" and then i remembered I AM IN MY ROOM ALONE, AND I FELL ASLEEP ALONE IN MY ROOM AFTER READING. i cracked open my eyes after that kiss.. and i saw a hand in front of my face(the hand looked it belonged to a young woman.. or was i looking at my own hand? *scratches head*). it matched my impression of having an arm behind my neck.. i cannot see a face. only a silhouette of somebody by my side. then i felt IT touching my lips again but i pulled back. i think it got angry.. and i felt paralayzed. was there someone in my room?? a burglar?? a rapist?!   IT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME...and my whole body began buzzing. my hearing was like i was inside my body, i could hear my blood rushing, my heart pounding.. and i cannot move. there was a heavy weight across my body. more specifically, the right side of my body where whatever that was leaning.  i remembered the book.. how that psychotic stalker attempted to rape/kill the heroine.  i thought.. im going to die?!?! i remember that i cannot fully open my eyes.. like it was stuck in a crack.  i remember feeling helpless, i cannot move.. like i was wrapped in a net.  i remember feeling cold.. i remember feeling i want to wake up but i can't.  the weight on my body was pulling me.   i struggled for a few seconds, but it felt like it was longer. it was like i was underwater.. like i was clawing uselessly and i cannot reach the surface. whatever it was.. it was heavy.. my body was slack and i felt dull needles pricking every point of my skin when i tried to move. and it was not just dead weight on top of me. it was a malevolent being.  i was suffocating and i thought it was the end of me. at one point i stopped fighting it. but then it began whispering.  i can see a shadow on top of me. something in a gollum like voice.  i think it said "im better than you" im not sure. its voice was garbled. gollum-like  and i fought it again. i managed to rise up to consciousness.. and like an evil fog, whatever it was.. it disappeared.. swept away, gone.. to whatever nook it came from.  creepy i tell you  it wasnt human. it wasnt a solid breathing living man. it was either a dream/nightmare(or daymare coz it happend 3 in the afternoon) or it was indigestion.  but all i had to eat at lunch was 6 quail eggs and a cup of rice. and chocolate brownies. and chocolate and bituka ng manok  it must be indigestion.  it happened before. once or twice? but i only felt i was being choked.  This time, it spoke.   maybe everything was just a figment of my imagination.. just fueled by Lord of The Ring's gollum.. and that crazy villain in Spark's book.  After all, i just finished reading the book.  It could have been connected.  The mysteries of the brain...  But it sure felt real.. and it was creepy  i stood up immediately.  i told papa about it, leaving out the part about being kissed.  i told him i was being choked by something and someone whispering like gollum. i told the story like i believe it was just a dream.. like i wasnt that scared.. only freaked out a bit.   he told me it could have been that i ate too much and slept right away.  i should pray to st benedict.   i texted ahia.. and forgive me diary for even mentioning his name again.. i texted jeff.  but of course he didnt reply.  he's probably asleep and/or wants nothing to do with me. or i got the number wrong. i erased his name from my phonebook and i punched down a number im not sure is his.  as with ahia.. he replied that he was home. i texted him.. trying my best to tell him what happend through text. but i didn't call. papa was using the phone (chatting up with an old friend) and he didn't reply back. what was i expecting? he's just an ofismate whom i got to get chummy only lately. its not like we're close or anything.  just  him crossing my mind. thought he would understand or would be interested.  i want to call others and tell them a creepy story, but its as if they'd care. o even if i would even attempt to. its weird when i call them.  they expect that we should talk nightly and exchange stories and i'll feel obligated to talk to them coz they listened to me.  im as bad as gollum i know, but i don't like talking over the phone unless im absolutely interested with that person.  talking is so tiring.. listening is doubly tiring...  blogging is definitely better. hayy.. hope i fall asleep right away later tonight

      "No man can slay the Lord of the Nazgul," breathes the Witchking who stood towering over the tiny figure of mail-clad Eowyn.    Fire flashed in the eyes of the princess.  She reached up and removed her bloodstained helmet, shaking off her golden hair and declared "I am NOT a man!"  And promptly plunged her sword in the Witcking's face  SHET ang galing  - "The Lord of the Rings" is the first trilogy in film production history to be shot as one entity.  - The original plan was to film "The Hobbit" starring Warwick Davis.  - The entire trilogy was shot in New Zealand.  - George Lucas has cited LOTR as a major influence for his Star Wars trilogy  - Over 100 locations and over 350 sets were used for LOTR  - There were 274 days of shooting.  - Over 10,000 costumes were created.  - The cost of producing the trilogy was $300 million dollars  - Stuart Townsend, originally cast as Aragorn, was fired four days into shooting. Sources suggest the producers were unhappy with the diminutive Townsend's lack of physical prowess.  - Viggo Mortensen was praised for totally immersing himself in the role of Aragorn. He fought so realistically with the orcs that he chipped a tooth during the filming of one fight. He asked if it could be superglued back on so he could finish the scene.  - Viggo refused to carry the lighter aluminum sword used by everyone else, choosing to carry the 5-times-heavier steel blade instead - even when it was only a scabbard - so it would look more natural.  - Viggo made the Weta designers create sharpening stones he could carry in his belt pouches since Aragorn would have needed them.  - Viggo got so into his character that director Peter Jackson once addressed him as Aragorn for over half an hour, and Viggo didn't even realize it.   - While shooting, Orlando Bloom (Legolas) fell off his horse and cracked his ribs when John Rhys-Davies fell on top of him. (Maybe this isn't a fun fact for Orlando.)   - The skull and facial structure for Gimli was built on a totally new design since the special effects people wanted him to look like a different race.  - Gimli's dress and props are Teutonic and Norse inspired, with sharp edges and more of an architectural feel; Legolas is more Celtic and whimsical - as are all the elves - with their building stressing their relationship with nature. This shows the cultural division between elves and dwarves.  - After six months, John Rhys-Davies developed an allergy to the Gimli make-up, causing him to take many days off filming as his skin broke out in a rash and peeled off.  - John Rhys-Davies provided the voice for Treebeard.  - Viggo Mortensen intentionally touched Liv Tyler's ears in all his scenes with her in case there were any fans out there with a fetish for elf ears.  - Sean Connery was offered the role of Gandalf but turned it down. "I had never read Tolkien," he said, "and I didn't understand the script when they sent it to me. Bobbits? Hobbits?" Hmm... just imagine it. "Ish it shecret? Ish it shafe?"  - Orlando Bloom originally auditioned to play the role of Faramir, but he lost out on that role and was instead asked to play Legolas.  - Gandalf's encounter with a ceiling beam in Bilbo's hobbit-hole was not in the script. Ian McKellen hit his head against the beam accidentally.   - Ian McKellen's favorite scene to shoot was when he (Gandalf) drove the cart to Bag End.  - Every actor in the trilogy wears a wig but one- a hobbit extra with naturally perfect hobbit hair.  - 1,800 pairs of hobbit feet were made for the film. Hobbits were designed to look like they could've lived in 14th, 15th or 16th century England - as opposed to Rohan, which seems to be set more around 900 A.D.  - The Shire and the world of the hobbits were constructed to make it look like they live in a world of their own apart from the rest of Middle-earth. Every prop, set, and costume in a scene with a hobbit had to have a double 1.38 times bigger so normal items would look the right size with the hobbits.  - 48,000 props were used in the films.   - All props were made from scratch.  - Gollum was completely computer generated.  - Peter Jackson has a cameo in all three movies.  - A computer program, MASSIVE, made armies of computer generated orcs, elves, and humans. These digital creations could be given varying intelligence and battle independently. On the first run of the fight sequences using MASSIVE, the intelligent fighters all turned and ran away.  - Sir Ian Holm (Bilbo) did not arrive in New Zealand until after the exterior Hobbiton set had been destroyed. PJ filmed the needed scenes without him and added the hobbit later via bluescreen.  - The Orc blacksmiths shown beneath Isengard are actually the Weta Workshop staff who made the weapons used in the film.  - Hobbiton was constructed a year before filming so that the vegetation could mature and the set would look like hobbits had lived there for hundreds of years.  - Elijah Wood heard about the Lord of the Rings trilogy from Harry Knowles while filming The Faculty (1998). With the help of his friend, director George Huang, he filmed a scene in a makeshift hobbit costume. After editing it together, he sent it to Peter Jackson. (Elijah got the part of Frodo.)  - In order to make forced perspective shots (placing the hobbit actors farther from the camera to make them look smaller) a bit more interesting, the filmmakers devised a totally new system consisting of a pulley and a platform. When the camera moved (which is normally impossible as the forced perspective would become obvious) the actor also moved, and the illusion was preserved.  - Christopher Lee (Saruman) once met Professor Tolkien in an English pub.  - Sean Astin gained 30 pounds for his role as Samwise.   -Writer Frances Walsh voiced the scream for the Nazgul.  - Sean Bean (Boromir) starred in a UK TV series as a soldier during the Napoleonic wars with the name of Richard Sharpe. He subsequently appeared in a series of commercials where he would allude to his earlier role, saying things like, "Sharpe idea". In this movie he continues the joke: after touching the Sword of Elendil he says, "Still Sharpe."  - Boromir's father, Denethor, is played by John Noble. In Lothlorien Boromir says, "My father is a noble man."  - Dialect coach Andrew Jack used actual recordings of Tolkien reading his books to guide the actors' pronunciation.  - Ian McKellen based Gandalf's accent off of Tolkien's.  - The line, "Let them come" is said in both "The Fellowship of the Ring" (by Gimli in Moria) and "The Two Towers" (by Theoden in Rohan).   - Many chapter titles from the books have been incorporated into the movie's dialogue.  - Sean Astin's daughter, Alexandra Astin, plays Sam's daughter (Elanor).  - Five different deaths for Saruman were shot.  - At Osgiliath Samwise says, "It's all wrong! By rights we shouldn't even be here!" In the books Frodo and Sam never visit Osgiliath.  - In the movie "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" as Harry enters Dumbledore's study, a portrait of Gandalf the Grey is included in the collection of paintings. (It is above the doorframe and slightly to Harry's right.)  - Miramax was LOTR's original studio. But when the price tag for the project rose above $70 million they got cold feet and sold the rights to New Line Cinema. So far this has cost them about $1 billion. (!!!)

Would you pretend to love a person who's dying, even if you currently found the person you really love? -> yes   9. What do you prefer? A successful career or a happy married life? -> both  1. Be dumped or be the one to dump the person? --> im too nice to dump someone. it either gets to the point that i leave or i end up being dumped, bumped, insulted, jilted, jeered.. well you get the picture  2. Be a bitch or a liar? --> be a liar.. like i said.. im too nice to be a bitch. id rather be a liar pretending to be all nice about it than be an outright bitch. ey wait.. that means im still a bitch hehehe   3. The one who walked away from a relationship or the one being left? --> same answer as "be dumped or be the one to dump the person"   4. Marry a filipino or an american? --> filipino men are so juvenile.  wait.. let me rephrase that. MEN ARE JUVENILE! so does that mean that i should marry a woman? nyahahaha   5. Found out the truth or not, even if the truth hurts? --> the truth..    6. Live in the city or in the suburbs? --> id rather live in the suburbs. preferably a quiet.. laidback suburb.. with an exciting city a few minutes drive away hehehe  7.In your darkest hour be alone or be with someone? --> with someone. like a soulmate. if a soulmate ever exists  8. Be a good friend by not accepting your friend's ex or being true to yourself and commit  to your friend's ex? --> hmm.. decisions. myself or my friend first? ah what the heck... ill be a good friend. in the first place, i wont even go near my friend's ex. that's disgusting    9. Give your gf or bf a second chance or not? after cheating?  --> i don't know.  im nice but am i THAT nice?  10. Happy go lucky or always following the rules? --> both. where it applies  11. Be married after graduation or when you reach 30's? --> 30's is advisable.  I learned commiting myself after a longgg journey through college is not exactly a freeing experience.  We should all try to discover ourselves, love ourselves, and know ourselves before professing to know, discover and love others. dibuh?   12. Plead for the one you love or being begged at? --> both. i kinda like it if the one i love loves me back enough to plead to me. i'd do that in a blink of an eye if i really do love him.    13. Be the third party in a relationship or be alone for the rest of your life? --> nyahaha. uhm im kinda like a third party right now. its kinda funny. but not exactly. you see.. im not inlove anyway. he's my ahia. im just infatuated. hahaha.  14. Are you the type who faces the problem right away or walks away first to think? --> i walk away to think.. then i come right back to face the problem and all hell breaks loose.

      Got this from MSN page.  It's kinda sad and funny coz its true for some people.  Like me, I guess hehehe! At least I'm honest with myself *shrugs*  Dear Coco, My boyfriend has a nice apartment, a decent job and good friends and family. So why is he always complaining? When we eat out, he complains about the food. When we go to a party, he complains about the guests. He never enjoys the movies we see. In fact, there's almost nothing he won't complain about. I keep trying to get him to see the positive side of life but it doesn't seem to work. Lately he has been complaining that I care more about my work and other friends than I do about him. He also keeps saying I'm going to leave him someday. All this gloom and doom is starting to get to me. I have tried to break up with him but I can't seem to let him go.  — Miserable with him, and miserable without him   Dear Miserable,  Everybody needs something to get them through the night: A person, a hobby, a cause, even a pet. For people like your boyfriend, it's misery. The idea that he's a victim of everything from nefarious geopolitical conspiracies to bad waiters gives him a role he knows how to play. He delights in despondency, luxuriates in lugubriousness, jubilates in joylessness, exults in anguish and glories in gloom. Will he ever change? Absolutely not. He's having too much fun whining and complaining and generally infecting others with his mumpishness.   As they say, misery loves company. But in your case, perhaps the company also loves the misery. After all, if his bad attitude had really bothered you, you wouldn't have hooked up with him in the first place. Is it that he allows himself to voice opinions that you secretly harbor but are too practical or well-mannered to express? Admit it: Inside that bright, shiny exterior of yours, isn't there a big old complainer? And here you are, complaining about your boyfriend!   But there are signs that even this sad party must soon come to an end. When your boyfriend confined the source of his grievances to other people, it meant that he was willing to draw you, a fellow victim, into his exclusive little circle of suffering. But the fact that he's started to pick on you means he's cast you out and wants to move on. Of course, big old complainer that he is, he doesn't have the guts to do it himself. He's goading you to leave. And you should. Because if you do, you'll both be happy. You will have tossed a whiner. And you'll have given him something real to complain about (and torture other women with) for at least a decade. And that, in it's own weird way, will make him happy.

      It was one of those eerily beautiful mornings.   Mist (or was it smog? it's hard to tell since im inside the fx) hovered over the grassy fields of fairview as late as 7:30 am.  Sunlight was diffused by it so you know it was bright, but not glaringly so.  It was like looking through the landscape through frosted glass.  I can feel it's going to be colder the next few weeks.  *Brrr*  But it's better than the scorching heat last summer.  I'd rather die of hypothermia (which I don't think will happen to me here in the Philippines hehehe) than die of heat stroke.  Cold nights and mornings.   Meaning a few days and its December 25.  I can see, hear and taste Christmas but..somethings different.  I've noticed this for a couple of years now.  So many things have slowly changed.  Starting with the physical aspects of the holiday.  Most of our neighbors have set up their decors just last week.  And the streets, when we get home, are silent.  Ten years ago, the sidewalks would be bustling with children carolling, teenagers laughing and chatting and parents looking for their errant children.  I suppose now, 9 pm is bedtime for most people.  I remember a time when it was just October BUT every house in our street would be covered with Christmas lights, bedecked with japanese paper parols, wreathes.. and shiny glittering metal foil lanterns hanging on every possible corner and cranny.  I remember when kids would be collecting every bottlecap they could find so they could pound them into flat metal circles for their maracas or watever you call them.   Or some would look for old milk cans whose open mouthed top will be covered with plastic bags and secured by rubberbands (which they managed to pilfer from their mother's vegetable bundles) to make into drums.  Then, after going home from classes, they will collect their caroler friends and march to their neighbor's house and sing repeatedly "Sa aming bahay.. ang aming bati!" O Holy Night, Silent Knight, Jingle Bells, etc.  Then when nobody deigns to drop them a peso or two, plaintively declaring "Namamasko Po!" over and over again til they get tired.  Hay namiss ko yun.  One of the things I will change if I could is that I would have gone out at night and joined a couple of friends for a night of carolling.  *sighs* Di ako nakapagcarolling pa sa tanang buhay ko.  Delikado daw sa gabi kasi sabi nila mama.  Anyway, maybe the reason why Christmas looks so glum is because there aren't any kids anymore.   We are all grown up.  The new generation of kids in our place do not socialize as well as those of my time (shet ang tanda ko na).  So no carolers.  I have to assume that they could amuse themselves more while safely indoors (internet, playstation, hi tech gadgets).  Wonders of technology talaga.  I miss the presence of those rowdy, excited kids.  I miss the joy of feeling and thinking like a kid.  I miss the feeling of looking forward to Christmas because I will be genuinely exhilarated that a thousand years ago, Baby Jesus will be born in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes and surrounded by all the animals in the stable.  I miss feeling so happy i want to give away my old stuff to give to the less unfortunate so they could be happy too.  I--  Heck, who am I fooling?  Though I should be feeling more concerned with spiritual aspects of the holiday, truth was..I was looking forward to getting gifts from my titos, titas, ninongs and ninangs.  I was looking forward to the good food to eat at noche buena, the new clothes I get to wear and flaunt at simbang gabi.  I was looking forward to the loooong Christmas Vacation.   I feel so bad, now that i reread what I just wrote.  But it's the truth.  It is how I feel.  I am so materialistic =\  Its starting to look that celebrating Christmas is something to do because people have celebrated it for as long as we could remember.   Do it, no questions asked or you'll be marked as a heretic.  Hay nako i just can't explain it.  Everything seems so manufactured.. so commercialized.  Nawawala na ung true meaning of Christmas.  Everything is about the right color scheme of the xmas decors.  The right gifts to buy for friends and family.  The sale in SM or Robinsons or Rustans or in the nearest ukay ukay.   You do all those things because everyone else is doing it.   Ngayon ko lang nga napag isip isip.. how about preparing for HIS birthday?  Birthday nga ba nya December 25? Ano ba gift ko sa KANYA?   There will be an outreach program sa ofis.  I guess we're supposed to give gifts to the less unfortunate.   ewan ko ba.  I am not as charitable as the next person.  I feel i would just be sad and sorry for myself when i join those who would come because i can't show or express enough concern and caring as im supposed to show.  And I doubt that my pitying those orphans or elder people because no one is there for them, would be what they need.  Tsaka isa pa, I'm sure it will be gift giving again.  Naisip ko lang that means i will be encouraging those people to look forward to Christmas kasi may mamimigay ng LIBRENG pagkain atbp.  Again.. pushing materialistic inclinations to the less fortunate.  Or am i alone thinking that way?  Where is my Christmas Spirit?  Maybe when I sleep later on, the Ghost of the Christmas Past, Present, and Future will come knocking through my grilled window.  Hope they bring chainsaws for the grills so they could drag me and teach me a lesson or two.  Good night!

Then someone brilliantly suggested that we go to the beach around dusk.  It was foolish, i realized, but we were so excited to go the beach (actually its just the lake of taal).  we  walked  through a mile of seemingly uncivilized and dangerous forest in our beach get up (flip flops, shorts, and towels slung across our shoulders) to get down to it.  There was still light so it was ok..and we were 8 of us.   When we got to the spot, we scrambled to the beach and played in the sand and water for a few minutes.  I looked across the beach and to the place where we left our stuff.  The forest was creepy. Then we looked up in the sky.  It was getting dark.. the sun was setting.  And to make matters worse, it started to rain.  No sense in cooking dinner like we planned..the fire we made and the fish we were trying to fry was soaked in the rain.  It was a unanimous thought that there's no sense in staying overnight like we thought we could.   There were no lights, no signs of civilization.  Think Blair Witch Project.  Stranded in the middle of a forest.  The only light was coming from the distant shores, miles away.. across the lake.  And behind us.. a dark looming forest with strange hooting and scratching sounds.  I repeat, NO LIGHTS.  Its like being blind.  I was scared shit.  We had to go back to the summerhouse.  It was decided that we'd rather brave the dark and the slippery path and sleep in the comfort of a warm bed, than sleep in the rain and wait for morning.  Our flashlight was..eerily.. dead.  And so we kept pressing celfones to make it glow, held each others clammy hands while balancing our luggage at our backs and praying to all saints to get us through that hell.  It was pitch black, it was raining.   And we had to trek through 1) literally thousand steps of stairway (we were climbing a mountain and someone had the brilliant idea of constructing a narrow staircase up the forest) 2) low hanging prickly branches and strange creatures watching us in that creepy forest (in my imagination or in truth). 3) dangerous slippery and muddy cliffs.  I am not kidding.  We could have died or gotten lost.  But we got through it all safe and sound. dirty and cold, but deliriously happy.  Uhm.. Did you say scariest moment of scariest experience?  hehehe  [Your Funniest Experience?]:  uhmm maybe next time.. this one will take more space than "scariest moment"  [The Silliest Thing You've Ever Said?]:  to date?

      I'm supposed to be finishing work due tomorrow *sigh*  Hello Diary, missed ya  I've been happy lately so I'm not compelled to pour my tears writing down silly things hehehe.  What have I been doing? I've been losing touch with some friends, making new ones and losing touch once again.  I went to Cabanatuan last week and spent the night there together with my officemates.  I chose to join them instead of going to JayR's Gig.  Imagine that.    Wonder if i'm going to join them guys for another gig?  I'm afraid I've been out of circulation during these past few months.

      ako:: ahia, eto siryoso lang ako sandali ha? alam mo nakikiramdam lang talaga ako. nung isang araw bigla ka nag iba eh. so i thought baka un gusto mo. mali ba ako?  ahia:: panong nagbago?  ako:: yung parang ayaw mo na ako makausap. tipong ganun. drama ba? lol  ahia:: yah,medyo..sinubukan ko pro dko kaya...yaw ko ng may iniiwasan..sorry ah?forgive me shobe?  ako:: bat mo naman sinubukan? experimentuhan daw ba ako.. ano ako lab rat? *lol*  ahia:: no,im sorry..kasi nga dun sa mga sinasabi nila..si ian nga napansin yun..parang magkaaway daw tayo...  ako:: bakit parang magkaaway? di lng tayo nagkasabay magsimba eh. mga tao tlaga o. anong sinasabi nila?  ung ibig ko sbihin ung nung tuesday. gulat talaga ako sa comment mo. bigla ka na lang nagsuplado. ok lang tanong ko.."ano un?"  ahia:: wala yun,forget it...  ako:: please? nalilito talaga ako :'(  ahia:: wala,infatuation ko lang yun ciguro...jelly i think and naiinis syo pro naisip ko bakit nga ba?sino bako,ano bako sa buhay mo...shobe tama na seryoso na tong usapan natin.. _______  scrap new year's resolution.  i secretly told myself that night when i wrote my last blog that i will never ever ever talk to ahia.  that by getting to know him, im digging my own trap.  but a few hours later, nakausap ko sya ulit and everything .. well.. dropped into place.  we grew closer and i got to enjoy his company even more.  every working day, i was chatting with him.  and if email wasn't available, we were texting like im not on prepaid account.    my officemates even know the nicknames we dubbed eached other.  we were ahia and shiobe.  they call me shiobe, and him.. ahia.  My friends became his (check his friendster account) we would talk at night and discuss what color of shirt we'll wear para bagay kami. for 3 straight fridays, we were seated together in mass.  this is something only "official pairs" would do.  and of course during the singing of "Our Father" we held hands.  I know i shouldn't have been so thrilled with this, but i was.  That last mass, he didn't just held my hand.  He clutched it like i was going to slip away.  damn.  we weren't sweet or anything.  we acted like we were "magkapatid" or to be more precise.. like people who would rather deny their feelings for each other.  or is it just my imagination?  i imagine he's falling for me.. but that can't be.  he loves another.  so why am i wasting my time with him?! duh.. its like i don't know the answer. but how could i fall for somebody i absolutely hate? i hate two timing bastards. i hate it that he'll say sweet thoughts to me and declarations of love for his girlfriend all in one breath.  i hate it that he seems so kind and so ideal for me and for his girlfriend.  i hate the idea that im chasing after him.  i really am not! so what if i give him gifts?  i don't belong to anyone.  i do what i please to do.  who's the genuis anyway who declared that girls can't give people they care about gifts?  ok let me clear my thoughts first.  nakakainis sya. nakakainis itong ginagawa ko.  why can't i just let go?  last tuesday.. something happened.  i was on field, and i was bored.  i got to text ahia and we were talking.  ok..fine.  flirting.  we were discussing fishball sauce.  i was saying that i don't know how to make one.  he told me he knows how so maybe he could teach me how to fix it up.  Really, im not taking it seriously.  So i told him ok.. maybe we'll set up the time/place for fishball sauce cooking.  Then he suddenly went.. "sorry ha di ako pwede. sa iba ka na lang paturo" and i was like "ano ka ba ahia joke lang noh"  then 2 messages later.. it rolled down to me asking really safe questions and he's replying in one word "ok."  " OK"   So i thought... OKEYYY sige so ibig sabihin nun siguro busy sya at di sya makasagot agad.  or ayaw lang na nya ako makausap. siguro nagising na sya sa katotohanan na di na nya ako dapat kausapin.  I was really pissed/depressed about that.  Siguro nga dapat lang... dati pa tinantanan ko na sya. (Damn dapat nga dati pa shit) I wanted to ask him what's wrong pero bakit ko pa tatanong when i had no reason to ask.  He has a girlfriend.  He doesn't have any business talking to me anyway.  I felt rejected.  Pero baket?!!? eh shiobe nga lang nya ako.  Ang gulo gulo ng utak ko nun.  I thought that day maybe maaayos din yun.  I bought him a mug kasi niloloko sya na dapat magkape sya (para nerbyusin) tsaka wala pa sya nun eh. *sigh*  Then i got sick the day after.  I waited the whole day to hear from him.  I stopped myself from greeting him good morning.  He texted me.. hapon na.  Asked me how i was feeling.  Sabi ko kasi sa kanya nung gabi pa lang i might not make it to work dahil i think im going down with something.  Then he was back to that one word replies.  Like i did something wrong and he's waiting for me to say sorry.  Again.. i did not ask.  Tahimik lang ako.  Thursday came.  Wala pa rin.  He replied to my forwarded messages.  Yung mga replies na tipong he's bored and i should be grateful that he commented pero sa totoo lang eh nagpapapansin sya.  I answered good naturedly.. asked him how he was and how was his day.  Then out of nowhere he told me.. he saw me and nell together in a picture.  The picture was taken a week ago.  I jokingly asked nell ( na mukhang may crush sa akin) to hug me and take that picture.  He's a long time friend and i didnt think anything bad upon that.  Nung pinakita nga sa akin ni Nell yun and sinabi nya na papadala nya kay ahia.. i just shrugged and said ok.  As if naman he'd care.  Boy was i wrong.  I asked him when did he see it and who gave it to him.  Si nell daw.. along with a message na "pare wag ka magselos ha"  Then ahia told me.. bakit daw sya magseselos. sino daw ba sya.  But i felt he's not telling me everything.  The picture was sent tuesday afternoon. That time when he suddenly went all cold on me.  I didn't follow up on that.  I didn't want to assume.  We were talking in circles sa email.  Like we wanted to talk about it but rathered not.  Tapos bigla sya nawala.  Not a peep.  I peeked at the other side of the office if he's there.  Wala na pala.  Nag field ang gagu.  Ibibigay ko pa naman ung mug (covertly.. nadala na ako)  Then this morning.. friday.  First time ulit ill go to mass na di ko sya kasabay.  We were seats apart.  He's with his friends.. and i was with mine.  I was seated in front of him so he probably could see me.  My officemates asked me bakit di kami magkatabi.  Sabi ko na lang behave na kasi ako.  That's the reason i told everyone.. except cecil.  She knows what happened.  I told everyone hindi ko na sya kakausapin kasi its not right.  Iba na crush ko.  Or something to that effect.   At mass tried not to look behind me.  I did not look his way during "Peace be with you"  Then when i was back in my seat.. i got an email from him.  The usual i-dont-give-a-damn-to-your-forwarded-mails-theyre-so-boring-but-im-gonna-answer-it-anyway of his replies.  Sinagot ko na lang ng matino.  After a few exchanges.. nawala ulit sya.  I did not hear from him again until late this afternoon.  We were discussing egyptian birth signs where i was supposed to be sweet.  I was telling him i am not sweet.  He answered "dati sweet ka.. ngayon hindi na"  Like duh! sya kaya nagpaparamdam na ayaw na nya ako makausap ng ganun.  Sinasabi pa nya nag iba na raw ako or what.  Ngek.  I just go with the flow.  Show me indifference and i'll give you indifference.    So i thought this was the perfect time para magkalinawan.  The rest of our conversations is what i pasted above.   Right now.. im talking to him again. he's sorry and asking me to forgive him.  of course i forgave him.  shiet. here we go again.  *sigh*  what's wrong with me?

      First entry of the year:  It's official.  Its 2004 all over the world.  so many things have changed yet everything's still the same.  or rather...  so many things have changed in my life the past year but im still me.  still cheryll.  Yes, there are still times when I look back that i feel that twinge of hurt.. but now, i can manage to REALLY believe its a blessing in disguise.  I am free.. like what I secretly wanted to be.  I have nobody to blame but myself.  And that's GOOD.  There might be times that I feel lonely, but it's all part of life, isn't it?  The truth, i have learned, is that its natural for humans to find no satisfaction in life.   But it doesn't matter.  Whether im satisfied or not, it's the end result of the choices I MAKE.  Like it should always be.  One of the choices i made the past year is to out and find distractions to my loneliness.  At first it was all about me:  getting my brain occupied with all sorts of things.  But through that search, I have met so many people and made friends with most of them.  And it ceased becoming all about me and became about being part of a them.  Its cool to belong :D Whether its kapuso, or the abc family, or the hs kada.  Whether its out in the real world or in cyberspace, friendship is something i'll treasure.  Something I'll never doubt.   Anyway, something happened yesterday that made me review my new year's resolutions.  From now on, no more revenge.  It isn't sweet.  Just salt on the wounds.  No more distractions.  It clouds the mind.  No more pretending to be something I'm really not.  If i want to know myself, maybe i should quit acting altogether.  But if I am what i am playing to be, well.. goodluck chekay.  Comedy ka talaga ever.  Or a study of contrasts.. Mas maganda pakinggan.    And maybe if i can't quit acting, I'll try out REAL acting.  Basta, before 2004 ends, i should have at least done one of these:  1) seriously study french/nipponggo/chinese 2) tried out acting (theater or *cringe* tv) 3) learn how to play the violin/drums (the big japanese type.. dang where could i find those?) 4) have six pack abs hehehe 5) redecorated my room 6) find a job that really REALLY makes me happy 7) save enough money to go to NEW YORK  Ay, let me just put this in.  Ate Cha, thanks ha? I just read your blog.  Nakakagaan ng puso eh.  Makes me look forward to the coming days, months.. beyond today.  With all that has happened.. it makes me think we can make it.  We did it once, we can do it again.  You're right.  Maybe we will fall in love again.  Then get hurt...then get freakingly crazy.  But it's ok.  We have the comfort of real friends.  Geri, o ayan, this one's definitely better post.  I'm sure you're getting all warm and fuzzy, unlike my nightmare entry. hehehehe! Hope you sleep well tonight.  Love you guys! mwahh!  I'm off to bed.  Good night world.  Hello new year!!

      its almost midnight and all i want to do now is crawl right back into bed and finish the book i was reading.  if it wasn't for those dang specs i have to finish...  but for the record, i managed to quell my madness of missing ahia.  kailangan ko lang pala magbasa and ive completely got him out of my mind.  well, as of the moment.  with my almost unexhaustable supplies of novels to read, i think i won't have trouble occupying my thoughts.  wonders of technology talaga.  i managed to get my hands on a palm pc.. and all i have to do is download those little bits of text files (e-books) and voila! i have a library a click away on my hand.  i know its wrong *nanliliit* but having to download those books instead of buying/searching bookstores is really REALLY infinitely better (cheaper, lighter, easier).. hehehe  anyway, ano bah. wala ako maisip maisulat.  i spent almost the whole day reading about carpathians and vampires and a bad case of repeating oneself.  the book was entertaining (i almost can't put it down) but mostly because im entranced lately with dark magic/paranormal stories.  Effects of listening to gothic music yata (is evanescence gothic?)  Speaking of which, i noted to myself that i should change what i wrote in my friendster account on who do i like to meet.  I'd like to meet Amy Lee.   The voice, the eyes, the talent.  The look.  The hair.  Dang! This is just what i admired with jayr (sans the hair) hehehehe.  Seriously though, i like her concept.  Like an edgier Sarah Mclachlan.  She maybe young but she sure looks like she doesn't let anyone run her through or change her to suit "what people want"  I noticed that their song "My Immortal" has just regained position in the billboard.  I heard that song almost a year ago.  I remember singing that to *toot* Hm.. is it going to be used in a movie or do people just like it?  Probably the latter.  So many songs that was played last year or only a few years ago are being revived again.  I thought it should have died down by now but i guess its not.  Like "I'll Be."   I don't know in other countries but here .. dang!  They've probably done dozens of version and renditions it's just plain laughable/annoying.   Ok im biased.  I uhmm whats the word? I am irritated by the song.  And its doubly irritating coz i hear it everytime my mind wanders to *toot* or ahia or anything mushy.  Why am i so cursed as to be reminded over and over and over and over againnnnnn!  Couldn't they just choose to play it again 5 years from now?  Is the world conspiring against me?!?! *bangs head on keyboard*  oops *adjusts hair*  onga pala.. have i mentioned its jayrs birthday today?  i could have almost forgotten if not for the bombardment of text messages i got from friends greeting me "happy bday mrs jayr!!" i was like... watda?!?! oo nga noh?! *sabay hagigols*  natatawa na lang ako sa mga kaopismate/kaibigan kong mga un.  I must admit im touched na naaalala nila ako pag nakikita nila si jayr *hehehhe* (they were watching SOP kanina, i guess, kaya nila nalaman) but im wayyyyyy over my obsession with jayr.  nakalimutan ko pa naman na feb 1 kanina.  may birthday bash ata naplano ang jayr yahoogroups.  i was planning to join (a few months ago) pero i don't see the point now.  wala na ako kilala and im not as head over heels infatuated with him.  and....drum roll please??  he was seen french kissing gwen garci, for chrissakes! and he did not deny it! (i have it authority that it really happened.. o diba boy abunda. san ka pa?!) hello??? he has a girlfriend? yoko two timing bastards! *ubo ubo sabay sipol na nakatingin sa kisame*  hay naku pati ba naman dito. maghanap nga ako ng matino tinong subject na maisulat.  uhm.. lemme see.  movies i watched lately.  kill bill: deliciously bloody.  bitin nga lang.  i really liked o-ren rishii.  the way she managed to climb to the top despite her beginnings was quite impressive.. but not for the faint of heart hehehe.  black mumba was like her pero shempre may nakapag sabi kasi sa akin na kamukha ko si lucy liu so i prefer o-ren *lol*  then managed to borrow a cd of the last samurai.  i watched it a week ago and the details are blurry.. but i remember thinking as i watched that tom here really is something.   he wasn't as gay looking as i thought (boys prettier than most girls tend to be gay in my mind).   and he wasn't as overacting as i thought he was in jerry mcguire.  anyway back to the movie.  it was splendid.. magnificent.. wonderful! wickedddd!  It reminded me of Dances with Wolves.  Fighting for the old ways and for remembering a nation's identity.  The unlikely friendship between 2 foes.  I like the dream sequence, where hashimoto (did i get the spelling right?) saw the tiger in algren.  Changing fate and destiny.  And the really funny parts where Algren practiced his japanese moves when he first wore his kimono or whachamacallit robes.  the "jolly good" comments of hasimoto's brother.  Im guessing, the brother knows no english and all he can say is that phrase.   Soldiers cut off his hair/topknot (which symbolizes his samurai status) and the man says "jolly good" albeit tearfully *lol* im so weird..   How To Make An American Quilt:  If you had the choice.. who would you marry? a friend or a lover? Im a sucker for a-gathering-of-women-who-come-from-different-walks-in-life-who-discusses-life-and-love movies.  Girls could pick up lessons here if they're not willing to listen to lectures from mothers.  Where Love Resides.  How do i explain this without being hideously mushy?  Hay basta ang ganda.  Favorite line is what Mariana's soulmate said.. or rather wrote.  "New lovers seek perfection,  but old lovers learn the art of sewing shreds together and seeing the beauty in a multiplicity of patches"  There is no such thing as the perfect ONE in this world.  Everybody.. everything has their own little flaw.  But if you learn to appreciate every little thing that has happened in your life, appreciate and love the Good things that come to you.. maybe you can lay it out side by side and see ... what? the perfect MANY.  much more better than ONE, diba?  ang gulo ko na ata. antok na ako. at least na-tie up ko na itong mga pinagsusulat ko.  kung naguguluhan kayo sa sulat ko, think of what i wrote as a quilt.  iba ibang patches pero may point din yan *nyahihihi*  G'nyt y'all! ey cha.. mishew *kiss te cha sa tenga*  mmmwah!

      Hey geri,  Tuyong tuyo na ako sa mga ideas na isusulat.  Ipost ko na lang letter ko kay EJ.  He was my two week boyfriend, remember?  Undertime ako sa work ngayon dahil dito.  I just want to let him know how i feel.  This is in response to the letter he wrote.  I don't know if im making a mistake or not.  Bahala na.  Life goes on.  _________________________________ Una sa lahat, i want to let you know it never ceases to amaze me how you could tie up the current events to your letters. I don't know if you did it intentionally or not,  but you just made me smile a bit about your wait for the right girl. I guess that's one thing i really admire in you.  Even if you probably feel like hell, you will always try to make things light.  Sa totoo lang kinabahan ako when you told me you sent me an email.  I was half afraid to read it (because of what i might learn) but when i read that part, i thought "I must be really stupid to let you go."  When i was a kid, i loved fairytales.  Alam mo yun.  The happy ending stories.  Where the girl meets her knight in shining armor and he sweeps her off her feet.  And they live happily ever after.  I told myself, someday i will find my knight and live my life happily ever after with him.  I thought i found him in my ex, but all i got were lessons i will not forget.  Never rush things.  Never assume.  Never make promises.  And most importantly,  you cannot love a person if you do not trust him.  Trusting is the key factor in this thing we call love.  If you believe in your partner, in yourself, and in your relationship, nothing can ever go wrong.  Never rush things.  I have known you in only a few weeks, not counting the very few times we exchanged emails.  What little i know from you came from what people think of you and my impressions I got from being in your company.  And what little you know of me is what I allowed you to see.  It's precious few EJ.  I admire your courage for declaring your love for me early on.  So early in fact that even if you have not met me, you already realized this love.  But I felt pressured to return this love I find hard to feel again.  Maybe if you gave me time to know you.  If I felt you trying to know me too, faults and all, I would have loved you like you deserve to be.  But try as I could,  I can't.  I still don't know the real you.  You don't know the real me.  When i was 20, i fell in love.  Or so i thought.  I understand the feeling of giddiness, a grin plastered on my face everytime i thought of the person I love.  Like i wanted to be with him every second of my life.  Like i want our time together forever to start NOW.  This minute!! Damn them who told me to take things slow.  I know I am right.  We ARE right.  Who cares that i have only chatted with him for only a week.  I have waited 20 years of my life for him.  I have never felt this way in my entire life and will never I let him go.  You might find this laughable,  but could you imagine me chasing after a boy?  I did.  I really did...in cyberspace, that is.  You see EJ,  I see myself in you.  The old me.  But now I have experience to back me up.  I know the world isn't as pretty as we think it is.  I've learned too look at things in different angles.  I can't just focus on the good things like you said i should.  Life is filled with good and bad.  Its just a matter of seeing both and realizing it and using it to live practically.  We can't all believe in perfection.  So i learned never to assume all and everything is OK or GOOD.   And I learned not believe in promises.  Promises are made to be broken, sabi nga nila.  You do not promise to do something.  You do it.  You do not need to tell someone and call upon a witness to testify to what you say.  Actions speak louder than words.  I'm not saying you did not do enough, EJ.  Like you said,  you practically bled to show me how much you care.  But your way in showing it is different from what i am used to.    This is where trust comes along.  Try as i might,  I do not trust you or your intentions. I find it so hard to believe you could love me.  No matter how you explain it to me,  no matter what you say or do or show.  Its not i don't want to,  I just can't.  Because I do not know you.  I want to, but I can't because.. I am a giant mess.  Just like this letter is a mess.  I wanted to say sorry.  I wanted to explain how I feel.  I am falling for you.  Or I was.  But everything went too fast.  Things that should not have happened so soon.. happened.  So I expected.  And assumed.  I was jealous of the girls in your company(admit it... you have way too much girls in mind).  I was jealous of your friends. I do not know what's going on in your head when you're with me.  And what you're thinking when I try to call you and I can't reach you.  What your family thinks of me? (especially now that i practically stole your dvd's and book)  I am happy.  I am sad.  I am freaking out when you don't reply to my messages.  What if may kasama itong ibang girl kaya hindi sumasagot?  What if pinagtatawanan nya ako dahil ako naman naghahabol?  Pero...what if mahal nga nya ako but he has a different way of showing it from the way I am used to?  What if I'm making a big mistake in writing this letter?  What if?  pano kung? pano kung.. Walang katapusang "pano kung?"  Maybe im just insecure.  Or maybe its lack of trust.  If we let our relationship go as far,  I will only hurt myself.  I will only hurt you even more.  I am afraid of everything that you make me feel. You were, and still is my biggest test.  I want you to know that this isn't a simple decision for me.  I want you to take me back.  I want you to hold my hand and kiss me and tell me you love me over and over again.  I want you to tell me you forgive me for being such a stupid ass.  I want to make you laugh and smile and be so happy you'll forget that i hurt you and made you cry. I want to hear you say "duh" or haler/huller/heller again.  I want so much to hug you so tight and never let go. EVER AGAIN.  I want to grow old with you.    Dang, EJ, I want peace of mind.  I want to stop thinking of you.  I want to get my own life back in track again.  I want to stop myself from calling you and texting you and just plain annoying you.  I want to NOT think of you whenever i hear cheesy love songs because i remember you.  I want to wake up and not think of you first thing in the morning.  I want to stop wondering if you even think of me.  Sabi nila mahal na nga ata kita.  But it shouldn't be this complicated, diba?  Nakakatawa noh?  It's like two people are fighting in me.    My heart says,  "Give him a chance now" But my mind whispers, "Its ok.  Give your heart a time to heal.  If he is the right one, he will be there when the time is right."  In my life,  i have almost always listened to my heart.  I have made choices based on what I want.  It makes me happy for a short time, then regret follows.  Rarely have i listened to intuition.  My intuition tells me now that I am not ready yet.  Mind over heart.  Remember? See you when I see you.  Ingat ka palagi EJ.  P.S. strangely enough, bigla nagplay ang radio sa likod ko (this very instant) ng theme sa beauty and the beast movie.  bear with me and read this fairy tale i just thought of.  Once upon a time there was a beast trapped in her castle.  She was cursed by her prince to live a life of ugliness, isolation and disbelief in love.    But one day there was a pink (???) knight who came by.  The knight heard the she-beast wailing about her life, the curse, and her prince who put her in her condition.  The knight instantly felt challenged and so declared his love for the beast in a long email/letter. but because of the curse, she did not believe and threw the knight out in the rain.  Beasts and knights do not mix well.
