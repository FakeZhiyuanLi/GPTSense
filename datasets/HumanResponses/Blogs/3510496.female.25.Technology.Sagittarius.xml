      Like the sounds of Barry Manilow, in one of his famous numbers,  'You know I can't smile without you  I can't smile without you  I can't laugh and I can't sing  I'm finding it hard to do anything ... '  urlLink     Hubby 'complained' that he barely sees me smile *my Chesire Cat grin*  urlLink    for the past days. So what's more in expecting a hearty laugh from me? Well, well, well I know, that most of my bubbliness had been sapped up with mama's hospitalisation.   From Thursday evening to Sunday night, I'd been in and out AH, like 2nd home, juggling between 1st home and 3rd home (parents' place) tending to papa and little sister's needs. Thank God little brother could be dependable on laundry and very-light cooking. But poor him to put on hold quite a number of job interviews.  But, on Monday morning, I woke up with a heavy block on my head, abdomen pull, hanging throat, and occasional vomitting. Doctor, oh doctor, my Temperature is like I'm on Fire! I put myself on sleep right after medication.   urlLink     At late afternoon, I was awaken with a news that finally put me into a *weak* smile. Mama had been discharged. I believe, she has to watch herself again, and be due for a revisit to AH, for progress check-up.  And later that night, Liza came back full blast of her old self, which is greatly missed by her dearest husband. Thank to 'FRIENDS'. Did you folks catch last night's episode. I didn't know that Ross has arachnophobia  urlLink   , and Rachel has fear merely swinging on swings *or swinging-motion-phobia?*.  urlLink     Today, back in another 2nd home (office), has a happy and a not-so-happy tone. Lets spoof on unhappy things first. It's CMW's month-end today, and LSS's month-end tomorrow. Ask me why CMW's month-end date is out of the ordinary, because tomorrow they are scheduling their mid-year stock take *so cruel to coincide with LSS's month end*. This is the problem when you have to support 2 companies.  urlLink     On a happier note, I have a new addition in bloglinks *so much for trying to cut down blogging*. She's the actual person I was hunting for that lead to the Mistaken Identity incident, sometime back. Surprise, surprise, I wonder how she located me. Must be from the joy of bloghopping. Hahahhh. Welcome  urlLink Maslinda@rozas .

      One year ago around this time, I recalled my pa was warded in and out of Alexandra Hospital. He last discharged 3 days exact before my wedding. It was a period of sheer toil, in emotions especially.  This time round, it's mama. I was in the midst of paying my groceries from Giant, last Thursday evening, when I received brother's message. She complained severe palpitations during late afternoon. Thank god, brother who'd just ORD, around the nook to bring her to Alexandra immediately.  She seriously need to bring down her HBP count of exceeding 200 (hypertension). Any further increase will equalize to high chance of paralysis *God Forbids*. The experts there too, suspects of possibilty of her heart failing. She's due for her heart check-up this coming Monday.  On the meanwhile, she should be getting ample rest, in the quiet, serene, personal-touch, my-family-favorite-hospital. And this dutiful daughter of hers, will come by everyday, and bring in food, that is non-hazard to her health.  In fact, the night I rushed to see mama, I banged with an old uncle, who performed his Umrah with us. He went there with her middle-aged daughter. His wife, the patient in AH, supposed to tag along, but she's not in the condition to come. Risky. I wanted to come by and visit her, but I did not see the uncle aroud yesterday.  Heading there again, right after knock-off. Hope to see mama better.

      I had really MIA for long that only few days back I learnt Yahoo! has granted 100MB free space for its email  urlLink   . WOW! Yahooooo! The last time I checked on this account of mine, was weeks back before my flight. I was already thinking of abandoning it, as my Yahoo! email account, is the most 'sleeping' one.   Thanks Ad for informing me. And yes, for the record I had 457 emails in my Bulk folder, and 90 in my Inbox. My account would have been jammed if not for the generous, extra space.  Ever since I came back, I've been trying to catch up on my very longtime, and favorite pastime; READING  urlLink   . Ever since I got married, or worse, ever since I shifted in the new abode, I haven't been able to finish a single, decent book. I dropped by WRL, and left that place with more magazines than books.  urlLink     I guess, I have to jumpstart with more light-readings  urlLink   ; flipping and browsing mags helps. I am on my way to finish up the one by Hanif Kureishi, which I had a year back. Something I fancy, I usual repeat-read it.   Apart from reading, I told Ad, I want to be in touch back with poetry too. The fellow chuckled and said, 'The married one, can skip poetry.' Who says only single, unmarried ones pen poems? And what make he thinks I only do lovey-dovey poems. In fact, the one and only poem of mine, that get to be printed in an anthology of poems in US, smells of religion.  Well, all these ramblings about getting back to all hobbies, are simply efforts to distract me from being too addictive in blogging. I admit its downright addict-licious. Well, I only have myself to blame for the inability of self-control.  I should get all these down on a list (as usual) on what I want to do after half of the year 2004 gone:  1. Read (highlight: do not forget those books on my shelves that are totally unread)  2. Write poems, revisit those columns and contribute them  3. Exercise  urlLink   (MUST tell myself every inch input counts, and housework doesn't exactly make you shed a pound)  4. Don't merely compile recipes, MUST try out  5. Take up something terribly NEW, like sewing? Not doing buttons, not mending alterations. I mean serious sewing, like curtains, pants etc.  urlLink     6. Work harder (like we haven't) to give birth to a grandchild for my parents and in-laws  Hmmmmm ... I guess all these will be getting me away from over-blogging. Do you think so? We shall see.  Hurray! Tonight grocery shopping  urlLink   . Time to replenish the almost- empty fridge and cabinet. As expected hubby declined Sheng Siong, and Giant would be it.

      I am seeking solace here again. Twice in less then a day. I am not surprise if I abandon my good, old blogsite, for this new blog on the house.  Someone asked me on account of Zam-Zam well. How could I forget to write on it, after bagging 20 litre of the 'lemak' water. The account should continue from an earlier part of my write-up in the Safa Hill and Marwah Hill  urlLink    (the 2 ultimate points in Sa'i). As Siti Hajar, ran from hill to hill (400m apart), in search of passers-by with water or food, Prophet Ismail (as), then a baby, tapped his feet on the earth. That point where he tapped, came out the now-still-exist Zam-Zam.  Sad to say, the Zam-Zam well is closed from visitors, due to misusages. But we should feel fortunate to be able to savour the water all around. The Zam-Zam dispensers are very within reach in every corner of Masjidil Haram, and even Nabawi.  A SHOUT-OUT for passers-by, do you folks know the exact height of Jabal Nur  urlLink   . I thought I heard it correctly 2500m. But that's impossibly too high (me so terror is it?). Or perhaps 2500 feet, that converts to less than 1km. My web-search results threw me few answers like 621m, 500 feet etc. Nice souls, kindly tag me for some possible or definite measurements.  Another kind of missing of being in land of Arabia, is its TV channel, MBC. Apart from offering quite backdated seasons of US serials like X-Files, Lois & Clark; it has spread of uber good local delicacies (read: for sightings, not eating).  Arabs have their own rendition of Fear Factor  urlLink   , with a male and female compere. They have their own house comedians  urlLink   , CBM, which are so Senario-alike. My favorite, which I always caught few glimpses before heading 2 masjid for subuh, is Fantasia. Each episode sees one good, popular Arab singers accompanied with 'Live' band. One segment in it is the hypnotise-session. I am thinking of checking out one songstress, Fatin Brazi. Their music videos, POWER.   You folks must be wondering, where on earth I dig time to watch TV. Well, in between packing our stuffs, or ironing our garments.  urlLink     I can't wait to upload the pictures here, as requested by many too. I could only collect the negatives-burnt-to-CD next Monday. Well, unless Liza is so hardworking to scan pic by pic. No!  On the meanwhile, waiting for dear hubby to fetch me. What should I cook? What should we eat? Have to something fast to cook. But not instant noodles, ok!

      I'd decided not to let this blogsite fester off. I will come by here once in awhile, seeking solace, and pen-down more serious stuffs, compare to the other light-hearted blogsite I own.  My earlier entry 'Chronicles from Land of Arabia' had done lots of heart-touching  urlLink   , on the other side of my blogsite. I'd even email this link to the Shahidah's party, while giving an online feedback of the whole trip.   Apologies to the one-third *and most senior* of the 3 Abdul aka Fadly. I don't mean any harm of the statement of chasing-the-dutch-girl. Initially, I came here to delete the statement. But later, I decide, it SHALL stay, for the sake of hilarity. Don't you mind, ok?   And so sorry too, to hear both your film rolls, kaput. Insya Allah, I will upload most of my already well-developed 6 rolls in this website. You choose, we develop, at no cost. Or like my hubby's saying, we 'Chak Kopi'  urlLink    one fine day to view the photos.  My China-man superior is not back yet today as scheduled. I haven't seen him since the day before Vesak Day. I understand he flew off to Beijing, and later Xi'an on the weekend after I flew out. Mystery. Is he still in China? Or, was he ordered quarantine (read: SARS). Or, his airplane got hijacked. Or worst, blasted off  urlLink   . Liza, quit your wild thoughts.  I used this opportunity of being protocol-less, by modifying or rather doing add-ons on this rather mundane site. See the more links, message boards etc. I know, this site won't be frequent as much as the other one. Yet, I love this site more. Strange.   On the meanwhile, stay tuned. And I can't wait to end the day, and finish my readings on Hanif Kureishi's Intimacy.  urlLink

       This write-up I think its the longest I ever done, extract from summary of my written journal there and most of my memory     June 3rd 2004 Thursday   @ 1pm (SG time), exactly we took off from CIA to Jeddah on an 8-hour plus flight. Quite a no of people saw us off, esp. hubby's side that left me all red-eyed n puffy-cheeked.   In my virgin, long flight, I sat in between my hubby n our tour group official, Ms Norsiah. It's a sheer pleasure sitting with her, because I know a great deal from her experience. Now I know, most officials for umrah/hajj are volunteers who took leave from their daily job on their own accord. Women are granted such visa twice a year only, compare to unlimited for men.   @ 5pm (SA time, SG time is 10pm), we reached King Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jeddah. To clear customs, it took almost 2 hours, although it wasn't that crowded. Truly reminds me of our neighboring country.  Once cleared, boarded the bus heading to Medina. Half way, stopped somewhere for late dinner.     June 4th 2004 Friday   We checked into Al-Fayroz Hotel in Medina at 2am (SA time). 3.30 am was time for Subuh prayer, and Masya Allah, Masjidil Nabawi is just a walking distance from our hotel (e.g. Scotts cross-over Shaw Isetan).  The view of Nabawi @ early pre-dawn is so exhilarating. I was kind of 'jakun'. At the entry of the female prayer hall, there were policewomen all black, with number-tagged, and you could only peek at their alluring eyes. And gosh! I forgot to leave my camera, despite constant reminding from mama. The policewoman pointed turn back at me to leave my camera in Arabic (of course). And me talked 'duck' and don’t know what's on top of my head, passed the camera to her and ask her to keep for me till after prayers.   Laa' … Laa' … Haram Siti Rahmah  (No … No … It's unlawful Siti Rahmah).  I wonder since when I changed my name to Siti Rahmah. Well, they practically call you either Hajjah or Siti Rahmah.   Left with no choice, I turned back to my hotel, hearing the first adzan. I returned back of cause camera-free. The same policewoman spoofed some Arabic again, and me simply nodding my head, and she hugged me.  I got more 'jakun' entering the prayer hall in Nabawi. I looked up and got awed with the lightings, scriptures. I looked down as my 2 tired feet threaded down the cool, marble flooring. I looked around, n saw neatly rowed Zam-Zam dispenser to quench congregates' thirst, and the beautiful women with beautiful children.   Most of these women covered themselves from head to toe, some even runs a net over their eyes. But do you know underneath the dull, black outfit (abayat), they wore fancy, colourful ones. Well, if you are a true observer, there are numerous ways of presenting women's headgear. There are simply-slip-in ones, even velcro-ed ones!  Breakfast came right after Subuh. After that, we rested a little while because we were to get ready to visit Taman Raudhah, where our Prophet Muhammad pbuh and his 2 friends, Saiyidina Abu Bakar & Saiyidina Umar been laid to rest forever.   Making our way through there was truly challenging plus my little sister hesitation. My mother chose to be left out, because her feet were giving her away, which resulted her to be wheel-chaired most of the time after that.  But with perseverance and highest desire, I brought myself and sis to push our way through. Seriously, we are minute compare to those big-boned and structured women surrounding us. We could only stood hard-stoned despite vigorous nudging from them. Alhamdulillah, we managed to stood by all 3 makams, read du’a and sent salam from others.  That was not the last bit of it. We joined mama, and the rest of the ladies, slightly further from the Raudhah area. One middle-aged lady, Ms Aishah, who was on wheelchair too, suddenly asked whether I could bring her there. I do not have the heart to reject her, but since she has faith in me, I simply lend her to hold on to my shoulder, sans her wheelchair.  It was a more challenging trip compare to earlier. I really admire this Ms Aishah. She wanted to go all the way front. I was worried of her condition, but I simply obliged and hold her tighter to me. At the end of it, we had one very happy, contented and thankful Ms Aishah who kept singing my praises to the ladies around, that encouraged a mother, Ms Hanim and her 14 yr old midget daughter Filza to take me as their chaperon into Raudhah again.  In my heart, Dear Almighty, is this one of the bout of challenges You pose to me? In that case, I shall take it. And for the 3rd time, on the very same Friday, I made my way to Raudhah.  We are fortunate to get our first Friday prayer in Nabawi, and later another Friday prayer in Masjidil Haram (this one later can talk).  After Asar, hubby and I were left some time to tour around nearby. And this time round, camera not to be forgotten. Part of Medina especially around our lodging, is truly Manhattan-like. Who says, its all deserts and camels?  If we have KFC, they have Al-Baik (frankly, stick on to our KFC). If we have BK, they have Hardees. Don't be cheated, their claimed beef-burgers are all actually mutton. Hubby took a pose with the friendly Hardees’ crew counters (who thought we are Malaysians). And we won a digital language translator in instant lucky dip!  We bought an electrical scent burner from this shop owned by a Pakistani, and assisted by a Gurkha. Basically, all sellers around are so eloquent in Malay or Bahasa. To think my hubby went through all the pain drilled by me of numbers in Arabic.   Yahhh Haji/Hajjah …. Ini murah-murah. Satu sepuluh riyal..   Knocks forehead.     June 5th 2004 Saturday   After breakfast, it's Medina City Tour.   First Stop, Makam Al-Baqi, where those who demised being buried.  In Singapore, women are free to step in cemeteries, but not in Holy City. It's all gated, for women to simply stand outside and read their prayers.  Second Stop, Jabal (Bukit) Dzur. Simply visiting, no hiking. Too bad we are only given only 20 minutes, because there seems to better bargains at the foot of hill from the street-sellers around.  Third Stop, Kebun Kurma. Dates tree actually looks like Kelapa Sawit tree. My father said, there's a connection, but he couldn't recall the story told by the ustaz on his last haj trip. Very interesting.  Fourth Stop, Masjid Kubah, first mosque build by Prophet Muhammad pbuh. Every corner we went, there seems to street peddlers around. I bought 2 neat, thermos flasks for me n MIL.  Fifth Stop, Masjid Kiblataini (2 kiblat). This was true challenge for mama, because it's not wheelchair-friendly. We had to assist her to endure 4-storeys high, before reaching the female musollah.  Sixth Stop, Masjid Tujuh (sad to say only left 3 or 4, due to commercialization). How come the Saudis doesn't fight to preserve it at least?  Seventh and Final Stop for the day, Pasar Kurma. We bargained with Pakistanis again, for 2kg of Ajwa (kurma nabi), 2kg of pistachios and 3 boxes of small-packed Kurma badam. Happy with our loot, head back to hotel, in time for Zuhur.  After Asar, hubby and I were in hunt of local cuisine, like their dhal/keema dip. This was due to my previous day greed buying lots of their beautiful, fresh looking breads, which was not so good to eat own its own. After grabbing a Moroccan jubah for hubby, both of us wondered aimlessly for eateries. It seems only kebab for food here and there. We even went far until passed by Makam Al-Baqi, till we ended up in some backlands, and construction area with only men around. Scary.  With God's willing, suddenly we found a long stretch array of eateries. Which was only a distance away from Nabawi. The dalcha and sambar chicken till now still lingering in my tastebud.  After Isyak, hubby and I went back to the same shop we bought the scent burner to get more of Kasturi Putih scent. Luggage-packing time back in hotel, since luggages have to be outside our room by 10am tomorrow. Heading to Mecca the next day.    June 6th 2004 Sunday   Ziarah Wada (Farewell Visit) to Taman Raudhah. This time round, Mama's feet are better, so we managed to charged through right at its opening hour (for females) at 6.15am. You should take note the sounds of scurrying, stomping footstep of the ladies. It sounds almost like horses galloping.  I was so emotional to leave Medina, which really offers lots of tranquility in my mind. My husband even expresses his thoughts he wouldn't mind settling there even to sell goreng pisang. You have no excuse not to catch all your 5-times prayers in Nabawi, which something we really look forward. Time is really short there, yet so worthy.  Before Asar, all of us in ihram, head to Nabawi for last time to perform our Asar and Ihram Prayers. Farewell Medina, Insya Allah, I will come by again in future.  We stopped by at Jabal Uhud, where Sayidina Hamzah (Prophet Muhammad's uncle perished in the Uhud War). He was laid rest nearby too. After reading prose of Al-Fateha to him, hubby and I decide to hike a bit of the Jabal Uhud. On the way, we met my hubby's step-granny, Nek Lamah, who was busy bargaining for prayer mats.  Last stop in Medina was Masjid Bir Ali (first miqat – jatuhkan niat umrah). After that, we are encouraged to chant the talbiah.   Labbaikallah Humma Labbaik. Labbaikala Syarikala Laka Labbaik. Innal Hamda. Walniqmata. Lakawalmulk, Lasyarikalah.     June 7th 2004 Monday   By the time we reached Masjidil Haram, it was half past 1 am. And goodness gracious, if I thought earlier our lodging in Medina is very near to Nabawi, this is even better. We simply, stepped out from Zahret Mecca Hotel, and there stood Masjidil Haram (via Gate No 62 – Babu Al Umrah).  Mr Ayoob Anggulia, BOSS of Shahidah Travel and the leading ustaz, hospitably welcome us. So all geared, for next part of umrah, the tawaf.  As we took our steps into Masjidil Haram, following our ustaz, and followed every line of prayers he read out, I was nervous. Am I truly welcome to see the Baitullah? I heard many stories of it, unimaginable ones. When I first laid my eyes on Kaabah, tears profusingly ran down my cheeks, but my tongue never stopped saying out the prayers. We did the 7 rounds of tawaf. Mecca is truly the city that never sleeps. Not even New York or Las Vegas could compete with it. 24-7, congregates flocking in, praying, tawaf-ing. Subhanallah.  After the tawaf, we prayed facing the Pintu Kaabah, and read our du'a (it’s the best time to seek all forgiveness). I can't help crying again thinking of my past misdeeds. Dear Almighty, I truly hope You hear me.  After that (it's sunnah) we rested awhile drinking the Zam-Zam, facing the Kaabah, and more du'a read out, before we start our Sa'i.   Frankly, to me, Sa'i 7 times from Safa point to Marwah point is more challenging then tawaf. But thinking of Siti Hajar running up the then-hill Safa and Marwah water-searching for her thirsty child, Nabi Ismail a.s., made me persevere.  Alhamdulillah, after that the last bout in umrah practicum, is to cut off  @ least 3 strands of your hair. Some guys opt to shave clean, bald. My hubby reserving it for the next umrah, scheduled the next day.  The difference between Nabawi and Masjidil Haram is, the latter allows common entry for both males and females congregates. But when comes to Fardhu prayers, it will still be segregated.   After my first Maghrib prayers there, I decided to stay till Isyak. I performed my first tawaf sunat, alone. After completing the seventh round, I did the sunat prayer, and tried to give it a go to get near the Kaabah. I got to touch the cloth (kiswah) Kaabah, and like a nutty person, I laid my head near, and heave the nicely scented black material, until one guard came and shouted, 'Hajah, Haram!'  Next attempt was getting near to the Rukun Yamani, where solid part of the Kaabah is revealed. Pushed my way in, and I got to touch and kiss it. I thought it's not so tough after all, but I guess Almighty heard my sayings. My journey to Hajar Aswad was truly an obstacle. I saw a long queue, waiting patiently to get to the Hajar Aswad, but it seems unmoving, and no women at all. I headed straight to the front. After all the sandwiching, I only managed to touch the Black stone, after that I was thoroughly thrown out from the horde. Well, I was still thankful though. God’s willing, I told myself; I will get it other time.  After dinner, my parents introduced to us for ther 1st time to the famous Bin Dawood. Our Ustaz Baharudin, kept nicknaming it the Saudi’s rendition of our Mustafa Centre. My sister and I were salivating at the sights of Baskin Robbins and Haagen Daaz. There is Bodyshop too, tended by all males. Basically shop-tending here is all-male environment. Women, stay at home, tend the house and children, and husband. Mama and papa did all the shopping. Hubby and myself decided we would drop by ourselves some other night.  Another small thing I notice, whether it be in Medina or Mecca, every fardhu prayers will be accompanied with Solat Jenazah. Aren't they the lucky chosen ones to take their last breath in Holy City?  And my dearest hubby, seems can't keep his patience on tasting the famous Ayam Golek. This roasted chicken is really something, compare to ones we have here. For 10 riyal, it comes with 2 pcs of Naan-like bread, and fresh salad of cabbage, carrots, onions and lemon.    June 8th 2004 Tuesday   Hubby and rise 2am to perform our Tawaf Sunat. After completing, hubby told to rest while waiting for Subuh. I was a bit disappointed, because I thought with him around; he could assist me to get my Hajar Aswad. He told me he got it the day before, and I was a bit envious.   I haven't even warmed my butt bit to rest, but I felt a sudden pull, that I stood up and walk straight towards Kaabah. I don't know whether hubby realized my gone or not. But I simply got myself drown in the sea of people. This time round was tougher. 3 times I was thrown off the crowd. The men around do not recognized anymore the presence of women, so I told myself, I had to do it, and do it like a Man. I nudged my way in, my head got sandwiched, managed to released and dived in straight and planted my whole face on the Hajar Aswad.  For minutes, I experience, uber extreme tranquil. There seems to be no commotion behind me. Oh God, it smell so good, and did you hear my prayers?  Scheduled for this day after Asar was our second umrah (miqat in Hubaidiyah). We set off earlier morning, to visit historical parts of Mecca. If you guys know your Sirah well, after Adam and Hawa thrown out from Heaven, after consuming the forbidden Buah Kuldi, they were separated for 40 long years.   Adam in India, Hawa in Jeddah, they reunited again in Jabal Rahmah, one of the pitstops for the day. Single lads are encouraged to hike the Jabal Rahmah, stand infront of the white tower and prayed seeking for their other half.  We got to look-look-and-see-see Arafah, Mina, Muzdalifah, where those who perform Haj stay and perform their Lontar Jamrah. 2nd last stop before the Masjidil Haram And Kaabah Conservatism Museum visit, we got to visit the camel's farm. Got my first creamy taste of camel's milk. And their discharge could be mistaken as pebbles or even kurma basah. Tee hee hee…..  Doing tawaf after Asar was another bout of challenge, because the sun was really wild. Its scorching-heat-summer of 42 degree Celsius. But good thing, the condition of the humidity doesn't activate our sweat glands. So no sticky feeling. For those puteri-lilin, a tip; don’t leave your hotel room without your shades, moisturizer and lip balm. I enhanced my endurance of the heat by dunking lots of laban (yoghurt – Nadec is my favorite brand) and a bottle of pure drinking water mix with Redoxon effervescent daily.  After today's umrah, hubby and papa shaved bald, at the BarBar shop (barber). Hubby, you really look like a fishball head, tee hee hee    June 9th 2004 Wednesday   Set off early to 3rd miqat in Ji'rana to perform 3rd umrah. There used to be a well, which water believes to be miraculous, that could even cure paralysis and blindness. History to be said, Prophet Muhammad discovered the well, by tapping the spot. Unfortunately, by the show of the Almighty's strength, people's misusage of the well, drove the well to utter dryness.  After completing the 3rd umrah, managed to convince my sister to head for Hajar Aswad. This time round escorted by hubby and papa. 3 of us acted like barricade to my sister. I almost got my telekung torn in this process. Since I was infront of my sister and face to face with the Hajar Aswad, hubby asked me to take the first lung. But there was this Indian lady who simply did not want to take her two hands off, until the policeman standing at the multazam ordered her.  It's the same tranquil feeling like I first planted my face onto the pure stone. Right after that, I pushed sister to the front and I believed she’s experiencing the same kind of feeling as me.  Thanks hubby and papa.  Hubby and I attacked Bin Dawood, just the 2 of us this time round. We could not spent much, and the Money Changer seems the only corner to shut for business early. Thus, spent our last few hundred riyals on 2 dozens of tudung from this shop name Abatul Khaleej and a painting of the Masjid Al-Aqsa in Baitulmakdis from a shop run by and Indonesian-Jambi-origin guy who can't spoof his mother toungue.   Later, we sat at its 2nd floor eatery, quenching thirst with limejuice and munching fat fries, with breathtaking Masjidil Haram facing us. Why on earth did we leave our camera?    June 10th 2004 Thursday   The nearest and the 4th miqat Tana'im (just 6km from Masjidil Haram) and marks the 4th umrah we performing.  At that moment we also learnt, one of our jemaah, passed away 2am in the morning. He's an Imam of Masjid An-Nur, near my place. He just completed his sunat prayers and doing his dzikir near the Hajar Aswad. A Bangladeshi janitor discovered him, and fortunately he was wearing our group tag for recognition. He came down here with 3 of his grandchildren, 1 daughter, 1 son, a daughter-in-law and his son's father-in-law.  Atuk Haji Hashim, you will be greatly missed by your loved ones. I will always remember on how strong were you despite being 78 years old, compare to the young fellows, doing the jog during Sa’i. A prose of Al-Fateha for you.  We finally managed to convert our SGD to riyal. Thus, after lunch, I intended to do my own shopping, ONLY around the shops below our hotel. After every fardhu prayers, on the way back to the hotel, I'd always been eyeing on these ankle-cut boots. Finally I got my hands on it. The shopkeeper stated his first price at 60 riyal (SGD30).   Liza: 30 riyal, Halal. Shopkeeper: 55 riyal Liza: 35 riyal Shopkeeper: Laa' Laa'. 50 Halal Liza: 40 riyal, Halal. Shopkeeper: Halal, halal.   I tried the boots, handed him 50 riyal and he mentioned Halal. REMEMBER, don't reply Halal back again when you don't hand exact change. Or else you are implying to them to keep the change. But of course, I learnt this earlier, and said HARAM. He smiled and hesitatingly returned my 10 riyal.  And ever since that day, I was nicknamed PCK.  One thing here, the people practices Makan Berdamai. May it be the shopkeeper and assistants, the janitors in the mosque. They shall sit down either inside or outside the shops or any corner, lay out their spread of food, and eat together-gether. So tantalizing.    June 11th 2004 Friday  It's time for 1-hour tour on foot around Mecca City, lead by Ustaz Salam. Where stood with pride, the Hilton Hotel, was actually a former home of Sayidina Abu Bakar. Again, I question why the Sauds make way this kind of historic for commercialization?  At one part of Masjidil Haram, also denotes first time in history where the known-to-be-fierce Sayidina Umar, embraced Islam, even though minutes before he swore to behead Prophet Muhammad. His own sister embraced Islam, and he was soothed after being a render by his sister, a verse of Al-Quran that states about exactly the same incident.  Another part of Masjidil Haram, ever stood house of Prophet Muhammad and his beloved wife, Siti Khadijah. A few steps outside Masjidil Haram area, is the exact location where Aminah gave birth to Prophet Muhammad. The place has already been wakaf and turn to a library.  After that, we head to the famous Masjid Bendera (or better known as Masjid Kucing), which still undergo some repair/reno works. Facing the Masjid is the famous place for 'melontar' (another term for shopping), Pasar Zinc. Hubby managed to get an Oman jubah for only 10 riyal! And I bought 1 more dozen of tudung..And the ice-cream we savored there, is Power-Gedamak. We walked our way down, and past by Makam Ma’ala, and gave our salam to all those who have rested in peace. The last stop was another mosque, Masjid Jin, which was believed thousands of genies embraced Islam with presence of the Prophet. But don't expect to see genies around, ok.  It's my sole opportunity to perform my Friday prayers in Masjidil Haram. But I missed it. I showered and slept after the foot tour, was not feeling that well. Hubby tried to shook me up, but I was lost to the world. It was BIG REGRET. Only God knows how I feel.  After dinner, hubby and I did our last round of shopping in Bin Dawood. We bought our all-time favorite scent Baraqah from its direct distributor shop Al-Haramain, which goes for 100 riyal (50SGD) only. The earlier shop we patronized offered us 150 riyal. Good savings, right? We went back to the same shop that we bought tudung days back, Abatul Khaleej. This time round I have my hands on its exclusive Abayat (ladies' jubah). Finally I got a pair for myself. We also returned to the Jambi guy shop that we bought the Al-Aqsa painting. This time round bargaining for 10 mini ayat Kursi (for hubby's buddies) and wooden pencil case for SIL.  Had our supper, facing Masjidil Haram again. I really, really hope this set of photos will turn out well. We had limejuice and shrimp broast (bbq+roast) which comes with fat fries, briyani rice and naan.  Last shop-stop before we left Bin Dawood, was the Kingdom of Dates to succumb on our chocolatier mood with the dates. We love the dates coated with dark chocolates. Wish we had gotten more.     June 12th 2004 Saturday   In attempt to see Gua Hira', I hiked the Jabal Nur with less then 10 other folks. 2500m high, all rocky and bit sandy, I wonder how Siti Khadijah to and fro hike it, to send food to her beloved hubby, during his hideout in Hira’ from the Quraisy. I told hubby, if he's the one hiding, he would have died of starvation waiting for me.  I almost gave up innumerable of times. The sun right above my head, with my short stamina on my 2 foot and bad breathing, I questioned myself how possible I would get to the peak? At one point, I even vomited out every single liquid intake I had earlier. That was almost my turning point. Our very super-patient personal guide, from Kashmir, offered his blue hanky, and pulled me almost all the way up. I slowed down and stopped a while. Seeing my papa on top, encouraged me to go faster and further. By the time I got papa, I hugged him and wept like a little girl. He was so worried too, when he didn't see me in his sight.   I rested awhile before heading straight to Gua Hira'. There are lots of cats around, and while I was drinking, a few monkeys tried to snatch my water bottle. Naughty monkeys. The paths to the cave are really narrow. But never too narrow for my BIG volume hubby to past through. Alhamdulillah, this is one day I could never forget. Its berkat of saying lots of selawat. Thank you hubby. And not forgetting, our guide, Hussey Ghazal. 30 riyal as tip for him.  Back at hotel, was luggage-packing time again. Luggage to be outside our room by 10am. What? We're leaving already? So fast.    June 13th 2004 Sunday   At 9am, we gathered to perform our Tawaf Wada (Farewell Tawaf). The last time in front of Kaabah, I said our all my prayers in my typewritten prayer list, which has gone tattered into its many days. I couldn't help feeling all affectingly sad, and me already missing it before leaving. Masyallah. Dear Almighty, I hope You will invite me again to this Holy House of yours. I dearly want to very, very much. Now I could understand all those who 'story' to us, and expressing the repeated desires to go back there again. I am experiencing exactly the same kind of emotions. Farewell Mecca.  Its few minutes shy after 10am when we left for Jeddah, when our plane is only scheduled at 8pm. Well, this is all due to avoid the nasty traffic conditions there. Officials sent off our luggages to airport earlier. Each passenger is granted 30kg limit, not including 10 litre of Zam-zam.   Slightly before noon, we reached Jeddah Holiday Inn, As-Salam. This 5-star hotel is an operation center for Shahidah Travel. My parents got to stay one night during their Haj back in 2000. We had a sumptuous International buffet lunch there. This is one true time we could mingle around, exchange contacts and addresses.   I think I forget to mention earlier, that one of hubby's junior from EVSS, was in our tour group too. He came down with his parents and 2 younger brothers. Coincidentally, he’s my junior in SP, but he was doing Nautical Studies. These 3 brothers were nicknamed 3 Abdul. And the same 3 brothers were after a 19-year-old girl of French-Dutch-Malay descent in our group. Guys will always be guys.  After group pictures, we were treated by Mr Ayoob with gelato-like ice-cream and satay. Hubby and I, spent our last riyals on BIG sheesha (hoga) goes at 150 riyal. It's nicely packec in a standing bag, and the giftshop-owner so sweet to compliment us with one box of apple-flavored tobacco. We also managed to grab buy-5-get-1-free T-shirts, with Camel printed on it, with sayings Mafi Mushkila (No Problem). And lastly not forgetting the semi-contraban items, chewing gum.  After 4pm we boarded the airport transfer to KAA International Airport. Spending few hours in the departure area, obviously bring us to its DFS, Al-Musbah. Shout out to PS2 freaks out there, 10 PS2 going for 100 riyal (50SGD). How about that? That seems low end compare to my next discovery. A soft CK ladies boots, 630 riyals. You count and convert, ok. I still love my 'PCK' leather boots.   Leaving on a jet plane, and here we are heading home again. But I am already missing it.   We stopped by Dubai for one-hour transit, which is only less than 3 hours away from Jeddah. Suddenly, I start feeling the fatigue button activating. Body aching, eyes so sleepy. Strange, I don't feel much of all these before despite only two hours of solid sleep, enduring the very long day that knocks at you at 2.45 am and slumber you off at past midnight.    June 14th 2004 Monday   During the long flight, in between sleep and meals, I wonder what I've brought back with me? Apart from the 6-rolls of film (I should seriously consider a digital camera), built friendships, there are many, many more. It's a place I feel nearer to Him, and I hope this nearness remain though I'm back in my homeland. It’s one memory, I feel I really, really talk to Him, and He hears me, and show me His presence and strength. I think no words can ever describe. But all these will forever engrave in my heart. Thank you God, for inviting this little, humble one to such a splendid home of Yours.   12.15pm (SG time), touched down Singapore. Farewell hugs and kisses to all those friends I found in this meaningful trip. I saw my two flower girls and MIL waiting outside the arrival hall.   Well, I guess its Home Sweet Home, but I hope this episode will have its many, other sequels, if God's willing.

      Many do complain of indigestion.  urlLink She  complains of it when consume banana. While me will suffer from it when having *too* much rice. That's why I kind of avoid it. Hubby always overcome his indigestion by drinking Ginger-O, very, very pure ginger extract. No tea, no yum-yum, no moo-juice. Suppa-Pure.   Do you exactly know how long it takes to digest various foods?   This is taken from some old encyclopedia.   Rice ............... 1 hour  Milk (raw) ......... 1 1/4  Milk (not raw) ..... 2  Apples ............. 1 1/2  Eggs (raw) ......... 1 1/2  Eggs (boiled) ...... 3  Beef (roast) ....... 3  Bread .............. 3 1/4  Carrots (boiled) ... 3 1/4  Butter ............. 3 1/2  Cheese ............. 3 1/2  Fowl (roast) ....... 4  Cabbage ............ 4 1/2   Hmmmmm ... it seems uncooked food takes shorted to digest. So go raw?       Greek Melt      total time: 25 minutes | makes 2 sandwiches  This is my 1st sandwich recipe using Pita bread, and using Feta cheese, Greek's white cheese. You could pick up Feta cheese in major stores like Cold Storage (recommends: Railway Mall & King Albert branches because of its very wide cheese range).  The beauty of this sandwich is that it can be knife-and-fork affair (putting the toppings on top of the flat pita itself) or, a movable feast by putting the fillings in the pita.  1 pint of cherry tomatoes, halved 1 tbsp of olive oil 1 tsp of salt 4 ounces of Feta cheese 2/3 cup of plain yoghurt Juice of 1/2 lemon 2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced 1/4 tsp of chili flakes (like the ones they have in Pizza Hut) 10 ounce of cleaned Spinach (Popeye's strength food! 2 pitas  Pre-heat oven to 200 degree celcius. Toss the tomatoes with 1 tbsp of olive oil and 1/4 tsp of salt. Arrange the tomatoes cut-side up, on a baking sheet. Bake until they are just softened, which may took about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the Feta, yoghurt, lemon juice and 1/4 tsp of salt. Set aside.  Place a medium skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 tbsp of olive oil over to the skillet. Add the garlic and chili flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is softened and just turning golden. Add the spinach and remaining salt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the spinach is just wilted, about 4 minutes.  Place the pitas in the oven and heat until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes per side. Then fill/top cooked spinach and baked tomatoes in/on pitas and drizzle with yoghurt-Feta sauce.

      A fellow friend went away to States, and spent almost a year of his life as a New York-er. Except he simply bummed around. Good life, don't you think? Well, not exactly. He left our sunny island   to recoup back his spirit after losing a very loved one in a plane crash.   Ok, I am not going to spin sad stories here. More of something this friend picked up while he was there. Like calling potatoes as 'murphy' and milk as 'moo juice'  . I happened to recently did some 'research' reading, and 'bang' on a bank of American diner slangs. Share with you all some.   Adam's ale ............... Plain water (over here, sometimes we call 'sky juice')  wreck 'em ................ scrambled eggs  on wheels ................ take-out (ta-pao)  haemorrhage .............. ketchup  sea dust ................. salt  belch water .............. soda water  bucket of hail ........... glass of ice  yum-yum/sand.............. sugar  java/joe ................. coffee  life-preserver ........... donut  breath ................... onions  looseners ................ prunes  hounds on an island ...... sausage on beans  shingles with a shimmy ... toast and jam  2 cows, make them cry .... 2 hamburgers with onions  burn the British ......... toasted muffins  wreath ................... cabbage  Eve with a lid on ........ apple pie (think of America Pie movie, hahah!)  lumber ................... toothpick  mike & 'ike/side-arms .... salt &amp; pepper  no cow ................... without milk  a squeeze ................ orange juice  warts .................... olives  axle grease .............. butter   'I would like to order  shingles with shimmy . Errr could you spread a bit of  axle grease  on the toast. And could I have a bowl of salad with generous  wreath  and tomato. Make sure there's no  breath  because I abhor the smell and taste of it. I will have my cup of  joe  decaf, with  no cow . Oh, I will stir the  yum-yum  in it myself.'       Vietnamese Steak Sandwich       total time: 20 minutes | makes 3 sandwiches  This is actually an adapted recipe which I slightly modified.   1 6-ounce steak meat about 1 inch thick 1 tsp of Thai chili sauce (Maggi brand) 4 tsp of sugar 1 1/2 tsp of fish sauce (Knife brand, promote my co's prod) 1 tsp of minced garlic 1 cup Apple Cider Vinegar (Heinz brand, original suggestion is to use rice wine) 1 medium carrot, cut into matchsticks 1/2 medium green bell pepper, thinly sliced 4 tbsp of low-fat mayo (Bestfood) 1 baguette from Delifrance, sliced horizontally 6 sprigs of Chinese parsley (can get from Pasar)  Pre-heat oven to 225 degree celsius. Place the steak on a bowl. Add chili sauce, sugar, fish sauce and garlic, and marinate well. Set aside.   Place vinegar in saucepan over medium heat. Toss the carrots and bell pepper in. Cook for a while, remove from heat and set aside.   Place the steak in the oven and cook around 6 minutes per side (medium rare). Meanwhile spread the mayo on the baguette. Heat the open baguette with mayo-side up until mayo melts and baguette turns crispy.  Cut the steak into 3/4 inch-thick slices. Fill the baguette with the cooked vegetable and steak, and top with Chinese parsley. Sliced the baguette into 3 and serve.  2 down, 5 more to go!

      Approximate calories burnt each minute when:   *just* Sitting still (Wahhh) ..... 1-2  Snooker .......................... 2-6  Housework (my most-ly exercise) .. 3-6  Golf ............................. 3-6  Cricket .......................... 3-7  Fencing .......................... 4-6  Gymnastics ....................... 4-6  Yoga ............................. 4-6  Badminton ........................ 5-6  Brisk walking .................... 5-8  Aerobics ......................... 5-9  Ping-pong (Table-tennis) ......... 6-7  Sex (Hihih...) ................... 6-11  Swimming ......................... 6-12  Skipping ......................... 7-9  Dancing .......................... 7-10  Tennis ........................... 7-12  Football ......................... 7-13  Jogging .......................... 8-13  Squash ........................... 8-13   These figures are approximates and will vary depending on a number of factors. For e.g. in gymnastics depends on the vigorisity and golf should count in the factor like the weight of the clubs.   From calories-burner activities, we shall go to good-calories food. We are talking about SANDWICHES here  . My MOST FAVORITE packed-meal, because it's the easiest meal ever. Stuffed, grilled, fried or baked. No matter how you slice it, SANDWICHES are a quick, satisfying solution for any meals. They're simple to make, kids-friendly, and always a hit. You don't have to limit SANDWICHES to ONLY lunchtime. When it comes to dinner issues, what should matter to most of us -- ease of preparation, a healthy, well-balanced plate -- the midday staple might just be the perfect rush-hour solution. I know, I know. Asians, typically wants to see rice on their plate as staple need. But you know me. Very un-favorite of eating rice.   If you need convincing, I think start today, and a few days onwards, I shall share a few SANDWICH, handheld meals in this blog, that should do the trick. Perhaps next time if people ask, "What's for dinner?", just tell them: LUNCH.       Salmon Club with Avocado Butter     total time: 15 minutes      | makes 2 sandwiches   Salmon is my hubby's FAVORITE-est of all fish, and FAVORITE-est eaten raw. Not for me though. And I love my sandwich to be either on 9-cereal or Light-Rye bread. You can kindly pick up both from Delifrance, and kindly request the loaf to be slice.   1 ripe avocado, pitted and peeled  Juice from half a lemon  2 tbsp of unsalted  pepper  butter  1 tsp of grinded oregano leaves ( kapur  from co ... yet again)  1 1/4 tsp of salt  1 8-ounce salmon fillet, sliced into 3/4-inch pieces  6 slices of 9-cereal/Light-Rye bread  1 1/2 cups of lettuce   Place avocado, lemon juice, butter, oregano and 3/4 spoon of salt in a food processor (blender). Pulse until nearly smooth, about 30 seconds. Set aside.   Place a medium nonstick skillet (fry-pan) over medium heat. Coat with a bit of cooking oil. Sprinkle the salmon with the remaining salt and place in heated skillet. Cooked about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.   Assemble 2 sandwiches, using 3 slices of bread per sandwich. Alternate the bread, avocado butter, salmon and lettuce. Could secure with toothpicks before serving.   Happy Trying! Tomorrow another SANDWICH recipe!

      Take a hike of the latest I sent to my PHLOG. It was almost 3am and I am still wide alive as 'Onnie the Owl'  . Hahah!  Mana punya fictitious character aje aku invent ni . After sending the message, I did some sweeping in our bedroom   and kitchen. I was tempt to vacuum, but I guess that would shake the whole of block 528.     Still can't blink off. I played boring games from my hp, then I played 'Bowling' from hubby's hp. Surprisingly 'dead log' hubby was awaken by that. Funny. He could be lulled to the louder sounds of the radio  . And complained to the harmless tunes from the hp games.   On the top of my head, this could be the work of the vinegar. No good. My insomnia days suppose to be long over. I don't want to revert back to those days where I had to make doctor visits to 'beg' prescriptions of valium/lorenpazam for the sack of beauty zZzZzzz.   I managed to doze off a little while though. A short one but with a still-fresh-on-mind reverie  . In that dream, I met a fellow blogger, and she clearly mentioned to me she was a FIREFIGHTER  . fu-wahhhhh... Guess! Guess who is the lucky blogger. Siapa betul dapat hadiah!     Back about insomnia, I just feel like relating to one movie   I'd ever watched from the cable channel.  Dream for an Insomniac . Many would rate it as a 'weak-plot' movie. Fans of Jennifer Aniston could see her in her early days (though she's not the main character). Basically the story tells about a dreamer who can't sleep (insomniac). She leads a lonely life until she meets the boy of her dreams. The boy happened to walk in as a new employee in the coffee house she works in.   I remembered on particular 'sweet' scene, the boy actually offered to accompany her whole night, spent chatting. But 'sweet' enough he dozed off. She was on high hopes to hitch with this sweet boy, especially after having impossibly high standards for her love and fears that will never meet a worthy man. But was undaunted when she discovers he has a live-in girlfriend. Thus she made her way to LA, with her friend (Jenifer Aniston).   The ending was all sweetness. She finally locked in a 'hearty' sleep  . Shhhhh ... I won't tell you how she manages. Go and check it out on VT/VCD/DVD yourselves. Exactly, the 'remedy' my GP ever mentioned to me. Hihihihi ....

      Last time, I was never caught off back with anything  purple /ish. Ironically, I had a  purple  jeans, which I think it's the most 'oh-bit' garment I had in my wardrobe during my early teens. I remember ONLY wearing it a FEW times ONLY at night-outing to get it unnoticeable. Somehow I overcome my skepticism against this 'Barney' colour. You see, now  purple  simply doesn't come in boring  violets  or  grape -likes. There are tints of  lavender ,  lilac  which are ... errr ... simply purplish!   I wore  purple   songket  during my  sanding . I splashed the whole of my dining/living/bedrooms with  lavender . And what else? I am hunting for  purple  pillows to 'throw' at my upcoming daybed.   MORE  PURRRRR-PEARRRRRLLL !!!!!       Anybody spot a Manolos?   But the one I am currently falling-in-love-and-dying-to-get is the one right at the bottom,  urlLink the jelly strappy sandal in lavender vinyl frosted .   Aiyoyo ... don't tell me I am going for another round of shoe-buying.

      This is specially dedicated to  urlLink Mas . I feel sorry that she actually bought Apple Cider Vinegar (Heinz) that is thoroughly meant for cooking and baking. Mas, no worries. You can 'engine-search' the many uses of your bottle of Heinz.       (From left)A bottle of the 'Wonderful' Dr Apple's Apple Cider Vinegar(550ml), A bottle of natural 'Multi Floral' Honey(1.5kg) to compliment the 'wonderfulness' taste of the vinegar, 'Them' awaiting for me to consume *yikes!*   FYI, the price of the vinegar plus the honey is 35 dollars. Hubby ring-ring a certain hotline number to place order. And the fellow will deliver right to your doorstep. But there is a minimum quantity posed.   A bottle of vinegar plus a bottle of honey should last me for a month with once per daily consumption. But with the rate I am going (skipping, mixing in very little vinegar), it might take me months. Mas, perhaps you want to share, my share.

      Ok, ok. The Brazilians   bag the Copa America, despite no * players. Whether it's Argentinians   or them, I couldn't care less. But, the fact that I care, why must it end up in a penalty shoot-out (after 2-2 final score).   Now, Here I am almost droning, not only because of the till-early-morning-up, but because I have yet to get over being smitten by Orlando Bloom in Pirates of Carribean  . I felt like I am 'falling in love all over' again, as similar as I did when he's Legolas in LOTR trilogy. Tihihihihihi..... Johnny Depp's good too and he carried his scripts superbly well. "Because I am Captain Jack Sparrow....."     urlLink Real Simple 's August edition is already out in the library. And I can't help but sharing more of these stuffs.     solutions   | NEW USES FOR OLD THINGS      Double-Duty Pantry Items    rolling pin    ORIGINAL USE:   Rolling dough   AHA! USE:  Instant nut chopper. Put a handful of nuts&nbsp; in a plastic bag, then run over with rolling pin.   REWARD:  Take out your aggression on walnuts, pecans and peanuts.    cake stands    ORIGINAL USE:   showcasing your bakings triumph   AHA!

USE:  Tomato ripener. Apples emit ethylene, which helps tomatoes ripen faster that they would on their own.&nbsp; (Hmmm, I remembered somewhere in my  urlLink House-Wise  tip using apple to prevent potato-budding.

But let me tell you bought-from the shelf ones usually taste  stale . Fresh made ones are wonderful. Anyway squeezing and stirring a little lemon into it,&nbsp;will eliminates the browning that occurs when guacamole sits. Perhaps, I should call my good, old colleague, Ms Mabel to share recipe of the best-est and fresh-est guacomole I'd ever tasted.

      Last Saturday was another 'spree' of Nasi Lemak. Changi-Village-NOT. MIL cooked it, the 'old-fashion' way. Why the definition of 'old-fashion' because the new generation, like my sister's idea of Nasi Lemak, is a must-must have fried chicken/wings and normal omelette comes in a form of sunny-side up.  I actually miss 'those days' Nasi Lemak that comes in small packets wrap with banana leaves on top of old newspaper  . I remembered watching my ma in the morning wee hours doing it, to be sold to fellow workers in nearby factory. Going at 50 cents/packet, that humbly contained the 'rich' rice, sambal, triangular-cut omelette, and alternate with either ikan selar or anchovies+peanuts.  Back 2 MIL's Nasi Lemak. I am a real 'sucker' for her Sambal Tumis. Its super, duper HOT  , that can drove me to sheer tears, but its super REFRESHING that I always ask for more.   'Camping' @ PIL's went on fine. We hit Central, which as ever, endlessly crowded. Mak Jah and Pak Mat was looking for a new rice-cooker. From Metro, to Isetan, to Best Denki, still no rice-cooker. Instead, they bought for us a belated housewarming gift, a deep-fryer. Hmmmmm I was thinking more of my favorite home-made breaded fish&chips with no grease splattering around.  In the end, Mak Jah settled with the Tiger rice-cooker @ Isetan. Exactly same model as ours. It seems Tiger brand is his family-favourite brand of rice-cooker. My MIL, his aunties, his cousins all are proud owners of Tiger brands. It's undeniably good, because No 1, its durability. Most of their Tigers aged almost 10 years. Gee, ours still a baby, only 4 months old. No 2, after 3 days, cooked rice in Tiger, still as good as fresh. And there is nothing like 'kerak-kerak', thus easy to wash it spiffy clean. Perhaps let me put it to a 7 days test, yahhhhh.  So much for the weekend, finally we are back in the comfy of our humble shack. Ahhhhh ... I love it. The bathroom is still freshly scented after my Saturday-morning scrub. I'd actually used up almost a whole bottle of our favorite essential oil,  Calm Oil Home Fragrance  Calm Water Home Fragrance Oil to use as  urlLink scented final rinse  on the bathroom's vanity top and kitchen's top. So hubby, please remind me to grab those from BodyShop, or else you claim you won't be able to do your 'sole proprietor business'   in soothing, serene, pristine environment. Hahahhh!  I could see from here that hubby seems bored because he kept changing channels. We were done with X-men earlier. And his favorite 'Metropolitan' had such a shock ending. So I just shouted to hubby,  "Pirates of Carribean?!" "OK!"  Time to catch-up on bought-but-unwatch DVDs *nearing Monday morning?*.

      Is it the work of the  urlLink apple cider ? I don't know. But last night, I was exceptionally so energetic. After the beefy dinner, I 'stripped' my beddings, change to fresh ones, and send the dirty ones to the washing machine, which usually I do ONLY on weekends.   While waiting for the washing to be done, I still have the  semangat  to do potato wedges from scratch (RE-READ: from scratch).   Well, it's not that I grow the potatoes myself or what. Actually thanks to  urlLink kak ann  for sharing my cousin's (her dh) favorite potato recipe in one of her entries that day. Well not exactly outcome like hers, because I lack some of the ingredients, and add-on my own ingredients.   My Potato Wedges     5 russet potatoes, cleanse, cut wedge-like (leave the skin), cleanse some more. Pour onto the wedges: - 2 tbsp of olive oil - 1 tbsp of dill weed  - 1 tbsp of seasoned salt - 2 tbsp of blackpepper powder (put more if prefer spicier) - 1 tsp of white pepper powder - 2 dried basil leaves (kak ann, yours using chopped ones is it?)  FYI, all the above ingredients, except for potatoes and olive oil I errrm...  kapur  from my company. Muahahahaha....  Mix all ingredients well. Pre-heat conventional oven around 5 minutes before hand to 225 degree celcius. A tip, before putting your wedges on the baking sheet. Lay aluminium foil on it, to avoid overworking on the grease later. So lay your wedges neatly on it, and send it off to bake for like 30 minutes or so. Perhaps, different ovens may vary in temperature and cooking time.  So half-way through The Apprentice   last night, hubby and I were gayly enjoying the nice home-made, from-the-scratch wedges. Today, hubby intend to grab 2 bags of russet potatoes and ask me to do it to bring to PIL tomorrow. WARGGGHHHHH!

      It's not end of the month yet. And it's not the beginning either. And what was I doing?  SHOPPING . During lunchtime  . I was  ONLY  supposed to rob some bank, de-rob some bank, pay some bills and develop some photos. But I just added one more activity,  FOOTWEAR-SHOPPING .   I can't resist it,&nbsp;but my 'good&nbsp;friends' at  NODA , my favorite footwear store, seems 'waving-waving-and-calling-calling' me. I love the designs-and-styles of this Japan-origin store, and things I got from there are really comfortable that I over-use-and-wear it. Before to-date, I had 2 bags, 1 slip-in sandals and 1 slip-in slippers from there. And today, I saw one, nice   bronzey  , heel-ed flip-flops. With my member card, I told myself ' Heck-lah ' I can get 10% percent discount from the mere original pricetag of less than 30 bucks. But my roaming eyes simply didn't stop there! I tried on a   bronzey  , strappy flip-flops which cost less than 10 buck after the 10% off! What's all these craze with  bronze  colour man?   Well, I did told hubby sometime ago I want to shoe-shop for a decent pair of working shoes. His idea will be something  Everbest / Renoma -ish. But hey, did I tell you that I wear slippers/sandals most of the time to office? So now I'd just happily left  NODA  not only with the shopping items, but some  NODA  shopping vouchers. Does that mean, some more footwear shopping in very near future?  NO !!!!! In fact these ones, I am temporarily 'hiding' it in the office, and 'gradually' will wear it after one fine office hour. To prevent it from getting too noticeable&nbsp;from hubby's eyes.     ~~~   I would have gotten further with my 'spendthrift', if I could not resist myself from the Japanese fair   in Westmall. You know all those  Meiji  stuffs like the  choc -filled biscuits, marshmallows,  candies  etc  . But I am pretty phobiac from one experience of these kind of fairs when I bought, I thought pretty decent cheese-crackers  . Only later I realised it contained beef extracts.  Nauzubillah ..... tu zaman dahulukala, masih jahiliah,&nbsp; entah halal ke haram, main sondol ajer .   So I simply walked myself away slowly from the fair.   ~~~   The self-help photo-develop machine in Westmall is not good. They only offer express 1 hour service or normal 1 day service. They simply one to ' ketuk ' 5 bucks per CD on top of 40 cents per piece. Unlike the one in CP, you have another option to develop your own self and get the photos on the spot. Even if you opt for the express/normal service its 4 bucks per CD. Waste my  current ajer .

      We used to sleep-over   at PIL's regularly, once a fortnight before the BIG Move. Ever since then, I barely need my 5-fingers to count the number of sleep-overs (but hey, have to give us some credit because we shifted in barely 5 months). Well, its either:   - We are enjoying too much the comfort of having own home, privacy and all.  - We push major house chores to weekend, so we are VERY occupied.  - We are filled with Sunday activities like weddings and all.   I actually kind of miss sleeping-over there. Even though hubby and I had to 'seek refuge' in the living room (my PIL's a 3-roomy), we don't mind at all. A weekend there means filled with visiting his next-door aunt and playtime with his lil' nieces. There were occasional after-midnight-hunting of mangoes around Tampines (police Alert-NOT, please) neighbourhood with hubby, PIL and PIL's fun-loving neighbors. At times, in the wee of night, when hunger suddenly pang on us, we will just hop on and drive for suppers at Changi Village or Simpang Bedok. And not forgetting the  'makan angin'  session usually after supper, either @ Changi Beach or @ outside runways of Changi Airport, to&nbsp;catch the thrills of&nbsp;planes take-off with bags of  kuah-chee .     During sleep-overs there too, means, after Sunday morning wake-ups  , usually it's fun-marketing between MIL & DIL at Tampines's  pasar bulat (near Al-Ameen). I will be pampered with my favorite  tauhui/chinchau  drink and  kuih keria . And normally we ta-pao breakfasts like prata/thosai. Unless the guys are 'hardworking' enough, then we will  brekkie  down there itself.   We do invite PIL to sleep-over @ ours. So far they only did twice. But we sense very well, they will miss their Tampinesian gang. Basically, in Woodlands the mood seems only reserve for eat, watch TV/DVD/VCD, chit-chat&nbsp;and sleep. Perhaps the mood will be better if we have 'little ones' running around. Hahahhh!   Anyway, this coming Saturday, most probably we are sleeping-over @ PIL's, not merely normal-visiting, sleep-over, ok! After such a long-hiatus-of-sleep-over, since before we went off for umrah. Aren't I such a dear DIL? Hihihih ...

        Having trouble with dough sticking on your rolling pin?   Before using, keep the rolling pin in the freezer. (Apply for both plastic/wooden pin? Hmmmmm ..... got metal pin mehhh?)  Put a small piece of bread   insider cookie jar to help keep your baked goods fresh longer.    Put a box of baking soda (expose) in the fridge and freezer for odour control.  Ever get those stains on your tupperware/containers that contain chilli/tomato-based sauces? Spray them with non-stick cooking spray before pouring in sauce.      I'd personally experience this because I am a celery lover. I usually buy one big plastic of celery that can last me for a week for my salad and juices. But I'd realise that after 4 days the vege turns bit soggy-ish, despite storing in the fridge. My House-Wise solution, wrap celery in aluminium foil, put in the fridge --- it will keep for weeks!  Poke an egg with a very fine sewing needle before hard-boiling. The egg will peel with ease. REMEMBER - poke it, not crack it, ok.    Another hard-boiling egg tippy. Add a pinch of salt before boiling to prevent cracking.  To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in the bag of potatoes.      To get the most juice out of fresh lemons, bring them to a room temperature and roll them under your palm against the kitchen counter before squeezing. You can also insert and twist a fork in the lemon while squeezing the juices out.  If you accidentally over-salt a dish while it's still cooking, drop in a peeled potato. It absorbs the excess salt for an instant "fix-me-up"!  To determine egg's freshness, immerse it in a pot of cool, salted water. If it sinks, it's fresh. If it rises to the surface, throw it away larrrrr.....  Always breathe through your mouth, never your nose to prevent crying when peeling onions. Wahhhhh, this one never try, but normally I put on my specs when chopping onions/chilli stuffs. Occasionally, I will 'cry'.   And my dear homemaker mommy's tip is to go and wash my feet. Strange enough, it works lehhhh...

       An  apple  a day keeps the doctor away       &nbsp;  How about a hot mug of  apple  cider vinegar drink a day?  &nbsp;  It's been one week, hubby puts me on a 'torture' with it ever since I constantly fell asleep halfway in-front of the TV. Since it's a 'rare' condition of me like that, Dr Hubby 'diagnoses' I could be suffering from 'chronic fatigue'. Sheeez, its sounds so serious like I am suffering from chronic bronchitis. Analysing further causes, it could be due to my workstress, perpetual weight-gaining, bad diet, lack of vitamins.....  &nbsp;  So, Dr Hubby's remedy recommendation is the *yuckies*  urlLink Apple Cider Vinegar    . Every night after dinner, now, Dr Hubby ritually, mix a tbsp of the vinegar and a tbsp of  honey    into one mug of warm water. It takes me almost 1/2 hour to sip to the concentrated liquid down my throat.  &nbsp;  So we shall see the results of the consumption in the coming future.  &nbsp;  Ohhh NO! Here comes Dr Hubby with a mug of 'it'. Help, help!

      All 6 of us, Papa, Mama, Brother, Sister, Hubby &amp; I went out together in need some fresh air to overcome the weekday stales. But mainly, we meant it for Mama, to smoothen out her recuperating period. Thinking of it, the last time we went out with full strength of us 6, was last Eiduladha.  &nbsp;  Since the 2 madames of the 2 households justifiably let to surrender their pots and pans, we decide to had early lunch at the most-talk-eatery-at-nook-of-Geylang-Serai Hajah Maimunah. I am not exactly a fancy of rice-as-staple-food diet, but I really took a fancy on its roasted chicken and sambal cockles. I better at least enjoy it, after sheer surviving of its horrenduously long Q and in scavenge for that decent table of 6.  &nbsp;  After the lunch, we X-over to Joo Chiat complex with Mama in hunt for that perrrrrfect rug for the room. Hubby managed to grab the 'magic   charcoal  ' for his sheesha activities. And brother ..... I have to start on a new paragraph for this .....  &nbsp;  He bought an ointment, Minyak Firdaus, to boost growth of moustaches and beards. That is such an amazing discovery for me. He wants to grow a goatee as a significant to proclaim his independence of NS. Better show me the result...  &nbsp;  Sister and I hit the 'Musical Records'. Sister managed to get her hands on the 'Budak Dini' latest album, while I was disappointed that the super-unfriendly-plus-faggodish-salesman-with-cutting-like-that-budak-apis-glam simply told me that the i-look-i-look-i-see album is no more. Yet, I wasted my 10 bux on that PHSM vcd, which is so disappointingly unscary. But I fell in love with its theme song, that I keep humming to it 'scarily'.  &nbsp;  The weather was so fine that later on, we were positive to hit the Pasir Ris Beach/Park. Not exactly having a picnic, but we did lay out our picnic mat, and bring out the 'picnic basket' of kueh we bought from Hajah Maimunah. We grabbed bottles of drinks and ice-cream from a nearby to succumb into some cooling in the midst of the heat.  &nbsp;  With Mr Good Wind blowing, we decided to bring out the kite. Many kite-flyers were green-eyed, seeing our Last Kite Flying, not tangled at all to the trees. Must see hor ..... who the expert kite-flyer ..... The Hubby.    &nbsp;  Brother met up with some of his sea-activities friends, who were training some novices on canoeing and sailing. Brother said, they offered us free tries on the canoe and sailing boat. But we skipped the idea lookin at us geared, unprepared to be very wet. But I managed to kick some saltwater plus sand towards hubby, in revenge to his attempt to throw me and sister into the water.  &nbsp;  At the children's playground, I was hoping to hop on the 'mini wired flying fox'. But with the visible  WARNING   sign against adults to hop on it, I simply had to drop the idea. Furthermore, there were so many kiddies around, and I don't think I want to invite spectators to my intention.     &nbsp;   So after that, we settled down to some bicycle-riding action. We had so much fun, till we were hungry again. We packed up, left the place, and head to Changi Village, to ta-pao nasi lemak. Our favorite stall was closed, so we settled with another stall, the few recommended by Makansutra. Yet, its taste doesn't enliven our tastebuds. Last dash, before we left CV, managed to grab 6 packets of fresh sugarcane juice with  lemon  to quench our thirst throughout the journey back to Woodlands.     &nbsp;   While, I'm typing this, hubby is heavily engaged on the television with the running of PGA: British Tour 'LIVE'. Thank God, it's the last day today. He has been over-feeding me with golf jargons like  green , approach, rough, backspin, which yeah ... do not sound jargon. He even handed out his first golf handbook which was written by that famous 'living brand' Arnold Palmer. Well, for now I finally understand what is birdie putt and boogey.

      I am pretty 'inspired' to write  urlLink    about this after having  conversations of this with few pals. I know I can be dimly judge  urlLink    for this whole write-up. But these are all facts, and what say you?  Two of them are faced with quite different but pretty same problems. One is single, and her parents are heavily dependable on her, despite having other stable children. The other is married, and both her parents n PIL are heavily dependable on her and spouse.  The depicted scenario above is what they claim a typical Asian Parents. You know; bring-up the children, look through children's education, children grow up and start career, working children contribute money to parents, and children look after parents in their old age.  Versus Western Parents, parents make children save up for their college, children go to college, parents 'kick' their children out to get their own apartment when they  urlLink    graduate/start their career (normally 21 years above), and both parents and children go on with life independently.  Well, conventionally as a child, I think we are responsible to look after our parents. Our society, or rather our gahmen policies, do not go in par for us to observe Western Parents styles. No 1, our gahmen allows only 35-years above to purchase a flat single-handedly. Well, you have renting options. But if every Singaporean parents 'kick' out their Singaporean child out of the house, mind you, land is scarce here.  No 2, our gahmen doesn't encourage a 60-year old and above to stay alone in own home due to health/safety reasons. Well, gahmen offers those studio homes, but still it's an unpopular choice of habitat for the senior citizens.  You can call me a typical, married child. Get married, hunt for your 'own' nest, and shift-out. The reasons, apart from the normal-want-to-be-independent; to make space of my parents' place for my siblings, to make space for future offsprings in new home and to have own privacy space for ourselves (yours truly and spouse).   urlLink    And I am glad to have pretty independent parents, as in not heavily depending on me in terms of financial, household-tending etc. With the flat fully paid-off, school-years left only for lil' sister, long-time savings and investments, God's willing, my parents can retire comfortably.  I hope to be like them too. I believe as  urlLink    parents, in nowadays-time, we should plan ahead, for better of our children and of course old-age. Of course there are macro environment factors that can 'bite' us, like health problems. And it's pretty touting to accept the fact medical bills in our lion-city can come up to. Health is *really-really* Wealth.   In some cases *the vice-versa of Western Parents*, parents here are 'kicked' out by the children. So indeed it's a smarter choice, for parents to own their own property to avoid this social problem. But still, if you have your own and live your way up to 60, alone, then you will be brought back to gahmen policy no 2.  *SIGH*  urlLink    I know, I know. There are much more problems than that, many different cases. Well, can we just say we leave it all to Him? We plan, He decides.

       urlLink    Lately, I realise that the most 'active' part of our house is our living room. The L-room has been practically the most 'comfort' zone for us to do almost anything around there (excl. bathroom and kitchen activities) e.g. ironing, reading.  Just last night *almost every night* we had dinner *plus other meals* in the L-room, in-front of the TV. Poor dining table abandon. It's pretty routine every night. If I cook dinner, we shall have early dinner, in the L-room in front of TV, clean-up, shower than perform our maghrib and isyak. Otherwise, if not cooking (e.g. ta-pao, complimentary from mama/mil), we will have late dinner after isyak, but still in the L-room in-front of TV.    urlLink    Is this healthy? *shrugs*  urlLink    I hope things will be different by the time our day-bed (mama calls it kerusi ambin) and coffee table comes in.

      Last night, I *finally* successfully discarded 12 tudungs of mine. They are either overworn or non-match to my current wearable clothings. I didn't realise that my drawer of tudungs has gone overloaded, until hubby complained that a few of my tudungs had seeked 'refuge' to the lower drawer containing his socks  urlLink   , singlets, shorts  urlLink    and boxers. Hmmmmm... that solves the mystery of my 'missing tudungs'.  I've divided the drawer space into two halves; one for 'lasak'-wearing tudungs (e.g. nearby places, marketing), the other reserves for new/current tudungs suitable for my working wear and outings. I've further sub-divided the plains and prints. I am very particular in matching my tudungs against my apparel, just like matching my footwear  urlLink    against my carrier. Very least likely you will catch me wearing prints top to bottom. Actually, having all plain is the safest. I believe this is the vainest you all ever heard of me.  The last group of tudungs I have I shall call it the 'glamour' tudungs.You know, the typical sequined/glittered ones, that's only suitable with your glamourous/exclusive kebayas, baju kurungs, pantsuits or abayats. All these I hung along with my shawl/dupeta in the wardrobe.  After spending solid two hours on 'tudung spree-cleaning' while waiting for AR, I am quite relieved. But still bothered with the remaining of Her clothes, His clothes and beddings in the storeroom. SHOUT out to him, "We've been procastinating way too long for that ideal wardrobe!!!"  ~~~  From tudungs, the word hijab will come across some's mind. Recently, my company's despatchman, Pakcik Wahid, 'present' me a book titled, 'Tuntutan Muslimah: Berpakaian, Berhias & Bergaul'. I find the book serves a very good guide for someone who intends to hijab-ified, or already hijab-ified. Easiest saying, it's a book dedicated to whole of Muslim women. In summary, the book explains on how a Muslim women should dress-up, beautify themselves and the appropriate ethics in socialising in various groups and people, based on Al-Quran  urlLink    verses and Hadith. Comes in 208 pages but is so portable due to its being pretty pocket-sized.

      Tomorrow and 2 months down the road, kick off the money-making season of my company. It's the 7 Month Festival (better known as Hungry Ghost Festival  urlLink   ) Promotion. At this time also you will see more giant-red-candles, money-paper-burning, red-pails-with-goodies-on-auctions around. And of course after this, comes the merriment of the Lantern/Mooncake Festival *i loike*.  During this season, indeed my company operates in 'sheer madness', but everybody seems to avoid working late nights in office. Its 'taboo-ish'; they believe spirits roaming around this place during the 7th Month *goosebumps*.  urlLink     Even though for that fact, there were inevitable times I had to work late *alone*. Normally, I shall plugged in my Creative speakers to my CD player, and blasted the music off *really* loud. Without that 'noise', seriously it's 'dead' silent and 'frustating' sounds coming from some nooks. Why I call it frustating? Because one night, frustatingly I was 'desperate' to know the source of the 'frustating' sounds. And it's frustating to find it's the FAX MACHINE  urlLink    'soft-peep-peep-teet-teet' sounds.  So, then onwards, I eliminate the feeling of fear to stay-back in the office alone.  Talking about ghost-ghost, I feel like putting my eyes on that movie 'PHSM'. Errrrr ... you people figure out larrr. I find the title too un-nice to be typewritten here. My karma tells me it's worth to catch because it's director's name is Shuhaimi Baba.   One strange thing, hubby has been bugging me to catch another ghost-ghost on cinema, The Sisters. It must be the low-seasons of good shows running, that he has to suggest his most unfavorite theme. Well mat-labah-labah  urlLink    and hairy-potek  urlLink    still running, yet he insists to wait on the DVD.   Next thing, I want to check my tix stubs, what's our last movie? Fifty First Dates?! May Fifteenth Two Thousand Four! That's been two months!

       Neighbors   4 months residing in the new abode, we have yet to be pose with problems with people we call neighbors.  But I am particularly concern with one particular door of our neighbors. Did I mention DOOR?  urlLink    Yes.   1. This particular neighbor's door is facing our door.  2. Their door has traces of red paint splashes  urlLink   , an 'artwork' clearly represents the people we call 'tailong'.  3. To avoid further 'artwork', they 'cloth' the door with plastic sheet, clad along with a Letter of Notice from the police  urlLink    that their unit is under camera surveillance.  4. So far our Door is undisturbed. But should any same case happen to us, we won't contemplate to report to the police and 'cloth' our door.  5. So far, the splashing has ceased. BUT the 'tailong' are still showing off their 'artwork' all over the walls on our level plus all the pillars at our voideck; stating our neighbor's unit, the amount they owe and other unknown chinese characters (which I believe it to be some warning statements). Poor the janitors had to clean up the 'artwork'.  The occupants of that unit seems too refine to be chased after the not-so-refine. Perhaps it could be a case of mistaken unit.   Friends   Poems commonly 'splashed' in those days autograph books:  "True friends are like diamonds, precious and rare.  urlLink      False friends are like dried leaves, scattered everywhere."  urlLink     To false friends of others out there, or I would rather call the fair-weathered friends, please do not take advantage of your friends by simply 'piercing' in and out of their lives, at the cost of them not wanting to be judge as fair-weathered ones.

       Bite   urlLink     - Forget about the D24, the one from Segamat or Batu Pahat, even Thailand. Singapore Durians are very good too. I had my first taste of it during the weekend. Thank you to the anonymous Ah Pek, who regularly durian-hunts, in the wild along the expressway near our place.  - Anonymous Ah Pek also shared knowledge with us, don't immediately eat durians that just fallen off. Such durians have super-strong 'gas' that will make its consumer easily goes queasy.  - Still on durians again, lil' brother says Pulau Tekong bears good wild durians too. So note to current/future NSmen, try to 'nice-nice' your 'Encik' during those night-marches there.  urlLink     - I attempted the promised Swedish meatballs. Hubby gorged down most of the balls even before I managed to prepare the sauce. So what are Swedish meatballs without its sauce?  - The calamari @ Mas-Ayu (Siglap) quite commendable. We saw lots of people ordering its fried chicken. Next time must try-try.  - I am so glad to be able to get a jumbo-sized glass of fresh sugarcane juice for a dollar only @ Beach Road hawker centre.  - I believe Beach Road h.c. also is one of the few places that offers generous fillings for its Pita Kebab (other place like Simpang Bedok). And its menu comes with fanciful names too like J-Lo, Macarena.  *Sigh* so much for the McFasting   Bit   - Hubby *finally* agrees to do Bungee Jump Singapore Style (reads: reverse) this coming weekend. (so come down to Clarke Quay to la-lah-tuay us ok)  - Beside Mas-Ayu, is a teakwood furniture shop. I saw my dream daybed (read: Not to sleep on, but to sit on. To fill up the empty space of my living room). But its price tag dampens our desire to get it.  urlLink     - On a happier note, we managed to get my dream daybed at more than half the price  urlLink    in the middle of Woodlands industrial area. And we chipped in a lil' bit more for the 3-inch cushion seat and dream coffee table. And yes, its walnut-finishing (the closest to  urlLink   -like) matching-matching with our TV console. Thanks MIL for the tip-off. So much for the excitement, the new-addition will only come down to occupy in 2 months time.  *Phew* Next, hunt for that side-seater, phone-table and wardrobe.

      Two fevers epidemic  urlLink    just break out. In fact three. One's over, with the 'Troys' claiming as Giant of Europe in the soccer field.  urlLink     Recently is the Copa America. Due to time difference, lots of fans complain of the unstrategic times the matches shown 'Live' (6 30 hours and 8 30 hours SG time). One of them is  mon frere  who bears an excuse to Mama that job-hunting will resume after this competition is over.   Even, my non-watcher of football hubby, has been dilly-dallying the time around to drive me to office. Come on, hubby. Admit it. You must be ogling at those hotbods of the hispanic ladies who are cheering for their countrymen.  urlLink     Well, I myself admit admiring those beautiful chicanos flaunting their beautiful bodies in bikini-tops. The climate in Peru is known to be HOT, compares to Portugal I guess.  Rest case for fever 1.  With all the much talk about fondue, I manage to drag hubby out after yesterday's dinner for it. The last 'fondue' experience I had (if you may call that), was helping Mama doing the 'London Almond' cookies many, many Hari Raya ago.  We hit HD in Thomson's Plaza, ordered the fondue set to be shared, and a cup of bailey's coffee for hubby. We were 'dangerously poking' our 'catches-4-the-day' and dunked them into the 'boiling mud' with the skewers that set 'roaring' eyes  urlLink    from the passer-bys. But we the 'dangerous' couple couldn't care less and continued our 'vicious act'.  Later, we went to 'peep-peep' into the a dance studio, which I was forced-sent 10 years ago, all in the name for NDP  urlLink   . We had joy, we had fun under the sun. And I remember that was the time I met my one and only Chinese boiiiii-pren that I had, who were one of the 'Monkey-Monks' from CH. hihihi *coy*

      Crawling a few days back before our  urlLink day , hubby posed a 'practical' tease to me.   Hubby: I tak nak apa2 for this special day. But I only need you, one time, call me 'Abang'.  blearghhhhhhhhhh!  urlLink     That is truly against the Act of "Liza's Ethics" under Section "What to call your husband?".  Wife *sarcastically*: Bila masa I kahwin dengan abang you, or you kahwin dengan kakak I sampai I nak kena call you itu?  I have nothing against other wives calling their husbands 'Abang', but it's just isn't me. Ironically, I call hubby, 'Baiyaa' (reads: Brother or Abang in Hindi/Urdu). I should give these credits to my 2 flower-girls (Paki-blood) who 'manja'-ly always call upon hubby, "Baiyaa... Baiyaa!". Thus the word kept rhyming in me, and I love it, so be it.  Despite constant tickering from the girls' mommy and other Indian pals to stop calling him 'Baiyaa', I simply can't after constant toungueing  urlLink    it for the past 4 years.  (This is a gentle note to dearest husband)  ~~~~~~~~~~  Interruption for an announcement.  urlLink You ,  urlLink you ,  urlLink you  and  urlLink you ! Take note. July 31st 14 30 hours @ CBTL Boat-Key. Can? RSVP via  urlLink her  shoutbox.  N.B. Kindly leave 'baggage' (Reads: Another way to call husband from  urlLink her  dictionary) at the comfort of your shack.

      No! I am not about to flaunt on that kind of thing. Merely sharing my reads from  Reno Ideas  mag (I've been seriously getting down on my  urlLink upgrade-update list point no. 1 ).      Out, damn those ...    Perspiration stains:  Mixing equal parts of ammonia with water, add a few tablespoons of liquid dish soap and soak the garment overnight. Then wash as usual. (Liza n.b. Ammonia? Chemistry class reloaded. I remembered it release some pungent gas we nicked as 'German Gas'.)   Collar stains:  As shampoo dissolves body oil, take a small paintbrush and brush on some on the collar before washing.   Grease stains:  Sprinkle talcum powder on it to absorb the fresh stains before putting your garments into the washing machine   Food stains:  Saliva can be applied to the stain believe it or not! The former contains enzymes that can break down protein-based food stains. (Liza n.b. I am thinking of collecting my saliva and bottled it up. Saliva for SALE, anybody?)   Wine/coffee stains:  Sprinkle moist salt to absorb the stain first. Then wash with detergent in cold water.   Blood stains:  Pour hydrogen peroxide over them before washing. (Liza n.b. More chemist stuffs, and where am I suppose to get that?)   Ink stains:  Alcohol makes the stains perform the disappearing act when you rub some on them before washing.   Liquid paper/permanent marker:  Dabble sunscreen over the stains and rub with papwer towel until the stains disappear.  ~~~  Are the smell of  mothballs   making you sick? To get around the problem, put those  slivers of leftover soap  to creative use. Place the soap bits in unsealed plastic bags and pack them up together with your clothes. Not only will the scent keep the bugs away, your clothes will also smell like fresh meadows. (Liza n.b. Trust me, this works. I've bug off those mothballs because hubby has kind of allergy to it.)  The laundry basket overflowing with soiled laundry can be a potential  stink  bomb. Sprinkle  baking soda  at the bottom of the basket to help absorb some of the embarrassing odours.  Saturate  cotton balls with your favorite perfume  and put them in corners and shelves of your wardrobe. How's that for wearing (literally) the fragrance that is distinctively you?  ~~~~~~~~~~  Talking about my  urlLink upgrade-update list , I will be observing point no 4 this coming weekend. I intend to whip up Swedish meatballs, recipe complimentary from  urlLink this . Simply an indulgence after learning that some of us going goo-goo-gaa-gaa hearing our non-Muslim acquaintances palating the famous 'balls' in Ikea.  And yes. I was just flipping M.Hood *2 issues ago*. Spot a photograph, with a familiar couple but unfamiliar baby. I remember now. A friend of hubby. Lovely.  ~~~~~~~~~~  What?!  urlLink Cybertarp  is unable to run free picture gallery anymore. So I signed up with  urlLink Photobucket , but I am having problems in getting to display my pics. Help! Help!

      As I typed this, I sneaked sniffs of my wedding invite. It's been a year, but the sweet fragance still there. Thanks to my old dear scrapbook for conserving the scent.  "  It was not a love at first sight  .   After a fallout from a major relationship, a few blind dates, she settled with 'The Aloof One'. Yes, that's her first definition of his character. She equates his quietness as a cold gesture. His main excuse to this day is, 'Why would I want to speak so much, when I am enjoying every single bit of moment when you speak.'  In another word, was he saying she is chatterbox? Well, she is still the babbling brook and he's the calm sea.   'D' Date : He was late! His apology statement was something like this, 'I was watching Godfather and the clock beats me in the immensity.' Duhh! They went to Madame Tussaud's to get in contact with the wax figurines. Had their peach sundaes in McD. Caught their first movie, a  urlLink    Bond installation. And 'fine-dining' @ Scotts foodcourt for some Tandoori spread. And did I forget to mention, the unshameful her actually asked him out on her 21st birthday? So of course, her being expecting her presents, got her presents from him.   'D' Presents : 1. A gold-champagne music box that still lay down comfortably on the dressing table and 'junked' with her favorite rings  urlLink    and brooches.   2. A Cat-figurine paper weight from Selangor Pewter still in its box, waiting to be located on the waiting for the right working desk in their new abode.   3. A birthday card with a shocked-looking Cat infront with his beautiful-handwritings-than-hers inside, that still sticks on her office partition behind her back.   After being 'an item' to each other, they dated 'abnormally' unlike other couples; they seldom meet, phonecalls mostly during working hours, and observe curfews on every dates. As other normal couples, they have their fair share of squabbles, quarrels, arguments and fights. They have 'Cat' fights  urlLink    (scratch each other), 'Dog' fights-No (they don't bark at each other), 'Laser Gun' fights (i.e. her 'laser' mouth equals sarcastic she).  They got engaged after one week he proposed  urlLink    that sent many awes and shocks to both sides of the family. Despite the one week notice, the results of the whole engagement event was quite an affair. Thanks to her mother! After that, they received 'warnings' from fellow uncles and aunties, that no repetition of short notices when it comes to their wedding.  Well, of course they didn't. They toiled nearly 6 months for  'D' Day  which bears beautiful moments  urlLink   . The Honeymoon. Beautiful. After one year. Still beautiful. And they hope in many, many years to come, more beautiful things will come in their marriage.  urlLink   "

      Today, marks, one year exact since I became Mrs Muhammad Noor. It's our 1st Year Wedding Anniversary. I could not ask for anything more, as long as He lengthens the longevity of the married bliss we've been experiencing and more goodness comes in our way, till Eternity. And on this very day, I pray for Mama to get better and better.  Until she's discharged, I prefer to put the celebration to a KIV mode. Nothing about dampening the spirit, but I rather spend the time with Mama and watch her progresses. Am glad dearest husband is adhering sincerely to it.   Perhaps, wife would make it up by sneaking in that earlier-planned-and-promised Blue bottle of non-alcohol Blue Cocktail *getting all the Blues*. And pop it open by the candlelights after AH visiting hour.   Allow me to end this entry with something extract from my wedding invites. I penned it myself specially for the occasion.  "When we love because of the Almighty.  When we meet, parting is the last thing in mind.  When we are apart, restlessness devours.  Begun a new chapter where on this Day  I choose this Friend to be more than a Friend.  As Man & Wife through Eternity.  May the Almighty shower His blessings."

      Mama had a relapse again. My brother followed her in the ambulance. Though I never sit in one, but I develop a kind of phobia to it. The last time a very loved one was brought by it, I was *solemnly* led to 'DOA' by the staffs upon my arrival in the hospital.  'DOA' reads Death On Arrival.  AH she's warded in again, and Mama experiences more difficulty in breathing compare to the last time. At a pinnacle of some frustation, I wish I am the doctor and able to attend to my mother and have all the answers and solutions to her difficulty. At a rational thought, I know only He has the answers and solutions. I am praying harder for the wellness of her health.  And my health too. At any rate, I can feel my immunity is running low. So I am bound to fall sick any time. With mama sick, making me sick-worried, and worse, my job HATES me. It's not my working Saturday today, but I have to do cover-up. I hope I don't fall flat.   Doctor, doctor, I need my supplements.   I really look up to these people in the medical services i.e. doctors and nurses in hospital. Apart from getting prone to sort of viral and attending to patients' need, they have to tolerate 'cranky' patients which I witnessed myself.  On lighter note, I visited some 'old-timer' patients who've been there since when mama first warded last week. So, hospitals are not only meant for the sick. Its also for friendships to kindle.

      Due to  urlLink her  request, I've decided to share most-what I know on Pasta. So after this, make sure you cook Pasta for  urlLink the fiance , hah.     First and foremost let me touch on types of pasta. The very common ones that are very well known among us are macaroni (long/short cut tubes) and spaghetti (fine/medium rods). But do you know that they are 300 different types of pasta. New shapes are being designed and named everyday. Hmmmmm ... perhaps I should designed and named my own pasta.  Here are a few of the many pastas:  Penne  (my favorite): feather-liked tubes, small pasta  Fettuccine : medium ribbons (mee-kuning, bit-flat version)  Linguine : long-flat ribbons similar to fettuccine  Tagliarini : thin ribbons (Italian rendition of beehoon)  Tagliatelle : broad ribbons (Italian rendition of kuay teow)  Lasagne : sheets of flat rectangular pasta  Orecchiette : ear-shaped pasta  Lumache : snail-shaped shells  Lumaconi : big shells often stuff with fillings like minced meat  Eliche : spirals  Bucatini : long, medium tubes  Cannelloni : large, thick tubes  Ditalini : short tubes similar to macaroni  Farfalle : bow-shaped  Fusilli : long-twisted  Picking up above pasta from supermarket is no hussle. But take note of this tip. Pasta are not meant to be eaten over-boiled. The best way is, to let the water boil, then plunged in the pasta. Not vice versa. Add some olive oil to give that pasta some 'glossy' look. Do sprinkle in some salt, because pasta are naturally tasteless. The wonderful thing with pasta, you can even bake or fry it.  Picking up ready-made pasta sauce from the shelves is also no hussle. But I can guarantee it's no hussle to DIY too. But remember this rule, thick sauce for thick pasta, thin sauce for thin pasta.    Bolognaise   (basically its tomato and meat sauce - SIL's recipe)  total time: 2 hours 30 minutes | serves 4  2 tbsp of olive oil 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped 250g of minced beef 1 medium tin of tomato puree Fresh tomatoes, cut(optional, for those who prefer more sour-ish) Few tbsp of grinded chilli (put more for more spicy-ness) 2-3 fresh basil leaves Sprinkle of rosemary herb Sprinkle of salt Sprinkle of ground black pepper  On a big saucepan, heat olive oil and saute in the onion, garlic and grinded chilli. Add in the minced meat and cook until it turns color. Dissolve in the tomato puree and stir in for a few minute before putting in the fresh, cut tomatoes. Put in the basil, rosemary, salt and black pepper. The best is to cover and simmer (cook in lower heat) for 2 hours.  Served on drained pasta. Compliment it with grated Parmesan cheese.  Some other pasta recipe, some other time, ok? Mama Mia!!!

      We had Fried Egg Noodle for dinner just now. Hubby was suggesting to simply transfer the noodle from the frying wok to one BIG bowl  . No hussle-fussle of separate serving plates   .  Makan sepinggan, ye Baiyaa?  I knew too well, he was feeling a bit lazy to handle the dishwashing  . Well, it's one of Our House rules. One cooks, the other washes.  Butcha know, it's belly-belly roarrrr-man-tick to share a bowl of noodle together-gether  . Best-er, if your partner feeds you. But I chose to be the one feeding. My hubby tends to pourrrrr-get to feed me one. Poor, poor wife, right?

      Am still spotting this 'Stone-Rock' voice,  koff -ing all away. If it's the SARS season, I think I would have been ordered to put on the mask, yeah.    Anyway, last night, decided to pay a visit to parents' place, to see how mama's doing. She's much better, but this time round, her left knee giving her away. Papa, and sister, who were OFF from work and school, respectively yesterday, nicely gestured mama out, to take some fresh air out there. I think that should be encourage in her. She can't forever coup herself in the house. It's unhealthy. We don't encourage her to do marketing, hanging out laundry   or other heavy chores by herself, all for the name and benefit for her to recuperate. So, we thought a slow walk would do her no harm.  But when I saw her, she was all complaint of her knee from the earlier walk. Still nice-nice daughter offered to massage it gently with some ointment. I could see that she's having difficulty to move and walk, alright. Papa was telling us, that he intends to invest on a walking aid and threadmill   for mama. We think that's a very good idea. So, next shopping trip, hubby and I will be scouting for these 2 items.

      As I wrote this, I'd been declared by my kind, and nice GP a day of MC. I am suffering with a bad-bad, itchy throat. When I  koff-koff , it sounds phlegm-y, but nothing seems want to get discharge from that very itchy zone. I wish they have those baby-bottle brush, which bristles are soft enough to be lunged through my throat to do some scratch-scratch.  It must be due to the over-gorging of peach sorbet and frozen strawberries  , that I picked up from Cold Storage over the weekend. Plus, I haven't gotten over the fatigueness of attending to mama, the night before. Yes. She had another relapse. This time round was milder. My father happened to be on night shift, so at half past 10pm, I'd received a call from sister who immediately asked me to come down.  When hubby and I arrived, we found mama, resting on the bed and crying. I thought all this while she's a strong fighter. She started to express her feelings that perhaps her time is up.   Listening to the very weaken her, I had to bite myself to not appear weak, and told her to shun that kind of negative thoughts. I suggested to bring her to the doctor, but she repudiated. After much consolation from hubby and myself, finally she obliged.  In the 24-hour clinic  , the doctor put her on nebulizer filled with ventolin. She seems a bit better. It was almost 1am when we sent her home. I made her a hot drink, gave her medicine  , and pat her to sleep. Hubby and I made our way home, while I was thinking of getting off for work in a few hours time. But of course, I faltered.  Earlier during the day, the planned JB trip was off. No need to go and peep-peep. I think it was on the news that both sides were jammed. So good, homely wife decided to cook whatever's left in the fridge, and she came out with Ayam Masak Merah and Chap Chye. 'Bad', unhomely hubby, 'abandoned' his good, homely wife, to check on his engine and water-tank stuffs, and met up his friends for awhile. But before ND parade started, he came back for her and they shared a pleasant meal together while watching TV.  So, this is the story of my 2004 National Day. Ok, time for my 2nd dosage of meds (Yucks!). Am thinking of putting up Arisan on the VCD player, later. Ehhh, did I tell you all, that School Of Rock, really RAWKS?

      The initial intention to attend all 4 weddings, was all 'sub-dued', as the very lethargic us chose to be a Sunday-late-riser. Bummer. Anyway, 2 of the weddings were attended by PILs, so we simply  kirim .  Made our way to Bedok, to catch the one-sixth of the After-Sixsters' wedding, who's also a  urlLink blogger . She's wedded to a former poly-pal. I managed to meet the very pleasant  urlLink Ummi Nazif , but sans Baby Nazif (uwekkkkk, I very the  semangat  to play wip him you know).  Tapi sempat Ummi dia tarik I bergambar .   urlLink     Am still awaiting for pics taken at the groom's side.  Hubby willingly 'released' me to 4 of my girlfriends, who already planned to 'kidnap' me for the most-unwilling-to-watch-movie, The Village. I was seriously contemplating to 'escape' from the 'kidnappers', due to the rave of not-so-good reviews of the movie. But I can say, it's pretty wide off the mark.  It's definitely a better instalment than earlier Shyamalan work, The Sign. It's like watching Blast From The Past plus The Others plus Ali Baba &amp; 40 Thieves plus Little Red Riding Hood plus Twister. Ask me why, but it's simply my sensations, go and watch it, and you will know it.  (Spoilers ahead, but not so much lahhhhh)  - Good guys in yellow cloak, Bad guys in red cloak.  - Bad guys went around painting all doors in red ( kan dah cam crite Ali Baba )  - So, red, is the colour of curse, and disallowed in the village. Guess all the villagers were amissing red strawberries, red roses, red wine. So what happen to the redheads (Hihih...)?  - Adrien Brody, played a retard, was one of the guys in the red cloak (Hahah!!! now you know)  - Shyamalan made a 'cameo' appearance, but you better watch close, because most  potek  ones couldn't get him.  - Joaquin Phoenix died, despite his sweetheart's effort to brave through the  eerie  woods, and  cross the century , to get medicines for him.  After the show, Fiza dropped me at Haig Road, where hubby was waiting to pick me up. It must be the 'freezing' cinema that sent me off to hunger again, that I dragged hubby to sit down in the nearby hawker centre to have  yong taufu  and  mamak -style chicken chop.  Later we decided to catch the fireworks at Esplanade  . But  goondu  us, joined a could-be-few-hundred  goondus , hung around indoor stadium. At almost 8.40pm, the fireworks start to blast. We should know better, definitely that is not the strategic place to catch the Esplanade Fireworks. Thus, we could only hear the sounds of it, and remnants of the fire sparkles, which was of course block by the sporadic of condos there. If you were there, you could definitely see the chaotic turn, when hundreds of  goondus  raced to respective vehicles. It's useless. There's massive jam, everywhere nearby.  So we decided to hit Home Sweet Home, and choose School Of Rock, as our DVD-night. Roll the tape, please!    Anyway, it's past 12am. Happy 39th Xin-Jia-Po!!!

      Saturday evening was spent all the way through midnight at my parents' place. *Ahem* My roasted chicken pita turned out *unexpectedly* well, and thanks to the 'creme' of the pita ingredients; The Roasted Chicken. Not bad lahhh.  urlLink Lulu , you must be proud to have a good student like me, kan? For all the taggers, who were pleading for the pitas, am truly sorry. It's SOLD OUT on the spot. God's willing, in future, will share the recipe with you all, food-enthusiasts.  After the 8pm news on Suria, 3 siblings plus 1 BIL were cat-fighting on which boardgames for playtime. I chose Scrabble (being the *so-called* wordy person) and brother chose Ludo. Both of us lost to 2 votes by Sister and hubby, who insisted on playing the  Saidina  (Malaysia's rendition of Monopoly). If Parklane and Mayfair being the most expensive sites in UK rendition, it's Pulau Penang and KL for M'sia. My purchases included only those 2, adorned with houses and hotel, which was a 'curse &amp; swear' affair for the other 3 players, every time the dices   brought them there.  Their cries is my pleasure . Close to midnight, I was the proclaimed  Saidina  (winner)  , with brother came in with a close fight in totals of our properties. Sister was the poor  Bankrap , who was also the Banker. Hahahhh!  Gosh... it's almost 3am. And I could see hubby still blink-blink open, counting sheeps perhaps  . Cialat, how to 'gear' up for 4 weddings later.

      Sweet, sweet hubby could continue his 'beauty' sleep on Saturday  . But not for his love for the wife, he still drove her to the *dreaded* office  . In addition, sent her a packet of  nasi lemak  (uikkks, bit heavy leyyy) while she'd just about to 'entertain' her 1st user problem. So sweet, sweet wife, put aside that problem, and spared time to have breakfast with sweet, sweet hubby at the company's canteen. And sweet, sweet wife wants to tell sweet, sweet hubby not to forget to check the 'Love Notes' she 'vandalise' on the bathroom mirror, before they left home (simply ways to keep the  flame alive ).  As another sweet gesture, sweet, sweet wife told sweet, sweet hubby, there's no need to fetch her from office later. Sweet, sweet her said she terribly misses taking public transport  . The real intention is, sweet, sweet her wants to do a little of her own grocery shopping  . Sweet, sweet her wants to prepare pita with *roasted* chicken fillings.  She is making her own roasted chicken. 2 chickens already marinated are awaiting for her in the fridge, to be send for roasting. She not so sure whether the chickens will turn out well. But in case of emergency she will send force to get the honey-roasted chicken at Causeway Point. Hahah!!  After that, sweet, sweet her will feed roasted chicken pitas to her sweet, sweet hubby. Then she will make enough roasted chicken pitas for her sweet, sweet family across the street. So everybody will have roasted chicken pitas.    I Declare It's Pita Day, today!!!!!

       A pair Bally Shoes     My good, old buddy just made a confession to me, via MSN, that she 'accidentally' bought this pair at 300 dollars. She thought it's the price tag before "more than 50% discount". The original price tag was 800 dollars. Ouch!  Good, old buddy me, managed to enlighten her, that must be a good, beautiful buy (though I never look at it, but I VERY trust her taste, one). So note to buddy, just make sure you don't museum-ise the shoes, like Imelda Marcos did, to collect dust.   4 Weddings     Ooops! You might be thinking me to continue to make a complete, movie name. But the fact is, that is the number of wedding invitations I have on National Day's Eve.  Shiok kan ?   August 9th     All that captures me is the fireworks. Back in my 'old kampung', I could visibly see and audibly hear it. Now no more (not the wonderful thing of being an extreme northerner).I remember at certain years, they have marched-pass by near my flat. FUN!   Fruit Day         In the midst of blogging this entry, the same, old buddy of mine, MSN that her company just distributed free guavas to everybody.  Ada kebun ke Boss you ? The past months, apples, oranges and mangoes had been distributed.  Promoting healthy lifestyle kot ? This is indeed a very good gesture. Errr ... any chances of free strawberries? kiwi? Anything exotica?    Hit JB     The unpatriotic us intend to hit JB on morning August 9th. But provided the traffic condition is smooth. So we intend to go and peep-peep the checkpoint first thing first in the morning (the wonderful thing of being an extreme northerner).  If not, we simply turn ourselves in as homely couple, watch tv and eat whatever is in the fridge.   *Sigh* Before I can get to all the above, I have to go through the remaining hours of work today. I've been putting a 'blind eye' on the in-tray of users' request forms. Even my China-boss has been 'ignored' by me. 'Lazy worms' are crawling inside of me. And crap! I still have to work tomorrow (Saturday). Uwekkkkkkkkk.....  Anyway, looking at Tammy  kena  fired yesterday, and Jesse, last week in The Apprentice, makes me learn one thing. Make sure when you open up your mouth for your team, make it a good 'contributor factor' to your team. But at least Tammy was 'outspoken' enough, unlike Jesse, who was ... over-'nice'?

        Baby Eggplant Parmesan with Goat Cheese Sandwich        total time: 20 minutes | makes 2 sandwiches  I am 'tamed' to eat eggplants after I get to know my hubby. But only the baby ones, because they are small and crunchy. In this recipe, we make use of 2 types of cheese; Parmesan & goat cheese. Cheese-freaks, aren't we? The goat cheese actually replaces the traditional mozzarella which gives this classic Italian sandwich a more 'grown-up' twist.  4 slices of wholemeal bread (Gardenia brand) 3 baby eggplants, sliced halved 3 tsp of olive oil, for brushing 1/2 tsp of salt 3 tbsp of tomato sauce 1/3 cup of fresh Goat Cheese 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan  Heat skillet (preferably grill stove) to medium hot. Brush both sides of eggplant slices with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place eggplant on skillet/grill. Cook until browned and softened, around 4 minutes per side.  Spread one slice of bread with tomato sauce. And then spread another with goat cheese. Top it up with the grilled eggplant slices, and cover it with the earlier slice with tomato sauce-sidedown. Brush the top-outside of the sandwich with olive oil, and pat 1 tbsp of grated Parmesan on it (The cheese should stick on the oil).  Heat on large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add remaining olive oil to the skillet. Place the sandwiches in the skillet. Let cook uuntil Parmesan has browned, 4 minutes per side. Serve hot. The result would be something like the Croque Monsieur you might see in Delifrance. Go and check it out.     Summer Sandwich with Egg        total time: 30 minutes  makes 6 sandwiches  Egg is another 'love' food product of hubby. I learnt that before we got married, he 'dunked' minimum one egg every day (MIL's pampering). But that is so unhealthy. Now that we are married, and in-stay our own home, I tremenduously manage to cut down on the egg-y thing. 10 eggs, could last both of us almost 2 weeks. We have it hard-boiled, half-boiled or sunny-side up on non-stick pan with very little *olive* oil. No-no deep fry 'mata lembu'.  If you notice, most of my sandwich recipes been on favoritism of hubby's. Well, I am not such a wonderful chef-tress wife, with very little time to whip up meals. But I always try my very best to serve something simple, pleasant and MOST IMPORTANT of all something he loves.  The way to win a man's heart, is through his stomach  (but that doesn't mean FATTENING him up, right). So enjoy my last recipe for this Sharing-Sandwich-Recipes Edition.  6 pieces of ciabatta bread, sliced half horizontally 6 hard-boiled eggs, sliced in half lengthwise 1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil 4 tsp of capers 1/4 cup of parsley leaves 2 cloves of garlic 1/2 tsp of ground black pepper 1/4 tsp of salt (or you use 3 anchovies to extract the natural saltiness) 1/2 medium orange bell pepper, thinly sliced 1/2 pint of cherry tomatoes, halved 2/3 cup of black olives, pitted and quartered  Place olive oil, capers, parsley, garlic, black pepper and salt (or anchovies) on a food processor (blender). Blend until the garlic is finely chopped for around 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the bell pepper, tomatoes and olives, and toss to combine. Layer the mixture on bottom half of the ciabatta, top with the 2 halves of hard-boiled eggs. Top it again with the mixture and replace the top of the loaf. Wrap the filled loaf with plastic wrap. Now, it's portable for any meal out of your home.

      I rose to a morning filled with positive vibes. The fragrance of  setanggi  still lingers strongly around the house, despite setting it up 2 nights ago. I am guaranteed it will continue to linger until end of this week. Thats the thing I like about the everlasting- setanggi . We've been scrooge-ingly burning it for the cause we bought it from Medina. But of course we can always pick up it in those stores here.  I was half-geared for work when I passed by my living room. I could see the sunray despite through my tinted balcony door. I slided it open, and drew up one of the woven blinds.   How I wish we could 'waste' more time to have our morning meal on the balcony seat. I miss having that. But work had the better of me, and I had to fall in earlier due to some training I had to conduct.  Walking into the office space took a thoroughly different turn from my earlier hours. Albeit no mood, training has to go on. No mood, but I never fail to do it well. This is hypocrisy. Don't you think so? My idiosyncracy has lead me to be a hypocrite. Why can't I simply be like heck-care-I-couldn't-care-less attitude in here?  Suddenly, I terribly miss someone. Who had left me(us) for 3 long years. She was more like a 'Mother' to me. After she'd gone, and everytime I squabbled with Mama, I would always think of her. With initial anger, follows by sadness, I would childishly said this to myself, "Kalau Busu ade lagi kat sini, mesti Mama tak bole marah kan."     Unconditional Love   She treated all her nieces and nephews well, being her unmarried. When we teased her into marriage, she would 'lament' for a  Datuk  to betroth to. Hihihi ... but of course she never gets her  Datuk , because she devoted herself in taking care of our  Datuk , her father.   Generosity   In most of my elder cousins' wedding, you will definitely see her as the most-toiling one, even than the parents-of-the-bride/groom. She gave her 'sponsors' on some wedding stuffs. That's why we cousins were pestering her to get hitch, so we could pay for her wedding. But of course, there is no wedding of her, and she left me too early before I could repay her anything.   Birthday Planner   She met her demise the eve of my brother's 19th. Birthdays have become 'blue' to us every since then. She never fail to shower us with small parties, cakes and presents.   Open+Stubborness   When she says it, she means it, and she does it. I guess that explains where I inherit those genes from.   Hygiene-Freak   Having her in any home, would guarantee an extremely shiny, spick and span condition. A clean, damp towel would be her 'precious item'.   Cat Lover   Everytime, my parents and I called her for a holiday, she would be utterly concern of her 2 'children' (reads: Pet cats). She only obliged to one June 2001 aussie trip. But of course the trip never come. She departed on April 2001.     I know no matter how much I cry for her now, I understand, that Allah loves her more.

         Especially feeling affection for track no. 8, 'Your Mother'.  "Who's next? My Mother. Who's next? My Mother. Who's next? My Mother. And then My Father....."  Auwwwww, I am sure be very delighted if my future kids serenade to me this song.    'Our Guide is the Quraan' shook me all teary esp. the part that sings,  "Subhanallah walhamdulillah Allahu Akbar"  It simply brings me to the reminiscence of my tawaf around Baitullah, chanting the same line, everytime crossing the line of Multazam, waving at Baitullah and kissing the palm. I am terribly missing the place, and at a verge of exploding 'buckets'.    Note to  urlLink ayu , me still waiting for Wardah Books to email/contact on their new location. Yu hap annie eye-dear?

        Merguez Ficelle    total time: 15 minutes | makes 2 sandwiches  Merguez is a Moroccan-spiced lamb sausage. If you can't find it, substitute with any fresh sausage. Ficelle is a particularly a skinny French loaf. Delifrance baguette will work fine, too.  1 stick of celery, cut into small inches (original use red onions which I abhor) 2 tbsp of olive oil, for brushing 1/2 tsp of salt 1 10-ounce of merguez, or few sausages, sliced in 1/2 lengthwise 1 6-ounce ficelle, or baguette, cut into 2, then sliced in 1/2 lengthwise 3 tbsp of Dijon mustard  Cook the sausage and celery on pan fry, or better grill it with olive oil and sprinkle with the salt, till celery softens. Spread the inside ofthe baguette with the mustard, and then fill it with the cooked sausage and celery.  So simple to be serve!       Turkey Sandwich with Cucumber Slaw    total time: 20 minutes to 2 hours (to whip the slaw), 5 minutes (to put to sandwich) | makes 2 sandwiches  Cucumber is one of hubby's favorite 'fruit'. I am not fanciful of it, unless its very finely sliced or better still grated. For this sandwich, using normal, soft white bread is the best, because it best soaks up "juice" from the tangy creamy slaw.  1 cucumber, grated 3 tbsp of sour cream 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard 2 tsp of capers 2 tsp of gherkins 1/4 tsp of salt 4 slices of white sandwich bread 4 thinly sliced deli-counter roast turkey  In a medium bowl, combine grated cucumber, sour cream, mustard, capers, gherkins and salt. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to 2 hours to let the flavors mingle. Divide half the cucumber misture between 2 pieces of the bread. Alternate toppings of cucumber slaw and turkey on the sandwich bread. Use a kitchen scissors/knife to cut the sandwich into triangular halves.  Voila! Ready to be eaten.

      Kak Aiza & Hubby, and Auntie Mummy just flew out to Jakarta hours back. I 'hate' Departure Halls. And I love Arrival Halls. This brings me back to some beginning and ending scenes of a movie, 'Love Actually'; Heathrow, London. If you've watched it, you will get what I mean...  'I feel it in my fingers ... I feel it in my toes .....'  *goosebumps*  Talking about LOVE, I met some lovely ladies on Saturday, and got to sit by the river with them. In the midst of the 'river-sickness', we sipped our 'minuman bijik kopi', ate my wedges &  urlLink her  chickens, 'dig' into the married ones' wedding albums, posing some more for some unofficial album, and not forgetting, did what WOMEN do best; chat & gossip.   urlLink She  was my so-called 'long, lost junior', which I'd never thought I'd lost her; because we never met throughout our ENTIRE 'Budak Bukit Clan' days. Everybody knows her and everybody knows me. But we don't know each other. Strange.  So  my  the 'long, lost junior'  urlLink cousin , I consider the 'establisher' of the whole 'Mistaken Identity' (MI) incident. I thought I saw  urlLink her  in this  urlLink pic . But the cousin actually led me to the idea it was  urlLink her . And ohhh, on that very same pic, I spotted a long, lost  urlLink pal , who seems really, really lost  Thanks to the cousin too, she got me connected to another long, lost pal, whom I'd ever went out on double-dates. Hihihi ... And this pal coincidentally was a pal of the long, lost pal I'd mentioned earlier, plus to be a sister of  urlLink her . Phew! So much of this blogging world.  And again, so much of this blogging world plus the joy of bloghopping,  urlLink she  found me! This time, no mistaken identity. She was indeed in that pic.  2 more lovely ladies,  urlLink 'she no. 1'  and  urlLink 'she no. 2'  joined us in the seat-by-the-river, to 'spice' more things up. Naughty me managed to snatch 'she no. 1' passport and revealed to the World Wide Web (WWW) her real name (go and check my latest PHLOG).  What more can I say? We sure had fun, Fun, FUN! Lucky no one was tipsy enough reeking of caffeine, attempt to jump into the river.  Pics I'm afraid I have to pilfer from unofficial photographers  urlLink no. 1 ,  urlLink no. 2  and  urlLink no. 3 .  Hurry up, hurry up you people, share-share the pics, ok.   Click here for  urlLink more .   urlLink     And yeah,  urlLink she  couldn't make it with us, for the name of Teacher-meet-the-Parents session. Don't worry Rose, I truly understand. Guess I will see you on your wedding. :)
