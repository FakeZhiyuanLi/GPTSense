      It is morning 9.37 am in here, I feel so refreshed! Sigh, many things happen yesterday but I am really glad that all are resolve and most importantly, I know what went wrong with me and I love you even more!!  Feel so stressed yesterday when I tried to did 3-4hrs of strenuous studying but nevertheless I manage to complete half of physic, remarkable huh? lol  Today I gotta study fast after talking on the phone with her ( if possible :P )

      Wov! Another day has passed, and it has been sometime since i updated my blog! Ok here goes, today I spent my whole day chatting with my darling and sweet lao po. Yesterday I spent my whole day with her ( had some tiff but worth it ). The day before, I spent my whole day with her and half of it was acting like a clown -_-" :P As for the day before the day or day before the day's day, absolutely, apparently, unfortunately, what a mishap, my memory fails me.  GUESS WHAT?! Believe it or not, my lao po's mother's friend ( rather long huh?, cutting it short -   "mum's friend" hehe ) saw me accompanying her home! Luckily only that, and nothing else ( praying, burning incense ) *Hope* that her mum doesn't invite me to her house that soon...  Ok that was boring though? now for the real "monotonous part". I MANAGE TO CONTROL MYSELF LOL!!!

      What a day it is, let's not mingle about my studies today because it's getting moody..  Sigh, today I miss her extremely lot after she called me at around 5.30pm. In addition, after she hanged up, I keep doubting whether she missed me or just called to please me. I ponder if she feels anything when I said "I love you" to her  Well nvm about that, I think thoroughly that if she doesn't miss me, she won't have called me :P furthermore, I am sure she is very happy upon hearing thoese 3 words :D Sorry for my sensitivenss just now lao po, I guess I miss you badly, and I think that's the cause of it..  Also, I am sad because she hasn't sms me from 5pm till 8.15pm(now).. haiz but no worries! I will cheer up myself and wait for your sms no matter what! I love you sweetheart! Ok Another 2 days+- or 48hrs+- or 2880mins+- or 172800sec+- or 1day12hrs360mins21600secs+- to your welcome back! I did all the calculations mentally dear! I love you! come back soon !!

      Well today was rather a bad day for me. I went to SGH hopefully to have some tangible informations such as charges for organ transplant. However, the well so called "superior" reprimanded me that I should have evidence backing me as a student of nyjc doing PW.. crappy apparently she's doubting me :( Should be my dressing to there bah.. lol *bengz* lol  Next is my darling(lao po) had went to genting, I miss her very much and cried today while in the toilet strolling through the sweet sms she sent me in the morning. Sigh.. another 3 days (which will be 7pm) and hrs++ more for your arrival to singapore! come back soon dear...    Sigh.. a day without her is so monotonous! How can I withstand another 3 more days?! HELP!
