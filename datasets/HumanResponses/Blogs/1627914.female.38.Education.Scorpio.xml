      June 28, 2003  It's actually two minutes to 12am so technically by the time I'm done writing this it will be the 29th.  I found out about this website from Wallace today.  So I'm setting it upnow and then going to bed.  Goodnight!  P.S.  I noticed that it posts the time five minutes fast.

      I slowed down on the word-a-day to give me more time to internalize each word :-).  Todays word is  Imbroglio  - an involved and confusing situation; a confused misunderstanding or disagreement.

      I AM A CHRISTIAN    When I say..."I am a Christian"  I'm not shouting "I'm clean livin'"  I'm whispering "I was lost",  Now I'm found and forgiven.   When I say..."I am a Christian"  I don't speak of this with pride.  I'm confessing that I stumble  And need CHRIST to be my guide.   When I say..."I am a Christian"  I'm not trying to be strong.  I'm professing that I'm weak  And need HIS strength to carry on.    When I say..."I am a Christian"  I'm not bragging of success.  I'm admitting I have failed  And need GOD to clean my mess.   When I say..."I am a Christian"  I'm not claiming to be perfect.  My flaws are far too visible  But GOD believes I am worth it.   When I say..."I am a Christian"  I still feel the sting of pain.  I have my share of heartaches  So I call upon HIS name.    When I say..."I am a Christian"   I'm not holier than thou.   I'm just a simple sinner   Who received GOD's good grace, somehow.     Wishing you God's richest blessings.  NOTE:  This was e-mailed to me...I posted it because it says it all.

      The word for the day is  'Hegemony' -leadership or dominance (especially of one nation over others).  The quote that I can't get out of my head is, "Live everyday as if it were your last...because one day it will be."

      Something Has Been Bothering Me...  When I was off work in May because of my surgery, I became addicted to All My Children.  So much so that I began taping it everyday after I went back to work.  A couple of weeks ago they began to hint about the fact that Bianca was going to be raped.  Then I saw Erica and Bianca on The View (my other addiction) and they confirmed what was going to happen, and also that Bianca was not going to report it.  This really disturbed me! I knew that I wouldn't be able to watch it, but I couldn't figure out why.  With me being so 'evolved' and having faced, conquered and become well acquainted with my dragons, I was surprised that I was so uncomfortable with the storyline.  So I didn't tape AMC the day it all happened and really thought that I wouldn't watch the soap opera for a couple of months.  I thought that I would get annoyed with Bianca for not telling.  I lasted until that Friday :-).  I tuned in just in time to see Bianca try to tell  Erica about it, but change her mind.  And yes, I was disturbed, but not for the reason that I'd expected.  It made me extremely uncomfortable to recognize that I would have done exactly what Bianca did...stay quiet.  And for the same reasons that she did.  It's been bothering me because it took me so many years to talk about my childhood (and start getting help 11 years ago), and I can still find reasons to try to deal with things, especially the big ones, by myself.  My best friend, Dana, says that it's like pulling teeth to get information out of me when there's something wrong.  She's right...it's easier for me to talk about what's bothering me when I've figured out the cause and/or the solution.  I know this is a residual from not talking for so many years, but I can't seem to shake this one; it even took me days to write about this.  AMC's storyline has added to my list of things to work on this year.

      Six Degrees Of Separation...From Colorado  What Is Up With Colorado?...  Kato Kaelin met Nicole Brown (Simpson) in Aspen, Colorado; he became a major witness for the prosecution against O.J. Simpson. This all took place around the time of the trial for the first group of fellas who tried to blow up the World Trade Center.  Interesting huh?  O.J. Simpson's trial distracted people from the Oklahoma City bombing and subsequent trial that was held in Denver, Colorado.  That whole thing reminds me of the movie 'Swordfish".  As a matter of fact...so does 9-11.  The Columbine High School massacre took place in Littleton, Colorado; I wonder what event we missed noticing in 1999.  Now we get this thing with Kobe.  Maybe more people will be interested in this instead of war talk.  Always Thinking...

      Defeat comes from looking back.  Distraction comes from looking around.  Discouragement comes from looking down.  Deliverance comes from looking up.  A friend e-mailed that to me today, and  instead of forwarding it all over the place, I figured I'd just put it on here.  Today's word is  'geminate' ...to arrange in pairs; double or become doubled (gemination).

       When Facts Are Fiction   One of the biggest mistakes that people make in relationships is believing that they "know" someone just because they know some "things" about them.  Whether it be your relationship with family, friends or God, having facts without substance adds up to fiction, and leads to friction and miscommunications.  The substance comes from spending time with someone and really being there, and not mentally or emotionally someplace else.  One of my favorite lines from a movie is from "Nell"; Jodie Foster says that we (people) never look at each other, and that we never look each other in the eyes.    My thought is that the way  into  someones heart may vary, but the way to  see  into their heart and soul is through their eyes.  Most people aren't consciously aware of this, but subconsciously, that's why they look away.   Another mistake that people make is to think that they know someone based on facts received through a mutual acquaintance, friend or family member.  What we seem to not realize is that the information shared  about someone is altered by our interpretation as well as the interpretations of the person receiving the "facts".  Which will make the "facts" fiction.  So what we end up with is a whole lot of folks walking around thinking we "know" people, when nobody "knows" anybody.  And the worst part of it all is no one is asking questions because everyone thinks they already "know" the answers.  Just Another Thought!

      Todays word is  'deracinate' - to pull up by the the roots; uproot (racine means root- two words for the price of one).  Working with kids all day will make this one easy to use in a sentence.  I can think of a few kids who cause me to be 'bilious' enough to 'deracinate' my hair on a daily basis.

      The word for today is  'carnard' - a hoax; a false malicious report.  In Other News...  Today we're having a family gathering/reunion at my house.  I'm going to see people that I haven't seen in years! It's great because it's always fun to remember all of the good times; and also to realize that even through the bad times, you were never  not  loved.  This is something that you can only  truly    understand and appreciate as you get older.

      Misery Loves Comfort  Everyone says that "misery loves company".  I say that misery loves comfort even more. Have you ever noticed that when you feel like crap, you don't mind looking like crap? I don't get overly dressed for a funeral because I figure if I'm going to feel miserable, I may as well do it in comfort.  It's even better when you're miserable and you don't have to leave home.  You put on your worst sweats (the ones you should have thrown away five years ago), and you don't comb your hair or shower for a couple of days.  You really only want to see other people who are miserable, if they look as jacked up as you do.  Don't let someone come over "claiming" to be in misery, but looking like they just walked off the cover of a magazine.  They're just fronting and claiming misery to make you feel better.  Yeah Right...Get Outta Here With That!  Like I said, misery loves comfort more than company.

      Television is so bad that I've taken to reading the dictionary!  This is true but... Sidney Poitier says that a person should learn a new word every day.  So that's what I'm going to do. I'm also going to share that word with anyone who reads this site.  Mostly because what's the use of knowing and using a new word if no one knows what the hell you're talking about. I thought about starting with a children's dictionary, because I figured I've probably missed some easy ones.  But, I don't have one.  The word for today is  abrogate  (and if you already know it, I don't care!),  which means to cancel or to repeal by authority;annul.  Did you know that Webster's Dictionary is such a history book?  It has all the Kings and Queens and bible names and stuff.  Pretty interesting.

      Just A Thought  Back in the day when my friends would get annoyed and say that I was opinionated, I would deny it.  I have since learned to embrace it, and accept the fact that I do have an opinion about most subjects.  I am actually multi-opinioned!  So recently when someone would ask me what I think about the war, at first (before it actually began) I would give an opinion, but then it became moot.  Not because they said that we were winning the war.  But because I suddenly had a different view of what the "big picture" might be.  I had a thought...  The U.S. is focusing on the wrong enemy...Sadaam, Osama, North Korea are not where we should be focusing our fear.  We should be worried about the fact that whatever the feeling was in this country that prompted the fore-fathers to put "In God We Trust" on the currency has dissipated.  I recently read an e-mail expressing concern about the movement to take "under God" out of the pledge of allegience and "in God we trust" off of the currency.  I couldn't help but wonder why people were so shocked about the possibility of these things happening, when it is the obvious next step.  I'll explain...  The e-mail also stated that statistics show that 84% of Americans believe in God.  My question is how many of us "believers" wake up every morning and say to ourselves, "Today I'm going to do something to please God? or what am I not going to do?"  How many of us "believers" are actually serving Him in some capacity? I am not a religious fanatic...Hell, most days I suck at being a Christian.  But in my attempt to read the bible in a year, I can't help but notice what happens to God's people when they turn their backs on Him.  Who can turn on a television, radio or read a newspaper, and still give a valid and convincing argument that the U.S. has not done just that.  And we've done it in the worst way possible...by selling the souls of our children to the devil.    Everywhere they look they're being encouraged to smoke, drink and have sex (with anyone they want!).  It's easier for them to get their hands on drugs and guns than it is to get a good and safe education.  Because I work with kids, it's hard for me to ignore the fact that our education system is a joke.  There truly is no effort to educate all kids equally. If you ask an average middle school kid in a low income community to define flabergasted, he/she would probably say that it's a fat person who farted. I wont try to give a solution to this problem, but I will leave you with this...  On his website, www.infinitekarma.com, my friend Wallace asks this question: "If people have karma, do nations have karma?  If so, what will we do when this nation's chickens come home to roost?"

      Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, "Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you NOT to be? You are a child of GOD. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlighting about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of GOD that is within us. It's not in some of us, it's in all of us. And as we let our light shine, we unconsiously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, or presence automatically liberates others.  I've hung these words by Nelson Mandela in my bedroom for daily inspiration.

      My purpose for setting up this site is to share things that I've written and my thoughts, with anyone who might be interested in my thought processes.  And also to use as a journal to track my journey to my destiny.  A lot of times I'll just babble, so be prepared for that too :-).  Two things that I've figured out though about going to your destiny: The first is that this is not an easy road to get on and stay on.  And the second is that in order to "head in the right direction" and stay on "destiny's course", you must first be ready at any given moment to give up who you are for who you  can  be.

      This morning I was driving past a beautiful church building of the Latter Day Saints (Mormon).  I wanted to see the inside. It made me wonder what would happen if the names were taken off of all church buildings, how many more people would enter them?  Either leave them blank or just call them a House of Worship.

      When does WANT began to look like NEED?       Can you tell the difference between them? I was talking to a friend recently about the difference between needing people in our lives and wanting them.  And then I had two separate conversations about this yesterday.   Apparently I've given others the impression that I NEED to have my brother live with me.  It's funny that events have occurred to bring up this conversation that's been going on in my head for a few weeks.  I know that I've given him that impression also, and it has not been good for him.  His lack of motivation and his complacency have been enabled by the thought that I need him.  I'll admit that I've been spoiled by him living here; he goes to the store when I don't feel like doing it, cares for the lawn, cleans the kitchen, washes my car and things along that nature.  I knew that we had a problem when he claimed that I would never cut the branches on the bushes growing outside of his room and my office.  He really believed it! So now things have blown up at work and I let him know that he must either find a new place to work or a new place to live, because we can't have both.  He doesn't like the job enough to treat it or me (as his immediate supervisor) with any respect.    I'm slightly amused by the conversation of want or need because I have considered myself 'emotionally autistic' for a long time.  I coined the phrase to describe how I feel when I'm really going through something.  Those times when my best friend says that it's really hard to get through to me.  I know that I shut everything down and everyone out; I don't feel much of anything.  We laugh because I say that it's a good thing that she 'knows' that I love her, because I don't 'feel' a thing.  After I'm done dealing with whatever took me there, it takes a while to get the wall completely down.  So I've been trying to work on this and rely on others to help me get through things.  It's gotta be faster and easier :-).  But I haven't been doing a good job of turning this around because it's a 'want', not a 'need'.  Funny huh?

      GFG's...Gifts From God  People come and go from our lives often, and we may never why.  But it's a very interesting feeling to meet someone and "know" that they are suppose to be in your life.  A knowledge that creates a sense of urgency and panic at the thought of never seeing them again.    The two instances of this phenomenon that stand out most for me happened five years and again a year ago.  Five years ago I was having a conversation with a volunteer at the BGC of Pomona (okay!...it was community service), and among other things she was talking about moving to Arizona.  That's when the panic happened.  So I invited her to a party that I was having at the end of the week, and I was very adamant about her saying yes. She is now my best friend and we laugh at how she thought it was wierd that I was so persistant. (She actually thought I was weird but she couldn't resist my charm).  She admits that because she was shy and guarded, if I hadn't pursued the friendship it would have never become what it is today.  Last year it happend again.  I saw this woman and I would have bet money that we'd me before.  My friends and I eventually began a conversation with her and her husband, and we couldn't figure out where we could have met.  But still there was a comfort that wasn't only a result of the Mai Tai's.  And again I had that feeling that when we all parted that day, it couldn't end there.  So once again I listened to the voice that was saying, "Don't let go, this is going somewhere I promise".  She and I are friends now but we haven't talked about this, and she also must think that it's a little odd that I've put so much effort into making this happen.    That's okay though :-)!  I listened to the voice five years ago and now I've been blessed with three kids, a husband and a wife (inside joke).  And so far I've gotten four friends out of last summers encounter.    So all I can say is never look a gift-God in the mouth.

       Making New Friends   Never limit yourself to one clique…you should belong to several posse’s.  The problem with one clique is that it keeps you from growing and learning new things about yourself.  The importance of making new friends is it reminds you of the good friends you already have.  When you meet someone you like, you can’t help but talk about the good things and people in your life that you’ve probably unknowingly begun to take for granted.  New people ask questions that you make you think about who you are based on your answers.  There are questions that you may have never been asked, or answers that may have changed over a period of time.  Either way, it's important to expand your friendship horizons.  You think?....

      Update...All My Children & Me  When last mentioned, Bianca was hiding the fact that she'd been raped.  Now she's told her best friend and talked her into keeping her secret.  Boy was I annoyed with her best friend! How could she not tell someone? My annoyance has become kind of funny now when I think about it.  Because I go back and forth on whether I would have wanted my best friend at the time, to tell someone who could help me.    My junior year in college (I was 20yrs old), I was "ordered" into counseling by the university for a frat-house drinking incident.  I sat there for six weeks not saying much of anything, and often times sleeping.  My counselor asked me if I'd been molested as a kid and I said no.  I now know how obvious it must have been that I was lying :-).  The point is...no matter how many people can figure out what happened (the fact, not the substance), it doesn't do any good until you're ready for help.  It took me another six years.  So instead of being annoyed when I watch AMC, I have to applaud them for such an accurate portrayal of a really painful situation/topic.

       Who Knew?...   As a kid I remember my grandma and other elders in the family saying that something was a bunch of "rigmarole".  I always thought that it was one of those things/words that older black people, originally from the south used, like epson salt (for everything).  So when I saw it in the dictionary I realized that I should have been paying more attention to my elders.   "Rigmarole"  - rambling talk; non-sense; fussy or time-wasting procedure.

       Don't Drop The Ball!   Imagine life as a game in which we are juggling five balls in the air.  We call them work, family, health, friends, and spirit - and we're keeping all of these balls in the air.  We  soon understand that work is a rubber ball, and if we drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls...family, health, friends and spirit...are all made of glass.  If we drop one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered; they will never be the same.   We must understand that and strive for balance in our lives.

       Intoxicated Concentration is an Oxymoron!   Four years ago I quit drinking.  I started drinking again last summer at the beginning of my vacation.  This summer I'm quitting again, at the end of my vacation, for a few reasons.    One reason is the many goals that I've set for myself this year...starting the company, writing the book and just focusing on getting on and staying on the path that God has set for me.    It's all about "heading in the right direction" and being able to "hear" what God is trying to tell me at all times.  What good is it for God to have this great plan if I don't know what it is.  And He's not holding back His plan for me, I haven't been listening.  But lately some things have been coming in loud and clear, but it seems so big that my fear keeps trying to tone it down or drown out what I'm hearing.

Another reason for the 'brain cell retention program' is that aging is slowing down my memory enough without me helping to speed up the process.

       So Much For Not Wanting Kids!!...   Last week I had a real parental attack.  Mayah, my 3 year old God-daughter/niece (and road-dog) was at the Boys & Girls Club with me as she is everyday.  Suddenly she was choking and I couldn't figure out on what.  She said that she didn't put anything in her mouth, but I wasn't sure.  When she turned red and coughed up some blood, I grabbed her and rushed her to emergency.  The whole way to the hospital, she was screaming.  I had a few seconds of panic, but remained outwardly calm through it all.  My calm almost came to an end as she spoke to her mom on the phone and began to calm down herself.  We were at the hospital and with a nurse and I started to tear up as Mayah talked to Dana on the phone and told her what happened.  She was so cute!  I lost it even more later...Not because during it I thought she would die or anything.  But remembering the look in her eyes when she was so scared and in pain.  I now understand the parental feeling of helplessness that comes from not being able to help your kid.

      Has anyone else noticed that most of my "new" words are negative? At first I thought, "What's wrong with me?", now I realize that these are  words that I never knew because I'm such a nice person.  Yeah right! :-)    'Obsequisious'  - showing too great a willingness to serve; fawning  You must look it up for the proper pronunciation.

       Reading Is Fundamental!   It is often said that if you don't want the general population to know something, put it on paper.  People tend to like their information told to them, e.g. from network news or radio talk shows.    I became interested in the impending triple car tax so I searched for information.  It took me 20 minutes to find out that it was Gov. Pete Wilson (a Republican) that left us with this problem when he gave rebates and cut the tax before he left office.  He also left a law that he signed in 1998 that implements this triple tax in 2003.  I also found articles dating back to January 2003 of Gov. Gray Davis' opposistion to this bill and trying to find a way out of it.  The Republicans used this tax to turn Californians against Davis knowing that (1) he was opposed to it and (2) the general population wouldn't know this because they didn't hear it on the news.  They're probably having a pretty good laugh at the good folks of California.

       The Wrong Description   On a recent episode of Law & Order SVU there was a young man who had been abused by his mother from birth to seven years old.  She would get him up in the middle of the night, make him bathe, scrub him deeply, tie a string around his penis real tight to try to make it fall off. She claimed that all men were evil.   Because this (fictional) woman quoted scriptures and read the bible while she did these things, they referred to her as a 'religious' fanatic.  They often do that on tv and in real life...refer to people who claim that the bible or God told them to do something extremely stupid or crazy, as 'religious' fanatics.  Instead they should call them what they actually are...just plain CRAZY!

       The Wrong Argument   The supreme court is going to rule on whether to leave "under God" in the pledge of allegiance.  You know...  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America; and to the republic for which it stands; one nation, under God, indivisable, with liberty and justice for all.  I think we could argue more about the "indivisable" and "justice for  all ".

       Still Headed In The Right Direction   Lately I've been working on getting my personal projects organized.  Those projects are KingMe Enterprises, Sister-2-Sister Mentors And Volunteers Assoc., Mayah Nicole Navarro (I'm her manager), and Just Venting... (my book).  The fifth project is managing my finances.  I've done a crappy job of the fifth project in the past and that realization hit me hard recently.  I was in church and it was time to give and all I had was $5.  It wouldn't have been bothered if all I had on me was that and I had left my checkbook or something.  But, it was all I had; my bank account was in the negative.  I've never had a problem with being broke...that has to do with my strange realtionship with money (a long story for another time).  It hit me hard because God has blessed me with a well paying job and I had nothing to give back to Him and show my appreciation.  And not for any other reason than being irresponsible.  I sat there trying not to cry (I'm getting emotional thinking about it) because I felt unworthy of all that He's done for me.  It hurt a lot and still does.  So I gave the $5 that I had planned on using to make dinner.  And as God (not luck) would have it, I ended up getting everything I needed to fix the meal by trading and barting :-).   This was just another example of doing what He asks and letting Him take care of the rest.

       My sister Angie warned me that she was going to make me speak at the funeral, so I went prepared (which was good because she kept kicking me until I got up).   "Angie made me get up here.  She had to exert her Executive Oldest Child Leadership Powers, because I’m the shy one.    She asked me to think about the things that my mother passed down to the five of us.  A few things came to mind...bunyons, a crooked pinky and the morning nod.  None of us have a lot to say to anyone before we’ve been up for at least an hour.  The one personality trait that we all inherited from her is “people skills”.  We were all were blessed with her ability to befriend even the un-friendliest person.  Not to say that any of you are unfriendly!  She instilled in us the key to those people skills, and that is to truly love people.  Notice I said Love and not Like...because we’re a somewhat moody brood and sometimes we don’t like you or each other.  But we love you though, and we thank you for coming here today to show us your support and love."

      My sisters and I worked on the obituary...  Sharon Ann Gilmore was the youngest of three children born to Otis and Annie Holmes on November13,1946.  										 Early in life she faced challenges that she refused to be defeated by.  The strength gained in her early years would later provide the foundation necessary to weather her recent storms.  Sharon was a very generous woman.  She opened her home to whoever needed a hot meal and a warm bed.  She never turned away anyone who needed a place to stay even if it meant sacrificing her own comfort, or the comfort of her children.  She loved to cook and she did it well.  A couple of her signature dishes were her peach cobbler and potato salad.  Family and friends would put in requests to have their favorite dish made for special gatherings and she was always willing to oblige.  When asked about her greatest accomplishment, she replied, “my children”.  Sharon gave birth to five children, all different, yet all spoiled.  While making sacrifices for family and friends seemed to come naturally to her, the lengths to which she would go without became more evident when it came to the needs of her children.  She never claimed to be a perfect mother and was fully aware of her mistakes, but she gave all of who she was and what she had to her children.  Sharon leaves in her children Angela Louise, Charlene Marie, Lavinia Ann, Charles Louis, and LaJuan Otis her mark on the world.  De’Andre, Aaryon, Alexandria and Reginae were their Nanna’s pride and joy.    Her sisters Darlene Coleman-Rogers and Ernestine Coleman are her only surviving siblings.

On Monday she had to have her gall bladder removed because of stones.  She didn't recover well...she was in a lot of pain.  And today around 1:30pm she died.

       We All Have An Ark To Build    "Everybody's got a thing..."  Stevie Wonder   God has given us all something specific to do.  Sometimes it takes years to figure out what that thing is.  It may take a while because we're not listening, or we have to go through some things before He get's us where we need to be, to be able to hear Him.  Whatever the reason, there comes a time when some of us find it hard to ignore what we've been asked to do.  How do we know when it's time to build our ark?  Here are a few signs...   1.  We don't want to do it...we think we can't because it's too big or we've never done anything like it before.  All kinds of reasons come up. 2.  No one else thinks we can do it...They might even think we're crazy for thinking it. 3.  There is a persistant nagging in your gut.  No matter how much we try to put it out of our minds, we can't get comfortable in our own skin, and nothing makes us as happy as we know we can be.  One of the things that stands out for me when I watch Joan of Arcadia (one of my new favorite tv shows--Friday nights), is that God stops her from telling anyone that He talks to her.  My theory on this (other than that's how they write it) is that it is not because He knows that people will think she's crazy.   It's because some people will believe her.    What happens after that is she begins to share with someone what her assignments are and they give their input on how she should handle it.  This takes away form her coming up with the answers by just walking by Faith and calling on God when she runs into a wall.  She would feel that she has someone to talk to other than God...who is really all she needs.  A few months ago, I began having a recurring dream.  These dream showed me my ark.  And it was frightening!!  I wont share what it is that I have been asked to do.  But I will say that I have started to collect the building materials.  Those materials include KingMe Enterprises, Sister-2-Sister, Just Venting..., and Tending to  MY  Temple.     "We can't lose with God on our side..."   Stevie Wonder

       Home Is  STILL  Where My Mama Is   The sign on my mother’s front door says, “Home Is Where The Heart Is”.  I kept telling her that she needed to change that to “Home is Where Your Mama Is”.  Have I mentioned how spoiled we were?  I don’t know if it’s the holiday weekend or Stevie Wonder, but I can’t stop the memories or the tears.  I feel like my sister Lavinia did when she was giving birth to her girls...she was in so much pain that she kicked Troy out of the room and screamed, “I want my Mama”!!

       I Know What I Need   I figured out what I need to deal with all of these emotions... I need to get married!  Why?  Because if I'm going to fall apart I want some "cheer-up" sex afterwards.  And since I've been a N.I.W. (Nun In Waiting--I don't get none til I'm married) for 6 years, 1 month, 2 weeks, 4 days and 16 hours, I'm not willing to give up on waiting for the Lord to bless me with the husband that he has planned for me.  So I have to get married soon.  But since I don't know if I've even met "him" yet, I'd settle for a "cheer-up" make-out session. Any takers?

       Was It Expected?   That's the question that I get from people who didn't know about my mother's medical history. It's an equally valid and invalid question.  Even though we knew any surgery would be complicated, and I even predicted the day that she would die, the answer to the question is  Hell No!   No matter how old you are or sick she is, you never expect and are never really prepared for your mother to be gone.    Her doctor told us last June that all of the arteries in her heart were blocked, except for one which had a little space for blood to pass through.  That was almost a year ago, and she's been through a lot since, but she kept bouncing back.    She spoiled us so much that even though I'd pray (when she was in a lot of pain) that God would relieve her of the pain, even if that meant taking her.  In the next breath I'd think, "I take that back, make her better because I'm not ready yet."  So it was a shock when my cousin called to tell me that she died.   It was not expected.

       Good & Terrible   If you saw the movie 'Coming To America' as many times as I have, you will remember when the group Sexual Chocolate was singing and the old man said, "That boy's good".  And the other one said, "Good and Terrible".  (If you didn't see it, it was funny).  Everyone keeps asking me how I'm doing, and that's my answer...good and terrible.  It looks like I'm doing good, and most of the time I am, but...I'm not dealing with this well.  Actually, I'm not dealing with it at all.  Everytime the thought enters my head that I can't call my mother, I change the channel.  I completely shut down and I can't feel anything.  I even avoid looking at pictures.    Tuesday night my sisters and brothers and I went to my mother's house to go through her things.  We all did well..we ate pizza and watched American Idol as we decided who was taking what.  I took a jewelry/music box and a couple of other things.  And they are all still in the trunk of my car.  At this point, I've held it back for so long that I'm just scared of the pain that comes with truly facing it all.    Having both of my sisters go into the hospital in the last two weeks has not helped.

       Thanks...   To everyone who called, e-mailed, sent cards, flowers, plants and money.  It has helped a lot just knowing that you care.  For those who attended the funeral...I am forever greatful.    My reason for letting so many people know about my mother's death was not to get you to come to the funeral.  I've mentioned before that Dana says I have a hard time allowing people to be there for me; so I didn't want to deny anyone that opportunity.  And also, I expect to hear from all of you if something tragic or  great  happens in your lives.

There were so many changes that I did't get to explore when I was there in November for Homecoming.  But at the same time so many things were the same.   It felt so good being there and talking to people who had made such a big difference in my life.  I left ULV feeling like I had just gone home for a visit.  I felt uplifted and loved.  Mayah fell in love with the library!

       Extreme Makeovers   I've decided that I want to be white.  I want a law that says that I can legally put on any document that asks for my race, that I am white. I don't want to chance anything else about me; I will remain ghetto-fabulous, strainght outta Compton (Tarbabe 4 Life). But I want all of the advantages that come with being white.  Written or not, we all know what those advantages are.   I know that some will argue, "how can you claim to be white and it's obvious by looking at you that you are not"?  I looked up Webster's definition of 'white', in regards to race, I know that I don't fit the description, so I want the definition changed so that I can have the right to claim that I am white.  It's not like God said "okay, I'm going to call these people black, those mexican, some asian and some white.  Unlike  marriage , it's a man-made defintion so there shouldn't be a problem making the change.

       Free At Last!    Know ye that the Lord He is God!   I woke up this morning and I felt 10 pounds lighter. I am no longer employed at the Boys & Girls Club of Fontana. I found out yesterday morning. And in the afternoon I took back anything that I had in my house that belonged to them.    Don't cry for me Argentina!!!  This is GREAT news!  Tonight I went to mid-week bible study at my church for the first time in over four years, and I felt like I was reporting for duty.  I told the kids at the Club that I was going to work for my Father. :-)  For those of you who are worried about how I'm going to make ends meet... Don't.   "Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For after all these things the Gentiles seek.  For the heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.  But seek first the kingdom of God and HIS righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you".

      Most days I think I'm doing okay and I thought yesterday was one of those days.  Then I went to visit Mayah before I went to work.  We did our usual tickling and playing and then she decided to draw pictures.  Dana told her to draw a picture of me.  When she drew the mouth she pointed out that she made it a sad face.  Caught me off guard.  When she was done I looked like a sad peanut M&M.  I have to admit that I'm not doing too well with all of the Mother's Day ads and stuff.   ckingme17@aol.com

       Extreme Makeovers (2)    I'm laughing!  My sister read what I wrote about  Extreme Makeovers (5/17/04)  and said that it caused her pause and she wondered if she should be concerned about me.  So I went back and ammended it a little and decided that I should clarify where I was going with it.  Because if Angie didn't get it, nobody else did. :-)  It was meant to be a parody on the re-definition of  marriage , which is an  extreme makeover .  I spent time trying to come up with something that, if I were serious, would upset as many folks (if not more) as those who are not happy about same-sex  marriage  laws.  Wanting to be able to legally claim that I am white would certainly piss off plenty in the good ole U.S. of A.    ckingme17@aol.com

       Dion Fontenot   People keep asking me why I no longer enjoyed working at the Boys&Girls Club, so instead of giving everyone the long answer, I say that it was time to move on.  They still don't get why I would rather be unemployed than have a steady, sufficient income.  So I tell some of them about Dion.  Last summer I had my best group of L.I.T.'s (Leaders In Training-a program at the B&GC), and Dion was one of them.  He had just graduated from High school and came in looking for a job.  I told him that we weren't hiring at the moment.  He asked what he could do to get some training so that he would be prepared when we started hiring.  I was impressed, so I included him in the L.I.T. program.  From mid-June thru the end of August this group of kids worked their butts off.  They were only required to put in 2 hours per day, but they came in around noon and worked unitl 5 or 6pm almost everyday.  They never gave me a problem or complained about doing anything that I asked of them.   I told them about the trip to Lake Tahoe that was scheduled for the end of summer and paid for through the L.I.T. grant for the participants to attend.  They were excited! But when it came time to pick the members to attend the trip, it was decided that previous L.I.T. participants would attend instead of the current group.  Even when they were having trouble getting enough members who 'could' go, they didn't invite the current ones.  I was embarassed and felt bad for them because I knew that it was because of their attachment to me.  I had already been told that I wasn't going, and I was the program director.  Dion and Randy had to witness other staff members going around the club asking kids who had never participated in the program, to call home to see if they could go on the trip. In the end, they filled two spots with the two current L.I.T.'s who had put in the least amount of hours, because they had been members of the club longer.  They had completed 50 to 60 fewer hours than the others.  I was HOT!!!  Fade to November... I asked if the summer L.I.T.'s could be included in the outing to Magic Mountain to participate in the annual Christmas toy drive in December. I was told that they could only go if they came to the Thanksgiving dinner at the Club to help serve the meal.  I was fuming!!!  They now were required to come work some more, so that they could work some more (at the toy drive) in order to get the priviledge of going into Magic Mountain for a few hours after they were done working.  At this point I'm so pissed that my ulcer is bothering me.  But I decide to call them all and give them the choice.  No one was home for the first two calls.  Then I got to Dion... His sister answered the phone and when I asked for Dion she told me that he had died in October.  I was devastated! She told me that he'd had Krohn's Disease (an intestinal disorder).  After I hung up the phone it took everything I had not to start vomitting and/or crying (I was at work alone with the kids on a Saturday).  I sat there thinking how those kids had given us their whole summer and Dion had given us the rest of his life. He knew but never told us that he was sick.  I kept hearing him say "I can't wait to go to Lake Tahoe", because the trip was the week before his 19th birthday.  Instead he died one month after his birthday.  And now the club wanted them to come and  give  more.  That was the day that I knew that I  had  to get away from there.

       Did I Miss Something?   I know that it's been a long time since I've been on a bike, but the last time I rode one we were required to stop for stop signs. Has there been a law change or is it still okay to hit those idiots?

       I Hate Reality TV   First of all it isn't real!&nbsp; People who know that they are being watched are going to act a certain way.&nbsp; They like to say that they forget about the cameras...yeah right!&nbsp; The biggest problem that the bombardment of reality tv shows pose for&nbsp;our society is that it leaves little air time for shows that could show us how things could and should be (same problem with rap music).&nbsp;  I get enough reality from&nbsp;some of my favorite shows like all of the Law and Orders and CSI (Las Vegas).&nbsp;  I've not been a huge sci-fi fan (some exceptions), but at least it requires some imagination.  The best thing that I can say about so many reality shows being on television is that it leaves me with a lot of time to read.  &nbsp;

       The Problem With Rap Music   Last&nbsp;month BET celebrated 25 years of rap music.&nbsp; They put on a great tribute which I really enjoyed and it stirred in me a sense of pride at the fact that we started something that's still going strong.&nbsp; They say that rap music lives because it reflects the realities of life for our black culture.&nbsp; Okay...but we've been talking about that now for the past 25 years.&nbsp; When do we switch the conversation (lyrics) to what could and should be instead.&nbsp;   I must say that I&nbsp;agree with everything that Dr. Bill Cosby has to say about how inadequately we are raising our kids.&nbsp; And I'd like to add that like Moses did for the Jews, Martin Luther King showed us the promise land.&nbsp; But since his death, we've chosen to stay in the wilderness.&nbsp;&nbsp;   We must change our perception of slavery and take into consideration that God allowed us to be brought&nbsp;over here because this is where He wanted us.&nbsp;   In four years we will have completed our 40 year stint in the wilderness.&nbsp; Are we going to stay there are start living up to our God-given potiential?  &nbsp;  &nbsp; ckingme17@aol.com

       Never Too Late    This morning when I got to the gym there was a hearse parked in the lot.&nbsp; I found it more than slightly amusing that someone had&nbsp;driven to workout in a hearse when that's usually a ride reserved for when you don't exercise.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ckingme17@aol.com

       'Y' is the Problem   Everybody does it, when&nbsp;we see a kid running around out of control and the parent(s) are not in control of the situation we say, "why don't&nbsp;you do something about&nbsp;your kid?"&nbsp; When a kid gets a gun and shoots someone its, "why did your kid do it"?&nbsp; When a kid&nbsp;accidently kills another kid by doing wrestling moves its,&nbsp;"why did you let your kid watch that stuff"?&nbsp; When a kid gets&nbsp;gang raped at a party that she thought it would be Cool&nbsp;to be at because&nbsp;that's what they do&nbsp;on TV or&nbsp;in the movies its, "why did you let your kid watch those things?"&nbsp; I could give scenario after scenario of horrific things that kids are getting themselves into.&nbsp; But what I really want to&nbsp;know is...   does anyone else notice that if you take the 'Y' off of 'your' you get "OUR"?    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ckingme17@aol.com

       Being Held Hostage   OPEC refuses to increase their output of crude oil; Shell Oil wants to shut down some drills in Bakersfield which would increase their gas prices; I've seen more gas stations being built in the past year than in the pre-war years (they were closing down before); All of the major oil companies are showing temendous profits&nbsp;for the past year.  Whose really holding the sword?  We'll know that we've won the war on terrorism when the gas prices have gone down.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Idiotic Comment    I heard someone say recently that celebrities should stay out of politics and keep their opinions to themselves.&nbsp; What they should have said is, "we don't want to know your opinion unless we don't know who you are".&nbsp; Either way you look at it is ridiculous.&nbsp; Next you could say that we don't want to know what truck drivers have to say, or landscapers, or doctors or people under 30.&nbsp; You get my point.&nbsp; To say that because they have the spotlight they should not use it to speak their minds is back asswords.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ckingme17@aol.com

       Timing Is Everything   Almost four years ago our president got his job by what a lot of people consider to be questionable means.  But in less than a year after taking office he became a national hero, even for some who were previously against him.  What timing...  Once again our president is faced with not being the most popular person in the country.  I've recently stated to some friends that my fear is that something drastic and serious is going to have to happen to change those emotions.  At first I thought that dragging Osama bin Laden out of a cave in August or October would help him save face and re-gain popularity.  But now I don't know if that will be enough.   But there's another possibility...what better way to avoid losing an election than to not have one?  Talking about job security!  Which takes us back to my fear... what has to happen to make this so?       ckingme17@aol.com

      Believe of Not Believe  The other day on The View a doctor was describing how he came to his relationship with Christ (he wrote a book about it).&nbsp; The thing that most interested me was that he said that he doesn't call himself a "Christian" because of all of the terrible things that "Christians" have done, and he doesn't want to be associated with that.&nbsp; He calls himself a follower of Christ instead.&nbsp; Can't argue with the follower of Christ statement, but to say that you don't want to be called a "Christian" because of the bad things that have been done...  I guess we shouldn't call him a "man" because of all of the evil things that they have done in the world.&nbsp; Just call&nbsp;him male.  Or I don't want to be called a woman because Eve talked Adam into eating the forbidden fruit and led us all into sin!&nbsp; Just call me female.  If he believes that Jesus is the Christ, and believes he died for our sins, etc.... I must say, if the beliefs fit...wear it!  &nbsp;  &nbsp; ckingme17@aol.com

      Must Be On The Right Road   Saturday I flew back from Florida where I went for the wedding of one of my best friends.&nbsp; Up until about 12 years ago you would have never gotten me on an airplaine.&nbsp; I admit that my control issues extend to my need to have my feet somewhere near the ground and steady. This is also the reason that I don't swim.   I credit my stronger relationship with God as the reason that I don't panic at the thought of being up that high.&nbsp; I even ask for a seat next to the window.   On the the flight from&nbsp;Houston there was probably an hour and a half of turbulance in the 3 hour trip&nbsp;to LAX.&nbsp; I was amazed at how calm I felt.&nbsp; I just kept thinking, "God has a plan for me, and I'm just getting started so I'm not going to die today".&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived safely at LAX and was picked up by my best friend.&nbsp; (She's going to kill me for saying this...)&nbsp; Her driving scares the hell out of me!&nbsp; She drives very fast even when she's doing those distracting things that we all do.&nbsp; Plus she moves in and out of lanes.&nbsp; During the drive I closed my eyes alot or turned towards her to talk and not look where we were going.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't so sure that I was going to live anymore.  I thought, "I'm too late, maybe I took to long to listen to what God wanted me to do".&nbsp; I shook that off and thought that maybe we would just be in an accident.   But guess what!&nbsp; We got pulled over by a CHP officer.&nbsp; I was so busy trying not to look at anything but her that I never saw him.&nbsp; I was&nbsp;worried that we got stopped because that's a terrible feeling.&nbsp; He gave her a break and didn't give her a ticket for speeding, just for window tinting.   The rest of the ride was done close to the speed limit.&nbsp; It didn't hit me until today that getting pulled over was God looking out for us.&nbsp; So I feel like I must be Headed In The Right Direction!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ckingme17@aol.com

        West Nile Fever    A couple of days ago I was telling my sister that I had a problem with the fact that insecticides were being sprayed in the air to kill masquitos. It bothered me because I hadn't heard about it before they'd done it, so that I could make sure not to be outside, because that couldn't be healthy.  Last night I was sitting at my desk and I heard the buzzing. I looked around to see where it was coming from but did not see what was making the noise. And then I spotted it out of the side of my eye, coming at me. It was a pretty big misquito! I panicked, lifted my elbow to keep it from flying directly at my face. But in the meantime, the telephone that I was holding in my hand nailed me in the mouth. I busted my lips...yeah lips, in the plural! The right side of my top and bottom lips were swollen and the bottom one was bleeding pretty good.  In my pain the only thing I could think of was when are they going to spray on my street!  ckingme17@aol.com
