      They lost and they lost bad. I am a Laker fan and a lot of people might condemn me for being one. It could be because people consider the L.A. Lakers as an overrated team, I guess so, they are, but they were a team of great talents up until Karl Malone got injured, the team lost a leader, and things got messy around on court. I've read so many articles castigating The Lakers for losing against the Pistons. I guess for not meeting up to the expectation them writers have set-up and not the team and forgetting that the Piston were the healthy team, the better team and Lakers were playing hurt and away. I dont know how to put it in words what I feel while I listen and read over and over the statements Payton, Malone, Bryant, and O'neal are giving to reporters. How they are torn apart by the sad and heavy emotions of fighting hard but coming off short and way short, and now the news that most of them may not come back next year. The Zen Master says it's a slim chance he'll be back next season. Pistons was a great Team but I wonder why we are more interested on how much the Lakers have lost and will lose more this summer. The Pistons is a great team by winning the championships, But I dont think they'll be back next year to defend it, The Lakers? I there's a hazy smoke and some are saying the Purple and Gold linings are fading...

I read his lines with bitternes and a bit of embarrasment to the people that he is. quite ashamed i guess that eventhough he's far from home,the garbage of his land, as he sees it, comes crashing through his proud half-breed and half-cultured life. 
Blame it to the Society that introduced us to the West. Like a battered oriental cowboy who will always settle on second-hand economy and Salvation Army progress. I am what I am now a pinoy influenced by western civilization but It wont change who i am. i still eat saluyot, boil okra and sauce it bagoong. im an ilocano from pangasinan a son of the farmlands and i will not be ashame of that even if my mind has been fed with the white mans thinking. i've learn only to be proud of what i am and not of what i want or others want me to be... 

Yesterday i saw Patricia Evangelista on the tube and heard her winning speech "Blonde and Blue Eyes." Made me proud to be a Filipino.

      The song runs through my head like a cd player programed to loop. After reading a blog here somewhere that Andy Kaufman's back and his hiding somewhere. Im a big Fan of Andy Kaufman after watching Man on the Moon. Even became a follower of Jim Carrey and respecting his genuine talent and mediocrity that the most wouldnt understand and us would cherish and live for. "...Andy did you here about this one..." its goes and it goes repeatedly hearing Michael Stipe's voice looping around my subconscious hearing. And the feeling still goes like History trying to redeem everyone. Maybe its all about redemption, about the idea of changing our lives with our own choice and not caring about the one dimensional and majority rule human race that we are...
Its great goofing on Elvis, or its just a euphismism of blasphemously goofing on "The King" if you know what I mean. "...Would you believe, they put a man on the moon..."

      What a weather we've been having lately...a strange concoction of sweet crimson afternoon and hazy melodrama of the morning. I've been suffering from an inflamed sinus for over a month now but it seems i hurt more on my medications. I must have caught an allergy on that fuckin keyboard i have at work and now i've developed a chronic sinusitis. Damn I still have 3 more weeks to go.

Put a little sugar on it...while the citrus juice blend in with the mixture of water and lime. I wish i had vodka to kill me. Sweat in this sarcasm of afternoon and melt with embarrasment. I see Saturn's dust now, with the pictures sent to Earth, we formulate theories from datas sent off by that billion dollar buggy, of what the future will behold and the past of Solar System that has unfolded billion of years before us. A system inside a system.

You go to sleep youg boy!!! I wish i could. slumber in a deep froth and clouds of whipped cream. I feel comfort in your poisonous caffiene. I still managed to fool myself on a choreographed breathing and static movement. ahhhh...

What a Strange view below...can i call you?

      A good long weekend for most of us, "Fourth of July" celebration in the States. For us here in the Philippines, just an extra day off from work. Well, for most of us who work in call centers that is. Blame it on Globalization, I suppose...
I still wonder why we have'nt got a glamorous Independence Day since 1998 or was it 1996? see? I can't even remember it. I think we owe it to our motherland that we give her a decent celebration every year. I love my country, eventhough we have a pathetic excuse for a government, I love her still. And Im proud to be here, and I think most of us should be. PRIDE, this is a good emotion when felt on the right situation, Pride on ones self is not good,its called arrogance. that's why we have HUMILITY. I think we should only be proud on others... 
Damn my headache is still killing me, I cant stop complaining eversince I got this stupid sinusitis. I gtg for a while...I cant think right!!! Let's smoke mahn!

      Your eyes are old,
and you look more tired than you use to.
Your smiles reflects a taste of bitterness in life,
but you dispute it with humor and delight.

You bear an angel in your womb,
from the concept of happiness and love.
Where a smile you commit lavishly spread with brilliance in this universe,
and misery in mine.

My fate has changed all of a sudden.

      Spontaneity is not much of me anymore, since I went in this city and stayed in it, I lost a bit of the sense of pureness and unpredictabilty that I was before I arrived. It must have been a cause of over romantizing the idea of staying and being here in Metro Manila. I never really thought it could turn me sad at the lowest point since I thought I would be busy doing a lot of things in this big place. Unfortunately I was wrong and overrated things that I wanted. Actually, I've never really done any of the things that I wanted, since most of them here would require me of to either lay out my plans or at the very least organize a schedule in a day's course to achieve things. I never really want to achieve much, neither was I built to compete with everyone. I didn't brought-up myself like that. I hated to act like one much more be one...I don't care if I don't make much sense in their industrial race what I care about is that I make sense in my own pure way, sure thing is that its eating me up alive. 

Missed the Incubus concert, I would have worked my ass off to get a fuckin ticket but unfortunately I spent my money on the most important things. Dang, 5 years ago I would have worked my way out just to get there even without a ticket and pogo or ruined the mosh pit with most of my chicken dance and shits...Good thing i had a hell of a blast in a reggae gig two weeks ago and and showed my eccentricities of the youthful world that I have to the new generation that was more of a spectator rather than be participants. creating a rain of beer in a sweaty mosh pit and banging my head to the tunes and crying lyrics of a Bob Marley song. Kid's look at me like i was a sheep that just got out a cage. now i wonder, are these kids growing on a manufactured culture and second-hand arts? my guts says they are...our parents said were damned then, i say generations now are burnt... 

Since Cobain died I guess our generation had to compromise our angst and deal with the longing that a hero one day would emerge and would blasphemously proclaim "I'm Back!" I'd like to believe id be there when Whomever shouts that angst. Right now I'd be okay listening to Ross' voice humming his way to hopefullnessville and more Fuckin Paolo santos crap revivals...
