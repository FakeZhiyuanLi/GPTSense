      now im in sch n i have no mood to do anything at all.im all bottled up n i dont feel like doing anythin.i just wan to go home n sleep it all off n hopefully wake up better n feeling all fresh n happy.i dont like this feeling at all.i have this gut that if anyone is going to read my blog entry for this, they r going to get extremely offended and thats not nice.but i cant help but write it out.i can pen it down but if i do my hand will ache like im writin some screwed up essay.everything is annoyin me.i seriously think its PMS but i dont know how to deal with it.SCREW EVERYTHING.dont mind any vulgurities that im going to use cause i need it to keep me sane!  fuck this who inferiorty complex thing cause i think thats the cause for all this unwanted pain n toture.i feel unloved.yes thats how i feel.i feel that im just FRENS n not even know them well enough with everyone else n that sucks.no one to talk to.no one to just let me cry.i watch me cry u dont have to say anything.just hear me out.i need someone.fuck now im cryin.n everyones probabily gonna see me n think im some mad idiot whos boyfren just broke up with.even if kamal broke up with me i dont think ill feel as rotten as i feel now.basically i feel helpless.i wish i had something to change in everyone to suit me.im a horrible n evil person.thats what i have learn.i am evil.i have no good side in me.im a selfish piece of useless living material.i just wan to achieve everything n be the best.i talk too much for my own good.no need but i do.i always think im right.i cant change my mindset.im freakin STUBBORN!i wan everything MY WAY! what is wrong with me?! how can i change this stupid unwanted characteristic of me?mayb its because of this that everyone seems to be hating me.no one trusts me, loves me, cares for me n just cause i can cover up, but not lately, everyone thinks im a happy go lucky person.this sucks.i think i better not pin point anyone out cause it will just prove how dark i m inside.full of vicious thoughts n hopes.fuck.i shouldnt have been given a chance to live.im just makin things so bad around me.  i went for trainin yesterday.felt good but it was all temporary.i think im just plain lazy then anything else.as i said i talk too much for my own good.there was once when we were havin a team talk n ms lim said that we r a team, n each of us is part of the team.like how a body works.n of course kavi gets the mouth.haha.it sounded funny then.it may still sound funy.but to think bout it, ths is the impression i have created to ppl to look at me.a loud speakin irritatin non stop chatter box.y?!?!?!y did i bring this shithole upon myself.i so wanted to start anew.i wanted to go somewhere good..i din mind somewhere new.someone i knew i could have achieved whatever i wanted n not get held back because of my pass doings.to think bout it, it was my social behaviour.wantin to always b in the limelight.wantin e attention.wantin to b noticed.all this only brings the downfall of a person i learnt!to think bout it, nj is not for me.it never was.why did i come?!only cause i could have gotten my appeal easily.to think bout it, i dont even deserve it.i din even complete my trainin.i can never be as sad as how huiyi was when she got her ligaments torn.i could see the sincere saddness.but to think bout it, do i feel it?i wanna achieve n be a very good player, without any hardwork.im plain lazy.how m i supposed to do it.maisha is good naturally.how i wish i was like her.its goin very easy for her.n i cant accept it.she didnt do anything wrong.but why m i feeling this way?is it cause she can still maintain a strong frenship with ash n sangee n i cant even have a decent, with no silence in between conversation with them?my cedar team just seems so bonded together.i dont feel the bond.is it cause i looked for love too fast?yea.its my fault.its all my fault.i shouldnt have gone to get to knoe many indians.mayb its my fault.no its DEFINITELY my fault.so badly mine.mayb i should have just stuck on to SD.but not i shouldnt have even started out with me.MK was a failure.i hate the fact i even was with me.kamal seems to be good.infact the best.but there r the good n bad points.what m i supposed to do.i feel like im livin in fear everyday.livin in fear to offend someone.living in fear to make kamal angry.living in fear to make ppl happy.living in fear ill do something wrong.i dare not tell kamal everything.i dare not tell ANYONE anything in that fact.in the fear they will look at me as an insecure person.in the fear they will judge me.in the fear they will think im just a normal girl, which is not what i wan.i am fortunate.but not as fortunate n good as i should be.i seem to b the black sheep in my family.thats how i feel.horrible  i feel better writing.but i cant say everything is out.mayb onli 15% of my true feelings are out.i dont know how im going to deal with it.i just hope i dont spoil kamals day this weekend.thats the least i can do.i have one day to pick myself up n try forget everything n just enjoy everything i possibily can.thats the best solution.i think ill have to cry myself to sleep.n now that my sisters back, its not that easy.fuck my mum is going to think im fightin with kamal.i just wish everyone would leave me on my own! let me do the things i want! yes no doubt im stressed.but do u realise ure not helpin me out! i cant posibily go tell my mum every problem?neither can i tell kamal cause he thinks im always cryin n yea wan to yell.i dont know.im lost.im just in a HUGE puzzle.tryin to figure my life out.i so wan to run away.i dont have money.i hope i get sars in china.haha..then i can die eventually.im afraid of death.but thats bout all i think bout.sigh.i dunno whats going to happen to me!i think like rahul said, im gonna go thru a break down.just when im recovering.like a sickling.i dont wan to b labeled weak.do u GET THAT?! im not.im just not understood.sigh  kav
