      Today I got my grounded on top of being grounded.. Therefore I have to stay in on the May 24 weekend which is pretty hellish if you ask me. My house is turning into a fucking nazi prison (don't take offense to that) No going out. No Msn. No conputer. No visitors. No food. ah i lied about that last one.. But honestly.. Its going to resort to that sooner or later.. I might as well get shipped off to boarding school for "bad girls" I need to get my frusteration out...  FUCKUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKUCKFUCKFUCK.. that helped.. Well this has been an interesting evening.. Thats all for now.. peace out.. Anita..

       Today I am grounded. Long story. I'm quite mad at the moment becuase my mom has locked me up in this hell hole. Anyways.. no complaints.. "the sun is shining.. the birds are chipring.. the kids are skateboarding" (emilie) I tried to get cheered up by watching vidoes on ebaums world, but even shfifty five didn't seem to help. Well on a happier note, its a nice day out.. too bad Im not allowed out. But all is fair.. School is tomorrow which isn't too fun but ah well. My mom told me that I'm grounded "until the cows come home" I truly don't understand that statement.. but I guess thats the whole point. AHHHH well.. I'm going to see how many times I can walk around my house in an hour.. then try to beat it..  Peace out
