      Hello there my brothers and sisters in revolution               I've had a frank discussion with Peter Sawatzky, and we are in agreement that a large scale blogging revolution must take place - it must be all encompassing. More posts, more ideas, more activity. No Apathy. I've been writing at www.xanga.com/somethingzen for quite a while now, but I decided to give blogger a try, just to make sure that I have chosen to best way to blog. I'm a little put-off initially, it's a different environment, but I'm not going to let that keep me from giving it a fair chance. Either way, through xanga or blogger (the medium is not important, the medium is -not- the message) we have got to get the word across.        I figure maybe I should introduce myself, after all I'm new here, aren't I? I am a writer, in the most literal sense. I have finished the draft of a novel I haven't bothered to name yet, and I'm working on short stories pretty much steady. I'm waiting two months for my draft to mature, waiting until I'm ready to edit the thing. You get the idea. But writing isn't the end of it. I'm a young Buddhist, with a scary amount of dedication to Buddhist practice and the following of Dharma as purely as possible. I'm not very good at it, but I try very hard. I'm a Theravada/Zen Buddhist, and I live in the west so crossing two very different traditions like that is acceptable. Beyond even that, I'm a political thinker. I am a socialist, in a broad sense of the word. I have read Marx, and I don't agree with all of it, but I greatly respect the ideology of communism, and the spirit it represents. That said, I'm not sure pure communism has a place in the modern world, especially after Marxism-Leninism has twisted it so fully that I'm not sure it could ever recover. Socialism, however, lives on. The ideology that it is immoral for rich men to sail around on yachts while women and children die in the streets of starvation. Does that make sense to you? It should. There is nothing wrong with redistribution of wealth according to fairness, and laws should be passed in the interests of those who need them most, not those who have the most economic or political power. Politics should be focused on the helpless and the voiceless, not on the bourgeois who use their connections and money to engineer government into an engine working in their favor. That's my little red rant.

             I am in a particularly strange and unfamiliar mindset. Yesterday was a scary and overwhelming day with much looking over my shoulder, and staring into nowhere. I am more grounded today, but still a little violent and strange. I need more meditation. Then again, that is my cure for everything. But sitting is hard to do too, because my head aches.         But this will probably be my last post before embarking on a journey to our province's capital of Fredericton, to go to the Aventis Biotech Challenge(science project) shindig, where my group will most certainly be the worst and least organized, and have our already unseaworthy project torn to shreds by a panel of Phd's. We also get to listen to some speakers about the industries of science and research, in which I have little to no interest. After that I split from my science compatriots Nate and Pete, and stay in that city of dreams to partake in the Student Legislative Seminar. I'm interested in Politics, so it shouldn't be all that mind numbing, but provincial politics in particular can be yawn inducing, and I'm bracing myself for the worst. I have only one good dress shirt, and dress pants that are too small for me, and need to be dressed formally for the whole three days of academia, so I'll have to figure something out. In general, I'm most looking forward to being out of the city. There is something beautiful and sacred about being on the road and out of your comfort zone, and I want to embrace that. I just hope my headaches clear up, and I'm able to keep from shaking and stuttering through the weekend as the mess I am now. I'll tell you after its all finished.

      Rough day filled with neurosis and headaches and the vague feeling that there is a science project noose tightening around my neck, and that there is no place to escape to. My eyes are red from sore contacts, and shifty suspicious. My arms are trembling but I haven't had any caffeine. It is going to be a long and frightening night.

      I've been reflecting quite a bit lately, about the format of a weblog.  It occured to me, probably for the first time ever, that no one who reads this is Buddhist, or understands what I'm talking about, especially since I use all kinds of lingo in Pali, the language of the Himalayas. But it runs deeper than that. I started this blog at xanga, under somethingzen, in the interest of writing a blog about the teenage Buddhist experience, but I am no longer so sure that public exposure is good for my day-to-day Dharma practice. It is vain, I think, and at the very least pointless. I am at the point now where there must be more doing, and less saying. I am going to change the focus of the blog. I will still mention Buddhism, it is an inseperable part of my life, probably it will be mentioned in anecdotes of Satoris (momentary illuminations), but besides that it will be phased out. The blog will remain up as a journal about writing, and as an avenue for stories about friends, and thoughts about philosophy and the cosmos, and everyday nonsense a person has to deal with. Basically - it's becoming a little more normal. I hope you'll stick around. If anyone has any questions about anything, or wants to know something personal, just email me.

       It is always rough when you see bad traits in yourself.   Yesterday I was talking to my friend Erin, who is Catholic and has tried meditation through chanting in Latin. She said that she had a very transcendental experience, which bothered me somewhat. What I told her was that I was concerned, because meditation is a powerful thing, and can hurt you spiritually rather than help you if you handle it wrongly, or before you are ready. Don't get me wrong, everything I said was valid. Many people have had their spiritual practices harmed by wrong meditation. The suttas expound carefully that meditation is the conditioning of the deepest mind, and not to be done without careful attention. So I was justified in my answer right? I was concerned for her spiritually, and so I expressed it, right? wrong. Sometime this afternoon the Buddha gave me a kick in the ass. I realized a couple of things very unforgivingly, and saw a very ugly side of myself. I realized first - I developed a superiority complex about being Buddhist. I believe it so strongly I see other people as ignorant and almost...undeserving somehow of happiness. Not consciously, but I did develop that view. Also, I was jealous. I thought maybe she had achieved some kind of meditative state I haven't develloped yet, as I am still slugging along, sitting for a half hour every day, struggling with an unresponsive and unclear mind. I felt very bad when I realized this, because it means that the values which I value most - humility and compassion - have been compromised in me. I also realized how easy it is to lie to yourself. I really did think I was concerned for Erin's spiritual safety. But it wasn't about Erin, it was about me. I'm just glad I caught myself.    I take refuge in the Buddha I take refuge in the Dharma I take refuge in the Sangha may all beings be realized freedom from greed freedom from hatred freedom from ignorance may all beings be realized All living things are  equally to be loved equally coming Buddhas

      Ah, the Reading.  First of all, I was deeply touched that so many people came out to see and support me in something that is pretty important to me. Justin Read, Pete, Liz and Laura were all there, and my compatriot Andrew R. would have liked to be, but was at home feeling quite sick. It was certainly a good show, and everyone there did a great job. I wish I had a better grasp of the French language, and could understand better what the francophone speakers were saying, because they spoke very quickly. I enjoyed all of the readings though. I was very nervous when I went up to speak, but those in attendance said it didn't show, despite the fact I mixed up my words a couple of times and felt like I was shaking!  I think the best part for me was the overwhelming support and kindness from people. My friends and family were very supportive and encouraging, as was the master of ceremonies, and a very kind Spanish man named Sergio (I think, I may have heard wrong) who is writing a book about his process of immigration here, which sounds very interesting. Everyone was very kind, and probably inflated my ego much more than was necessary! But still it was nice, especially after this morning's parental discussion about how " It's impossible to make a living writing fiction", and a full year of writing for an hour a day amidst yelling, pots clanging, tv turned way up, radio on, and general noise pollution, and occasional shouts to "stop that infernal typing!" It was a very good experience to get up in front of people who are excited by books and read something, and have them enjoy it. I could get used to that kind of thing.

      It's the day of the reading! I rejoice in the Northrop Frye literary goodness, although I will most certainly botch and frighten all of the other high school writers who share the stage with me, and their various families. " The Insomniac"(the short story I'll be reading) is quite succinct, and is my answer to the question "Is it possible to think yourself to death?" It's really a very morbid and disjointed story, even more so than the Benzedrine Angel story, and Sonya. It should be fun to read though, and it's the first real encouragement I've got on my pathway to publication and international fame (A guy can dream, right?)  I will write later on with the details of the reading, unless I totally botch it, at which case I'll be on a bus to start a new life in Tijuana, and I probably won't bother updating.

       Hello my wonderful comrades. If you're reading this I'm assuming you care. Not feeling so hot. Nothing in particular triggers these things, they just happen, and most people (Erin) who have known me long enough know that it is just a reality that I am moody. People noticed today though, which was a little strange. The Chuk(English teacher) asked me what was wrong, and I figured I was less conspicuous than that. Anyway. I spent fifth period today thinking about my own death, and I wrote a nice little poem about it. I am a little paranoid, and I feel cold, and my first thoughts are pessimistic ones. I got a needle today. But think about this, what does the blues teach us? If you ain't got no girl to ease your pain, nor any reason to keep going, nor any redeeming grace, nor anything valuable to your name, It ain't no thing, man. It ain't no thing. Cause you got  you , man, and a guitar. And that's good enough for the blues.   Incidentally, people were bothering me all day about various things. This Saturday I'm doing a prose reading of my short story "The Insomniac" at the  C'est la vie Cafe  at 4:30, and anyone who reads this and digs it is wholeheartedly welcome, and I'm counting on a few of you to be there. It should be a good time, and it's something I take pretty seriously. The the weekend after next I take off on a big happy bus to Fredericton, the capital of this fine province, for the Aventis Biotech challenge. See Pete's blog for all of the icky E coli related details. After Aventis, I don't come home. I stay in the city for the Student Legislative Seminar, which I found today I've been accepted to. It should be a good little thing to add my resume, especially if I end up studying Political Science. It should be a good time, although I'll be tired by the time I get back. Hopefully Pete and I will do some hotel room blues jams going at Aventis, and I'll be all on my own at the Legislative Assembly, free to stay up all night and write on hotel stationary, and eat breakfast at 5am (after a night without sleep) of a croissant and a cafe au lait (like Hemingway). It should be good, and I'm looking forward to it. At least it's a weekend out of town.

      I thought to myself most innocently today, a question and answer that have made me quite happy.  Q. What is the awakened mind?  A. Imagine a seed, the size of the nail on your pinkie finger, frail and tiny. Imagine the seed buried under 2 metres of mud, which stews with manure and bacteria. Imagine that this seed grows into a plant, which blossoms with so many flowers, that they could cover all of the world's oceans. Now imagine that all of these flowers decay and are gone. This is the awakened mind

      I finished reading Howl by Allen Ginsberg again, and I am consistently amazed by the depth of beauty, and the intensity of that poem, despite its profanity and such. I think that the opening line to that poem has been burned into my mind forever... " I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked." Allen Ginsberg has been the greatest (ok, you caught me - only) influence on my poetry. If you haven't read Howl you must, as in right now. You can find it on the internet for free. It's a little lengthy, but easily possible to read in one sitting, even if you contemplate every word like I do. Speaking of poetry, I developed a plan in fifth period today. I will take every random poem I write, the two sides crumpled pieces of looseleaf with nonsense and hallucination scrawled all over them, and give them to Andrew R (my trusted beatnik compatriot) for safekeeping. When I die (hopefully with some renown for prose writing) I will ask him in my will to edit and publish those poems, giving the proceeds to charity. The main part of the plan I like is writing lots of random poetry and never seeing it again, but knowing it very well may come to some use. I wouldn't care very much if the whole lot of it burned either, so there's nothing lost.   There is a lot of writing going on right now. I have pulled out the manuscript of my novel, which will be called either "Place of Refuge", or "No Utopia" (I haven't decided, maybe the correct name is still out there somewhere) and I am editing it. There are parts I really like, and I smiled as I reread them, but there are also parts that made me want to be sick they were so amateurish. The first few chapters feel forced, like I was trying to fill space or something. There are long elaborate paragraphs, very poorly written, about hallways and turning on and off lightswitches. It's gross. There are also, however, delightful bits about the scenery and atmosphere, and  some  good bits about the characters, although they don't really flourish until later on. My theatre arts group (made of my the aforementioned beatnik compatriot and two others) is writing a musical version of a fable, the one about the goose that layed the golden eggs. It's quite wonderful actually. In addition to this, I'm writing an MLA essay on Jack Kerouac's invention of "Spontaneous prose" and the style's influence on the beat generation, which is quite a lot of fun. There is a lot of writing going on right now, and I'm soaking it all in.  Beautiful weather is beginning to surface, and I love it. Warm days and warm wind reaffirm my belief that when recognized for what it really is (beautiful emptiness) the world is perfect. My meditation schedule has become quite rigorous, compared to the past. I meditate for 30-45 minutes every night, and keep a journal of how well my concentration and mindfulness was, and what hindered it. So far I've been having a lot of headaches, and a little bit of backpain, and way too much laziness and inability to concentrate, but I think already I am beginning to see an improvement. Certainly the mind is more receptive and controlled, and conducive to positive mind states after meditation. I am firmly convinced that a good meditative practice is the healthiest thing for anyone, because it inevitably leads to Dharma, which leads to realization. What I want though, is a teacher. I've talked with a lot of Buddhists (even monks) online, and there is a consensus in everything I've read and heard that someone who is serious about following Dharma should not practice without a teacher for very long, because everyone needs help. Sure, the Buddha didn't have a teacher, but he was also a Bodhissatva with many lifetimes of perfection on his side. There are no teachers here in Moncton (I think, no theravada anyway) but when I go away to University I hope to find one). I am beginning to realize that while I am talking about Buddhism no one understands it, so maybe my next post will be a superbrief explanation of Buddhist beliefs and the terminology I use all the time (Buddha, Bodhissatva, Dharma, Dhyana, Tathagata, metta, Sattipattana, Karuna, Arhant, that kind of thing).   Much metta(lovingkindness) to everyone, especially those who have leapt to the other side of the blogging river to read my site here, even after I have unwillingly departed from xanga. :D

      Well for some reason Xanga has abandoned me in my time of need, and so I have switched sides and now blog faithfully for Blogger. Sure, I don't like it as much, but I can view my blog goddamit. *clears throat* Anyway, let's get down to business shall we?  I went to a little shindig last night, in all likelihood the last shindig for a while, until summer at least. It was in glorious celebration of the eminent Matt Phillips' return to University. He's going to UNB which is a dirty and largely useless school, but we decided to celebrate with him nonetheless. I have abruptly developed a conscience towards drinking though, which is not to say that I didn't drink anything last night, just that I felt guilty about it. How am I supposed to cultivate mindfulness while dulling the mind at the same time? How can I even take my Dharma practice seriously while drinking alcohol? It shouldn't be difficult not to drink either, because I have never been particularly fond of being drunk, like a lot of my friends. There's not very much joy in it for me. I've had some good times, but there was also a night I remember, drinking to escape from a moderate depression, when the whole experience was just miserable and didn't really help anything. I didn't drink too much, there was no hangover or anything, just the sensation of sadness and the inability to alleviate suffering through drinking. So the point of this little rant is that I am seriously considering renouncing all intoxicants, a precept I should have taken long ago for the good of my Dharma practice. I did have fun last night though. We played cards, and I meditated with Lisa( Matt's girlfriend) who happens to be able to squish into a full Lotus position (jealous). She went on about making your soul leave your body and stuff, and since I don't believe in souls, or spirit guides, or anything of that sort it was quite uninteresting to me.   There is something about spring that makes people lonely, and you can tell just by watching people as they walk by throughout the day. It's wierd, probably hormonal, but it happens. Even I, an old Bhikkhu who is very used to living on my own (years without relationships:2, succesful relationships:0...YaY) feel that familiar pang of loneliness. Yet I'm not about to sign up for matchmaking just yet. I have pretty much nothing to offer anyone, and I couldn't even spend time with a girl, because I live too far out in the country and don't have my driver's license yet. I am thinking about getting together a committee to find my good friend Pete a woman though. Ladies, anyone interested?

      Well this has been a very boring, very rainy, very uneventful weekend. Basically I've just been writing the book (which is coming along nicely, and about 1/15th finished, what a milestone, huh?) and reading and sleeping. I watched two hour long documentaries on Japanese history. I've decided to relinquish my grudge against modern Japan, as long as they promise to stop being so damn capitalist. The deal is in process, and I think they'll agree. Anyway, Japan is just an awesome country with a few drawbacks (everyone here who likes Japan watches entirely too much anime, which (I'm sorry) is kinda stupid., and there are too many people living there, and they make all kinds of high tech gadgets I don't care about and frankly don't trust.). I had Indian food for dinner tonight, and I LOVED it. I had Butter Chicken (curiously unbuttery), Kalachi Chicken, and some basmati rice and tasty flatbread. Very spicy, and magically delicious. I have promised myself that I will learn to make both Indian Butter Chicken, and Vietnamese Lemongrass soup. I'd also like to try some of the vegetarian recipes that come out of Southeast Asia. In Short, I have nothing of any interest to write here, but I'm writing anyway, because I can.

      In my brief experience, novels start out rough. For No Utopia (my first novel/flop) there was three week period of rigorous outlining and planning which hurt, because I wasn't sure exactly how I wanted the plot to go. By the time I was finished outlining, I had every single chapter outlined exactly. This time I'm doing this differently, much more freeform, much less plot oriented, in a real kind of narrative diary style. It's first person so I can do that. It's a much groovier, easy riding novel, but it's still starting out rocky. Me amigo beatniko Andrew Robinson read over the first chapter, which is a narrative summary of the year before the events of the novel, and he dug it, so I'm leaving it for now. I'll tear it apart while editing. But I'm having trouble getting all of the characters (Oliver Godfrey, Malcolm Paxton, Gavin Campbell...and no Oscar lol) introduced and in their right places, but I want to lead very quickly and without delay into the  soul  of the book - that is, it's passionate and intense stories about irregular teenagers. Anyway, this headaching sad phase is easily weathered by spending a lot of time writing and a good amount of time meditating.   I've been rereading a book called "Unless" by Carol Shields (an old feminist book, but really quite good) and she says that there are only a select few themes for books. Love, death, loss, loneliness, war, morality, and coming-of-age. I have wondered if people have life-themes. If all of a person's individual stories were counted and written out and catalogued, what would the ever-present theme be?

      Hello. You know what? I'm not doing so great. I know this blog is mostly complaints, but that is because a lot of the time I don't post when I'm happy. For some reason I believe I can get the bad stuff out by writing it down, and that is a myth, or at least it has never worked for me. Right now I am sitting at my computer finishing the first chapter of the empty sky diaries, and I've got an awful headache. I have headaches a lot these days. And I'm terribly, unbearably lonely. For the first thing, there is no one online to talk to, and I am too shy to call Sara even though she told me too, and I haven't had a girlfriend since awkward skinny terrified grade nine and I feel like I will never be good or stable enough, because of outbursts like this. For some reason I am cold, cold from the inside. I have a sweater on and the heat is turned up. I am shaking a little bit.   #59 A lone flute in a distant canyon,  suddenly I am heart-broken.   Has my meditation come to this?   These tears?

      Ok, so last night was NOT cool. I repeat, not cool. Well, the first part was alright. Nate and I crashed Matt's house a little early for the shindig. We bought some dark rum on Friday, and used it to make rum and coke. There was some chilling out, some overt homosexuality and joking around. There was an hour long painful game of twister that I lost very quickly. I drank one rum and coke. Talked to Matt a little bit about University, and how I want to be a writer, and my plans to write a book this summer, one that I can be proud of. While talking, I poured a vodka/lemonade, a little heavy-handedly, so there was a good little pool of vodka in the bottom. I drank that while talking. I think that was what did it, the mixing of rum and vodka in my stomach. By the time twister was finished, the great big giant beer mug of vodka and lemonade was empty, and the world was becoming a little slow and swimmy. We chilled out some more, joked around. Nate and I stripped down to our boxers, and I think Deleavey was stripping, just to be stupid and gay. Matt and Lisa came downstairs to find us all decidedly unclothed, and that was a very good laugh. About this time I poured the second rum and coke, and again my heavy handed pouring made the drink a little stronger than average. I felt pretty good, I still had motor skills and mindfulness and everything (although obviously impaired), but I came to the acute realization that I was drunk. Quite drunk in fact. A little trashed. Sauced you might say. It seemed like a very funny realization at the time. We walked back to my house, cause I had to be home by curfew. We were all over the road. At some point, we were hanging around on my street, and Justin Leblanc (friend of matt's) sits down crosslegged in the middle of the road. Thinking this infinitely beat and cool, I sit down across from him and begin to meditate. Lisa comes over and does the same, until we are all meditating in a circle. It is a beautiful, awesome thing. Lisa asks if I know any chants. I tell her I do, a Buddhist chant: Om Mani Padme Hum, which is said to purify karma and cultivate compassion. I chant, and everyone follows. I begin to focus deeper as I chant until...I feel really really nauseous. That is not good. Something felt very wrong. I couldn't meditate. I was shut out of the peaceful centre I retreat to, I was exhiled from that state, I felt like a great giant brass gate had been closed. Every time I tried to go to that place I was overwhelmed with a feeling of sickness. I got up and walked home. When I went to bed, everything was spinning, and I threw up all over my shirt and bedsheets. I had to wash them this morning. My parents don't know (although they may suspect), but it doesn't matter. I'm fucking done forever, and I mean it. The Buddha was right, he always is. It ain't worth it. I don't ever want to be blocked from that meditation place again, ever.

      I haven't had internet all week, which is why I haven't updated or been online. I learned to play Revolution by the Beatles by ear, all on my own. Thanks Liz, for hooking me up with the CD. The coffeehouse was last night. I went out and played Revolution, and then my beatnik compatriot Andrew Robinson joined me for a performance of Miguel Pinero's "Lower East Side poem". We put on toques and sunglasses, and read while Owen softly tapped his Hi-hat cymbal. It was a good time. I met a girl named Kayla, who seems nice to me, but much too quiet, in a naiad kind of way. Andrew doesn't like her much, and I wonder why. In general I've been buzzing like crazy. Things have been intense. I feel so clearly the urge to "howl" as Ginsberg put it, just to to express the intensity that I am feeling, all this beat energy that runs through me. I have been very lonely lately, I don't know why. Everyone seems boring and slow and depressed. Andrew R and Nate seem to be the only ones who are able to keep up. Tonight I'm going to see Troy with a vanload full of people I don't get along with, except of course for my brothers, Nathan, Nathan, and Matt, and Dr. Pepper of course. I don't think I'll like Troy, if it's anything like the Illiad. I don't think war is -ever- cool, people dying is not cool. Countries warring over some chick, that ain't cool either. A better movie would be if the Trojans and Greeks melted down all their weaponry, and built a beautiful society together where there existed no violence, and all effort went towards living in harmony with nature. Ok, so there might not be so much action, but it would make me feel warm and fuzzy, and it would be revolutionary. If I'm not back by this time tomorrow, carry on, carry on.           Ok, it's now the morning/afternoon after. I didn't see Troy, we were late and it didn't seem so great. Matt, Dr. Pepper and I all got out tickets changed and saw Shrek 2 instead. It was a good choice. That movie is awesome, it's hilarious. I was a loose cannon the whole time, I was screaming along to Cocaine and Day Tripping, and switched cars to drive with Matt. There were a lot of people there. I can't remember exactly how many, but a lot. Nate and I bought some dark rum for sunday night, when we plan to chill with Matt again. Owen has started to make fun of me for going drinking quite often, implying I come home "sauced" every weekend. The word sauced amuses me. I don't though. I drink so responsibly it hurts, because I am a Bhikkhu. Now, the beach party, well sauced isn't going to begin to describe the state we will all be in at the beach party, but on a week to week basis, I am very mindful and grounded. Keep note of that.

       So much for not writing about Buddhism, huh? Anyway, here is a post I made on a Buddhist forum, in response to someone who didn't understand the Buddhist concept of not self, that there is no such thing as souls. Can anyone understand this? Would anyone like to argue against it? Anyway, I'll post it.    "I think translation and representation of things in English can cause a lot of wrong views. When I first began to study Buddhism, not practicing but just as a scholar, I held many wrong views. While reading about Zen, I started to believe that the world was nothing, that nothing really exists, which is a very dangerous view. I explained it to myself quite clearly (reality is perception, everyone percieves things differently, and and so there is no universally real thing), which worked fine as long as no one asked any piercing questions. I shed this wrong view later on, however, as I began to practice and cultivate an understanding of emptiness. I am still shaky however, on shunyata, and the differences between ultimate and relative truth, but I trust that understanding will come in time, as I read, listen, and meditate.  But I got sidetracked. Not-self nature is often misinterpreted. People think that means that "they" don't exist, i.e. there is no leg, there is no arm, there is no mind, there is no consciousness. You can't think in those terms. "You", as a collection of senses, physical attributes, consciousness, volition, etc. do exist. If you consider a person the sum of their parts, and recognize that nothing is reborn except their Karma (which is just what they do), that is a right view.  What doesn't exist, is a centre of your being. There is no ethereal being, pulling your body along on strings like a puppet and making it walk and talk. When you say " I would like an ice cream cone", who are you referring to? There is no being, no puppetmaster, who desires an ice cream cone. There is just your mind, sending a signal to your body that you are hungry, and the remembrance of the good taste of ice cream, and dukkha arises, the attempt to alleviate suffering by consuming ice cream! As "you" eat this ice cream, who is eating ice cream? No one. But ice cream is being eaten. It gets trickier without concrete things. When a thought arises in your mind, who is thinking it? No one is thinking it, the thought arises because of conditions in your mind, it is a phenomenon itself, it is not the result of a puppetmaster's actions. I imagine thoughts as little clouds in the recesses of my mind, which crowd together and dissipate entirely on their own. If you meditate, you can experience clearly how thoughts arise, and how frail they are, how quickly they fall apart.   Likewise, inanimate objects have not self nature. A tree is composed of different parts. It is dependantly originated, it could not have come into being without water, sunlight, etc. Since it is dependantly originated, it is impermanent. It will eventually fall down, and rot. There is no spiritual center, or ghostly presence that is the soul of the tree. There is no part of the tree that you can take, and say " This is the perfect essence of tree." if you cut out a sliver of bark, it is not the tree. If you cut out a block of wood, it is not the tree. If you take a leaf, it is not the tree. There is no attribute, called "tree-ness" One thing cannot be more "tree" than another. As hard as you look, you will find no self in that tree, all you will find is intertwining dependantly originated phenomena. If you cut off a branch, what will you have? If the tree had a self, one of those material things would have to contain it, be attached to the self. The self would have to reside in one part or the other. It doesn't. There is simply a branch, and a tree missing a branch. If human beings have selves, when does the self enter into the body? It is a part of its mother's body for some time, before being born. The self would have to arise independantly, to magically appear in the fetus at one point or another. Can you isolate the point that this self manifests in the child? No. There is no such point. There is a mother, and a child develops in her as the result of copulation, dependant origination. The child is born, and is composed of the same aggregates as its mother. All of this is dependant. All of this is not-self. The only thing that is not dependant is Nibbana, the unborn, the unconditioned. Besides that, all things are dependant, and you will find no self in dependant phenomena. Thus, all things have not self nature, including people.  Keep sitting, keep thinking! Don't give up on anatta, or make up your own beliefs on the subject. It is something that is true, and you can experience it for yourself. The only trouble is that it is an experiental thing, and really tough to explain. I doubt that all of the above rambling has helped you to realize anything, but I am confident that in time it will all click for you, and suddenly it will seem quite obvious. Good luck, my best wishes go with you!"

      Had a good night last night at Chanel's birthday party. When I first met her I called her a naiad, because she was so strange and silent, but she talked quite freely last night. I guess I met her for the first time, really anyway. Last time she didn't say more than three words. I also met a nice but angry girl named Nicole, who was a little...friendly, after a couple of drinks. I was in a bad mindstate when I left to go to the party, but the assuring atmosphere of friends calmed me. I was still quite out of it though, and the vodka/lemonade didn't help very much. I didn't drink enough to lose mindfulness though, I followed Dharma. It was actually quite a good time, and many parts of it I am trying to remember for my book, because in a way it was all very emotional and surreal. Sitting out on the deck, I hugged Nicole because in an odd and funny drunken way we had told each other we thought we were cute (does that sentence make sense?), and although we were both drunk, it was a strange sincere time. Matt Phillips taught me to play the Pink Panther theme on Piano, and I improvised for about ten minutes, just playing chords and getting really into it and digging the music. Chanel made me stop, because she said it was annoying and there was rap music playing in the background.  In a funny outpouring of truth I expounded to Matt Dryden my Bad Shit Sutra, that all people are essentially perfect if you take away all of the bad shit they carry around with them. And on the deck, as I took the last drags of Deleavey's cigarette, I explained what it means to be a Bhikkhu, and recited random poetry I remembered. And then Dr. Pepper got very angry and sad, and was crying and flailing because she thought Matt P. had cheated on her with Nicole. Nicole, as I said before, was a little more than friendly, but Matt hadn't done anything. Nicole got mad because Dr. Pepper pushed her. The two were about to throw down, when everyone else seperated them. The whole ordeal fucked with my head a little bit. I can't understand the urge to hurt someone. The alcohol was probably partly responsible for it all. Neither one was thinking clearly. Lisa (Dr. Pepper) was paranoid and jealous, and Nicole was as mad and violent as a bull on speed. It was a night to remember, just because it was intense.

      I will write a sutra when I am ready. Someday I will expound the Dharma as I have experienced, after I have achieved single pointed concentration, passed into the fourth Jhana, cultivated the highest wisdoms of anatta and shunyata, when I live the true Bhikkhu life, after I see with true eyes. I feel so terribly ignorant at the moment, shameful of my delusions, my lack of mindfulness, all the reasons I am not a good Bhikkhu. And I am lonely, because it is a Friday night and my book is no good and there will be a few more empty hours until I go to sleep, and more empty hours when I wake up tomorrow. I have a headache, and my feet are cold. I can draw no more poems from my head. My thoughts falter and sink. Just got a call from Matt Phillips. Going to Chanel's birthday party. Be back at midnight. I need tylenol. I love you. Goodnight.

      I have just finished reading Macbeth, by Will Shakespeare. Now, I have always had in me the little nagging voice saying that Shakespeare is ornate and outdated, and his plays are dialogue heavy dinosaurs which don't stand up to more modern works. Again, I am shown my own foolishness and stupidity (you'd think I'd be used to it by now). Shakespeare's stories (even if most were not his own) are some of the best I've ever heard. When you look through Macbeth, there is such a passion and intensity to it that I am amazed. After centuries, it still fascinates. When you imagine the scenes, Banquo's ghost, Lady Macbeth sleepwalking, the witches gathering, all of it works so well. Plus it is thematically about Karma, although to the Christian Willy Shakespeare we would say this as "what goes around comes around" just so there is no confusion. Now I want to see it acted, or at least the Roman Polanski film we're supposed to watch in English class, but the sheer fact that it can be read and enjoyed as a script alone is testament to it's genius.   I figured I'd start with a positive note, before revealing that my story "The Benzedrine Angel Discourses" (which I am actually quite proud of), has been rejected by Night Train Magazine. The cause? They thought the story moved too far from it's starting point, and went too much into the past instead of focusing on the central conflict. Basically they thought it was too scattered, and diverged too much from where it was "supposed" to be going. I  really  don't have any hard feelings though, because this time they sent me a very considerate letter, in which they were very encouraging, as opposed to the impersonal computer generated response I got last time, so I am seeing some improvement. The show must go on! some brief editing will take place, I'll try to sort it out a little bit, maybe inject a paragraph or two to refocus the story a little bit, and then send it off somewhere else. Also, I am brooding on where to submit Sonya. So the short story front is in heavy combat, but there is much hope yet. The novel front is very discouraging. after reading over the first three chapters, I am quite sure I will not submit it anywhere for publication, because even if a publisher were to accept it, I would be embarassed to see it published. I try to go easy on myself, but really, it's absolutely awful in places. Anyway, I am going to edit it as best I can and let some friends read it, and probably that will be the end of it. I hope I will do a better job on the next one, which I am thinking about and roughly planning right now. I hope to write the whole novel over the summer, averaging about four hours a day writing. I think I have a better idea now of what works and what doesn't, and my style has certainly improved over the course of writing that damned book (as I affectionately call it). Next time, I will really be ready.  If you haven't looked through the post about Cold Mountain Poems, check it out below. Shakespeare was good, but he's got tough competition from Han Shan.

       I thought I would share a poem by Han Shan, who was the original Dharma Bum, being a somewhat funny and drunken taoist/Buddhist ascetic in exhile, banished to the cold mountains of China. He lived in the eighth century, and is (in my opinion) a great example of a Bhikkhu, someone who is searching for spiritual truth. Here are some of my favorite Cold Mountain poems, just pour vous.  #257 A winter moon tonight shivering cold,  yearning -- one with  yearning's end.  Questions and answers forsaken,   no fire to make tea, all that's left -  Cold Mountain,  and me, until only  Cold  Mountain.    #12 Cold Mountain – teach me the art of motionless flight. You glide majestically through silent starfields, and yet all stars appear within your own infinite body.  When you murmur in such tender whispers, humming softly, nameless stars will gather beside me tonight.  There's no climbing down from this ledge now. There's no poetry I can answer with, except to be the poem opened by the same hands you uphold the stars with.   #59 A lone flute in a distant canyon,   suddenly I am heart-broken.   Has my meditation come to this?   These tears?   #64 Tying a sturdy rope around the waist,   the single robe I wear is worn for everyone.   Taking nourishment when the body sounds the bell   and the generosity of the land is extended,   I eat my food for everyone.    Keeping alert to the mind,   what watches sees enough for anyone   to recognize what they are.     It’s known all share Buddha Nature,   but no one knows where   Buddha goes when Buddha goes   to Cold Mountain.

      I've decided that my property must be justly divided amongst my closest friends, in the event of my untimely death. Here is how I want things divided. Henceforth, I will refer to Andrew Robinson, Owen Burns, Nick Stovall, and Nathan Boudreau as "the group". I, Justin White, do as my last will and testament decree, that my estate should be distributed as follows.  I give the Mazda Miata which belongs to my father, and the Mazda Miata which belongs to my grandfather, assuming that they are my inheritence, to Nathan Boudreau, who will undoubtedly be able to cause more damage with them than anyone else. Also, he introduced to me to the phrase "pop the clutch" and "driving machine", and so I am indebted to him for that. Ride on Nate.  I give my library (all print publications) to Andrew Robinson and Elisabeth Plante, may they spent many days arguing over those books. To the aforementioned two I leave my music collection, with the exception of all CD's containing music by Bob Marley, which Lis is unworthy to possess. I leave all Marley CD's to Andrew Robinson exclusively, who I believe is better suited to Natty dread it up.  I give my guitars to Peter Sawatzky, who will probably scoff at their inadequacy, but at the very least they will be close to a rickenbacker, which is as much as I could hope for them. Rock and Roll, Pete.  I request that the remainder of my posessions be sold, or if unmarketable, claimed by a responsible person who is mentioned in this will. The remainder of my possessions includes furniture, clothes, my seiza bench (for meditation), and any other item that is not otherwise mentioned. This money is to be divided equally among "the group", but I request that the executor of my estate call each of the recipients every day (preferably early in the morning) to remind them that "Justin would have wanted you to give the money to charity."  If I have a girlfriend or wife at the time of my death, she is to be shared amongst "the group", each person having an equal claim to her. (joke...or is it?)  If I have a child, he/she is to be raised by the group, as well as his/her mother, and is to be taught all of the world's religions (with an emphasis on Buddhism ;)), and shielded from the corrupting influences of capitalism. I suggest forming a commune for this purpose.  I request that my body be cremated as cheaply as possible, and the money that would have been spent on a funeral, be spent partying and meditating.  I request that I be remembered as a Bhikkhu and a writer, and a compassionate man. Anyway, just remember that death ain't no thing, alright? Chances are I won't even remember it later on.

            Seeing as I have discontinued my other poetry site, after making the leap from xanga to blogger, I will post a poem that was written in my fifth period class (Math) over a period of about 2 days. It is dedicated to my good friend, the goodhearted foulmouthed street tough and Protestant Bhikkhu Andrew Robinson. It is about what will happen when capitalism collapses and we are old men.    In St. Petersburg  I.  I will see you in St. Petersburg where we are skeletons starved depraved ancient wise lunatics, thumbing pages and hailing Russian taxi cabs to take us Underground beneath skyscrapers We will meet, when America falls, if we see it in the news Muslim angels hovering angrily with righteous retribution for the defamations, dishonours, shames and violent rapes occuring off camera in the alien desert camoflauge Holy land, stained with Us and Them When almost everything western crumbles under its own bulge consumptive weight I will see you when we are great crazy writers in exhile and I meditate in lonely groves, and you connect in tall churches and our spiritual brotherhood has not died, despite the many years we travelled, divorced/married deep eyed girls, and looked straight upward at the giant and limitless expanses within our own inconcievable mind  When we have written and read and cried and passed out in all of the world's capitals, we will meet as hollow eyed saints frail boned indian ascetics, half blind and-all seeing when we have given our bodies to the poorest and hungriest of third-world other-culture stick-legged children, we will meet when television replaces thought, when everyone speaks with nothing to say when the streets are empty of hunger artists, buskers, homeless wanderers who have all been gathered together and pacified in needle sedative ceremony we will be heavy worded prophets, retaking and restoring the Underground building new sanctuaries on every street corner, wrapping the cold in furs when peace has died and been reborn a hundred times we will meet in St. Petersburg, to talk in chilly early morning downtown splendour, and raise our glasses to nothing in particular and wonder as old men where Gogol and Dostoyevsky stood on the cold streets in abandoned districts   II.  Lo, I have walked these cold archaic streets before Over bridges and cobblestones, under tsars and bolsheviks know that I am haunted! that my bones are haunted that my eyes and hands are haunted, my words are haunted that walking St. Petersburg streets, I meet ghosts at streetlamps, on corners, in momentary oblivion I have been here before! in countless past lives I have staggered and fallen and risen again from these ever-patient roads in an ever-growing city Know that I radiate ancient magiks since before beginningless time Know that I am visited by spirit guides and hallucinations of  people who are dead, and people who are not born, and people who never will be born or die Only in St. Petersburg do these elements combine, so that I  am visited, and know the visitors Lo, I walk as a spirit through haunted St. Petersburg  and as a spirit, St. Petersburg walks through me.

      You know what, I feel so  good ! Really, quite exceptionally good, and I'm not sure why. It is an overcast day and everything is gray, and my head hurts and I'm sick and there's no hot water for me to have a shower, but there is a sense of contentment in me.          There are moments that come around everyone once in a while, where everything seems to clear up and become beautifully clear and obvious. Don't we want clear rivers and see through skies and healthy mountains and valleys and oceans? Isn't all of that more important than money or jobs? We live in Canada! Here there is enough food and water and wood and stone for everyone to live comfortably, why must we sacrifice all of what we have in order to live in excess? Don't people see that we are just hurting ourselves, every time we build a new skyscraper or clearcut a forest? It's like we're cutting of our limbs for a couple of quarters. It is so sad to realize that paradise is so perfectly possible, if only we slow down and take things one step at a time, and get our priorities straight. I wonder what it might take to get a group of people to pool all of our money together and build a commune somewhere, where we can live close to nature educate our children in the way the world should work, and teach them to respect spirituality and the land and their minds and their bodies, and protect and shelter them from the putrid stew of commercialism and capitalism which threatens to engulf us all and transform us all into greed consuming machines. In the face of increasing technology and capitalistic constraints and poisons, I propose a widespread return to the mountains and beaches, where we can try to live harmoniously. Now I know I am an idealist, but if you close your eyes you can see it so clearly it hurts. What if we just stopped wanting, and grasping, and hating and distrusting, and just changed our priorities around a little bit, everything could still right itself, and return to health. At the very least people must understand that if we continue to progress as we are going now, things are going to collapse. Capitalism works wonders economically, but poisons people's minds, and the earth they live on. Maybe we've reached the point where we can choose not to "progress" any further, and just do what's necessary to bring things into balance.       Today I am going to edit a couple of short stories (Sonya, The Insomniac, the Benzedrine Angel Discourses) and see if I can email them to a couple of places to be considered for publication. It would be really cool to publish something, and I've got a lot of material just lying around, stuff that nobody has really looked at. I need to wait for a new ink catridge before I can continue to print off and edit my book. Then I need to start sketching out an outline for my new book, Empty Sky Diaries, which I am itching to write. In general, I have been distracted lately with Politics, School, and all kinds of secondary things like that. I want to refocus my mind on writing (and Dharma as well) and get back to what is important to me.

       I am not going to try to tell you all of the good stories I have accumulated after a weekend in Fredericton. Thursday and Friday can be found at Pete's blog, which is available on the sidebar. I'll pick it up from there. I arrived at the Lord Beaverbrook Hotel Friday night at around six, and met my roomate, the inimitable and highly intelligent David Michaud, and then went on to see the Legislative Assembly building which is across the street. The building is really something, marble and gold and carved wood everywhere you look. The moment your feet touch the steps you feel very formal, and I don't think I swore even once while inside the building. Wait, yes I did, but that's a different story. They fed us pizza and talked to us about the role of MLAs (members of legislative assembly) in government. Allison McKay, the other representative from my school, and a host of other hip cats went out to walk around Fredericton, and ended up going nowhere. It was a good time though. Allison and I had rooms next to each other, and opened up the doors so they connected, and I met her roomate Holly, and she met David, and while everyone was chilling and getting ready to leave I wrote poems on Hotel stationary about people I met, and other things.    Hotel walls beige and formal lighting Everywhere manicured and hardly noticeable clean A couple of crayons, would make a colorful mural    In total I met the delightfully self absorbed fascist James, the perfectly bilingual and very progressive Misha, the very French Patrice, Lisa Brown(lebrun) who has a habit of disappearing and reappearing, Guy who goes to Mathieu-Martin, girl-on-mescalin-who's-name-I-forget, Allison's friend Marion, funny Premier Holly, who is the only person I've ever met(other than myself) who has read Anna Karenina and who managed to keep me from spying on caucus meetings, the Minister of Education(not really, in the Seminar) who's name escapes me, and to whom I confided my leftist political opinions, " Let's just say I was rooting for Cuba..." and who laughed and did not hold communism against me. A girl I talked to for about 20 seconds about the Blues, but didn't catch her name. In general I was awful with names, and can only remember people for what they did, or their role in the Assembly. Saturday night we went to the Kingswood centre, where I met up with my amigo Jan, and his bright and effervescent friend from Bathurst (Sara?) and we talked briefly about psychology, and the way Manic-depressive disorder is treated, and whether psychological problems should be overcome through therapy or treated with medication. She told me that in Bathurst everyone does acid, and I was surprised. She wants to try to hypnotise people and induce an Acid trip without the dangers or drawbacks. I think it is a good idea to try, but drugs are a waste of time, drawbacks or not. " It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place." quoth the chili peppers. Real life is so visceral and intense and dramatic and beautiful if you appreciate it on it's own terms, and see it for what it really is, that anything else just comes up short. Allison and company, les amis francophones, went gambling and won a ridiculous amount of tickets playing a truck game. We took the bus back, and I went swimming which felt good although I couldn't see without my glasses, and Allison and Misha got splashed and were quite irked. We all gathered afterwards in Lisa's room, and played card games and watched educational late night sex stuff, which was creepy at times, because it was like an instructional video for sado masochism. I went to bed at 1:30, and woke up at 6. I showered and ate breakfast and went into the Assembly building to start. I forget to mention that all day saturday we prepared for the mock Assembly, and Misha and I, along with several other people who helped with suggestions and anecdotes, wrote a motion to present to the Assembly, for a standardized curriculum for French and English schools. We went through Member statements, and then question period (which was pretty cool, and very fun to watch) and then into Motions. I read the motion in French and English, and then presented my speech. I did the closing remarks, and was pleased to find that it passed with only three opposed to it, one of which was my fascist amigo. We debated legislation, and passed some bills, amended some bills, and it was all very good. It was a blast. Then we drove home and I wandered around the house in a daze for some time, playing guitar a lot because I had been deprived all weekend. Now I am home and working on homework and resting and not going to school because life is too beautiful to waste on Chemistry.

      Went to the cottage today, where things were overcast and cold and not so appealing, but I am still very convinced that it is the best place for me. It is a very good place to stay, it is old and has good beds to sleep in, and a fireplace and kitchen, and so there is no reason to complain. Today we went grocery shopping and I managed to buy things that are important, and not papaya, mango, or bok choy. We cleaned out the cottage, wiped off the layers of dust that have accumulated over the winter. I bought some books for the time I'm there, in addition to The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce. Both of those are pretty heavy, and I've been reading heavy for a long time now. I got Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, a book of short ghost stories by Poe and other good people, A Sicilian detective story called the Shape of Water, and an odd Japanese fantasy story called Across the Nightingale Floor by Lian Hearn. So I should be alright for two weeks. I am looking forward to Siddhartha, it's a fictional account of the Buddha's life and the religious scholar in me really digs that kind of stuff. That back cover says it is a story that will linger in my mind and spirit for a lifetime. That's a lot to live up to. Speaking of that, I want a print copy of the Dhammapada. The online one isn't cutting it anymore. While we're talking about books, I've got a lot of short story ideas. The one I dreamt will be called "68 senses" I think. I don't know why, it just came to me. I've forgotten most of the dream though. I've got more ideas too, and I think I will try to spend an hour or two every day writing, just to keep mentally fit for when I come home. Ok, that is the very end of the book talk.  Ok the violin part at the end of the Baba O'Riley is making me very -very- happy. What am I on? I can't recall. I am trying to get a phone hooked up at the cottage, there isn't one there right now. I might have to use a cellphone. Cellphones need to be charged. I -hate- things that need to be charged, and I especially hate when they beep and shut off. My parents have partially surrendered, and I am allowed to have people over at the cottage, although I am without a license so getting there is a concern in and of itself. Plus it's a big empty cottage with just my sister and I. Oh, and the dog too. My Mom even made the following comment " This front porch isn't as sturdy as it used to be. You can come out and sit but don't have ten or twelve people dancing here, because it would be dangerous" and when I told her I wouldn't have ten or twelve people over she said "You're only human." Which is true. So if anyone plans on going beaching anytime soon, look me up at least. No partying, but the cottage is made for chilling out. The number for the cottage is 532-3378, and the cellphone is 871-9519, So you will be able to reach me at one number or another. I'll be going out tomorrow night, and by saturday morning everything should be settled.  [Edit] Ok, so I'm just about gone, finally. Remember that I love you, and I want you all to be ecstatically happy while I'm gone. I will return shortly with short stories, pomes, and maybe a song or two, and hopefully a clear and healthy head. If you go beaching, look me up. Be excellent to each other.

      So this might be my last post for a little while. Finally I am leaving to go to the cottage, which is by the ocean and although it is gloomy now and I hoping for sun. Last night I remembered a dream (well, woke up in the middle of one more accurately) and it was a strangely compelling and real one. I think I am going to rearrange it into a story. I will have to write with pen and paper, something I haven't done in a long time, but it will probably be good for me.   See, for a lot of people the beach is just a place where you go every once in a while during the summer, crowded and full of people, and you stay for a couple of hours until you get uncomfortable or sunburnt, and then you go home. For me it's not. I am never healthier or more myself than when I'm at the beach (at least in the past anyway) It's a big part of my identity. It's not something I can explain. It's about being close to something so huge, and waking up every morning and being able to see the tides from your front porch, and never wearing shoes, and there's something about it all that is just -me-. The downside is, it requires me to give up blogging, msn, most of my music (which is in mp3s) and writing my book. I have a feeling though, in the long run giving up these things will be unspeakably beneficial.   Anyway, I'll post more later. If I can I'll post the number where I can be reached, in case anyone has a justin emergency. In other news - watched the Secret Window with Liz, and decided I don't want to end up like that, although I can see it happening. Wasn't such an awesome movie, I enjoyed the random conversations more than the actual plot, which was kind of trite. I'll post more later, I can't even concentrate. Today I go out to clean things up, stock the cupboards, that kind of thing, and tomorrow I go out to stay.

      1. Take your mind off things. Take part in different activities and give yourself as little time as possible to dwell on things. Never spend too much time at one thing, for risk of becoming obsessive.  2. Get excercise, sleep a lot, eat regularly. Not doing any one of these will give your system a chemical imbalance that will affect your head, 90% of the time negatively. Force yourself to do all three, even though sometimes you won't want to.  3. Remind yourself when you wake up every morning that you are entirely in control of how your day goes, and moods are all in your head, and you have control over them instead of the other way around.   4. Ignore things like headaches and muscle sores. Take some tylenol and don't dwell on the fact that you need medication for the pain, or that no one else you know goes through this.  5. When you do get into a black mood, try to do simple things that make you feel good and take your mind off it. Get a cup of tea, go for a walk, read a book, something to divert your attention. Don't think about it.  6. Don't read too much, even happy/good/healthy things. Even books on religion or whimsical stories can become nihilistic and depressing in the right frame of mind.  7. What you do read should be simple, and digestible in easy, 30 minute reading periods. Poetry and simple novels are best. Make sure ahead of time that there is a happy ending.  8. Don't try to explain how you're feeling to anyone, or justify it. They won't understand (people don't remember depression very well) and there is no single reason that you are depressed.  It's impossible to explain to people, and there's no real reason for it.  9. Don't get discouraged when friends and loved ones don't understand, or think you are just being grumpy and pessimistic. Smile and tell them you'll try not to be. Remember not to justify or explain.  10. Put on a good face for friends and loved ones. They don't understand what you're feeling, and so it is easier on them and on you if you smile and make an effort to be optimistic in their presence.  11. Talk simply and be mindful of what you're saying. Don't be discouraged if conversation is hard sometimes, and what comes out of your mouth is dull and fractured. Take advantage of the opportunity to be a good listener.  12. When you are lonely, remember all of the good people around you who care about you.  never, ever,  question why they care about you, or why you are worth caring about: just know that you are. If one of them is short with you, or says something mean, or just seems preoccupied, remember it's because they've got problems of their own, and it's not because they don't care about you.  13. At the worst times, remember that you will get better, and there will be good times ahead. Tell yourself this over and over again. Remember the times that you were happiest, and that you were not always like this.  14. Don't think about death, isolation, or the aesthetic grossness of everything. Focus on good things, or don't think anything at all. Most of the time the latter is easier and more effective.

      Things are going well. I wrote 1500 words today so far, but I'm proud of them and they are very good words, and so I'm not disappointed that there are so few of them. Liz came over last night and chased the monsters out of the closets, which is something she is good at, and so I think I can stay happy until I go to the beach. Here are two sentences from the book I really like (fuck the nonsense about it being bad luck, if it is bad luck to talk about writing I'm fucked already)  I told him [Gavin] offhandedly that I thought I had figured out why Hemingway drank so much. He told me that was Hemingway’s secret, and if I had found out for sure that I ought not to tell anyone.   I will write a super brief introduction to Buddhism below.   The Four Noble Truths  (the Buddha's first speech)  1. All Life is Suffering. - If you are born, you will suffer, and you cannot alleviate suffering through worldly means, by buying things or taking vacations etc.  2. Suffering is caused by Craving - A famous teacher once said that suffering is a rope burn. We suffer because we cling to things that by their very nature are impermanent and always changing - youth for example. The biggest cause of suffering is clinging to things.  3. There is an end to suffering (Nirvana) - There is a state where all clinging stops, and all the afflictive emotions (anger, hatred, greed etc.) vanish, and all there is is pure radiant calmness and joy. Nirvana means to "put out the fire" of hatred, greed, and ignorance. If you take all of that bad stuff away, what's left is your true nature, which is Nirvana. The Buddha was not a god, he simply attained Nirvana and ended his suffering, and then taught about it. Arahants are beings who have ended their suffering but who are not quite perfect Buddhas. There have been many Arahants in the last century, including Ajaan Mun, Ajaan Chah, and Ajaan Maha Boowa in Thailand. Once you attain Nirvana, you are never reborn again, instead you pass into Parinirvana which is a deathless state independant of body or senses.   4. There is a way to end suffering (the Noble Eightfold path) - Nirvana doesn't just happen. Technically you always have it, but you need to work to realize it. The way to realize Nirvana and end suffering is called the eightfold path, eight things you have to do. This is why Buddhism is different from other religions. The focus is not on what you -believe-, it's on what you -do-. Buddhism is a practice, it is constantly working through meditation and discipline to get closer to Nirvana. The eight conditions are the following:  Right View Right Intention Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Concentration Right Mindfulness  http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/eightfoldpath.html    The 3 Marks of Existence  (basic Buddhist philosophy) 1. Impermanence. Everything is impermanent. Everything comes into being, changes, and dies. Everything except Nirvana is impermanent. 2. Ultimately Unsatisfying. No Joy you can find will last forever, or is perfect Joy, except for Nirvana. Every sense pleasure you get is ultimately unsatisfying. 3. Not-Self. Everything in existence is without a soul or self.

        Okay, so I have come to the realization that I am neither healthy nor happy here in this house. I can't write much after burning out (although I'm rehabilitating), and there is nothing to do and not much to read, and my heart is at the beach. I feel homesick for it. Of course, I have griped about this far too much to my friends and so I am as much a burden to them as myself, and so the solution for now is to shut up and get over it. More meditation, a harder try at writing, that sort of thing. All I have to do is get through one more week until I go to the cottage, although I may have to break some rules to have friends hang out with me there (My parents are not fond of us having friends over in an empty unsupervised cottage that doesn't belong to us, go figure) but I will not hesitate to directly disobey them in the interests of having company to go beaching with. Liz is coming over tonight, which makes me simultaneously happy and worried. My parents are nosy people, and I will have to lay down some ground rules for them to follow.   I want one of those little things that all the greatestjournal people seem to have, you know, the little icons that say what mood you're in and what you're listening to, and give you a funny little icon to show it. I think that would be good. An old xanga amigo of mine Dayadhvam had Calvin and Hobbes ones, they were awesome. Anyone who knows how leave me a comment or something. For the record, right now I am feeling contemplative, and I am listening to the sweetest thing by U2. Actually, to tell you the truth I am disappointed in you. You never leave me comments anymore. Why? Was it something I said? Next entry I might try to sum up to basics of Buddhism (the 4 noble truths, the eightfold path, and the 3 marks of existence, and maybe the triple gem - there are a lot of lists and numbers in Buddhism) because so far I have had trouble explaining the 'basic' beliefs of Buddhism, and it would be good for people to have at least an inkling of what I'm so involved in.

      It is early morning, outside things are dark and this house is cold and I sleptwalked through it. I am listening to Desert Rose and I am convinced that Sting must have been there and experienced something. I remember why I love words. How many millions of images and terrifying intense emotions surface with just the words "I dreamt of rain."  I don't dream about anything, at least not while I'm asleep, you could count some waking experiences I've had as dreams. Sometimes there are things which are not real very close to me, but that is not strange. I find it funny how we have only one word for 'sad'. There is no word for being overwhelmed and anxious and shivering, and unhappy because you're alone and your mind is racing. And there is no word for profound sadness, looking at the world and realizing how helpless we are, like a baby sea turtle struggling against massive waves.   There is something I'm absolutely sure of right now. Communication is necessary. If we are always pretending we are okay, how will we ever be happy? How could lying to ourselves create any kind of happiness? I am sorry for all of the times I made fun of emo kids, If I could I would apologize. Suffering is not a fucking joke, and it doesn't matter where it comes from, it deserves compassion. They are to be admired, just for communicating. HOWL, when you are sad. Scream, just because you can. Call someone on the phone, whoever will listen, and pour out everything until you feel like you will collapse. We are humans, we have this gift and we waste it by living and dying and never saying anything worthwhile. Nobody is screaming, which is why people feel so lonely when they want to, they think they are the only ones who have something to scream. There is no shame in howling.  I am lonely now, and cold. My parents are suddenly changing their minds about things. Now they don't want me to get a job. They are going to Hawai'i alone, and they want me to stay at the cottage with my sister and for part of the time, my grandparents. I am sad that I am not going, because Hawaii is a spiritual place for me, the island of Maui in particular. It is true all kinds of rich people, but like true bourgeoisie they lock themselves up in resorts and popular beaches, and leave all of the sprawling sand and coral and big empty skies and palm tree jungles for me and the locals. There is a field there of lava, where everything is black, and fields of sugarcane that smell so good. Pictures of it come back to me like it was yesterday. Hawaii is close to the earth, and to the ocean, and I remember true spiritual happiness driving through sugarcane fields. I am not going this time but I would not be even slightly bothered if I could find a way for Liz and some amigos to join me at the beach. There is no computer there, so it would mean no more writing my book, and no more msn or blog, but I could deal with that. I am beginning to think a break to write poetry would be healthy, maybe I could fill a whole little notebook with poems. But my parents change their minds about a lot of things, so nothing is certain.  I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in vain

      Well, after three days of managing 4000 words every day, I've hit the wall and today I produced next to nothing, 500 measly words. That was partially because I was crippled with a headache all afternoon, but I try not to make excuses for myself. Today I got my report card, I'll list out the marks for you. I'm not ecstatic, but I'm not bothered by it either. It's pretty proportional to the amount of work I've done, except for chemistry, for which no amount of work could save me.    Biology 111         93 Chemistry 121       75 Theatre Arts 120    80 English 111         89 Math 112B           86

      Went with Liz last night to go see 'Supersize me', the documentary where a guy eats McDonalds for 30 days (shudder). We went with Deleavey, who saw Chronicles of Riddick instead. All I can say is that I have not been on a date in a -long- time so I was nervous and twitchy, and Liz has everything together 100% of the time.   The Documentary was honestly hard to watch, for me at least. I think my face was frozen in perpetual disgust at watching him eat it all, despite what his doctors told him. Liz just sort of laughed with the gleeful knowledge that she had been right all along, but I was freaked out. They compared his diet to  alcoholism , meaning that in thirty days he hurt his liver the same way an incredibly compulsive alcoholic would. McDonalds food is roughly as healthy as hard liquor. That wasn't the scary part though, the scary part was watching him. He got depressed, lethargic, he gained seventeen pounds, going up stairs got to be a problem, he was just this gross shell of a person. There was a rather funny/creepy scene where his vegan girlfriend describes how he can't get it up in bed. His doctors told him if he continued the diet it would kill him. They all advised him unequivocally to stop filming the documentary and get off the diet. He got addicted to the food too, he found himself getting depressed and having headaches if he didn't eat constantly. They talked about what goes into McDonalds food, and would you guess what's in it? OPIATES. Do you know what an opiate is? Heroin, Morphine, and Opium are opiates. They are chemicals which lock into your natural pleasure receptors in your brain and simulate endorphin responses, which leads to a natural crash and withdrawl, and leads your body to stop producing endorphins (happy chemicals) naturally. It's not good, at all. An adult might be able to handle a little dosage of opiates and have the body manage it, but think about what it's doing to the six year olds who eat there regularly. It's literally a drug, and it's literally an addiction. The same goes for coke, (*cough*laura*cough*) there are chemicals which actually ellicit a pleasure response and create a chemical addiction, in addition to the sugar which is addictive on its own. I guess it comes down to wanting control over what goes into my body. I don't want to be pumped full of the stuff that McDonalds has in their food, I don't want it in me, because it's not only unhealthy, but it leads to unhappiness.  Incidentally, I found this verse in the Dhammapada which is a little arrogant, but that I like quite a bit, and may use as a sort of introduction to the book, because it fits quite well with the theme.    382:  A young monk who strives in the Awakened One's teaching,     brightens the world like the moon set free from a cloud.

      Well, I was really bummed yesterday because my drivers test has been rescheduled to July 14th so I am stranded here, but I was told not to be so pessimistic, so I am embracing that. I am still alive, and that is good enough. I watched the leadership debate last night, so I'll give my coverage of it. It was an exciting debate, and a heated one, and every leader made good points (read: Every leader made a total ass of himself).  Paul Martin: Pauly started off relatively strong. He still seems to think that he's got the election in the bag, despite the fact that every Canadian and their pets hate him. His opening statement was very direct. He said he's building the Liberal platform on two issues: better healthcare, and pie. Cause everyone likes healthcare, and everyone likes pie. He then explained that the sponsorship scandal wasn't really his fault. His puerto rican lover took off with the money, and there was nothing he could do about it. Then he promised every little girl in Canada a pony.  Of course, in the actual debate, Pauly gave us a math lesson. He exclaims that the conservatives will put the country into 50 billion dollars of debt based on their promises. Harper had to shut him up by mentioning that Pauly flunked Math (having around 2 billion dollars float away without knowing about it qualifies as flunking). Pauly didn't listen though.  But really, I admire Pauly for doing what Pauly does best. He dodged all of these issues, gave very few definitive answers (except about health care and pie) and generally sat there like a very charismatic lump of coal. He didn't really have much of a place in the debate anyway. It became clear very early on that it didn't matter what he said, because no one trusts him. So basically the three other parties shouted at him until he looked like he wanted to explode.  Stephen Harper: Now Harper really -looks- like a good guy. He makes sense. He rallies the troops about Liberal waste and makes a good show of it. He's by far the best debater on stage. He makes good points, doesn't shout, and is very clear. There was a little meter on the channel I watched that showed audience approval. Whenever Harper so much as smiled the green meter went nuts, people love the guy. But if you can see beyond the charisma he's scary. First of all, he agreed with Iraq. He wants to increase Military funding. He doesn't agree with gay marriage. He wants abortion to become illegal. He wants the firstborn children of every Canadian family sacrificed to his glory.   Jack Layton: I really tried to like the guy. It was obvious from the beginning though that he had scripted everything. He had a pole up his ass the whole time. His routine was " Oh, I'm smiling and nodding and making hand gestures so obviously I, the leader of the NDP, and you the lowly viewer of this broadcast, are chummy and on friendly terms. Since you're my new best friend, howzabouts you vote for me?" Well nobody fell for it. All his issues were good, and he managed to conceal the fact that he's a big ol' communist, but otherwise his debating skills are awful, and people hate him.  Jack basically has a very signature debating style. Paul Martin says something and he screams unintelligeble nonsense until the moderator steps in. Jack gets really worked up. At one point Harper was talking about abortion and Jack Layton pulled out his nine and started shouting " I'ma bust a cap in yo ass foo! Bourgeois wanna fuck wit ma boyz? NDP represent!" and Harper shut up. Fast. At another point he accused Paul Martin of hiding behind the constitution. I'm not sure how you "hide behind" human rights, and neither was Pauly. When Pauly voiced this idea, that he supported the charter, Jack Layton ankle tackled him, and Pauly promptly had a heart attack and died because he's 112 years old. Jack tore out the heart and swallowed it in one grisly gesture before returning to the podium.  Gilles Duceppe: Ah, Gilles. The guy is a badass, what can I say? He's awesome. He was the best one there. If I was a Seperatist, I would vote for him. If I were a quebecer, I would vote for him. Hell, if I were even 1/4 French I would vote for him. Who am I kidding? I would vote for him anyway. The guy is awesome. He's not exactly left wing or right wing, but everything he says makes sense. He's all for gay marriage and at least wants to decide on a foreign policy before Canada goes gun shopping. Vive la Quebec!  Ok, there was one moment where I doubted good ol Gilles. He was talking about money going to provinces instead of the federal government so that health care could be funded evenly and without conditions. And suddenly he lapsed into this creepy voice and he was like "I wants the preciousss, I needs the preciousss." and then he started glaring at Pauly and said " All the moneys are in Ottawa! None of the moneys are in Quebec! Quebec needs all the moneys! All the moneys for Quebec!" and then he realized what he was saying and shut up, and nobody talked about it again.   That's been my coverage of the 2004 leadership debate! Thank you and goodnight, er, morning.

      Well, It's morning and I never had to leave my house, and my backyard is still green and unburnt, and I am very grateful. They forecasted rain and the sun is still shining which goes to show that 'they' don't know nothin. I've figured out some things. #1 - I won't get any actual writing done while connected to msn or listening to music. I'm just too single-minded to be able to multitask like that. #2 - I need this book, I need to finish it by the end of the summer, and I need it to be my best work. If you don't understand that, I can't explain it to you. And #3 - I am sick and groggy, and useless to anyone until I manage to pull myself out of it (and copious amounts of codeine hasn't really given me the restful night's sleep I was hoping for) and what's more, my mountain hermit instincts are kicking in and I need to retreat for a day. I'll be back on Wednesday, hopefully with a driver's license in my hand, and Nate and I have agreed to do something then while he is off work, so I am allowing myself today to retreat. I am not so far away that I am out of reach, and those who need me know where to find me, but I'm cutting the lines at least a little.  I have spent a lot of time contemplating the sad/beautiful phrase, "No Hay Remedio"

      Okay, if you're allergic to whining I'll advise you to stop here. Yesterday I went outside at 12:00 to mow the lawn, figuring it had to be done. For those of you who don't know, I have a big lawn, it takes about two hours to finish. It was really hot and the bugs were bad, and I twisted my ankle at Chanel's house somehow and that really hurt. So I come inside, sit down for two seconds with my guitar, and my dad (who was making himself an omelette and chilling out with the paper while I was mowing the lawn) tells me he needs help with the shrub bed, which has (*gasp*) grass growing in it. So we spent upwards of three hours messing with the shrub bed, I get a blister on my hand, and dad advises me that bugspray won't hurt it. Wrong. Some of the most excruciating pain of my life, heavy duty bugspray dripping into my open blister. Anyway, I just felt like griping.  The book is coming really well. It's still a little slow, but it's working out. All the characters have changed, they're not really the people they were based on anymore. Especially Malcolm, Malcolm is 100% different. What I need now though, is a conflict, something has got to go wrong. I don't want any of the characters to get hurt, but that's the easiest way. I'll figure something out. Malcolm is a loose cannon, I'll see what I can do with him. I've got plans for Gavin, Gavin has a place in the ending. In general I just love writing this thing. My goal is to have it finished by the end of the summer. Do you think I'll make it?  So what comes next? I'm clinging to the hope that Nate will call me up some time today and say "Man I have the car, I'll be there in ten minutes, we're going to the beach." but I have a feeling that won't happen, because he seems to have a hard time getting the car. Wednesday I have my driving test. My dad says he will pay my insurance for two months, which is pretty cool. Wednesday afternoon I will go job searching/application filling. I really do need a job, I'm already bored of chilling out here and playing guitar, and I feel lazy for not having one. I don't think I'm going to go to La Guitare and try to get a job teaching lessons. Deep down I know I'm not good enough to get hired there, and too young. I'm still vainly hoping to find a cool job where dreads are acceptable, but I'm not too attached to that, cause I'm pretty sure it's not going to happen. The moral of this story is - Natty dread it up while you have the chance.

      It is nine thirty one and I'm drinking coffee and feeling really good, cause my family is still asleep and there is big open morning light outside, and I'm listening to "(Can't get no) satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones (And he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me). And I'm thinking to myself, self, Why don't I sit down and have a nice chat with my old blog? So I decided that's what I'd do. As of Friday I'm going out with Liz - not entirely sure how that happened, but I'm certainly not complaining. Liz is pretty great, so my plan is just to shut up as much as possible and avoid ruining things. There's a little voice in the back of my head saying "DontfuckupDontfuckupDontfuckupDontfuckup". Which is disconcerting actually. Anyway, I'm making a point of mentioning her on my blog just because apparently I don't warrant any recognition on hers :P. Not even "Oh yeah, I'm going out with this guy." Anyway, now is not the time to be bitter, it's sunshiney outside.   Yesterday I went to Lisa's (Dr. Pepper's) grad party, which was actually insufferably boring. Lisa, if you're reading this, I still love you but GAWD your party was boring. Maybe because it was mostly relatives and I didn't know anybody and I was feeling sick and couldn't get tissues because people were going to steal my chair. But it was ok, cause I chilled out with Nate, and jazzed it up with Matt (actually, what I mean is scatting jazz improvisationally, get your mind out of the homosexual gutter). On the bright side, there were these strawberry tarts which (I am quite sure) are better than sex by far. So we left late, and Dr. Pepper wants to pick up Chanel. So we're waiting in the car for twenty minutes before I get really mad and we start to go inside. Apparently Dr. Pepper -needed- forty five minutes to change and straighten her hair. I didn't see the point, but then again I'm not a woman. So by this time I'm a little impatient, I was supposed to call my parents from Deleavey's at six, and it's seven thirty. Then we stop to get Chanel smokes. Not a problem, only took thirty seconds or something. Then to the liquor store, where Matt and Lisa take forever picking out what they want. Then to superstore to get pop to mix teh booze with. Then to blockbuster to rent Scary Movie 3 (which i've already seen, and it isn't all that funny). Chanel stopped for a smoke at every stop. When we stopped at Superstore I commanded Matt to get back in the fucking car, and he didn't, so when he was almost at the superstore doors I took off chasing him down screaming at him but I didn't catch him before he got into the doors, and I didn't want security on my ass kicking me out of there. So I went back and hung out outside the car. By the time we got to Deleavey's it was Nine o'clock. I was supposed to be there for Six.  The thing about the party itself was - No matter what anyone tells you, things are often more fun while drinking. See, three or four hours of hanging out with Deleavey and Gagne is a ton of fun while drunk. But while sober it's sort of iffy. I watched Scary Movie 3 again, and it wasn't funnier the second time. Nate and I stayed sober together, even though Dr. Pepper pushed liquid candy on us. It was sooo good, and it tasted strong too, but we resisted. You would have been VERY proud of us. Alcohol is no good, it doesn't help anything. There are better things to do than drinking, like going to the beach for instance (OH how I long for the beach). The only point is, drinking parties are less fun without drinking, which means we need to find a new kind of high. Music would have been good, but Deleavey put his badASS telecaster with fat covered single coils (Gibson style) in storage. Which was especially bad, cause I learned to play "There is" by Boxcar Racer.   If you have read all of this, you get a cookie. Reedeem at participating Justin locations some conditions apply, Surgeon General's warning: Cookies are high in trans fats, which made lead to artherosclerosis and heart attacks, cookies not recommended for children ages 3 and under, no purchase necessary, some assembly required.   [Edit] I have a searchbar on my Internet Explorer which pops up words it thinks you want to search based on the sites you're on. When I'm on my weblog, it says: Black Sex, Sex Chat, Fat Woman, and Black cock. And Rent-a-car. Have I ever mentioned Black cock? (before now, I mean). I don't think so, I don't remember anyway. I'm a little disturbed by the subliminal messages I've obviously been sending.  [Edit 2] And Congratulations to Matt and Lisa on their engagement! I love both of you, and I wish you the best. I'll be there in 05'or whenever you have the wedding as an usher, so do I get free valet parking? We'll work out the details later. You guys are the best.

      Ok so it's 6:50 in the morning and I'm sitting at my computer because my sister isn't finished with the shower and I was woken up early by yelling and screaming down the hall. Somehow overnight I developed a runny nose and sore throat, don't ask me how. I'm inclined to say I caught something from michelle, aids in all likelihood, but I'm trying to be nice. I haven't put on any socks and I don't plan to. It's a little cold and I'm shivering, but maybe that's just me and not the temperature at all. 6:50 is a nice time of day, I think. Today I've got a Math exam, but I'm ready for it. Last night I wrote a song, called tomorrow morning or something, I don't know. I haven't really named it. It's a bad song, like all of the songs I write. I am too shy to post the lyrics. Here is a pome.  You, cold wind who comes through my window like slow fog calm and still softly sailing on night currents Making my toes shiver You are a blessing.

      Ok, I am going to straighten some things out. Meditation might not be what you think. There are two kinds in Buddhism (excluding some of the questionable nu-agey "spirit guide" kind of things out there) and they focus on two things: concentration and mindfulness. Concentration meditation involves focusing on one thing, usually the breath, and it allows you greater peace and clarity of mind. The second is mindfulness meditation, called vipassana, and by focusing on the truth and reality of your own mind and what is around you, vipassana gives you wisdom. Wisdom is what leads you to end your suffering. The Satipatthana (four foundations of mindfulness) Sutra, tells us that mindfulness is the only way to end suffering, and the Buddha makes the promise that in Seven years, Seven months, or Seven days of complete mindfulness, a meditator can gain either total awakening or else non-return (the stage before awakening).   Ok. So I doubt you care. But I've been doing both kinds of meditation for about half an hour a day for six months (half an hour is embarassingly little actually) and what have I noticed? Life is SO much more beautiful when you see it clearly. Walking around in a daze is overrated. For instance, every morning I look out my windows and see the forest which is always bright green and still. When I mentally wake myself up, clear away the anger and the headaches and the hunger and just  see  everything is perfect, it's me that's the problem. So far I have had two real spiritual experiences through meditation, although they are wholly unremarkable and ordinary, they are very important. The first has been that my mind is scattered! Terribly scattered, it floats away whenever I stop watching it and It can't even focus for more than two or three minutes at a time (and in the beginning this was twenty or thirty seconds), but I realized when I was focused everything became still and it was a very pleasurable feeling. The second realization has been impermanence. Thoughts arise and go away. Music starts and finished. My mind focuses and becomes unfocused. Trees grow and die. Houses are built and fall down. Through meditation I saw this (although it doesn't really take meditation at all to see it, it's obvious). Anything that is created will change. Change is universal and inescapable ( except for the unborn and uncreated Nibbana, but that's another issue).  Meditation is a wonderful experience, and I advise everyone to try it, regardless of whether you are Buddhist or not. Meditation is healthy, and gives a clarity of mind that you can't find anywhere else. It's better than being drunk, and it lasts longer than sex (lol). Meditation is a refuge, no matter where you and what you're doing you can meditate and be happy, and if you approach it the right will it will lead to true happiness all the time.

      Today was sort of fun. I had a real good time jamming the blues with Pete, and I learned how to do a blues shuffle on piano, which was pretty cool. We went down to Tims with our shirts off and basked in the sun and Jan made fun of me for having a sort of wobbly ab area, and I made fun of him for looking like a starved middle eastern child. Which kind of sucked, cause it's kind of cool to be a starved middle eastern child. I envy Jan cause he's got a year round tan and even less fat than me. I had an iced cappucino, and it was really tasty. I talked about languages and sex and what the rest of the summer will be like. I hummed Kaya by Bob Marley incessantly, (got to have..Kaya now) and that song makes me very happy. I know it's about drugs, and drugs are bad, but It makes me happy. To clarify, there is no drug which can beat meditation, and the pure view of real life, and so they are a waste of time. I am getting back to work on the book soon, because I think I know where to go from here. I thought I would share with you the Sunflower Sutra by Allen Ginsberg (it's not a real Sutra, but it is a perfect description of how I feel and it makes me happy to read it).    Sunflower Sutra  I walked on the banks of the tincan banana dock and  sat down under the huge shade of a Southern  Pacific locomotive to look at the sunset over the  box house hills and cry.  Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron  pole, companion, we thought the same thoughts  of the soul, bleak and blue and sad-eyed,  surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of  machinery.  The oily water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun  sank on top of final Frisco peaks, no fish in that  stream, no hermit in those mounts, just ourselves  rheumy-eyed and hungover like old bums  on the riverbank, tired and wily.  Look at the Sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray  shadow against the sky, big as a man, sitting  dry on top of a pile of ancient sawdust--  --I rushed up enchanted--it was my first sunflower,  memories of Blake--my visions--Harlem  and Hells of the Eastern rivers, bridges clanking Joes  Greasy Sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black  treadless tires forgotten and unretreaded, the  poem of the riverbank, condoms & pots, steel  knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck  and the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the  past--  and the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset,  crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog  and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye--  corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like  a battered crown, seeds fallen out of its face,  soon-to-be-toothless mouth of sunny air, sunrays  obliterated on its hairy head like a dried  wire spiderweb,  leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures  from the sawdust root, broke pieces of plaster  fallen out of the black twigs, a dead fly in its ear,  Unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower O  my soul, I loved you then!  The grime was no man's grime but death and human  locomotives,  all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad  skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black  mis'ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance  of artificial worse-than-dirt--industrial--  modern--all that civilization spotting your  crazy golden crown--  and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless  eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the  home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar  bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards  of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely  tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what  more could I name, the smoked ashes of some  cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the  milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs  & sphincters of dynamos--all these  entangled in your mummied roots--and you there  standing before me in the sunset, all your glory  in your form!  A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent  lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye  to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited  grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden  monthly breeze!  How many flies buzzed round you innocent of your  grime, while you cursed the heavens of the  railroad and your flower soul?  Poor dead flower? when did you forget you were a  flower? when did you look at your skin and  decide you were an impotent dirty old locomotive?  the ghost of a locomotive? the specter and  shade of a once powerful mad American locomotive?  You were never no locomotive, Sunflower, you were a  sunflower!  And you Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me  not!  So I grabbed up the skeleton thick sunflower and stuck  it at my side like a scepter,  and deliver my sermon to my soul, and Jack's soul  too, and anyone who'll listen,  --We're not our skin of grime, we're not our dread  bleak dusty imageless locomotive, we're all  beautiful golden sunflowers inside, we're blessed  by our own seed & golden hairy naked  accomplishment-bodies growing into mad black  formal sunflowers in the sunset, spied on by our  eyes under the shadow of the mad locomotive  riverbank sunset Frisco hilly tincan evening  sitdown vision.   Allen Ginsberg  Berkeley, 1955

      The first day of exam week has come and gone, I think I managed pretty well with Biology. I have managed to avoid being bludgeoned with the didgeridoo of information, thanks to temporary omniscience coming from the ultimate realization attained while studying Biology. After becoming rightly self-awakened, I took the test, and lapsed back into ignorance. I'm scared about Chemistry tomorrow, but it really it ain't no thing. I'm going to pass, and I'm not afraid of a low grade.  Had a good time today, chilling out at Owen's house, playing guitar. Owen, Liz, Nate and I just relaxed and did some jamming, and I taught Liz to play some stuff, and she taught me to play piano, and very little Chemistry was studied. I am struggling with the book, it needs something it's not getting. The whole "ecstatic experience of the city" thing isn't working so fully anymore, it needs another dimension, and I'm trying to find this.  Tomorrow I will write a blues song, and will not worry one bit.

      Mood: Zen Listening to: Song to Sing when I'm lonely- John Frusciante   It has been a good day, mostly spent sitting out on the screened in deck sitting in the sunshine and reading biology and One Dharma. I wrote a song today, haven't done that in a while. It's called the Sunflower song. That's the kind of mood I was in today. I cooked hamburgers and they were tasty, but I felt guilty because something had to die for me to enjoy it. It doesn't seem fair, it doesn't seem fair at all. I haven't quite realized school is over. I don't have a job, and the process of "applying" (aka me not doing anything with the vague idea that I will eventually go and apply) has dragged on for about three weeks now. Oh well, I'm not worried about it.   I'm looking forward to the summer, and the rest of my life in general. I am wondering what I will be like at 50. I am wondering what I will be like at 17. I would like to live on a house boat.   " Absolutely nothing is to be clung to as "I" or "mine"."  - Shakyamuni Buddha

      This weekend has been a satori, a sudden illumination. I think maybe it is just the chemicals in my brain overproducing happy, but everything has fallen into place and everything is suddenly radiant and clear. Suddenly Dzogchen (the Tibetan Natural Great Perfection) seems evident before me, and I wonder how I could have missed it. I am re-reading One Dharma by Joseph Goldstein, and underneath my bedsheets the words almost seem to glow with truth, and I wonder how I am the only one who sees this. Of course I am still getting headaches, and there were moments of loneliness, and a flicker of self-doubt, but there is no more confusion in the wake of the truth. I want a T-shirt that says "tell the children the truth." I don't know what truth it is they need to know, but I really think they ought to be told the truth. If I ever end up having kids, they will know about the birds and the bees by the time they can walk, and will probably never believe in Santa Claus (I don't know if I could lie to them so blatantly) and they will grow up to be wonderful nature loving crazies. My favorite saying of the Buddha's right now is " Be islands unto yourself, be refuges unto yourself, for he who is an island, and he who is a refuge, will surely go the distance. Hold no head above your own." We cannot count on anyone but ourselves to find happiness.   Went to Nate's house on Friday to watch the Cat in the Hat with him, michelle, and liz. The Cat in the Hat scares me, he really does. He's six feet tall and beats the kids with his tail. If a six foot tall man in a cat suit showed up at my house, I would have no choice but to kick him firmly in the groin and call the police. It was a fun time though, we cooked some -awful- tasting chicken, and I beat liz at Soul Calibur (again!) and there was much rejoicing.   There are exams next week and I'm not too worried about them because grades mean nothing in the big scheme of thing, they are just words on paper and have nothing to do with my true calling, which is writing. Still, I will work hard cause I like to have a nice report card, out of vanity. I have Biology tomorrow, Chemistry tuesday, Theatuh Ahts on wednesday, English on thursday, and Math on friday. After exams I will probably just chill out and jam around at owen's house, maybe go on some extended (3 hour) tims runs, and also do some studying. Tomorrow is going to be pure panic studying for chemistry, with only brief interjections of jamming though. As Marley said, Don't worry about a thing, cause every little thing is going to be alright. Trust in the prophet, my friends, listen to Marley.

      Ok, boys and girls, lock and load.  It's revolution time again. I can feel it in me bones, something has got to move and shake and I have a feeling this one is major, maybe an eight or nine on the revolution richter scale. Actually, this one is mostly personal, although I've been railing against commercialism (and my english class) for a while too. Read adbusters if you want to feel what I'm talking about. The thing is, I have not been so good lately. Something is unbalanced in my mind, body, nature etc. that is leading to many headaches, a feeling of confusion and a distance from Dharma. So I've been thinking about making changes. Like cooking for myself instead of eating the trans fat stuff my parents bring home and "cook" (microwave or bake) for me. I want to really start eating healthy, because it is in my nature to be a granola cruncher anyway, so I should embrace it. And also, there is too much television going on, and I hate to say it, but too much internet. There is not enough meditation. When I'm hanging out with friends I talk to much. I keep trying to express myself, to howl out the ecstacy that is present in every synapse of my mind but I am realizing it's not necessary. If they don't understand yet, they never ever will. Maybe more silence and compassion is in order, and less (or more silent) howling. I am thinking that my Bhikkhus life does not have enough Bhikkhu in it. There is still room for being a Zen Lunatic like always, with crazy wisdom and random howling and expounding of Sutras, but there is also much more room for contemplation.   Anyway, things are not working. I have headaches too much, and I am sad too much, and the summer is almost beginning and I want to set a balance in my mind. Revolution, brothers and sisters, is in the air. I'll keep you posted on the changes that will be made. Why don't you leave a comment if you're with me. Consider it a call to arms.

      So there I am having the beatific vision and writing, after a morning of talking on msn and listening to music (Ani DiFranco and Beatles and Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsies playing Machine Gun). The beginning of another unproductive day is offset, suddenly vision interferes and I know it will be a 4000 word day. 4500 words later I feel spent and tired but that I have really done good things. It was mostly all in conversations, Oliver and Gavin talking, and then Oliver and Lucy, and I reread parts of it and I love it, especially where Oliver falls in the pool. I don't think there is a better feeling than writing more than you thought you could, and knowing it is all good stuff, and then finishing your green tea and going upstairs to read Kerouac (who, oddly enough, is not an over rated hack, although some people seem to think so), his book Desolation Angels which has a special place in my heart because being alone at the cottage is sort of like being alone at the top of desolation peak. I am going back to the cottage tomorrow, although I have tried to convince my parents to leave me behind to write. Maybe I will drive back if the urge overwhelms me. I want to see all my friends again.

      Good morning. I am really in awe of how impermanent everything is. Everything changes, and everything changes so fast that you can barely pinpoint what caused it, and almost nothing stays the same. Things seem permanent when you think of them as solid and full and real, but my room on a good day and my room on a bad day are entirely seperate rooms. I am sitting here now and I am in a moment of subtle writing happiness and it's sunny outside and I'm wondering where to disappear to. Two days ago I lay on the floor in my room with my eyes closed listening to Miss Sarajevo, and feeling entranced and sad and lost. And Yesterday was unimagineably surreal and very good for my head, beaching and sun and cold water and irrepressible happiness. There is true beach magic that I need sometimes. I remember Led Zeppelin's lines "I wonder how tomorrow could ever follow today" because I would never have believed two days ago I would have been there or here, and I have no clue what tomorrow will be like at all. Impermanence is wonderful.

      &nbsp; 5:51, lay face down on the carpet in my bedroom with arms sprawled out and grasping nothing, and listened to Miss Sarajevo by U2 five and a half times, and wondered what it is about that song that does what it does. And then closed my eyes and listened to it again.

      &nbsp; Ok, so a lot of time has been spent contemplating Jazz and America and Communism and Love and the nature of existence. What can I say? It's all good. I am writing the book a little bit at a time, and there are bits I like and bits that are not so good but still okay. I'm more worried that the whole thing gels together as a book, and doesn't end up seeming like a hundred little anecdotes and personal ideas and problems. Jazz is the language of ecstasy. America is the great land of few Buddhas, and the giant corrupter of loves, and the seller of commodities, and the destroyer of virtues, and the comfortable land of dying hearts. Communism is the perfect improbability, and the truth, and the right way, and the way that poor hateful greedy angry human beans will never do right. And Love is Love and does not need words, and helps you get over the little stupid things every day that don't matter (chores and bills and jobs and parental advice and practicality) and the moment you stop being love you are not really living, and I am in love right now. The nature of existence is the easiest question, because we all exist, and everything depends on everything else, and everything is empty of self, and there is nothing that time doesn't eat away and return to the earth and there is nothing that's born that doesn't die, and death and birth are the same thing anyhow. And the heartache of it is that it's all so fucking beautiful, and it hurts to know it doesn't last forever, but if I were a Buddha I would just smile and be happy to enjoy the beauty for even one solitary second, and not be greedy to have the flower forever.   It is another rainy day and I feel as if I am fading in and out of reality and drifting through this house like an old duppy (spirit) and my dreadlocks are oily and clumpy but natural and filled with nature's blessings, and I am longing to partake in some kind of informal shindig. (crowds of&nbsp;people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said, hey boy do you want to score?.... they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, he said his friends would all drop by) And a part of me still wants to leave this damned continent and return to where my ancestors were, back to Europe, and maybe all the way back to Africa where it all started. Or maybe to Asia where my spiritual ancestors drank tea and meditated under the Bodhi tree. And then reality hits that there is no car and I can't even leave this fucking house, and I have no money, and no job, and no only maybe a few people who believe in me. I believe in me, even after all this time. But I still have my illusions and fantasies and hallucinations, and I would not really be me without them. (Sitting in Ireland drinking coffee nine thirty in the cold foggy morning Dublin not-so busy old buildings and sighing Irish cobblestone streets I am writing furiously about what, I don't know, like James Joyce did once) It is almost August, did you know that? August is a wonderful time of year and I will be happy when it is August, but I am also scared because August gives way to great and terrible September which ends natural ecstasy, and pushes you back into formed rows of desks and teachers and bells and shuffling cattle hallways. Hopefully next year I will be a duppy and appear and disappear at will, and there will be great lunch hour philosophy discussions and religious epiphanies and Tim Hortons pilgrimages, and planning of the after-high school void. This has been a long entry and it reads a little like my book, except more spontaneous and wispy, and I am going to go now.

      &nbsp; Good morning, loves! I hope you are doing wonderfully. It is a little rainy outside right now, and I am glad to have my computer back because I am planning on doing some writing today. My dad took it in to get fixed, and they deleted all my mp3s. Every last fucking one. Nothing was spared. I have nothing to listen to, and no program to download music. At least they saved my book. I was worried they would kill it.  What has happened since we last talked? Let me think. Oh! indeed, that's right, I have dreadlocks. So far, being dreaded has not been such a positive experience. It took a total of fifteen hours of excruciating pain with my sister backcombing like mad and stabbing me. And when they were finished, they stood straight up like waxy liberty spikes, and made me very sad. But now they've settled down. The last kick in the balls is this - I can't wash them for a week because they will fall apart if I wash them too soon. Do you know how nasty dreads get even after two days? It's disgusting, really. I still love them though. And yesterday I actually went out and did something, which was cool. I took the car and said I was going to Nate's. So I did, but then he hopped in the car and we picked up Liz. This was phase A of the plan, pick up Liz and get something to eat. So we drove the McDonalds in Magnetic hill, and Nate stole me a milkshake, and got some boardwalk tickets, and we set off to go gocarting which was fun. And then we drove to the mall (in the process of which I nearly got us killed several times cutting people off and changing lanes at the last minute and in general mystifying my fellow drivers with totally random and unpredictable movements) And Nate got Best of U2, from 1990-2000. And Finally, we returned to Nate's house and he burned me a copy of the CD (glee) and we chilled out and watched part of Daredevil which was so tacky and cheesy and gross that it was funny. Liz had basketball at 8, so it was pretty much over by then anyway, and I can't drive after dark so I was home at 9. Plans for today? 4000 words in the book, reading Desolation Angels, not washing my dreadlocks. That's the plan.

          You can tell I've been bored because there's been what, five posts today? There is nothing to do around here, and nothing to read, and no one to talk to, which was bad because rainy days make me lonely. For dinner I had Indian food (chicken Vindoori and Shrimp Marsala with Basmati rice and Naan bread) which was very tasty. I think if I wanted to lose weight I would eat a lot of Indian food. It's not very bad for you, and it's spicy enough that you drink a lot of water and thus eat less food. Nate dropped by, which made me feel good. I got Desolation Angels by Jack Kerouac, and a writers magazine and a guitar magazine. I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow but I don't want it to be like today.&nbsp;I had a good birthday though, in general. I wish I was in a crowded room right now. Goodnight.

          I hate this blog and this computer and the fact that I have a headache. I just wrote a song that I actually kind of like. And I had a revelation. Myself and some other people (I need backup vocals, maybe a bass, we'll see) simply HAVE to play Get Up Stand Up at the next coffeehouse. Can you imagine it? It's political, it's by Marley, and I bet we could get the audience really into and physically standing up. It would be great, if we could translate it into acoustic. I think everybody should stand up for their rights. I think we all have more rights than we know about, the right to respect and dignity at least. I am sleepy and my parents won't let me make Liz come over to dread my hair, and they won't give me my Kerouac books, so maybe I will go knock myself unconscious or something. My soul is violin music

                          Seventeen feels a LOT like sixteen, although maybe ever so slightly more itchy. Last night I had a shindig with some amigos, it was a good time. Nate was unable to make it but was awesome about it and gave me a call while at work, which was cool. I think the highlight for me was the full reading of Howl (although it was probably more fun to read than to listen) while drinking the non-alcoholic wine. In general I was touched by the kindness of my friends, bringing all kinds of things with them and even gifts ( Yeah, so did your girlfriend get you a hemp necklace and a T-shirt with a  dreaded smiley face? . No, I didn't think so. Shut down.) It was kind of funny though because it honestly didn't occur to me that they were gifts, it only dawned on me later. Anyway, thank you amigos for your compassion and generosity, I can safely say *seven year old voice* This is the best whiteyversary  ever !   But what went on? First of all I bickered with my parents and they dutifully informed me that they had just decided I can only have one person in the car at a time, so I took the car and picked Nick up, we went and snagged a copy of Almost Famous at Blockbuster and came back to my house, and chilled out for a while until everyone else showed up. We then ate hamburgers which really sucked for some reason. I didn't overcook them though, despite the misinformed posse's assumptions, because hamburgers need that. There is a big blank, and then the poetry reading, and then another big blank and writing " Fuck tha Police" on our chests ( I was Tha) with lipstick, and then Nick and Andrew got their nails painted, there was a discussion on how to marinate a baby (I say that a little garlic, lemon, oregano and sicilian olive oil would get the furthest) and a discussion on global politics, and glow stick wars, and I tackled Owen and took him down, and then another blank and chilling out with Liz and Laura at my table and playing with a glow stick in my mouth ( Mandiblshe of def!) and then I must have gone to bed. And now, because I am bored, I will fill out this long and irrelevant survey.   1) Using band names, spell out your name.  J -&nbsp; Jimi Hendrix  U – U2  S - Sublime  T – the Beatles  I - Incubus  N – Norah Jones   2) Have you ever had a song written about you?: Nope  3) What song makes you cry?: Well I don’t really –cry- at songs in the wailing sobbing sense, but I get tears at a couple. Little Wing by Jimi Hendrix, Scar Tissue by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Any John Frusciante (although I can’t explain why)   4) What song makes you happy?: Don’t get me started. This instant – Concrete Jungle by Bob Marley because it’s such bloody genius.  5) What do you like to listen to before bed? I don’t listen to music before I go to bed because it screws up my meditation and then I can’t sleep.   a p p e a r a n c e  HEIGHT: 6ish  HAIR COLOR: brown  SKIN COLOR: caucasian  EYE COLOR: blue  PIERCINGS: none  TATTOOS: none yet  r i g h t - n o w  WHAT COLOR PANTS ARE YOU WEARING?: Blue striped pajamas  WHAT SONG ARE YOU LISTENING TO OR WATCHING?: Concrete Jungle by Marley  TASTE IS IN YOUR MOUTH?: really strong tea  WHAT'S THE WEATHER LIKE?: sort of overcast  HOW ARE YOU?: wonderful!  &nbsp;d o - y o u  GET MOTION SICKNESS?: not normally, but sometimes when sailing  HAVE A BAD HABIT?: Maybe a couple  GET ALONG WITH YOUR PARENTS?: Very well. Lately we argue about driving (cause I want to, and they don’t want me to basically) but I couldn’t even imagine insulting or yelling at my parents.   f a v o r i t e s  TV SHOW: Don’t watch much  &nbsp;TVMAGAZINE: Adbusters, in spite of having only looked at the pictures  SODA: don’t like it so much, but sprite I would say.  THING TO DO ON THE WEEKEND: Write, read, sleep, dream, hallucinate, talk, jam, etc. etc.  h a v e - y o u  BROKEN THE LAW: not really, on anything important at least  RAN AWAY FROM HOME: Ok, when you live in the woods where I do, running away doesn’t really look like an option. As a kid, if you have any common sense, you know that the wolves will get you before you ever reach the highway. And even if you do get to the highway, you’ve still got a long walk before you hit civilization. So apologizing for whatever you did and sucking it is often more appealing than running away. Short answer – no.  SNUCK OUT OF THE HOUSE: same reason as above. Where would I go? I suppose now I can drive, but before it would have been really stupid cause then I’d just be walking around my neighborhood.  EVER GONE SKINNY DIPPING: not yet  MADE A PRANK PHONE CALL: nope  EVER TIPPED OVER A PORTA POTTY: no  USED YOUR PARENTS' CREDIT CARD BEFORE: No  SKIPPED SCHOOL BEFORE: oh yeah  FELL ASLEEP IN THE SHOWER/BATH: no  BEEN IN A SCHOOL PLAY: Yes. Let us speak no more of this.  LET A FRIEND CRY ON YOUR SHOULDER: emotionally? Yeah. Physically? I don’t think so. EVER HAD A MAJOR REGRET: it’s going to sound like I’m lying, but no. I don’t really regret anything I’ve done. I’ve done plenty of things wrong but I’ve always done the best I could do, and it’s all led me to where I am today (which is a very lucky and wonderful position) and so I have no major regrets.  &nbsp;l o v e  BOYFRIEND: I’ve got a couple   GIRLFRIEND: I’ve got a Liz, if that’s what you mean.  CHILDREN: tons of illegitimate kiddies running around, in all corners of the globe  BEEN IN LOVE?: Ok, random tangent. I think I’ve been in love my whole life, since I was born. I think I fall in love ten or twelve times a day, with people and songs and moments and ideas and politics and spirits and poems. I know I’ve loved people sincerely and unromantically and that I do love people like that right now, and I’m beginning to wonder if there’s a difference between that love and romantic love (which is somehow special and different I guess). I am answering this question yes, because I have been in love my whole life, in one way or the other. Isn’t love just love? Do we really have to classify and organize and rank it? Can one love mean more than another love? I don’t know anything other than I am full of love, whatever kind it is.  HAD A HARD TIME GETTING OVER SOMEONE: no.  BEEN HURT?: Everybody has.  YOUR GREATEST REGRET?: I don’t know.   GONE OUT WITH A SOMEONE YOU ONLY KNEW FOR 3 DAYS: Yeah I think so.  r a n d o m  DO YOU HAVE A JOB: No  YOUR CD PLAYER HAS IN IT RIGHT NOW: Copious amounts of Marley, old coffeehouse CD, Led Zeppelin IV, and my new Beat Poetry readings.  IF YOU WERE A CRAYON, WHAT COLOR WOULD YOU BE?: Awesome colored, obviously.  WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?: A lot of things. Big things like friends and family and freedom and music and Buddhism and all that sort of thing, and really little things like a cup of tea in the morning and a place to sleep at night, and walking with bare feet.  WHO MAKES YOU THE HAPPIEST?: Everybody makes me happy.  WHAT'S THE NEXT CD YOU'RE GONNA GET?: I don’t really buy many   CDs WHO DO YOU CONSIDER GOOD FRIENDS?: &nbsp;All my friends are good friends.  w h e n / w h a t - w a s - t h e - l a s t  TIME YOU CRIED?: full out? Quite a while ago, probably two or three years  YOU GOT A REAL LETTER:? I got a birthday card in the mail, does that count?  YOU GOT E-MAIL: yesterday  TV PROGRAM YOU WATCHED: the Daily Show with Jon Stewart  MOVIE YOU SAW AT THE THEATER: The Terminal  y o u r - t h o u g h t s - o n  ABORTION:&nbsp;We have no right to tell a woman what she can and can’t do with her own body. Abortion is never nice, but sometimes it can be the right thing to do.  TEENAGE SMOKING: teenage smokers grow up into adult smokers, who die of cancer.  SPICE GIRLS: who?  SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE: I don’t see how a marriage license and a church changes something from being wrong to right, but that’s just my opinion. I think everybody needs to make up their own minds, and I have an immense amount of respect for the people who have the discipline to be celibate (in general, not just before marriage).  DOWNLOADING MUSIC ILLEGALLY: sure, although I dislike the fact that musicians don’t get the money. But with the state of affairs in the music industry today, I wouldn’t mind fifty cent having to sell a car or two. Besides, I only download dead people’s music.

          &nbsp; Ok, so here is the deal. I went to my cottage for a period of time, I don't know how long. It was quite nice, although hot at night and I had a very bad sleep and it was not so comfortable, and there were&nbsp;a couple of bad headaches. But there was a&nbsp;very pleasant intermission where Liz came over and I think we both got sunburnt, although mine is not so bad, not even sore really.&nbsp;Memere thought I was irresponsible for "allowing" Liz to get sunburnt, and expected that I should have realized she&nbsp;was blonde and thus prone to sunburning and have&nbsp;forced her to&nbsp;put sunscreen on. But it was all a good time, and by the time she got there&nbsp;I had drank three cups of coffee and was naturally high anyway. So the whole day was like this really sunny dream. I watched Gothika and Love Actually. They were both very good movies. I wrote a half a song and scrapped it although it was catchy. I did not write any poetry. I missed my book very much because I am looking forward to writing more. It is always good to go to the beach, If I am able to drive there (which is iffy at the moment) I will be going every sunny day because that is where I want to be, and just pray that I don't get skin cancer like I am constantly warned of.   I listened to "A day in the Life" by the Beatles today for the first time and it really blew my mind (excuse the pun with the lyrics) there is something about that song which is intense and hits me. In general ever since I've started downloading music again (stopped caring how screwed up this computer is) I've downloaded a bunch of Beatles. I am not so fond of the early stuff, the more rock and roll stuff, but all of the psychedelic stuff is bloody genius. And "All you need is love" makes me absurdly happy. I believe that you know, not literally obviously but  really  because if people have got love they will be okay I think. I am fascinated by John and Yoko's 'Year for Peace' in 1969 where they tried to reach people in every way possible to promote peace, and really believed they could make a difference. They didn't but I really think they could have.

      &nbsp; So I will now document for you the events of the past days. There have been no miracles or epiphanies, and as far as I know no one has had any visions or revelations. This dissapoints me, but I'll get over it. I have had very few visions this summer, and it bothers me a little that I have not accumulated very many stories, I have not gone out and experienced all that I could, but hopefully the second half of the summer will be more intense or at least more productive than the first half. Highlights of the past day? Several steady hours of listening to Bob Marley. Reading about how he died, which is tragic. He got cancer, and had to have chemotherapy and so all of his locks fell out in his hands, and he died anyway. All of my heroes are dead. I spent some time writing and reading over my manuscript. I tried unsuccesfully to write a blues song, mostly because nothing I can write compares to When The Levee Breaks, and so I give up. I talked to Liz last night on the phone and somehow the conversation diverged into communist territory, and the whole rant came out of me. Well, not all of it, because the whole communist rant would take weeks, but the basics of it that Andrew and I discussed throughout the winter. People have the right, not the privelege, of food and shelter and clothing, and it is wrong that people die in the streets of hunger when North Americans are in their big homes sipping martinis and tipping the boy who cleans their pool. We didn't go to the cottage because it rained. It might rain today or it might be nice, I don't know. Either way I am okay with it. I am very very happy because in a few days it is my birthday. I am not so excited about the birthday part, or my friends coming over, or even the joyous event of being able to cook for people, but the fact that my parents are getting me Desolation Angels and Big Sur by Jack Kerouac. The Brothers Karamazov will be discarded very, very fast. And I am going to take a very good piece of advice from my number one soul brother and get to the writing.

      Spent the day yesterday dreading Liz. I swear that most of the world was against it, but somehow I convinced my parents to give me the car for the afternoon (the shiny happy company pontiac that I am insured on but not normally allowed to even touch) and so I brought my Marley CD and went over and backcombed like hell and it turned out really well, considering that at first dreads are supposed to look like shit. Of course my jealousy has only increased. I'm 100% sure I'm getting dreads in my lifetime. 95% sure it'll be in the next year. The only question is, do it now on impulse, or wait and grow my hair out a little longer. I forgot to mention that I had&nbsp; an epiphany. It was during a miserable headache in the middle of the night when it was hot and I couldn't sleep, and it lasted about an hour and I figured it all out - all of it. Well, not all of it, but almost. I am taking this summer one day at a time, one hour at a time, one minute at a time. And I don't have a plan.   Did some writing today, although not very much. I reread a couple of chapters of my book, and I'm very proud of them. I find them entertaining anyway, although I'm obviously a little biased. I see things that need work, but overall I see an amusing, intense, and optimistic novel that stars some really good characters. It's only at 41000 words though, so there's a lot more that needs to be done. I'm shooting for 125,000 which is a pretty standard length for a novel. If I feel it needs to be ended earlier I'll end it, if I figure there is more to be said I'll continue it. It's a nice feeling to be proud of it though, I was very ashamed of my last book. But just as I am getting back into the swing of thing, I'm pulled away. Tomorrow afternoon I leave for the cottage. Don't know how long I'm staying, probably a couple of days or until it rains. I'll keep writing poetry, maybe post something when I come back. I got a call from Owen "El Chezzedoro" Burns, who dutifully informs me that my wonderful and compassionate friends have decided to plan a shindig for me. I was very flattered. I guess we'll see what we can do about shindigging at or nearby the beach. Again, the cottage number is 532-3378. I'll be chilling there for a while. Also, for a limited time only cast your vote in the dread poll - Should Justin let his fuzzy curly hair grow for a while, or should he natty dread it up soon?

      At eleven o'clock last night I was really thinking about what I'm going to do for the rest of the summer, and it's something kind of important. Before I was pulling for a cottage life, being left there with minimal food allowances and fending for myself. This situation would kind of backfire though, because I would have no way of leaving (there's no way they're leaving me with a car) and the book would not get finished. The other option is finding a way to live in this house for the rest of the summer happily. I can drive now so it would not be so bad, I could always make day trips to the beach when I long to see mother ocean. I could set out&nbsp;a schedule with my family, and maybe work something out so I could write in peace all morning (without msn or music) and then find something important to do all afternoon. Anyway, what I'm doing right now is not working and I am trying to make it work somehow.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I am insanely jealous of Liz and her dreadgetting endeavors. I should be happy for her, but I am very selfish and want dreads. I am thinking that if I don't get a job this summer or next year, I am going to dread myself. It is frustrating not to have dreads, because my hair is just begging for it. It is thick and fuzzy and big and takes to dreads really easily. And besides, I am a dread personality. Ok, this has been enough whining about wanting dreads. But if Liz chickens out or has extra wax, guess who is coming home natty.  &nbsp;  I'm really not kidding. Read  urlLink Howl  by Allen Ginsberg. Do it. Do it or I'll kill this fucking baby. Ok I'm not serious. But Read it.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Got my license today, gonna clear up the insurance thing tonight so I'm legally allowed to drive. Did some writing, but not much. My birthday is in ten days. Probably just going to celebrate with my family over some Indian food, and keep it as carefree as possible. I recall planning some 'extra' celebrations with Deleavey a while back, but I'm not sure that will happen. My parents hounded me about what I wanted for a gift. I could only think of one thing (er, two things): Desolation Angels and Big Sur by Jack Kerouac. I will read Desolation Angels first, and when I am ready for my optimism to be crushed I will read Big Sur. I am thinking I would like to give gifts for my birthday. That would be cool but I have no money. If you want to know what I am thinking, the post below is still true.

      I have gone to both Nate's and Deleavey's. Deleavey's parties are not so much fun as they used to be because there is no alcohol to make everybody seem interesting, and fewer opportunities for insanity. And Nate's was fun, but for the first half I was overwhelmed by all the senses going into my head and felt very hazy (some Buddhists call this your crown chakra opening up, I don't know about that but it felt wierd) and for the second half I got quite a bad headache and wanted to be somewhere quiet. I'm sure being social could be much more fun than it is right now. Or maybe I am just antisocial by nature. I hope I'm not. I remember having very good times with groups of people, it just seems like that was a very long time ago.  I am not enjoying being home. I haven't written in my book. Writing is scary, it's hard, and it's intimidating, and I haven't had the courage yet to sit down and face that blank page. There are nice things. I have clean hot showers, and my bed has room for me to tunnel around it and is comfortable, and I can talk to people whenever I want to on msn, but somehow it all seems hollow and pointless. The cottage is better, but not much. At least the cottage is honest, and there are no distractions to hide behind. It is like Jack Kerouac said - he expected to find God or Tathagata (Buddha essence) at the top of Desolation Peak, but all he found was himself without drugs or alcohol to hide behind, and it was scary. Right now I want to be scared. This big house with hardwood floors and clean walls and new furniature, it's not me. I feel very out of place and disordered. I prefer my small and hard sandy bed at the cottage, where I woke up and fiddled with the taps for 20 minutes in order to get a hot shower, and made breakfast of dry toast and instant coffee that tastes -awful-. A part of my personality is the Bhikkhu who loves renouncing all luxery and living simply. But I don't belong here, and I know it. Hopefully soon I will pack up my things and move again, to the cottage to stay for a while.

      I don't know what it is but I feel really good right now, really ridiculously good. In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe. Already this morning I have talked to people, which is a luxery I no longer take for granted, and last night I had a good time with good people. I'm not sure what I'm going to do for the rest of the summer. I may get a job, I may not. I will continue writing the book, and I got a great idea last night for a chapter later on in the story. I might write it now and insert it later on. I might be returning to the cottage later this week with the family. I hope to hang out with Nate and company more often.   Have you read Howl by Ginsberg? It is so beautiful. This morning I feel like I want to DO all of it. There is no other explanation. I want to pass out in the middle of the street, write in the middle of the night, cry in the shower, talk constantly about everything in the world, be silent for long stretches of time, go places, meet new people, allow my moods to take over and stop fighting my true nature. Read so many books that I mix them up mentally, and make an honest effort to quote them all in conversation. Meditate more, and read every single verse in the Dhammapada (quote those too) and more Han Shan poetry. I want to call people out of the blue to tell them about poetry. I want to write 4000 words a day again. I want to throw myself at the book with renewed energy. I want to say all of the things I have never said to people. I want to cook a lot, and cook all of the crazy asian food I want to cook, along with the normal stuff. I want to laugh for no reason, and remain silent when everyone else is laughing at stupid things. I want to be solemn and crazy. I want to be ridiculously happy and terribly sad. I don't want to pretend I'm ok when I'm not. I want to be honest every day, completely. I don't want to hide a single thing from anyone. I want to dream about other countries. I want to know about Islam, and Bahai'i, and to know more about the religions I already know about. I am open to God if he comes to me. I want to sit on the ground or in Tim Hortons and talk about revolution and politics and global events and the future of western civilization. I want to make Liz perfectly and completely happy, although I'm not sure how. I know how to make myself happy, but I am much too in love with sadness, and too youthful yet. I want to talk in whispers. I want to listen to John Coltrane again, and all kinds of Jazz, for hours. I want to be very kind to all of my friends. I want to love truly and honestly and deeply and unconditionally every person I meet. I want to play music, all kinds of music. I want to be an angry intellectual again. I want to collapse completely. I want to meet a prophet. I want to scream. All of it. I want to do all of it. And more than that.

      Wow, two weeks passed remarkably quickly, but then again my entire experience of beachside seclusion was bordering surreality and so it's hard to judge time. It would be very difficult for me to describe what it was like out there, very difficult. I wrote some poetry about it, I wrote quite a bit of poetry actually simply because I can't write prose with a pen (too slow) and I had large chunks of time on my hand. The weather changes quickly there, so in a single day there can be thundershowers and bright sunny weather. And it is comforting, but it also messes with your head a little in a friendly kind of way. That was mostly because I was away from everyone, and Liz was the only one to call me. I read a LOT. First of all, I read Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by Joyce, and Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. All three were very good. I am scared of hell because of James Joyce. I told Liz maybe I will go to mass just to have all my bases covered, and to a mosque too, and all of that. I suppose attendance alone doesn't redeem my immortal soul from not believing in a somewhat standoffish and omnipotent God who is prepared to cast me into a lake of fire, but that's just something I'll have to get over. It's especially hard because in Buddhism belief doesn't mean anything. Enlightenment takes a lot of work and dedication to get to it, and there is no easy way, which sucks. I kind of wish that I could just pledge my dedication to something and have my ticket punched and a parking space readied for me in paradise. Oh Well. The Conrad book was scary too, but for different reasons, because it is about much more earthly things, and the animal inside all of our heads. I am halfway through the Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky, which is even better than Crime and Punishment, and is a very good book, despite being irregularly long and involved. It has a lot of Catholicism in it too, I feel like I'm in a seminary or something.  But back to the two weeks. Basically it consisted of rainy days, occasional sunny days, a lot of overcast weather, a lot of rented movies (watched High Fidelity, and the movie about Jackson Pollock) and writing poetry, and reading. I can't say I learned anything, except that seclusion does not suit me, not for any extended period of time at least (a few days is nice) but it was good for me. My headaches are no better, but that hacking cough has cleared up, and I look less like a heroin addict than before, and maybe some of the cobwebs in my head have been cleared out. The beach tends to do that, clear out your head. You are forced to look at things directly when you alone in an old cottage and there is nothing to distract you. There were some bad days. Not many, but one in particular in which I was terribly lonely and irritable and longed for unconsciousness most of the time, but the good days far outweighed the bad. Liz visited twice, and both times were wonderful. She got sunburnt and I didn't. We walked and talked and had very good silences. She is very good to talk to and be silent with. She has me on an introductory diet of Ani DiFranco, and I am digging thirty two flavours but not Gravel with makes my head hurt, and I have not made up my mind about her yet. The Ani DiFranco was mixed with some very good Dylan and Marley, and some of my favorite songs and she brought me it all on a CD which was like hard drugs for me, after a solid week of limited music. My parents bought Liz the tackiest keychain ever, and I am not sure whether to give it to her or bury it and buy her something else and pretend it is from Hawaii (probably the former considering she reads this). Anyway, I am looking forward to continuing the book where I left off, and I might get a job now or continue being unemployed and writing and living off of other people like the unpleasant leech I am. I will write much more tomorrow or something, because I am home and enjoy writing in blogs. Is it wrong that I crave a cigarette when I don't smoke?

      1. After High School I come into some money (see daydream #4) and decide after a long argument with my parents that I am going backpacking through Southeast Asia. Mes amigos come with me (the ones who have graduated...Ha!) and we travel on crowded buses filled with odd smelling people and lots of chickens, and sleep in barely sanitary hotels, but we live on 10$ each a day, and so we are able to travel around almost indefinitely until we find a warm whitesanded thai beach where we can chill for a year or so.  2. My dreadlocks lock up and grow down to my shoulders in a matter of days.  3. At the next coffeehouse Pete and I, and maybe Nate on da bass, we all go onstage. There is a short witty monologue as we tune up and the techies fix the mics, and then of coure we say " There should probably be some audience participation for this one, it will become clear what you should do." and then we burst into Get up Stand up by Marley, and I'm singing and Nate is bassing, and Pete is playing guitar and actually -adding- bluesy lead stuff, and the whole crowd bursts into rioting and singing along and we are signed on the spot by bigshot executive record producers.  4. I finish my book and edit it, and by November or December I have the pretty much finished product in my hands and maybe one or two people have read it and told me they liked it. So I send it off to a couple of publishers, and get a few call backs (all in the span of an afternoon). And so I get an agent to help me negotiate it all, but suddenly the publishers are offering more and more money because they are competing with each other for my book! Eventually I sign on with, hrmmm, HarperCollins or some such place, and my contract gives me a ridiculous sum (200,000) as an advance, and offers me the same advance for two more books 'in the same style' and so I sign up and roll in sweet sweet cash, and am a literary superstar within weeks and J.K. Rowling keeps trying to hang with me, but I keep blowing her off and not returning her calls cause she's lame compared to me. (I think maybe this fantasy doesn't show the best parts of my characters)  5. A bunch of mes amigos who play instruments, we all get together maybe at Deleavey's dad's studio, or around a computer that has a copy of GarageBand, and record some stuff, some of my songs and maybe some random jams that we come up with.  6. I am out at the cottage and reading a ton but not able to write because I am away from the computer and I get a call in the morning and it's Liz and she says the whole crew (cru?) are coming out in like, 20 minutes to chill out at the beach, and so people do come out and we chill at the beach and all is groovy.  7.  I win most perfect enlightenment meditating one day, and laugh because people spend countless lifetimes trying and it just  happened  to me. And so then I demand people adress me as "Rightly Self-Awakened" and " Arahant" and "Tathagata", and run around the world as a perfect crazy saint and help all kinds of other people to become awakened, and then pass into parinibbana.  8. *censored*  9. #3, except that it's done on the middle of Main Street as a protest and we all get arrested and each of us resists arrest and they have to beat us with nightsticks and eventually all of Moncton erupts into a riot.  10. I make a meagre living teaching meditation retreats.  11. Other depressed friends and I share a too-small cold water flat in Dublin, Ireland, where we are great writers and walk the same streets where Joyce and Wilde did, and take black and white photographs of ourselves and the city to send back home, and we are starving artists in an unwelcome city.
