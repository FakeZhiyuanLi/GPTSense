						   I think the hardest part of starting a business is figuring out the time slots for everything that needs my immediate attention.  Having Systemic Lupus as well as Rhuematoid Arthritis, Sjogren Syndrome, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, just to name a few of the most active diseases, just getting up sometimes and finding the strength to do the normal day to day chores is hard.  My disease is actually a blessing because it has taught me the most important reasons for living.  My children, my husband, my family and helping others.  When I worked as a Cost Accountant it became all about my job and making money to the point where I became a work-a-holic.  Then I got sick and after many different doctors and many different diagnosis that didn't make any sense I was finally diagnosed.  It's a lot better knowing what you're dealing with cause I believe that "Knowdlege is Power", it gives you the ammunition to fight and it also helps you to know your limits.  Working from home was and is the only option that I was given, but it also allowed me to nurture my children and provide them with the necessary guidance that each one needs.  It is important when you have a chronic disease that you have a very strong support system, a family that understands your limitations and helps when they see that you need a hand.  My faith in God is also very important and it is the one substance in my life that helps me to persevere and allows me to realize that I can't do everything that I want when I want and it's okay.  My relationship with God is what helps me weather any storm that hits without notice and helps me to stay calm while always walking in faith that things will get better and yes, there is always a light at the end of any dark tunnel and a silver lining behind every dark cloud.  I've taken on the challenge of running various businesses from selling designer clothes and bags to catering desserts to selling my hand made crafts and now web design and web development.  Everything has to be done in an even pace and running a business though important is squeezed in during the normal course of the day.  As much as my husband hates the amount of time I spend on the computer, he is actually the one who will step in and help me solve programming and scripting issues when I through my hands up in the air.  However, through the past couple of years, I have sat down with myself and though it is important to help others, it is also important that I take care of my business and manage my time on the computer to create a balance that helps me fulfill my duties as a wife, mother and business woman.  It took a few years to get to this frame of mind, but it has given me much clarity and when there are scripts or programs that can't be solved I no longer work tenaciously like a pitbull until I solve the problem.  I am now at a point where I have used my experience of dealing with my chronic disease of knowing my limits and using that technique with my internet business.  A work-a-holic I'll always be but it's also nice to say "I've done all I can today" and not worry about it.  I have dealt with much turmoil and chaos since being diagnosed with Systemic Lupus, but with my constant walk with faith and a very strong support system as well as the belief that I can aspire to help with finances and balance my duty as wife and mother anything is possible and I know it's not just another pipe dream.
