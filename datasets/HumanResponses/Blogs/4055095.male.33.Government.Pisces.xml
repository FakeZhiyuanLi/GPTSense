        Hmmm, after thinking about this whole blog thing, I realized the similarities between the relationship of our lives with the internet and the Borg from Star Trek: TNG.  The internet is this big storage compartment of facts, news, ideas, opinions and so much more.  And with the advent of the blog, it's now become this depository of people's thoughts.  So is the internet becoming a collective brain for the entire world?       If I need to know something, I go to the internet.  I usually Google it.  Not too long ago, if you needed to know, say, the weather, you had to wait until the 10 o'clock news came on (or look out the window).  Of course, the Weather Channel changed that, kind of.  You still had to wait until they displayed the weather you were interested in, but it was better, nonetheless.  Now with the internet, I can find out the weather instantly.  The same thing applies to other info like phone numbers, addresses, driving directions, news, whatever.  The internet has provided this collective area to find all this info.       Now, think about personal computing devices and where we're headed with them.  I personally use a PDA on a daily basis.  It was a godsend for helping me remember stuff for work.  My PDA doesn't have wireless capability, though.  I didn't have any use for it and didn't want to shell out the extra money for it.  But all of the newest PDA's automatically come with wireless capabilities whether you want them or not.  So you can surf the internet anywhere, provided you can find a WiFi hot spot.  You can have access to this collective of information at any time.       I'm sure personal computing devices will continue to change and adapt to our needs.  With that said, is it too much of a stretch to think of everyone in the world who has access to this seemingly infinite brain (the internet), sharing their thoughts and ideas and experiences, so they all, in essence are sharing the same big life or same big brain?  Sort of brings us all together doesn't it?  Gives more meaning to the idea that we are all part of the same whole.  Which is why I compare the idea to the Borg.  They are many parts of a greater consciousness.  All of their thoughts are one.  No, I don't expect us to all lose our identities and individual thoughts.  But it is interesting that we can all converge in this one cyberspace.

        Here's the maiden voyage of my blog.  I've heard of blogs for awhile now, but really haven't looked too much into what they were.  Of course, I'm always interested in reading other people's random thoughts.  So why shouldn't I share all the mundane crap that goes on in my life as well?       Work went well today.  Lots to do and not enough time to do it in.  We have 2 people out of the office, so we're short handed.  But we're not hurting.  I work in the County Clerk's Office and we're currently looking at changing the way we archive records.  For decades, we've used microfilm.  That's worked just fine except that our microfilm camera is as old as the hills and we are in desperate need of a new system.  So rather than buy a new microfilm camera, we're going to start living in the 21st century and switch to "imaging".  We'll be scanning the documents that are filed with us and storing them as digital images on the computer.  I am so excited because I'm a total computer nerd and this is right up my alley.       I've been experimenting with a scanning system for the past week and although it's simplistic in comparison to other systems that are out there, I am very impressed with the image quality and potential for what we can do with these scanned images.  Right now, if you come into my office and ask for a copy of a document, we have to make a copy from microfilm and it may not look that great because the filmer might not have checked it that well.  Or the microfilm may show some aging.  But digital images will never degrade!  Plus I can make you a copy of a document without getting my backside up out of my chair!  :)  Am I lazy?       Another benefit from going to digital imaging is the storage room we can reclaim.  Right now, our office is overrun with huge books from the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Then we have many cabinets full of microfilm.  If we can convert all that (eventually) to digital images, we'd have more room for the new cases that are filed with us.       Upon coming home from a nice, busy day at the office, I was greeted by an almost paved road.  The County is working to have our road repaved and buddy, it needed it!  It's had so many potholes for years.  They'd usually just come out and patch them up.  And we all know what happens to a patch job on a road.  It lasts what, two months tops?  At any rate, we're finally getting a brand new re-surfaced road.  Yay!       I also received a message that a friend of mine had her appendix removed today.  Apparently she began hurting yesterday (on her birthday of all days).  She went to a hospital in a city that I know nothing about.  I'd like to go see her, but I'm afraid I'll get lost.  She's supposed to get out tomorrow night, so I don't feel so bad about not seeing her.  I'll check with her when she gets back.  Poor girl.  She's had more bad luck with health.  First she was diagnosed with Crone's Disease, then just recently got over a bout with Pneumonia and then some bronchial problem and now she's gotta deal with this.  Good grief!  I'd certainly understand if she were to get depressed.  I know I would be.  But she still keeps going!  I'm glad she has the will power to keep going.

        The walls are thin in the apartment complex that I live in.  They're not too bad, but sometimes I can hear my neighbor's TV and one night he kept me awake until 2:00 am having a party.  He was unresponsive to my beats on the wall.  My neighbor is relatively new (less than 6 months).  He acts as if he's the only person living in the building.  He always seems to wake me up somehow, whether it's talking on his cell phone right outside my bedroom window or having his friend pick him up at 5:00 am and they honk their horn to announce their arrival.      This evening I heard the typical "TV noise" coming from next door again.  But this time, it sounded louder than usual.  So I couldn't resist.  I had to see what this guy could be watching so loudly over there.  I did it.  I stuck my ear to the wall.  But I quickly realized that I wasn't listening to his TV.  I was listening to him berating his son.  When you live in an apartment, you kind of gather how your neighbors' lives work just by seeing them come and go on a daily basis.  Although I don't know him personally and have never spoken to him (wouldn't want to anyway, the jerk), I've gathered that he's probably divorced and gets custody of his son periodically.  I've seen them coming back from the swimming pool and getting in to his truck.  His son looks about three or four years old.      As I listened to him I realized that his son was crying.  Then it sounded like the guy was mocking his son.  He kept asking him something, maybe he was asking his son why he was crying.  I heard the boy say something unintelligible and then the guy said something like "I didn't call you a girl, I said you were acting like one".  There were some words said that I couldn't quite make out.  Then I heard the boy crying pretty hard, in that sort of scream/cry that small children do when they're upset.  He was crying out "daddy" over and over again.  I have no idea if the guy was hurting his child physically, but I certainly don't approve of the verbal abuse I heard.  Some people may not think anything of it, but I think verbal abuse (no matter how mild) is just as bad as physical abuse.      I didn't like the idea that he was telling his son he was acting like a girl.  Being a gay man and growing up in a society, religion and town that pressured me to hide who I was makes me especially mad when I hear fathers calling their sons names because they might be doing something that they find feminine.  Besides, what's so feminine about crying for God's sake?  He's a child!  That's what children do (and newsflash... that's was mature adults do) when they're upset.      Right after I heard the boy calling out "daddy" over and over again, my phone rang and it was my sister.  I unloaded on her (lucky her) and she gave me some reassuring advice.  She's a nurse and said she's had to call Child Protective Services on many people when she sees certain circumstances in her hospital.  I don't know if I should call CPS or not.  I'm going to wait because I have no proof that anything happened other than the child was upset.  Maybe the boy was cranky and tired and they weren't getting along with each other.  I know I've gotten upset with my nephew when he was really young and wouldn't stop crying (of course I didn't call him names).  It's only natural to lose your cool sometimes, but I didn't like the way the guy seemed to be mocking his son.  Doesn't he realize that children look up to their parents and copy everything they do?  I catch my nephew trying to do everything I do and everything his mom and dad does.  That's why we have to try to be good examples for him so he hopefully won't develop the same bad habits that we have.  I realize I can't save everybody and that verbal and physical abuse go on daily.  But it makes me sick to think about it.  This guy has no business having a child.  I won't even go into the fact that the guy is basically a child himself.  He's still immature.  He has friends over late on the weekends and they drink and are generally loud.  He'll come home at 4:00 in the morning sometimes.  This was probably an unwanted pregnancy and now he feels trapped in this situation and maybe feels resentment toward the child.      I'm going to keep an eye and an ear out and if I have to call CPS, I guess I'll have to call them.  I just didn't want to be the nosy neighbor who won't mind his own business.  But a child's well being may depend on it.

        Well then, just this past Thursday in my office (remember I work in our local County Clerk's Office), we had a man come in who was wanting help with his property.  We're familiar with the man.  He comes in periodically and gets copies of his Service Discharge.  I don't know what he does with all those copies, we simply indulge him.  You can tell that he has some sort of mental condition.  Perhaps he was in a war and has mental damage from having to cope with it or something like that.  Who knows?  You can just tell, usually, which customers have mental disorders once they begin talking to you.  We don't treat these people any differently.  We try to help them the best we can, but a few of them are too far away from reality, haven't been taking their medication, or maybe haven't been fortunate enough to be able to seek medical help for their condition.  I don't feel we should fear people who are like this because I think it could happen to anybody and I wouldn't want people treating me badly because I wasn't making sense.  I feel like we should treat them with as much respect as possible, but there are lines that can be crossed.      Back to the man who was asking for help with his property...  Everyone in the office noticed he was being much more "wordy" than he usually is.  He usually says very, very little.  But then again, we always know what he's coming after (his Service Discharge), so he doesn't need to say anything except for how many copies he wants.  The girl who was helping him seemed to be trying to find what he needed, but she wasn't doing exactly what he wanted.  After he walked out, obviously agitated, the girl told us what had happened.  She said that he was complaining that the co-owner of his property was trying to take the property away from him and he needed to know how to get the co-owner's name off of the deed.  Well, our default answer for that question is "you need to seek legal advice from an attorney".  The County Clerk's Office is not there for legal advice and to explain what documents mean or how to go about transferring titles, etc.  The County Clerk's Office is essentially the library for the County.  We store things and keep records and can retrieve what you need if you tell us what you're looking for.  But people expect us to know all about property transactions and Probate proceedings.  And they expect us to be able to explain all the ins and outs about how they work, etc.  We know the things that pertain to our office and that's it.  If we knew all the other extra stuff, then we'd be freakin' attorneys for God's sake.  But you don't see us charging people $150 an hour while they're standing at our counter wanting service.      The man didn't like the "you need to talk to an attorney" answer.  He also proceeded to tell the clerk about some incident where the police came into his home.  He was mad about that and I guess wanted her to do something about that as well.  When she couldn't help him, he said "then you're going to get shot" and left.      We were on edge for the rest of the day wondering if this man was going to come back into our office with a gun.  We've actually had another man who has a mental disorder come up to our office with a gun and was caught outside in the parking lot with it.  (That guy had a history of threatening people, but usually with stupid idol threats.)  Our courthouse security was on alert and we constantly had an officer within our sight.  Our bailiffs are outstanding for responding to problems and I am thankful that they're in the courthouse with us.      With that said, I wonder why our County spent all the money that it did on remodeling the courthouse and putting in extra security measures for the judges, yet didn't bother with remodeling our office and added no extra security measures for us other than installing a panic button.  Mind you, I'm thrilled about the panic button and as I've stated, our bailiffs are great at responding.  But the judges are locked away in rooms that require you to enter a code to open the door.  And in their courtrooms, they've had bulletproof shields installed on their benches so they can duck behind them if a defendant happens to bring a gun to court (or get a gun off of a bailiff).      I don't want to be locked away behind some door with a push-button lock.  We're supposed to be there for public service.  But what do we do if someone comes in with a gun?  We've discussed this in our office and asked each person what would they do.  Of course, you can never know exactly what your reaction will be if something like that happens (unless you've been trained, like law enforcement).  Perhaps we need to devise a plan in case something like that happens.  I've personally been in a threatening situation where a girl was attacked in my front yard at 2:00 a.m. and she came to my house for help.  I reacted in a completely different way than I thought I would.  I wasn't thinking clearly and was scared.      I'm not trying to diminish the potential threat to the judges.  I know they're the ones who dish out the punishment to criminals and who rule against people or take people's kids away from them.  So they really piss people off.  I completely understand why they would feel threatened.  I just feel like we clerks aren't taken seriously.  As if we don't matter.  We deal with the people.  And for the most part, the people are calm, cool and collected and we can help them with what they need.  But our door is also open to the person who's not in the best mental state.      I suppose there are no guarantees.  Perhaps I'm asking for too much.  After all, I'm not guaranteed to return home safely when I leave my home to go to Wal-Mart.  I could be hit by a drunk driver or someone could go ballistic in the store.  After a few weeks, the threatening incident will be pushed to the backs of our minds and we won't be so worried.  But when things like that happen, they make you stop and think about how easily we can lose the life we've been given.

        Stayed up til almost 2:00 a.m. this morning (I never stay up that late).  I went to my sister's house and watched a movie with her, her husband and our nephew (who was in town visiting a friend).  We watched "Go" again.  My sister loves that movie.      Ever woke up and felt like someone has beaten the crap out of you?  That's the way I've been feeling the past couple of mornings.  I've slept really hard and probably didn't move an inch all night long.  But then when I wake up in the morning, I feel all haggard like I could probably sleep some more.  Yet I can't go back to sleep.  So off I go in inject my body with Starbucks Breakfast Blend.      After getting out of bed, I decided to pay a couple of bills and get those out of the way.  Rent's due today, but since it's Sunday, I won't get it to them until tomorrow.  I'm now paying all of my bills online, with the exception of one.  It's such a breeze.  And I no longer have to worry about whether or not our wonderful postal service will get my payments to their appropriate destinations.  I don't mean to knock the U.S. post office because considering the sheer amount of mail they handle daily and the low cost of mailing a letter, overall they do a great job.  But I've been screwed one too many times by the postal service to warrant my distrust.  The only bill I can't pay online is my car payment and that sucks.  Bank One won't allow me to do online payments unless I have a checking account with them.  Whatever.      After paying those two bills, I was a little surprised to see my checking account getting kinda low.  I'm not saying I'm rich or anything because I definitely am not.  But I like to keep a little bit of a "padding" in my checking account, just in case.  Not too much, just a few hundred extra dollars.  (I was able to do this by cashing in my 401k when I quit a previous job.  I was young, what did I know about 401k's?)  I think I've indulged a bit too much now.  My padding is slowly wearing away!  It's making me think hard about whether I really need to be paying $24.00 a month for Netflix.  Once you get used to living with certain luxuries, it's hard to go back.  You begin to feel as though you need them and can't live without them.  I've forgotten what it is like to live without broadband internet or movies being mailed to me.  I've become spoiled (or more spoiled than what I was).
