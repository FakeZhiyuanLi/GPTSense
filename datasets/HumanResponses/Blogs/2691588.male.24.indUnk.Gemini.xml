        What's Up?    Finished the next section of the indoor wall today, it's so sweet, 45 degrees with nice long moves and good opportunities for sweet footwork. I love the feeling of tension on problems around the 45degree angle, the dynamic stab for the two finger jug with the right hand, while trying to keep your right big toe curled around the starting hold. It's a really great feeling, abs tensed, your hand slipping ever so little and then, boom, your foot pops and you swing out, back arched, holding on for dear life, and at the apex you get that weightless feeling for a fleeting second before your hand pops of and you fly to the mat. It reminds me of The Spectre in the buttermilks, so i'll leave you with a picture of Fredrique Nicole sticking the move i'm thinking of, he makes it look easy (the bastard!) Someday soon.....

       These long, drawn out hours.    Daydreams of razor crimps made more real through their inability to be reached.        Cold blustery wind, icy walks      and nothing but the plastic of the chalk strewn cave      to ease an unsettled mind.         Where is the enlightenment in this?        Looking forward ;the present becomes skewed,    drowned in forgotten dreams of insubstantial meaning.

        More inspiration, less filling    Wanna' crank harder? Left behind in the scene full of sponsor-stroking first ascents full of V-hard grades? Where's the inspiration behind the numbers? Feel the rock; the all encompassing energy which creates all things. You are one with the ages, your movement is the movement of the continents, ever-changing dynamic expression of the universal consciousness. Feel the flow between body-length flings, feet cut loose, back arching in the expression of animal's joy, the joy of life, of capability, of unencumbered movement towards no particular goal.  Forget the numbers and focus on the process, the flow of energy creating endless possibilities upon stones no taller than you. No summit bids or first ascents to multi-pitch choss piles, only the drive towards oneness encompassed in the space between the ground and the transcendent top-out. Forget the numbers, those chains holding you to imagined constraints. Cut the chains and rise above the fray into a new future with no limits . cut the chains.....

          DREAMTIME      I should have included this picture for the link for like a dream, being as this was the first V15 boulder problem in the world. It's called Dreamtime, and it's one of the most beautiful pieces of stone to ever be deposited in a glaciated European valley. Check out  urlLink Dreamtime  it's an excellent example of the cutting edge climbing going on in the world today.

          Today's shallow thoughts       I resoled my  urlLink Bufo Fly's  today, and i've now decided to definately get them professionally done next time. This is my third climbing shoe resole, and though they will definately work just fine the way they are, it really pisses me off to do an unprofessional job on them. They look so ghetto.    Of course now I want a new pair. The  urlLink Mad Rock Loco's  look so frickin' sweet. But hopefully I can resist until the summer time, when the side jobs abound the money flows like...., well not really like wine, but more like slightly warm molasses.    The next road trip plan is to the  urlLink  New River Gorge , which should be so frickin' sweet. 100ft. Nuttall sandstone cliffs, 1500 routes and the awesome gorge exposure.  urlLink Like a dream come true     So until next time, keep your head in the clouds and your hands on the crimps. And remember, if the protection is bomber, punch it like there's no tomorrow, because who knows if there will be.       Keep Climbing!!!

      Sidartha Guatama "Life is suffering" Yvon Chouinard "Bouldering is instant suffering"   First day of my new Principles of Management class today, so I decide to go early enough to get in some time on my numerous new projects at the Moorman boulders. Various slapping about and thrashing wildly is followed by the realization of a sweet line up the main boulder next to the river. After a few tries, I figure out what I think is the crux, and I hike above the 10 foot overhang in short order. High step with my right foot and lock off on the sweet jug with my left hand and reach far over the lip to holds made in heaven. Then suddenly, my right foot slips off, torquing my shoulder and sends me butt first only to land on the ground mere inches from my pad. As I lay in the dirt assesing damage, I wonder what sort of person it takes to actually enjoy an event of this nature. I just busted my ass, partially separated my shoulder, and to top it off, now I have to go to my class with mud all over my ass (yes I forgot to bring a change of pants), yet I cant stop smiling. And it's not even that I enjoyed the process so much as that I  was able to realize most of my mistakes in this case. I guess that's one thing that I can get from bouldering in short order; a long running list of possiblities for improvement. It's almost like a mother-in-law or an all too honest mirror. As much as you'd like to ignore the constant nagging, you just can't help but take a look every once in a while.

          ALL CONSUMING DREAMS OF IMAGINED GLORY         between hallowed halls of perception and reality   lies all consuming dreams of imagined glory    standing atop the miniature summit    no cheers    no crowd    no sound     only that which truly exists      feel the fleeting breeze upon my face        smell the substance of subteranean cycles      remember non-existent memories afloat in the ethereal realm of subconscious existence         slowly this state ebbs away reality to be sought again through imagined glory........

      TALES OF NORTH CONWAY....  Dreaming of granite, splitter cracks, attacking with rattly fingers over manky psychological pro. Hit the roof, taped hands slipping, searching for purchase, swing one foot over the lip, left hand slips, as I fall, off-hands jam with right save me from 65ft onto soft iron. Plug in the TCU, say a short prayer, and dive into the 150ft. of slab, 30ft. runouts over 1/4" bolts, the gods must be crazy. There's no holds here, my mind screams as I regulate my breathing to stop my legs from shaking off of potatoe chip flakes. Movement as slow as shifting continents, singular focus clip a screamer in to the last bolt before the 45 foot runout to the anchors, movement becomes a blur, clip the hangers and relax, you've finally truly lived.

        Mad Style/ the Tao of The Campus.  If I could float like a butterfly, I would look like Sharma, feet swinging, I could campus edges smaller than the potatoe chips I would have eaten before my send,  The rules of gravity need not apply, swinging in the flow, soaring upward, hey feet: just rest a minute,   Dynamic, power in a lunge to nothing, sticking like velcro, but to what? No need for holds just give me vertical, and i'll make holds, i'll send swinging like a monkey on edges so small that mere mortals can't understand why one would even think this face possible. But the possible creates the impossible,   And so it must be discarded,   The moves must be outside of even my own perception, just dig deep into a well of energy and possiblities that I never knew existed.   Singular Focus  Launch  Stick  Mantel the slope, forget the landing.   Stand on top in ecstasy. The end.

      Check out Pilgrimage, the new film by Josh Lowell. It's full of sweet first ascents all over Hampi India by Chris Sharma, Katie Brown and Nate Gold, all mixed in with the philisophical slant that Sharma is famous for. Very enlightening video full of climbing shots that make your jaw drop and keep you on the edge of your seat. And now what am I gonna do? I'm all stoked and it's like 10:30 at night, no climbing to be had except in the basement. Hopefully it doesn't rain or snow tonight like the 70% chance would have me believe that it might, because I wanna check out my new load of projects tomorrow. That's what I need, more hard problems to occupy the time I don't have. The question sometimes becomes, climbing and beans, or work and fillet? I don't mind beans at all. Now my wife on the other hand..........

      Visited the Moormans boulders in Charlottesville today. Sweet, sweet, sweet. Just my style. Radically overhanging, featured faces with dynamic moves. The holds are like a fast food employees face, greasy. I couldn't climb two moves without mad slippage. Projects galore. Beautiful river runs right behind the main boulder, the silence was perfect. So peaceful. If you care enough to check them out, then hopefully you can find some beta and directions, because parking is scarce, and it's just one piece of litter away from access issues. So ha, ha, ha. Hope to see you there, or maybe not. Later.

      If I was a millionare I think I would own about fifty pairs of climbing shoes. And I wouldn't like any of them. I would just read ads in magazines and be instantly convinced that all the shoes I already had were crap. Then I would go into debt to buy just one more pair (I need them to send that new overhanging testpiece, you know). And when I got them i'd be like "WoW these are the best climbing shoes i've ever owned". But then two days later, i'd see another sweet ad with a picture of some guy with forearms the size of my thighs bouldering V28 in the new ultra-cambered, super sticky, velcro, turn your feet into hands as strong as Magnus Samuelsen, Overpriced rubber slippers, and I would actually fall for it. How lame.I finally sent my project on the huge boulder next to the Old Rag fire road, about 100 yds. from the Weakly hollow parking lot. I had been trying it for at least 6 months, climbing an hour here, 2 hours there. It's the sweet overhanging side facing the fire road. It starts from a good side-pull and two pad sloper. You then deadpoint with your left hand to a two finger crimp, while high stepping onto a slopey foothold with your right foot. You start working your left foot up and left under the overhang, and when you finally find that one positive edge you have to do a swinging deadpoint to a terribly sharp crimper at full spread eagle arm extension. You then have to work the lefthand crimp into a sidepull, and while saying a quick prayer, you have to put almost all of your weight on that slopey right foothold. If your foot slips, you fall onto your back into a mess of jagged rocks about the size of watermelons only to then flip over and land in a pile right in the middle of the fire road (real enticing). Then you have to quickly slap the sloping top in between the side pull and the sharp crimper, and then quickly grab a sweet jug with your right hand. Oh yeah, and then scream out loud. It was frickin' sweet. Enlightenment through top-out. See you in nirvana.

      Hey there, first day of the blog, one beginning in the midst of many. Hope to climb tomorrow,  and the next day and the next, but reality is such a bitter pill to swallow. Maybe i'll get an hour or two, even if it's only on the basment bouldering cave (okay, it's only a couple of sheets of plywood wide, but we're working on it). Check me out at http://stores.ebay.com/gearsightedoutdoorgear for all of the outdoor gear you need. Check me out for the outdoor gear you don't need also. I can even sell you something you don't want if that's what you're after. Either way i'm not really trying to make any money, just break even and get some free climbing gear if at all possible. If you live in the Central Va. area and ever need a climbing partner, email me at gearsighted@yahoo.com.  I climb at Old Rag, Harrisonburg area crags, Mcaffees Knob in Roanoke, and I even travel back to my hometown of Bristol to hit up Hidden Valley every once and awhile. Check ya' later.........

         Ah, a new day, a new post.     It's been a while, messing with a  urlLink webpage  in a vain effort for some sort of continuity. So fleeting, so, it's back to the old blog, where there is some semblance of order.   The Art of Movement.   how poetic. I hope it is more explanitory, I think it more correctly captures the meaning and purpose of my neverending quest through life; to find that all encompasing flow, whether it be on the rock or rail, to just let it be, and to be confident in my place in the universal order. So sit back and enjoy...

        Crushed by information    sometimes, crushed by information, breathes coming in labored gasps beneath the weight of the most dense of paragraphs, streaming media, pictures words and emoticons swirl into a dervish of overstimulation.    Stop!  The flow continues, a neverending scream of gibberish lined with meaningless promises, confused and determined.    So like lemmings we march. Cliffs towards mental sterilization accept us with open arms, there we lay nestled in the lap of the anti-enlightened, a smile indicating absolute stupor gracing our face.

       Vital Informatioin    Another day, another search, wading through the endless quagmire of useless information on the internet to bring you these excellent gems of shining brightness out of the dark abyss which is  the world wide web    First off is a link I was tipped off to by the Vbouldering magazine off of the  urlLink buildering.net  website. It's a cool little british site all about the king of all holds, the friendly butterdish, the impossible made possible, the sloper. It's called  urlLink  Fat Sloper Action  and it's infused with a good dose of that old fashioned british humor eg. Monty Python, with quite a bit of good sloper action thrown in for good measure.     Also on the docket is another link off of the buildering.net site called  urlLink  Urban Free Flow . It's all about the Parkour movement, which is basically freestyle running, with gap jumping, backflips and vaults off of rails thrown in to boot. I'ts funny, because i've always been into that kind of stuff, but just for the hell of it: but these guys do it as a way of life, and some of the tricks they pull are just downright sick, so you better check it out.    So there it is, my picks of the week, the sites I deem worthy of my time, as invaluable as it might be, so check them out or remain a wanker till' the end of time, like the  urlLink      Cybermen   . So until next time, watch out for those evil crimpers, and like the traceurs of the Parkour movement are fond of saying: urlLink  "The day all is flat, we will be dead"  . Take it easy!!!

      Finally getting organized. Lots of entries in my little notebook, freeing up my mind for more writing. Shouler still hurts, but not as bad as not jamming on Saturday. Possibility of rain dampens (lol) the prospects for outdoor PK, so the gyms might feel the wrath. Later.

      Man, oh Man, websites are a pain in the ass. The USA traceurs are trying to come up with an idea for a website for the PK USA. I was going to submit a template, but screw that, I don't really have the time to screw with it. I will submit a graphic for the banner though. It's the least that I can do, but otherwise, i'm just going to add a suggestion here and there and hope for the best.   Later!

           Le Parkour, The meaning of the art to me.      	 Forever searching, that's how i'd describe myself. I've always been looking for something, whatever it is doesn't fit into any description very well, but it amounts to enlightenment. The oneness between mind, body, spirit, and whatever there is that creates all of these aspects of everybody. I've been interested in martial arts and Eastern mysticism for a long time, and through the different methods and practices, have progressed along a path to where I am today. And that's where Parkour comes in.  	 The parallels between Le Parkour and the Eastern arts of spiritual enlightenment are obvious. The art is as close to Martial arts as it can be without actual fighting. The final outcome, in my mind, is akin to the "moving meditation" of Tai Chi, where action is accomplished without thought, where you become one with the flow, and mind, body and spirit meld together to react without any separation.   	 Almost everybody has felt this in a run. Where everything becomes quiet, and every movement becomes part of one large flowing action. There is no thought, only the feeling of weightlessness as, like water, you become soft and yielding and therefore overcome all opportunities in your path. This is the meaning of Le Parkour to me, moving meditation, yielding to the moment, becoming one with an eternal flow.   	 So in what ways can we more easily facilitate this oneness in our everyday existence and through every run? The three ways that I feel are most important are; Proper Nutrition, Proper training, and Meditation/Breathing.  	 Though I won't go into too many specifics here, proper nutrition is an understandable part of a complete whole. Without the right fuel for your body, you cannot perform at your maximum. Instead of obbsessing over this aspect or that aspect of your diet, it is better to make sure you have a little bit of everything, but never too much of any one thing. Thus a balance can be achieved that you can then transfer to both your runs and your everyday life.  	 Proper training is facilitated by figuring out your weaknesses and working them in a systematic manner. This can be harder than it sounds, considering that most people want to stick to things that they are good at. But through identifying your weaknesses, and creating a regimen that includes a proper warmup, some basic strengthening, sport specific training for your weakness, and a proper cool down and stretching, you become more prepared for any situation you may encounter throughout your life and your runs. Another important aspect of any training is using your mind to facilitate a connection with each movement. You then create a greater awareness of your body and its individual parts, thus gaining greater control over any movement.   	 Finally, there is Meditation and Breathing. I will be the first to admit that in a traditional context I am really bad at meditation. I find it immensely hard to sit still long enough to gain any stillness internally. I therefore am more apt to try to incorporate meditative states into my everyday life. The basic idea is the Buddhist concept of truly living in the moment, whereas each and every moment is sacred, and by quieting thoughts of both past and future, you still your mind to react to the present. An important aspect of this is proper breathing. Through deep diaphragmic breathing you facilitate the proper flow of energy throughout the body,  thus opening the mind to greater posibilities. After breathing correctly for a while, it becomes natural and you begin to incorporate it into your every day life, thus becoming closer to the flow at all times.   	I believe that these concepts can enhance the experience of Le Parkour for everybody, once you begin to release the constant chatter of your mind and start to let a well fueled and properly trained body react to the flow, then your movements become a long string of continuous energy, a moving meditation, a path to enlightenment.

       Feeling a good flow lately. An injury increasing the awareness of movement. Every step calculated.  Finally got the New York pictures up on  urlLink  Urban Freeflow  . Had quite a few that were pretty good, can't wait till the next jam to be able to take more.   Currently looking for spots for the Va. jam in the summer. Richmond looks promising, and i'm going to take some scouting shots tomorrow in Charlottesville. If I can find some spots that could handle quite a few people, it will be rad.

           Momentum....      	 	 I sit silently, crouched in the fire escape looking out across the skyline. This once great metropolis, now tarnished, smoke rising in plumes into the night sky. At one time the whole lot of it was nothing but an enormous playground for us, a land of opportunities providing those endless hours of escape from the monotony of everday life. But now....  	 The electric crackling from behind me is the only warning I get. I roll to the side as the electro-sentinel slams in to the railing where I was sitting a moment before. "Damn!!" I think, "Why did I let my gaurd down at this time of night!!".  	  The squads had been getting more frequent since the other traceurs and I had embarrased the Security Director the month before. It was beautiful, almost like the old days. He had stood there, proudly speaking the lies about the new world government, about the world of endless drudgery which they called the "New Way", the months and years of turmoil that had come after the war on terrorism had spawned the Un-American Acts sanction, which then grew to the World Convention. At first it was just open acts of defiance that they punished, people would disappear for months, only to show up in some mundane job with that same stoic look upon their face. But then they began to see other activities as potential threats. Luckily when they eventually made it to Le Parkour, the skills we had gathered allowed us to escape.  	  No time to think, I sidestepped the next lunging attack from the sentinel, and quickly reverse-vaulted the fire-escape railing, throwing a quick, accurate kick to throw the automaton temporarily off course. As I spun around I realised the immensity of the drop, 3 stories, no something to laugh at. In the years following our initial escape, the technology of our oppressors had advanced, and eventually even our extremely well-trained bodies were no match, so we had to follow suit. The thought-trode behind my ear registered the momentum, and through the hair-thin shiga-wire connection, adjusted the electro-viscous cushioning in my trainers. I took one deep cleansing breath and prepared for impact....  	 I hit the ground and fell into a perfect roll, arising in a sprint towards the far end of the alley. Tonight of all nights was the last time I would ever be caught alive, because it was the dawn of a momentus occasion: the first jam in nearly 15 years. For all that time we had been using our Parkour for evasion, for survival, but through their skills in urban exploration, some of the West-End traceurs had found an abandoned subway shaft, full of gaps, rails, precisions and walls. It was perfect, and for the first time in recent memory we'd be practicing our art purely for the enjoyment of it.  	  I could feel the electric field crackling behind me as my feet slapped pavement. A wall run over a sewer gap, a qick climb and a short run brought me to the 30 foot gap to the alley below. Without hesitation I hit the lip of the wall at full tilt, landed a precision on a dumpster, and arieled to the left to evade the ever-nearing pursuer. But then as I turned the next corner I realised my mistake, a dead end. "No obstacles, only opportunities" I thought, as I ran towards the wall. The sentinels tendrils grazed the back of my leg, and I felt the white-hot lance of pain from the electric pulsors. My heart was beating in my chest, but I just upped my cadence, concentrating on the sound of my feet and the asphalt. My legs were turning to jelly, burning with every stride, and the attacker was getting closer, closer. I could hear the "whish!" of a tendril in the air behind me as I took my first step onto the wall. Two more steps, feeling the proprietary sticky rubber gripping the brick, and I launched into a double-back. On my second rotation, I shot a glance at the wall below, only to see the sentinel come crashing full speed into the building, exploding into a shower of sparks, the explosion reverberating down the alley-way.   	  I landed in a deep crouch, and sat silently for a moment, catching my breath and listening for the sound of another sentinel amidst the industrial clatter of machinery. Nothing. So I slowly stood up, stretched my legs and bounded back down the alley towards the subway entrance. Tonight was gonna' be fun.....

       Virginia Jam, Saturday, May 8th-Richmond:Brown's Island Park....  	The second official Jump Va. jam in  took place in Brown's island Park in downtown Richmond next to the James River on Saturday May 8th. The week before left me with much anticipation leading up to the big day, being as that at least 2-3 people from Maryland were planning on attending, and there was a chance that there'd be 3-4 more (not counting myself) meeting us in the park. It was shaping up to be quite a memorable event!!  	Stix posted the directions, the headcount grew, and every day prior only brought more excitement. The time was finally set to meet at 1:30 at the main steps, and the plan was for the Maryland crew to crash at my place and partake in some of the PK action that's available around the tiny downtown area here in Orange.  	Friday afternoon was the start of a trend. Being that Brian, Eric, Steve and Kevin (yeah, the Maryland group grew to 4!!)  were planning on arriving around 7:30-8:00, and my wife and I still had a bit of cleaning to do around the house, I had planned on leaving work at the regular time (if not a bit early). But to my chagrin, at 2:00 my boss gives me a big list of mulch deliveries to make (which apparently he hadn't read) that end up taking almost 2 hours of overtime to complete.   	No worries, I thought. Since I get off at 3:30 normally, the 5:00 quitting time would still leave me ample time to nap and then finish up around the house before they arrived. Little did I know how right I was. Around 6:30, I was mowing the lawn, when I looked over my shoulder to see the entire sky turning an ominous black. Yes there is a silver lining to every cloud, and in this case it was the plethora of lightning that it produced.  I quickly finished my yard, and made way inside to catch the weather channel. As I turned the tv on *Pop*, there goes the power (how convenient). Finally after a minute or two, it returned, only to show me that there was a line of severe thunder storms basically riding right along I-95 where the guys would be driving. Damn.  	Now it's 10:00, and they still haven't shown up. I'm beginning to get worried. Did they just leave late? Did they have car trouble? Were they swept away by a tornadoe to a magical land filled with little people, whom they would teach the art of Le-Parkour and form a midget traceur army? Only time would tell.  	Finaly, 10:30, and they pull up outside. Due to a late start and plenty of traffic down 95 (hey, it's Friday) they just arrived a little later (two hours, hmmmm) than planned. We all had our introductions, then Emmie and Eric went to the store to pick up some grub for the next day. After watching Head Of State, the squabbling ensued over who would be lucky enough to procure the mattresses with the Bob The Builder sheets. Eric won that one out, and we all passed out dreaming of the crazy PK action that awaited us ahead.  	The morning found us arising at around 7:00 (or at least me), making some coffee, and shaking off the hazy morning fog. My son Miles walked into the living room only to find it full of grungy strangers, but luckily he knew Brian, so after a quick: "Oh... hey Brian...." he hurried back into our room to wait until Emmie woke up to brave the living room again. I made some pancakes and sausages (the breakfast of champions!!) and after letting our food settle for a moment while kicking it on the Magna-Doodle, we went outside to warm up with a bit of PDQ.  	Yes, I suck at PDQ, yet through the magic of video editing, I was able to include only one time with me getting beat, and one with me winning (which was the only time all day) into the video of the jam. After a few games and some general warming up in my front yard which included freaking out passing cars by pretending to jump on them from the wall, we headed up to the park to get the first of the days jamming in.  	Taylor park was perfect, the fountain was flowing and full of bubbles, the shade was (somewhat) cool, and there was just a general good vibe all around. Eric worked his 360 wall hops, and with my expert advice, came close enough to landing them that i'm sure that he got them down pat as soon as he was far away from my incessant chattering about technique. Steve showed us how to precision onto a twig, and Kevin practiced what I would call a B-twist wall hop/run (sorry, didn't get any good shots on video!!). Brian finally got the 360, and then stepped it up a notch with the precision to bubble blow (yeah!!!).  	We then moved just a short distance up the path to the memorial wall which offers a good quick climbing opportunity followed by a pretty high vault onto pea gravel. Eric, Brian and I decided that a three way climb/vault would be cool on video and we were spurred along by the prospect of having the cops called on us by an old lady at the church at the top of the wall who said "i'm just checking on my VALUABLE wall", yeah we got the hint....so we quickly shot the sequence, and booked it back to the fountain area to put together a couple of runs before heading back to the house to rest before the drive to Richmond.  	It's always nice to sit in the car for an hour and a half after doing PK, really makes for a good warm-up for the rest of the day. We were running late, so when we took 3rd street only two blocks before it detoured we got a little worried. After a convoluted drive through downtow Richmond, we arrived at the parking area at Brown's Island Park at about 2:15 and quickly hobbled down the path towards what I thought were the "main steps".  "Hmmmm, where's Stix?" we asked as we walked around the area, thinking to ourselves that we were in the wrong place. All I knew of him was from his video, so everybody who even vaguely resembled the kid in the footage, we started yelling at "STIIIIIIXXXX!!!!, STIIIIXXXX!!! PEEEEE KAAAAAY!!!" nope, no go, so, figuring that we just picked the wrong steps we made our way towards the Canal Walk, our eyes peeled for anyone remotely resembling Stix.   	Well, here we were about thirty minutes later, and Stix was nowhere to be found. We decided that the best way to draw attention to ourselves was just to start jamming, so we hit up the gravel filled steps at the end of the bridge. I landed some of the longest precisions i've gotten to date (probably around 12 feet with a 3 foot drop!!) and Kevin showed us how it was done by one foot precisioning down the whole set!! We then moved back to the Civil War Memorial area, where there was some sort of "Battle of The Bands" going on. The crowd was packing in, and the front door of the place was surrounded by tons of people, so we said "What better place to display our talents!!". We started off with a little hacky sack, then moved on to the PDQ all the while enjoying the awesome shade and hitting up the obstacles around us. The crowd was getting a kick out of our antics, Steve and I pulled off tandem front flips off the wall, I was nailing my ariels, and Eric and I tore it up on the 10-12 foot concrete wall behind the port-o-john's. Our show was inspiring enough to create some imitators, there were some kids jumping the bush gap, and a guy who ran to the concrete wall to show his girlfriend how easy the climb was only to be shut down. Oh yeah, score one for the traceurs!!!  	We had seen a promising spot on the canal walk when we left the gravel steps, so we walked back down the path towards the river. The area wasn't as "PK friendly" as it had originally seemed, but we still had fun with the vault-over to stall over the river (oooh scary!!) and the vault-over to "Frosti" gap over the river to the platform (luckily, unlike the gap's namesake, no one fell in). We rested for awhile under the big bridge across from the train tracks, the shade was perfect and there was the most heavenly of cool breezes blowing down the path. A train passed by giving the kids something to get excited about, and Miles and Kevin ran off to catch it before we left to go back to the back side of the Civil War Memorial building.   	The area was cool, with opportunities for many various techniques, including our 4-way picnic table vaulting, and some nice long runs. We decided to shoot a "Where's Stix?" run sequence which was tons of fun, but as the day was growing hotter and the water was running low (I left the spare gallon in the car), the troops were gradually dropping off. Between every shot, i'd look back to see Steve layed out in the shade, and by the time we finally finished the sequence, the arrival of a security gaurd announced the time to leave. We made our way back to the cars, chugged the gallon of water, weaved our way back through the downtown area (only one wrong turn, doh!!) and we were back on the road, myself and my family heading back to Orange, and the Maryland crew booking it back to there respective colleges.   	I have to say the jam was tons of fun, I made some new friends, learned some new techniques, showed off to a crowd of cute highschool girls and had the best Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich ever on the way home. When I got back I gracefully passed out on the couch, with images of the day's events spinning in my head. Though we never met up with Stix (for which we felt pretty bad considering he was the one who turned us on to the area), the jam in my mind was still a success, no major injuries, lot's of sweet flow, and some gutter Japanese thrown in just for kicks. Thanks to everybody who made it possible:Brian (computer geek extrordinaire), Eric (the soon to be 360 wall hop master), Steve (who further strengthened the relationship between physics and Parkour), Kevin (who can jam with the best Neandertals around) and of course Emmie and the kids who filmed most of the day and didn't complain a bit. Thanks a lot, and until the next jam, Keep up the flow, and PK for life!!! :] :] :x (oooooh nooooo!!!!)

        JumpVA July Jam Write Up       Thanks to all for coming  here ya' go.....  JumpVa Jam, July 9th and 10th....  So, what is a PK jam? Is it only the Parkour that makes it great, or is there something else inherent in the shared dynamic of the group? This last weekends jam posed these questions to me, and I think that i've found at least a few answers.  For weeks I had been in anticipation, but the immediacy of the situation didn't truly hit until about 2 weeks before the big weekend. I fully realized then the work that had to be done around the house to make it possible to keep that many people. So, let the work begin...  Fast forward to Thursday, July 8th. I've taken off of work to finish the cleaning and do some plumbing work upstairs. OK, so I was actually just starting the cleaning, but don't sweat the details. So, in a mad dash, Emmie starts packing Goodwill boxes, while I set off to replace the wax gasket on the upstairs toilet. Two gaskets, one flush valve, two main-line valves, 4 connection hoses, 5 separate trips to the hardware store and 6 hours later, the toilet is done. Yes, I said 6 hours. Turns out that when the last person to own your house is a plumber, you usually have bigger plumbing problems than you originally imagine.  OK, now it's Friday. We still have some trips to make to the dump, and mopping, sweeping, cleaning etc. work upstairs. Up at 5:30, two cups of coffee, get to it. The day disappears in a haze of dust bunnies and ammonia fumes, and I get just enough time to lay down and shut my eyes before I have to head up to Fredericksburg to pick up DJ Hangman from the train station.  OK, so I could have sworn that the email said 3:40. It is now 4:55, and no passenger train in sight. Despite the heat, I decide to hit up the area around the train station, which features a plethora of rails and drops, and before I know it, I am dripping with sweat, which has ceased to impress the women on the platform. I eat a snack, and begin to wonder why they repeat the, "Due to CSF regulations, some passenger trains may be delayed up to 15 minutes" message over and over. Do they figure that if they say it 4 times then it must just mean an hour delay? The train finally arrives, and since I can't remember what Hangman looks like, I just start to vault the rails so that he'll know who I am.  Back to Orange, quickly changing, grabbing a snack, drinking some water, and making introductions to the family, and we're off, once again back to Fredericksburg. We get to the gym almost on time, and walk in to see the whole crew already in full swing. I run to the shoe cubbies, and begin to take off my shoes yelling "PK For Life!!", which is followed by a "And everybody else, GO Shove IT!! " from the floor. Yes, PKUSA has arrived in Virginia. With a tall mat-stack set up already, I add a small obstacle to the middle and create a short run, which we start to session like mad. Too many techniques to mention went down, but of note, was the 14 foot gap from low to high that was cleared by all, and the cheer squad we had the pleasure of standing on the sidelines, routing us on.  After a few techs into the foam pit, including a gainer full-twist by Eric, we decide to set up some pads against the far wall to practice wall flips and the like. I quickly follow the curse by jamming my toe hard on a failed wall spin, which then decides to swell and not let me walk. I concede to the camera, and try my best to capture some cool progressions on film. Steve nailed the forward wall flip, and huge vertical wall runs were had by all. Though I got most of the wall techniques on still shots, my 4 year old daughter, Cassidy, did a pretty good job capturing the majority on film (no, i'm not kidding). By the time we were done with the wall, time was winding down, and we all tried to cool off and stretch, while watching the huge group of mini-traceurs we had inspired take to the wall and start laying down techniques of their own. We all grabbed something to eat, and then headed back to Orange. When we got there, we had to sort out the sleeping arrangements, make the introductions and then try to chill out and get some sleep for the following day.  OK, up at 6:45, and off to start the home-made biscuits. Once they were done, Akh Horus and I shot to the store to hook up some fresh fruit, and when we returned, I started jamming the Gift Of Gab album as a wake up call. Everybody ate well, and we departed for Charlottesville. Malfunctioning hyper-drive aside, the drive went well, and we arrived at the garage on time, only to lose Baram. Though we worried for a moment, he soon showed up, and the jamming began.  Akh shot up the stair-side wall for a second shot at the grab, getting it on his first go. Lots of sessioning was done on the multi-level rails, with Baram Shin showing mad flow with his link-ups. The trimming of a few shrubs had created a new cat leap from a run up hill, and it was sessioned to death. Everybody landed it perfectly, and I got tons of great action shots. We were shut down in the middle of the 9 foot precision by the restaurant owner, whom we politely apologized to, only to have him call the cops. The officer was cool, though, telling us that nothing we were doing was illegal, though we would have to stay off of the restaurant property. We decided to film some runs, and film some runs we did, with both Eric and Matt representing with the mad balancing skills, and Akh and Baram flowing like mad through the rail area of the parking complex. On our second set of shots, though, fate hit like a bad tsunami, with Akh clipping his foot and falling face first from 6 feet to the brick. A collective "oooohhh" was heard from around the group, but after a bit of clean up (yea! WFR represent!!) Mr. Horus was back to jamming at full force. M2 and Stix showed up a bit later, and after a minute or two more around the rails, we decided to hop up the road to the library/historical society for some more action.  The Library offers some awesome opportunities for runs, and runs were had by all, with Tor heading to the roof right off, and Akh nailing the precision across the steps. Albinoboy stepped up and flowed through the link-ups down the hill, and Eric, M2, and Hangman set to the buildering traverse. Then a true gem was found on the other side of the roof, in the form of a walled garden, with rails, gaps, and walls for their PK enjoyment. So, of course, Dom decided to start right off with a huge drop to a small landing next to a tree. He landed it without a roll, and Eric stepped up next, only to be shut down by the arrival of our next police officer of the day. Once again, he was quite nice, only telling us that the proprietor of the historical society building didn't want us jumping off of her property. Being that the sentiment is quite understandable, we politely left without argument, and headed to Whole Foods for the Mac-PK lunch of champions; fresh fruit, sushi, and organic soda.  Next off we traveled to UVA, but unfortunately before much PK could go down it started to rain. So, we decided to teach M2 PDQ, and played a game or 20 under the trees in the rain, quite fun. After a while we knew the day in Charlottesville was over, so we gathered our things, said our farewells to those who weren't following along, and headed off back to Orange.  We only lost Baram twice and Albinoboy's caravan once, so i'd say the trip back was a smashing success. When we arrived back in town, I decided to give up the limping for the day, so I stayed at the house with a few others to ice and ibuprofen, while the remainder of the group headed up town to sample the great lines my little town has to offer. When they all got back, we ordered some pizza's, checked out some of the footage from the last two days, and chowed down before the group hit the road again. DJ Hangman stayed the night, we checked out "Stuck on You" and laughed our asses off, before passing out from exhaustion. The next day I took him back to the train station, wished him good luck on his trip back, and thanked him for coming. On the way home I had a 7-11 clerk tell me company policy was to call the police on those who wish to pay with a check, even though there isn't a "No Checks" notice on the pumps. While writing a personal check to a guy nice enough to pay for my gas with his credit card, I thought back over the weekend and this perfect ending.  It's funny, I had planned the jam for a long time, had been waiting in anticipation for the event, only to injure myself in the first 45 minutes. We were approached by 2 cops in a matter of about 3 hours, had numerous driving problems with lost members of the JumpVA caravan, and got rained out before even tasting the slightest bit of the sweetest of PK on the UVA campus. I somewhat unintentionally over drafted my checking account on gas driving so much, only to be threatened at the very end by a call to the cops for actually trying to pay for gas. And yet, I had a great time. I find it funny that a PK jam that involved no PK for myself could be so fun, but in the end, i'm really glad that everybody decided to crash at my place and grace me with their presence. Even those that I had not previously met, I felt a certain amount of kinship with, and everybody added their own spice to the mix. We all had some great conversations, and even though not all of us are anime or video game geeks (hehe, yeah, I went there) the random references were still funny. Thanks to everyone for stopping in and having a good time, you're all welcome back any time, and remember to keep up the flow.
