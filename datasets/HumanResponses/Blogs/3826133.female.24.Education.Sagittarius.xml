       Perhaps this will keep me entertained at work some. The question now, do I send this address out to other people, or just wait for them to find it? I think I'll just wait. After all, I'm really doing this for my own amusement.   Sam (the BF) is out of town right now. I miss him something irksome. I really wish he was here for the holiday weekend. He'll be out of town with his roommate Kevin. I think they went to the PK to sit on the lake or something. I don't really remember where he told me they were going. He's called a couple of times, and I guess I could ask him, but I don't really care outside of the fact that it's *not here.* Phooey. It sucks to be this lonely without him.   I've decided to activly search for another job. As long as it's at the hospital. I only want to work for UMC, which I suppose is sad and pathetic, but I just love them so much. They're good to me.   Lia is going with my ex-husband's parents this weekend. That's going to make the house that much emptier.   Holidays are not fun for me.   Although, I think Seester Sekatsim is in town already. Perhaps she'd like to entertain me...I'm dying to see her. Its been years. Literally!

      After lunch today I decided that Monkeypants was mad at me. Just like that. I just decided that he didn't return my call and therefore must be mad at me. Girls are so strange. Monkeypants is not mad at me, of course. He just got busy and didn't return my call. But why would I decide that he was angry at me and not speaking to me? Monkeypants is not that kind of person; he would sit down and talk to me. He's a wonderful person. It was a completely irrational decision. I jumped from point A to point z32B7.9 with no basis what so ever.   I'm nuts.   And as a bonus: Mom's decided I'm pregnant! Yay mom! Thanks for your vote of confidence!

      Let me start this entry with an apology to Mr. Collins: I never intended to Middle Name you in an offensive way. I just didn't want anyone to be confused as to   which   Samuel Collins I was speaking of. That's all.   And now, on with the show....   I called in sick yesterday. I needed the day to do wonderful things by all myself and with the aforementioned Mr. Collins. (Who would like to be called Monkeypants when I refer to him, but I just can't bring myself to do it. Sorry, luv.) So I called in. This eventually caused my mum to realize I wasn't at work and she in turn freaked out. Then she proceded to tell me of the horrible state my bank account was in. Why does she have access to my bank account? Hm? I'm 24 (or 25...no, 24.) divorced, a mom, I live on my own. Why does she have access to my bank account? Then she *drove by my house to see if I was really at home sick.* (I wasn't.) She called me a couple of times yesterday, I think mostly to make me crazy. I know she's going through a rough time right now, but COME ON. LEAVE ME ALONE. I don't need my mom to run my life for me. I am an adult. *sigh*   Today, I have a stack of work to get done before Karen (my supervisor) gets back to work on Monday. Right. I'll get on it. As if.   Last night I had Brother, Josh, HoJo, The H*Factor, Cousin Jessica, her BF Matt, Sam, and Ashley all over to the house. It was so awesome. A little impromptu get together. Lia even got in her own bed and went to sleep. Josh and Brother really were pissing me off, though, because they kept cheating at Phase-10. Josh also was in charge of drinks, which may be why I overslept this morning.   I still am not having any luck finding the right outlet for publishing. Any one with suggestions out there? No? Probably not. I think that only Sam and Sekatsim are reading this. Maybe HoJo. I think y'all would have told me if you had any ideas for me. (I hope you would have....)   If I can get all of my shit together by lunch, I'm going to lunch with HoJo. Which is good. I miss her.   No official date night tonight. Kind of had "date day" yesterday instead. Sam and I did laundry, ate lunch, had ice cream and watched a movie together. It was nice. Of course, I think anything I do with Sam is nice. Works well for me.   StepMonster is having immunotherapy next week. I'm scared about it. Hate to admit it, but I am.

       I'm trying desperately to get published. My poetry, my short stories, whatever. I have an ache in my soul that will not be filled until I can hold something in my hands that has a title on it and my name in the by-line. I've been sending stuff out like crazy, but since I've not finished anything, really, its mostly my poetry going out. The problem is that most publishers won't even look at my stuff until I'VE BEEN PUBLISHED PRIOR. How do I get published if being published is one of the requirements? I mean, come on! How ridiculous is that?     Also, Monkeypants has to work all weekend. No Friday night date night this week. There wasn't one last week and there won't be one next week. I'm terribly dissapointed in that. First time Monkeypants has dissapointed me, though, and its not even really his fault. Go figure.    Seester Sekatsim went back home to Dallas. I miss her already. It's amazing how quickly one falls back into old friendships. Love you Seester.

      I don't know what it is today, but I'm feeling really down.  Okay, actually, I do know what it is, and its a little bit of everything.  I'm just feeling really overwhelmed.  1.    My little brother can be a complete shit.    He intentionally hurt Hayley's feeling last night.  I don't really know what to do about it.  And while I feel completely sorry for Hayley, I also don't understand why she allows herself to be put in that situation.  She knows how Christopher is going to treat her.  She knows that he and Josh are going to go out of their way to exclude her.  She's slowly making herself miserable.  Chris and Josh are to blame, but so is Hayley herself.  2.    Heather is out of control.    She slept with some random guy again last night.  Two weeks in a row now.  She's really scaring me.  She'll probably tell FuckHead all about it and he'll get mad and then hit on her.  She'll probably take him up on it and then regret it later.  Okay, to be fair, she proably won't accept his offer and then she'll regret that later instead.  I wish she'd stop drinking.  I wish she'd at least drink with people who were going to look out for her.  I wish she'd get over FuckHead.  3.    My job sucks.    Which you think would be evident by the fact that I'm able to Blog at work.  I was late (again) today, and Karen turned me in.  She also told me to get all the shit up from around my desk.  Suzanne wants to know about Way's travel.  I'm certain that people will be in looking for thier money later.  I just ahven't felt like doing anything and up until this week, I'd been able to get away with doing nothing.  Now it looks as though I'm going to have to actually work.  For shame.  4.    Lia is sickly today.    Which even though it isn't my fault, it still makes me feel like a bad mother.  Go figure.  5.    I want to marry Samuel Powell Collins.    Tomorrow.  Hell, on my lunch break.  But not only would my friends and family absolutely flip out, I'm not certain Sam would go for it.  I think that my intensity sometimes scares him.  I think that sometimes he doesn't know what to do with me.  I know he loves me.  I just think its going to wear off.  On that same note, different song:  6.    I really miss Seth Thornberry right now.    I wonder if he thinks about me as often as I think about him.  I wonder if Tara makes him happy.  I wonder if he really wants me at the wedding.  I miss him.  I want him to still be a part of my life.  I love Sam eternally, and don't want anyone other than him, but I miss Seth still, and probably will my entire life.  Heather told me you have two true loves in life:  your first (Seth) and the one that lasts (Sam?).  Why can't they be the same person?  I suppose that would be too easy.  :)

      I made it to work on time today! &nbsp; THREE DAYS THIS WEEK!&nbsp; Yay!  &nbsp; The Little Dictator is going to the Farm with her CeeCee this weekend.&nbsp; I have a date with Monkeypants tonight.&nbsp; Yay! &nbsp; I'm actually getting work done!&nbsp; Yay! &nbsp; I did not clean house last night (boo) but I did hang my "curtain" over my bed and paint my closet door!&nbsp; Yay! &nbsp; Monkeypants had Boys Night last night.&nbsp; They played Master of Orion.&nbsp; I'm mad that I couldn't go.&nbsp; I want to game!&nbsp; I hope he kicked ass.&nbsp; I'm sure my baby won.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; He did promise to try and set up a LAN party so that I could play soon.&nbsp; I love him.

      I can post what I intended to post this morning before my soap box took over.  (I'm still on it, btw, I just need a few minutes to be 'regular' Kathryn Rainne and not "SuperHero" Kathryn Rainne.)  I miss normal life.  Life without drama.  Life where Headder can come over and play cards without Rish calling and stealing her from me.  Life where my (s)Mother respects me as a person.  Life where things are good simply because they are simple.  Last night was near perfect again.  Monkeypants came over and worked on his resume (finished it, as a matter of fact!  I'm so pleased!) and The Little Dictator and I went to bed.  I read.  An Orsen Scott Card novel, but not science-fiction.  He's fabulous.  Headder stopped by until she was needed elsewhere and then Monkeypants and I fell asleep together.  Near perfection.  Seeing as how Monkeypants hasn't found a job yet, I'm going to start packing this weekend.  I'm looking seriously into Austin.  Everything is so expensive everywhere, though.  I guess I'll just wait and see.  The Little Dictator is feeling better.  She ate some dinner last night.  She would have just eaten candy if I had let her.  ;)  Worked on the poetry today.  I think I've a strong chance of getting it published.  Once I get it all together, anyhow.

         I have just received yet another confession from a friend that they were raped/practically raped. Why must every woman go through this particular form of violence? Sexual abuse is too rampant in our society. I cringe to think that I'm going to have to explain to my daughter at some point that the reason mommie has issues or her Aunt can't find a meaningful relationship is because some bastard put sex before her feelings and Lia should never never never allow a man to treat her that way. With all of the information available to us and to the men in our lives, why can't they understand that forcing themselves onto a woman is simply NOT ACCEPTABLE? Do their mothers not tell them to treat a woman with respect? Do their fathers tell them that 'sometimes no means yes?' I don't understand how our society has allowed this sort of behavior to become so common place that I can only name one close girlfriend who has not been sexually assaulted. And she probably just hasn't told me about it yet. Even my office mates have confessions. These are women with multiple degrees. These are women who were not drunkards, or even drinking. They were minors, some of them, and innocent. Not one of us asked for this to happen to us, and yet, we are all dealing with the consequences. Some of us daily, some of us less frequently, but we are all still learning to cope in some way. Some of us have shut down our creativity, some of us chose (intentionally) the wrong men, some of us refuse to trust men ever again. Not one of us are healthy now. What about the jackasses that did this to us? Do you think they have regrets? Do you think they suffer daily wondering how we're doing or if we're okay? Hell, no. Do you think they've gone on to do this again? As much as it makes me sick, I'd have to say 'probably.' They're out living their lives, and if we cross their minds, its probably in reminiscence as some sweet piece of ass from yesteryear.   I can't stand for this any longer. I don't know how to fix it, but its affecting the lives of all of my friends, of my family. I don't want my daughter to go through this. I can't allow this to continue to happen to our young women.   I am on a mission.

      Yesterday was weird. My dreams last night were weird. I have weird e-mails this morning that I don't really know what to do with. Work will be weird today.   The Little Dictator threw up on me as we were leaving the house yesterday. I called to tell work I'd be late, cleaned her up, showered, changed, and carried us back out to the car where she promptly threw up on me again. I just called in. Forget that crap.   I was overdrawn *273.93* yesterday. Yup. You read that right. So I sold some stuff (my wedding ring, for one) and borrowed some cash from friends. Its all fixed now, but I'm cringing that I still have cheques and such out. Erg.   I wore my wig yesterday. As I explained to The H*Factor: Its like a cape, but I can wear it in public. And we all know how I love to wear capes to help me accomplish things I can't do without support or some accent of fun.   Mr. Monkeypants is the best man ever. (Sorry to all of you blokes reading this. But its true.) He woke up after working all night to come over and watch the Little Dictator while I went and ran errands. He loaned me money (which makes me gag, ache. I hate that I had to do that.) He bought dinner. He washed the Little Dictator's vomitous blanket and my sheets. He held me. He was, all around, everything that I needed. I love him something terrible.   Last night was the perfect evening. Monkeypants, the Little Dictator and I all ate dinner at the table together before she went to bed. Monkeypants and I stayed up and talked on the couch (I explained the finer qualities of coffee) and then we retired to the bedroom, where we fell asleep talking to each other. It was superb. It was everything an evening should be. I didn't even mind so much when he woke at four and went home. Okay, so I did mind, but I understand. Hell, its the rule I made.   I dreamt that I was at a party, wearing these skimpy, but designer ball gowns. Paris Hilton style. The great part about it was the fact that half-way through the evening (in the midst of one of my changes) I realized that I had a GIANT tattoo covering my chest/abdomen. It was apparantly something I'd picked up during a drunken one night stand. It was large and very red and blue and all Tejano style. And it had Ethan Dalley's name in it. (What?) I found a dress that covered up most of it, and then noticed that I had a "32" tattooed on the underside of my left arm. Now, my right. Left again. No, wait! I have a 32 on the left and a 23 on the right! I changed again, covering all three of the tattoos, only to find I had a large shark running down the length of my left leg (Thanks, Monkeypants) and a collection of coloured butterflies covering the right. I found a dress that was high collared, long sleeved, and floor length, but with a slit in the right side. The butterflies were cool. When I finally found sometone to ask about all of this, Gwen Moore told me that I got really drunk one night and slept with Ben Paxton, who then convinced me to get Ethan's name inked on to give Ethan a bad rep. The tattoo artist was really excited about my skin being a blank canvas that he told me it would be free if I'd let him give me all sorts of other things. And I went for it! This (of course) made perfect sense, so I went back to the party. Then my alarm went off and Franz Ferdinand started singing just for me, so I got out of bed and turned them off.   In the ten minutes before they went on again, I dreamt that work burned to the ground and took all of my stuff with it. Stories, poetry, label maker, coffee mug. It was sad.

      Kins and I talked during lunch.  I think we're both going to run away to Seattle.  It will be fun, and I can get my daily dose of KEXP.  On the radio, not the computer.  Even Karen today is doing nothing.  I don't feel so bad (now) that I've spent all day playing games....again.  It's either 1404, 1406, 1359, or straight up 1400 by the four clocks sitting on or around my desk.  No wonder I can't make it to work on time.  Which I did this morning, partial help going to Mr. Monkeypants as he called me incessantly this morning making certain I wasn't still asleep.  (Thanks, Sam.)  No luck on the publishing as yet.  Will keep you posted.  Literally, I suppose, as that's what I do on this site.

      The weekend was nice.  Except for dealing with my (s)Mother, which is quickly becoming a reoccuring theme.  But, whatev.  She's my mum, and I'm going to have to deal with her for the rest of my life, so today, I'm offically filing Mother under the "Does not kill me" category.  I'm putting everything in two categories:  "Does Not Kill Me" or "Will Kill Me."  So far I have "smoking" in the "Will Kill Me" category.  Everything else falls into the other.  I debated for a while on where to put Mum, but I realized that I'm more likely to kill her than she is to kill me.  So into the "Does Not Kill Me." file.    Seester Sekatsim told me the other day that I underestimate myself.  While I don't find this to be true, I was very flattered by it.  I actually printed out the correspondence and I've been carrying it around with me.  I pull it out when I get frustrated or upset and I reread it.  It comforts me.  It makes me happy.    I've decided to look for a different job, as I hate this one and I won't be able to go to school in January anyhow.  I told Sam "Monkeypants, dahling" that if he didn't have an intership within thirty days that I was going to box my house up and move.  So far I'm looking into New Orleans, Austin, and Denver.  Tucson is always a possibility, too, but seeing as how I can't reach Kinsey, I'm crossing it off for now.  He has 28 days left.  Finished painting and rearranging my room this weekend.  Looks nice.  Clean.  Sharp.  On to Lia's room, next.  Pink and green, I think, with frogs and butterflies and whatever else she wants.  The Monkey Princess.  (Or dictator.  Either one works.)  I went to bed at 1830 last night and didn't wake until 0645 this morning.  I feel good!  Poetry day.  I'll be published by Christmas.  Watch.

       The H*Factor called last night.&nbsp; Awkward, but friendly.&nbsp; I feel much better.&nbsp; Christabelle broke up with Josh.&nbsp; *FINALLY*&nbsp; Lunch today with Leeroy and Bobbie Jo.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Advocatus Diaboli has been reading your site, Seester dear.&nbsp; He gives you props for being     so imaginative and clever!&nbsp; What a wicked sense of humour!&nbsp; I can definately see why you're friends with her! I asked Monkeypants last night if maybe we couldn't live together.&nbsp; Or at least share stuff.&nbsp; He rather likes this idea as well, so now I just have to speak to my parents about it.&nbsp; They're going to go apeshit, but I can just move out of the house.&nbsp; (Right, as though I've got the courage to talk to them, much less tell them that I'm moving out of the house they just helped me buy...)  *sigh*  Expecting calls back today from all of the jobs I've been applying for.  I have a wonderful house that Monkeypants is desiging for me, but I'm going to have to show him what a coffee shop details.&nbsp; He had no kitchen or bar.&nbsp; silly man.&nbsp; :)

        And the more I think about it, the more okay I am with it.&nbsp; See, I put down the ultimatimum that he had  x  amount of time to find a job or we were going to  pack our shit up and move. &nbsp; I didn't know where I was going, but it would be far away and it would be not here with no (s)mother no step monster no Fucking Karen no&nbsp; no no no no.&nbsp; But I don't think I can get out of my house.&nbsp; I don't think my grandmother (who cosigned on it with me) would appreciate me subletting it less than half a year after she was coerced into buying it.&nbsp; i don't have money to relocate.&nbsp; and i'm terrified of getting far far away with a man i love and having things not work out.&nbsp; (gee, i wonder why i worry about these things?)

       So while today started out well enough, it quickly turned sour.&nbsp; Last night, I let Monkeypants stay the night.&nbsp; Okay, I requested that he stay with me.&nbsp; As in I didn't make him wake up and leave at 3 AM.&nbsp; (I think that's getting to be harder on me than it is on him.&nbsp; Poor guy.)&nbsp; So I woke up next to the man I love.&nbsp; The Little Dictator told me in the car that I was the Mommie.&nbsp; Someday, he would be the Daddy.    &nbsp;  *silence*    &nbsp;  "What, honey?&nbsp; I'm afraid that he's not a Daddy."    &nbsp;  "But he love you.&nbsp; And he love Lia.&nbsp; And Mommie love Sam and Lia love Sam."    &nbsp;  "Well, I do understand that, and I'm *really* glad that you like him, but he's not part of our little family yet."    &nbsp;  *silence*    &nbsp;  "Lia?"    &nbsp;  "Tomoyow?&nbsp; Sam is my family tomoyow?"    &nbsp;  "Not tomorrow, honey.&nbsp; But eventually, okay?"    &nbsp;  What a completely bizarre conversation to have with a three year old.&nbsp; I don't even really want to get into it.    &nbsp;  When I walked into work, I found out that I had been written up for "insubordination, incompetency, and failure to perform work duties."&nbsp; When I questioned the evidence to this, my supervisor pulled out a form that I had misunderstood the directions on, and discussed at length with her yesterday.&nbsp; She informed me that I needed to have it done this morning by ten and in the mail by eleven, or she'd be turning the write up in.&nbsp; She has serious misgivings that i'm capable of handleing this job.    &nbsp;  Of course I'm going to make mistakes.&nbsp; I started in February for Christ's sake, and I now have more experience in the office than anyone else.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a slow time, and it is true that it must look to her as though I do nothing, because three days out of five I have *exceptionally* minimal amounts of work to do and the other two I have only slightly more, but that will change when my students start in three weeks.    &nbsp;  I have to find a new job.&nbsp; I need to get out of here and free myself.&nbsp; This job was tolerable until Fucking Karen started working here.&nbsp; The problems didn't all start until after Jeremy and Dustin left.&nbsp; Fucking Karen hates me.&nbsp; She is working against me.&nbsp; Not quite sabetoge, but close enough.    &nbsp;  *sigh*    &nbsp;  I hate that I share an office with her.&nbsp; Now I can't vent or cry or anything.    &nbsp;  Sam, where are you?&nbsp; I need you.    &nbsp;  On a brighter note:&nbsp; Monkeypants is designing us a coffeeshop/bookstore/studio/loft.&nbsp; Its wonderful, and I tear up everytime I think about it.&nbsp; I love him so much, and I just am still blown away that he loves me that much as well.

      The H-Factor pulled another Monday night Regular.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; She's really getting way out of control.&nbsp; From now on, she spends Mondays with me or HoJo.&nbsp; End of Story.&nbsp; No Argueing. &nbsp; (I just got a love letter from Lucas on  urlLink Ctrl Alt Del .&nbsp; No shit.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; I love him.) &nbsp; I am at peace with Monkeypants.&nbsp; And I have decided that his time is nearly up here, and we're both going to run away to Canada.&nbsp; I'm finished being a psycho.&nbsp; (no really.)&nbsp; I am completely comfortable with him.&nbsp; I think he's absolutely wonderful and we're going to take things at his pace.&nbsp; We had a fabulous talk last night about some more of my history.&nbsp; Then I fell asleep with him.&nbsp; I love that.&nbsp; I feel safe and wonderful.&nbsp; Peaceful.&nbsp; Beautiful.&nbsp; Honourable. &nbsp; Today I will find another job.&nbsp; Even though my head hurts.&nbsp; Because if I don't have more money soon, I will be thrown in jail.&nbsp; Plus, I am afraid that even if I make *enough* money, I will kill the OCD Soop before the summer is over.&nbsp; She's making me even more insane than I was before. &nbsp; Maow:&nbsp; Strange cat. &nbsp; I need sleep.&nbsp; And to work on my stories.&nbsp; Nap time at lunch, I think. &nbsp; &nbsp;

        So I'm feeling all *funky* today.&nbsp; See, I've decided that Monkeypants is in the process of deciding to leave me.&nbsp; ( I know, I'm insane.)&nbsp; I think the Little Dictator scares him and makes him uncomfortable and in the end he'll leave.&nbsp; (See, Hojo.&nbsp; I told you that the Little Dictator was going to be my downfall.)&nbsp; In all honesty, I think that we've just made it through the "honeymoon" phase of our relationship and we're starting to see the flaws in each other.&nbsp; Things that we go "hm.&nbsp; can i deal with THAT for the rest of my life?"&nbsp;Strangely, me, the Independance Queen, Ms. Stoic, I know there's not anything on the planet that I wouldn't put up with from Monkeypants.&nbsp; Even the things about him that make me *insane* (find an architecture job, god damn it!&nbsp; that's what you went to school for!)&nbsp; are tolerable.&nbsp; I'm completely content and happy and wonderful and complete.&nbsp; (Cheesy, yes, but true as well.)&nbsp; And in all likelyhood, I probably find more fault with me than he does.&nbsp; I normally do.&nbsp; I'm too hard on myself, I know, but I'm just not who I want to be as of yet.

      So I don't really have anything to talk about today.   Life is strange like that.&nbsp; Everything, and then nothing.   My boobs are still huge.&nbsp; But I'm not pregnant, so I guess its cool.&nbsp; Weird, but cool.&nbsp; *BAM!*&nbsp; Overnight boobs.   I weeded in my front yard yesterday.&nbsp; Now I just need to mow.&nbsp; (Hear that Monkeypants? Extension cord extension cord extension cord.)   Still looking for&nbsp; a new job.&nbsp; I just know one is going to fall into my lap.   House sitting for Mum this weekend.&nbsp; Should be fun.

        I'm having to repost this post.&nbsp; I deleted the last one after writing it, so I don't know that this will be as detailed as the last post, but maybe it will be more chronological.&nbsp; Which means I'll start the discussion with yesterday.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Oooo, unless I go reverse chronological, which will be more confusing and fun for me, but not for you, dear readers....(a.k.a. Seester).&nbsp; Here goes....

      Monkeypants tried to hurry home to surprize me with lunch...unfortunately, I already have a job interview scheduled early early that I'm taking my break as.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I'm dissapointed that I don't get to see him at lunch.  So in other news... (or here's what I intended to write about today)  Fucking Karen made nice yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; And then she blew it when I got here because she'd sent me a letter telling me a) what's expected of me and b) how to do it.&nbsp; Bitch.&nbsp; I still hate her and I still hate the job.&nbsp; Which is why I'll get a new job soon.  And on a more cheerful note, my boobs seem larger today.&nbsp; Must be time for my period.&nbsp; My clothes look good, though.  Started playing Tropico on Monday night....totally addicted.&nbsp; I just wish my sound worked on my computer so that I could hear all of the cool carribean beats.  Had dinner with Mum last night.&nbsp; It actually went really well.&nbsp; No yelling or argueing.&nbsp; No fighting about menial things.&nbsp; We just ate dinner and then I went home.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; I should go months without seeing her more often.  My chest feels all tight today.&nbsp; (It must be from the larger boobs.)&nbsp; I feel as though I slept with an ace bandage tied around my chest or as though I'd be held too tightly while sleeping.&nbsp; I think its pneumonia or maybe an ongoing heart attack.&nbsp; Fucking Karen says its probably gas.&nbsp; Whatever.  The H*Factor went out on Monday night and met some very nice guy whom she didn't sleep with!&nbsp; Way&nbsp;to Go!&nbsp; She actually went to have dinner with him yesterday.&nbsp; Even cooler.  I suppose that's everything for now...I'm sure I'll hop back on later and post again after my interview.&nbsp;

      I had a job interview this morning.&nbsp; It either went really well or it was horrible.&nbsp; They were very nice and to the point and very congenial.&nbsp; I either was perfect and they just have to figure out if they can afford me and if my hours will work.&nbsp; Or they were rushing through to finish the interview because they hated me.&nbsp; Bah.  Fucking Karen gave me a "discussion" when I got in today at one.&nbsp; I need to get "organized" and learn to "cover my ass."&nbsp; Bah.  Monkeypants is in Brownwood.&nbsp; I miss him i miss him i miss him.&nbsp; Hurry home, boyfriend.

      It is absolutely amazing how ones perspective can change in just a few short days.&nbsp; Nothing life altering can happen and then *bam* all of a sudden one tiny miniscule moment can make you someone else.  My defining moment was with Fucking Karen last Friday.&nbsp; She berated me again for something that was A) Out of my hands and B) None of Her Damn Buisness.&nbsp; So I realized that Fucking Karen and the HSC are being moved into the category of "Things Which Will Eventually Kill Me."&nbsp; Outside of the fact that the job here is horrendous, and no one knows what we're doing or anything, I've decided that every person here hates me.&nbsp; No one likes me.&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; And its sucking my soul away.&nbsp; I cried this morning in the car because I detest coming in here so much.&nbsp; I was late again, btw, so that's just one more thing that Fucking Karen can hold against me.&nbsp; My one true flaw: being unable to make it to a job I hate on time.  So this&nbsp; is why I'm a miserable person.&nbsp; I"m working my ass off to earn money in a job I don't enjoy in the slightest for people who think I'm a bad bad person.&nbsp; The thought rather mellows one.&nbsp; I don't personally understand it.&nbsp; I work hard.&nbsp; Sometimes.&nbsp; When there's hard work to be done, that is.&nbsp; *sigh*  Good news: Monkeypants brought me a flower this morning.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Before work.&nbsp; Just because he loves me.  Bad news: He's going home to Brownwood for three days, leaving me here.  Good news: I have a job interview tomorrow.  Bad news: I don't have any idea what type of job it is.  Good news: The H*Factor and I are speaking again.&nbsp; She even bought me a shirt this weekend because she thought I'd like it.  Bad news: I'm too tired to hang out with her tonight and this is probably going to hurt her feelings again.  Good news: I slept close to 12 hours on Saturday night.  Bad news: This means I didn't fall asleep until four this morning.&nbsp; Maybe why I was late.  Good news: Monkeypants has *finally* put a resume together.  Bad news: He's not doing anything with it.  There's the long and the short of it.&nbsp; I've decided not to hold the ultimatium to Monkeypants that I've declared.&nbsp; I'm being way to bitchy with him about finding an internship.&nbsp; If the boy doesn't want to work, then he doesn't want to work.&nbsp; He makes enough money to support himself and when he gets unhappy enough with the hotel he'll start looking for something to keep him occupied.&nbsp; Here's the catch though, I'm not going to tell him that I'm giving the ultimatium up; if he reads it in the Blog, great, otherwise, I'm going to let him think I'm still worrying about it.&nbsp; He needs some drama in his life right now.

      Yesterday was full of super ultra highs and way down dirty dirty lows. (I'd like one day of normalicy, please.)  As we know from yesterday's post, the morning was brilliant and shiny. Just the way I like my mornings. At some point after lunch, I slipped into a deep and terribly damp dungeon. Not how I care for my days to go.  (s)Mother has run away from home. No, really. My Mom has run away. (And she doesn't understand when I drive aimlessly around town.) I'm secretly stashing cash for her and now she's run away. Not joking. Seems the problems between her and Mito are only getting worse. I'm worried and frustrated and unsure how to help. Then I realized that I've lost my pay ticket for this month's house payment. They won't send me a new one without Gramma's social security number. How am I suppose to pay this? Gr. Stupid Washington Mutual. I had to tell Christabelle that I won't be in Dallas this month. She cried. I miss her so much, but I'm going to see her soon. Hell, I'll be sending her an invitation, soon. But I'm getting ahead of myself.... Things picked up again after work and I took Lia to the grocery. Yea. Now we have food. I took Monkeypants dinner and flowers. He nonchalantly said the killer nine words which devestated me, broke my heart, shattered my very breath:   I'm going to spend time with the boys tonight.

      So Fucking Karen is out of the office today, which should give me plenty of time to look for another job. I'm cheerful, and have all of my work completed for the day already. Duke Ellington is on the stereo. Good good day.  Mum and I are argueing again. I think she's trying to save up enough money to be able to leave Mito. It scares me. I hate that things can fall apart so fucking quickly.  I completely weirded out on Monkeypants last night. I took an offhanded comment and took it to mean way more than it did. We've both been tired and grumpy lately and I think that the attitudes that we were seeing life in had a lot to do with my understanding of the statement. I think we got it all worked out. Essentially, I'm a goober.

       This weekend did not go as planned.  (Do they ever? I hear you query.  Yes.  Yes, they do.)      Mum and Manuel did not go out of town, so I was stuck at my own house.  Monkeypants has not gotten his truck fixed, so we were forced to take The Car everywhere.  (BLAAHHHH.)  I took a *five hour nap* on Saturday after work, completely wasting the entire evening.  Hojo cancelled our Dallas trip because she can't get out of work, so now we're having to replan her entire birthday celebration (and I'm totally crushed that I won't get to see Seester or KissKiss) and I have to decide if I'm going to give my days off *back* or continue to not come in.  Last night The Dicatator and I went over to Monkeypants's so that he could grill.  His friend (who shall remain nameless so that I can't get in trouble later) made me so horribly cranky that it could not have been a pleasant experience.      Just for the record:  I know how to wash and tear lettuce.  I know how to choose a tomato.  I know when to use oil when cooking meat and when not too.  I know the nutritional value of whole wheat versus white bread.  (BTW, as an FYI, *non* whole grain wheat vs. whole grain wheat....um, yeah, unless its whole wheat, there's not enough nutirtional value to make a difference, so you can eat white if you want to.  Potato bread is better for you that wheat without the grain.  Take that, smarty britches.)

      Talked to Rivers again this morning.  (How wicked is that?)  Found the *most awesome site ever*:  urlLink http://www.neighborhoodies.com   You make your own shirts, bags, undies, and of course  hoodies.   (i'm addicted to hoodies.)  Reading Seester's comments on her site I realized something wonderful:  Families are who you decide they should be.  Blood and sweat have nothing to do with them, although, I'll grant tears to be deciding factor.  Seester *is* my sister, regardless of heritage.  Monkeypants is my husband, in heart, and The Dictator's parent, even though they share no blood.  The H*Factor, HoJo, KissKiss, Christabelle:  These ladies are all my sisters.  They are my family because of what we've shared together, how we relate, and what I'm willing to do for them.  I would place thier lives before mine on any given occasion and risk everything for any one of them.  Scarily, I know that they love me as much as I love them.  I know everytime The H*Factor calls me at three in the morning that I'm important to her.  I know when Christabelle calls to cry because she's happy for me.  Or when KissKiss buys me shirts, even though she knows that we won't be able to see each other for a looooooooonnnnnnnng while.   These girls all support me wholeheartedly, loyally, honestly.  They aren't afraid to give me the brutal truth or to soften things when they need to be softened.  They know that sometimes I just need them for no apparent reason.  As for Monkeypants, any man who's willing to find another job just to make me happy, or watch my child so that I can take my friends out, well, if that's not dedication, love, trust, I don't know what is.  Families are wonderful!

      The Dictator and I were both asleep last night by 8:30.  It was heaven...at least on my part.  Of course, we both overslept today and thus I was late to work this morning, but whatev.  Things to do today:   Call StepMonster and check out the plans for this weekend.  Go to UMC and find out if I have tomorrow off for Sarah's wedding.  Finish painting the damn house.  Mow the yard.  Take out the trash.  (Ew, the smelly, smelly, smelly trash.)   If I can accomplish most of these things than I'll feel as though my day is good.  The wedding date is moving.  Perhaps to March.  Monkeypants's best friend Army Dave is unable to make it in April because he moves to Hawaii in late March and can't get here or something.  So stay tuned, faithful readers, as I may be a married woman even sooner than I thought I would be.

      Yesterday was spent being completely paranoid that Monkeypants was going to leave me.  I had somehow convinvced myself that since we wanted to spend his time in the afternoon with Craig and Amy (which I had known about since Monday) that he ws chosing them over me and therefore, leaving me.  I understand that this puts me in the absolutely insane category, but I can't help it.  HoJo hurt my feelings, too.  She's treating me as Josh and Ward treated her, and I don't think she even sees it.  i'm glad that she enjoyed her 21st birthday, but I still feel as though The H*Factor and I were her "backup" plan and we only got called because she got ditched by her work friends.   I feel that I'm a very loyal and honest friend, but I guess that's not what she wants as she never calls, invites me out, comes over.  Monkeypants has told *no one* that we're getting married.  I'm crushed and devestated.  I feel as though he proposed in a desperate act to prevent me from leaving and it was just a ploy to keep me around.  Is he ashamed of me?  Does he not want anyone to know that he's chosen me?  Why wouldn't he tell people?  I'm telling everyone.  I'm so excited and proud of him.  He hasn't even told his roommates.  He's breaking my heart...  When did I become a responsible adult?  Why am I suddenly a passive person?  I will apparently, for no extra charge, let everyone in my life walk all over me.  My Dad, my boyfriend, my friends.  No, please, treat me as you will, and I'll sit here silently denying that you've hurt me.  Make all of my decisions while you're at it, will you?   I have to stop, before I cry at work again.

      Sorry its taken so long to write today ( I know you're all just dying in anticipation of what's been going on with me!)  To start with, today has been lovely.  We had the OSCE inhouse this morning and (as always) I got to run it and it was super fantastic.  Fucking Karen stayed out of it and let me do my thing.  Brilliant.  I got done early and took a long lunch.  Fantabulous.  But now my head hurts and I have to go out of town with my dad next week and I don't think I'm going to make it to Brownwood for Thanksgiving.  I just want to cry.  I don't really want to go to Dallas, but I know that it would mean the world to Dad and Lauri.  And I really want to go with Sam for Thanksgiving, but I don't know how to do it without hurting Lauri's feelings.  I'm so tired.  I want to sleep and cry and not wake up to an alarm.

      So I had a rare weekend....It was pleasant and strange.  Comfortable, yet unnerving.  I took Friday off because I woke up with the strange feeling that I would be getting a migrane.  (I know that it would have been true.)  I cleaned house, played games, and did laundry.  Ieventually made my way over to Monkeypants's house (where he had done laundry and *looked for a job* So proud of him :) ) and we watched Hidalgo   and then we went to take Amy to the aeropuerte.  (She still makes me crazy, btw.  I've decided its because she wants everything done her way and I want everything done my way.  Go figure that this situation irritates me.) Then we picked up Saigon and push started his truck (wicked.  totally.  how cool is that?) and went to his house to watch Firefly.  Meh.  Not so impressed with it, but we are only just now finished with the pilot, so who knows?  Friday was superwonderful.  Saturday I woke up (on time, I might add) and Monkeypants took me to work.  The day was good.  I read a lot.  Monkeypants picked me up (a touch late, so I worked a full day.)  We went to his house and played some game where I could shoot him and run him over with a snowmobile.  Then The H*Factor picked me up and we went out to the beer garden where I had *way* less to drink than normal and still had to be carried out of the bar.  After discussion with several people it was decided that I probably had something slipped into one of them.  I felt *horrible.*  Sunday was miserable.  I was slightly late to work.  I threw up a couple of times.  I was force fed.  (Truely.  Stupid fucking nurses think they know everything.)  I had some guy code *twice* during the shift.  He was DNR, yet we kept resuccitating him.  Go Team UMC!  (Saved the ungrateful fuckers life, btw.)  Had to pick up the Little Dictator right at 1500, so no nap.  Took Monkeypants home to sleep (because he hadn't since a brief nap on Saturday) and Little Dictator and I went to pick up Craig from the aeropuerte when he didn't need picking up and then we picked up Monkeypants (because he was awake) and took Craig *back.*  Then we went to Monkeypant's house where L.D. threw a bunch of fits before we went home and I finally got to go to sleep.  Mom came home.  She's eternally mad at me.  Boo mom.
