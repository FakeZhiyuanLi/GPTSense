       Ya right now I'm in Lincoln, Nebraska!! Whoa, we drove here today too, and we're heading to Breckenridge, Colorado, which we'll reach tomorrow! But ya so all I did in the car today which was like an 8 hour drive was sleep, read boring hw, and listen to music! then I got to the hotel and didn't swim or go for a run I sat down after sitting all day and watched tv! Now that's the life! Haha, but man I realized how much time on our hands we'd have if we didn't have a tv and didn't leave the house, wow would that be boring. And dude this is even harder for me seeing that it's impossible for me to sit still! but I did good today!Anywho we're gonna go white water rafting on tuesday! that'll be tight! But meh I just told you my day in like 2 sentences, wow life is exciting! But I'm going to go on my vacation now! Have fun but not too much without me! : )~Kati

       So today I think my number one lesson or thought was that everyone should just live life as it's given to you, don't care about what's going outside of where you are, just focus on what is going on around you at that exact moment at that exact time. That way it's so much more easier to just lay back and have fun, you don't have to worry about anything else or wonder what this somebody else is thinking about. It's so much less stressful on yourself too. I'm really screwed up though. So I finally get my guy... or have one, whatever, and like I said before I like him! But then there's still that one other guy that I've had a thing with forever, but of course it doesn't work out with him 'cause he's a jackass for the most part and he himself doesn't know what he's thinking.... but why do I still like flirt like mad with the jack and am still hesitent to really start something up with the sweetest guy in the world?! Seriously, if you have an answer to that, tell me. I always think I'm gonna have feelings for the jack guy though, especially when he's all over me, haha. I might also be like this too though 'cause I like guys....and well hell it's summer! Meh, we'll see how it all ends up after vaca. Ok wait my 2nd thought is that the Twins don't suck they just are unlucky! So whoever thinks they suck, suck on this..... on what? ya I don't know. Ok I'm out! : )~Kati

       Ok ya, so I'm gonna try this blog thing, lets see how many days I'll write in it till I stop, I say about 5. I just think it would be mighty interesting for me and the like 2 people who will read this 'cause I'm a very random person and meh I have a lot on my mind. I lose half my thoughts in like a second though, I seriously have add, not officially tested, but oh man I do.  Anywho.... so ya I think I have gone quit guy crazy lately, I mean for the first time ever I feel like I have people to actually chose from, that hasn't happened since like jr. high! It's tight, but now I feel like a dumbass 'cause the guy I thought I'd never get, likes me, and ya I like him, but now after spending the day with him, yes I still like him, but the thought of a relationship? I don't know, I don't wanna blow anything that's for sure, but should I really just throw everyone else away? and also right now the friendships I have with people kick ass and I love spending time with them, I don't wanna lose that either. Oy, what to do. Life is messed when it comes to things like that, like you, or at least I do/did, dreamed and like wished to have a one on one relationship with someone forever and then when the opportunity to actually have one comes about, it just doesn't feel right! If that doesn't happen to you, well then I guess it's just me!  I think another problem I have is that it never seemed like people liked me before or something because they didn't think I was hot or whatever, or I don't even know, but ya I always wanted people to think I was like damn hot, and now it's like the opposite, I don't know if people like me because I'm hot and they just want some ass or my ass or if they really actually like me. Like ya I'm always fishing for compliments, what can I say I like attention, but when all I hear is like 'wow your hot' ya it's flattering, but hey maybe you can prove that you like me for me! not for my body! Wow I swear life is too damn twisted like that. Whatever.  Even though I'm confused about it all, ya I'm liven summer, what else can I say, I've got plenty of guys, I get to sleep and hell I get to wake up and actually not know what I'm doing! That's so nice! Aight I'm out for the night! I promise the next one wont be so fricken long! : )~Kati

       So I've been thinking, sorta, well actually this was just a thought that came to me about 2 seconds ago when I was debating on what my title should be, but what do people hold dear to them in life? Is is something that can't be replaced, like family or friends? or is it something like a car and well, if you're rich enough, you're able to replace? I am going to embark on these thoughts and try to come to a conclusion as to why people treat these "luxurious items" the way they do.  (This almost sounds like a paper, haha!)  First off, I really think there are basically 2 types of people in this situation. 1) The ones who hold everything dear to them, that'll never be able to be replaced and 2) the ones who are somewhat spoiled that just don't take the things they should for granted.  But as I think about this I question as to if everyone has alittle bit of each types in them. Because really I think everyone cherishes their cars and their "BMW's" and ya they take as much care of them as possible, this especially applys to guys.  But then unless really that shallow and stuck up their still gonna care about their family and friends. And yes the family and people close to them will probably stick out more in the long run, but what I think I'm really pondering is how one treats the replaceables compared to the non-replaceables.  I really sometimes think that people will treat their cars better then the people close to them. No one ever gets in fights with their car, sure people will cuse at it if it breaks down, but it still stays durable and gets fix and brand new in the end. This really only goes for the nice cars though, shitty cars I really don't think people care too much about unless they don't have that much money.  Now that I'm thinking about it though I don't think that people care about their cares more, it just may seem like it sometimes, because, well cars can handle a lot more. See people can break down at least 3 times a week, if they're weak every day. Cars maybe once a month, on estimate. But really people don't like to deal with break downs all the time and fights, people don't get into fights with cars, and it becomes a lot more emoitional when it comes to people, something everyone gets shaky at. But still the question is why do people say mean stuff to their friends and treat what can be replaced at high value? I think it's because people can recoperate at a lesser price and well feelings and emotions  and expressions are dealt with that too, like when it comes to guys they're mean a lot to girls 'cause they're guys and that's just how they express their feelings. But see if you like "hurt" your car it costs a lot of money, money brings out the evil in people, so that's not something people want as a possibility, but now I'm getting all turned around 'cause you'd think that the price would be higher on a friend or family member if you "hurt" them. Sure technically the price is lower, but if you really hurt someone the issues and emotions between the people will always be there and get in the way.   I think I just lost myself in this whole converstation, I don't even know where it's going anymore, I hope at least that entertained you. I told you my thoughts are all over sometimes.   Emir and I just had a talk on the phone not to long ago, and ya we were wondering, what makes a better bed.... the mattress? or the comforter? In conclusion we came down to the comforter because that's what really molds to you and sheilds you from all, if you have a shitty matress but a high quality silk down goose feathered comforter, you'll think you're bed is the best thing ever. Really if you think about it, it's true, maybe that's why they call it comforter... comfortable...... haha! It all makes sense!!!  Everything makes sense in the end, it really does. May not ever really make sense to you, but oh it does, to add on to that everything has a meaning. Just think about it.  It's be odd.  Kati

       Being tierd really does make you dazed and confused and not really aware what's happening around you. When you're tierd the main thoughts that go through your head is: beeeed, pillows, tv, sitting, and so one. Basically, I don't have much control over my mind when I'm tierd, which is most of the time, so that is why I'm blaming being tierd on why I'm eating so much. Actually I really don't think I'm eating that much, I'm just eating a lot of junk food and because this is the longest period of time I haven't been in a sport or exercising for like 5 years it feels like I'm getting fatter, but technically I'm really not.  Dazed. I really did already kinda explain this, but ya I basically am not paying too much attention whats going on around me, and really I don't care too much. It's just that I don't wanna go deep into anything or do anything 'cause well starting tuesday I'll be doing a million things. I've just been really out of it.  Confused. Ok first of all, when aren't I confused? Seriously, I would like this to be anwsered! But ya I'm just confused as to what everyone is like thinking right, like everyone seems to be acting a little different and seems to be like questioning something all the time now, yet still they don't speak out their mind, it's like everyone is just sitting in their own little corner waiting for someone to come to them to ask hey what's going on up there? Maybe it's because schools starting on tues and we're all a little scared and anxious and we're all questioning everything that'll be affected by that.   Boring Summer Blues. Ya I've been quite bored this week, I've been staying in my pajamas till 5:00 (first off I don't wake until 12, but still). But ya I'm weird though 'cause I really could not be bored and be doing something during the day, but I've been weird and not really cared if I did anything, I mean I can just go and call someone and be like hey wanna do something? and I'd be doing something, but I haven't been calling anyone, I've been waiting till they called me. It' just that either way I don't care. This could be because I'm just getting bored of people and things in general, I'm not so much bored doing nothing, because well that's always fun, but I'm bored of seeing the same people every day and doing the same stuff with the same people. I'm bored of the site I have to wake up to every day and the same generalization I get from each days happenings. I'm bored of the same fights best friends tend to have, over stupid guys and being too selfish, I'm bored of guys and not having a fricken love life and failing when one could possibly happen. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm having fun and I had a fun summer even though it was mostly with the same people, but I'm bored of it all. I need change, I love change, I linger for change, but I haven't gotten it. It really could just come done to I'm bored of life..... or at least my life as it is. Maybe it would be different now if I was playing a sport, 'cause it gives me something to do and something for me to see every day. It also provides change 'cause it's not like you're having the same practice every day and same game every day. I really do wish I was playing soccer now.... but ya it was for the best. Being bored sure is fine, but being bored of certain aspects of life just sucks, I almost believe it'll make you boring in the long run, if I am becoming boring, please tell me. I'm actually probably boring you with all this boredom talk. All I'm saying is that I need a little more pizazz in my life right now 'cause I'm starting not to even care because I'm so bored.   Whatever I've been feeling, school will change it all.   Oakes

       I really don't have much to say today, basically I slept till 12:30 and didn't take a shower and change out of my pajamas till 6:30. Now that is seriously the life, but it's really pathatic 'cause we have like what, 5 days of school left? And instead of spending it partying I've been spending it at school and watching tv for half the day. I did spend the night though with people, and with people I normally don't hang out with, which is always fun. So I'm not a total loser, I just don't do anything during the day.   Ok I'm bored once again, and tierd from doing nothing all day, and I've lost all my train of thought and any last bit of intellectual moments, I'm thinking like a dog right now. Actually I think all my thoughts have kind of been like a dogs today.... it's like sleep, eat, eat some more, lay down, and ya pretty much all that right there was my day and it was spent like my dogs, wow. I guess that's why they call them Dog Days.... clever very clever.  My Dogs name is Cody (FYI).  I want a homecoming date, so ya Fred is getting me connections but any of ya'll out there, getting connections from ya wouldn't hurt!  Daily Plan tomorrow: Wake up at 12, watch tv, eat, call ae and GET A JOB, watch more tv, eat some more, go out to dinner with family, call people to see what we're doing at night and sit around at someones house complaining that we're bored yet not thinking of anything to do.  Boredom can only mean life is good and not stressful, be happy with it.  : )~Kati

       Relieved. Exhausted. Drama dreenched. Not quite ready to see the end. These are my feelings and emotions of today.   Relieved. I finally got my article for Echo done. After probably 15 hard hours of working on that beast I am finished, finished for good for Issue 1! After about about 5 columns of my article to begin with it went down to 2 small small ones.... and believe that was incredibly hard, I also had to cut a whole movie! And today when the final is due tomorrow at like 12, it was almost a consideration of rewriting the whole thing and compiling it all into one (I have it broken into movies) but thankfully we fitted (?) it all. But ya oy! My summer hw is done for good! Whoa! Just promise me you all will read my article, it may look short and look like it was easy, but holly balls that really took some time and effort, you'd be surprised.   Exhausted. First off I've been working my butt off to get this article done, and now that it is, I'm dead tierd, especially because I had to be at school today at 9:30 am and it is like 1:30 am now so meh. But with that and eating, with no exercise, and eating some more, and with the whole summer rapping up and no sleep catching up with me and hanging out with people till 12-1 in the morning every night for the past 3 weeks, I'm getting pretty tierd. But hey you've gotta live the summer up! Don't waste your time on hw like me!  Drama Dreenched. I'm sick of drama and people talking about each other behind eachothers backs, especially when it is with like your closest, or one of the closest, friends. It feels so Jr. Highish to be doing this and hearing this and so immature. We're fricken Jr.'s now, not Jr. Highers and people should just get over themselves and start giving a shit about the people around them. Stop being so fucking jealous of people and speak up and tell whoever the hell you're jealous of or mad at how you feel!!!! Sure I should too, but when I'm the one who people aren't telling things too, why should I be the first to bring it up? Really if I never started any of it and really aren't doing anything, why should it be my responsibility to go to that person and be like what's up? Don't you think if they have a problem with me that they should be the ones going up to me and telling me what they're problem is? Like seriously when I hear people like talking or whispering right next to me, most likely about me, it makes me feel like shit and makes me pissed off. My advise to people is to stop worrying so much about your fricken guy life and reputation and car about your friends, in the long run it's only gonna be your true friends left standing next to you, seriously think about it.   Not quite ready to see the end. 5 more days till the end. The end of summer. Although it is a beginning to look forward to, it's the beginning of school, sure it's new year, a new life basically, a fresh new start, but it's school. It's also my Jr. year, worst year and worst schedule ever, it can all kiss my ass. But this summer has kicked ass, I have lived it up for the most part, had a couple flings, and ding-a-lings.... sure.... and I feel like I didn't waste my time just sitting there watching tv, I at least added food to it all. But no really I feel stronger and feel like I have stronger relationships with people after this summer, I just don't want it all to end.   I know I need advise for myself sometimes, but ya I was talking with Janelle today and ya I gave her some advise and she thinks I'm a good advice person. So we decided that, seeing that we're both on the Echo, next year when we take it over, we're gonna add in an advice column called "talking tree" (seeing that my name is oakes, and ya in pocahantus the disney movie there's a talking tree that gives advice). I'll be the writer of it and I'm gonna "tear it up." But seriously if anyone really does need advice I'm here!!! ChickaSS31@aol.com  Tierd and humble; my feelings and emotions after writing this blog added on to all the other feelings I was feeling before, wow, I'm feeling this.   -Oakes, the "talking tree"

       I was at school today at 11:00 am..... tomorrow I have to be there at 9:30 am! Oy! It's depressing 'cause school hasn't even started yet and I've been there almost every day. But ya I was there for like 4 hours today and ya first off I came in my pajamas...... but ya then I got home and watched tv and fell asleep at 3:15 and woke up at 5, it was nice, and then I watched more tv until like 9 when someone finally called and asked if I wanted to do something, so ya I hung out with joesphine, freddie, and and gabby (gandy), nick, and kate, but mostly jo and fred 'cause everyone left early. I hate drama. I haven't had to deal with it for like a year or since jr. high 'cause that's when everyone was stupid and talked shit about everyone. But I'm starting to realize that is coming about again. It has to deal with 2 people, one person I just don't give a shit about 'cause they're mean, but they're still apart of it all. So if you're really good friends with someone you tell them like everything, well at least that's what I do and a lot of my friends, but lately one of my good friends haven't been telling me anything that's happening between her and this shithead, whom he and I have history. Like you've gotta tell you're friends if a relationship is happening with anyone, and if you're a good friend you woudln't let a relationship happen with anyone that your good friend has history with. Well this friend, is basically going behind my back and I'm starting to get really pissed off. Another thing is that she's trying to start like excluding me from like hanging out with our "group" and I was actually the one to introduce her to the group, like before if whoever called me to hang out I'd call her to have her come with now if they call her first she never calls me even though she told me that that day she'd hang out with me, well she doesn't call me right away but not until like 9, I think she does that to piss me off.... and ya it's working! But she needs to start getting over herself and start thinking about her close friends 'cause soon, it'll all go down. Drama sucks balls.  I think I may have made progress on a homecoming date..... Fred thought up 4 people for me and he's gonna try getting the "connections" with one of them, it is Fred though so we'll see. Hopefully something happens! Just a reminder there's 7 days left of school! The countdown begins! : )~Kati

       Last night I went to bed at 1.... this morning I woke up at 7:30...... so not enough sleep, to add on to that I've been staying out till like 12:00-12:30 and not even going to bed till 1 or 2 and still wake up pretty early.... tomorrow I am gonna crash like mad.... I went up to Michelle's grandma's house today, it was fun there was like this parade ie. lots of candy,  and like a little carnavel thing, I got a temp tatto there, it's tight it's of a rose on my ankle, so now I have 2, that one and then a pace salsa one for the state fair.  But ya at Mitchelles (Michelles) I got to ride a 4 wheeler and stuff and it was tight yo, haha. She's rubbing off on me with her raping.... yes Michelle raping, it's sad.  Ok the coutdown to finding a homecoming date is starting, I really want one before school starts because I don't want that adding the pile of stress I'll already have, but that only gives me a week so chances of that happening are slim to none. Guys suck.... no offence to those of you guys reading this. I just want a date. This sucks I was really gonna talk about stuff tonight, not just gibber gabber, and I was gonna get deep on my thoughts.... but I forgot and I got too tierd.... maybe they'll come back to me later.... but I'm gonna go!

       Ok Saturday..... First off I woke up at 10:30 which is hella early for me thanks to my buddy Kate for turning on the lights! But it's ok we had to get up.... we  had a big day in front of us..... we took an adventure to the one the only Minnesota State Fair!!!!!! High quality I tell ya. But ya me Kate, Chelsea, and I went to the fair, it was lots of fun except the part where I started to get blisters on my feet from my flip flops, bad idea, and when I got into a little fight against a certain someone who's name starts with a K and ends in a ate. Ok so if someone calls you selfish but you say that you aren't they are, does that make you even more selfish? I don't know if that makes sense.... It's late..... Anywho the highlight was when we went to the Kare 11 station for 2 hours and didn't even get on tv, we were in the stands and everything...... but hey we did get free food from them it was tight! We got a foot long hot dog, shaved ice, cookies, rice krispie bars, and this burrito thing.... yummmmm....... but what makes it the best was that it was free!! We also bought cheese curds, of course you can't go to the fair and not get any, and carmel apples in a dish with ice cream.  We also saw a lot of people at the fair, the first person was Mr. JT!!! Ok ya sorry, using initials today. Yeah, that was exciting, it really highlighted the whole state fair experience. 2nd person or people, was when we were looking for Emir's carmel apple stand when we realized it wasn't his, but PS's! JB also works there, but we didn't talk to him, ha fred, but ya we talked to PS and visited him a couple more times after, that was exciting, he's a good kid. And then later we finally found Emir or sorry EB and DJ where I guess JB works also. So ya we talked to EB and DJ for a while too, it was fun. Oh people a good.  So yes the state fair was fun and interesting and we got lots of free stuff and saw lots of ducks and bunnys and cows and sheep and pigs, aww pigs So later tonight we got together with the peoples again, and we ended up going to the lake again. Ok first off when we got there I had this odd feeling about it all and it was really scary there 'cause it was really windy and ya just didn't seem right, so from the beginning I was freaking out. But anways we walked down the path to the beach and then we were standing by this bench and all of a sudden we just see this man, just one, sitting there like on the rocks in the water and he wasn't really moving, so Nick and I, everyone else was stupid and stayed, took off running, and got freaked out, but then we turned around, but ya it was really freaky and weird 'cause you just don't go to a beach at dark with no lights by yourself, but ya we kinda stayed a little longer, with me of course freaking out, and he was just sitting there, yes he moved up and was alive, and kinda was just watching us, I freaked out and left, haha. But ya that was some odd shit. Oh ya and Kate like gave me a raper today.... there was this guy who was walking down my street and Kate goes that's odd and then when he was passing my window Kate yells out Hello! And he doesn't say hello or keep going he stops and goes up to my window!!!! And then he's like ya I'm here to humiliate myself and Kate says tell me your speech.... I dunno.... but ya he actually didn't do anything he just kinda stood outside my house for like 5 min, and we're like ok no go away now, and ya it was really freaky and now he knows where I live! But ya it was an weird ass night.  Ok who believes in fate and signs with like guys and love and all that shit? Enlighten me with your thoughts on that please....... ChickaSS31@aol.com ....... but ya I need a homecoming date.... I also have to wake up at like 7:30 so I'm going to bed! KO

       Oy so I've got a lot to say from the past 2 days! Lets start with yesterday, friday...... So I started my day out washing my car and cleaning it in the inside... but before I started I asked: "why the hell am I doing this too my car? Will it really make it any better?" For those who don't know I drive a fricken '86 oldsmobile..... I like to call it my shitmobile. So basically after I was finished it became a shiny shitmobile, great eh? Anywho, later that day I went to Ridgedale with Janelle and it was really weird 'cause when we got there the parking lots, all of them, well completely full like they were full all the way to the very last ones, it was really weird... but yet when we went inside it really wasn't that busy at all, it was like how it always was there... to this day I'm still confused what was going on. So ya at Ridgedale sadly Janelle bought nothing with her $30, but I applied to American Eagle and even talked to the manager dude and he's like ya we're just gonna call these references and call you back next week sometime, and ya I'm really excited about that 'cause that'd be tight to work there, thank you very much Naomi!  So later last night we went to Fred's, from like 8-10 though we basically just sat around waiting for something to happen, during that time Nick and Andy drove out to Richfield or soemthing to go to Best Buy and Emir and I went to Whole Foods, to buy, well food, I got cornbread. But ya so after that we went to this "hidden" beach, it's really not hidden, Josephine just likes to think so. But ya it was cool 'cause it was really nice out and ya at like 11 we went and went  swimming in the lake in the dark, obviously with no lights. That was a lot of fun I tell ya, it's gonna become a daily or nightly thing I'm thinking..... But ya that was a lot of fun but ya after that we went back to freds to get our cars, but ya I got there and my car was soaped!! See Emir and Nick left before all of us 'cause Nick had to be home early and Emir was tierd.... but ya they're denying, or well Nick is at least for sure, that they did it. It's bullshit though, they did it, no questions asked.  Ok that was it for Friday...... Saturday to be continued..... actually you've probably already read it by now. : )~Kati Oh ya and thanks to Janelle this site has be update and upgrated with color, design, and the best, the writing and reading material.

       I've never had a day consist of more waiting my life!!!!! And it's funny 'cause as I'm writing this I'm still waiting for this night to end and for a phone call and for people to get online so I can talk to them. This day will never end! It seriously is the never ending day. To make matters worse I've been waiting for like nothing, which means for school shit to end. Getting my sechdule and then waiting to edit my article for echo, which actually never happened, I have to go back on monday at 11, sucked too! Waiting and waiting and waiting and being bored with Janelle is the summary of this long extensive day. Hey at least Janelle and I were bored TOGETHER and waited TOGETHER, that right that, that was the highlight of my day, whop-di-fricken-do.  I did get to talk to a lot of people I haven't talked to for a long time though, that was fun. I was in a social mood so I talked and talked some more, but I suppose there isn't much else to do when you've been waiting so fricken long! I've been waiting for something to happen today, but nothing ever did.  So basically today I've waited for jack shit, I waited to get something done that never did, I waited to get my picture taken which frankly who gives a shit? I waited to get my sechdule changed although it did nothing for me first semester and I waited for a phone call which ended up with "I can't do anything, and goodbye." And now I'm gonna have to wait till I get tierd and for this stupid boring blog to get plubished so all of you out there reading this can get bored or even more bored than you already are. If you'd made it this far in my blog I assume you must be pretty damn bored unless you really think I'm that interesting.  Wow, time to go wait some more. Kati

       My defenition of college: A long overnight camp with lots of parties and beer with occasional hard study and project nights and days. We dropped my sis off at Iowa State today, it was funny 'cause my mom cried for like and hour after, but ya I supposed, she was the first to go. My mom said she'd cry when I left too, but I just said that I think she'll go off and have a party instead.  I'm excited already for college though, even though I got 2 more  years. See first off all I love new experiences.... this would defienitly be it. Also it's a chance to meet a lot of new people which I love, it's a new atmosphere with people you've never seen before; it's a change. It also doesn't help that there are many guys that are hot and nice and that you don't know anything about, but oh later you for sure will (wink, wink)...... oh man guys.....yumm.... When the time comes though, I really wonder what I'm gonna be like.... like in college will I be the party girl, haha possibly, or still like kinda shy and laid-back, meh I dunno, but I think I'm gonna do better off than my sis..... I think I talked to more people than her today, it's sad 'cause I'm not even in college.   Ok so the day of hell and truth tomorrow...... sechdules, once in your hand and once you've left the building, they're basically finalized, scary my junior year..... please shoot me now. Also it's picture day, must look good or else all is hell when that yearbook gets put into everyones hand.  Man this is seriously all scary, we're all about to start a brand new year in school, sure people will be the same for the most part, but maybe not..... summer changes people and it's weird and when school starts up again change in people will progress in them more, I just can't wait to see the outcome of people at the end of our high school careers... crazy. Well we all will continue on and embark on our daily journeys, but for now mine is off to bed! : )~Kati

       La-di-da..... so I feel like my brain has been working over board on writing 'cause of my echo article, I've just been reading it and like rewriting parts continuesly and now my brain is tierd..... It's hard for me to think in the first place, but now it's like whoa. Actually you know what I've figured all these blogs probably don't make sense or like I can't write like anything profound in them because I always write them at like  12:30 am or like 1 am. pretty hard to make up big words then. See I would write them earlier, but I don't want to write them during the day 'cause well the days not over and something big could happen and then I don't even get home or have people leave till 12.... so I have no choice.  Yeah so my sister leaves for college tomorrow!!! The car will be all mine and so will the basement and everything, muh haha! Except with the car I have to pay for gas to drive and I need money to pay for gas, but I can't get money without a job, and right now I don't have a job so therefore I can't get money and can't pay for gas and then not drive which would suck major balls.  So lately I've been busy, Friday I went to Valley Fair, Saturday MOA (Mall of America for those who don't know), Sunday I was at a car wash for hockey for like 4 and a half hours where were made about $500, and then today I went to school, ya yuck, and was there for like 2 hours 'cause of my article and then I went to Janelle's tonight. It was fun being in the pub (publication room) though 'cause ya I got to hang out with some people I hadn't seen all summer that I used to always hang out with in school. That's the ONE reason why I'm excited for school to start, to see long time friends, haha. Ok so Nick is a dumbass..... tonight when I was driving home, he left with Fred at the same time, they drove in front of me all the way home extremely slow so that I would be home late, even though it doesn't matter, but ya he'd go like 10 mph and then on turns he like would barely turn and then he blocked me out of the driveway! But ya it's funny 'cause when he was really slow I would speed up on the side of him and try to pass but my car is too damn slow so that even when he was braked and I never did he would just speed up and be right  in front of me again...... one of these days though I will win in car racing!!! Remember that.  Ok I'm probably gonna get Tendinitis in my wrist again from typin so much so I'm gonna go! KBO

       This is going to be quick, hopefully, 'cause I'm gonna go watch a movie... Bad Boys! Whoa, I gotta watch it so I can be ready for Bad Boys 2! So today was the frist day I played lacrosse in a long time, I forgot how much fricken fun it was! And hell I've got the moves, haha, but it sucks 'cause I seriously can barely run, well at least like turning and running, 'cause of my ankle! It sucks balls and ya if it's not better by the lacrosse season, shoot me now! It is my favoritest and best sport so I have to play it and score all the goals! haha! Ok guys suck, they piss the shit out of me, but I don't get it 'cause I still love them and obsess over them. I'm just waiting for that one day though where I'm no longer confused of the guy situation I'm in or who I like or who likes me, I can't wait to finally be in fricken utopia with my mind!And now that school's starting wow that'll never happen.  Ok note to self: Never wear white pants when a water fight is about to happen.... if you didn't know about this water fight happening change right before it actually starts... therefore everyone wont be looking at your ass and your thong. Note to all of you: Water fights and squirt gun fights are fun until it gets dirty and people bring the bucket or when people start to wrestle guns away from you.... actually until you get the guys wet, if the girls dominate, well it's all hell from there. Funny how that works.  Another note to self: SPOONS is a very bad card game and I should never play it 'cause I will never realize when people take the spoons, I'll just keep on playing no matter how hard I try to pay attention... I guess that goes back to my add.... oh well.... And I'm off to the movies in my basement! Whoa! : )~Kati

       My day was super boring, I watched tv probably about 3/4 of the day if not more. But tv is always good so I can't complain too much. I also got an mri on my ankle today, it took like 20-30 min to actually like get it complete and it is soooo loud. But it's cool 'cause they give you like a headset and play the radio for you except it wasn't loud enough to cover up the noise of the mri.... hey if anyone knows how mri's work email me at chickass31@aol.com ......But ya so I was laying on the bed thing and listening to the radio and I almost fell asleep, but then it ended. Oh man so after the mri I went to target and I got fricken school supplies!!! That was seriously depressing, it's august and I just got school supplies, but then I shouldn't be too depressed about that 'cause I have already turned in hw.  Ha so tonight I am happy to saw that I kicked Nick's ass in wrestling...... well I think I did, so ya I win!! whoa go me! Ok tata! : )~Kati

       Today I woke up at 9:15, earliest I've waken up for like a week...... it was sad! To make it worse I had to get up and go to a meeting for the school newspaper to get article assignments, that actually wasn't that bad, and I got a good article, but still, it's early! Haha it was funny because it was early for me and I was driving I ran a fricken red light!! I didn't mean to, but ya I was looking like straight ahead and I noticed the cars were going and then I was deciding if I should switch lanes and then Leah and Janelle were like.... uhhhh kati.... you're running a red light... and then I like screamed and freaked out and I'm like geez good thing no one saw it.... and they're like well uhh we did..... highlight of my day right there. I saw American Pie 2 today, it was good and now I'm excited to go see American Wedding! That movies funny, but it makes me wonder, do all guys really think like that and are all guys really that horny? Ha oh yes the most likely are, ha oh well! More fun for me.... wink wink... ha no. Oh ya another highlight! I finally finished the bad of marshmellows that I opened like last week or the week before... I've been the only one eating them and I've been eating them plan, they're really good you'd be surprised, and I finished them today! Whoa! Ok I don't feel like being all sentimental and shit like that today so I'm not gonna get all this is how I feel and get deep about shit.... to tierd! I'm off to bed! : )~Kati

       Top 10 Rules For Guys and liking me: 1- Don't be constantly CONSTANTLY all over me, sometimes oh hell ya, but not all the time 2- Please be my friend for awhile before anything really happens 3- Yes buying stuff for me is  acceptable, but not when we've hung out once and only talked on the phone 4- Don't constantly CONSTANTLY be saying that I'm so fricken hot, it's flattering, yes, but gets annoying after awhile 5- Don't laugh at every fricken thing 6- Like my friends even if you don't know them 7- When I ask you how the movie was, don't say "I don't know I wasn't watching it." 8- Just be there to have FUN with me, not to have sex with me..... ok that's not implying that I've had sex... I haven't 9- Don't be obsessive  10- Have more of a sense of humor than sarcastic, and be FUN and FUNNY! Oy ya that was a review of tonight, don't get me wrong, I had a good night, I just need to figure a few things out on what I want to happen and what I don't. So again today I went job hunting with Megan and Janelle, I ended up getting no job applications this time, that was depressing, but I did turn one in!! Yeah!

       Why is it when your 15 you're like ok I have one more year until I can get a good job, but then when you are 16 you wish you were 18 so you get a even better job or I guess just a job for that matter? Oy, well at least that's why I'm having problems getting a fricken job! And guess what?! The Disney Store is hiring! I wanna work there so bad, but ya you have to be 18! I personally think that's bullshit. yes forgive me I said SHIT! Muh haha. Ha and ya I applied to Fanny Farmer that chocolate store today, wow if I work there I better not get fat, that would be a funny job though.  I'm gonna try this paragraph stuff today, okay? haha that rthyms... how do you spell that? oh man.  So from now on I quit all sports and am only gonna focus on one.... FOOSBALL! I figure that if I spend all my time at the foosball table then one day I'll eventually get good enough to beat Freddie or even Nick! Wow if I beat one of them, that would be the day! But no really I suck balls at that game except today when I was playing with Emir against Nick and Joesphine I scored 10 goals, ok 9 Nick scored one for us, it was amazing and ya we won! Whoa! Ya and that right there was the highlight of my day! Oh ya and writing essays suck, except now I'm done even though I'm like 147 words OVER, yes OVER, but yeah I'm happy! FINALLY DONE WITH SUMMER HW, ha or not 'cause on Tues I get the Echo assignment! Yeah!  : )~Kati

       So it's been awhile! Oopsy, I forget.... I even forgot my username and it's only been like 2 weeks, how sad is that? So I think I have figured out this whole guy situation... I don't know if anything is actually gonna work out, but meh. See this one guy is just in it for the ass and I know it so I'm done with him. I just have to be able to feel a little more comfortable with this other guy until anything happens and I just want or wish that like he'd fit into my group or we could work that out some way. I don't mind being it just the 2 of us, but I love my group! Oh ya so some news I now have to get an mri on my ankle and if it's what the doc thinks it is... I may have to have surgrey!! yeah! or not. It sucks, but what am I gonna do? Ok never sprain your ankle that is my advice to you for today! Haha ok so Janelle and I had like a 30 min, if not longer, walk today, that was fun and it's funny 'cause it's like the most excersie I've gotten in like a week! haha oh well, but ya it was really nice out when we first started walking but man then it got really humid! So I watched the Final Destination 2 today, man it's pretty freaky, it really makes you think, how the hell are we all gonna die? and when is it gonna happen? and ya if you do cheat out on death is it bound to come right back at you? I almost believe 'cause I believe in fate.... what happens is meant to, if you die you were meant to... man it gets confusing and I better stop thinking about it now 'cause damn, I'll never get off the subject. Ok so I was gonna say something, but I forgot, man I hate it when that happens. Oh ya so I have 458 words written for my essay that is due on monday! I have to have a total of 750-1200 words! It's exciting, haha no, I'm like falling asleep writing this paper, and ya that's sad 'cause then it must really suck, but hey it's on America at 1750! Couldn't get worse than that! Ok I go now! : )~Kati

       Basically as of 9:17 when people left my house, it ended. My summer ended and that is really depressing. Offically school starts at 7:55 but for me tomorrow it offically starts at 7:00, ouch.   Last night, in Chelsea's tent, haha yes we slept in a tent in her backyard, Leah and I were saying how we're gonna trying having as much fun as possible this school and were saying that the weeknights we don't have any hw we're gonna go out for sure and do stuff and have a sleep over even though it's a on a school night. And then I just kinda laughed at it all sadly 'cause like seriously that's never gonna happen. Leah's taking all IB classes while I'm taking all AP, IB, and well advanced classes, so combined I really doubt they'll be one day where neither of us have hw it sad. But ya we were saying how high school and been our age is supposed to be the most fun of our lives and we're supposed to have the least amount of responsibility right now, but it sucks 'cause we're spending this amount of time where were supposed to have fun doing hw! Seriously even in the summer we got hw and the summer is your free time! It's not fair and really is it gonna help us in life? Is hw gonna make us learn any better? School is meant for teaching students and making them learn, that is the point of teachers, so if they give us hw does that mean they're not teaching us? 'cause hw you do independtly without a teacher so clearly you're teaching yourself without the teacher. I don't think school is being used what it was meant for anymore 'cause now they're taking away our life and morals and well fun! I could learn the same amount if I just did hw or just learned in class, I don't need both things.  Now I'm getting a job too, so weeknights I'll be doing about 5 hours of hw average and then weekends I'll be mostly working. I'm going to start to lose my social life which is depressing and well ya I'm not gonna have like any fun anymore!!! Jr. year is supposed to be one of the most fun years too! Oy, what have I gotten myself into.   On a lighter note, I was thinking about how people get amussed. Like the most fun I had today with Nick, Emir, and Kate was when we were driving and Nick had my monkey puppet and was sticking out the window and when ever someone walked by we'd yell look at monkey!! And then we stalked a running group with it, but ya we laughed so hard and it's really sad 'cause we're 16 and that's where we get our fun. And like pranking? People think that's halarious and it is, but seriously it's so werid to think about what actually makes us have the most fun, you can't just sit there with all your friends and have fun, you can't just watch a movie and really have, it's take effort I tell ya. But seriously having any little bit of fun makes any day, or life.   The time has come, life for me has ended, and a new one has started. The hw obsessive freak that'll never have any time for anything anymore, wow that's painful to say. But yes I do have to warn you that these blogs won't come as often anymore..... I wont have time to entertain all you out there reading this, which who knows is. So for now, please when you have fun dedicate it to me and think of me, and yes I will be back to write again!

       Ok first off it's been awhile, yes I know.... so things may be a bit rusty, but hey I'm a busy person now that schools started, so give me a fricken bone here! ha!  People are weird. Not just certain individuals, but everyone, ever single person is weird..... if you're normal you're weird and if you're weird that still doesn't make you normal 'cause well that's werid. Sure this is a general statement, but really think about it, people really are strange.    To be more specific on people being weird is when it comes to guys and girls and humanitary rituals. Like how one portrays themselve towards another and how people can change so much towards the opposite zex.... if that's the way you flow,  ha. I'm not saying I don't change towards around guys, but I'm still myself, I don't act like I'm someone else, I'm the same me with maybe a couple modifications. But what I'm really trying to get across is why do people put up these fronts and change to please someone? What's the point of changing yourself to please someone else? Obviously if you have to change the way you are in the first place they're too shallow to be involved with you or even be your friend.   When someone gets mad at you also for being self-involved and askes you to not ditch your friends anymore and shit like that, don't suck up to them, if you care, change your ways and really let them know that you care, don't just change 'cause someone is mad.   Another question is why do people start ditching they're close friends when they get a boyfriend or girlfriend. You don't even know how possibly fed up I am with all of it. Ya cool I'm happy for you for having someone, I could actually be jealous, but I want one too, but no you don't just start ditching the people you've hung out with like every single weekend for like ever to hang out with this one person. So far 3 of my once closest friends have drifted into this pool of blood, well ok 1 has completely.... I used to tell this guy EVERYTHING and ya he liked me like more then a friend, but I just didn't see us like that, but I didn't think that hurt anything... anywho he does get a girlfriend and our once talking on the phone every night and hanging out every other day.... all that's gone to like him saying "what up" or "what's crackin" something not even amusing to me anymore, in the hall. And then my other really close friend, he just started to change so much, he changed this summer before he had a girlfriend, but not everything is coming out of him and it's really hard to see how he's actually feeling or thinking. Then there's like one of my best friends, she has been totally cool with handling this guy, who is also one of my good friends, but now she's starting to drift, for the first time, she has like canceled plans and not called us for him. And ya it's once whatever, but you can tell what might happen in the future, and because 2 of my really close friends have already done that too me, I don't want to see it happen again.   I'm thinking all my thoughts have gone down the drain, I really don't remember what I was saying like 2 sec. ago.... that's my add kickin in for ya.....  Lets see new subject.... lets do face expressions. Although I know nothing of this topic here are my thoughts on what you can tell from peoples eyes and well expressions.  First, thanks to scott, I am going to talk about the eyes. Eyes are the one thing that you can tell people by. You can't tell who they really are by what they say or what they do, 'cause ya like I said before people can be very superficial and make shit up. But really if you watch a persons eyes and just look in them, you can see right through them, you really can. I haven't looked to  hard obviously with how I've been going in relationships.... but if someone can't even look you in the eyes for instance, then they're liars, they don't really care. Ok I really can't stay on this subject.  Just want to say that we gain an hour of sleep tonight or get to stay up for an extra hour, and ya we got our first snow, now that scares me. There are people I think howling across my street at... 1:00 or ok 12:00 in the morning... how odd.   But ya I can say something about snow! Ok so snow I really like, but really hate. It's so pretty and refreshing, especially when there's sun, and ya then there's the holidays and excitement and snowmen and snowballs, which do hurt by the way, but then it's really depressing. When I think of pretty lights down town with the snow falling of course it reminds me of happy couples strolling down the side walk and then of course I'm then sitting there thinking oh god damnit this is the perfect time to have a boyfriend and of I don't! It just makes you that much more pissed off when I don't have a guy, which is often. But then again all seasons do that too me. Snow is really cold too and I don't do that well when it comes to cold.  And this has got exceedingly long so I'm gonna leave you all with this quote to think about:   Follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.  muah!

       So instead of doing homework right now, which I should really be doing.... I'm gonna write in my good ol' blog while I'm pissed off and have thoughts in my head.   First off..... why they hell do I always like look for compliments but when I get them turn them down and not actually take them to heart? Like seriously I realized during hockey today that I don't really feel like I've accomplished anything at all in that sport because I don't feel like I get enough praise for the coaches or something, I feel like I always get the shaft... but when I am praised by other people I'm like ya right shutup you're only doing that to make me feel better. Then I just get really frusurated and obviously don't get any better. I just wanna tell ya'll that if you ever give me a compliment some how and I like totally reject it's only because I'm immensly screwed up in the head and vitorolic about like everything. I thank you for all the compliments if given but I just need to get whatever thing that's in me keeping anything from entering out.   I know I have to keep everything my own and not compare myself to anyone 'cause obviously we're all different people in every single way. But I do, when it comes to grades and being smart and playing hockey... I compare myself and I'm like dude I suck. That might also be a reason for me being so bitter to accepting compliaments. I just wanna live in a life where there is no stress about anything.  I wish I was 3 again... or in John Mayers song I was I was 6 again. Seriously if you think about it there was like no stress in our lives at all during that age, sure we may have had our temper tantrums but who cares we got over that in like a second and the only reason we acted in such a manner was because we most likely didn't get what we wanted, which clearly isn't related to what stress really is and doesn't fall under that topic. At that age you don't have to worry about school and college and what you want to do with your life. You don't have to worry about having a boyfriend or wanting a boyfriend, hell when you're 3 or 6 we're all basically little sluts messin around with all those little boys out there.... of your you guys you're the ones messin around with us and getting us to like you by calling as stupid (which actually still works to this very day at this very age, ha). But seriously if you can name one thing when you're that age that actually stresses you out I'd like to know, because life is a dream at the age, it's all to yourself and the future and sports and well life is not a problem. For one day I just wish I could focus on just that day, well no, on just that minute during that day, no thoughts about anything else, just what is happening, just like a 3 yr old. I want to go back to playing with my barbies I want to go back watching raffe... I want to go back to fairy tale land and not have to worry my life away. One simple day like that to get away from everything would possibly save me from a total breakdown some day.   I just want to accel in one thing, really be the best at one thing, I want to be really smart or really good at all sports, but really right now I'm just somewhat smart, and somewhat good at sports. I'm really not complaining about that, I'm fine with being where I'm at, it's just that it gets to me when everything I'm in there's someone better then me, I guess that also has to go along with me being so competitive.   I know I've probably got all my ideas from fairy tales and chick flicks 'cause I'm waiting for that perfect moment, perfect time, perfect guy, perfect kiss, and well perfect life. I have come to reality and have realized that is not going to happen, but if I were to have one wish, and to live it for a day, that would be it. But truely life is good, and I really can't complain, the only time I could is if I was dying or one of those kids in like Ethiopia that have malnutrition and dying of starvation. I just wish certain things would evaporate into the air and dissapear from my life forever. But while I'm hear wishing I should probably go to studying for ap us and doing all my hw, oh joy.  From the quote of the day: "The only way to enjoy anything in this life is to earn it first."  : )~KTO

       Moods and emotions blow. Or ok Sundays blow because you're stuck in the house all day doing homework and well thinking. At least that's how it is for me. I did get to go to Noodles today with Kate though and that was fun, it's funny 'cause we're incredibly losers. Especially when together.  Ok so I'm soooooo lost on how I feel about anything and everything. I don't know what I want. I know i'm indesive and I know I have to ask opinions of everyone, but still I just wish that would all just go away and leave me alone! I wish decisions were easy to make and didn't have an effect on yourself or other people. I wish you could really just explain yourself and be understood by other people and by well yourself. I have no idea what to think anymore.  I basically confuse the shit out of myself 'cause I really contradict my feelings. I say that I want a boyfriend, which I do, but then when I have the oppurtunity I think I get scared or something. Actually no, it's that I get stuck on an idea and on a person and when someone presents to me as a relationship type of guy, but they aren't exactly this idea.... then I don't know I just try to find as many things as possible wrong with them or get certain annoyances with them. I don't know, I just really don't know. I'm addicted to a certain touch and routine and when I'm not getting that by someone then it's just not right. I'm immediately drawn to this touch and emotion whenever it is presented in front of me and once it happens once, I just can't stop thinking about it. I'm stuck.  I have come to the conclusion and that I'm stuck with emotions for 5 years back, once something effects me, good or bad, it stays within me and everything else that wants to proceed into my life is hard to stand a chance when dealing with these feelings. I want to live in my own little world where eveything can happen right for me, but I'm not and I need to get over that. I need to wake up from my dream and face reality and realize the people and things I strive for aren't always going to happen and I'm not always going to win the fight. I need to experience the unexperienced within myself and even if there is an uncertianty somewhere I need to get over it and notice that there's always going to be one little mistake, one little flaw. It's just that that one flaw can either be disastorous or unnoticeable at all.   I'm just so confused with everything and I'm just really glad hockey is starting so it can take my mind off of everything, off of life, off of homework, off of guys. I think I really just need time to myself to figure it out. I hate feeling like I have to make a choice 'cause I just go by the flow, I don't plan shit and I don't like shit planning around me. I'm just sorry if I do hurt anyone in the process, including myself, and I just hope everyone understands.

       So I wrote another blog a couple of weeks ago..... but it somehow got deleted so I gave up on blogging for a bit, I know I'm sorry to keep ya'll waiting, haha, but ya I couldn't face my fears of entering a blog for awhile. But here I am once again.  Anywho as you see by my lovely title, today's topic is going to be on weather and how it's changed and how it really does effect us all. Weather is a lot more powerful then just keeping you inside on a summer day.   Weather effects your mood. In the winter I tend to notice, and I'm sure everyone else does too, how people get a lot moodier and a lot more depressed in the winter. Part of this could be the seasonal defect disorder or something of that sort, but ya if it's cloudy for a month you're bond to get crabby, that's just how it goes. That's why winter is such a pain, not only do girls have to deal with pms, but in the winter when it's cold and cloudy and you're pmsing at the same time, wow dang. That's all I have to say.   Winter also can make you happy and cheerful due to the holidays. I know at this time of year it's supposed to be joyous and giving and everyone thinks of their family and friends, which is true. Winter can make you think of the good moments and especially those kick ass times that you had as a kid building snow forts and throwing snow balls.... I haven't quite gotten over that one though. But along with the holidays I really think it makes people wish for things they don't have..... which is obviously a depressing moment. Like for me the winter makes me want a boyfriend.... but really any season does, haha. But ya in my situation right now I could have boyfriend and be really happy at these times, but I'm just so confused on everything and life and how my brain really works, plus do I really have time for one? Ok ok sorry I can't get off subject.   Winter also means hockey season for me and well if your from park you better be hella excited 'cause we're going to state again! Guys and girls!!! But anywho I got my hockey schedule yesterday and damn. We already have 11 games before winter break and we have 20 regular season games. But including our winter tournament and sections and if we get to state.... we could have up to probably like 30 games if not ore.... that is if we got all the way. Without state and one section game we'll have like 25. But ya I now realzied how I'm gonna have like no time on my hands what so ever. Hockey will control my life and then I'll have a whole shitload of hw like always and then starting in either janurary or feburary I'll be starting winter league lacrosse. Sure winter is kick as time for sports, but damn time in that is that key word.   Winter is also very very cold and well I don't do too well in the cold, I freeze in like a second and then you got the dry skin and frizzy hair and it's really hard to look good in the winter 'cause well at least for me I always wanna wear sweatpants and sweatshirts to keep warm!!! Warm showers and fluffy covers and hot chocolate and fires are a plus in the winter though too.   In conclusion, besides the few good things here and there..... I have great abomination for the winter and it's basically an interloper in my life. So unless I have a guy to ingratiate with or something really gets me in a fermented state.... I'd rather just go from fall to spring and skip the whole Minnesotan weather.  This has been brought to you by the quote of the day:  Risk! Risk anything!

       I miss having sleepovers when I was like 10, it would consist of playing with barbies, eating popcorn, and watching a PG movie or being a rebel and watching a PG-13 one. And if you didn't fall asleep during the movie you would stay up for like 10 minutes talking about the crush you have on that guy that sits kiddy corner from you who always makes fun of you. Now they consist of your problems with people and the problems you yourself have and analyzing people. Way to complicated for me.   All I've been thinking about these last two days are how shallow people can be though, or how like spolied and greedy we all are. Christmas and the holidays are supposed to make you really happy and joyous and it's the time for giving, but honestly all I could think about when I opened the gifts was what have we come to when all we do is recieve more money and more shit from our parents? I know I'm greedy and want all this and keep it all, but I don't need it and it almost hurts to accept a gift when I should just send all the money over to some place that doesn't have anything. And then if I get a gift and dont' like it I feel even worse 'casue it's like they were trying to be gracious and benevolent and I'm turning them or it down because I simply don't like it because "it's not my style" or "it's stupid." No, I just hate what everything has come down to. Trust me the holidays have been great, but I almost see no purpose in it for me and I don't like it. I feel an emptiness in me because I seriously don't have a point to celebrating anything. I also celebrate Hannukah, but I have no purpose in that either. I'm glad that I'm not freakishly religious, but I really do wish I had a religious background of some sort because half my family is jewish, the other half christian, and then I'm just there not having really any beliefs in anything and not knowing or feeling anything for the holidays. I guess it's just kind of frusturating.   Know what I realized? That half the people I like or have liked is not because of their personality, well it is, but most of the reasons that I've liked people a lot are because of the connection I've had with them. If I have a great feeling with someone, a great connection with someone and not anyone else, it's going to be hard for me to get rid of that feeling when I don't have it with anyone else. That's also a reason why it takes me so fricken long for me to get over someone. If I feel like I'm over them for like a week and haven't seen them for awhile, right when I see them again or anything, that connection is back and I like them again. Wow, things work in odd ways.   So sno daze is coming up on Feb. 14. Of course it's valentines day. Which ya is a good day to have a dance, but also very bad because then you want a date and you want a date that you like. If you come with a guy who's just a friend to this dance it's gonna be kinda odd, 'cause well it's valentines day. Enough said. All this means, that I'm going to have to think about who the hell I want to go with, which really I almost don't care, just someone good, and then I have to think about a dress. Wow, I hate dresses, but love them at the same time, they're kinda like guys in a sense. But I'm sick of wearing the big formal dresses to this dance, I know it's likt he most formal besides prom, but I want to do something different, I want something that's comfertable but looks really good and something that know one else will think of. I want my own style for this dance. It's either that or I'm borrowing a dress from someone which may be hard 'cause my ass is bigger than all my friends.... or ya I don't know maybe I'll be different for prom. Just wait and see. But ya and FYI, I do need a date if you didn't notice.   I offically hate school even more because they give you homework on your BREAK which really then isn't a break. I don't want to go back to that place. Good thing I have another week.   It's really weird when you're online and your sisters at a friends online and then they talk to you and tell you that they're all drunk and that your sister is passed out with a guy. And then when you realize it most likely really did happen, it's even weirder. This is funny, and kind of sad, but really seeing that I'm a good girl for the most part and have only drinken on my cruise, I really would want to get piss drunk with my friends now, just to have the experience. Yes I know this was all very random, but kiss my ass, ya'll know that you want to too if you haven't already. Plus I think I'm somewhat starting to become a rebel, yes me, because ya stress does weird shit to ya, it really does. But don't worry, ten bucks nothing happens.

       First off I am going to say that The Return of the King or the 3rd Lord of the Rings, is the pimpest movie ever and even though it's 3 hours and 15 minutes long and has like 5 endings, it's still the best movie ever and ya'll should go see it. And if you hadn't noticed, I just saw that movie, and I didn't fall asleep or leave the theater once, which ya'll should know is an accomplishment for me.   Ok so throughout the movie, and well I think about this randomly a lot too, why do some words stick out in peoples heads more than others? Why are somethings funny, somethings sad, and somethings boring? Like really how do somethings attract to some people but not others? I don't really know where I'm going with with this, but it's randomly poped up in my head a lot and it's just weird how one person can see something and other can't. It's not just like that in movies or comedy, but in life and in people. How can one person see a quality that one may pocess and another not? Why do some people laugh at others jokes and others not? I don't get it, but maybe it was something I or anyone else will never know. I think it's that I just thought to much about it and ya this is where it has lead me.  And ya I'm sure most of it has to deal with your personality too, if you're a shallow person or well-rounded, if you like to have fun or sulk all the time. Who knows.  There's one thing that I must say is very weird. Usually when it's winter break I like jump for joy and am excited about it every second of the day. But this year it's different, I feel more overwhelmed then ever and almost more stress because it's like here's two weeks to take a break and have fun, but I'm not thinking about that, all I can think about is how much shit I have to get done this break and how I have like 5 essays to write, but really don't want to because Iw ant to spend 2 seconds of my life not thinking about homework or school. It's crazy but I honestly had a dream about my college writing paper and then during the movie randomly the thought of my paper came up too. I think it makes me more pissed off that we have a break, because for me it's really not a break, it's a time to catch up on everything that I've missed and start and finish things that need to be done. I also have to figure out when to get all my presents done by  and deal with hockey and soon lacrosse. Things just don't seem right anymore, they just don't flow and I don't know how to approach it anymore, I honestly don't. I know I say this all the time, but I just want to live one day without any worries or complaints or stress, just one day.  I'm tired though and I'm see this all turning into shit soon 'cause I can't think and barely remember the last word I just wrote. So ya night!   Make a true estimate of your own ability, then raise it ten percent.   Kati

       My mind is having a revolution of some sort I swear. It was just last week or like 3 days ago where I hated everything and was pissed off at so much and at myself. I was sick and I didn't feel like I was going to get better and I had so much homework too, I was so stressed out and I didn't want to deal with anything at all.   Now, I'm starting to get back on track. Not only am I feeling like ten times better, but I'm actually really happy again. I think I have more positive thoughts then negatives thoughts for the first time in a long time. Ya sure I still hate school and feel like I suck in that area, but I'm gaining confidence in hockey and that is helping soooooo much. I've been playing first line and working my ass off and just the accomplishment I give myself is really all I need.   Basically, I'm starting to do things on my own and actually stick up for myself. Sorry if I get pissy at you or anything or yell at you, but I'm just sick of so much shit that is so unnessicary to begin with.  It's so much added stress that I clearly don't need, so now I'm done with taking everything I get from people in and I'm not letting people treat me like I have no feelings because seriously I'm probably one of the most emotional people I know. I'm done with people making me feel like I'm the size of an ant and stepping up to the plate and addressing the issue. No more Mr. Nice Guy or Mrs. Nice Girl anymore.  Actually, I'm being way more positive on everything, I'm looking towards the positive side and going from there. From now on if people aren't giving me support, I'm going to tell them, and well I already kind of had. I'm one of those people who can get all the support from people they can get otherwise I have no confidence level at all. I'm also addressing issues not only that I have but multiple people have and trying to change something that should be changed and should be more positive.  I'm no longer going to be affected by other people or my negative thoughts and try my best to do my best and not get down on myself so much because that's one thing that I can get my hands on and change to make my life one step easier.  Although I'm still like totally utterly confused about my life and where it's going and about guys and what I really want, I feel like I've finally gotten a grip on my life to make it really go where I want it to go. I have more control over what I can do then what I can't do and what I believe I can do then what I believe I can't do. But hey you never know all this positiveness has really just come out of my ass and I may be bitching again in a week.

       I think my world has revolved around Sesame Street this past quarter. For those of you who don't know I am writing my 14 page college writing paper on how Sesame Street has impacted education and children. Anywho I have never felt so much like I've repeatedly written the same thing over and over, there are like 2 main ideas and 2 main points, but other then that nothing.  I have gotten a lot of quotes from the books and I must say that looking at all those pictures and singing along to the songs do make me of so happy! I am now here to pass some of these fabulous quotes along.  "Smarter than a speeding bullet furrier than a powerful locomotive    able to leap tall sandwiches ina single bound!!! Look... up in the sky! It's an eggplant! It's a meatball! It's... SUPERGROVER!"    "We superheroes bruise easily, you know." -Supergrover.  "Me love to look out the window at night. See all the pretty stars- twinkle, twinkle. You know what moon remind me of? It remind me of great, big, delicious cookie!" -Cookie Monster  "I love pigeons more than anything else in this world- besides oatmeal." -Bert  The best song ever: Rubber Duckie. Rubber Duckie you're the one, you make bathtime lots of fun. Rubber Duckie, I'm awfully fond of you yo-yo-dee-o. Rubber Duckie joy of joys, when I squeeze you, you make noise, rubber duckie you're my very best friend it's true. And I can continue, but I'll pass.  So right now instead of doing homework I am sitting here telling you about Sesame Street which is said to be very educational. If that is case then I have just contradicted that statement by making myself, and probably you too, dumber. In fact, throughout this whole research paper, I think it has been reading about puppets and chosing my favorite one at the age of 16 that has probably wasted my time more then anything, but then again if you read those quotes and see how random they are, everyone should understand why I stay amused.   I am now going to leave you with a song most everyone should know: Sesame Street. Sunny Day, sweepin' the clouds a way. On my way to where the air is sweet- Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street? Come and play ev'ry thinks a o-kay. Friendly neighbors there thats where we meet- Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame street?  And clearly this is a valid question, I would truely like to know how to get to Sesame Street, and well how to find a 3rd fricken book on it!! Seriously there are only 2 and I have them both!! Hahaha! Anywho if you know how to get to Sesame Street, please tell me!  KOakes

       I seriously feel like I have lived my whole life wanting something so bad that I can't have or will never get. I feel like I've set goals for myself that can never be accomplished by me. I know people say "if you want something so bad, you'll get it" but it's not always true. For somethings I want I'm just not smart enough to get it, really I'm not, I think I may be sometimes because I have unbelieveably smart friends, but I need to realize I'm not one of those people. I also need to realize that I don't have money and my mom isn't made of money so I can't always get what I want it when comes to that sense. I just need to live in reality for like a day see things for how they really are.  On a side note though, yesterday, Saturday, has been the first good day I've had in like a billion years, ok so I exaggerate, but still. I've been sick for way too long and I've been sooooooo stressed out it's not even funny. I don't have time to sit down and relax with all the homework I have and hockey. But ya with hockey. It's been weird 'casue ever since I got sick I've been playing better, besides one game, which really shouldn't be the case 'cause I'm like hacking up who knows what while on the ice.... maybe that's scaring all the opponets away. But anywho yesterday we had a hockey game against Minnetonka, and ya right when I got to the rec my coach was like how do you feel and I'm like a lot better actually, I got 12 hours of sleep. So ya we don't have set lines on our team, but like right before warm ups the coach told us the lines, and ya she's like Oakes is with Frankie and Keseley..... and ya that would be first line, and I got to start with them and everything. It was tight and I've seriously never played so much in a game in my life and I actually could keep up and play hockey. It felt sooooo good! Playing how I did yesterday and not caring if I felt like I was gonna die, but just kept on going is what I love, and that just really makes me feel like I have a purpose of playing hockey adn that I don't suck.  How come you can feel so comfortable in someones arms, but not in someone elses? Seriously with all the guys that I've had like potential relationships with or what not, there's only been one guy that I've truely felt happy and comfortable with. I don't wanna leave their arms once I'm in them, I just wanna be like that forever. But the bad thing is this guy I know isn't good for me, he's not what I need, but what I want. There's so many issues between us and so many trust issues I have with him and our past has had so many ups, but probably more downs. I know all this, but when I'm with him it all leaves me. My heart takes over and my head isn't even there at that point. I still think that it's possible for soemthing to change in him and for something to happen, and ya it might, but I feel and think that every time, and it never happens. I want to be able to drift away from him and just say no leave me alone to him, but I can't. At this point I don't think it's possible for me to just walk away. I want to be with him and I don't even know why. All I know is that this feeling I get makes me so happy and makes me feel so good that I just don't want it to end. I just want him to know that when I'm in his arms and he kisses my head is different then anything else and any other feeling and I just want to stay in that moment with him forever. I want this so bad, but at the same time I know it'll probably just cause me more stress and trouble then before, but I just can't break out of it. I haven't been able to for a year. If anyone has any suggestions please tell me 'cause I'm stuck on him, I can't get over him and again he's something that I want, but probably can never have. But really when you want something so bad and you just can't let go, but you can never have it, when does that feeling of trying to obtain that one thing ever go away? If it's soemthing you strive for and wish for that completes your life how do you just let go of it like it's never had an impact on your life and it's never been apart of your life and it's never been half the reason you stay sane? I just can't do it.  Follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.  -joesph campbell  : )~KTO

       So I'm writing this blog for all of you people who actually read my blog and who have told me that I haven't written in it for awhile. Actually no, I'm writing this blog on a Friday night at 10:45 (I've actually been online since 10) because I'm to busy dying and being miserable to do anything else. I suppose I could sleep, but my mom needs to come home with the cough medicince first, ha.   I've never felt so shity in my life. Maybe I have, but it's been a fricken long time since. Fevers and having the flu, for one, are obviously horrible, ya they only last like 3 days, but those 3 days, you can't move. I had spent 3 days this week sitting, actually no lying down on my couch, attempting to watch tv litterally the whole day. I'd wake up at like 12 and go from my bed to down stairs and then the only time I would get up is when I had to go to the bathroom and then at like 11 I'd crawl back upstairs to my bed. In 3 days I also had about one meal. I actually lost like 5 pounds from that, healthy eh?   So if that wasn't bad enough, I just happen to get it right after thanksgiving break, which some may say is good, 'cause you don't want to be sick during your break, but really for me, you do. Seeing that I got sick right after, I of course missed 3 days of school in a row. Missing 3 total of the school year, that's ok, but 3 in one week? Hell no. I now have so much to learn and of course by myself and so much extra to do. Plus I have hockey on top of all that and ya I missed a game and then like 2 practices. I played last night and I'm playing tomorrow, but now i'm playing when I'm sick, not helping me get any better.   Warning next paragraph may be graphic.   I don't know if this usually happens, but ya after my flu I then took on symptoms of a cold. Colds are the most inconvience things ever, you feel like shit and odn't want to do anything, but you have to because it's "just a cold." But today, right now, I don't feel like this is any regular cold. My cough is what is driving me insane, literally insane. It's not normal, I cough 'cause I have all this crap in my chest and throat and what not, except when I breath in like deep, like most do before they cough I get like this fucked up cough like something like a hairball is coming out of me!!! It sounds gross and trust me it feels 10 times worse. And with that I stilll can't get the cough I need to make my throat or whatever stop itching! So it's an ongoing cycle of coughing and never accomplishing what the cough was meant to do. They only thing it has done is make my head feel like it's going to explode and then drive me nuts.   With everything, I also get really dizzy sometimes and I have been so out of it I forget what I was going to do or what I have to do in like a second. I can't function right now and all I want to do is get stuff done and feel  better again!!! I have barely even laugh since I've been sick, I really can't 'cause then I start coughing. All I know is that I was stressed out before I was sick and now.... whoa. This is going to be fun.  Lifes a bitch.

       Tonight I just talked to this guy I met on my cruise last spring break. Wow that was weird, but now I remember how cool he was and how much fricken fun it was on the cruise, I wish I was back there, I wish I had never left. Ok no this guy was not like my "lover" on the cruise, he's my sisters age and we met him and hung out with him until like 4 in the morning like every nice. Seriously though he is so cool, there needs to be more people like him in this world. First of all he is hott, he is damn fine and he could probably get a lot of girls, and ya there was like this one group of girls that were really good looking that he met, but he didn't hang out with them, but he hung out with us.... he thought they were too immature, shallow, and what not. He didn't care about getting ass or about looks, but he just wanted people who would have fun, in their own way, and that was us. Seriously I didn't even think he would want to hang out with us 'cause we would spend our time like playing cards or just sitting in the hot tub or sitting in our room watching movies. But he joined us. I remember one night we were sitting outside at like 12 in the morning and there were ash trays out and those stirring sticks for coffee, and there was hot chocolate and napkins too... ya so of course I had matches to go along with all that too.... ok yes I'm getting to the point. So ya we stock up on hotchocolate and spill all over and then I grabbed like tons of those sticks and napkins and then we stuck them in the ash tray thing. And then I lit it on fire! We had like a mini bon fire going, it was tight and then we had to put it out with like 2 cups of water. The next day all the ash trays and hot water and sticks and napkins and hot chocolate were gone. There was another night when we were in key west flordia and we weren't leaving until like 5 in the morning so we strolled around key west at like 2 in the morning and just sat around and walked around watching all the drunks and watching for fights to happen. Another night we watched Harry Potter 2 in our room at like 2 in the morning and Eric, the guy feel asleep on the floor watching it so we took a ballon and poped in his ear and freaked the shit out of him. Then like 2 sec later Katie feel asleep and we wrote on her face and put toothpast on her face, it was great. Wow that was fun, fun fun fun. Eric also goes to the airforce academy and wrestles and plays football there, it's tight.   I've decided to make these blogs shorter because I'm sure people lose intrest less then half way through if it's a billion words long. I have so much more to talk about tonight though and I didn't even do anything. I guess I'll have to save it for tomorrow for the interest of my people.   We will BEAT EDINA tomorrow, I promise.   k

       I am so glad and so happy to say that 1st semester is over!!!!! That was the most hellish semester and like period of my life, wow. Seriously though I've never had to work that hard in my life and read so much and think so much. It's crazy what school does to you and how stressed out it makes you, seriously do we really need an education that much? I don't feel like I do. Oh well. So instead of college writing 2 and honors english, I now have outdoor photo and a study hall, that cuts my workload in half and wow am I going to be happy when I can actually finish all of my homework and read all my packets. I'm hoping for a little change in my grades..... ok more like a big change.   What pisses me off about this last semester and school is that I feel like I worked my ass off, but it doesn't show so much. Like yes I could have done more work and I could have stayed up until one every night to actually do all my homework and study for every class, but I can't do that, I fall asleep at like 11. But I still feel liek I put in a substantial amount of work, but it still wasn't good enough for me. My grades aren't too bad, but I still think they suck, oy I don't know. I just feel like everything that I work for and actually want to do good in and try to do good in, blows up in my face at the end. Like seriously this week I have never felt so much like a failure. I studied my ass off like since saturday and didn't do anything at all and then I take the tests and I feel like I failed them all, like seriously I'm sure I did. It's the worst feeling ever to feel like you have worked so hard to get to this one point and to accomplish so much and when the time actually comes it's like no you can't do good, you can't accomplish everything you want to. It's not only school though, hockey too. I'm probably making a bigger deal about it then it is, but it still pisses me off. I've been playing first line for like 5 weeks or more and then I got a concussion on saturday, played like shit that game anyways, and then found out I coudlnt' play in our game on tues. that sucked. Anywho, now someone else is playing first line and it's total bullshit 'cause I work my ass off ten times more then she does, and she even told me she doesn't want to play 1st line!! And then brandi and other people on the team are like kati I do'nt know why you're not playing 1st, you deserve it more than anyone. I don't know maybe things will change for the game this sat., I hope they do 'cause I have been working so hard to get to that spot and I finally did and then after being out for a day, one day, it's taken away from me like that, wow that sure feels good.....  I'm so sick of complaining though, yes I am stressed, yes I work my ass off and barely get a break, but I put myself in the position of working so hard, I can stop, but I don't, as simple as that. I just wish I can do good at something and stay good at something and actually fully accomplish something without it blowing up in my face at the end. Whatever.   So I think I'm going to Colorado for sno daze weekend, aka valentines weekend. I'll be going with my cousins so it'll be a lot of fun, but ya one problem..... I don't know how to ski or snowboard, haha oops. But ya I think it'll be so much fun and a good experience so I'm gonna go. But ya then there's the thought, well maybe I should stay here 'cause it is valentines day weekend and sno daze and something could happen.... but then what would happen? Valentines day has actually been pretty bad for my in the past, ok not bad, just not good. I have never once gotten one thing from a guy while all my friends have, it's kinda sad, but oh well. But hey maybe I'll meet someone in colorado! haha, yes I know, I'm dreaming. But seriously think how romantic that would be, I'm out there skiing, ok more like falling on my ass, and then I just randomly meet, or run into, this guy and then he ends up staying in the same place I am, and then we spend the rest of the weekend together, it's like a movie!! Ha, yes I know that'll never happen, but I like to think about it, it gives me more of a reason to go to colorado.   So my new, or more favorable, obsession is now underwear, oh and Orlando Bloom, but most people should know about that one, wow I love that guy.... but ya underwear. It's a really good but really bad obessesion for me to have. It's not like anyone is actually going to see my underwear, or at least the people who would actually care, guys, but I still go out and buy like $12 underwear from like Abercrombie or Victoria's Secret. On top of that I do'nt even have any money so I don't know how I'm getting away with that. But it is a fun obsession because they're really a lot of cute underwear out there and ya, it's fun to own, haha ya ok I'm done with that.   Even though I slep till 11:30 I'm still tierd.

       I honestly don't have a new  years resolution, I don't really care.

       I'm eating an apple as I type. It's very good, very juicy and flavorful and yummy. Kind of hard to eat though 'cause whenever I open my jaw up far and bite down hard my jaw cracks and apples sometimes tend to cut my gums. Yum I could really go from some apple juice.   Talked to Aaron today...... I think I'm going to throw up, the good way.   I'm going to meet Aaron's parents tonight. I'm scared because I'm so not jewish and don't look anything like a jew. I think I'm going to throw up, the bad way.   I have a math test tomorrow, bio quiz tomorrow, whole article to write and finalize tomorrow, and a chapter read and 61 terms to have memorized by tueday. I think I'm going to throw up, the bad way.   I washed all my clothes that had been sitting on my floor for literally three weeks. Sad that I still have 3 more weeks or more of clean clothes. Having clean clothes makes me happy.   I finished my apple, the steam broke in my hands. Now I want some grape juice.   Until the next time, KT

       Honestly, things can be so randomly beautiful sometimes, I think that might be from that one movie Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, but it's true.  Like I seriously don't know what to say, I didn't expect any of this to happen especially with Aaron. I'm not saying I would have never gone out with Aaron but I'm saying that he was just so random in my life and the whole situation is just so random, who would have even thought that we liked eachother? The fact is though that it did happen and now it's, hmmm it's well wow. Nothing really more to that. I so took a step into a relationship that I normally would have hestitated going into, I took a risk and I took a chance and it has led me to something that I have always wished for. I'm talking like it's been a year, but sadly it's only been a week, I'm not gonna lie though, it feels  so much longer than a week, so much longer. I don't care about anything else anymore, I don't look forward to anything else  but seeing him. Wow I'm falling, and I'm falling hard. I don't know whether it's good or bad, but whatever it is, I don't htink it's going to change anytime soon.   "Dreams not only come true, they extend your wildest expectations."  Love ya'll, Kati

       Ya, this is one of my "Reach for the Stars" daily quotes. I like it, but I still don't feel too inspired, it doesn't make me jump, or even ponder so much, just makes me sit and stare. But to everyone else you should all be inspired to go out there hard core and get what you want. Hmmm I guess I'm just not too inspired just by how my day went. Wow do I hate school. I don't want to do anything anymore, I just kind of want to give up. Meh, we'll see what mood I'm in tomorrow.  Of course I feel asleep in Echo again today. It was 7th hour though so ya my study hall but I think I was out for like 45 min. hmm didn't look at the clock when I layed down. Anyways people are evil, they wanted to draw on my face and apparently got really close to doing so. But ya so if they would have I would have been really mad and ya I yelled at them anyways even though they didn't do anything, but now I'm just realizing that I have done that to so many people, it actually is funny, but I guess not so much to that person.... hmmmm, again maybe if I was in a better mood.    Depressing how I get like 12 emails a day and only one of them I read and it's my horoscope. The last time I got good email that I enjoyed from a friend that wasn't a forward was hmmm.... lets see..... ya don't remember.  It was really cute, today Aaron was like so I've been so like happy and excited, but all with lack of sleep because of you. He's like I can't fall asleep fast anymore 'cause I'll be thinking of you, but still I'm always so happy. That was one of the only things that made me happy today. He did say that after he asked if he could hold my hand because I was wearing gloves though.... hmmm it's really cute if he hadn't mentioned the whole gloves thing... oh Aaron.   I realized that I'm at my most solitude state and that I'm the happiest when I'm either in the dark room developing pictures, taking pictures, or when I'm with Aaron (when he's not making mean comments!) or thinking about him. I'm only pissed off and crabby right now 'cause of school and hw. It's weird how your moods and emotions can change so much based off of one place and person. It's also weird how your mood can change based off of how someone else is feeling, if that person isn't happy, you're not either. Interesting, but cute.   Why is the world so great yet so evil at the same time? I have a headache and have to study for ap us of course..... still waiting for something surprising to really make me happy someday, of course.  Friday tomorrow, yes.  Kati

       Ok I've never felt like so many people were talking about me in life. It's really funny how word spreads so fricken fast, seriously I told like two people and then ba-bam! Ya I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about..... I'm going out with Aaron..... Hi Aaron! Seeing that Lauren bluntly told me that I must write in my blog again and seeing that she said that she's mad at me for not informing my blogger audience about anything.... this blog is dedicated to her!! Haha oh Lauren. Hmmm ok I know you all have questions and because people are so nosey these days, once again thanks to Lauren, haha, I'm just going to tell you everything you wish to know.    How did this all start?   Ok so it started around valentines week and  ya we just started talking more and then at the dance we danced and what not and then I came to a thinking? Hmmm maybe I do like this kid, haha, and I'm sure Janelle would want me to point out that she did help alittle with the hooking up, haha. And then Aaron and I came to talking and blah blah blah from there.    Did you guys even talk outside of Echo and hang out?  That would be yes. As I said earlier we started talking a lot more and yes lame we talked mostly online, but yes sometimes on the phone and then more in school. And ok we only really hung out outside of school once, besides seeing each other at the dance and what not. Last Saturday night we hung out. And yes ya'll must be thinking, wow why to jump into a relationship. But clearly we knew eachother before, it's not like we just met. And we'd been talking and knowing eachother and what not for awhile. We kind of went on a spure of the moment thing and just based everything on guts and instinct so we're just going by the flow.   How did he ask you or when did he ask you or did you ask him?   He asked me. About 1 in the morning Sunday night or technically Monday morning. Yeah we're retards. And ya we're even more losers because it was online!!! Ok actually that would make him more of a loser, haha, jk..... sorta..... haha. But know, he did admit that it was extremely lame and ya he couldn't use the phone 'cause well ya..... but ya again spure of the moment. But I do expect maybe a re-asking out in a not so lame way (hint hint if you are reading!). Haha, but ya that's how, sadly, but the truth.    What about this whole jewish thing?  Ok so we, and with the help of others, have made a list and I am pretty much qualified as a jew. But hmmm ya there's still some stuff needed to be figured out I think in this department.  Hmm don't really feel like getting anymore deeper into my life. Maybe if you're special I'll tell you more, or you can just wait till my next blog and see what I have to say. So I was saying how I wish I could find a guy on valentines day in my last blog..... maybe I did find my prince charming after all :)!  Muah! Kati

       Yeah just because it's valentines day weekend and because Barry White is a pimp and because it's just a good song, I leave you with this:   Barry White---Can't Get Enough Of Your Love, Babe   (spoken)  I've heard people say that  Too much of anything is not good for you, baby  Oh no  But I don't know about that  There's many times that we've loved  We've shared love and made love  It doesn't seem to me like it's enough  There's just not enough of it  There's just not enough  Oh oh, babe   (sung)  My darling, I can't get enough of your love babe  Girl, I don't know, I don't know why  Can't get enough of your love babe  Oh, some things I can't get used to  No matter how I try  Just like the more you give, the more I want  And baby, that's no lie  Oh no, babe   Tell me, what can I say?  What am I gonna do?  How should I feel when everything is you?  What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?  Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?   Girl, all I know is every time you're here  I feel the change  Somethin' moves  I scream your name  Do whatcha got to do (?)   Darling, I can't get enough of your love babe  Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why  I can't get enough of your love babe  Oh no, babe   Girl, if I could only make you see  And make you understand  Girl, your love for me is all I need  And more than I can stand  Oh well, babe   How can I explain all the things I feel?  You've given me so much  Girl, you're so unreal  Still I keep loving you  More and more each time  Girl, what am I gonna do  Because you blow my mind   I get the same old feelin' every time you're here  I feel the change  Somethin' moves  I scream your name  Do whatcha got to do (?)   Darling, I can't get enough of your love babe  Oh no, babe   (spoken)  Baby, let me take all of my life to find you  But you can believe it's gonna take the rest of my life to keep you   (sung)  Oh no, babe  My darling, I can't get enough of your love babe  Yeah, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why  Can't get enough of your love babe  Oh my darling, I can't get enough of your love babe  Oh babe  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why  I can't get enough of your love babe  Oh babe

       Only a hopeless romantic could take such a movie as Win a Date with Tad Hamilton into relieve and wish all that could happen to you. Yup, that's me, if you didn't know by now I'm a hopeless helpless romantic. I'm not saying I want to enter a contest to win a date with a hollywood star and then have them all in love with me, I'm just saying that I want to find someone. One scene in the movie was where this one girl was telling this guy who was in love with this other girl that everybody has their Tad Hamilton, everybody is a Tad Hamilton to somebody. They may not be a star in real life, but somebody is a star to someone else and somebody has that little spot for a star in their hearts. I just want to be that star and be that Tad Hamilton to somebody and I want somebody to be a Tad Hamilton to me, I want to find my Tad.   It's pathetic though, Larissa and I were talking about how many guys I just pass by or go through, it's kind of depressing too that I haven't even gone out with any of them, there was only one guy that I felt something for out of all of them but still nothing happened. Let's see I think we counted 6 guys that I could have had a relationship with and that I didn't with any. Interesting, very interesting..... I wonder what that says about me. Well if you've read in my blog before, I've already pondered this and realized that maybe it's just because I'm waiting for that movie scene, that perfect person and person place, and that I'm not going to get it, but set on the idea that I will. I am getting better though, I'm starting to get little crushes again and am trying to work my way back into someones arms.  I don't realize how much I like dancing until I actually dance. Dances are so fun, but ya if you don't take advantage of them it wont be fun at all, if you don't dance, there's no point, and if you don't dance with people, even less of a point. The point of a dance is to have fun with all your friends and to socialize, it gives you the opportunity to dance with maybe the one person, the only person you've ever wanted to dance with, and no one is going to care who you dance with either, it doesn't matter if you know every single person at the dance, not one person is going to judge you for dancing with someone, if they do, that's just not cool. But I love the fact that dancing takes your mind off of everything and you can make up your own world.    Man bye to the closing of valentines day weekend, started it off with winning a hockey game and ended it with a chick flick, ya one more day before school, but doing hw all day doesn't really count. Oh and for those of you wondering, I sadly didn't find my prince charming, well maybe I did meet him last night, I just don't know it. Nothing special like my dreams or in fairy tales once again, but good never the less.   muah *Kati

       Valentines day. Such a great yet depressing holiday. In the past my valentines day hasn't been the best, well it hasn't be bad, but it hasn't be good. Ya'll should know that I'm a dreamer and always wish to be that person who recieves a dozen roses from a guy, that would be the sweetest thing, but I haven't. One year I was sick on vday and others I just see all my friends getting all these gifts or valentines and then I don't. I have gotten more valentines this year though, thanks to Echo! haha, but hmmm nothing much different yet..... It is only like 1:30 in the afternoon right now on vday, so I do have the rest of the day.... we'll see. All I know is that I feel pretty good today and that my horoscope wasn't too bad either. It said:  Romance is the least logical science, if you can even call it one. You'll end up with a person you really want, regardless of any self-delusion. Yesterday's bad luck leads you to today's gold mine. I don' think a horoscope can get much better than that, lets just hope that it actually holds true. It did get one part right already though... yesterday's bad luck, maybe it was just saying that because it was friday the 13th, but I really didn't have good luck yesterday either.   Everything in school was hot and went pretty well, the only bad thing about yesterday during school was that I my stomach didn't feel very good, but it wasn't anything bad. I had my quarterfinal section game yesterday though and so many of my friends came and I was soooo excitied and I just wanted to play my ass off, and I did for the first period.... but then I got like sick, I don't know what's wrong with me, but ya I felt like I was going to just pass out like hard core, not the best feeling to have when you want to play 100% and when you want to help the team out as much as you can. So ya I guess you can say my bad luck yesteday was that because you dont' even know how bad I wanted to play and how shitty it felt when I couldn't. But anyways we won thankfully, first time in park girls history to get past the 2nd round. We now play Thursday at 8:15 at parade, everyone better be there. But ya all I know is that if that was our last game and if that was how I ended my last game I woudl have cryed so hard, we almost lost too, we were losing like the whole game and whenever we'd score to make it so that we were only down by one they'd score again, but some how we tied it up in the last like 5 min and went into overtime and won 6-5. All I was thinking the whole game when I like couldn't play was that we better fucking win, and we did, whoa. All I have to do now is make sure I can play next game and don't die and figure out why the fuck I'm tierd all the time!   Anyways I'm excited for tonight, maybe I will get my prince charming.

       Yeah we won our round one game in hockey!! We won 12-3 against Red Wing.....where my dad lives so technically where I live sometimes.... haha yeah that was fun. We now play Friday at 5:30 at parade so everyone must be there 'cause we're gonna win!! BE THERE! But ya it was tight I scored and Angie got to 100 points just this season from my goal from an assit, that was so fricken tight! Bad thing was that I broke my 2 month old $145 stick in half..... I was so pissed off and am, but I'm getting a new one.... I hope! Anyways back off to studying ap us of course!! yeah for hw! (and for those who were too slow to understand..... I'm being sarcastic about the hw).  : )~ OAKES #14

        Warning:  Could include some graphic sences, but I will try not to make this too graphic.  I've never so much in my life realized what a gift it is to own more than one kleenex box, for that matter I've never so much in my life realized what a gift it is to own one kleenex box. As I sit here typing on the computer I constantly reach over for the pink tissues of Kleenex brand. I've had a cold for about a week now, and this cold has all the horrors, I have a cough, but it gets worse when I laugh, I'm somewhat lightheaded, and of course my nose is incredibly irritated and stuffy and blah, I don't really want to go into detail. So every time I go to blow my nose I feel so relieved as if I just got some huge burden off my chest, yet, it comes back to torture me again in less then 5 minutes. However, once the feeling comes back again, I still have my trusty kleenexs by my side.  I've realized how much pain you go through without the kleenexs by your side, both emotionally, mentally, and physically. I was sitting in Echo today thinking about how much I could really use a kleenex, but how there weren't any by me at this time. This mad me want to cry, I depended on them so much, I suffer if I don't have them with me, and they weren't in that class room at all. Sure I could go to the bathroom and use toliet paper or paper towels, but first of all that would include me leaving the couch and second, they just aren't fun to use. So instead I used the napkins that were already in the room. This sure doesn't do any better than the paper towel, but I needed one so bad, it was strating to drive me insane. So I blow my nose and does it hurt. After usuing napkins and paper towels, your nose gets ten times dryer then it was before and it also scratches your nose, not so fun. If I were to have used a kleenex however, it would have been nice an soft and I would have kept on coming back for more, I guess you could say they're addictive.   The worst time to need a kleenex is during hockey, here you can let it flow.... through and out your nose and well just not caring.... except one hit and bam.... everything just flows out like an erupting volcano, not the prettiest thing to see. The alternative though is bringing a box of kleenex or something to the bench and when you get that 5 second break, undo your face max and blow the hell out of your nose, and then see there is no garbage by you on the ice, you have to either just leave it there for everyone or taking it at the end.   Through my experiences I've learned to always carry tissues with you no matter if you  have a cold or not or no matter where you are. They're very useful and efficient and I give props to whomever invented them. So if you don't have any soft kleenexs in your house, please go get some for your sake  and everyone elses, it's not to pleasent to see you wiping your nose on your shirt, and if you are, I really hope it isn't someone elses.   This issue has been brought to you by: ME! Yes me... Kati!

       Writers block.... incredibly bad writers block.... I had a lot to talk about before but now it doesn't really seem to matter so much to me. I could complain about the snow some more and how people are shits when it comes to drive or walking... yes people walk in the streets where you can hit them.... and oh well will hit you, just wait.... but that's so hiatus and boring and well redundent. I could talk so more about my fantisies and hopes I have and things I want. Basically I can bitch some more like most people do in their blogs about shit that isn't even important. I'm tierd of complaining and bitching so now I'm going to try to make my blogs alittle more entertaining and alot less depressing. Hopefully I can stick to this.... we'll see.   I like surprises that can happen throughout the day, no nothing exciting happened today, but there's that thought that something could and something will. I just love looking forward to something.... say the John Mayer concert.... yes John Mayer... whoa. I like thinking about what suddenly can pop up during the day that can make your day so much better. Exciting things are fun... maybe that's why I'm so amused by waking up to pranks even though I have to go clean it up. That's also why birthdays, and any holiday is so fun 'cause you don't know what is going to happen, you don't know what you're going to recieve or what sort of events are going to happen, man it's so exhilerating. Hint to all you reading.... do something exciting and different for me once in awhile, it will earn you props.... well unless you egg my house or do something that well just isn't too nice.   Off to bed to another exciting night of dreams!! Whoa!   KBO

       I'm sitting here at 11:45 pm on a Sunday, which is obviously a school night. I'm actually really tierd and should be in bed right now, but I feel like I've wasted my whole day on nothing and now I want to talk to people and do something. I woke up at 11:50 today and I actually had the worst nights sleep ever because of course I'm sick again. Not only that but I didn't change out of my pajamas once, and I fell asleep for the whole 2nd quarter of the Super Bowl game. And now I'm sitting here typing in this blog when I really could be getting some valuable sleep or reading some bio or doing some math. Life is messed, you don't realize you're wasting your time until that time or moment is over. Once I'm done with this blog I am going to realize how I wasted my time writing about wasting my fucking time. Wow. Honestly the only fucking reason I am writing right now is because I haven't written in it for awhile and because well I guess I don't want to go to bed.... interesting.   It's really amazing how you want so much of just one persons opinion. Like I don't even talk to this person barely, I don't even care about him, but I saw him for the first time in like literally 3 years friday night. And ya he was my ex and the guy that I really actually liked for the first time. All I could think about was looking good and wanting to make a good impression, but why should I care? He's not in my life anymore, why should I worry and care so much about one 5 minute moment of my life when so many other things are going to over rule it, it doesn't make sense to me, but just the way he reacts or reacted I'll never forget.    I hate but love liking people. I love the feeling I get when I see them or talk to them and I love the fact that there may be something I have to look forward to during my day. But I hate the feeling of not knowing, not knowing what to do, not knowing how to react, not knowing what they think. When I like people, usually it's someone I've liked for along time that I've been pretty good friends with..... but now it's different, I'm friends with this person, but not really, it's not like I can just call him up and be like you wanna do something without it being weird. It's really frusturating not knowing if anything will happen, or expecting nothing to happen, it's frusturating watching days pass me by when maybe something could have been done. I hate rejection, I think I have had or felt like I have had so much rejection in my life that I'm honestly afraid to actually go and pursue something with someone I like, I sit back and hope for something to happen, while I don't get up and actually do something about it. Oy I just don't know what to do with myself and while I'm hoping for soemthing to happen, I could go out with someone else..... but I'm not, and I feel like I'm leading him on, not good. Tips on what the fuck I should do would be great.   I hate being sick!! I also hate the cold, it ruins everyones mood and brings out the bitchiness and complaints out of everyone. Having it be so fricken cold and then being stressed on top of it does not lead to a good combination.... it leads to a deathy cold which pisses you off even more. It's a great time for me to get sick too.... 3 games left for hockey and then sections and I'm trying to keep my position of first line.... if I can't breath it may be a little difficult to accomplish this. Wow life can kick you in the ass, but it's still worthwhile and hey I'm livin.   Hey it's supposed to be 26 degrees tomorrow! Hopefully that'll cheer everyone up! Funny how we Minnesotans are excited about that though, haha it really is.   Until the next time-----> Kati

       I have another love in my life..... John Mayer! Oh man so good and so cute! Like I said yummy! Ya I went to his concert last night and damn! Hehe oh man, that's all I can say. But ya Guster was really good too! I like them a lot! Now I want the Guster CD and ya'll should want it to! Ok I'm done promoting them, but ya seriously.   Have you ever just sat there and actually listened lyrics of songs? Honestly, some songs make your heart melt, not because of how it comes out and sounds musically, but by the lyrics. I love song lyrics because if you've wanted to say something to someone and didn't know how, it's bound to be in a song. One word for a song, one line from a song, can explain everything you're feeling, it's awesome.   "Damn baby You frustrate me I know you're mine all mine all mine But you look so good it hurts sometimes"  Now, if I were to make someone mad, this is how I'd want it to be. You look so good it hurts sometimes? Wow, do I really need to elaborate?  Oh John :)  Kisses to all : )~Oati Kakes

       It's seriously amazing how one person can make you feel. It's amazing how one moment can be with that one person. It's amazing how nothing else seems to matter but this person. It's amazing how you don't even need to do anything, you can just sit there in silence with this one person, and still have fun and be happy. it's amazing how you miss this person only after 10 minutes of being seperated.  And most of all, it's amazing how every time you see them for the first time that day, and every kiss with them, seems like a first. Love and life itself is amazing.

       So I'm sitting watching MTV and bam, it hits me, what has our society come down to when people start watching reality tv about 19 year olds in a competition trying to get married at spring break? Seriously how can people want to do that and how do people get amusement out of that?   On that note how and why the hell did MTV create a show called Pimp My Ride? Honestly, I lost so much in MTV and got so disappointed when I heard about it. Really what more do I have to say about it?  There is Under Armor women's underwear, that is the coolest thing ever. There are thongs and ya regular underwear. I actually think that's kind of weird and gross, I'm not going to go out and buy them, but hell it's funny how they've gone from shirts to well underwear, it's amussing.   If I'm blogging and blogger...... why can't a blogger blog me? Hmmmmm......  And now I'm late going over to Aaron's! Oppsy, again this has been an episode of what society has come down to: being late to certain events in order to type in your blog, I love it.  : )~Kati

       I don't know what to say about anything. I don't know what to think about anything. I don't know what to feel about anything. I'm stuck, I'm stuck in a world full of different emotions pulling me in different directions. I'm lost.   I feel so happy and feel so strongly about something, but I don't want to say it, I can't say it, it wont come out.   I feel so content in my life right now, but I'm still confused and frusturated about everything. I know things can work themselves out, but how do they when so many things are going on?  I have butterflies in my stomach about everything that is happening now, but then the butterflies turn to mush when I think about everything that is going to happen with me in like 2 months.   I feel like I have time for everything, or at least for him, but I don't, I don't have time for anything, I don't have time for my own life. I have time for lacrosse, soccer, and school, but I don't. How can you put so much into your schedule and still expect everything to come out right?   I'm so sure about how I feel and I'm so happy and not afraid for the future to come, but at the same time I'm terrified. I'm shaking, I'm worried, I'm scared for school, lacrosse, soccer, my guy, my life. I want everything to happen, but still how is it all possibly going to happen?  How can two sides of a situation collide to make just one thing? How can two emotions compile  together to make one feeling? How can two people come together and never want to seperate? Life mixes everything together and makes it a whole.  I'm so confused, I'm so lost, I'm so happy, I'm so everything. I'm speechless.

       IB is a bunch of crap and a waste of time. I'm not even going for the diploma and I'm saying this, but it's true. I'm trying to get the IB certificate in IB Bio. so hopefully I'll do good on the test, but anyways ya we had our group 4 projects due today. I worked on it basically non-stop except when I was gone for an hour at a lacrosse meeting, until 1:30!!! It's insane and so like whoa! Anyways I actually put a lot of work into my poster and everything else and after today and the "presentations" I've never felt so much like I wasted my time! Seriously I got soooooooo stressed out because of it and because of all this figuring shit out with my partner, which ended up giving me no partner at all, and then today it felt like a joke. Also, Ms. Divinski didn't tell us any specifics on what she wanted so I did extra by making a lab report, and ya she didn't tell us that we only needed the poster until today. Feeling like I wasted my time and go so freaked out about something and have it barely matter in the end, really really pisses me off. I don't waste my time, especially when it comes to homework. Oh and for those who don't get the title, my project delt with comparing the growth of bacteria on cheese and yogurt.   Lacrosse has started, well at least captains, that makes me really happy. I was only able to go to 2 practices this week though and I was late to both of them..... funny though 'cause I didn't go all because of group 4!! Oh how I love it..... not! Anyways this is my favorite time of year, sure I may be a little more stressed out 'cause of all the AP tests and IB tests and because I'm realizing how badly I need to get my grades up, but then when I'm at lacrosse everything just kind of goes away, well for the most part it does, I just can't get pissed off about anything. But ya lacrosse is my favorite sport ever and I love playing and I loving wanting to excel and get better, in all the other sports I play I don't care too much if I get better, but this sport I do, I want to work to my fullest potential...... I just need to make sure I get enough sleep so I don't pass out and die when I play. Not only that but spring starts and it gets warm and oh man how I love the warm weather, I love the smell and I love the feeling, and I love the sun, it doesn't get any better.   It's funny 'cause Lauren and I were talking about how when you get a boyfriend or girlfriend, which ever way you flow, haha whenever you write in your blogs they're usually a lot more giddy and happier, which I think for the  most part is true. It's either that or you don't have anything to write about because you have nothing to complain about or becuase you just don't care about anything else. Sorry if I've gotten boring in my blogs, I'm trying to do good and enterain all 2 of you, I really am.   Note: Qudaba is much better than Chipotle..... thanks for introducing that to me Alison! Next time though..... I don't think I should be the one driving.... haha, it's just a good thing Aly is alive.   Oh man I'll be so happy in 2 weeks, spring break, that's all I am thinking about to make me last until then, only 2 more weeks. Man I've got John Mayer and I might be going to New York City, where I've never been, for a couple of days, so excited.  Man I am so tierd and have so much hatred for school, but besides that I love so many things right now, I love it. : ) Now as long as I stick to that and don't think about school....... oh wait school is on my mind probably  55% of the time, Aaron and the lacrosse is the other 45%. Hmmm is this good or bad? Probably bad, this is what school has done to me, wow.   Anyone have any ideas where to take some good photos?  Ok, kisses to all! Kati

       I've been watching the show Room Raiders on MTV lately, well ok since like September, but ya I really like the show, not because it's a dating show and what not, but because it shows people's rooms and how they express themselves. I also think it's pretty cool that there are people picking their dates based off of the personalities of the room, ok most of them do, some of them just go on the amount of porn or thongs they have. But anyways, it really is pretty interesting to see a persons personality through their room. First of all if someone is like omg I'm so not like that anymore and I don't even like thos band memebers anymore..... that still shows something about your personality. Sure you may not have those same interests anymore and the people may not know that, but if that's the case it does show that you don't really like change or that you're too lazy to change anything. It shows that you're still living in the past or never home to really care. No matter how creative your room is or how messy it is, it shows your personality some way. It'll show if you're unkempt, it'll show if you're creative, and it'll show your way of life. My room for example is dark blue with white sheets and what not throughout the room, I have a lot of pictures and have set my room up so things match and fit well. My room will show that I like memories and I like expressing my creative ability through my room and ya if someone goes through my draws they'll get my sense of style. That and I am kind of messy. I just really think it's funny and really interesting actually how much you can actually express yourself through your room. Your room is your own, it's the place that brings the best of you because it's all yours. I see it as a place that should really best represent yourself then anything else, it's your home. Thus Room Raiders to me is quit appealing. If I were to get set up on a date, that's how I would want to. Who ever came up with the idea, nice, very nice.   Phobias are really interesting, really weird too. I don't even know how people pick them up, sure someone may have had a terrifying experience, which would make sense as to why they're a freakishly afraid of something, but other things people don't really have a reason, they're just there. Me for example, I'm terrified of bugs and spiders, like seriously I'll freak out and cry if one is on me or anything. Just like 10 min I was sitting on my couch and I felt something on me and I look and there is a spider crawling on me. I throw my book out of my hands and jump up and down and then run away freaking out, good thing it came off of me that sec 'cause if it hadn't I would have started crying not joking. Say I'm being held done and someone is putting some bug on me, I'll cry then too and have a panic attack. Seriously why am I afraid? I haven't had a deathy experience with bugs and they can't exactly harm  me, well at least most bugs in Minnesota. I just have grown up with a this thought of bugs that someone they will harm me, I don't know. Again phobias really just don't make sense. Then again nothing really makes sense in this world.  Love Actually is a very high quality movie, I've seen it twice in theater and I recommend it to everyone, especially for those who have an open heart. One concept from that movie that I really liked though, was the airport one. Actually, it was kind of false too. The movie showed and talked about how much joy is brought about from an airport and the arrivals of people. So much love is expressed and there's no where else where such love is felt. It's incredibly true, airports do bring joy, doesn't matter if you're visiting someone or anything, but the joy of just being at a certain place brings more love to just that individual too. However, the other side to this concept is missed. Airports also represent broken hearts, and sadness, the feeling of unable to forget and the feeling of the joy that was just experienced slipping through your hands. So many people cry in airports, yes many do cry of joy, but many do cry of the depature. I'm guilty of this too, I have cryed a lot in airports because I didn't want to leave. I've gone some place for like a week and have had so much fun that I didn't want to go back to my life at home and go back to reality. It's so hard to say goodbye, but at airports you have too, airports give you that moment you cherish and that one moment you always set aside and try to forget. Although you may be crying of sadness due to the love you had, it's still a broken heart. Airports will either mend your broken heart, or leave it so vulnerable to be broken again.   For the first time like ever I was able to walk out of a sappy movie all about love, and say I can't be sad I do have a boyfriend, I do have that love..... that was weird, but it still felt incredibly good, I can't complain anymore.   Never go to a library on a saturday afternoon, surprisingly a lot of people go there.

         You are GUTS.  You love to be "xtreme" and you love peril.  You probably enjoy a good sip of Gatorade now and then, too.    urlLink   Which old school Nickelodeon show are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Now I was kind of disappointed about this quiz, sorry Alison. Sure it may be true about me being like active and what not, or whatever it said..... but still how can you be a show? Technically you can't, plus even if you didn't pay attention to the technicalities or even if there weren't any, why would you want to be a whole show? One show doesn't show a personality of someone, it shows multiple personalities of everyone on the show and typically they'll have two people that are exact opposites, hmmm it just doesn't work for me.   It's funny because I thought B96 was a pretty "ghetto" radio station, that was true until I found 89.9, all it plays is rap for the most part, it's kind of enriching to hear all these rap songs that aren't over played and that you've never heard of. My suggestion is for those of you like me who like rap, but not repeatedly to go listen to this station sometimes, because well, it gives you a different beat. I wish my name was Shanquia, haha oh man this song is funny.   It made me happy, I got a new discman........  Wait it just said it, it's the the soul of the twin cities, or something and now I forgot, me bad.   Anywho I'm happy because I got a new discman today from mi padre, I needed one badly and this one is really nice and pretty, nice and red with cool headphones.   For those of you wondering and didn't notice, I did have a much better day than yesterday, ya nothing exciting but nothing extremely bad happened like yesterday, plus I'm not thinking about anything 'cause it pisses me off!  Oh and for those retards that like gossip and for some reason decided to start a rumor that Aaron and I broke up.... so not true. Sorry week long relationships aren't for me, maybe in Jr. High, but no. Aaron is still mine and I'm sill his, so ya sorry to ruin your gossip and rumor, find something new.   That's all for now. Back to homework..... no I mean busy work......  KTO

Ok ya Anny wanted me to talk about her, lets see..... so Anny is a cool girl, wait did I say cool? Hmmmmm I might want to take that back!

So I'm trying to think my bad habits for Alison. YEah for talking about underwear. Bell rang time to go home or to lacrosse if I feel like watching Super Troopers!

       It's almost like getting crushed by a semi, but not die. You just lay there in pain, struggling, but you can't do anything about it. It all depends on someone else to help you get through it, to live.   I seriously don't know how else to explain how I've been feeling lately. The only thing I can help myself with is doing somewhat well on tests aka studying and trying to be happy and having a positive outlook. Everything else though is out of my hands, out of my control. I feel like almost every hard situation I'm in right now all depends on someone else. Whether it's a ref during a game, a writer for my page, or just an indecisive friend. With that I can hardly help the situations, I can't make them better at all, sure for some things I can try, but others I can only make them worse. It doesn't help that I'm controlling and have no paticence for things to just work out.    I feel like I need to change myself now, honeslty. I feel like it's come down to the point where I just need to change. But the funny part is I can't, it's how I am and I've been like this my whole life. I have been emotional with every aspect in my life, no matter the situation, and more than ever, that's starting to get me in trouble. I don't like being so emotional, it just ruins things and my attitude, but people need to realize that I can't just change on the spot. And it frusturates me even more to know that I can barely help myself right now.   I feel completely helpless because I can't do anything. I can't express myself with anything I do because it always comes out the wrong way or it comes out too aggressive. I can't get what I want, at all. What hurts me the most is that I can't play my game, I can't play my game of lacrosse without feeling critized and I can't even play my game of life without getting hurt.   I don't know what I need, maybe I just need to stop. But it's so hard to just sit and watch while the world passes me by. I'm in a constant position while everyone else seems to progress. I need people to help me in the situations I can't help and I need people to help me control my emotions. Mostly though, I need to feel like I have control of at least one aspect of my life right now because nothing seems to fit, nothing is in my hands. I know things work out all on their own and you have to just wait for it, but it's been too long, I just wish things would work out for themselves right now. I'm completely helpless and that's all I can say.   Kati

       As I was sitting here ealier, of course pondering whether or not I should start my hw at 8:00 at night, I like something was on my forehead. I do one scratch, one wipe, one hit, nothing. Two seconds later, I feel it again. Now is the time I started getting freaked out an paranoid and heck, I didn't even know if something was there. However, this time when I took my hit to the head, something flew off onto my keyboard. When I first noticed that something was actually there, I shrugged in disgust, but then when I look down to find something of a spider, my eyes widened and I froze, giving it a blank stare, as in what should I do now. With a closer look though, I notice it was more than just a spider, it was a tick! This is when I jumped back and called for my mom to take it away. There was a tick crawling, not only somewhere on me, but on my head, in my hair!! Who knows how long that was there for, but in uter rage and fright, I just wanted to cry, which I almost did. I can't stand bugs, especially not the mere thought of one actually being on me, and especially with a bug that can dig into your skin and basically create a home there.  I then felt even more dirty than I had felt before, just getting home from a lacrosse game, and felt distinguishably out of place feeling as if a colony of bugs were on me or swarming towards me. I jumped in the shower to feel it all just wash away down the drain. No more filth, no more bugs, no more fright. I felt warm, clean, and clam after a nuroishing shower that no only wiped away my paraniod thoughts, but also my stress and anger of the day. I felt renewed and fresh, and to only think a bug had truely gotten me there.   I get dressed, sit back down, and then realize the studying and hw I still need to do and the lack of motivation I have for it. All my thoughts that had left in the shower, now come rushing back to haunt me and torture me. One more day of the week, that's it, but one more night and day before than. I am now back to where I started. Time just goes round and round. Meh.  Happy day to you.  Kati

But really I'm only waiting for one day right now, one day, one moment. Oy, I don't think my brain is functioning too well right now, I'm too tierd to say anything and if I do, it probably wont be good. Meh.

       I think I have a love/hate relationship with the world right now, I seirously do. I love everything and I hate everything all at the same time. It's annoying, I wish I was just in a love relationship with everyone, everything, and the world.  I hate hw. With that I hate ap us, I hate spanish, I hate school, and I hate grades. I hate tests.  I love the feeling of accomplishment.  I hate losing. In sports, in relationships, in life.  I hate being tierd.  I love the sun.  I love ice cream and popsicles when it's warm up.  I love people. But I also hate people.  I love feeling special.  I love the feeling when you know people care and when people are just there for you.  I hate the feeling when it feels like no one is there for you at all, at least the people that really matter.  I hate things being blown out of proportion.  I hate fighting.  I love make-ups and the sense of assurity after fights.  I love sports.  I hate how sports can kill you.   I hate cancellations.  I love plans.  I love, love. I hate, hate.   All I need is love and I hate it when I don't feel like I have any... but ya of course I love it when I do.  I don't know, I just don't want to feel the hate anymore and I want to stop being moody and stressed and tierd and blah. I hate blahs. I hate feeling blahs more at that. That's why I love people who can get me out of my blahs. Oy, this is going no where else.   KTO

       Seriously hating the world right now, me along with other people, so I'm not only the depressive person. I don't care though, I just want to be happy but even the things that make me happy, like lacrosse, are starting to piss me off. I just want to crawl up in a ball right now and hide away for the rest of the year.  I just have to think about how things will get much better after this week and the next. But even so, after that then I realized how shit my grades out and still will freak for the rest of the year, joy. All I know is that I don't have time for anything, and ya I just want to stop doing everything.   All I want is for something to happen and someone to do something maybe a little out of their way to make me happy, even if they dont' have to go out of their way, just to care and try to make me happy is all I'm asking. I don't care about how much I bitch about stuff when other people have the same amount of work if not more than me, but this is how I handle things and this is how I am. I'm not the smartest, I can't take tests, and that's just how I am so then I freak out even more about school. People just need to understand that and just realize that even if whatever I'm doing may not be that tough to them or seem that significant and complainable to them, it is to me. It really is. I know I'll be fine after this year and after this week and the next, but it doesn't hurt to try to help at the moment and the time even if in the long run it'll get better no matter what. Just that one happy moment can change your attitude about everything and help a lot more.   Urgh, I'm done, I'm just sick of this shit, I really am. But really after all this, I sitll don't feel like I'll be heard, it wont matter.  oadhfkjawer

       Pasta Party today, oh man that was good. But it's funny because I really should be so fat right now it's ridiculous, after realizing how much I ate and how much I eat in general, I just don't understand. I had 3 full plates of food at the pasta party. Each totally filled. I finished them all.  PLATE ONE: THE SALAD/BREAD PLATE This plate was traditional and good, but ya I ate all of my salad, all of my fruit, and 3 slices of garlic bread!! Nummy! But hey notice that I did have a salad and fruit, I am staying healthy.  PLATE TWO: THE PASTA PLATE Of course, the whole thing was filled up with pasta. One huge section was of the pesto pasta and the other two both had cheese ravioli. The only bit I did finish on this plate was like 5 ravilois, but trust me when I say I had already eaten like 30.  PLATE THREE: THE DESSERT PLATE Oh man, dessert. Ok so I didn't fill this plate up completely, but well enough. I had 2 little chocolate rice krispie bars, 2 other kind of rice krispie bars, and a chocolate covered peanut butter bar thing. You still have to admit that was a lot.  To think I ate all this in just like 15-30 min. Man. Ya I'm proud to say that I ate 3 times as much as most people on the team. Funny to because at every pasta party Stick and Kathryn always go back to how I had eaten 8 pieces of lasaguna at a pasta party before and how I had eaten a whole cheese bread pizza from Papa John's. Honestly, please tell me why I'm not that fat. Maybe it's because I play sports year round...... haha wow can't wait when that stops. Whoa.   I love how I just spent all this time talking about food and pasta parties while I'm so screwed in my life when it comes to school and hw and when I have an ap us oral tomorrow and a ap us terms quiz thursday with 2 chapters. Not to mention that the ap test is may 7. Wow.   Until the next time will your food be delicious and filling.  Oati

       Oh man this is why bio is so fun! Ok well at least this is why this chapter is so fun! Warning this is kind of graphic, but then again it is coming straight from my bio book:   Humans and several other primates are unusual in having no distinct mating periods; females are potentially receptive to males throughout the year. In humans, the sexual behavior called "making love" may have evolved as a way to strengthen the bond between mates, as well as to promote the union of egg and sperm. Our sexuality is emotional as well as physical, and we have highly varied sexual expression.  The physical events of the human sexual respone occue in a sequence of four phases. During the excitement phase, sexual passion builds, the penis and clitoris became erect, and the testes, labia, and nipples may swell.  The vagina secretes lubricating fluid, and muscles tighten in the arms and legs. These responses continue during the plateau phase, which is marked by increases in breathing and heart rates. Orgasm follows, characterized by rhythmic contractions of the reporductive structures, extreme pleasure for both partners, and ejaculation by the male. The resolution phase reverses the previous responses; the structrues return to normal size, muscles relax, and passion subsides.  Hahaha, I love it, I really do. It's funny because I bet so many people have gone out and had sex after reading that, haha school makes sex sound exciting and "enjoyable." Haha, not too often school makes you horny, lol. Ok me done.

       I got this poem from Rubin's blog, of course he wrote it and is a pimp. Funny becaues I can totally relate.   Tears dripping out of my eyes Asking, questioning:  "Why did you lie? You missed your chance – that dream come true Now you’re left without her, all alone – just you. Maybe it’s cause you thought too much, You questioned the truth,  Said it wasn’t enough. But what can be more honest that truth? A truth that rests so deep. In your heart. In you. You must have been scared. Of what, may we ask? Were you afraid of it all? Did it seem too fast? If you ask us that’s garbage A bullshit excuse. A way to get out of what would have happened to you. At first that seems fine, Since it would have ruined your life, But at second glace we see it won’t detract from the strife. With or without that kiss that night, She will always be that every-glowing light. That light that outshines everyone else in the world With or without it, she’ll always be the only girl."  The tears dry up, evaporate Leave me alone, to contemplate The things they said and showed to me All of it being true, that I now see.

       Why am I so bitter? Seriously I feel bitter and mean about everything, about lacrosse, about people, about everything. For example I now have 12 goals in lacrosse..... from last thursday I had 10. The NSLA website, the high school lacrosse league website, has we with 2 goals, 2. But I'm pretty sure everyone else on my team, their goals have been updated. See this right here shouldn't really bug me that much, it really shouldn't, but it does, it really does. Urgh so annoying, as in me being annoyed with myself mostly. I guess I just want to be recognized for something that I do and just really want to do good at something which I haven't my whole life.

       I can't even feel anything, like literally, I can't. I'm numb. And I don't even know where to begin to help myself get out of this.   Surely this dumbass blog wont.  Like I said.... no point.

       I hate how I act sometimes. No I just hate how I act when I'm really stressed, I yell at everyone and snap at the little chance I get and cry when something not even important hits me. When I'm playing a sport I'll lose focus and get pissed off at the refs a lot easier, when I'm talking to people I really care about, I snap at them and get them pissed off, it's not what I want at all and I almost can't control it.   I can only think of a dream bf, the one I dream about every night......I can see him so clearly its as if he is next to me rubbing my neck with his hand bc I had a ruff day....Everyday these days are ruff ones.... theres so much and so little time...I dont know where to begin, how to start and have no clue where its going to end...I am a little scared, all my regrets and hopes and miss chances are all begining to surves.....feelings I never wanted to have came... it's funny too because this dream, this bf in my dreams, is actually real and has actually been there, but the continuous thought of how I was happy is now becoming a dream. It's slowly and hurtfully sliping through my hands and I don't know how to stop it..... I don't know how to stop myself, from this, from everything.

       I'm so tierd, exhausted, and frusturated. About everything. About school, about sports, about relationships, about my life at this moment. I just want things to slow down so I'm able to get through it one step at a time, so I'm able to think about one thing at a time, and so I'm able to realize what has happened and what will happen.   I'm tierd physically. I woke up at 9 today for lacrosse which went to 11 and then I went straight to soccer practice which ended at 12:30. Wed. I'll be going to the weight room in the morning, have lax practice after school, and then have soccer practice at 6. It's insane and I still have homework on top of that, I don't think I like that so much. Good thing I can just put soccer on hold for right now, it'll help. I'm tierd with my emotions too. I'm sick of acting like a bitch and acting sad and gloomy. I have been much much better though, but then again I'll get moody and it goes to hell from there. But I'm sick of waking up mad in the morning when I really don't have to. It's funny because this morning the thought that has been popping into my head for like the last week but the person for the last month didn't when I first woke up today. But then I thought about that and it did and it's weird but he's also been in my dreams  some how, if not physically, he is. His screen name weird enough was in my dream last night. But anyways, I'm just tierd about how things have been going and honestly I just want to sleep through it.   Ok clearly I'm exhausted, I suppose that's the same as tierd almost. I'm also exhausted of trying to understand, it hurts my head now and I don't know what to do. I'm exhausted of trying to get my point across because I sometimes don't think there is even a point in doing that.   I'm frusturated about how things are at this moment. I'm frusturated at myself for diong so much at once sometimes, it's fun, don't get me wrong, but it scares me and frustruates me that I then complain, but I don't mean to. I'm scared for my grades and my health, but whatever, I'm not going to end something and put something on hold. I've done this plenty before and it's all worked out, it's even worked out better then I have thought before. Sometimes when you're scared and actually still continue and pursue something, you no longer become afraid and then strive for more once you know your abilities. And this applys to everything, once you pursue something when you're scared everything becomes possible. I'm frusturated that I don't understand, and I'm frusturated that he's frusturated that I may not even care about his reasons and his side, but I do, it just shouldn't be that way and it just doesn't make sense to me. I'm frusturated about being frusturated, funny how that works.   Urgh everyone is now talking about prom. It's in a month, wow. That makes me sad because I want to go, but right now I'd only want to go with one person, friends or more, that one person woudl make my night. But I don't know. 2 weeks ago I pictured the funnest most exciting night, but now I'm almost dredding it. Prom is supposed to be special, but honestly it wont feel to special if I'm not with him.   I'm hate this. I'm done.   Oati

       OY and BLAH, no better way to explain how I'm feeling. Seriously everything just decided to hit me at once, lots of fun. Urgh I'm getting better, but I'm so moody it's ridiculous. I'll be really REALLY pissed off one second and then the other I'm like meh and then I'm sad and then I'm happy and it's crazy, I don't even know how to feel anymore, I really don't. I just want to be back to normal, but what I want normal to be..... that's a little different. I guess you can't always get what you want, but still, makes no sense when the other person wants, ok maybe not wants is the best word, but feels, the same way too. Urgh I just want to get over everything and not be hurt anymore, it's just incredibly hard.....   Ok I'm going to try to stop my sulking and bitching in these blogs and try not to talk about that anymore..... it's just that it's the only thing I've been thinking about for the most part.... wow.   Lacrosse game tomorrow at 4:30 at the football stadium. First game of the season! BE THERE! Oh ya and it's free to get in so you don't have to worry about that! Hmmm ya, we play Roosiville and the more fans the more likely we are to win..... right. BUt no really supposed to be a really good game! Go damnit!  I've got nothing else.   kati

       I'm sorry, but I'm not. I say I'm sorry, but I'm not. I can't say I'm sorry for how I feel, I can't say I'm sorry for what happened. All I'm sorry for is how I do feel and how this has happened, I'm sorry for loving you and I'm sorry that you see this love can't continue, even though it can.  I'm sorry for broken hearts I'm sorry for tears I'm sorry for stubborness  But most of all I'm sorry for how I miss you, us, and the way WE feel. I'm sorry for the missed out opportunities and the experiences. And I'm sorry that be both have to love. I'm sorry that you feel love because then you feel it has to end. I'm sorry we have the same feelings for each other, but have different ideas on how it should be expressd.  I'm sorry for the furture.

       What's the point of life? To love right? But then what's the point of love, the point within love? I see no point anymore if the opportunity is right there and you can't even take it.... and if you do take it and if it just slips out of your hands, once again no point.    I'm lost. I'm lost within my emotions, I'm lost within others emotions, and I'm stuck in this meandering place and I can't get out. For that matter I can't do anything, I can't speak, I can't think, I can't be heard, I can't feel..... hmmm but I can cry..... and try. But what's the point of trying when either way it wont end up how you want it to? I'm so lost and I need to find my way out. If only he could find his way out..... maybe I could do the same.

       I just read through like a lot of my blogs, starting from the very beginning. I don't know, I feel like I've changed a lot from last August, but I don't know if I really have. Yes I think I've matured, but I'm still lost and confused like I was then, if not more. I still don't know what I want from myself or from otherwise, I'm still stuck.  It's weird how much you can change though in a year but then still fill like you ended where you started. With certain situations, that's how I feel. Sure there was a break through for a couple months or whatever, but then I got shot down again. I don't know how to make sense of anything or my life right now, I don't know. I feel like I contradict everythign I say too. I don't know maybe you should figure out if I have really changed, read through my blogs and you'll see.   All I know is taht you can see my change in attitude, from the bad to the good to the great to the bad again, my feelings are where I started too. It just hurts to see how happy I was and how I'm not there right now, it sucks. But don't worry, I am happy : ).  k

       I just finished looking through the whole yearbook for the first time. It has been one hell of year, that's all I know. Like seriously, I don't know where to begin. I've been taught so much in love, school, and in life and I have never felt like one year has ever effected me so much as this year has.   I'm glad this year is over, I can't wait to be a senior, but I'm actually really sad. I'm going to miss all my senior friends, I'm going to miss the times I had this year with them, and with everyone else in my life. I don't want to say goodbye to anything that has happened to me this year. Usually I'm really excited for the next year to arrive, but now, now I just want to stay in the same position I am in right now. I want everyone to be around me, I want to hold on to everything I have, because it's just too hard to let go. This year has been the first year I really got close to people and the first year I really opened up to people and to myself. Sure it was one of the hardest years of my life in so many ways, but that just leaves to more memories and more learning experiences. Although this has been one of the hardest years of my life, this has also been one of the best and I thank all of you for making it that way.   I just don't want it all to end, I just don't want to say goodbye.   Kati

       I think I just spent the past hour speaking spanish on and off trying to memorize mucho informacion de la iguana. I'm speaking in spanish about an iguana, seriously, when I do research on en Iguana, I just want to stop school. This is why I may think school is pointless....  Anyways, good news, I don't have mono!!! :) Well at least short term, I may have had it or have the long term mono crap, but I wont find that out for another week. It's sad that I'm sad I don't have it now though, it was really nice to have an excuse not to share your food with other people : ) haha yes wow I'm a freak.   When they drew my blood at the doctor though, it was funny because I was actually amused. I have never gotten my blood drawn before and so today was a new experience for me. Everyone who has gotten it done was like ya it hurt so much or made me see and I couldn't watch. But nope, not for me. I watched the whole time and was amazed at how much blood can come out of you in like 2 seconds from one tiny needle. And it didn't hurt at all! Man I gotta get that done more often.... ok nah. It's not like I don't already stick a needle in my arm every day..... ok, ok kidding, geez.   My hair has gotten long, I like it. I also like how carefree I have gotten about what I wear or how I look. Before I would like make sure I looked perfect and I couldn't not go out without makeup and I could only wear like sweatpants once a week. Now it's like meh, whatev. I don't care about makeup anymore and I like sweatpants so I really don't care about wearing those a lot either. It's funny too because I feel better about myself now being less carefree. I don't need other peoples opinions to make me happy anymore, sure it would be nice to hear you look good or something like that, but I shouldn't feel that I need to dress myself up and wear a lot of makeup to hear someone say that. It's funny how much I have changed, ok I might not have changed too much, but ya my attitude has. It's funny how much people change within high school, or even within a year.   Do what you want to do and be who you want to be. Don't let other people determine who you are, determine that for yourself.   Kati

       I felt like I had a lot to say like yesterday and the day before or even since the last time I wrote, but now, now not so much, maybe I do, but meh. My brain is either too all over or completely gone to make anything sound worthwhile to write about.  Lets see.... there's lacrosse. I'm extremely sad the season ended yesterday, but props to all of my gals to playing their asses off and having such a good season. No matter how low our downs were, our highs were the best times of my year and I love you all for always being there for me, and not only on the field. Seriously, I don't really know what to say because I respect you all so much and ya I hope you already all know how much I care. I will miss all you seniors soooooooooo much next year, just make sure to come back and play with us. I'm still glad there's a banquet :)   Soccer. Blah, I don't know, our first game I got excited about playing and glad that I was, but now, I'm really just not in the mood. After this weekend, I feel like people and for sure my coach expect soemthing else out of me that I don't have. But no my coach is one minded and doesn't care to actually learn or pay attention to everyones skills, right now I think he thinks I suck, first of all I've been playing defense, never have in my life and he's never seen me at forward.... it's all because he thinks I'm slow, but really I can sprint and have a good shot, he just doesn't give a crap to see that. That and he thinks I don't have endurance and am out of shape, sure I'm not the best runner, but I play 3 sports year round, do you think I'm out of shape? Ok I'm done with this rant.   Then one thing that pisses me off the most is when people are rude asses and wake you up from your nap, maybe no intentionally, but clearly they don't give a crap. I was sleepingon the couch and my sister and her friends come how and my sister is a fucking loud ass and just opens her mouth and starts like shouting! And then they stay in the fricken room! Seriously, I get crabby when I wake up from naps anyways, but when someone wakes me up that way, wow, it pisses me off, it doesn't help that I had just found out she had eaten some of my cake too. Urgh, I miss it when she was at college.   Sorry tihs blog is kind of gloomy and all me bitching. I'm not refreshed after my one hour nap at all, I want to sleep some more. I'm getting sick..... oh no : /  Oati

       So yesterday was the best lacrosse game ever, if you weren't there you missed a lot, we won 6-5 in the state quaterfinals and now we're playing EP in the semi-finals at 5:30 Monday I think at Blake. Seriously ya'll have to be there because it's going to be HUGE! But anyways ya, such a good game and my name is in the Star Tribune in the sports section! Go check it out, : ).   Soccer tournament this weekend, 2 games today, tied one, lost the other..... I like how everyone is like whatever when we mess up, sure some get mad once in awhile, but really most of us probably laugh. It's fun and less stressful that way. One game tomorrow, maybe another.... but meh. Hudson is a weird place, it's kind of random.   Bad idea to eat chili at Wendy's before a game : /   I'm tierd..... no not because I have mono, because I don't think I do...... : / but because I'm always tierd and have been doing a lot, ok? ok. Whatever, time for a nap.   Kati  Oh and RESOL means cool.... because RESOL spelt backwards is loser so it's the opposite : )

       Just when you think things are looking up, things get worse, that or just when you think nothing else could go wrong, everything else does. I just don't get how you can be so effected by one thing and then everything there after also effects you completely and significantly, whether it's good or bad, everything becomes big and an issue when something is either way up or way down. I don't get it. Maybe it's just me.   I don't know, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I myself get deeply effected by a lot, a lot of events and people, and who knows what. Also, I think people take certain situations and play them out differently, so the outcome and effect will go to their advantage. We live in a very selfish world, and I really don't like it. I'm sure I'm a hypocrite for saying it, because ya I know I want attention and I want things to go my way, a lot, but that doesn't mean I have to like the fact that I am like it. But mostly when it comes to friends and relationships, that should be the one time people shouldn't be selfish, no matter what, but we still all are. First of all there are two people, or more, in the situation and clearly either both will be effected by a decision, or at least for sure one will be. You can't just act on your own slef interest in a friendship, because no matter the bind between you and that friend, a friend will be effected by your descions if in any way it includes them. A friendship shouldn't have restrictions based on needs and wants, a friendship shouldn't have restrictions at all. A friendship should be the bond between you and that person, someone who can be there for you no matter the time or need. It doesn't matter how good of friends you are, a friend should always be there for you, a friend should be able to call you up no matter what.   Lately I just feel that people have been too selfish and look too much at their wants to notice how the other person may feel or how they may be effected. I even feel like teams are breaking up because of individual needs. I feel seperated from so many peopel right now, when all I want is to be with them. Sure it may be selfish to want to be with someone or talk to someone, or to regain a friendship back, but depending on how you look at it, the effect could be for the better if you just play it out the right way. Even if there is a problem in a friendship, sometimes it's just for the better to let it be and just let it play out for itself then to make a descion solely based a one person's needs.   I just don't want to be losing my friends because of stupid feelings or thoughts, or decisions. I want to know I have all my friends and want to know that they will always be there for me, no matter how I act, they act, or no matter what. All I know is that I'll always be there for all of my friends, no matter the situation.   I'm just sick of hurting inside, my heart seriously can't take it anymore and neither can my head. I'm done.   OK

       I didn't get home tonight until 10 p.m., I was at school the whole time. Echo scares me sometimes. Now I'm tierd, and I haven't done any hw, at all. Spansih test meh, bio test meh, I'm screwed no matter what.   Once I left the school, I was walking to my car and I noticed I left my cell phone in the pub, so then I turned around and the doors we shut. This scared me a lot, I'm too dependent on my cell phone to go like 5 feet without it. Then I'm like it's ok, Leah's still there and she can drop it off at my house on her way home, but then I realized her number was in my phone. Then I was going to call Avi, his number was in my phone, and so on and so forth. I live on my cell phone, I don't go anywhere without it, and now i'm going to have nightmares tonight because it isn't in the same place as I am in. I have to live without it for a whole night and I really don't know how to do it. I'm scared for it and am just really really hoping it's there tomorrow morning.... Oy. Oh but then I got the numbers, but you don't get service in the pub, great, Echo has screwed me over once again.   Man, I hate getting emotionally attached. I just want it all back.

       So prom was amazing. Seriously, everything went perfect (except for the part when the power blew)like I can't even describe how much fun I had. Dinner was awesome, and I was very impressed by the guys, the rides were awesome and the fact that I got to drive, dang, the dance was over the top, the after party, yes not as many people showed up as expected, but it was still a lot of fun, and the after after party even better, haha. I'm not gonna lie though, the best part of the night was my date :) haha. On top of it all everyone looked so beautiful and it just added to the night.   I really can't describe how I feel right now though. I'm full of mixed emotions and mixed feelings and mixed thoughts. Like I have butterflies in my stomach but at the same time I want to throw up. I'm so happy for last night, but scared and disappointed for the future and that's the feeling that I want to go away. I just want to live each day like I did last night and want other people to do the same. Not to worry about what may happen but to go with the moment and with the connection and just live life to it's fullest, to be with the people you care most about and to just sit back and let whatever happen, happen. I think sometimes people just need to go with their emotions and follow that and that's what'll really make them happy at that moment, and if you live like that always, you'll never have regrets and you will most always be happy.   I hate overthinking.   :* Kati

       TGIF, seriously this week just needs to stop, it's the weekend, and I can just chill out, get sleep and have fun.   I just think it funny that I can think and feel one way and everyone else around me decides to think that I'm thinking or feeling the exact opposite way. I actually just don't get it. I'm percieved as someone I don't want to be and as someone I'm not. Yes I'm lazy, but I don't lack effort, I always give 100%, always. I hate the fact that people don't think I do and it seriously makes me cry to know people think that, it makes me feel like I have no point in trying if people are going to think that way about me after everything. Yes, I may be tierd, but that doesn't mean I'm not giving effort because I always do and always always try to.   I also don't like the fact that people are trying to tell me how to act and that I basically need to change. I may not have the same motivation aspects as some, but that doesn't mean I'm not motivated, I just do it a little differently then everyone else. Urgh I think it makes it 10 times worse when one, people are saying I'm being a certain way, when I'm not or not trying to, and they're not even telling me. Second when my mom tries to come into the situation and tell me what she thinks how I'm acting and that I need to change it. She doesn't know anything about the sport, she's not on the field, she shouldn't be telling me what the fricken do. Urgh. So frusturated.   Whatever all my frustration and tierdness and everything else bugging me is now out the window and tomorrow will be a new day, and it's prom and I'm going to have a lot of fun no matter what. All I know is that once Friday hits, everything else is done and over, TGIF.   Kati

       Wow, this really has been a long week. It started out really good and exciting, and then come Wed. it just stopped and I just wanted to collapse and die. I'm asuming it's because of my lack of sleep, and yes the amount of sleep I have gotten is a lack for me, I sleep all the time, I need it. But ya I don't know, I just had a major mood change and I feel bad. Like 5 people have been like why are you so depressed today and they're like you never smile, and that actually makes me feel worse, because I don't want to come off that way. I've never been that kind of person, I've always been someone with a smile on their face. I guess it's just that with lack of sleep for me and with me doing two sports at once with school and tests and a social life, it just hits me sometimes and I just want to stop or want like one thing to really just calm me down and make me happy. And then when I don't get that one thing, I am crabby.   I think when I get this way, I become very pestimistic and think everything the wrong way and believe someone isn't doing something all because of me or how I'm acting. I take something insignificant that really really shouldn't bug me at all and have it rip me apart inside. For that rate I'm sorry for being selfish because I totally feel like I am, I feel like everything should be about me when it shouldn't at all, or at least that's how I feel towards certain people, and if I am percieved that way, I'm sorry.   I guess I just wish I was able to handle everything without getting so emotional and upset and without getting so stressed out, because it doesn't help anything at all. I guess I just want to say I'm sorry for being stand offish and sorry for being pushy and seeking attention if I have been. Hmmmm I guess when I don't get what I want when I'm crabby and tierd, it'll just make everything worse and either I blame it on myself or other people. Oy. I just wish certain things and certain people didn't effect me and my feelings so much.   On the lighter note, my soccer team won our first game of the season today 2-0 against Wayzata, it was hot. It's ironic though because because soccer and games and what not I'm always complaining and being like man I don't want to go at all, and then I play and then I'm happy and really glad I did. I'm sooooo excited for that summer.   Prom in 2 days (counting sat)!!! I'm extremely excited. :)   Oati

       Man today was so nice out and it made it even better because as of yesterday it was supposed to rain!! And I was outside for a lot of it tonight, not exactly for the reasons I wanted, but heck it was nice. It's funny because I get so tierd after school and then after lacrosse that when I have soccer and go to soccer after that, I just don't care. I feel bad because people are actually trying, and it's not like I don't want to try, I'm just soooooo tierd and just want to sleep. I think I'm going to have to work on my motivation level for that sport.... hmmmm.   We get to make an opera in AP US and Mrs. Page cried from laughing today, that was the best moment of my life.   My blog is pink! Yeah! I like comments, leave me some!   Oats

       My stomach is in knots and my head is full of slim. I'm sick of thinking and sick of feeling the way I do. But at the same time I can't get rid of it, everything is stuck in me and doesn't want to leave, nothing will leave me alone, but I guess that's what they mean when they say you can't ignore how you feel. You can't, and if you try, it'll haunt you and hit you even worse. Don't ignore a situation, take it with you and make it better, don't ignore that feeling you have, in your stomach, in your head, or in your heart. Take all those feelings, compile them together to make something great that allows every situation to be possible. Make the best of something you have while favoring everything you feel. Don't say your head means more than your heart, don't say your gut means more than your head, just do something that wont hurt your head, heart, or gut while still helping you and others around you. Don't ignore other people or their feelings and don't be ignored by yourself.   It's the simple things in life we forget You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said Why do you make something so easy so complicated Searching for what's right in front of your face But you can't see it

       Flowers bloom with the florescent smell surrounding your nose. Thunderstorms get a 75% chance of happening throughout the day and the rain brings a hot steamy refreshing smell. Children are flying kites and learning to ride two-wheelers, while mothers watch with pride and take their time to relax. The temperature gets up to at least 70 degrees and because of that people are now wearing shorts and t-shirts and their skirts are becoming even shorter. The sun is vibrant and the skies shimmering in light blue just make you smile. All the signs point out that summer is near.   However, you officially know summer has come or is near when your skin starts to change color and shade. After being out in the sun for 2 hours and forgetting to put on sun screen because it's only the beginning of May, your once milky white skin tone transforms into a shinny lipstick red. Your once singled colored skin is now multi colored with fire colors that no water color could subdue. Lines are made vertically and horizantally and many look like they had just gotten hit with a tomato. Yet, when you can look like this and still fit in with everyone else, you know you're not the only dumbass who forgets about lotion that protects you from golden ball hanging there ruthlessly in the sky. You really know summer has come.   It's funny because my arms are burnt and and so are my shoulders, but for some reason about 6 inches of the top of my arms decided to hide themselves from the sun even though I was wearing a tank top, I have a farmers tan but with colored shoulders too. It doesn't make sense. My face is also very very red.... it kind of hurts. I'm so going to look hot for prom now.... : / hmmmmm, meh oh well.   My comments don't work, I don't get that either.... that makes me sad.   Kt

       “There’s the wind up, the pitch, and a swing and a miss.” As the announcers say, baseball may have its misses, but still has many hits at that too. 		 	 The time of year has come for baseball fanatics to show their spirit as the peak of the season starts. However, much is missed by those who just don’t appreciate the quality of professional baseball.   Those discriminate towards baseball first need to realize the cheapness of the sport. Most professional sports become very scaley in price, even for nose-bleed seats, such as Vikings tickets that cost _____. However, if you go on a Wednesday night to a Twins game, upper-level seats are only $3.00 for students and hot dogs are only a dollar. Even on a regular night to a Twins game, the cheapest tickets are only $5.00.  	 Baseball is also very fun, yet at the same time it is still a very relaxing sport. Opposed to basketball where you’re on your toes the whole time, watching the ball go back and forth, and football where you can just feel the ache and pain when someone gets hit, baseball allows you to just sit, watch and enjoy. Some of the only times fans get really excited in baseball is when the person next to them gets hit by a ball or some random fan goes streaking naked across the field.  	 However, if people see the relaxation aspect of baseball as boring, this could all be greatly fixed by the fans.  	 Some of the excitement of baseball is already created by the fans. There’s the wave, which is always fun to start, loud cheering and music, and the beach ball that always ends up in the outfield and taken away by security. Some fans, as we have seen, even progress to nudity. However, if this is not enough, it’s always fun to see people dressed in big, goofy costumes and pretend they are actually what they wear, such as Batman. Someday, this could be you.  	 Even if fans need to spice up the game a little bit, baseball is a great sport to watch, relax, and socialize all at the same time, at a very affordable price. The fact that baseball has been around forever, and continues as a traditional sport, not only shows that fans have had their eye on the ball, but on the game too.

        The lost art of kissing    By William D. Hicks   Kissing plays an obvious and important role in romance. It’s often the first time many people know they’re in love — quickened pulse, butterflies, maybe even fireworks. But kissing seems to be a lost art form these days.   Ready to reclaim it? Anyone who masters these eight techniques to becoming a kissing master deserves a second date:  Towel off  Kisses are not meant to be wet. Sure, lips are intrinsically moist, but no one wants to kiss fish lips.     Moisturize   Lips that are dry or chapped feel like kissing sandpaper. Find a favorite lip balm and get into the habit of using it often.     Freshen up   If garlic and onions have to accompany every meal, make sure you carry breath spray or mints with you at all times. Excuse yourself before you start to pitch woo and give your breath a boost!     Shut up   First dates are not the place to practice your French kissing skills. While some people love to French kiss, others do not. It's way too intimate, and first dates should leave 'em wanting more.     Tantalize   Small, strategic kisses on the ears, lips and neck can be as effective — or more effective — than a long, lingering kiss that lasts a lifetime.     Be creative   Kissing is more than locked-lips; it can entail nibbling, licking and caressing someone's lips. You can also use your hands on their back, face, lips or hips to add an extra level of sensation to any kiss.     Focus   Concentrate on the kiss. Close your eyes and enjoy the sensation of lips on yours. Let your mind go; be in the moment.     Stop   No means no. If a date shies away from kissing on the first date, don't press the issue. Leave something to look forward to on the next date.

       I don't like being restained from doing stuff because of money. I really don't like looking for a job or trying to get one all because of money. I wish money grew on trees.  Jay-Z has a watch that is worth more than my house and cars combined, probably more than that too. Dude a watch! How pathetic.   k

       Mornings suck when you get a note from your mom basically yelling and demanding to get a job even though you have been trying all along. To make it worse it sucks when you then have to fight with your sister to see who gets the fricken car. Mornings suck when this all happens within 10 minutes of being awake.   Maybe it's my fault though for not even waking up in the morning, but in the afternoon.....  Mornings are good when you get a surprise right when you wake up (I personally don't think that has ever happened to me, but still I know it would be sweet). Mornings are also really good when you wake up from a call by that special someone or just anyone special in your life. Those calls make me smile.   I like the mornings when you wake up to good food or expecting good food, those mornings just make you happy for the rest of the day.  I like sleeping but if I am able to wake up to something that makes me happy or smile, nothing is better. : )  Oh and I'm going to a lacrosse camp in NEW YORK! So excited, I'll rant about it some more later.  Kakes

       Hmmmm is it just me or does it seem like everyone has sex on their minds? I mean ok, what's new? But now people are actually expressing their feelings about it and talking about it. I've never had so many conversations and read so much dealing with sex in my life. Maybe it's because it's summer now and fligs and the romantic atmosphere can be set easier so people automatically think about sex. Maybe it's the whole "I wanna have sex on the beach." Meh, who knows, all I know is that sex is taking over the world. I'm not gonna lie, I kind of like it, haha, nah.   I think it's funny though because the most comments I've gotten in a long time were with my blog where I mentioned sex. Lets see what happens here....  Oati

       I went shopping today.  I went shopping today for six hours.   I went shopping today at Target, Ridgedale, Galyans, and Uptown.   I went shopping today and bought sunglasses, a skirt, two shirts, a hat, and some pants.   I went shopping today for myself with my money.  I went shopping today and it felt good.   I went shopping today...... and we'll leave out the amount of money I spent.  Actually I went shopping yesterday.... once again I'm up until like 3.   I slept into 12:20 today (yesterday)  : D YEAH.

       I was thinking about what I wanted to be when I grew up and where I wanted to go and how capable I am at doing stuff and then that ended up leading to me thinking about how my grandparents have been together for a really long time and how cute and devoted they are. Now does that make sense? My brain confuses me sometimes and because of that, that's why I sometimes wonder if I have add.   So tell me, is it illegal if you you're 18 and have sex with a 17 year old? Like what are the actual terms of rape. I had this convo with someone and ya I just got confused because yes 18 you are an adult, and 17 you are a minor and that isn't supposed to mesh..... but if you're a year apart? How does that work?   My back has had the worst spazum (sp?) ever, I don't like it.   I think this will be the first night I'll be giong to bed before 12 really before 1. That's amazing. I like that.   Goodnight.

       17 is a weird age. You don't feel much older but when you say you're 17 compared to 16 there's a big difference. 17 you're more mature you know how to handle situations better and you've become more responsible. But at the same time you get like no new privileges by law when you turn 17 making you still feel like you're just a kid. Although I notice no difference, I still like being 17.   My birthday didn't feel so much like a birthday, but I think half of that is because I've been doing stuff and "partying" like every single day this summer. It did have some more special aspects though so it's all good. Thanks to everyone who did something special.   Things I like that have happened in the past couple of days:  Roses Phone calls from people you don't talk to every day Jet Skis Sun Skirts Nice emails My friends Boyfriends Hot tubs  Things I don't like that have happened in the past couple of days:  Throwing up Greasy food Coldness Crabiness Tierdness Dirtyness Stomach aches  Welp, that's all I got for now I suppose. I gotta go to my soccer game now. Everythings none stop, I kind of feel like the energizer bunny, but then I realize that I really am tierd, but it's true, I just keep going and going and going..... (I just sleep when I sit).  KT

       So one day this girl met this guy. This girl tends to meet guys from other schools thanks to this one kid named Chris from Minnehaha. So this one night, she met another one of his friends named Sean. From seeing this cute boy from that first look, she new she had to.... hmmmm..... snipe him, ha.    First night it was just a meet and greet and the second night was pretty eventful, always good to get into a car accident with someone you first meet. Anyways so this girl had a little thing for this guy, but she later found out that night that he had a girlfriend..... turns out though he just dumped her..... not for this girl, but still.   Then this guy started to like this girl and this girl and guy started to hang out and talk more. Then it continued to dates and ya this girl has seen this guy many nights in a row. Although unofficial, and this girl very scared and lost in her own thoughts at times, I think this girl sniped this guy.   To Be Continued.....  P.S. Oh and I'm going camping from tomorrow till thursday.... just six girls including me.... ya I know we're going to die.... don't worry that I'll tell all.   : )~Kati

       I went "looking" for a job today, I have a feeling that that's going to go nowhere..... I still need one though, oy. :/  Man so I think I've decided what one of the worst feelings ever is. Well I wouldn't say worst, but ya a not so good one. Anticipation but no return. If that makes sense, it did to me. But ya like phone calls. I hate them so much, especially when you want someone to call you. Like if you're waiting for that one person to call or just anyone, the phone rings and your heart rate speeds up and you get butterflies in your stomach, but then when it's not that person, everything melts and crumbles into mush, I hate that so much. So that goes along with the rule, if you say you're going to call me, make sure you fricken call me because otherwise I sit there waiting and anticipating a phone call, but then when I don't get it, all goes to hell. Also, phone calls are nice period, even if there is no real reason to call..... keep that in mind.   I keep getting this lump in my throat, and it doesn't seem to go away.  kati

       Last night was eventful to say none of the less. I've never had so much go wrong in a night, but have it be so crazy yet interesting and fun at the same time. And my story begins.  So I hung out with people from Minnehaha and we decided to go to MOA to go bowling at Jillians, so we get there and turns out we had 15 min until it was only open to 21 years and older, then we were going to go see a movie, but voted that down and instead were going to go Airport bowling. So bascially our MOA trip was a waste, but meh whatev. So we were driving to this bowling place and there was a red light, but the guy in front of Emily slammed on their brakes (we were behind Emily) but whatev, she didn't hit him, but ya Sean (who I was with) didn't slam on his brakes either and he wasn't tailgating or doing anything illegal, he was being a good driver, but then his car totally hydroplaned and ya we didn't stop and crashed right into Emily. Luckily his car could still run so we went like 100 feet to a gas station. Emily's car only had a little scratch, but Sean's hood was totally like folded and his raidiator was hit in and his lights were broken. So ya he's car was jacked. So ya we waited like 30 min for his parents and then he had to go home sadly, and ya I feel really bad for him, that sucks. But ya then we're like ok lets just go to someones house.  So we went to my house watched a movie and then Emily and Gilby decided to go home at like 1, but then Emily couldn't find her keys. We searched every where inside and outside and we could still not find her keys and then kind of figured they were locked in her car.... So then we tryed to break into her car with a coat hanger and were quite unsuccessful. So we made Calvin drive like 20 min to come help, but he couldn't do it either, so they drove to Emily's like 20 min away to get her spare key and then came back again to find her key, yes in the car, in the trunk. So ya they finally left at 2:30 am. Crazy. Just when we all thought the car accident was enough, whoa.   So that was my night, funny because if we had gone by our originally plans, none of that would have happened, but whatev. I'm not gonna complain, it only sucks horribly for Sean and his car and his loss of driving privileges most likely.   Next night out, I'm walking.  Kati

       Everyone is just giving up. It seems when people can't deal with something they just stop and let it go as it nothing happened in the first place although everything did. I finally want to join them. I'm sick of things being spoiled or going wrong, and I'm sick of having to deal with my feelings and emotions, I just want to run away and not come back for a really long time. I just want to disappear from it all.   Here are a few song lyrics on how I feel:    Same Direction  whenever i step outside, somebody claims to see the light it seems to me that all of us have lost our patience. 'cause everyone thinks they're right, and nobody thinks that there just might be more than one road to our final destination  but i'm not ever going to know if i'm right or wrong 'cause we're all going in the same direction and i'm not sure which way to go because all along we've been going in the same direction  i'm tired of playing games, of looking for someone else to blame for all the holes in answers that are clearly showing for something to fill the space, was all of the time i spent a waste 'cause so many choices point the same way i was going.....  so why does there only have to be one correct philosophy? i don't want to go and follow you just to end up like one of them and why are you always telling me what you want me to believe? i'd like to think that i can go my own way and meet you in the end.  but i'm not ever going to know..........   Out of Control  i've done everything as you say, i followed your rules without question i though it would help me see things clearly but instead of helping me to see, i look around and it's like i'm blinded i don't wanna live like this so can you tell me?  where should i go? what should i do? i don't understand what you want from me 'cause i don't know if i can trust you or all of the things you've said to me and i may never know the answer to this endless mystery where should i go? what should i do? i don't understand what you want from me  i feel like i'm spinning out of control, try to focus but everythings twisted and all along i thought you would be there to let me know i'm not alone but in fact thats exactly what i was all alone and spinning out of control. out of control.....   Escape  another day goes without any change the feeling we live with still remains we're stuck in a whole and we're searching for anything to hold on to there has to be somewhere that we can be safe from the lives we live each day there has to be somewhere that we can be far away.....  we have to escape and i will go anywhere if you just lead the way escape to a place where we'll be together, together everyday we have to escape....  we could be living how we wanted to instead of doing things we're forced to do with no one to tell us that we should be going through what they went through there has to be someplace that nobody knows, somewhere we can only go there has to be somplace that we can be all alone.......  we have to escape.......   Never There  i'm filling up inside like i need to open wide and pour my heart out to you but i'll just get denied and all i wanted was someone to hear what i'm going though...  everytime that i need you around you're never there, you're never there because in my life is where i need you now but you're never there, you're never there  you were supposed to see all the signs i left right in front of your face you were supposed to be the closest thing to being me but you're the furthest away. away. thats because........  and i doubt that i will ever find out if there's a way to get out of feeling all alone 'cause lately i've been thinking maybe that no one's going to save me i'll do it on my own..........

       I'm so flippin excited for New York, two days and counting (not counting today that is). But ya New York is so awesome and it just makes it ten times better that I'm going there to play my favorite sport, lacrosse. I don't know there's just something about New York that draws my attention, it's so suddle, but so loud and out there. Everyone blends together even though the weirdest people on the planet are probably there, but still you can't seem to tell. It's my kind of place, it's somewhere you can be completely heard, yet at other times not heard at all, and I like that. New York is so intriging and just draws me in. I'll tell you more how I feel about New York once I visit Long Island.  Oh and I  love  Christopher Gilbert and ya I'm going to miss you oh so very much!!Oh and I  love  New York!!  I'm so happy I could pee my pants! ------by the way---- "You aint cool until you pee your pants." "If peeing your pants is cool, then I'm Miles Davis." "Gross!!"  Weeeeeeeeeeee Kati

       I love  guys , I hate guys. I have  guys , I don't.  I want  guys , I can have  guys , but I wont.   Guys  piss me off, and make me happy, but  guys  are also there to be very sappy. &nbsp;   Guys  make me mad,  guys  make me smile,  guys  make me sad,&nbsp;and  guys  make me run a mile (?).&nbsp;  Guys  put me down and  guys  pick me up, but all the time they're going to make me lost&nbsp;like a mut.   uiahdgauerhauehrauojao, that&nbsp;is how I feel towards  guys  right now, what is going on?   I hope you enjoyed  Guys - A Poem, by Kati Oakes. Until the next time.... I'll try to figure me out.    k

        She wipes the sweat off of her brow and looks up and smiles, smiles at what's to come. Looking back and seeing what she's accomplished, yet still regarding everything that's happened to her in the past, a rush of nervousness and excitement fulfill her body. She doesn't know what will happen, today, tomorrow, or in a year, but all she knows is that it will work out, it will work out no matter what the plan is,&nbsp;if there's a plan at all.    &nbsp;  As she encounters&nbsp;this day, she takes one step at a time,&nbsp;inspecting everything she passes. Inspecting the suddle&nbsp;oddly shaped cracks on the floor,&nbsp;to the shinny dust particles floating around the air as if they too&nbsp;were&nbsp;trying to reach a destination. &nbsp;Being totally intact with her surroundings, she closes her eyes and moves forward. Nothing to look back on now, she thinks, she knows what has happened, but she can only imagine what will.    &nbsp;  Today is a new day, she&nbsp;thought. And she grabbed this day as if to hold on for her dear life. She finally realized that every day is a new day, every day is a new life. Although she never knew her destination, she looked back to those specks in the air, and knew, knew that she controlled her destination, she controlled it every day.     &nbsp;  With this, she proudly lifted her head, and&nbsp;walked down&nbsp;the never ending road toward the melting sun slowly compressing the ground. Options were endless on this long slap of pavement, and she knew they would always be there until she reached that fire in the sky. With each moment of her foot meeting with the pebbled ground, she finally knew what she had to do; live each day as if it was the very beginning, yet still the very end.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Seriously I think guys, or this guy, think I'm dumb, like really they except me not to read the lines in between and expect to get away with everything and anything. I'm not though, I'm not what they think, I'm not a dumbass.  When a guy tells you that he just doesn't want to be attached during college and doesn't want to be attached the rest of the summer because of that just so "he doesn't get hurt" is bullshit. Guys language this is I want to be able to mess around with other people for the rest of the summer, and clearly in college.  When a guy goes and makes out with someone else when he has a girlfriend, those girlfriends clearly aren't going to be fooled by this, I'd hope not, they have their way. If you make out with someone in front of people at a party and then take a fricken picture with this other girl while touching her boobs or what not, the girlfriend is not the dumbass at this point, the boyfriend is. Like seriously what the hell do they expect? How do they not expect their girlfriend to find out even if they go to a different school? Every girlfriend has their way of finding out some how.  Actually, I'm done with this blog, it isn't worth my time or energy to write about such bullshit. And this guy is defiently not worth my time or energy and is not worth stressing out about. I'm not a dumbass, it ends now.

       I'm putting my foot down, no longer am I going to be walked over by guys and be hurt by them, instead I'm now going to trip them to help them with their fall. Losing a boyfriend is not worth getting sad over and not worth crying over. For now I see it as their lose, especially with the reasons I have been given. If guys don't like me for me or like me too much and don't want to get hurt and run away instead, then that's their problem..... not mine.   Shit happens and I'm no longer going to freak out about it because it isn't nessacary, jerks and assholes are not worth my time. My name is Kati and this is who I am, no more giving into to guys because they do something sweet even though it isn't genuine. I'm not giong to be fooled into thinking my fairy tail is being made when it isn't being made with the right guy, clearly.   Welcome to my life.   kati

       My puzzle was put together, but someone broke it. Funny how it feels like only this one person can put it together. It was so real.... and now it's fading... fading out of my hands. How do I not lose this?       Pieces of Me On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you And the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me  Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care When I'm angry, you listen When youre happy, it's a mission And you wont stop 'til I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast Well, I hit that bottom Crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face... I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms... So I can breathe  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I love the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...

       How can something so right go so wrong?! Seriously, what is going on?! I wish everything has been a dream or was a nightmare, but I can't. How can you help someone change the way they think about something? You just can't, why am I so helpless? I don't understand why a month should be missed out because of one day. Urgh I'm lost again.  I love my friends.  I just have to remember that all fairy tales have a happy ending.... hopefully this on does too.  k

       As she sits on her couch after being awake for an hour, anxiousness and overwhelment take over her body. Sitting and watching tv just didn't sound too much like a good time. She needed to start her day, but couldn't without this call.   Ring, ring.... as her heart plummented to her stomach in hope of hearing his voice, she picked up the phone in no other to her a pause followed by a high pitched voice pernouncing every syllable wrong in the name. In the middle of their sentence, she hangs up in dissapointment of this expected call. Five more of these calls and she just couldn't take it, she had to hear his voice; and she did.   After finally talking to this guy, she made plans to be with him the whole day, which she did do. However, this day was different for her, but she didn't exactly know why. Moodiness had swung through her after his first jokingly comment and all she wanted to do was cry. Her thoughts of paranoia controlled her, while little voices were speaking "make it stop, you know nothing is wrong, why are you doing this?" She couldn't help herself at this point though, her emotions took the lead.  Throughout the whole night, she was up and down and didn't know where to start or where to even end, she needed help from this guy to make her find her way. After a whole night of struggling to stay at the top, to stay completely satisfied by him, it finally ended, with, of course, the winner on top.   She laid in his arms comfortable as could be and all she could think about was "why worry? He's all yours." Every day people learn a valuable lesson, but today, today it meant something to her. Moodiness shouldn't control feelings or emotions, she learned, but you're brain and heart combined should, if it feels right, it is right, if he chose you, you're it.   With this thought and with the relaxation of her body compressed in his arms, she just watched him and looked him in his eyes. She saw his sparkle and thereafter felt butterflies fluttering in her stomach. She slowly laid her head back down with a smile, thinking, "I could stay like this forever." With that sparkle in his eyes, she knew he had just helped her find her way.   And that voice that truely started her day, ended it with a kiss goodnight.   Funny because fairy tales can happen to you every single day.   Muah Kati

       I've always heard about Sex and the City and listened to people's rants about how good that show is. Unfourtunately, I was not able to express the same feelings seeing that I did not have access to the wonderful channel of HBO. I never really understood why people would be so infatuated with one show, but I finally figured it out.   Because my sister watched the show many times at her friends houses, she too became part of this obsessive group of wanting more "sex in the city." With this, our family ended up getting all the seasons on DVD. However, it was not until last night, that I decided to venture into the world of women living vicariously with sex in New York. And I now understand.   10 episodes in one day, you could call that obsessive, but really what it is, is the connection with you, that tv, and those four women "living" out their lives. Really I think why people like it so much is because we all secertly, or not secertly, want to be like them.   Never before has sex and the city sounded so good.   Kati

       This is to everyone who read my away message tonight, I now know not to leave my messages open to interpretation. That and maybe I should just keep it simple.... or simpler than it was..... meaning no names and right to the point.   Here are some of the responses I got:    Slickchic525 [12:42 AM]:   maifha;bn vrhj iriagj ;gjaidfg ri ;arguakre thg rega; gi;gja gjafklivnaregkl ;adfjkiencv fieaigeng;agidv;eg ibja;fgjai fdn ifaighghi   Auto response from ChickaSS31 [12:42 AM]: 	movie with sean   sShafftey [1:49 AM]:   bah sean  Auto response from ChickaSS31 [1:49 AM]: 	movie with sean   canelsonmn [12:48 AM]:   ick  Auto response from ChickaSS31 [12:48 AM]: 	movie with sean   canelsonmn [1:35 AM]:   im sorry  However you may want to think about it, you sick litte freaks, all my message meant was that I was watching a movie with Sean. I thought it was simple and good enough, but I now have learned better. Next time when Sean and I watch a movie it'll go something like this:  I'm sitting on my couch watching  [specific name]  with Sean. Although he is my boyfriend and some of you may interpret this differently, really all we're doing is watching a movie.... really what else would there be to do in St. Louis Park? Thank you for your time.   If you have any complaints about this please email.... or leave a comment : )  k

       So based upon this breaking news report I just heard, does this mean you can't make those delicious waffles you drooled upon?? I've dreamed about the moment I'd be able to taste them, I've been waiting for that moment. When I heard the news I almost started to cry. What will happen now Jeff?!  Hmmm lets go out to eat where the waffles are professionally done and where we wont have to worry about.... hmmm.... best way to put it..... worry about what happened last time.... ; )  Turns out I have to wake up at 6:30, what the hell am I doing?   And in the morning were EATING waffles! (except not tomorrow morning)  BYE JEFF!  kAtI  In loving memory of all broken down waffle irons in this world.

       Ok, I am officially fed up with anonymous people leaving dick ass comments. First of all everyone should have enough balls to write their name when they leave a comment, no matter the tone of it. Second of all if you do have enough balls to be rude and to try to be superior, then you really should be able to put your name, otherwise that just makes you more of a pussy. I don't know if you are the same person who is constantly correcting me and not even noticing what I'm actually writing about, but still it's really getting on my nerves and well is rude as hell. Yes sorry if I make a few mistakes, but is it really necessary to go out of your way to point this out? Ya, no I didn't think so, and if it is, then at least say who the hell you are. Maybe you're a good friend of mine and depending on who you are could change everything, but again I woudln't know this because you are  ANONYMOUS  and therefore it's just plain out rude. Even if you aren't being rude,  anonymous people still suck , sorry, but true, even if I don't know you, a name would be nice.  Sorry for this blog being negative, and negative toward other people, but really this is annoying and from now on I would appreciate it if everyone left their name and most of all didn't leave rude unnecessary comments. Thank you for your time.  kati

       Cosmopolitan aka The Bible, is genious, pure genious. I've finally upgraded myself from Seventeen and YM to Cosmo, and I love it. This magazine can help you in any situation, and not just sexually. But really if you are embarrassed to ask something to anyone, Cosmo will have all the answers.   Here is some of my favorite advice/learnings of Cosmo's latest issue:  "You know that knee-numbing buzz you get from locking eyes with a hottie across the bar? There's a biological reason for it, according to a study from the Institue of Congnitive Neuroscience at University College London. It found that stealing a stare from an attractive stanger lights up part of the brain that predicts a reward, says Uta Frith, PhD, coauthor of the study. Whether your brain is anticipating "Mmm... boyfriend material!" or "Ooh, hot fling tonight!" it's a green-lighting you to indulge in a little fantasy. To feel the spark, position yourself in his natural line of vision, then give him a sexy glance as he catches you laughing with pals."  This is really genious, and ya now, if you are ever nervous or hesitant to get into a relationship or whatever, look for this sign, and if you get it, you know all is well.   Signs He's Not in the Mood:  -He falls asleep in the middle of a hand job. -You bring home lingerie, and he says, "Are you sure purple is really your color?" -As you're about to get it on, his mom's number pops up on the caller ID and he actually picks up.   Hmmm there's much more, such as Cosmo telling you how to give a good hand job, and how to find your G-spot. That and Keira Knightley is on the cover, and well ya I love her, if I were gay, ok no scratch that, if I were straight, I'd do her. Hahaha.   Best wishes on your sexual encounters.   k

       I just got back from a lacrosse camp in Long Island, New York yesterday. It was so much fun and amazing. I couldn't love New York and the people there anymore. The lacrosse players there though are like freaking amazing. Some of them were only going to be like freshmen or sophmores and they had like some of the best stick skills I have ever seen, showing that they were probably better then any Minnesotan player. However, I was still able to keep up with all of them and was pretty much up to par, the only difference was that they had some amazing moves and stick skills, but ya I'm working on it and I'd like to think I got better from the camp.  The people there in general were so cool too. I might some really tight kids and it just makes me like New York and New Yorkers even more. People always talk about how New Yorkers have such an attitude and I'm not gonna lie, they do, but that's half of what I love about them. Although they may have this big ass attitude they are still some of the nicest people I've ever met. Most people are really surprisingly friendly.   The best thing about New Yorkers though is their accent. We got made fun of for ours, and now I can see why, they have the coolest accents there and they were all trying to teach us it. Here's an interpretation:  Pantsing = Shanking Dog = Dawg Coffee = Caouffee Ball = Bawl Sucker = Lolli Pop  And ya pretty much anything with an a or o were over said and pernounced with like a W. Ask me if you wanna hear em. Man do I love those accents.  I couldn't have had a better experience and am so glad I went. It was also nice to just get away although the day I get back I'm still annoyed with my mom and well still confused about....well.... everything.   I'm still probably kind of out of it though, I was either at an airport or on a plane for like 9 hours yesterday, whoa.   Yeah for New York! (And layovers in Chicago).
