      Christianity is based solely on the book known as the bible. It is the best selling book of all time, but ironically it is probably one of the least read books around.   Roughly eighty percent of the U.S. population claims to be Christian. Despite this, if you ask the average person on the streets of America to name five commandments, I can almost guarantee you that they will not be able to do so successfully without mentioning the sixth or eighth. A sad state of affairs I would say for a nation that is mostly Christian.  There are more than two hundred and fifty complete Judeo-Christian writings that have been found from the early parts of this past millennium. All are stories, teachings, and other messages from "god", and all are similar in style to the ones found in the modern bible. Only sixty-six of these are contained in the bible (seventy seven in the roman catholic bible). How was the decision made to put certain writings in and not others? Was it inspiration from god? Hardly.  For the first one hundred and fifty years after Jesus's birth (the reality/unreality of which will be discussed at a later time), there was no bible. The people of that time, to include the apostles, twelve disciples (well if you add the names of the disciples listed in the gospels, you get thirteen even though Matthew 10:1 says Jesus had twelve), and early christians used the Jewish books of the Old Testament for their bible. In fact, there were over one hundred books that were written as gospels: stories relating the life of Jesus. This number was trimmed down to four in the latter half of the second century by  urlLink St.Irenaeus . Did he do this because god told him to do so? Here is the reason St.Irenaeus himself gave, "There are four quarters of the earth in which we live and four universal winds." Sounds a bit more like the reasoning of a pagan than a christian, doesn't it? It is also important to remember that St.Irenaeus did not canonize these gospels until the last half of the second century. There were no "gospels" for the disciples, or even for Paul who is the most prolific author in the new testament.  Well what about the men who wrote these gospels? Well it is impossible that they even came from the area of Palestine considering the many geographical and legal errors that exist in the Bible. The gospels speak numerous times about incorrect travel routes, cities, and other such geographical items. In Mark 10:12, Jesus speaks of a woman divorcing her husband, and that her act is considered adultery. This was a legal impossibility at the time, something a person living there would have known. Why would Jesus teach the people this, when the only known divorce was that of a husband divorcing the wife? It is obvious that the person writing this was not very aware of well known laws regarding marriage. Also take into account that there is very little originality from one gospel to another, and it's hard to believe that these were eye witnesses, as bible scholars claim. Had they witnessed Jesus's life, wouldn't there be a number of things said in one gospel that weren't said in the others? It seems likely. Instead, we find roughly the same miracles and parables, rife with inter-gospel discrepancies in contradictions. There are so many I will not go into them all there, but as an example, compare Matthew 28:1-8 to John 20:1-18. In Matthew we have Mary Magdalene and the other Mary going to Jesus's tomb. There an angel tell them that Jesus has risen and where to find him. The women run away with great joy to tell the disciples. In John, we have Mary Magdalene running to the disciples, yelling about how somebody stole Jesus's body and that she doesn't know where he is. As the disciples were in the tomb looking around, Mary stood outside crying. Jesus appears to her and talks to her. There are a number of discrepancies between these two account alone. How did Mary Magdalene find out Jesus had risen? Was it an angel, or Jesus himself that told her? I will delve more into the contradiction that is the bible at a later date. Suffice to say that these people did not have their stories straight.   I suppose this is acceptable as they were written between a few decades and an entire century or more after Jesus lived! It would be very hard I'm sure for an old man to remember, in perfect detail, things he saw when he was a young boy. Alas, we are talking about the bible here, and it is inspired by god. Why would god purposefully put discrepancies and blatant contradictions in the only thing teaching us how to avoid the fires of the hell he has prepared for us? It's simple. He didn't. The bible is nothing more than ancient Judeo-Christian writings, that were slapped together by men as fallible as you and I centuries ago.  The bible has changed so much over the thousands of years since Jesus's life that it is hard to take it seriously. It has had dozens of iterations, translations, and interpretations. Why, the modern bible with sixty six books wasn't even put together until as recently as 1647, almost two millennia after Jesus lived!

      Atheism literally means "without theology". It is not the hatred of god, nor is it a religion or set of rules. I am an atheist because I have no religious beliefs. Atheists are only united in their lack of religious belief, and come from all walks of life including doctors, lawyers, truck drivers, homeless, teachers, etc. I don't believe the bible is the inspired word of god, I don't believe that Jesus was the saviour of mankind, and find it doubtful that he even lived.  I am not an atheist because no one has ever "witnessed" to me, or told me about Jesus or any other religion and their leaders. In fact, if you read  urlLink this , you will see that I was a pretty much hardcore, fundamentalist baptist for a number of years. I think it's important to point out that this was not taught to me by my parents, so I do fall into what some think to be the common stereotype. This stereotype is that atheists are usually only atheists in rebellion to religion being forced down their throats while growing up.  I made this site to expose the many lies, hypocrasies, and contradictions that are supposed "truths" in the bible. I was an avid bible studier, and still read the bible on occasion, mainly when I'm doing research, so I know the bible to a fair degree. It is safe to say, in my opinion, that I probably know the bible much better than most of the roughly 80% of americans that declare themselves "christian".   urlLink Here are some great quotes by Madalyn O'Hair , a prolific atheist activist. They sum up my feelings quite well.

      My wife and I grew up with basically no religion.  I was raised a CnE (christmas and easter) catholic, and when I was 21 (my wife was 19), we found God. I had heard of "The Last Temptation of Christ" and figured if the church hated it, then it MUST be good. I rented it and became more curious about the life of Jesus, dug up an old Bible we had laying around behind other books, and started reading. I got hooked, and the two of us started going to church with a friend at my work.   We became devout baptists and went to church Sunday morning and evening, and Wednesday night. Every other night usually involved a bible study between my wife and I. We became alienated from our friends, but luckily I was convincing enough to get most of my "unsaved" heathen catholic family to join the bandwagon.   Well after a couple years, I started to question. The most (only?) true thing in the Bible is (Matthew 18:3) where Jesus says you have to be as a child in order to get into heaven. How do children react to things? They usually accept them with very little convincing required. It's the same as a christian, the less you think and question it, the more it makes sense. Adults usually need much more convincing before they will believe something. Well after being a Christian for a couple years, and being very hardcore in my beliefs, I started questioning things as an adult. These seeds of doubt led me to research things and eventually broke with my religion, and my wife followed as I found out she had been having the same thoughts as well. All in all, it was about 3-4 years that we were Christians for.   It was scary giving that up, but felt so good to finally be free. I felt as if I had woken up finally after so long of living with a sleeping mind. I began reading again, listening to music, and basically started learning again. It felt so good...  I told my family and friends I was agnostic, that I believed in a god, but wasn't sure who or what it was. I really just said this to cushion the blow for myself and them, as it was hard to go straight from devout baptist to atheism. Everyone thought I was flaky of course, and I can't tell you how many times I heard the line, "How can you go from being that religious to being not religious overnight?" Well, it wasn't overnight I would tell them, as it grew over about a year. I spent a good year tithing, reading the bible, teaching the bible, converting people to christianity, etc. when I didn't believe. It just took a while to build up the courage to split from it.  We've been  non-church goers for about 3 years now. I've had many debates with people about religion/god/the bible, etc. since then, and my prior theist life has made it easy to dispute their claims in most cases. Most usually end with them stating, "Oh...well I'll have to look that up and get back to you," or changing the subject. I feel my religious experience was good as I have learned quite a bit. Before I was a christian, I never knew what to believe. By going through the years as a devout christian, I learned a lot about that lifestyle and belief system. I also learned it is false. As Nietzsche said, "That which does not kill me strengthens me." Instead of being in a belief-limbo as I was before finding religion, I am now positively sure that it is not reality. But I wasn't always sure I was an atheist.  On July 2nd, 2004, I stumbled across  urlLink this site , and had a theological epiphany. My atheism was made apparent to me, when it wasn't something I had thought about much. While there, I found  urlLink this  article. It was just a one-shot study, but I found the idea of an "atheist bible study" quite humorous. It sounded sort of like an oxy-moron at first, but then I thought about how most atheists know more about the bible than christians do. So I decided to launch a site dedicated to studying the bible, to expose the errancies within it.  I hope you enjoy the site, and I encourage you to post comments. Have a great day!

      Today, I was going to post about something other than what follows. However, in my morning internet browsing, I stumbled upon  urlLink this page . Simply disgusting. I felt I had to say something about it here.  The answer is so obvious, and it just goes to show that Christians know nothing about biology, sex, or any other form of science for that matter. They simply take statistics and use them as evidence to support their hate. Funny how they can use one science (statistics) to push their case, but ignore another (biology) that explains the statistics.  It's quite obvious to me that the reason that the majority of HIV patients are homosexual. You see, it is a well known fact that sexual transmission of the HIV virus is much more "successful" from a male partner. Men pass HIV to women much more frequently than women pass it to men. I can hear the Johnston family saying,  "Well that just proves HIV was designed to destroy homosexuals!"  Hardly. I'm sure they realize, as I do, that lesbians are homosexuals also right? Why would god design the plague to kill off homosexuals and not make it easily transferable from women to women? Perhaps god is just as infatuated with some hot girl on girl action as the rest of males are. Maybe the Johnston family would just say this is more proof that god is a man?  I have to take an aside here also to wonder about something. I wonder exactly what it is that the peoples of Africa have done to piss off god so much. I mean, they represent about ten percent of the world's population, but posses roughly seventee percent of the world's HIV cases. This is even more extreme than homosexuals with their ten to sixty percent ratio!  Next up in the article we see the silly argument about digging ditches or eating pudding. Of course, we all know you could eat pudding off of a shovel and not be harmed, or dig a ditch (while it may take some time) with a spoon while avoiding bodily injury. These are just more of the whacked-out analogies that Christians often use.  Next we see the invariable proof that the penis was designed for procreation. The article says that you don't need to read the bible to know this. They say the penis's only purpose is urination and procreation. Well, I've had some very fun times with my penis, and they didn't involve urination or procreation. The fact that the penis is used for sexual pleasure is missed by Christians I guess. Who would have imagined that? Oh let's not forget the obligatory,  "We're talking about gays so let's not forget our witty Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve line"   Following, we see the argument about gays not being born gay. The Christians always say that gays choose to be gay. This argument is fallible on two accounts.  One , when does a straight person choose to be straight? I know that I never did. It was just natural for me, as I'm sure it is for most homosexuals. The proof that people can be born with mis-matched wiring between mind and sex-organ is evident in the fact that there are people born with both sex organs. Doctor's usually end up amputating one and leaving the other. How do they know which one the infant's brain is wired for? This person may grow up with a female brain, but male sex organs.  Two , why, in this world of bigotry against homosexuals, would someone choose to be gay? They are simply exposing themselves to discrimination, hardship, and hate. This makes no sense.  The article continues to site how violent the homosexual lifestyle is. It lists how high the suicide rate is among homosexuals. I wonder why this is? Could it be due to the fact that generally, homosexuals are hated, vilified, crucified and demonized by a large portion of the population? Could it be sites and propaganda such as the Johnston family's website that make the homosexual life incredibly difficult, when it needs not be?  The percentages on gay drug use are so varied and in such a wide range that it seems obvious these statistics are probably made up, and if not made up, these survey are completely invalid due to the huge range of difference between them.  The section on serial killers being gay as evidence how evil homosexuals are is completely ridiculous. The site even says that  "Leading serial killers are  all  homosexual!!!"  The emphasis on "all" is their own. This statement is completely false. Just type "serial killers" into google and you'll see that the dozen or so killers listed on the ministry's site are no where near the leading killers. Some I found are Pedro Alonso Lopez (three hundred plus murders), H.H.Holmes (two hundred-plus murders), Hu Wanlin (one hundred plus murders), Richard "Iceman" Kuklinski (forty or more murders), and Moses Sithole (at least thirty eight murders), were all heterosexual serial killers. In fact, the majority are. I would say that Pedro Alonso Lopez, with at least three hundred murders would be much more of a "leading serial killer" than the ones listed on that page with a meager thirty or forty murders. Why, Jefferey Dahmer only killed seventeen people, while the very heterosexual Ted Bundy managed at least twenty-two! According to their logic that homosexuals are more likely to be serial killers because some were, Moses should be a serial killer, because a serial killer is named Moses! Well we all know Moses wasn't a serial killer...well, not counting  urlLink leading a nation to commit genocide  against a number of peoples and all that.  Near the end of this article, we find more statistics about how homosexuals are more likely to be murdered and commit suicide. We've already gone over this. With all the hate the Christians foster against homosexuals, is it any surprise?  We end the article with quotes from the book of god's love, the bible. Here it tells us how much god hates gays. It says, "If you are not compliant with the moral law of God, which forbids ALL lust, including masturbation and homosexuality, you are headed for HELL!!!" Sure, the bible says that a sodomite is  "...an abomination unto the Lord"  in Deuteronomy 23:17-18, but it also says in Deutoronomy 22:5 that women that wear men's clothing (pants, anyone?) are  "...an abomination unto the Lord"  I wonder if most Christians women who wear pants are aware that they are just as an abomination in god's eyes as homosexuals? Paul even writes in Romans 1:32-33 that homosexuals are  "worthy of death" . So remember this next time you need someone to kill. No need to seek out a homosexual, just find a woman wearing pants!   What about homosexuality in the bible? It is all condemned, is it not?  If you read 1 Samuel 18:1 in the bible, it would seem that David ( one of the most respected old testament kings ), and Jonathan, had a sexual relationship,  "...Jonathan became one in spirit with David and he loved him as himself."  I think we can all agree that loving yourself could have a wide range of meanings. In 1 Samuel 18:2 the bible says,  "From that day, Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house."  Sounds like kidnapping and forced sex to me. It gets hotter, with 1 Samuel 18:3-4 being almost explicit,  "And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt."  People back then didn't wear undergarments, so this means Jonathan stripped naked in front of David. In 1 Samuel 20:41 the bible says,  "After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with is face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together - but David wept the most."  These quotes are from the New International Version, and it's funny to note that in every translation save The Living Bible translation, it says they kissed. In the Living bible, it says here,  "...and they sadly shook hands, tears running down their cheeks until David could weep no more."  The translators couldn't stand the thought of two men kissing to such an extent that they mistranslated the Hebrew text! Later, in 2 Samuel 1:26 the bible says,  "I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women."  It's obvious that David valued the love and companionship of Jonathan more than women from this statement alone! It was not proper for a man to have a platonic relationship with a woman, so the only relationship, or "love" David would be referring to here would be sexual love. It would seem strange for David to be comparing platonic love for a man with sexual love for a woman.  Another possible sexual relationship exists between one of the most well known prophets, Daniel, and Ashpenaz, the chief of the court officials of Nebuchadnezzar, who was the King of Babylon. It is in Daniel 1:9, and the New International Version of the bible translates the ancient texts to say,  "Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel." , the King James Version says,  "Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs." , while the Revised Standard Edition says,  "And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs."  The original Hebrew language used here to describe the nature of their relationship is "chesed v'rachamim". "Chesed" means "mercy", and "v'rachamim" means "mercy" or "physical love". It seems unlikely that the bible would say that Daniel had "mercy and mercy" for Ashpenaz, as it is redundant. It seems to make more sense that it says "mercy and physical love", does it not?  In conclusion, I think it's safe to say that Christians really don't follow the entire bible. There are references to homosexual relationships between well known biblical figures, not to mention the fact that Jesus said that anyone who believes and has faith in him would go to heaven. I think it's safe to say that everyone includes homosexuals.

      I have often heard people ask why atheists are constantly arguing with christians about the bible and their religion. Why do atheists care about christianty? I've always thought that the reasons were self-evident.  There have been thousands of years worth of torture, intolerance, murder, genocide, rape, infanticide, patricide, and more, committed in the name of this religion. It seems obvious why someone who doesn't believe would want to do whatever he or she could to educate the mindless masses about this christian disease.  Just now I ran into  urlLink this scathing article  that perfectly puts into words what I am getting at. It is a definite must-read.  Because this is a bible study, I will provide just a few nice passages from the bible for you to check out, illustrating just how sick and twisted this Yawhooeyeeyeooh is.   Desire for bloodshed:   Genesis 4:3-5  "In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell."   I just wanted to start here because it's a good example of how god's chosen method of appeasement is bloodshed.    Infanticide:   Exodus 7:4-12:29   Here, god hardens Pharaoh's heart so that he can bring terrible plagues down upon Egypt, culminating in the slaughter of every firstborn living creature in Egypt, right down to the cows. How does god know not to kill Moses's peoples' children? They have to kill a prefect lamb and smear it's blood outside their homes, that's how. Yet again, more bloodshed. God isn't satisfied just killing off the firstborn of Egypt. No, he wants to make sure that even though he's not killing at that house, something will be killed. But wait, why does he need this sign? Isn't he all knowing? But I digress...   Torture, mutilation, rape:   Ezekiel 23:1-49   Here, two sisters who each had children press their breasts together. Their punishment? The first has her children taken from her, and then she is killed with a sword. The other sister is forced to rip off her own breasts, and has her ears and nose cut off. To top it off, she is then gangbanged, mutilated, and stoned to death. Oh, and their homes were burned, followed by their sons and daughters being slain.  Just to show that the cruelty of god isn't just the domain of the old testament, here are some from the new testament.   Death by worms:   Acts 12:23   "And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost."    Forced hallucination, delusions, damnation:  2 Thessalonians 2:11-12  "And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."   God makes people delusional, and when they believe the lies of the delusion, they are damned by him.  I'm not even going to get into the devastations found in Revelation. Let me just conclude by reminding you that god wants you to suffer. When you do suffer (according to god's will), make sure you remain faithful to him and keep doing good.   1 Peter 4:19 "Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."

      How are we to raise our children? Without god, we are surely lost in regards to parenting our offspring. After all, god is the source of morality and all that is good, is he not? Surely his teachings on parenting are to be followed. Where can we find his teachings on parenting? You guessed it, the bible.  I will start off with the following passage, where god tells his people what to do with his rules and laws.   Deuteronomy 6: 6-9 "Repeat them again and again to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are away on a journey, when you are lying down and when you are getting up again. Tie them to your hands as a reminder, and wear them on your forehead. Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."   The part about tying god's rules to your hands and forehead brings to mind the orthodox jewish sect know as the Hasidic, whom put small sacred parchments into tiny black leather boxes known as  "t'filin" , and then tie them ritualistically around their arm and forehead.  The main thing to remember here is that we are instructed by the bible in many places to follow god's law. Here it is made apparent that you must also pass them down to your children, and incorporate them into every part of your life, right down to gluing a bible to your forehead or something.  This passage is further supported in the new testament in the book of ephesians.   Ephesians 6: 4 "And now a word to you fathers. Don't make your children angry by the way you treat them. Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction approved by the Lord."   So we now see in both the old and the new testaments the importance of ensuring your children know about god's laws. God's laws and commandments are to be passed down from generation to generation. These laws include instructions on parenting as well. So let us start our examination of parenting in the bible with a very well known couple, Isaac and Rebekah.   Favoritism is acceptable to god, even if such favoritism leads to family strife of gigantic proportions.   Isaac was so important to god that his birth was prophesied ( Genesis 17:16 ) and was born to a mother who was over ninety years old! God promised Abraham that his son would inherit god's kingdom and be the heir of the abramic covenant ( Genesis 19: 19, 21 ). I would put some info here about Isaac's wife, Rebekah, but the bible is strangely silent about her life before marrying. In fact, this is a common theme throughout the bible, where the women's lives don't seem to begin until they marry a man. In Genesis, Adam begets sons and daughters ( Genesis 5:4 ), but these women are nameless and just about the last women whose' births are mentioned in the bible.  Isaac barley survives his father sacrificing him to god ( Genesis 22: 1-19 ), and when Isaac's mother Sarah dies, his father buys him a wife and he is  "...comforted after his mother's death."  ( Genesis 24: 1-67 ).God also reminds us that Abraham followed god's laws. Remember it was god that told Abraham he should sacrifice his son Isaac, and only at the last minute did he tell him not to. I think it's funny that even though Isaac wasn't killed for god, god still demanded Abraham kill an animal of some sort. Later, god appears to Isaac, and promises to give Isaac many things.   Genesis 26: 3-5 "Do as I say, and stay here in this land. If you do, I will be with you and bless you. I will give all this land to you and your descendants, just as I solemnly promised Abraham, your father. I will cause your descendants to become as numerous as the stars, and I will give them all these lands. And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed. I will do this because Abraham listened to me and obeyed all my requirements, commands, regulations, and laws."   Obviously god loves and cares about Isaac to a large degree, as he is picking Isaac's descendants to bless the world through.  So time passes, and Isaac and Rebekah have two children. Before they were born, the lord told Rebekah that they would be enemies. How nice. She's sold to someone, impregnated, and god himself comes to tell her that two whole nations of people would be separated ( Genesis 25:23 ). The twins were then born, Esau followed by Jacob.  We find out early that Esau was a hunter, while Jacob was a plain man, who just seems to have sat around all day in the tent ( Genesis 25: 27 ). Rebekah loved Jacob, and Isaac loved Esau. We see no indication that either parent loved the other child. So our first lesson in parenting is that it is okay to love one child but not the other.  The first interaction we see between the brothers is in Genesis 25: 29-34. Esau comes back from a hunt, and is starving to death. He asks his brother for some food, and Jacob has some available. What does Jacob do? He refuses. Jacob says that he will only give food to his dying brother if Esau gives up his birthright to him. Esau is the older brother so he has their father's birthright. Esau, stating that it would be better to live with no birthright than to die, accepts. It is in this manner that Jacob obtains the birthright. What a loving brother.  The conflict between the brothers continues in Genesis 27: 1-46. Who is the orchestrator of this conflict? None other than the twins' mother, Rebekah. She overhears Isaac ( who is basically blind ) telling Esau that he will gain a blessing if he goes to fetch venison for his father. Esau agrees, and leaves to hunt. Rebekah goes to her little mamma's-boy Jacob, and tells him that she will cook up a couple goats and make them taste like venison. Thereby, Jacob will be able to win the blessing, not knowing it is Jacob bringing him the food, as he is blind. Well Rebekah puts Esau's clothing on Jacob and goats hair on his hands so he will appear hairy to his father if he should touch him. Jacob does this, and wins his father's blessing that was meant for Esau.  When Esau comes back, he is filled with sorrow at hearing that the blessing has already been given to Jacob. Even after being deceived, does Isaac give the blessing to Esau? Even when Esau cries out to his father and weeps? No. In fact, he gives a mixed blessing/curse to Esau, including the line from Genesis 28: 40  "And by the sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother..."  It seems that after realizing he was lied to and deceived by his other son with the help of his wife, he would not only give the blessing to Esau, but would have some well justified anger towards his conniving wife and other son.  Well, understandably, after having both his birthright and his father's blessing taken from him by his younger, snake-in-the-grass of a brother, Esau is a little angry. So angry, in fact, he threatens to kill Jacob. Of course, Rebekah comes to the little pansy's rescue and instead of facing up to his deeds, is spirited away to another country by his mother.   Use clubs to beat your children, stone them to death if they are disobedient.   This one is simple. The passages in the bible that instruct you to beat your child are numerous. Some even require you to use an instrument, such as a rod. I will list a few here.   Proverbs 23: 13-14 "Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with a rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with a rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell."   This next verse lets us know how stupid children are...   Proverbs 22:15 "Folly is bound up in the heart of a child..."   And how do we fix this?   Proverbs 22:15 continued "...but the rod of discipline drives it far from him."   This next one tells you that "blows" and "strokes" are good for a child. To me, those two words imply something such as a club or whip, not just a smack on the butt.  Next, we are instructed to make sure to cause actual wounds, so we purge the evil away.   Proverbs 20:30 "Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts"   Here's one of my personal favorite bits of loving parenting advice from god.   Deuteronomy 21: 18-21 "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they chastise him, will not give heed to them, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city...and they shall say to the elders of his city, 'This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard. Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones; so you shall purge the evil from the midst"   I can't help but laugh out loud when I read that. To accentuate the hilarity of it, check out this page on the ever amazing  urlLink Brick Testament Website . Even if  urlLink Pascal's Wager  was a reason to believe, I would rather serve satan in hell than the god of the bible in heaven. Remember this is the god that teaches us to beat our children and that a man will be happy if he  "...seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks"  ( Psalm 137:9 )while avenging the lord. Satan may not actually be so bad according to the bible, but that is a topic best left for another study.   Punish children for what their parents do.   It's amazing how anti-abortion most christians are, seeing that god has such little regard for children. They are punished throughout the bible for things they do not do. God endorses this idea time and time again.  I should take an aside here to mention how funny it is to me when people say, "Well our country's laws were based on the ten commandments!" Is that so? Sure, our laws may have certain things in common with the commandments of god, but that's it. Has our country every executed a man for a horse his great-great-grandfather stole back in the eighteen hundreds? I think not, and yet this is the type of law the bible teaches.   Exodus 34:7 "Maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation"    Deuteronomy 5:9 "You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me"   In the following well-known passage, god kills every firstborn child of Egypt because their king wouldn't listen to god. Not only the first born citizens, but the firstborn prisoners and animals.   Exodus 12:29 "At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well."    Numbers 13:33 "Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the desert."   This list is by no means exhaustive, but I believe it makes my point.   God commands people to eat children   What could be the ultimate human travesty? Of the million ways people have caused harm to each other throughout our history, I think that eating a child would definitely rank up there. If this subject is a bit disturbing, I'm sorry. Blame god, not me, because he commands it.  Here, if we fail to be nice to god, he will force us to eat our children.   Leviticus 26: 29 "You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters."   Next, because people have turned their back on god, he will force them to cannibalize their sons, daughters, and each other.   Jeremiah 19: 9 "I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh during the stress of the siege imposed on them by the enemies who seek their lives."   As if this weren't enough, here's some more.   Ezekiel 5: 10 "Therefore in your midst fathers will eat their children, and children will eat their fathers. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds."   Of course, I'm sure you know the whole basis of christianity is cannibalism, right? Here's Jesus teaching us that the only way to get into heaven is to cannibalize him.   John 6: 53-57 "Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me."    Pimp out your daughters, and have sex with them.  Our final lesson in biblical parenting is about Lot. Lot was Abraham's nephew, and settled in a city called Sodom ( Genesis 13:12 )  One day, angels appear to Lot outside of Sodom. They go into the city, and the cities inhabitants see the angels go into Lot's house. They surround the house and demand that Lot send the angels out so they can have sex with them. Lot is not willing to do so, but quickly offers to send his two virgin daughters out instead. Lot knows what god wants obviously, and this is devotion to him even at the cost of turning your two virgin daughters over to a mob of men battering down your door because they are so horny. Again,  urlLink The Brick Testament  shines in telling this story. The bible tells it in Genesis 19: 1-8  Later, after fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot is left wifeless after god turns her into a pillar of salt. He lives in a cave with his two daughters, who get him drunk and have sex with him in order that he may have descendants. This story is told in Genesis 19: 24-38. Of course,  urlLink The Brick Testament  does a great job with this story. I've been extremely drunk in my time, but I've never not known I was having sex with someone. It's the great cop-out for one night stands, and I can't belief Lot didn't know he was having sex with his own daughters. If he was that drunk, he would not have been able to perform.  This concludes our bible study on parenting. I hope it has been informative and educational. Now get out there and remember to beat your children as the lord commands, or he just might punish your disobedience by making you eat them! Hey that sounds like a nice verse, doesn't it?

      While browsing around today, I did not have the intentions to post something here. However, I ran across a very good description as to why I have this site. It is almost perfectly in-line with what I think about the bible and how it is used by most christians.  The following is taken from the site called  urlLink The Skeptics's Annotated Bible . The webmaster's story sounds exactly like mine, and what I felt as a Christian. It also discusses why it is important to study the bible. My motives are the same as theirs:  "...help those who believe in the Bible to honestly reconsider that belief. It will help those who are unfamiliar with the Bible to resist the temptation to believe. And it will help those who have already rejected the Bible defend their position.   It is time for us all to stop believing in, or pretending to believe in, a book that is so unworthy of belief."    All I can think to say to that, is AMEN! Lol. Here's the transcript, or  urlLink click here to go to the original page.     "For nearly two billion people, the Bible is a holy book containing the revealed word of God. It is the source of their religious beliefs. Yet few of those who believe in the Bible have actually read it.   This must seem strange to those who have never read the Bible. But anyone who has struggled through its repetitious and tiresome trivia, seemingly endless genealogies, pointless stories and laws, knows that the Bible is not an easy book to read. So it is not surprising that those that begin reading at Genesis seldom make it through Leviticus. And the few Bible-believers that survive to the bitter end of Revelation must continually face a disturbing dilemma: their faith tells them they should read the Bible, but by reading the Bible they endanger their faith.  When I was a Christian, I never read the Bible. Not all the way through, anyway. The problem was that I believed the Bible to be the inspired and inerrant word of God, yet the more I read it, the less credible that belief became. I finally decided that to protect my faith in the Bible, I'd better quit trying to read it.   I think most Bible-believers find themselves in that position -- although few will admit it. Not even to themselves.   The most popular solution to this problem is to leave the Bible reading to the clergy. The clergy then quote from the Bible in their writings and sermons, and explain its meaning to the others. Extreme care is taken, of course, to quote from the parts of the Bible that display the best side of God and to ignore those that don't. That this approach means that only a fraction of the Bible is ever referenced is not a great problem. Because although the Bible is not a very good book, it is a very long one.   But if so little of the Bible is actually used, then why isn't the rest deleted? Why aren't the repetitious passages -- which are often contradictory as well -- combined into single, consistent ones? Why aren't the hundreds of cruelties and absurdities eliminated? Why aren't the bad parts of the "Good Book" removed?   Such an approach would result in a much better, but much smaller book. To make it a truly good book, though, would require massive surgery, and little would remain. For nearly all passages in the Bible are objectionable in one way or another. But with a little luck and much careful editing, perhaps a small pamphlet could be produced from the Bible -- one that could honestly be called good.   Perhaps. But to the Bible-believer the entire Bible is inspired, and has God as its author. Each passage contains a message from God that must not be altered or deleted. So the believer is simply stuck with the Bible. He or she has no choice but to call it good, true, beautiful, and perfect. When the Bible seems otherwise, as it nearly always does, the problem lies with the believer's interpretation of the Bible -- not with the Bible itself.   The believer's defense of the Bible is assisted by those who publish it. They are invariably believers as well, and are interested in promoting and defending the Bible. They do so in many ways, but their efforts usually include at least some of the following:   -Point out consistencies between the redundant passages, while never mentioning the contradictions.   -Provide explanations and excuses for the absurdities, cruelties, vulgarities, and insults to women, when they choose not to ignore them entirely.   -Emphasize the relative few passages that present a decent image of God.   -Attach footnotes to explain away any difficulties. Millions of such Bibles are published and distributed each year by believers in their tireless and tiresome effort to propagate their beliefs.   Consequently, nearly everyone, whether believer or skeptic, has at least one copy in his or her possession. Among these Bibles will be found many different versions, but all have one thing in common: all are believer- friendly editions that support, promote, and defend the Bible.   The Skeptic's Annotated Bible attempts to remedy this imbalance. It includes the entire text of the King James Version of the Bible, but without the pro-Bible propaganda. Instead, passages are highlighted that are an embarrassment to the Bible-believer, and the parts of the Bible that are never read in any Church, Bible study group, or Sunday School class are emphasized. For it is these passages that test the claims of the Bible-believer. The contradictions and false prophesies show that the Bible is not inerrant; the cruelties, injustices, and insults to women, that it is neither good nor just.   The SAB will help those who believe in the Bible to honestly reconsider that belief. It will help those who are unfamiliar with the Bible to resist the temptation to believe. And it will help those who have already rejected the Bible defend their position.   It is time for us all to stop believing in, or pretending to believe in, a book that is so unworthy of belief.

      Evil.   The word itself has the power to bring certain images to your mind. It has many associations. What comes to mind when I say it? Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Mohammed Ata, Jeffery Dahmer, genocide, killing, torture, infanticide, destruction, abuse of the elderly, slavery, etc. etc. etc. But may I contend that you should add God to that list? Yes, when you think of evil, you should think God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.    Let us first examine what the word “evil” really means. I take the following from the definition given by entering “evil” into the search at  urlLink dictionary.com .    “evil  adj. e·vil·er, e·vil·est   -Morally bad or wrong; wicked: an evil tyrant.  -Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmful: the evil effects of a poor diet.  -Characterized by or indicating future misfortune; ominous: evil omens.  -Bad or blameworthy by report; infamous: an evil reputation.  -Characterized by anger or spite; malicious: an evil temper.   n.   -The quality of being morally bad or wrong; wickedness.  -That which causes harm, misfortune, or destruction: a leader's power to do both good and evil.  -An evil force, power, or personification.  -Something that is a cause or source of suffering, injury, or destruction: the social evils of poverty and injustice.”    So, evil is “Something that is a cause or source of suffering, injury, or destruction…” Something is evil if it is “Causing ruin, injury, or pain…” I contend that by definition, the God of the bible is evil. I will go about asserting this contention in the following article.    Can We be Moral Without God?    This is one argument I always seem to end up facing. Christians say we cannot be moral without god. This is ridiculous. Some of the most immoral people in history have been Christian. Sure, atheists such as Stalin have committed horrendous atrocities, but this just makes the argument moot. Both theists and atheists commit atrocities. Which man has more honor: The one who kills and blames God, or the one who kills and takes the blame himself?   A Christian friend of mine said that we are all immoral without God. He said you can see little children and see the inherent selfishness in them when they yell, “Mine” before snatching something from another child. This is ridiculous. The reason this happens is that children have a limited ability to reason and have no impulse control. It’s not because they don’t know about God yet. They don’t see consequences for actions yet, so taking something is the easiest way to get something. As we grow, we learn that this is not the best way if we are to live in a society of other people.   Also, what about the billions of people in the world who are not Christians? Do they not care for their children? Do they not oppose murder? Yes, they do. They are moral just as Christians are. They live as we all do, under the intrinsic moral principles of humanity. The bible has taught us nothing about morals that is not self-evident to any living human being. We all know killing, stealing, raping, injuring, etc. is wrong. It is only through beliefs in gods and philosophies that we are able to ignore these moralities.    That Which Causes Evil, is Evil    Per definition, something that causes evil has to be evil itself. No good, moral person would purposefully cause evil acts to be committed. The God of the bible causes so many evil atrocities it is amazing to me that anyone could worship him. The most blatant example of this is hell. I’m reminded of the analogy that goes as follows.   Imagine a father were to tell his son that by the time he is twelve, he must decide whether or not to love his dad. The father says the child is free to choose whatever he wants, but if he chooses to not love his father, then the father will put his son in the oven and cook him. What sort of freedom of choice is this? I don’t think it is any choice. Surely a man who did this would be considered one of the most insane, sick, twisted, and evil person you could meet. He would be thrown in prison for child abuse, neglect, and infanticide. Even the criminals in prison would look down on this child murderer, most likely taking out revenge in the child’s name. How ironic is it then that when God does this, we worship him, say “God is Love”, and build churches in his honor.   Yet this is the choice God gives us in the bible. Either love him, and choose him, or we will face the fires of hell. In fact, I think the God of the bible to be a much more sadistic, unjust, malevolent, and cruel than the man who puts his son in an oven. This is because the God of the bible punishes us eternally. The young boy will burn and die. Mankind will suffer the pains of hell for eternity. Some descriptions of how we can begin to fathom eternity are found around the web. Interestingly enough, when I typed “How long is eternity” into google.com, nine out of ten results were Christian sites warning about hell,  urlLink such as this one . The quote at the end is especially poignant, “Let the sum total represent centuries and only then would eternity have begun. Only then would the sinner in hell have a small part of the suffering of that awful place.”  urlLink This site  states, “You’ll exist in a terrible place God calls hell, separated from him and all that is good.” Well isn’t that kind.   What is Evil? How Can a Man Judge God?   Exactly what is “good”? To examine this we must talk about what many Christians I have talked to say when I tell them I don’t think God is good. Many say that we cannot judge God. I beg to differ, and the bible, as usual, is what makes me have this different opinion from a Christian. Irony at it’s best. Let us examine the book of Genesis.    Genesis 3: 4-5  “And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.”    The key words here are, “…knowing good and evil.” According to this, Satan says we will know what good is and know what evil is. So it stands to reason from this that we can judge right from wrong, and can know when God does something good or bad.  “But Satan is the prince of lies and evil”, I can hear you exclaiming.   Ahh…well then let us look at the following passage.    Genesis 3: 22  “And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever”    Well, well, well. It appears here that what the devil said was true. God himself says that mankind can now judge right and wrong, knowing good and evil. It seems to me here that Satan was just trying to wake us up from the ignorance God had us in. Which begs the question: Why does god now punish mankind for committing a sin when we don’t know what good or evil is? Sure, he may have told us not to eat the apple, but how could we have understood the implications of this action, since we had no notion of good or evil? If we don’t know how to be good, then we wouldn’t recognize something as evil. Again, evil is defined as something “that is a cause or source of suffering, injury, or destruction”. Well according to the punishment God deals out in the following passages as the result of tasting the apple, that taste could definitely be defined as evil. I’ve added emphasis in places.    Genesis 3: 16-19  “Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy  sorrow  and thy conception; in  sorrow  thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it:  cursed is the ground  for thy sake; in  sorrow  shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;&nbsp;  Thorns also and thistles  shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”    Well that certainly sounds like suffering to me, and this is just the tip of the iceberg of God’s cruelty to those who sin against him. So because Eve and Adam ate the fruit of the tree, without knowing the difference between right (good) and wrong (evil), Eve’s sorrow will be greatly multiplied, and have sorrowful conception, and serve her husband, and Adam has all of the ground cursed and it will be hard labor for him to grow food.   So to return to our main point of whether or not we can judge God as good or evil, I think it is obvious that we can. All you have to do is read the scripture in which God himself says we know good and evil as he does, “…the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil…” Genesis 3: 22. As a human who knows good and evil, I judge the biblical god to be evil by definition.   Well if God is evil, then what is Satan? Why did God cast Satan out, and what is his punishment? Satan was proud, and rose up against God (Isaiah 15: 13-14, Ezekiel 28: 14-19). Therefore, he is judged, bruised, chained in darkness, and sent to Hell (John 12: 31, John 16: 11, Romans 16:20, Jude 6, 2 Peter 2: 4, Matthew 25: 41). It’s interesting to note that Satan was an angel (Isaiah 14: 12) who was perfect (Ezekiel 29: 15) and beautiful (Ezekiel 28: 17). The angels had free will, as is indicated by the fact that Satan chose to go against God. If he had known the punishment, he would not have had true free will. However, it says nowhere that Satan knew he would be sent to hell for his actions. It is only after he rebels that he is punished. The angels were  urlLink created before man , and  urlLink as free moral agents, some revolted against God . Therefore, God made mankind, and made him ignorant of good and evil. We didn’t gain the ability to judge good or evil until after the fall, and then God punished us for doing what he knew we would do(he’s omniscient, remember?). It’s as if God knew that once we realized the difference between good and evil as the angel’s did, we would see him for what he truly is.   Satan led a rebellion against God in Heaven and was cast out for it. Well, since we’ve established that God is evil by definition, wouldn’t fighting against God be considered an act of goodness? As a human who knows good and evil, I judge Satan, who fought to overthrow the evil biblical god, to be good.   On something of a side-note, some have said to me, the human definition of good isn’t what good really is. They say that the definition of good is what God wills. This is absurd to the nth degree. If what God wills is defined as good, then to say, “God is good”, is to say, “What God wills what he wills.”    The Story of Job    Job is perhaps one of the best examples of the biblical god’s evil. Here, he has a faithful servant, who had not sinned, feared God (who wouldn’t?), and avoided evil. Job had a number of sons and daughters, thousands of sheep, camels, oxen, asses, and also had a large home. He even went so far as to offer sacrifices to God after feasts, just in case one of his sons had ever sinned (Job 1: 1-5). It seems unlikely to me that you would find a man in the Old Testament who loved God more than Job. So what was his reward? Did God multiply Job’s household and give him everything a man of great faith would require? Did God make his seed the rulers of great kingdoms? No. Quite the opposite, in fact.   There came a time when Satan and the  “…sons of God…”  came to before the Lord. God asks Satan where he has been (wait…isn’t God omniscient?), and Satan says he has been walking around the earth. God asks Satan if he has  “…considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man…”  Satan says that he has met Job, and that he only loves God because he has so many great things and has been blessed so much. The Devil tells God that if God were to  “…put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath…”  that Job would curse God to his face  (wait again…I thought no man has seen God face to face? John 1: 18, Exodus 33: 10, 1 John 4: 12).  Basically, if God messes with Job’s stuff, Satan says, Job would hate God. The Lord already knows the answer (remember that whole omniscience thing), but for some reason decides he needs to basically destroy Job’s life through suffering, pain, ruin, and destruction in order to show Satan he is wrong. This would be a good time to go back to the start of the article and re-read what the  urlLink definition of evil  is. God knows Job would repent and come back to God after cursing him, but it’s not enough to know this. Instead, he has to prove Satan wrong, no matter what the cost. Sounds like pride to me when you can’t just be satisfied knowing you’re wrong, but have to be able to say, “Told you so!” Wasn’t pride the reason Satan became a fallen angel and was cast into Hell?   Quick question here in case you have confusion as to who’s at fault here. Who’s responsible for a murder? A robot, or the scientist who created the robot and programmed it to kill? Remember, God made Satan and saw all the things he would do.   In the first chapter of Job, God lets Satan go and mess up Job’s life a little bit, with the stipulation that he does not harm Job physically. First, every one of Job’s servants that watch his oxen, save for one, is slain. Secondly, great fire burns up all his thousands of sheep and the servants that watch them as well, save one. Next, his camels and servants that watch the camels are all slain, save for one. Ouch. Oh wait, to top it off a building collapses, killing all of his sons. This all happens on the first day that Satan is messing with Job, per God’s orders, remember. What does Job do? He shaves his head, and falls down and praises the Lord. (Job 1: 14-22)   So the next time that Satan and the  “…sons of God…”  come to see the Lord, God again asks Satan where he has been (anyone else beginning to be confused about God’s omniscience?), and Satan says he has been traveling the world. God asks Satan about Job again, and Satan says (paraphrasing Job 2: 4-5), “Yeah, yeah. So you took what he had. A man will give everything he has for his life. If you torture him physically though, he’ll curse you.” God, again knowing what will happen, still tells Satan to go out and do what he will with Job, short of killing him. So Satan goes and infects Job with horrendous boils from the top of his head to the sole of his feet. At this point, even Job’s wife realizes how horrible God is being to Job, and says,  “…curse God, and die.” (Job 2: 9).  It’s understandable that she would be a little upset with Job, as his worship of this God has caused the death of her children.   Job suffers for a long time, and his friends come to his house and the rest of the story is about Job suffering, and debating with his friends about God and his purposes. In the end, Job never curses God, and God gives the things back to Job twofold.   So what is the moral of the story? That if you are faithful, God will double what you have. Oh, and if you’re faithful, God will destroy one of your homes, kill your children, kill your animals, kill your servants, and strike you with sores and boils from head to toe, so he can tell Satan, “Told you so!”    Why is There Evil in the World?    Further support for my argument that God is evil is found in the scripture. If evil is something that causes suffering, and something is described as being evil if said thing causes ruin, then it can be said that whatever is the source of evil (suffering, pain, etc.) is evil, as the source is the original cause. What does the bible have to say about evil? Where did it come from? Man? No. Satan? No. Angels? No. God? Yes.   Surprised? Yes, according to the bible, God is the source and creator of evil.    Isaiah 45: 7  “I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.”    When looking through my bible, I laughed when I looked in the topical index, and found that under the word “Evil”, was the subject “Origins of…”, followed by references where it comes from Satan &nbsp;(Isaiah 14: 12-14 which doesn’t even say the word “Evil”), and from Man (Matthew 15: 18-19). Both these passages state that bad things come from Satan and Man, but they don’t say that Satan and Man are the sources of evil, as Isaiah 45: 7 says about God.   So to answer our question, the reason there is evil in the world is because God created it. When he did this, being omniscient, he knew it would enter the world, and he is therefore responsible. Evil is causing suffering and pain, and all pain and suffering in the world is the result of God’s choices. Therefore, by definition, God is evil.    Why do We Suffer?   This one is simple. And it’s not because we sinned, which is the standard knee-jerk reaction you will get when you ask a Christian, “Why do we suffer?” While it’s nice for Christians to believe that we only suffer because of original sin, the truth goes back further than that. The real reason we suffer is so that God can be glorified. We were made to please and glorify God (Isaiah 43:7, Revelation 4: 11). All the suffering, pain, sorrow, and terror we experience in our lives is because of God, for he knew we would go through these things when he made us, as he is omniscient (1 John 3: 20). Seems a little selfish, doesn’t it? God created us, knowing we would suffer, but did it anyways just for his pleasure.   It seems simple to me that God is the cause of suffering. Isn’t that the definition of evil? Yes, it is. This would be another good time to go back to the start of the article and re-read what the  urlLink definition of evil  is. You may feel differently, but I have a hard time seeing how anyone can see the god of the bible as anything but evil.

      It has long been said that the Bible is sexist. Fundamentalist Christians say it is not. They often quote a couple passages that can be interpreted to say that woman is equal to man. To me, these couple passage contradict the blatant message taught by the rest of the Bible: The message that women are inferior to men and that their opinions, teachings, thoughts, and cares are not worthy of respect. Let’s look to the Good Book and see exactly what it says.    Help Meet   The first mention of woman in the Bible is in Genesis.   Genesis 2:20 “And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.”   So we see that God thought Adam didn’t have enough help apparently from the animals, so God puts Adam to sleep and makes a woman out of one of Adam’s ribs. She is made, as we see in the passage above, as a help meet for him. What does this mean? I remember my pastor saying that meet means equal. Well, I can see, as I could then, how the word meet could mean equal. But looking now, I notice that it does not say “…an help meet to him”, but instead says,  “…an help meet for him.”  It seems obvious here that woman was not created as an equal to man, but as someone created good enough to meet Adam’s needs. It is clear my former pastor was taking this word out of context. Of course, at the time, why would I have questioned him? The lesson here in Genesis 2:20 is that women was as someone adequate to help him.  Soon after she is created, Eve runs into the serpent, which is Satan in disguise. He comes along and tells her to eat the fruit, and she does. She then goes to Adam, and he eats the apple as well. When God finds Adam and Eve (so much for omnipresence and omniscience, huh?) he asks them what they did. Adam, instead of taking responsibility for his own actions, immediately blames Eve.   Genesis3:12 “And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that though shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman whom though gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.”   God punishes Adam and Eve with the Original Sin™, and as part of it, woman’s subjugation to man is reinforced (Genesis 3:16). The pair has a couple of sons, and sometime during the next eight hundred years, Adam has some unnamed daughters. This is just about the last time in the Bible that a female’s birth is mentioned.   Women are the Property of Men   The Bible repeatedly talks about women as property and something that is to be traded and exchanged like a donkey or bag of grain. The passages are so numerous that I will just list a few of them here.  First we have Lot offering his two daughters up to a horny Sodomite mod.   Genesis 19:8 “Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes”  Here, we see men taking wives. Notice there is not discussion about whether or not these women want to be married. They are just taken.   Genesis 26:34 “And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite”    Genesis 28:9 “Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife”    Genesis 38:2 “And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.”   One of the most well known references to women is in the Ten Commandments. In it, a woman is comparable to his house, slaves, and even an ass.   Exodus 20:17 “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.”   In the following passage, Samson sees a woman he likes, and sends people to get her for him.   Judges 14:1-3 “And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.”   In the following passages we see women being bought and sold.   Ruth 4:10 “Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife…”  Hosea 3:2 “So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley”   I’ll end this section with the following passage, where David buys a woman for the price of two hundred Philistine foreskins!    1 Samuel 18:27 “Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife”    What about the New Testament?   So other than helping man, what other purposes do women have? It is obvious from the almost countless passages in the Old Testament that women are for bearing children for man, helping man, and deceiving man. Why, even when a man sleeps with an unwed woman, he simply has to pay the father the going price for virgins and all is well!   Exodus 22:16-17 “And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.”   Well so far, we have only dealt with the Old Testament. According to just about every Christian I talk to, and all churches I’ve ever been to, the Old Testament doesn’t apply anymore (except in cases that suit their needs, such as tithing, but that’s a topic best discussed at a later date). So what does the New Testament say about women? Did Christ’s sacrifice at Calgary liberate women from the archaic, barbaric rituals of the Old Testament? Did his blood wash away the suffering of women and the original sin that makes them servant’s to man? It appears here that Christ’s sacrifice did destroy sin.   Hebrews 9:26 “…but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself”  Hebrews 9:28 “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many…”   Let’s look to the New Testament to see what it says regarding the fairer sex and their new role under God’s New Covenant with his people.   Romans 1:27 “And likewise also the men, leaving  the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet”  (My emphasis added)  Notice the bolded text here. Paul is writing the church in Rome, warning them of their sins. In this specific passage, he is addressing the fact that people in Rome have partaken of homosexual acts. By seeking sexual pleasure from men instead of women, they have left  “…the natural use of the woman… ” which is clearly implied to be sexual pleasure here. Okay, so obviously women aren’t freed from their role as sexual objects meant to be used mainly just for child bearing and pleasure. Well, let’s see if they’ve been liberated in any other way.  What about their opinions? What about their cares and wants? Are they free to express themselves anywhere they want, whenever they feel it appropriate? The New Testament answer is no. Paul writes in 1 Peter 3:1-2 that women are still subject to their husbands, and to remain loyal to God, so that their husbands will not fall. Obviously, Paul is also of the belief that Eve was the cause of Adam’s fall. In 1 Peter 3:6-7, Paul identifies women as the  “…weaker vessel…” , or  “…weaker sex...”  in the Revised Standard Edition.   1 Peter 3:1-2 “Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear”    1 Peter 3:6-7 "Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered”   On a slight off-topic subject, I would just like to take an aside and point out the wisdom of Paul. In 2 Peter 2:8 he tells us that Lot was a  “…righteous man…”  Remember, Lot was the one who offered his virgin daughters to a mob of Sodomites. Later, Lot had sex with his daughters and impregnated them.  urlLink See my article on parenting for more about this story.  Back onto the subject, we see that women were obviously not included in the many of Hebrews 9:28 that had their sins taken away by Jesus. Paul continues to instruct the followers of Jesus on how women are to act in other letters.   Colossians 3:18-19 “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them”   So husbands are to love their wives and not be bitter against them. What are women to do? Should they love their husbands? No, they just have to submit to their husbands.   Ephesians 5:22-23 “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.”   Here, women are told again to submit to their husbands. Paul adds here that they should submit to their husbands as if their husband was God.    1 Corinthians 11:3 “But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God”   Here Paul says that Christ is the leader of man, and man is the leader of woman.   1 Corinthians 11:7-9 “For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 8 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.”   Now Paul says that man is the glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. He blatantly states that women are from men, and that they are created for men.   1Corinthians 14:34-35 “Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.”   Women aren’t supposed to talk in church. If they have questions, they are to wait until they get home to ask their husbands about it. It’s a shame for women to speak in church. Remember this, Christians, next time your grandmother asks you for a tissue while you’re in church.   1 Timothy 2:11-15 “Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety”   In this passage, Paul teaches that women must sit in church, and learn. They cannot teach, and may not  “…usurp the authority over a man…” , but must be quiet. Why? Well, because Adam was made by God first. Paul reminds us again that it was not Adam’s fault that there was Original Sin™, but Eve’s. But God has made it okay, because a woman can be saved! How, you ask? Why, by bearing children of course! We come full circle again to the  “…natural use of the woman…” (Romans 1:27).   Well if a woman’s natural use is to give sexual pleasure and children to men, then what happens if her husband dies? Surely a woman whose husband dies is free to continue her life attempting to find happiness after the loss of her mate, right? Well, in case this is what you were thinking, I’ll let Paul tell you otherwise.   1 Timothy 5:5-6 “Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.”   So we see that a widow is someone who is desolate and trusts God, while praying day and night. If she tries to find pleasure, she is  “…dead while she liveth.”   Soon after teaching us this, Paul tells us in 1 Timothy 5:9-15 that the church should only help a widow if she is over  “…threescore years old…”,  was  “…the wife of one man…”,  has  “…brought up children…”,  is  “...Well reported of for good works…”,  has  “…lodged strangers…”,  has  “…washed the saints feet…”,  has  “…relieved the afflicted…”,  and has  “…diligently followed every good work.”  If a widow is younger than  “…threescore years…”  she must not be allowed into the church, for she will remarry and be damned.  Going back over these passages more than reaffirms my stance that the Bible is a hateful, cruel book. The only good thing it says towards women is that husbands should love their wives. But also remember, that this “God of Love” is the one who commands us to stone our children in public if they are disobedient.   Deuteronomy 21:18-21 "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they chastise him, will not give heed to them, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city...and they shall say to the elders of his city, 'This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard. Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones; so you shall purge the evil from the midst"
