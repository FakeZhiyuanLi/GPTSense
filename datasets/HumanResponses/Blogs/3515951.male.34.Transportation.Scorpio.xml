       urlLink  A report published by Sophos, a world leader in protecting businesses against viruses and spam, reveals that the number of new viruses being written is increasing. In total, Sophos has detected and protected against 4,677 new viruses in the first six months of 2004, up 21% on the same period last year.  The Sasser worm accounted for more than a quarter of all viruses reported to Sophos so far this year, even though the worm only first appeared in May.  Sasser claimed the top spot of the virus chart, in spite of the raging battle between the widespread Netsky and Bagle worms, which has wreaked havoc across the internet from mid-February. This war produced six of the most damaging viruses of the year so far, with Netsky-P proving to be the most prevalent. The good news for computer users was the May arrest of Sven Jaschan, the German teenager who confessed to authoring both the Sasser and Netsky worms.  For the first six months of 2004, the top ten viruses (as recorded by Sophos's global network of virus monitoring stations) are as follows, with the most frequently occurring virus at number one:  Position 	Virus 	Percentage of reports 1	W32/Sasser	  	 26.1% 2	W32/Netsky-P	  	 21.4% 3	W32/Netsky-B	  	 11.0% 4	W32/Netsky-D	  	 6.8% 5	W32/MyDoom-A	  	 4.4% 6	W32/Zafi-B	  	 4.0% 7	W32/Netsky-Z	  	 3.1% 8	WW32/Netsky-C	  	 2.4% 9	W32/Sober-C	  	 1.5% 10	W32/Bagle-A	  	 1.2% Others	18.1%  'Following in the footsteps of last year's hard-hitting Blaster worm, Sasser exploited a critical vulnerability in Microsoft's operating system in order to spread - this type of worm is proving to be extremely 'successful' as Microsoft is finding it tough to ensure computer users apply patches as soon as the flaws are discovered,' said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos. 'Sasser may have taken top spot, but six of the biggest viruses of the last six months were all Netsky and Bagle variants - these caused a continued nuisance for PC users the world over as their authors entered into a very public game of virus writing one-upmanship.'  'Reassuringly, virus writers haven't had it all their own way so far in 2004. Increased scrutiny from law enforcement agencies and Microsoft's bounty initiative to encourage people to snitch on virus writers, led to a very high profile arrest in Germany. Sven Jaschan, teenage author of the Sasser worm and member of Skynet, the gang responsible for distributing Netsky, confessed in May. The German virus-writing community has been relatively quiet ever since,' continued Cluley.  MyDoom, the fifth most damaging virus so far this year, highlights the increasing trend for virus writers to attempt to create zombie armies of possessed PCs. This worm, which first appeared in January, opened a backdoor into infected PCs, allowing hackers to launch distributed denial of service attacks on the websites belonging to Microsoft and SCO.  The sixth most prevalent virus so far this year, the Zafi-B worm, is a prime example of how virus writers can use their malicious code to distribute political messages. This worm called for the Hungarian government to house the homeless and introduce the death penalty against criminals. It continues to be extremely successful in infecting computer users, spreading itself by email and peer-to-peer filesharing systems. First mobile phone virus discovered  The Cabir worm, first seen in June, was a proof of concept mobile phone virus. The worm that was written by the virus writing gang 29A, proved that it was possible for a virus to spread via Bluetooth to other compatible mobile phones in the vicinity. The worm posed no threat to mobile phone users as the virus was not released in the wild. More arrests  The first female to be charged with distributing a virus was arrested in February. Kim Vanvaeck, aka 'Gigabyte', suspected author of several viruses including Coconut-A, Sahay-A and Sharp-A, was arrested by Belgian authorities and charged with computer sabotage. If convicted she faces up to three years in prison and fines of up to 100,000 Euros.  In May, Wang Ping-an, a 30-year-old computer engineer was arrested in Taiwan for allegedly writing and distributing a Trojan horse that enabled hackers to steal sensitive information from the island's government computers.  'These arrests have sent a strong message to the virus community that the authorities will not turn a blind eye to criminal computer activity. However, the real deterrent will be tough sentencing. It will be interesting to see what punishments are dished out by the authorities against convicted virus writers and distributors,' added Cluley.

       They flew our Safety Manager to Chicago for Corporate Training, not realizing they were going to be laying him off in a matter of weeks.   Poor Rick got the news up there and flew back early.  There is no telling how much that little junket cost the dumbasses.    Rick did have one funny story from the flight back.  He was in one of the airports (Atlanta?) and went to a restaurant that was in it.  He ended up being seated directly across from a lady nursing her little boy.    When the waitess asked him what he'd like, Rick looked directly at the Mom and said "I'll have what he is having."    He said both women giggled.

      The woman sneezed, took out a tissue, gently wiped her nose and then shuddered quite violently for 10 or 15 seconds. The man went back to his reading. A few minutes later, the woman sneezed again, took a tissue, gently wiped her nose and shuddered quite violently as before. The man was becoming more and more curious about the shuddering. A few more minutes passed and the woman sneezed one more time. Again she took a tissue, gently wiped her nose and shuddered violently. The man couldn't restrain his curiosity. He turned to the woman and said, "You've sneezed three times, wiped your nose with a tissue, then shuddered violently! Are you all right?" "I'm sorry if I disturbed you," the woman replied, "I have a rare condition; when I sneeze, I have an orgasm." The man was a little embarrassed but even more curious and said, "I've never heard of that before. What are you taking for it?" The woman looked at him and said, "Pepper."

       It's my first Nigerian Chain Letter! Attn:  I am Barrister GIWA ADAMS (esq) a Solicitor and Personal lawyer to Engr. Williams Jackson an expertriate who has a servicing firm affiliated with the National Electric Power Authority. He was awarded a contract worth Twenty Three Million United States Dollars (US$23,000,000.00).Immediately this contract was signed,an initial amount of Nine Million,Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$9.600,000.00) was paid to him as mobilization fee to kick off the contract.  He duly completed this contract pending when his remaining balance of (US$13,400,000.00) will be paid to him. On the 21st April 2002, my client,his wife and their three children were involved In a ghastly motor accident along Badagry Express Road.Unfortunately, All the occupants in the vehicle lost their lives. My client was a successful and an accomplished family man, who made enough fortune before his untimely death. Since then I had made several inquiries through your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relative but this exercise has proved unsuccessful. After several unsuccessful attempts.  Not too long after his untimely death,his outstanding balance of US$13,400,000.00 was approved and transfered into one of my country's affiliated payment centre in Europe. Right now the funds are still floating unclaimed in the suspense account of the offshore correspondence payment centre in Europe.  I decided to trace his relatives by whatever means availiable to me and through the Internet, to locate any member of his family not much progress was recorded. By virtue of my closeness to the deceased and his immediate family,I am very much aware of my client related documents on which the contract was awarded and executed. I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client, so that you can be paid the remaining balance of his contract funds left in the bank in Europe,hence I contacted you.  I am offering you this opportunity by contacting you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge Deposits were lodged.The National Electric Power Authority issued me a notice as the Attorney to the Deceased to provide the Next of Kin or have the Account confiscated within a very limited time frame since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now that I have been searching, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin or family member to the Deceased, so that the proceeds of this remaining balance of his contract funds valued at $13.4 Million Dollars can be paid to you.  We shall both share the funds,we will agreed on the sharing ratio as we proceed, A certain amount will be set aside for any incured expenses and for donation to charitable organizations. I have all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this project through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Please get in touch with me by email as soon as possible.  Respectfully Yours, Barrister GIWA ADAMS (ESQ)   Does anyone actually ever fall for this shit?

       They want me to come in at 5:30 in the morning for a meeting where they are going to announce that we will all be "laid off" in two weeks!   Now how much sense does that make?  My scheduled hours are from 8:30am on.   They could schedule a meeting for 5:30 in the morning where we'd all be "laid" and I probably wouldn't make it.   I'm just not gonna do it.  They can dry hump me just as easily at 8:30am as 5:30am.  What are they going to do?  Fire me?    Lauren said it best:    "A pox on HR and Management!  May they all contract a raging case of Syphillis!"

       My answering machine is beeping furiously when I get home with two messages.  The first message is from a Recruiter that had submitted me to one of his clients.  He called to thank me for my interest but let me know the position had been filled by someone else.  I applaud them for their honesty but I was hoping for better news.  The second message was from an out of area code number so it was probably a Recruiter too.  The woman said the message was for me, proceeded to say something unintelligible, and then hung up!  How in the heck am I supposed to call her back with no number or contact  information???  All of this is happening on a day when I find incriminating documents in a printer about how they are eliminating the division I work for.  I should stop feeling sorry for myself though.     If you get a chance, read  urlLink Jay's blog  and say a prayer for him and his family.  He seems to be a really nice guy who IS having a rough day/time of it.     Story's like his put everything in perspective.

       Remember how I was trying to help my company resolve over $100,000 in claims?   Well, I wasn't having any luck with the data files that they sent me so I had them ship the entire computer.  As luck would have it, FEDEX lost the computer that contained the records!  The last scan was somewhere in their Memphis, TN facility.  The really ironic part is that we "used to be" a shipping company ourselves until the corporate asshats fucked things up.  If you care to play along go to the  urlLink FEDEX website  and put in the following tracking number:  792028757571  This will sort of be a high-tech version of "Where Is Waldo?"

       ...until it is fucking out!   Yesterday we had really bad storms and the power went out from 5:30 in the afternoon until 11:30 at night.  There was no computer or Internet to play on, no lights to read by, no television to watch, nor any air conditioning to cool the place.  Jessica was teasing me about how sex would be a good distraction but alas it was just the roommate and I.   He is a good guy and all but we don’t swing that way.  She was good enough to call me and keep me company though so it wasn’t all that bad!  In case you don’t remember,  urlLink Jessica is the girl that sent me a picture of her pussy.   We decided on a couple of new reality shows for television.  The first one we would create would feature unwed single mothers, their families, and the men who knocked them up, as they navigated life’s little adventures with jealous lovers, paternity tests, Restraining Orders, and the like.  Does anyone know an exec at FOX who’d want to sponsor “BABY MAMA DRAMA?”  Her other idea for a reality show would feature every day folks going through life with “thought balloons” above them.  Imagine what it would be like to watch someone at the repair shop or work as they deal with various BS.     [[I bet the little prick hasn’t even started on the Greenberg presentation yet.    If he weren’t the boss’s nephew I’d kick his little ass…]]     {{Why is he looking at me like that?  I sure wish he’d get laid. I bet he wants the Greenberg case…I knew I should have started it! }}  “Kevin, do you have the Greenberg presentation ready?”  "...Well, um...uh...not exactly...."    It would be even cooler if we had the technology to do it real-time.  Then we’d have conversations like:    [[ I bet the little prick hasn’t even started on the Greenberg presentation yet.    If he weren’t the boss’s nephew I’d kick his little ass…]]     {{Why is he looking at me like that?  I sure wish he’d get laid. I bet he wants the Greenberg case…I knew I should have started it! }}  “Kevin, do you have the Greenberg presentation ready?”  “No, I dont, you big jerk-off, and I’d like to see you try and kick my ass!”  “You better watch who you’re calling a jerk-off and it just so happens I got laid last night!”  [[No I didn’t]]  {{No he didn’t}}   Then again it might just be too much like that old sitcom called Herman’s Head.  Jessica did turn me on to a new cologne called Romance by Ralph Lauren.  According to the website:    “Romance Is Classified As A Refreshing, Spicy, Lavender, Amber Fragrance. This Masculine Scent Possesses A Blend Of Warm And Sexy Citrus And Lavender, With Sweet Spices And Woods. It Is Recommended For Romantic Wear.”   Jessica just said that every time she smelled it “she creamed her panties.”      SOLD!

        Skip This If You Have Or Have Had A Vagina Lately!   I had trouble connecting to Yahoo on Wednesday via GAIM and also using the Yahoo client.  GAIM is another Instant Messaging program which allows me to have all of my buddy lists open from Yahoo, Aim, at once.  Well, Yahoo went and "upgraded" their already bloated client so that they can force more advertising down their user base's throats.  Apparently they get mucho dinero from their offering the latest movie trailer IMvironments and what not.  I was surprised their existing Yahoo client didn't continue to work or even force an upgrade.   GAIM didn't have anything out til today so I downloaded the latest Yahoo and used it until GAIM retaliated with their new client.  It will be interesting to see how long this one lasts.  In other news, my roommate managed to get his credit card information stolen from  urlLink the Trojan virus that was being delivered by popular websites .  He suspects he got it from www.godaddy.com but isn't sure.  What it apparently does is attacks servers running the Microsoft Internet Information Server and then loads some infected code onto them innocuously.  When someone visits the infected site with Internet Explorer it downloads a keystroke logger and sends the info to a server in Russia.  Supposedly the site has been shut down already but the damage is done.  Now there will be more attempts like this one because the code is out there.  I had recommended him switching to Firefox but he couldn't be bothered to do so.  Amazingly he is still running Internet Explorer.

      This city manager hears rumors that $4,000 a month is being stolen from admission fees to the town's swimming pool, and he wants immediate action, reports an IT pilot fish on the scene.  Fish doesn't buy the rumors. "This operation charges $1 to $6 per entry and is rarely busy enough to generate $4,000 in a month, let alone lose that much," he says.  But the city manager orders that a computerized cash-handling system be installed at once. Never mind that the city treasurer has recommended a standard cash register and strict cash-handling rules and training. And that the parks department is about to phase out this kind of computerized cash drawer. And that the pool building's roof leaks, which destroyed the last PC installed there.  So it's no surprise that the city manager, treasurer and parks chief all play "duck the meeting" while the clock ticks down. When they finally all agree to go ahead, it's the day before the pool is scheduled to open.  Meanwhile, the IT department has built the computer. "But no cash drawer has been allocated and locked down, no receipt printer can be found, and no list of cashiers has been submitted to IT, so no one has been set up with an account or trained to use the system," says fish.  "A drawer is found and a printer stolen from another location that has two. We set up the system at the location and generate a one-cent receipt as proof of success of the technical end of the project. The cash drawer grinds and doesn't open. It is locked and no one has the key.  "The pool opens bright and early at 6 a.m. Pool staff continue taking cash using the manual cash register, since no one knows anything about the new system.  "Later in the day, a list of cashiers arrives and the accounts are made up. No one at the pool will answer the phone. The division manager is on vacation and all his secretary can lamely say is that they should answer over there. We e-mail the account names and passwords to the division manager and move on.  "Here's the scorecard. Problem: suspicion that cash is pocketed instead of going into manual cash register. Solution: A computerized cash register. People: The same. Process: The same. Training: None. Policy changes: None. Use of the new system: None at start of season. Physical security of the drawer: Not bolted down, but locked so no cash can be placed in it.  "But I keep my one-cent receipt for my own amusement.  "Now I wait for the rains to come. ..."

        For the 3rd morning in a row I have been greeted by a car covered in bird-shit.    I am not talking about one spot or even one part of the car.  The ENTIRE FUCKING CAR has small little bird pellets stuck all over it.   I have lived here 4+ years, parked in the same place, and NEVER had this happen before.  We have had some pretty bad storms each night so perhaps this is a factor.  I can just see two birds in the tree now talking.   “Hey Frank, Winds picking up pretty bad!” “Yeah, is that a Tornado?” Both in Unison, “S_H_I_T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”   My coping mechanism has been to make a quick pit stop at the local car wash and pay 75 cents to spray it off.  If I were a smart man I’d hook the hose up the night before because apparently this is becoming a trend.  I wonder if any federal victim’s assistance funds are available.

      I'd like to apologize to everyone for taking so long to post.  Normally I try and put out 4 posts a day but with the drama going on at work I have just not felt up to writing.  I also don't feel entirely comfortable posting from work.  You'd think that I'd have nothing to worry about but I don't want to jeapordize any severance pay I may be getting.   When everything is over I will reveal who Inatech really is and explain the whole saga.  It is a "doozy!" and a must read for how not to take over a company.  On a personal note, I almost bought the farm going to work out the other day.  I got behind someone who made the turn in to my gym and  freaking  STOPPED  to talk to someone in another car.  I am stuck behind them and can't turn or go forward, so right as I am reaching for the horn, I hear brakes being applied.  I'm bracing for impact and happen to see a large truck go sliding by me.  The dumbass in front got the clue and parked.  I never did see who was driving it because they ran inside before I got out.     Stupid people are everywhere!

      Dad seemed to enjoy his card from this year as well as the one from last year.  He racked up with a chair from Kelley and Jason, a Day Lilly from Kristy, and a Lowe's gift card from me.     I got over there around 12:30 and they were just finishing grilling some steaks.  We had a nice dinner and then everyone went swimming.  It was a little overcast at first but the sun did peek out.     Around 4 I left, picked up my friend, Rob, and headed to the gym. We worked out til they closed and then I took a look at his computer.  He was having connection problems and couldn't get on the Internet.  He used to have a lot of problems with virii and adware until he got a router.  Well, wouldn't you know, the router got popped in a storm we had Saturday night.  His DSL connection worked fine hooked directly to his computer but the router wouldn't see it or assign any IP addresses.  I got him working and made him promise to get a new router soon.  He “should” be able to exchange it as it is less than  2 months old.   After that I headed home, cleaned up, and had Chinese with another friend.  We were going to watch a movie but he needed to work on a report for work.  It was late anyway so I went home and went to bed.  Not the most exciting of times but a good day none-the-less...

       It's Happy Hour Somewhere   Why does the new PC maintenance guy keep leaving early? "Our office hours are from 8 to 5, but he frequently left an hour, even two hours early," says puzzled co-worker pilot fish. "Turns out he was watching the clock on the computers he was fixing. Many of them came from different time zones, some of them earlier than ours. He watches his own clock now."   Yeah, Pretty Sure   This user has gone through four laptop hard drives in two months, and he blames his new wireless networking card. How do you store the laptop while driving to job sites? asks help desk pilot fish. User: "I sit it in the seat beside me so I can hear when I get an e-mail." Fish: You're bouncing a spinning hard disk down bumpy roads -- that's the reason it's getting trashed. User: "But this is a laptop and mobile. Are you sure that's the problem?"

      ..I got a call from a colleague with my company.  Apparently HR had shown her the list of names that they had submitted to Corporate for layoffs.  She and yours truly were both on there as were everyone else from FL and SC.     Strangley, earlier that morning we had gotten news that a major customer had re-upped their contract with us.  Upper management continues to claim that everything is "business as usual" but I contine to hear one common theme from multiple sources.  That is "Business is being outsourced on July 15th and we will be dissolved."   These rumblings are coming from too many disparate sources to be false.  This is why I haven't taken any vacation yet, have begun hoarding money and paying off bills, and submitting resumes.  D-day is less than a month away and presumably we would have some warning before business just disappeared.   This means there might be an announcement this coming week or next.

      ...if people would just leave stuff alone.  A couple of weeks ago they took it upon themselves to move the computer to the other side of the room.   Not a big deal except that they dropped it!   Well of course, when they called me to tell me about this, they didn't mention THAT!  They just said that the computer wouldn't boot into Windows.  Finally after trying several fixes, the truth came out.  Dropping it caused damage to the hard drive  (Who would have thought?)  so I just decided to replace it.  Even while confessing this to me, the girl claimed that she "sort of dropped the monitor..."     I had them ship the computer to me and I was able to rescue all of the data off of it.  I setup a new computer, migrated the data over, and sent it back down to them.     Well, everything worked for a day or two but then they began having problems scanning.  Our branches use PalmPilot type scan guns to  scan packages and then upload the files to the computers.  Well, the files weren't transferring!     To make a long story short, they managed to corrupt the scanners by not having them plugged up.  Now I get to travel back to Charleston on Monday to replace them and make sure they work.  Grrrrrrrr....I need to figure a way out to turn this into a vacation!

      It's the late 1990s, and this multibillion-dollar financial company hires a consulting outfit to create a Y2k disaster recovery and business continuity plan, reports a pilot fish on the scene.  "Since the company was regulated by the FDIC, these plans were being audited closely," says fish. "Our team of 10 consultants began by inventorying the 200 most important business processes and identifying the 10 most critical data centers and processing locations.  "All was going well until one of the IT directors complained to the CIO that we were asking too many questions."  Turns out the business-side managers have been told everything's all ready for Y2k. And by asking them searching questions, the consultants are raising doubts about the company's Y2k status.  Actually, the Y2k fixes haven't even started. "Their main financing application had 10 million lines of code, with multiple copies on multiple servers, and multiple copies on the same server," fish says. "No one really knew which objects were actually running in production. Many of the objects either didn't have source code or the source code was dated and didn't match what was in production.  "Our team was told we were no longer allowed to schedule interviews with anyone in the company. We were instructed to hurry up, assess the risks and finish a detailed plan on how the keep the business running if Y2k caused any application, location or anything else to fail."  So the 10 consultants spend the next six weeks -- at $1,500 a day each -- with their feet up, deciding the fate of the company. What should the company do if the 3,000 people in the processing center out East loses power? How should they respond to a major outage in a data center with 150 servers supporting 5,000 users? If things get really bad, which divisions and loan portfolios should be sold to other banks if the company can't service them?  "We were gods with unlimited power," says fish.  And while the consulting team is making up business continuity plans out of whole cloth, the Y2k program manager and the CIO continue to report that the whole Y2k project is right on track.  "Finally, some of the vice presidents and managers started asking how the business continuity plans were being written when no one had even asked them how they ran their divisions," says fish.  "Pressure mounted. Finally the CIO relented and gave us permission to start talking to people again.  "While we no longer ruled the world and made decisions over life or death of the company, we worked hard and completed the plans and the project successfully.  "Y2k passed, nothing happened, and I was able to turn in my pager a couple weeks early."

      As I find myself reading other people's blogs I find myself remembering some of my past experiences.  I actually caught myself on the phone tonight before I mentioned an experience I had read about in someone else's posting.  Later tonight, as I was reading  Jay's   urlLink Right-Brained  blog, I was reminded of something that happened on my first job.   I was twenty one and working at my first real job after college as an Assistant Manager for Wal~Mart.  Being a young guy, and never having managed people before, I was clueless.  To make matters worse, they gave me an area of the store that I had no interest in and knew very little about: Soft lines!  Soft lines consisted of Men's and Women's Apparel with the Front End Registers thrown in for good measure.     The only redeeming factor, or at least I thought so at the time, was I managed a lot of young ladies.  The “rub” is that Wal~Mart had a strict fraternization policy prohibiting  dating coworkers, especially ones whom you managed.  Well, being an idealistic and conscientious young man, I tried to follow it.     Well one day I got called back into the crusty, old, Store Manager's office.  He sat me down and proceeded to question me regarding Sexual Harassment.  I was flabbergasted!  I started questioning myself internally, going over all of the conversations I had had with employees over the past couple of weeks.  Nothing came to mind as even vaguely sexual.  I told him this and he absolutely floored me when he told me who it was.     She was the grossest, fattest, ugliest, girl that I managed.  Even today she ranks in my Top 5 of Heinous.  She was about 5 feet tall and a svelte 350 pounds.  Her face sported a mustache and the beginnings of a goatee.  Did I mentioned she smelled?   Apparently she had over-heard me drop an F-bomb and took it upon herself to be offended.  Well, I explained to the Store Manager that there was no way in hell I could possibly have sexually harassed her and he agreed.  I got off with a written warning and having to apologize to her.  From there on out I avoided her like the plague.   The really bizarre twist is that when I got transferred to another store she slipped me a love letter with her phone number on it.  I honestly don't remember how I handled it but I'd like to think that I ripped the note up in front of her.  Thank you to Jay for dredging up that lovely memory.  I hope I don't have nightmares now.

       Did the Carolina Panthers Over pay for Jake Delhomme?   CNNSI is reporting that he signed a 5 year 38 million dollar extension with 12 million in up front money.    I liked Jake's game last year but we have all seen where QB's blow up and post monster stats one season and then tank.  Think Tommy Maddox or Brian Griese.  Maddox is trying to hold on to his job and Griese is a backup now somewhere.  I just hope Delhomme picks up where he left off last year.  Anything less and Carolina could be in a world of salary cap hurt.

      ...I love it when my company does something short-sighted and it comes back to bite them on the ass.  Today I was given the task of auditing claims that resulted in being backlogged when they shut down the B2B operations and the Claims department.  Now normally I wouldn’t handle something like this but my work is all caught up and I am really only busy when a computer system breaks.  For this reason alone I hate Thunderstorms, but I digress.  When they killed the B2B operations they shut down a bunch of offices, gutted the IIT staff, and let a lot of good people go.  As a result, claims came in (they always do) but no one handled them.  For the one customer that I am handling alone, there is over $120,000 in claims.    Further complicating the matter is the fact that some of the records have “vanished.”  Our lead programmer in FL was working on a way to automate scans and post them to a central company server when he was pulled off of the project.  Shortly afterwards they canned him and sacked the B2B business.   I talked with him and all of the records were stored locally on the office computers and then exported to the customer.    Well, in all of the confusion surrounding the closings, the computers have vanished. Any “evidence” that we delivered the products is effectively gone.  I suppose I can contact the customer and ask for their records but how professional is that?  Besides, why should they help me potentially deny their claims.  If they had kept the claims department open longer this whole mess might not have happened.  If they had let my colleague complete his changes this whole mess would be easier to research.  Even a simple backup would have saved some trouble.  What do you think?  Does God have a sense of humor?  Poetic Justice?  Or am I just warped?  Probably the latter…

        Jessica's Pussy!      This originally started as a gag that Jessica played on me.  She emailed me a bunch of pictures and one of them was titled something like "Pussy Shot.jpg."    Well, me being a typical guy, you know which one got opened first.  I thought it was funny but then I thought that I could get her back by posting it on the web.  It didn't phase her in the least bit but did generate a small buzz.  I hope noone was offended.  Both Grace and Vadergrrrl figured the gag out or at least suspected it and I am sure others did too.  You have to admit...It is one cute pussy!

      A blonde, wanting to earn some extra money, decided to hire herself out as   a "handy-woman" and started canvassing a nearby well-to-do neighborhood.   She went to the front door of the first house, and asked the owner if he   had any odd jobs for her to do.      "Well, I guess I could use somebody to paint my porch," he said, "How much   will you charge me?"     The blonde quickly responded, "How about $50?"     The man agreed and told her that the paint and everything she would need   were in the garage.     The man's wife, hearing the conversation, said to her husband, "Does she   realize that our porch goes all the way around the house?"     He responded, "That's a bit cynical, isn't it?"    The wife replied, "You're right. I guess I'm starting to believe all those   dumb blonde jokes we've been getting by e-mail lately."     A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money.     "You're finished already?" the husband asked.    "Yes," the blonde replied, "and I had paint left over, so I gave it two   coats."    Impressed, the man reached into his pocket for the $50.00 and handed it to   her.     "And by the way," the blonde added, "it's not a Porch, it's a Lexus."

      I am STILL going back on forth about whether or not to post it but have given myself a deadline.  I will make a decision by 2pm ET tomorrow (Wednesday), one way or another.  I am probably over thinking this but I tend to do that.  The comments are split for and against posting it.  In other news,  urlLink Jay  has been sentenced to a "Re-Education Camp" where he will be forced to watch "The Man Show" continuously for his blasphemous comments.    While I am thinking about it, I wanted to remind everyone to checkout both  urlLink Vadergrrrl's  and  urlLink Zelda's  blogs.  After the  urlLink Kadybug  mishap I won't attempt to categorize them as anything less than entertaining.  As soon as I get some motivation they will all three be linked as Favorites.

      ....talked to a some recruiters today.  They were with two separate companies but trying to fill the the same positions out at Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  If there is one thing that I do not want to happen, it is to get submitted by both, as that will invalidate me from being selected.  When the second guy started explaining the job, I asked him the name of the company and I stopped him from going too much further. Ultimately I think he appreciated it because I didn't waste his time going through a long spiel.  He said that they would keep me in consideration for other opportunities that they may come across.  ...still haven't decided whether or not to post a the pic of Jessica's pussy.  Read my previous posts from yesterday and you will see my reasoning for and for not.  Currently the voting in the Comments sesction is running , three for, two against.  I definitlely don't want to post it and wind up angry and bitter like Mr.  Anthony Grieco.  Check out his comments to Kevin at TJ's Place on Monday.  He seems to be a very angry and bitter individual.  I will probably decide something by tomorrow...  ...have experimented with a new counter from http://www.freestats.com and quite frankly have been less than impressed.  The free version gives them advertising on my blog but provides little extra functionality in the way of traffic analysis.  I will probably remove it shortly and test out one from BraveNet next.  What do you use for your blog's traffic management?  ...have been bored, for the most part, at work.  I did one spreadsheet detailing our NEXTEL usage and summarized how we could disconnect 50+ phones and save some real money.  Whether or not it gets implemented is anyone's guess.    ...keep hearing rumors about my employment.  Rumors continue to fly around regarding whether we will be downsized or not.  There is a conference call tomorrow that people are speculating about but it has too many non-players to be "THE" call.  There is no sense ruining the morale of other divisions that aren't affected by us to announce it then.  Im guessing we will know more by early next week.    ...am supposed to go workout this evening around 5pm.  Tonight we concentrate on Chest and Ab's.  This is the workout that got me so sore last week.  It will be intersting to see whether I can raise my hands over my head tomorrow.  If not, I will either have to think "Positive Thoughts" or put off the Bank heist til sometime next week.

      It's the early 1980s, and a senior programmer pilot fish at this grocery wholesaler gets an assignment for a mainframe job that's going to run every week.  "I complete the programming, document the job and create the run sheets and error support documents for the operations staff, then turn it over to my boss for review," fish says.  "Then I get a major talking-to by the boss. The problem is that I coded the program to handle almost every error I could think of that would stop the run, with error support documents for operations on what to do to complete the run.  "The boss says one error could never happen."  Fish points out that everything is ready to go, that there's no harm in being able to handle that one error that will never happen, that making a change now will require reworking all the support documentation for operations on how to run the application and removing the sections on what to do if they got this error.  To no avail. "I know the system and you don't," boss says. "Remove the code."  Fish makes the changes to the support docs, removing all references to the error that will never happen. But in the program itself, instead of removing the error-handling code, he just makes a small change.  Rather than displaying an error code to tell operators which support doc to go to, the program now reports, "&#91;Name of boss&#93; said this error would never happen."  The program goes into production, and fish forgets all about it.  More than 10 years later, fish's old boss has moved on -- and fish is promoted to that job. And on his first day in his old boss's office, fish is looking at the day's system error logs when he spots a familiar line: "&#91;Name of boss&#93; said this error would never happen."  Fish heads over to the operations room and asks about the error -- and one old-timer actually remembers when it started.  "The first night the job ran, that error popped up at 3 a.m.," the old-timer tells fish. "We had no error support docs for that error, so we contacted the name on the screen."  And when the boss came in, old-timer says, he added a handwritten note to the error docs, explaining how to complete the run when operators saw "&#91;Name of boss&#93; said this error would never happen."  "The boss never did report this error," fish says, "even with the weekly operations error reports with his error on it for the next 10 years -- right up until the time I got his job."   Never ever say Never!

       These were my previous posts.  So far I have one vote for posting it, excluding the owner of the pic.  I need some more pro's and con's though.   HELP!!!!!!!!   I feel like a Rock Star. I have my first groupie!!! Jessica sent me a picture of her pussy last night! This was totally unexpected and I have been debating on whether I should post it or not. On the one hand, posting it may be against her wishes and violate her privacy. On the other hand if I do post this I might get more! What should I do???? Help!!!!!  ***** UPDATE 4:30 PM ***** Ok, so she is cool with me posting the picture but I dont know...What if posting this somehow screws up her life? Can I live with that on my hands? Does this send me down a whole new avenue of PORN? Will I lose my "innocence" or soul over this? Does Google even allow this?  The upside would likely be more readers and *possibly* more pics from her and girls like her. What should I do???????

      When I came home on Friday there was a job lead on my answering machine.  I followed up this morning and it actually sounds intriguing.  I submitted my resume so we will see what happens.  The 'Cocks won their second game against ECU to advance to the College World Series.  Four of the eight temas are from the SEC which just goes to show how strong the SEC is in baseball.  LSU, ARK, and UGA also clinched berths.  I went and worked out yesterday and am not as sore as I have been.  I must be doing something wrong.  Steve came over last night and we went and had barbecue from Piggy Park.  One odd thing about Columbia is that the barbecue here is Mustard based.  In Augusta, it is Ketchup based and in parts of SC and NC it is vinegar and pepper based.  Go figure.  Mayonnaise based barbecue anyone?  I feel like a Rock Star.  I have my first groupie!!!

      To set this story up I must remind you that we were acquired by the evil Inatech company early last year.  They gave us all new servers and communications equipment but set them up underneath a panel in a our "server room" (converted Janitor closet) that apparently rain had leaked in on.  Not an ideal spot if you ask me.  Anyway this was fixed and life went on until...   First Email:  When Ron and I were in CLT last week, Ron took some pictures of some damaged ceiling tiles in the server room.  Ron,  Can you email these pictures to all on this email.  Dan/Greg,  What do you know re: this?   Dan,  Please look in the room prior to responding and ask Carla et al regarding same.   Please advise ASAP.  We specific need to be aware of any damage or likely damage to computer equipment.  Thank you, Jerry  Manager Type Inatech   Second Email:  Andy and Greg have been aware of this for a while...that damage has been here longer than I have (1 year).  Thank you, Dan  Business Analyst Inatech   Third Email:  Is water getting to the computer equipment?  Describe the water flow at it worst.  Thank you, Jerry  Manager Type Inatech   Fourth Email:  Yes, I pay a temp to pour water directly onto the equipment daily...this was a directive from Gayle to test the computer equipment.  The water flow accumulates at a rate of 100 gallons an hour.  Don't you have anything better to do with your time?  Thank you, Dan Business Analyst Inatech

       Not Quite Right   This company's new integrated messaging system lets users click on in-box items to listen to phone messages through the speakers on their PCs. "This worked great for people who had their PCs on top of their desks," says a pilot fish working there. "But most people don't. On Day 1, more than one person was seen bending over and straining to hear his voice messages coming from under his desk."   Not Quite Dead   Frantic user grabs pilot fish on the way out the door, saying her laptop's floppy drive is dead. "Not wanting to go back and unlock our support room, I opened my laptop bag and exchanged drives with her," fish says. But for fish, the drive works fine. "I kept using it until the next user reported a problem," fish says. "Again, I exchanged devices, and everyone was happy. I haven't ordered a replacement drive in the past year, and our users are tickled over the rapid turnaround we give them on their hardware problems."   Not Quite Clear On the Concept   It's the mid-1980s, and this maker of IBM 3270-compatible terminals is rolling out a new line at a big sales meeting. But five minutes into the marketing VP's spiel, the terminals start going black, one by one. The presentation stops while the frantic VP calls engineering. Sighs a pilot fish on the scene, "Turns out this was the first time anyone had heard of the new screen-saver feature we designed into the product."

      I really like Blogging and have found out what many of you already know.   It is highly addictive!  I have found myself updating posts and checking my statistics way more often than I ever intended.  I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and cut the monitor on so I can check to see how many visitors I have had.  I appreciate GOOGLE offerring this for free but there are still some basics that I think they need to provide.  It seems crazy to me that the same company offering a gig of free email space cheaps out on image storage.  Currently, if you want to post a picture you have to host the file on another site as there is no way to upload a file.  GOOGLE also doesn't have any traffic management tools either. If you want to track how many visitor you have or see who is linking to you, then  you have to sign up with a 3rd party service like  urlLink STATCOUNTER  or  urlLink SITEMETER .    The posting tools, while easy enough to use, lack basic formatting buttons such as bullets that you have in your average HTML editor.  There doesn't seem to be any way to hide specific posts for a select group of users or to publish the same post to more than one blog.  I'd like to occasionally publish the same thing to a work blog as is in my personal blog with out having to do an elaborate Copy and Paste.  I would also like better documentation on how to incorporate my Atom Feed into an existing website.  Ironically the weakest feature of GOOGLE is the ability to search for a specific blog or even to search for Blogs featuring the same interests.  You'd think that GOOGLE having built their reputation as the "kings of search" would have a better interface than what they have.  The only way that I have found to search for specific interests on Blogspot is to incorporate them into my own profile.  GOOGLE Blogs seem to get indexed quickly into the GOOGLE search engine but if your name is a common one you will have multiple results that may not even be Blog related.     All in all, I will continue blogging with GOOGLE.  The price is definitely right and I like most of the features but will continue to flirt with LiveJournal and some of their other free sites.  So how has your Blogspot experience been?  Are there other features that you want deployed?

      ...but unfortunately I couldn't find a picture of the 'giant vagina' from the Universtiy of Illinois.  Perhaps someone can email it to me if they have one.  I did find this from the University of Toronto:   Giant genitalia promote safest sex      If you saw a giant penis and vagina wandering outside of Sid Smith yesterday handing out condoms, you were not imagining things.  The two mascots were on the scene to help celebrate “Love Yourself ’99” a health fair dedicated to informing students about a range of good living suggestions, including sexual education, nutrition and chiropractic health.  About 2000 students filed through the fair, to get a taste of what was hoped to be a more relevant approach to health care, from a student perspective.  “We had a wider variety of birth control products this year, such as spermicidal jellies, sponges, and foams,” Bois added, pointing to the corporate sponsors who were invited to give out free samples of everything from yogurt and condoms to water and foam.   Yogurt, Condoms, and Foam, oh my!  This story is from 1999.  How would you like it if you were that guy and 5 years later there is STILL a picture of you on the Internet touching a Penis?

      ...to Rob's to watch USC vs ECU on ESPN but there is one hitch.  The game wasn't on!  You'd think with USC playing in Columbia for a berth to the College World Series that ESPN would televise them.  Instead we were treated to Texas vs Vandy.  We ended going up to a local bar that carried the game on Satellite.  It wasn't crowded at all and we saw USC jump to a 2-0 lead only to have the bottom fall out of the sky downtown.  We didn't get any rain where we were at but apparently the downtown area where the game was at got hit hard.  The game was suspended until 7 and USC held on to win, 4-2.  They only need to win one more game to advance to the CWS.   Go 'Cocks!  This evening I went to see Shrek 2 with Dawn.   This was my second time seeing it but it is a very funny flick.  Dawn and I used to date a few years ago and we just kind of drifted apart.  I hadn't seen her in a while so Shrek seemed like a good venue to re-aquaint ourselves.  It also gave me an opportunity to break my dating slump.  It seems like lately every girl has cancelled at the last moment.  Anyway the streak of chicks backing out has been broken as she kept her word and a good time was had by all!    I got home tonight and checked my stats and people must be taking my advice about going out and having fun.  Traffic is definitely down for today as compared to the weekdays.  One interesting thing did pop out though.  I am the #2 Google Link for the search on the phrase "'little red love machine' lyrics Saliva."  The number one link goes to a Page with the Lyrics for Prince's Little Red Corvette so I am actually #1!    For those of you interested, another good blog is  urlLink Kadybug .  Kadybug seems to be the adventures of a 23 year old woman making her way in California.  Check her out!

      I'm getting ready to ramble over towards Rob's where hopefully we will watch the 'Cocks Kick Some Pirate Ass!  For those of you not in the know, the 'Cocks refers to the University of South Carolina Gamecocks and not some sick, twisted, fantasy of mine.  I graduated from there in 1991 with a BA in International Studies and still follow them.  After the game is over we will probably throw the football around and watch Kill Bill vol1.  Then later tonight I am supposed to go out so we will see what happens.  Now get out there and enjoy your Saturday too!

      South Carolina is seeking its third straight trip to the College World Series. The Gamecocks have won nine straight games in the Regional and Super Regional rounds, dating back to 2002.  # Even though the NCAA doesn't rank these categories, South Carolina must be among the best in the nation in both home runs and strikeout to walk ratio. USC has hit 101 long balls this season -- 25 more than any other team in the SEC. Gamecocks pitchers have recorded the most strikeouts in the conference (609) and allowed the fewest walks (126).  #  South Carolina has lost only two nonconference games all season -- both to Clemson."  Saturday, June 12 Game 1 - East Carolina (51-11) vs. South Carolina (48-15), 1 p.m. (ESPN, regional coverage)   I plan on watching the game over at Rob's this afternoon.  If we could only be this successful in Football!    *sigh*     Sunday, June 13 Game 2 - East Carolina vs. South Carolina, Noon (ESPN, regional coverage)  Monday, June 14 Game 3 - East Carolina vs. South Carolina, 1 or 7 p.m. (ESPN, regional coverage), if necessary

      "Little Bit More" by  urlLink TonyC and The Truth  rocks!  They play the song in it's entirety on their website.  Who can't respect lyrics like:  She's got more freak than Lucky got Charms.  She got me swingin' deep like Barry Bonds.  All night long its a marathon...A supernatural phenome-nome-non  urlLink Not only did Playboy include their music on their forthcoming simulation, PLAYBOY:THE MANSION, they included TonyC in the sim, and flew the band out to play at the real Playboy Mansion!

      CHUGWATER, Wyoming (AP) -- Amy and Steve LeSatz want to be able to teach their clients the finer points of riding and roping without having to trailer their animals 25 miles to the nearest public indoor arena whenever the weather turns miserable.  But the LeSatzes aren't able to build their own riding arena. The only decent site on their property in southeastern Wyoming lies within 300 feet of Chugwater Creek, and building there is far too expensive because of Endangered Species Act restrictions intended to protect the Preble's meadow jumping mouse.  'The mouse that doesn't exist,' Amy LeSatz noted drily.   After six years of regulations and restrictions that have cost builders, local governments and landowners on the western fringe of the Great Plains as much as $100 million by some estimates, new research suggests the Preble's mouse in fact never existed. It instead seems to be genetically identical to one of its cousins, the Bear Lodge meadow jumping mouse, which is considered common enough not to need protection."

      ....before I forgot.  Saliva's new album, Survival of the Sickest, isn't due out til Aug 17th but that hasn't stopped our local radio station from playing it yet.   urlLink WARQ  has gotten a preview copy, and the self titled single kicks major boo-tay.  Towards the end, they even quote Prince off of Little Red Corvette talking about her "little red love machine."   urlLink Saliva  has a snippet of it playing on their website now and you can *probably* find it on your favorite P2P engine in it's entirety.  I heard it for the first time tonight on the way home from the gym and thought it smoked.  After I left my parents I went and worked out with Rob for 2 hours.  We concentrated on shoulders, biceps, and abs.  I am already sore.  On a positive note the sharp pains I had been having when I crawled on my right knee are gone.  My job seems to involve alot of that as people tend to need things disconnected and reconnected to their pc's.   I guess I had some scar tissue or lactic acid that had solified and working out "crunched it up."  I seem to be replacing the lactic acid exponentially though as most of my upper body is one big ache.  When I got home I had a message on the answering machine from a local company that viewed my resume on  urlLink ComputerJobs .  I will look online to see what I can find out about them and then call them on Monday.  Jessi Dee just called too so things are coming up roses right now!

      ...that last post was ultra geeky but I figured it would be worth it if it actually helped someone.  Right now I am posting from my parent's house on one of their pc's.  There network was the very first network that I setup on my own and it has evolved over the years.  It started off with one of those proxy server programs but now i have them on their very own router and I don't have near as many headaches with it.  As I am writing this, Pepper is careening off of the walls and the furniture.  Every so often you hear a really loud "THUD" and I look back to make sure he is ok.  Pepper is our 15 year old Miniature Schnauzer.  He is blind, mostly deaf, and walks with a list to the right but we can't bring ourselves to put him down.  He has been a huge part of our lives, going on vacations with us, guarding the house, keeping us company, and just being a damn good dog.  I wish he could be young again just for a day.  I just hope he isn't suffering too much and he knows that we love him.  I think he does.  I'm going to try and go play with him...

      This computer room's air conditioning system is designed to provide maximum protection for the servers inside. At least that's the idea, says a pilot fish who works for the city government.  "The air conditioning is independent of the main building AC," fish says. "The room has independent power for the pair of ACs, and they're set so that one comes on if the other one fails or the temperature gets too high, even if the main one is still running. This would seem to be excellent protection.  "However, they've both failed to operate properly four times in the past year -- including cooking the room at 130 degrees last time."  So another temperature sensor is added to the room, this one attached to an alarm that goes off at 78 degrees.  One day, staffers notice that the room feels hot. Fish checks the AC. The main unit shows 74 degrees. The wall sensor shows 75. Since the room temperature is supposed to be in the mid-60s, fish knows something is malfunctioning again. He calls the maintenance department, whose repair people arrive promptly and get to work.  They're still working two hours later when the webmaster stops in to ask fish when the crew will be done working around the server racks so he can load some software. No problem, says fish; they're just working on the AC, so you should be able to do it now.  "No way," the webmaster tells fish. "They've got the raised floor up, and I can't get beyond the vacuum they're using to suck up the water."  Water? Fish sprints to the computer room to find water running steadily out from the AC unit. It already covers half the room.  He soon learns why. "The condensation line pump was on the same power circuit as the AC unit," says fish. "So when they shut one off, they shut the other off, and water was backing up into the room."  Since all power lines and connections running along the floor are now threatened by the water, everything has to be shut down.  That includes the servers for a special network used by the public works department. "We notified them that everything is going down, and the deputy director came down," fish says. "We showed him the water flowing in and he got on the phone with his consultant.  "Standing next to the hole in the floor, with water running in and a shop vacuum pulling water up, he turned to me to ask, 'When do you think it will be back up?'  "I swallowed the first replies that occurred to me and finally managed to say that until they stop the water coming in, I couldn't say.  "Next up on the list? Under-floor water sensors, holes drilled in the floor to vent water to the parking level, and line pumps on a different power circuit than the ACs themselves.  "Someday maybe I'll do some computer-related work."    I feel the same way sometimes...

      ...waiting on a 1 'oclock Conference Call that I have  ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN .  I don't even think that I can fake this.  At least this gives me a chance to do some updating.  After this I think I am either going to go workout or go swimming.  I went to lunch with the coworker who bought the Mustang Convertible today.  It rides sweet and is certainly a 'babe magnet' as several heads whipped by as we were cruising.  He is 40 years old, has a live in girl friend with 2 daughters, and an 'open relationship'.  He seems to feel a compelling urge to tell me about his sex life.  I admit that some of it is interesting but the girls I have seen him with (in public) are, "How shall we say?"   BUTT UGLY!    (Did I mention I have a boring Conference Call?)   Last night was "SWIM MEET" night at the neighborhood pool.  I only mention this because it is truly an amazing sight to behold and only happens once a year.  I don't actually have a pool membership there (When I speak of going swimming it is usually at my parent's house) but the pool is clearly visible from the road.  I say it is amazing because while the pool is normal size (think Holiday Inn pool), there are easily 200 cars parked in the parking lot and the road.  Then when you look at the pool itself, all you see are a mass of kids!  Water isn't even visible.  That is just a little too crowded for me.    Some Random Thoughts:  Ken Griffey made this weeks Sports Illustrated cover, meaning he will be hurt soon! I sent out 5 more resumes today.  (Did I mention I have a boring Conference Call?)  Ray Charles died. Nancy Reagan may split the Republican party with her stance on Stem Cell Research.  (SIGH)  The boring Conference Call has started....

       At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's 'Sex Out Loud' Health Awareness Fair in March, the Feminist Majority organization sponsored a 'giant vagina structure' for which students could pay a dollar and stick their heads in to have their pictures taken. Said a spokesperson, 'There are a lot of phallic symbols in society, and we wanted to put a vaginal one out there.' [Daily Illini, 3-19-04]  ...and he's not vaginally challenged!

      ...pissed off here.  I could've gotten off work early today but waited around til almost 6 because my buddy and I were supposed to go work out.  The gym is real near my work but 30 minutes from my house.  It is also near my bud's house and work.  Well, he decided he didn't want to work out til 8:30!  I could've been out of there by 3 if I had known that!    I got home and  crashed for a little bit and then went and got a haircut.  While the chick who cuts my hair is finishing up he calls.   He started giving me shit when I told him I wasn't working out.  Coming home made me realize just how sore I really am.  Anyway that really pissed me off.  About the only good that came out of staying late is that I was able to send out 4 resumes to good matches.  I also set up an account on Monster, ComputerJobs, HotJobs, and CareerBuilder.  I will check out DICE.COM tomorrow.  Special thanks to Johnny for suggesting it.  I am FINALLY getting in the right frame of mind to do this.

      My actual resume is longer but it was taking up too much space on here so I editted it down some.  Inatech is not the actual company I work at now.  I changed the name to protect the not-so-innocent.  IF anyone feels compelled to see it in full just email me and I will hook you up.  In other news, I was considering going swimming but it looks like it is about to rain.  Maybe tomorrow I can.  In the meantime I will just blog some and send out some resumes.

      Sorry I haven't been my usual posting self but I felt the need to start putting out some resumes.  Rumors continue to fly!  To top it off, one of my coworkers is going to buy a new 2004 40th Anniversary Edition Candy Apple Red Mustang Convertible.  Does he know something I don't?  I am thinking he is nuts!  I have been in squirrel mode, trying to knock all of my monthly expenses down.  I almost have my car paid off!  Ideally I find a job right away but you never know what will happen.  On a side note, check out Johnny Monk at  urlLink Beyond The Cubicle .  Apparently he is in the biz also and has some pretty good stuff there too.  I'm looking forward to some Office Space type stories and more camping exploits.  As soon as I get motivated I will link to him.  So, what are some of your resume/job hunting sites?  I'm using Monster, ComputerJobs, and HotJobs right now.  Any ideas are welcome!

      ...went over to Rob's house.  I walked in the door and Noah immediately said "Da-Da."  He thought I was Rob.  He is getting pretty big and climbs over everything.  You have to watch him or he will wind up falling off a chair or the couch.  One of the cool things he will do is make the appropriate noise when you ask "What does the dog say?"  Rob had copied  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back  so we watched a few minutes of it til Jennifer made us quit.  She was afraid someone would ask Noah "what does Jay say?"  and he'd reply, "mudder-fuggah!"  We grilled out and had some corn and then headed to the gym.  I am going to be sore tomorrow and really sore on Friday.  We worked out our chest, triceps, and abs.  Wolf's was busy when we first got there but we stayed a good 2 hours and it cleared out by the time we left.  Since I have gotten home I have just randomly surfed the web.  Nothing major going on:   Britney Spears did something to her knee. Mozilla Firefox 0.9 is out! and Tim Couch got released. Aside from that, it appears to be a slow news day.

      A coworker came in asking for some floppy disks.  As I was rooting around in my desk my hand touches an envelope.  I flip it over and printed in my own handwriting is “DAD.”   I forgot to send my Dad his Father's Day card last year!   I felt bad and called him up and apologized.  He said he didn’t even notice and reminded me I had taken both of them to dinner last year.  I seem to recall this but can’t figure out why I still have the card.  I guess this Father’s Day (Sunday, June 20, 2004) he will get two!  Today has been pretty slow workwise.  There have been a few phone issues associated with yesterday’s office moves but nothing major.  If the trend continues and the weather is good tomorrow, I will probably work a half day and then go swimming at the parents.    Later today I am supposed to go workout.  I think we are concentrating on the Chest group today.  I went on Sunday and worked out my legs.  I was sore on Monday but REALLY SORE yesterday!  Today I seem to be healing up so it is time to inflict pain to a new group of muscles.

       VELVET REVOLVER!   I heard Slither on a business trip to Atlanta, GA.  I tuned in right after it had begun playing but the music was easily recognizable.  I thought they sounded pretty good.  A friend of a friend thought they sounded pretty bad.   I'm just happy to hear them again.  I used to like Axl Rose as a musician but lost all respect for him  after I read this: Slash (born Saul Hudson), McKagan and Sorum left Guns N' Roses in the mid-nineties after singer Axl Rose insisted the band abandon the sound that made "Appetite for Destruction" sell 15 million records to experiment with electronic and industrial music.   There is probably some truth to that as I heard Axl's GNR and it sounded like Nine Inch Nails.  So far it seems to be getting good reviews.     The Washington Post said in its review that with 'such anthemic burners as 'Sucker Train Blues,' 'Do It for the Kids' and incendiary first single 'Slither' ... there's nothing even slightly ironic about the old-school theatrics of Velvet Revolver. These days, that's a beautiful thing.'    'Incendiary guitars and locomotive grooves ... added up to a sweltering performance successfully designed to be a welcome throwback to the days before rock n' roll was invaded by clowns like Nickelback,' said the Chicago Sun-Times."  If it is out this weekend I just may have to invest!

      was a long day.  I woke up late and got in to find that the PC I was expecting yesterday had finally made it in.   I worked on that expecting to find a virus issue but it turned out to be a bad MB and I just recommended that they buy a new one.  I hated doing that because the girl and her husband aren't in the best of financial shape but there wasn't much I could do for it.  I did manage to save their data though for them.  Then later in the afternoon it was time to play "lets move our offices around".  This makes no sense to me because we have it on good authority that we will be being layed off in several weeks but the ladies had to get it out of their system.  My part in this involved moving the phones, the pc's, and helping move some furniture.  I hope that I'm wrong about it but I don't think that I am.  Ironically one of the movees had a job interview at 5:30.  I wish her well.  Afterwards Billy, Dick, and I went to a local pub called  urlLink Buckets .  (If you go there be sure to check out the first staff link which has some pictures.  Most of the girls there are easy on the eyes.)  The mood was upbeat but we just talked about how all of the signs point to a July 1 WFR (Work Force Reduction).  The last time it happened, Corprate HR Flew in to "counsel" people.  Our terminal manager, Billy, had to announce this in a meeting in our  warehuse in front of 300 angry employees with no HR in sight.  I told him if it happens this time he should conclude it with "...but I have some good news.  I just saved a ton of money on my car insurance."   If that happens I may get to stay a little longer winding up the computer stuff but it will just delay the inevitable.    Our favorite waitress, April, was there for the first time in a while and she came over and sat down for a while. She seems like she has had a hard life.  She is somehow affiliated with a motorcycle gang although neither her nor her husband ride.  While she was there, Dick left because he "heard/felt nature calling."  She left and a short time later Dick came back and proceeded to go into graphic detail about his "power dump."  I got in a good one though.  Dick proceeded to tell us a story about the time he shit on a dump truck (don't ask) when I broke in and explained that in Indianna, where Dick is from, a dumptruck is slang for an erect penis.  I thought Billy was going to spray beer everywhere.    Thats it for now.  As always, I wish you well.

         "NEW YORK (AP) - - Saying his personal life is off-limits, singer Marc Anthony refused to confirm Tuesday whether he's married to Jennifer Lopez."    Yes, I married that woman....Consumated the marriage as we were going down the aisle and 6 more times before the reception.  No, I'm afraid you cant speak to the missus.  (wink wink) She is tired!

After 21 years as a Hypnotist helping people with everyday concerns, I have developed a course to help you have a better day. It consists of the principles of how your mind works and lessons which you can work through at home. Two lessons are published each Friday. I encourage you to try it out."

      I couldn't decide whether to post this or not.  It is kind of weird because she and I know each other but have never gone out before.  I had made a date with her one other time before and she cancelled on me then too.  We were supposed to do something after work today but I guess she changed her mind somewhere between "Yes" and 5:30.  Oh well.  As rejection goes this isn't too bad as there wasn't much there to begin with.   Hey, i am sorry if i have hurt you in anyway. i am a very busy person. i really don't have time for a personal life. i told you that to begin with. i was very up front about that. so i am sorry if i hurt you, i didn't mean it. i think that it is best that we remain friends if possible. but i can't promise you anything else. i know it is really shitty to say this thru an email, but it is the only way for me to do it. i am not really good with words face to face or even phone to phone. you deserve better than what i can give you. i am sorry again. i hope we can remain friends. you are very nice and patient to put up with my crap. marie   I just don't know why she made the dates to begin with.  Oh well, she had her chance to ride Space Mountain!  Now on to other fish in the sea...Comments on this piece will be greatly appreciated!!!

      It's been a really slow day today for me.  I am waiting on a coworker to ship me her PC to fix but I probably won't get that until sometime after 3'oclock today.  In the meantime I have just been surfing around and doing random stuff to keep me entertained.  Well lunch time rolled around and 2 of my coworkers drug me out to a Mexican restaurant.  I say "drug" but there really wasn't too much pressure involved.  I like Mexican and was looking for an excuse to get out, so off I go with Billy and Dick.  Anyway we get to El Loco Gringo (not the real name) and are seated pretty quickly in a section in the back.  We sit down and almost instantly get a bowl of chips and salsa to munch on while we order.   Our waiter comes up (most of the wait staff there are Mexican guys) and appears nervous.  In hindsight it is not a good sign.  We each order our food and get water to drink.  Dick also orders some bean dip and the waiter leaves.    We are all munching down on chips and salsa, shooting the shit and doing the things guys do when they aren't at work.   Dick:  Did you see the tits on that chick? Billy and I:  Where?? Probably 15 minutes pass and we are out of water and no bean dip in sight.  Now normally this place is pretty good and already has your food to you but not today.  Another five minutes pass and we flag down another waiter and get a refill and he brings some bean dip and more chips/salsa.  By now Billy and Dick are starting to get antsy.  Billy is making speculations on the waiter's ancestry and Dick is calling him a pizza-face.  I'm just chilling out but am starting to get hungry.  Then the original waiter came over and said that they had installed a new ticket system  and that there was a "mis-confusion with our orders but that they would be right up."  Another 15 minutes pass and Billy and Dick are really getting po'd.  We start looking around and notice that everyone around us that arrived after we did is already eating although there is another table that seems to be finished and waiting for their bill.  They never get their bill and walk out.  Finally it gets to be too much for Billy and he walks up to the counter to tell them we are out of there.  They offered to give it to us to go but we were short on time so we headed back to the office.    I thought about hitting a burger joint but ended up just grabbing a hotdog from one of our vending machines.  I ended up coming out ahead when you figure I got a hotdog with chips, salsa and bean dip for a buck!  I think it will be a while though before we visit El Loco Gringo again.

      Unfortunately I vote 'DEAD' but  urlLink it  is an entertaining Blog nonetheless... I don't really know how I feel about it affecting his family though.  It seems like if it were true Alan Handelman would be all over this!  The 20th anniversary of Kaufman's death has provided the occasion for some "Andy Kaufman is alive!" rumors, fueled primarily by a blog and a press release (widely distributed via Yahoo!) proclaiming that he has emerged from hiding two decades after faking his death — accounts supposedly confirmed by his having given an interview to ABC and submitted to (and passed) DNA testing. And all of this screams of being a very un-Kaufman-like publicity stunt.  (Note that the putative Andy Kaufman blog now disclaims that, contrary to details provided in the press release, he was not interviewed by ABC, and the alleged DNA testing was not conducted by the auditing firm of Ernst & Young. This seems rather transparently indicative of someone's having to backpedal after receiving complaints from companies disgruntled at having their names associated with a hoax, or at the very least of having to explain away why no one else has been able to confirm the same information.)  The supposed recent photographs of Andy (appearing as Tony Clifton, his abusive lounge singer character) displayed in the blog were taken from a May 2004 Andy Kaufman tribute event, during which Kaufman's friend and writing partner, Bob Zmuda, played Tony Clifton. Zmuda himself said, during a 1999 interview:      "The hoax and the practical joke are lost art forms." But did Andy Kaufman pull one last stunt on his deathbed at age 35? No, says Zmuda. "Andy Kaufman is dead. He’s not in some truck stop with Elvis." While Kaufman tinkered with the idea, tells Zmuda, he never brought it up again.  If the real Andy Kaufman were back, his story would be picked up by every major news service in the U.S. and a good many abroad, not merely a single "anybody can submit a story" free publicity service. And if the real Andy Kaufman genuinely wanted to demonstrate he was still alive, just one public appearance would serve that purpose far more convincingly than an unverifiable DNA test. Most important, if the Andy Kaufman I remember — the brilliant, unpredictable, erratic, and unique comic genius — had finally emerged from hiding twenty years after faking his own death, I have no doubts that he'd find a much more imaginative way of revealing his return than a free press release and a rather ordinary blog.

      beautiful, witty, charming, and talented, Jessica Dee for taking my "blog cherry" with her insightful comments.  Gotta love the keggers and sorority swapping... It's been so long since I've walked around in the locker room naked with a bunch of women and funelled at a kegger and woken up with someone with a third nipple whose name I don't know...  Those were the days.  What a woman!

      In my mind he has been the greatest president of my lifetime.  Here are a few excerpts from CNN  The nation's 40th president gave rise to a new generation of conservatives, reshaped the Republican Party, challenged Democrats to redefine themselves and altered the political dynamic in the nation's capital.  As the nation marks the death of Reagan, who lost a 10-year battle with Alzheimer's disease on Saturday, historians, ideological allies and onetime adversaries considered the impact the movie star-turned-president had on the political world.  'The father of the modern Republican conservative movement,' is how Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, put it in paying tribute to Reagan.  Republican control of Congress can largely be credited to Reagan. Although Republicans did not win the U.S. House until 1994 -- well after Reagan left office -- that break in almost 50-years of Democratic control of Congress came after Reagan inspired a legion of conservative Republicans to run for office.  'All of us who participated in the Contract with America were standing on Ronald Reagan's shoulders,' said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, referring to the document promising a reformed Congress and a balanced budget that Republicans ran on in 1994.  Reagan, it can be argued, is responsible for the two Bush presidents. The first President Bush served as Reagan's vice president before winning the White House, and many Republican see the current President Bush as the political heir to Reagan.  With his boundless optimism, modest demeanor and unabashed patriotism, Reagan presented a new image for conservatives when he was elected to the presidency in 1980.  He brought back a sense of warmth toward the presidency, a sentiment that had dissolved with the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.  'Reagan restored a sense of hope, a sense of uplift about the presidency,' said presidential historian Robert Dallek. 'Now it's ironic, because he preached the idea that government was not the solution, government was the problem. And yet, when he left the White House, he had kind of rekindled affection for the presidency.'  As president, Reagan's priorities were building the U.S. military, lowering taxes and reducing the size and scope of government. Under him, the U.S. deficit also grew at record levels -- something the current Congress finds itself grappling with anew.  Reagan also tapped into religious voters as never before. 'Reagan brought religious conservatives into the Republican Party,' Schneider said.  Today, religious conservatives are a key base within the GOP.  Reagan's onetime Democratic foes conceded the impact he had on politics. Former Vice President Walter Mondale, who got trounced by Reagan in the 1984 election, hailed Reagan's ability to touch the American people and his political acumen. While Mondale made clear the policy disagreements remain, Reagan, he said, was a 'genius' at campaigning who successfully challenged the opposition.  'I think he did challenge the Democrats, unlike any modern Republican presidential candidate, on the question of the basic direction of American government, particularly as it dealt with domestic policies and domestic economics,' Mondale told CNN. 'And it did shift the grounds of the debate.'"

      ...I Slept in and got up around 10 or so.  I did some cleaning and just piddled around til 1 or so and then went over to Rob's.  We took his son and went grocery shopping at Aldi's.  It is a neat place, sort of like a mini-SAM's Wholesale.  You put a quarter in a dispenser to get a cart.  If you return the cart you get your quarter back.  It seems to be a good incentive system for people to return their carts because you don't see them all scattered about like at other grocery stores.  I bought a few cans of peas, some Salmon steaks,   We went back and grilled some steaks and watched a movie called Going Greek.  From the website:   Remember a time when the beer flowed a little colder, sex was a little easier, and life was a little less complicated... Or so we thought.  Echoing such hits as "Animal House", "Something About Mary" and "American Pie", GOING GREEK bucks the recent trend of gross-out teen comedies which lack the heart and likeable characters of their predecessors.  Set in any-college U.S.A., GOING GREEK tells the story of Jake, an embittered ex-high school football star who is coerced into pledging the "coolest" fraternity on campus in order to protect Gil, his somewhat nerdy, but greek-obsessed cousin.  As several of the frat brothers step up their attempts to force Gil into quitting the house, Jake enlists the aid of his fellow pledges into seeing the big-hearted Gil through to the end.  Through keg parties, sorority swapping, and other creative pledge activities, Jake quickly learns that no man is an island and that the friends we make in college are friends for life.  All in all it was ok.  It definitely was the type of movie that makes me wish that I lived on campus in college.  Afterwards I went over to my parents and swam and then headed back home.   Exciting stuff for a Saturday, huh?

      I have been slack.  I haven't updated since Thursday night.  To bring you up to speed I was planning on going out Friday but the girl cancelled on me.  This is the second time in 3 weeks that has happened, albeit with different women.  I really must investigate this thing called "soap."    Work called and the GM was po'd.  It seems someone in Atlanta is undermining him and he needs me to "hack" into their time card program to prove otherwise.  It looks like that will be what Im up to tomorrow, in addition to fixing a coworkers pc.  Special thanks to Jessica for calling me and cheering me up.  She rocks!  Jessica assured me this joke is universally funny:   Q)  How does a woman hold her liquor? A)  By his ears!   I almost died laughing but Mom didn't think it was so funny.   Go figure.

        Walter, an apologetic-looking dog adopted from the pound, passes gas morning, noon, and night, no matter what he eats, whether it's a 25-pound bag of low-fart dog biscuits, cat food, or fried chicken. On the bright side, 'If Uncle Irv let one slip, he just went and stood near Walter.'   When Father reaches the limit of his patience with Walter's flatulence, he decides the pooch is once again pound-bound, despite Betty and Billy's pleading. Poor Walter knows his days are numbered and 'He resolved to hold in his farts forever.'   That very night, two burglars break into Walter's family's house, and (you can see where this is going) Walter gasses the burglars with a 'hideous cloud' that forces them to drop their loot and run into the clutches of the police officers, 'choking and gasping for air.'   The next morning Father and Mother discover Walter has saved the day--or at least their silverware and VCR. 'And so the family learned to live with Walter, the hero dog. And that is the end of our tail.' Or is it? Fans will be pleased to discover the next book Walter the Farting Dog: Trouble at the Yard Sale.   Audrey Colman's highly stylized illustrations, imbued with a surreal, Monty Pythonesque collage look, are as absurdly comical as this silly story that is purely powered by natural gas. (Ages 5 to 8) --Karin Snelson"  Rating:   -  Everyone at Neverland Ranch just loves it!  Why can't you read them this story? Its the second most loving thing you can do with a child.  -- Michael Jackson   Rating:   -  I like to read!  I laughed.  I cried.  Oops.  I farted.  Excuse me!  -- Me    Rating:   -  I like to read too!  Plagued for years with flatulence problems of my own, I was happy to see that the sometimes uncontrollable release of bodily gas has finally been embraced by the mainstream culture.  Despite my condition, I've been a fan of farts since I was a little boy. Now married, with no children of my own, it's difficult to find someone that appreciates a good fart as much as I do. While books like "Everybody Poops" and "The Gas We Pass: The Story of Farts", have temporarily satisfied my need for quality fart humor, I was craving something new.   -- Anonymous

       urlLink USATODAY.com - Virtual real estate boom draws real dollars   Large swathes of undeveloped online property, some bearing an uncanny resemblance to a palm-studded West Coast beachfront idyll, are selling for up to $550 an acre.  That amount is but a song compared with real world real estate, but these are computerized representations of property — pretty pictures, if you will — in an online graphic role-playing game known as Second Life.  "The idea of land ownership and the ease with which you can own land and do something with it... is intoxicating," said Philip Rosedale, CEO of Second Life creator, San Francisco-based Linden Labs.  Second Life is a relatively new entry into the world of Massively Multiplayer Online games, known to enthusiasts as MMOs. (Some refer to them as MMORPGs, massively multiuser online role-playing games.) Like Sony's EverQuest and Electronic Arts' The Sims Online, players create their own civilizations and interact with others living alternative lives online.  Starting a "second life" costs $9.95 a month and requires a download at the game's Web site and a fairly powerful Mac or Windows-based computer. Current players arrange welcoming parties for newbies and often help point them toward plots available for virtual homesteading.    I don't get it...It seems like starting a Second Life would require you to not have a First!

      ...I got a call from our GM who happens to be in Atlanta on a business trip.  He needs me to go to his house and look at his computer.  His wife is frantic because she can't connect to the Internet and everything is running slowly.  She is afraid they have virii and making his life &%$^ til he gets it fixed.    Its a slow day anyway so I go and take a look at it.  Sure enough I can't connect either.  Before I left I had burned a CD with some Norton Virus Defs and the latest ADAWARE reflist file.  I ran ADAWARE and it detected 469 files!  Spybot S&D detected 70.  Afterwards I deleted the Winsock and restored Internet access.  I set them up with a HOSTS file and 2 resident programs that will block adware.  Amazingly Norton detected nothing on a full scan.  I set them up to do a Windows Update and full AV scan in the middle of the night.  They had a trial version of Stopzilla, a pay for popup blocker.  I killed that and installed the GOOGLE toolbar for IE and Mozilla Firefox.  I reconfigured ZoneAlarm and updated it too.  By this time its 4:30.  I hung around and gave them a crash course on spyware/firefox.  In the past  month I bet have done over 7 of these by just word of mouth.  I really need to start charging for this!  Anyway that is why I haven't been on much or updated since last night.  I am trying to get caught back up and get my news fix on.

      ...was minding my own business contemplating an early bedtime when I  got a call from the coworkers.  They were up at The Woodshed and wanted me to come up for a few beers.  It didnt take much arm-twisting.  I got a quick shower and headed up.  When I got there it was doing pretty good.  There were more women than usual and both Dick and Billy were in rare form.  Dick is an older man of 55, but tonight he was trying to pick a fight with a 24 or 25 year old guy.  It all came down to he didn't like him shaking his butt in Dick's general direction.  Anyway, they eventually 'made up' and Dick may have bought him a drink.  I met Steve and Amanda up there through Billy.  Steve seems to be a nice guy but he is 22 and "clueless."  You know the type I am sure.  Happy-Go-Lucky and not a care in the world.  Amanda is his girlfriend I gathered and also 22.   She is a cutie.  Not "HOT" but she has a certain style to her and seems to be pretty smart.  Im thinking I would like to get to know her better but I'm 34 and she has a boyfriend.  Overall there were some hot chicks.  It is definitely on the  "red" side but I think I'd like to investigate further on a Friday.

       urlLink Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters : "'Yahoo's new browser toolbar is advertised to clean out adware and spyware from the user's PC and from the sound of it is a good tool to rely on. Not so, says eWeek, whose Matt Hicks notices that Yahoo excludes by default two popular adware/spyware applications - Claria (ex-Gator) and WhenU.com, which have commercial bonding with Yahoo!

It looks like a multi-layered defense of using a HOST file, Router, Firewall, updated Antivirus program, Spyware Guard, Windows Updates, and running Spybot/AdAware regularly is STILL the ONLY way to go.

      ...my boss had me send the a$$hat in Atlanta a new laptop.  It shouldn't bother me but I was planning on using that for when I travelled.  Said a$$hat didn't help me do the inventory that he was supposed to have done while I was down there.  C'est La vie.  I can't get too mad though because he makes "jack."    I haven't been too busy at work today so I have done some redesign of my Blog.  I added a new picture, Changed my "motto," added an About Me section to my profile, and tweaked the HTML to allow me to add a Favorites section.  All in all, I am happy with it.  I have ZERO comments though.  I guess I am changing my mind about others viewing it.    One of the links I added was to tjsplace.blogspot.com.  If you haven't checked it out, you should give it a read.  The guy works in a Strip club but draws you in with his writing style.    In case you are wondering, The Daily Shark is an email that I get daily from ComputerWorld.  It chronicles various IT folks daily adventures with their clueless users.

      "You locked me out of my account," irritated user complains to help desk pilot fish. "Why did you lock me out? What did I do?" Your account is automatically locked out after the third unsuccessful attempt to log in, fish says while resetting the account. You DO know that, right? Silence. User: "It works now. Will I have this problem tomorrow?" Fish: "I hope not.""   Sounds like a coworker, if I had coworkers anymore.

       urlLink Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters : "'Reuters reports that Sun's President and COO thinks hardware will be free and that people will pay for software subscriptions instead. Reuters quotes Schwartz: 'In our world, you will subscribe to the software and the hardware is free.' 'Directionally, our expectation is that in fiscal 2005 you're going to see a rapid departure from selling hardware, software and services apart.' 'Bill Gates and I agree that within four to five years hardware will be free.' We've recently read here on /. how Gates thinks hardware will be free.'"    I don't think we will ever see FREE hardware.  Just cheap!

      Ok, my coworkers ditched me and I didn't get to go to lunch til later as my car was being worked on but that is OK!  I went out with the GM and had a free meal on the company!  So now I am back at work being bored.  I don't feel bad about the free meal as we are probably getting ready to be downsized.  I need to get as many "benefits" from them as I can.  If anyone needs a Systems Admin with/without experience in the Logistics Industry look me up at www.gtmills.com   If/When that happens I will probably put more of my time/energy into freelancing.

      This will be just a quick blog while I am waiting on some coworkers to come back from lunch.  Initially I look for this to be a place where I can publish some of my tech fixes.   I'm not sure how autobiographical this will get and am not entirely comfortable with the idea of having it "public" but we will see.

      I got woke up in the middle of the night last night by my work cell phone. Apparently our Greenville office experienced a pretty bad storm and lost power. This meant the phones were down, the computers were down, and the scanners were down.       The Night Supervisor there asked me "What  should I do?"  Damn Cell Phones!  What does he expect me to do anyway?  It isn't like I control the Power Company.  Damn him!      "Wait 3 hours and if that doesn't work I may have to walk you through re-wiring the Electrical Panel  over the phone."   Why the %$@# do you care anyway?  Hello, McFly, We are getting laid off, not laid!      I knew full well that everything would be fixed by the time I got up but I called the Electric Company anyway just to cover my ass. The Night Supervisor seemed pretty anxious about it so I knew the power could be off 24 hours from now and I wouldn't hear from him again. Mission Accomplished.     Moral of the story:  Don't %@#$ with me when I am asleep!     Today was a pretty good day. I decided to slack off and did not go into work at all. I have an arrangement with the GM. Since I am being laid off I don't have to go in unless their is a need or an emergency. I can do phone support from the house or wherever. I thought that was a pretty good deal sice they have been pretty crappy about it otherwise.    Speaking of their being crappy about my layoff, I found out when my termination date is:     August 31st.    That %$#@ing sucks! Because of the W.A.R.N. Act they were required to pay me until then regardless. I could be double-dipping or looking for work full time like the other staff positions they let go. Sometimes I think I must be Irish.     Being unlucky does have it's advantages though. I never have developed a gambling addiction and don't even bother wasting money on LOTTO. I can listen to the radio virtually undistracted by their contests.    This evening I went out with my sister for dinner.   No, Stephen, I didn't get lucky there either, you sick bastard.      We had Mexican and then I went to Kinko's and made some 200 flyers advertising my computer biz. I plan on getting up early tomorow, hitting a few rich neighborhoods nearby, and plastering their mail boxes with them. Hopefully I can drum up some extra income for now, and later when I am RRD free (thats a clue to where I work). Wish me well, and if this doesn't work out maybe Jay will hire me to be the Comment-Singer at  urlLink his blog.

      I get tons of emails offering me everything from penis enlargement to "Bill Gates offering me free cash to test out his latest email tracker."  Some how I never get the quality stuff.  I found this on CNN and had to share it even though most of you have probably already seen it already.     urlLink         PS:  Speaking of email, I finally got a GMail invite.  I was reading  urlLink Slashdot  and one of the regulars had posted that he had some invites to spare.   He was kind enough to forward me one of his "extras."   I am now GTMills@gmail.com as well as about 6 other email addresses that I plan on consolidating.  A Gig of storage should be enough for a while, don't ya think?

      ...be careful what you ask for.  Previously I had reported that  urlLink Google was advertising for the Olsen twins on my site.      Mmmmmmmm...Olsen twin goodness....Yummmmy!     Now they have switched it to the Nigeria New which boasts "Stay in touch with events back home Get Nigeria news here!"    Somehow it just isn't the same....    Have a great weekend, everyone!

      The other night I was minding my business at home when I got a call from Rick and Billy. Rick was the Safety/Loss Prevention Mgr where I worked until  urlLink he was laid off last week  and Billy is the Terminal Manager there. Billy and I are still working but Rick is already collecting his unemployment.     Rick is about 55, drives a Dodge Dakota Truck, and fancys himself a Cowboy. He is fond of saying stuff like "If you can't be a good example, you can serve as a good example of a bad example." Despite all of that he is a pretty cool guy to hang out and have a beer or 30 with.    Billy, on the other hand, is more of a high-tech redneck. He used to be a manager at UPS and has an ex wife and 2 kids. He is country but always manages to pull a witty saying or two out of his ass.    Rick and Billy had been out golfing and were pounding a few back at a local watering hole near work when they had the bright idea to call me. After a little arm-twisting they convinced me to go up there.    I got cleaned up and left. I had to stop for gas along the way so it was about 45 minutes to an hour after I talked to them when I got there. It was busy but I managed to get a parking spot and headed inside.     I looked around and didn't see them. I was just about to leave when I spotted them sitting at the bar. In addition to being sun-burnt they were both pretty "wasted." I had to stand up as there weren't any empty barstools and got a cold Miller Lite from their bucket. Billy was in rare form and Rick was already starting to slur his words.     I was well in to my second beer when Rick announced, "I'm a heading home to see the old lady."    Now Rick lives about an hour away up the Interstate. I repeatedly offered to drive him back to my place and Billy offered him a place to stay too but Rick wouldn't hear any of it.    "If I don't come home tonight, Carla's gonna be pissed."      You should see what she will do if something happens to the truck.     Well, eventually Billy and I gave up and Rick headed out the door. I grabbed his barstool and watched Billy try to pick up an old bar-hag by blowing straw covers at her. This wasn't going too well so I settled up, said my goodbyes and left.     As I am walking through the parking lot I see Rick, still stumbling around, looking drunk and lost. I follow him back in the bar and watched him straggle over towards Billy. Now keep in mind it has been about 20 minutes or so since he left.    "Where have you been 'cuz?"     Billy calls everyone 'cuz or 'bo.    "  I was walking out to my truck when some dude pulled me aside. He said the PO-LICE were around and it wasn't safe to drive. He said he wasn't drunk but he didn't have a license."    Well, both Billy and I thought this was a little odd, ok, alot odd, but we didn't pick on Rick too much about his Parking Lot Buddy. Afterall, he was pretty schknockered and it would have taken too much drunken explaining. I hung out for a few more minutes and then left.    The next morning I got a call from Billy.      He carried Rick home and they both crashed hard. They did some "cyphering" and figured that they each had over 25 beers a piece that night.    They might be alcoholics.     Rick couldn't find his keys so he called his old lady to meet them at the bar.      Rick and Billy pulled in almost simultaneously as Rick's wife Carla. They all three noticed Rick's truck was gone at the same time too.     The owner was at the bar and confirmed that it hadn't been towed.      Rick's Parking Lot Buddy had stolen his truck!      Rick's wife was pretty understanding about it.      Billy said she cussed Rick out, hit him in the head, kicked him in the balls, and then kneed him in the head again.   "I felt bad for 'ol Rick but I was afraid she was gonna come for me next, 'bo,  so I high-tailed it outta there."     Note to self:  Don't piss Carla off.     To make matters worse Rick was so drunk there was no way he could even begin to ID his Parking Lot Buddy. Parking Lot Buddy had gotten quite a haul. In addition to Rick's Dodge Dakota truck he also got some of his rings (valued at $3000), his digital camera and Rick's self-respect.     Rick's life had gone to shit in the space of a week's time. He was flown to the Corporate Office and laid off unceremoniously, got a massive hangover, had his truck stolen with his valuables, and his buddy watched him get the tar beat out of him by his wife.    I guess the old man was right.      He had become a good example of a bad example.

      ...in their infinite wisdom, has decided that my site should advertise for Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen.  I believe I mentioned them ONCE in a previous post and it wasn't something that they would probably find flattering.    The specific ad says "MARY KATE ASHLEY GAMES."     How about a little game of Pin The Tails Of The Olsens' followed by some Good Twin/Bad Twin?  The ad says "Our Lips Are Sealed" but I think I can handle that!    I am at work now but have decided to take the res of the afternoon off to go swimming at my parents' house.  I still haven't got any positive job news to report.  The Columbia, SC IT market seems to be dead still.  I am considering going into business for myself doing tech support.  Does anyone here have any small business experience or suggestions?    Thats all for now.  I have some good story ideas that I will try posting in the next couple of days.  Til then....Peace!

        CALL 555-1212        Seriously, you have to check out Jennifer Shiman's  urlLink AngryAlien  website.   Bunnies doing 30 second movie clips is a stroke of genius.  The Titanic spoof is particularly good, as is the 3rd grade diary.      I wonder if she is a babe?

             When I wrote the “Coach K” piece I had no idea it would be up there by itself for several weeks time.    I don’t really have a good explanation for my disappearance other than to say that I just really didn’t feel like blogging.    I do appreciate all of the nice comments though and decided to post them again and reply to them.    I hope you can forgive me.

Me:    Kev, Jay, and Vaderrrgrl are the most commented bloggers I know of.    They should sell advertising space.      Sorry if I disappointed you but I’ll try to be more “regular” Maybe I need "Metamucil for Blogging."

Rick Fox was a character on there, he  played a famous NBA player who was convicted of rape and sent to OZ.  Isnt it weird and almost surreal that Kobe and Rick are on the same  team....

Must be busy selling all of the office supplies on E bay :)                      Me:    Kady and Vader, Thanks for thinking of me.    I’m cool (even if I don’t get to sit with the “cool” kids at lunch!                                                                     Maybe Kobe should sue Rick for being a poor role model.    Imprison Kobe,                              Although maybe playing with the “new and reduced” Lakers might be just                          effective punishment.                                           Regarding “Anonymous” and the E-bay sell off, it seems like an intriguing idea.

Been  through it twice, my friend. Somehow it always seems like it works out  for the better in the end. I know that sounds trite, but it was really  true for me and I hope the same goes for you. Oh, and milk that  unemployment for all it's worth. Best 5 months of my life.                    Me:    Thanks to all of you for your kind thoughts.    I have a few irons in the fire so we will see what happens, Vee.                           I agree about work sucking, Katy, but I am afraid we have to do it.    I do long to be a man of leisure though.    If any of you ladies would like a “kept man” I am available.                           JP,  I will have to write about how my team “single-handedly” crippled Jamal  Anderson, Edgerrin James, and Terrell Davis one year.    It was absolutely incredible.    We went from being a lock for the playoffs to, quite literally, limping in and getting the shit kicked out of us.                      Sloth, Gooch and Johnny, you are right about the “vacation” but I am sure it will wear off quickly.    I have been unemployed before and it gets old quickly.                          Jay,  Funny you should mention going postal as that is one of the products  that we delivered. “Going Postal” was always an inside joke with us.
