      My self-esteem is at an all time low today.  I am tired of so-called friends and loved ones judging me.  Yes, I don't have a job, but I am looking.  I am doing the best I can to try to find one.  But there isn't a lot I can do if no one is calling me.  I am too educated for some jobs, and not educated enough for most others.  So I'm stuck in the middle.  I'm a smart, skilled, kind, and honest woman left without a job.  Maybe if I hadn't followed the man to the middle of nowhere right after university ended I would have found something.  But a few years later, with no extra experience, no one in the big city wants to hire me.  And so... everyone thinks I am taking advantage of the man.  Yeah, he buys me things, like clothing and a new computer desk.  Wow.  I guess I'm supposed to go around in rags and we are supposed to keep using a sagging door on legs to hold the computers.  I will admit that buying the notebook for me was spoiling, as was the webcam.  But it's not like I'm walking around in fur coats, dripping with jewels, and living in a penthouse apartment.  We are very reasonable with our spending.  But I'm the villain--the poor girl living with the rich boy, taking him for all he is worth.  It doesn't matter that I do all the cooking, cleaning, and washing.  It doesn't matter that I try to take care of everything so that the man has nothing to worry about.  No one ever sees any of that.  All they know is that I've been out of work for two years, and they assume that I should have been able to find something by now.  I wish it were as simple as wanting a job and having it appear.   You know, I hate it when people talk about me.  I don't like it when the man says that he was talking to so-and-so and they were discussing me.  I don't want our "friends" to even ask the man how I am.  If they really care they can call or email me.  Otherwise, leave me alone!  They are all judging me because I am not working.  What if I didn't go back to work?  What if I never worked again?  Does that make me a bad person; am I taking advantage of the man?  I just want to keep to myself and I want everyone else to mind their own business.

      I love my man, I really do.  But sometimes I feel like as soon as he walks out the door he forgets about me.  Everything was good when we lived in that other city.  We didn't know anyone, so we spent all our time together.  Now that we are here, he spends so much time out with friends and doing courses for work.  I'm a homebody, and I feel neglected.  And, it doesn't help that he doesn't invite me to join him and our (yes, our) friends for lunch.  They all work, so they get together downtown to eat once in a while.  I don't work, but it isn't that hard for me to get there.  Why don't I get invited?  I'm not saying our relationship is falling apart.  That is far from the case.  We are both deeply in love, and we do like to spend time together. I guess I am just jealous that I don't have him to myself anymore.  And since I am very shy and don't have friends of my own, I really feel the lack.  I'm not sure what to do, since I'm actually fairly content not having a lot of friends.  I suppose I just wish that he would remember my feelings a little more and not spend five nights a week doing courses and playing sports with friends.

      I've decided to start a new blog, separate from my main blog, for several reasons.    First, my original blog (whose name I will not mention here) has achieved a small amount of popularity within its genre.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does make me feel like I must keep my entries to a certain them.  This can be limiting.  Secondly, my parents and my fiance read my main blog, so again I feel myself limited.   I want a place where I can work out what is bothering me, and who I am.  I know that it is possible to do this through a paper journal, but sometimes I feel more comfortable typing instead of writing.  And I like the format of blog software as opposed to unstructured journaling in word processing software.  I don't expect to get many hits or to develop a following.  Instead, I hope to discover myself, and hopefully to feel comfortable enough one day to link this blog with my main blog.

      Well, I made the mistake of posting about a personal stuggle on my main blog.  I wish I hadn't.  I'm not sure why I am evening bothering to post these personal things online.  I suppose it is because I can type so much faster then I can write, so I can get the thoughts out of my head more quickly.  But I wonder if I should share with anyone, including you, my Nonexistant Reader, these things that haunt me.    I am afraid of being a failure, and of disappointing everyone.  But I am more sure now then ever that the man loves me.  After all my breakdowns during the past two weeks, if he didn't truly care, he could have easily thrown me out.  Life will improve once I am back on meds.  I'm not really sick, or even crazy, I just have a little social phobia.  And that is hardly uncommon now.  I will eventually learn to deal with people again.

      I really hate a huge part of my life right now.  I feel like everything I do disappoints nearly everyone who is a part of my life.  I would really just like to be left alone.  I don't want to work at a job that I hate and can't stand the thought of going to after just three days.  I don't want to have to talk to people if I don't want to.  And most of all I don't want my actions to be judged by people who have very little to do with my life.    Right now I wish I could just walk away from everything.  Even the man.  I love him dearly, but I suspect he would be better off without me.  Money means a lot to him, and I will never be able to hold down a job.

      The man's sister works for MS, and she was going to pick up some games and accessories for an Xbox.  But I told the man that I didn't want the Xbox.  I really do want one though.  So, why did I do that?  Because I am sure that everyone thinks I am taking advantage of the man's money.  I'm not though.  He's got lots in the bank, and I would never dream of buying things like jewelery or furs or what-have-you.  I don't see what's wrong with the occasional book or video game or Tarot deck.  I really want a job.  I just can't find one.  I'm either too educated or not educated enough.  I'm a hard worker though.  And really, I want people to stop thinking poorly of me.  I need to make my own money.
