      I had my two hour sailing class on Friday and my four proteges could have used instruction in more than just water based activities. They didn't really want to listen to my sailing instruction and I had trouble organizing it in a cohesive way.  Watching these people mingle made me realize I need to either settle or give up by my late 30s, dating can not continue forever.

      This afternoon I am Captain of the Single's Cruise at a local marina. I have been asked to sail around some local singles while they mingle. I get paid for it. It's about a five person boat, so I am not sure what the deal is. How many can they possibly fit?  Unless they are kinky and looking for a three or four-some, it doesn't seem like a practical way to meet people. Not that I am anyone to judge. I just hope I don't get hit on. I will threaten to keel haul them if even one suggests he swab my poop deck. There is a guy who works on the deck down there who is perversely hot. He has skin that looks like leather, and when he once helped me out of the boat his hand felt like a monkey's, but he has this incredibly tanned thing going on. I don't want to get the first sexually transmitted melanoma, but as Captain of the single's cruise, I should have certain rights.

      So now I've decided to have this leg lengthening surgery and I wish I could have scheduled it for tomorrow. I'm absolutely incapable of starting anything that I'll be unable to complete before this planned 6 week hiatus from life.  I was in therapy yesterday discussing my recuperation time. My therapist seems to think its a bad idea for me to spend this period at my parent's house. I'm not sure how else I can afford the procedure, as insurance covers only 90% of my physical therapy, which will have to be daily, and Short term disability (STD) insurance, covers 60% of my income.  Couldn't they have come up with a better name for it? It sounds like I'm stuck at home with a particularly bad case of the clap. I can't figure out how to upload pics to this site. Maybe I'll figure that out later. I don't have anything relevant at the time anyway. Once the surgery has happened I should have some gory stuff. I'm really bored at work today. I did some internet searches and read another fascinating blog on blogspot about the newest Capitol Hill sex story - Washingtonienne. It's full of such wisdom as "A man who tries to fuck you in the ass when you are sober does not love you." Words to live by.  The new trend seems to be blogging about fucking. Blogging is really one of the most self absorbed thing one could embark on - assuming someone else wants to actually the minutae of our life. It is only natural that in an effort to gain attention and readers, fuck talk is becoming popular. I doubt there will be much of that for me this summer. Typically, every summer I fuck someone new. It's kind of a tradition. I don't know how many positions are going to be possible with a broken leg though.

      I have decided after 15 years to revisit this lousiest of childhood experiences, and have two even legs. I worry that I am looking for too much out of it.  I am afraid when I use the term "whole" accidentally to describe my post operative state. Surgery made me such a mess when I was little, maybe I would have been anyway, but it couldn't have helped. Now I want it fixed and I don't want to be thinking somewhere that it's going to fix ME. I like to make fun of the white trashy people on that tv show on Fox "The Swan" where they're all fucked up and compete to be the most pathetic who deserves a makeover. Like Queen for a Day but with a tit lift.

      I don't think I spelled inaugeral right but I am too lazy to look it up. It just doesn't look right.  Anyway, I am creating this blog in the hopes that anyone else who might be considering a similar procedure can learn from my experience. I have not found any blogs by folks undergoing similar experiences, and I hope to inform others, as well as review and organize my own thoughts and feelings in regard to leg lengthening and my experiences with it. This is going to be a little bit technical and a little bit personal.  I'll start out by setting the stage with a little bit of background. I have "Hemihypertrophy". What is this? Google says: Hemihypertrophy refers to the overgrowth (hypertrophy) of one side of the body. A person with hemihypertrophy will be found to have enlargement of the body on the affected side, so that the chest may be more full on the affected side as well as the arm and leg being longer and thicker in diameter.  Hemihypertrophy in infants and young children is important because such children have a much higher incidence of certain abdominal cancers, notably Wilm's tumor of the kidney and hepatoblastoma (liver cancer). Unequal leg length cause some walking difficulties as well.  Children with hemihypertrophy require careful periodic followup examinations to detect any early sign of malignancy. This followup must continue for a number of years.  Hemihypertrophy can be a familial trait or may occur sporadically.  In my case, it occured as a sporadic birth defect. No one knows why it happened. Sometimes, these things just do. I don't have any of the internal complications. The difference is not visible, you can't tell by looking at me that, say one of my eyes, or my breasts is bigger. My mom claims that she can tell that one of my eyes is bigger, and as for by breasts, I've never had any comments!  It was discovered that my right leg was longer when I was very young. I begin seeing an orthopaedic surgeon in nearby Boston, at the Floating Hospital, a children's hospital which began, curiously, on a boat. It's no longer aquatic and is now close to Chinatown.  They determined that the best strategy was to arrest the growth of my right leg. They did so by removing my growth plate with two operations at age 9 and 10. I was in the hospital for several days. I am a bit foggy on my memories of this, as I was young, scared, and not emotionally prepared for what I was undergoing. I don't remember the procedure, and I don't know if this is because I was never told exactly what was happening or because I have blocked it out.  My Dr., Dr. Michael Goldberg, did not have a manner which was appropriate for a pediatric surgeon. In my opinion, he should have stuck to the adults.  After the surgeries, I continued to grow taller than anticipated. I am still the shortest one in my immediate family at nearly 5'9".  My right leg stopped growing, but my left continued and surpassed it by 2.7 cm. This is approximately the discrepancy I had to begin with, only reversed.  Dr. Goldberg recommended I live with the difference and suggested I begin seeing another Dr. I think he did not want to be reminded of his error. There wasn't anything he could do for me at that point anyway. He was such a prick.  My new Dr. is doing this procedure: www.iskd.com  - it looks pretty gnarly but I've been promised a morphine drip. Hopefully there's a limit on that bad boy or I'll OD my first day in.
