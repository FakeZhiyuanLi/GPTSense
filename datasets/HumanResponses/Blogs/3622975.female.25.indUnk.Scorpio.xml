      Erin and i went to Daytona and no joke 30 minutes on the beach and the lighting started.  At least we went shopping and ate at a very good seafood restuarant. It was a very fun day!!!   Tomorrow is campppppppppp it will suck as usual but i have a better horoscope for tomorrow read about the arts!!    Today you are likely to be looking especially beautiful and sexy, darlene and are likely to be feeling particularly passionate. Communication with romantic partners, however, is likely to be blocked. Don't feel rejected. You'll be in the same space tomorrow, and you could get lucky then! Your interest in the arts is also high. Channel some of that passion into learning about them. It may not be the same, but it should do for now!

       Ahora quién si no soy yo Me miro y lloro en el espejo y me siento estúpido Ilógico, y luego te imagino toda regalando el olor de tu piel Tus besos, tu sonrisa eterna y hasta el alma en un beso En un beso va el alma Y en mi alma está el beso que pudo ser   What a great song !!! Went to the pool today with the boys. Got some sun and went to walmart to get some tubs for my pocketbook so fun.

       After fighthing with john and aaron aboutwhat movie to see! Garfield or the stepford wives. WE saw the stepford wives. It was quite good! Christ John thinks he knows everything!! It is about time to deflate his ego.   Friday I  was a gay taxi driver since aaron's car is still in the shop!! I have had this duty for the past three weeks.    I went to PF Changs with ERin and Joe! Joe was being a stresball. I had fun nonetheless.

        Yippee today is my friday then i don't work for the next five days. Isn't that great!   The WB superstars were so funny last night! Maybe i can win 100,000 for singing great. Damint! Why does it has to be to be the worst singer in the land         Horoscope time:  If someone insists on having things their own way, let them, darlene. Fighting over it is not going to do any good. This kind of reaction will only cause more tension between you. Approaching the situation with a hostile attitude will most likely result in a lose-lose scenario. If arguments do arise, try not to take things personally. Try your best to stick with the facts.     Looks Like someone is going to give me a problem today!! Lindsay wants to come down  and stay over but Joe has the most pressure filled week of his life and i really shouldn't have people over at all. What should i do??

But who knows what the boys were really thinking.  I almost got picked up  at Mcdonalds on my lunch break by two scary black men. HELLO doesn't anyone see the ring on my finger Christ!

       I don't want to go to camp tomorrow. I really don't. I want to enjoy my vacation. I need the extra money for the wedding by i really don't wanna go especially with what my horoscope says for tomorrow. HERE it is....   Light is being shed on cold hard facts that you may have been trying to avoid for quite some time, darlene. There is no sense trying to pretend that you do not see the truth that is staring you square in the face. Just because you may not want to accept what you see doesn't mean that you can carry on with the belief that it simply does not exist. This is one of those times when you must face the music, whether you like it or not.  From MSN HOROSCOPES:  WHY ME!!! I hope it doesn't really suck tomorrow . Or the truth will be that it will suck. I hate Mondays

         &nbsp;I went to downtown Orlando and it was crazy.&nbsp; Chruch street is loaded with hundreds of bars and clubs. I think I went to like 5 different places with no cover. That is an added bonus.&nbsp; I had   alot of fun with kristy and erin.&nbsp; Kristy and I were saying in the taxicab home&nbsp;that&nbsp;we are just too old for this and we are. I had a&nbsp; guy with a full load of gold metal teeth tell me&nbsp; in his drunkness that I was being mean . thenwe had a gay guy say how fab we all were. Funny night but i am glad to be getting married soon.&nbsp; IT was a long drive to good old sanford last night!! LOL

       What a boring Sunday!!&nbsp; I got the new marron 5 cd it is great !Apparently they came out of five towns college . That is a miracle considering how shady five towns is!!&nbsp; Nothing really new going on this weekend except for packing and doing stuff for our marriage preparation in the church. One question on our 200 question compablity test from the church was..... do you have homosexual tendencies? Strange the catholic church. School is&nbsp;almost two weeks ago and I am scared yet again of the upcoming new year. I hope that this year will be even more excellent than last year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Horoscope time......   Today you're likely to put a lot of energy into your romantic relationship, dear Scorpio. The astral energy is encouraging you to focus on romance. Consider giving your significant other a special gift to show how much you care, and spending time alone together. Any romance initiated or advanced today is likely to prove stable and long lasting, so don't let fear stand in your way. Move ahead!

       well it first started at the orlando aiport my welcoming to NY i mean.  A lady decided that she would just cut me for no apparent reason while there was no line. I was so mad I was like lady you suck!! I had three bags in oner of the bags was peanut so i had a heavy load to carry.   On the plane the flight attendant kindly told one gentleman to shut off his phone for departure. He replied i know you jack ass. Sweet huh. whnen we landed the plane rolled to the ground which in lamens terms was flying kind of unbalanced So i thought we where going to crash.    What else hmm... Joe didn't even know what flight I was on or plane cute huh!   ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!! I think i need anxiety medication i am actually sure i do. When my insurance is fixed i am going to the doctor in fl and get some.  Today will suck for sure! why can't NY be fun and not suck so badly.

       Of course Florida kept it's deal with a crazy thunderstorm, with rainbow at the same time 400pm and lasting till the evening.  My computer got hit with lighting which erased my entire hard drive.  So i wasn't too happy about that.  the only thing that made me happy yesterday was that i bought Gucci perfume and it smelled nice. I hope today is better but hell it is camp day how it it be.

       Happy soon to be the 4th of July. This week has been the most intense week of my little life. I am in the process of purchasing a home and planning my wedding. Talk about a freakin anxiety attack.  Joe and I are planning to move to Orlando hopefully in our first home. It is so exciting I hope everything works out.  I have a wonderful time with my parents and Anjelica.  I am still not to happy with Aaron he asks to many questions and it drives me nuts!!!!   he is dying to know if Joe has a job so that he can tell John. John is very competitive. GRRR. WELL LET THE MOVING PROCESS Begin out of this hell hole Sanford FL.
