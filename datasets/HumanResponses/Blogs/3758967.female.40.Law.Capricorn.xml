      "They" have decided that my husband's unofficial official last day with his unit will be next Monday (19JULY2004).  Now he'll come home ... go back to his civilian job for 2 1/2 months only to be called back October 1st to complete his military career ... which ends November 10, 2004.  What does that mean?  They screwed him out of being activated and have only had him on ADSW status ... screwed him out of going to war ... due to "policy" ... and have interrupted his civilian life for basically NOTHING.    My website has been posted on Congressman John Kline's website ... how appropriate.  Any guesses which committee Congressman Kline works for???  He's a member of the House Armed Services Committee ... a retired MARINE Colonel ... was the pilot of Marine One under President Ronald W. Reagan and LOVES Marines ... I'm thinking a little chat about the treatment my husband's received for his 30-years may be in order ...  In the words of Bill O'Reilly:  What say you?

      Such is life as I know it.  My husband leaves tonight for an undetermined amount of time ... could be a day ... could be a week ... ??  The good news is "they've" found a way to pay him for the work he's doing/done ... which is counter to yesterday's "word" of no pay.  I wouldn't mind so much ... all the back and forth "word," but this heat is making me a little cranky and I rather tire of the see-saw.  Doesn't anybody  CARE  that my husband has a family?  Doesn't anybody care that they're wreaking havoc on my nerves ... I think I only have one left ... and "they're" wearing it awfully thin.  I'm a reasonable person ... but really.  How much do "they" expect one USMC Wife and Mom to endure?  Is this some strange sort of Chinese torture?  Is this a test of my good nature?  Are "they" simply pushing to see at what point I'll push back?  In case you're wondering ... "they" know who "they" are ... and more importantly I know who "they" are!    "Thank you" to all of the brave men and women who have what it takes to defend this great nation I so much enjoy ... thank you for affording me the opportunity to speak my piece ... guaranteed by The First Amendment of the Constitution of The United States of America.  Margot out.

      So my husband's home ... a place he hasn't been in 12 days.  His unit is gearing up for deployment to that sand box in the east.  Bittersweet.  My husband wants to deploy ... to say he's desperate would be an understatement.  But alas he shan't be joining "his" Marines ... no, no.  He'll have to stay home with me and the little one.  Why?  Is he sick?  Nope ... excellent health.  Is he scared?  Nope ... can't think of anyone braver.  Did he pop positive on a piss test?  Nope ... he's straight and narrow.  Did he (get fired)?  Nope ... he's an OUTSTANDING Marine.  He runs First Class PFTs sans age waiver; holds expert in both pistol and rifle; is tan belt qualified; has experience in, but not limited to:  infantry, tanks, LAAD, 3rd ANGLICO, is a Jump Master ... LOVES the Marine Corps ... eats sleeps and breathes it.  His unit recently conducted a Change of Command, are short staffed a couple of 1st Sergeants and he's the last key person remaining that is familiar with the unit and it's Marines ... so what's the problem?  His 30-years will be up in October.  Yup.  During our Country's battle against terrorism ... during a time of WAR ... they won't extend this stellar Sergeant Major for SIX TINY MONTHS due to "policy."  Mind you ... said "policy" has been extended for others ... just not my husband.  Why?  Dunno.  Can't find one person who is able to break it down Barney style so even a lowly little wife like me can understand.  Why are some extended and others not?  Good question.  Why during a time of WAR would they even contemplate canning a 30-year Marine who is ready, willing, and able?  Who knows!  So ... if any of you have the answer ... please enlighten me.  Just be sure to explain it like I'm a six year old ... so I understand 'cause this shit don't make NO sense to me.  Margot out.

      WOW ... my very own blog.  I've made the huge leap from pen & paper to the Internet.    Alrighty then ... let's get down to business:  If you're looking for a place to spread liberal parroting, you've found the wrong blog.  I'm a Card-Carrying-Vast-Right-Wing-Conspiracy Operative, registered Republican who votes!  I'm a compassionate conservative who believes in God, the wife, mother, mother-in-law and aunt of United States Marines and a damn proud American.  Not much going on in my world at the moment ... time permitting I'll add more ... later.  Know in advance I'm under the influence of a very active TWO YEAR OLD BOY ... so if I sound "cranky" at times it could be due to sleep deprivation.  My bite is far worse than my bark ... so if you're ever feeling froggy LEAP.  I'm always up for a fight and stand foursquare behind my positions.  That said, have a nice day!

						      Saturday, July 17 2004 @ 10:29 AM CDTContributed by:      mpjoe13usa       It's been said that being a single parent is the toughest job on earth. Blending it with military service can make it tougher, but it also can bring out artistic ideas and solutions to balance the fine line between family and duty. Some commanders view single military parents as burdens to the unit. However, as there are more than 20,000 single parents registered in Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System it is important to tackle this issue. (Qualls) Sometimes single-parent soldiers have a difficult time being in the Army, due to the constant change in shifts, holding formations, and performing guard duty. Often soldiers are asked to perform a task that creates a longer work day, causing a stronger stressful time in individuals who are raising a child by themselves. What the military in general needs to provide is a support systems that deals with these situations and to make the chain of command understand the difficulties in being a single parent.    The current solution is to put single parents in groups such as the Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers organization, or a family support group. I don't diminish these organizations, but they are not equipped or trained enough to cope with the issues of being a single parent. As it stands, when soldiers in process at a unit, and receive the necessary information needed to begin there time in the unit there is no program single parents can turn to for support in their special needs. A large number of soldiers don't get the information and assistance they need. To be honest I believe that who is not a single parent leader also fails to fully understand the importance of these issues. Because of this the military is losing so many good soldiers, mostly due to the lack of support. One can not imagine the stress that a single parent has, between coping with stress, child support, time management, financial matters, caring for children with special needs and the lack of community resources. Time and time again I have been late for a formation because of the need to take my daughter to child care because of security checks at the front gate. This causes me to arrive a few minutes late. For now it is accepted by my chain of command but when it is crunch time there won’t be as much tolerance. The need for a support group that deals with these types of situations needs to be in place, because if the soldier has issues at home then those same issues are brought to work and at times can create a hazard in the work place.    I would like the Army to devise a single-parent-network group, so that a support system for soldiers can be offered for solutions to issues unique to single parenting in the military. This system would need to be built in a way so that other single parents can network with others in similar situations. Some commanders don't understand what it entails to be a single parent. Bringing a chain of command together with the single parent may provide a better realization by the entire work group in dealing with this type of issue.    If a group is organized so that a well rounded network is together, everyone can discuss concerns and propose solutions. In any job if the soldiers help each other, then missions can be better accomplished. Soldiers and their families should come first.  One of the issues brought to soldiers early in their carrier is dealing with family care plan packets and keeping it up to date, as it is a requirement for single parent soldiers. It's a list of instructions and agendas needing to be referred to in case of emergency or deployments. If you don't have a plan you can be involuntary released from service, and once again a good soldier is gone.&nbsp;    The plan contains financial allotments to fill out so that the designated provider can pick up the child, without any problem with payments. It is also included a power of attorney, so the selected provider can sign the child up for school, receiving immunizations or&nbsp; medical treatments, in absence caused by work, formations or deployment.(Family Care Plan)&nbsp; Once this packet is complete the unit commander, as well as the single-parent soldier approves the plan and the formality is done.    Now let’s see what really happens. The newly-arrived single-parent soldiers find it difficult to hurry and complete their family care plan packet because of the necessity of finding a local provider. Leaving your child with someone that is a stranger to both you and your child becomes a very hard situation. The unit would not like to see a stranger on your family care plan. "You have a short-term and a long-term provider designated in your plan. The short-term designate takes care of your child in the first 24 hours of the deployment or emergency until the long-term designate arrives to take the child. (Ebner). For example, the long-term designate might be in Maryland (as mine are) and there could be delays in flights or ticketing which could delay their arrival to get the child.    The family care plan could be activated at any time the Army needs you. Some single parents don’t have a network or relatives in the area. All of my family lives in Maryland so this leaves me with very few choices. With what is happening in the world today you just don't know what could happen or when and where you could deploy.    &nbsp;A military single parent was killed during the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon and her child was in day care. I don't know if she had a plan or not, but it is one example why you should keep and update your family-care plan. (Defending America. Index F)    Although I sacrificed time with my child to fulfill my military career I know my child will be safe. It is not possible to "have it all" but we all need to make a choice and make the best of a situation. I have a list of tips that I like to pass on to other single parent soldiers struggling to be successful:     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Always PAY your Child Care provider FIRST.&nbsp; Without their support you can't succeed.&nbsp; There will always be unexpected emergencies when you will need their services.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Find a Child Care provider that you trust, is reliable, and meets your needs, including drop-off, late pick-up, and long-term. When searching look for someone who may provide flexible hours, placing them in a home where it’s well rounded with family and friends.&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Never abuse Child Care services.&nbsp; Pick up your kids as soon as you get off work and keep them whenever you have a day off - Child Care providers need a break too.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Make it a point to meet other single parents willing to "take turns" instead of monetary payment for child care. Create an "extended family".     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Never use your status as a "single parent" as a crutch or an excuse to get out of work, assignments or deployments.&nbsp; Fulfilling all of your military obligations will ensure your success in the long-run and you will gain respect from your peers and superiors. &nbsp;I've had superiors who were surprised to learn that I was a single parent...I personally chose not to advertise this fact.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; In case of extended absence for military duty, ensure that your kids know the reason you have to leave, how long you will be gone and when you will return.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; Always remember the rule "Mission First". Do not abuse time-off from work because of your child.&nbsp; All children get sick, have routine doctor’s visits, and scheduled days off from school or school activities. If you cannot put your mission first, the military may not be your best career choice. You must seriously evaluate your particular circumstances. A friend considered his circumstances, the pros and cons, and determined that he could not place the mission before his child so he left the military at his ETS.&nbsp; He had a better support system back in his hometown and was able to find work that allowed time for the proper care of his child.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; Try not to feel guilty about leaving your child in the care of others while you work.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was my most difficult challenge.&nbsp; Most parents must work to provide for their families, so we all must sacrifice.     Being a single parent is a tough job and you will be pulling duties both as the mother and father. The everyday duties of work, cleaning, paying bills, taking care of my daughter and the dozens of other things that come with being in the military sometimes leave me feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. It is important for a single parent to be a positive role model for their child. As the only adult in the house, your attitude and behavior will make a big impact on the impressionable child. Some important factors in being a positive role model for your kids include spending quality time with them, establishing a family routine, and stability. Effective parenting is a learned skill. Joining a parent support group and/or finding parenting classes can help. (Muth)     Counseling is useful for stumbling blocks in family communication, grief, and other issues.&nbsp; Even a few sessions can often get a family on track together. Regardless of the parent’s gender, there is no greater gift to your child than a strong family and a loving, caring parent, be it Mom or Dad.

						     We have so much going on here at all the Keystone Military sites that our heads are spinning! In addition to our regular penpals and adoptions we are still doing our  Summer Picnic Boxes  for the troops. We are working with 1st Lt Eric Sloan to collect  Shoes for Iraqi Children  AND We are working with the  Iraq War Veterans Organization  to put together a Memorial Day Concert to Support Our Troops and Veterans as well as begin work on an Iraq War Veteran's Memorial. These vets will not have to wait 30, 40 or 50 years to be remembered. With that said let's get right to the information  you  need to help!    The following article appeared in the Associated Press a couple weeks ago and Keystone Soldiers contacted 1stLt Sloan about helping him with his project. He has been moved to a new location and has a whole new group of kids that could really use our help!     (Abbottstown-AP) -- A Pennsylvania National Guard member serving in Iraq doesn't just ask for cookies in his care packages from home -- he wants shoes, too. Reading-area resident 1st Lieutenant Eric Sloan asks for the shoes, preferably sandals, for the hundreds of children he sees walking barefoot through the rubble in temperatures topping 100 degrees.    Sloan's aunt, Dottie Stonesifer of Abbottstown in Adams County, has been scouring yard sales to fill her nephew's shoe order. Stonesifer has collected nearly 100 pairs of shoes -- three boxes of sandals and sneakers. (Copyright 2004 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)     As a mother I know how fast kids outgrow shoes and how frustrating it was to have to throw away perfectly good shoes that just didn't fit any more. Here is a great way to help some kids who really need it and help build some bridges that show America does care. Children are always the innocent victims of any war.    You can help by sending your new or good used shoes to us at:  Keystone Soldiers, PO Box 152 Fleetwood, Pa 19522  or if you are shipping by UPS or FedEx please contact us for the street address.  You can also collect the shoes and ship them directly  to 1stLt Sloan. We will send you the mailing address for shipping  BUT  you must send us your  full name, mailing address, and phone number.  We will follow the same guidelines as penpal and adoption approval before we release any information. Please understand that the security of our troops is still our first concern.    A couple of months ago we were approached by  Russell Terry  of the  Iraq War Veterans Organization  about the possibility of co-sponsoring a to help raise the awareness of the issues surrounding our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and to raise some funds to help him get his 501 classification. My first response was to say "Let me think about this" since we here at Keystone had such a bad experience the last time we were asked for our "help". The more I talked to Russ the more I realized that this is not the same and would not be the same type of problem at all. So we are officially working together to put together this concert for Memorial Day 2005 to Support our Troops and Veterans.    We have hit some roadblocks along the way so far. Since Russ is on the west coast and I am on the east coast it is tough to just pick up the phone and call every time one of us gets an idea or a response to an email or letter. We also do not have a west coast producer who is willing to work for a small percentage so that the money raised actually goes to the troops and veterans instead of some toward a bigger pool in someones yard or a bigger house or faster car! Somehow the idea of 'it's all about the troops' gets lost when music companies and managers and producers get involved.    That being said we are looking for sponsors for this concert to offset some of these costs and are even willing to discuss the possibility of televising the concert nationally if it helps to make it happen! Anyone interested in helping can contact Russ at:  webmaster@iwvo.com  or send an email to us and we will forward it to him.    Don't forget you can still sponsor a  Picnic Box  Care Package for $25.00 to one of our troops or to someone you know. We will include a gift card from the donor with your name and address so the recipient can contact you to say thanks.  Just click on the PayPal button on the left side of the main page  at  urlLink www.keystonesoldiers.com  and in the additional information space let us know it is for the Picnic Box. You may also add a personal message there.    If you would like to make a  postage donation  please click on the PayPal button on the left side of the front page at  urlLink www.keystonesoldiers.com  or  urlLink www.keystonemarines.com  and put Postage Donation in the information space at PayPal. Every care package costs between $12.00 and $20.00 to ship to Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Korea, Bosnia or Kuwait. There is always a need for postage for care packages at all times of the year.    Don't forget....the  Curve's Challenge  is still going on and the information is posted on the front page.  Fashion Week Philadelphia  is next week and  Shallyn  will be unveiling the new sand scarves she is donating for our care packages.    Whew! Looks like we better get busy with all this work to do!    ~Keystone

						      This letter is reprinted with the permission of www.healingfield.org. I also have to warn you that this letter is very emotional. I wanted to show how important something like the Healing Field can be.  I hope some of you will plan on attending the Healing Field in Hanover, Pa between September 10th and September 12th.      October 29, 2003   To the Healing Field,    Some of you may remember me and others may never of met me, but I had to write and say thank you for all you had done for me. I am a soldier in the Army Reserve, currently serving in Iraq with the 200th MED DET out of SLC, UT.    In September, I had the luck of the draw to be able to come home for a little R&R. I left Iraq on September 11th, flew into Kuwait, and was finally on my way home September 12th. I arrived in SLC, UT approximately 1130pm that same day. By the time I arrived I was suffering sever jet-lag and was ready to start a new day. I was excited and nervous to see my family for the first time after 6 months of combat, I wasn't sure how they were going to respond. I wasn't sure how I was going to respond. When I saw them waiting at the bottom of the stairs my heart filled with joy and my eyes with tears. It was an overwhelming and emotional reunion. I didn't have the opportunity to travel in uniform, so no one recognized me as a soldier. To any outsider looking in, our reunion may have looked a little dramatic. While I walked through the airport, still overwhelmed by the hugs and kisses of my family, I started to ask myself loads of questions. have people forgotten about us? What does the media say about the troops in Iraq? Do people know there is still a war being faught and soldiers are still falling? I was really afraid of what the reality may have been concerning this situation. When we had left the airport my mother told me she had something she wanted to show me. She told me there was a field put up of flags to remember those who have died during 9/11. I thought it was going to be cool to see; I had no idea. When we pulled into the parking lot, west of the flags, my eyes were as round as quarters. It was amazing! I was purely shocked at the number of flags that had been placed in rememberance of those who lost their lives. It was a beautiful sight. We started to walk through them, just letting the breeze blow the flag so it ever so lightly touches your skin as you pass. This was an experience I was never going to forget. While we were out walking through the flags we were approached by some kind young boys, part of a local scout troop. They were nice enough to help us out and tell us the story behind the field and any other interesting facts about it. They spoke of a field on the side set up special for fallen troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11. I asked if the names of these soldiers were posted on the flags. They told me they were, so I asked them to help me find a special individual. We spent an hour reading the names of every flag until we found my dear friend, SPC Paul T. Nakamura. When they found his name tears rolled down my cheek and I knew we had not been forgotten and neither has he. Paul was a close friend of mine, long before the war even started. We spoke on the phone weekly, keeping each other up to date on when we may possibly be deployed. He was activated before I was and I was afraid I wasn't going to see him or hear from him for a very long time. About a month later I was activated and stationed in Kuwait. It took us several weeks to finally set in. About a month down the road I was wondering the office buildings and stumbled across the 437th ambulance crew, Paul's group. I was so extatic to know we were in the same place together. I spent days looking for Paul and finally found him. We were thrilled to know and have someone we loved near by. It makes it easier to be here when there is someone you can talk to or even cry on their shoulder. Paul was my someone. Paul was killed June 19, 2003 when his ambulance was hit by an RPG. I was on another mission at the time in Basara, Iraq when it had occured. I didn't find out until I returned to Kuwait and saw his name written on the side of all ground ambulances. They all read, "In memory of SGT Paul Nakamura, forever a hero". When I saw this it killed me inside. It didn't seem real until the memorial service. It was then I knew he was gone. My mother and I spent several hours walking through the fields, talking with the scouts. They were so kind and helpful. They told me I could come back the next day and buy Pauls flag. I couldn't pass it up. I returned the next day and purchased Paul's flag. This time I brought back photo's of Paul to hang on his flag. Then everyone could see the face behind the name. While I was hanging the picture, I ran into a MSG Lewis. He and MSG T. invited me to come back and help with the retiring of the flags. I was more than happy. I returned again the next day, just because the field was a big reminder that we haven't been forgotten. This time I spoke with the lady I bought the flag from and she asked if I was the soldier the scouts were taking about the other night. Yes, I was. She then gave me the twenty dollars back I had purchased Paul's flag with and told me I didn't have to pay for a friend. She brought tears to my eyes. The night finally came to retire the flags. MSG Lewis had set it up so I would be the one to take down Paul Nakamura's flag. I did okay most the night, but when I got to Paul's, I couldn't hold back. They handed me the card, which read his name, and I turned around to go grab it. I stopped in front of his flag and tears were streaming down my face as I raised my hand to salute him and all he has done for me and this country. I picked up his flag and walked it down to another soldier who I passed it off to, so it sould be rolled up and presented to my mother. When I passed the flag onto him I saluted it once more. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw MSG T. salute as well and the line of soldiers behind me snapped to attention. This meant more to me than words can say. It was very emotional, and to all those watching, I think they had a small understanding. I just want to say my trip home was made well worth it due to the respect, support, love and friendship you all had shown me. I was able to return to Iraq and let all those who wonder if we have been forgotten, that we haven't. People back home are doing their best to make sure we are honored, respected, and NEVER forgotten.    Thank You for making it the best trip home for me!!!!

						      TechSpun®  has teamed up with Keystone Soldiers to get the best socks and gloves to our troops at a very special price!    Even though the Troops are provided with socks when they enter the military, socks are considered a personal item (like underwear) and they are not reissued; therefore, and all replacements must be purchased by the individual soldier or his/her family. Inexpensive socks neither last, nor perform to the demanding requirements necessary under extreme environmental weather conditions, and can cause blisters, chafing, hot/cold sweaty feet that create severe and debilitating foot problems for our fighting men and women.    Have you ever seen what happens to our troops feet from the heat and the sand? The photo below will give you some idea!       You can donate for shipment to the Keystone Soldiers Center for general distribution or, if you have adopted a soldier, you can send the TechSpun® Sock and Glove System directly to your soldier.     For anyone who donates 2 sets of the TechSpun socks and gloves to us for distribution we will also send a care package to one of our troops in your name. This will include the TechSpun products and all our normal care package items with a hand signed card from the donor.     As always....thanks for your support!      ~Lordzmom

						     Imagine a sea of red white and blue, over a thousand American and foreign flags standing eight foot tall in perfect rows and columns across a field of green. The visual effect will be one of infinity. The sacrifice and memory becomes real and tangible when you see this breathtaking display.      The Soldier's Coalition Healing Field will be on display in Codorus State Park to honor those heroes.  This event is free to the public and sponsored by the Exchange Club of Hanover.       The Soldier's Coalition Healing Field  in Hanover Pennsylvania will stand in honor and memory of those heroes who are sacrificing their lives for the cause of freedom.

						       After receiving the following letter from one of our troops we realized how important it is for them to have someone to talk to that understands what they are experiencing. Please read the letter and then find out what you can do to help.     Dear Keystone folks,         Want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for finding a pen/email pal  for me here in Iraq.  It gets tough here at times and it is good to chat with a veteran that has been through a lot.  Some things I can't share with family or friends back home because they won't understand.  Guys here just say deal with it!! So you folks are a life saver as far as I am concerned.  I would personally recommend that any deployed soldier that is having problems or just needs to vent or share, maybe you have a limited family contact or none.  Keystone folks do it right!!   Keep up the good work.  I look forward to getting involved with your organization when I finish this deployment to help a soldier.     Soldiers First,     A Soldier @ FOB Speicher       We are looking for combat veterans to help those currently serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. We want to have a network of combat veterans in place for those who reach out for support. We sincerely believe that if more of our troops today have someone who has "been there, done that" so to speak that they can talk to we can help them to overcome some of the stress that is the start of PTSD. They need someone who understands the situations, and usually only those who have seen combat can fully realize the things these troops cannot discuss with their families and friends.     If you know any veterans who might be interested in helping some of today's troops minimize the effects of PTSD by communicating via email or snail mail with one (or several) currently deployed troops please have them send us their information. We need full name, mailing address and phone number emailed to:  veterans@keystonesoldiers.com  or snail mailed to  Keystone Soldiers PO Box 152 Fleetwood, Pa 19522.   Please put Veterans in the subject line of your email so we can process your information right away. Your information is confidential and is only for our files. We do not sell it and will not send you spam.  We welcome veterans from any combat era. This is not limited to Iraq war veterans.        If you are a soldier, sailor or marine looking for a combat veteran to talk to please contact us at the same address and put Veteran Wanted in the subject line of your email.  Please let us know if you would like to be contacted by email or snail mail or both. We do not give out email information unless we have your permission to do so. We promise we will get you set up with someone to talk to as quickly as possible.  ALL  your information is confidential and will  NOT  be given to anyone other than your combat veteran.     If you have any questions about this program please feel free to contact us at: keystone@keystonesoldiers.com     Stay safe!      ~Lordzmom

						     Keystone Note**...We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Quietside/Samsung, Yellow Freight and Jose from Landstar Express - SFO for their generosity and assistance in making this happen! Thank you ALL!          Yellow Transportation shipping manager Brian Fisher prepares pallets of air conditioners for shipment to Iraq. (Wally Shank/The Sentinel)      By Tatiana Zarnowski, August 8, 2004    Spc. Andy Mahoney of Mt. Holly Springs knows first hand what it's like to work in 115 degrees in the shade.    So when his mother, Judy Mahoney of South Middleton Township, mentioned the business where her friend Denis Dumm works had 50 extra window air conditioners to donate to troops in Iraq, Mahoney passed along the information to his sergeant.   In about three weeks, the air conditioners will cool an aviation support battalion's office and trailers where soldiers live.  Although the units will cool the indoor air only to about 90 degrees during the peak of summer, that still will be a relief to soldiers who have been living in the 10-by-10-foot "ovens" where the temperature can skyrocket to well over 100 degrees.  "They'll be able to get sleep; they'll be able to get a little more functional," says Kyle Lord, executive director for Keystone Soldiers, a non-profit organization based in Fleetwood, Berks County, that sends care packages to soldiers stationed in Iraq.  The soldiers working in the hangar need to stay cool, Lord says. "If they can't see what they're doing because the sweat is running down their faces into their eyes, that could be pretty dangerous."  Dumm coordinated the shipment through Lord, who says the battalion, which she could not name for security reasons, is "comprised largely of Pennsylvania soldiers."   Packages appreciated         Spc. Andy Mahoney has been serving in Iraq as an engineer for five months. He is home on a two-week leave, but will be heading back to the heat soon. (Photo courtesy Andy Mahoney)     It's not Mahoney's Army Reserve unit. The 25-year-old lives in new barracks in Iraq, where he has been serving as an engineer for five months.  "We got lucky," says Mahoney, who is on a two-week leave and was on hand Thursday at Quietside with his wife, Crystal, and their two sons, Ryan, 4, and Austin, 1.  The 1997 Big Spring High School graduate works at Giant distribution center.  Mahoney says he has received care packages from the Cumberland Valley High School Key Club and from other people he doesn't even know. "I don't know how they get my name, but they do," he says.  His mother is "ecstatic" to have her son home, she says.  She sends him homemade cookies in care packages that arrive within 10 days. "He says the cookies are still pretty good when they get there."  On Thursday Yellow Transportation trucked the units from Quietside in Middlesex Township to the Port of Philadelphia, where the container will be loaded onto a ship.  When it arrives in Kuwait, everything will be inspected before the air conditioners go to Iraq, Lord says.  The units were extra inventory the company didn't have room to stock, says Dumm, technical support adviser for Quietside. "My boss was actually just going to give them away to our wholesalers."  Instead they decided to give the brand new appliances to troops in Iraq. About 300 more units from another company will join the first ones in the next two weeks, Lord says.    FYI   People can add local soldiers to Keystone Soldiers' care package list or pen pal list by visiting www.KeystoneSoldiers.com.  The non-profit organization also accepts donations for postage to send packages to troops.   http://www.cumberlink.com/articles/2004/08/08/news/news03.txt

						     You have absolutely got to read the article at the Beacon. This is the site that published the photos of the being baptized in Fallujah during some of the worst of the fighting.     The new article you have to read for yourself.    The Beacon       I wanted to post an excerpt here but since I have not asked permission from Tim Curlee (the owner of the Beacon) I will just let you go there and read the article in it's entirety. I will warn you to take the tissues with you!      ~Keystone
