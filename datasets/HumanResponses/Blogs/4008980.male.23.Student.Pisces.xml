      Now Playing: Move Your Feet by Junior Senior  I've never used the snooze button. I don't even know where it is. Does no one else just not reset their alarm when they want to sleep more? I keep hearing people say "Yah, I hit the snooze button at least three times this morning!" Yah, I don't care. Whoever invented that button was a bastard. One more way to give people the easy way out.   Back in my day, I remember when I woke up by the rooster's crowing at&nbsp;4:30 in the mornin', and I had to trudge 3 miles uphill in the snow with only my open-toed leather moccasins on my feet to shoot&nbsp;that thing&nbsp;in the head to shut it up.   Breakfast.&nbsp; With a side of toast. White bread. Wheat tastes like dirt baked into bread form.  Time for work.

      Now Playing: Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands by Elliott Smith (RIP)  I'm not even sure exactly who reads these things. Whoever is out there that does that probably isn't reading this anyway, so I'll just type to myself for awhile. After things get weird, people will come. They'll be weirded out, and leave again. This is how it usually happens, in bloglife or not.  If you are reading this, I have no idea how you got here. Congratulations on finding this. I hope it helps you kill 3-4 minutes out of your busy, busy day. If I've done that for one person, I will stamp this venture a success. This will make my life not a complete failure.   I'm joking, children.  My life is&nbsp;&nbsp;already there.  I have nothing more to say right now, except go listen to some Wilco. Buy their music. I'm a pimp.  &nbsp;

      Now Playing: The National Anthem by Radiohead   I was watching the Democratic National Convention this evening, and more specifically, I was watching John Kerry speak. (If I keep up with this blog long enough, you'll realize that I'm pretty far left on the political spectrum, so when I vote, I'll vote John Kerry.) I had half forgot about the speech, though to my luck, one of my channel-surfing-happy roommates went to CSPAN, and I told him to hold on for a minute and watch.   About 15 minutes later, we were still watching. I thought the speech was pretty interesting, if not moving or terribly informative. The other three people watching the TV:   My roommate who flipped to the channel was only still watching because he felt the urge to giggle at everything Kerry said, like it was all ironic and politically satiristic without realizing that it was. I didn't even get what he was talking about when he crack jokes. Kerry would say something about job loss or inflation, to which the roomie would exclaim, "Haha, like he's going to fix anything. He's a goofball. Look at his hair! All politicians are dumbasses."   Roommate number two was staring at his laptop, looking at scantily-clad women or something, occasionally uttering a disgusted sigh at the proceedings on the TV. "Why in the HELL are we watching this? Isn't there anything BETTER on? Hey, look at this chick's ass."   Roommate number three (we shall call him "The Libertarian") walked in a little late, and before he even&nbsp;made his way into the&nbsp;room, he blurted out something to the effect of: "That dill-hole Kerry, what the shit does he know about anything. What a cocksucker. What the hell does it matter what he says?" He repeated this every few minutes.   My favorite retort from&nbsp;The Libertarian&nbsp;was about Kerry's&nbsp;claim that America is dependent on foreign oil. The Libertarian: "No we aren't!!!" What? If we only used US produced oil,&nbsp;automotive gasoline prices&nbsp;alone would go through the roof. We simply don't have enough oil reserves to keep up with demand. Not that he was able to grasp Kerry's overlying point about alternative energy sources anyway.   However, my main point here is not about oil, or about my wide array of political differences with The Libertarian. In fact, I'd like my other two roommates to have the sort of vigor of belief that The Libertarian has (even though he's completely wrong! *rimshot*). Roommate number one doesn't care because the complexities of the political system have pushed him away. He's never been one to be especially political in the first place, but when a lot of politicians are saying the same thing or not much at all, it's hard to cut through it, and most people don't even want to try to cut through it. Roommate number two doesn't care because he's apathetic, which is both his fault and the fault of the democratic system to inspire him. This is an even more serious problem that roommate number one's.   A lot of people talk about the fault line between left and right wing, but I think the bigger problem is that of the fault line between voter and non-voter. Political parties and newspapers do not make the understanding of politics or the democratic process easy to understand. Sometimes people need to be spoonfed information until they are ready to take larger bites. About all you can get nowadays is large bites, and even with all the political fervor, it wouldn't surprise me to see lower voter turnout than in the last presidential election.   The political party that finally figueres out how to connect with non-voters and non-politicos will win lots of elections. The American people want things that they can understand easily, something that won't interfere with their work day or their free time. I just hope it's a party whom I favor that figueres this out, or a lot of liberals are in for a long, tough ride.

      Now Playing (later that album): Lapsis by Bluetile Lounge  I'd like to, er, congratulate Sidmouthian for making the first comment on this blog, ever. It'll also probably be the last comment, because I'm telling both of you who read this that this is the last post I'm making solely dedicated to one comment on one of my other posts. So there's no reason to comment anymore. None!  Unless you want to make me feel loved.   Love me!  The both of you that read this are now officially weirded out. Scroll down to the original post to see what that means.  Cheers to the other side of the Atlantic. I'm international, baby.

        Now Playing: Hiding&nbsp;To Crash by Bluetile Lounge     &nbsp;   "I don’t know but I’ve been told  The devil’s only bought not sold  He’ll stand out all night in the cold  And deal you cards to watch you fold  Make you smile when you are sick  Until you need more to get your fix  He’ll take you down and take you quick  And hang you up like a telephone click  The best idea’s not to pay attention  And just sell your soul come next election" &nbsp;   I wrote that, and I don't know what it  means. Any help?  It was part of some lyrics I wrote when I was going through a very neo-political phase about a year and a half ago after the whole Iraq thing boiled over. I get kind of edgy when I see some of the stuff that I wrote because:   a) (self-politely) It needs work;   b)&nbsp;It makes me realize how much I truly hated what Bush was doing to our country. I'm no fan of Bush still, and if he wins again I might move to Canada, but if little me is any indication of the large political divide, then the divide is a chasm.   More to come on this topic later in the evening.

      Now Playing: Stop Your Crying by Spiritualized  There's this person that I work with who asks me the same question everytime she spots me:  "So... how are you today?"  It's not that I dislike the question in and of itself, it's just that when you are asked that repeated times per day (sometimes by the same person), it gets old. My life is not an open diary in which I prostrate myself before the masses and cry out that I am feeling well. Or feeling sad. Or feeling a bad case of indigestion coming on, which I am right now. (And you didn't even have to ask!)  I don't claim to be a very private person, but I'm tired of telling other people how I'm doing. If they can't figure it out by other signs, that's too bad. Should a person really&nbsp;say how they are feeling? Isn't that making it too easy for other people to figure out the rich, complex labryinths of emotion that humans are? Can we really explain what we are feeling at any given point durng the day? And even if we can, does it matter? Won't we feel something different in a few short moments?  Whenever this particular person whom I work with asks me the question, I flash to the scene in American Beauty where the hot girl next door asks the studly and soon-to-be-doomed dad how he's feeling. This is not because the girl is hot or because I feel particularly studly or doomed, but because of the father's response to the question. He is delighted that the question was asked. He bemoaned that no one had asked him the question for quite some time.   Within minutes of the question being posed, he's dead. I'm not sure that it was the writer's intention to insinuate that there is a connection between an exposition of the soul and expulsion of the soul, but that's the connection I always make. If someone else really knew how you were feeling (leaving God of the equation at present), what would be the point to existence? There would be&nbsp;no more mystery to life, and I believe that the mystery is the reason to exist.   Next time that the girl asks me this question, I think I'll just tell her about how I feel some irritable bowel syndrome coming on, and that's it is best if she left the room.

      Now Playing: Stolen Car by Beth Orton   Giving a shout-out to both people that have come and visited the blog so far. You are brave souls, traversing deep seas of blog bullcrap to get to this special blog bullcrap. Bless you.   Before I get to my main point, I want to wish my congratulations to the newly married couple whose wedding I attended last weekend. It was a beautiful ceremony made better by the fact that it was overwith in 20 minutes. There was an open bar at the wedding, and the bride's dad was walking around with pitchers of MGD. Classy. My only complaint was that the purple-hi-i'm-21 wristband left some goo on the cuff my my shirt that isn't coming off. It's the price you pay for free booze. There is always a hitch.   I just got done watching the movie "Kids." For those of you that have seen it, ask yourselves, "What makes me want to keep watching that movie?" For those of you who answered the previous question with anything perverted, you're a horrible person and you are going to burn in hell. For those of you that haven't seen it, one in every four-five&nbsp; hipster movie buffs own it, so take it from them and&nbsp;watch it. Forewarning: It is not for the faint of heart, or easily put off by graphic anything. And if you can't listen to swearing, you won't make it more than a few seconds into the movie.   It is a morosely disturbing tale of teenage love, sex, drugs, and AIDS. I'm pretty sure it was made by a dirty old man, but regardless, it is one of the most explicit movies that is available for viewing in the US that you can't find at Captain Pete's $8.99 Porno Shack. It's also one of the more heartbreaking movies I own, and not to ruin the ending, but it also serves as a backwards type of anti-teen sex morality tale. It also stars the suberb and underused Chloe Sevigny. If you only watch mainstream stuff, chances are the only time you've seen her was in the supporting role to Hilary Swank in the gender-confusion dramography Boys Don't Cry.   I recommend "Kids" for anyone, but especially mature kids in the 14-18 age range, especially those becoming sexually active. If this doesn't scare you, nothing will.   Now that this PSA is overwith...

      Now Playing: Aside by The Weakerthans  I have to apologize - my last post was not about cheese, as promised. It was about some music site that ya'll should go check out if you haven't so you can bitch about its content when you start reading it everyday.  So, I was talking to a coworker about cheese on Monday, and I was shocked to learn that he thought Velveeta was cheese. He also assumed American Cheese was cheese. People nowadays, I tells ya. I had to give him a five minute discourse on why a "pasteurized cheese product" is not cheese, and furthermore, why any cheese made at a factory that employs more than 30-40 people is also likely not cheese.  While cheese by name, store brand cheese (such as colby and "medium" cheddar) tastes like nothing. I grew up in the middle of dairy country, and was appalled when I moved to a big city at the blandness of the cheese. You could go to the store and buy me a pound of store-brand colby, a pound of store-brand cheddar, and a pound of store-brand monterey jack, bring it to me, and I'd throw it at your face. And knock you over. And spit on you. And call your grandma the town whore. I'd then pick it up (the cheese), eat it, and not be able to tell which was which. That stuff tastes like nothing.  Real cheddar cheese is: a)aged for at least one year, preferably 3 or more years b)not "mushy" - you shouldn't be able to bend it like dough c)not easily cut - it could break off into chunks and crumble when cut with a dull blade d)dark yellow, not light yellow e)slightly bitter and full of richness, not... bland and textureless  If you've been eating flavorless cheese all your life, do something about it. It's not too late for your. Do yourself a favor (I can only speak for the USA about this one) - go to a local cheese store or specialty food store. Buy yourself one pound of cheddar cheese that has been aged for 1-2 years. Ween yourself in on this stuff. After you've absorbed that, go and buy something a little older, like 3-4 year old cheddar. If you enjoy this, you'll never go back to store-brand feux-cheese.  After you've eaten the cheddar, try some new cheeses. Try some "salad" cheeses like feta, gorgonzola, or bleu. Try some of the more bitter cheeses like muenster or limberger. Finally, reward yourself with some brie or some asiago.  You'll be a better person for it, and you'll gain that weight you always wanted to.  Cheers.

       urlLink Pitchfork   I'd like to give a brief shout-out (while I remember) to one of the best musical-review sites on the internet. They are so good, they even started reviewing stuff other than pompous indie crap!  Seriously, go to this site and learn yourself something.   This post courtesy of my google toolbar, which has a blogger button.

      Now Playing: Cups by Underworld  I apologize for making this blog too political in its infancy. I love a good political rant or debate, but I'm really not all about that. Really. My one reader may be disapointed, but this post isn't going to be about politics.  In fact, I don't know what it is going to be about... gimme a minute to conjure up something.  Well, maybe it wil be about politics. Sort of.  Here in the Twin Cities (that's in Minnesota, USA, sid), a bunch of the local governments have passed or are waiting to pass smoking bans. To this, I say boo. I'll admit to being an occasional smoker. It's relaxing after a tough day of work, and it seems to fit while throwing back a couple drinks with friends at the local bar. I know it is bad for me, but lots of things can kill you. Everyone has a timeline. I'm not saying that anyone should be subjected to secondhand smoke if they don't want to be. The right to breathe clean air is a civil liberty. However, the right to go to a bar and smoke is also a civil liberty.  Like many things, secondhand smoke is fairly easy to avoid if you want to avoid it. If you don't want to eat french fries, you don't go to McDonalds. If you don't want to get mugged, you don't drop by the ghetto at 3 a.m. If you don't want to lose all your money, you don't invest in Enron. If you don't want to deal with secondhand smoke, you don't sit in the smoking section, or you don't go to the bar. The no-smoking thing at bars really kills me - it's like saying OK to killing your liver and drinking and driving, but that secondhand smoke... no way, man.  Minnesota recently caught up with the rest of the world when they extended their bar-closing hours from 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. Now, the later closing time seems to have been a kiss on the cheek while local governments were preparing a kick to the groin.  You know the old saying "one step forward, two steps back"? Well...  I have more to say, but the words are eluding me this evening. My next post will be about cheese, I promise you all this.

      Now Playing: All The Saints by Verbena   urlLink http://graphics.jsonline.com/graphics/sports/buck/img/aug04/james805.jpg   The above is a link to a picture I was just looking at while browsing a paper from my homeland of Wisconsin. The picture itself doesn't mean a whole lot to me. It's a picture of Mike James and his daughter at a press conference announcing the player's signing with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks.  Go Bucks. They rule, and stuff.  What struck me was the background. I've seen the Bucks' logo a million times, but for some reason, the purple and green set against a background of black with a luminesence to it really reminded me of one of my favorite childhood places. If anyone had been looking at me at this moment, they would have found a really odd portrait of me looking in child-like wonder at a picture of a newly-signed basketball player.  The Oshkosh, Wisconsin Public Museum is not one of the best museums on the face of the earth. I haven't been there for the better part of ten years, and the last time I was there they were remodeling. My grandmother was a member of the museum's hierarchy is some form another, so I went fairly often when I was young, and there's always been this one part that's stood out in my mind for the longest time.  On the second floor, coming down an old oaken staircase from the third floor, sat a collection of old stained glass. The glass in itself was not especially important. What was striking was the surrounding lighting, which created what I now know more as a rave-ish atmosphere of crystal and glass, backlit and shown through with shades of greens and purples and oranges and reds. Not particularly historically interesting. Brilliant to look at, especially looking back at it.  Every once in awhile, I'll remember something like this from something long lost that I'm likely never to see again. It makes me sad, in a way, but also happy that I remembered it.  Little things spark it, like a picture, or a smell, or a feeling.  I don't like to romanticize the past because dwelling there is unwise, as I've been told many times.  I do think it is good to learn from history (especially one's own), and I wish I did more of it. I'm not saying that I could learn anything directly from this memory - it's just cool looking stained glass. I don't even know if it is still there. What I am saying is that, for both of my readers, if you remember something like this that you cherish, or wish you cherished, try and hang on to a little piece of it. It'll be worth it, because you'll never know when you'll need it or want to hang on to a little piece of what used to be you.  I have lots of memories from my hometown of Oshkosh, and that museum is a pretty big part of it. I regret not going there when I've been back, and will make a point of it next time. I'm lucky because I might be able to reconnect with this memory. Sadly, that's not always possible.
