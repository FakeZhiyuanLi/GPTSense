      School Holiday coming up, so I thought it would be nice for my babies to see their grandmother (and nice for me to have the house to myself...).  Not the easiest thing to arrange, given that we only communicate by text message, but I asked her anyway - 'U wnt c kds 4 hols?'  And she says yes, she will for a few days, despite current illnesses, appointments, and general malaise, if it will help me out.  That is so not the point!  I just thought it would be nice, for her, as she often complains that she has missed so much of their growing up, and that she is not close to them.  But that would amount to her wanting something, which is unacceptable, as oppose to me needing something, which she can deal with.  Some are born grandmothers, it appears, and some have grandchildren thrust upon them.

      Number 2 daughter went to a friends house, so son and I toddled off to do what he likes to do - go to PC World, Gamezone, Dixons, anywhere he can get a multimedia hit.  Today was PC World, about 10 miles away.  We get in the car, and Alanis is in the CD.   'Do we have to listen to this?  We've had it for days..' he whined.   'Ok.  Put Courtney on instead.'  So grudgingly he slips America's Sweetheart into the player, and mum starts to sing.  Ok, so not always the right words, but singing none-the-less.  And son sits there, dreaming of shooting people with an mp40, or something of that ilk. And finally I get to my point.  Is all this angry woman music bad for the boy?  What am I turning him into?  Passive-aggressive woman hater?  Queer?  Post-feminist new man?  Or just a well-rounded music fan?   I don't know.  I'll leave that one to his therapist to figure out.  p.s. we bought the C.S.I pc game.  Ok, so it has dead bodies, but at least he didn't shoot them.

      Aargh.  Sunday evening descended into a familiar pit of misery, not helped by Carter's girlfriend losing her baby on ER.  I knew it was going to happen; the programme announcer advised me to have tissues at the ready.  But I ignored her, at my peril, and wiped my eyes on my sleeve.  And work today and I managed a whole 47 minutes of it before giving up and coming home.  I think it was the news that there was to be a fire drill that did it.  All the kids troop out, get told they were too loud or too slow, and then get sent back in to do it all over again.  I can't help but wonder if they would do that in the event of a real fire; 'I don't care if it's hot!  Get back in there, and this time do it quietly!'  Fire safety officers - bless them.

      OK.  Sweet child o'mine has landed safely, and informs me that it is very hot.  So I send back good wishes and sun cream warnings and lots of motherly love.  And I am here with just the 2.4 kids (cat equals 0.4 of a kid, in this equation), feeling a bit like a truck with a wheel missing.  So I get them videos and video games and sweets, and it still feels very odd.  And I am left wondering if: -  a) it is entirely normal to miss a child this much? And b) especially when its only a holiday!  It's not like she died, or even left home - she's only gone for two weeks!  I can't help thinking I need to get out more...

      Well, we managed the early start, plane now airborne, and just left with one hysterical child (and one who was quite unmoved).  Its only two weeks, I assured her, as she waved while sobbing pitifully.  But if the last few hours are anything to go by, it might be a long two weeks.

      Hey.  Finally, I get around to having my own blog.  These things take me a while.  From thought to action...eventually.  That's me.  Lets see how long I keep this up.  Today I feel rough.  I may have given myself food-poisoning. Tomorrow I have to be up at 5am, to see someone off at the airport.  I should sleep now, but I wont.  I'll hang around on here for a while, and watch some tv and read some mags, and then I'll drift off to sleep and I'll get 2 hours sleep and in the morning I'll look like shit.    I don't like sleep.  I always feel like I'm missing something.  Sleep is what I do when I want to get away, when it all gets too much, so to do it on a regular day seems wrong.  But until they figure out a way for me to do without sleep, I'll do it my way, and I'll look like shit.  So what.

      ...that I don't live alone.  I don't have the will power for it.  Three days by myself, and already I am staying up all night, sleeping in the day, living on sandwiches and red wine, and listening to loud music 24/7.  What wrong with that? Nothing.  Except I have a job, neighbours, wheat intolerance and an alcohol problem.  Will P. arrives home tomorrow, on the 15:37 train.

      Today I am tidying up like a woman possessed.  I think it might be because I phoned the CSA to see what they have done about my application, filed two months ago, to get some money from my ex.  They just spoke to him about it today, so I might, if I'm lucky, get some money in a month or two.  And that is very frustrating.  And this adrenalin has to go somewhere.  And cleaning is more constructive than throttling the cat.

      Kids got away ok, so now I'm here alone.    Very quiet.    I used to get this peace every weekend, but this is the first time I have been alone in the last 5 months, since the kids stopped seeing their dad.  It's very quiet.  I have a friend who might come over for the day on Thursday.  I'm pretty sure he's only coming for sex.  Which suits me - might be another five months before I get the house to myself again.

      I've just listened - really listened - to the lyrics of  urlLink Everything  by Alanis Morissette. That's the thing.  The big, scary, beautiful, elusive, overpowering thing. Being known,  and  being accepted.   When the choice so often seems to be an 'or' rather than an 'and'.

      Number one child doing fine and having a great time.  Some of the girls were apparently grounded for having boys in their room late at night, but mine wasn't one of them so phew for that. They have performed their class play in a local amphitheatre, and she tells me it went very well.  This means she didn't forget all her lines and have to be dragged on to the stage screaming and kicking, so all good there.  And the little ones are off to my mum's tomorrow.  I am ignoring all the comments about my ex (I can't cope if he is going to cause trouble!  I can't take stress!).  He's never been near her unless invited, and at the moment he's not so interested in the kids as he is in getting at me.  So I reassure her that everything will be fine, and meanwhile my harassment notice stays in place and my lawyer stands ready to apply for a non-molestation order.

      The electronic key to my car broke.  Not a big deal, except it also operates the immobiliser, and so I was stuck in Tesco's car park for 3 hours while the RAC man soldered it and stuck it back together as best he could, just to get my car going.  He advised me to get a replacement as soon as possible, so I phoned the manufacturer and tracked down a local dealer.  I had the number of the keypad, and I knew they'd be able to order a new one.  Off we go to a car radio specialist in town.    You know the kind of place - fits stereos that make the street shake as the car drives passed, as slowly as possible, for maximum pose effect.  A boy place.  I need a new one of these, I say, handing over the taped-up fob.  So he pulls the tape off, rips the guts out, and sticks it in a new casing.  Tries it on my car, and it doesn't work.   That's why I need a new one, says me.   The bloke grunts at me, and takes it out the back to his mate.  Mate arrives, points it at the car, and nothing.  Without the key-fob working, I can't use my car. Your unit's bust, he tells me.  Common fault on these, you'll need a new immobiliser.  But it was working fine when I came in!  Working fine until your mate pulled it to pieces!  Well, he said, we need the number... This number, I ask, handing him the paper I had it written on.  Off he goes and ten minutes later comes back with my electronic key, working fine.    I still ordered a new one, because I don't want to get stuck like that again, but I was angry.   I'm a girl, not an idiot, and when my unit packs up, I think I'll notice.

      Well then.  Father, it is six days since my last post, and today is a very different ball game.  Friend came over, but no sex was had.  I thought about it, I must admit.  But it occurred to me, suddenly, out of the blue, (and actually in bed...) that I didn't like him that much.  So there was no sex. A risky strategy, I agree, to get oneself in to the position where a 6'3" aussie built like a rugby player could take exception to ones attitude and cause an awful lot of trouble...  But he didn't.  Phew.  And here I am, a few days later.  All children back home safe and sound and back at school and, oh.  Yeah.  Didn't I mention? I might be about to have an affair. Watch this space.
