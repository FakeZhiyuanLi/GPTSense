      I just got back from school to check on this, the ads that used to be at the top of my blog are gone, and replaced by a search toolbar (I think). There's a thing at the top right, that says, "Next Blog", so clicked on it, and went to another blog. The blog was called "Britney", but decorated in a more sluttish, "I-fucked-20-high-school-jocks-at-one-time" way. There were just pictures of guys, and a few pictures of a party. She looked (or sounded, in some way) like she got fucked by her drunk father when she was 5. "Britney", if you can read this, take your fucking dildo, clean up your preppy, sluttish act, and crank on off somewhere else. Not Blogger, go back to Xanga with the other whores.  PS-I won't be posting much because of school and piles of homework, but on weekends, I'll try to post a shit load.

      Thank merciful god that I figured out how to publish posts, when recently you've been fucked over by Blogger's publishing. Here's how to do it:  If you try to publish a post and DNS error (aka "FUCK OFF" error) comes up. Well, what I did was scream, "Puck up, ya little cunt!", but you don't have to do that. If it happens, then go to "Edit Posts", and you will find out that your post is on the list. Click on the little arrow pointing right, next to the title of your post. Then, go to "Status", and republish. Afterwards, you will find your post on your site. Like I did.

      I can't comment for some reason, so I have post my comments on my site. I watch "Fairly Odd Parents" on account of my sister, she's turning 6. When I have nothing good to do, or I'm just plain bored, I watch cartoons all day. It fucking sucks, but I get plenty of new knowledge to create a new article.

      Do you notice the little notes at the bottom of most commercials? And who the fuck ever reads them? I do, but most people can't, maybe a lawyer for injury case is doing a commercial. If you can read that tiny, little note at the bottom of the screen that says, "Note: This is an actor/actress portraying a lawyer.", then you are in luck. If you're dealing an injury case (in a car accident or something other than that), your eyes could be dialated from the crash (somehow), or just have a disablity (with eyes caused by the crash), you probably can't read it. If so, may just think, "I want that lawyer, he looks pretty good at doing his job.", and you get screwed over by the actor, figuring out that he's just an actor.  With other commercials (one), the only one, was from Burger King, "The Dr. Angus Diet" commercial. First, they had the font of the letters really small. Then, a couple weeks after the commercial premired, they changed the font size to a reasonable, bigger size.

      Ever since George W. Bush came around as "president" in 2000, he as been, and always will be, a drunk and a disaster to America. But to the cartoon world? What the fuck? In 2002, a "Fairly Odd Parents" episode premired, one with an idiotic president. So stupid he destroyed Pluto instead of Earth.   Sorry, this post sucks.

      Do you feel, sometimes, that the world is gonna end? I feel the feeling every fucking second of this year, it feels strange, I get paranoid, a type of paranoia, I'm not sure what it is. I haven't read the bible or anything (because I'm an atheist), so I don't know excactly HOW the world is gonna end. But I have a pretty good idea: Everything will cumble, hell will freeze over, pigs will fly, and every single person will have to pay their bet money. Its nothing to worry about, I'm on medication, and I have felt paranoia every fucking second in my life.   :)

      Over history, all people have treated blacks unproperly and have tortured them. We have made them our servants, to cook the food and pull our cotton straight from the plant. Now they are free, and welcomed to do whatever they what (except break the laws and stuff). I live in a cul-de-sac with 2 black families as neighbors (12 blacks). It seems like they are racists because if you even make the mistake of saying something like "heritage" or "culture", you're going to get your fucking ass whooped, like I expeirenced. And for some reason, you just can't fight back or insult them because I would label myself a "racist" and they would too. I'm a tough guy (not so much, but still) and an anarchist but I don't wanna feel like I'm in the KKK or anything. And maybe an african-american can be reading this and get pissed just because I'm speaking my mind about his/her race. You don't have a lot of freedom talking to a black person when you're white. And as white as I am.

      "anarchy, frankly -- if you take it quite literally -- is mind games for the middle class. When you come from desperate poverty, and that's exactly what I come from, you know that nonsenses are not to be tolerated. I'm not sure who gains from chaos, but I know it's not the poor folks in the council flats. The politics of vindictiveness is never, ever anything like a solution."  "The sheep who buy Korn and Limp Bizkit . . . they're completely, utterly foolish."   "There isn't no such thing anymore. That's something that happened way back in the late 70s. Historically, that's where it belongs. You gotta move on. Anyone imitating that now in the 90's is a bit of a fool. You should have your own thing and stop looking up to Granddad."   - Johnny Rotten, retiree of the Sex Pistols

      If you're in the Kansas City Metro Area and watched Channel 5 News at 4 pm on Feburary 4, 2004, then you're in luck, you saw me in my television debut. I was the skinny, depressed kid with the red hair and freckles who was always alone. Well, you didn't see that much. When I was really getting a big part, by folding a piece of paper into a boat. I fucking suck at folding. And the with the camera was, like, "Can I get a shot of this?", I was thinking, "Fuck, yeah!". So he got a good, clean shot of me.  When I got home, I missed it.  A couple months later, my teacher showed the tape in class. And I was fucking cut outta it! They got a little shot of my face. CHANNEL 5 NEWS CUNTS! And that's how I nicknamed myself "Papercut", because I was folding a a piece of paper and they fucking cut me out. Get it?

      There's medication, drugs, there's cocaine, marijuana, acid, PCP, etc, other drugs, then there's aromatherapy, other other drugs. For those who don't give a fuck about "new age" shit, aromatherapy is basically getting high on strong-smelling candles. I tried aromatherapy once, but I wouldn't call it "aromatherapy", its probably in the marijuana/cocaine catagory. I was fixing up my dad's new house, I got a hand-full of plaster dust, took a few wiffs at it and passed out (hahahahaha, it think its fuckin' funny now). I don't much about it, I just go on Google and look for "new age" websites. They're pretty interesting, you should go on one sometime.

      Domestic violence usually comes from cartoons or basic TV. It gets into 7 year-old's minds and makes them mentally disabled in self-defense. Their minds are controlled by Dragonball Z. They go nuts, they seem to think that they can, like, kill someone in one punch. I know this shit because there are many lunatics in my cul-de-sac. The question, "Is domestic violence amusing?", its answer is "yes". It is very amusing in so many ways.

      I love punk, it gets me energized, it gets me angry and stuff. I love it. But "panty punk" is a whole different genre. "Panty punk" is Avril Lavigne (or whatever her name is), Good Charolette (if you disagree, then fine), Ashlee Simpson, Blink 182 (again, if you disagree, fine), and other preppy, idiotic bands I forgot about. Panty punk are the bands who overdress, like getting those so-called "punk" clothes at malls, like paint or underliner going down their faces into a shaft (like a blade or something like that). In an article (in some magazine), Avril (the fuck her last name is spelled) quoted, "I'm , like, the Sid Vicious of this generation." (courtesy of God Save The Sex Pistols). The fuck you are! You're did a song for a fucking Disney movie soundtrack! The fuck you're punk! The fuck you're the "Sid Vicious of this generation"!  Here are the punk bands who aren't pussies: Green Day Ramones Sex Pistols Dead Milkmen The Clash Velvet Underground The Damned The Misfits And every old punk band from the 70's - the 90's.

      R&amp;B/Funk singer/songwriter Rick James was found dead in Los Angeles, he was 57. Well, he was a cokehead, cokeheads die. According to the newsletter that I read, he died of "natural causes". Every person that died of "natural causes" has to be at least 70 or in their mid 60's, if their younger, its because of drugs or a sickness. And those aren't "natural causes".

      All the ruckus of presidency in commercials, has got me thinking...Maybe because Miller Beer and Budweiser Beer are having a taste presidency over commercials and even taste-test conventions all over the US. My questions are: How serious can these drunken people at Miller or Budweiser Brewery can get? (beer comes from Europe and mostly from Ireland (Oi to Ireland) Which presidential parties are they going in? (example: Miller the Democrats or Budweiser the Replublicans or the other way around.) What about NetZero HighSpeed Internet (I know a show that the guy in the commercial is in)? They're doing it in their commercials. What party are they?   If you're a politician who some how got on Blogger, shut the fuck up, I don't wanna hear you're fucking comments about my profound, yet disgusting outragousness in my fucking articles. This whole fucking site is for people who can just go up to someone and stand up between torment and say, "Fuck you, fuck you, ya cunt, you and your friends can just suck your little cocks as much as you want. But don't fuck with me, if you do, you will die an unholy death. Therefore you will perish, fall into the depths of hell where you were born.". Maybe not that specific, maybe the first two words or if you wanna step it up a notch, maybe the first sentence or second. What I'm trying to say is only liberal anarchists can read these articles or just anyone except christians and republicans because they might find my site "discriminatory" or "racist" in some small, tiny way.

      I was watching Reno 911, last night, (and believe me, its fuckin' hilarious) and they said "nigger", and usually people would bleep that out but for some reason they let. I know that on South Park they can say "asshole" without the "hole" part bleeped out. I'm a Vh1 fanatic, if nothing's on I watch Vh1, on "I Love The 90's" they would bleep out small innuendoes like "inserted" or "sucked", and they even bleeped out "hard", when describing a "hard" penis during an erection caused by Viagra. That's why we have ratings, like South Park being MA-TV. I figured out that the censors just don't give much a fuck about MA-TV. They bleep out "fuck", "dick", "cock", and other stuff like that, which Blogger doesn't like. So what do we have to say about censorship and the FCC?                                                       FUCK YOU, YA CUNTS!

      It's true, anime fucks with the minds of children. I used to be an addict, I use to think that a source of energy would come out of my hands and blow someone's head off. I think anime is not good for the United States, not good for here. Japan should stay in Japan (cartoons not people). Who knows, maybe in a new anime show, there's a sadistic repeating kitten saying "fuck off" in japanese, then, kids start doing it. Then they yelled at by a japanese guy. Its a cycle, really, creators make the cartoon in Japan, wait a few years, dub it, send it to the US, put it on a TV channel, wait a few months, make trading cards out of it, make the merchandise, put children in a fantasy world, the children tell their parents, the parents buy the cards and merchandise, it goes on for a year or less, the parents stop buying it, then the creators get unemployed, kill themselves, and another guy continues it, it craps out, then another anime craze comes on other than that one. Same as Poke'mon, Yugi-Oh! is too.

      I'm a Democrat, raised with liberal parents, I'm only 13, I can't vote yet. But I can still piss and moan about other people's problems. I think that (yes, PowerTheFire or whatever the fuck your name is, here's your answer to your question) people should be able to be how ever gay they want to be, even your friend. I have 3 friends who are gay, who gives a fuck. And not all queers are mean, my Mom's friend who's gay isn't mean. Let's talk about lesbians, have you ever seen two lesbians licking each other's clitorises. Now, picture that in your head, its perverted if you're doing what I told you to. But they're lesbians, they're having sex in a way, and that's no different from having sex that is between a woman and a man. Then why can't they get married like between a man and a woman.

      The series of commercials that was released a year or 6 months after the really, really depressing ones (the current series). There were the really depressing ones, one of the commercials (there were only two) was a kid, 5 years old perhaps, sitting on a street curb by a park. And the stoned person didn't pick him up ('cause he's fuckin' stoned). Stoned or not, the commercial really makes you put three fingers to the tip-top of your lips and say, "Oh shit, that's what I forgot.". The second one was kind of stupid, it really didn't make you think about anything. It was a grave on the side of the road and a man comes to the grave. Cheer up, ya stoned fucker, go smoke more mary!  This article is not good for children, shield their eyes! Get the fuck off the internet! Do something you fucker! For christ's sake call the FCC, oh, what the fuck does the FCC have to do with the internet! Okay, this little "goodbye" note is getting out of hand.

      Usually, you'd watch cartoons on Saturday morning, but you don't know what the primuses are. Well, here are the primuses of your regular Saturday morning cartoons: ABC Family: Spiderman: Watch a man deal with super-human spider powers and screw around. Power Rangers Dino-Thunder: Watch American race-confused super heroes pretend to punch Japenese archive. Beyblade: Watch another fad show about nothing. Cartoon Network: Dexter's Lab: Watch a Irish midget genious deal with everyday-life. Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy: Watch a pervert and a psychopath deal with life with the grim reaper. Powerpuff Girls: Watch 5 year-old whores beat the snot out of a raging alcoholic. Johnny Bravo: Watch a horny Elvis-lookalike hit on girls. Nickelodeon: Spongebob: Watch a brain-damaged sponge living underwater. Fairly Odd Parents: Watch a ten year-old with god parents screw everything up.  If you watch Saturday morning cartoons and you have read this, I'd be gladly for you to reconsider the morning activity.

      Ever since, Beverly Hills 90210 came on, all of our kids have been watching sex, guns, violence, and alcohol on television. "Soaps for Kids" the genre's called, kids have been watching teenagers shoot each other, having sex, and drinking the hell out of themselves. Yes, its a happy world in television for kids, ten year-olds are watching South Park then a follow-up of sexually harassing each other.  Tv is fun.  :)

      The famous Herbal Essences (spell check might've fucked up) "orgasim" commercials to my eyes has been cancelled. Anyway, what kind of hair is on her head? Well, if you've been watching TV, you probably won't see one of their "monthly orgasim commercials". Making a guess of probability (oh, gives a fuck about math!?), the conclusion would be television-wise, "It's cancelled.". Maybe the reason they cancelled it is because too many couples were split up. Or the woman with the pubic hair on her head had to go back to the circus. No one knows, it will remain a mystery until whenever.

It wasn't excactly that, you know what I mean. It concerns me when people don't listen to me, also, I want to here what "the people" of Blogger have to say about my articles. Either way, if you say "Get a life, fucker!", I'll represent that, I'd probably track you down on the net and put you down with insults 'til you get irritated and leave Blogger (I probably won't). If you say, "That was awesome, keep that shit up", I'll represent that, I'll do it.  Now, please comment on this piece of shit and my other pile of shit.   RSVP.

      Are you talkin' to me? In the 70's, Robert De Niro played a crazy taxidriver (I have seen the f***in' movie, so if he doesn't play a taxidriver then you figure it out) who made punk rock history and shaved his head to a mohawk. They just finished filming, Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah star in the film. It comes out in December 2004 or Janurary 2005.

      A movie spin-off of the cartoon series is coming to the big screen in 2006. Its a while, but Simpsons fans watch out. I'm not sure if its a live-action or cartoon, I'm guessing it's going to be a cartoon. You are probably wondering why I post these articles about movies going to get in theaters two years from now. It's just because I want to keep your adrenaline up and get updates on different movies.

      October last year, Paramount Pictures agreed to make the book "The Dirt" a movie. The Dirt is about living in Motley Crue's world, it was written by the band's frontman, Vince Neil. Whom passed out while my dad was in the same bar. The sucess of Moltey Crue's songs has a permanent mark in heavy metal history. There isn't anymore news upon the release of The Dirt, but I think its scheduled to be out in 2005.

      Remember in 1989, the first Batman movie came out. Michael Keaton played an insane orphan named Batman, who flew around and killed criminals. From Michael Keaton to (damn it, I forgot his name) to George Clooney to Christian Bate (who the hell is his he?). The sixth Batman movie (or fifth, I don't pay attention) is called Batman Begins or something with Batman and begins in it.  I adored Batman (I still do) I don't want Batman to be crushed with too many movies. I remember my Nana putting a tape of the old Batman TV series. Damn, those were good times. Anywho, I think you should just stick with comics and the tapings of the old Batman TV series.

      Throughout the years, hip-hop has been crude, rude, sexist, racist, brutal, violent, and not good for children. But this year, at hip-hop's highest standard, up the charts, more record sales, and more white kids saying "yo". But at the top mountain, they collapsed. Hip-hop record company, Murder Inc. , changed their name to a more "kid-friendly" name. I feel bad for them. Then, right out of the sky, drops a commercial, Snoop-Dogg, Dr. Dre, and other guys rapped in the commercial. The commercial was advertising Wrffs, some weird looking bike...for kids. Which surprised me, Snoop Dogg hosted a Girls Gone Wild video and starred in his own porno film.  I'm afraid hip-hop is going to hell. Greatest wishes.

      If you are trying to persuade a child or teenager to get off or don't get on drugs, that's fine. But when you are putting it in a commercial and making it more expilict and violent. Then broadcasting it over national television. That's not cool. The writers of the series of anti-drug commercials probably aren't thinking of children watching it. You don't want your child who is probably 5 years old and just watching cartoons to see a rated-r-like material commercial. According to me, a lot of stoners would watch Cartoon Network or something like that when they're high. But how can they understand these anti-drug commerials when they're high all day. That gets me thinking that the commerials are supposedly only for adults. But what kind of adult would be watching Cartoon Network? And that brings me back to being high. Only a high adult would be watching Cartoon Network. But they do show those commercials on different channels. So this whole f***ing post was meaningless. Oh, sh**. I'll still post it.

      If you find yourself watching Animal Planet and Animal Cops is on. Don't watch it. Those who watch it, its f***ing depressing, dogs are dying, kittens are being put to sleep. The fact of Animal Cops just makes me want to kill myself. If you kill kittens or smother puppies, you can watch the f***ing show. Otherwise, turn it off. I'm kind of an animal rights activist, but I still eat cheeseburgers. I love animals, but they taste too damn good.

      Sometimes you're so anxious to watch a show or a movie on TV you can't wait. This has only been proved on two channels but if you like to watch Vh1 or Comedy Central. Then you'll like this. On Vh1, in the morning through afternoon, they have nothing to show, so they show un-premired shows. Sometimes they show re-runs, which sucks, they may only show one un-premired show a day throughout the week. But thats just bad luck. On Comedy Central, on Saturdays or sometime on the weekend, at midnight, they will show an un-premired episode of The Graham Norton Effect.  I'll get back to you with more TV tricks.

      Vh1 is broadcasting a TV movie based on Micheal Jackson's life. If you were around in the 90's (or watch Vh1 a lot), you know the molestation scandal. I haven't seen it (because I'm not running a magazine or something), so there isn't going to be a review or anything.   It starts at 9/8c on Vh1.
