      As I will be vacating next week, it gives Stuart time to practice and get his faultering game back in order. I expect a much closer encounter in a fortnight, but the only way I can forsee defeat is with a  urlLink change of venue .

      Satan won 15-10 with his monster 21 ounce supercue from  urlLink Frank in Worthing  proving that new equipment really does make a difference. All that spam was true, then.  He wins control of this blog - unfortunately he is off to Alderney for a week or so, so  don't expect too much while he's there. Don't expect anything from me, either, I'm far too demoralised.  (Does it surprise anyone that the Lord Of Darkness vacates in  urlLink Alderney?  Honestly, he fits right it. Been going for years. Lots of soulmates, so to speak.)  Stuart

      The big question is will Stuart beat me on wednesday ? Probably not, but I'm happy to publicise my five point distraction-based evil gameplan that will see me through :       Bellow ciggy smoke all around the table, this always distracts ex-smokers.      Ensure a steady supply of guinness and encourage binge drinking.     Bring the topic of conversation around to Microsoft.  Introduce massive variations in the speed of my playing.     Get a posh new cue.

      I have invited  urlLink Satan , my opponent in the Wednesday night race to 15, to join this blog: we await his eager acceptance. Followed undoubtedly by reams of taunting for the ignominious trouncing he inflicted on me yesterday - 15-11. Ouch.

      A close run game tonight, Stu had the better of the early proceedings, cruising to a 6-3 lead. I pulled it back to 6 all, then close all the way to 13 all. A good clearance by Stu in the next frame, followed by a flukey 9 to clinch it 15-13. Damn...  What I learnt today...       Stuart plays well when sober.      Never buy your chalk from ASDA.      Rileys toilets stink.

      Not long to go now, Satan is mentally prepared to make it 3 in a row. However Stuart, insprired by his squash playing and new-found sobriety, will be a tough nut to crack tonight.  He even refused the prospect of fast food beforehand (something very strange is going on). I'm off to dose up on vitamin C and caffeine...  Let the cues do the talking...

      Well, what can I say, I think I put up a good fight. Was pretty much neck and neck for the first 20 frames levelling at 10 apiece. I think the Guinness got the better of us both then and we began to chat and I for one lost focus on the game (I'm wondering if this was some kind of sharking by Stuart). An easy 5-ball went awry for me and let Stuart in to clear up another frame. After that I never really got back in at all, Stuart's potting continued in good form and although I pulled one back, the final score was 15-11 to Stuart. We then played a couple of games of 8-ball, but the details of such games should not be included on a 9-ball blog. However, it seems someone has beaten us to  urlLink 8-ball blog .  A good evening, and next time hopefully Stuart will have to post...

      My time (and hover) cat had to go to the vets for her injections today. Of course, being a time cat, she has to have all manner of vaccinations for many diseases that are now no longer a threat to normal 'non-time' cats. Poor thing. She has gone to sleep it all off. Has to be said, they are a marvelous  urlLink practice  and would I recommend them to anyone whose cat needs jabs, worming tablets, flea protection or if they need their hoverpads serviced.

      The weekends just fly by, I don't have any heavium for my time machine so I guess I'll just have to let this one slip by at normal pace. I get paid soon, so I can buy some then, go forward in time, find out who wins the 3.20 at  urlLink Brighton  next week, come back, put a bet on and then I'll be big time in the money again. Don't like to abuse my gift, but sometimes it's just necessary. Then I'll come back to this weekend, and not drink quite as much as I did on Friday, so that yesterday I don't feel hungover and go out and get drunk again.

      If event A causes event B, event B cannot occur without event A preceding it, so event B is in event A's future and event A is event B's history.

      Rangor-The Supreme God Rangor is the first of the gods to have FULLY revealed himself. He claims that it was HE who created the universe and that the other gods and goddesses are his children. He has revealed his plan to replace Althena and Zophar in order to recreate the universe. Rangor is a force to be feared, for not even Vassago knew the full extent of his power...no one does! He was even so cocky as to invite the Heroes to a tournement to decide the fate of Lunar. In the past, he has heard of the "power of humanity" that Hiro and the others were able to harness in the absence of Althena's magic. He is interested in harnessing this power himself, but first he wants to see it in action.  Taken from  urlLink Here

      Reason being, when you're at work, and have been since 6am, and you realise that there is no way of getting everything done in time for the unfeasible deadlines imposed upon you. You can simply travel about and create as much time as you need to do all the things you need to do.  For example, I am currently working on something I completed earlier today. However if I hadn't done what I'm doing now, I wouldn't have been at the stage I was with it when I went back to complete it.  It's basically a well refined juggling act.  Best get on, no time to waste ;-)

Suddenly from my slumber I issue forth the words 'From this day onward, I wish to be known as Rangor, warlord of time'.

      As you know, I went to play pool with  urlLink Stuart  last night and you can read all about it on  urlLink 9-ball blog . I must say I could have tinkered with time to get a bit more practice in, but that would be wrong on two counts:  1) Using my time travelling abilities for that would be abusing my position as Warlord of time  2) It gets tiring going back and forth all day squeezing in the extra hour here and there, by the time I'd got enough practice in, I would have done a 70 hour day.  Oh, and for all of those who ask, 'surely you can go back again and sleep it off?' the answer is yes, but then I wouldn't have time to put in the practice, so I would have to go back again to do that, savvy?

      This is what I was (guess warlord wasn't an option), what about  urlLink you ?     You're a dragon. You're smart and cunning, and enjoy taking risks. Your need for independence is an advantage, but sometimes it alienates you from others. As far as *good* and *evil*, you're pretty neutral--but you may have something of a wicked streak.

      Am wondering whether I should find out how to reply to  urlLink this  and give them a hand. They must be feeling  very  desperate.
