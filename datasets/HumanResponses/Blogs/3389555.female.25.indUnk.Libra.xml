       Words of Wisdom for Today : If the church bells are ringing and the pigs are growing, then it is time to shred the carrots.    Alright, it is now time for the story for today :  Jasper strolled across the floor.  He sat on the arm of the couch and nonchalantly looked out the window.  It seemed as though he slept there for an hour, but Jasper was never far from consciousness.  Suddenly his eyes narrowed.  From a glint of light shining off the streetlight, he had caught a glimpse of two bright yellow eyes.   Jasper would recognize those eyes anywhere; they belonged to Whiskers.  He jumped down of the couch, landed on his feet and ran to the door.  Jasper stepped lightly outside and looked around.  All was quiet.  Then Jasper's ears perked; he heard a noise.  He dashed to the bushes and peeked his head out.  There was Whiskers, but he wasn't alone.  He was talking to Mittens and Little Tom.  What were they doing?  They had to be up to something.  Jasper slunk along the side of the bushes to get closer.    "So, LT, is everything set to go?"  Whiskers asked?  LT turned in circles as if chasing something.  "Yeah, tonight is great."  Mittens laughed and slapped Little Tom in the head. "Stand still, you won't ever catch it!"  Little Tom hissed "No, but I can catch yours!" and bit Mittens.  They started fighting.  "Knock it off" said Whiskers "Someone will hear." "Ok, Mittens we need you to run upstairs at exactly 7pm.  You should be out of the building by 7:25.  LT, you did your job?"  "I loosened all the hinges this morning, the building will be ours tonight."  purred Little Tom.  "I'm so sick of those mutts running everything, owning the halls."  said Mittens  "It will all be over tonight.  I got the poison from my friend who lives at the gardening center.  With Mittens as our decoy to get all those mutts to break down the doors and chase him, while their owners chase them, poisoning their food will be easy."  said Whiskers.  All three of them howled in delight.    Jasper looked at the moon, it was almost seven!  What could he do?  He didn't like 'those mutts' either, but a building ruled by Whiskers, Mittens and Little Tom wouldn't be any better.  Jasper still believed that an agreement could be reached with the mutts.  He thought hard.  He heard a noise and looked up.  Mittens was headed towards the building.  He had to act now.  He leaped out of the bushed with a growl.  Whiskers hissed at him.  They circled each other.  "Get out of here Jasper." Whiskers warned.   "I can't let you do this"  "You can't stop us" "Go Mittens!"  Jasper lunged at Mittens and grabbed him around the throat.  Whiskers and Little Tom ran towards them.  Jasper knew that he couldn't win this, he had to do something else.  He broke free and grabbed the bag of poison that Whiskers had left behind.    "Get him!"  yelled Whiskers.  Jasper ran as fast as he could.  Where could he take the poison?  He ran towards the center of town.  There had to be somewhere.  He ran past a store window and could see the others still following him in the reflection.  They looked a little odd.  Then Jasper had an idea.  He ran right into the animal shelter building on the edge of town.  The others followed him into the shelter before they realized what was going on.    Whiskers looked around.  "We have to get out of here"  he said.  All of a sudden some people picked them up.  "These poor kitties!  None of them have any collars, its like they knew to come here."  said one of them.    Another said, "Oh, this one has a collar, it says his name is Jasper."    "Good, we can take him home then," the first one said, "the others can stay here with us.    Jasper smiled to himself.  He had dropped the bag of poison on the floor.  It just looked like an empty paper bad, someone was sure to throw it away.    When Jasper got home, his family was happy to see him.  He was scolded for fighting, they had heard him out the window, but they were glad that he was back.  Jasper curled back up on his couch and looked out the window.  He would pick up the collars that the others had left outside tomorrow.  They had taken their collars off before the plan so that they could not be identified later.  He smiled to himself as he remembered a sign that had been hung up in the shelter.  He didn't need to worry about Whiskers, Little Tom or Mittens that night.  In fact, in six days, he would never have to worry about them ever again.  He slept peacefully that night.

      Out the window there is a boy in a green shirt.  He is standing.  Across the street.  I stare.  There is a car parked across the street.  I stare at that.  It rears back and becomes a dragon, lunging at me.  I am bored, maybe if I start at it really hard, I can make it move.  Maybe I'm not bored enough to make things move with my mind yet.  The boy is still standing there.  He seems unmoved by the possible threat of danger of dragon car.  I look up and he is gone.  That car is quick.  I wonder if anyone else in the street mourns the loss of another dragon car fatality.

      Oh Big Yellow Statue, It's hard to stare straight at you. Your bright golden hue is rivaled by few And from you the sun takes its cue.  You went on a tour, But your absence we did ignore Till Pitt told us the score. Now back and travel no more, Your loss we could not endure.

      Things had been quiet in the apartment building since the departure of Whiskers, Little Tom and Mittens.  At first, their owners had thought that the cats had been kidnapped.  As though someone had broken into the building in order to steal cats for some nefarious purpose.  Some people in the building remembered hearing what sounded like a cat fight on the night that they disappeared and this was generally agreed upon in the building as the cats bravely fighting against their captor as they were dragged away into the night.  Signs were hung up around the neighborhood, the police were called and no one ever considered to look in the shelter.  After all, these were cats with collars and little paw-shaped licences that jingled when they ran.  There was no reason that cats of this caliber would have ended up in a shelter.    Jasper was happy for that month or so.  Things were quiet in the building and he was free to roam where he wished.  During that first month, all the pet owners in the building were afraid to let their beloved furry ones out alone in fear of another mass pet-napping.  Yet, after that first month, the owners began to be more lax about letting their animals out.  By the end of the second month, the building had returned to normal, cats and dogs were free to wander the halls and outside of the building.    There was, however, one exception.    There were now 3 fewer cats in the building.  This may not seem like a lot, but in a building of only 8 cats and five dogs to begin with, this loss of cats greatly affected the cat/dog ratio.  The three owners who had lost cats had not yet replaced them and one of them even talked about getting a dog instead.  It began slowly, but things changed.  One day Jasper noticed that he felt uncomfortable walking alone in the halls.  It wasn't anything in particular, it was just a feeling.  There always seemed to be a dog watching him.  Wherever he went, there was at least one dog, somtimes two or three.  But Jasper just thought that this was because there were more dogs than cats now and it just seemed like there was always a dog around.    Things got more and more tense, but Jasper didn't do anything about it.  He wasn't really friends with any of the other cats in the building, or the dogs for that matter.  He was just really a loner.    Then one day, Jasper ran down to the laundry room to look for some mice and there were two of the dogs sitting outside the door.  Jasper looked up at them and then just tried to walk in.    "No cats" one of them growled at him.  "What are you talking about Rusty?" Jasper asked   "He said no cats" said the other dog.  He just looked at Jasper with a hint of a smirk.  "Since when Duke?" Jasper asked the other dog.  "Since today"   "What's going on?"  Duke nonchalantly chewed on his foot.  "No cats, thats what's going on" he said.  "And I would stay away from the 2nd floor storage closet if I were you."  Jasper looked back and forth between the two dogs.  He knew that he didn't want to start something by himself against Rusty and Duke.    "Ok then, see you two later" he said and lightly walked away.  He wasn't sure what was going on, but he knew he wasn't going to live in a building run by dogs.  Dogs that he had saved, mind you! He knew what he had to do.  He ran to his apartment and picked up his small red bandana out of its hiding place under his scratching post.  He ran to the front of the apartment building, tied the bandana to the front door and then went back to his apartment to have a nap.  At ten till midnight, Jasper snuck out the cat door to his apartment and ran outside to the dumpster.  He was quiet and careful not to be seen by any dogs.  When he got there, 2 of the other cats were already there.    "Hi Socks, Critter," Jasper said.  "Hiya Jasper!" said Critter.  He jumped around and played with an old soup can that had rolled out of the trash.  "Jasper" Socks nodded.  He put out his foot and stopped the soup can.  "This is a secret meeting, Critter, keep it down."  "Are the girls coming?" Jasper asked.  Socks nodded, "I saw them earlier."  He looked at Jasper.  "I heard that you had something to do with the disappearance of Whiskers and them."  Socks licked his foot and Jasper saw the scar over Socks' eye in the moonlight.  "I did," Jasper said, "I heard them plotting to kill the dogs and I thought I should do something."  He looked Socks in the eye.    Socks looked back at him.  Critter ran around, now batting his own tail around.  "I never liked Whiskers, he always stole my mice from me, " Critter said.  "I appreciate your honesty," Socks said, "I don't know if I trust you, but you have always been a straight cat."  "I just did what I thought would be best for the building, for all of us," Jasper said.  Socks nodded, "So why did you call this meeting?"  Just then they all heard a noise behind them and jumped up.  Well not Critter, he was still playing with his tail.  But it was just Princess and Sonya.  "Hello ladies," Jasper said.  "Hi Girls!" said Critter.  "Hi guys," Princess and Sonya purred.    Socks nodded his acknowledgement of their presence.  "Sorry we're late," said Princess, "we had to hide from some of the dogs for a little bit."  Jasper paced in front of the cats and looked at them before he spoke.  Critter continued to play with his tail while he talked to Sonya.  Sonya licked her paw and preened herself while she listened to Critter.  Socks' eyes scoured the back of the building and his ears were perked up.  Princess sat quietly and looked at Jasper.  "Well, I've called this meeting to talk about our dog problem," Jasper said.  To Be Continued...

      There is some crazy homeless guy gesturing over the dragon car.  I don't think he realizes what kind of trouble he could be in.  He keeps licking this piece of paper.  Maybe he is a wizard and he's doing a spell to tame the dragon.  That would explain the hair.  The licking continues.  The dragon's eyes are darting back and forth uneasily.  You can just feel the tension.  Some kid is taking a picture of the crazy guy.  Maybe it will be one of those messed up pictures, with a smeary face, like in the movies.  Maybe not.

      The yellow umbrella quietly patrols the back streets of Shadyside when an unsuspecting pink umbrella bounces by.  FLASH!  The yellow brillance - the pink umbrella screams in blinded pain.   SLASH! RIP!  The yellow umbrella is gone and a crushed umbrella skeleton surrounded by a few pink shards are all that remain.  Unfortunately, the black umbrella of protection had stopped in for a quick cup of Starbucks.

      A bird hops under my table and I think "How cute."  Then I think, "Oh dear, it means to peck my eyes out."  It looks me up and down.  I look it up and down.  It hops away.  "Aha!  Take that bird!"    And then I wonder why would something hop that has wings?

      It attacks without warning. Its glaring yellow color will blind you and then the pointy spokes will do their business.

      If people grew taller when they gained weight - would supermodels be really short?  Or maybe people would try harder to gain weight.  Maybe it would make a better army or be better able to pick apples off trees, maybe your 'height' would become dangerous if you grew over 8 feet.  People could go on diets to lose height.  Actresses would try to be as short as possible; they could have leg bones taken out to look shorter - basketball players would be disgusting and unhealthy.  Overheight people would be ostracized because they would be too tall to go to restaurants or the movies.  People would say "God, I hope that tall slob doesn't sit in from of me."    Little people would be gods.  Maybe the tall people could all run away together, because they have really long legs.  They could live together and build houses that they could fit in.  And maybe someday they could come back to town and take down that little people monarchy.  Maybe they could eat and eat until they become Giants and crush the homes of the shorter people.  They could rip the shorties apart and roast their dogs over a great bonfire made from the movie theaters that they could not fit into.  And they would all be happy.  But it wouldn't last because the people who were taller would start to make fun of the people who were shorter.  Because even amoung the really tall people, there are height differences.  And the tearing apart and dog roasting would continue until only a few very tall people, or perhaps a few shorter, craftier people, were left.    So maybe it is a good thing that people don't grow taller as they gain weight.
