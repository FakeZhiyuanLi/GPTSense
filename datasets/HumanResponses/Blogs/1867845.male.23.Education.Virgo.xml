      Been in Oxford for about four days now.  For a period on Thursday I wasn't sure if I would ever get here, while I enjoyed a five-hour delay at the Pittsburgh airport in addition to three hours of scheduled stopover time.  I have been busy mostly with orientation lectures and things of that sort.  Here are some of my reflections so far, from the personal files of Jonathan.  They will probably make more sense to MRSC alumni, but perhaps they are vivid enough for others to appreciate.  It is here for those interested.   The Senior Tutor  Dr P is a comedian.  That's all there is to it.  If you don't know what he looks like, just visualize either Teedledum or Teedledee (I don't care which) wearing a sweater.  Everything he says is gold, in a stuffy sort of way.  He announced that he “wears a thin veneer of contempt” but is a nice guy underneath.  I think his veneer of contempt (and self-deprecating humor) are what make him loveable.  He has a most distinctive way of talking, and should become a Shakespearean actor.  He seems to have a flair for the dramatic.  If not stage acting, then at least some voice-acting.  Maybe he could be on the Simpsons.  [Update: Dr P said there's an upcoming performance of Alice and Wonderland at some theater in Oxford, adding under his breath that he'll be participating in it!  No information was divulged on how he will be participating or in what capacity (or character).]  He also gave a computer room orientation. He pointed out that MRSC does not have an extensive IT department, reflected by the fact that he is giving the instructions: “I am to computers what Attila the Hun is to [didn't hear it because I was already laughing too hard].” I'm sorry, I guess it doesn't really work without imagining his voice inflection.  P also showed on the overhead a photograph of how PC users can print out a document from MS Word: put the monitor, screen down, on a photocopy machine. I'm not sure what's funnier, the picture or the fact that he put a monitor on a photocopier to take a picture of it.   The Principal  Dr F has about him that creepy-old-guy aura that is endearing in a way.  I was pleased that he sat down right next to me once last night in his library open house, which was fine until I saw his teeth.  For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of making Dr F's acquaintance, he has the most remarkable facial expressions.  He often smiles very big while squinting his eyes shut.  He does this at the end of every sentence (and sometimes in the middle), regardless of what he's actually saying.  I imagine he could say something about the Holocaust and cap off his sentence with a squinty grin.  A squinty toothy grin, that is.  A squinty yellow-toothy grin, furthermore.  O, his teeth.  Yellow, crooked teeth.  I swear I saw holes in some of them.  It was difficult not to laugh or chuckle or smile no matter what he said, because that smiley-squint was so unexpected and disarming, every time.  CCUC head honcho I thought I would never see Dr Ing. again, but then I met Dr R.  He is the spittin' image of Biolamirada's notorious former English professor, but all of his facial expressions and his way of talking are just like Tim H., the former youth director at my cousin's church in El Norwalko.  He seems like a really nice guy, so I don't trust him yet.  His assistant, Al, needs to renovate his wardrobe or something, because right now his clothing draws too much attention to his man-boobs.  I've always believed that one ought to downplay those sorts of features, if one has them.   Students  I've only encountered one inexcusably annoying person so far, Mark Something.  I was surprised to discover this last night at Dr F's reception because Mark seemed pretty okay when I met him the day before.  But when Dr F, who sat down in a chair next to me to take care of pipe business, asked the girl sitting next to me (on a couch dating from the 1840s, Dr F informed us) what she thought about the United States and the impending conflict in the Middle East, Mark seized the opportunity to expound on the shortcomings of American foreign policy and the state of our news media.  Aside from the fact that most of the things he said were glib, universal, “clever” one-liners that wouldn't hold up if given a moment's inspection, it was mostly annoying because it seemed like he was just parroting a bunch of things he's heard other people say which had struck him as intelligent-sounding.  My instinct was confirmed when I learned from my couch-partner that Mark was into “journalism” and had worked for the Ass. Press last year. Mark himself functionally admitted to his pretentiousness when he told Dr F that he's wanted to be a foreign correspondent since he was 10.  Yes, you read that correctly.  I ask you, what ten-year-old wants to be a “foreign correspondent”?!    Other gems from this conversation include Mark's agreement with Dr F's observation that, despite Nixon's other problems, his foreign policy was brilliant (fair enough), to which Mark added that it was definitely “beyond his years.”  Huh?  Was Nixon a teenage president or something?  Maybe Mark meant to say that Nixon was “ahead of his time” or something, because unless Nixon developed like osteoporosis or impotency I don't understand how he could have done anything beyond his years.  Well, I'm not going to give annoying people any more room here.  Everybody else I've met has been cool.  I have achieved this by not introducing myself to the people that I probably don't want to know, which are thankfully a minority (not minorities).  I met all of the other Bi*la students on Saturday.  I basically did not know any of them, but they all claim to already know me.  Matt A. is one of them who was here last semester as well, and is now an assistant of some kind for Dr R and the CCUC.  He was one of those who led four groups through Oxford Saturday to point out some sights.  I supplemented his tour with the obligatory sarcastic editorializing and annoying questions that are unanswerable.  I feel ashamed to confess that I reminded myself of Dr X, my puns were so bad.  I am more ashamed to say that everyone thought they were funny, which is just depressing.  Matt and I hit it off pretty well, probably because he reminds me in many ways of Jesse T.  One of the girls here is the one to whom Dr X spontaneously announced I was engaged at that party at his house in December, but I have been feigning ignorance of the whole episode when she keeps mentioning that I met her there, expecting a sign of recognition.  HA ha!  It has been frustrating her greatly that I seem not to remember her.  But today she must have decided that I really don't remember her, because she's suddenly started being extra nice to me.  The whole thing is rather funny.   Accommodations  I have been placed at the N*rth Oxf*rd Ov*rseas C*ntre (non-university-affiliated accommodations for foreign students), which is so far north that it's not on standard Oxford maps.  The population of the N**C is comprised of Mexican and mostly Asian students, which means that the kitchen always smells like the Talbot student lounge.  So I generally stay out of there, except when I have to run in and out to retrieve my milk.    There is absolutely no internet access at the N**C, so I have to do all my online work here at St Michael's, the headquarters for MRSC.  At least I don't have a roommate there, which means that I can play Austin Powers music in the morning and shake my booty with impunity, without anyone knowing about it.  (Whoops!)  At any rate, the original Austin Powers soundtrack is still highly recommended.  Don't let your perception of the movies prejudice you -- it's nothing like them.   Miscellanea  Today we spent an hour at Bodleian, getting our readers cards and getting an overview tour.  I also had my first meeting with one of my tutors, Ms Gilian W., who was very nice and I think will make an excellent tutor for my Renaissance Epic tutorial.  I have not yet met with Giles W., my tutor for Later Renaissance Italy (c. 1500), and my only contact with my architecture seminar leader Dr Jones was on Sunday when he took us all on a double-decker coach to visit the Tower of London.   On the bus ride back from London, I sat next to another student named Luke whom I had not yet met.  Nice guy from Minnesota, obligatory bowl-shaped haircut, blonde, with glasses.  (Following day, Luke was wearing a homemade t-shirt sporting the phrase “Platonic Form of Hot Guy-ness.”)  Anyway, on the bus he soon fell asleep sitting up, but his head kept bobbing to the right towards my shoulder, until he would catch himself in his sleep and his head would suddenly right itself.  After about 50 bobs, though, he was finally so sleepy that his head would fall down on my left shoulder, stay there for about 30 seconds, then suddenly right itself again.  This repeated itself 50 more times, to the utter delight of everyone seated around us.  Since there wasn't much scenery and it was dark anyway, Luke's head-bobbing comprised the main form of entertainment.  Luke never woke up although everyone was laughing outloud.  One girl would explain to new people just discovering this fascinating exhibition that what makes it more funny is that Jonathan doesn't even know this guy.  Reflecting on this, I realized that I must emanate the Light of Jesus or something, because apparently people feel subconsciously comfortable with falling asleep on my shoulder.  For example, Tom W*rd did this, to an even greater degree, on a ferry from Capri to Sorrento in 2001.  (That episode may be confirmed by the extensive photographic documentation, from multiple exposures on several different cameras.)  Well, this has gone on long enough.  I'm not sure how many times (if at all) I'll be able to email as the term progress, as I have already acquired homework.
