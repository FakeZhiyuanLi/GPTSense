      The weather man just called me his friend twice in the first 2 sentences of his introduction on Overnight Outlook.  That is definitely a weird way to approach your audience.  I guess I should feel closer to the staff at The Weather Channel now.&nbsp; They're " friendly ".  Maybe I would be a bigger fan of Ann Coulter if she called me her friend.&nbsp; Of course then I'd have to make it through the first 2 sentences and that probably wouldn't happen unless there was a backup tv to recover from the brick throwing incident.........

      have I mentioned that I love playing music?    I love playing music in the morning , when I'm tired and need something to wake me up... no matter how tired I am, it does not get old...    I love playing music in the afternoon , when the day is in full swing and I need a break, or when it's a day off and it's sunny and breezy outside and I can sit on the porch writing a song about how great it is....    I love playing music at night  because it's so mysterious and calm, almost necessary for some kind of theme music...    I love playing music when I'm in a good mood...  It enhances the goodness and makes me happy longer.    I love playing music when I'm in a sad mood...  It helps me get through what I'm feeling down about or when necessary expresses my feelings enough that I'm comfortable being sad at that moment..    I love playing music by myself. &nbsp; What I think in my head while I'm playing could keep me going all day.    I love playing music with other people.  The energy created between a group of people that have gotten into a grove is inspiring.. .   I love playing music in front of people.&nbsp;  Sharing my soul is exciting and frightening at the same time.... trying to send the message of the song across with your instrument is an experience not soon forgotten...    I love writing songs for people I know even if they'll never hear them...     I love sharing songs with people I know that I've written about them...    I love writing songs.  I love playing music.  I love listening to music.  I love watching music.  I love learning music.  I love living music.   fin

      After watching  urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep , I am now ready for the just slightly almost announced Freddy vs. Jason vs......     ASH!!!!!   urlLink CNN Article Here....   Yes, that is cool. Yes, that is also stupid. But yes, that is cool.  Take Freddy vs. Jason. Who actually liked that movie? I didn't, and I haven't even bothered to watch it yet. But it gave us two very important thoughts to ponder.  Why....... Why are Freddy and Jason still around? Who....... Who will get rid of them forever?  Freddy and Jason are still around because their creators have not come up with a proper way to kill them off for good. They're still around because people still watch the movies. They're still around because they haven't met Ash.  Ash is finally ready to rid the world of them forever, and he will kick the crap out of them with his boomstick.  And yeah....  I was more pumped up about it when I started, now I ran out of steam. So, the "serious" stuff. Sam Raimi won't be directing it....that's bad. I'm not sure if anybody can capture the true character of Ash besides Raimi. But, there's no way they would use Ash without Bruce Campbell, so it will be close to perfect. It will definitely have too large of a budget and will definitely bomb at the box office. But that's okay... It will be a B-movie and shouldn't be intended to make millions, it will be better if it doesn't.

      Julia Child, the famous cooking teacher for Robin Williams and many others, has passed away at the age of 91.  I was going to say ripe old age, but that's too easy and I would feel bad about it....     How much did she kick ass?  Well, honestly, I never watched her show (I'm not sure if I was around then), so I couldn't tell you.  But when she says things like cooking "wasn't just for fancy French chefs."  That makes me think she must have been cool....  Because it's not, it's for everybody.  But lots of people get intimidated by cooking.  If it was really that hard to do, could I do it?  I don't think so.  RIP Julia (1912-2004)

      so I've been playing pool regularly since about January or February and have been playing with house cues the whole time.    I'm finally taking the step and dishing out some dollars to have a nice one of my own...  it's not the most amazing thing in the world, but it is a Joss, so it will be good     I can't wait, can't wait, can't wait, and did I mention the part where I can't wait?  Yeah, it's that cool.  So, this will pretty much guarantee that I will be at the pool hall 7 days a week for the next month or so.  Which I'm okay with, why shouldn't I be.  The place is about 1.5 miles from my house, I can't go wrong.  Oh, and Leno sucks but for some reason I haven't changed the channel.

      Ok, so hopefully you all are familiar with  urlLink Warren Zevon , if not, then just remember that he's the guy who wrote "Werewolves of London" among many other great songs...  Short version of the long story, great songwriter diagnosed with lung cancer, decided not to do anything about it and then wrote an album about his forthcoming death....  Depressing stuff, but enlightening all the same.  Before I knew anything about Warren, David Letterman dedicated an entire show to him, an interview, 3 songs, amazing stuff... The most moving part of the conversation they had was the following:    David Letterman:  from your perspective now, do you know something about life and death that maybe I don't know now?     Warren Zevon:  not unless I know how much you're supposed to enjoy every sandwich. you know.   Why was that so moving? I have no idea. But for some reason, it has made me think about that line almost every time I eat a sandwich. And he's right, sandwiches are good. If you don't stop and enjoy them, what else in life can you stop and enjoy?  Anyhow, the related story...  A couple nights ago I went to go make a sandwich.  Standard peanut butter and jelly, nothing fancy.  As I opened the pantry door, I thought to myself "enjoy every sandwich".  I pulled out the bread, pulled out the peanut butter, went to the fridge and pulled out the jelly (actually jam, but nobody says peanut butter and jam).  Put everything on the counter and was ready to make my sandwich.  Then.... I open the bread bag to find that a mouse had eaten through a part of every slice and left droppings in return.   I could not enjoy my sandwich.    Now normally, I think I would just shrug this aside and curse the mouse for being hungry, but all because of that quote, I was disturbed.  Enjoy every sandwich, because one day you might not have a sandwich to enjoy.  Enjoy everything, because one day you might not be alive to enjoy it.
