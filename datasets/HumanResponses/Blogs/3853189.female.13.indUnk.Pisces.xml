      /Story/  Aikawa Kazuhiko is the captain of the prestigious Tendoji High School basketball team and leads them numerous victories and fame. However, for some unknown reason Aikawa leaves Tendoji and begins attending Mizuho High School which doesn’t even have a boy’s basketball team. When Aikawa arrives at Muziho’s gym he meets what’s left of the boy’s basketball club and begins rebuilding the team.  When Aikawa arrives there are only four players still left in the boy’s basketball club. Fujiwara Takuya, the current leader of the group, Miura Ranmaru, three-point shooter and resident pretty boy, Ishii Tsutomu, a hot headed player lacking much discipline, and Dobasi Kenji, the huge center. Aikawa must win over their respect and get the school faculty to reaccept the boy’s basketball team again before they can even start playing.  Unfortunately, even when they do begin playing again they only have five players, just enough to be able to qualify for regular games. Fouling out becomes a major problem for Mizuho’s team forcing the team members to test their limits every game! The series follows the Mizuho team as they rebuild their basketball skills and try to make it into the Interhigh championship.   /Characters/  The Mizuho team is a pretty plain parade of characters. Not that they are not cool to see. Aikawa and Fujiwara both look cool. Fuji looks like a young, baller version of Saitoh Hajime of Rurouni Kenshin fame. Overall, nothing that stands out, good or bad.   ~~The Boys.~~  Aikawa Kazuhiko. (衰川和彦)  Number 7. Former captain of Tendouji high school basketball club. He was unhappy in Tendouji and left to find a place where he can play a more enjoyable basketball game. :) And, Mizuho was where he went to~ :) He later develops a crush for Moritaka of the Girls' Basketball Club.. ^_^   Fujiwara Takumi.(藤原拓弥)  Number 4.Team captain of the Mizuho team. He's an item with the captain of the Girls' Basketball team, Akiyoshi. :) Affectionately known by Ishi-chan as "Taku". But most members call him "Fujiwara".   Dobashi Kenji. (土桥建二)  Number 5.Ishi-chan always calls him "Oyaji" but most other members call him "Dobashi".   Ishii Tsutomu. (石井 努)  Number 6.He has a very lively and bubbly character! :) Known by most members as "Ishii-chan".   Miura Ranmaru.(三浦兰丸)  Number 8.&nbsp;His 3 pointers are superb!! Hmm, Keiko of the Girls' Basketball Club seems to have a crush on him.. ^-^   Atsushi Moriyama.(森山郭司)  Number 4.Team captain of the Maruta Chuoh High School Basketball Club.   ~~The Girls.~~   Akiyoshi.(秋吉梦净美)  &nbsp;The team captain of the Girls' Basketball team. She's the girlfriend of Fujiwara Takumi and like him, she's also a point guard on the team..~ :)   Moritaka Mai. (森高麻衣)  Affectionately known by Aikawa Kazuhiko as "Pony-chan" because she always ties her hair up in a ponytail. ;) She's a shooting guard of the team and specialises in 3 pointers.   &nbsp;

      The StoryMitsuki is a twelve-year-old grade schooler who has loved singing as if it were breathing to her. It comes so natural that she can't help but do it. And she gets in trouble by her grandmother because it has been forbidden within their household to do anything with music.  Slipping through her grandmother's tight security, Mitsuki passed the first stage of an idol audition. Unfortunately, can she get there? And can she lie that she's 16 years old?  Of course not. That's when the two shinigami come into the scene. Mitsuki sees them and they're surprised that she can see them. They tell her she has only one year to live and so she is even more determined to make her dream come true.  After a lot of mishaps and asking, Mitsuki is granted by sexy Takuto a pill with his blood to be able to turn into a healthy, sixteen year old girl. She gets the part of being an idol, but she has another problem. Who is her guardian? That's where her doctor comes in. Wakaoji-sensei thinks she (12 year old Mitsuki) is going to be a model...  And things even get more complicated from there.  But why is she so determined? More than anything, she loves to sing. But with that singing, she had made a promise long ago to a boy. Eichi-kun, as we are told, went to America to become an astrologer. Though six years her senior, at age 16, he told a 10-year-old Mitsuki that he loved her. And that they would meet each other when their dreams are fulfilled.  That's how you end up with Mitsuki's stage name: Full Moon. He told her that as long as they were apart, they would always be under a full moon.  Mitsuki wants to believe Eichi still likes her... and that's why it's called Full Moon wo Sagashite: Looking for (the) Full Moon.   The Characters Mitsuki Kouyama(神山滿月) - The 12 year old girl and main character of the story that wants to be a singer despite the obstacles because of a promise she made. This determination is what got Takuto to give in to help her become a singer.   Takuto(達克托) - a cute bishounen and shinigami who whole-heartedly helps Mitsuki to achieve her dream. He is sometimes mean, but always has good intentions. He also sings. (woohoo)   Meroko(梅洛寇) - a genki shinigami who is the sempai of Takuto. Though she wants to follow things in the book, things happen otherwise. She likes Takuto and gets easily jealous when Takuto doesn't pay attention to her. But she also helps Mitsuki in becoming a singer.   Wakaoji-sensei(若王子医生) - Mitsuki's doctor that cares for her like a parent and even says so. He looks like an older version of Eichi-kun and is very very kind-hearted.   Grandmother(滿月的外婆) - Mitsuki's grandmother doesn't like music and it has something to do with Mitsuki's parents. She is very old-fashioned and domineering.   Eichi-kun(嬰井英知) - Mitsuki's childhood sweetheart. Before she could say her feelings back, he left for America to become an astronaut. But he promised her that they'd meet again when they had both fulfilled their dreams.

      INTRODUCTION  Daisuke Niwa is an ordinary, if slightly unlucky, middle school student. On his fourteenth birthday, he comes down with a 'condition' that has plagued the men in his family for three hundred years. When he sees his crush, Risa, he transforms into his alter ego, the phantom thief Dark Mousy. Unfortunately, when Dark Mousy sees his crush, Risa's twin Riku, he transforms back into Daisuke. The only cure for this craziness is if Daisuke can get Risa to fall in love with him ...  Yukiru Sugisaki's wildly popular DNAngel manga is one of the most eagerly awaited series in our '04 line-up. It inspired a hit anime show, and began its manga run in Japan in Asuka Magazine in 1999.  Daisuke Niwa(丹羽大助)  An ordinary, if slightly unlucky, middle school student. Cursed with a hereditary 'condition' upon turning 14, whenever he sees the love of his life he is transformed into the persona of 'Dark,' a magical master-thief.       'Dark' The phantom thief that Daisuke turns into whenever he sees the girl he has a crush on.       Risa Harada(原田梨纱) The young girl that Daisuke has the hots for. She is a bit out of his league, though -- at least that's what Risa thinks. She has an ultra-competitive relationship with her sister, Riku.       Riku Harada(原田梨红) Risa's twin sister. The thing is, the phantom thief Dark is ga-ga for this twin. And when he sees her ... you guessed it, he turns back into Daisuke.       Satoshi Hiwatari(日度 怜)  Classmate of Daisuke's. He's somewhat aloof and extremely intelligent. He may just be Dark's/Diasuke's undoing.       Inspector Saehara(讶原)  The detective obsessed with capturing the infamous Dark ... so far with less than impressive results.

      Characters & their profile:   Tohru Honda(小透)~16-17 years old ~156.7cm ~46kg ~Bloodtype:O ~Sign:Taurus ~A Sophomore at Kaibara High School.  Tohru's life seems to get stranger and stranger. After a string of tragic and bizarre circumstances, she found hersif working as a housekeeper for the Sohma family. Her generous nature, sympathetic heart, and friendly manner are in stark contrast to the prevailing mood in the Sohma House. Her clam, caring compassion is obvious as she kindly pputs everyone else's needs above her own.   Saki Hanajima,'Hana-chan'(小花)~16-17 years old ~162cm ~52kg ~Bloodtype:AB ~Sign:Aries ~A Sophomore at Kaibara High School.  Hana is protective of her friends, espcially Tohru. She has an electromagnetic power that allows her to sense the good and evil in people as well as the ability to see their auras. On top of this strange ability, her rather gothic demeanor scares many of the students at her school.   Ansa Uotani, 'Uo-chan'(小魚)~16-17 years old ~168.5cm ~47kg ~Bloodtype:O ~Sign:Aquarius ~A Sophomore at Kaibara High School.  Uo is best friends with Hana and Tohru. Kyoko Honda, Tohru's mother, influenced her to give up her life as a member of an all girl gang. Since then she has been very protective of Tohru. Her tough attitude and intimidating exterior severs to mislead many, but her close friends know that she is kind and generous.   Akito Sohma(兼人)~16-19(?) years old ~163.8cm ~43kg ~Bloodtype:AB ~Sign:Cancer ~Character Symbol:doesn't really have one ~Head of the Souma family.  It is only after assurance from Shigure(dog) that Tohru can be trusted with the family secert that she is allowed to stay. Akito has no choice but to order Tohru's mermory earsed should she fail to uphold her end of the bargain. Most of the Sohma family is afraid of Akito and will follow his orders no matter what their personal feelings may be.   Kyo Sohma(阿夾)~16-17 years old ~171.3cm ~56kg ~Bloodtype:A ~Sign:Caprion ~Character symbol:Cat ~A Sophomore at Kaibara High School.  Kyo spent months perfecting his martial arts skills desiring to finally defeat Yuki, a goal that consumes him like nothing else. A member of the Sohma clan, Kyo too transforms into an animal-the cat. The difference is that the cat is left out of the Chinese Zodiac. He is foul Tempered, brash, rough, and rude, but deep down some belive he is not as bad as he pretends to be.   Yuki Sohma(由希)~16-17 years old ~170.5cm ~54kg ~Bloodtype:A ~Sign:Virgo ~Character Symbol:Mouse ~A Sophomore at Kaibara High School.  Yuki, the 'Prince of Kaiwaia High' is attractive and popular. So popular, infact, that he has his own fan club run by girls of the high school. But he does not let any girl get close to him, and for good reason. Clever and quick witted, Yuki's natural charm and sharp, witty demeanor make him an appealing friend. Ever curious, he welcomes a challenge. Born on the year in the rat, his biggest rival is Kyo(the cat).   Hatsuharu Sohma(阿春), 'Haru'~15-16 years old ~170.2cm ~57.5kg ~Bloodtype:O ~Sign:Cancer ~Character Symbol:Cow ~Freshman at Kaibara High School.  Haru and Kyo have been rivals for a long time due in large part to Haru's split personality. His darker side, often called Black-Haru changes the usually stone faced boy into a vengeful, raging madman.   Kisa Sohma(杞紗)~12-13 years old ~145cm ~32kg ~Bloodtype:A ~Sign:Pisces ~Character Symbol:Tiger ~Freshman in Junior High School.  Kisa is unusually shy and self-conscious for her age, 12, because of constant teasing by her classmates. She has a very good relationship with her mother, who is very supportive of her daughter's situation.   Momiji Sohma(紅葉)~15-16 years old ~155.8cm ~47.5kg ~Bloodtype:O ~Character Symbol:Rabbit ~Freshman at Kaibara High School.  Momiji instantly likes Tohru and is very happy that she knows their family secert. He is gentle and playful, and is always ready to offer a kind word. He lives with an incredible secert even more amazing than his family's curse. He accepts his fate and vows to always remenber everyone who has touched his life.   Hatori Sohma(波鳥)~27 years old ~182cm ~69kg ~Bloodtype:A ~Sign:Cancer ~Character Symbol:Dragon ~Doctor.  When Akito decides that a person is to have their memory erased in order to protect the Sohma secert, Hatori is the man to do it. The Sohma curse has caused him much pain in the past and only wishes that anyone outcide the family stay away from the secert that could ruin their life.   Ayame Sohma(綾女)~27 years old ~175cm ~63kg ~Bloodtype:O ~Sign:Sagittarius ~Character Symbol:Snake ~Tailor and Store owner.  Ayame is the loud, egotistical, and over-dramatic member of the Sohma family. He is also Yuki's older brother. One of the oldest cursed members of the family, the flirtatious Ayame.   Hiro Soham(燈路)~11-12 years old ~150cm ~38kg ~Bloodtype:AB ~Sign: Leo ~Character Symbol:Sheep ~6th grader in Elementary School.  Hiro Sohma certainly lacks nothing in the way of self-confidence. He is in many ways the opposite of Kisa, with whom he feels a strong bond.   Ritsu Sohma(利凈)~20-21years old ~174.3cm ~59kg ~Bloodtype:AB ~Sign:Capricorn ~Character Symbol:Monkey ~Junior at a University.  Ritsu dresses in woman's clothing to cover up his own feelings of inadequacy. He feels that he is not particularly bright, strong, or athletic, and is therefore a disappointment to his family.   Shigure Sohma(紫吳)~27 years old ~178cm ~68.5kg ~Bloodtype:AB ~Sign:Scorpio ~Character Symbol:Dog ~Novelist .  At 27 years old, Shigure is on of the oldest members of the Sohma Family. A writer, he is easy going, all around nice guy who enjoys interacting in the lives of his younger family members. Born in the year of dog, Shigure is always smiling, kidding around, and offering advice in his own unique way. He is a good listener with keen sense of right or wrong. He is able to keep the most private of secrets, and will never let anyone down.   Kagura Sohma(樂羅)~18-19 years old ~160.5cm ~51kg ~Bloodtype:B ~Sign: Cancer ~Character Symbol:Boar ~Freshman at a Womens' College .  A few years older than Tohru, Kagure violently declares her love for Kyo. Usually sweet and caring, Kagura is quick to snap Kyo back in line. She belives they are meant for each other because they do not transform into their Zodiac when they embrace. That, and the fact that she threatened Kyo with death if he did not agree to the bargain.   *Note i dun have Isuzu Sohma(小鈴)(horse) and Kureno Sohma(紅野)(chicken) Profile!Sry....

        You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
