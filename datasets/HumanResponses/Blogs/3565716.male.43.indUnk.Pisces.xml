      At last the events of last week are calming down. We have time to remember ourselves in all the fray of the past, to look forward with renewed strength. Our undiminished search for happiness still continues. We all look forward to our freedom and independence. Be empowered be unity!

      Men stop war to make gods sometimes. Peace gods, who would make Earth a haven. A place for men to think and love and play. No war to cloud their minds and hearts. Stop somehow, men from being men.  Gods make war to stop men form becoming gods. Without the beat of drums to stop our ears, what heaven we could make of Earth! The anchor that is war left behind? Somehow free to  stop war? Gods make men to be somewhat like them. So men express their godliness in war. To take life: this is what gods do. Not the womanly urge to make life. Nor the simple sense to stop.  War-men make gods. To stop those gods from raging, we have to find the heart and head to make new gods, who don't take men in human sacrifice. New gods, who find disgust in war.  Gods stop, to make men war for their amusement. We can stop their fun. We can make new gods in human guise. No need to call to heaven. Just take plain men and show them the heaven they could make!  To stop God's wars! Men make their own destiny. We don't need war to prove to anyone that we are men. But even that is not enough. To stop war, we have to become more. To stop war, we have to become gods.                  To stop war, make men gods.  -JOE HALDEMAN: FOREVER FREE

      Most of us have seen miles of news reels from Iraq. We get to see the same story unfolding at it's ponderous pace daily. Only to be told that those people have a different system then us. That they expect us to leave them alone or at least act the way the do. That some times crimes happen in the name of their greater good and that they only partial care weather they have all the world support that they could. Does any of this sound familiar? It should! I think that rhetoric like this must come to an end. If only to make news viewing more palatable.

      To me this has been an eventful weekend. With all that's going on in the world today sometimes it is trouble to think of heros during the normal course of the day. But the last few days have rubbed our faces in it. We should remember that strength and honor exist weather we feel up to the challange or not and that what we do as individuals is not unimportant. These events remind us that "An act of kindness is not an act of weakness" and that we should not think of it as such. We all want a better tommorrow and we must remember how to get it. Honestly.

      For most of the last month, while the world has been concentrating on the elections, the war, the saturn probe or anything else that the media might send our way, I have concerned myself with meeting women. However similar these two things might seem they are not! While the worlds attentions are distracted by conflict, I am confidently persuing a state of grace which goes beyond the vocabulary of words themself. I wish a ...... heck if I know what I wish.
