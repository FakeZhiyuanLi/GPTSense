						    Owain flexed his muscles one more time but the pain seemed to never go away. it was useless. he cursed. even lifting his hand felt like fighting an invisible rope. he cursed again. he felt terribly stupid. " i should have stayed in bed!" he said outloud for the squirrels' benefit. and he cursed.  that morning, Owain had raised early to do his usual chores around his father's farm. as usual, he had had his warm oatmeal and honey by Awena's fireplace as she rushed about getting his father's meal in order. now, that morning seemed years away.

						   ... darkness, she stepped foward into the darkness surrounding the glen that had been her home for all eternity. she wasn't scared even though the shadows enveloped her and she couldn't even see as far as her chest... a rank smell took hold of her nose and mouth... foul stench.  she turned back for a moment, only to see her father's dwellings disappear in the unfolding blackness. if she hadn't been walking on something, she could have sworn there was no ground beneath her feet. ... hours seemed to pass as she walked in what she believed to be a straight line. by now, her face, hands and neck seemed to be bit by the freezing cold and she wondered if ever she would look upon the moons and stars again. castaway from all that she held dear, but not afraid. ... eons with no sound, no light, nothing to part her from her thoughts. she thought she was growing mad with nothing to occupy her mind while it reeled at all that was not... and still that acid taste in her mouth, that raunch scent in her nose... ... at last, a dim light seemed to be seen in the distance... she ran towards it, or it seemed that she made the motion to run... she ran for minutes, hours, the dim light mantained its size, for all she knew, it could be leagues and leagues away... but still she ran... her hands, face and neck seemed like big hulks of ice clinging desperately from her body.  "if i don't get out soon, i will die", the tought made a small pearl cry out of her slanted eyes. then, she remembered a lesson of her childhood: the queen sitting on her throne, and her own frustration over making a small arrowhead fly, the soft laughter of the queen... her face flushed now as it did then, "how will you ever lead us, if you can't understand the power of your own will?" and those words worked again now as they had then: she simply willed herself out of the darkness... a minute later she stood in broad daylight, a meadow before her and Debarragh Forest behind her.
