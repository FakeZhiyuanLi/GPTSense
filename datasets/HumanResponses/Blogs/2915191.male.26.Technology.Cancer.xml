      Somehow lately I have managed to frequent the house of my friend Scott quite a bit.  See I have no cable and he has graciously let me watch a couple of hockey games at his house this week.  It's always fun hangin' out with Scott and his family.  There is never a dull moment at their house.  Here is the best part of all though...  Katie's cooking!!!  Last night she made barbecue chicken on the grill and it was amazing.  I am not a huge fan of chicken breast because it tends to get dry, but not Katie's chicken.  It was moist and delicious.  I got to give a big shout of props out to Katie today.  Every time we have a get together at Scott's house she seems to magically put together a great tasting meal.  In fact that seems to be the only time I ever get a home-cooked meal.  Other than that I am a fast-food junkie.  Believe me when I say I would have a Katie cooked meal over fast food anytime.  Anyways, thanks for every single meal you have ever cooked for me.  I truly appreciate it.  On a side note...  I got food poisoning from a pizza I ordered from Dominos a couple of weeks ago.  Just one more reason that I would rather have Katie's cooking.

      Some pictures leave me speechless.  This  urlLink cat  has some of the craziest eyes I have ever seen.

      I am a single guy and still looking for a woman to eventually spend my life with (this is not a personal ad).  I have dated my share of okays and maybes, but have yet to date someone that makes me want to spend my life with them.  One thing that always seems to get me is the girl's name.  It sounds superficial and probably is, but if a girl has a bad sounding name I just cant make it work.  Here is some examples of names that make me go Ughhh!  In no particular order:  Rhonda, Linda, Debra/Debbie, Sandra/Sandy, Bernadette, Patricia/Patty, Gilberta (yup, that is an actual name), Amanda, Annette, Andrea, Billie, Tracy, and many more I can't think of at this time, but as I do I will add them to the list.  Here are some names I love.  Again, in no particular order:  Anna, Anne, Lindsay, Summer, Laura, Lauren, Stephanie, Carrie, Alisa, Emily, Jennifer, Jessica, Ashley, Brooke, Madison, Angela, Shannon, and more I am sure.  I will add to this list as I remember them.  Even though this sounds really picky it isn't as bad as it used to be.  I used to only like names that started with A, S, or L.  Now, I have a better understanding of something... who knows what though.  Now my two favorite female names are Kayley and  urlLink Annalise , but I will use those to name my daughters.  So, I will not be looking for a wife with those names.  Leave a comment with the female names you like/dislike the most.
