      Hoshi wandered about the old mansion searching for her beloved Ukchan. Every footsteps she took picked up tons of dust swirling around her. Coughing she stumbled forward leaning on a wall till the dust cleared. After the dust was settled, Hoshi looked around and spied on a stairs she never noticed before. The girl sensed a strange delight creeping up on her as she made her way up the stars. Something was going to happen, she could tell. At the top of the stairs was a small trap door. Hoshi pushed it open and stepped into the crisp night air. A movement caught her eye as she emerged. Ukchan turned in the full moonlight to see who was there. His body had a crystalline glow around it in the moon as her turned and his short blue hair turned to diamond in Hoshi's eyes. As he spotted her. The deep brown eye of Ukchan drilled right into Hoshi's soul as he stood searching her. The females min and heart told her to run to him, but her body didn't listen. All was still. suddenly Hoshi came into herself and dashed forward, her legs becoming weaker and tears streaming from her eyes. She drew nearer and near when her legs gave out. Hoshi started to fall, fall right into Ukchan's strong arms. Her heart skipped not one, not two, but three beats as Ukchan stopped the fall. She didn't dare move for a moment feeling she might wake from a dream if she did. Ukchan gently wrapped his arms around her and pulled her tight to him. Hoshi help her breath as she buried her face in her soft shirt and linked arms around him. She relaxed when Ukchan;s torso softened and leaned on his chest. Hoshi was in a dream like daze as her worries fell away. Squirming a little in the arms that help her firm yet gentle she looked up and caught Ukchan looking down at her with a small curved smile. She lovingly smiled back at him with teary eyes. Taking then a chance Ukchan leaned down, closing his eyes and met lips with Hoshi in a kiss so heavenly and pure that the world instantly feel away from them. Their bodies grew hot as they shared their warmth and seemed to melt into one another, Hoshi closed her eyes and started to kiss Ukchan back putting slender arms around his neck. Both felt as if they could stay like that forever, but Ukchan pulled back after some seconds. Hoshi opened her eyes and looked at Ukchan with the slighest blush streaking her face. Nothing in the world could have beaten that first kiss.

      ((I wonder how far this will go... and uhh... sorry about the spelling.. they took Spell cheak off >  You start to fly hard, fly faster. Every fiber of your being is set on getting more of that precious life-giving substance. You could still taste the salty sweatness in your mouth and you savor it for as long as possible. The lust consums you in it's dark abyss. Soaring over the fiery forest of death you smell the blood of an innocent. The blood of a child mingled with fear, yet some bravery. The young one was drawing closer to you and you lose all control you may have had over your body. You swifty and silently float down to the forest floor and hid in a rose bush as red as the blood you lust for so infinitely. The child makes it's way into a clearing making it's self vulnerable to even the slightest of dangers. You studdy the child with your darking eyes and find little threat other then it carries a small dagger by it's side. The child stumbles a little to close to your hidding place and you get a good smell of it's blood and great fear. The lust takes a new killing hold on you and you leap out at it in a rush of rose pettles floating harmlessly around you. For a splite second the world is frozen in it's own evil as the darkness consums the child. It screams so earsplitting the next moment before you slash at it's windpipe killing it instantly. Blood poors out of it staining the ground red as you start to bite deeply into the wound, lapping up all the newly killed life withen. With bloodlust becomeing even more over powering you turn animal like in your feeding and gorge yourself so deeply that no other feelings can get though.

      ((I hope you don't mind, I continued the story.. add on as well! We could collaborate on it, that would be cool ^^)) Currents of warm air swell and gather underneath your ebony-furred wings, pushing you up, up, higher and higher in a spiraling motion until you think you shall faint from the height. Meaningless patterns of light dance on the inside of your eyes, a fireworks show only for you. You cough. Again and again you try to purge your throat of the sticky-sweet smoke, but it clings to your windpipe like molasses. Your mind starts to becoming weak, driven by the need for clean air it throws its last reserve of energy to your new wings, flapping madly to send you shooting out of the foul, odorous cloud. You break through. There it is- clean air! It seems like a miracle to you as you gleefully inhale the crisp, cold evening atmosphere. But something's not right.. your tongue runs along the top of your mouth before passing along your two canine teeth.. a salty substance trickles from the cut caused by the needle-like point of your tooth. And as the blood flows over your tongue your mind is sent into a frenzy. That was it.. you needed it! Blood! You craved it, you lusted for it, HAD to have it. It was your source of energy.. this newfound realization terrified the corner of your brain still conscious. But soon your mind is captivated by the lusting presence inside of you. Forgetting the forest, forgetting the flames, the corpses, the curse, you beat the air. Wind streams past your face as you cut through the air toward where your instincts told you blood was. Where humans were.. where there would be people to provide you with your means to live.. that is what you longed for. For now, you were not human but a creature of shadow, a vampire..

           Far in the dark night. When all hope is lost. The screech of an owl, the howl of a wolf. You shake as you steep deeper into the forest. The air starts to get colder and yet somehow, more evilly delicious. You come to an ancient clearing showered with sliver from the full moon staring down at it, at you. Your skin prickles and you turn around. Bloody rotting corpses are hanging from each tree. Each body hung from organs strangled around their neck. They seem to be staring right at you. You run! Fast. But nothing could take the curse on you. Nothing will change you back. You start to go though a transformation. Your ears become long and pointed. Your K9 teeth become sharper and longer. As your nails grow great black wings burst the skin on your back.  Screaming in pain you keep running, right into a corpses hanging from a tree. It seems to put it's dead cold arms around you and not let go. Nothing could help you, nothing would save you. You shut your eyes trying to believe nothing is happening, the world is fine, but as soon as your eyes even slightly open you are still being held onto by the corpses. Turning back to the trees trying to break the grip your eyes grow even wider with fear. The whole forest is burning. The sky is alight with dancing flame. The corpses disappears as you try to run the other way only to find that you are blocked in. Trees fall ablaze to the ground starting the grass on fire. You can't get out. You will die and forever this evilly holy land will be your ashes grave. In your vain attempt to escape you leap into the heating air and your wings take flight. Higher and higher into the smoky air that's clogging your lungs.

      Ok so this is the dream I had last night. It is really mushy and stuff and the best non-vampire dream I've ever had! ^^ Beware! Fluffy things included!  Oky so... It's like this: It started In school and stuff, right? Yea there was this ride thing in this building. Some of my friends and I went in it and like it was a conveyer belt with trash on it splitting into to was as it went. The trash goes one way and people go other way. But like we were on it and this really big bog of beer type thing went on it and got stuck with broke the ride so my friends and I just walked and sat watching the movie they were playing in there on this great pull down T.V thing. *Movie unknown*. Yea. Then we left and separated. *later* I went back in and sat down bored watching movie. *Beware! This is where fluffy comes in!* This insanely hot boy comes in and sits right by me! I mean WOW! Short black hair kinda anime style and stuff and eyes and tall and OMG! I can't describe his hotness (and in the dream he is also the person that plays Ukchan). I look at him knowing him and like, I have a crush on him. He looks at me and I look at him and stuff. He says to me in his warm voice type thing, "I've always liked you" And I'm all OMG! I love him! And stuff. And like yea. He takes my hand and like yea. He hold hands there and stuff. I lean on his shoulder. And then like yea soon we get up and like walk out holding hands and stuff and I'm all ^^. I start walking in front of him holding both his hands with both mine leaning back on his chest and stuff. And we are just like walking that ways across the quad. There we meet his friends and he talks to them and stuff and I break away from him to go tell my other friends. And like I find friends and things (Bekka and Annie fer some reason) and I tell them and there just like "No fair!-_-; My Ukchan" and I'm all (^-^)v yea. I go back  and another friend runs up to me and are all like "How did you get Mat? (name of boy)" and I'm all like "I was myself" type thing. And then I go back to him and I spend the rest of the dream in his arms. The End!

      Okay, so I finally had a dream!  It started out.. I'm not quite sure. But it ended up in this farmer's market type of thing, where lots of inventors are selling a whole bunch of junk. So, I'm there for a bit, then I go back to this.. camping.. place. Sort of. There's a barn-ish-shed-thing-of-doom where cars are parked and stuffs like that. And so we're all gathered by this freakin' AWESOME anime guy, looks like Crim from .hack//SIGN only wearing leather.. black leather.. mm.. :9 Anyway. And he's like, in front of this hill, and saying that there's a fire coming our way. A few seconds later, fire comes ROARING over the hill. People are all screaming and running for their cars and all, so we (we being my mother and father and I) hop into an old-style white beetle and get to the road. Then I look over and I'm all "O_O OMIGOSH WHERE'S BOY?" And my mom just turns to me all calm-like and says, "Oh, he must have died."  So I start freaking out, and my parents don't even seem to care. I hop outta the car and race back toward the barn-ish-shed-thing-of-doom, which is on fire. And people are just.. standing in it not caring. -_- So I start shouting, "BOY! BOY! PETER! WHERE ARE YOU?" He just walks out (Point of interest: he's got glasses on in my dream, but normally he's got contacts) calmly and gives me 'that look' that shuts me up pretty fast. So we all get back in the white beetle and are driving down the highway when suddenly the 'rents turn off of the road onto a.. golf course.  We're just drivin' down the golf course when suddenly it becomes a cliff. And at the bottom of the cliff we see.. more golf course. Well, we can't stop ourselves now, we go flying off of the edge, then land. Boy and I crash through the windshield and start.. uh..  flying.  Like we were shot out of a cannon, you know? And the land below us becomes so teeeeeny tiny, and we hit the ground and it doesn't hurt at all. Then we get up to find mum'n dad.. then I woke up.  ...I have the oddest dreams.. >_>

      Ok this odd dream has to do with wolvies!!! YAY! Many odd things in here! Funfun!!  So it starts off with me and my brother in my room just sitting when my mother and some random lady person comes in. They sit at a table that is at the foot of my bed in my dream and look at us. We look at them. Mother dear tells us that we re wolves!! And we are all like YAY! ^^ *bouncy bouncy bouncy *! And the lady person is all nice and gives us papers to fill out. Something about mating season. Well like. We don't have time to fill it out and we go to this place. We walk right next door to the old school, but as we are walking it changes to a forest. There we find wolves everywhere! hundreds of wolves! And like, most of them are really thin with their face and body so I change into a beautiful pure black wolf (most of the other wolves were brown) and like I walk down there. Here I look around and see the lovely brown wolf. Not thin like the others and not fat. Just, perfect. I run up to him "Hello? Hi? Heeeelllllooooo?" But before he can answer me some random werewolf in his human form blows a whistle and we all have to line up just like in the old school! Then like, I look for that wolf I was trying to talk to, but I can't find him. After that we went home and got the papers to fill out again. I started to fill it out like my brother, but he finished first (because most of the time he was trying to sit on my paper). When the lady comes back from where ever she was I showed her my paper and she gives me another one after telling my brother to not do that. I try to fill it out again, but for some reason I was not sitting at the table. I soon lay my paper down again just to take a break when my brother comes over and sits on it and tears it. I'm all "grrr" The lady comes in and I show her my paper and shes all "*sigh* I didn't think it would take you THIS long to fill it out." I get the paper and sit at the table and do the second question then look at the first. It says to write your parents and grand parents and great grand parents madden names and I'm all "What the heck? Do we have to do the first one?" and the lady is all "No, you can skip that one." So I do most of the paper before I wake up. OHH! Wasn't that fun? Being a wolf was the best thing I have ever felt. OH! I want a continuation of that dream!!!

      Ok, so last night I had many odd dreams and I will tell you two here. So like yea. This one has pirates and kids in it! On with the dream!!!  It started I was on a huge boat in the middle of an ocean with my mom and like 11 daycare kids. All the daycare kids were like doing this course where they climbed things, crawled on things, and slide down things to nursery music. Then like my mom was wearing a scary red dress. Then after all the daycare kids were done we went down below the deck to uhh.... change into different outfits. Well my mom brought out this patriotic dress and then a really REALLY big american flag. Well I thought it was for twirling like in color guard, but then she took it off the poll and rapped it around my head like a bandana. So I'm like ooook... Then like I went up with five kids and like these pirates started to board our ship. They grabbed the five kids for slaves then wanted more. I tried to fight them but they soon got five more. With these they took out these needles (sowing) and pocked each kid and each one died. One little boy was left. I took him to the front of the boat and told him to stay, but he followed me anyway. I got mad at him but then the pirates took out other needles (doctor) and stabbed him. Then I woke up. Isn't that nice? Well, yeah sure, I mean. The kids are gone now right???

      Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she’s gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you’re gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.

Yes he wore a cowboy hat// Each bone broken in his back// All the money and all the gold// Couldn't buy my love at 8 years old// Now I'm in love with a girl thats wrong for me// Ask her, she will disagree// Her father was a small time man// With small time dreams and small time hands// But// But I was there when there was nobody home// Please believe me when i say i dunno// Gone for good in fact but what does it mean// Within a year they always sold and bought//  Easy enough to just look at her// Whole world on a silver platter// Was that that bad for me// If I was there the scotch is free// Won round one but its not over// He don't care cause he don't know her// True love is not the same// If I could lend a hand in shame//  But I was there when there was nobody home// Please believe me when i say i dunno// Gone for good infact but what does it mean// Within a year they always sold and bought//  If I was big// So much easier to see// Don't hide from me// That which I've already seen// You lie to me// More than occasionally// Don't lie to me// You lied to me//  I'm as high as I'll ever be// I don't mind, Stay and see// They've all gone, Why don't we// Holding hands, you and me// But I'm as high as i'll ever be// But later on, lies to see// My past is gone, only from me// I'm alive//  But I was there when there was nobody home// Please believe me when I say I dunno// Gone for good infact but what does it mean// Within a year they always sold and bought//  Remember when it was me// Driving come down just for me// And then we'll try as we've been//  Heh heh heh... we lurv that song! It's so awesome! But then again... we have our other reasons for liking it, eh Chibichan Ryu? ^_^ Love and Peace Out!  ~SDchan Hoshi... neh?

      Yup. You guessed it. It's time for me to update all of my Blogs, and I.. DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY. This is just a waste of your time. Don't bother reading it. It's just a little something I'm putting here to make me feel better. It makes me feel like I actually updated all of the Blogs that I have. So... you can ignore this. Yup. If something interesting pops up, then I'll post it. Yep. So.. if you're still reading this, then you're stupid. Well.. not really stupid. You just have a lot of time on your hands. Am I right? Tell me I'm right. Ah, jeez, I have WAY too much time on MY hands. I'm such a loser. Chibichan Ryu... in your next post, beat some sense into me. Please? x_x;; Love and Peace Out, for now! ^_^;;  ~SDchan Hoshi... neh?

      Okays, I've been getting into the hang of updating all of my zoomyful Blogs at one time, almost every day, so now I'll be posting on here WAY more often. ^_^ Buwahaha.. okay, anyway. Here's a song that we like by... you guessed it! Sarah McLachlan! We loff/lurv her, yush we do. ^_^ She's really good at capturing the mood in her songs. Here you go! "Full of Grace," go download it, OR ELSE!  The winter here's cold, and bitter// it's chilled us to the bone// we haven't seen the sun for weeks// too long too far from home// I feel just like I'm sinking// and I claw for solid ground// I'm pulled down by the undertow// I never thought I could feel so low// oh darkness I feel like letting go//  If all of the strength and all of the courage// come and lift me from this place// I know I could love you much better than this// full of grace// full of grace// my love//  So it's better this way, I said// having seen this place before // where everything we say and do// hurts us all the more// its just that we stayed, too long in the same old sickly skin// I'm pulled down by the undertow// I never thought I could feel so low// oh darkness I feel like letting go//  If all of the strength and all of the courage// come and lift me from this place// I know I could love you much better than this// full of grace// full of grace// my love//  Well... there it is! Read the lyrics, download and listen to the song.. then reflect on this. It's good for your creative thinking. Maybe after deeply thinking and reflecting, you'll even get it. Nah. It's not that easy to understand. Your loss. Tata! ^_^  Love and Peace Out! ~SDchan Hoshi... neh?

      Well, I got some art. Woo woo, yay!   urlLink Nekomori  Part of a trade with  urlLink Sekora , it's her character Nekomori. Just sitting in a tree, chillin'. Haven't colored it yet because I don't know what colors she is (hint hint Sekora..) ^^ The only thing that makes me angry about it is the fact that when I inked it with my crappy cheap pens, the staff got messed up.. but I can fix that when I color it using Photoshop. So, overall.. not horrible.   urlLink Dalisedeni  My fan-made character from the musical CATS, looking rather cute and HAPPY. Deni's a rather HAPPY type of person... cat... Jellicle.. uh, whatever. The main point is that she's HAPPY. Only thing I don't like about this picture is the hand she has balled into a fist, it's just.. uh.. fingers = way screwed up. An' I was trying to make it look like she was holding her arm out straight toward the hypothetical camera. But, uh.. doesn't look like that worked. Either way, though, Deni is HAPPY!!!  ^_____________________^

      ((Just a free-verse poem I wrote a few days ago.. it doesn't rhyme or have any apparent rythm..))   Forever  You are like a beacon to me Your smile, your face, your eyes They call to me They tell of safety, they tell of love Tell me that all I need to do is to get to you To feel whole If I could I would run to you Never leave your side Tell me how to get to you, and I'll come Just tell me when...  Give me half a chance I'll fill you with warmth Just give me the courage I lack I'll stay by you Lead me through the hard times I'll give you all the good All I would ever want in the world Is to be here in your arms- Forever  I see you when I close my eyes It gets me through each day That taunting vision of someone so dear Could it be a sign? I need but to think of you To feel that things will be all right But that emotion isn't good enough I need to hear your voice telling me so before I know it's true I know if I was near you I'd never have to fear Won't you please show me how?  All I need is a word I'd give you all I am Just safeguard my soul for me It will give you the happiness you deserve Tell me it's all right, show me the way I'll make you feel whole day after day You're my breath, my sight, my hope And all I need is you- Forever

      Dark... it was... dark.  But the mottled light that cascaded down from the fissures in the wall, the flecks of light was what made it all okay..  It made it okay to the dragonlet that dozed, hidden from the casual eye by the overhanging rock ledge. She wasn't old per se.. well, not for a dragon at least. Somewhere between two centuries and three, if not three and four was she. But, compared to the rest of the dragon race, she was young. Considered thirteen, at best.. and only then if one was feeling generous.  But the little azure reptilian creature, she was not the proper size...  She was small.  Miniscule.   A runt, which is the name that many of the older dragons gave her. She had been undersized ever since birth. Due to one faulty gene, one gene in her entire body out of the millions housed there, the one faulty gene that had the ability to change her appearance completely. When one her age would be by now roughly the size of a small school bus, she was instead about the size of a house cat.  Size aside, though, she had the looks of a dragon.. blue scales made up armored skin, lethal spikes ripped from the very tip of her nose all the way down the base of her spine to her foot-long, whiplike tail. The two scaly bat-wings that shot out from her shoulder-blades, the span longer than her body itself but right now, folded tight against her back like a tortoise shell. The deft, four fingered hand-like paws, each nimble digit accented by sharpened keratin stakes of claws. The strong back haunches of the creature like loaded springs, feline.. almost. Her mouth, the elongated front canines that protruded from her mouth to give her the look of danger even when asleep, the row of needle-sharp chompers housed within.. Even the lizard eye, golden, ever-searching, now covered by a filmy eyelid as well as the tough outer lid, out of the same material that her skin was.  Yes, she was without a doubt a dragon. It would be nigh impossible to mistake her for anything but, if it were not for her size. One would immediately assume she was instead a fire lizard instead of dragon.. if they were not familiar with the species. One with just a touch of knowledge on the subject would know by the ridge of spikes, the shape of her head that she was indeed dragon.  A Blue Dragon.. the race of dragon most commonly dealing with liquids, with the life-giving substance on this planet.. Water..  ((TBC- to be continued..))

      Ryu-chan's creative works needed a home for their own..  I'm just picky that way.  ^-^  Whether or not I update this frequently, it will be a place to house my poems, stories, art... etc etc.

      jinopets.com has some cool looking pets, but not many! It's maps seem a little ill drawn and the games are few, but it also has good chat! Go see!  veropets.com is really odd. It has somewhat of a choice fer pets and you can have 3. The pets seem... odd. They seem mostly to be made from parts of other animals in life. Then the map. Most of the places dont work, but hey, it's a growing site!  furry-paws.com is a very odd sitee. It has nothiing but dogs, lots of dogs. Over 100 to pick from. These are realy life dog breeds. Then, after you find where to get them (It's kind hard to) you can change it's pic. The place has jobs you can chose from and games and stuff. Overall it's on odd oky-ish site.  muchopets.com is really odd. The pets are 3D-ish and moving! That's a new one. There are NO games and the site is confusing. It's a slightly OK site, but I wouldnt tell anyone to join it.

      I went and saw The Bourne Supremecy today with Diane and Amy B. after the three of us stayed at Amy's house for the night.  Pillow fights, projector screens, loud movies, a raid-able pantry, an ELEVATOR(gonna live in it when I'm living on my own), what more could you want?  Oh. The Bourne Supremecy?  Highly  recommended. I'm still unsure if I like it better or worse than the first movie.. It's definitely got more fighting/car chase action scenes. Less of a 'Who Am I' and more of a 'What Am I.' It was fun.. but, uh, good times, good times!

      I think this post pretty much sums up the  very  intriguing RP I had today...  Sasuke~ continued staring off into space until he blinked once, again. Someone was intruding upon his white haze..  his  reality. It blurred, before finally snapping into focus. He was back in the tavern.. he was back in the tavern, and he could hear Kaiuri's words. In disbelief he centered his gaze on the girl who had stuck her face in front of his. He just gaped at her, like he could not comprehend what she was saying. Uselessly his jaw worked up and down, no sound coming forth from his throat. Then he frowned, an angry look coming into his eyes. She was trying to take away  all  of his past... she was trying to wrench his  name  from him.  He would not let her!  "I am Sasuke.." he began, stopped dead by her words. ' I killed you. I ran you through with one of your own guard's weapons! ' "No, I can't have, you don't know.." ' You died that day. I watched your blood spill out like a waterfall cascading over the edge of a cliff. ' "That's not, there's no way.." But hadn't he awoken in a pool of blood, his own? No, it couldn't.. ' I watched you die. ' "You didn't.." ' I watched you take your last, shuddering breath of life. ' It can't have been.. ' I was there, you cannot trick me. I know you're not him. You're not Sasuke.. ' These words, and the rest, echoed in his skull haphazardly, each as if a separate voice shouting at him. "No, no, no...!" His forehead was touched by her hand. ' You are dead and I am alive! ' All her words between when she touched the spot where her kiss had landed years ago and when she declared that he was dead, had disappeared like the middle of his life. Just clouded by that white haze. Even before Kaiuri had finished condemning him to hell Sasuke was on his feet, the stool he had been sitting on knocked over in his anger. "Shut up!" he burst out almost childishly. Normally his shoulders were hunched, as if Sasuke just wanted to go unnoticed. But now, in all his fury, he was at his full six feet and eight inches, towering over Kai. "Just shut up! You don't know, you can't, I'm not dead! Can't you see? I'm not dead! You never killed me, I don't even  know  you! I don't know anyone, I don't.." his voice was dissolving into helplessness. "I'm not dead, I can't be, I can't.. I can't!"  But hadn't he awoken in puddle of blood..? Didn't this girl's presence cause him to fade into the white haze again? But he wasn't dead... was he?

      I went again today, so sue me. Partly because I wanted to go again, partly because I had a friend who wanted to go but under no circumstances would go by herself.. eenh. *mutterwhine*  Back on topic. So me, dad, and my friend Amy B. went. We also manage to drag along Boy, which made me happy. We get there, get tickets, go downstairs to wander. Wander wander. I'm the only person there who's been there before, and similarly I'm the only person there who actually will speak their own opinion. -_ NEVER  has an opinion anyway. *siiiigh* Off-track again >_>  First purchase: Azu Manga Daioh the manga #1 @ ADV Booth Cost: $8  It looked cute, I had seen the trailer and a music video that really amused me. I  had  to buy it. And I am SO not disappointed! ^^ Already read the whole thing, I love it to bits. I even got (gasp shock gasp) BOY to read it!! And his quote is: I never thought something so funny could be so disturbing.  Hee hee. I love Boy. He's an awesome beeg bruvver ^_^  Sooo, I'm still trying to get input from Boy or Amy as to where to go next. I finally wander over to the Tokyopop store, other two in tow, because they don't seem to care.. >_  Second purchase: Marmalade Boy #1 @ Tokyopop Booth Cost: Around $9  To be honest, I like this series.. I'm not quite sure why. Unsure as to whether or not I really  needed  to buy this, but.. I wanted to. Yes. Besides, I needed another thing to put in my uber-spiffy giganitc Tokyopop bag!! ^_____^ So, I bought it.  Yeah...  That's what I did. I finally decide Boy MUST see the booth of the people who made Munchkin, so I drag everyone over in that direction..  Boy's only purchase: Munchkin expansion set 'Clerical Errors' Cost: $17  I know Boy enjoyed himself, because he bought something ^0^ Munchkin has gotta be the most HILARIOUS card game ever, I completely love it. And I still need to steal the new cards to read what they do- half of the allure of the game is all the cards, because they are so FUNNY. (+5 Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment.. +2 Boots of Buttkicking.. +3 Spike Codpiece.. XD) So.. yeah. Boy bought something!!!  Soo, it's lunchtime, so we meet dad over at the Penny Arcade booth. Go over to Hortons plaza, get some food (AMY NEEDS TO EAT MORE -_- That's my new mission: get Amy to eat REAL food, and NOT have just a glass of milk for breakfast! no frickin' WONDER she's tired!), come back, buy Amy a new ticket after she loses hers and we failed at our attempt to sneak past the ticket-checkers. Eheh. -_-; Go over, watch anime. AZU MANGA DAIOH IS HILARIOUS. Ohmigosh. OHMIGOSH. I love it. "Chiyo-chan, why are you flying?" "I'm 10 years old!" Dad's cracking up, even BOY is, as is the rest of the crowd. XD "Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* .............. Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* ........................... Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* ..... Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* Why the heck? *whap* ......." Heh. I, must, BUY!!!  Missions were failed, as much fun as I had. They didn't have anymore Princess Mononoke cards, I didn't find the cat-eared beanie I wanted, I didn't find the bunchy socks.. T-T Oh well. Next year!!  'night all! *thunk*

      I'm not sure why I continue to post, when I doubt people actually bother to read it. e_e; I guess it's just the way I am. I like to log things, so that at later dates I can look back on these records and say 'Hey! I did that!'.. yadda yadda, you know. Oh well.. it makes me happy, I suppose.  Well, yesterday was the Comicon. It was my first time going and, needless to say, I  loved  it. I would've stayed longer than I did but.. I think the friend I went with was getting bored.. she's not as into anime as I am, although considers herself an anime artist.. enh, very confusing. Anyway, so we (we, being my dad, Katrina, and I) got there when the doors opened, but had to go get tickets. Noo problemo. So, we've got our tickets, dad leaves us with a cell phone to go wander around. Finally we find our way downstairs, to the exhibit hall. Wow, what can I say about the exhibit hall.. it's HUGE! And  VERY  busy. So, Katrina and I start to wander the booths.  First purchase: A deck of Cowboy Bebop playing cards Cost: $5  Although the cards are starting to scare me with a few of their pictures. (If you're over at my house, ask me to show you what I mean..) So tomorrow since I'm going again I'm planning to get the Princess Mononoke set, just to be safe. XD So, more wandering. Swag, free stuff, = happy Bekka. I get a free painting in traditional- Chinese, I think it was -art style, with bold brush strokes. FREE! I love it.  Second purchase: The collected Tall Tails volumes 1-3, just because the furries are cute, and Egoraven because according to Daphne Lage there's only 25 copies out Cost: $15  This was pretty much a feel-good purchase. I liked the art, I had money, I bought it. Nothing really special to it. So, we wander on a bit more, and come across a LotR booth selling authentic-looking elven knives. Katrina just HAS to get one, 'cos she's such a LotR nut. I HAVE to spot her 11 bucks, 'cos she's low on cash. e_e;; But I don't really mind, so long as I get paid back. I mean, the knife is really awesome. XD Wander down to the other end of the convention hall, by now my bag is STUFFED with swag. Which made for a very happy Bekka ^_^ Apparently we missed the Megatokyo store the first time, so we figure out its number and go to visit it.  Third purchase: Megatokyo 'ph34r t3h cute ones' poster, autographed by Fred, Sarah, and Dom. Cost: $14  This is probably the thing I loved most. I mean, AUTOGRAPHED! Besides, I've been wanting the poster. What better time to get it? I was seriously considering getting Boy a shirt, because I'm a nice l'il sister, but- c'mon. Nineteen BUCKS?! I'm not THAT nice! So I didn't get him anything. ^_____^  Got lunch, ate lunch, went upstairs to watch anime until around 3, when Katrina wanted to leave. I had a complete and total AWESOME time. Seriously guys, it was so fun. There was even someone cosplaying Tsukasa (with paper mache staff and everything!), and two old ladies as Vash and Inuyasha! (I might add, Inuyasha had toilet paper stuck to his/her sandal.. >_>) It was so fun, I can't wait until tomorrow. I get to go again!  G'night, internet!

      Trip report from Arrowbear.  Arrowbear . Arrowbear Music Camp. Woohoo!  11 days up in a pile of sticks, near Arrowhead & Big Bear. Thus the name. I'll try to keep my report short, but then again I've got a lot to say.. and I want to be able to read this at some later date and remember all the cool stuff. So, well... if it doesn't interest you, you don't have to read it. Also- it's like, near impossible for me to put all that I want to say in any coherent order, AND I have forgotten days for many of these things. So.. uh. Good luck!  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-   Day 1, Wednesday - Arrival. The place looks so foreign! It's really crowded, near impossible to park. While mum dear registers Katrina and I, we go find a bunk. Main dorm- no luck. So, down a flight of stairs to a little porch with bunks placed on it. No luck, so down a bit further to the.. pile of sticks! A cabin on the porch, in the minimalist sense of the word. Rectangular cutout for a door, square cutouts for windows with loose screens on them.. except for one. Guess who gets the top bunk where they can be assaulted by mosquitos flying in through the open window? Mmmhm. Me. Katrina's on the bottom bunk. So, we dump our junk, audition, and get to know the people there. There's four bunk beds in the cabin (not room for anything else >_x) If coming in from the main porch, my bunk would be the far left. On far right was Taylor (bottom) and Lois (top). Near left was Lindsey (bottom) and Angie (top). Near right was April (bottom) and Grace (top). Outside of the door near to me was a little 'second' porch, not the main one. As with the other, this porch was roof-less and wall-less. If coming from Cabin 1 (aka Pile 'O Sticks) near left on the single bunks was Liz the counselor, near right was a bunk on which Liz dumped her junk. Far left was Gwen, far right was the bunk on which Gwen dumped her junk. Then, at the end at a perpendicular to the other bunks, was Annie. And those were the porch-ers and the Cabin 1-ers. Although technically Cabin 1 was the people in Liz's group, which would be Liz, Annie, Gwen, Katrina, Lois, Taylor and I. Instead of having a cushy dorm like the rest (excluding the other -nicer- stickpile and the main porch) we had to face the elements and other disasters. e_e; We had a sort of pride thing going on by the end of the session. ((According to them this was a gianormous session with 150+ kids, I get the feeling they don't use the porch much))  First dinner was spaghetti. Our group sat in a circle on the ground, got to know each other after being forced to by the counselors, then learned about Liz the counselor. Liz is nearsighted, 21, and.. uh... stuff. I don't exactly remember anymore.  And thus ends an eventful day..   Day 2, Thursday - All that really stands out about this day is, when waiting in line for breakfast, I almost passed out. No, I'm not kidding. I guess it was the elevation + lack of food + lack of drink + lack of sleep that did it. But, when standing on the porch outside of the mess hall, I felt very sick. No, VERY sick. Soon I felt dizzy, then black started creeping in from the edges of my eyes like has happened before- but that's more or less normal for me. Anyway, according to Katrina I took a step backward and fell into a tree. (( urlLink THE TREE )) But I was saved from falling by Katrina and one of the counselors.. Jeff, I think. After that I surprisingly felt better, although directly after regaining my footing the whole world was in black and white, I'm not exaggerating.. I wasn't out for any amount of time, I didn't even lose consciousness. But, man.. it was exciting! After the fact, I can honestly say I sort of enjoyed it. Yes, yes, I am weird. But it was an experience. The rest was just a normal day, pretty much. We learned where we sat in band. I'm a 1st chair. We had 1st chairs and 2nd chairs. Although the unofficial section leader of the alto saxes was Alex, the scarily-good owner of a silver saxophone. I sat on the end, next to the bassoons and this guy, uhh.. I think his name was Mike. Yeah. That was my day.  We also had an egg drop.. no eggies lived T-T LONG LIVE THE TREE! Half the counselors were 'aliens' and half were 'dinosaurs.' It was scary. Ergh-eth!  Oh, and a basic day at Arrowbear. Although I don't have all the times..  7:15 AM - Reveille courtesy of Toshi the trumpet counselor. Prepare for breakfast, which starts as soon as you haul yourself out of bed. 7:15 AM - Breakfast (KP on days you had KP) 8:00 AM - Clean-up (or bathroom duty, if you have it) ?:?? AM - Morning Assembly ?:?? AM - Rehearsal #1, lasting for an hour ?:?? AM - Break ?:?? AM - Rehearsal #2, hour-long 12:00 AMish - Lunch (KP on days you had KP) 1:30 PM - Lunch Assembly 2:00 PM - Rec Time (woohoo!) Usually lasts for two-to-three hours. During this time there was optional crafts, hikes to Happy Gap, and the snack bar was open. Also on certain days the pool was open. ?:?? PM - Rest (One hour, I believe). According to Liz you could either read, listen to music, sleep or pretend to sleep. e_e; Around 5 or 6 PM - Dinner (KP on days you had KP) ?:?? PM - Evening assembly ?:?? PM - Rehearsal #3, one-hour ?:?? PM - Evening program, variable 9:30-10:00 PM - Campfire 10:30 PM - Taps again by Toshi  Busy busy busy!   Day 3, Friday - (I think) KP. You get to cut the lunch line, but you also have to wash the stupid dishes. I had to put away pots and pans that had been washed, rinsed, and sanitized which really wasn't as easy as it might sound. I think I got the job 'cause I was tall and could reach where to put things. Anyway, we got a rather bad boy's group to work with (one girls cabin group and one boys worked on KP at a time). Of the four stations for pots and pans one was occupied by me, one by Katrina, one by drummer Clay, and one by viola Daniel. And do you want to know what those stupid little sevvies did to us? Got us SOPPING wet in sanitizer water!! I swear, at one point in time then took the sanitizer water nozzle, pointed it at Katrina and I, and turned on the stupid flow! As well as splashing us endlessly. It took ages for anything to get done. And I took several (if not more) sponges upside the head. At one point I calmly picked up the sponge that had been thrown at me, walked over, and wrung it out over Clay's head. It was very pro of me. The counselors applauded. Oh- that reminds me. The counselors were standing by, LAUGHING at us as we got soaked!! Grr... \_/;;  And it was even worse. Viola Daniel had, at one point, gotten hold of a pair of tongs. And, instead of putting it in the sanitizer like anyone SANE would do, he started banging it against the metal sink rim singing at the top of his lungs, "Na na na na, na na, na na can't touch this!" AAARGH! I was dreeee-eeee-eeenched by the end of KP. Literally fscking dripping weeet. It pissed me off so badly T-T.   Day 4, Saturday - Bathroom duty. I had to do the toilets, which were surprisingly clean. So I was lucky. Now this gives me the perfect opportunity to describe the bathrooms.  They weren't BAD, per se.. but they could have been a hell of a lot better. There were 6 toilet stalls, only one having a lock that >worked   Day 5, Sunday - Inspirational. I had to draw a picture of someone who inspired me. So, I drew Boy. Okay, you're giving the monitor strange looks, but he's the reason I got into music in the first place! (He took up the trumpet in fifth grade while I was in third, I was jealous, by the summer after 3rd I had taken up the saxophone. Not exactly ideal, but..) So, that went well. Ish. Well-ish. Because we had to share in front of the rest of the camp.. But I found it amusing that almost all the boy cabins did skits while the girl cabins did artistic things. Heh-heh-heh.   Day 6, Monday - The first hike-by-number! With Kate and (I think) Ted we split into groups to do various activities. And so today was with Kate and.. Ted? I think. I think. So we played the Shadow Game. Two people had to work together to create shadows.. e_e; Boring.  Oh. And I think today was a musical.. but it might have been the second one o_O; People can sign up to play a piece in front of the rest of the camp. Yuss.   Day 7, Tuesday - Hike by number #2! I believe this was with our very own Lizzy and Jeff. We had to play this stupid counting game, where people try to count to twenty. People cannot indicate the order in which they go, and you cannot go at the same time as someone else. Veddy confusing. -_-;  During the lunch assembly the counselors taught us dance moves, since today was a dance. I'll list them, because they were really amusing.  'The Kate' a la Kate: Moving two fingers (disco style!) in random directions. 'The Mickey Mouse' a la Toshi: Stepping from one side to another. If very daring, adding a spin. 'The Security Guard' a la Brian: Arms crossed. Bored expression. Nod head to music. Look at watch occasionally. 'The Pogo Stick' a la Brian: Put hands at sides, palms downward.. pause.. JUMP LIKE CRAZY IN RANDOM DIRECTIONS!! 'The Shopping Cart' a la Toshi: Put hands out in front of self as if holding a bar. Walk along casually. Reach up and mimic pulling things down from shelves, putting them into a cart. Variant of The Shopping Cart.. 'The Shoplifter' a la Toshi: Nervously walk, looking around self. Grab items, stuff into jacket, run for it!! Variant of The Shopping Cart.. 'The Lawnmower' a la Toshi: Pull chain to start up lawnmower. Start walking along casually as if pushing a lawnmower. 'The Maniac' a la Liz: Put arms out in front of self, together. Bend over slightly. Run in place. 'The T-rex' a la Katy: Bring arms close to body, as if a tyrannosaurus rex. Two fingers on each hand, bent. Move one arm (and inadvertently whole shoulder) forward like attacking prey. Switch arms.  There were two dances during the session. Unfortunately, they didn't tell us, so I only had camping clothes to wear.. e_e; My first dance, eee! Yeah, I'm pathetic. But I haven't been to any of the school dances. And besides, I'm pretty much a flop when it comes to dancing. But I enjoyed myself, and yes.. loud music, it was nice enough.   Day 8, Wednesday - Hike by number #3! This was Brian (I think. Either Brian or Ted..) and Laurie. If that was her name.. >_>; Trust walk! It was amusing. You close your eyes and put your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you. They do the same, you get the point. Then the person at the head of this (congo!) line, who has open eyes, leads the whole bunch on a hike. It was.. haaard. _._   And this was a musical, I think I think I think. If so it was the last one.. yes.   Day 9, Thursday - Hike by number #4!! With Tooooshi and Ana-banana! We had to sit in a circle and.. one by one.. go hug a tree. -_-;;;;;;; Then we had to say our name, where we come from, and our favorite band. THEN we had to say what the one thing we would change about ourselves is (Mine: procrastinating! You'll get a kick out of THAT, Sheep >_>). Fuuun, I guess.  ...And... Oi. Second dance.. I'm sort of leery putting this in, but.. *swallows pride and continues* So we were dancing in our little group, right? A slow song comes up. Then suddenly Taylor runs off without any before words right up to David the Tuba, who >every The only words that passed between us= Him (trying to break the awkward silence as we dance): Having fun? Me: I guess. Him (a bit later): So you play alto saxophone? Me: Yeah. I mean, could I be any more of a loser?! Uhh, well, anyway, I didn't meet his eyes the whole time, I was that mortified.. I mean, really. And at one point Toshi, who like the rest of the counselors is frolicking around trying to get everyone spirited, runs up to us and puts one hand on either of our shoulders. "Move closer!" Us: *does nothing* Toshi: *runs off* .....e_e;  For the rest of the dance I was so quiet and depressed it was scaring even me. (Taylor ended up pulling the 'SET PEOPLE UP WITHOUT ASKING THEM FIRST' thing on another of our friends.. then got angry cos people didn't want to be set up..) Uh, and anyway, when the second slow dance came up I was just milling around, and the OTHER David (the cool David who likes Cowboy Bebop and can Edwalk), the David Trumpet, was all "Uhh, so, who wants to dance with me?" Katrina looks at me, says "She does," then wanders off to dance with someone. So, I danced with the other David, which was sort of okay 'cos he's cool if not hawt. But he liked Gwen, not me, so.. sad Bekka T-T.  And.. that was that..   Day 10, Friday - The last hike by number, #5! We went with Kimi and Cormak down to the campfire, where we played chief. Pretty much there's a circle, with one person off to one side with eyes closed. A chief is chosen, and they start doing an action which everyone copies. The person who had their eyes closed comes back to the circle, trying to figure out who everyone is following. They have three guesses. And to make it harder the chief changes actions often. It was amusing enough.  We had KP again today... but with a different group of guys. We did KP with David the Trumpet's group, which was sort of okay.. heh-heh-heh, with Muscles the Stalker too. Um.. LESS MESSY. Thank you.  COCONUT BEAR NIGHT!! All session long our Cabin had been working on a skit, and we did it for Coconut Bear!! Our group, dubbed Oblique Moose 5, was SO cool. We did a scene, with different themes. Okay, here's the normal version:  Katrina: *walking in the 'forest'* Wow. Look at the trees, they're so green! The sky, it's so blue! I think I'll have a picnic. *sits* Taylor: *weaves her way over to Katrina* Sss! I am the snake! Sss! *uses hands to 'bite' Katrina* Chomp! *moves offstage* Katrina: Ouch, I'm bitten! I'm getting dizzy, I'm... *falls over* Gwen: *walks onstage* Hello? Katrina? Are you- ohmigosh! What happened? Are you okay? I'll call an ambulance! *pretends to call 911* Bekka: *waves arm above head as walks onstage* Weeooo weeooo weeooo! *pretends to step out of ambulance* What's the problem here? Gwen: She's been bitten by a snake! Bekka: Oh, this is very serious.. I'll take her pulse. *kneels and pretends to take pulse, then looks up* I think... I think she's dead... Katrina: *sits up* I'm not dead!  Then we did.. VALLEY GIRL VERSION! Katrina: *walks preppily into forest* Wow!! Look at the trees, they're like so.. uhh.. PURPLE!! Annie the tree: Thanks, but I'm green. Katrina: Oh, uh, green! And the sky, wow I feel really dizzy now.. Well like I need to eat because it's like lunchtime, hahaha! *sits* Taylor: Like Sss like ss I'm like the snake! I'm going to totally bite this person! Choo-ooomp! Katrina: Ow, that hurt! Wow, what's this red stuff? Hey, it looks good on me, hahahaa *falls over* Gwen: Hellllooooo? Like, heeee-llloooo? Like, what are you like doing like lying on the like ground? You're like going to like totally like ruin your hair like! Are you like okay? Like, are you like ookaaaayyy? *pause* I'm going to like call an ambu... and ambula.. and ambulalala.. a pharmacy car, like. *dials* Like, hello? I've got a serious problem like.. Yes.. Yes.. You guys don't know how much this like means to me.. Yes.. Nail appointment on Tuesday? You're a lifesaver! *hangs up and looks down at Katrina* Oh right, an ambu.. 911. *dials again* Hello like? My like friend is like hurt and like needs your help like. She's lying there like on the ground and like she's.. uh.. redding. She's redding. Thanks, byyyeee! *hangs up* Bekka: wooEEEEooEEEeEEo, wooEEeeoEEEeee! *hops over* What's the like, problem? Gwen: Like, it's YOOOU!! HIII! Bekka: Ahhh!! HiiiiIIIii!! Oh right, the like problem. Gwen: Oh, right, like she's just like there and like.. um. Bekka: Ooooh, that's baddd. She's lost a lot of blood. Gwen: Oooh, that's what it's called! Bekka; Yeeeaaah! *kneels and takes pulse* Oh oh.. I think she's like, a goner.. Gwen: Ohmigosh! But she'll like miss the like cheer competition! Katrina: *bolts up* OMYGAWD THE CHEER COMPETITION!!  Then we asked the crowd. They voted Pirate version. But I'll let you guys imagine that one o_o;! Everyone LOVED it! XD And we had done, when practicing, versions like Horror Movie, Monotone.. it was so fun.   Day 11, Saturday - Last day T-T Packed up, was DYING to see Boy & Parents again. They came, we concerted, then left. I MISS ALL OF THE OBLIQUE MOOSE 5!!!   First thing I had once returned to civilization: FRAPPACHINO!!!  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-  IMPROV Since I didn't include it above, I will here. On most days during lunch assembly, the counselors had an improv skit. Well, not skit. Improv game is more like it. I'll try and recall some- they were HILARIOUS.  Bus stop- This was probably my favorite. The point of it was two people sat, as if at a bus stop. You tried to make the other person laugh by having such an ODD quirk. So, first it was Toshi and Ana-banana. Toshi was acting all bipolar, calm one moment and screaming the next. I'm not sure what Ana was. Then finally they switched, and.. wull I don't quuuite remember. But up came Brian. Brian ROCKS. He was sitting there, hunched up a bit, pretending to very messily and strangely eat something. So someone comes up, sits. And Brian just looks over. And in serious the ODDEST voice ever: "Do you want an anchovy?" XD Like FIVE counselors attempted to go through that without laughing. Brian made 'em all laugh. Then STACY comes up and (this is hilarious). She walks up and starts talking. "Hello, I'm waiting for the bus so I can see the doctor. Because whenever I start to talk I people I just-" She falls over as if fainted then gets up "I just seem to-" falls over again, but has managed to hold onto 'bench' "Fall over and I can't quite-" has sat now, continues while staring at Brian "Quite seem to stop it I just-" She falls over, onto Brian XD It was SO hilarious. (Splat.. she was splatting.. o_o; )  Party- How to play: There's four people. Each person must have a mood like energetic, depressed, enraged, even constipated was one o_O. Just a mood. One of them is hosting a party. You choose what type of movie. So they're all acting they're mood when the first person knocks at the door. It's answered, and the new person comes in. Now BOTH people are acting like the mood of the new person. They talk for a bit, then another knock. The third person enters, and again there's a mood change. Same with the fourth. Then as one by one they leave, the mood switches to the third, to second, until it's only the first person acting as they had been. XD Very amusing.  Wull.. there's more but you don't need to hear about them.  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-  I'll end this with piccies.. cos I really don't want to do any more heavy typing.

Though it seems that we've just met You're the one I won't forget Till some kind wind blows you back my way  And I was thinking maybe someday later down the road After all our stories have been told I'll sit and think of you The dear friend I once knew Who shot through my life like a shooting star.  Sometimes I know, that a part of you will show Deep in my eyes or in my smile. There will always be a part of you deep inside my heart And I'll know just when to let it go  And I was thinking maybe someday later down the road After all our stories have been told  I'll sit and think of you The dear friend I once knew Who shot through my life like a shooting star.....

      You know..  I really wish that I was the kind of person that had so much to say. Like, the type of things that really matter.. the types of things that would get somebody to really think hard, to start reflecting on their inner self and all of that good crap.  Well, you know what?  I'm not.  And that's what makes me so.. so angry at myself. No, I'm not a very deep person! Or, at least, I don't show it or know it if I am.. I'm so unsure of myself. I'll think, "Oh. I realize that I'm not deep. That must make me deep. But wait.. Maybe everyone realizes this, and I just don't know it? That would mean I am in reality shallow. Or maybe all deep people think they're shallow and have the same thought process as I.." It's just.. going in circles. Does that mean that there's something wrong with me? Or does everyone think like this? Am I just trying to fool myself into thinking that I'm better than I really am?  Maybe it's just that I worry too much about these things. But lately I've felt sort of numb inside. Maybe I'm not getting enough sleep, and it's making me hallucinate that I have depth to myself.. or maybe I really am becoming apathic? Is it my tired brain trying to confuse me even further? Well.. I don't know. I just don't know. But, I'm so.. so..  Dull. Empty. I'm like a shell, although I bet I'm not and just wishing I was. At least then I might be at least slightly interesting as a person.  Is it that I think that people actually care about things like this? No, I don't think they do. I'm just whining about my lack of thought like the stereotypical Livejournaler..  *sighs..*  Am I really that shallow?

      Soo. Yesterday I went to the mall with Anneh, bought a ton of crapola (and Tarot cards!), stayed up 'till about 3 am.. 4 am? Ennnh.. whatever. Spent a long time on the subject of 'food' (XD still hungry, eh glutton? well, there's a seafood place, maybe you should- *falls asleep*) and also came up with a rather amusing thing concerning X-men.  Bekka: You know that part in X-men? Where, like, Mystique sticks metal into guy's butt? Anneh: He has... buns of steel!  Crude due to tired-ness... none the less hilarious XD  And, meh, deepness in general. ^_^ Thhheeeen I came home, got haircut (It's.. SHORT! *dies*) and basically lived life. Yannow?  On a completely unrelated note, I am about as angry as can be... for reasons... not at anyone who'd actually bother to read my blog, don't worry XP But... Well,  some one knows what I'm talking about.... *patience snaps* Grmmm... they don't... get it... Damn Fuzznuckers..  ~Ryume Of course, you know,  this  means  war !

      Explaining my 'mysterious' almost two day disappearance:  Thursday I was banned from the computer. Yeah, nothing special there... 'tho I want to post about my day, because I  can .  Um, so, pretty much a friend comes over- Problems there, I was being such a bitch, but then again.. so was she.. and um vv;; Gonna have to apologize, anyway -then it's my lesson. After my lesson I go shopping for a one-piece swimsuit but end up getting this classy jacket for formal occasions and a white shirt to go under it, because.. um.. low neckline grrmm grmm guh. I also get a black tank top, because I  can .  Come home, time for Bekka to act domestic. -_-;; Cooking almond roca (carmel covered in chocolate and almonds- YUM), in an APRON. XD It... amused me, no I don't know why. But... APRON! :6 So, yeah.. too bad I don't actually get to eat the almond roca >_> It's a "Thank-you" gift for the Clows family.  Annnnnnd today I was over at Diane's house being domestic again, baking cheesecake with Diane for when we're at the beach.  That brings up something important. Tomorrow I'm leaving to go to the beach for a week. I'll miss you all! T-T *huggles everyone*  Baaaaaiiiiieeeeeeeeee.

      Well, I suppose I never really had been quite content with Sasuke's  urlLink original picture  (NOTE: Not my art. A link to where I got it from is coming, don't worry), so I went back to the site I got it from for two reasons. 1, I needed to find out if he was from a story or anime. (Point of interest: He's just a created character namd Alex, apparently) 2, I wanted to see what else the site had, because I was just scanning the place when I found the first picture. So, I was off to the  urlLink art gallery  of  urlLink BakaNeko  to see what I could find.  And I wasn't disappointed!  I stumbled across a  urlLink very interesting picture . (Again: Not my art) The character on the left caught my eye. It was promising, but there were two problems. The colors, and the other person in the picture. But he had the right shape to his face, and his clothes were right as well. Big problem? Well, I could always try and rely on the general populace of short-attention span roleplayers to read my profile once it came. But.. you know, people don't  do  that these days. They just look at the picture. So, it was steadily becoming more of a problem. But I can be  stubborn  when I want to be.  So what I did was dragged the picture into my trusty version of Photoshop. Short while later I came out with what I wanted.  urlLink Success!  It's still awaiting the final 'OK' from the owner of the character Sasuke, but.. I dunno.. I think it's better than the one I had in the beginning. Much more 'Sasuke' to it.  But pretty much all I'm trying to say here is that Photoshop Is God.

Am I the ONLY one who enjoys summer? o_O; All of my friends are like all "I can't wait for school to start" and "Sssssoooo bored"! T'be poifectally plain I love summer to bits and wish it was longer >_  Err... or something along those lines..  *thunk*

      Last night I did something I don't normally do. I turned off the computer early, even before Boy did, and went to go beat that  one level  on Tetris Attack. And because it amuses me, I shall relate to you the (mis)adventures of Bekka and the Super Nintendo.  So anyway, this level is the last one of the Stage Clear mode, where you beat levels one by one as they get progressively faster. Not hard, really. Well, that is, the levels leading >up  So, right, I'm all hyped up for the last level. And then it comes... BOWSER!! Roooar. The flatulent King of the Koopas himself. -_- So, by now I'm thinkin' it'll be a breeze. (No pun intended) Then comes the chiller.. "BWAHAHA! IF YOU DO NOT KNOW CHAINS AND COMBOS YOU ARE WASTING BOTH OF OUR TIMES!" -_-;;; Isn't that dandy? He's got "health" and I have to use these "chains and combos" to "attack" him.  Well, it still doesn't seem  too  hard. I mean, chains and combos are easy, y'know? So I'm thinking "Hah. My power of justice shall smite thee, yon toady-beast." You know, just cos it was easy to win the other levels. So Bowser laughs maniacally, the game starts...  Game over.   Game over ! I mean, the speed level was only 50, I had gone up to 100 before. So I hit the 'try again' button.  Bowser laughs evilly. The colums of blocks start to rise again.   Game over!!!!  -_- So, I try again.  Same thing. Mwahahaha. Game starts. Game over. This goes on for a while, by now every time I lose I lapsed into Ed-mode. Screech unintelligible words, flail for a few seconds, angrily mash the button to try again. And every so often I'd get a comment from Boy, "Deep breaths," or "Calm down." At which I would either pretend to hyperventilate or screech at him. I mean, I was getting killed by a  turtle on steroids !! I had a right to be torked.  'cos, I mean, I'd like get him way past half health then the stupid speed level would increase. And increase.. and..  I think I eventually started saying some rather unsavory things about Bowser's mother. Or at least I would have, but my mother was sleeping and wished to remain as such. So I just shook my fist at the tv. Repeatedly.  And it went on like this for, uh.. 45 minutes? I'm sort of embarrassed to say that XD but it's true.  Mwahaha. Game starts. Game over. Screech. Flail. Try again.  Then finally I got a 4 chain and whipped Bowser's scaly tush. And lemme tell you, four chains are HARD. It's like, the set-up has to be PERFECT or you have to be pretty damn lucky. So I'm thinking,  What do I win, what did I unlock?  Cos after that you damn well WANT to win something or unlock a new character or  something.   ...I got the ultimate privilege of watching the credits...  *screech, flail*
