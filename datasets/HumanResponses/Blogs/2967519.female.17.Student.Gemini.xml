      Sorry for not writting...ive been up to my elbows in school work trying to get everything finished to go see my dad in May.Hopefully this will be a less eventful trip than the last ones that i have taken to see him and my step-mother.It looks like its going to be a HOT summer in Colorado this year...the last time i was there it was 112* the ENTIRE time i was there.Way to hot for me. It has also come to my attention(and the attention of my friends) that i havent really said anything about myself on here so here it goes...My name is Kayla Hosea im 16 and live with my mom,step dad and little sister in North Pole Alaska, im fashion obsessed and hope to make that my future buisness venture in life. ummm...hmmm...yeah ithink that covers the basics  *MissKayla* Ps wonder where the Miss Kayla comes from? Its a nickname given to me by my grandma and grandpa McLean who come up with creative little nicknames for all of us grandchildren mine includ Miss America and Muffin....Just though y'all would like to know

      Im suposed to be cleaning right now...but what mom dont know dont hurt her right? right...My cuz Jody emailed me this joke i think y'all will like  The following scene took place on a BA flight between Johannesburg and London.   A white woman, about 50 years old, was seated next to a black man. Obviously disturbed by this, she called the air Hostess. "Madam, what is the matter," the hostess asked.   "You obviously do not see it then?" she responded. "You placed me next to a black man. I do not agree to sit next to someone from such a repugnant group. Give me an alternative seat."   "Be calm please," the hostess replied. "Almost all the places on this flight are taken. I will go to see if another place is available." The hostess went away and then came back a few minutes later.   "Madam, just as I thought, there are no other available seats in the economy class. I spoke to the captain and he informed me that there is also no seat in the business class. All the same, we still have one place in the first class."   Before the woman could say anything, the hostess continued. "It is not usual for our company to permit someone from the economy class to sit in the first class. However, given the circumstances, the captain feels that it would be scandalous to make someone sit next to someone so disgusting."   She turned to the black man and said, "therefore, Sir, if you would like to, please take your hand luggage because a seat awaits you in the first class."   At the moment, the other passengers who were shocked by what they had just witnessed stood up and applauded.   This is a true story which is not usually told. If you are against racism, please send this message to all your friends, please do not delete it without sending it to at least one person.   *Mss Kayla*

Now im just waiting for my mom to get home so I can yell at her for hiding all the cookies on me. Very relaxing day indeed.

      Oh man, if you could see my drive way right now you would think that we built our house in the middle of a lake! We cant even get our car in and out and had to park it at a neighbors house! LOL I talked to my cousion Justin yesterday,he got his drivers licence! YAY! Great for You! And I got a letter from Jeanette...so happy she wrote me back b/c no one ever does. Easter was good,went to Jd and Marys for dinner at about 1:00, then had to go to town and didnt get home till like 6:00...but it was all good. Lots of great food and everybody seemed to be in a pretty good mood. Someone was killed at Artic Man yet agian this year. What it basically is a big snowmaching party,lots of booze and drugs and aparently one guy was caught in an avalance and sufocated....something like this happends every year but it is still really sad to hear about. Nothing else much going on. Hope you all had a good Easter weekend!  Kayla

      People are so stupid!Yes it is true the idiots of the world have united and are taking over! Everyday while talking to a friend or something they will tell me what there verison of a crisis is,A failed class,a boy who dosnt like them or being grounded..."Hello!!! are you people not listening to the news? Did you not know that the world dosnt revolve around you?" The petty little problems that people have are inevitable to the crap thats going on in the world right now and untill you are on the outside of it you will never see it. Sometimes i just want to shake my friends and say "Shut-up!" "You are being so petty and stupid!" And usually its not unitll you look back from high school and see it,but lemme tell you those of us that see it while we are in high school,are going to be the ones who dont stress out over a failed 2 week relationship or a c- on a test when you thought you studided hard enough to get a B! Its like why is that a problem agian? I read some of my other friends blogs on here and i find myself laughing b/c of the things that happen in there days that they think is bad.  lol sorry guys but its true...take a look at what your writting...Making a decision not to smoke or not isnt a hard one,who cares what people think! Screw them if they dont like you b/c you dont fit into there little clique! Which justifys my point that stupidity should be painful! Anytime a person says something or does something stupid they should be smacked over the head with a stick! And yes ive had my stupid moments,who hasnt,but when your are just plain dumb in your decisions or you thinking all the time you need to get a grip on reality and mabey making it painful will scare people away from being stupid! Thats my thoughts on that...whoa that was alot of writting...I still love my friends but guys,seriously,you would be a whole lot more fun if you lots the pettiness! Kayla

He made it look like it was a suicide...Sick Sick ppl out there! But at least he is behind bars! Kudos to the movie and Mel! LOL Making cookies and watching Oprah, Kayla

      This is going to be my last post for a few weeks as im flying off to Colorado to visit my dad. We are having a going-away BBQ tomorrow night and then sunday morning i fly out at like 6:15 am. Yuck, You have to get there 2 hours early so its going to be a little hectic. I never sleep before I get on a plane so by the time i reack my dads house im completly wiped out. And of course, everyone wants to stay up late and talk and eat and all i want to do is sleep for 2 weeks! I went to the doc and had that EKG done and everything is good with my heart so i dont have that to worry about. I got some really cute shorts and stuff too. Hopefully Jeanette will be here tomorrow, If she has to work i wont get to see her before i leave, Bri will be here and Christine. NO babies this time! YAY! Im not in the mood to play babysitter. Well i have to mop and put away dishes, Ill try and post as much as i can when something important happends. GoodBYe for now!!! Have an AWESOME summer everyone!!! Kayla

      Went to my doctor appointment yesterday and everything went fine, she gave me my depo shot and drew my blood,but then she listened to my heart and she wants me to go have and EKG thing at the hospital b/c i have and irregular heart beat and it worries her. Im already in a bad mood b/c i have to get stuck with needles and then she tells me that i need to have someone moniter my heart! So im freaking out wondering whats going to happend tomorrow. When we were done with all of that we had to go to cell one b/c Liz's cell bill was WAY out there and ended up there for almost 2 hours! It was so borring. I have alot of stuff to do tomorrow so i prolly wont get around to updating till thursday or friday. I leave on Sunday, I dont like planes or being crammed in like a pack of sardines. anyways still gotta do it no matter how much i hate it. byebye

      I just woke up, Somebody called here at like 4am...I was sooo pissed off,no one answered at the other end! grrrrr i hate ppl that do that.I have to go to the doc today which im not looking forward too. Im not good with needles and machines and all that. my sisters birthday was saterday and my mom invited Tawnie and Christy who have hunter whos 2 and Siera whos 3. Well Bri and i were dubbed babysitters so the adults could smoke and talk without distractions and the other kids didnt have to be bothered by the little ones. Im so sore still from throwing those two on the trampoline over and over! lol it was fun tho,kids say the darndest things! Okay i need to go take a shower before Tawnie gets here to take me to my appointment, have a great day!

      It was sooo cold on Tuesday! A friend of mine and I went 4 wheeling and ended up going all the way to a store about 3 or 4 miles from my house and froze the hell out of ourselves! It was fun though.Next week is my last week ill be able to see everyone before I leave. Im excited to be going but really sad that I wont be able to spend the better part of my summer with my friends. I havent seen my best friend, Heather in a year and usually summers are our time to be inseperable but since my dad moved i dont get to see her! I guess ill just make the most of it and ill be writting everyone and sending pictuers whenever possible. Ive got to go get my sisters birthday present here soon and a couple of books for me to read on the plane. Okay im depressed now, lol j/k.  Kay*la

      Im in the party mood or something lol. This weekend we are having a party for my sisters birthday but that will mostly be just family and Bri i think. Then the day before we leave for Colorado im throwing this huge BBQ, kinda like a end of school,beging of summmer,going away party thing. Lots of food and drinks,lots of people. Hopefully it wont be too eventful and nobody will end up in a fight or getting pissed off and leaving. Today was good. gotta go to town tomorrow, Oh im appling at WalMart when i get back to work in the infants, Jeanette got an interview there too so Good Luck to her on that. Season Finales have been horrible! I hated The O.C.'s and last thursday i watched E.R's...That was horrible,no way to leave things. I didnt like Fraisers either, It was borring. Friends was the only good one so far. Okay enough of that!I should be able to get in a few more posts before i leave, and mabey a couple this summer but its very doubtful i will be able to update that much. Last day of school for all of us in North Pole and Fairbanks! YAY! lol

      We just got about 50 baby chickens today. they are SOOO cute! Tomorrow we will get the 2 baby pigs. I usualy dont have anything to do with the animals but since my mom is working and nobody is home all of the time but me and my sister I guess i have to pitch in. Its also like 100 degrees right now in my house and im wondering now why we dont have air conditioning. I have to go get a shot on Tuesday and im not looking forward to that, I also have to get a physical just in case anything is wrong i know about it before i leave. I think that the hardest part for me, on my trip, is that i wont be able to check my email. That is the way i communicate with all of my friends. Its going to suck but ill survive somehow!

      Im having a really good day so far! Nothing really terrible has gone wrong and no one had pissed me off to badley today,YAY! I wont be able to update for a while starting on the 30th. My dad dosnt have the internet at his house and so they only way i can use it is if i go to my Aunt Char's. Lots of plans to do stuff though it should be a really cool summer for the most part. Im sad that i have to say goodbye to everyone though, even if it only is for a couple of months. I usually send out all my friends an email lol! I hate the whole goodbye thing, it just isnt fun. Im going to the bookstore here soon to get some reading material for my trip, and i still need to do a little more shopping but im almost done!

      My computer got a virus so I havent been able to use it for like 3 days! Drive me crazy! plus on top of all of that ive gotten one of my horrible kidney infections. I had then so bad when i was a baby i almost didnt make it. They SUCK! Ive already gone through like half a gallon of cranberry juice in like an hour. The whole week was pretty good tho. i got to go shopping agian and get some stuff for my trip. Watched the finale of Friends last night and it turned out just as i had hoped,cant say the same thing for The OC but whatever! lol Jeanette and i tried tanning out on the trampoline on tuesday and it was so nice for like 20 minutes unitll the wind came out and it got REALLY cold. We also died my hair,we got bored and put bright red streaks in it, but of course i have blonde hair and after i washed it they turned orange! GREAT! so now im walking around looking like a mupet.They canceled Days of Our Lives today b/c of some stupid presidential thing,that really ticked me off,it was the one good thing i had going in my day and it was canceled. I also watched Tuck Everlasting for the first time after owning it for almost a yr, and  I really liked it up untill the end when she dies and dosent drink from the spring.Now okay, if you had the choice to drink from a spring that can give your everlasting life would you turn it down? NO!!! Okay ive rambled on enough. Have a great weekend! Kayla

      Jeanette came over on friday after i forget to pick her up at the bus stop and she had to walk like 4 miles down our road, but then we went 4 wheeling and had a BLAST getting all muddy and wet going into unknown areas out behing our house. Great time. So when we got back we had to wash everything like 3 times to get all of the mud out and just finished not too long ago. Im really tired and so im going to veg out the rest of the weekend and watch movies and eat junk food. YAY! lol Wednesday were all going to town agian and jeanette is going to skip school and come with us. She has such cool parents to let her do that. Im getting my hair cut then too and hopefully going shopping. So great weekend so far! Hope you all are having the same! Peace(ha ha ive always wanted to see if i could say that and pull it off lol did i?)
