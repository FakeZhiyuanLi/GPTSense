      Right.  So I haven't gotten all that much reponse for my Apple Cup email.  I thought I'd start a new thread here, to see if I can drum up some more support.  Coug side tix are all but sold out already, and as of the last thing I heard, the Fuskie side has around 3000 left.  The game should be fun, not to mention hangin out in Pullman again.  So what do ya think?  I'm planning on heading over Friday morning and spending the day in and around campus, then Saturday hit the game.  The longer we wait the less likely we'll be able to get hotel rooms or tickets.  Just something to think about.  Of course, if you wanna just stay home, thats OK too.  I'd just really like to see one of these games.

      FOR REDHOOK MOVIE NIGHTS, EVERYONE IS WELCOME TO MEET AT THE NEVE RESIDENCE. PARK ALONG THE TOP OF THE STREET, SO NO ONE IS ON THE SIDEWALK & SO LARRY CAN PARK IN HIS SPOT WHEN HE COMES HOME TO TAKE CARE OF THE DOGGIES. 5:30 IS GO TIME, IF YOU ARE NOT THERE BY 5:30 PLAN ON DRIVING YOURSELF.

      The Buick is finally done.  KC Martin agreed to pay me 500 bucks on the damn thing.  I'm taking a serious soaking, but what can ya do?  I'm screwed no matter which way I cut it, so I'm going to cut my losses and run.  Thanks for everyone's help with rides, advice, and just support as I waded my way through this fiasco.  Bye bye Pimp-Daddy, it was fun while it lasted.  -Scott

      Well, according to the calender, its time for RHMN (easy!).  I've never been to one, so I'm looking forward to it mucho.    Whats the best way to go?  Meet up and car pool?  What do we need to bring?  This is going to kick so much ass.  -Scott

      Hey everyone!  The calender is really flushing out!  Thanks B for filling in your schedule.  I've put the Coug games up on the board (and only a couple errors for Ben-Wa to fix).  And I've started filling in birthdays as I know 'em.  Make sure your birthday is on there, as well as any you know thats missing.    Looks like Thursday we'll be hitting the RedHook Movie night!  My first ever!  But that is the subject of a whole new post.  -Scott

      Yo dudes.  Just wanted to see what was up for Monday night.  I'm thinking that perhaps we can chizzill at Bri-Guys, since he said he'd prolly like to hang out, but since his back has made him gimpy, perhaps he should stay home on his couch.  Nothin too strenuous.  Plus, we can get him dinner, and put it just out of his reach...hehe...wait, thats mean.  Anyway, thought I'd throw that out there.  I need to stop by Julie's and drop off goodies for the little dude getting heart surgery.  And I still need to get the hooptie (maybe someone can help me?...please?)    Busy busy!

      Just curious if our daily email crew would rather use this for or daily chit-chat, or just use this for making things happen?  I have a feeling that if we use this for our daily ramblings, things will get very crowded.  Unless we stick to the COMMENTS under each heading.   What do you think?

      Ok, so the main page is having some kind of issue with the sidebar.....And Scott is having some kind of issue with empty space at the end of his posts.&nbsp; I'm working on the sidebar thing, as far as Scott's problem.&nbsp; I dunno what's causing that.

      So I was wondering if we should continue to use a new Post for each comment, or if we should use the main posts as topics and anyone who wants to respond to it to use comments? Any thoughts?

      I'd like to propose a Poker Game / BBQ / Beer thing for this weekend.  NOt sure where, or when, or anything like that, but I think it would be great to hang out, BBQ a bit, and play some cards.  I don't play in the tourneys that Neal, Sean, and Ben do, so I need to get my fix with y'all.  What kind of interest is there in this idea?

      Alright all you turd burglars on 10/5/04 and 10/6/04, The worlds greatest Rock Opera of all time will be performed at the Moore Theater.  Yes that's right, you guessed it.   QUEENSRYCHE!!!!  Queensryche will be performing Operation Mindcrime for the first time in its entirety in 15 years for 2 nights in a row, with actors and everything!!!  But wait that's not all, they'll be performing their greatest hits during the first act and there is going to be a sneak peak of their next album, Operation Mindcrime II.  So to quote The Joker, "Comense, o' fest-eve-all!!!"  I think I am going to go and Ill put it on the calander.   Come if you want to, if not...go fist yourselfs...  Just kidding about the last part.  I love you guys.  That would be gross...and would probably stink, eeww.

        Those of us that hung out for Monday night already know this, my apartment complex sucks and I'm tired of it. Those of you that weren't there, here is what happened.      Our numbnuts of neighbors on the first floor thought it would be funny if their toddler decided to pull the fire alarm. We all had to evacuate the building and wait for the Fire Fighters to turn the alarm off. Of course they aplogized for incident, as they do with everything else they violate (ie noise curfew, etc.), and decide to back in and light up some more reefers. Thank gawd they didn't set the alarm off, AGAIN. Although       Needlesstosay this was the last straw for Tishy, so she went and complained to the office about EVERYTHING that they have done since they moved in. Which includes the following: Partying on weeknights past noise curfew, both car and home stereo blairing into the wee hours of the morning, boyfriends parking in reserved spots (because just girls rent the apt), honking their horns waking everyone up at 2am on a weeknight, pot smoke barrelling out every damn day, and everything else that they do.      Now, I know we are not the only ones complaining, the Saturday before Monday night, 3 cop cars showed up at their place to quiet them down. So do I think that the management of the apt complex is doing anything about it, probably not.      So here's my point to all this, this morning when I was getting ready to leave work, Tishy's tire was flat. Kind of coincidence since she complained about them the night before don't you think. So I have the wonderful pleasure of changing a flat when I get home. If I found out that the tire was slashed, I'm going to be so pissed. I hope that Tishy just ran over a nail or something.       I hate punks, and I hate our complex. I want out and I want out bad. We may have to postpone the wedding and get a house or something I don't know. All I know is that I dread going home. Tishy and I never had any problems there until "they" showed up. In fact, it was quiet, too quiet, eeriely quiet, when Tishy and I first moved in there. You could even hear a cricket. This sucks....maybe blasting some fools in Halo will cheer me up. Thanks for letting me vent.      Aaries
