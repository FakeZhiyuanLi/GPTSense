      Do you know why it is that most guys are total jerks? Most say they can't help it. But if they can't help it who can? Sounds like a load of bull to me. I say it's just an excuse cuz they don't want to change. But who's to say they can't change or maybe that's just wishful thinking.  I know that when it comes to guys I am definetly not an expert, but I am learning by, if nothing else, the hard why!

      A good friend once told me "It's okay to fall for a guy, you just don't want to slip!" I love the way she put that. It is just so wonderful to have friends like her!

      Although I am only 16 I have been told that I am wise beyond my years. I think you can decide for yourself. You may think that since I'm writing this I am conceited that is where you are wrong I not conceited only confident!

      Life is hard Bad things happen People make decisions  Sometimes they're not always the right ones We are not here to judge We are here to live life   Love life and Live  No One Said It Would Be Easy They Said It Would Be Worth It  Make your life work for You!

      &nbsp; Someone once said "It's&nbsp;weather you win or lose, it's how you play."&nbsp; That is so very true. Just apply that to life. In life you can't win or lose, not really, it's the things that you do throughout your life that really matters. Like with dating it's not how many dates you go on, that matters, it's finding the right person on those dates.  &nbsp; I wish life was that simple, but it's not!

      Dreams are funny things They can be a revelation of sorts Or they can just be fantasies.  Dreams can be Wonderful, Terrible, Exciting, Scary, Lovely, Or even horrid.  My dreams have been some of each, How 'bout yours?

      My life is like a wheel Always turning with movement Always moving some way Weather it be forward or backwards  I know that going backwards isn't always fun or even good But sometimes it's what we need.  The wheels of life are always turning  But maybe not in the direction that we choose.

      Life is wonderful but is very trying at times for me this is one of those times. I try to make the best of it but sometimes it is hard. I wonder a lot about my future and how my life is going to be but I know that it will happen the way it is supposed to.    Like I have said in the past No one said that it would be easy they said that it would be worth it!
