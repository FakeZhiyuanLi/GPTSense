      Ol' Rusty  It's a running joke, This truck of mine. It's grey and green And black with time.  It sputters with The intent of going, But it wheezes And it soon is slowing.  But it's my comrade, It's ol' Rusty. Never mind the Window's Dusty.  Keep it floored, Forget the brakes, Hold fast the door, Ignore the quakes,  Adjust the clutch Every five feet; Detour stoplights, And where roads meet.  It's me and Ol' Rusty Down Highway 64. One hand driving, One holding the door.    SO, that's today's poem!!! see whats up later!

       Morning  The Sunrise is the burnished dust From a genie's smoke. A-light, it glistens In the dew of morning; Silent, until it forms; And Watch! It becomes a tree and a dale, A lake and a sky and a bird and a home, A skyscraper leaning its windows upon The blue of the day and the dusk of the dawn. And smoke is no more; What is left is the day. (And the city and farms and the sun and the world.)  this is the newest post and poem!!

      another coffee cup   so im writing here and thinking about how all the people here have these really long blogs and it all seems very strange. i have no time at all. you know. the world is an interesting place, and there are the folks who have time and the folks who dont. im ready for the world to slow down, id like to be able to step off for a while, like that play i think it is... "Stop the World, I Want to Get Off." Plays have really wonderful titles. this one that is particularly wondifilous is the cool,  "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Momma's Hung Ya in the Closet and I'm Feeling So Sad" Awesome the world is great. i love tennessee. you ever just drive down a street in tn, not the really big ones, but the regular roads, and see all the little shacks out back of a house, and realize somebody's been living here for so long that you couldnt describe to them how young you are because they couldnt connect? strange, that. look, at the green grass. so beautiful that at times you feel like a sheep and want to eat it, because you know there is some point to it other than looking at.  I saw a dragonfly today. not of course, an unusual sight, but still nice to see. calming. giant, black with whtite tips, fluttering around and eating up all the nasty mosquitoes we love to squish. i really love tn.  i took my aunts dogs out walking today, and Rachel, the girl dog, kept trying to go back home, shes got a long coat, so she gets hot i guess. but needs her exercise. pistol, the boy, wouldnt do his business until a few feet from home on the way back, and in the middle of the sidewalk. hed had all that grass, but no... he had to do it there. dogs. anyhoo. talk later. roger wilco.

      alright, so this is only my third time.... if i count correctly, to post. and the whole thing still seems a little fishy. i mean, doesnt anyone else find it strange to write out their thoughts, possibly intimate, so that the creators of blogger and all blogger users can potentially read your ideas? i do.  thats obvious though. a false sense of security goes a long way towards letting your intimate thoughts out, however, and since i have so willingly invested in just such a sense, i believe i shall get the most out of it.  to begin.  i've always been one of those kids who watch the older ladies put their lipstick covered lips all over a styrofoam cup or a straw, and been totally grossed out by the remaining lipstick on the cup or straw. i am now one of those folks. not an older lady folk, but a lipstick leaving folk, and am still disgusted. by myself. i shake my head in bewilderment at myself and move on. well, im glad i have signed onto this, even if everyone and their brother can read it. its an interesting doing, and im glad to be in on it.  i think ill actually write again.
