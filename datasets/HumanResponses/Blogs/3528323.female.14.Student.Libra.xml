But today in State Requirements our "homework" tonite is..."You are getting married...to who? where? who's in it? where is your honeymoon?" Okay this question is kind of hard...I'm just a kid and I don't know! I'm trying to decide between like 3 guys!! lol My mom said to marry Brendan...because she thinks we are going to end up together...which is kinda grosse cuz hes like my bro!! lol But there are two other guys that I'm not sure if I should say them infront of the class but whatever i will probably just pick one by the time its my turn tomorrow! It will be fun...I bet every girl in that class will pick Joe Harden!! haha   Tomorrow is gonna be hecka fun!! I'm going over to Lauren's house for the weekend cuz my mama is going out of town and my grandma is in minnesota and my bro is going to bakersfield for a bball tourney and its graduation week down at SCU and chloe is in italy so basically there is no place for me to go so im going over to Lauren's!! Im looking forward to it actually!! After summer school her mom is taking us over to the mall (YAY) and then later we are going to Lincoln Center Live which should be fun if the right person will be there!! Ü hehehe!! And then Saturday she has a 2 dance recitals (BLAH) one in the morning and one later...so i think i will go to the morning one while kdub is at bball then stay home with kdub and ball him up on the court!! lol!!!! its gonna be fun!!!   I'm kind of sore today!! I fell on the ground i dont know how many times and didnt play good at all!! I hate it when i dont play good it makes me mad!! Oh well!!

Today we actually did something...we had a quiz...so0o easy ( we did it with a partner so it was 10X easier )   After summer school I came home and ate...then my mom and I went over to the mall to Barnes & Noble mostly but we ventured down the mall!! I got some cool flip flops in Dillard's...they had some really cute ones but not my size so I got some fuzzy slipper flip flops!!! They are so0o0o comfy!! I got my book from the Summer Reading List! I chose...When you come to a fork in the road take it by Yogi Berra!! It sounded like a good one...better than the other ones!!!  Okay...anyone who is taking AP Euro next year you'll understand...what the hell (pardon my french) are we supposed to do?¿? He expects us to write 6 jammin essays and know all the nations or countries or something on &quot planet earth &quot!! Yeah okay see ya there....NOT!! haha! Oh well its only the second week of vacA but whatever its still stupid!!!   Who are three people you would want to have dinner with? they could be alive or dead...I'm still trying to decide who to bring and where to go...oh well I'll finish it by 8 tomorrow morning!! lol  "Normal People Scare Me"

      Well I have definately benefited from my brother's wisdom teeth removal! I have been eating Ice cream and Tiger's for DAYS!!! It's so0o0o good!! Today was his birthday so my mama and I went over to the mall when he got home...I realized why I don't go to the Sherwood mall very much...We pulled up and the creepiest guy was parked next to us!!! HE LOOKED LIKE A CLONE OF MICHAEL JACKSON!!! ahh!! Not when he was cute and black...but when as he is now...white and ugly! BLAH!! haha!! But other than that Champ's is one of the greatest stores ever!! haha! I love their shoes and their headbands and socks!!!! Haha (you know we ghetto Ü)   YAY ANDY'S COMING HOME TONITE!!! HOORAY!!!!!!!!!!! I am so0o0o excited!!! I think he is just coming home for like two days but I love when he comes home!! He is awesome..I think I have more fun with him cuz he is so far apart in age from me and I don't have to live with him everyday!! haha!! I'm excited about that! I think tomorrow he actually wants to see the house we are moving into...he hasn't seen it yet so I think it would be nice if he actually saw it!! haha!!   Okay well today was a pretty good day except for the fact that the people who are buying our house...their realator (who...I'm not trying to be mean...but doesn't know how to put on eye makeup...she looked like a CLOWN)..and the home inspector were here for 3 hours!!!!!!!!!!!! IT WAS CRAZY!!!!!! And then Maxo came over and he didnt know they were here cuz they were in the back of the house and we were in the front and he was like yelling at us from the bathroom that we didnt have toilet paper and the people were like WHAT?!? it was pretty funny!!!!!   Oh well....my brother is coming home in awhile...he just called and said he was on the road and wants Dave Wongs (but of course my mommy wont get it for him cuz &quot hes a big boy &quot lol)...and two of my mom's friends are over to visit scooter...they are so0o0o funny!!!

He did not look good at all so I took him to the couch!! I was so0o0o scared!! I thought he was going to pass out...I ran over to the phone and called my mom....my mom was so0o calm and was like okay just get him some ice water and some ice chips to suck on!! I was like how can you be calm!! then he was like It's really hot so I turned on the fan really high and I hung up the phone and I came back into the family room and he was like I'm fine!!

      Here we go.  Alright, basically, do whatever you want. There are only a couple things I ask (oh shit, I sound like a teacher):  1) Don't over use AIM slang. I understand that LOL may seem necessary at times, but try to use it sparingly. None of that 12/f/your room lolololololz!!!one!!!!1!!!!111!!!!one!!!! crap. We don't need that.  2) Don't fuck with the blog settings unless we agree on it. If it is something minor, go ahead. But doing something like changing the entire template should be something we decide on as a group. Other shit, I don't really care about.  3) No inviting non-Saint Mary's students to become members. This is for SM kids only. However, if you want to invite a Saint Mary's kid, go ahead.  I can't really think of anything else. If you have anything to add, by all means, go ahead.

      Hey Wankers,  Okay, K(r)is(t)ina asked me a question on the tag board, but I am going to make a new post because:  1) Nobody else is posting. 2) I have nothing to do right now. 3)   So, anyways, I have been able to post on my blog and shit because I just spent Saturday and most of Sunday in Los Angelos at my aunt Susan's place, and they have a computer. My aunt in San Diego, who I have been staying with for the majority of the time, has no internet connection (yes yes, I know, what the fuck?). Right now I am at my friend's house. I am  not  back in Stockton yet. I fly to Texas this Wednesday, and don't get back to Stockton until July 6. I know those of you with working memories realize I have told you the stuff in this post many times before.   Any ways, I am having as much fun as can be expected. I am gonna watch  Club Dread  in a little while, which looks good. Last night, we saw  Dodgeball , which was really funny. I already saw  The Stepford Wives  and  The Chronicles of Riddick , and I rented  Along Came Polly  and  50 Firs --  Okay, I should save this for my personal blog, so I'm gonna end this before I revert back to 'noob' mode. Um, anyways, I hope your summers are going alright. I have (some) pictures from my little trippy-thingy, so yeah.  That post was horrible.  P.S. I wasn't calling anyone a cupcake when I titled this post. Pet names are for fags, and the line is from  Invader Zim .

      Dear Everybody, Hi. I'm leaving for a while. I will be back on July 6. My personal blog should be updated at least a few times during the course of my absence here at SM Kids. Feel free to invite new people while I am gone (as long as they are from Saint Mary's). I am giving you all admin status (at least until I return), so that if something needs to be fixed or you want to invite someone, you can. If I happen to die over my vacation, please put a whoopee cushion under my coffin, so when they lower me down it sounds like...   Any ways, enjoy your time without my constant badgering and sexual innuendo. Love, Pierce I mean fuck you.  P.S. w00t.

      Okay, I have added in a tag-board on here. If you guys don't like it, you can either edit it or remove it. Whatever.  I'm not going to make the rules on this one, since this blog doesn't just belong to me.  Also, here is some information:  Tag-Board.com username thing: SMKids Password: I will tell you each personally.  I also set up an email account at Yahoo.com to use as the universal SM Kids blog email address (if you have to sign up for something, like Tag-Boards, this is the email you sign up with if it is going on this blog). The email address is: SMHSKids@yahoo.com (SMKids was taken...) Password: Same as above.  Mmmyep.

      Haha, I was right (see first post). At least it spawned a few personal blogs that give me something to read.  The only reason I leave this crap up is in hopes that once school starts, someone will post something...  Wishfull thinking, perhaps.  [too lazy to link image]
