      Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to calm myself down. I'll go over to the persons house and ring the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck in the side of it's head with a note that says "You." After that I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done

      what a bad day today.  woke up late and had to rush to work, got into a car accident and was late for a meeting.  stuck in the meeting for 3 hours and missed lunch gathering with my colleagues.  had to eat cup noodles for lunch, no dim sum for me.  so many projects and developments to work on, so little time.  worked my ass off till 10pm.  got a call from a friend asking me out for dinner but i couldn't go.  wtf, sometimes i hate my life, it's friday nite and i am stuck at the office!

      i have always been fascinated by Edward Gorey's writings, he often illustrates his unique ideas in his drawings.  i am planning to start a Edward Gorey collection and i will go from bookstore to bookstore to search for his work.  I am very fond of his poem --  urlLink The Gashlycrumb Tinies , i've got the poster of this poem and the drawings.  A is for Amy who fell down the stairs.  B is for Basil assaulted by bears.  C is for Clara who wasted away.  D is for Desmond thrown out of a sleigh.  E is for Ernest who choked on a peach.  F is for Fanny sucked dry by a leech.  G is for George smothered under a rug.  H is for Hector done in by a thug.  I is for Ida who drowned in a lake. J is for James who took lye by mistake.  K is for Kate who was struck with an axe. L is for Leo who swallowed some tacks.  M is for Maud who was swept out to sea.  N is for Neville who died of ennui.  O is for Olive run through with an awl. P is for Prue trampled flat in a brawl.  Q is for Quentin who sank on a mire.  R is for Rhoda consumed by a fire.  S is for Susan who perished of fits.  T is for Titus who flew into bits.  U is for Una who slipped down a drain.  V is for Victor squashed under a train.  W is for Winnie embedded in ice.  X is for Xerxes devoured by mice. Y is for Yorick whose head was knocked in.  Z is for Zillah who drank too much gin.

      Office astrologer:   Obviously it’s impossible to get the details of everyone who has ever committed murder so instead we took some infamous killers and some people on Death Row, fed their stats into the work experience, sorry, office computer and the results are on the right.  So there you go; Sagittarians are most likely to slay. Those born over Christmas have initial memories of joy and happiness but they soon subside, which colours all their future life experiences leaving them disillusioned, depressed and ultimately homicidal.  Or maybe years of being pissed that their Christmas and birthday presents are lumped together mean they go through life with a chip on their shoulder. A “Waaaaahh! I want more presents! Take some more notice of me” kind of thing.    Capricorn--9.8% Aquarius--8.4% Pisces--8% Aries--7.5% Taurus--9.4% Gemini--10.7% Cancer--4.7% Leo--5.5% Virgo--9.7% Libra--6.9% Scorpio--8.3% Sagittarius--11.1%

      A special dye can reveal if someone has urinated in a pool -- Widely circulated rumor  Since the 1950s, such rumors have prevented kids from urinating in the pool.  However, no such dye exists.  As difficult to create an indicator that only reacted with urine and no other organic substances.

      i have finished the game, it is such a good game.  too bad that it is quite short and the plot is unreal (hey, searching for a dreamland called Syberia where mammoths roamed, it is unreal of course).  but the animations and graphics are truly amazing, also the story is quite touching, i almost cried at the end when Hans rides on the mammoth.  the message behind this game:  cherish your visions and your dreams, as they are the children of your soul and the blueprints of your ultimate achievements.

      Jump out of bed as soon as you hear the alarm clock!!  You may also find it useful spending five minutes each morning saying to yourself:  "Every day in every way I am getting better and better, God damn it, everyone likes me!"      Perhaps it is a good idea to start a new day with the right frame of mind.

      People have always wanted mementos of lost loved ones, but death masks and post-mortem portraits were reserved for the wealthy until, in the 19th century, the invention of photography offered something the common man and woman had never had before: a lasting image of a parent or child who had passed.   I'd like to share with you some post mortem photos that I found on the web.  These photos represent a part of American and European tradition.   urlLink Post mortem photos 1    urlLink Post mortem photos 2    urlLink Sleeping beauty  -- featuring a special post mortem photo of King Ludwig II

      The song "Gloomy Sunday" was once banned because of its connection with many suicides.  Apparently alot of people committed suicide after hearing this song.  This song was composed by pianist Reszso Seress and lyricist Laszlo Javor, both Hungarians. Laszlo Javor's girlfriend hung herself to death after hearing this song, and months later, Laszlo Javor killed himself too.  Years later, after WW II had wiped the memory of the suicide song from the public psyche, it became a standard of American performers with released versions by artists as diverse as Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Bjork, Sarah Mclachlan, Sarah Brightman...etc.    I have downloaded at least 5 versions of it and I must admit that this song is a bit eerie and spooky.  Three links for you if you are interested in  the suicide cases, who sang this song, lyrics and more:   urlLink History and a list of artists who sang this song    urlLink Some background of this legend    urlLink More background info and lyrics

      july 1st is canada day.  i used to live here and there when i was in canada, but i never felt i belong to any of these places.  it was fun back then, loads of fun times, friends and stuff.  deep down i know that i don't belong there at all.    i have 14 days of holidays last year but i didn't go back. and this year i have 14 days as well, people said i should go back for a visit.    what for?  there are other nice countries and places waiting for me to explore.

S: "Sin-San, do you do facial ga, you need ga wor. It will help the acne" R: Ahhh, no thank you la. thanks.  And I ran out crying, because I so freaking ugly!!!! So now if you think you are up for the challenge, walk right in and I will get the tissue ready. hehe   &nbsp; urlLink

Especially tomorrow tim ah, because my Sweden boxing instructor will come and beat me up. Look for more in my tomo's blog la.   I brought these Kissing fishes for $10HKD($1.82CDN). Their mouth is ho cutie ga, like they are smiling all the time. The guy who sold me the fishes told me to feed them veggies wor. OK, I will la. I wanted to put more heart into them ma, so I named them too. They are "1,2,3,4,5", 3 looks the best. How can I tell? It is the fattest.   Speaking of fattest, I'm getting really fat lately. I looked at my old photos (all taken in HK, so around 2 yr old la), I was such a supermodel then... So now, I will start a "hell-style" diet sin duct na!!! On Monday. hehe.

      Lately, I've been addicted to the online game Lineage 2 (you should too, tell me what character you are wor so we can play together). I now can play on the North American servers thanks to the support team at Lineage (they are good and effiecnet too). I usually find the service in NA is slower, like the response time is slow. This especially from the gov't. But in HK, gov't ppl are one of the fastest. And if you give some stupid reason, they even wavie your late tax bill penalty ga!!! heheh. but that's another story.   I'm still pretty new to the game (actually to the whole online game concept ah), but starting to manage a little bit lu. Last night because I'm a weak guy, I walk far from the city  so won't get attack by other people la. And I saw somethings beside a rock. So I pick it up. hor hor hor, it's was the most expensive armor, sword, bows and other stuffs. hhahahahha. So I quickly look around and seeing no one is there, I pick, and ran!!!!  I feel bad that someone put their stuff down for a sec (actually hid it too), and hhw came along and pick up all their stuff for FREE ah! I never went back to that place just incase.... cos a good theif don't return to the scene of the crime ga ma. hee hee hee.   I wonder who left their stuffs there ne? Then I remember a kid in HK jump off a building because his weapons are stolen...... ahhhhhhh dim suen ah!

      Hehehe, I haven't posted for quite awhile la, most mainly is because I've been playing an online game ah! It's call Lineage2. I brought the HK version and started playing, then I found out I can't seem to log on to the North American server wor!!! ( actually just wanted to go to a server that my brother Danny can log on to in Toronto) So I started asking them how to play with Danny on the same server la.   Subject: Playing on a server in North America or vice versa  hhw: Hello, I'm a player in Hong Kong. I wanted to play with my brother who is in Canada. Is it possible that we can play on the same server? Me playing on a N.A. Server or him playing on an Asia Server? Is so what is the procedure? Or do I have to download the N.A. inorder to do that?  ( Danny laughed that i said i'm a PLAYER in HK. he's soooo immature) hee hee  Nelson: Hi Raymond, It would be better to play on NA Server, if you both wants to play together on the same server. Take care. Regards.  hhw: However, how do i log on to the NA server? because when I log in from Hong Kong, The only servers i get is all in chinese from 01 to 19. There's no place where i can select the NA servers. What should I do?   Adora: Hello Raymond, I am escalating your ticket up to a Senior Customer Support Representative to further assist you. Someone will be in contact with you as soon as possible. Take care.  GM Paazlar	: Hi Raymond,  In order to access the North American servers, you will need to purchase the North American retail version of Lineage ][ and create an account. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  .... now after i spend my $88HKD ($16CDN), they tell me that. so I bug them again now with how to pay the online fee. after that I'm all set!!!!  Lineage 2 is sooooo addictive, when I got home, I don't icq or check email anymore! yeah! heheheh.

       urlLink    Talked to Dad a couple of days ago and he kindna hinted me that we could get a dog if I wanted (Hope that's what he hinted la). So today, being so excited, me and c-lai when to the SPCA (i think it was in that order) to check out some doggie to adapt. I used to have a black puppy (for 1 day, long story so won't tell la). So I aim for black dog only, or mostly black. There was one I wanted from checking out the site. But when I got there, the dog have such serious attitude thing going on wor, he didn't even pay attention to me. It's fine, cos he's the one that got lock in a cage and nes pas moi! So we check around and saw alot of very cutie puppy eyes from the dogs. They all wanted freedom (except the one I wanted). Then I saw this girl! HO CUTIE X 10! I took a photo of her (which wasn't allow! so good for camera phone, hee hee), then got to carry her and stuff. So "Ghy" (very good behaviour) too and of course pay attention to me la. hee hee. &nbsp; Anyway, will show dad once he came back to HK and see if he really mean to get a dog. cos this little girl grow to a mid-size dog ga. (Smaller than a golden retriever, but bigger than a poddle la) Cross finger for me! hee hee.&nbsp; Hmmm, now what should I name her?

       urlLink     Hey, for those of you who don't know Chinese, here's what the WANTED ad said la.  If you are over 120 lb and with a waist bigger than 28", YOU are qualify to be our spoke fatperson!!! "Don't mind if you are Fat, only mind if you don't show up!" hee hee, quite funny.  &nbsp; But in reality it's not ga. HK ppl are freakingly obessesed with their weight now lu. There's another WANTED ad like this just this pass week, and the result are: 2000+ phone calls (around 127 tonnes of meat) to register and 600+ people (at least 38 tonnes of meat)&nbsp;lined up in cwb (casuewaybay) to be interview for this job. And get this, to be qualify ne, you have to have some sad sad story. If you are a happy fat person, sorry, get out of the way for the sad fatties!!! Most women are like 140-160lb, but of course la, some are like elephant la (but some are only 120 jet), but there's this guy who's competely shameless!!! 295lb, and he said he is much much better looking than the average Joe out there wor.&nbsp; He said he's tall, face is good, if he lost weight, he will be supermodel gor chet ah! ~_~&nbsp; His ideal weight is 100lb.... (even a girl who weight like this is bone la,&nbsp; a guy weighting just 100lb ask for the whole world to beat the crap outta him)....... oh, and even though he's not that ugly, he still not average looking law.&nbsp; But enough about him, some candiates lost their husband to other women because they are fat! So I wait now eagerly to see which candiates they choose. Remember there are over 2600+ (165 tonnes, at least) applicatant ga.  &nbsp; Speaking of dieting, I lost 2 more lbs! making me 138! hee hee. (See! HK people are obessesed about their weight)

Oh and about the arrow pointing to that ECO thing. That's where the taxi driver supposed to put his taxi licence on. So where is it? It's not there!!!! Our taxi driver is not a taxi driver ne ga!!!!!

You can actually know the year by reading the number from the left hand side. Nada (my co-worker) said her wallet was stolen, and when found the next day by police, only this bill was left.

      If I can have a scent, it will be a new car smell. I totally get addicted to it. And I really am ga. The other night I was on a bus back from cwb (causeway bay) to ssp (shamshuipo), and the bus was new!!!! the stair is big and grand! and the upperdeck is even full of a new car smell!!! I kept sniffing all the air so I can treasure it somehow. I think a part of it is still in my lung. hee hee.  So what's new car smell? hit the title of this blog and you will see. Apparently ne, it can cause cancer ga wor, but you know, everything cause cancer, so tell me something I don't know.  But if you really need to have new car smell, but no new car, here's an alternative that I found out. New electric like tv, radio, etc have that smell to ga. But not 100% same around 85%. so that's an alternative. Also Vents on top of TV will have that smell too. I sometime sniff my TV ga! Try it! but the smell gets weak after awhile, and if the TV is on too long, the smell changes too. so it's best when TV is on for about 10 min, then it's good! Let's TRY!  I wish they invent new car smell soon, cos I'm lonely. hee hee

      Here I go again lu. I finished eating my lunch (rice box -- HK style), I think HK style rice box is the ultimate, no other fast food can compare to it ah! EVER!!!! cos basically you can have anything in it.  It's full of variety la and just full of warmth. Today, I have minced beef + raw egg on rice, then tomorrow can have fried Ramen (instant noodle) w/ ham and spam!!! yummy yum!   It also comes in a box not in a bag or just paper wrapped. I remember going to Taiwan and (SOME) drinks that put into a plastic bag and a straw sticking out of it, noodle soup are also put into a plastic bag. The presentation is really bad (cos usually the soup and noodle mixed together making it looks like a vomit bag with vomit INSIDE! ) hee hee. but you know what, it's freaking tasty!!! just tasty, I usually empty out the "vomit" bag, but if it not tasty you can always throw that bag and splash the hell out of the cook like a water balloon!!!!! hehhe, actually that's fun.  You can't do that w/ a rice box though. It just don't have all that drama.  And paper wrap stuff like McD... I don't know, just convienent gar, but it don't have that kindna protection. Feels very empty and light inside.   For now, I'm sticking to my rice box!

      I work on a magazine for a bank in Hong Kong (starts with Heng). They are currently doing a story on Sapa. A village in Vietnam.   Here's what they wanted the picture to be: Show the cultural people there, the village native people and surroundings. After I gave them the photos, here's their questions...  "How come those village people looks so poor? Very dirty village place wor... Do you have some modern looking village people?" WTF X 10!!!  Damn! I knew it! I shouldna choose the one where the village native people was driving their BMW, carrying their Parda and throwing out their last season's Gucci (even though it was designed by Tom Ford).  I have no idea how come my clients are just dumb. It's a freaking village ne ga ma!!!! Of course there's mud, farmland and people that are not in Gucci ga la. so dumb.    Whew~ that felt better. I hope I won't meet any people that will work in a bank. Or I can't back talk them law. hee hee. (oh, except Michael. He's the only cool guy that actually work in a bank (TD? is it?) FOR the people!!!) hee hee

It's used to like Ball room dancing and stuff. cos i saw aunties and uncles going in and shake their 40+ years old bon bon.  Anyway, it was kindna fun. The instructor said there's alot of new people wor. So the gym is way too small for the class. I will get the sword nxt class la. Will of course should u guy on the blog la. But the sword reminded me of the Chicken-feather-brush that my mom used to hit me with everyday except it have no feathers and not as thick la. But I still remember the hate and power in my mom's eyes!!!  I over heard that most student don't last 3 mths then they are gone! I somehow added myself to that list. hee hee.

      How much time do you really spend of work during work hours?  I usually take a break every 20 minute to chat w/ my coworkers la for about 5 minutes or so. so that in 1 hr, i will have 10 minute off ga. Then another 5 to 10 minute per hour to talk on icq and online (like writing this), then around 5 minute to get water and washroom per hours. so in 1 hour, i usually have 25 minute off. hee hee. but i'm sure you guys will have about the same off time as me. OR MORE. I personally think Dabbler have the most lazy time! haa haa haa. Do the post on the right so to let me know la.

      Well, haven't updated much but since I'm kindna bore at work right now, so I think I should keep you guys ( the ppl who read my blog, THANK YOU alot ah) up to date with my dog adopting adventure. I'm lucky that my dad is still pretty excited into finding a dog. He's looking for a Pug though. Anyway, alot of people are helping me to find a dog to adopt ga. So one of my coworker send me a site and there's pug in it ah! so excited la, I went and call them. They said they have to do an assestment to the owner sin wor!  So ok, they fax me a form na and after I read the form, it's scare me.  Heres' the questions that's very scary ah! 1. Do u think it's odd to let your animal sleep with you?  YES la 2. Do you think it's odd to let your animal kiss you? This is ok wor, but no touge law 3. Do you think it's odd to bath with your animal? This one is NASTY!!!!! NO NO NO >_ 4. If you are married in the future and your spouse don't like, will u give up the animal? YES! la, if my wife pick a dog over me, then i think she LOVE bathing w/ the dog...  5. Do you think that we are offensive in asking these questions? mmmmm, YES.   I know what they wanted to said, it's that "YOU SO NEED TO CARE ABT THE DOG!!!", but asking these questions really scare me. So I'm back into step 1, checking out SPAC to see if they have any doggy. Hey, if you have a doggy that needs to adapt, contact me wor! Here's what I'm looking for. A small size dog, don't care if it's puppy or adult, don't care if mixed or pure. ( I like mixed cos they are special!) but have to be small size. PUG size will be good ga. Oh, No Pomeranian.  Thanks la!
