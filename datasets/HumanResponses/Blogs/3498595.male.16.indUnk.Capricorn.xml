      Well, this is my first ever blog ever and I'm thinking of turning it into a tourist attraction of some sort. Most probably an ice-cream stall kind of attraction. It looks good, tastes good and its totally amazing until you finish it...THATS WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU JUST WANT MORE!!! Of course then the blubber keeps adding...but who cares in the end.  MY name's Nick, I'm your friendly next door neighbour that'll risk his life for anything. I'm a good guitarist have just started a band, "The Mooks." So far, I'm lead guitar and singer(I'm an OK singer!!), my close friend Mr L Redpath is my bassist(Lee's an amazing guy!!I actually taught him the skill of guitar and he learned so fast it was unbelievable, Lets just say he's gonna be the next Flea), I have no drummer as of yet, except for my temporary EXTREME, UTTERLY AMAZING Guitarist/musician, XAV!He's helping out with my band and is gonna drum at our first gig. He doesn't even play drums! Then there's rhys,I WANT HIM OUT OF MY BAND!!!!!He's our rhythm guitarist. He's a real cool guy and is fucking great company but he just doesn't work in the band. Its gonna be hard for me to get him out of the band but as soon as our first gig is done he's out.   Well I was meant to be describing myself just then but my band is going to ROCK. Anyway, I'm 16, male, single and I live in Wales!The land of the sheep and more sheep. I like Rock Music, I like drawing and painting, I like playing games and of course I love my guitar. Right now I feel great, probably because I left school just a few weeks ago. Even though I'm in the middle of my exams, I feel so relaxed right now. I feel like I've matured and I feel like more ice-cream. I've just realized that school has actually been destroying my life. I've never been so happy! Well there's more to me than that but my minds gone blank...it does that......Later

      Yeah, these exams are HELL!!!Well I've done 4 since last time and I've got 9 more to go....Hurrah! I don't believe I've done as well on the ones I've done so far, except for maths and geography. I'm hoping for a good grade but I don't care that much. I mean, we all get jobs and people do enjoy better jobs and more money etc. But in the end money is just a piece of paper. I'd rather go be cabin boy on some ship, but I don't have the guts to go away on a crazy journey. Who knows I might do someday.....  Well my exams are almost over and my carefree summer is on its way ROCK ON

      Yeah, lifes aload of poo right now. I've been locked in my own house  for the past 2 days as i have to revise for these damn exams. This makes me bored. Being bored makes me moody. So yup, i'm moody right now. But being indoors on a prefect, cloud free day has taught me something...i dunno what but its taught me something. *sigh* well revision is fun. its a good thing i have a dream of a carefree summer to look forward to, plus i've got some chili peppers to visit!WOOOOOOO.   Oh yeah i found why my grandparents suck. Its because they're asses...they make good pasta though. so its cool in the end  as Tino would say "LATER DAYS"
