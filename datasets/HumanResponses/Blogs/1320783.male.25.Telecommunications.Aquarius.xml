      Filipino pull-out in Iraq not a victory of terror, but a victory of humanity.    Most of the other nations express disappointment at our government's decision to pull out the contingent in Iraq. Many see the act as a "victory of terrorism" or an "act of cowardice". The highly unpopular decision in the international community has, however, won for the government some respect back from their own countrymen, this chap included.    Let the whole world call what they see. They will never understand why our people decided to what was the unthinkable to them. Do they have hundreds and thousands of their own countrymen who journey to far away lands just to keep their families alive? Do other cultures pride themselves of putting their own families ahead of personal interests? Let the people of other cultures call us whatever they see us. They are entitled to their own opinion.    But let me say this - the Filipino pull-out in Iraq is not a victory of terrorism. I choose to see it as a victory of humanity. Why? For the first time in a long time, Filipinos have once more banded together to achieve a common cause - we prayed together for Angelo dela Cruz' safety while in captivity, for his release and his safe return. We all voiced out and asked the government to pull-out from a war that was never ours to win, not ours to finish, and the glory of which is tainted with shame fueled by revenge for an act of shameful violence (September 11, 2001). The government realized and what its' constituents wanted, and with their efforts and the Filipinos countless prayers and vigils, Angelo dela Cruz is now free from the Iraqi captors. A victory of humanity not just in the unity of the Filipinos, but this ensures that the families of migrant workers from our country in the far flung lands can rest their minds that the Filipino people is behind them. A victory of humanity for we have once more pooled our voices and minds together to keep the hopes of the families of these workers alive and their dreams within their reach. A victory of humanity for life has prevailed over death and violence.

      Hell of a day: stayed in the office till about 9 PM integrating codes for a service that is being planned for launch on the 15th. Did some minor refactoring out of similar functions and placed them in the base class. Also, I had to change one of my classes to suit my team-mate's implementation. It took some time to make it work as it failed a couple of times during regression testing, but I got to sort the things out (it took time though).  Missed the live qualifying entirely, but good thing there was a replay on Star Sports. Funny thing was, the code I was doing for most of the day stuck in my head as I blurted out code related stuff, talking gibberish to my mom and my sister about code and blah.  Anyway, integration continues on Monday morning. Before that day ends, the system must be integrated and ready for testing by the carrier. A tough task. Hope everything works out.

      Kimi Raikkonen takes Pole Position in Silverstone     For the first two sectors of the lap, the McLaren MP4/19B that Kimi Raikkonen was driving didn't look much too different than the car they started out the year with. But in the final sector of the lap, the Flying Finn put in some brilliant driving to snatch the top slot for tomorrow's British Grand Prix in Silverstone from the dominant Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro team.  Raikkonen was down four-tenths of a second on then pole-sitter Rubens Barrichello of Ferrari in the first sector of the lap, but cut the deficit to only two-tenths of a second on the second sector. On the third sector, Raikkonen's smooth, slick driving style through the slow corners and an evidently cooperative car erased his deficit and lifted him up to Pole Position.  McLaren and Raikkonen has been struggling for most of this season with car problems, but since the unveiling of the B-specification of the MP4/19 car last week in France, things suddenly look bright for McLaren.  +++  It was a joy to watch, watching last year's title challenger to Michael Schumacher with a better car getting a shot in going head to head once more with the multiple world champion. Kimi is my favorite F1 driver for his style of "letting the driving do the talking". Kimi is the most quiet pilot, a man of few words, but his on track performances reflect his full commitment to racing flat out and starting what could be his future dominance of the sport.  Big congratulations are in order too for Jenson Button, who qualified in third position, outpacing Michael Schumacher who was bumped down to fourth. Button further cemented, with his performance, the informal title of being the top British driver in F1.  I can't wait for tomorrow's race. Will Kimi deliver his second win in F1? Will McLaren give him the right strategy? Will it rain tomorrow? Rain makes for more exciting races, but I hope it stays away. All I want right now is to see Kimi make the headlines with a second F1 win.

      PBA Championship: Gin Kings finally win a PBA title after 7 long years.     1997 was the last year that the Barangay Ginebra Gin Kings won a Philippine Basketball Association championship. Back then, they were backstopped by a prolific three-point shooting import in Chris King, a young and speedy point guard in Bal David, a towering and title-hungry six-foot-nine center in Marlou Aquino and coached by the ageless Robert Jaworski. This year, the cast of characters that made up the team was much different. With only Bal David as the sole surviving member of that championship team, the never-say-die, perennial crowd favorite Ginebra won the Fiesta Cup title against Red Bull Barako in four games of a best of five series in a very convincing fashion: they trounced the determined Barako camp with a devastating 2-3 zone defense and third quarter run built around the fastbreak to come up with a convincing 103-86 victory. Despite a dismal performance from point guard J.J. Helterbrand, shooting guard Mark Caguioa and forward Eric Menk picked up the slack to lead a united effort by the team to its first championship in seven years. The ever familiar chants of "GI-NE-BRA" filled the jampacked Araneta Coliseum, as the celebrations started with over three minutes left in the game, with the Kings holding a commanding 18-point lead. With over eight seconds left, fans and supporters spilled onto the playing court, celebrating the Kings victory which they have long agonized over.

      Nifty day: I was able to finish my targets for today, which was deliver 2 modules for our new service. Finished the classes and the test scripts, stored them into the integration server. The classes passed the tests (the ones that I could think of) and hope that they would pass the administrators' rigid test plans and tests. Two more modules to go, and I hope that they too, will pass testing.  Our company was able to launch a new service today. Cheers to my co-members in the development team for a job well done.  So far, an SMS to E-mail solution that I had soloed is doing well in the internal UAT's. Just a couple more bugs to resolve and a couple of test scenarios to redo then it's gonna be ready for launch - my first commercially launched SMS project!  Another SMS project that I'm participating in is nearing completion, with unit tests showing a very good result. Slowly, I'm starting to fit in with a system (Extreme Programming) that I struggled to deal with during since its adaptation as our company's development methodology. Hopefully we can launch by July 15. I can't wait!
