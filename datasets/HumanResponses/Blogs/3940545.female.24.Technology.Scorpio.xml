        Hey ya'll. Yes I am back and I am alive and well! I must say my trip was a great breath of fresh air for me to have and yes I did need it! Mexico was a blast! Jamaica was a blast! Grand Cayman was a blast! You never realize how beautiful things are until u are out in the open and all u can say is wow! It really makes u sit back and think about all the wonderful things in the world and how precious life is. I did alot of thinking while on my cruise.&nbsp; Well I'm not about to sit here and get all mushy. I'll be all day!&nbsp; But nothing else is new.&nbsp; :( Hopefully I'll have more good things entering my life soon. Hint Hint a man! Cuz I'm tired of sitting my tail on BP all darn day! Now if I can just get my best friend to come and see me here in&nbsp;New Orleans! LOL. I know ur reading this. &nbsp;Later!

        Why does life have to be so unfair? Why does life and love have to be so unfair? How can you want someone and not say something and just let that person slip away? Why did I pass him up? Because I was too foolish to look beyond friendship and didn't open my mouth and tell him how I felt. But shouldn't you start off as friends first and it'll progress into something beautiful and worthwhile? So why was I too afraid to speak my mind? Should I fight my feelings? Or should I just go ahead and tell him how I feel? Even though he is now in a "committed" relationship. Why should I care about his significant other? Maybe its not meant for me to be with him. Hey did he see beyond our friendship and tell me how he felt? Did he pursue me? Why didn't he tell me he was seeing someone else? Why did it take me to ask him? Would he have ever told me if I didn't ask? Why wasn't I aware? &nbsp;But yet you're in love? It takes time to fall in love. You have to have a relationship. So where do I fit in? Was I just a friend and nothing more? Were we dating? I guess not. Guess I was wrong. Did she know about me? Why am I finding out now? So when we went out what was that? When we went to the lounge and had a drink and later chilled at ur house and watched a movie? Do u remember? When u had your arm around me that night? Was that just an excuse to get you out of the house for some fun while she was busy? Maybe they will last. Maybe they won't. Well time to move on.
