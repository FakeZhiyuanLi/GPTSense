      Tonight was the worst best night of my life.  The good things:  ->Got to see andrea ->Got to get out of my damn house ->Got to kiss Andrea (extra good thing)  The bad things:  ->I'm not going to see Andrea again for 2 weeks ->I'm not going to see anyone again for 2 weeks ->Life is going to suck for the next 2 weeks

       urlLink    Wow im really bored I've been working on my driveway laying interlocking brick all morning and its really freaking anoying. It's just so repetitive over and over. So now im inside listening to some Blink and trying to cool off after being out there in that scorching heat for so long. Going away to Killbear to go camping on thursday, not really looking forward to that, going ot miss Andrea A LOT and it will probobly be boring as hell. After I get back form camping on the 16th I have one day free, then my parents decided it would be a good idea for me to go to camp...FREAKING CAMP I'm so glad my parents were nice enought to plan my entire summer for me, how thoughtfull... THOSE FREAKING ASSHOLES. Anyways im not going to back from camp untill like early august (the first or second not sure which) at which point I will probobly have gone insane from lack of friends and fun. Well anywho i better eat something because im going to a movie with andrea tonight and i don't want to be starving.

       urlLink    Just got back from Lacrosse, WOW WE SUCK. The scoreboard said 8-2 for Owen Sound (I play the the Guelph 2 team) But they stopped counting goals half way through the first period. It was really more like 18-2

      Well here i go again! i just fucking typed this whole thing out but andy sent me something and it crashed internet explorer! So here i am creating my first blog. What am i doing? what made me want to do this? I mean really! what kind of a loser makes a blog? obviously a pretty bored one. lol. My house sucks i have nothing to do except work on my freaking driveway which is annoying as hell! I wish something exciting would happen in puslinch like a big fire or a ninja knife fight in my backyard, now that would be entertaining lol. I wish i was anywhere but here im sooo bored or at least i wish somebody was here with me. Like my beatiful girlfriend andrea, Then i'd be having fun!
