      Well here I am starting another week with a full house of kids. One child has already started with the mouth saying " she (meaning me) thinks she knows everything!" And I have finally came to the conclusion that if the kids dont like it here, or like my rules.... GET OUT! I am not going to live my life for inconsiderate children. I didnt come into this marriage for the reason of being a maid, or slave. I came into this marriage because I love the man I married. I came into this relationship because he is a good dad to my kids and he completes me. I just dont know how much love I can hand out, or how much stress I can take. Funny how some people can't take too much of things, while others can. I am definantly not one of the ones who can handle stress.

      I recently, a couple days ago hurt my neck again. Its been over 2 years since I injured it at work. It never heals! Doctors want to dish out pills and tests, and the chiropractor.... Well that works for a little while and its hard to make the time. I have my good days and bad days though.  I slept better last night then I did the night before. Sleeping with hubby is hard enough because of his cover-bunching, snuggle grabbing self! But I couldn't live without him!!  I am not sure why I started writing these simple blogs, I suppose so I can find things to complain about from the looks of my first two writings hehehhee. But you know, it makes things easier to get off your chest. There are times when some things cant be said to others. Healing takes time, and you start with the inside and work your way out. Not that I need emotional healing, I am ok there I think, but its good to express. My healing mainly is physical which would make me feel better all around.

      Just in simply terms, its me going off the deep end when there is so much going on in my head. I can't take the stress everyday that is around me. I am not one of those people who can. I am looking to get back into working out or meeting friends for coffee more, once the kids are out of school. Hopefully that will help some. Sometimes i can just scream!!
