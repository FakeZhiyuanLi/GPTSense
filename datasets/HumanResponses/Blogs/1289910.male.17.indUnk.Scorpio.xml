      just watched mean girls yesterday and it was a fun movie. not only because of the story and humorous language but it was because of lindsay lohan!i dont know what happened to that girl... from a young, innocent girl from parent trap she turned into this teenage sex symbol in mean girls. well regardless on how she changed, it was all good and im lovin it. she's so hot...hehe        i just thought while watching the movie... do you really have to be mean in order to fit in and survive?   in my case, im not really a mean person... ok maybe a little but my meanness is tolerable, i think... but anyweiz, i think with my happy go lucky, wild personality im showing everyone, the onlye thing i dont get is R-E-S-P-E-C-T... i dont know but its such an issue to me. if getting 'mean' means people will be afraid to mess with you and will earn you respect even in a negative way, i'd rather be mean! maybe im just so tired of being the butt of 'some' (not really 'all') jokes. for years now its always been the same, im the tall guy with the big nose with all the 'kabastusan' in mind, who prioritizes extra curricular activities more than the academics.. a class officer who tries to lead a class who find it so hard to pay repsect and listen... the misunderstood son/nephew or black sheep rather in the house who would think first of his friends welfare rather than himself. and the person (or is it animal?) who always has a smile on his face which is an irony of his true emotions.   well there is no one more to blame than of course myself because whatever it is happening right now is a result of all my actions. i let it happened... and i cant just go blaiming other people for my own stupidity. people disrespect me because that is how i showed my personality. do you think if i just shut up and isolate myself from all of them, they will still do the things they do to me now... of course not... sometimes its better not to exist i guess.   im just hoping that the next time someone even tried to mess with me i could channel all my anger and just explode. its hard keeping it all inside you know...

      we had our first general assembly today at mediartrix. it was ok. we have a chance to interact with the new members. i wouldnt say that it was very organized but we managed to survive and went on with the GA. we had some difficulties with the venue since the guard is asking for a formal letter. thnx to kapatid na sam and we succssfully reserved the AVR which is a better venue compared to the origibal one which is only a room. the GA couldve been better with some performances from dang and ate joy but ok na rin yung kanina... i do hope that the new members enjoyed it.  &nbsp;  mama called before i left for the GA and i talked with jef... papasok na daw cya ng school on monday and he is very excited na. i talked with kuya din and i can tell he doesnt want to share with me his salary since he doesnt want to give me even a slight idea on how much he is being paid.  &nbsp;  before i end this journal entry i would like to ask kung si britney ba to? i got this email saying that it came from her 400M dollar photoshoot with playboy    &nbsp;          &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      For the first time i went home early (mga before 12) and i had all afternoon to myself. instead of sleeping all day i updated the  mediartrix  website and posted the list of successful applicants for this year. i also updated the  nadine samonte official website  specially the forums since a guy named jonathan oandasan who is so assuming that he claims himself as nadine's boyfriend from canada and that he will be coming home here to be a star. i bet he couldnt even make it to the auditions haha. whoever he is, i hope he just shut up. i already made necessary courses of action (i deleted and banned him from the message board)so i dont think he will be bothering me anymore.  We dont have classes tomorrow so im planning to do something productive with my time since bihira kami mawalan ng pasok. But regardless of the "holiday", sobrang pagod pa rin ako, kulang sa tulog and cyempre ngarag.

      it was a tough day for me.   i tried to wake up early to make my english assignment which i eventually finished (i wrote it in the house,the fx and in the AB stairs). I was late for english which really disappointed me because the very reason i was late is that i was cramming for the assigment. i worked so hard then i wouldnt be able to submit it?!?!?! Good thing mam perena still accepted it though i was marked absent.   i managed to survive math because  i didnt finish the exercises... thnx to peaches i got a passing grade because as mam dictates the answers she wrote it in my workbook, hehe. Talk about cheating huh  i also did the photocopying duties for filipino although i got so pissed at those people who doesnt pay the amount to be payed and worse to those people who are very disrespectful and inconsiderate of all my efforts. SANA MAKARMA KAYO! ****** ** nyo! Just pray na di kayo mapagbalingan ko when the time comes na napuno na ako promise. You'd wish you shouldve studied in FEU rather than in UST.  I also survived the journalese meeting. thank god ate deni didnt look at the proposed logo she asked me to do. the website layout is due on tues so i hope i can make it on time.   i havent posted the list of succesfull applicants for mediartrix nor called the new members for the general assembly. for the first time i feel so pressured and sometimes i just cant handle it. i wish i could just sleep for one whole day and dont think of all these responsibilities. it's a total overload...

      Last saturday was our acquaintance party held at the Quezon City Sports Club. In fairness the place was good and it looks really elegant. Peaches and I arrived there at around 8 i guess. There were lots of picture taking as usual and typical jokes/pranks were pulled on one another.   Food was already served and as usual we immediately fell in line. The food tasted great although some were a little new to me. As expected my plate was very full since i took all the dihes served on the buffet table. Since birdie and ainj were very busy facilitating the party they dont have time anymore to line up and wait for their turn thats is why nakikain na lang sila sakin and the result is: elegant food turned into kaning baboy. The funny part was when kuya joel reminded that the main dish was only the lechon and the rest were the side dished to CHOOSE from. hehe nakakaguilty kasi yung iba la ng nakain. I have lots of left overs pa naman.   The prepageant already started and it was really fun. We did the usual 'POGI' chant for Rafa. It was a bit long but that doesnt stop us from taking on the dancefloor because right after the prepageant the party started.  As usual we we danced as if we were overdosed of ecstacy. May konting eksena lang ng may sumabog na light bulb. Everyone went out but because everyone is still on party mode, we all went in again after the bulb thingy was fixed.  We were the last group of people there and went home at around 1:30am. Ainj, Birdie and Nascel slept at Tita Grace's derm clinic while i decided to just sleep at my own room which is just on the fifth floor of the same bldg. As soon as i changed my clothes the next thing i knew it was already morning and peaches was already calling on my phone asking me to come down to have breakfast and just chat...

      i know its a lil delayed but still i would like to narrate our UAAP experience for this year.  atty and i went there at around 9am and luckily there are only a few number of people waiting in line. we got an upper box a ticket and decided to stay first at wendy's since araneta wasnt opened yet. when we went in we immediately noticed this group of girls in a long table there chatting loudly as if they owned the place. they turned out to be the DLSU cheering team. they were a bit bitchy and feeling beautiful although some of them do have the potential, physical that is. when they left a group of guys came in and to our surprise it was the DLSU green archers. from all the tables available there at wendy's tehy chose to sit beside our table (dont know why). and fortunately for atty, joseph yeo sat on her right side. being big boys they surely have a big appetite. we even overheard them talking about christian luanzon that he came from a chinese school and that he is "mayabang". since we are outnumbered i didnt react na lang, hehe.   after that we already went to the araneta and lined up. we were in front of teh line for upper box and luckily we got our much awaited freebies from smartb which is a tarpaulin with a school cheer written on it. of course i took one from UST, atty got UP and we also got one for min of course from DLSU.   we sat on UP again and from what i saw there ateneo's presentation last year was much better compared to that of la salle. they made of for their 'unpreparedness'(i think they were not that prepared) through the pyrotechnics and laser display which should be considered a display at all iff you know what i mean.   the game has started already and min still wasnt there. we thought she wouldnt be coming but surprisingly she just popped from the back and sat with us.   we had to leave early since atty still got a class. its a bit fast for min since she just arrived but we all agreed that its better that we have the chance to be together again even for a short while than not to see each other at all. we alre8ady agreed that we will make it up to her through the UAAP cheering competition which is hotter and has a higher intensity specially between UST and UP. will UST keep the throne or will UP take them down? hhmmm... ano nga kaya....

      sometimes we just have to keep our mouth shut. why? well let me count the ways...  at computer class i was running a lil late that when i came in i immediately clarified to mam lintag that im not late (which was supposed to be 'im not absent') with my usual joking intonation. she answered back 'yes you are' and i explained that i just picked some stuff up still grinning a lil bit. she then commented that 'its not cute' then i answered back 'its not not cute nga'. then all of a sudden she blurted out loud that 'you keep on answering'. and then it hit me thats she is not in a good mood. i just said sorry and sat down. thnx to my big mouth i got humiliated.   just when i thought it was over my mouth strikes again as i said some stuff that paved way to some issues between me and my pinakabest friend. ( i need not to elaborate on that since its way too personal ). but all's well between us now.  aside from the fact that i should keep my mouth shut i should also keep in mind just like Niel "the higher power" Lim said, to   THINK BEFORE I SPEAK THINK BEFORE I SPEAK THINK BEFORE I SPEAK THINK BEFORE I SPEAK THINK BEFORE I SPEAK  sometimes you just have to control it you know... as much as you wanna burst out your ideas you just have to keep it in...  moving on, i already signed up at Gmail, thanks to blogger... my eadd would be janenriquez@gmail.com. cant wait to use up the 1000MB capacity! wehehehe  mica called kanina to tell me about her father's death. it was so sad because he died of an operation. i didnt quite get the story coz i was busy getting the multimedia projector when she called which explains why i wasnt able to 'symphatize' with her that much because i was a bit destracted.  i went home early to clean my room, do some laundry so that i can go watch the UAAP season opening tomorrow at the araneta. for sure this will be a blast with all the school spirit and deafening cheers from competing universities.  ano pa ba... thats basically it for now. tomorrow will be our acquaintance party and la pa rin ako isusuot, bahala na lang siguro. for sure i could find a way naman.

      Obviously this is my first post here in my new blogger account. IN fairness blogger has a new look *applaudes*. But regardless to that im still thinking of new concepts and only 2% done on the jounalism society website. Kulang kasi ako sa resources such as pictures and im only using html instead of flash (hehe as if marunong ako magflash). Kaya sorry na lang muna to Kuya Niel ("the higher power") kasi di ko matatapos ang site before acquaintance party on saturday. After journsoc, i have to make the journalese website din. O di ba... san ka pa... ngaragan ito! Oh well, my fault din kasi tinanggap ko yung offer. Bahala na si batman, este spiderman na lang since uso siya ngayon.=)
