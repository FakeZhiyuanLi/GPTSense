      So this is my first post ever. On what I might as well consider a diary. Which is completely pointless seeing as I hate diaries and all they stand for. So let's just call this, a meeting of my mind and my soul. Yeah, that's cliche enough to be catchy. I am awesome.  Right now I wish I had a little piece of happiness, like a couple sheets of bubble wrap. So I can safely package things and than send them to myself. Once recieving said package I shall do what all do. Not give a damn what I recieved, lay sheets of bubble goodness and jump around.  Yeah, I'm cool.  So my name is Anna and I live in a little town that I hate and would never name because it might infect me. Or something to that scary extent. Exactly.  Anyway, I'm fourteen years old and I am a freshmen. O I suck. But look yander, the year is almost up. And I shall be a sophmore. A smore, as some say. How idiotic is that? High School is such a waste.   Today my boyfriend came over at one in the morning. Bad idea, yes. Sunshine (Erika) and I had quite a time trying to sneak his ass out at five in the morning. Very hard. He almost killed himself thinking he could jump off the roof. Sometimes, guys confuse me.   But we were cool and played Dead End Drive. O yeah, that cat is so cool. Except it kept dying. Beside the point of course. It has small ears, which makes it cool.   Sunshine went through her Manic high of the day. It was entertaining.  "Haha, that's beautiful."  I have a killer case of insomnia that I have decided is not my friend. (Hence title of this said post.) Connections, everywhere.   MTV is bad. Why are we watching this? Sunshine, your sunny disposition is clouding my lifestyle. O pun after pun after pun. A serious caution fish has surfaced. Beached itself as one might say.   Except no one understood that. I did and sunshine did and Jim might. So HA! It's all good in Anna's life of awesome coolnesss.  Be glad that I have medication.
