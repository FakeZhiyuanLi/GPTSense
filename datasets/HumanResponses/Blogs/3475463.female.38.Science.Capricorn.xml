						   I can honestly say that from the time I was around 8, I have been fat and as life goes on, I keep getting fatter, today weighing in at a hefty 328 pounds and my blood pressure 140 over 100...NOT GOOD! Well, it's not fun being over 300 pounds.  I had a VBG several years ago and lost 141 pounds and gained all but 30 pounds back.  I was ashamed and felt like a failure but it was getting me no where..joining a gym did nothing either and for months I was dedicated....going up to 6 times a week.  Finally I gave up and quickly gained more weight... Today I visited Dr. Bolar at the Bariatric Institute of KY.  He has performed over 3000 surgeries/gastric bypass and his patients have a lot of success.  He is dedicated it seems and follows his patients in their success...he puts no price on health  Where I have had a VBG (vertical banded gastroplasty) he will have to undo that and then perform the other surgery.  Normally his surgeries take 1 hour, but for me two, because of the previous surgery.  I go Tuesday June 1 for a psychiatric visit, which is standard procedure, then Wednesday for a gastric scope to see if the staples from the previous surgery have come loose or busted open.  I will be put under that day so Josh is taking me.  I'm really praying the insurance will cover this but I have to meet a certain criteria...so thus begins my journey...my journey of one behind a well worn path of many morbidly obese Americans.  So if you happen upon this blog, you can laugh or snicker...or you can pray that someday I will be able to go outside and play with my 8 year old twins without being so exhausted and tired all the time....

						   Well, I went for my sleep study last Thursday night (6/3/04).  I continue to suffer from apnea but now, also, hypopnea.  I not only snore but when not snoring, I breath so shallow it appears as if I am not breathing at all... Today, 6/8/04, I went to Cooley medical and got my c-pap machine.  I have to sleep with this machine every night with distilled water.  I had no  problems using the machine several years ago..but I am sure it will take time to adjust, once again, to sleeping in a mask with continual air forcing me to breath. Thursday, I go to the local health department at 1:00 pm, to see a registered dietician.  This is also part of what I need to do for the insurance.  Hopefully the surgery will be soon.  Keeping this in prayer would be greatly appreciated if you happen to run across this page and wish to do so.  My kids are excited but I have not told them about surgery...they are excited because they think mommy is on a diet and will be losing weight so I can play with them now.  I don't want them to worry...so I will wait until I have a definite date for the surgery before I sit them down and speak to them about it.  Other than all these tests and visits, things have been well in my life.  Until another day, signing off for now.. Bonnita

						   Today, I went to see Dr. Steger, a psychologist.  I had to fill out all kinds of paper work which took about 35 minutes..then an hour visit with him.  He was pleasant enough but was matter of fact in many aspects of my life, knowing a bit of my past he sees a possible future seeing psychologists to help out in troublesome areas..and he knows I need to follow up with a support system as well as the support groups offered.  In the morning, I have the GED and Thursday night, I have a sleep study, they called and scheduled that this morning. So...another day..another journey..looking forward to where my tomorrows can take me...
