      Today.. or rather yesterday was another day at band. what else would make me come here and write? =) ok.. basically.. we're now in the viewing room.. must say it has a weird-ass smell.. can't yet decide if i like it or not though.. but it IS kinda cool and the view overlooking the field is fantastic.. not that there's anything to see (it's only boys playing soccer.. and they suck!) but rather i enjoy the feeling of ease and comfort it brings. Had geog supplementary today, then band, phototaking, alumni, and lastly a nice chat with a few good friends. Geog.. voting day! Seriously.. if the choices they make are wrong.. we can be in for a VERY screwy 2 years.. and i really hope that doesn't happen. =P well.. band on the other hand.. was pretty much the same.. she even came up to tell me she saw me on tv! when i realised what she meant.. i was like >.

ALL LATE! and i was waiting for like 10 minutes.. yes band pres also late!! =X annyyyway then i was walking around like an idiot when they finally decided to set up shop, so then i think they found me dangerous looking so they sent melvin -who looked rather scary then- to meet me. Then, with the crap cleared up i was on my way to play... the trombone! lol! if u dont already know.. i play the tuba. but apparently there are too dang many of em'. so then i get the GREAT beauuuutiful... twombone. haizz.. but.. the people are reallly friendly at band.. most notably my seniors. =) k la.. dun nid name.. both rawks! oh yeah then theres this girl.. shall decline to mention her name for now.. yes super nice! hmm.. came up to me to ask me my name, basic courtesy, but it just so happened she couldnt hear me.. some guy blasting on the drum set. so she mistook my name for..... PATRICK >.

ANYWAYYyy i miss my sec school.. especially my sec 4 class.. all the outings.. all the fun.. all the FOOD!! guess i hafta to count myself lucky for not getting into fit club YET. ohh.. today was gay day! project work. lol.. how can girls be so comfor-freaking-table with stupid crapola especially when it deals with GAYS. i mean.. can't we all just PRETEND to live in a straight world? whys we gotta walk up to em' gays and say, ''hi. are you gay? i'd like to survey u =) oh and by the way.. make it quick.. i've got a deadline to meet.''  >.

      Let me intro you a little to humble lil' me. My name, if you haven't already fathomed, is David. meaning u call me that. and not with derogoratory terms that many people love to just because i'm so darned hot! literally.(ok the last relatively chim word i used will stay the last. hopefully. because cheeem words tick me off and more importatnly U MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND! =X hence cheeem =D ) yeah.. bloody aircon doesn't seem to work when u friggin want it too... >.  Sunday morning rain is falling Steal some covers share some skin Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable You twist to fit the mold that I am in But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew That someday it would lead me back to you That someday it would lead me back to you  That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning And I never want to leave  Fingers trace your every outline Paint a picture with my hands Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm Change the weather still together when it ends  That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning And I never want to leave  But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you Singing someday it'll bring me back to you Find a way to bring myself home to you  And you may not know That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see Come and rest your bones with me Driving slow on Sunday morning and I don't ever wanna leave

      stop me if you've heard this before.. '' i haven't studied a single thing.. im sooo dead..'' well let me pain ur ears again as i repeat it over and over again. admittedly.. i loved my holidays and all the outings and trip over the causeway and especially the fun times in bannd. however it pains me as well to decide now that i am truly and finally.. dead. not only have the terms been creeping up slowly and carefully.. i have done nothing to ensure i do not get beheaded by it.. even now here i am gleefully writing about how im gonna die tml for my 1st exam. yikes.  Maybe i could, as before recount happy things that happened this holiday.  1)band concert- heckuva fun experience playing a 'foreign' instrument and making my section nervous as they watch me blow the place to bits. 2)trip to m'sia.. sadly missed the band chalet but spent time with relatives who came from the u.s and boy was the food good! =) 3)uncontrollable eating + NO PE!! - man am i dead when i get to thursdays on the track. 4)meeting up with sec school friends over the course of holiday and pwing them - only in mind however - in all forms of entertainment including pool. 5)laming YOUR ass off in blogs like these =) It is kinda sad isnt it then that this is probably the first blog in which i feel kinda down.. p.s if ur reading this over a course of a week after its published.. ur screwed for terms too =) kidding.. but i HAVE to make myself feel better dont i? i think the number of smiley faces has been decreasing as school reopening draws ever nearer.. well i better end off with a happy thought, lest thou shalt find thy mind filled with endless sorrow and LUNACY.  6) SWITZERLAND TRIP! ALRIGHT! 1st band trip ever overseas.. boy am i excited.. all i can hope for really is that the a) plane dont crash b) i dont fall sick and c)we do well in the competition over there! well for those who are wondering at the sanity of doing this on the eve of apocalypse, wonder no more. there is entirely no special reason why im killing myself writing this instead of studying other than the fact that i realise im gonna play cs again. now. make any sense to u? not to me either. =D (= *screwed*

      Yes! its finally over! the band concert yesterday.. ahh.. after weeeeks of hard practice and countless hours spent at the viewing gallery.. ITS OVER!! but damn.. cos i wont be seeing some of the j2s nemore.. feel kinda sad.. had lots of fun together especially during outtings.. and yes *ahem* someone won't be going back for many practices. And then of course the terms are coming, can't really say how i feel about it.. haven't even started studying other than going for some remedial lessons.. theres this foreboding sense in me that im gonna screw my exams up again like all others.. just because i dont FEEL like studying.   Well.. maybe to brighten myself up i could recount the entire day yesterday.. it WAS rather enjoyable.. well first.. was the woooorst part of the day - i couldnt wake up! stared at the alarm clock half in dreamland for 2 agonising hours before i finally dragged my fat ass out of bed.. and booyy was it good.. i had been practising long and hard and finally i could show what i could do! Ahh.. damn them all.. they think i'm supposed to turn into some trombone god over a nice ''long'' period of 3 months.. bah! what do they know. with that thought conveniently flushed out of me, i proceeded to realise.. it was 10! omg! i was supposed to meet the trumpets euphoss and trombones at 11:30.. i was sooo screwed! rushing like mad.. i realised.. ITS ONLY 9! omg.. i must be pajiao or something.. turned and took a good second look and realised.. PARALLAX ERRROR... Dooots! haha.. pathethic huh? Well decided against my better judgement to practice the trombone.. just a little.. was forewarned over msn last night by someone that it would affect my embrouchre.. but ahhh what the heck.. i dont have a proper one for trombone anyway.. lol. Well.. skipping how i walked to the bus stop and took the bus.. i was on my way to the MRT.. and guess who i saw.. someone from band i didn't really know! ahha! That only means one thing.. lame time! but dammit that womans hard to handle.. her names jennifer.. j2 flute player.. quite pro from what i hear during practice. I realised that shes actually a nice and quite chatty person.. and mentally slapped myself for not taking initiative to 'bond' with more people in band. We went to jurong.. where we decided.. since it was only 11:00 that we should be ''fashionably late''.. well actually.. we just knew no one would be there on time.. so what the heck! =) she thinks like me! haha! Met a few others at jurong itself then made our way to come in at a decent 20 minutes later!   Well yeah she was there.. but so was her he. Lol. the problem being that hes my friend too.. gay. Understanding what i just said is not of primary importance her.. just to understand that.. life sucks! But there was something.. we were wearing the same brand name.. Billaabonnng! wow congrats david! bet you're the only IDIOT who noticed that. Well.. ANYWAY.. we went allll the way to eat at the famous and very fine restaurant of McDonalds! Hot damn it was crowded.. with us and our instruments.. its really unfair how i am the only one lugging around the mother of bulky craps.. NO the tubas arent counted cos they're all on the lorry! unfair! Bah.. at least i didnt actually HIT anyone.. a credit to my negotiation skills with my case. *grins* You know i realise how either  a)innocent b)sick c)just like me D)NUTS  she really is.. the first thing about a huge bird statue she notices is the a**hole! lol! understandably we DID approach it from behind (not in that way hor!) so the first distinguishing feature that separates it from other monuments of avians is the gigantic GAPING hole in its rear! lol! ha.. it was a long enjoyable lunch.. talking to john and johnathan.. two fun guys i've come to regard as good friends since i came to acjc.. and band. Well.. it was time to head for the concert hall itself.. and we took a few fun photos there before we got some warmup then to eat.. again! haa yesterday was foodfest i swear.. i ate a shizzload.. sinful! =X sadly not everyone was catered for so i headed over to mcdonalds fine restaurant AGAIN.. but this time i didnt eat anything.. really.. just accompanied a friend.. marco. Doesn't know if it was appreciated but it doesnt matter.. friends dont stand on ceremony with each other.. take advantage of that while u can!  Then finally.. it was the big thing! Had fun in the guys dressing room with several deranged people who i believe just recently escaped the boys home and somehow got their hands on saxophones to create.. wonderful music! i love that.. i must be deprived not to know that they were playing final fantasy... chocobo's theme or something like that. Well.. after that.. it was the concert! can't say i was really nervous.. i had been to too many concerts to feel to have a case of nerves.. the only thing really nagging me was my section.. they had high expectations of the entire section as a whole.. and even if i felt i wasn't good enough, they probably did.. and i didn't want to let them down. Besides getting a tight fit in the blazer (like whats new?) i felt i was ready to play my best! by the way.. the mcs looked great! haha!  Ah.. the performance came and went.. thudnerous applause sounded.. and it was over! we did it! tien tee never looked so happy.. lol! after all the trauma he caused to the children in the audience wearing those little ''gifts'' for each song the j2 exco gave him.. at least we pleased him! no more '' your intonation sucked.. play in tune please''.. but instead.. '' well done guys!'' ah.. that was REAL music to my ears..  After the success, a large group of us including jian xiang qizhen yong thieng james dominic david and jun ming went to KAP.. and it was the lamest ever time on earth.. really! they procalaimed the restaurant to be closed.. and we had to order from the drive-in.. queueing with the cars! hahaha never had such an experience but we had a good time laughing it out.. after which i returned home exhausted.. thinking.. mission accomplished. but with also the realization that.. I HAD LIT TOMORROW! dang.. fairytale just got headshotttttteeeed!  I will never forget this day.. i won't see many people that often anymore, friends will always be friends however, and if any of them really do regard a friendship seriously.. it will blossom.. until then.. all you who i might not see anymore, health and luck especially in ur 'A's' and have fun! life isn't only band! =)

      It was on&nbsp;july 27th, 2004&nbsp;at about 7pm,&nbsp;that acjc band life officialy became.. lonelier. My seniors are gone. no more professional bass trombone sounds will echo and vibrate the hall. no more her. no one to guide me. no one to disturb and&nbsp;receive comical results. less friends. smaller world. Yet there is a lack of a sense of sadness within me.. i am not sad to see them go. neither am i happy of course, except happy for them.. because i believe they left with fond memories of our band. but what could be the reason that i do not feel their loss? maybe it stems from the fact i'll probably still see them around school.. or that they'll be coming back to visit us for a practices. we, the j1s are now officially in charge.. or the j1 committee at least. didnt get a post.. didnt expect one.. but i believe the new committee was well chosen. it was a time of warm goodbyes on July 27th. it marked the first time i had ever given my wonderful seniors presents.. and the look on their faces was reward enough.. i swear they looked like they were&nbsp;gonna go home and cry.. not that i blame them or think its sissy of course.&nbsp; as i write this, i realise i feel sad NOW. not then.. the euphoria of saying goodbyes and present giving must have overcome this feeling. its painful to know that no longer will we play together - maybe once more- but thats it.. the short less-than-1-year has drawn to a close. its damnn fast if u ask me.. i couldnt have been to more than 30 practices and *poof*- they're gone. shes gone too.. probably wont ever see her.. maybe its for the best.. its time to start being realistic.. and goal oriented. bleah.. what crap. i am sad now.. but i guess i can finally commit things to god.. yes i do believe there is one.. if it is what it&nbsp;is meant to be.. it will be.. and if its not.. well. As life with them draws to this chapter.. i remember.. i am no longer from maris stella.. its time to be a real part of acjc.. band. what the hell.. sounds like the compo i wrote for o levels.. bloody sentimental crap.

      I'm feeling particularly philosophical now.. so i shall delve into the topic of true love. What is true love? often asked.. and answered with, '' when u meet someone whom you know you want to spend the rest of you life with, more often than not that thought is reciprocated, knowingly, connections are just made.'' and then you realise that person has a significant other. what do you do then?  maybe we shall start from the when. when do you know that your true love is in front of you? some say the stars shine brighter, if its at night, and some say the sun is muted and the clouds cover it just nicely in the day. i say who the hell cares about the bloody scenery when the one is standing in front of you.  and theres always the what. what do you do after that? after the first glance, the second stare.. then what? again, the common answer, from my experience, is pretend nothing happened.. the reason again being that if it IS true love.. surely there will be another chance.. when you have gathered the strength and courage to do so? no. wrong. you will never get another chance. the next time it will be raining, you cant keep your eyes open.. next time there will be no stars.. you cant see nothing. lame? tell me about it.  next is the who. may you be gay, god bless you damned soul.. yes it IS a sin. anyway.. what if the person you liked never knew you existed? the chance meeting between the eyes just another glance like any other, the reflection of light from the sun playing tricks on what you see. even worse, the person does know you, does know.. what would happen then? awkward, it would be, to ever meet again? yes. and no. sometimes not everything is in black and white. this is often said.. but u will truly realise everything in life IS black and white. gray is just the transition between both, when your senses are confused about what you see. back to the point. who? what if her name began with a soft whisper as you spake it? a dead giveaway, how do you remain civil when emotions begin to grab you left right and centre?  nevermind the nonsense above, but then after that comes.. the how. how do you go about solving the fire burning in your heart that rages on and on and on? extinguish it? a dead husk would be left behind. caress it? it would just burn on. add fuel? byebye. no.. the only way is to bring the only thing that can stand the test of fire into you heart.. love. but how? i never really answered my question in essence.. are you confused? yes you should be.. because i am too.  &nbsp;

      recently, i find that everything can be blogged, bitched about and scandalised.&nbsp; its kinda out of point in the acs i band context but i seriously believe some people reallllyyy need to be *cleansed*, yours truly as well. =P it has been barely 4 days since the switz trip ended and i find myself missing band and my instrument already. helping the acs i band then, seemed like such a fun thing to do at the time, i thought maybe the trombone section really sucked and my *ahem* noobness would not be that easily spotted. but nooo.. of all the crap they had to do.. the bass trombonist had to be sec4.. the only sec 4 in that section.. and man was he pro. not as pro as guosh certainly and possibly not as good as me *blinks* but hes only 1 year younger and undoubtedly will become damn pro nxt yr. reality check david- u have been in band for 4 years.. theres no real difference between the tuba and trombone so why do u still suck at it? i have been scolded numerous times for my playing or misplaying but if i love band so much wouldnt i be driven to excel? where then, lies the real problem? overall, i dont see why dr lee is so pissed with acs i band because in truth, when i hear them, and compare them to acjc practices, theres not much difference. y cant every1 c that we kinda suck? a gold a year ago does not guarantee another next year. i sound like such an analyst but its the truth, at this rate the most we can achieve next year is a silver. ahhh.. not to dampen anyones spirits so quickly after the uplift from switz but this is a reality check for all of us acjcians as well. we suck as a band without the j2s. bonding is good but its not everything in band. drawing e line between both has to be done. it will be too late to realise next year at the syf that after all the damn photo taking, we arent in tune. who'll be laughing then?

      WOw! the trip is at long last.. over. I would say i had enjoyed myself alot.. but thats an understatement! this would be the second time i have gone with schoolmates overseas.. and the experience is always quite fun without parents to nag at u. no... teachers dont count.. cos they give u more freedom =) the only downside to the trip was the huge prick in my heart when i realised how much the stuff we were to buy would cost. holy Sh*t! i could buy 4 singapore mcdonalds meals for 1 in switzerland.. lol! ahh.. the chocolates were pure heaven.. discovered liquor chocs there.. omg they RAWK. i think ive become an alcoholic.. hahah! ahhh... the trip wasnt all that bad considering she didnt go.. and i actually did have fun even though i was actually kinda forced to go. well.. the competition was really an eye opener too.. we realised ac band is not all it is made out to be unless every single person decides that he or she is not *special*. we also needed to learn coordination and all that stuff.. man i feel tired just talking about that lol. suffice to say the parts playing instruments were not as fun as sightseeing at leat a hundred mountains a day.. yes it DOES become quite monotonous after a while looking at peak after peak of perfection.. =P.  the highest points in the trips would have to be the food i guess.. haha i sound like such a glutton.. eating cheese fondue.. pizzas.. and *gasp!* rabbit meat! i have the picture of the rabbit we saw at the top of the stairway at rhinefalls etched in my mind forever.. with the second picture of rabbit meat cubes fried to solid imperfection doused with unhealthy sauce. yyuuuucksss. lol. ahhh i have alot to b*tch about on the tour but maybe i should just end soon. the people there are really laid back and open minded.. just like the restaurant waiters at a certain Bebbie's. boy oh boy they do really enjoy ripping us off and making us even dance sing and scream just for free... coke. ahahha i realised alot of crappy lame stuff happened there.. like seeing a guy jack off in the middle of our group.. that dirty old man.. and seeing circular rainbows. well the people i spent the most time with as a group would be ian yong kiat samuel and james.. they made the trip a very fun experience.. although i was not as close to them as those on the other bus. =/. well maybe there shall be a part 2 to this blog but until then all i have to say is i love the people on my bus to bits because they helped make the experience to switzerland more fun and exciting.. namely jovan the donkey and ian the llama. =) haha ''ill be back''.

      i shoud start this blog by saying a great goodbye to the j2s - today's national day performance was their last and we realllyyy won't be having official practices with them anymore. as before.. this is a sad and solemn occasion where we shall have a moment of silence for the last few moments we might see them in band.     ... and then...   PArrrTAYYY! today = national day celebration.. omg it was actually super fun! acjc is damn laidback in its events such as this.. the whole school was standing on chairs and singing! wow! even the band joined hands with the choir (literally) and for the first time in a long time.. i enjoyed national day celebration. the j2s have are soo damn nice.. they bought a super bigload of presents and gave them to the j1s.. a more expensive undertaking than vice versa because there are simply more j1s than j2s.. their effort deserves mention! presents ranged from the yummy variety to the not so yummy ( can cds be eaten?) type... but ANYway.. i want to say i will misssss them alot. not really till tears.. but just alot. the science especially.. because the arts i can, as i said many times before, just walk downstairs and see them. its sooo cool.. now i finally noe y i love the school.. its because arts is tighter and more cohesive a unit than any other.. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...... =)  watched farenehit 9/11 after that with (in order of merit)... me,me and me. the others (not in order of merit) include jian xiang, yoon hoe, jocelyn, angel, huiying, jonathan + y^2 thieng.! =) haha it was the most evvviieeelll show on earth.. making fun of poor old george bush.. what the hell.. reading 'my pet goat' while people were jumping off the wtc.. omg man such a cool dude. actually i love the movie cos it only shows 1 point really... there is no god. poor woman.. poor deluded woman. ah well.. i better not be too mean. heh.  Ok..... to sum it all up.. i think this is the funnest + funniest day in acjc.. i love band! (these chicks dont even know the name.. *faddeee OUTttt....*

      the past few days have been an influx and enjoyment of creativity for me. 1st there was night of laughter on friday, then acs(i) band concert on saturday.. they rocked! this makes me think of our own concert; acjc concert, wherein we played well.. but felt we did not do our best. zz.. dreary sad topic. a few mentions for drama night.. most notably tim w my classmate. while arguably that is how he sometimes behaves in class anyway.. he still managed not to have stage fright.. although i was guessing that that was what he was most scared of for the play. ingenuity from both cast and crew led to the use of lt2 as the stage a most well chosen spot. the teachers part in the night of laughter was commendable.. mostly due to the many many 'dirty' things they would not usually say practically overflowing that night. then came acs(i) band concert.. that was even better. i dont know how to spell my juniors or soon-to-be juniors names but to the whole trombone section.. woah u rocked! i definitely do not believe any further that acs(i) even need the smallest bit of help from acjc band. what with persis played with almost zero flaws &amp; no thow, i did not hear ur mute drop.. lol. disaster never really once struck their concert.. i have to say that despite all the obstacles that they had from what mr lee told us.. they managed to overcome them in a mere span of a week.. and that is truly the acsian spirit. man.. 2 nonsense crapolas in 2 simultaneous blogs.. omg i need to learn a better ending!
