       Casually toss small, random blunt objects such as pecans (no pralines), foreign coins, packets of honey (no jam), or ibuprofen gelcaps at diligent colleagues engrossed in projects positioned several cubicles away. Avoid staples, toothpicks, pushpins and freshly-sharpened pencils as they may draw blood, resulting in an unsanitary work environemnt. Chosen projectiles should weigh in at no more than 1.6-2.1 oz as soft-tissue bruising and possibly maiming may occur beyond this range, depending on distance from target, mass and trajectory of your airborn treasure. Underlings, interns, as well as peers having a limmitted grasp of english and/or passive/sickly nature are ideal prey (no superiors). Discreetly determine whether victim has any nut allergies if flinging pecans. Be inconspicuous, or not.  While the receptionist is on a cigarette break, abscond with the labelmaker in the top drawer of her desk (usually burried under a mound of unopened nicorrete)--hide your precious contraband under your jacket / cardigan : if anyone asks, tell them your cardiologist suggests you occasionally sport a portable-halter-ECG beneath clothing for the purpose of monitoring you premature ventricular contractrions of the heart. Now focus: channel your attention-defficit-disorder and its capacity to conjure and string together random, unrelated elements. Compose novel-borderline-inapproriate messages such as "Buy me a pony," "D.A.R.E. 2 Keep Kids off Dill," "Throw'n Chutney to the wind!," "Who's loin is it anyway?,"and "Property of Sylvia" (note: there must be no one named Sylvia within your department). Place the labels in obscure, off-the-beaten-path places that do, on occasion, recieve the gaze of human eyes: the butter-cubby in the fridge, the narrow space just below the latch on the door to the supply room, the underside of the tape dispenser, the computer screen of the primary investor's son. Literary brevity and a nack for fereting out ideal nooks 'n crannies are art forms--do not fret, mastery will come with time.  Hum and hold a single solitary tone. When the ears of the guy next to you begin to twitch (the guy baring an uncanny resemblence to a wolverine) or the very sweaty accounting man's comb-over rises like a curious periscope above the felt walls of his cubicle--follow suit by looking around the room, and in a very matter-of-fact-tone, state "Those old servers get louder by the day."  When the unnaturally thin and Moschino-clad lady to your left slips away for her 1:15 bathroom break (during which, much like the mighty owl, she ceremoniously regurgitates the contents temporarily stored within her stomach), replace her open diet pepsi with a can of "pepsi one." And when she returns, watch how she initially sips the soda unaware, then suddenly recoils in horror, having realized she has consumed a quarter-calorie of real sugar.  Appear to take both initiave and a ecological interest in the office ferns scattered above cubicles. Sprtiz them with the watering-spritzer-thing-bottle, allowing stray mist to repeatedly moisten the gallery of posti-its meticulously aligned and papering Anal Guy's file cabinet while he is in a meeting. Entertain yourself by watching him frantically re-post then scotch tape   throughout the day....  If you fear you are not capable of implementing these pastimes in the inconspicuous fashion required, that some of these musings may decrease your popularity, that a handful of these little escapades may cut your career short--never fear. Yes kids, there is the infamous and always pleasurable last resort. Two words: Telnet Tetris.

       They tell me the fun, games, and Gimlet-Induced hookups are coming to a close.  They tell me that today I must supplant devilishly shadey, loafing musicians with conservative, classy, oxford-clad bankers. They tell me random bedfellows must be traded in for a steady, stable, re-occurring bedmate. They tell me my early 20s prime is neither a time for sexual escapades nor a place for dabbling in capricious social scenes. They tell me my early 20s prime is a time for spousal appraisal and a place for presenting myself as desirable 'chattle.' They tell me its time to stop living for now, romping around, running amuck in the meat-packing district. They tell me its time to substitute the downtown midnight tequila shots for upper-eastside happy hour cosmos. They tell me its time to burn the halter and miniskirt, to invest in the A-line sheath and everything Ann Taylor. They tell me its about time.  And so you ask, who are "they," this anonymous third party, this preaching chorus, this chiding counsel, repleat with a cache of beseeching sermons and lectures.   "They" is a pastiche of people, places, and things: the idle chat of 30-somethings sipping iced lattes at a siewalk cafe, my more-anchored peers, the taglines to the left of Nicole Kidman's alibaster breast on the cover of the latest Cosmo-Glamour-Elle-WhatHaveYou, the wise elders serving as my surrogate NY parental figures, the voice in the head of every single professional female bitterly approaching her mid20s, my poised / less-impetuous (i.e. more sober) friends, my poised / less-impetuous / hypocrital (i.e. less sober) friends, the reproachful gaze of my mother that manages to channel its energy, digitize its essence, transport itself through satellites/towers/antennas to my samsung  to be decoded back into the nagging aura as I tell her about my weekend.   So yes, "they" is comprised by all of the above, yet mostly characterized by one final element, the mother of them all, of everything cellularly respiring and perspiring upon the earth, of everything begat by the amoeba and descending from the notorious homo-erectus: THE EVOLUTIONARY IMPULSE.  Let's go back.  Let's go back to the beginning, billions of years, to that infamous little pond paradigm of Darwin's dreams. Inside this small seething pool a slew of very gregarious atoms "hooked-up," got the party started, transforming the pool into a hot tub of social activty as molecules formed, joined, experimented with various partners, eventually forming the first proteins, the first being "urea." This era may be marked as the initial "sexual revolution," its founders being inorganic molecules rather than saturday-night-fever-reminiscent disco-rats. So anyway, the tub became known as primordial soup, a breading ground churning with rich organics, waste, filth, urea -- picture the suspicous, murky puddles beneath the tracks at the NQR 42nd Station. From this came the first DNA molecules, then the first unicellular critter, then a bunch of other stuff in the water, then some junk with leaves and other stuff bearing legs. Each step of this long semi-linear process involved both the innocent and not so innocent cavorting of creatures, galavanting about indescriminantly, spontaneously engaging in naughtiness. Somewhere in the recesses of these guys' wee-vacuous-nerveclusters (the precursor to the pea-sized brain) --the idea took root that one must be more fit and fertile than everyone else, frolic and fool around only with one's fit and fertile peers, then laugh at the weak and meak, kill the weak and meak, skin the weak and meak, braise and honey-glaze the weak and meak, eat the weak and meak with one's fit and fertile peers, begin again.   This is the general meta-narrative of evolution from which Darwin's principles were derived. Kind of. You get what I mean.  Where am I going with this?   At some point, these creatures decided that permiscuity was only exciting and acceptable for a while, and that they should throw "choosing a life-partner" in the mix of things to do between nibblings upon the "weak and meak" and wearing the "weak and meak" to ceremonial feasts celebrating their own "fit and fertile" fabulousness.  The next addendum was the necessity to persuade whilst looking down upon others who were not prescribing to this impulse.   Now you ask, "Why add the courtship and union? Things seemed to be going so well, everyone enjoyed the naughtiness, hankypanky, frisk and frolic sexual buffet...."   "Why!?"-you ask.   Then you say "Why did they do this? Why am I so overwhelmed by the innerturmoil they ingrained in every fiber of my being--the desire to court and mate versus the desire to be a raging whore? Why did they give rise to me only to endow me with this approaching-24-war between the inner misfit and inner future Mrs.? Who will win? "  you sigh.   "WHY GODAMNIT!!!!!"  your voice is full of rage, a capillarly bursts above your left eyeborw. I am terrified and fear you may direct this energy onto my easily-bruised person. I am nearly in the fetal position.  "why...."  you are suddenly solemn and tender. I think you are bipolar.  Perhaps it was a need for some sense of stability in a highly volcanic and tempermental planet--with all the earthquakes, meteors, floods, ice, dinosaurs, REALLY big birds with HUGE teeth. Perhaps the female thought it was a novel idea to secure a protector at her immediate disposal for the rest of her very fit and fertile life--remember the big evil carnivorous birds.  Sadly, No one knows "exactly". And no one gets it. Not even the creatures (afterall, their brains were not nearly as developed as ours, not even as developed as George W.'s) And most regrettably, their little constitution became ingrained in the very DNA molecules that started this whole mess. It is this 'little constitution' we are under the spell of, have coined as the "Evolutionary Impulse" or also the "Evolutionary Drive"--the inexplicable compulsive desire to wear leser species as coats and shoes, eat beef, mate, castegate others who choose to engage in the naughty behavior harking back to the days of yore, the days of urea, of random bedfellows, of noncommittal interactions, of skinnydipping in the primordial hot tub...   So.... If I had to select one thing to bear the title of the ultimate menace, the fiendish "They" -- the winner would be Evolution and its goddam impuls. And to Evolution and company, to them, ALL the "they"s, I say this and this alone:   "Fuck-off... Please" *  * My southern-bred goodnature, or rather, the lingering vestiges of its passive/ polite feminimity that a year of aggressive  manhattan-education hasn't been able to erase---where was I--oh yes, my southern-bred goodnature forces me to be courteous and slightly recoil when asserting myself and/or swearing, thus I must always at the "please" when rebuffing others.

       Once upon a Seico, when Swatches outsold Swiss, And actors read their lines from Pennsylvania Avenue, Farrah Bighare, a "working girl,"  whilst straddling the sran-wrap ceiling (among other things)— gazed from her compact-corner cubicle at the architecturely-ambitious window, a 7-foot naval centered in the Aquamarine wall. Her swollen eyes swallowed the glass bricks— glistening like hot fat— which took on the appearance of some semi-precious jewel, lodged in the great-Budha belly of the 7th floor. And fair-Farrah, typer of memos, thought to her bleached and blue-lid-shadowed self 	Would that I had a child as sleek 	as transparent stones, as well-rounded 	as this window, with irise as turquoise  	as these sea-green walls. And so Farrah—perhaps cued by the innate, maternal drive that survived a decade of bra-burning— set out and set forth (Aqua-net and all) for the local Sperm Banc. She picked and chose, they cut and pasted a gene or two, Hence, through the miracle of Eugenics, Eight months and a fortnight later, a test-tube toddler exploded from her plastic Petrie-Dish womb. And this daughter, this child was 	as sleek as transparent stones, 	as well rounded as that window, 	with irises as turquoise as those sea-green walls. But whomever, or whatever, Farrah had engineered  in one, forty-seven minute consultation, this child was so much more—as chronciled by the lens-higging, bile loving, super-market smut, check-out-line journals. So read one time-passing, trash-talk paper: 	Bighare's Dailyware Spawns 100lb. Jaundiced Tyke 	With Overeactive Sweat Glands And so she—the obese, orbicular, greasy, garish, recombinant-DNA disaster, was named, Oily Ivory.  By the time the nation's non-live stocks had retreated into the black ooze of October hibernation, while puppet-portfolios and wallstreet-suits sat slumped in a cesspool of commodities and repossessed Delorians— By this year, ending in a secen, Oily Ivory was ripe and aged enough to microwave mass-produced, mini-cholesterol snacks--jimmy deans, taquitos, pork and beans. And it came to pass, the prophecy of Lucy Shenowitz, founder of 1-800-ESP-WWJD, was fulfilled.... Whiel rallyinf for company child-care, mounted on a modern soap-box, a plastic Made-in-Tiajuana chair, Fair Farrah—fell dead. Her Enzo-Valetto Stilleto yielded, gave way— the 5'7" fram plummettingin a cyclone of shoulder pads and button covers, impailing herself on the spear-head tip of a no. 2, the fatal pin-size puncture smelling of fresh graphite.  As for Oily Ivory, she found fostercare  on  the talk-show circuit--making her way through radio waves  into living rooms, bus terminals, bars across America. Ratings rose; Publicity popularized the poor piteous orphan-- good-Christians with well-stocked pantries clamored at the chance to parade their piety. to swaddle the kid in self-rewarding kindness, to  testitify to the tenet  	Love is blind And hence, hammered by Oily Ivory's high-demand  for Spaghetti O's, eagerly shifted the burdern to a home that appeared appopriate-- that of Hubert and Hormona RhinoRider, a cicus family (masking alterior motives) from One of the Dakota's, a place called Pierre.  Ringmaster RhinoRider--expectorated burp of a man-- was descended from White Castle Royalty: A father fry cook with a dapper disposition and 7-stranded ring of hair around the head; A mother burger-bagging broad with two tender-   fleshy, knockworst arms--dimpled tubing  filled with the Crisco-like lard  delivered Tuesdays' at 7am. They were an attractive trio. All was well in the cholesterol kingdom,  until a traveling fair stumbled upon this no-paper, one-horse town. The seductive magic of fire-eating, painted people, The patchwork, primary-colored, conical sanctuary l ured young Hubert RhinoRider away from the Formica counter-tops, the wood-wall-paper,  the government byproducts of that franchise palace, eyes fixed on a fantasy of the Vegas stage-- chorus lines, burlesque, musical numbers: Big-Top Circus was his ticket out of town. After years of blowing balloon-link puppies, 	 pandas,  and polar bears-- RhinoRider was issued a hat, a whip, and a title: Ringmaster. 27 years later, he purchases an orphan,  picks her up at the county court-house,  his hand mechanically signs documents,  while his mind still dreams of being  Fred Astaire. He turns to the side, mid-signature, and admires  his Hitchcock-like shadow, gluttonous and  bloated against the beige wall of the asbestos-bearing office; He glances over at his own grotesque, starlet wife--Hormona-- and worries that her famous facial-forrest is growing thin.  He's looking at my beard again, there's fear in his eyes. And with that she hides her chin in shame throught the long car ride home;  She conceals herself as they emerge from their Gremlin at the trailer park.  Copper dust descends upon the legally-bound three,  the night air chills steal-stream-lined rusted promises, abandoned in the great  Dakota hospice-- made to fly those aerodynamic-reflective toaster-jets with wheels, And weren't  we supposed to be their rocketteers? Nothing ever got off the ground, But rather, simply settled in to the hypnotic inertia  of white lines on black-tarred stretches of assphault,  of pointed tarps, popcorn, crusted-cotton candy, cold  corn dogs, mad laughter, shrill cries, rickety roller-coasters, polk-a-dots, pinwheels, stripes, bells,  buzzers, roars, fire-- And damnit what happened to my spotlight? Wearing thin, town after town, circumnavigating the Midwest,  numbers falling, applause peetering, admit ones to two for ones; The Ferris wheel froze, was left along the road to another town that wasn't Vegas; Kids just kick the clowns,  the freak shows aren't PC enough for Patchican, Missouri......  And that's why Hormona hated Oily Ivory. A new generation, a new attraction, a final prayer for Hubert  and the Big-Top Circus. The old-sparsely-spikenever-has-been, now insecure,  would soon be obsolete. She leads the child to her cubicle above the fold-out dining area, then waddles away with the rectangular-reared  attutyted of middle-aged women  who never got over the cancellation of Dynasty, the death of JR. To the looking-glass she runs, in desperate want of reaffirmation: 	Looking glass, looking glass, on the wall, 	Who's the most nauseating of us all? And the looking-glass responded: Thou art more startling than all who are over forty,  O Be-whiskered Primadonna. But more sickenening still is Oily Ivory. The circus was not hers anymore. Venom, abhorrence metastisized through her chest and limbs-- a wild, proliferating cancer--- consuming Hormona, displacing her hunger  for HoHos with an appetite for destruction.  Little Piñata, a rounded Donkey--Oily Ivory--t wisted stealthily through the dark canopied-sky (the trapeez was her forté); Hormona watched, terminally ill with envy,  and called upon the Candy Man, requesting with the aggressive subtley of wildebeasts: End her and that blithe mix of innocence and cellulite. Bring me back her innards, spun into  crystallized threads around an ivory tusk. And so the Candy Man seduced Oily Ivory with raisins and fudge;  he felt the steel Cutco knife burn through his back pocket, singing, branding his ass with guilt and angst: So moved by the popinjay-pirouttes, the ingenuous Oily Ivory dancing about, in a blur of biker shorts and spandex. Lead alloy in his heart--he spake-- 	Child, Willy Wonka awaits you in the woods, 	Scurry away, find your happiness in taffy and cream, Vow never to retuurn to this cursed-tent, no matter how 'gingerbread-and-apple-cide'r your mothe-queen  	may make it seem. And with that, the great-billowing being  bobbled away, like a reboudning balloon of Jell-O, towards the black forrest that pledged dark chocolate, lemon drops, and Maple-Caramel Dream. 	The Candy Man, wise in the ways of guile, concealed his mercy behind the glistening chords of sacrificial-Cheetah wound around a ceramic tusk  (Big-Tops store of ivory was sold years-ago  for a snow-cone maker and a rotissery  oven). Hormona--the queen in stone-washed blue-jeans-- ravenously ate the delicacy, licking, smacking her fingers in time to the beat of nearby drums.  Lost-traveling land-mass, Oily Ivory, wandered amongst the trees, alone, buldozing through brush in search of Umpa Lumpas, and the Cadbury Bunny. At long last, 'desperate-dumpling' stumbled into the twisted lichen-laden lawn furniture in front a pre-fabricated manufactured cottage. She swung open the swinging screen door (which screamed and winced like sick gerbils). A piping-hot wave of Cream of Wheat and Tang  blasted her chapped cheeks and the raw-place beneath her nose; She rushed with waurterback grace-- falling, flailing like a wounded moth--headfirst towards the fine  250-thread count Linens lining the a small cot, its iron-framework becking and bowing under the  pressure of the perpetual Rose-Bowl float.  As old-fallout suspended in the atmosphere dimmed into a warm-orange glow, cradling the  orb sinking into the landfills lining the horizon of Upper Limboville, The cottage-dwellers—a heathenly band of Seven limber, growth-stunted Rumanian contortionsists— returned home from an arduous day in Markesite City, Seven miles down the red-dust road,  a mining town located in the Ellafea Valley. To their bemusement, they found the snoring child  slumbering away between Hamstring's sheets. Fearing the response of a suddenly-aroused mammoth, The Seventh contortionist moved from bed to bed through out  the long, listless night, spending seven minutes and seven seconds with each companion per cycle.  As dawn rolled back the midnight curtain of Iodine isotopes— Oily Ivory pleasently awoke to the all to familiar aroma of apple  fritters and bear claws, And over 7 cups of coffee and 77 donut holes, the Seven plus One formed a sort of unspoken, altruistic, consortium of comradeship. Where Oily Ivory took up the traditional domestic duties: 	cleaining wall paperwith a slice of toast, fluffing beches, 	sitting for (sometimes on) the pet poodles, 	classifying mold spores, filing affadavits, 	reharging batteries, tarring the roof, 	boiling buttons. And in return, the Seven Contortionists paid for her bread, and water, and non-perishables (mostley dehydrogenated, homogenated, ionized,  iodized food stuffs in colorful cans). The world was Perfect— except for the East Austrian Beet Famine, Locusts, Dysentery,  and the preponderance of Three's Company re-runs.  But the Contortionists, having learned the story of Oily Ivory, new the ways of bitter-never-has-beens, whose twisted souls  compensated for their inagile torsos, talentless-hack-like nature. So they warned their Sugar Plumb of the evil  looming, the incubus yet to come: 	Beware of strangers, don't answer the door; 	A smile hides diablerie, a  gift delivers calamity. 	Don't trust the venders that come and pass: 	Don't purchase tupperware, facial cleanser, 	or blown glass,  That noon, while cradling a calico cat, Hormona, struck dumb by vanity, panicked and implored (once again) to her fiber-optic wonder-mirror hanging left of Hubert's lava lamp: 	Looking glass, looking glass, on the wall, 	who's the most nauseating of us all? Acutely aware of nearby blunt objects, Hormona's temper,  and the fragile nature of glass. The reflecting mirror gingerly returned: 	O She-Beast, thou art the most grotesque among those receiving  	Senior discounts at movies and Pciadillies, 	But nestled in the valley trapping the emotional exhaust of Flemish refugees, 	There is but one robbing you of precious infamy, 	And that my dear, 	is, 	Precocious, 	Oily Ivory. So the star-climbing, moaning whilst whining,, bone-kicking broad, stuffed her shapeless-flesh filled-sack self in the Avon-lady outfit of her early youth, and set out to reclaim circus-Doll Dignity with pretty bottles of dangerous-chemical cancactions (she was, no joke, the daughter of a a pharmacist)  deceptively laced in rose-colored creams.  The Pink caddy hunted the hussy, Oily Ivory, and finally belched to a halt at the cottage's chain-linked gate, and Hormona slitheredout from vermecian vynl, herself masked by the wonders of wigs, opress on nails, and Cover Girl. And Oily Ivory, mistaking the Caddy's squeak  for the Good Humor Man, moiled with all her might to the curb praying the pepto-colored-lady would bare a Posicle. Says Hormona: 	Avon at your Service, miss,.  Calling from door 	to door.  Greasy pores poor-child?  Try new 'Shallow Grave' dehydrating foam. The words of the contortionists were lost to the child: 	Free samples, ma'am?  Oh pretty-please? So the mysterious  Mistress of Avon salivated with gluttonous joy as the thick-little-fingers spread generous dollops of butter-like potion upon her cupcake face. And soon, to Hormona's delight, the icing began to burn, to sting, to boil and seethe as desperate Oily Ivory rubbed and scrubbed the hot-froth, licked the oozing  woundsas if they were pudding pops . Smearing, dripping, seeping— the opening colcanic pores now geyser-like and gushing, rushing to replenish the empty basin of Ellafea Valley with a thick-gelatinous, salmon-tinged fluid  Dust bowl to puddle turned pond turned lake,  filled with the Blob's visvous, less attractive cousin.  The pink caddy flees recklessly, chased by waves  of roseate muck speedily engulfing first the trunk, the roof, then hood, filling the vehicle, swallowing Hormona, meeting her end in a sea of  liquid Bubble Gum. The hood ornmant is spared, allowed to breathe,  peeks out from the the ooze— serving as a memorial, a lesson, a reminder to the skittish school children that would visit (in centuries to  come) the Ellafea Tarpits:   Beware of strangers, don't answer the door; 	A smile hides diablerie, a  gift delivers calamity. 	Don't trust the venders that come and pass: 	Don't purchase tupperware, facial cleanser, or blown glass.  And so the those Grim Brother  were all a crock. (of what, I am not sure:  butter, cheese, chicken stock?) It took once (not twice, as they claim in their candy-coated version) 	to outwit a bulb, barely, dimly-lit. And Ferdinand Marcos does not belong in fairy tales, and neither do  	pretty glass coffins displaying everything that could  	never be Snowy or White. Seven anythings are never adequate. Princes can be detained, nonexistant, thrown off-course, or lead astray— some even turn out to swing the other way (see Cinderella). So what if they all just lived deglamorized, then faded into non-nothingness— as all things plot, 	plan, 		tend to do.

       9:14pm: Spine arching a-la-Quasimodo proportions under the burden of 30 pounds of vinyl-swaddled powerbook and a canvas tote overflowing with freshly damp gym clothes, I'm slumping on the corner of 5th and 14th, mouth greeting the oxymoronic post-work-out Camel Red Lite, nostrils trying to seperate the scent of smoldering-cancer-plants and the aroma of aloe bodywash stil saturating my skin due to NYCitySportsClub's lack of adequate waterpressure. My eyes are fixated on the red-hand across the intersection, waiting for the little man to abruptly replace it. There are no cars, save the occasional fleet of taxis, a benz, and a token el camino--meaning (in manhattan terms) "there is, like, no traffic." Behind the little red hand is the Barnes and Nobles of Asian deli's, unabashadly smirking down upon its mom and pop counterparts from its Ikea-meets-Korea architecture. Inside, steam rises from the stylish aluminum, very-Crate-N-Barrel vats, spotlit by the above halogen lighting, showcasing the luminescent tempered-glass countertopss, serving as a stage for the aging, solidified buffet, a pastiche of the afternoon's remains--dehydrated dumplings, wilted ceaser, spicy kimchi.....   I am thinking kimchi is very spicy.....   My gaze returns to the deli's exterior. This cylindrical shell, standing 100 feet high, masking 1/3 of a circa 1910 brownstone--resembles a hurican lamp, lit from the inside out. I free associate back to the beaded hurrican lamp I bought pre-college at Costco whilst chilling on a vicadin buzz, 1.5 hours post wisdom-teeth removal....  I am thinking vicadin is very good.....  My tongue explores the fleshy craters which once housed the teeth considered to be the bastard children of molars. I wonder where they are now? Where have my elephant-size molars run off to, what has become of them since being ripped from safety of my healthy gums. Are you lost in some biohazard landfill in New Jersey, roaming the waste, fighting other dental refuse for a chance at a freshly discarded tube of flouride?   I am thinking how bad flouride tastes......  While pondering my dental history, I become aware once again of the deli. I need to floss. Perhaps they sell floss--the waxy mint kind, none of that bubble-gum string shit. I am touched by how darling the littlw-walking-man-icon on the street sign appears with my Ikea-Korea in the background, then saddened by his dissappearance and the reammergence of the hostile red hand, then pissed off as I realize I missed the light....  I am thinking how I should have taken my attention deficit medication  this morning.....

       Pondering prompted by my recent irritation with the elitism of  dead poets and many intoxicated  manhattan men I’ve met in various upscale bars  ~~~~~ "This is the sorrowful state of those unsure, whose lives earned neither honor nor bad fame.  And they are mingled with Angles of that base sort who, neither rebellious to God nor faithful to Him, chose neither side... Now heaven expels them...And Hell rejects them...They have no hope of death, but a blind life so abject, they envy any other fate...To all memory of them, the world is deaf. " –Dante's Divine Comedy, the Inferno ~~~~~  Those "they" who lead these lives of quiet desperation, who settled for the hypnotic simplicity of moving meanly like ants, find themselves stepped over and stepped on by centuries of overachievers, self-righteous, self-professed prophets.  And why, Mr. Dante, and for that matter—Misters Thoreau and Emerson—do we condemn the masses of misanthropic men who fuel your fame and serve as History's gauge to the degree of your Glory?  I’m not saying you aren’t (weren’t, rather) “good people,” in fact you are fine men and brilliant philosophers—yet your attitude towards “Joe BlueCollar”, “Samantha Secretary”, and a plethora of others going through the motions of repetitive non-intelectually engaging labor, earning an income level barely touching upon the taxable bracket – towards these unassuming “folks” your attitude simply sucks, is condescending, derogatory, and altogether shitty. Think of this sea of angst ridden, nare-do-wells, helpless to the sentence of their creation that molded them some potpourri of pedestrian, cowardly, or complacent clay. One would expect you—Dante, look at me—one would expect you to install some sort of resonanating sympathetic chord in first-person Inferno narrator-friend who, only moments before, had fallen short of himself, gripped by Weakness and swallowed by Fear.  Few are blessed with the poet Virgil as a personal, portable pep rally and guidance counselor, and those who aren't—the hapless and half-dead—are transferred to the City of Woes by a vengeful God, a god who conveniently forgets the fact that the mediocrity and indifference he disdains is a magnified pore on the face of his own image.  Too good for hell, too dull for Heaven.  I suggest Dante and his God purchase a Revlon* magnifying, illuminated vanity mirror—prehaps the suddenly visible cratered mindfield of blackheads willm humble them. (*Revlon Vanity Mirror: $35.95, Duane Reade)……….. ~ She sits, on a stool, somewhat stuck in 1989 with her tapered stonewashed digs, sedate behind a carnival-like snack cart at the train station in Trenton.  Hundreds pass her each day; a couple purchase a bag of sodium-saturated honey-roasted peanuts, stale popcorn, petrified-yogurt-coated pretzels.  No one seems to notice the cloth veil falling behind her ebony bangs, placed there for perhaps religious or freshly-Salon-styled-protective purposes.  A suit approaches her, pointing at a colony of what resembles molars coated in molasses. She lethargically stretches out her long-latte-hued arm, reaching for a pair of plastic tongs. The suit, preoccupied with perhaps the current predicament of pork bellies, directs his gaze towards his watch, then his tie (his wife would kill him if she knew he was poisoning his arteries with an indiscernible, syrupy precipitate).  Mechanically she moves and scoops and breaks a part a conglomerate of stale-sticky caramel corn.  There could be a kid at home, a husband who's sick of TV dinners, a mutt, a bed without a head board, a cupboard crowded with Pez dispensers.  The suit rushes away with his change and a little brown bag of hard, day-old, bacteria coated saturated fat. She holds down three jobs, he holds a a cup of coffee. She’s quiet now, tired, content, worried? Quiet now, yes, but Dante says she'll wail in the afterworld awaiting the plebeian, and no one—neither God nor a poet nor a Suit—seems to care, to mind.  The elite who indirectly write of her doom, concoct her condemnation, spread their liturgy to the masses—they are apathetic to her two jobs a day, her dwindling back account, her sick father…. Dante and Co. facilitate the design of class system of cruelty and judgement, but remain indifferent, unmoved, numb and neutral towards those whom they afflict…….. ~ And speaking of neutrality, let's give it up for Switzerland. Stable borders, frosted peaks, and a system of well-maintained bike trails seem like a nice place to camp out...  But in Dante’s world, Switzerland’s status-quo, non-imperialistc, failure to overachieve and passive policies relegates them to certain calamity….. Snow-capped mountains melt under the wrath of Fire, churning windmill spokes are frozen by the ire of Ice.  Zurich cries, and the imperialistic world looks the other way. Dante tells me one day Switzerland will get its ass kicked…....... ~	 As for palm trees, who can blame them for bending, beckoning, tumbling under the weight of genetically imposed impotence?  Such trunks lack sturdy roots and the capability to grow the  successive rings required for achieving monstrous proportions—like  the rainforest giants that hide the light from hungry saplings, like Yosemite's petrified redwoods that finance California.  Fettered to this Monocotic nether-life, palm trees have neither the power to do exceptional good (providing nothing save a bit of slim shade) nor the power to do evil (other than causing minor concussions from wind-induced coconut-fallout). If he had a choice between only a banal and decent life or a titillatingly wicked existence, which would he choose? Ask the solitary, sad, lonesome, anarexic trunk which is worse: an unexciting life and tortured afterlife, or fiendishly exhilarating menacing existence followed by Malebolge—the 8th circle of Hell.  Ten times out of ten, the border town along the River Acheron—the City of Woes—wins….. In Dante’s inferno, an simpleton’s life is ‘rewarded’ with hellish limbo,: at least the ornery are lauded with the bounty of their ill-doings on earth, memories that will keep them buoyant as the flames of hell lick their feet….   ~ "Shoot for the moon.  Don't ever let yourself fall into that Mediocre category," once preached my orthodontist nearly a decade ago, with an air of contention and arrogance, unaware of the hypocrisy of his words: moments before he had told the crater-faced kid  beside me that his "bite wasn't perfect, but it'll do."  Looking up at the blinding light and magnifying spectacles, feeling the pressure of a cold metal probe, tasting something metallic (like copper pennies-- probably blood)—I agreed and I disagreed.  What kind of gauge is he—certainly nothing devised by Keppler or Farenheit—to measure the degree of a man’s success?  To “Joe Blue-Collar” , his popsicle stick fortress is the Hearst Castle. And what of those who aimed high but fired low by the misfortune of circumstance, limited means, or a sense of responsibility to a force greater than himself—family, God, or country?  The "anointed ones" forsake their blue-collar fathers, abandon their martyred mothers who struggled to  lift them up to sit among the chosen. Dante searches for a truth skewed by his egocentric take on the world. If Dante sought virtue instead, he would eventually emerge from the pit of self-absorption and learn to redefine existence and post-existence by reading people on their own terms, or at least by giving medals just for trying to hit the cosmos.   ~ And so Dante turns his eyes back into himself, running away from the City of Woes, leaving those there to wallow in an unjust comparison. He ploughs forward n search of the path of pre-fabricated truth, the egomaniacal strength to face the she-wolf of Sin.  But maybe (just maybe) after bathing in the chastity of the stars, Dante will consider Santana's idea that forgetting obscures the way, and that the best means of staying on track is remembering and thanking those who pointed in the direction of the road, supported him in the shadows: the vender who fed him Cracker Jacks when his blood sugar was low, the country that produced his 10-speed, the tree that attempted to shield him from the sun. When Dante re-evaluates his inferno, the old orthodontist will realize that there is no true universal measurement-conversion chart, and that the overbites and out-of-joint jaws of the so-called mediocre put his kids through school and a new coffee table in the waiting room, among other things. ~~~~~~~~~~  Did this all make sense. I don’t know. Somehow it did to me, kind of.
