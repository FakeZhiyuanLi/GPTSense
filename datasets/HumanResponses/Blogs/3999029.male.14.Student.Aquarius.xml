           I have recently noticed that some of ppl have displayed an attitude tat I dislike very much. If you still continue with this kind of stuff, I shall not tolerate this carp. Don't ever mess with me or I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget. Stop this nonsense and don show me your fucking attitude. If you aren't satisfied with me, then tell me straight in the face, don be a coward and talk behind my back. Fooling around with me will not do you any good, it will only cause retributions.        If you ignore me and try pushing blames to me, or keeping back things that I am supposed to noe, u stand nothing to gain. It will only lead to your downfall. Do not assume that I am ignorant to things that are happening around me. I have every move to outwit you. Stop showing that attitude of ignoring me or trying to mess around with me, lest I blow up and start doing nasty things to you. Let this serve as a warning to those who plan to fool around with me.       I was feeling quite happy today when an incident sparked off me wanting to write this entry. The person who angered me happened to be one of those that I have placed great trust in. Another person from air rifle also tried to anger and incite me. I have already tolerated this person for a long time. This time he has really made me go mad. If he continues this kind of bahaviour, I may slaughter him with choppers and feed him to the pigs. So if this person is reading this entry, be warned. I am all out to kill you.       Such a joyous day spoilt with all these sudden happenings around me, I'm damn frustrated. I hope this will not happen again.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I am in the&nbsp;sch tech lab slaking again. I pon my EP3 again so as not to see Bastard Zhang.&nbsp;I shall&nbsp;try to be not too harsh to Zhang in this entry.   Many ppl ask me  y I hate Bastard Zhang so much, well, I'll try to answer these questions and more in the entry.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coach Zhang, 2 very important reasons: Firstly, I don buy much things from her. Tat means that she doesn't coach me as often as the others. That's mistake number one. She should not be so biased to those who don buy a lot of stuff from her.&nbsp;She should treat all the shooters equally since the school paid her to coach us. It is not right to prefer those better ones and develop a liking for them. Secondly, she loves picking on me and always says tat I don train very often and would totally ignore me in training. That's mistake&nbsp;number two. I don intend to be in the national team and thus she should force me to. I also have my rights too.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not going to grow up and be a professional shooter.&nbsp;Schoolwork is still my priority. I&nbsp;feel that I should&nbsp;only&nbsp;really&nbsp;devote myself to trainings in the competition period.&nbsp;Since Zhang   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jahu, one very important reason: he has serious attitude problems&nbsp;and loves bootlicking, which I dislike very much, and is also the main reason why I hate him so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;These type of ppl are really fuckers and&nbsp;should be ashamed of themselves. Jahu is so thick headed and seeing&nbsp;him makes me feel wanna blow up. I especially hate his face&nbsp;and the way he talks shows that he is a mother fucker who ought to be slapped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fight(guess wat it is abt): After struggling in the choas of the fight for nearly one and half years, I finally made some progress. However, ever since the accomplishment, more stress have been pushing on me and I am choking.&nbsp; I will give up this fight at the end of the year and start something new. It is killing me and I can't cope with it. That should end my entry for today. I am down with depression again. I need&nbsp;a long rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      It was the national Track and Field finals today. As expected, both our C and B teams won the championships. Almost everyone was drenched in the rain and ended up being smelly like shit. Wah lao Singapore Sports School is damn qiang in sprinting and long distance. Fuck them loh, they should go home and fuck themselves. Seeing them makes me sick. Anyway, I feel that the school should at least provide one-way transport to the national stadium for the whole school, not only for the Secondary Ones. Its so unfair to makes the rest go there by themselves.   Oh coach Zhang, when the hell will you die, I hope I can live longer than you. Maybe someone will come and slash you with a meat hook and pull your intestines out and choke you to death with it. Then we take a rifle and use you as a 'live' shooting target until you are shot to pieces by the pellets. Then we can feed the rotten meat to the stray dogs and cats, proving you as the lowest of the filthy animals in the caste system.   Sometimes we can lure you into a dark room where we will pour mercury into your head. We will happily sit there and watch your brain slowly dissolve. Then Zhang the fucking moron will be wrapped into a fishing net and we will slice the skin in all the inter-sections of the net. After that, we will cook the sliced-off meat pieces and feed them to pigs and use them as offerings. The remaining body will be used as slicing targets for ppl to destress themselves. We may even burn the internal organs, and try cutting her eyes out.  In conclusion, coach Zhang is just a piece of a shit and the mother-fucking bitch will surely be slaughtered and mauled by vicious animals. We all look foward to Zhang's death and will cheer our hearts out when she dies. Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang, Fuck Zhang!!!!!

           If u want to noe who Old Jahu is, come look for me.       Bastard Zhang: This mother-fucking bitch can definitely ruin your day. She is well known for being a propaganda machine and greed for money. To find out more abt this slut, read my first entry of the Zhang Diary.       Old Jahu: Definitely a boot licker in LKY and my opinion. He loves to talk with teachers and would always talk a lot of good about them. He also enjoys talking cock with them and loves telling with the teachers his stories which are so damn fucking lame shit. Even some of the teachers are now biased towards old Jahu. This fucking moron has a fucked up face and looks like a piece of a shit. God will never forgive him for all the sins he committed and he will soon receive his retribution. I would prefer not to teach him a lesson and let god take care of him.       Old Jahu also has a fucking attitude in which I dislike very much. He sometimes likes to talk bad abt Bo Xian and despises him. I will now blast fucking Jahu: you ji bai mother-fucking asshole son of a bitch. Old Jahu u suck big time. U suck like hell.       Next, I’ll inform you abt the caste system in my class which created purely for entertainment for my friends and has now become as if it is real. I apologize to all those who were insulted by the “system”. The caste system is divided into 7 grps. They are ranked form the highest to the lowest: Master, Head of Peasants, Peasants, Slave, Negroes, Niger and filthy animal. I’m definitely one of the masters. Thingy is the Head of Peasants. Many ppl go under peasants. Ppl Jia Wei or I dislike go under Niger and below. Once again, I hope to clarify that the caste system is purely for entertainment and not to insult anyone.       Well, that ends off this entry. Sadist stories are coming soon abt bastard Zhang.

           Sorry for being so rude to Bastard Zhang in my last entry. I tink I've gone a little overboard. Anyway, after reading the bible, it has somewhat changed my hate towards Zhang. We should learn to be forgiving even if someone angers us very much. Here are some nice quotes form the bible:       Matthew 5:39 But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.       Matthew 5:44 But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.       Nevertheless, I shall never forgive Zhang. She has commited so many sins and should be banished to hell when she dies. I really hope that she would change her personality of being so money-minded and bitchy. God bless Zhang and not treat her too harshly. A little retribution for her should be alright. As for Zhang herself, she should turn iver a new leaf.        Sigh, I still have to do my MRP. I have exceeded the submission deadline by almost a week. Both Kenneth and I are so busy preparing for our Nationals that we have no time to complete it. Think I'll ask Ms Hoa to extend the deadline for us. Then I still have to pia the ACE stuff. So far, I despeartely need ACE for: English, Maths and Com Studies. Then there is also stress form Air Rifle. My parents refuse to invest in it and thus I have lack of money to buy good equipment. It makes me feel stressed seeing everyone has all of them. Then Coach Zhang comes to talk abt going into the National Team which will require more money. I've made a great mistake in joining this EP3. Great mistake.       Lastly, I shall end this entry with a few comments on Coach Zhang.       1. Coach Zhang has the IQ of an extremely rotten tree stump and less general knowledge than a very small lump of mud, so you could feed her all sorts of superstitious claptrap and codswallop and the pathetic sadwit would believe every word of it.       2. Coach Zhang is a vermin-ridden politically ambiguous bombastic vomitrocious motherfucking bimbo.       3. Coach Zhang is a turd-like anarchistic four-eyed puke-inducing smelly-crotched bitchwad.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:25pm, I am in the school tech lab wrting this stpid entry. I have juz escaped from EP3 and is happily slacking. While the sec 1s are training, I am sittting here feeling all relaxed. Everyone&nbsp;in the tech lab are "piaing" their project's final web report. LKY is doing their self-evaluation. Rui An says that it must come from the hearts. LKY is groaning about writing his evaluation. I am here slacking, hahaha.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lots&nbsp;of sec 1s here are playing games. LKY wants to go to bonus.com to play&nbsp;ski. Ever since after the Air Rifle inter-school final, I feel that I needed a long rest after such long periods of&nbsp;hectic training.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back&nbsp;to the tech lab, Altron is busy doing&nbsp;his group's web report. I am still here slacking, tink I'll go back to the range half an hour later. Repeat, re-enforce and reflect. That&nbsp;is what&nbsp;the Dyslexics preject is about. I also joined them in their DAS maths training programme in order&nbsp;to get maths ACE and CIP points.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my first entry. I shall be commenting on Coach Zhang Shao Ying who is also my air rifle coach. I think that she is a cheap bastard and has a greed for money. She is exploitative and loves scolding people. Whenever we ask her for the price of something, she would mention about buying it in bulk and say that it would be cheaper. When you are quietly training, she would suddenly pop out of the blue and ask you to buy some air rifle product. She also has this private training programme in which it would cost you&nbsp;$180 a month for&nbsp;some&nbsp;stupid&nbsp;old coach called lu coach to teach you in private. Then she would say that&nbsp;you have to go for that for a year and you are not allowed to stop halfway as that would mean that she would totally ignore you for a very long time cos she can't get money&nbsp;from you anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang loves money so much that she would totally devote herself to&nbsp;you if you are willing to give her one million bucks.&nbsp;She only teaches those who&nbsp;buys a lot&nbsp;things from her. If you buy very little stuff from her or seldom go&nbsp;for her training in which she will spread her propaganda, then she would not be willing to teach&nbsp;you, unless there are teachers around to look on her. She likes rich people and would always seem to be with them.&nbsp;Zhang has bad temper and loves scolding people whenever she feels like it. &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus&nbsp;in conclusion, Coach Zhang is a bitch&nbsp;and motherfucker&nbsp;whom we all should seek&nbsp;to slaughter. Fuck Coach Zhang!!!!!!!  &nbsp;

      Yeah! the term 3 exams are finally over, i'm so happy! We had maths and science tests today and even though the maths paper was tough, i am still keeping my fingers crossed for an A1. Science, I am hopeful of an expected result. Hope to get exempted from maths, science and com studies. For, now, I'll indulge myself in games.  Watched Lord Of The Rings 3 at home, the ending is too laggy and long, but I still enjoyed the show. Sigh, there is still the PCME test tm, I don give a damn abt it. I'll juz read through it quickly and then its done.   Got grp of china ppl came to visit our class today during eng lesson. All of them are girls. We were split into grps of 7 and then "interacted" with the students. Damn bitches and wenches are they and I am damn sad. Fuck all of them and they are so feh and lame shit. My grp only one girl out of two was talking to weiseng the gay. Now he is bi-sexual. LOL. Fuck the bitches for saying I am shy cos that's the word I hate most, especially if said from my neighbour's children as they are also damn bitches. FUX.  Recently, I've also noticed that the AR vice captain is showing some power. During the barbecue, he sort of acted 'power' and showed off how good he is at the barbecue by helping the others to cook the food. Damn motherfucker he is and son of a bitch. Asshole boy gets nowhere if he fools around with me. Go home and fuck yourself for that fucking attitude. Damn bitch ji bai lan jiao.  Can't get enough of me isst, you mother fucking son of a bitch farmer’s ass hoe. You are merely showing off how a gd leader and speaker you are rite, alright, go and stick you ass in shit and get yourself a good fucking. Kit Kit Kit, can't get enough of you, I've just exploded and you mother fucker will not be forgotten and may you be slaughtered like Bastard Zhang.      So wat if you have everyone's support, you are still a loser and outcast. Are you being Zhang, and stop showing me that fucked up face and get the hell out of my sight you bugger. I think you are a vacuum cleaner as you suck and blow at the same time, fuck you. You make me sick.

      Have not posted for quite some time, due to my hectic schedule and the exams. Went for the sec 4 farewell party yesterday evening at Jun Hong's house at Signature Park condo. Arrived at 6+ pm and then settled down at the swimming pool while listening to Zi Qiao's lame jokes. The others went to Jun Hong's house to play. Outcast.  After some time we were allowed to eat the otahs. The sec 1s were busy helping themselves while Kelvin and I took 10 and 7 for ourselves respectively. When the other guys came down from Jun Hong's house, there were only 5 otahs left out of 60. I was also enjoying my second helping of mee when they came. After eating, the fun began.  Gleen Sim went into the swimming pool knee deep and began splashing everyone with water. We took empty water bottles and plastic bowls and splashed him back. Shortly the seniors threw Bo Xian into the pool. Both he and his handphone got drenched. Then an unknown person in the choas shortly followed and threw Gleen into the pool. It was followed by a series of a few sec 1s thrown into the pool by Kuang Yong. Gleen who also fell in 2 more times. Everyone was splashed by water except for those barbecuing.  We stopped throwing each other in when Teo warned us not to do so. Gleen's mother also called to clarify some matters which was later settled with an apology. Everyone forgave each other. Later Bo Xuan and Bryan also showed us some combustion tricks using bottles and a lighter and it was damn fun and nice to see. Oops, forgot, a sec 1 got pumped by Bo Xuan for splashing water. I also got to see burning ice and some fire tricks.  Went home at around 10:45 pm and reached home 20 min later. Watched part of a movie until 12:30am and then went to bed. Woke up at 11am this morning. Got to study for the maths and sci tests next Mon. Signing off......

      Went air rifle training this morning at 11.30am and realised that my gun has no front sight. Tink I will be getting a new one soon. Better be quick cos competition's coming soon. Some bitches were also there training and gave out a fucking survey abt fucking stuff for ppl to do. They are also damn noisy, fuck, I hate bitches. Wanted to play LAN but too many ppl there so went home with bo xuan. Talked abt house of flying daggers with him. He says the movie is damn nice, will watch it when I get back the DVD.  Watched Troy today at home on my new DVD player. It totally sucks like hell. The movie is damn boring and the scenes at the back were especially dark and crowded and I don noe what is going on.   Oops, forget to post yesterday cos of the national day holiday. Happy 39th Birthday Singapore! That's all, I have nothing much to say. Fux! Pray for the death of Coach Zhang.

      Haven't seen Zhang lately cos I have not gone for training for nearly 3 wks. She'll definitely give me a scolding when she sees me for not going for training for such a long time. The ppl there says she is still as bitchy as before and had not changed much since the Nationals. Damn, she could have been dead in 3 wks. She could have been knocked down by a car and die on the way to hospital. Still, I can't believe she could survive.  Got the DVD player today and watched Spiderman 2. I can't wait to see the other movies. After the series of tests this wk, it was finally time to relax a little bit before going on to Fri the thirteenth next wk for the Lit test. Then it is on to the Science and Maths common tests 3 days later after black Friday. That will be the time when all the tests are finally over. Huge relief then. I can't wait until then.  Well, I have not much to say abt the Hate Zhang Campaign. I may not implement it of Zhang treats me nicer. Then again, it is impossible. Nevertheless, Zhang will be my greatest enemy. Slaughtering Zhang, slaughtering Zhang is my pride!

      My school's national day celebration began with a parade this morning. It was lead by NPCC and the rest are NCC, St John's and Scouts. The NPCC were the neatest and the Scouts were the worst. Their bugle band sucks like hell. Also, all their ppl looked like fuckers. The band did exceptionally well and the drum major was also zhai. After the parade, everyone was treated to a concert and it ended with a series of national day songs. After that, I went for the Air Rifle elections.  Firstly, we elected the 'c' team captain among the sec 1s. The elected captain was Han Wen, We think he deserved it as he had all along been helpful and had the responsibility. Next, it was the vice captain. I was one of the nominees, yeah! But I didn't get elected and got trashed by Hoe Kit, another sec 2. Perhaps it was because he had all along stayed in the schools for the trainings and thus the sec 1s got to know him a lot better and thus had more trust in him than me. I think it was also because he was a better speaker than me and had the support of the teachers and the seniors.  Nevertheless, I felt a bit sad on not being elected and strongly feel that Hoe Kit will never be able to look after the school team's welfare as he had just entered the club this year. Also, Bastard Zhang doesn't noe him and he also does not go to SAFRA to train. Since he does not noe anyone at SAFRA or noe anything abt SAFAR, he would not be able make contact with the ppl there and thus would not make a gd leader. He is unable to help us if anything goes wrong at SAFRA and is not able to help ppl like Zi Qiao who seems to have trouble lately. Maybe as time passes, everyone will noe that Hoe Kit will have difficulty being the vice captain and won't be of much help in the near future. But, I still respect everyone's decision. Only time will tell the truth. Fucking shit.  As for the captain, it was a tough competition b/w yi jie and yi da. Both of them had the same number of votes after 3 rounds of voting and yi jie finally emerged as champion after a tie breaker by a former teacher Mr Low. Congratulations to everyone and I hope that the club will scale greater heights in 2005.   After the elections, Bo Xuan, Bo Xian, Kelvin and I had lunch at KAP. Then Bo Xuan, Bo Xian and I went to SAFRA to train. Luckily we didn't get to see Bastard Zhang there. I reached home at 6.30pm and played Kick The Boss on my handphone. It was Zhai and damn fun. I treated the characters in it as Old Jahu. Yeah, happy day!

      Got com study test today, it was OK for me, just the right difficulty. I cheated in some parts by using alternatvce methods to solve certain problems. Also I changed one of the questions' answer when I found out from my friends that I was wrong. Sorry for that but I can't afford to lose 10 marks for the test. Also, there is going to be comprehension test tomorrow. I hate such tests as I usually score very badly in them. Flower fucker power, yeah! You can put a flower in front of her and she will be focused onto that flower and thus would completely become your slave. Then you can slaughter her, juz like Bastard Zhang. Hahahaha.  I still have both the history and geog tests on Thursday plus ting xie on Wed. It's gonna kill me. Still praying for a postpone of test dates, esp for geog. I still don noe when is the lit and maths test. Shit, die. I tink the reason flower always take leave is because the seedsare injured and require special attention. They are very vulnerable to mortality and may die easily. Anyway, I am still looking foward to national day, Guan Jie Jie and Yappy. Gay pub and babara is bi-sexual. LOL  Found a new blog: http://booooooooooo.blogspot.com, I think a motherfucker created it. He is hong hui's friend. I think that he should go home and fuck himself. Nothing much to say anymore, some ppl are still having serious attitude problems and I don give a damn.
