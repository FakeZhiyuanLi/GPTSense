      So strongly do I feel about a particular 'cultural behavior', that I must right about it to share my view as a person who is NOT a racist, NOR prejudice toward the said individuals who share the behaviors mentioned herein, and then some not mentioned. If you have been in the situation, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Ignorance!   I am an observant individual, skeptic perhaps, to be sure.  I find it completely unacceptable, that ones race may not be mentioned when exclaiming a personal, perhaps globular dislike for a certain individuals behavior, when it implies that another persons discomfort and unease is at it's highest because this one cultural individual cannot take responsibility for his (their) actions.  This afternoon, my daughter and I were playing three feet from our door.  Seven feet from our door is the road coming into the complex.  Apartment # 13, and the other apartment complex buildings that are 'accociates of a same cultural mishap, had a major problem heeding warnings.  Three times they were warned to stop speeding in and out of the complex at, literally, 60 miles per hour. After three warnings from the land lady and one warning from me; even with the forehand knowledge (If it is even possible for one 'like this' to absorb any information above three words and the noise of a beat-machine.) that children live and play in this complex.  They felt that the warnings did not apply.  This behavior is defined as, lack of responsibility, also lack of  respect.  Well, as my daughter and I played peacefully, the brown want-to-be-caddy came rolling around the corner at 60-65 MPH, swerving to avoid having a head on collision with another driver from Apartment # 13.  In doing so, the want-to-be caddy came literally 3 feet from my daughter.  Completely ignoring that anyone was there, unaware of his surroundings in general, they continued to stop, talk, smile, and then jam on the gas, accelerating to at least 45 to their parking spot / front yard only 20-30 feet away.    In gist.  I called the Highway Patrol, and in doing so, got both cars towed, two individuals arrested, and a load of drugs and paraphernalia taken away.  Now, SUDDENLY, the applicant's of Apartment # 13, have eye's and ear's.  Now they suddenly have an issue because their cars and friends got taken from the premises.    To the point that I am making.  I said later that day, as a purely open minded and aggravated person, "I grew up around 'these types' of people, and it is always the fucking same. They get all fucking pissed off and destructive when the cops get called.  It is sad because they make it get to that because they are def until they are in cuffs. Suddenly their hearing is super sonic."   In saying this, I used the term black.  In the sense that I was pointing out a fact, not a prejudice;  I think 13 years of experience in these living environments, with these particular 'types' of individuals speaks for itself, and that is that; rather a purely optimistic perspective.    "One line up, one line down, one line over, and another line up, makes a square.  Not me a square-making-pencil-hater! "  Upon which time I was informed that I was racist, and prejudice.  The basis for this was, "Other people do the same shit."  My reply was very very simple.  "Yes, and who are these 'others' dressing like? Take another look. And what 'type' of (Dare I say) music are they listening to? Listen again."  I am not a racist.  On the contrary, I love life. Especially my daughters life.  And if some ignorant prick; be he purple, black, or green, cannot slow down when passing my house, then I will call the cops on them.  That does not make me a racist.   If a certain people (The majority of) continually perform a certain action for 25 (PLUS) years, then they obviously adhere to that particular behavior.   It is almost like saying I am a religious racist because I point out that, say, the Christian religion has murdered more individuals and masses than three Hitler's combined.   Ridiculous.  The message is simple.  "Stop making shit a racial issue, stop living in a delusional fallacy of 'racial pride', and take responsibility for YOUR actions. If someone is a fucking victim, there must be someone who made you a victim.  This means, YOU CAN BE YOUR OWN VICTIM!"  HtS!  P.D.C.  P.S.  Allow me to get to the punchline of the other side before anyone else can begin to attempt to argue with me.  YES! there are people of said race (BLACK) that do not behave in this maner, however, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUALS (a small small small percentage.), SO IT IS IRRELIVENT!

      "The bible, as is known to the minds of the physical, material reality is nothing short of fallacy.  It accounts for nothing, as is seen, but controdictions in the sense that are, morally right or wrong, or don't kill, but kill now..  It's entries have been torn apart by themselves in the testement of old and new. With every addition that someone cretes, it just creates more allacy, simple because the new liars cannot keep up with the old lies. There e just too many. I believe this is partially because of facts being mingled with opinions, or pipe dreams.  Too many different authors.  However, I am under the impression, that sections of the bible, old or new, are of sorts,  'Shamanistic entries'.  That some of the entries involving detailed descriptions of 'heaven' and 'angels', are of the holographic model outside of this material reality. Part of the same reality that a Near Death experiencer or Out of Body Experiencer would travel.  To each person, or culture, the 'heaven' would be different, according to what has been implanted in the brain.   Such as the travel to and from 'heaven'. "Crossing a river."  "Walking a road"  etc.   Depending on what is taught or believed, will be in part what is seen on 'the other side'.  Suggesting for a moment, that with all morals, rules, commandments, (Some commandments, as it is said that the 'light beings' on the other side, continuesly send the message of pure love to all.) and personal opinions aside, that other entries are actual documented cases of 'astral travel', or OBE. (NDE)       OBEers and NDEers have been documented saying that color is distroted in the other realms, and so I ask, why not literature too?  The literature is sent to a person on the other realm in 'thought balls'; as described by one documented OBEer, where when returned to the material reality, they write down an experience, as a Jew, or a Westerner, and it becomes what is known to them best. Heaven, and Angels.  To an Egyption, it would be 'people with the heads of animals'.  To the buddhist, a ball of light.   Examples from the bible could consist of, "fighting with tigers, comming out unscathed."  "The flame over ones head, being of the aura. One of the chakras."  "The dead comming to life. Also known as christ."  These incidents, being false in the material world, or fantasy, could very well be explained in another reality, or dimension.  The holographic model can give explanation to these accounts to some higher degree."

      Is this irrelevant? 	I've noticed over time, many Roman Catholics, Protestant, Christian, and even the British, wielding the sword as a cross in ceremony.  I've also noticed the sword of a failed warrior is stuck into the ground over or near their dead body, resembling a cross, or tomb stone. I've seen many battle axes, created by the Roman Catholics, used in executions, and gladiator battles, shaped just like crosses.  	The Axe used by Christians, during beheadings, was shaped just like a cross, while the executioner himself is dressed to resemble the death figure, with his hood.    	It is easy to understand that now, in the newer age, the cross is to resemble some sort of pity for a madman.  However, the cross, in form of weaponry, or the actual torture device, existed long before that incident took place.   So I pose the question,  What is the cross truly resembling, what does it truly mean symbolically, if anything? 	It certainly is not pity for a lunatic, who in all actuality gave his life up for what he believed was the right thing, for his own personal rebellion against the man, much like David Koresh did, and not for the lives of his groupies.   	Anyone can be a Messiah. All you need is the ability to speak, write, and attract mental slaves who can be written, and rewritten to your own will.   It still doesn't make you a Messiah, just the leader of a few dumb men.   (The net may seem free, and it may be a 'controversial' place to out down laws and order, but it is a reality that this has been done already.  Search, we will say for the sake of topic, "Crucifixion Before Christ."   As we know, there were crucifixions before Christ, but the net will not produce those results.   This essay is going to be diffiCULT because of the controlled factors.)  	To cover my basis at least a little, here is a link that shows crucifixion as a normal and commonly used method of torture, debasement and killing of ones character and body, before Christ. http://www.textweek.com/art/crucifixion.htm   How do weapons fit into all of this? 	There is one clear connection that screams, but has never been mentioned as far as I have heard. The resemblance of a sword, or certain types of battle axe, are that of a cross. Even cross bows, with it's over obvious name and intention.   The weapon kills someone, and the cross is used to kill someone, as well as the idea that the weapon as well as the cross, both are symbols of death.   	The cross for instance, (this is odd to me, although not really because homo sapiens have always been redundant) not only provides the death, but is used symbolically a many hundred years later to show some sort of homage to party who died.  It is almost like killing someone twice.  Once literally, and then twice, metaphorically.  Not very 'respectful' and 'loving' if you ask me.  If I get hit by a mini van, I'd prefer it did not become a pendant with my initials on it.   Then again, you have the cross, within many hand held weapons (No pun intended. And yes, you can be nailed by your hands to a ross, and stay up until decomposition. It has happened in the today in Siberia, south Africa and other crude outer countries.) which are also used to kill.  Almost as if the, even more so, psychotic branch of Catholicism, inadvertently created a hand held version of the crucifix, and went on with many inquisition, like the Spanish.  When the participant in a battle dies, even more awkwardly resembling the now pendant form of the crucifix, the deads sword is pushed into the ground, as a marker, or tomb stone. "The cross is erected." 	Another point I'd like to make, is the carrying of the sword. The sheath was 'purposely'? placed on the side of the warrior, or on the back.  On the back it has slightly more meaning symbolically, as the soldier is possibly going to die, he is carrying his death with him, just as Jesus did, and just as every other Jew and Heretic did.  Then you have the sword on the side. Which resembles that of a monk, or priest.  As the priest and monk (And other clergy) carry the cross on their sides like a belt, so is the sword, as if to say symbolically, "God is with me." (And if that's the case, why all the armor?)  	Some swords though, had an engraving of a cross, right smack dab in the middle of the cross, on it's hilt.  Now I wonder, were they just being redundant, as humans usually are, or did they not notice that they were already carrying the all loving symbol of god, and hence suggesting that this is all done sub consciously?   	The symbolic likeness's are all over the place within the realms of torture, devised and used by those faithful followers of the RHP, coincidentally (?)  	Let's take a look here, and try and place the religous likeness, beside the torture. Keep in mind that these tortures were usually performed to gain knowledge, secrets, but also because one was a barbarian, to say, not like them. What better way t rehibilitate the heretic than to torture him, as if it were some symbolic reference to rehibilitation, to make like them by means of cruelty.  1.  A very popular method of killing people during the Middle Ages was to boil them alive.  	Maybe, being baptised?  2.  Skinning was probably one of the harshest ways to die. Strips of your skin would be removed from your body. One piece at a time until you bled to death.  	Perhaps, off with the old, on with the new?  By this I mean in a purely symbolic manner of an exterior excorcism.  3.  Iron pieces of furniture such as iron beds and chairs were positioned over a fire and the person was laid or sat in the furniture. They would then be cooked, or roasted.  	Another form of excorcism?  4.  Obviously, crucifixion is widely known. People would be hung from trees and left to die.  	Well, that's what this is partly about. G to Top.  5.  Women who were suspected of being witches would be thrown into a body of water such as an ocean or lake. If the woman floated or swam she was guilty of being a witch. If she could not swim and sank the woman was considered innocent.  Not sure how this could be symbolically linked, however I can point out that these folks really had no knowledge of Gastrotomy.   6.  To be eaten or stung to death by insects. A person was placed on a stake. It would then be placed into the ground, at which time that person would be smeared with honey and left for the insects.   	Very similiar, minus the human intervention of honey placing, to one of the Jewish myths, "The sworm of insects." acoding to the 'end time.'  7.  Prisoners or criminals in medieval France were placed in oubliettes and starved until death.  	A forced form of religous fasting?  	It just seems that so many demented acts of the RHP over time, have very similiar religous symbolic value in one form or another.  I am unsure if this is a fact, but it is certainly a coincidence at the least, and a huge undeniable in likeness.   Any thought's on the subject?  P.D.C.     First the cross, used by Christians to an exhaustive degree, is  incorporated  into murderous weapons, also used by Christians to an exhaustive degree.   Coincidence? I'd say most definitely not. Murder and Christianity are  interrelated. Who can forget the crusades AND the Inquisition AND the  witch  burnings? Not I, and I definitely don't need to remind you either. And  what  better way to kill in the name of God than to make your weapons into the   very symbol of your belief? (Swords in non-Christian cultures are not  cross-shaped). Anyway, the point is, if you were unsure about this  observation, don't be. If Christians were allowed to kill people in the  name  of God like they used to (and many still would if given the chance), I'm   sure they'd carve a cross into every bullet. But sorry, it looks like I'm   getting off track here.  "Anyone can be a Messiah. All you need is the ability to speak, write,  and  attract mental slaves who can be written, and rewritten to your own will.     It still doesn't make you a Messiah, just the leader of a few dumb men."  Of course this is correct, even today when people think they're smarter  than  their ancestors. I'll bring up L Ron Hubbard as example and his gang of  Scientologists as I so often like to do. A religion he made up on a bet,  and  admitted to frequently, yet his followers still march after him just as  blindly as any sheep even after his death.  Ah, crucifictions. The method of choice by the Romans for disposing of  their  criminals. Notably, only Roman citizens were punished with a quick  beheading  instead. Jesus was certainly not the first or last rebel scum disposed  of in  such a way. Just a random little fact.  "The cross for instance, (this is odd to me, although not really because   homo sapiens have always been redundant) not only provides the death,  but is  used symbolically a many hundred years later to show some sort of homage  to  party who died.  It is almost like killing someone twice."  Hence Jesus as a martyr. This is right though, the whole martyr business  is  really quite morbid. It is indeed Jesus' hideous death and murder that  many  seem to care about more than his life. Just look at the movie by Mel  Gibson,  "The Passion" that does nothing but depict three hours of Jesus' death  with  only occasional mention of all of the "wonderful miracles" he supposedly   performed (I didn't see it, but my sister did. She filled me in). The  fact  that Jesus supposedly sacrificed himself for his followers' sins is all  well  and good, but Christians have decided to constantly focus on the death  of  their "savior" as if it were the most important thing he did. This, to  me,  having death and religion intertwined in one's head, does not bode well.  As  you say, it is NOT respectful and loving, it is dramatic and threatening   even in mere basic concept. It makes it hard to believe in "love thy  neighbor" and "forgiveness" when your image of a religious icon is a  dead  man with his flesh in ribbons surrounded by those who hate him.  Therefore, the following tortures, if they are symbolic, certainly do  fit. I  don't know much about the symbolic element, I just assumed that the  techniques used were designed to be the most horrible that the torturers   could imagine. However, it's also true that virtually everything in the  old  days of Christian rule were associated (more like perverted) into having  a  Christian meaning, particularly in the case in which something as  terrible  as torture must be disguised as "God's will." Therefore, considering it,  I  think that the listed associations are distinct possibilities. Good  notions.  I had other things to say, but my family has demanded my quitting of the   internet for today, so things will have to wait till next time. Hope I've   given you some things to think about and enjoy as always, and feel free  to  email me with anything you've got. I promise to respond, despite an  inevitable delay.  Satanic blessings, till then                                                        -Jared

      In one time or another,  Remember, There is only the moment to discover, Remember. Try not to fight it, You will only loose.  To see into the future,  To exchange the roles. Don't you get it? For better or worse, It is here, and there.  Start to finish, Beginning to end, Dark to light, Bleeding to heal. and in pain to feel.  The music,  The arts, The followers,  And the cunts.  It shall all die.  One thing will live on, And it is defined as Nothing.   The everything that breaths. The infinite darkness, from where life comes.  One thing will die, And it is defined as somthing. The blinding light, where all the empty flows. Shining White-like-blackhole! Come unto me, nothing.  See the truth, for what it is. Once to men, the earth was flat. It is round, and it frightened men to accept that.  Now they think, that life is solid. Here the truth, It's in your mind. Once they realize that life is thought, That what they seek, and what they saught, Was up to them, all this time, They will cry.  All the pain, all the lies, All the meaningless violence, where infants died! We did it. Our minds indeed.  Listen to reason, and you'll see. The the life we make, Is the life they lead.   P.D.C.

      Good table manners?  Do not chew with your mouth open.  Do not reach across the table to get salt etc.  Use forks spoons and knives instead of your hands.  Do not get up from the table and leave until other people are done eating.  It is not polite to do the oppisate or any other form of humanism than what is listed.  I ask "Why?" The common answer, rest assured, will be, "Because, it isn't polite." It get's me wondering. What exactly is Polite?     1.  Marked by or showing consideration for others, tact, and observance of accepted social usage.    2. Refined; elegant: polite society.  Synonyms: polite, mannerly, civil, courteous, genteel  This definition sounds exceptable in most cases, when not applied to eating. While eating, it appears as if you are being asked to act like a robot. That being unique during meals is unexceptable. That while your eating, your not you. You are who you are told to be, and this is defined as, "Table manners."  Middle English polit, polished, from Latin poltus, past participle of polre, to polish. See polish. -  This explains a lot. (Joke)  How about Manners? "The prevailing customs, social conduct, and norms of a specific society, period, or group." Yes. Now this fits perfectly with my earlier translation of Polite.     The only thing I can see making any bit og sense is that reaching across the table to get somthing, may result in an elbow bumping someone or somthing, or maybe an article of clothing, sleeve, falling or brushing someone's food.  This I can under stand is a little gross. Another reason, but at fault by being at the dinner table with other people to begin with, is that one could have bugs on them, and they could leap off into another persons meal.   The question of Courtesy comes to mind.  I do not see however, how one has to do with the other, courtesy and manners, as they are often said in the same sentence.  Willingness or generosity in providing something needed.  It is said to also be related to, Politeness, but I beg to differ, nor do I see a connection that is all realistic, besides word play.  Courtesy is holding a door open for a someone who has their hands full, or holding some of the bags.   One manner would be to say "excuse me" before you leave the table because others are still eating.  I don't follow.  It is rude I hear, but I am not explained how it is rude to get up when your done eating.  The only explanation is, "Because, that is bad table manners."  I don't follow.  What I do see is, a control tactic.  This table manner to me sounds scarily like a RHP doctrine. "Don't have sex before marriage because it is bad sexual conduct.  It is to say, forbiddan."  I can see in my mind, as it is probably the case, some small child getting the shit kicked out of him for leaving the table without saying excuse me,  by his overbearing father while he screams at the boy,  "Bad, Bad table manners, you ungreatful little shit. You know better than that." (Actually, I have seen it. Not to that extreme, more on an emotionally damageing level of this extreme.) Know better than what?  As far as I can tell, knowing better than something indicates for instance:  You have burned yourself by touching the iron after being warned against, and then doing it again.  Now damn, you should or do know better, but your too stupid to figure out you aren't supposed to touch a hot iron.    Another one that confuses me. Do not use your hands to eat. However! there are foods you CAN eat that are appropriate. WTF? As far as I can tell silver ware has no other purpose than to look flashy.  They make for extra work, as you have to clean them, when you could just as easily clean your own hands when you were done eating.  As every animal does. (Hands, paws etc.) I'm not sure what else to say on this one, because it seems so common sense to me.  So basic.  It appears as if RHP has struck again.  The same ones who claim civil, are the same ones who go to war, make the enemy get naked, huddle together, and take snap shot of them before and after they blow their heads off.  The same civil ones, are those who kidnap teenage girls, lock them in a bunker and rape them for months on end before getting caught.  I understand that both spectrums cannot be wrong.  So then, what is it?  Silver ware, or your hands? Which one is in reality, more conventional?  Do not chew with your mouth open.  The only reason I could see this as being a manner, is because other people do not want to see your food.  Well, duh, can this be any more of an easy task to resolve?  DON'T LOOK!  I know on a personal level, that when I am eating, I am not looking at other people.  I am too involved in feeding myself to care whether or not other people have their mouths open or closed, or if they have their feet on the table.  Secondly, I find it rather restricting to chew my food closed mouth.  Have you ever looked in the mirror while you chewed this way?  Your facial expression looks like that of a man who just got a grenade stuck up his ass.  It makes the jaw muscles sore after so long as well.  As far as I am concerned, it is more comfortable to eat with the mouth chewing open, as opposed to closed.  The only time it makes sense, according to an instinct, is when food is about to fall out.  The tongue then sucks it back in right after the mouth closes to save the food.   That is all for now.   P.D.C.  P.S. Perhaps other forms of "Manners" will be inspected later.     Telephone manners?  It is said, or so I heard, that their are telephone manners.  I've also heard that saying excuse me after sneezing is a must, that it as well is a manner.  These will be the topics of target today.    Starting off with the tele, I mst say right now that it appears that with every invention from ions, protons, metals, and scraps, without morals or feelings, comes not only a booklet that tells you how to use the product, but a hidden book with an underline specifying manners that come with the use of the invention.  Is there anything that comes as it is, without being corrupted by other peoples forced ideals? When I pick up the telephone, I say, "Hi" or "What?"  After all, you called me, and I dislike telephones, and only have one because you must if you have a home to live in.  Every decade 1 important phone call will come, the rest are useless jibberish from tele marketers and the fucking dentist.  (If I need a tooth removed, I will handle it. Save your money.) It is said that when answering the proper way to answer a telephone is "Hello, you have reached the flaming pit, How may I blind you?"  I disagree.   My residents is not a place of business, and if it were I'd have an answering machine / robot take my calls like every other business.  So far I'm not seeing where these manners play any real role except to condition and force people to act and sound rediculous. TO CONFORM!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Not that again!  I'm ditching the fucking phone subject. For fucks sake it is just too obvious why this is absurd, and has no need for manners.    On to sneezing. O.K. First I'd like to point out that sneezing can become one hard core moment.  You can sneeze so hard that you feel like your fucking heart is about to stop.  Now, as far as I am concerned, saying anything except a winded "Shit!" is just not on my to do list.  To make everyone else feel better by saying thank you, is none of my concern.  I wonder now, how does saying excuse me for ANY bodily function (That cannot be controlled, at all, even if you wanted to) equal manners?  Last time I checked, no other mammals said anything when they ripped one, sneezed, or wiped their monkey ass hole on the oppressing zoo keeper. (Score 1 for the monkey ass hole) As I write this, I sneezed. As I sneezed, a thought came to me.  I am now under the impression that manners, are nothing more than a way to promote God, and RHP religion. Stick with me here, and perhaps someone has another opinion. So far I sound like a lunatic. Lol, I like that. Any way. When someone sneezes, a second participant in the boogery bodily function, intrudes and forces God promotion by saying "God bless you."  WTF!!!?  I'm lost.  What the fuck dos god have to do with the dander on cats getting in my nose and pissing it off to the point of a fit? It al sounds pretty fcking natural and scientific to me. Are they (RHP participants) trying to get a foot hold on science by any mans necessary/ Or is there some old folk tale I'm unaware of?  Regardless, I'd like to request a lovely Oh hail Mary every time I rip a fart.  I'd also like to request a, Hole Jesus has risen, wen I have morning wood.    I ditch this one to, it is just to rediculous.   Enjoy it as a joke if you will.  P.D.C.

      I.Q. tests are not as accurate as you are lead to believe. Before you can become good at some thing (IQ Test), you have to have an interest in it. Like console games for instance. If you have little or no interest in console games, then you will most likely score low. In all rationality you are not labeled or considered a Gaming retard, or Eye to hand coordination impaired. To prove this you would have to find someone with a great interest in racket ball, which is essentially based on eye to hand coordination, get them to revel in a console game, and see if they were bad at the game. I do not need to perform this test to gather the conclusion, it would be rather redundant. Secondly, the test can be performed the oppisate, where the ordinary game wiz could not play a single game of racket ball without having a lot of 'sit downs' where his buttocks meet the floor.. This has been witnessed, with tennis.  The IQ test is based off of a series of puzzles. The goal is to see what you can remember after a certain amount of time. When stricken by total boredom, in a white room, in an uncomfortable chair, with a Dr. who speaks through his nose, your mind begins to wander, leading you to not remember a damn thing he or she said, simply because you have tuned him out, or almost fallen asleep mentally.  A retard, or Down Syndrome [Input your politically correct word here] would most likely and usually does, rank high on the IQ test. This is no surprise. Most retards revel themselves in puzzle solving. It is what they do. Why is another subject, but as it stands they are very good at them. Not to mention that this was a man made test, an invention, to test how smart a person was/is based on a mthematical deduction of questions remaining. Myself, only scored a 150 or 147 (Do not recall exactly) on the IQ test, and most likely would have gotten higher if the test had objects or goals pertaining to my specific interests. Meaning that, if I had writing tests I'd have scored higher because that is something of interest to me. If I had a test in politics, I'd score a lonely 3. The test is inaccurate and absurd. Having an interest in something has a great deal to do with what a person is interested in. Matching colors and answering boring questions is not something I am interested in. On the other hand, the woman who did my tattoos on both my hands was a drop out, a heroine addict, and couldn't remember something if she had a gun to her head. She on the other hand did nothing but puzzles, loved them, and scored very very high on the IQ test. Now if we are to understand that the IQ test measures a persons intelligence; well this is a perfect example of how sorely mistaken people are to the actual pertinence of this rigid and ridiculous test.  There are other reasons that allow me to say that the I.Q. test is inaccurate.  One example might be the Holographic theory. Read Michael Talbot.    (Edited) J.M.

      Those who have the opportunity, to have textbooks, and a helping hand, will probably learn less about life (What means a thing un-superficial) than those who have no text books, no help, and who are pushed out of public schools based on something so ignorant as skin pigmentation. What person of darker pigment would WANT to go and learn from this source. Given that the nature of the Dark pigmented people, have had their past stolen, and they now live by the same laws and rules that were followed by the no pigmented who stole them in the first place; they should have the common sense to see that, and another more determined point is simple. Those with the lack of foresight, to WANT to learn (Nothing) in such an environment, those who would fight, argue and die for it, deserve every bit of it. Give them their education. Let them die as empty as the last generations of Dark pigmented folk have. It appears as if their (For the most of them) futures are determined (By themselves) to be ignorant, or completely superficial and useless. Mannequins for the store front. Bling Bling! Sir.

       That is what Comrades are for, no?   I decided today that I was going to use my web shell to accomidate the Satanic Room, and my very good friend, Mr. Vanmeenen.    I have dubbed the site, The Serpent Senter.  I find the title very apropriate given that the new voice on the page is that of Leviathan.  I should be adding poetry and writings by Leviathan and hopefully some creative writing by his other, Lillith.  Updates should be pretty frequent.   I made this choice because he has the capabilities to utilize the source.  I on the other hand let it dwindle and never put anything up.  Since The Satanic Room is my source to post writing and art, I figure I don't need the shell any longer.  I will be only the manager of the site. Expect fun reading material for free minds  there.    If you happen to be anything like the drug enduced characters from the film Equalibrium, or the characters from Orwell (1984) then don't even bother going to the site, it isn't for you!    The progress is a little slow, simply because I spend most of my time teaching my daughter, and playing.  However, progress is being made! =)  I am enjoying this "I am the page maker" role.  I feel like the Key Maker from The Matrix (II)  (It just dawn(of the dead)ed on me that I watch allot of films.)    Maybe that will be on the new Serpent Senter.  (Let's not forget to mention that I just bought a 2 foot Boa!) A list of good films, and a list of bad films. The Satanic Room has the reasons already, so that would be redundant, and pretty much defeat the purpose of making this a Sub-Site of The Satanic Room.  This would be, the Index pages of Good vs Bad films.  Promotion list and Warning list.    HtS

      http://profiles.yahoo.com/caseyraves420      This boy is the waste of air which Satanism speaks about.  A drug addicted, loser.  He is one of the worst, yet still, thieves to walk amongst man.  He is below man.  He steals money from infants. He leaves infants in the dark. Literally.      Who amongst MEN, would turn the electricity off on an infant because the infants mother was someone you disliked?  Who amongst you would steal from your could be parents? also grand parents, or could have been child?    I am the father of the child now.  While he is two steps from being in jail, because of traffic violations. Because of being in the possession of drugs.  Who would ask for money so he could post his bail, and then continue to set such a profile! Who would in the same week, continue to use drugs.   As if the lender is any better by giving him the money!    Does the profile not speak for itself?      I say Destruction.  Kill the monkey!  Scratch the flesh from the muscles with a sea shell!  Crucify!  On it's own limbs, hang it high so it can glow in the moon light, and fester during the day.    Less than people like this monkey should be used to set examples with.  They use everyone, and themselves, so why not them to be used with themselves?  I see no controadiction.    "I can hate ALL the monkeys on this planet and accomplish nothing by doing so.   I can hate ALL the monkeys on this planet while targeting one at a time, and accomplish much."  - Some serial killer. (politician, police officer, criminal..............)

      Bill Cosby has more harsh words for black community  Friday, July 2, 2004 Posted: 2:41 PM EDT (1841 GMT)    CHICAGO, Illinois (AP) -- Bill Cosby went off on another tirade against the black community Thursday, telling a room full of activists that black children are running around not knowing how to read or write and "going nowhere." He also had harsh words for struggling black men, telling them: "Stop beating up your women because you can't find a job." Cosby made headlines in May when he upbraided some poor blacks for their grammar and accused them of squandering opportunities the civil rights movement gave them.  He shot back Thursday, saying his detractors were trying in vain to hide the black community's "dirty laundry." "Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it's cursing and calling each other n------ as they're walking up and down the street," Cosby said during an appearance at the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition & Citizenship Education Fund's annual conference. "They think they're hip," the entertainer said. "They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere." In his remarks in May at a commemoration of the anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education desegregation decision, Cosby denounced some blacks' grammar and said those who commit crimes and wind up behind bars "are not political prisoners." "I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is' ... and I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk," Cosby said then. "And then I heard the father talk ... Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth." Cosby elaborated Thursday on his previous comments in a talk interrupted several times by applause. He castigated some blacks, saying that they cannot simply blame whites for problems such as teen pregnancy and high school dropout rates. "For me there is a time ... when we have to turn the mirror around," he said. "Because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us. And it keeps a person frozen in their seat, it keeps you frozen in your hole you're sitting in." Cosby lamented that the racial slurs once used by those who lynched blacks are now a favorite expression of black children. And he blamed parents. "When you put on a record and that record is yelling 'n----- this and n----- that' and you've got your little 6-year-old, 7-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car, those children hear that," he said. He also condemned black men who missed out on opportunities and are now angry about their lives. "You've got to stop beating up your women because you can't find a job, because you didn't want to get an education and now you're (earning) minimum wage," Cosby said. "You should have thought more of yourself when you were in high school, when you had an opportunity." Cosby appeared Thursday with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder and president of the education fund, who defended the entertainer's statements. "Bill is saying let's fight the right fight, let's level the playing field," Jackson said. "Drunk people can't do that. Illiterate people can't do that." Cosby also said many young people are failing to honor the sacrifices made by those who struggled and died during the civil rights movement. "Dogs, water hoses that tear the bark off trees, Emmett Till," he said, naming the black youth who was tortured and murdered in Mississippi in 1955, allegedly for whistling at a white woman. "And you're going to tell me you're going to drop out of school? You're going to tell me you're going to steal from a store?" Cosby also said he wasn't concerned that some whites took his comments and turned them "against our people." "Let them talk," he said.      [Note from Terrible;  This is EXACTLY what I have been saying this whole time. Practically my whole life.  Responsibility to the responsible, and fuck you if you can't handle that.   There isn't much that I can say, as a white man, (I'm not white, I'm human.  The one flaw in Cosby's statements.) about Cosby telling 'his people' that they need to smarten the fuck up, and stop pointing fingers.  I've said it, Cosby said it, and so have so many others.   As for Jessy, fuck you Jessy, your an ashole with your head so far up yourself, people have a hard time understanding anything you say.]

      It amuses me at least a little that SR's, myself, and other Satanic figures, at least online, and very few CoS members new the hard core facts of the Bush administration Scam before he was in office a week.  I cannot say all the credit of hard core thinking can go directly to the Satanic community of any branch or root. I am sure some Atheists had the answers as well, given that they themselves were provoked by Bush earlier in his career.   I don't know who Michael Moore is, but since his popularity is going to go through the roof, I would like to say, "Thanks for the documentary, welcome to the group(s) of those who 'already' know."   (Ever been called paranoid? or perhaps that, "You over-think things?" Well, my response then was, "You just don't think at all", and "healthy paranoia is nothing more than extra awareness."  Now I just laugh at you.)  What still strikes me as odd, not really, "How is it that practically everyone I know did not vote for Bush, but he became president anyway?" And yet another question, "Does voting make any difference? or is it a puppet-show-system created for the sole purpose of allowing Americans to think they are actually doing something that is at all effective in the way our states are run? or for who they have running the states as the lead power?  I feel, and have felt for some time, that voting is just a show. A way to let people feel like they are doing something. That no matter what, the president of the united states, or a man on the senate, are already pre-chosen, and already have a seat with their name on it, long before they even get there.  Take a look at these amnesty's about illegal immigrants.  I, and everyone I know, and everyone they know; unless in some disguise of secret stupidity lied; (All of which are American workers who are holding onto jobs by a thread) voted AGAINST allowing illegal immigrant entry into the United states.  After a crap load of voting for about 3 months on the issue, I turn on the news; which is rare, because 99 percent of it is BS; and low-n-behold, 3 million ass holes leave their country for mine! Needless to say that I was furious, of course.   And in this type of situation I ask a few questions as well. "What the fuck is wrong with your country?"  also, "If it's that bad, and it GOT that bad, why would I want you here in my country? what does this mean for the future of my home?"  Also, "Who made your country that bad?"  This line of questioning goes on and on. I say this. The minute our country starts to look like one huge trailer  park, we should sweep through Mexico with a vengeance, kill any stragglers, and start to rebuild another America.  Either that, or realistically, stay in America, and with a vengeance...........  P.D.C.   P.S.  I feel this way for one MAIN reason.  (A few small ones.) I HAVE to learn your language here in MY home, where you were INVITED (Not by me) but when I go to Mexico (Only the twice, I almost hurled at the stench.) no one there HAS to know ENGLISH.  Even worse, the ones in America do not HAVE to know English.  I find that balance a little strange. In my OWN HOME, I Have to show you RESPECT by automatically and without question (My Ass, I know one word in Mexican, and it isn't Hello.) learn your shitty backwards language, but you do not even have to stop with the slang Mexican/broken English when I go to get a burger at a drive-thru. (Which again is rare, because fast food sucks. It smells just as bad as Mexico, and it leaves as bad or a worse taste in my mouth knowing that Americans, such as the one in Silicon Valley who blow their brains out because illegals are allowed entry to take American jobs.)  Little word of advice.   You make the bed, you lye in it.  Don't come wrinkling my  sheets because you pissed yours one too many times.

      My daughter.   Her own individual. Only two, and she is smarter than you! The creation of wit, the creation of intellect. Creative little mind, so fragile to the elements of the Klippoth-ic kind. I shall be your guardian, shield you from the light, of which blinds you from the truth. I love her with all my might. I teach her the basics,  and always much more. I shall show her the way life can be,  non dualistic, without the west.  Ever so free, So beautiful. So smart and quick, Dare I say, she knows her shit.  I smile when she laughs, I smile when she cries. I smile no matter, because of those, beautiful eye's. So filled with interest, curiosity. So filled with attention and so shall my intentions, be, of the best I can provide, To keep my smile by not closing those eyes. Be free, learn well, even if you make mistakes, I'll be sure you know, That trying is not a mistake. And that my love for your will always grow.  I am your father, you are my heart and prodigy, I am your guardian, you are a star, no matter what!  P.D.C. - Dad

      When spoken, "I am tired of petty thieves. I think all thieves should be shot." and one or more of the other participants in the conversation get angry or defensive, you can rest assured that they are thieves.  Or perhaps know a thief, perhaps a family member.  I say this, only because this 'solid' rule is easily rewritten to suit any occasion when guilt could arise. Leading to violence, basically outright ignorance.  I have made it clear many times that I a not a racist. That as far as I am concerned, there are stupid, and there are intelligent people.  With the exception of those who are trying to be one or the other via, a whole lot of work, who don't yet fit into either category, that is the way it realistically is.  There is NO SUCH THING as racial pride. A culture is a culture. However, there could be one of a million Mexicans, who decided to move to Africa with his child at the age of 4 months, and have him grow up experiencing an African culture.  This goes in any one of a thousand directions.  Can the Mexican infant, now a man, be proud of his heritage? Sure, why not.  It would be only a half truth, but truth is truth.  Could he be proud of his race? NO! It is absolutely impossible to be proud of something you had no part in creating. In this statement alone, I have titled myself, non-racial/ist.  If anyone is a prejuracial! piece of shit, it would be the ones attempting, and failing, to make any situation race based.  The NAACP is not needed, nor wanted.  The only reason they exist, is because a lot found out that it is/was easier to get what one wants by crying about what they don't have. FACT! The poor oppressed people! Oh boo fucking hoo. Read Voltaire.  Everyone has a worse story to tell, and everyone has had it worse, so shut the fuck up about your sob fucking war-stories.  Here it is, in sum.  Fuck Whites. Fuck Blacks. Fuck Browns. Fuck Yellows. And fuck everything else in between.    Unless your on my canvas, I don't give a shit about how proud you are.   And furthermore, on the subject, since it is idiotic, I figure I'll poke some fucking fun at it.  Your not White, your Peach or Tan.  Your not  Black, your brown, or charcoal.  Your not Brown, your more of a bronze-yellow.  And your not Yellow, your more of a gold-tan.  If your going to have pride in something that is impossible to be proud of to begin with, at least learn your fucking color palette ass holes!  Heres another tid-bit for you whiny-asses.  When I say the ever so dreaded, THEY, and then proceed to exclude a portion, we all see for ourselves who it is I'm talking about.   IF YOU GET ANGRY, then, I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU! If it is none of your concern, for the simple fact that you do not partake in the idiocies I mention, then you would not bother wasting your time getting flustered.  Also points out another crucial element, to you who are excluded from the shit-pot.  You obviously have agenda's.  (Children, Jobs, Taxes, et cetera.) For those who continue being ass holes, it is obvious that your guilty.  On the fucking ass hole who almost hit my daughter.  First know, that the fucking skid-marks lead right up to the back of his fucking car.  Also, this earth is not a Harry Potter reality, and no other cars disappeared into another realm through the back of his fucking want-to-be caddy. He stuttered incoherently, "It wasn't me, but I'm the only one who drives this car. Yea, but sir, you don't understand....."   My response to his babble was simple.  "Oh, so there is another duplicate car just like yours somewhere? and these tread marks just fucking appeared out of thin air?"  No response from the ass hole.  Now this is an obvious case of what I'm talking about. Ignorant, no good piece of shit, who HAPPENS to be black.  Urban sub-culture Black American.   Every time I deal with this type of shit, guess which characters come to the surface.   You got it, Urban sub-culture Black American's.   Allow me to spruce up the hate of the ignorant here for a moment.   They had DRUGS, they SELL DRUGS, they LISTEN TO RAP!, none of them WEAR CLOTHES THAT FIT, and they are completely unable to SHOW RESPECT, even when it comes to AUTHORITY. Wow, all those capital words make for a pretty poster that I have heard whined about before.    "It's not fair.  Not ALL blacks are 'like that'."  DUH ASS HOLE.  But there ARE BLACKS LIKE THAT!  Somehow the issue was avoided, and all of you dumb cunts fell for it.   "DIVERT, DIVERT , WE ARE BEING QUESTIONED. QUICK, Home-Slick-Prick-G-Money, go get a rep. from NAACP.  No we CAN'T take responsibility for our actions.  DUH.  As a Homey, I have the basic rights to be a piece of shit, harm the safety and happiness of others, and get away with it, because my great great great grandpa in Louisiana was strung up in a tree by some fucking ass hole who couldn't do his own fucking chores."  All of that skit, is just as dumb as what I heard one man say in N.H.   "Nigga, yo, nigga, fuck you, nigga" On quote.   I from the back seat said it just to be an ass hole.  "Stop saying nigga, nigga."   "What, What X35."  (The fucking Watts riots in a van, how awsomely funny.) "You can't say that, your WHITE!"    "Why not, you say it every other fucking word.....nigga." (More steamed aggravation.)   "That's only because the WHITE man has been saying it all these years, it's our turn now."   "No." I said flatly. "The WHITE man said Nigger. Can't you hear boy?"     Well, needless to say, I made many black friends from this little step up, and one very bitter black enemy, who could not handle the fact that the WHITE man was right, and that he was being ignorant and foolish.  Regardless, most people stopped using the word, because it was explained in BLACK AND WHITE, that it was very stupid to degrade one's own self because in essence, the White man said you could, it is your turn.  How degrading some people are to themsels, and emberrasing to others.  I'm tired of talking about the idiocies of Race. The next person to mention Race to me is going to get my size 9 right upside the fucking head.  HtS!  P.D.C.

      I have gotten two snakes, for the price of one. The Python I bought for 80 dollars was the best buy.  It was, it appears, abused. The heating blanket under the tank was fried out, but plugged in.  He/she was also flicked or poked. Let's say, it is the only serpent I've ever seen cower away from a human before. In fear. The snake is 2 feet long and about 4 to 5 inches around. Over fed as well. (a rat a week as opposed to the traditional 1 a month) Big enough to take a chunk and do damage but refuses to do so.  It would rather slither under it's rock than strike.  Well, the serpent is safe now.  He/she looks like this; http://gallery.pixel.tc/albums/python/IMG_0261.jpg  The other snake I recieved was free. Someone had him/her in a tank, but their dog broke the tank, so it was living in a tool box. I gladly took him/her off their hands. This one is far more friendly and great with the two year old. Elaphe guttata guttata, also known as the Corn Snake.  This one happens to be the OTHER breed (Not the brightly colored one with the ring pattern.)  of Corn Snake, known as the Red Rat Snake. (If I'm not mistaken.)  He/she lookes like this;  http://www.members.carol.net/~jmaloney/snake30.jpg The snakes under belly reminds me of a string of DNA code.  Really docile.
