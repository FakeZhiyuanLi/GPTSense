      Tiffany's cousin has a 'hot friend'. Carolyn and I wanted to see this 'hot friend'. The three of us decided it would be fun to take the cousin and hot friend to a party at Ryley's. Unfortunately, they would not arrive home from Fredericton until 10:00pm. Therefore, we decided to have some fun until then.   We first drove to Ryley's party alone. There was no one there. We left.  We picked up Daniel McGillan at the bridge. We drove back to the party. He smelled like the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable. "Roll down your Damn Window!!" Poor Tiffany was in the back seat. We got Daniel drunk in a matter of twenty minutes. We dropped Daniel back off at the bridge.  We went to pick up the cousin and hot friend, however, they had a 'better' party to go to. We went back to Ryley's alone. We went swimming in our clothes. We stole the Allison's Lane road sign. We went back to my house for the night.  The rest of the night consisted of late night swimming, hot dog boiling, and bed making before we collapsed from exhaustion.   We will never take Daniel with us for a drive again Tiff'.

      Alright, so I was on MSN talking to Tiff when she suggested we go swimming up the sou'west. It was fun. There were french skanks. I hate french skanks. They had beer. It was thrown. We were sprayed with french beer.  We decided to go see Jo'. I got changed out of my bathingsuit. I had forgotten underwear. It was not good.   The four of us, Tiffany, Megan, Jody, and I, took a drive into town. We went to Dairy Queen. It was fun. I discovered that I do, infact, like Georgia Mud Fudges.  We left. We stopped at Irving. Tiffany and Jody ran in. Megan hates when I turn up the music and roll down the windows. They came out. We drove home.  They had gotten marshmallows. Gooey, sticky, disgusting marshmallows. I love marshmallows. I hate marshmallows in my car. They threw them out the window. They stuck to the roof. Marshmallows, on my freshly waxed Topaz. Don't get marshmallows on the Topaz!!!   Oh, and Megan, we will never leave you behind in the Sobey's parking lot ever again.

      Carolyn phoned me at noon. She wanted to go swimming so I picked her and Megan up and we went to the Oxbo to do just that.  Unfortunately the Oxbo turned out to be rather crowded. The road was rocky and steep and once we finally arrived there we decided our time would be better spent at the bridge. I turned the Topaz around and sputtered back up the rough road to go to the sou'west.   It being New Brunswick day, as well as a naturally beautiful, sunny afternoon, the bridge was swarming with people. Both Kenzie's and Stewart's Tubing were sold out. There was hardly a place to park. We phoned Jenna to come swimming and stopped in at Tiffany's house to see if she wanted to come but both declined. Therefore the three of us went swimming in the piss-infested river water ourselves.   We swam for a few hours while 'people-watching' the foreigners and, of course, Madison. We then went to the top of the bridge to talk with the guys - Frank, Mitchell, Jonathan, Ryley and the whore. We were having fun but when Megan proceeded to throw a rock and hit a poor kid on the head, making him cry, we realized we had best take off. We encouraged the guys to come have ice cream with us in town instead of hanging out at the bridge any longer, however, Frank simply is incapable of being spontaneous and declined the offer. We went ourselves, nevertheless.  We went to Dairy Queen and got some icecream which we ate outside. Megan lost her toonie under the deck and could not manage to reach it. We drove back to the bridge, and, on the way, saw a dead skunk. It reeked. Megan took a picture (so it would last longer).  Back at the bridge we parked beside Frank's truck. The three of us went swimming with the guys and the whore for a bit before deciding to try and steal Frank's truck and drive away with it. We made several attempts to find his keys but were caught each time. We settled for tail-gating them to Hamilton's Grocer and, after picking up Tiffany at her house, hiding in the back of the truck while they ate. Megan went home after that.   The guys had to drop Jonathan's fourwheeler off so, to torment Frank some more, we tail-gated him, passed him, slowed, and stopped several times all the way to Sunny Corner. We stopped at Frank's house, where I drove his truck, and Mitchell joined our car load because the Topaz is more fun.  We took off, rounding the Front Road and driving back Kane's Lane to Jonathan's place. We then took off back up the Sou'west where I passed Frank on Pole Hill, then we pulled under the bridge and watched the truck pass us by.  Not wanting to waste our time sitting idle, we pulled up onto the road where Kris and Daniel were speeding up Halcolm. Never one to be outsped, I raced the car after him. I tried to catch up to them but only managed to pass them just before we reached Acadia Road where we turned around and slowed, swerving over the middle of the road so they could not pass.  We returned to the bridge after that, but the Topaz stunk so badly of burnt rubber that decided to give 'er a rest and proceeded to drive everyone home.   ~X This post is in memory of Emily Shaw X~
