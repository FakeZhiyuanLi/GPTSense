       O my goodness! band camp is over! yay yay yay. i really dont know what to think of the band this year.the freshman were so secluded and band camp that you couldnt even introduce yourself to them. talk about the cold shoulder =(. there were a few exceptions tho.my section(GO BERRYTOMES!!) is really cool. the freshmen (elevyn and kenneth are so tight) but i think there will be some conflicts in it (i came so close to ripping off treys head >_
