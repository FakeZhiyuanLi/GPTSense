I watched la bi xiao xin today and was quite shocked that starting from disc13, the voice change leh.. i defintely prefer the old one la.. but this version seems to be clearer than the older one.. graphics more sharp.. only xiao xin's voice change.. im rather quite sick.. cuz this one is not as "low low" as tat one.. not as cute too..   im so irritated by the romeo diary's assignment.. i type and type still cannot find the guidelines to it lor.. i think she's not truthful in telling me how she actualli found it.. ask her to tell me the guidelines she dint even to bother to msg back.. oh ya.. she bought a new phone.. dunno wad model but i think its more suitable for working adults ba...   my stupid uncle say thurs can get com liao but no one bothered to go and get it from the ah ma house.. ask kor to go take it , he still don wanna.. help him pay lai hui taxi fare still don want.. say wanna buy me dinner so long liao haven even come back.. from 430 to 6+ liao leh.. mux be playing soccer .. everytime ask him to come back earlier oso no effect.. lao ji la..  haiya.. i think i'll stop here today.. internet money gonna burst liao.. jia shang cable even dong dou mei you dong dao jiu yao fu qian .. hai..

      i don feel lyk tokin.. but wad the hell do u get the blog for? precisely, is to complain... but if ur frens noe of this blog, u cant really complain eh..   er....... i bought a microsoft office, hansvision.. AND FINALLY, NEW EARPHONES!!! but they are quite hard to put on.. but wad the heck eh..  quite frustrated with this week's survivor, cuz its jus a recap.. and last wk, they put the commercial of the next week of survivor rather than this week...   but how can you blame them? are the commercials supposed to tell you: "And on this week, its the recaps of the previous episodes, even so, we would  still  lyk you to watch it."   Cuz not rite? but its their job to keep their own bread. Considering the difficulty, i would still wanna go to mass communications if im in a poly...   Im gud at talking, so.. its the ideal job.. i hope i get a gud salary and stuff.. otherwise, i dunno how i shld live on as "The big spender"..  well.. my language a lil' weird today, cuz im basically not talking abt wad i've done.. i alwiz get misled... so.. oh, why the fuck shld i bother explaining, rite?

      i think im crazy sia.. too much things in my head la..  last time when lyk some 2 Ly folks when bowlin rite, den jasmine and kah butt say then when they're 25, they will meet and go japan *rolling my eyes*  den it made me say, when i grow up, if i can migrate to a place, it would probabli be Canada.. most likely though.. i feel singapore is too "un liberated" but america is too gay and weird.  britain wld b... i dunno.. their accent is very unnatural.. japan? uh uh..*shakes head* Canada is the best choice, i mean since i not english.. but asians are very despised in america, so i would not choose to go there..   referring to my first line, i think im crazy cuz i live in singapore ..

      i really serously need new earphones.. my last earphones spoil la.. damn wad..  but i don think i hv enuff money to buy la.. will go look for one when i hv the time to.. or actually remember to..  today, I'm going to buy a pick la.. i don really play guitar but i jus noe the notes.  its often my fav punk bands tat "inspire" me to learn music. but i hate the CCHMS band la..  i want to learn from jas how to do the changing words thing at the part you see "done" on the screen.. or mayb "done, but with errors on page"  you probabli haven notice the "done" or "done, but with errors on page".. Mayb tat's becoz you're not observant enuff  im quite frustrated with the government.. cuz we don have enuff liberation.. i don realli need liberation to the extent tat America has, but even Taiwan has more liberation than us.   Altho im not a jap freak [ lyk jas ], but they have jus the right amount of liberation. If you see b4 the smap concert commercial. you probabli understand wad im trying to mean...

      i went to an anti-avril website, featured in my links part.. and writed my comments there. avril is such fucker man! she does pop instead of punk and keeps thinkin that she is punk when she is not. I love Blink even if they're on MTV, but for avril is a different case. I got nothing against pop, but i hate avril. Nelly Furtado does pop, but i like her. Avril is a fucktard man.. she brainwashes ppl with her "punk rock"  she don even write songs, don even play guitar lor.. seeing her w/o make up is worse. she's even worse than britney lor.. she's lyk britney on the rock side. i remember tat perfect 10 had a contest and if you win, you can catch Blink perform in Sydney  but tat fella damn suay man.. travis broke his ankle while skateboarding and they were performing on 13 march in sydney but travis decided to continue tat show and cancel the rest of the shows. But tat fella is not suay in a way la.. cuz it was postponed rather than cancelled... to some day in sept.. long way to go man..  weekend's here so im kinda gonna chill man.. i love Tom DeLonge!! I love the enhanced cd of blink man.. can watch "MVs" not really la.. is not their official mv s lor...

       skul and ev thing  im kinda wanting to change the bkgrd music to "vindicated" by dashboard confessional but lazy to go angel fire.. so i'll hav to wait for another time to do.. anyway, i nid to fish homework, skul's startin in 2 days(sux, innit?).. guess i'll be mentally tortured watching dava's black face and his black mouth yakking and scoldin us away. im not even sure of my purpose in skul.   maybe jus to pls my parents, i guess.  i think when i get out to work, i won't be holdin a job related to wad im bein taught in skul. i dunno, im not trewlawney(hp's divination teacher)   or maybe, i cant even find a job and i'll turn out to be a parasite.  hopefully not.  yesterday i was readin HPatOotP(hp 5) while bro was watching the encore telecast of england vs portugal. he said they lost becuz rooney was injured at ard half time.  rooney was their only hope i guess.  the team i support lost(france) against greece(tards!), altho i kinda expected it cuz the matches seem to be very unpredictable(meaning the stronger team kept losing to the weaker one).   so i asked him if he was watching the france vs greece match. and he said no, he was too tired and mom wldnt allow neway. i joined him when i was taking breaks from readin. we occasionally skipped to ch u to watch me sassy girl, altho ive watched tt mov before.. its a funny film. sweet w/o bein too poignant(new word..haha)

       well..what can i say?   Spinning:  spiderman 2 soundtrack   Ytd, i had lik a class gathering with 6/11, 1/4 of the class, to be precise.  i didnt much talk to the rest. didnt relli wanna mix.  then we went to watch the best bet which kinda sucked cuz of the plot and all..  if u use that plot as an essay, u could have gotten a big fat ZERO!  0!  well, i didnt expect this kinda standard from jack neo so it made me more depressed than i already was.  Initially, i was considering whether to go or not, so if joanna go i oso go lor.  to be honest, i dread the thought of goin back, its not my idea of fun. Some things i expected to be happening did happen.  I guessed i went to the gathering at the mall was to buy the spidey soundtrack. that was my aim, frankly.  oh, i also bought cheshire cat! finally found it!!  then i went back home with joanna then she came to my hse for dinner and use the com til 9++pm.  after she went home, mom was kinda naggy. I dont know if the arguement btwn my mom and dad had already resolved(i mean she didnt come to my room to sleep today, she slept with dad), but i dont relli care.  I dont think i would even if they hav a divorce, jus as long as i get to live. i cant relli say i wldnt frick out, i dunno, ev thing seems kinda indifferent to me now, since i hav my own issues to deal with.  angst, confusion... bla bla bla  oh ya, then i think i slept ard 3am.. there was the match rite.. When it was 230am i wanted to wake my bro up to watch the match, but well, i guess its god's will that the hinges of his door creaked too loud when i opened it, that woke my "light-sleeper" mom up, who was kinda on an alert sleeping mode to catch us in case we sneak up to watch the match.  my brother cldnt wake up, so today, he woke up and called his fren.  "I cldnt wake up, was too tired to watch the match"  well, even if he did, its a 100% chance he'd get caught watching it and urging him to go back to bed.  i xpected it for my mom to be so alert.. guess its life for u, then..well, what can i say?   *note: im gonna go, "woo..haven had a long post lik this since ages"

You f***ed up my life  I'm sick of always hearing, Sappy love songs, on the radio This place, it's f***in' Cursed its plague And I can never escape When my heart it explodes  I can't forgive can't forget, Can't give in What went wrong, 'cause You said this was right? You f***ed up my life  I'm kicking How fiercely at the world around me What went wrong? I'm kicking How fiercely at the world around me What went wrong?

       Watching world idol[part 1] is lik watching Singapore's talentime   I was expecting World idol to roc since its lik "global", but the idols in part 1 stank! *pinches nose and fans air* I bet even SIngapore idol can beat German idol.  I hated that German idol. He was bony and he wore a sleveless[issat how u spell it?] top. I thought to bear with his looks cuz maybe he is lik clay aiken [ugly at first, but a w-h-o-a! voice]  But I was so definitely wrong.   He sang some karaoke techno song, *typing the word "techno" makes me wanna puke* , which sucked. It was horrible! And his excuse was, "Because everyone  wus  singing a ballad, I wanted to sing an upbeat song."   I dont hate upbeat songs, but he... how should say this.. well, he sucked!!!  I hope part 2 doesnt disappoint me lik part 1. I'm lookin out for kelly clarkson and kurt neilson[the world idol]

       Lunchtime!   I had bee-hoon for lunch today.  I needed to go to the further away place to buy my lunch cuz i needed to get my new specs there.  aniwaex, on my way bac, there was a report on the singapore idol auditions tt is going on right now. There were thousands of participants waiting for their turn and the waiting area was abt 400 sq cm..   I never approved of the spore idol shit. It's a typical waste of the participants' time. I mean, so what if u're crowned the spore idol? What kind of singing career will u get? Ppl are not going to buy ur album aniwaex, even if they do, how long do u think ure gonna last in this industry.  spore's a small place.  Unless u break into the american/british market, ure going nowhere. Or maybe u can convert urself into a mandopop singer and break into the taiwan market. If ure not gonna do that, i bet ur career wouldnt last long enuff to feed ur family.  Talking about it just makes me angry!  |September never stays this cold|Great Romances Of The 20th Century|TBS

       Boredom.   sheesh. Just when i thought i found a way to put the post's title in the "what u missed".   I'm fed up of trying to change it. I'll leave it the way it is.  I wanted to talk about the newborn baby that my auntie had but i decided not to [Due to the fucking com].  I went to a person's blog today and the whole post was typed in that all the punctuation marks like "," or "..." or ":" was replaced with fullstops. How irritating is that? I mean, ure trying to act cool and emo in this way, which u aren't.. sad to say.  can u imagine if someone writes a story like this [an i.e.]:  today.i had lunch.it was fabulous.i saw my fren.tim.down the street.talking to his fren.Her name was tina.reminded me of bla.and i went back home.my lovely nest.where i could enjoy the tv.it had tom and jerry.an animated cartoon.on.i went to the loo.took a pee.went back in.the loo smelt clean.dry.and hygienic.bla bla.bla bla bla. bla.  How lame can this get? First it was the neoprints in display pics, now comes this writing style.. Can bloggin get more idiotic than this? Why can't people type normally? This way, its easier to the eye too. I'm surrounded with dumbasses who can't even type properly.. What's so bad about the original method? These ppl obviously cannot differentiate between what is the better method for reading and trend of bloggin.  We already have enough fashion victims, we dont want any blogger victims who follow the trend blindly.  Use your brain ppl, and pls.do.not.type.lik.this.for.heavens.sake.

       Display pics   things ard me motiv8 me to write. Ok, so basically, there was a conversation of abt 7 ppl of my old class. In the conversation, we were asked to come for a class gathering and all. As usual, there's lik display pix rite, and i think there were abt 4 of them tt is of their faces or neoprints' scan..   This normally happens to ppl [who are vain, flirty].  L8ly, i sorta find a relation btwn mandopop and puttin real-life faces as display pics. Ppl who listen to mandopop [and flirt], often use their faces or neoprints as display pix..  Its lik an asian thing...  i nided to download the yu jian song for our project rite, den i had to ask my bro frens to move away so i could download it.  After i found the song, i was waitin for it to finish the downloading. So, my bro's frens resume their conversation[msn], and the gal put a neoprint as the pic..  im not gonna say much as ya'll get my meanin [and also not to offend]  | Do u lik my stupid hair? | First Date | Blink

       What a fun day!!!! yea, riiight.....   We [as in me and Jinghan] had duty at the cafe today. It was [as quoted from Jasmine] a  really, really  busy day. How ignorant was I to not know that so many ppl  actually , and may I stress on that word again?  actually  visited the cafe...  To feast on their glorious bowl of.... cup noodles.  We had a plasma TV and a DVD player there but there was a lack of sockets, so it was crappily wasted. There's like suggestions that ppl can post for comments and such, that they shld have for us, libria-cafe-ers [cross breed for "librian" and "cafe"]. First, the counter is too frickin' small. We were all cramped up tryin' to make milo, noodles. Second, they shld install a librians-and-customers-should-not-flirt-as-they-are-holding-up-the-queue rule. This rule is specially for Tina.  Some of the librians who work there were kinda pissed off that newbies[like me and Jinghan] get to work in the cafe too. And not to mention, unfriendly to us. Mudafukas like yourselves should get a frickin' life and stop complaning that the space behind the counter is cramp! We're fuckin' alive, we have senses and can sense that!! Doesn't take arithmeticians[?] to figure that out!!  Wait, wait, wait....

       Is there anyone out there? Is there anyone out..   Irvin and Shiru[Zhe rui] were told to move to their seats away in English cuz they kept talking in that vacant classroom, they also moved away in the "formal" classroom. I'm not really sure if dava knows that three of us were sitting in a row in the "formal" classroom, but they moved neways.   Thus, today's my first day of isolation.  And I coloured my nails BLACK.  Pls, if u see me with BLACK nails, pls dont ask why it's black.  And Ms Soh [Guat Ee], I have NOT burnt them, thank you very much.  Answer:   I was BORED!!!   oh, special thanks to Shi Ning for givin' me the disc, I'm gonna try it out as soon as my bro comes home. I hope he knows how to work it, yes I'm one pathetic lil' ass...

       "But then le tired..." -Taken from "The End of ze world" animation from  urlLink Funnyjunk.com   i have three words: tired, tired, tired.   ok, so that's only one word used three times. I'm really[!!!] tired. I guessed I've just walked a thousand miles...Isn't that like a song? Yes, its oh-so definately is.   As I mentioned in my post yesterday, I went to find the photoshop disc. It is so hard to find a pirated CD shop! I don't even know why the police bother to catch them. I think I found the shop, but it wasn't open. I walked and walked and walked and walked.. Alright, I not gonna fill you with my crap, just know that I'm REALLY TIRED!!!!   and I have PFT [Physical Fitness Test]&nbsp;tomorrow.... supposed to be running 2.4 km.   I should ask my mom to give me a foot massage after all that walking and to prepare for the running. I sound as if I'm enslaving my mom, but if&nbsp;I asked her, she would. I know what you're saying, commenting on how lucky I am. Yes, I'm admit that I'm so frickin'&nbsp;lucky to have such good parents... I'm not being sarcastic, I'M REALLY NOT!!   I'm going to Bedok Central on wednesday since I can't go tommorow [refer to above about PFT if you haven't been reading the shit] to continue looking for it.   Once again, wish me luck.  ___________________________________________________________________________________   Massage my foot!

       Pathetic scale reads: 30 Points   Thanks anon! I'm touched and shocked. Touched cuz someone likes a simple layout like this and shocked cuz i wasn't really expecting someone to have tagged.   Well, let's see.. &nbsp;I bought "Catalyst" by NFG today, went down to three stores cuz the first two told me it was "out of stock". I figured Simei would be a good location to find it cuz its so deserted and no one really visits there. Got my camera filled up with a roll of film.. I know, I'm pathetic [and broke, btw] but i really can't afford one and mom's not willing to buy me. If I had one, I'll definately post pictures more often. Film's kinda troublesome, you need to wait a few days to get the pics and scan them up to get it online... I'll also like to add that I don't have a scanner.. Hehe.. Ten points more to my "pathetic scale".   Tommorow, however, I'm cruising to parkway to buy a [pirated] Adobe Photoshop disc. How [pirated-ly] pathetic. I really like adding effect to pics, its somehow like the signatures you use in forums. It's abstract and pretty rad I must say.   Once I get it, I'm gonna start editing and put a new bar on the top... Hope I can find it, wish me luck!  _____________________________________________________________________________   Happines and Love from,   ohfreak[dot]blogspot[dot]com   PIC OF THE POST:    Blink in Iraq

       Featured movie: Ella Enchanted   &nbsp;  From left: Anne Hathaway[Ella], Hugh Dancy[Prince Charmont]    I watched it yesterday with Jasmine since  Mean Girls  was shown at a later time.  &nbsp;It's about this girl who was given the gift of obedience and whenever a person commands her to do something, she [yes and obviously, you might have guessed it] does it. Her mom dies so her father remarries a [yes, you've guessed it] rather evil step mom. The step mom has two&nbsp;girls, who are part of the Prince Charmont fan club. The older one realises that Ella does what she's told and&nbsp;starts bullying Ella. Ella, now desperate to find the fairy who bestowed her with this gift, sets off on a journey. Along the way, she meets ogres, elves and giants. Prince&nbsp;Charmont [who accompanies her, along with an elf]&nbsp;falls in love with her and is influenced by her thinking. So, he wants to the welfare of the non-humans when he gets the throne. They meet danger and blah blah blah...manages to live happily ever after.  Rating: 3 [outta 5]  Review: This movie was okay in the sense that although&nbsp;the plot is sort of clichéd, a lot of lil' funny things managed to keep it alive. Anne Hathaway was very convincing in the portrayal of Ella who's ordered around.  Reflections: If the movie was set in this period of time, and someone would've ordered Ella to "go fuck yourself", what would it look like? And how is someone gonna fuck him/herself?

       Wow! Im stoked!  And not just by the new layout of the "create post" part [well, i haven been blogging lately, so just count it as new, aight?] and also.... also, i can't rmb....  &nbsp;  i guess i'll jus crap along until i actually[lik when is that gonna happen?]&nbsp;do.  &nbsp;  I've been sick for the past few days and went home halfway thru' school yesterday and took an MC today.  &nbsp;  Damn, I just remembered i have library today! damn!!! It might be weird to hear of ppl loving their cca[esp. when its library] so much. Guess its due to the fact that i feel its a slackin' cca. It is, without doubt, a slackin' cca.  &nbsp;  guess I'll make it up by going tommorow.  &nbsp;  oh, and today is "slack" day too. For ppl not in my class, I'll have to explain a lil': &nbsp;its slack day in LY cuz the only main subject we have for today is science, other periods include, calligraphy, IT, Reading Discussion, PE...   why can't i have chose a better time to get sick? Argh!!!   anyways, i added a few new links to my blog [you can check them out at the "killed." section, but im gonna list it in this post anyway]   its:  urlLink http://punkrockvids.com    and  urlLink http://punkbands.com    and  urlLink http://danradcliffe.com &nbsp; only  if u have nothin better to do   and  urlLink http://seanbiggerstaff.com &nbsp;  speaking of sean, i just rmb-ed what was the other thing i was stoked about, its was simply becuz he likes blink too. [this is such a lame xcuse for getting stoked....but w/e]   that  urlLink tom felton site  [im telling you the reason why i didn't link it now] scares the shit outta me. The older he grows, he fugly-er [fugly means fucking ugly, so fugly-er means fucking uglier] he becomes.   It's as if that dick ass prophecy about draco malfoy becoming the dark lord [and becoming so fugly, no one recognizes him] is coming true.. excuse while i go hide under my blankie[ -_-" ]. Except the fact that mr. felton is  only  acting as malfoy.   im sorry if i pissed off draco's [or rather, felton's] fans. But it is frickin' true! The reason why I'm not addressing mr. felton as "tom", is becuz i don't wanna spoil tom [delonge]'s name.&nbsp;   I'm really outta line... for you dickies [j/k] reading this, help pray for me to get well soon. and for my uncle too.   pic of this post:    its becuz im sick, that's why it was a tisuue

       2nd gheyest day since school started.  Dava returned today. A good thing, but too bad his period wasn't the last period, or else, I wouldn't have dread this day lik I actually do now.  Reason started when MS JUDY NG[!!!] decided to punish us because we were late for her class. You can't really blame us, we went to com lab for our lesson before hers. Well, she made us run down to the 1st floor, to the new block, and come back up again. Not that I'm complaining. But she made us do it.   TWICE  . And, with a time limit too.  When we were outside the classroom, she asked us how long would it[the run] take. Jeffrey blabbered[existence of this word?],"20 seconds" Then Judy said, "Alright, time starts now." Then all of us rushed down. Some were slower due to the shock. Many [obviously] " wa lau -s!" rang across the corrider as all started dashing down.  As we ran down, many eyes were on us. They were probably thinking, "WTF are these kids doin'?" [Oh, did i mention some of the "eyes" include teachers as well??]I have an answer," Our screwed-up teacher made us do it!" I don't think any teacher has ever thought of this punishment.  At least they're not that lame to...   Probably Judy was thinking that she  wus  bein' creative.    Nuh uh, I don't think so...   ^^^^look, even my inner child is responding... [Did I mention that I did a quiz that states my inner child is 16?] I must be  OLD...  cuz my inner child is older than me... *starts faking a cough*  Neways, we did not make 20 seconds [ predictably , dare I say?]. So.... we had to do it again, 1 min this time. Everyone made the target.  So we went in class, restless and exhausted.[Wad did you expect? Energized??!!] I was taking loads of time to calm down because I was getting dizzy[btw, for the two math periods, i didn't recover] I felt sick, almost puke. Well, i would... If she continued with the quiz.   Let's get back.  She started on going through... Adelyn wanted to pee, but perdictably [again] she didn't allowed it.. So Adelyn started clicking non-stop on her pen. In the midst [of clicking], Judy told her,"I can sense your urgency.."  I laughed terribly loud.  But, [i hate to use this word!]  Duh!!  Do you know people that can hold pee for a long time? [excludes me]  Ade had stopped clicking, but dejavu was hitting me again. She again, started clicking non stop. This time, Wei Jun told her to " diam! " She then stopped, after a while, Judy allowed her to go. Having rather a fit, she stormed off with an raged look.  When we finally got back to the lesson, Zican was talking back to almost everything she said. She made him do "down 10" [as she would like to say] He didn't. They were at the back [or maybe it was because i was in the front], negotiating. Judy, who still insisted on the  down 10  [stubborn cow!!], wasted a lot of time forcing Zican to  down 10 . But [another stubborn  male  cow, that's why they two fitted together] he wouldn't.  Wei Jun: Ms Ng, since he don't wanna do, I do for him la.  I could tell you I appreciated this idea [since it was delaying the class's time]but nah... being the cynical person that I was, I never stopped thinking that he wanted to take this opportunity to show off his version of  down 10 .  She wasted an assload of about 10-15  persuading  [inappropriate word, blame it on my vocab] him to  down 10 . He refused, and landed the whole class with a  down 10  job.   So, reluctantly, I did it because I wanted to get it over and done with.   Zhe Rui: [continuing from whoever the fuck it was]Up 3, Up 4, Up 5...   He sounded shaky towards the end, but still persisted as the "leader" neways. I so frickin hate to say this but, through the "up-s" [lead by ZR], I could feel a tinge of class spirit. but I wiped it away as soon as it came into my mind. Not that I liked being pessismistic[sp?] and what not, but I hated it cuz I hated the class, hated the school, hated myself..  The  up-s  left me more fucked up and sick than I already was. I decided to taxi home.   On my walk with Addie[Adelyn, I realised I just invented a nick for her] towards the bus-stop, we ranted [and vulgar-ed] about maths lesson today. Oh, before we left class, I suggested we banged on the tables [I banged on Alvin's table and everything under his desk fell off. My apoplogies..] Everyone got irritated by it, but I could care less than that. I must state that the banging really helped me get it off my chest. Not that I was bothered about being shouted by other [class]mates of 2LY, since almost the rest of the bunch were fucking flirts, attention-hungry, sucker-ups..  B/N: I hate CCHMS.. If I had a second choice, I wouldn't include it in my list..  damn school!! I dread you, I hate you!!  I wonder how's ___ doing, hoped that ___'s not still sick  I'm not acting mysterious and what not, but yea.. I was thinking about it in school..so..yea

       font-atic for the day  i downloaded so much fonts that i practically went mad.. [exaggeration] lets see, i downloaded these fonts:      "eight track": this was downloaded at  urlLink soup-Faerie's site  earlier ago          "baby kruffy": i like this one, was the first one i downloaded from  urlLink that free fonts site , that site is really gud, so check it out         "skater dudes": this is okay i guess, its kinda cute         "punk ass bitch": i wanted to find that "blink-182" font they have on their latest cd, but i didnt noe its name, this has a similar 'scruffed-up' look, so i decided to download this one.         "damn noisy kids": i think y'll agree with me on this one, it has a 'felt-pen' look. its very defining, so its kinda cool.         this has that 'living pink tequilas' look, which is the theme of my first blog skin. it has a rebellic, freestyle look. need i say more?         u're probably wondering y its backgrd is not yellow, well, cuz the font itself is greyish, and when u put it under yellow, it looks faint. this one's very nice, very sketchy[lolx!]

       Crap on the winners listed below [Teens' Choice 04']  First off, I have the full list of award winners [of Teens' Choice 2004] listed in the last post, so you might wanna check that out. Yea, as usual, I went to  urlLink mugglenet.com  and  urlLink blink182.com  to check for updates. I knew from yesterday [or was it the day before? Hm... My memory continues to fail me!] that  Blink  won  best love song  for "I Miss You". Let's take a moment to say, "Awwwwwww....". They also won  best tour  alongside  No Doubt  who toured with them. - Source: those blink sites I always visit.  Mugglenet.com also provided the list of winners becuz  Harry Potter  won  best drama/action movie . Wait, is that right? Urgh, whatever, just know that it's something like that.  Yay! My obessions have a connection! [which I think you're clever enough to realise: Teens' Choice Awards 2004] I know you're calling me crazy, my theory [or connection] is pure fuckin' crap. But I sometimes wonder if  Tom  reads  HP  books. I think  Mark  reads them, he's like the most ideal family guy. I don't even think  Travis  reads, but I'm not a genious either.  I thought I should mention,  Paris[Hilton]  and  Nicole [Ritchie] , the  Ho s are hosting the awards [as stated in the last post already].

       Greattttt..  My bro, along with 6 of his frens are in the living room "studyin" now. Why can't they go to the library?? Damnit. But it does have its good points, cuz I wouldn't need to buy lunch then, one of his friends will go instead. Saves me a lot of trouble.  Greatttttt.  I cant move freely around the living [ballet-in to TBS's songs] now. Pssh. Well, at least they're stopping me from getting super hyper.  Greattt.  It's no use looking from the bright side of things.  What's happening outside: Ah boon! blah blah.... [My bro's name is Boon Wei] *a few loud bangs*  Would they stop that racket? Arghh!! Hanyang stayed overnight yesterday, isn't it enough? Heaven just LOVES to torture me with a bunch of shallow-minded fuck-asses makin a HUGE racket.. Aahhhh!!! I'm so sick of this!  blehx...   At least I'm pretty much "away" from this [cuz I'm in my bro's room using the comp] and blink songs comforts me..hehe.  I'm listening to "M+M's" by blink of their album,  Cheshire cat .  As the lyrics go:  Somethimes I wanna laugh, sometimes I wanna take my toaster in the bath.   The early days of blink... *sighs* ...The words they use to rhyme... Well at least it's funny.  I'm off track. BLAH!! wadeva. ____________________________________  Silly me, ohfreak [dot] blogspot [dot] com    a disco becuz of the noise.

       Description for Feature: 9-14 aug  This post is a description of this week's "Feature for the week". I decided why not put both videos since I couldn't decide one which one was funnier.  Video #1: "Ass Tent" This video is for promomting "Take Off Your Pants And Jacket" [one of their albums]by  Blink . Features  Mark  being a doctor,  Tom  being a teacher explaining about the effects and what not and  Travis  as a patient[has lil' screen time so you might not catch him].  Video #2: "Old Mc Mark" Mark singing to children, smashing guitars, cussing... what more can you ask for? "I love kids, kids love music... so I love kids' music. I mean, it's basic math!"-Mark in the video.

        Charmed  again.  Me with evil, seductive voice: Hi....  Me back to normal: You're probably wondering why I didn't continue from my last post since I was also talking about Charmed. My habit of trailing off made me start a new post [since I have nothing to do].   "Charmed again", the clever title [ugh!] I thought of has double meanings. First is because, yes... you might have figured out, Charmed is back for a new season. Again is therefore used. And..... and.... Second one: Since I was watching Mr. Magoo [the movie] on channel 5 yesterday, there were a lot of  Charmed  commercials. Two types of be exact, the first one is just plain, talking about the usual...when it's being aired and stuff. The second commercial is meant for you to  laugh . The narrator talks extra fast, summarizing what happened in Charmed for the past few seasons. The last bit, [the narrator] talks about them having a new whitelighter, Chris [Perry, if the info Jasmine gave me is right]. There were a few shots of him. And so, the second reason for "Charmed Again" is because I'm "charmed" by a guy "again". This time, it's  Drew Fuller  that plays Chris is  Charmed .  I'm not mad about him just yet, I don't think I'll be as mad about him as I am for  Sean Biggerstaff . *starts wiping sweat* Talking about him already makes you feel the "hot"s for him. Too bad he's just a small-time actor...   Sean , if you haven't realized, is the oh-so-fuckin-hot actor that plays Oliver Wood, the quidditch captain and keeper of Gryffindor in  Harry Potter .  And Jasmine, "sean" is pronounced as "shawn", not "seen"!!!

       Regretting it.   I'm changing the song later today cuz I AM SO ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THE SONG  Capital H   BY MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK!!! The song itself, has loads of fast-paced guitars, scratches here and there, sang with a funky typa tone. Yup, I just remebered that I should clarify that "Motion City Soundtrack" is a band, and not a soundtrack. It's the name that evokes awkward questions like, "Is the movie nice?" or "I've never heard of this movie". So, "Motion City" is NOT a movie, the band's name is "Motion City Soundtrack".   How I learnt of this band?  As most of you know, [which is happens to be me, myself and I cuz you guys don't read  blink 's news] Mark, if I'm not wrong, is the producer of their album scheduled to come out later this year. Upon reading the news, I guessed some  blink  fans went to find out what this band's all about. So happens that this song,  Capital H , landed in the Web Radio of  Blinkcentral . So I heard it and bla bla bla... you know the rest.  Maybe I'll be too lazy to even go to angelfire and delete, upload, copy and paste....[you know the details] I haven't decided what I should for my "Feature section". Right, right!!! I just remembered, I'm supposed to advertise that  Charmed , the new season, is airing on 18 aug, ev weds, 8.30pm!! Cut the shameless advertising for channel 5, back to my comments.  Charmed  as always is airing at weds, which makes me wonder is it a *insert word here, something like coincidence but better than that*, cuz they emphasized a lot on "the power of three". Weds, happens to also be the "3"rd day of the week. Is this a conspiracy? A curse?   ^^If you read that, you're probably thinkin' that I'm a lunatic to even have started thinking about it.  I'm a blood type A, A people think a lot [and become geniuses like me]. Pardon me for being so shameless. Ugh.

       Walk on the cracks of the same old sidewalks...  hi, song change once again and time to update the "feature section".. I'm thinkin' if I should put that  Old Mc Mark   video which I discovered just today, or the video of  Dr.  Mark , Teacher  Tom  and Patient  Travis  . Hm... Maybe I should put a  Sum 41  video, like  Still Waiting , perphaps?  Well, I'll decide later. For now, lyrics of  Look What Happened :   Look What Happened  by  Less Than Jake  And I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try and we'll walk in circles around this whole block walk on the cracks on the same old sidewalks and we'll talk about leaving town yeah we'll talk about leaving I swear it's the last time I swear it's my last try We rode across that bridge all night we talked our way through city lights traced all the lines we're killing time under those buzzing signs from downtown to anywhere but here tonight yeah I swear to these rooftops and just hoped that car would never stop we drove around this place all night past closed signs and familiar sights we're moving by passing time counting those center lines with 20,000 lines left to go that lead to somewhere I don't know it might be the time that we leave this all behind there's been a few times that we thought it felt right to take all the westbound signs and just leave town tonight   During the chorus, the guy singing it sounds so cute!!! Wonder if his looks fits his voice....[Pardon me for being so boy crazy, I love guys with great voices, like Mr.  Tom Delonge  for example.]  Oh, if you're wondering why there are horns played in the song, becuz this genre is ska + punk [=Skunk!].. and ska songs have horns played in the song.

       Mosh, mosh!  read carefully: says "mosh" not "moshi", I'm no jap freak, thank you very mush! Damnit, I spelt mush instead of "much".  ^^This my fren, proves how often I go off track.  Neways, back to what I was planning to say. Tommorow, as you conformed S'poreans know, is my school's pre ND[National Day] celebration. Wait, let me correct that, as you conformed Chung Cheng-ians should know.   Last year, towards the end, everything was so chaotic and just outta the world, we had so much fun, hands on shoulder, just running about in groups. There were some moshing as the aforementioned leader of  the groups  kept sudden-breakin. We kept banging into one another.  Ahhh....The fun of self-inflicting pain.... ________________________________________________  Mosh me! ohfreak [dot] blogspot [dot] com

      From The Northwest Herald    Tom DeLonge     IN CONCERT What: No Doubt and blink 182 When: 6:30 p.m. Sunday Where: Tweeter Center, 19100 S. Ridgeland Ave., Tinley Park Information: (312) 559-1212  Some celebrities get so tough and hard when it comes to interviews. Given they probably have earned enough cred to do so, but it is still refreshing to get a laid-back big-timer who isn't full of himself. Lucky for me, I got to interview Tom DeLonge, singer/guitarist for super punk band blink-182, a relaxed stud who has developed as a musical God in the intricate workings of my head. Enjoy!   What's up Tom?  Hey, what's going on?   How are you doing?   I am doing, um, well. How are you doing?   I am good. I am kind of excited to interview you because you guys are like one of my favorite bands.  Oh, wow. Well, thank you. How did we get that spot on your roster?   I don't know, I have just loved you guys since you first started. It kind of makes me a little more nervous to interview you than some of the other hot shot celebs I have talked to.   Don't worry, I am nervous, too. I always do so bad at interviews.   Let's just have fun with it then.   Yeah, let's just have fun with it dude.   How much does it suck having to be interviewed so many times in a day?   It doesn't suck actually, I don't have to do that many. They never set up too many at once for me.   How many do you have to do in a day?   35,000. (Laughs)   That's a lot. Good luck with that. Hey, what's my age again?   Um, what's your age again?   Yeah, I forgot.   Mine or yours?   No, what's mine?   You are 23.   Oh, very good. That's impressive.   Are you really 23?   Yes I am.   Oh wow. (Laughs)   Are you stalking me?   Um, no. (Laughs)   How cool is it to be in blink-182?   That's a good question. It is pretty cool. It has its ups and downs, but it's great to be in a band with great music. But it's hard to be used as a piece of meat all day long by the media.   Do you ever look in the mirror and go, "holy [bleeeeeep], I'm famous?"   No, no, I look in the mirror and go, 'holy [bleeeeeep], I need to stop eating.'   You're getting fat?   No, um, um, yeah. (Laughs) I am getting super, super fat. So fat that I can't even fit on stage anymore.   That sucks.   Yeah, you're telling me. (Laughs)   You're the leader of the band.   Not necessarily the leader, but definitely the good looking one. In some parts of the country at least.   Is that helping you with the ladies?  No, but definitely with the men.   That's what I want to hear. Your milkshake can bring me to your yard. Hey, what if you left blink and became a white rapper, what would your name be?   If I were a white rapper my name would be Slurpie. It's like a new and improved ice.   Are you a Slurpie guy?   No. I am a water or wine guy. I don't really drink Slurpies.   How hot is Gwen [Stefani]? Is she a perfect 10?   Oh, she's up there. If not, close.   I heard you hooked up with her. Is that true?   Yeah, right. (Laughs)   Don't lie to me!   (Laughs) I would have to if I went along with your story.   Come on, can't you hook a brotha up with a headline?   Your headline – you can make up anything you want besides that one.   We have gotten along, so I have to ask if I can be your friend?   It just depends. There is a waiting list.   How far down am I?   You are um, No. 1. There actually isn't anyone on the list. (Laughs)   (Laughs) That's good. Maybe I can sneak in soon. Jim Breuer created a great voicemail message for me, and obviously you are cooler than Jim, so will you do one for me?   Alright. (Laughs) 'Hey, this is Tom from blink 182, and you have reached Nick's phone, and he is one of my best friends in the whole world. Often we kiss, but when we are not kissing he will return calls just like this.'   bold --interviewer normal--mr. t delonge

       Pointless post no. 2  Alright, this isn't pointless.  My alarm rang this morning and as usual, I pressed "snooze". Dont scold me for being lazy, its a rainy day today.. cool day to hang inside and sleep  Snooze: If you don't have NOKIA phones and you're apparently ignorant, "snooze" is a button on the phone [when your alarm rings] to delay the ringing about 10 mins later. Must add that its a good invention for folks like me. He. He.   It's a complete torture to know that you have to wake up [and go to school] during rainy days when your bed is so.... soo.... cosyyyyy.... Many of us should have that experience, and as my mom always say, "Best days to sleep indoors are rainy days."  It's a frickin' fact.  CCH should set a rule that we are allowed to go to school late on rainy days. But with ppl like YUE around, its an impossible target unless you stick another penis into his own. Or maybe two.   I know what you're thinkin': EEEEWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!  I would kill myself if I had to see something like that, be it YUE or not.  God I love rainy days. _____________________________________________________________________  may it rain in your world. ohfreak [dot] blogspot [dot] com
