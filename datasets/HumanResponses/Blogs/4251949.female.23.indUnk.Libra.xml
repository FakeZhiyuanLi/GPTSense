      Damn that's a selfish title for today. Lately I've been feeling like that though. Kind of selfish. I hate when I get into that mode. It knocks everything kind of off balance and life doesn't run as smoothly. As I predicted Jeff and I accomplished nothing yesterday that I was thinking we would. Today I did manage to get out a good workout on the punching bag. So perhaps I have managed to motivate that area of my life. I've been working on translating a dream for Jeff which has turned out more difficult than I had anticipated. I've taken into account the fact that he's deploying for Iraq this fall but even then he doesn't seem satisfied with the interpretation I gave him. His dream started out with my mom sitting next to him in the Explorer. After some time he goes to a large tower that is bridged over a body water, like a river. When he was on the outside of the tower there were several men painting this large metal tower white. He tried to ask them where there was boss was but they responded to every question with "I don't know." When he is in the tower he keeps running into these people who are apparently robots. They bring up pistols to shoot him but he manages to shoot them before hand and take their weapon to kill the next one he comes upon. He believes they are robots because they are so difficult to kill. Finally he gets to the last guy and he can't kill with a mear gun. Somehow or another we manages to get a large knife and he's trying to slice away at the guys neck, but the man's neck seems to be metal. Finally the skin breaks, but the skin on this large guy is totally wrong. It's elastic like rubberbands. When the rubberband like skin breaks away large cables start to go crazy, with Jeff splicing at them. Then the cables become snakes. Crazy eh? Well, that's the end to that part. After that he sitting back n our house and he is watching a tv commercial for a movie that has all the parts of the dream he just had. From there we decide to take our oldest son shoe shopping at the mall. We are in the mall and a midget homeless person is trying to play with Thomas. Thomas gives him some pennies or something and Jeff goes nutts. He said he grabbed Thomas and kicked the midget in the head! lol...there are more parts to this dream but I think I'll stop there. I just looked back at this and can't believe what a large post I've written simply about this dream. In the end my interpretation is that he is worried about going to Iraq and leaving his family here, and he's worried about not reenlisting in the army...he may be concerned with not being able to find another job. ok...so here's the food for thought today again thanks to MindRealm for allowing me to post this:      Why is it that we believe we are finished even before our time is up? Why is it that even when we know that we're capable of more, if not much more, that we feel we're done and shouldn't go any further? Why is it that when there is no obstacle we feel the need to create one?           I'm not going to write my answer here...or MindRealms answer...perhaps someone else has an insight they would like to comment with or perhaps I will simply look back on this and have another view upon it.

      Jeff, my husband, came home last night which made my day. He was supposed to be working until late tonight but they let the guys come home early which was very awesome. We're supposed to be doing the mundane things today to prepare for his deployment like getting a will done, a passport for me, making sure his insurance is set up correctly, etc. I doubt we'll accomplish much though ;). I would like to start writing more in the book I started. So far I only have the first chapter and I'm worried that those first few paragraphs are simply boring. Jeff has started his own novel now and he wants me to help him which I think is awesome. After I read what he's written I think he has great potential. His writing actually made me cry. I'm going to try to include some food for thought each day. MindRealm has helped me a lot in helping me to think of things in a different way and I would like to say thank you to him again for that.  I am a huge fan of Anne Rice books as anybody that knows me would tell you. I have almost every one of her novels and have read any forum that includes her name. Her first big novel "Interview With the Vampire" was written after her 6 yr old daughter passed away due to leukemia. Somehow or another this tragedy brought a huge change to Anne. She managed to become one of the great novelists of our time. And though she writes on the subject of vampires, witches, and demons...she is a devout catholic. How amazing is that. She is truly my idol. And we just happen to share the same sun, moon, and mercury:). So anyways...the point I'm trying to make is this:  Why is it that for so many people it takes a tragedy to allow an amazing talent like hers to come forth and bloom? Could it be just curtain rising after the period of anguish and depression that follows the tragedy? or might it be a bit deeper or even more simple than that?
