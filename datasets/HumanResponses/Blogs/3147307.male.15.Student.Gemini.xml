      i'm running for office! (at my school, that is, for sophomore class secretary) Since applications were due today, I got a form and found 25 people for signatures (suprisingly! jk). I think I might be running unopposed. I was going to run for class president, but then realized that two popular girls were running for that position, and I have no chance. I now have to make a campaign speech!! Hart for Secretary!!!

      This crazy college student is excersicing his American right to be stupid in this article  urlLink here . He claims Pat Tillman is somehow not a hero! Also, about the test, the English part was extremely hard (I had to know the meanings of words such as malleable, loquacious, cannily, waspish, fenagled, etc. The Social Studies part was pretty easy. Now I have to test again in a week on my reading comprehension. Fun stuff.

      i have to take a test tomorrow over everything. It will test my intelligence to see if I can stay in the IDEA (the extremely smart people program) program at our school. I was accepted for next year, but would have had to fill out an application every year. This tests waves those applications. Patrick took it going into 9th and they asked questions such as Who was Charlemagne? What country did Columbus sail from? The problems like a this word is to this word as that word is to that word type, etc. It sounds kind of like the PSAT or something. However, its all verbal!!! You might pray for me that I would do well.

      I had to walk home from school in the rain today! (actually, it was kinda refreshing) I also wrote a poem during school (although it should've been HW) and had to do a calligraphy poster with the poem in art class. How stupid is this: A poem is a set of words It can be quite absurd It might make no sense It could be scary and tense And many times A poem rhymes And tells a story  A poem can tell about the past Or it could talk of breakfast Anything the writer wants Can be written down at once And many times A poem rhymes And tells a story

      it dawned on me this afternoon, I play more hours of basketball then I sleep. Today was the classic example (not that it is healthy) 12am-4 sleep; 4-5 get ready; 5-7 weights and bball; 7-2:30 school; 3-5 pick-up bball; 5-6 Internet, HW; 6-8 bball practice; 8-10 more HW; 10-12 sleep. I think that's a little crazy.

      I was doing the clock for a bball tourney at Perry and was paid $10. However, 30 minutes later one of our coaches told me 2 teams withdrew and Perry didn't have enough cash - so I had to give the money back! I got a shirt, though. (I could sell it :)    )

      Its the weekend! I have to work over the weekend however :( (But tis basketball related so :)   ).  I just got the first rough draft of the screenplay of our movie and we have an earthquake in it! I think that it is quite impossible to film that. Our budget is only like $15,000,000 minus $14,999,999.

      Tonite is the big night for the Pacers. Win and they even the series 2-2 and regain home-court advantage. Lose and they would then be one loss away from elimination. I'm going over to my grandparents house for the 4th time to watch the game, because it is on ESPN. Go Pacers!

      Well, I have quit playing basketball at Perry. I didn't think I ever would, but I have come to the conclusion that basketball takes too much time away from more important things. And we have practices year round. I would have been like the last man off the bench, and I didn't want to get up at 4:30 every morning in the summer to do that. The only thing I wish could have happened in my basketball career was to have a winning season. I have played on a losing team since 6th grade (Bulldogs, Wildcats, and Perry combined record: 23 wins, 71 losses) I'll never not enjoy basketball, but I can't waste my time on something like this.

      I'm in a posting frenzy. Anyways, Reggie might play in the Olympic games. He said he wasn't sure if he wanted to. It would be cool if he did, but he is worried about injury (he was injured in the 2002 World Champs here in Indy) and security (he is a millionaire and doesn't need to waste his time, played in the '96 games and '00 games, so it isn't new for him).

      I just played 18 holes of golf. I did OK. Shot an 81. My 1st shot went 10 feet - that's cause I haven't played for a couple of months. On hole 4, I hit a 25 foot putt for bogey. Then on hole 5, I nailed the green (167 yd hole) and parred (3) the hole. Another par (3) on hole 6. On hole 15, I hit a beauty. 115 yds, across a creek, and 10 feet to the hole. My birdie putt rimmed out and I tapped it in for 3. I beat Joel by 16 strokes.

      In what movie can you find Farbucks, Pork Illustrated - swimsuit edition, Old Knavery, the Keebler factory and spoofs of such classics as Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, Mission Impossible, Zorro and Ghostbusters? Along with spoofs of like any Disney animated movie ever? Tis all in Shrek 2 - a great sequel. I just saw it tonight! From the movie (roughly) - when Pinocchio needed to lie so his nose would lenghten: Shrek: Lie! Donkey: Just lie! Others: Lie, Pinocchio! Pinocchio: What should I say? Donkey: Just say you're wearing ladies underwear! Donkey: I'm wearing ladies underwear!! (nose does not grow any bigger)

      Nearing a church during his daily walk, a young man saw that a shubbery was on fire.  He banged on the church door and told the woman who opened it she'd better call the fire department.     She ran to the phone to place the call. She identified herself, gave the location, and explained the situation.     "You mean to tell me," said the emergency dispatcher, "that there's a burning bush on the church lawn, and you want us to put it out?!?"     BTW, 6 books have yet to be found in the story posted below. The ones that have been found are (and the context they were in): Mark (remark) Luke (lulu. Kept) Revelation (a revelation) James (a jam, especially) Ruth (truth) Numbers (to numbers) Job (real job) Judges (require judges) Lamentations (loud lamentations) (I,II) Peter (compete.

      12 down, 4 to go! Come on finish it off!       I once made a re MARK  about the hidden books of the Bible. It was a lu L  U. KE pt people looking so hard for f ACTS  and others it was a  REVELATION . Some were in a  JAM, ES pecially since the names of the books were not capitalized, but the t RUTH  finally struck to  NUMBERS  of readers. To others, it was a real  JOB . We want it to be a most fascinating few moments for you. Yes, there will be some really easy ones to spot. Others may require  JUDGES  to help them.     I will quickly admit it usuallly takes a minister to find one of them, and there will be loud  LAMENTATIONS  when it is found. A little old lady says s HE   BREWS  a cup of tea, so she could concentrate better. See how well you can com PETE .  R elax now for there are sixteen names of books of the Bible in this story.  Enjoy! (post a few at a time if you can't find them all)

      I demand a recount. I lost in my bid for Sophomore class secratary. :(  One of Patrick's friends was helping to count the ballots in 3rd period (remember, we only have 4 periods a day) and I was in the lead. But my opponent, last year's class president passed me somehow. It so ticks me off. Its a popularity contest thats all. To prove that, the vice-president had made a campaign speech that wasn't approved and so they showed a picture of her on announcements and she still beat out her opponent because she is popular. I still might ask how close the race was!

I have to deliver the Spotlight later this afternoon, and then I have basketball practice after that at 6:30. Wow! But then I have nothing the rest of the week (cept school).

      again i am posting after watching Letterman. This time he had Keira Knightley from King Arthur and Pirates of the Carribean. She explained why her costume is so, well, not much of a costume - you don't want to know why. I also watched Hithcock's  North By Northwest  - one of the most famous scenes in that movie is filmed in Indiana. Anyways it was a good suspenseful movie, but some of the green screen working was very outdated. Since I watch many movies I think I'll start a rating system. **** - Must see. *** - Good. ** - some may enjoy it. * - why would you watch it?. OK, North by Northwest gets a **1/2 star rating in my book.  Life is Beauiful , on the other hand, **** - you MUST see it.

      Wow! Busy day. First I ran in the Carefree Crocodiles 5k. I did awful. First mile was 6:20 - good pace (my goal was sub-20:00). I finished though at 21:45 - a 7:00 flat pace. ughhh. Came in 29th! that's pathetic. Then we did our first filming day. I would call it a half success. On the bright side - we actually started!! On the down side - we got about 2 minutes worth of good footage. But next time we will do better - especially if more people come.

Got it in today by 43 minutes. Busy day tomorrow. I run in my first 5k of the year at 8. I'm hoping to crack 20:30. And then the movie - but the rumor is Joe's gonna be a no-show! How can that be?

      I'm at my grandparents house just to watch the NBA draft. There have been 15 picks and 5 of them are high schoolers. Just think - these guys are 18 years old (think Ross, Rory, Isaac, etc) and have BMWs, Hummers, multi-million shoe endorsements, and their own contract (a guaranteed 5-year deal with over something like $5 million or more a year!). Many "old-schoolers" don't like the high school players getting drafted (some have utterly failed in the NBA and now don't have a life at all - one guy (Leon Smith) attempted suicide) but many are succesful (Kobe, T-Mac, JO, and KG to name a few) and I think it is a good system - I mean, their job is to play basketball and they do it with the best of them. Oh, and I think the top two picks (Dwight Howard, a high schooler; and Emeka Okafor - a UConn grad w/ a 3.8 GPA) are both Christians. Like anybody that reads this cares.

      Nothing exciting to add here. Allen is coming over after YG.

      Haven't updated today...(dramatic note)...until now. Anyways, lets see, I ran 5 miles today, I played 18 holes of golf (not great score of 84 - that's a 4.6 stroke average or almost double bogey every hole - I did hit the green twice on my first shot but three-putted and two-putted the holes so no birdies today), ate at Taco Bell (next to the golf course), came home, started to read the newspaper, fell asleep on the hard floor (I'm not quite sure how that happened) and woke up around 5. Now I'm here (aren't you so glad?)

      I watched an average movie and an amazing movie last night. First,  Welcome to Mooseport  wasn't very funny - interesting story, but not enough laughs to be good. But then I watched  The Pelican Brief  - tis a great movie. It stars Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington and is based on a John Grisham novel about two Supreme Court justices being assasinated and Darby Shaw (Roberts) inadvertently gets stuck in the terrible situation. Great movie, except for the fact that it ends the same way Grisham's other movies end (The Client and The Firm).

Josh M had a great introduction to films in that some Chirstians are culturally anorexic (avoid culture) or cultarally gluttons (don't stop to think about culture). We need to find a good balance. After the movie, we had a good discussion about the character contrasts between Abraham and Liddell. Fun stuff! "I believe God made me for a purpose. He also made me fast.

I hate it  that while watching Reagan's funeral procession the commentators keep bringing up what critics thought.

Who points out personal bad opinions during a funeral? Would they point out Bill Clinton's faults/criticism at his funeral? and Dan Rather on CBS kept right on talking while they were praying. Had it been a Muslim prayer (prayer? that's what they call it right?) or other religion he would have paused while they did, but...

      Well, after acting like an idiot on the gold course, I had the best score of the YG! I apologize to anyone who saw me getting upset, etc. - if you didn't you're lucky) I shot a 52. Then I hit a few balls on the driving range. The rented clubs were the worst I've ever used. It took me 2 or 3 shots just to get the ball past the 100 yd sign. I had a few good shots though.

      S&P was a lot of fun. I feel sorry for those who don't come! There were only 4 of us there (Joe, Rebekah, Ellen, and myself) and I'm not sure what makes it fun, but it just is fun. We talked about "the stuff of life," the pastor's sermon, and how we should not worry. Phillipians 4: 6-7 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

      I'm getting ready to ride my bike to church for S&P. I have to cross Meridian St. kinda nervous. This is the first time I've ridden to church before. And the first time I have crossed Meridian on a bike. I've ran across it though.

      Summer activities at church start tomorrow with S&P group. I'm looking forward to that - they are extremely fun. And then on Wednesday, I get to defend my YG miniature golf title at Rustic Gardens. last year I beat Josh M by 2 strokes with a 40 (don't ask me why I remembered my score!)

      I had a fun bike ride, but someone else had a bad (though not on a bike) ride today. I broke my personal best by riding 36 miles from home down to the Whitten's and making a big loop back. Smarty Jones was the one with a bad ride. He lost by a length to Birdstone in the Belmont Stakes. That makes 6 horses now in the last 8 years to win races 1 (Kentucky Derby) and 2 (Preakness) but not win the Belmont and the prestigous Triple Crown. I really want to see a horse win the Triple Crown - you should have seen how nervous I was before the race started. Ughhhhhh! Last time a horse has won the triple crown was in 1977!

      I've started running cross country at school (all I need to do is to start swimming and I can be a tri-athelete: running, cycling, swimming). It's a lot of fun. I had my best run this morning. I did 3.5 miles in 24 min. not great, but I'll get better. And then after running, our team played ultimate frisbee with Southport and got stomped 23-0. We'll beat 'em next week.

      Well, I'm going to take the initiative and post (unlike anyone I have a link to, though Katie has been on). Anyhows, I played golf today - shot an 80. I had my best shot in my life - hole #5 167 yds (501 ft), used a 5 iron, shot it way in the air, the ball bounced next to the green, creeped up next to the hole...and stopped 1 foot short of the hole. I tapped it in for a birdie 2. After golf, I got XC shoes and start running XC for Perry tomorrow. Oh, a story to tell...There is a Catholic church her in Indy that has set up a gambling scheme...with the offering plate! One of Dad's co-workers goes to that church. The co-worker said you put a set amount ($5) in a special red envelope. Place it in the plate when it is passed around. When they are done collecting, they draw one of the red envelopes out and if it is yours, you win half the money in the plate. That's crazy!

      Yesterday, I was in a counseling group and playing I Never, sleeping in a Calvin dorm, packing up at Calvin, eating at Bob Evans, riding home, making pizza, and then I watched a movie and went to bed. What a change in a 24 hour period. And then Patrick about an hour after we got home from Calvin left to go to an overnight CYPU meeting at northside, and today went straight from the meeting to a robotics-sponsored car wash. He is sound asleep right now! I slept in till 12:15 today! Wow - haven't done that in years! Last night we watched  To End All Wars.  I'd give it ***1/2 stars. Great movie w/ obvious Christian themes. It is rated R for war violence and strong language. It is the same setting as  The Bridge on the River Kwai  except this is more the true story of what really happened. It's one of those movies you watch once because it is a good movie, but don't watch again because you'd rather not watch the gore (especially when you know that it really happened) again. On a lighter note, I can consider myself an international Bible quiz bowl champ (along w/ Joe, Allen, and Zach)  - lets forget the fact that I answered all my questions wrong in the final round.   A picture of us is on the front page of the  urlLink International Conference  home page (its one of me giving the wrong answer.)

      hey whazzup! I'm here in Grand Rapids Michigan on a sucky computer, but anyways, I've had lots of fun in the last few days. I'll just do a day-by-day analysis shall we say. ok. Wednesday: started on the most fun athletics-involved thing I've ever done in my whole life. I started the bike trip to Calvin.&nbsp;We made it to Kokomo the first day. Poor Jonny Sturmo hit a pedestrian on the monon trail. Old lady broke her arm! We stayed at the Kokomo RP church. Next day was to Nappanee.&nbsp; Coolest youth room Ive ever seen where we stayed at. You would have had to be there. yesterday, we went to Kalamazoo. and today made it to Calvin. I could go on, but there is other stuff to do here, so thats it for now.  "Duuuuuhhhhh....no." or other "duuuuuuhhhhh...whatever" from Nathan Dart about dumb things on the trip.

      Ok, I finally saw it. about 2 weeks late though. (Spiderman2 by the way) . WARNING I TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN"T SEEN IT STOP READING AND GO TO MY POST BELOW WHICH IS A GOOD POST.&nbsp; Ok, I didn't think there was a good climax. It was exciting and all that, but just as The Two Towers wasn't as "cool and new" this one seemed very similar to the first. and w/ the action climax being anti-climatic (Doc-Ock realizing he needed to stop) and the romantic climax weak - they should have tried to combine the two. My rating would be a **1/2 stars out of ****. Some parts were very enjoyable, though. Like I said earlier, it is very much like "Two Towers" in that it is the middle of a "trilogy," this movie just seemed like 2 hours with just the story carrying on leading to the next movie.

            Dude, I gotta figure this new blogger toolbar! I went on a fun bike ride today. Let's see, it was me, Joel, Dan, Jon, Joe, Charity, Maria, and Mary. We went to this really old general store (like 150 years old) and they also had really old food and drink. Mountain Dew's that had expired in December, brownies that expired in April, etc. Anyways, after that it was only me, Dan, Jon, and Joel that kept going. Lot of fun. But many,&nbsp; many extremely tough hills (one where you walk your bike up type). We ended up going like 37 miles.  Everywhere - Tim McGraw  "Saddam Captured; Colts make playoffs." Headlines from the newspaper at the general store.  "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." - 2 Corinthians 5:21 (one of many verses I need to memorize before Sunday)

      Yesterday, I made a run to Richard's (jk) and bought some bike supplies with some of my birthday money. Let's see, I got an air pump, tire levers, tube repair kit, leather cycling gloves, a seat bag, and cycling shorts. Today, a group of us are going on a 40 (38.9 to be exact) mile bike ride down to CG. I have it all planned out. But first today, I have drivers ed. ugh! I have to drive today, too - that starts in about 50 minutes. There was a great top 10 list on Letterman last night (warning: some are kinda crude): Top 10 ways to improve the baseball all-star game. 10. Replace "take me out to the ballgame" with 50 cent's "what up gangsta" 9. Just a thought, but when Saddam's soccer team lost, he'd execute 'em 8. Two words: monkey umpires 7. Losing players spend remainder of the year making seven bucks an hour 6. Nine starters, eight uniforms 5. Seventh inning players' wife-swap 4. One lucky ticket-holder gets to manage the Expos in 2005 3. Between innings, Pete Rose plays keno 2. Allow top hitters to use performance-enhancing supplements...oh wait, they already do that 1. Losing pitcher has to give rubdown to bud selig (baseball commisioner)

      Well, this is a first - I slept in, accidentally. and missed cross-country. so now I get to go to drivers ed first thing today. I really don't have much left in that class because yestarday I drove on the Interstate and took the Indiana Driver Manual test (it was so stupid because after you finished the test, the teacher gave us 5 minutes to look through the manual to correct a few of the wrong answers - and then I had the second highest score in the class, a 62/66. it's a pretty stupid class.) I have two more drive times (downtown and parking stuff) and four more class sessions (one on Monday cause of no class on the 5th) of videos and worksheets. OK, a bike ride for those going on the trip has been set for tomorrow (Thursday) at 2:00 at the church. We will plan to ride down to CG and the Whittens, etc. Last thing, does anyone watch/listen to the music that I link for songs of the day?  "Cleveland rocks!" - John Kerry on a clip from David Letterman's "John Kerry - LIE"   urlLink Vindicated - Dashboard Confessional  (Spiderman 2 theme - like Hero from Spiderman)  "Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth."

      Here's my second ten minute turn on the computer. I was very active today. In the morning I got in a 5 mile run - at one point being chased by a nice-sized dog. And then I went to Driver's Ed. boring like usual. and then at 4ish, I rode my bike for an hour and 45 minutes. Went up through Meridian Woods and then down to CGHS. and made a few loops and came back. And then took a ten minute break and ran to church for fun night. My legs went out though about half-way there and on Southport Rd., I developed two terrible cramps in my quads. Wasn't pretty. But I'm supposed to run two-a-days until school starts, so it was necessary.

      I feel much better about getting on today and I have only spent a few minutes on the computer. My fun thing for the day on this blog is this riddle: "Think of words ending in -gry. Angry and hungry are two of them. There are only three words in the English language. What is the third word? The word is something everyone uses every day. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is."

      I guess in the Bible Study that Josh M leads about Haggai a recurring theme is this found in chapter 1:7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Consider your ways!" and many at YG shared on how we waste time doing things (we all have them, we all know what they are, for each person they're different) that center around us, and we consider more than God many times. Sometimes these things can be good things used in the wrong way or for the wrong thing. Such as church where many times I find myself looking forward to going just to talk to friends. Or youth group, where instead of a time to grow in my faith, friendships, and have a good fun time I make it a self-centered time to try to act cool in front of people (many times looking stupid) and to see how much I can do that really I shouldn't do. I also find time to get on the computer, blog, watch TV, and play sports, but many days I just "can't seem to find time" for a quiet time, prayer, etc. So as school is around the corner (a month away), I want to consider my ways and I think one thing I can do is to limit my computer time so that I can't "not have time" for a quiet time, and to prepare for things such as Bible Bowl, school, bike trip, etc. I will still blog and comment on others, but hopefully can hold my time to under 20 minutes a day unless working on something important. Maybe you could pray for me that I could be able to consider my ways and to re-think my priorities in life. And maybe when I rethink my prioroties and go with that for awhile I'll have more time to have fun and I will be able to enjoy it more

      A change is going into my blog and such after this post so this will be one of my last fun one. I decided to post my 10 favorite things from YG camping trip.  10. Nathan Dart's shirt which said, "Don't be an a-- (it actually said it, and I would post it, but others mught not appreciate it, hence the two blanks), vote republican" - he had to turn it inside out though but got away with it for almost the whole day.  9. Staying at Bloomington RPC for the night on Friday cause of the rain.  8. The food. (twas oisome)  7. Seeing Maggie water skiing after one attempt.  6. Going down early to set up tents.  5. My rotation (others complained) I got lucky. 4 ski rotations and 1 1/4 land rotations.  4. The YG sharing time (I tried to share, but I started to stumble on my words and got jittery and then kinda mumbled what I was saying - kinda embaressing, but Kevin, Jenny, Ross, Rory, Katie, and Emily (among others) had great things to share.  3. A great 2-hour game of ultimate frisbee where 13 guys and girls played as hard as possible in the rain and humidity.  2. Getting up on the skis and being able to go until I got tired, instead of going till I wrecked. And I got out of the wake of the boat.  1. Seeing lightening 50ft away from the van on the way down. It blew up a transformer that I had been staring at - very startling! and the thing was it was sunny out so very unexpected.

      Ok, I re-did the rating scale and came up with this - 35% - frequency; 15% - balanced posts; 10% - template; Serious (stories, poems, Bible, politics, etc.) - 10%; Fun stuff and life - 10%; and then neatness, punctuation, writing quality, and post length each had 5% to equal 100 points. Here are the standings - if you want a detailed explanation of the rating for a specific blog just ask in the comments. Remember that frequency is only 35% so like Allen's blog didn't just get a 0. If I do this on a week by week basis he would've. Here goes: 16.  urlLink Ellen Edwards  10/100  15.  urlLink Ryan Cerbus  33/100  14.  urlLink Allen Blackwood  38/100  13.  urlLink Grace Hanson  39/100  12.  urlLink Christy Helweg  44/100  11.  urlLink Abby Elder  47/100  The Top 10!  10.  urlLink Mia Straw  49/100  9.  urlLink Eleni Elder  51/100  8.  urlLink Mary Ray  52/100  7.  urlLink Hannah Ray  58/100  6.  urlLink Rebekah Ray  62/100  5.  urlLink Charity Blackwood  62/100  4.  urlLink Patrick Blue  63/100  3.  urlLink Joe Ray  68/100  2.  urlLink Ashley Rusk  70/100  And the #1 blog from the Southside is...  1.  urlLink Katie Bussell  82/100  Remember just ask about different blogs and I'll tell you. and remember 62/100 (an F grade?) or whatever doesn't mean you have a bad blog my scale was harsh. I'd say anything above 60 is good.

      After a complaint from  urlLink Rebekah  about not getting on  urlLink David Pulliam's  Top 10 Blogs, I have decided to post my top 10 strictly kept to Southside members. After much searching and following links I have found 15 blogs from Southside and thus make up the nominees. They are myself, Hannah Ray, Joseph Ray, Rebekah Ray, Mary Ray, Allen Blackwood, Charity Blackwood, Katie Bussell, Abby Elder, Eleni Elder, Patrick Blue, Christy Helweg, Ryan Cerbus, Ashley Rusk, and Mia Straw. The way I will rate is on a 10-point scale. Frequency = 40%, Content = 50%, Neatness/Design/template = 10%. The content is based on length of posts, writing quality, and what is said (a good balance between fun and maybe some more quality stuff - bible verses, politics, poems, stories, quiet times, debatable stuff, etc.). That is the setup. The list will come soon.

      Our family has an extremely busy weekend, but I think I'll be able to avoid the whole thing. Today, I've got drivers ed, Spotlight, and then I'll go over to the Blackwoods possibly to help Allen on an ECHO movie. Mom and Patrick have to set up for a Robotics competition here in Indy. Mom's helping serve dinner to 1,200 people. Tommorow, I leave for the camping trip (that means I'll be out of the way) and the  urlLink robotics   urlLink competition  starts where Patrick is on the Perry team, Mom will be volunteering at t-shirt booths, serving dinner, etc. and Dad and Joel are helpers to pick up the balls that are in the competition. And then Saturday, the competition continues! There are 50 teams coming from all over the country! Patrick will be so busy that he is actually staying in a hotel here in Indy because it is close to the site of the competition. Here's a good knock-knock joke (it's really stupid): Knock, Knock Who's there? Goliath Goliath who? Goliath down and get some resteth. Did you here about the site  urlLink www.kerryedwards.com ? it was started a few years ago by a guy so that he could post a pic of his baby son. Now he plans to post his site on Ebay and he has had offers up to $30,000 (one Republican said he would outbid any democrat for the site)  "I never understood the idea of camping.

      Hey, help me out on the post below for fun. Come on! Anyways, I drove up from Bloomington today for Driver's Ed (see one drives down, the second drove through Bloomington, I got to drive back). Better than anything I've ever done in that class. I think I'm gonna resort back to old times: 104,400 seconds, 1740 minutes, 29 hours, 8 class sessions, 4 drive times, 8 days left of driver's ed. This week is moratorium week statewide for all IHSAA schools (a week off from any athletics...if you get caught - ouch!) so no running with the team this week (some time to ride my bike and to run on my own). And to catch up on Bible Bowl. After today, I will have had 4 hours of study this week. On another note, camping trip is coming up...I can't wait - like I said earlier, second best YG event (ski trip's better)!  "Drive carefully!

      I want to see who has seen what movies from the American Film Institute's Top 100 movies. Click  urlLink here  for the list. Either post the number of movies from the list you have seen or list the titles. You have to have watched the whole movie (doesn't count if you rented it but didn't watch it, watched 5 minutes of it on TV, etc.). I think between everyone we might have seen a big chunk of these movie classics. I'll start off, I have seen 17. They are: #2 Casablanca; #4 Gone With the Wind; #6 The Wizard of Oz; #11 It's a Wonderful Life; #13 The Bridge on the River Kwai; #15 Star Wars; #25 E.T. The Extra Terrestrial; #34 To Kill A Mockingbird; #40 North by Northwest; #42 Rear Window; #49 Snow White and the Seven Dwarves; #60 Raiders of the Lost Ark; #62 Tootsie; #71 Forrest Gump; #72 Ben-Hur; #78 Rocky; #86 Mutiny on the Bounty. How many of the other have you seen? Oh and by the way, I've seen the movies in which 11 of the top 100 songs are in, the movies in which 14 of the best 100 heroes & villains are in, 7 of the top 100 romantic movies, 14 of the top 100 thriller movies, and 7 of the top 100 comedies.

      I had fun at Zach's party last night. We was the volleyball champs! (not that anyone cares). Pastor Keddie preached his first 2 sermons on Sunday as our pastor - and then today we got the Crown & Covenant Publications Magazine and about 15 books in there for sale were written by him - I didn't realize how much he writes! I've been straying from quotes of the day, but I am now going to have a quote (on the funny side), song (any that strikes my liking at the particular moment of writing a post), and Bible verse of my choosing (maybe from a QT or something like that) daily.

      I watched  The Italian Job  last night (I had previously seen it). It is a good movie. Very entertaining. Some of it seems a little far-fetched (cars are always spotless, stuff like that). I'd give it *** out of 4. Everyone in the movie is a bad guy (they are all criminals), but you still like the "good" bad guys. Charlize Theron stars in the movie (she won best actress for Monster). On another note, we had Bible Bowl prep on Sunday and I really haven't studied that much. But i'm rededicating myself to studying. I already studied 1 hr, 45 mins today. I can't lose to the girls team. I also can't lose to my brothers. I don't care much if I get beat by a team that is obviously smarter than our group, but I am going to try my hardest to win it for our team.

      Dude, I'm at my grandparents house for their 50th anniversary party thing. Anyways, my grandma brought out a piece of cake she had saved from her wedding (remember wedding was in 1954!)! It had been wrapped in foil and left in a pantry! The cake, originally white, was rock-solid and brownish, black - kinda looked like salmon. Oh, on a sports note, the  urlLink Tour de Lance  jk. (France) started with the prologue. Lance Armstrong (he's shooting for his 6th win in a row - never done before!) placed 2nd in the prologue today. He did 3.8 miles in under 7 minutes. that's fast by the way!

      I am going to my granparents 50th anniversary "party," "celebration," whatever you call it. Mrs. Cavill is doing the catering. I'll be there all day. I have no clue what to wear (t-shirt and shorts - no; dress clothes?, nicer clothes?)

      back to cross-country tomorrow morning (a 2 day hiatus for driving)! I can't wait! Driving's fun but i'm in the car with 2 others and we each drive for 50 minutes, so for an hour and a half I do nothing. Josh and Luke could pass the classroom portion if they did the homework. tis very ridikilis. cept today we watched high-speed chases for the last 10 or so minutes of class. they are purty cool especially with drunk guys.

      This may seem very weird, but I wish that I was corn de-tassling. 'tis hard work but I would have been payed well this year and I think it is kinda enjoyable in a way. And it is a whole lot better than doing worksheets and watching stupid videos in Drivers Ed - which is why I can't work this year (and can't get a raise for next year!). I have to have 30 hours of classroom time over three weeks. Again me quitting the basketball team earlier would have made it possible because I would have signed up for the first session (I thought I would be going to that D-1 camp during the first session when I signed up). So that makes at least 2 things I could've done if I had quit basketball sooner (ECHO and corn de-tassling).

      Our family reached an important milestone yesterday in the Hart family history. Or not really, but anyways I'll start from the beginning. In 1995, Mom began reading  The Magicians Nephew  out loud on our vacation. Yesterday, Mom finished reading  The Last Battle  out loud to us (Mom read most of it on the way home from Calvin) - so after 9 years we finished C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. I would have finished long ago, but Mom never let us read the books on our own (she wanted to read them all to us). Normally, we'll start reading one of the books over vacation, come home, finish it and not start again till next year with the next one (thus taking a long time). To put it in perspective, I remember in '95 (I was 6!) when Mom finished the first chapter (all I remember was that it was very confusing) and then afterward hearing about Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing (that was a long time ago). It has seemed kinda childish the past few years but my younger brothers enjoyed it (more than I did). Anyways, I had a question about blogs - is this  urlLink blog  Allison Cavanaugh's? - I'm not sure. If so, she will be added to my links and top blog lists (which will be posted today - back to the normal schedule of every Friday). If you're reading this, sorry I don't have a song, quote, or verse ready at the moment (I might come back and edit those in later).

      So, I haven't had a decent post for a couple days now. Anyways, CC practice is in full swing now. We started Monday w/ a 2-mile time trial. Tuesday we ran 5 miles. Yesterday was cool. OK, it was lightning and thundering out and school rules say that you have to wait 15 minutes after lightning is seen to run outside. So, we went upstairs and ran through the halls of the school. We were allowed to go wherever we wanted for 20 minutes. It was short but killed the legs because the floor is not easy to run on. And today we did a speed/hill workout at Glenns Valley Nature Park and that ended up to be about 5.5 miles in total. It's a lot of fun. Our first meet is the 19th. and my goal for the season is a sub-20 5k. I'll post my times here each time I run to track my improvement (or hopeful improvement). In the one summer race I did, I ran a dissapointing 21:45. Heya were getting close to Saturday and I have no clue what is going on w/ Bible Bowl party. Oh and does anyone know when and where movie night is this week?  Where are we Runnin? - Lenny Kravitz  "Stadiums have spectators. We runners have nature and that is much better." - Juha Vaatainen  "Therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us." - Hebrews 12:1

       Heya when's  this Bible Bowl party thingy? (actually the purpose of this post is to give a place to discuss time and place.) Friday evening is out for me (movie night) - anything else works for us Harts. Since nothing exciting happened big today this'll be my post of the day.   urlLink So Cold - Breaking Benjamin  - watch the music video  in its entirety  and tell me what you think! its interesting. Come on - especially if you have DSL or cable it'll only take like 5 minutes of your time and its a very interesting video.  Marge: Homer, the plant called. They said if you don't show up tomorrow, don't bother showing up on Monday. Homer: Woohoo, four-day weekend.  And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place. Genesis 2:21 (I won't have a verse tomorrow for the Other Twenty-Three  I'm on a creepy theme today.  urlLink here's a story by famous short story writer Shirley Jackson  - I ask you to take your time to read this as well. it's a weird story. comment about it as well. Most high schoolers read this for school before they graduate.

      I had a whole post written out, and Joel just walks up and shuts our modem off. So I start over now. That pic below is part of the next ride I am going to do. It is called the  urlLink Hilly Hundred  and it is a 50 mile a day weekend bike trip in the hills of southern Indiana. The hills are steeper than most in the Rocky Mountains - they are just not quite so tall. Our ride to Michigan was very, very flat in comparison. I've been down there twice for the ride, but have never actually done it. It's kinda a Hart thing to go down there. At least one, and up to 15 Harts have been down there every year for 30 years. One interesting story (i'm bored by the way) from the Hilly in '98 (I was down there), Dad had just finished, and as he was walking away he was the only witness to see someone back their car over a cyclist who was laying down. The cyclist was severly injured and sued CIBA - 2 years later Dad got a phone call and had to go to court as a witness for the case. anyways thats the ride Im doing next. Anyone else wanna do it? Cross country practice officialy started today - we ran a 1-mile warmup, a 2-mile sprint, and then a 1-mile cool down. Today was the day we heard the speech from coach (no drinking, drugs, mooning others while running, etc.) - very boring.   urlLink Meant to Live - Switchfoot  - this is a rare exception, I generally don't like Switchfoot at all, and the song is stuck in my head thus becoming the song of the day.  "It's not me who can't keep a secret, it's the people I tell that can't." - Abraham Lincoln  "Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow." - Genesis 41:2
