       Well, things are all set for North Carolina...      Kids are getting real anxious. I can't blame them...I love to travel!      My sister is going to have Ed call me L8er tonight, so we can solidify our plans for tomorrow.   I think I am going to try to quit smoking while we are down there...Mom doesn't smoke and doesn't allow smoking in her home anyway...I just don't want to gain any more weight. I am still struggling to get rid of these extra pounds I have put on since Ed & I got married (2000). Hopefully it will work this time. I don't think I was prepared last time I quit. I wanted to, but not more than I wanted to smoke, I guess. Oh well, I'll give it another shot. It is easier when I am not around people who smoke, and none of Mom's friends do, so...      Well, wish us a good trip! More when I get back on the 22nd!

       Well, here it is...my first BLoG. Hmmm.      I always thought on-line journals were corny...but I guess this is the paradox of me.   One day I don't like something, then I give it further thought and change my mind...    Ed (my husband) is away at Annual Training for the National Guard. Which leaves me home alone with the kids. Only three, though, Josh went with Cari (my sister) to Indianapolis for a week before we go to North Carolina. We are leaving tomorrow, although my mom thinks we are leaving Friday...we are going to drive it straight through (It's only 16 hours! LoL) and surprise her on Friday.       We are going down to help with the turtle nests. I have done it for 3 years now, but this will be the first year for the kids. I really wish Ed could come....maybe next year when he has a vacation from work...      A little about me, I suppose...      I turned 36 on Saint Patrick's Day this year. (17th March) My favorite colors are   Pinks, Aqua, Blue, and LIME GREEN!     (  LoL) We just bought an old house in September...doesn't seem like we have been here for almost a year, but we have. It's WON-DER-FUL! Our old apartment was only 3 bedrooms, a livingroom, a bathroom and a kitchen. We have 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, and livingroom upstairs, a kitchen, livingroom, bathroom (I have my own! Ü),  my office and a master bedroom on the main floor, and in the basement will be Josh's room, we have Ed's office, and a laundry/pantry/tool area. This place is HUGE! Plus we have almost 2 acres of back yard...all within the limits of Michigan City.      My husband is a wonderful man whom I met at Karaoke night the 26th August 1998. Man can he sing! In 1999, we went down to Indianapolis with our good friends Teri & Randy so Ed could compete in the State Finals for Karaoke. He placed in the top 10 and we had a fabulous time! He always sings to me, dances with me in the livingroom and spoils me rotten whenever he can. Although he has a computer degree, right now he works at a factory in the shipping and receiving department. It pays the house payment and gives him time off on week-ends with us. His other "job" is with the Indiana Army National Guard. I'm not too thrilled, as I have always been a tree-hugging free spirit...but I support him and our troops. If it weren't for people like my husband, I wouldn't be able to practice my own religion and live freely as I do. Right now I won't comment on what is going on over-seas, as too much IS going on and it makes my heart ache.      My oldest son Josh, just turned 17 this summer. He is such a fun and handsome guy! It's true what they say...time flies...Josh is into skateboarding and school. He had a tough couple of years in Jr. High and I ended up sending him to live with my brother-in-law up in Michigan so Josh could get focused on the important stuff of school.  It worked, and he is home with us now. When we get back from North Carolina, he is going to get a part-time job, and he is looking into the Armed Forces to serve his country and help pay for future schooling. This summer he has spent time with my dad on his farm, took his baby brother Sam to a water park, hung out with friends, and of course visited Indianapolis with my sister.      Jake, turned 12 this summer also. He is a terrific baseball and soccer player, who is going to start Jr. High School this year. He is also interested in music, and wants to play the drums in band. He is really into collecting those Yu-Gi-Oh! cards and duelling with his friends.   This summer he has spent time on his grandpa's farm, visited my Brother-In-Law in Michigan, swam with his friends, and played little league baseball. He had the highest batting average for the league and played in the All-Star game. I am so proud of him. Jake shatters the illusion that jocks aren't smart as he is on the honor roll with his brothers and sister.      Cathryn (my Catibug) is 9. She will be 10 in October. She loves reading, writing letters to her friend in Florida, and my grandma. She is my only girl, so she tends to be a little prissy. But not too bad. She plays baseball and soccer with her brothers in our backyard, rides bikes, and talks on the phone with her friends.  She, too spent time at my dad's farm, went to summer camp, and visited my BIL in Michigan. She has really missed her Daddy while he has been gone, but she is holding up pretty well.      Then there is Sam. "Sam I Am", named for my favorite Dr. Suess book. He is 7, and will be 8 around Christmas. Sam loves to read, and although he just finished first grade, he is reading at third grade level. He too is a whiz at computers, and likes hanging out at  urlLink Coke Studios     like Cati & Jake. Sam visited a water park with his brother Josh this summer, went to summer camp, and visited my dad, but other than that, he has been home this summer riding his bike, playing computer games with me, and hanging out.      All the kids have their own computers, since that is Ed's specialty! There is roughly 8-10 computers and laptops in our home at any given time, as Ed works on them for other people and we each have our own. We all enjoy playing computer games and often have LAN parties with our neighbors and my sister's family.      My sister and her family, husband Chris, daughters Heather (12) and Lexi (6) , live a few blocks away from us. She hangs out a lot over here and the kids usually play real well with each other.    Chris is in the National Guard with Ed, and when they return from Annual Training, he begins working for the same factory. My sis and I will be convoying down to North Carolina together with all the kids...It is going to be quite an adventure! Ü      My sister just called, it has been arranged for us to go see the guys before we head out for North Carolina. I am so glad, I thought a month without seeing Ed would be no big deal, but I have really missed him. I guess they get some R&R tomorrow at 8:30 pm and since we were planning on leaving Thursday and our mom isn't expecting us until Friday night, we are going to make a pit stop at the post to see the guys before we go. She is staying close to the base, so she has been able to see the guys and get it all arranged. Way cool!      Well, I guess this is enough for now...I have a few things to get ready before tomorrow...we are already packed, but I need to gather up toiletries and a cooler for snacks. I'm sure I will check in later...
