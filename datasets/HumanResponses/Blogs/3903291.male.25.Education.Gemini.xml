       I'm going to be on some small islands for the next couple of weeks south of Singapore so I will be out of contact.  For more information see my last newsletter.  I'll be back August 4th.  Check back then, or shortly thereafter, for my trip experiences!

       I have helped many people recently because their computers are slowing down and they are getting more and more ads.  I'm going to tell you what I always tell them.  Internet Explorer (The big blue E you click on to start the "internet") is not secure and allows people to install  urlLink spyware and adware  programs on your computer without you even knowing about it.  Don't believe me?  Try this:  Download and run the following programs:  urlLink Ad-aware   urlLink Spybot: Search and Destroy   These programs will tell you how much bad software you already have installed.  It will also remove it for you.  Note that Norton, Macaffee and other Anti-Virus companies cannot block them because they aren't viruses.  How do you keep them from coming back?  You can keep running Ad-aware and Spybot and hope that stops the programs.  You can keep closing all thos annoying pop-up windows, or you can switch to Mozilla Firefox!  Why would you want to switch? 1. No more pop-ups 2. No more spyware and adware 3. No more Ads on websites 4. Less security holes 5. Tab browsing (realy cool, check it out) 6. Cooler webpages (standard support) 7. It's free  The Department of Homeland Security even is  urlLink recommending that people switch !  For more information on why you would want to switch,  urlLink Switch to Firefox

       Over the last several days our group that is going to the Sea Tribe Islands has been meeting almost every day.  It has been good to get people together again before the trip as we have been spread out for the last month or so around the world.  We have been finishing up details and plans and bonding as a team.  I'm going to send out a newsletter very soon to detail the trip and tell you how you can pray.

       I went out and played paintball with the middle school students who are studying english over the summer.  There were only two adults there, me being one of them.  I'm trying to learn to humble myself and not always have to win, to make it funner for those I play with.  I found this really difficult due to the fact that the other person has a high powered gun that really hurts when they shoot you.  I'd like to say I was able to take a shot for their enjoyment but I didn't.  We had a lot of fun and all the students were a little suprised at how hard it is and how much the balls hurt when they hit you.  The worst injuries were a bloody head (just slightly), a direct shot to the ear (one of the worst places to get hit) and a couple of neck shots.

       A good friend of mine from College was killed about a week ago in an accident on a lake. His catamaran hit a high power line and he was thrown into the water. Jonathan Barr was a exceptional man with tons of energy, a passion for life and an overwhelming love for God.  We will miss you Jon.    urlLink Site dedicated to Jon Barr

       It is good to think ahead though, especially when you are traveling internationally.  I am now booked on a flight to Dallas in December.  My family will be having a reunion this Christmas in Dallas.  We haven't really been together since my brother's wedding 3 years ago.  It will be good to spend some time together again.  My last two Christmasses were spent alone on a beach.  The first was in Bali 100 miles from the nearest person I knew and the last one was in Phi Phi Island in Thailand with 3 friends. Hopefully I'll have pictures from that trip up soon.  Anyways... It will be good to see the family for christmas again.  Here is the flight plan: December 18th, 6pm Jakarta->Singapore->Japan->Minneapolis->Dallas  Returning Jan 7 Dallas->Minneapolis->Japan->Singapore->Jakarta

       If you can read this than you can see my new site.  It is quite a bit better than the last one.  I have changed the entire look and feel, added daily news and comments (via blogger) and updated much of the information.  I have also gotten rid of a few sections that I don't think anyone ever looked at.  I still need to do a few more things to get it working.  I need to move it into my domain, write a couple more chapters in my autobiography and add some recent photo albums.  I'm going to keep this news site pretty up to date this time.  Last time it was too difficult to update regularly.  Much easier this time.

       There were a couple of  urlLink bombs  that went off yesterday in Bandung.  This has been a problem from time to time here but they are always pretty small and no one gets hurt.  I'm fine and everyone else is fine.  People say it was more smoke than anything.    When I go back to the US many people ask me about how dangerous it is here.  My response is usually that it is not more dangerous than living in many other places.  The vast majority of the people here are very friendly and helpful.  There are a handful of people that want to hurt others but that is true anywhere you are.  Here they don't really target westerners since there are so few in the city.  Everyone who has visited has said they feel really safe while they are here.  All of the people in our neighborhood look after us and some became very upset when the Bali bombing happened and took it as their responsibility to guard us.  God can use any situation for good so I'm not worried about what will happen.  This doesn't mean I live reclessly but I don't have to worry.  For now...  still keeping my head down in faith.

       My old phone got stolen on a small ferry so I bought a new one.  It is a  urlLink Sony Ericsson T630 .  Pretty nice phone.  It has WAP internet (still don't have it working).  It also has bluetooth.  I bought a little USB bluetooth connector for my laptop but I have yet to get it working together.  All these cool bells and whistles have tons of potential but they are harder than heck to get working.  I'll keep putzing and see what happens.  Update:  I have Outlook Sync working now

       I had been planning a trip to Fordate island in Maluku this week but it has been cancelled.  I was going to visit my friends, the Marshall's.  In order to get there though I would have had to travel through Ambon which is restriced to travel.  I needed to get a Surat Jalan (Travel Certificate) from the police before I could go but I wasn't able to do that in time.  I'm still headed out on the BIC Youth Tour on the 23rd of July.

       Today is the last full day we have to prepare for the comming school year.  School starts on Wednesday and tomorrow is a national holiday (more on that tomorrow).  This has been a very good preparation period this year.  We have done TONS of planning and had a sponsored trip to the beach.  I still have lots of things to finish but I'm feeling very good about the coming school year.

       Today was a day for new things.  In the morning, a group of us guys went to a gym and I worked out for the first time since I quit football in High School.  I'm sure I will be sore for a few days.  The second new thing of the day is I played a round of golf, not mini-golf.  It took me a few holes to figure out how to hit the ball but I did get the hang of it by the 5th or 6th hole.  I even had 2 putts for par in the 9 holes we played.  One of them looped around the hole.  Grrr.  It was a lot of fun though.  I'm sure I will be sore the next few days though (more from the gym than the golf).  We'll see whether either of them stick.

       A friend brought me back some Reese's Pieces and Peanutbutter Cups.  I have been enjoying these immensely.  M&M has a factory around here somewhere so they are easily accessable but Reeses candy is impossible to find.  The other thing that is near impossible to find is Ranch Dressing.  One store even has Ranch free which is like Ranch only without the flavor.  You can get just about any other type of dressing, including Thousand Islands.  I believe that the dressing is named after an area of Indonesia name Pulau Seribu which means, Thousand Islands.  If you are wondering what everyone here craves, Reeses and Ranch.

       My roommate Matt recently got back from the US along with all the other teachers and unlike all the other teachers, he brought me an oleh-oleh (souvenier).  I now am the proud owner of a rubber ducky for my desk.  Why would this be a good souvenier?  It goes back to a book I read in one of my college classes that recommends rubber ducking when you are stuck on a problem.  Rubber ducking is explaining your problem to a rubber duck (the author had one, you don't have to use it).  In the process of explaining to it, you organize your thoughts and figure out the answer.  The rubber duck doesn't even have to answer to help you figure out the problem!  For those of you who are interested, the book is  urlLink The Pragmatic Programmer  which is full of other words of wisdom such as "Don't think outside the box, define the box."

       I just got my new laptop to go with my new phone.  It is a  urlLink Dell  Inspirion 1150 with internal wireless.  Anywhere on campus now I can access the network.  Combined with my new phone with bluetooth and GPRS I can also access the internet when I'm not at school.  Pretty cool but expensive.

        urlLink Starbucks  has finally come to Bandung!  After years of waiting and 3 months of delayed openings a Starbucks on Chiwalk opened on the 31st of July.  Finally, overpriced coffee that has been imported from the US, that was previously imported from our island.  I live on the island of Java which is where java (the coffee) got its name from.  There is plenty of good coffee around but none as expensive as Starbucks.  One of the most popular beans in the world is called cat poop coffee here (commonly called  urlLink kopi luwak ) since it is found in the poop of a small cat that likes the coffee beans.  Apparently they only like the really good ones so the beans in their poop are the best.  $300 per pound.  Of course I don't like coffee so all of this is a moot point to me.

       Most of the teachers at my school got back last night and we are going on a trip to Pangandaran today.  I'll be back on Monday.  The Sea Tour people had a party last night and watched the video from the trip, all 4 hours of it.  It was fun to relive funny parts of the trip even if the movie was a little long.  I hope to edit it up and post it on the website.
