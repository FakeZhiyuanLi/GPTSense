      People on Xanga are evil little bastards who never comment no matter how little of a life you have, and how much time you devote to leaving a bunch of people long, detailed comments.  What little punks.  Thus, the forces that make up Natrin have broken apart, never to return to the horrid world of Xanga again.  We wish you goodbye!

       Shoelaces:  Shit bitches!&nbsp; We look hella tight!  Tampon:  Fuck yeah you do!&nbsp; Orange and black-and-white checkered are sooooooo good!  Shoelaces:  Hey tampon?&nbsp; Shouldn't you be stuck up Erin?  Tampon:  I  should &nbsp;be because that ho is bleeding a goddamn river, but she feels that I may spontaneously combust inside her.&nbsp; She also fears that my string could be accidentally set on fire.  Shoelaces:  But you're nothing more than a 3-inch piece of lubricated plastic!&nbsp; Shit, even MacDougall's penis is bigger than that!  Tampon:  I wouldn't be so sure......  Shoelaces:  Hmmm, I suppose you're right.&nbsp; But your insertion would go so much more smoothly than the insertion of MacDougall's penis.&nbsp; The plastic applicators that come with tampons are much more comfortable than tweezers.  Tampon:  Anyways, I don't mind being unused all that much.&nbsp; I like chillin in Erin's backpack and peekin out to talk to you homies.  Shoelaces:  Awww, you're such a tightass tampon!&nbsp; Oh shit, watch out for that......   :::Technical difficulties.&nbsp; Please stand by:::

      - Erin can't handle change .  Neither can Natalie.  - Natalie can operate the blog, and she can spell .  Erin can't spell the word "operate," but she can LEARN to operate the blog.  - Erin takes forever to type .  Natalie can pull almost anything out of her ass.  - Natalie wants to hear Lea Salonga .  Erin semi-wants to hear her.  - Erin can take short showers .  Natalie  could  but usually chooses not to.  - Natalie is amusing .  Erin is bitter.  - Erin needs to get a life, not a blog .  Natalie needs to get life, not a blog.

      So.....blankets.....fuzzy, warm, cozy.  Just everything you could ask for in an oversized piece of cloth.  But have you ever gotten the feeling that your blanket was eating you alive?  So consumed in the illusion of warmth, when actually all the blanket is really doing is retaining the warmth you already possessed.  So when you think you're cold and search for a blanket to cuddle up in, deep down, you were already warm.  So does that make the blanket a savior then?  By showing you the warmth you never thought you had before are our blankets saviors?  I don't know, but I think I'm going to go rest now....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....Hey, where's my blanky?!!
