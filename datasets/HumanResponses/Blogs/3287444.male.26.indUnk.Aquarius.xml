      Which is nowhere near as good or profound as what MLK had, but here it is anyways.....  All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely Players; They have their Exits and their Entrances, And one man in his time playes many partsâ€¦ -- Shakespeare, As You Like It  A slightly different rendition of this, since I have also read Jonathan livingston seagull by Hesse and my brain is all confused....  We are all seagulls.....flying gracefully (or at least trying to) to our exits. Don't why there was an entrance, don't know why there is an exit and don't even know why we are gliding :( But everybody has this urge to fly higher. Find that perfect thermal and rise up the top at giddy speeds. Why we want to be at the top? Don't know. We think we will be happy there. Everybody up there looks happy!! Besides it looks nice up there! Feels nice to look up and see the blue sky. We look down and all we see is darkness. Don't want to go there! Do we now? Every now and then, along comes a seagull who just flaps his wing and rises up all by himself!!!! How does s/he do that? Why can't I do that? Can I follow this wonderous seagull? Can I keep up? I don't even know how to flap my wings! Can s/he teach me? But how can one teach you how to fly? :( You have learn it by yourself. It's so hard :( But...The sky's blue and it's a nice day, and my spirits are up :) Soon one day, I will join those high-flying seagulls too....

      That was the first thing officer Thomas said when she (yes "she" and she was a pretty "she".&nbsp; Pun intended) came to meet me outside the parking lot. How&nbsp;can it be when you've just realised that you have been robbed blind?   My R6 was stolen today :( I drove to work yesterday on my motorcycle and parked it in the basement of 410 Riverside Ct, CA 95054 :( Pad locked with the braided steel padlock I had and had the cycle cover on. I wear my commute jacket this morning stock up my helmet and gloves and go down only to find out that all that exists is a braided steel pad-lock professionally cut and sliced. No trace of the motorcycle exists anymore :( They took everything :( cover included. Mofos :(   And this when I had just started getting really excited about motorcycling. Had even signed up for the Keigwins@track 2 day novice school happening this thurs and fri :( Had to cancel all that. I have had motorcycles for three years now and I finally caved in and over the weekend bought the tank magnetic bag etc from Road Riders....   I should have wisened when they tried to break the lock of the R6 on two occasions at Elan, and moved into a place with a garage. Instead I go from the pan to the fire. All these complexes are touted as luxury, ultra safe crapholes. You move in there and get your ass robbed.   Anyways, called the police. Got a case number. Called the insurance got a claim number. All I have is numbers :( no motorcycle. Can't let the insurance rip me off. On the bright side tough, does this mean it is time to upgrade? :))   Philosophically, will we ever be able to establish a classless society as portrayed in one of my fravorite series "Star Trek"? Will we ever be able to establish a soceity based purely on job functions. A utopian world with plenty of everything for everybody? Or should the interpretation be that we eradicate the needs and wants from our minds and lead a monastic life?

      Even when they are talking about how they had a heart attack!! It's like    everyone had high doses of prosac and botox. It makes me ask: Is  happiness the only emotion that is desirable? why can't we sell anger or  sadness or humiliation or something? and make tons of money on it?  Anybody wants to comment?

      So Doom3 gets released, right? And all these blokes at gamespot and ebgames treat it like the next incarnation of Vishnu or something! You have to have stood in line some 10000 millenia before to get a copy. How stupid is that? Anyways...Fry's had some copies for lazy bums like myself who could just walk in and pick a copy. So I go on wednesday....  SALESDOOD: "Sorry all sold out. You can come in tommorow at 12:00 and try cause we are getting like a 100 copies or so"  Id makes us wait forever for this game. And still pulls off the dotcom crap on us!! What hype! Anyways, I figure the game is worth all this effort and coerce my buddy Manju to go pick it up from the Fry's on Arques yesterday. He goes through the pain and does that...I meet up with to pick up the game in the evening:  Manjo: Knock, knock Manju: Who's there.... Manjo: The dood who'll own your ass pretty soon....  Anyways. We cut the formalities and head to my place to try this on a machine. Athlon XP1800, 1 gig PC2100 RAM and Geforce 3. The rig sux ass, man!! We load up the game and go through the "windows needs to reboot crap" and start the game. I can only do the suckiest resolutions on the suckiest quality video :( And after playing for like 15 minutes, the card locks up or something. Everything on the screen is messed up. Though the sound is still alright, so I figure the OS is up and so is the game.  Manju: I think your vid card lost sync or something....  yeah.....or something....I think I am out of sync with the latest hardware to play this game. In conclusion though, given the right hardware the game promises to provide ample pleasure to those key nervous centers in the brain ;)
