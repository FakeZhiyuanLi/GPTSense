        Today is a great day for me and yesterday was amazing too! So here's the scoop...  Yesterday was tryouts for the school tennis team. I was so nervous that whole day since I had been gone alot all summer I hadn't had much time to practice so I was freaking out! Anyway so basically my day started off with a bunch of nerves, I tried to calm them by keeping myself busy doing chores and what not but that didn't really work, so I went online and looked up tips on how to play a better tennis match and stuff like that. Well as I was reading all of this information I came across a page that said something along the lines of "Is dehydration effecting your game?" So I read it and realized that it probably was, since the day before I had played tennis with my mom for an hour and hadn't had hardly any water at all that day **idiot**. So anyway I went and got my pink Starbucks water bottle (that I purchased in San Jose) and filled it with water, then I put it in the freezer and went out for a swim in the pool. Well it was a little too chilly for a swim so I came inside and did some streching excercises to loosen up before tryouts. That was pretty routine and sort of boring. Anyway after that my dad came to get me for tennis and I grabbed my racket, water bottle and purse then I headed out to the truck (nice truck, hell ya 2004 ford lariat 350 diesel, awesome!) So my dad drove me over to the school tennis courts and I was so nervous I was shaking, I asked my dad not to watch me because I get nervous when my parents watch me. Anyway yeah so I walked into the tennis courts and I knew a few of the girls so I socialized a bit, then we started warming up. Doing serves (my worst.) Then Coach Smith called all of us over to him to call out our names and ask us what we thought our level of ability was in terms of 1-10. I rated myself a 4. Haha. Anyway yeah, so then he matched us up with other girls in our ability range and we had to play them. Well I won my first game 6-2! It was awesome! So then he matched me up with another girl who had beat someone else and we played and I beat her 6-5! She was really nice though and tomorrow she has to do a match with another girl to see who gets the last spot on the team or something to that effect. Anyway yeah I walked over to Coach Smith and he told me I was on the team! Hurrah! I was so happy! Yeah so anyway I told my mom and my dad and they were really happy. Later that day (more like evening) my dad took my to get some school stuff then we went to Gart Sports and I got a cover for my racket, after that I went to another store and got a new shirt and some shorts and then my dad got some taco bell (bleh) and we talked for a little while. It was fun! Yeah so that was my great day! Today I have to go back to school to practice for the game we have next Tuesday! Insane...anyway yeah, I'm gonna get going now, see ya!!!!    Ciao, Danz

       I'm back from powell! It was pretty awesome, the lake has dropped quite a big since I was there last. I got a sort of tan, which is kinda cool since I was ghostly white before...I wakeboarded a lot which was fun...I love to do that. Snowboarding is still better though. Anyway when I get the pics off the digi cam I'll post them. But I need to go right now. Bye!

      That's me in the lovely Delta, Utah. I'm adorable...yeah right.  urlLink     urlLink   This picture was taken in Delta on my memorial day trip with my mom. It was fun I suppose, I really didn't want to take that picture but my mom said the flowers were "so beautiful" and that I had to kneel down by them...So I did. I like the pic though.

        So yeah I guess this is my first post ever on my new blog since my old one is being idiotic and won't let me sign in...Oh well. So I got back from nerd camp on Wednesday. I miss everyone! It was a great experience and I really enoyed it. Well for the most part. The stalker guys weren't that great and some of the seminars were kind of...not that exciting. I met so many cool people though. Larissa, Edd, John, Jamie, Matt, Eric, Chris, Amanda, Christian, Tanner, Jim and many more! They were all really awesome! Larissa (Lars, Lari) and Jamie were my roommates, they were both really great! Larissa and I hung out a lot and we had a little group that we mainly hung out with, it changed through out the ten days a bit but pretty much remained the same. Our first little group was basically Chris and Charlie, but Charlie got annoying and became one of out stalker guys and then Chris sort of started ignoring us...probably because we payed more attention to Edd. Anyway then we started hanging out with Edd and John who are just completely awesome! Then we had Eric, Matt and Christian hang out with us a few times, and they were all fantastic guys! We also hung out with Dan and Fred two more awesome dudes! Heh heh, all in all the trip was fantastic and I was sad to go home! I did get some totally rad pictures though! I think the group is gonna just trade a bunch of pics...at least I hope so. I really want to see the whole bunch of them again! They were all so wonderful!
