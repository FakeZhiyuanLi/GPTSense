      Let me preface this by saying that I don't generally ever decant wine that I serve at home. Why? I'm lazy, probably, and down enough on myself to think that wines that I buy aren't worth of decanting. But now I'll get up on my soapbox and lecture...  You should decant every still red wine you drink. Wait, are there sparkling red wines? Well, sort of. You may come across two kinds of "sparkling" red wines, three if you count rose champagne as red. On the bottom end is cheap, generally French, red wine that has some bubbles in it. This wine is probably fermenting in the bottle due to improper bottling and should be discarded. But some French red wines, and they're often not the type of French wine to garner the highest prices, will be slightly bubbly (almost like a Vouvray), due to intentional bottle fermentation. So there's a good potential for confusion there, which is why you should pour yourself a small taste just like the fancy wine guy at the restaurant. Look for bubbles; if they are there, don't decant. Take a taste, and if the wine is offensive, chuck it. Otherwise, serve that slightly bubbly red in a more tapered glass.  So back to decanting...  Go out and buy a decanter.  Doesn't have to be fancy.  I stole mine from my parents while they were paying attention to my  urlLink baby boy .  Parents are suckers for babies and you can grab whatever you want when their backs are turned.  Decanting serves a number of purposes. First, if done carefully, you can eliminate the gritty sediment from the drinking experience. Hold the bottle in front of a candle or light and stop pouring when you can see sediment hit the neck of the bottle.  Decanting also helps accelerate the breathing process. Most reds will definitely benefit from exposure to oxygen, revealing flavors and changing color to make the experience more pleasurable.  And when you pour from a decanter, you don't have to do that stupid bottle turn thing waiters do to make sure a drop doesn't run down the side of the bottle and stain that nice white tablecloth.  So decant your wine. Get some air in it and keep the nasty grit out of your glass. And if you do it around your friends, you'll seem pretty classy unless your decanter has "No Fat Chicks" etched on the side.  Anyone out there know where I can get a "No Fat Chicks" decanter?

      This is the first wine in a while that I've really enjoyed, so take any accolades with a grain of salt.  I also spent the afternoon describing to my wife, with tears in my eyes, how good my Dunkin' Donuts coffee tasted.  Beware.  This wine is a nice example of a Beaune wine.  A good garnet color and quite viscous.  It's pretty stick-to-your ribs for a Burgundy, but with so many flavors it comes across as subtle, almost misleading.  The most prominent taste is black cherry, but there are hints of strawberry and smoke.  A very extended finish, but a slight and somewhat unpleasant taste of copper in there somewhere.  Overall, very nice.  Subtle enough to be a little challenging, but it was kind of evasive so I feel a little annoyed by it.  I do have to say this one benefitted from an hour of breathing.  Next time I'd decant it and wait a little bit, as the first glass was kind of disappointing, but an hour later it really came to life.  The wine really held up, too.  I opened the bottle for a glass with dinner and ended up drinking the whole thing over the course of the evening, and it kept its end up as my palate tired out.  Do I have to do a rating?  Ok, let's say 7.5/10.  It didn't have enough "wow" to get higher than that, but it really did make me spend some serious time thinking about it which definitely earns points.

      So I had this nasty sinus thing for the last three weeks that made all wine taste like vinegar. Not that it stopped me from drinking wine, mind you; some of us really enjoy the taste of vinegar. I just didn't think anyone would appreciate reading about it.  I did have some noteworthy wines, though. There was a 2001 Domaine Bachelet Chassagne-Montrachet (served entirely inappropriately with fajitas, w00t) that I was told was excellent and a bottle of Two Brothers Big Tattoo Red from Chile (I can't remember the year) that was served entirely appropriately with fajitas that was full enough to come through my sinus problems and come across as a thoroughly pleasant wine.  The Chassagne-Monstrachet was expensive like one would expect it to be, but probably worth it if you like buying expensive white wines.  It might have been better appreciated had it been paired a little more carefully with the meal.  The Two Brothers wine is quite a deal.  Not only did the blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Merlot come with big, pleasant flavor even to my crippled senses, but also it's inexpensive at about $9 a bottle and the guys who make the wine donate some of the profits to breast cancer research.  Here's a  urlLink link  with some info about the wine.

         The first thing that struck me was the purple-ruby color.  A thin wine.  Most notable was the toast in the bouquet.  I don't often find wines with toasty aromas, so I was kind of excited to see what else the wine had to offer.  Once it hit the palate, though, this wine seemed less remarkable.  Despite a decently low alcohol content (12.5%), the taste was overwhelmingly alcoholic and tannic, masking anything else the wine might have.  I also found it very inconsistent on the tongue, which was kind of nice when the wine was mellow, slightly fruity, and dry, but not so nice when it was like taking a swig of Seabreeze astringent.  I also have to add, after panning the wine, that my wife loved it, and she's no wine slouch, so if you're feeling like a risk give it a try.  I guess that's what you get for buying $20 Pomerol.  My quest for a less expensive right bank Bordeaux continues.  Not that I'm actually on a quest.  Ok, this is the start of my quest for a less expensive right bank Bordeaux.  It's apparently 70% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 15% Cabernet Franc.  Also of interest, since I've run out of things to say about this rather mediocre wine, is that Chateau Ferrand was owned by the late Baron de Bich, the inventor the Bic pen and razor.

      Okay, the first post isn't about wine.  If that's not auspicious, I don't know from auspicious.  Enough people have asked me, so I'll share it: I had ice cream from this place 8 or 9 years ago.  I only ate there once, as I was only in Northampton for a day, and I still remember it as if it were burned into the ice-cream portion of my brain.  Bart's Home Made.  I only had the ginger ice cream.  I remember walking back to a Smith dorm with a gaggle of lesbians, eating my ginger ice cream and thinking that the world couldn't have been any better.  I don't remember any of the lesbians who were with me, except Mara, who I recently had a run-in with that involved a couple of bottles of wine (see, it's about wine after all), but I sure do remember that ginger ice cream.  The pleasant spicyness of the ginger, even in the coldness of the ice cream, made the walk through the cold, damp streets of Western Massachusetts in April barely tolerable.  How they ship ice cream via UPS I don't know, but I will soon find out.
