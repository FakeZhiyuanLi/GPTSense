      I just tryed to post on our site and really badly f**ked it up so I'm going to have to fix it later on anyway heres the newest post posted by me as Superguy hasn't yet signed up here.   &nbsp;   It has become clear that Tweak has made a mistake and forgotten to add the Tornado to the list of Aircraft in the Details page. How dare you forget this wonderfull aircraft Tweak! Shame on you...!  In other words, we will also be working on the RAF Tornado.  Or else.  -Superguy

      I decided to work on a building pack at the same time as my Harrier partly to keep interest up!!  Its the first part of the pack and it's a front office to be used in a military air field and expect other releases like it and a new release of it with improved textures and the Geometry LOD bug fixed!  View the readme for the latest info, I'm not going to post a screenshot as it isn't an amazing addon but I hope you use it. Hopefully screenshots of this, the Harrier progress and the refuel trolley will be posted up on  urlLink OFP.info  some time this week.  I have three links, a installer, RAR and ZIP, so you can choose the one you want, please be patient as I only have limited bandwidth.  Installer:  urlLink Download Here  ZIP:  urlLink Download Here  RAR:  urlLink Download Here    Counter for downloads:   urlLink Click Here   Enjoy!  -Tweak

      I forgot this, when I just posted so I'll post it now.  We have a Chat room up and running.  I guess you have heard of IRC chats if not here is a tutorial for setting up the right programme  For people who know IRC are IRC channel is #rafrn and it is hosted at abducted.us check  urlLink www.abducted.us  for their list of servers.   Tutorial  First of all download  urlLink X-Chat  and install it as the intructions tell you to. Then do the following: Under nicknames put YOUR NICK in the next box YOUR NICK_ and then in the next box YOUR NICK__ make sure  all  the underscores are on there.The username and realname can contain anything it doesn't matter. Make sure your Bar at the top when you start X-Chat says "X-Chat Server List" then click the checkbox next to "Edit Mode" Then under Networks click add new and double click slowly to change name, not to launch it, then change the name to Abduted. Then under servers click new and double click to change its name to irc.abducted.us. Under channels add in #rafrn and then click connect you should then be taken on to the IRC network. Then if you have not already done so type the following: /ns register PASSWORD YOUREMAIL then it will say you have been registered then send  urlLink email me  so he can add you to the Access List.  -Tweak

      I was bored so did a quick model to release to get some interest up!!  It's nothing special but is a refuel trolley to be used in a military air field and expect other releases like it.  View the readme for the latest info, I'm not going to post a screenshot as it isn't an amazing addon but I hope you use it.  It will be improved for a later release.  I have three links, a installer, RAR and ZIP, so you can choose the one you want, please be patient as I only have limited bandwidth.  Installer:  urlLink Download Here  ZIP:  urlLink Download Here  RAR:  urlLink Download Here    Counter for downloads:   urlLink Click Here   Enjoy!  -Tweak

      Good news!  Tweak has just started work on the model of the Harier Jump-Jet. More presicely, the RAF Harrier Gr7. I will soon be starting on the RAF Tornado myself. Stand by for more details as they come.  We are also looking for anyone who can model or texture.  -Superguy

      ***For Immediate Realease***  It has just been announced that we will start working on the Harrier jumpjet, so far we are waiting to see if the Falklands Mod will allow us to use their harrier and we will modify it, with full credit given.  More information will be posted by Superguy  -Tweak   Edit: Falklands have said we are not allowed to use their Harrier, as it is still in the Beta Stage, so I have started to create my own which will hopefully be as good, so expect some pictures soon!
