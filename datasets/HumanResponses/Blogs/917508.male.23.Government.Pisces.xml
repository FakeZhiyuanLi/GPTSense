      At  urlLink Sanctus 1  at the moment, we are looking at the various sacraments, and last night were discussing the issue of baptism.  Now, over the past few years I have moved from a former position of vehement anti-Anglicanism – as the Established Church, its hierarchical nature, the clerical authority – I have ended up feeling a closer affinity to the Anglo-Catholic tradition than anything else.  But for all that, there’s something about infant baptism which quite brings out the evangelical Protestant in me. For the life of me, I can’t see anything positive in it which you can’t find in a dedication service (i.e. the public commitment of the parents and the congregation). Beyond that, there just seems to be the remnants of very dodgy Augustinian theology about little chidders going to hell if they haven’t been baptised yet. Of course hardly any Anglicans – none I’ve met – really think this, but I’ve not yet been provided with a vaguely convincing explanation of why you need to baptise a baby rather than have a service of dedication for it.

      To get the ball rolling, I thought this long quote from the Anglo-Catholic socialist priest Kenneth Leech is useful (it's from a 1996 essay of his called 'The Rebel Church in the Back Streets - Where Are We Now?'). For the purposes of this blog, it is useful for two reasons:  It serves as a very lucid introduction to the position that I myself share with Leech (although I haven't always); and  It raises a major concern that I have about 'the Church' (in the broadest sense of the term).  To set the context - I have just returned from a wonderful week at the  urlLink Taizé community  in France. A major concern of the community, since it was set up decades ago by Brother Roger, is reconciliation and ecumenism. This is something that I fully support, but like Leech, I do wonder if there are limitations to this. [Stanley Evans, a former priest in the East End of London] identified the fundamental division within the Christian world as one which did not run along denominational lines but rather divided those Christians in all traditions who believed the Kingdom of God involved a hope for the transformation of this world and its structures, and those who did not . . .   We [the now-defunct  urlLink Jubilee Group ] see that the centre of gravity in the Christian world has shifted and that neither the divisions nor the areas of convergence/alliance between Christians any longer run along the old confessional lines. Thus we have found that on many issues we have more in common with the liberation thinkers in the Roman Church or with Mennonites or with the evangelical radicals from Sojourners -- or with non-Christians -- than we have with other Anglo-Catholics. So we are strongly committed to alliances including those with non-Christian socialists. We are uneasy at the 'churchy' aspects of much radical Christianity and are committed to our work outside the church structures. At the same time we feel that a deeply rooted Catholic theology and spirituality is essential to us for the sustenance and nourishment of radical action, and are highly critical of liberalism and of the theological reductionism in many 'liberal' Christian circles. We have a strong sacramental thrust and are very strongly socialist, so 'sacramental socialists' would be a good description of our position. This seems common sense to me. My worry is whether, as the 21st century, we as a 'faith community' can be brave enough to admit this division exists.

      I have actually  urlLink been blogging  since October 2002, but I have decided to create this second blog. Why? Simply because there is an increasing discussion going on online about the future of the Church in society, and of Christianity in general which I want to be part of (take a look at some of  urlLink these links  for starters).  However my existing blog has developed it's own character as a mixture of irreverent ranting and serious political debate between me and my (almost entirely atheist) friends. Although I certainly enjoy that and plan to keep it going, there are only so many "Isn't believing in God like believing in the tooth fairy?" discussions I can take before becoming bored, so I thought I'd move that part of the discussion over to here.
