						    I think the thing that fascinates me most about using Craigslist to find people worth hooking up with is that the process starts with words, and they can be any words. Its not as canned as other online dating sites (like Nerve) or psuedo-dating sites (like Friendster) - you can literally put anything out there, and see what comes back to you.       This means that I meet people who I might not meet otherwise - because typically I'm attracted to the type of person who doesn't prowl around in bars or and wouldn't daringly walk up to me and start talking. But I do love me some good writing, and thats where the trouble starts.      Last night I met up with a guy who fits this profile - good writer, witty and socially awkward. However, I knew immediately that there wasn't the same electricity as there was between me and my Thursday night date. So what to do?      We had some whiskey, which is always a good place to start. And the conversation was pretty smoking - as usual, once I mentioned that I work for a porn company, we were off and running. He seemed elated to be able to spill his perverted guts about what he watches and what he's into, which is always fun. After a while, he invited my back to his place. And... my curiosity got the better of me. So I went.      Once there, we pretty much got right to it, and it was a lot of fun. I knew from our conversation that he liked rough sex and that he's a switch, which is perfect. So there was lots of arm restraining, some choking, slapping and general mayhem on both our parts. And he was talented - he got me to squirt a bit and I coached him on fisting - and we really clicked. The whole evening kind of reopened my desire to fuck lots of people, you know, as research - just to see what makes them tick. And if they can make me tick.

						   I am frequently mocked by my friends for being the sweatiest person ever. It doesn't take much to get me going, especially in the summer, and its something that is irritating for almost all occassions - except fucking. There's something enormously sexy about some good, sweaty sex - a sweaty back, little drops of brow sweat dripping on my glasses and blurring my vision really make me happy. And last night, I got to have me some of that.  First of all, I just have to say that I love  urlLink Craigslist  Casual Encounters, through which I've consistently been able to meet fabulous sex partners. The guy I rendezvoused with last night was a CL find, naturally. Its funny because about two months ago I actually responded to a post of his and meeting up didn't happen because of annoying scheduling conflicts and then I was out of the country - but anyway, he responded to a post of mine and things worked out this time. The boy is fucking adorable, with the cutest dimples and a filthy mind. We did the standard meet-in-a-public place, some (very awesome) conversation and then back to my place. And we had a damn good time. I'm so fascinated by other people's bodies and their sexualities and what makes them tick and gets them off - especially when I get to experience that first hand. I'm also a big fan of men who can keep going forever and like seeing me get off - because I like to do that, as much coming as I can manage until I'm shaking so hard I can't stand up. So there was a healthy dose of that, plus he turned out to be a big enthusiast of one of my absolute favorite sex acts - the handjob (giving or receiving, I think handjobs are even better than toast and nutella).  I like meeting people because of sex and my desire to have it. That seems to be the best way for me to connect with people and get to know them - through fucking (plus there is the benefit of the sex itself). In the late spring I was dating a boy who I met through more innocent channels - and it just didn't work, despite the fact that he was brilliant, sexy and interesting. I like people to know I'm a sex-crazed pervert before we get anywhere, because the difficulty of coming out about that to dates is just... difficult.

						   This morning, I arrived at work to discover the following two items on my desk:  urlLink    The Fleshlight original "Pink Lady" (as compared to the glow-in-the-dark ass)  AND   urlLink    Sphincterine Asstringent - for a minty fresh ass  Our office manager has evidently been doing some housecleaning.  I am familiar with the Fleshlight and all its permutations - and actually gave one as a birthday present to a gentleman friend last year - but I am mesmerized by the Sphincterine. My initial reaction was one of shock and horror - not because someone would want to rub something on their asshole, but because I feared that it contained noxious chemicals. It turns out that unlike some other frightening sex aids (I'm mostly thinking of clit stimulator creams whose packaging warns against getting the stuff directly on your mucous membranes), the makers of this personal Asstringent (clever, eh?) are aware of the fact that aloe or alcohol on your tender bits is BAD. I am curious about the tingle, but I'm not sure that I need my ass to be minty tasting. If you ask me, the taste of a nice clean, au natural ass can be quite fabulous.

						   In college, I wrote my thesis basically about the duel between art and porn: what's the difference and why does it matter? I believe that the answer to this can be fairly simple, though by no means clearly delineated (a contradiction you say? phooey): the content of the image doesn't decide whether its art or porn - it lies almost entirely in the presentation - where is it shown? in what context? what materials are used?   I've thought a lot about this, but sometimes doing is way more fun than thinking. Its participatory theory. I'm being a little tongue-in-(er)-cheek here, because what I'm talking about here is fucking in front of a camera - you know, "coitus, the physical act of love."&nbsp;&nbsp;   A few months ago, I (with the cooperation of one camera-wielding friend and one cock-wielding friend) started to experiment with the fucking on camera thing, with the aim of - well, making dirty pictures. We decided to submit a piece to the second annual Neo-Erotic Juried Show at  urlLink Art at Large,  a gallery in Hell's Kitchen run by two of my favoritest  urlLink people.  &nbsp; Anyway, our piece got accepted, and hey ho I'm an artist.    urlLink     A view of Art at Large's Neo-Erotic exhibition - there's a piece of me, over in the corner.    urlLink     And here's a better view.

						   Its hilarious, sad and frustrating when I get pop-ups that "alert" me to the fact that I have porn on my computer. Considering that I spend several hours a day looking at porn at my job - and not even furtively, I'm paid to look at porn - its no wonder that there is porn on my computer.  I know, I know - I'm not the target audience for these pop-ups. But the part that makes me sad is that there are efforts made to create pop-ups and other online advertisements that remind people (ok, specifically these ads are aimed at MEN) that they are  supposed  to be afraid of being discovered and that they need to erase their tracks and prevent the spouse from finding out.   The frustrating part is that I constantly get pop-ups that are irrelevant to my life. Plus I know that I'm part of a very small fraction of people (not to mention  women ) for whom porn is a glorious wonderful thing that isn't attached to a lot of sexual shame.   Of course I recognize that sex is by and large something "people" don't talk about in a healthy, constructive way and that, as much as I trump no-shame sexuality and pride in beating off to porn, the reality is that most people just don't see it that way. And that's what landed me where I am now, in this weird place of negotiating between Pervland and the Straight World - the&nbsp;sad realization that my professional verve for porn will not be smiled on outside of my own head and a small supportive group of perverts is, well, sad.

						   So to put my best foot forward with trying to explain who I am, I'll rely on some trusty identity shorthand and then expand from there.  I'm a grrl, bisexual, polyamorous, a slut, pervert and nerd.  And now, to put that liberal arts education to work, I'll deconstruct this a little. Ah, the semantics of identity: -Grrl: Calling myself a woman still feels wrong (at 24) , girl sounds too diminiutive. Though I missed the heighth of the riot grrl movement by a few years, as a teenager I was inspired by Bikini Kill and Babes in Toyland, so the grrl is always in there. And out and about, with the prowling. -Bisexual: this one is always problematic. I like boys and grrls - but I also appreciate the genderqueer, transfolk and others who slip between the cracks (or go there kicking and screaming). I use "bisexual" because unlike "queer" it is more clear about the fact that I like (love, really) biological men. I've debated using something like "multisexual" or "pansexual" - and the words I prefer are always subject to change. -Polyamorous: in the past two years, I've come to the realization that while I am capable of monogamy, I prefer to make my life more complicated than that. I've experimented with the open relationship thing - and the truth is that I just don't know what I want. I like being a slut, but I'm just  not sure if i should have a primary partner and be a slut or if I should juggle more than one serious relationship (and also still be a slut). -Slut: I love this word. To me, its means that I like fucking unapologetically and safely. It means that I'm aware of myself and that I know (most of the time) what I want. It means that I have fantasies, but I like to take action on them as soon as I can manage it. -Pervert: This fits in nearby the whole slut thing. I think about sex a lot - sometimes in a very civilized manner, but often in its baser forms. I have dirty thoughts, I jerk off to dirty movies, I like it dirty. And I think that being a pervert can be a good thing. -Nerd: I overanalyze things, love research and want to know a lot of stuff - about sexuality in the cultural sense, about my sexuality, and about my partners. Its incurable, but mostly lovely.

						    Things haven't always looked like this - divided. But somehow they are now, and I'm starting to learn a thing or two about the closet.        The thing is: three years ago, I turned my academic (and prurient, lets not forget that) interest in sex/identity/gender and most of all FUCKING into a career. And I've been plugging away like that ever since - doing formal research on sexuality (in the cultural history sense, not the scientific one), working for a porn company, doing some responsible pervert stuff like teaching HIV/STI prevention workshops, and dabbling a bit in sex work - the kind with nakedness and fucking instead of just thinking.   But now I'm at a kind of crossroads. Because there are many facets of me, I've decided to go in a direction that, while it isn't new to my life, requires me to be more closeted about my perversions (professional and otherwise). While in many ways I'm totally psyched about my choice, in other ways I'm utterly terrified and sad to be moving into a world where people will assume I'm like them or potentially freak out if they know that I'm not.  So that's - roughly - what this blog is to be about: the process I'm going through as I try to figure out what it looks like to try and create a balance between Straight World and Pervland, in both the professional and filthy senses. You'll get to read plenty of ruminations on sex, politics, history and get acquainted with the inner workings of my brain as I think these things through - but you'll also get to hear funny stories from the daily worklife of a half-time professional pervert. And, of course, you'll also get some dirty stories that aren't about work at all.

						    Two years ago, I was entering the homestretch of a four and a half year monogamous relationship. Part of the decline of the relationship - which ended basically because we grew apart - was my gradual realization that I might want something other than a monogamous relationship. I kept this to myself, and I didn't try out the theory by cheating. I just kind of sat with it, and let it eat me up a little inside, because I knew that an open relationship was something my boyfriend could never accept, and that it really wasn’t a battle worth fighting.    In the aftermath of the relationship, I started to get my shit together and figure out more about what it is that I want – and I discovered that “polyamory,” “non-monogamy” and “open relationships” were concepts that existed in the world, other people have thought of them too! I decided that I wanted my future to look like that.  My relationship with Dirck, my significant other (SO in the parlance of poly culture), is based almost entirely on the assumption that we will always be non-monogamous and honest about it. Recently we’ve been having more conversations about what this will look like in the future, and what an ideal arrangement for this could be. We are both new at this honest non-monogamy thing and aren’t really sure where it will put us or what our ideal relationships would look like: will we each be the other’s primary partner? Will we kick it swinger style and just hook up with other people for casual sex (as a couple as well as independently)? Will we develop other serious relationships of equal importance? Some combination of all of these?  The thing is – there isn’t today and won’t be in the future – any way to figure this all out, because we don’t know specifically what we want. This became clear in a recent conversation that ended in a good dose of laughter. The only thing to do with all that is to keep on keepin’ on, make with the talking and just hope for the best.

						         The more I talk to people about sex in either the theoretical sense or the direct sense, the more I think that all sex and deviant desire is about is just – permission. People seem to have difficulty giving themselves permission to feel the way they feel, lust after what they lust for and get off to the things they get off to. Sometimes they have a desire to know that they are “normal” or they just want to have their sexual feelings legitimated, recognized and hopefully encouraged.     This makes sense, its good to feel validated, especially when it comes to private desires to do dirty things or have them done to you. This moves me into a kind of nurturing role, because I have lots of sexual nurturing to give. I like to encourage exploration – like in my threesome of this past weekend – but I know that I have to balance the delight in this role with the necessities of taking care of myself, sexually and emotionally. I have to know when to say “no” to giving – a hard thing to learn, but I think I’m learning this skill better, and trying to tame the guilt monster so I don’t feel like I’m disappointing people. Giving is good, but I have to be in an appropriate frame of mind for it. I guess what I'm saying here is that I'm giving myself permission to take care of my self first, and others when possible.

						        I’m very much a planning and list-making person. But sometimes there are life situations that just can’t have a plan, because each situation is different from the next one.  Unfortunately, when my hypothetical planning centers around a desire to create a workable double life (with many nuances), things get a little sketchy. I am bad at lying. Not the act of lying itself, I can usually do that – it’s keeping up the story over time that makes things fall apart.  Is being closeted about things or choosing not to reveal indiscretions lying, or is it a healthy form of self-preservation? Maybe the only way I can make this host of complexities work in my head and heart is to call it self-preservation and go from there.  Day by day, I’m watching the closet closing in – well, ok, that’s not quite fair… I’m watching myself inch closer to the closet with each new presentation of myself to each new person. I’m starting to try out my grad student persona a little bit. Its interesting – the conscious act of editing out the other half of my life. I’m finding that – and this is very important – I am still very much an interesting person without the sex dimension, so in many ways it seems doable. My StraightWorld coworkers don’t seem to see a gap in my persona, like I am hiding anything from them – because I lead a pretty full life without the addition of the Pervland story. This is good, and in many ways, it will be interesting to gain some distance from Pervland and to further pass in the StraightWorld, as Dacia, grad student and new professional.    The complicated part is that I’ve started to try out this persona in places I wouldn’t expect. For instance, this weekend when I had my threesome, I didn’t reveal that I work in the adult industry. I only talked about my StraightWorld job and passions. This was an experiment, in part to see if this presentation was convincing – especially once the two of them were introduced to my home, which is liberally sprinkled with dirty pictures on the walls and heaps of porn vids everywhere. They seemed to buy it. So maybe I can maintain.

						   There are these two main forces in my inner life that are totally discordant: the desire to be fucked stupid on a regular basis and the desire to be left the fuck alone so I can read and write and just be.  Over the past two years, I've pretty consistently pursued my libido - I've followed it where it will take me, into the hot and sweaty beds of many an accomplice to my crimes against nature and nurture. My nod to the "leave me alone" part of my nature is that I rarely have sleepovers because I like to be left to my own devices, especially in the morning. But every now and then, I decide enough is enough, I wipe the slate clean, delete my harem of fuck buddies from my contacts list, and hole up with a bunch of books and two or three choice friends/sex partners.  Then the libido and restlessness kicks in and I'm on the prowl again. Its an endless cycle. I just can't seem to strike a balance within it all, unless the cycle itself is a kind of balance. It doesn't feel like balance, it feels like restlessness and weirdly insatiable sexual urges fighting the other urge to be a hermit.  Maybe this cycle - and the fact that at some point in said cycle I do want to go out, meet new people and fuck their brains out - means that I am slowly beginning to crack my hermit crab shell and seek a new shell, maybe something shiny. I say this only because today at a lunch with co-workers at my StraightWorld job, I passingly mentioned the "fact" that I can be a shy and awkward person and they were utterly shocked, couldn't imagine me as that person. So maybe? Maybe I'm not that person anymore, something has happened to me in the last few years that's made me move away from that, while obviously still being attached to the idea of me as that awkward girl.  But that still doesn't answer the question at hand: prowl or hibernate?

						   I spent a lot of time today editing stills for a promotional package I'm putting together. This essentially boils down to having to pick 6-8 stills for three different productions, with around 800 images to choose from for each production. Basically, I looked at a lot of nekkid bodies today - like I do every day, only more so.  When I tell the uninitiated that I work in the adult industry, the next question is often, "Do you get turned on at work?" Yes, sometimes. But when I spend an afternoon looking at 2500 pornographic images, I'm really looking for very specific things - a certain look, a certain act. It can become very scientific as I look for the specific details that I know make images sexy, or at least are supposed.  The company I work for is trying to gently push our productions away from the mainstream, but while also staying away from the really alternative porn. We're still playing with the idea of the girl-next-door that is so familiar to porn viewers; our girls have to display a certain level of realness in their presentation, acting and general style. We had a producer a few years ago who really liked fake tits. As a result, one of the sets I was editing today had a lot of this:  urlLink    Yowza! Beautiful girl - why oh why inflate your ta-tas? Especially after seeing lots of images of "natural" beauties, the fake tits are a little over the top and hard to stomach. In my eyes (and pants), an instance of sexy become ugly.  The other thing that generally we try to avoid, but of course shows up when you hire professional porn performers, is the overly porny action, created for the sake of the viewer. For example:  urlLink

						    Words are very important to me, but I also realize that everyone is walking around with their own set of definitions and associations when it comes to words, particularly when it comes to sex (the act) and sexuality (the complex set of desires).  Anyway, yesterday afternoon I got a message responding to one of my online profiles:     urlLink          I think I can cite this as a good example of someone whose sexuailty differs from mine significantly, but uses the same language. After reading this email, I had two almost simultaneous responses - "ewww" and "yawn."       I'm not particularly in touch with my sensual (what he may determine as "sex positive") side , I suppose. I really could care less about all the stuff he mentions, especially if its with someone I don't know. On the other hand, if one of my "lovahs" was to suggest a night of bathing and massaging each other by candelight, I'd probably die laughing. So, its just not for me.      In my mind, this leaves the question: is this what men think women want? Is it what women want and I just missed that day of "how to be a real girl" class?      Well, whatever, its not for me. To each his or her own, and though I can try to be non-judgmental about sexualities that exist out in the world, I can't help but have a reaction when those sexualities are aimed at me and I don't want them to be.

						   Reading in between the lines of some of the email I’ve been getting, I realized that people are making the assumption that I’m not romantically attached to anyone, and I’m kinda out in the world mixing it up with whatever delectable prey I can seize. Its true that so far in my blog I haven’t made much of an effort to express myself otherwise, but my first sentence is only half true. I am indeed out on the prowl, fully available to pursue my lusts and dating whimsy – but I am also attached.  There are several reasons why I haven’t written about this so far. The two main ones are that my interpersonal relationships have been something of a mess recently and I’ve been mulling over thoughts about how personal I should get here. Its true, I’ve been babbling about my predilection for gay men, the sensitivity of my g-spot and sexual adventures that involve fisting. And while all those are “personal” in terms of being all up in my business, they are also not quite as personal as various emotional dramas. I’ve decided to stay away from emotional drama as much as possible here – because that’s not really what I want this forum to be for me. So I’ll be making judgment calls about what dirty laundry to air.  To introduce the two people who are closest to me sexually and emotionally, I’m going to relate a story that I think typifies these relationships and their interconnectedness. But before the gooey details, a brief introduction: 1. Dirck is my “gentleman friend” or something – the words to describe it don’t come readily. He is my romantic attachment, but its been a long road (still is) to figure out who and what we are together, because we didn’t start out on the dating path; we started out as a Craigslist casual encounter. What kind of people fall in love after starting a relationship on the premise of fucking each other stupid? We’re the answer to that, I guess. 2. Darren is my roommate and has been on and off for five years. We do not have a romantic relationship, but our relationship is sometimes sexual and its definitely loving, without the in love part. Of all weirdly defined situations, my relationship with her is in some ways the most difficult to explain. It’s much easier to live it.  So: this summer I spent a month in Europe by myself, which was an awesome, lovely, eye opening experience. Before I left, Dirck and I decided to have a grand night of fucking, which we undertook at my house. As a parting gift, Dirck had bought me a really terrific pirate hat, with a marvelous shape and the ever-necessary skull and crossbones. I was deliriously excited about said hat, and was determined to keep it on while we were fucking, which was fine with him. We ate dinner with Darren (and the pirate hat) and then retired to my room, (half) joking that we’d call Darren in when we needed her. Dirck and I always have amazing sex, though of course there are different heights of passion and intensity. That night was a good one, where we just kinda built up the orgasms in me til I was crying from the intensity. After a good hour of sheet-soaking cumming on my behalf, we decided to page Darren, who’d been working on her computer. She came in, flopped down on the bed and had a good laugh at my pirate hat, which she was impressed to learn I was still wearing. We decided that it would be best if Darren fisted me, something that Dirck hadn’t gotten to see yet, though Darren and I had been experimenting with it a bit. We got that going, and there was more furious sweating, handjobs all around and a good mix of laughter and hardcore fucking, til I just couldn’t come anymore and Dirck ceremoniously spurted cum all over Darren and I.  This is an emblematic story because it illustrates the way that the three of us deftly mix together elements of high comedy with moments of intense sexual ecstasy. It’s a pretty unique combination, and one that I wouldn’t trade for anything. Except maybe a map for hidden treasure... yaaaar.

						   This is a dreaded question from the norms, whether it’s someone I’ve been dating who doesn’t know about my slutty life (though that is an increasingly rare thing) or something that comes up in conversation about “crazy things you’ve done.” My short answer, holding my breath and trying to avoid spinning tales, is “Yes.” But the snarky answer is “You mean today? This week?” - because in my little dreamworld, threesomes (and moresomes!) would be at least weekly occurrences.   Anyway, tonight I didn’t have to skirt the threesome issue because I had a threesome date. But, for some reason, I still found myself stammering over my words a little when the question, “so have you done this a lot of times?” came up. I didn’t think I had a lot of shame around the topic of my sluttery, but apparently I do. Maybe not a whole lotta shame, but at least a little, which is what I’m embarrassed about. You follow? Its silly, really – I’m embarrassed that a part of me is ashamed that I’m a big slut, embarrassed that part of me maybe cringes a little when I hear the word “slut,” even sometimes when I say it.   Anyway, let’s move away from that sticky philosophical issue and get to the next one presented by the evening: 20 year olds. Hot or not? My personal jury (uh, me) is still out on this. Lets start with this – I didn’t have any amazing orgasms tonight due to a lack of technical proficiency on the part of my two sex partners. But, charmingly, it wasn’t for lack of trying. Ambitious little ones, they were. But let it be known that I am perfectly happy to hand-deliver packages of orgasm to myself; no qualms, no hard feelings. But, in many ways, the looks of wonder on their young and inexperienced faces were worth the sacrifice of a seriously cummerific time for me. Its true, playing teacher is hot. You just have to be in the right mood for all the giving and be ready to receive happiness and hot looks instead of thunderous orgasms.  I am also happy to report that once again, my patented “get laid” shirt did indeed get me laid. And several other people to boot.  urlLink

						   I’ve always been tagged as a fag hag, but like everything else me, it’s not that simple. I’m not the fag hag who gets all a-flutter over the boys playing for the pink team because they are well dressed and groomed while also being sexually non-threatening. Once, long ago, I thought this thing was as simple and cute as the  urlLink Ukes of Hazard’s  ode to the  urlLink “Gay Boyfriend.”  But, while still in high school, I started to figure out that my “thing” was a little more complicated, firstly because it is totally wrapped up in fucking.  The boys I get my “fag-hag” lust for have typically been very effeminate but utterly straight. In high school, the lengthiest relationship I had was with a very effeminate pretty boy who wore lipstick and had a thing for dykey women with hairy legs – which more than qualified me. Throughout college, I dated a boy who people always assume is gay, while I stomped around in my knee-high doc martens and buzzed hair. In both relationships, we totally played up the peculiarity of our attraction and presentations, because genderbending is undeniably hot.  I’ve also always been outrageously attracted to very very gay men – we’re talking  urlLink Kinsey 6s  here (though I hope against hope that they are Kinsey 5s instead). This is best illustrated with an anecdote from a family vacation to Cape Cod last summer, during which I spent a night in Provincetown with my parents. I did some drinking, which encouraged the emission, “Dammit, I wish I was a gay man so these guys would give me a chance. I’ve got the fuckin hots for all these queens!” Something every mother yearns to hear.  But in the past year or so, it seems that my sexual attractions have taken a new twist. I’ve recently begun to notice a major attraction to twinks, the gay male version of the girl-next-door. They are young-looking, smooth bodied, maybe a hint of muscle or a hint of baby fat, with an innocent, maybe kinda “normal”* look that barely conceals outrageous hormones and fierce sexual talents. Whew, now I’m hot and bothered.  *I’m just gonna put it in quotes, and resist the urge to deconstruct.

						       Here at porn central, we've been having an argument about cock size and girth - this argument is not about saying that bigger is better, because we've all agreed that different people like different kinds of cock. The argument is more about visual impressiveness on film. As anyone who has spent half a second in front of a porn film knows, in the California porn that dominates the market, the monster cock reigns supreme. And the priority for humungo cock is one of the things that has trickled down into amateur smut everywhere.  Anyway, yesterday a friendly but heated argument stirred up, because a (very cute and personable) couple that came in for the casting call includes an Asian man. One of the producers is concerned about the reputation of Asian men to be underly endowed. This led to an argument about whether we should reinforce the myth that bigger is always better or show cocks of varying size and shape. Part of the problem of course is that its not just about what we at the company believe to be true or good or sex and body positive, but there is the whole command of the market thing. Will people be interested in seeing porn with average sized cocks? Or are porn viewers on average only interested in seeing a porn circus, with freakshow proportion cocks and tits.  The cock wars continue today - and I maintain that huge cocks are definitely a source of fascination because there aren't a whole lotta them out there, but also it could be quite a good thing to feature more average cocks. We could be trendsetters - but I'm also not funding these productions. And so the cock wars rage on.

						   There are plenty of sex acts that I think I'm pretty good at. This stems from a basic level of comfort with my body, my knowledge of said body, my curiosity about other people's bodies and my willingness to make others happy. However, I suck at dirty talk.  For me, attempting dirty talk is like being in junior high school and trying to talk to a boy or girl I had a crush on: its utterly terrifying. I clam up, stutter and generally make an ass out of myself. And I don't think this is an area in which I can play off of the cute, awkward bespectacled girl thing, because in the heat of the moment, thats just lame. I can be dirty and suggestive when I'm not naked, or when things are getting rolling. But once I'm naked and in the heat of things, forget about it.  My first confrontation with this shortcoming was last year, when I was fucking a boy who was very vocal during sex. One time, as I climbed on top of him, he said "Tell me a dirty story while you fuck me." I totally froze, got grumpy, pouted a bit and said: "No." It was non-negiotable, there was just no way I could deliver. Maybe this is because of the daunting task of multi-tasking - coherent sentences and fierce cock-riding? I think not.  I've been able to skirt around the dirty talk thing recently because I've found a happy medium between imaginative storytelling and monosyllabic grunting: sexily asking for something or hotly demanding it. This means I don't have to be especially creative, but I can also get what I want. Heavy breathing and saying "slide your fingers into me" is dirty talk right?  But because I'm ever growing and changing, I am trying to get past this roadblock in my sexual progress (because after all, sexual accomplishment is a competitive sport). I've discovered that there is a secret key to inspiring dirty talk from me - and surprisingly, its not bourbon. Its anal sex and/or group sex. These situations have inspired such classic one-liners as "fuck me like you're killing me," "bury your cock in my ass," and "fuck me deep." These rare moments of linguistic clarity have inspired peals of laughter, high fives and then full compliance.  So maybe I'm not so very far away from being a full-fledged potty mouth, but the thought of someone saying "talk dirty to me" still kinda makes me wanna run in fear.

						   In a very unexpected way, being involved in the adult industry has actually made me get over some of my hang ups about my own body. I really thought that the industry would take me in the opposite direction, that I would feel perpetually chubby and unhot. Part of it is because being on set, in casting calls and seeing footage that never makes it into the finished product makes me realize - these girls are a far cry from perfect. Its also being around bodies so much and realizing how unique each one is. But its more than that. Its realizing that, perfection aside, there are so many tastes and flavors out there in the world that attraction is really a matter of niche marketing.  Of course, there is the dominant paradigm (tall! thin! blonde! femme! tits-on-a-stick) that is internalized through swallowing the pill, being gag fucked by it or just the osmosis of living in the world. Cruel cruel beauty myth, how I have struggled with you and lived in opposition to you - and swallowed you so that you can burn me from the inside. Starting around age 14, I developed a pretty severe eating disorder that helped self-hatred manifest and cling to my brain for years.  But as I get older I give less of a shit about that ever-pervasive beauty standard: maybe I'm finally exorcising that demon. More than that though,I'm trying to find and enjoy alternative beauties (me included!). And that sounds like a tagline for any number of altporn ventures that are flourishing online communities, but images of difference are good.  Even better than those images of difference is what happened inside my head today. We had a girl come back to a second round of casting calls, and everyone in the office is nuts over her. She's certainly cute and young and her tits are nice and perky. I think she's cute too, its not just everyone else - she is the prototype of the perfect girl for our company, thats for sure. But I can totally separate that - her subjective hotness - from what I think of myself. I'm not comparing the pertness of her tits to mine - because why? I know there are plenty of folks who love small perky tits like hers - but plenty also love large pierced tits like mine. Sure, they might not be the same people, and she is the kind of girl who can have a fairly succesful modeling career while I'm not. But that comparison doesn't matter, because I know that my "look" is marketable - and beyond that, I appreciate myself for what I am, so do others, and the market can go fuck itself. Everyone else can go fuck themselves too. Or they can find people who fit their desired aesthetic to fuck them. And I'll do the same (not fuck them, find more people I lust after who lust after me).  So that's my dose of our bodies, ourselves brand feminist self-cheerleading for the day. I'm gonna sneak off to the bathroom for my afternoon wank and then chow down on some chocolate. Call it the celebration of me.

						   A few days ago, I borrowed  urlLink "Trannyfags"  from my friend Jane. We are always eager to swap porn titles and hook each other up with free porn that comes to us through various channels, because its fun to play porn fairy. Anyway, she lent me this copy of "Trannyfags," a new movie that I've been hearing lots of good things about.  And I've gotta say - from the viewpoint of someone trying to get their rocks off, I was just sorely disappointed.  I have great respect and appreciation for the folks who put the video together and especially those who starred in it. But - the cinematography and editing (I'm a snob, I know) was just awful. This makes me very sad, because on a daily basis I see porn that is just crappy content - frightening people who I don't find sexy, dispassionately going through the motions - but is expertly produced, shot and edited. The form makes a big difference, content alone can't carry a film.  For instance, in "Trannyfags" there is one scene with a black bio-boy and a white ftm - they are hot, and they are hot for each other, which is definitely a great recipe for an explosive scene: but. The scene has very rapid editing, switching from one camera angle to the next very quickly - this is probably an an attempt to capture the intensity of the moment, but it ends up being really distracting. This scene also includes a bunch of split screen shots, where there are two or three different camera angles up on the screen at once. And again, while I can understand the reasoning behind it, this ends up distracting me from the action and actually making it more difficult for me to enjoy the sweaty grunting nakedness on screen.  I think its difficult to be experimental with the form of a porn flick and still have it be successful in terms of its being PORN. Straightforward filmmaking - though it seems incredibly boring - is probably the best approach to take. Simple editing with slow enough pacing that the viewer gets to appreciate the action thoroughly, but quick enough so different angles can get checked out is definitely necessary. But lots of switching around or intercutting between different scenes (which Trannyfags was not guilty of but is one of my major pet peeves) just doesn't end up capturing the essence of the fucking. And thats what porn is about to me - capturing the heat, intensity and essence of fucking, with whatever combination of bodies. And then packaging it for girls like me to beat off to.  Regardless of my disappointment, I want to see more films from the director, Morty Diamond. And I want to see more hot trannyfag action in general. Thats what I want for Christmas.

						   In my very first post, I mentioned that part of the reason I'm writing this blog is to sort of hash out the challenges, difficulties and seductive properties of living a double life. The double life thing is new for me, because since I got involved in the sex world three years ago, I've been very lucky to be surrounded both professionally and personally by amazingly sex positive people who have encouraged my exploration of sexuality on both the intellectual and physical levels. I've been able to be very open with the people close to me about what I'm up to, what I'm thinking about, what I fantasize about and what kind of trouble I get myself into. Its a wonderful, unique thing and not something I take for granted.  This however, is starting to change, because I've made the decision to enter an MA program in the fall that will bring me closer to my StraightWorld career goals, but will begin to create more of a divide between the pieces of me. Up until now I've been able to get StraightWorld and Pervland to coexist fairly harmoniously - at least in my own head and to a great extent in the heads of those who are nearest and dearest. But... the times they are a-changin' and I have made the conscious choice to enter the closet.  So: I have a blossoming friendship with a woman at my StraightWorld job. She's a real peach: well travelled, well spoken, plus funny and fun to be around. But... she's from over there. Part of me feels like there is no way I can have a deep friendship with her, because I'm pretty certain that the knowledge of my connections to Pervland would frighten her deeply (though you can never be sure). So the questions are: can I accept what I will always see as a somewhat superficial friendship (though it might not be on her side) or do I at some point try to bridge the gap and come out to her? And of course in this it is important to know that since she is connected jobwise to my StraightWorld, there is of course the possibility that nasty rumors (that could probably be substantiated) will circulate through StraightWorld and damage my career. Egads.  Of course I understand the concept of different levels of friendship and I'm capable of doing that, not everything has to be full disclosure all the time. But at the same time, I get really anxious getting to know someone through "proper" channels - not we're at a sex party, we're making out, by the way what's your name? or I placed/responded to a Craigslist ad that appeals to my sexual persona. Instead, I guess I'm doing what most people do, meeting people through work or whatever, talking a bit, going out, talking some more. Its confusing, but I know it isn't supposed to be.  I guess it really boils down to me being afraid of rejection. I can deal with the rejection of me as a physical entity - if I'm too chubby, not chubby enough, or just not the type someone is looking for, that's cool. But its the thought of being rejected for who I am at my core - sexually perverse, slutty, wanton - that makes me feel ill. What if someone really liked me all 'round, thought I was smart and fabulous - and then found out that I'm a pervert, or that I've done sex work, been to sex parties, and work in the adult industry - and the new knowledge cancelled everything else out?

						   This weekend I attended an annual family gathering in which lots of food is eaten and various judgments are passed on people's life decisions. I have a cousin who is basically my opposite - he is an abstinence only educator who travels the country trumping chastity to young people - no sex til marriage, that whole thing. He is 26 and got married last year to a 23 year old girl who he met through his work. They now have a house and a newborn baby (named after the pope!). Though he wasn't at the reunion, I go to meet her for the first time - and I came ready to duel!  But what became apparent pretty quickly was that actually - though she is an abstinence-only educator and promoter of marriage etc and I'm a slutty pro-safer sex pervert, we have some similar training. We were both being active listeners, affirming the other's feelings, and using lots of I-statements. It was almost comical, because we were being very respectful of each other's opinions, but talking pretty frankly about our experiences teaching and learning about sex education. It was pretty awesome, and a bit of an eye opener. Even though I think abstinence-only education is wrong wrong wrong, it was interesting to actually meet and talk to someone who is the face of that and kind of hash things out.  Confronting difference is good.

						   Thursday afternoon was a three hour long casting call at the porn company I work for. Casting calls are really interesting experiences, to put it mildly. Though I am involved in the actual interview process with people when (if) they show up, I am not involved with the placing of ads and arranging of appointments. This means that I basically don't know who will be showing up or when - all I know is that they will probably be very young, skinny, bubbly women.  As soon as a girl comes in, I'm all about trying to make her feel comfortable and not nervous. Usually I reject the whole gender solidarity thing for various reasons, not the least of which being that I'm a huge brat, but I'm very keen on gender solidarity during these casting calls, because not only am I the only other girl there, but I'm the person who is closest in age to the potential talent. These conversations can be lots of fun as we get to know the girl, which boils down to three major questions: how comfortable is she with her body and her sexuality? is she crazy? is she interested in doing porn to get revenge or make someone jealous?  In the casting call yesterday, we got a really nice, cute girl with great tits (I know for sure they were nice because part of casting is getting the girl to take her clothes off). It was pretty easy to get her talking about herself and why she's interested in doing porn. In my notes, fairly early in the interview, I wrote: "motivation to do porn is purely vindictive - bad boyfriend." As we got her talking more, she confessed that she wants to do porn because she wants to "torture" her boyfriend. To me, this is a red flag. But the powers that be were very taken with her, so she may do a solo scene for us sometime soon.  Afterwards, I was thinking more about her and the other girls who came to the casting, all of whom were very young - in the 18-21 range. And the more I think about it, the more I think that the minimum age for porn performers should be 21 instead of 18, because seriously, what 18 year old girl is mature enough to deal with sex (much less porn) and has thoroughly learned to say no and stick to it. I am a major supporter of the idea that porn (and sex work more generally) can be a wonderful and liberating experience, but it can also be oppressive and fucked up. This discussion came up a few months ago on Carly Milne'  urlLink  Pornblography,  where Carly also says that 21 should be the minimum age. It's certainly a dilemma - and its been pointed out to me that its perhaps unusual for someone sex positive and pro-porn to recommend an increase in minimum age for something sex related. But while I think its important for women of all ages to have access to, say, reproductive health care, I do think this is a different issue. A sticky one (har har), to be sure.

						   DISCLAIMER: What follows are my observations about my own body's sexual response. What I like or respond orgasmically to is not necessary the standard for all girls all the time (or even for me all the time).  That said: the war between clitoral and g-spot stimulation is on.  I am one of those lucky girls who can orgasm through the application of several different types of stimuli to several different areas of my body.  According to various reports and studies (both formal and informal), the vast majority of women need to have clitoral stimulation to bring them to orgasm. I had my first orgasms this way, I think mostly because I was a little bit afraid of what lurked  inside  and so by just rubbing my clit I could kinda get around the shame of masturbating by convincing myself that I wasn't  really  doing it. I got over the whole shame of self penetration thing and started using a vibrator at 18 (incidentally, although I don't use it anymore and the motor is broken, I still have that first vibrator - nostalgic eh?), though I still stuck with the clit orgasm because I didn't know that there were other ways.  Until... the summer after I turned 19. I was about to move to New York City and so went on a grand vacation with the family. For some reason, some of my best sexual epiphanies happen on family vacations - I guess I turn all that family-driven angst into extreme libidinous concentration. Anyway, in my furtive and emphatic late night masturbation sessions, I discovered my g-spot. But, more alarming and fascinating than the simple g-spot romp, I discovered female ejaculation and a new era was ushered in.  But these days its not as simple as choosing between the two types of stimulation, because of course I am greedy and I want it ALL. In my solo sessions, I go for a combination effect - start out switching between the two areas, and then finish with a vibe on my clit, a nice curved dildo or vibe pressing against my g-spot, and often a butt plug for good measure. Rinse and repeat as necessary.  In my partnered sessions, I like to warm up with some clit stim and small clit orgasms (which are sometimes also accompanied by some squirting), but then I like to do a lot of penetration and g-spot poking, because its fun to be able to orgasm while being penetrated. So, in my solo sessions I like to finish with a big ole clit orgasm, while in my partnered sessions I like to stick mostly with g-spot orgasms, because they can be continuous.  But speaking of combinations... I have this tried and true manual combination, something I like to call "the triple threat:"  urlLink    This is a difficult one to self-apply with perfection, but is great to use on a friend. The thumb is for clit rubbing, three fingers go in the vagina, and the pinky can be used for gentle anal stim or penetration.  The triple threat, however, is not to be confused with the metal sign:  urlLink    Though perhaps not the best for manual stimulation of one's own or a partner's genitals, metal is best used to show enthusiasm for the rock and the roll.

						   This evening, being in the neighborhood and all, I was compelled to go to the best sex toy shop ever,  urlLink Toys in Babeland.  I purchased two toys, because believe it or not, I've been growing a little tired of my  urlLink Hitachi Magic Wand  (but don't tell her, I don't want to hurt her feelings) and have been feeling like I need some different vibe action.  Its funny because when I first started using the Hitachi, I didn't like that it was so long that my vibrator-wielding hand couldn't really be near my girl parts. But now, I really like having one near and one far hand. Hence the purchase of the  urlLink Tulip Wand  (right), for more precise vibrations than the Hitachi can deliver. I also purchased a  urlLink Nubby G  (center), because I just can't get enough of that g spot stim and I'm always happy to try new ways of making that happen.  urlLink    After Babeland, I realized that I needed to replenish my supplies of double A batteries and baby wipes. Somebody's having a party - in my pants!  And yes, those are leopard print bedsheets.

						   I have this fuck buddy -JD- who I've been seeing for about a year now. I got an email from him today:  urlLink     Our email communication is never more complex than this, except sometimes we send each other dirty pictures. Our phone conversations are equally uncomplicated - we agree on time and place, and thats it.  This relationship is basically the ideal fuck buddy relationship, because we call each other whenever we feel like it and - go. We have zero emotional attachment and basically get together because of our shared appreciation for fucking. There is so little attachment that we've never seen each other's apartments, because we always meet in "short stay" hotels, the kind of place that doesn't bother giving you a key because they know you aren't going to leave and come back later. There is a royally sleazy place we've been to a few times on 42nd street ($25 for 2 hours) - there is no official name to the hotel that we know of, but it has a nickname. Many years ago, one of JD's buddies hooked up with a really hot black girl and she took him to this particular hotel. The whole time they were fucking, she kept yelling "Fuck this black bitch!" So, according to this legend, the place has come to be known as the Black Bitch Hotel.*  Anyway, in our first ever encounter, JD and I got together with my friend Jane, who had already been doing him. It was one of the most awesome threesomes I've had. JD decided to spring for a room at the  urlLink Gershwin Hotel,  which since it is sort of classy doesn't have the beds bolted down to the floor. This proved funny when I was able to hump the bed across the room and back.  *Incidentally, the hotel is also nicknamed "The Crack Hotel" by the esteemed Mr. Joe Gallant, who has filmed scenes for a variety of cinematic works under the imprint of  urlLink Black Mirror Productions  there.

						   Sometime in the course of the day, there appeared in my office a large box that has written on it: "Ye Olde Crap Box." Because its encroaching on my personal space, I felt it was my duty to open 'er up (incidentally, I feel the same way about cute girls in my proximity).  It is indeed a box of mysterious crap. It contains the usual mix of odd cables that someone seems to have had trouble parting with, plus some shiny costumes and a double-ended dildo, not new and in the package, so presumably used on a shoot and then tossed in the crap box.  The other thing I've been doing today is researching slang terms for male masturbation, for use in a press release I'm writing. My favorite at the moment is "burping the worm."

						   I've recently taken over the exciting, nerdy and obsessive (just my style) task of monitoring the web stats for the porn company I work for. Perhaps the most interesting thing I've learned so far - other than the fact that we get lots of hits from URLs coming out of US Military Bases and the country of Saudi Arabia - is that the time of day that our site gets hit the most is 3 pm.  This makes sense to me - people have had their lunch. They are getting restless at work - tired and horny. As a result, they are snooping around the internet for some hot. sex. pics.  I have plenty of access to the aforementioned smut, but at about that time of day I'm getting anxious too, which normally results in a flurry of 3 pm emails, a serious dose of caffeine and a furtive wank in the company bathroom.

						   Last night I had an evening of dinner, drinks and filthy stories with a wonderful friend who is a former boss, fifteen years older than me, going through a divorce - so there are lots of things that separate us. But, beyond all that, he and I have a lot in common - namely our mutual honesty fetish when it comes to disclosure about the sexual chaos we create and participate in.  We talk about sexual experience with a kind of hunger - because we agree that sexual adventures are worth sharing, not just as a matter of one-upsmanship (though there is certainly an element of that in our talks), but because there is something fabulous and awesome about sex that shouldn't be kept to oneself. And hearing dirty stories is fun.  Intermingled with our dirty stories last night was an interesting conversation about the morality of interacting with what we refer to as "norms" - people whose erotic adventures have been limited to their imaginations until they meet those the likes of us, people who entertain some perverted thoughts but have never gotten to express them sexually or even in conversation, and people who are involved in our lives and don't know about the sea of perversion that's hidden from their views. On one hand, we agreed, its really hot to be involved in a pivotal experience for someone or be a part of their sexual awakening. But with that may come a kind of eerie responsibility - for us pervs, perversion exists before and after the norm. But for the norm, that experience or series of experiences may be IT. So the question remains: is granting someone's fantasy a nice gift to give them or will it destroy them?
