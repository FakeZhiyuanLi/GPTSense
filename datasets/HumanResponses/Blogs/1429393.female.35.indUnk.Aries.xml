      I can already tell it needs work, and it hasn't even sat for three months. Any suggestions would be appreciated. What I am discussing is prejudice--in the sense of setting your ideals with no consideration about what is going on in the real world. Before exploring reality.   I've put the parts that don't read well to me in brackets. Suggestions please!!!!  If you must be a dreamer, Then have the right dreams Acknowledge all beauty Don't go to extremes. When your life is annoying [Your random destroying] Won't make you secure Or render things pure.  If you must be a leader, Then choose the right route, And be sure that you know What you’re talking about. [If you solely are striving, We won't be arriving In the future we could If you'd done what you should.]  If you must be a teacher, Then teach what is true. While opening minds  To a broad point of view. Keep your teaching far reaching And [avoid merely] preaching Then our kids will be bright And will do what is right.  If you must be a preacher, Consider your flock, So don't just quote Jesus, But also John Locke. And if faith is a virtue, [Then extend it to man, Cause if God is all-loving, Then we're ALL in his plan.]  If you limit your choices  To a set of ideals That doesn't consider How your friend or foe feels [Then you're asking for terror Results of an error] When you made up your mind [To lack faith] in mankind.   OK, it needs some work, but that's what works in progress are all about.

      Let me write something worth reading in case anyone actually looks at my blog.  Here are two proverbs that sum up my current philosophy on life:  "The greatest oak was once a little nut who held his ground."  And yet, "no matter how the wind howls, the mountain will not bow to it."    The difference is that a mountain is inflexible, whereas the ground is not.  You  should know when you are dealing with inflexibility. That's when you should give up.   Like Bush. There's really no point in trying to convert him on anything. Protests are pointless. But then working to get him out of office is a viable.  My horoscope today said: "You could wind up tilting at windmills if you aren't careful."  I certainly have been. I do that a lot for some reason.  I think it is because so many obstacles are illusory.  Part of doing remarkable things is testing limits to see what is achievable and what is not.  Doesn't the world need a few Donna Quixotes?  Just to keep things moving? Aren't all pioneers dreamers? Oscar Wilde, who I love to quote, said:  "Society often forgives the criminal; it never forgives the dreamer."

      Richard just emailed me that if you connect to  urlLink http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html  , then you can download episodes of MST3000 and Blake 7 (among others.) He said that they have program listings at  urlLink http://www.suprnova.org/   Let me just say that Avon from Blake 7 is one of the sexiest characters in any TV show I've watched (perhaps with the exception of Tom Baker's version of Dr. Who.)  Don't bother looking up their pictures. It's their acting that is sexy.  The only actor I know who is both sexy in style and appearance is Jeremy Northam.  Paul Darrow, the guy who plays Kerr Avon, and Jeremy Northam are both wonderful at conveying intensity with their eyes.  It's truely sexy.  I'd do 'em both in a minute, although I would try to make it last longer.

      There was a baby fawn on our front lawn today. There's this small square of grass right in front of the house, and the poor little critter (who could barely walk) couldn't get down from it. I guess his mother had unloaded him there and then got hungry.  Dad rushed in to borrow my camera, but he thought he was putting it on telephoto when he was really setting it to wide angle. (You would think you could tell from what you were seeing.)   He's down trying to get some more photos, but the fawn finally managed to make the big leap off our mini lawn, so it will be a lot harder to get good pictures at this point.  It was probably one of those you had to be there scenes, but he's quite cute. (Or maybe she's quite cute. I didn't really look that close.)

      I was thinking about what really controls our culture these days. Answer: escapism.   It's not really a new idea. The romans had bread and circuses to keep the masses sedate. Now it's tractor pulls and boxing/wrestling and sports and video games and television and the occassional war. Noncommital sex. On the other end of the spectrum, it's "art" and music and movies and books.  To be fair, we are actually escaping things that probably should be escaped. It's not as if the marketplace and the jobs that promote it enrich our lives all that much. There's existence, and then there is quality of life.  It just seems like it's a double edged sword. I heard a gentleman reading an essay the other day on the decadence of our modern notion of "fun." Doing things for no purpose but feeling good. On the other hand, if the only purpose to the "real world" is promoting a cultural structure, which frequently is running in automatic, then what is the point to that?  Art could be lumped in with "fun," except that sometimes art does teach us something. And sometimes it keeps our emotions alive, which also does nothing for utility.   People always want a purpose in life, and the answer always seems to either be productivity or diversions from productivity.    If you think about it, there are two reasons to be awarded wages. One is that what you are doing is something someone would not do for the amusement of it. Or two, it is such a specialized skill that no one else could do it.   And that is why work is painful--because it is inevitably not the type of thing people would do for a hobby.  They do their hobbies for free.  It's like art. It's not an accident that the artists are starving. The supply of labor is so high because people like being artistic. Or writing poetry. Everyone wants to express herself and be heard, so there are tons of people trying to do that. No one pays for what they can get for free.   Which gets us back to escape. Escape is just getting away from these things that need to be done, but are no damn fun.   More later....

      OK, I suggested the topic of entitlement for Charles's next discussion meeting, so I guess I had better start formulating what my contribution to that meeting will be.  The question is whether some people deserve more than others.   It seems to me that our culture promotes two different ideas. One is that what you take out should be in proportion to what you put in. This is sort of the Little Red Hen philosophy. I hacked the wheat; I ground the flour; I baked the bread; it's mine.  The other philosophy seems to be that people put in relative to what they can put in and they take out relative to what they need. This one is formulated in terms of collective responsibility and collective good.   The reason I have always balked at the red hen theory is that I think it is hypocritical. As I was writing someone recently, the whole notion of self sufficiency seems to be based on competition, which is itself a form of dependency. You can't compete in a vacuum, unless you are competing with yourself. If your motivation is based on what others do, then you are dependent on those other people.   In the case of the Little Red Hen, she may do most of the work, but she does take the wheat to the mill, and I gather she pays for things using currency, which is also a social exchange.   I have heard people suggest that monetary exchange is fair and equal because each party gets to decide whether they will participate in that exchange. However, prices can be elastic or inelastic, and it seems to me that this is to some degree a measure of desperation.  For example, if you are in a desert and someone has access to water, you might pay an immense amount for that water just because it is scarce and you need it to survive. So is that actually a fair exchange just because both people agree to the terms? For it to "fair" should not the costs to each party be the same?  And is not the cost to each party relative to their own standard of living?  That brings us full circle to entitlements. Some people figure that entitlement should be based on needs. That if a person needs a heart transplant and the resources are available for it, then he should get it. End of story.  So clearly the supply and reserves on hand affect the issue of entitlement.    On the other end of the entitlement arguement are our ideals. Quality of life being a biggy. Questions about the principle of diminishing returns apply for example, so that you clearly can say that a certain point a person has as many resources as he/she can possibly use and enjoy in a constructive way.  Versus just how much is enough?  Is waste actually necessary? Is enough as good as a feast?  If you base self worth on competition does that promote conformity and aiming for the lowest common denominator?    Then there is the issue of individual responsibility versus collective responsibility. This gentleman got annoyed with me recently because I said that I didn't see how he could be opposed to cost shifting in taxation, but be in favor of cost shifting in lives for a war that did not actually punish the perpetrators of the crime (insofar as the Iraqis had nothing to do with what happened on 9/11.) The same question is also true for patriotism/ nationalism. How can you argue for individual responsibility and then still be a nationalist, which is about  promoting a collective interest based purely on location.   Is there a big difference between collective interest based on location and collective interest based on economic status?  So that one is desirable to promote, but the other is less so?  I was also thinking last night that whereas competition is a form of dependency that there is probably some forms that are parasitic versus others which are symbiotic. And perhaps the virtue or vice of competition would be based on which style of dependency you had.  But I think all forms of human interaction can be symbiotic or parasitic, so probably this extends to virtues and vices in other ways as well. What makes a symbiotic relationship better is that it is based on equality of benefit. Or at least the benefits have to outweigh the detriments in the exchange.   I think this is the problem with things that are abstract though. You could say that taxation results more positives than negatives, but some of those positives are so diffused that people might not even realize that they are a byproduct of a policy or behavior.  So another question would be what role causality should play in determining entitlements.  I was just thinking. In discussing entitlements, I should be sure to bring up the issue of time. Everyone should probably be entitled to a certain amount of free time.

      The first Hardtalk segment made me so mad that I wrote the show the following message:  I used to watch Hard Talk when I was living in New Zealand, and I thought it was great. I just discovered that it has its episodes online now. While that really excited me, I was rather disturbed at the first interview I downloaded between Tim Sebastian and Anas Altikriti.   For starters, Iraq had nothing to do with what happened on September 11th here in the United States!!!  George Bush had plans on the table to attack Iraq long before the September 11th disaster; people who were in his administration are writing books about this. It's not new. Much of the plan to attack Iraq mirrors one devised by Paul Wolfowitz from years earlier.   But let's think about Bush's justifications for war and see if they make sense. Bush argued that we couldn't trust inspections because the weapons labs were mobile. He claimed that the weapons could be removed before the inspectors reached them. By that very arguement, attacking an entire nation is pointless because the weapons labs can be smuggled off to other countries. They could be moved to Pakistan, the same way that Osama bin Laden (also a mobile target) managed to get out of Afghanistan during a US evacuation of Pakistani ISI forces. They could be moved to Jordon or Saudi Arabia . They could even make it as far as the United Kingdom. Would it be acceptable to attack the United Kingdom if the United States thought that terrorists and/or their weapons were in that country?  Yes, that was his other major arguement--that Iraq was "harbouring members of Al-Qaeda." Nevermind that the September 11th attacks were planned here in the United States. Should we have destroyed America's infrastructure and gotten rid of those nasty terrorists once and for all ? Set off a few e-bombs off at Disneyland (just in case some terrorists were planning something there?) Certainly anyone at Disneyland qualifies as collateral damage--after all, they are mostly tourists anyway. And to think, they managed to find ways to attack the US, and they weren't even in Iraq! You'd have thought that they were only dangerous to us in Iraq the way Bush carried on.   But you see whereas weapons labs and terrorists are mobile and are able to organize anywhere, the oil sources are not. They are in Saudi Arabia and in Iraq. And the Bush family is tight with Saudi royal family, so the problem by default is Iraq.  But why would I think the Bush's care about oil? Could it be because as Representative Frank Pallone, Jr points out that "big oil give $3.2 million to the Bush campaign in the last election and $25.6 million to Republicans overall...?"  Or the long list of links within his administration to oil and weapons: Arbusto Energy, Bush Exploration Oil Company, Halliburton, Chevron, Harken Energy,  Tom Brown, Inc., Spectrum 7.   There's the "Defense Policy Board, whose nine members have won more than $76 billion in defense contracts in 2001 and 2002." The fact that the Pentagon no longer has to be audited, because it's never passed an audit for so long that Congress waived the requirements.  Have you looked at the Security and Exchange commissions proxy statements and seen the rises in CEO pay in the last few years for the oil and weapons industries?   Did you know that the new interim Prime Minister of Iraq was spending about $120,000 per month lobbying Congress here in the US to secure his position?  Hired a PR consultant, etc. That he was sponsored by a gentleman in London whose family got rich from oil. The new President is related to the Saudi royal family and might have made a few contacts when he was going to school at the Petroleum and Minerals University in Saudi Arabia.  This is not about muslims or christians. This is about a class war --between haves and have nots. Not only haves and have nots in America, but haves and have nots in the Arab world as well.   Because you know what terrorism is? Terrorism is what a leader of my government blythely referred to as "collateral damage." Taking innocent people out with no regard to the fact they are innocent. It is capturing ordinary Iraqis and torturing them.   Shakespeare had a great quote for what we are doing in Iraq. He said, "heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself: we may outrun, by violent swiftness, that which we run at, and lose by over-running."  Seeking enemies is not the way to make friends. Attacking muslims living in exile is not the way to make friends. Generalizing about people is not the way to make friends. What it is is the way to destroy what beauty there is on the planet.  Thank you,  Sheryl Zettner

      An article from February 24, 2004, included in the Congression Record as well as  urlLink Neil Abercrombie's website , cites the publication Roll Call. It explains how Ayad Allawi set things up to become the interim Prime Minister of Iraq: ===================================================== Iraqi Money Flows by Brody Mullins  Several well-heeled Iraqis who hope to play central roles in Iraq's emerging government have launched lobbying campaigns in Washington to influence the Bush administration and Congress as they work to shape a permanent government in Iraq.  The group of Iraqis, which include three members of the U.S.-created  urlLink Iraqi Governing Council , are spending as much as $100,000 per month on lobbying firms and public relations agents to press U.S. officials to create a modern, democratic government that is not dominated by Islamic conservatives.  ``It's like they are running for president,'' said one U.S. official of the competing public relations efforts in Washington.  The three Iraqis began their public relations efforts in Washington more than a decade after another Iraqi member of the Iraqi Governing Council--Ahmed Chalabi--began cultivating close ties to now-Vice President Cheney and other key administration officials.  According to forms filed with the Justice Department, Ayad Allawi, a member and former president of the Iraqi Governing Council, has begun an expensive lobbying and public relations effort to press U.S. officials to build a modern democratic government that builds on Iraq's existing foundations.  Allawi has already paid more than $300,000 to Washington from  urlLink Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP  to help open doors on Capital Hill and at the White House.  Allawi also hired a  urlLink former U.S. ambassador  to coordinate his Washington effort and a  urlLink New York advertising firm  that once worked for the Beatles to manage his image in the United States.  The public relations effort, which could top $1 million this year, is funded by Mashal Nawab, an Iraqi-born physician who is a ``close friend and admirer'' of Allawi, according to the Justice Department forms.  Adnan Pachachi, another member and former president of Iraq's interim government, has also signed up a Washington public relations firm to help him get his message across to the Bush administration and Congress.  F. Wallace Hayes, working on a pro bono basis for now, will write press releases for the 70-year-old Pachachi that ``promote democracy in Iraq,'' according to the Justice Department forms.  Meanwhile, Baqir Jabor, an Iraqi exile appointed by the United States to run Iraq's housing and construction department, has asked former Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) and his influential Washington lobbying firm to help arrange a  series of meetings with the Bush administration during his upcoming visit to the United States.  Officials at Livingston Group said Jabor is not a formal client of the firm. Other details of Livingston's work with Jabor are not yet available because Jabor first asked Livingston for help only last month.  The new public relations campaigns in Washington come as the Bush administration struggles to complete an interim constitution for Iraq by the end of the month in order to turn control of the government over to Iraq this year.  In the past few days, it has become clear that the United States will fail to meet both deadlines.  Over the weekend, the Kurds in northern Iraq--which comprise 20 percent of the country--rejected key parts of the constitution. Meanwhile, Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator in Iraq, acknowledged last week that it is unlikely that Iraq will be able to hold an election for at least another year.  By hiring lobbyists in Washington, the Iraqi leaders hope to one day play a central role in the emerging government.  The Iraqis who have hired lobbyists are each former exiles who want the United States to create a democratically elected government.  Iraq's Shiites make up as much as 60 percent of the country and are better organized than their political and ethnic rivals, the Kurds and the Sunnis.  The leader of Iraq's Shiite conservatives, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, hopes to schedule quick elections, knowing that he and his allies would dominate the government if elections are held soon.  Allawi, Jabor and Pachachi share another rival in Chalabi. But unlike the Iraqi newcomers to Washington, Chalabi has worked for years in Washington cultivating friendships with key players like Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle.  Since 1986, Shea & Gardner has represented Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress in Washington for about $10,000 a month. One of the partners at Shea & Gardner is James Woolsey, the former CIA director.  Chalabi also gets help from Francis Brooke, a political consultant, and Riva Levinson of BKSH & Associates, the Washington firm founded by Charles Black, a long-time ally of President Bush.  Those contacts have paid off: At this year's State of the Union address, Chalabi sat in the VIP box with first lady Laura Bush.  Chalabi also was one of the few Iraqis permitted to meet face to face with Saddam Hussein in his cell in the hours after his capture in late December.  Chalabi has long been considered the favorite of Defense Department officials to lead Iraq's new government.  However, his star appears to be fading as Pentagon officials question some of the military intelligence he provided before the war and as Iraqis increasingly view Chalabi as a pawn for the United States.  Meanwhile, the State Department is thought to favor Pachachi, while the CIA backs Allawi. His main opponent in Washington is thought to be Chalabi, a distant relative.  Though Chalabi and Allawi both oppose an Iraqi government run by Islamics, they split over the structure of a new secular government.  Chalabi would like to rid the country of anything to do with Hussein's Baath Party, while Chalabi--a member of the Baath Party before it was hijacked by Hussein in the 1970s--believes the new government should be built upon the existing foundations.  ``There are options available to make use of the civil structures that are available in Iraq rather than throwing everything out,'' said R. Paul Stimers of Allawi's lobbying firm, Preston Gates.  Allawi, a neuroscientist by training, survived a vicious assassination attempt in the late 1970s when Hussein allies tried to axe him to death in his sleep. He later became a source of important--and sometimes suspect--intelligence  information to the CIA.  After the war, he was appointed to the interim Iraqi Governing Council and tapped to take charge of security for the country.  In Washington, Allawia and his British benefactor last fall hired Patrick Theros, a former U.S. ambassador to Qatar, to build his base of support among key Members of Congress and the Bush administration.  Theros runs a consulting firm,  urlLink Theros & Theros , with his wife and son out of their home in a leafy section of Northwest Washington.  With a total monthly budget that began at $122,000, Allawi brought on New York public relations agency  urlLink Brown Lloyd James Ltd. --a firm that once represented the Beatles--for $12,500 a month.  For lobbying work, Allawi tapped Washington lobbying shop Preston Gates for $100,000 a month, though the firm has since lowered its monthly retainer to less than $50,000.  According to contracts filed with the Justice Department, the firms will help Allawi ``gain U.S. government support for his policy suggestions for Iraq'' by ``explain[ing] his views on the security and political situation in Iraq.''  Theros, who is making about $10,000 a month from Allawi, plans to attend ``public forums, seminars, events and meetings which represent an opportunity'' to express Allawi's ideas.  Allawi's lobbying effort was expected to end this spring when the United States wasexpected to hand control over the government to Iraq.  But with the prospects of meeting that deadline dim, the lobbying and public relations campaign is expected to continue. =======================================================

      U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. from the Congressional Record May 21, 2001:  "I am not going to go on forever about it, but I just wanted to  mention that big oil give $3.2 million to the Bush campaign in the last  election and $25.6 million to Republicans overall, and other sectors of  the energy industry have been similarly generous.    If one thinks about it, we have the President himself who was  involved in oil ventures in Texas and abroad in the 1980s. He run  Arbusto Energy Firm, which after a few years become the Bush  Exploration Oil Company. It merged with two other companies.    Vice President Cheney, who was the former CEO of  urlLink Halliburton  [See page 18 of this link], the  world's largest oil fuel services company, in August of last year he  received $20.6 million for a sale of Halliburton stock. But it is not  just them. The National Security Adviser  urlLink Condoleeza Rice  served on the  board of directors for  urlLink Chevron , a major U.S. oil company, for 10 years.  Chevron gave GOP candidates and committees in the last cycles $758,000;  $224,000 to Republican Congressional candidates. The list goes on. The  Secretary of Commerce Evans who spent 25 years at  urlLink Tom Brown, Inc. , a  $1.2 billion Denver-based oil and gas company. We can mention the  Energy Secretary and the Interior Secretary. They were also big oil  money recipients when they ran for public office." ======================================================= U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich from the Congressional Record April 3, 2003:  "It is not news that this administration has deep-pocket connections  with big oil and defense companies. The President was CEO of Arbusto,  CEO of Spectrum 7, and on the board of directors at Harken Energy. The  Vice President was CEO of Halliburton. The Commerce Secretary was the  CEO of Tom Brown, Inc., an oil and gas exploration company. The  National Security Adviser was a director of Chevron Oil. The Veterans  Affairs Secretary was chief operating officer of Lockheed Martin.   Then there is the  urlLink Defense Policy Board , whose nine members have won  more than $76 billion in defense contracts in 2001 and 2002. There is  Mr. Perle, who until last week was chairman of the board, and has been  accused of profiting from the war in Iraq because of his corporate  connections with Trireme and Global Crossing."

      It's kind of interesting to note that Iraq's  urlLink Ministry of Oil   website is entirely in english. I'm sure that is to enable the Iraqis to get all the lucrative contracts.  The   urlLink Coalition Provisional Authority  website can be viewed in arabic, but the main link is in english.   urlLink Iraq Revenue Watch   looks like a interesting watchdog group. It is apparently being funded by George Soros  The United Nations also set up the  urlLink  International Advisory and Monitoring Board  website which hired some swiss company to do an audit on the  urlLink  Development Fund for Iraq.  The report should be out shortly, and it isn't positive.  Here's a BBC Article about the  urlLink   accounting report.   Here's the  urlLink  propaganda  for the Iraqi Interim Government. It tells who will be in charge of the interim puppet government.  See also  urlLink The Financial Times  page on Iraq.  Here are some reports by the General Accounting Office:  On  urlLink  Iraq's Transitional Law   On  urlLink  Iraq Contract Management   Where your  urlLink  tax dollars   are going.  Here's  urlLink  another.   And another   urlLink such link.

      The nice thing about being single is that you don't have to diet. I can eat whatever the fuck I want, and who cares if I get fat.  Oh, and you can also mindlessly flirt with as many men as you want, and they aren't afraid of flirting back. (They barely speak to you when you're married, and that always sucked.)   I should also remember that I probably fluked it with Richard. Most men are not that nice.  A wonderful friend of mine is mailing me a porn movie while the folks are away. (I won't mention his name in case someone is reading this who shouldn't be.)   Porn is good. That's how people stay single, right?  It certainly isn't the cats!!!

      Richard sent me a picture Peter emailed him from New York City. He's on a business trip there. Kane now lives there, so they were both in the photo.  You know, Richard was not only the sweetest husband on the plenet. He is also the sweetest ex-husband on the planet too. That was really nice of him to forward me their picture.   It's good to know people like him, because it makes it a hell of a lot harder to be cynical about people.

      After getting our credentials, John and I proceeded to the room where the caucus meeting would be. There were already 3 people waiting.  We introduced ourselves. It was Bob and Toni and Anka. I told them that I basically had reserved the room and the caucus would be whatever we made of it. I started by saying that we needed to organize a discussion on the internet, so that whatever we did would go beyond the convention. Bob said he had a website that we could do that at. I then ripped some sheets out of my notebook, and we started a sign-in list. We started by introducing ourselves and explaining why we were there. People just kept coming in. By the end of the meeting 82 people had signed in!!!  The discussion ranged from how to organize, to how the religious right is taking over our government, to whether all non-religious people we were smarter or more educated than everyone else, to how our public schools were a vehicle for religious idealogues to influence textbook review committees, to all the various secular groups that do exist in our state. I could go on and on. We just covered so much ground. It was amazing. There was so much energy in that room, and now that we have email addresses and a volunteer to organize a website, we can do anything.  At the end of the meeting, a woman came up to me and handed me her card and said, "I am mad and I have money." That bordered on surreal for me.  Anyway, I need to get this list typed up and sent to Bob soon.  But let me move on to the Progressive Populist Caucus meeting.

      Charles, John, and I drove up together. We went ahead and dropped by the  urlLink hostel .  The office wasn't open yet, so we hung around, which was good because Charles needed to see that hostels are not this austere military style housing he was think about.  A gentleman from Denmark, one from (was it Gabon?), and a girl from the US were playing dominoes in the common room. They were very friendly and having a great time.  I started to get Charles and John to play poker to kill some time, but then the hostel manager came back in. They seemed to have lost my reservation, but fortunately there was still one female bed left anyway.   So then we all piled back in the car and headed over to John and Charles's hotel. After getting them squared away, we walked over to the Hilton. Charles had thought that the initial reception was free, but I thought I remembered it costing $50. I was right. However, while we were there, we discovered that  urlLink Planned Parenthood  was hosting a little party, which was free. Man was that room packed with people!!! Their party was not only free, but they were giving free beer/wine to anyone who signed in.  And what a great organization to start with.   Then after talking to several people and amongst ourselves, we headed out. We decided to we would go over to the John Sharp party. Instead, we saw  urlLink David Van Os  talking to some people in the lobby of the hotel. We were listening to him for a while, and then we decided to help him carry some stuff up to the room.   David was trying to explain to some Nader/Kucinich supporters why we have to vote for Kerry. I like the way David tells people what he thinks, even when he knows it won't be popular with them.  On the other hand, when we got up to his room, he was telling me that he thinks I should not waste my time trying to convince the Nader people to support Kerry. That we need to focus on getting those disenfranchised democrats to the polls to just vote what they think.  It's kind of funny when I think about. I guess he and I are too much alike--we just are so passionate with our opinions that we have to tell people we disagree with why we think what we think. I think that is healthy though. Debate is good.  OK, so after talking to David, we went over to the John Sharp party. No sooner had we signed in, but I turned around and saw Charlie Jackson. He's the founder of  urlLink Texans For Peace.   I met Charlie in the  urlLink San Antonio Peace Coalition.   Anyway, Charlie organized and went to Iraq before the war. It was sad at the time. While they were there, they had a bad car accident, and at least one of their members died. I think Charlie had three broken ribs. He did get to see an Iraqi hospital though. Anyway, it was amazing to see him come back so tired and ill, but still fighting so passionately for peace.   But then he returned to Iraq last December to see how things were.   Now he says he is organizing to go back yet again. This time to help a group of Iraqi women organize a funding group to promote Iraqi business women.  Maybe there is something on his web page about it.   There was another lady from the  urlLink the Progressive Populist Caucus  (I can't remember her name) who was telling us about how soldiers coming back from Iraq were not having the steel fragments with uranium removed from their injuries (they are leaving the wounds open), because there was no official disposal procedures for where to put the contaminents. She also said that the military had some policy of not allowing private doctors into the military medical wards, because the regular doctors in the past had been so appauled by conditions that it was causing bad press.   When we left the party at about 12:30, we were venting with our black taxi driver about George Bush had destroyed the economy and our international relations and how they disenfranchised all the black voters in Florida. It always excites me when I see that the mainstream working class in Texas is every bit as pissed off with Bush as the activists. :)  So by the time we got back to The Four Seasons, it was almost 1AM. Rather than walk back to my car, which was parked in timbucktoo (to avoid parking charges), I just crashed on John and Charles's miniature sofa. Didn't sleep but about two hours.  But I had to get up pretty early, because my Secular Humanist Caucus was at 8:30AM.  Let me make a new entry about that meeting.

      My brother just called. After allowing me to babble for 30 minutes about the convention in Houston, he announces that I am going to be an aunt!!! Bloody hell!!!  What didn't the bugger interrupt me?  On the other hand, maybe if we can get that bastard out of the White House, perhaps my future niece or nephew will have fighting chance in this world.  I am really happy with our new state chair Charles Soechting. They already have videos of the speeches on their website. From yesterday!!!  How is that for organized?    urlLink Dennis Kucinich  (in Quicktime) had a really nice speech.  I like the reference he made to George Washington urlLink John Edwards  had an equally energizing speech the night before.  Hmm.....I seem to be able to edit my blog, but it isn't coming up at the moment.  OK, I guess I should write about the convention.  Let me start up a new entry, 'cause this one is mainly about video feeds and my future auntdom.

      I'm exhausted, so I will fill you in tomorrow. However, let me just say I feel very good about the convention. I was hoping for at least 5-10 people to show up at my secular humanist caucus. We had 82 people sign in, a great debate, and a volunteer for setting up a discussion forum on his website.  One lady after the meeting came up to me. She handed me her business card and said, "I'm mad, and I've got money." I could have replied to her, "I'm mad, and I have no money." Instead I just took her card and thanked her.   Anyway, the discussion was great, and I think we have the potential to really develop this caucus into something not only cool, but powerful.  I think this could turn into a real force for secularism in the state of Texas.   Anyway, o there is a lot to report from the convention. More later. :)

       urlLink Ryan  wrote me this morning that Bill Moyers was going to be on  urlLink Air America's  Unfiltered. Unfortunately I was a bad, bad girl last night and stayed up into the wee hours (I would say the wee wee hours of the morning, but that would give the wrong impression), and so I missed it.  They have a section of on their website for an audio archives, but it's a coming soon sort of thing. I emailed them and asked them to make sure that they included the Bill Moyers interview in their archives, because he is the greatest.  Anyway, thanks again to  urlLink Ryan  for that tip. If anyone else knows about any Bill Moyers interviews (or cool things like that), let me know.

      The songs listed under 2004 must just be experimental files, because I just found a better version of the one I liked under the 2003 sound files. Plus the 2003 files are just a million times better. As I come across ones that sound cool or semi-cool. Tracks 5 and 3 are the coolest so far, I think. (I've only gotten to track 7 so far.)  DDT (2003) Track Five   urlLink http://media.ddt.ru/mp3/2003a/05.mp3   DDT (2003) Track Three  urlLink http://media.ddt.ru/mp3/2003a/03.mp3   DDT (2003) Track Four  urlLink http://media.ddt.ru/mp3/2003a/04.mp3   DDT (2003) Track Eight  urlLink http://media.ddt.ru/mp3/2003a/08.mp3   DDT (2003) Track Six  urlLink http://media.ddt.ru/mp3/2003a/06.mp3   DDT (2003) Track Seven  urlLink http://media.ddt.ru/mp3/2003a/07.mp3   But all their songs are available at  urlLink http://www.ddt.ru/dsc/

      I just had a weird and rather violent dream this morning. It was very hazy. More of a concept dream than anything super visual.  Some guy meets some woman and has sex with her. He doesn't realize it, but she's a golddigger type who just wants to use him or at least destroy him. He leaves town and asks her to look after his kids.    She invites another guy to his apartment and has sex with him, but while they are embracing she takes a gun to the back of the strangers head. She  tells him that she is going to blow his brains out. Except the women is too stupid to realize that if she facing him and she has the gun wrapped around the two of them from behind that she is herself in the line of fire. So she shootsand blows both their brains out. It's kind of messy.  The kids call the police and the rest is sort of like one of those cop shows where  they are cleaning all the mess. I think the kids are relieved, because they knew she was a bitch. That's when I woke up.   It's funny. I was looking at a former friends blog yesterday, and he had just had a very serene dream, and then I dream this rather violent and perverse dream.  Dream interpretation time: After rethinking things, I believe this dream was my subconscious mind's way of reassuring me that evil people often shoot themselves in the feet (or in this case the head.) OK, innocents get killed in the process, but what the hey (as long as you can get movie passes to see the "true story....".)

      Have you listened to the words to "Killing Me Softly?" A lot of people don't, but do listen sometimes. It's a beautiful:  "He sang as if he knew me In all my dark despair, And then he looked right through me, As if I weren't there...."

      Gosh, all this singing driving back and forth to and from Austin must have done good for my voice. I have been singing with my CDs and my singing's at its prime. Too bad it wasn't in its prime when I recorded my song or when I was singing at Borders or that pizza restaurant.   The only time my voice was really in it's prime in public was when Richard and I sang at that kareoke bar in Wellington and when I sang the "Seeräuber Jenny" in college and when Robert Boone and I sang that Minuet Chretian (sp?) duet in Troubadores. Man, we were fucking good!  Robert and I were pissed that they had taken our favourite song off the playlist, so after the group performed all the other songs in choral style, Mark's mother disbands the group, but Robert starts singing the song out of the blue. He waves at me to join in. So I joined and we started singing it as a duet (no instruments--but we were good!) Robert was a fucking good singer, and my voice complimented his rather well. :) So Mark's mom put it back on the list to sing as our special duet. That was wonderful.   An uncontaminated memory. :) It's nice to think I still have some.  I have tried to relive so many memories that I killed several memories in the process. You can't ever turn back the clock.   And now the CD is playing "Once Upon A Time." What a perfect song to end with thinking about Robert. I do wonder what happened to him.  "I wonder where you are. I wonder if you think about me Once upon a time in your wildest dreams."

      Thursday I head to Houston with Charles and John for the Democratic State Convention. Naturally, I feel a bit odd about it since Nick lives in Houston. He's supposed to be out of town during the convention. I hope he sticks to that plan, because he really hurt me. Although I have been feeling a bit better about it the last week .   Been listening to my CD of mellow songs that I put together in New Zealand. Anyway the last 3 songs remind me of that. I had  "I'll Never Fall In Love Again" followed by "No More Lies" followed by "I'm Not That Man Anymore."   I have fantasized singing "I'm Not That Woman Anymore" in public some day when I am an infamous pop singer (yeah right):  "I'm not that girl anymore I'm not gonna throw my heart away. That's not me anymore. Baby, I've changed...."  I think Richard actually recorded me singing that in New Zealand. I wonder if he still has that. :) I recall him saying I sounded better than the original, but then I don't think he's exactly a Survivor fan.  Anyway, I probably won't see Nick, but it still kind of sucks that the convention is going to be there. What's more I noticed that my youth hostel is about a mile from his house. :(   C'est la vie, eh? Rough translation: typical.

      I was just trying to remember the other NZ beer I really liked there. I remembered Monteith's  urlLink http://www.monteiths.co.nz/ , but I finally remembered the other beer. That was Mac's Gold.  urlLink http://www.macs.co.nz/   Now THOSE are good beers.  I have not seen either in the United States. Instead you see the kiwi equivalents of Budweiser or Miller Genuine Draught. However, like the United States, New Zealand also has some smaller breweries, which are much better.  But next time you go to your local exotic beer pub, be sure to ask if they can try to order these brands. Both are distributed in New Zealand through larger suppliers (unlike some microbreweries.) Unfortunately New Zealand currently only seems to be exporting their shit to the United States, but that is probably because once they taste our shit they assume we'd never enjoy their good beers.  You might see Steinlager or something like that here. But the point to getting beer exported is because some of us would rather have quality beer, so why send those of us with taste the crap?

      I have been reading a gentleman's blog in Pennsylvania recently. I want to recommend it, because it's really good. Especially now that he has opened it up for comments.   It's  urlLink http://ladypoverty.blogspot.com   Another good blog is Ken Kinder's   urlLink http://www.kenkinder.com   They both post links to interesting things and then give inciteful commentary. Nothing at all like my blog. I don't have the discipline for that.  But it's just kind of nice to be able to have some good sources, who filter through all the garbage out there and come up with interesting stuff.  Because frankly I don't have the energy these days to sift through all the shit out there.   Mom sends me good articles, and Butler sometimes does. It's not that I don't manage to get a healthy dose of good info. John just posted a really interesting perspective on Reagan from truthout.org from William Rivers Pitt:  urlLink http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/060704A.shtml   It's worth a read. Alyssa posts good things to the Peace Coalition listserve. I wish she had a blog. Maybe I should suggest it to her.   Seems like there must be options for making links on my blog. I should these good ones

      Bill Moyers had an interview with  Your Call Radio , which was quite good on May 10th. He's my biggest hero and has been for years and years.   urlLink http://www.yourcallradio.org/archive/051004.ram   He also had an interview on NPR not too long ago:   urlLink http://www.npr.org/dmg/dmg.php?prgCode=FA&showDate=13-May-2004&segNum=1&NPRMediaPref=RM  And here's a speech he gave last year:   urlLink http://demo.xntec.com/projects/billmoyer/billmoyer_48m.asx    And another:   urlLink http://www.freepress.net/conference/multimedia/Moyers110803.mp3   And another:   urlLink http://www.npr.org/dmg/dmg.php?prgCode=ME&showDate=30-Aug-2002&segNum=6&NPROldMediaPref=RM    urlLink http://www.npr.org/dmg/dmg.php?prgCode=ATC&showDate=18-Jan-2002&segNum=7&mediaPref=RM

      I was listening to a program off the Your Call Radio website. The episode was talking to some journalists about how the media has dealt with Iraq. One of the interesting points this one woman made was the idea that Americans and our media tend to treat things in the news as events rather than considering systemic or structural flaws.   I guess that is more like addressing the byproducts of things, but never really getting at root causes. I think that is probably true. I guess the question should then be why we do that.

      Thinking about vasectomies returns me to the question of whether I want children or not. Insofar as I am 35, I guess I should start thinking about this because I am running out of time if I do.  I have only met about 4 guys in my life, where I actually thought to myself: "I could see myself making babies with this guy."  For starters, I think the world is overpopulated anyway. Plus, I hate the idea of that level of responsibility.  So what kind of men inspire maternal instincts in me? Super creative intelligence does it. Generally it's a mix of brilliant debating skills, along with a genius sense of humor and an appreciation for irony and word play. A joy for experimentation and a natural curiosity.  And a sense of fun and playfulness. And an appreciation for quality. Interestingly enough, accomplishment doesn't come into it, although ambition doesn't hurt.  When I think about it, the guys I liked that way were not passive. The humdrum tv addicts would not inspire babymaking in me, although if Richard had modified just a few bad habits and wanted babies, I would probably would have accomodated him.  Oh,  and macho moron types need not apply. I prefer guys to be sweet and sensitive.  So whereas I don't normally think I want to be a mom, I have thought about it from time to time with certain guys. There are just guys who bring out the joy of creativity, and that could extend to creating life. It's just that this applies to so few guys it's hardly worth mentioning, unless I am discussing it with one of them.  But normally I don't want to have babies because I think they would interfere with some of my goals of self actualization. I think with the wrong father, they would be a lot of responsibility and a major hassle. I don't feel like I have achieved all that I want to achieve for myself.   So whereas I usually just tell folks I don't want children, it's not like I have never considered it as an option. It's just EXTREMELY rare for me to think that way.  And when I do feel this way about the guy, I usually just ask what he wants because I'd want to be with that person irregardless of whether we made babies or not.

      Well,  I took a walk, but I wasn't very inspired to write anything today.  Here's the one line I came up with:  You're miserable; I have to laugh. You pitched the wheat to save the chaff.  I think that might make a good introductory line to a song.  By the way, would someone please post a comment in my blog, so I know someone is out there.

      I think I may make a practice of writing a poem or song every day. They tell writers that they should write every day. Maybe if I wrote something every day, then I would have enough material to throw away the crap and still have something decent left over. Just the law of averages. On the other hand, it might stifle my spontaneity.  But it's probably worth an experiment at least.  If it doesn't work for me, I'm sure I'll drop it.  Besides, I have lots of opinions right now, which I have not put to verse.

      Ahhhch! My shoulders hurt. One should never clean the house for several hours straight. Work should be reserved for people with low self esteem who get a self righteous, masochistic kick out of it.  Piss and moan, piss and moan.  Still, it's so much easier to make headway cleaning the house when I am by myself.  A few more months of this, and I might actually control the house rather than it controlling me. Alas, the folks will be home in about a week.  Still, I AM making headway. Yippy skippy!!!  Does some sexy casanova want to come fall in love with me and sweep me off on some magical mystery tour across the planet?  I know I should be dedicating the next several months to getting Kerry elected, but gosh I could use a vacation to another exotic country or culture.  And no museums or cathedrals, unless they are really cool ones like the British Museum or that clock museum in Vienna. I also like museums with medieval weapons and armour, because it's kind of  freaky to imagine that people actually used that stuff on other people. And it's a reminder just how savage war is. Not exactly D&D.  But the main thing to the sexy casanova is I need a young, energetic playmate. PLAYMATE is the operative word. Cause I'm still 35 and need to have more fun.

      Well, I slept almost the whole day away.  According to the BBC, people who sleep longer than 8 hours on average tend to live shorter lives. But then according to that Depeche Mode song (I think it was Depeche Mode) or maybe it was Billy Joel--anyway the good die young. Maybe it was both--I think it's a recurring theme.  Now that I think about it, I think the Depeche Mode song I'm thinking about was a slam at the concept of God with an example of a young person dying.  Blasphemous Rumours, I believe it's called. :) I should go look for that cassette tape. My CD player died today. Pout. The iMac plays CDs, but not as well.  Anyway, to compensate for sleeping all day, I worked on cleaning the shower. It was gross. We have a terrible problem with limestone/calcium here in San Antonio. One of the drawbacks of an aquifer for water, I guess. I guess the other drawback are gallstones.   In a bout of free thought, gallstones always remind me of a quote from that german Mad Magazine I bought in the 80s when I visited Germany the first time:  "Lieber Einstein in der Schule als zwei Steine in der Galle."  It's a bad pun. It means roughly--Prefer Einstein (or one stone) in the school to two stones in the gall.    Granted, it's much funnier in German. Definitely a had to be there joke. :-)  But that always comes to mind now when I hear or think about gallstones.  I had a dream about Robert Boone today. I dreamed that I met him in London after all these years. He was working in some fancy building. Anyway, he really looked cute after so many years. Even a little cuter than he did in college. I think he'd lost his beer belly or something. Ha ha ha.  But he went with us to some fancy place to eat, where I found tons of pennies on the ground in the parking lot, but they were british pennies of course, which made it even cooler.  I started to wonder if that wasn't the way they tipped the valets in London, because there were so many of them, but Robert was leaving a tip on the windscreen of the car and assured me that that was how it was done.  Of course, I've been to London in real life and know this is all fantasy, but it made for a fun dream. It was especially nice to see Robert again after so many years. :-)  And he was glad to see me too, so that was nice as well. Of course, I woke up after that, but it was such a nice dream that I had to sleep the rest of the day in hopes of having some equally pleasant dreams. That was the best one, but I do enjoy sleeping.   I woke up sore and with a headache from sleeping too long, but actually felt a bit happier, so I must have had some other reassuring dreams too.   I guess it is a bit pathetic when you enjoy sleep more than reality. That's probably the real reason why people who sleep a lot don't live as long. It probably gets down to why we want to sleep to start with. I certainly know that I like to sleep more when I am depressed or something, but I am not adverse to recreational sleeping as well.   Xiaoqin and I were talking once about how much we both really love to sleep. I think maybe it is yet another form of mental masturbation. Because they say that people's minds are more active when they sleep, and some of these dreams can be very creative.  So I think that even though you don't tend to remember everything from when you sleep does not preclude the possibility that it is a hedonistic experience. I tend to think it is because most of the people I know who enjoy sleep like I do are hedonists in other ways.

      Just listened to Gore, Carter, and Clinton, and I have to say that I liked Gore's speech the best. Here are some clever lines from Gore's speech:  "I prefer to focus on the future because I know from my own experience that America is a land of opportunity, where every little boy and girl has a chance to grow up and win the popular vote."  "Let's make sure not only that the Supreme Court does not pick the next President, but also that this President is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court."  Anyway, I won't give the rest away. I just thought it was a good speech.    urlLink Al Gore's Speech to Democratic National Convention    urlLink  Transcript    urlLink President Carter's Speech to Democratic National Convention    urlLink Transcript    urlLink President Bill Clinton's Speech to Democratic National Convention    urlLink Transcript

      I'm gonna make links from the Presidential debates for all the comments Kerry made, so we can piece together some coherent distinctions between what he stands for and what Bush stands for.  The first link is from the the April 9, 2003 Children's Defense Forum:   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/precinct3035/kerry1.html   The forum can be seen in its entirety at:   urlLink rtsp://video.c-span.org/fdrive/c04_040903_forum.rm   The second link is from the the June 27, 2003 League of Conservation Voters Forum:   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/precinct3035/kerry2.html    urlLink rtsp://video.c-span.org/project/c04/c04062603_conservationleague.rm   The third link is from the the August 5, 2003 AFL-CIO Presidential Forum:   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/precinct3035/kerry3.html    urlLink rtsp://video.c-span.org/project/c04/c04080503_aflcio2.rm   OK, I couldn't just copy and paste for this NAACP forum from July 14, 2004. I couldn't find a transcript for it, so I stayed up all last night typing Kerry's comments up. I think he is actually more specific in this debate than in a lot of them, so I recommend reading it. And not just because that was a pain in the butt.    urlLink http://www.geocities.com/precinct3035/kerry4.html    urlLink http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/ebms/naacp2003/presidential_candidates_high.wvx   More later....

      Sheryl Zettner 5665 Verbena St San Antonio, Texas 78240 210-561-9506  Dear Editor,  Last Thursday Representative Corrine Brown tried to get Congress to allow the UN to monitor our upcoming elections. When they ignored her request, she described the 2000 election as a "coup d'tat." The result was a vote to have her comments completely stricken from the public record.  We're about to have an election with voting machines where we can't even inspect the programming code because of proprietary concerns. Only a limited number of vendors have been ok'd by our partisan Secretary of State, including Diebold (that infamous company where the CEO promised to help deliver the election to Bush.) No paper trail, so no proof of how people voted. In a state that just re-gerrymandered the borders to ensure further Republican victories. We live in not only a nation, but a state where all three branches of government are controlled by the same party. A party that used to oppose communism, because it was "anti-democratic." So much for balance of powers.  A government that has tried to further concentrate the media, so that there is less information for the public to make its democratic choices by. A representative in Congress who just offered a "Democracy in Congress Act," because he was sick of the dominant party abusing its power. Like keeping a vote open after everyone has already voted in order to change the decision of it.  Then Homeland Security is trying to get the power to "postpone" our election in case of another "terrorist threat." I think the question is just how badly Americans want democracy.  Are we really that complaisant? I hope not--I don't want to have to move to Switzerland once Americans have abdicated all their rights and responsibilities.  Sincerely,  Sheryl Zettner

      How many days ago was it that the Senate Intelligence Committee reported that the information that we used to justify attacking Iraq was faulty?  With Senator Rockefellar suggestion that the Bush administration pressured the CIA into its findings to justify their pre-determined decision. But now  urlLink the 9/11 commission is pointing the finger at Iran  , because al-Qaeda supposedly spent time in Iran.    Has everyone forgotten that al-Qaeda spent time in the US before they attacked us as well? We were "harbouring al-Qaeda" as well. They not only spent time here, but they enrolled in the flight training schools here that allowed them to carry out the attack. Isn't it time to bomb the US in retaliation? We could destroy the infrastructure of our society, depose the evil dictators in the White House, and restore democracy to the civilized world all in one swoop.  I guess the main thing to consider though is where the oil is. I would gather based on our experience in the Middle East that the most terrorists are probably concentrated in oil states such as Texas and Alaska.

      I was just watching a conference for the  urlLink UN Economic and Social Council .  I guess they are the arm of the UN that tries to deal with world economic issues.  Apparently, they have been at this for some time, but are actually regressing from their goals. The focus this time are the least developed countries.   urlLink Rubens Ricupero  gave the best explanation I've heard so far, but then I have only gotten halfway through the feed.  He says that the few least developed countries that are actually meeting goals set at previous conferences are doing so by selling off their oil reserves. He says that they are selling these commodities rather than developing an agricultural sector.   So effectively they must be dependent on trade to survive, which it seems to me would allow foreign economies to pay less than the oil is worth, but at the same time they are having to sell off their valuable assets to make ends meet. Sounds a little like rich countries exploiting their poverty to get at the oil. Maybe I am just cynical.

      The last couple of days I have been having problems with Blogger. What is odd is that I am not having problems in Mom's computer  Except it doesn't seem to be word wrapping.  Drove to Austin today to show support as they presented the petition for getting the paper trail for the election.  They had the meeting in a dinky little room, so most of us were standing in the hallway, where you couldn't hear anything.  However, I was sure to go in and add my name after the meeting was over.  Anyway, Steve and Sara had to work tomorrow, so I just drove back at about 11PM ish.  I'm a bit bummed that I can get through to Blogger on Mom's computer, because that kind of implies that something has happened to cause problems on my machine.  I don't like doing things on computers running Linux. Linux sucks. :(  Like the fact the word wrap doesn't appear to be working.  Is it going publish that way? Probably. :(  I should go to bed.

      Ah, at last C-Span has fixed their link. The Dean Nader debate is now availble for watching. Yeah!!!!   urlLink rtsp://video.c-span.org/project/c04/c04070904_naderdean.rm?start=7:53   Really interesting debate. Since I prefer Howard Dean's perspective, I suppose I should start by mentioning some ideas that Nader said, which I considered appealing. For starters, I liked his idea of making election day a public holiday. Seems like that would demonstrate the importance of the day and make it much easier for people to vote. Furthermore, I heard that the police were barricading certain areas in Florida in the last election in order to discourage black people from voting. If people had the whole day to vote, then that would be a less effective tactic. So I do appreciate that suggestion.   Now in terms of Nader attracting conservatives as well as liberals. If this were truely where he expected to get his base votes, then why were Nader's arguements in this debate almost exclusively targeted at Kerry and the Democratic Party? He barely mentioned Bush. You would think Bush was a saint.    If you recall the democratic debates, the candidates always attacked the guy at the forefront and the other candidates who they suspected were drawing votes away from themselves. Nader doesn't need to attack Bush, because Bush's support is not reachable to him.   In terms of the threshhold to participate in the presidential debates. I think having a threshhold is perfectly reasonable. If you look at  urlLink Vote Smart's list of Presidential candidates , you will see there is a very legitimate reason for limiting the number of people who can participate in the debates.  There are about 175 candidates on their list running for President. I'm sure we could have a grand debate and include every one. They could all announce their names and the debate would be over from lack of time.  One thing that Nader said pissed me off. He said:  "Secondly, people should think electoral college, as long as we're saddled with it, and if you're in Texas you can easily vote your conscience. You can vote for the Nader Cameo ticket, because the democrats are abandoning Texas at the Presidential level and of course hurting their slate of candidates all the way down to city council..."   For starters, in Texas we do not see our democratic campaign here as about winning Texas. We see it as being about making George W. Bush spend his money to protect his base. If Bush starts slipping in Texas, then he will have to spend money here. Otherwise, it will look very bad for him when the media, who love to make hay about things, announces that he is loosing ground in the one state everyone figures is an inevitable win.    And despite the fact that Nader is correct that the DNC and the Kerry campaign have abandoned us financially (just like the Gore campaign did), it will just make our victory that much sweeter when Texas goes Democrat this year. There are some Greens still holding out in Texas, but for the most part the liberal base here is united in our determination to take out Bush. And we are going to send a message to the world that Texas isn't quite as insane as the Bush folks and the Nader folks think. Texas is not a lost cause.  I worked for one of these campaigns that Nader mentioned, and let me tell you, David Van Os is actually counting on the anti-Bush backlash here in Texas to win his campaign. Texas is not a done deal for Bush. David says everywhere he goes in Texas people support him when he just says what he thinks about George W. Bush.   We in Texas helped create the monster, and we will also help defeat him as well. And Texas is a lot of electoral votes, so it will be a beautiful victory too.  And this idea of vote Nader because it doesn't matter cynicism just pisses me off.  There were several other issues that came up in the debate. I liked that question where the lady asked Nader his plan for reaching 270 electoral votes. He didn't have one.  I also thought that the differences on the referendum issue were interesting. I should bring that up in  urlLink Ryan's blog , because he just emailed me that he has a fresh entry about the debate, so I shouldn't state all my opinions here. :)

      Got yet another email comparing Bush to the Germans with bits of the german language inserted in .   Yes the Nazis were Germans, but I am getting kind of sick of this cultural bigotry. Right now people live longer in Germany than they do here. The German government got ranked slightly less corrupt n Transparency International's corruption index than we did. They went along and intregrated their monetary system with the Euro. They opposed our war in Iraq. They have a fantastic public transportation system, etc.   Seems to me that fascism is about nationalism. The language of nationalism right now is English. For that matter, they speak german in Switzerland, which has always had an anti-aggression policy.  Maybe I'm just being fussy because my back hurts, but it annoys me.   Bush has been going around and quoting that bit from the bible about not complaining about a speck in your neighbors eye while ignoring the log in your own. The biggest irony is that he has been using the quote in a defensive posture to suggest that he's the one with the speck, so that he can in fact ignore the log in his own.  But even if Bush has been abusing the doctrine that way, I think it's a good quote. The same quote is a call against the very nationalism he promotes and the  bad policies he perpetuates through it.   I wonder if there have been any studies ranking nations relative to nationalism, because that is the real enemy. The idea that if you are born in country X that you are by default better than someone born in country Y. Success by association. America has been jingoistic all my life. To me that is a sign of failure.  Mehrdad mentioned a segment from the Bertolt Brecht play to me the other day, which I noticed in  urlLink a cool essay  I had received when I was looking through some old emails, but it's worth quoting here:  "ANDREA: Unhappy the land that has no heroes! . . . GALILEO: No, unhappy the land that needs heroes."  But getting back to my point about the bigotry behind language, I'd like to point out that the original Brecht quote was auf deutsch:   Andrea: "Unglücklich das Land, das keine Helden hat!"....Galileo: "Unglücklich das Land, das Helden nötig hat."

      Albert Camus figured that every once and a while we get into a mode where things seem very absurd, and that's supposed to tell us it's time to recalibrate our thinking.  The problem is that sometimes your alternative options seem equally absurd.   I'm that way with knowledge sometimes. I go on little information treasure hunts just to keep my mind busy sometimes.  A lot of it is pointless.  I mean, there could be advantages. If I ever meet anyone from the Republic of Kalmykia walking down the street, or if I ever have money, I can now trade in the Saudi stock exchange. I can see that happening real soon.  On the other hand, considering that I am allergic to shampoos, I'm glad I discovered the virtues of coconut based soaps.  So it's not like all knowledge that was labor intensive has been useless. Just most of it.

       urlLink Ryan  had an interesting link of an interview between Michael Moore and Howard Stern on his site.   Moore said he had said in several interviews that he figured the reason that Disney canned him was because the saudi royal family owned 23% of Disney, but they kept censoring those comments out.  So I wanted to look into that. This is the article I finally posted in Ryan's comments section, which I thought best explained that connection:   urlLink http://www.talkdisney.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21298    So if you have seen the movie, this supports one theory as to why Disney might not have wanted to show it after paying to have it made.

      I was thinking-- I bet my parents have almost been gone a month. Could that be right?   Much as I enjoy my mom's company, I have enjoyed the seclusion too. I'm such a weird mix of people person who loves loud energy, but also a private person who loves quiet and solitude.   I guess it's like children. I love children if I can play with them and give them back to their parents after a period of time. so I meam, I love getting out and being around people and going crazy, attending a wild party or a discussion group or some other social function, but then I want to able to then come home to a private, quiet house with no neighbors,where I can feel completely free in my secluded abode.  My parents picked the best property--both lots on each side of us are empty. It's a humongous property. They can't hardly see the house from the street. The only drawback is that if someone came and murdered me, no one would know for ages.  They'd just wondered why Sheryl stopped chatting on the internet. Beyond that. it's great.

      So apparently Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate. No real surprise there.  See the video:   urlLink Kerry and Edwards Video   Is it my browser, or are there whole segments of this clip that are missing the picture part?  And an  urlLink Interview with Bill Clinton

      Roberto sent me this:  How to start your week with a positive outlook:  1. Open a new file on your computer.  2. Name it  "George W. Bush."  3. Send it to the trash.  4. Empty the trash  5. Your PC will ask you: "Do you really want to get rid of George W. Bush?"  6. Answer calmly, "Yes," and press the mouse button firmly.

      Today I met with Trish and Barbara. Trish has been my mom's best friend for years and years.  They know each other from the SA Writer's Guild. Anyway, a while back another friend named Jackie decided Mom wasn't getting out enough, so they decided to have monthly get togethers at little restaurants to work on writing.  I think I asked if I could go once, because I wanted some help on my translation. I was really touched they invited this time, because Mom and Dad are on vacation.   I really enjoy it.  I like getting feedback on my writing and translating, and I like suggeting things on what everyone else is going.  I wonder if I could be a writer like Mom. Writing things that long would require a bit of discipline. I like writing short things.  Seeing how much I can get jammed into a song or poem or letter to the editor.  Maybe I am just lazy. Actually there's no maybe about that. :(

      You know, according to the party rules we supposedly voted for a Presidential elector in our senate caucus meeting, but I sure as hell don't remember that. Now granted, I was thinking up my speech to run for the Rules committee through part of the speeches, but I was still listening. I really don't remember that being on our agenda.  I'll have to do that in 4 years time if there's still a democracy involved, if I am still living in Texas, and if I still have an interest by them. Geez, I'd be 39. Ouch!  Maybe I should just tell the youngins how to get involved, so it doesn't take them 20 years to figure out the system.  I just emailed Ann Marie and asked her who we elected. Somewhere around here I should have the typed out agenda they gave up. It should say.  Party Rules on Electors:  10. Election of Presidential Elector Candidates. At its State Convention, in presidential years, the Party shall nominate as many Presidential Elector candi-dates as the total number of U.S. Senators and U.S. Representatives to which the state legally is entitled at that time. (a) Qualifications. The qualifications for Presiden-tial Elector candidates shall be the same as those prescribed for Party membership in Article II.B of these Rules. Legally, however, a Presidential Elector may not be a member of the United States Congress or anyone who “holds any other federal office of profit or trust.” (Texas Elec-tion Code §192.002) (b) Duties. The duties of Presidential Electors shall be to meet in the Capitol Building at Austin on the first Monday after the second Wednes-day in December following their election (or at such other time and place as may be required by law), and to vote for President and Vice President of the United States, making such re-turn thereof as is required by federal law. (c) Election Procedure. Presidential Elector candi-dates shall be chosen in the following manner: (1) Each Senatorial District Caucus shall elect by majority vote one candidate for Presiden-tial Elector. If Texas is entitled to more than 31 Electors, each senatorial district shall be entitled to one Elector and the remaining Elector positions shall go to the senatorial districts with the highest vote for the Demo-cratic nominee in the preceding presidential election in descending order until all posi-tions are allocated. (2) The names of all Electors so chosen by the Senatorial District Caucuses shall be sub-mitted to the Convention’s Permanent Nominations Committee for SDEC mem-bers. The Committee shall compile a list of these Electors to report to the Conven-tion and shall make any additional nomi-nations or any determinations by lot nec-essary to make the slate numerically cor-rect. The required number of Presidential Elector candidates shall be certified to the Secretary of State by the State Chair and Secretary at least 60 days before the elec-tion. (Texas Election Code § 192.031) (d) Affidavit. After the Party’s National Convention and prior to September 1, each Presidential Elec-tor candidate shall file with the State Chair a writ-ten affidavit attesting the intention to support the Party’s Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees. Any Elector candidate chosen at the State Convention who fails to file such an affi-davit shall be replaced by the SDEC with an Elec-tor from the same senatorial district. (e) Vacancies. If for any cause, before the General Election, a Party’s chosen Elector becomes le-gally disqualified, the State Chair shall certify the replacement name and address to the Sec-retary of State. If for any cause, after the Gen-eral Election, a Party’s chosen Elector fails to attend the meeting of the Electors and vote as required by law, or if an Elector becomes le-gally disqualified, a majority of the qualified Electors present after having convened may ap-point a successor and shall report such action immediately to the Secretary of State.

      The data below suggests that the final contestants in the best country contest go to: 1. Iceland 2. Sweden 3. Australia 4. Norway 5. Switzerland  My vote goes to Switzerland.  Iceland, Sweden, and Norway are too far North; they'd be too cold. Australia is too far away from anything. Plus, Switzerland is a peaceful country.  And it is centrally located in Europe, so that you could travel around to lots of other countries if you got bored. Plus Zurich is gorgeous, and I know german well enough to get by. :) Come to think of it, all my swiss experiences were positive. They actually abide by pedestrian right of way there.  So that's where I'll have to apply for political asylum if Bush gets another term in office.

      Let's not forgot that all the bullshit our government has gotten by with would never have been possible with a truely proactive media investigating the BS and exposing it for what it is.  Got this from a link off a Common Cause bulletin:  "The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia told the FCC to reconsider cross-ownership rules that would have permitted more combinations of daily newspaper, radio and TV outlets in single markets. It also sent back for reconsideration rules that would let broadcasters own two or even three TV stations in a local market."  Yeah!!!!!   urlLink http://www.mediachannel.org/views/dissector/affalert221.shtml   Official court documents on the case:   urlLink http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/staymotion/Petition.htm   If you have considerably more energy than I do and want to scare Michael Powell, you should contact the FCC just to make them nervous.

      Dear Senator Kennedy:   Question:  I believe you are in the Senate Armed Services Committee. I know you and Senator Byrd both voted against authorizing Bush to invade Iraq. I hope you will comment on some info I've been looking at.   Last year I saw Chuck Spinney, who used to work for the Pentagon, on Bill Moyer's show NOW.  In that interview, Moyers said that "...in fiscal year 2000, the Defense Department's own inspector general found that the Pentagon could not account for more than $1 trillion..." I was looking on the Inspector General's website.There are so many reports it's hard to know where to look, but I did notice in a 1999  report, they say that they could account for $7.6 trillion in 1999.   I thought it was bad enough when I saw on a site with procurement figures that we spent $208,963,563,145 in 2003 while the procurement figures for 1999 were only $125,037,045,000.    Then there are the benefactors. I was looking at the proxy statement for Lockheed Martin. If we use 1999 for comparison sake, then CEO Vance Coffman was "compensated" $1,635,929 that year versus $14,137,840 in 2003.  An over 850% increase. Even scarier when you consider what percentage of the company's earnings are from government contracts and the decline in the airline industry following September 11th.   When you look at the FEC commission's website, workers at Lockheed Martin are padding the elections campaigns of their political favorites with more money than I could ever dream of.   When I was in the peace movement, I suggested that we should form a peace PAC to at least compensate peace politicians in a token fashion. Yet when I mentioned setting up such a PAC, most people in our group scoffed at the idea. They seemed afraid of taking part in a system that they saw as corrupt. After all, how can you be external to the problem if you are participating in it in order to try and fix it? Basically the same motive for supporting the Green party.   They argued that I was being "political." Also, our peace group was meeting in a church, and they were afraid of endangering that church's tax exempt status. So instead they had their marches and raised a ton of money to buy a Not In Our Name ad in our city's republican owned newspaper.   Chuck Spinney referred to the problem as the "military industrial Congressional complex." He says that folks in Congress don't fix it, because they benefit from it.  Yet you voted against Bush's war powers to invade Iraq, so I donated to your campaign and am interested in your opinion on the subject.   Thank You,   Sheryl Zettner  ===================================================== For some scary incite into this problem, take a looksy at these links:  Department of Defense Inspector General Audit Reports:  urlLink http://www.dodig.osd.mil/audit/reports/   Procurement Statistics for US Military:  urlLink http://www.dior.whs.mil/peidhome/procstat/procstat.htm   Interview With Chuck Spinney:  urlLink http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript245_full.html

      I was looking to see what the folks from  urlLink Napoleon Boulevard   were up to, and I found this sample sound file. Sounds almost like a mix of peruvian and greek folk music with a slight hint arab music thrown in for good luck. :)   urlLink Róbert Erdész's album Meeting Point   I just found a site with sound samples from Solaris, which mostly contained members in Napoleon Boulevard, but it's a completely different sound.  :( Kind of like the 2010 version of Rush. I liked some of the Rush albums , but I don't like those instrumental semi-metal sounds. Oh well.

      I want to know what my palms say about me. To be honest, I haven't looked into palmistry much, and I have never spent money to have my palsm read. Still, I think it would be amusing to see what someone who actually takes it all seriously would say about my palms.  They are more like spider webs. A million zillion lines going all over the place. I do have the three major lines they mention, but I also have lots of vertical lines going through them. It looks more like a funky fractal design than any standard palm interpretations. Kind of like dendrites. Just a bunch funky little lines going off on their own little tangents. Maybe it is symbolic: chaos. Hahahahaha.

      My dad just came in and drained me. I really don't like being talked at.  That's how Steve feels about me when I talk politics.  I need to be around some creative people, and I mean regularly.   Someone I can bounce ideas off, where I can get a creative high. I also need to be paid for it too.   Hey, did you know that you can use a dry erase marker on your computer monitor to take notes?  That just occurred to me to give that a try.  I think I should change my last name to Pendarvis. I like that name, and I don't particularly see why any direct ancestor should have any more claim over my last name than any other. The only reason I am a Zettner rather than a Pendarvis is because we live in a fucking patriarchal society.   And doesn't  "Sheryl Lynn Pendarvis" have an exotic ring to it?  I wonder if it is for certain that I have the Pendarvis blood, or whether that was just speculation.  Probably get better job opportunities if my last name was not at the end of the alphabet. When I applied for a job at the San Francisco Public library, I noticed that after they date stamped my job application, the bureaucrats filed it in alphabetical order.  Considering that they probably receive several hundred applications, that makes it almost ridiculous to even bother applying to such places if your last name ends in a Z.   It almost makes you want to ask in advance if they file job applications in alphabetical order BEFORE filling out 5-6 bloody forms for an application that probably won't even get looked at.  I should go marry Sam. With a last name like Adams, my applications would be looked at FIRST. Hahahahaha. (Wouldn't it be sick to marry someone for their last name?) I shouldn't joke like that though--Sam's a sweetie, even if he is a corporate lawyer!!!   He says he misses the trials though and really wants to be a judge, so maybe the corporate law thing won't last so long.

      Hey, check it out! My  urlLink horoscope  says that an old classmate is now "doable."  X-)  Hahahaha.  The problem with this theory is that there were only ever a few old classmates I ever wanted to do to start with. Oh well. At least one of 'em is happily married now.  These horoscopes are way to vague. If they are gonna make these kinds of insinuations, then they should provide the names and phone numbers as well. Otherwise, how  can you take it seriously? You'd think it was written for all the Toms, Dicks, and Aries of the world!!!

      Well, the parents are back a day early, so that threw me off guard. I think it's going to take a while before I get used to them being here again. I kind of liked living on my own.   Steve says that this is why I need to get a job in Austin and find myself my own apartment, but it's hardly the same. I had a gigantic house to myself. It's on a 2 acre lot\ with two empty lots of each side, so it's very quiet here with lots of space (when you are alone.) I wouldn't have that in a dumpy apartment, where my neighbors would probably play loud music at 2AM.  I wouldn't have most of the things I enjoyed while they were away.    The only difference is that when they were away, I could keep things clean. That's impossible with my dad around. He's a real pig.  If you clean the kitchen, he thinks it's an opportunity to cook some massively messy invention. If he sees an empty space, he likes to fill it with his garbage. I call it marking territory. If he were in the animal kingdom, he'd be pissing on these things. But he's human, so he just puts his rubbish down to Carl-ize things.  But home they are, so I'd better get used to it. They had fun roaming around, digging up genealogical facts.  A while back I was bragging, because Mom had found out that we had an indian slave from South Carolina in our ancestry. (And some of the early indian tribes in South Carolina were cannibals.)  If you were reading my blog at the time, I said that from now on you must refrain from any snyde remarks to me.  Otherwise, I could throw the racism card in your face. (Ok, so she was born in the 1600s, but I'm still a direct decendant of an American indian. Oh, and Mom found direct proof of that on her trip as well, so it's no long speculation.  I have a legitimate ethnic claim to South Carolina!) Being an ethnic minority just has its advantages. :-)  Just don't mess with me, cause your on my continent. My cannibal ancestors were here first, so piss off!!!  Now it's even better, because there is a good chance that we have also found a black slave ancestor from the early 1700s. There's no definite proof, but there are a lot of clues that suggest that Mary Rumpf may well have originally been Mary Pendarvis. Mary's dad was white and owned slaves, and he had all 4 children by one of his slaves. They inherited all his wealth. Mom sort of implied that it was actually easier to intermarry back at that time. She said a lot of the legal things with slaves came after some slave revolt (I can't remember where she said it was, but it wasn't even the US, where some slaves revolted and cut their owners necks.  So that resulted in all sorts of laws making it difficult to free your slaves, etc, etc.)  I think this is the beauty behind genealogy, because it would be almost impossible to not have some minority blood in you, unless you're a first generation American or BOTH your parents came here from another country. People just have way more ancestors than they realize. Everyone should know about their minority roots. Don't ya think?

      They have already done multiple movies and tv shows where the kids and the parents do the switcheroo for a day or two. Has anyone seen any movies where they do a gender switch for a day?  So the chick gets to see the world through the guys eyes and vice versa?  I think that would be a more interesting plot.   Watch the guys go through PMS and try to look composed when they experience menstruation for the first time or try to looked concerned in the workplace while some babbling female goes on about her fake, broken  fingernails or have to suffer through photos of her toddlers.  Or have them get hit on.  At the beginning of the film the guy could get a nice paycheck, and at the end as a woman after a day of false fingernails, he could get a much smaller one as woman.  Surely this has been done before. Why can't I think of it? It couldn't possibly be too perverse for Hollywood, could it? Nah!!!!

      My parents have been away since about June 10th.  I have not kept any food out, have kept the kitchen as tidy as can be, and yet I have been invaded this Summer by cockroaches!!!    I put out bait (maybe they were too old); I've chased them around with brooms. The other evening I was on the phone when one flew at me. You imagine how that must have sounded to person on the other end when I shrieked in horror. "Ahhhhhhh!" .   This evening I was equally disgusted when one sideswiped my ear in upward flight to the sink. They are so gross. I really hate them.  Snakes are fine. Spiders are fine. Lizards are outright cute. Wasps are ok, so long as I get to them before they sting me. With the exception of fire ants, I don't even mind several varieties ants. Like farmer ants are cute. I don't mind bees (they don't sting you, unless they think you are threatening their hive.) But I really hate cockroaches!!!!!!! I'm not real fond of beatle-like creatures in general, except for lightening bugs.  And I don't know what these things are eating, unless they have just learned to survive on the roach bait I set out for them. Some super hybrid that thrives on roach bait, but it's grossing me out!!!!  :(

      I keep finding myself thinking about the big picture and about how weird the human race is.    It's ironic that it's called the human race, because life really is a race. A race against entropy in a quest to fulfill your dreams. But there's also truth in that quote from Shirley Valentine: "Dreams are never in the places we expect them to be."

      Hey, does anyone out there know how to create an icon link from PART of a graphic?  I tried making a link to an image that I reduced and then tried to put some coordinates on it, so that I would only get part of the graphic.  But it's putting the whole graphic.  And when I put the code here to show what I'm trying to do, in hopes that someone can can explain it to me, Blogger thinks I'm trying to insert this link, so it shows the fucking link rather than the code text.   That's the kind of evening I have been having.       Here's how I ended it: width = "339" height = "52" shape="rect" coords="0,0,127,52"  I just want to make a mini icon as a cutesy link to David's site, but I only want up to the end of the Texas flag. Otherwise, it's way too long for a good icon. But that's what he has for a masthead jpg. :(  If you can shrink images with width and height parameters from a link, surely you can use coordinates to zoom in on part of a graphic.

      I told a friend once that I had learned from experience that there are a certain number of men who will try to shock women for the power of it, and that every woman has to be capable of keeping up with such men.  So my friend keeps me in the loop. :-)  Today he sent me a screen cleaner for cleaning your monitor from the inside. You just have to use your cursor:   urlLink http://www13.de/4u/screenclean..swf

      I'm making lists of Bush appointments, so I can make links to articles about how controversial some of these appointments have been. That would be good evidence to show the skeptics in my precinct.  :-)  Here are two links of his 2004 appointments. I had to break it into 2 files, because they were too long:   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/precinct3035/bushnom04A.html    urlLink http://www.geocities.com/precinct3035/bushnom04B.html

      I was talking to Clifton this evening about setting up web pages with real information for our constituents, so that when we go door to door we can hammer Republicans and undecided voters with irrefutable facts about Bush's conduct as President (all government links.)  Anyway, here is the link for Bush's executive orders:   urlLink http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/executive_orders/wbush.html

      David had a political rally this evening. Gave the best speech I've seen him give so far.  They recorded it, so hopefully they will put it on his website. Very strong.  Basically said what I have been thinking--that this election is a decision on whether we want democracy or not.  Clifton was talking about wanting to break down the campaign by precincts. I sent him some info, but I also warned him that David already has a campaign framework in mind. Sounds like Clifton had pretty much the same idea in mind that I was pushing for when I was working on the campaign. To subdivide the campaign by pre-existing political units.  I told him that Ken Bailey at the state headquarters was talking about an electronic voter file for precinct chairs online. Anyway, he can call Mr. Bailey and see what they are doing with that.  But the main thing is that I talked with several people about joining together to take on our respective precincts, because I am living in Republicanville.  I don't have the fortitude to do that alone. But why should we anyway? The democratic party is about cooperative efforts, right?  We aren't macho republicans, who think competition and self sufficiency is what makes the world turn round.  So we'll get this done.  I feel better after talking to some people tonight.

      I like this song. In fact, I like it even more today than yesterday. This song has just got a cynical kick to it that I really enjoy.    urlLink The 70th Love Song   "Some boys necks are made for ties. Some boys necks are made for nooses....." Lalalalala  :-)

      I decided to listen to this Air America this morning--just to see what sort of thing they would be playing at 6AM.   There were two gasbags on just mindlessly blathering: "Morning Sedition."  Oh well, at least I got their station's direct URL, so I don't have to go back to their page to hear their webpage if I ever need to listen again:   urlLink http://play.rbn.com/?url=airam/airam/live/live.rm&proto=rtsp   What happened to the days of Bill Watterson caliber humour?  BTW, they were talking about the Republican Convention. All the speeches from the Dem Convention are online:   urlLink http://www.dems2004.org/site/apps/nl/newsletter3.asp?c=luI2LaPYG&b=125919

      I think I am ready for my mom to come home. I kind of liked having the house to myself and having some privacy, but I think I am starting to go a little wacko by myself.   Butler's been calling me every day (sometimes with unsolicited "wake up calls"), and we haven't really been talking about anything substantive. He keeps mentioning sex, but it's not working.   I should start looking for a local musician to write tunes for my lyrics, so I can feel young and creative and alive and have some fun and sing.    Maybe I  should contact Lloyd Walsh. He used to be in that band, and he's really talented. More to the point, I think I recall them playing in some club where new bands would go and perform. Some were really good and some sucked the wazoozoo, but that was the point. It was a club for people to take the plunge performing--somewhere on St. Mary's strip (if I recall correctly.)  Of course, that was 15 years ago now, I guess. Who knows if it's still in business.  But I need someone to write me decent melodies, or at least to spice mine up and change them enough that if I accidentally ripped anything off, then I don't have to worry about it.  No point in envying Ryan, but not doing anything myself.  I've got a lot of ideas I want n the public psyche, you know?    Mostly they are about why the world sucks, but some are amusing at least.

      Well, listening to KSMG makes me think about some old dance tunes from the 80s. Probably I'd hate some of them if I didn't have good memories about them, but some are definitely cool. Here are some danceable songs I burned to CD a while back, and some I heard on the radio and some that just sprung into my mind:  1) Beds Are Burning-- Midnight Oil 2) We Built This City--Starship 3) The Safety Dance--Men Without Hats 4) I Melt With You--Modern English 5) Enjoy the Silence--Depeche Mode 6) Who Can It Be Now? --Men At Work 7) Pop Goes The World--Men Without Hats 8) Down Under--Men At Work 9) Whip It-- Devo 10) Blister In the Sun--Violent Femmes  11) A World of Lust and Crime--Peter Schilling  12) Shout!--Tears For Fears 13) What's On Your Mind--Information Society 14) Super Freak--Rick James 15) I Ran--A Flock of Seagulls 16) Tubthumping--Chumbawamba  17) Jessie's Girl--Rick Springfield 18) Dancing In the Dark--Rick Springfield 19) Electric Avenue--Eddy Grant 20) YMCA-- Village People   Hey, they just played Break My Stride by Matthew Wilder. That takes me back! I don't think I ever heard it in a dance hall, but I that's one I bought in grade school. They had this music store that sold 45s of songs.   What  sort of shit did I buy in those days? I bought Every Breath You Take, Time After Time, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, Those Were The Days, I Hope That Something Better Comes Along....What else....As you can see, I didn't buy a lot of music in high school.  Mostly I was buying used copies of the Beatles at that time and then I went into a Rush phase.  Always been about 10 years (at least) behind the music), except I liked a lot of the dance music in the 80s when my friends said--hey let's go dancing at the Bonham.  I'd started a list a while back, but I can't find it at the moment.

      I went to bed at something like 3:30AM and woke up at 6:30AM and couldn't get back to sleep. :(  Unfortunately I am still tired though. I've been mopping the dining room.  However, what this means is that I am in one of my fuck everyone I've ever known who doesn't miss me moods.  OK, here is how I want to be seen:  First of all, people are supposed to think I am a creative genius and want to be creative with me. Secondly, they are supposed to think I have a brilliant sense of humor, an amazing intellect, and impeccable taste. And that I am spontaneous and fun. And those things are also supposed to more than make up for any flaws in my personality.  They can also think I am natural, honest, and genuine. I don't mind if they want to think of me as an "Ivory Girl.,"  but not an "Oil of Olay" girl.  You don't need to think I am pretty. Don't need to think I am industrious or practical. But it would help if people thought I was deserving of resources and interesting opportunities.  So now you know world.

      Since my CD player died, I decided to see what sort of shit KSMG is playing these days. It's now playing the "best of the 80s, 90s, and today." Well, they do play some good 80s music occassionally. The rest of what they are playing could best be described as Velveeta Music.  Remember the success of Velveeta? The cheese that no one likes, but no one hates. Maybe this new music is not quite on par with Velveeta. It's so completely tasteless that I do hate it.  I tell you--the mainstream entertainment industry takes no chances with anything remotely interesting anymore. It's gotten so bland.  Kind of like our politics. Keep the masses sedate and you can control them easier. The Beatles wouldn't stand a chance these days.That's have to go indie for sure, and then virtually no one would ever get to hear them.  Oh, the point to this entry is they have a ranking option on their website, so you can rank the song from 1-7 while they play them, so that's a semi-amusing way to waste time.
