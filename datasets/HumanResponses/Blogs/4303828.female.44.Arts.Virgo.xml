						   I hurt my bad leg again today, sooo I didn't do a blasted thing really... I got up and did a few things this morning then it started hurting so I put my leg up, and watched TV for most of the day... And the house shows it too... Rod even went to McDonald and treated us to a big Mac and shake... We haven't had any forbidden food for a LONG time...  Tomorrow I have to go to Vancouver for two doctors appointments. Eyes and skin, and I am hoping to go GOODWILL HUNTING... I love that place. And there are sooo many in Portland... I have found so many treasures there...  Well... See ya tomorrow...

						   Rod is working nights, and when he does that, I keep his schedule, Which means I stay up all night and sleep all day... We didn't get up today till 4:00.  Then at 6:00 when Rod went to work, my friend Jackie came over for glamour Shots... A prayer group she use to belong to several years ago decided to put together a picture album of all the ladies who had at one time attended this group. Another friend of hers had taken some photos of Jackie and she said they made her feel depressed because she didn't like how she looked in the pictures, so she asked me to take some. She just turned 80 years young a few months ago, and the session went well... I got a lot of good pictures of her... She said I restored her self esteem after she saw this one... I am glad she feels better about her self. I really enjoy taking these kind of pictures...  I am going to try to post one of her pictures here... Hope this works...  Well, I've spent 4 hours working on her picture, cropping and fixing them up and putting them on CD, so now I need to get off the computer and STRETCH!!!!!....  See ya tomorrow

						   http://thealamovillage.homestead.com/files/DollHouse.jpg  well, I tried to do some HTML and it didnt work, so just cut and paste the link to your address bar and lets see if that works for now...  This is the doll house, its not a very good picture, I should have taken some good ones before I let her have it... But it give an idea of what it looks like... Thing is, you can't see the details, and there were lots of those... Ohhh well...

						   Yep, well at least I am going to blame her for it... I forgot the passwords to the last place I blogged at, so I just stopped when I couldn't get back in, I was busy too... Then today I looked at my friend Sandra's Blog, (which she rarely writes at any more) and I saw where another friend "Joy" also started a blog today, I read it, and Rod said... "you need to start another blog"... Soooo Between Joy, and Rod, I was inspired to do this blasted thing again...  When I stopped my last blog, I was building a Doll House for our granddaughter Rachael, I finished it, and it turned out sooo good... I wonder if I can post pictures here... Well, I guess I will find out soon enough... We gave the Doll House to Rachael last weekend and SHE LOVED IT!!!... It was so much fun to see her excited over something I had spent so much time making... Made it all worth it...  In a few weeks Rod and I are going to TX to fix up the house for day rental... So I am excited about that... I can't wait to see my little grandson Tyler... Its hard living so far away when you know there is a baby growing up with out being able to SEE it happening... I hope someday I will get to share that experience in person... It will be good for me, but it will also be good for him... Every kid needs a grandma who loves them hanging onto their every word... (smile)...  Well, enough for tonight... I'll get serious with this thing later... Right now I'm in TESTING mode...  See ya later
