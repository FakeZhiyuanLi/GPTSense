      Getting up has never been such a chore.  Even falling off my chair in the general direction of my bed is going to be an accomplishment... i couldn't make it upstairs to use the jacuzzi which really probably would have helped me...  Still, despite all the crap i'm going through, it feels good to be back. I missed football.  Oh well, i should just get to bed, if i sleep now, that'll be nine solid hours...  Tomorrow is gonna be a tad harder then today, since well... i'm gonna wake up and not be able to move.  That should be fun.

      Well I'm still walking...Funny.  The first day was pretty tough, but after so many years of doing this, it hardly seems as bad as it used to.  It seems like its easier every year, but I guess I really have just gotten stronger.  I guess I'll go figure out dinner, cleaning off, and maybe using the jacuzzi.  I'll probably post again before I go to bed.

      Well, tomorrow starts another season... Now that I'm a senior, it means there's no more being lazy when it comes to conditioning.  I gotta stick it out so the little chumps don't lag behind.  I wish I trained harder for this hell week.  It doesn't ever seem to matter what I tell myself, I never really do the pre hell week stuff I always tell myself to.   Of course with all the construction at school, it's been kind of hard to get into the weight room, since it's closed off.  But I'm tired of making excuses for myself, and now I won't have to.  Hell week forces you to do all the crap...  I better get to sleep, gotta be up bright and early, cause I'll be on the field from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM...  ...Shit

      Great, once again I go to this thing and there's no spaces available, I woke up SO EARLY!!!  Bah... Well I -was- kind of late, but that didn't bother them the first time I managed to do it. Well whatever, nothing I can do about that now right?  Guess I'll make the best of being up early.  Going to do some serious training for Hell Week.  Not that doing anything the day before it starts is really going to help me, or a good idea, I just feel I should do it anyways since if I don't do something physical I'll fall back asleep and not be able to wake up early again tomorrow.   At least now I can spend the whole day fearing tomorrow morning, and actually see my brother off to Japan at the airport this afternoon.

      I promised my parents I'd get up nice and early tomorrow (6:30 AM to be exact) and head over to this farmers market, to do community service till 1 o' clock.  I'm never going to fall asleep early enough for that... To make tomorrow even more irritating, my brother is leaving for Japan, and I won't even get to see him off.  It's not -really- that big of a deal, but I won't be seeing him again till Christmas. And on top of all this, Hell Week starts Monday, so half of my last day of sanity and not feeling like a truck hit me, I get to go help old people carry bags of discount vegetables to their cars.   If anyone has any tips on falling asleep, please do share them with me.

      I can't believe how awesome GT3 is... Best racer of all time.  Makes you work for the kickass cars, and when you finally get one, it's driving heaven.  Today after working for about an hour winning championships with my uber pimped out Mustang Cobra, I saved enough (352,000 to be exact) to buy an Italian masterpiece. The Zonda C12S, is ridiculous.  It certainly can't be legal to drive on city streets, because attaching a V2 rocket onto the back of a civic has about the same effect. (Though the Zonda looks much cooler then a civic with a rocket attached to it, yes i mean it.)  I know I must be tired when I'm talking about cars.  It's a good thing no one reads my site...I hope.

      Well I'll be damned... I finally remembered the name of my old site from several years ago.  Fortress of Fatitude. God what was I thinking... Anyways, after typing that into google I got the one and only match to my old page which, to my own surprise, still remains on geocities servers.  Here's the link for anyone in need of a laugh, or just something to make them feel better about themselves.   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/sirmattias52/LordSwanksFortressofFat.html   Enjoy!

      I must have been -really- tired to actually make one of these things... I guess they're not so bad.  I only had my doubts since the last time i made a web page i updated it twice and left it on the web for about 3 years.  Actually it might still be around...   I got so many damn complaints, saying "Hey man, update your page". And i'd just tell them to bugger off, since i'd be busy doing things that didn't suck instead.  Ahhh...i love being bitter.

      I know i'm not alone. At least a third of my friends can still be found awake at this hour. But why is it none of us ever seem to be able to fall asleep? I lay down, and my mind just doesn't shut up. But come morning, waking up is as big a chore as going to sleep was. Ok...so i know it's because i'm thinking too much. What am i thinking about? Everything from how little summer is left, to what i'm going to do with the rest of my life. It all manages to cross my mind this late at night.  I don't know... i guess this is just a teenagers way of making the last few weeks of summer last as long as humanly possible...
