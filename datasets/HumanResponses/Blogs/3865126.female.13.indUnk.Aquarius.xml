      Today I had a lesson @ 11:30 with Rachel. Me n courtney were off to get Reggie from turnout, we were talking about "somebody" and she was like "Whos she going out with now?" Perfect description! O man courtney always knows how to make me laugh. Reggie was sooo lazy again! (eh, yup) but during the jumping he was good, but a lil bit of a brat. Then after I hosed him really well, since he was wet with sweat. LOL THAT RYMES! So then we grazed, and then I brought him in for lunch (o boy!)  -Title- Title is dedicated for our loss of Lear. Ok, ok, not our  loss  but he left cause he was sold so some lead liner kid. Tears. Well, what can I say, I hope he goes to a good home. Poor Huck, he's gonna miss his bes buddy, now I'm really swelling. Ok, you get it, good bye. . .  Ok, then when I came home, I took a nice long shower. Very exciting, right? Of course, shut up! So yeah, then I just walked around the house, called Vic, and she came over while my mum n dad went out to dinner. Haha, Vic is always there for me, shes the best! So we talked to people and crap, then we ordered pizza and  two  sprite remixes. Hmmm, those went to waste, while we concockted them, o well we drank like half. hahaha. Fun times calling people, and making funni voices, poor ppl. haha. Good times good times!  Rachel also tried to teach me html. She did, but it didnt wanna work. Sometimes you just really wish you didnt have a mac, you wish u had a PC, I love my computer, but sometimes it gets me alllll messed up! Well, thankies Rachel!!  Ok, now its venting time. I love how I was there when something funny  happened, and I was standing  right in front of  them, but when it was mentioned, I wasnt mentioned being there. Ok, was I like invisible or something? I was RIGHT there, but nooooo its like I was in the dark, thanks guys, thank you thank you thank you. . .  As you can see, I had a very interesting day, I also found out that Jan has a glass eye. Ok, lata aligata (to my friends I vented too, I still love you, but)   . . .PoP ~ SiX ~ SqUiSh ~ Uh Uh ~ Sicerco ~ Lipschitz. . .

      Today was a nice day, another summer knock off! >:O! I woke up early, since I knew I had to get to the barn early. So I watched some GOOD MORNING AMERICA with my mum. Then I went to the barn. I saw Laura, and was gonna ride with her, then my babes kaitlyn came, and I rode with her! Becuz i love her. So Reggie was good, but lazy! Then we went down, hosed em, grazed em a lil, and cleaned our tack. We watched Doug suffer, while putting stamps on allllll the forms for the horse show (ooo fun) and Ashley laffed at him, since she had to do it last year. Then when Lorna came, Kaitlyn was like "Lorna!!!" Then she turned around, and Kaitlyn went "Hello" It was funni, actually she was just wondering about the Horse trials, if me n her could be 2gether:) Then we all talked a bit, and Kate came back from the tack shop. We have twin spurs hehe. And her stirrups will make noise with the silver foot pads. OOOOOO! haha. My mommy came and picked me up and we checked out the Condo, cuz our tenents moved away. Then we came home, I showered, and I just hung out. Then I decided to take random pics and upload to my comp so I could make them my icon, too bad my dad has the cable for the camera to connect to the comp, boo. And guess what? I found out that my fone has the best textmsging evr! hehe. I ate an ice cream cone, while making cookies. I can multitask! hehe. So then we ate the burnt crispy cookies i made (pleh) and had milk. Finally I watched some TV, and chilled out. I talked to Doug online, funfun! haha. He's burning me a CD for 2moro, thankz Doug! Fun stuff (another boring day) O well, Thursday Brittany comes up and I am so excited that I cant sit still. HEHEHEHEHE! YAYAYAYAYAYAY! And can you tell, Kate taught me a new word! Its "Volumtouse" its actually voluptuous, and it means to be curvy, but under the dictionary on my comp, it had said "a red-hot mama" hehehe. Yep, how cool.  LuV YaZ   . . .always be tolerent, people like that. . .   »**ERICA~WAS~HERE**«

      Ok, so the weather totally sucked! But thats ok, because I guess tomorrow will be nicer!!! So, I took a shower since my back was killing me from tubing with molly yesterday lol. Then I went to the barn, thinking I didn't have a lesson, but because Jess was away at a show tomorrow, and thats the day I have my half hour, I had my half hour today. So I went looking for Reggie in turnout, I found him, in the last paddock, it was raining, and just my luck, he was in the very last paddock! But he was standing right by the gate, waiting for someone to get him out of the muddy paddock. So I did, I saved him from the evil mud monster :D He was good, but lazy (what else is new huh?) We worked on transitions since he's lazy when it comes to those. We'll keep it up! Then (ope hold on, someone just IMed me!)  couple minutes go by  Ok, back. So then me n Reggie went for a walk to the rings, omg! He was walking sooooo slow, hehe. I love being at the barn! Everone there knows how I feel! It's my awaysious! Then I came home, showered  (again)  and then I chilled out, had dinner, ate ice cream, then chilled some more. I decided to buy some music from i-tunes, all from Chicago. My mum thinks I should save my money for when Brittany comes up on Thursday (YAY!!!!!) But I really wanna buy them, only 5$, well w/e. Ok, enuff blabbing for today (but a blog is so I can blab, it just saves you guys from hearing it, you can stop reading this whenever you want, without interupting me!!!)

Then back home, and to vics. Cool beenz! Then I stayed home and talked to people and yada yada yada! So 2moro i'll write bac with way more exciting stuff, k?  «-»Er*ca«-»

      I think today was the most interesting time I've had to think, but I didnt. I spent most my day on the F*ing computer! And I couldve been reading, but I decided to watch TV, I regret this day completely! But some pieces were good. *Smirk, with sideways smile* I woke up with the most painfulness in my mouth from my stupid elastics from my braces. I took an aspirin and took a shower, all day my mouth has felt so much better! So neways tho, the cicaczs called (yep still in lack of spelling that 1) lol, and we got invited to the lake on Sunday, mmm a nice relaxing day with Molly! Yep, thats what I am really looking forward to! But part of my day, my dog had stitches that he licked out of his leg (ew nasty) and had to be driven to the vet for re-stitching. And to keep is nosy mouth out of his leg, they put one of those cones on his head, *sigh* silly dog. So now, we have a groggy dog who has a cone on his head, its cute though hehe. Then me n my mom had to go to the tack shop for spurs. State Line Tack in Salem. It sucks! I couldnt find anything! Sept flyspray and 2 nice shirts but ahem, not what I wasted my afternoon for. So no spurs, no straps, but some shirts and stuff. Then we drove to the barn so I could clean my bridle and kiss my horse and pony goodnight. Got home and became a bump on my chair,  again . I talked to Pickles about  CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT  and we both supported eachother on  CINFIDENTIAL SUBJECT , which was nice, I appreciate it. Then I had yummy mash potatoes for dinner. Yep, another exciting day in the life of a FrEaK.   0xEricax0   . . .cant always be right, but never wanna be wrong. . .

      Today was like a normal day, but really fun. I woke up, and had no time to think b4 my lesson, so basically I was at the barn right away. I rode in spurs agin today, he was good. We rode our flat in the indoor, cuz it was raining, then we rode our jumping part outside in the muddy junk! But still, it didnt faze me or Reggie. We couldn't get one lead change easily in one corner, so it messed up the diagonal line, and he bucked becuz he got mad at the mud. (and the fact that I cannot steer haha) But he was good for the settings. Then I had to rush since I had a dentist appointment, and I didnt get to clean my dirty muddy bridle. So 2moro I will. So then I got to the dentist and the new addition is huge! But it felt comfier, and I got to watch FINDING NEMO, so I couldnt have cared less. I have a power chain on the bottom, and elastics, OW! Then me and my mom went to the drug store, and I got a new mascara and 2 lipglosses. Then we stopped for ice cream. Came home, showered, hung with company, here. Yep, exciting fun day! hehe      •º˙˚Erica˚˙º• :):):)     . . .Look at the glass half full, not half empty. . .

       . . .from now until forever, let us be friends together. . .   Last night me and Becky decided on going to the Mac Apple computer store (yeah, us tech heads) haha. So first, we had yummilicious pizza with her rents, Rachel and Lunny. Cool beeeeenz. The pizza wasnt cool tho, it was  HOT  (no, no see it was good, but hot, and cool is like another word for you know cold). Then, Laura decided that now is a good time to name my computer, it was time. She decided on APPLE PIE, and my fishy is Crusty the angelfish! hehe thank you Lunny Laura! So neways, then me and becky and her rents hopped in the car and were off to the Rockingham mall. We both had our laptops out while on the way there, haha we found out what you can really do with these babies! I was feeling really awful, I was cold and my stomach wanted to PUKE really bad. But I tried not to. After we had been in the MAC store a lil I felt so much better! I was so happy. We looked at everything in awe thinking (yeah if I had the money, I'd scoop it all up right now, put it in 20 bags and be outtie for good) O well. So then after looking around, we left and I was dropped off at home. So I am not telling yaz about my day until tonight, where I can write about my whole day, instead of doing this over and over:: Writing in my next day blog about the last night, no way! hehe 0_o   :!:Squeak like a monkey, croak like a pap, I hope you do not swallow that hunk of burlap:!:  ^w00t! best poem ever! hahaha

      Yesterday I didnt write, correct? Not Correct! I wrote about riding, and going to beckys. So i'll tell ya about the yoga party. We went to the movies and saw Sleepover while Laura and Rachel saw King Arthur, I guess both sucked on the long run. O well, good laugh (haha) Me n Becky's movie got out first so we played games, we tried playing them with our feet, until a fag who worked there decided he'd ruin the fun and tell us not to play the game as we wer (punk). So then me Becky, Rachel and Laura drove to spollets. On the way there i turned on my comp and went to this thing where u can type something and it will say it. So we were typing stuff and laughing our hearts out! haha, and then we all made up the best poem::   . . .squeak like a monkey, croak like a pap, i hope you do not swallow that hunk of burlap. . .   Then we got stuff at spollets and went home. Me and Becky sat on our laptops for most the night (and it was satisfying) and listened to music from CHICAGO!!!!!!!!!!! hey, just like we r now! haha. Anwyay, then we went to ebaumsworld and watched a guy sing about his job at burger king. haha! So i sent the link to Rachels sn as "I wish I could sing like this man". So then we  decided to go find Laura and Rachel and make s'mores with em. It was dark and late. We kept bringing up the song haha we all wish we could sing like him!!!! We tried making a fire, then we got it going real well a couple times. We made yummy s'mores and laughed so hard! Me and Becky brought out some sparklers and we lit a bunch. Laura lit 2 and had 1 in each hand and danced her "sexy dance" GO LAURA! Then Rachel did her sexy dance with the sparklers (it was also brilliant) Shake ya booties! haha. Then after we had to go to the acorn (a little house in the woods of their backyard) so we slipped on some boots, linked arms, and we wer off. It was pitch black, and we wer in the woods. It was a great time to laugh ur ass of, so we did. Cuz becky thot that a coyote was guna come up to us and eat us. Then we got to the acorn and we grabbed Rachel's pillows and walked back. Even scarier, but still funni. Then we decided to continue watching THE CAT FROM OUTTER SPACE haha funni movie! Then me n becky decided we should go to bed since we had to wake up somewhat early for my lesson. So, about today, and my lesson, Reggie was really good, but really lazy, so Jess lemme wear spurs which I need to wear most of the time now, and she says I need bigger ones, so yeah. Then me and Becky went in the field and trotted up the field a cupple times, they wer SO good! After that we took care of our tack and horses. Me, Becky and Courtney then walked to Spollets for lunch, which was good. We sat on the statue and laughed about anything random. Then my mom called. . .and asked what i was up to. I asked if I could be with becky for the day and go to the mall with her n her mom. My mom said yes :D Thanks mum! So then Rachel picked me n Becky up, brought us home, (here) and we went to say hi to Laura, who was just finishing her yoga session, SUPERLATIVE! Then we came bac to the comps. Right now Becky is attempting to play this game Bugdom, and it kept making funny noises and then it swatted her. Yep, the game is officialy retarted. (cuz it was being funky, it really is a fun game) So I may blog in the mac store with becky! owow!!! We miss u kaitlyn! Mwaz......  -:|:-Erica dn kinda Becky, and Laura and Rachel are here in spirit (they are out for lunch or something) thank you-:|:-

      I didnt blog yesterday cuz it was just flights and airport.  Today I woke up, went to the barn and rode with Becky. Reggie was good, but I felt so out of sync. It ended up fine, no injuries (well yea, cuz my leg hit Daphnes bum when Reggie took off) but anyways. I saw Kaitlyn, (yay) and I cant wait to go to her Maine house in 2 weeks hehe. Kate was learning german from kim (about the comment, I had it mixed up hehehe), and it was funni, Kate you are from Deutschland! And then I went up to the car window of Laura, and I freaked her out, tehe, woah baby was it funni! So again, Me, Becky, Rachel and Laura are going to the movies, then going to hav a Pre-yoga party dedicated to Kaitlyn for her sake of not being able to b there. Well, it should be fun. Write back probably 2moro, unless I have time to blog (most likely i will).  .::.Erica.::.
