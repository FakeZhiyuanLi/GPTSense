      Well today is fourth of July and my family is doing nothing but sitting st home and watching movies and eating a huge meal that my mom cooks like every weekend (its the Italian in her). But I'm hoping that we get this block party going thats going to happend in a few weeks, well actually next month probably, but i really want this party to happend b/c I'm gonna be turning 16 soon and want to have a tight party lol!! Well my mom called radio stations to help us with the party and everything and hoping that goes well too. It would have been a lot cooler if i got my licenses on my b-day too, if only i had a car though, hehe. I would go on a small road trip with my friends and not come back untill 2 weeks later (yea right my parents would kill me). Anyway, hope that everyone has a tight Fourth Of July, peace out!

      well well well, i starting a new blog b/c im bored and my friend thought that this would be a good idea. But today was not a good day for me though. I was going to go watch a movie, Spiderman 2 today with friends, so got up around 8:30am today and started my cleaing early so i wouldn't have to worry about it later in the day and can get ready for the movies too. So i walked toward my room and this dumb crate was in my way and i stubbed my baby toe on the crate and part of my toe nail came off and i broke it, eerrr! It seems as though bad things only happen to me, oh well. But all day i was in freak'n pain and didn't think much about it untill the sharp pain started getting worse and worse through out the day. So now im on pain killers that are making me feel so weird and in a twilight zone it seems like, that i've been trying to sleep through out the whole day to get my mind off the pain. I even tried to watch BarberShop 2 which didn't work b/c my mind was defiantly on my pain. I thought that i can really take pain but i thought wrong lol. But i guess i'll get my booty to bed and sleep!!
