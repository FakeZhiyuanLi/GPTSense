        我難過的是 放棄你 放棄愛 放棄的夢被打碎 忍住悲哀  I am going to give up Jiemin, concentrate on studies. She had caused me to lose concentration and shattered my heart into million pieces, such disappointment... She hasn't been nice to me after my confession, now it's hard to become good friends again.. i won't believe that she will trust me in anything.. Never mind, who cares? i don't think i will be nice to her either.. for now, a new 'me' will reappear in people's eyes, no more sorrow, bitter-gourd face or whatsoever. i am going to make a great success in my studies.. i will!!!

        I have just watch  "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"  to day, it is a nice show, funny and it's popular! A lot of people are watching there, number of fans of Harry Potter is still increasing.. The graphics are better than the first movie but darn! I missed the second one.. maybe I should get the DVD and watch it someday.. Harry's wizardry had improved a lot, i can say. Daniel Radcliffe and gang are much older now, can see that they are much more matured.. So what can i say? Must watch!!!

        I wake up this morning, found out what had happened isn't true.. It's only a dream.. I almost cried, tears nearly fell.. Cause everything is just dream, not real..   This is what happened in my dream.. it's a pretty nice one, i have never get a better one than this, and may be a dream that may always leave a mark in my heart. It's about 'her', someone i like in the past, now and will like in maybe, future... well.. nobody will be sure about that. She started to talk to me again, she's accepted me.. woohoo.. that will be really great.. but.. it's just a dream. She treats me so different.   Ever since i confess to her, her attitude towards me had changed: rejected at all times I ask her out; talks to me only when I talk to her.. I feel really bad, wonder if anyone will be able to help me..
