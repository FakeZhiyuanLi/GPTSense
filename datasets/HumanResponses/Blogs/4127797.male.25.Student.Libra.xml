      I won't mention Iraq and Afghanistan (nor any other foriegn policy) because we all know how Bush screwed that up.  OK, you all know about Bush's economic policy failing to create jobs( urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/business/06CND-ECON.html?ex=1092888000&amp;en=5336cf8a4f6027a7&ei=5070&amp;hp ).  We all know that Bush's tax policy is shifting the tax burden on themiddle class ( urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5689001/ ) and that the gapbetween the haves and have nots has increased more under Bush( urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5726153/ ).  Oh yeah, Bush has been rolling back consumer, worker, environmental, andsafety regulations (say good by to all you worked for Mr. Nader):  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/politics/14bush.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=   What else can Bush do wrong?  Oh yeah, education.  NCLB encourages charterschools.  But surprise, surprise, charter schools are performing at lowerlevels than traditional public schools: urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/17/education/17charter.html?hp

      Funny how the GOP spinsters were eager to say that Kerry would receive a "bounce" of up to 12 points in the poll.  This despite the fact that most polls indicate that far fewer than 12% were "persuadable".  True to form, the Republican crew was quick to point out that Kerry did not receive the large bounce that they predicted.  And, of course, the pundits were quick to echo this sentiment throughout the media.  The "Echo Chamber" at it's best.  However, the point of the convention was not necessarily to deliver a knock-out blow as did Clinton in '92 and '96, but to give the country their first taste of John Kerry the man.  Going into the convention, Kerry was badly losing the "nice guy" contest as well as several other key indicators, including who would best handle Iraq and the war on terror.   OK, OK.  Rather than go through my analysis, I'll point you all to two other sources that are quite detailed:   urlLink http://www.democracycorps.com/reports/index.html   urlLink http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;b=134332   So, despite the negative comments by all the pundits, it appears as though the convention was much more positive than it is given credit for.  Kerry has made up some ground in several key areas.  ---  Analysis aside, there were several moments during the convention that stood out the most.  Yes, being in the Fleet Center during John Kerry's acceptance speech was a definite highlight.  But Johnk Kerry's leadership was most highlighted by speeches by Gen. Wesley Clark and former Senator Max Cleland as well as his swift boat crewmates.  Despite the constant claims to the contrary, Kerry described his main objectives and pointed everyone to his website for the more detailed descriptions.  All in all, I'd say Thursday culminated a week that demonstrated Johnk Kerry's commitment to his country.  I with the paid pundits paid a little more attention to the actual content of the convention instead of editorializing throughout every speech.  Other moments of note include watching John Edwards speech at a bar with a bunch of strangers and having a good time.  Barack Obama's speech definitely lived up to the hype I had given it.  He spoke with such eloquence and passion about the Democrats' desire for unity and moving forward.  His comments reiterated the positive message of opportunity and unity by Bill Clinton on the conventions opening night.   What wasn't on TV or anywhere else was a speech by Senator Joe Biden to the college Democrats, perhaps the best I've ever heard.  He called for mutual sacrifice and mutual benefits in a time of increased security risks.  His message of unity included the fact that "rich people are patriotic too" -- something that too many people on the left fail to recognize and appreciate.  There are plenty of wealthy liberals out there, reason to take a second look at the traditional class warfare that so many on the left try to fight.  Progress, in my opinion, will be more quickly realized when we work together instead of dividing ourselves on class lines.  The conservatives try to divide the country by race, religion, etc.  Progressives should not try to resort to similar strategies.  For me, the choice in November is now clear: unity, hope and opportunity or division, fear, and the status quo.  My vote is for the former.

      Surprise, surprise.  Job growth is stagnating:   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/business/06CND-ECON.html?hp   Two months in a row with less job creation than expected.  Only yesterday, the media and economists were predicting over 220,000 new jobs:   urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5612752/   I'm no economist, but that's not good.  OK, no more 'pessimism'.  On the plus side, the Bush Administration is trying to establish new "Flex time" legislation:    urlLink http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-flextime6aug06,1,3141357.story?coll=la-home-headlines   For those not familiar with the latest  urlLink Newspeak , "flex time" is a euphemism for removing overtime benefits.  The Economic Policy Institute has a few publications:   urlLink http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/briefingpapers_comp   urlLink http://www.epinet.org/briefingpapers/familyf_bp_1997.pdf   I do applaud the Bush Administration working on legislation other than faith-based constitutional amendments, but I still disagree with his economic policies.   By the way, I just finished reading Robert Rubin's (Treasury Secretary during the Clinton Presidency) new book,   urlLink In An Uncertain World  , and would recommend it.

      While setting up a blog for the  urlLink Stanford Democrats , I set up my own personal blog as well.  You can visit my website,  urlLink Gilbert Martinez  (threw that in to bump me up on Google), for more personal info and to get an idea what I'll most likely be posting about.  If you're too lazy to go to my  urlLink website , you can expect posts on my science interests, political interests, and general philosophical rantings.  I'll post sometime soon on my impressions from the recent Democratic National Convention.
