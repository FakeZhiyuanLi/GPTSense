       5 things i do when I'm bored: eat, clean house, nap, shop online, and swim.   5 things i dream about: people, monsters, giant animals taking over, traveling, and things not important enough to remember.   5 things i really dislike: spiders, bugs, stupid people, 2% milk, and when the answering machine records hangups.   5 things i really like: Taco Bell cheese casadilla with beans added, colors, orange sorbet, art museums, and bowling (i really suck).   5 things i love: hugs, throwing pots (on the pottery wheel), laughing so hard you can't stop, my cats, and making people smile.   5 things i need every day: my water bottle, sleep, flip flops, Daniel (to make me smile), and tons of food.

      Yup. Made my money mark. I just finished another project, and there are tons of people at my house. I have no idea where they all came from. Most of them are islanders who I know but there are a few people who look like their 25 or so and I have never seen them before. Not that it really matters, because they are all down having a bonfire in our pit. I haven't been tubing in such a long time I just got this huge craving for it. I would go right now in the dark if I could. ... The wierdest thing just happened to me. I think those people who I don't know were drunk because they were leaving and one of the guys asked about my wiring harness project. Then as he was leaving with a beer in his hand he said "See ya round Baby." What the hell? I hate horny drunk people. Not a great mixture.

      Yesterday dad brought home a WRX, he works on cars and lately he has started going to auctions. He gets really good deals on cars that barely have anything wrong with them, he fixes them, and then he sells them. He bought the WRX for something like 10,000 dollars. It needed a little body work so he got it done and now the thing looks perfect. Dad offered me 50 bucks to detail the car, of course I said yes! Then he went and asked Daniel to do it instead and he is giving him 100 bucks! Plus he gets to drive it. Sometimes I just don't get dad. Daniel would have done it for free because he would just want to drive it, but now he's getting paid. Oh well. It is so hot outside I just want to swim all day long. But I need to work. Writing right now is just an excuse for me to break. Maybe I'll go jump in the lake too. Dad's shop owes me 250 dollars. By the end of the day, that'll be 375 dollars. And dad himself owes me 30 dollars. Money money money.

      How could I forget. I went up to play baseball with a bunch of island people tonight at about 7:30. I'm really not to great at sports, especially the ones where you have to handle&nbsp;a ball. I think I am worst at baseball. So when I say that I went to play baseball, what I really mean is that I went to watch. The idiot who is ubsessed with my sister was there, his names Nate. I was going to say something to him about it but I think I am really too nice. And also, I don't think he really meant to be rude to me. Most of the time he is a really nice guy, I don't think I have every seen him actually try to be rude or anything. Anyway, he's not really a baseball guy either, so he went on the swings with me and we just talked. Another guy, Ben hung out with us too. We talked about what guys liked which girls, and who is dating, and how certain people act around other certain people. It was pretty boring so we decided to go sit right next to the field. Smart. Soon after, the ball came flying at me. I'm not the brightest person in the world, so I didn't move, I just ducked and curled up my legs. Amazingly enough, I caught the ball in my leg. Behind my knee. I was facing towards the feild so I really have no idea how it happened but it did. And that wasn't the only time the ball cam flying at me, I also got hit in the knee. Great fun. Oh yeah and I was wearing a skirt sitting in the grass when a red-headed ant crawled under my leg and bit me on the butt. I had no idea it was an ant, I actually thought it was one of those prickle bush things. So I pulled it off, and the ant was really holding on because I actually had to pull it hard. At this time I still had no idea it was an ant, and actually I didn't find out until five minutes later when the stupid thing bit me again. This time I actually saw it and I smached the little thing the smitherines. Oops. Then Nate and I started talking about a guy that my sister dated, that got us talking about my sister and how Nate really likes her. Then he said something about his girlfriend. I had no idea that he had a girlfriend! So I told him that he should tell her how he feels about Amanda and stop leading her on because he doesn't like the girl. To tell you the truth, I don't think he even thought about the fact that he didn't like his girlfriend. He got quiet for a long time and then he told me that I should be a counselor. Because I make him feel like he can talk to me about stuff and that he isn't afraid to admit it to me. Also, he said that me talking badly about drugs and stuff all the time made him want to stop. I think that he is depressed because he doesn't do anything other than go to work. Sometimes he hangs out with freinds, but the people that he considers friends, really would ditch him in a second. They all smoke, and they all do drugs. Nate hangs out with them and he can't help but do it too. To the point, Nate thinks I should be a counselor. Wierd. Oh my gosh. I almost forgot. Daniel hit a grand slam ball! (I didn't even see him hit it. All I saw was the ball go out of sight and him running home. He forgave me.)

      Today I finished one harness (my 125 dollar projects) and started a new one. It didn't take very long but I have a serious problem with taking seriously long breaks. I get very distracted very easily. Daniel helped me all day and he was basically my motivation. He was like a slave driver, making me work! I'm kinda glad though because I never would have finished and started a new one. So these projects are basically under-the-table work for my dad who owns a car shop. He is making conversions from subarus into volkswagen vanagons. A lot of people like them and their really fast. Hopefully I'll get two done tomarrow. Mom is on the island tomarrow and the next day to help one of dad's friends clean his house. He married a Russian woman and she is coming to live with him sometime this month so he is doing major cleaning. Saturday I'm going to a car wash to raise money for swim team which I am joining this school year. A few friends have already been doing it and I love to swim so why not right?

      Today Daniel is coming to dad's house. He is going to help me work on wiring harnesses (what I do for work) so I can earn a whole bunch of money by the end of the summer. My goal is somewhere near 2000 dollars. I know I could do it. The only question is if my dad has enough work for me to do. Mom figured out that working for my dad I make almost like 20 dollars an hour. That is very very good money for someone my age. But seeing that I don't get paid by the hour, I get paid by completion of projects, I can only make a limited amount of money due to lack of projects. Other than that, Daniel and I will probably jsut go swimming. Great fun.

      I hate being a negative person but sometimes you just can't help it. I was waiting in the ferry line with my sister Amanda&nbsp;and a friend in my black jetta. A guy we all know (who is in love with my sister but definately not her type) walked up to the car and started talking to Amanda. He looks up at me and says hi and then its back to her. Then he decides to compliment her. This is what he says... "You look so much like your sister." awww cute. If he would only leave it at that... "But much better." He says. Loud and clear for Megan to hear, Doesn't that make you feel lovely? Yes my sister is beautiful and you can compliment her all you want. But we are two separate people, both of which have feelings. I believe that I am not the best looking person in the world, and that I have a little extra weight that I could lose. But I am individual. You do not compare two people like that especially me to my younger and hotter sister.

      Where to start... When I was in sixth grade, a new boy moved to the island where I live about a block away from my house. He was in the eighth grade and a lot of the girls thought he was pretty cute, including my friend Kyla. I wasn't very interested because I only liked boys if they said they liked me and even still I was a shy girl and boys were just not for me. Soon enough word was around that the boy, also known as Sam, liked Kyla. Kyla is a really tiny, cute girl who is very outgoing. She is popular and a lot of guys like her. By the beginning of summer Sam and Kyla were dating. Of course Kyla and I were good friends (since 1st grade) but Sam lived a block from my house. She practically lived at my house over the summer (this usually happened because my dad owns a nice big house on a lake). Every night we would go over to Sam's house to either watch a movie or have a bon-fire. Even the nights when we weren't allowed to go out, or the nights when we had a curfew, we would be out with Sam. The two of them would make-out in the bushes.&nbsp;One time Sam brought a friend to his house and I ended up liking him a little. Me and him made out in some grass and he was the first boy I ever kissed. (I was embarrassed to tell him though so&nbsp;I told him I made out&nbsp;with some other bad boy in the fifth grade. I was COOL!)&nbsp;Everyone thought&nbsp;Sam and Kyla&nbsp;were perfect for each other. They dated for about a year until Kyla decided that she wanted to date someone in her grade who was popular like her. My brother is the same age as Sam so of course they were friends and even after Kyla and Sam broke up Sam continued to come over to my house. I have no idea how it happened but somehow Sam and I became very close. I was in seventh grade and Sam was a freshman in high school. He got a car and so he would drive around the island every night. Sometimes with his guy friends and sometimes with just me. When it was just us, we would go park somewhere and make out in his car listening to music like Lenny Kravitz. Kyla didn't care at all. Now she was just learning to drive so Sam would let her drive his car around all night and we would get in the backseat and make out. I never did anything more then that until July after seventh grade. We had been "together" for something like six months, i dont really know for sure.&nbsp;We didn't call each other boyfriend and girlfriend, but I had feelings for him and I thought he had feelings for me. On the&nbsp;fifth of July, I snuck out of me and my friends tent and went to Sams house. We made out for like&nbsp;four hours and... I touched his weewee. We didn't do anything more but that was the worst thing I had done with a guy and my other friends hadn't done that yet so I was very ecstatic. Things continued like this for another year or so. We would drive around and make out and things. It got to the point where I would let him feel me up. It was a big deal to me. I really liked him and he was my first boyfriend. But we still weren't officially going out. So I told him that I wanted to sometime around July after eighth grade. We started "going out" and a week later (the fourth of July to be exact), Sam got mad at me for not saying hi to him at the beach. We still disagree to this day on whether or not I said hi to him or not. I did say hi to him but I wasn't all over him like normal because his cousin had a friend over who was his age and I didn't like her. I could tell she liked Sam so I wasn't in a very good mood.&nbsp;I found out later that week after he broke up with me that he had made out with that other girl. That was the first time that I got my heard broken. He acted like he did nothing wrong and talked to everyone like nothing had ever happened between me and him. I was furious. And by the end of that summer I had made out with tons of other guys. The school year started and I was in high school. I flirted a lot. I guess you could call it my expirimental stage because within a few months, I had made out with most of the guys I knew, let them touch me all over, drank, and even smoked. I wasn't hanging out with very good people. I had a drinking problem (enough to drink alone. but not too many people knew about it). In November I met a guy (who was actually dating one of my old friends). His name was Daniel, he liked to be called Dan but I dare to be different. He ended up coming over to my house and not a week later we were dating. I didn't like him as much as I wish I had (I still had feelings for Sam)&nbsp;but he said he was totally in love with me, and I figured "Why not? You can always dump him" We started going out on November 27th of 2002. It has been 19 months so far and we are doing pretty good. He's grown on me and I love him! I quit doing all those bad things because of him. I lost my virginity to him. Meanwhile Kyla started dating Sam again. Me and her hadn't talked in a while when I found out because of my whole self discovery/experimental stage. So when I found out, I made fun of her. I think, deep down I was jelous. I don't know why, maybe because I couldn't see Sam with any other girl. But there they were again. Anyway, they dated for&nbsp;something close to a year i think and then Kyla met another guy. She broke up with Sam and he was heart broken. I think he was really in love with her because she is all he ever talked about. Anyway, Daniel and I have only gone&nbsp;through one major problem... and it was my fault. About five weeks ago we started getting in a whole bunch of fights. I was convinced that we couldn't be happy together and that we weren't meant to be together. This was after Sam and Kyla broke up, I thought I had feelings for Sam again. I had a few classes with him and I guess you could say he flirted with me once and a while. He told me that I was a great person. I told Daniel that I thought I liked Sam and he didn't believe me. I was very confused and depressed. The night after Sam, my brother and some freinds graduated they decided to go down to this beach. I was invited and so I went, without Daniel. Sam's cousin, she's about my age, was there too and so me and her were like buddy buddy while the guys built a fire and whatnot. Sam sat next to me and we could both just feel that the other one of us had some kind of feelings. Nothing happened until we all went back to Sam's for some movies. I layed on one of his smaller couches and he ended up laying next to me. He held my hands, and kissed them. I really thought there was something there. (Oh yeah I forgot to mention that Daniel and Sam were and still are pretty good friends) Sam knew we weren't doing very well and he told me that I didn't have to do anything that I didn't want to do. But for some reason I did it anyway. I kissed him and soon enough we were making out. I was really tired so I don't really remember all the details exactly, but I do remember Sam kept saying that I was a really great person and that I am so nice and happy and cheerful. Mostly that I am really great. The more he said it the more I thought... "you really don't like me. if you did you would say it. not that i am a great person. and if i was a great person, i never would have done this to daniel." i fucked up. I told Daniel the next day. He was angry for a while but I guess I am worth forgiving. I hate myself more than anything for doing it. And I know for a fact that I will never do it again. A lot of people would think that I was a slut if they knew, but I am not that kind of person. Truthfully, I cry every time I think about it. Writing this I cry and reading it I’ll cry. Daniel has forgiven me and right now we are really happy. People make mistakes. Mine was just a little bit bigger than everyone elses. Lately, I guess Sam has been after a lot of girls. BJ here, makeout there. It seems like he likes a new girl every week. It just pisses me off that I had to be one of them. I know he still has feelings for Kyla, he just can't get over her.&nbsp;As for me, I think she still has feelings for him too.&nbsp;Daniel, I really don’t know how to describe him. He makes me happy. I'm in love wth him and&nbsp;I really wouldn’t be surprised if we ended up getting married. Not that I wanna make the promise or anything.

      Today I came back to dad's&nbsp;house after being at mom's for the weekend. Dad and my brother Alex got in a fight. I don't think that Alex is very happy. At dad's, we have a points based chore system. We have to earn 1000 points a day and each job that we do to help around the house is a certain amount of points. For example, doing the dishes and cleaning the whole kitchen is worth 350 points. Alex doesn't really like this system because if he doesn't earn his points for the day, then he doesn't get to go anywhere to hang out with friends or he can't have people over. He is 18 years old but this is dad's way of making us help out if we want to live with him. I think it's a great way of getting people to do chores because then each of us kids earns our&nbsp;equal amount of points and no one can fight over who did more work. Alex hates doing chores, but then he expects to have friends over to watch movies without helping around the house at all. Dad is just trying to get his life going. He is trying to get him to take responsibility for things.

      As a little help to get to know the people I talk about and myself. My dad grew up as a really nerdy kid, he had a family of&nbsp;five kids so&nbsp;science projects and books kept him busy. He never really dated until he met my mom when he was 18. I guess he was in love, although, he probably had no idea what other kinds of people were out there because she was his first girlfriend. My mom grew up with two sisters. She was the youngest, and she was a very chubby redhead. The next oldest sister was a model and very pretty. She looked up to her and loved her and even tried to borrow her clothes. But she didn't get too omuch attention from anyone, except her dad, who eventually got divorced and he died. My mom was into drugs by the time she was 12. She smoked, did marijuana, and tried many other things, one time she took acid and ended up walking 5 miles to a park to go on the swings. She continued these habits and somehow met my dad, I guess things changed with her because they were really happy, had kidsand lived happily for a while. We&nbsp;moved to an island and&nbsp;that is where I grew up. We built a house&nbsp;and eventually they began to fight.&nbsp;Now they are divorced. I guess mom was with other men and she even got back to marijauna. It's probably been about a year. Dad is happy, his buisness is going pretty good and he is engaged to a great woman. She's really nice, she has two kids and is a retired doctor. She is full of energy which is great for my dad, he'll live longer because of her. My mom on the other hand, she has a stalker, two boyfriends and no permanent job. She wants to own a painting buisness, doing faux murals and things, and I think eventually she will. But she is ging through a hard spot, I think she wishes bad things didn't happen. But they do. My sister is 13 years old and she is all grown up. Physically. She has the body of Giselle Bundchen (a little less boobs and not as tall yet but she's 13!) My mom spoils her in every way possible. I still love her. My brother is 18 and not doing much&nbsp;with his life. He wants to be a graphic designer. When he was 16 my dad bought him a volkswagen gti, and when he was 17 he bought him a porshe. It needed a little work on the inside and a little tlc, but it was a nice car. When he got it my brother said "Dad, that's my dream car." Sure enough, he doesn't care about his dreams too much because he still has the car in the garage. He doesn't drive it and he rarely works on it/takes care of it. Dad is paying for everything to fix it up and when he's finished, my brother is going to sell it to pay for school tuition. A few days ago, my dad bought him another car. It is a Subaru Impreza (my brothers latest dream car) and he told my brother that he will sell it to him for cheap. My brother has been the most excited I think I have ever seen him. Amazingly anough I am proud to say that yesterday my brother told me that he was applying at a local restaurant (his first job) and he also signed up to go to school at the local technical college. I think and hope that he is starting to live his life.

      I was born in Washington and I have lived here all my life. I have traveled to a few places including Canada, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, California, and Nevada. I really enjoy going to new places and I dream of traveling to Europe. I take French class in school, I have already taken two years and I plan to take two more. I have a really great teacher and I think I am a pretty great student, because I enjoy it. I have a freind who is a year older who was planning to go to Europe&nbsp; next summer. Her name's Kyla and she made plans to go and then her travel buddy ditched her and she has nobody to go with. I want to go so bad and I really am going to try to be able to. My mom would love to see me go except she doesn't do very well when it comes to extra money. My dad's fiance thinks it is an awesome opportunity. She went to Europe when she was about 18 and she loved it. She told me some stories, mostly about men flashing her on the subway. My dad on the other hand, would probably rather I didn't travel that far until I was 18. I would be 17 if I went with Kyla. But he wouldn't stop me especially if I paid for all of it. Anyway, I think the trip would be great. We would stay in hostels and meet tons of new people from country to country. This is definately something I would want to do, be out there all on our own.

      Just got back from a BBQ with Daniel and a bunch of people from his family. I didn't think it would be but it was actually kinda fun. We went to Machester State Park, which is a campground by a beach and stuff. I met a bunch of Daniel's cousins and ate a burger and stuff. It was a pretty cool park, and the Seattle ferry drove by probably 6 times while we were there. Anyway, I'm back at mom's now and the house is kind of a mess so Daniel and I are going to clean it up for her. Then we are going over to his sister's house to babysit the kids (Ryan and Toni). They both had a lot of sugar today so I might be up really late. Better get to cleaning.

      Okay so I'm at mom's house. There is absolutely nothing to do. Daniel is over and I am still bored. I invited Sarah and Kayla over so hopefully they will entertain me. Oh yeah and our friend Zack is coming too, maybe I'll get to play matchmaker! Yay! So we were coming in the door when Daniel noticed some money on the porch. It ended up being $75 dollars! I called my mom to see if she might have dropped it or if she was expecting it or something but I couldn't get ahold of her. Daniel said "finders keepers" but I don't think that will go over with my mom. He's funny.

      It was supposed to be moms weekend with us kids, but she got the chance to go on a sailing trip the last couple of days. When she asked dad if they could switch, dad said he already had plans too to go up to Anns beach place. Us kids were invited to go with him but every one of us already had plans, so we get the house to ourselves. Dad made clear rules that we weren't allowed to have anyone in the house but I know Alex is definatley going to have a party. At least, he said he was going to. I have plans to go to a BBQ with some of Daniel's family so today I am going in to my mom's house to stay overnight. Then tomarrow we are going to the BBQ and we will probably end up staying overnight at Daniel's house. So basically, I wont get to take part in any of the weekend long party because I will be leaving today and coming home sometime on Sunday. Which also means I wont have much time to work this weekend.

      So Daniel and I never ended up going hiking down to that beach lastnight. Being me (the stupid one) I assumed that the only reason Daniel wanted to go down there was because I went down there with Sam and other people before. He has never been down there and it didn't really seem like he wanted to. So I told him that and he got really mad at me and then we kinda got in a fight and we ended up coming back. It wasn't too bad, though I did realize that I am very blunt and kinda retarded. It happens to the best of us. Anyway I went to bed early and Daniel stayed up chatting with people online. Woohoo.

      Alex turned up. They were out trying out the reefer for the first time. Haha just kidding. My brother would never do that. He got the D.A.R.E. award in fifth grade and has been good ever since. Except he has been drinking at parties lately. What are you gonna do? Daniel wants to hike down to Andy's Marine Park. But he has no idea that it is a really really long walk. Oh well. I guess I'm up for it.

      Ended up not going tubing lastnight. Those losers. But we did convince them this morning. It was awesome. Though Amanda's tube started going flat so me being the better tuber, I had to switch her tubes. Ruined all my fun. The thing made me fall off it was not my fault! Alex went with a friend (Nick) to drive around in his car. They've been gone for a few hours, nobody knows where they are and Nick isn't answering his cell phone. On a happy note, Amanda is making taco's for dinner! Yumm. Although I do have to go and grate the cheese. Great fun.

      Wow. Daniel is working with Alex on his car. Amanda and I really want to go tubing but nobody other than them can take us. Dad said that we aren't allowed to bother him because he rarely works on anything and he wants him to get as much done as possible. I wanted to put some pictures of random things on my blog page, but I'm not computer saavy so I couldn't really figure it out. Most things I do pretty well with and I think I am better with computers than most people but everything was screwing up with that Hello program and I just wasn't happy with it. I tried looking around for even a new site to put my blogs on but none of them were any good. Stuck here with no pictures. Oh well it's not so bad. Amanda and I are ready to go tubing now all we need to do is find someone to take us! It's not looking to good on our part but I think by 9, we should have a volunteer if we keep begging. They're a bunch of suckers for beggers.

      I just got finished watching Mystic River. It was a really wierd movie, alright until the end. Anyway, my brother is in a really pissy mood, and I think my dad is also. They must be on the same mentrual cycle or something. Daniel doesn't like that I write things down, at least I'm pretty sure he doesn't. He wants to read it but feels like he shouldn't. He told me not to write anything about mean about him, but why would I do that? I love you sweetie! Oh yeah, when we got here tonight, we found out that my brother crashed his newly acquired car. Ok, he didn't really crash the car, it's still a little alright. I guess he was showing off to some people who were in the car with him and he wanted to do some fishtails in a dirt area, he over corrected his turns a lot and ended up sliding sideways into a ditch. He blew one of his tires, stuffed another with straw, and now one more has gone flat as of a day later. The body of the car is scratched up with a few small dents, also I guess the frame of the car got a little messed up. I couldn't believe my brother. This isn't the same brother who used to be afraid of driving. He has been acting wierd lately. My brother used to be the nicest guy in the world, and because of it, his "friends" made fun of him all the time. I think that caught up to him and now he isn't taking it anymore. I think he is in a really angry stage, where he says fuck everyone.

      I get paid $250 from dad today. I think I might need to go open a bank account sometime soon so that I don't waste money. I owe my change jar $10 in quarters so there goes that. I owe Daniel $3 for who knows what, and the rest I really need to save. I am going to have to pay for all of my school clothes this year because my mom doesn't have much money. Although dad's girlfriend said he would double what I earn, and what she says goes. So we'll see. Everything extra that I earn this summer needs to go towards college. No offense to him but I really don't want to be like my brother. I want to go to a really nice school like the Seattle Art Institute, or the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. Hopefully I will get some scholarships so I wont have to pay for all of it because those schools are really expensive. I don't even know what I want to do for a living, I just know I want to do something in design. I really like fashion design, interior design, and even architechture, how an I supposed to decide? One thing that sounds really interesting to me would be becoming a buyer. I would really like to be an intern for some clothing company and become an assisstant buyer to see what it's like. But ya never know. I'm going back to dad's tonight to work some more. Maybe we will work on my loft (an ongoing project that was promised to be finished by the end of the summer but probably never will). Oh yeah. Almost forgot (how could I?) Today is Daniel and I's 20 months! A year and 8 months is a really long time I am really happy. We were planning to do something fun but just hanging out is good for me and I really need to work so I don't thing it's going to happen. Speaking of planning, Daniel is planning something spectacular I guess for our two year anniversary. I really have no idea what it is and I love surprises (usually he's not very good at them but he is not even giving me any hints!) Why would he be planning something now that is going to heppen in November? Now I got to thinking about it dangit and I wont be able to stop. I'm excited and I can't wait.

      I slept in really late today and ended up watching Miss Congeniality. I love that movie. Then Daniel came over and we worked on a wiring harness. Tonight we're going to head to his house to hang out, watch movies, and go in the hottub. Pretty much a wasted day.

      Today my old friend Sarah came over along with some other friends Kayla and Kathryn (AKA Kit). Me and Sarah hadn't really talked&nbsp;like real friends since I started dating Daniel. Sure we hung out once and a while but not like we used to. I missed my friend and we had an awesome time. Kit and Sarah are both really really hyper so they all jump around and entertain me and Kayla. We seriously laughed all day today. I was flashed by Sarah at least 20 times. Oh yeah and we taught Sarah how to drive my car. She has a car and her liscense and everything but she had never learned how to drive a stick. So we taught her. And amazingly enough she only killed it like four times of driving like all over the place. She did so good I was jelous. She started on her second try. Wow. I think I witnessed a miracle. If I didn't mention before, I was also the one (along with my dad) who taught Sarah how to actually drive, an automatic. It was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. We went down some hill and almost flew off the road. My dad was reaching for the steering wheel the whole time. But now she's good. With a little practice, things do get better. Oh yeah and today we watched Moulin Rouge (Sarah and I's all time favorite movie), we know most all of the words and definately all the songs. We sang all of them, and Kayla, Kit and Daniel had really never seen the movie before so they yelled at us the whole time. It was great. At the end of the day when I was driving them down to the ferry, we decided to go drive by the swimming hole and flash the people there. Guess who was there? All the islanders who hang out at my house. Sarah stood out my sun roof and started to flash them but she chickened out so I had to drive by again, and this time, I honked the horn tons of times and everyone looked just in time to see her. LOL. It was great.

      It has been so hot in the past few days, and I haven't been home so I haven't written any. Friday Daniel brought his neice, nephew and one of their freinds over to the house (they are 3, 7, and 8). They had an awesome time swimming and things in the lake. Then I went back with them over to their house and ended up staying the night over there becuase mom never got home. I didn't sleep very well but somehow I had enough energy to get up at 7 to go to a car wash for swim team. So I went to the car wash only to be told that we weren't even going to be washing the cars. We handed out free tickets to some car wash down the street and asked people for donations.&nbsp;A radio station was there and some freinds got to go on the air. It was pretty cool but it was so hot outside that we were all miserable. Basically we were standing in the sun for five hours holding signs, jumping up and down, and screaming. Lastnight I almost lost my voice. We had a good time for being so miserable, it probably could have been worse. Oh well, we raised a ton of money. I got burnt a little but hey maybe it'll turn tan. I jsut woke up about half an hour ago and Daniel is supposed to be cooking me breakfast (he promised).

      I'm back at mom's house. Haven't posted in a while because for the last two nights I have been over at Daniel's house. Thursday I woke up with a really bad cold. You know the stuffy nose and really scratchy throat kinda thing. Daniel and I babysat his sister's kids from like 10-2 and then we drove out to his house and watched some movies and just hung out the rest of the night. Not too much excitement. Yesterday I still wasn't feeling very well but Daniel and I decided to go school shopping anyway. I really wasn't in a shopping mood (amazing because when do I not like shopping?) . Anyway, I wasn't in a shopping mood so basically all I did was help Daniel shop and I didn't buy anything. He bought some new shoes and a couple shirts and stuff and we looked at a few things for me but I was just feeling lousy. So then we went back to his house and watched more movies. Daniel's friend Billy ended up coming over and staying the night. We all went in the hottub for a couple of hours and just hung out. Today I woke up STILL feeling lousy. We ate some breakfast and then we were off again to do more shopping! (Daniel had to return a few things from before) anyway, we ran into Sarah and Kayla at the mall said hi and then came back over to moms. Great fun. At 7 we're going to babysit again so Daniel's sister can go to some party. Tomarrow morning I'm heading back to dad's and I need to work some more!

      Everyone woke up really late today around 12 in the afternoon. We hada late breakfast and late lunch so not much got done. Dad called and told us that if we didn't do all of our points then we would be grounded, I haven't done much so I guess I will be. I have been working on a wiring harness, except when the emchanic took it out of the car it belonged in, he accidentaly cut an important part off so the whole thing is just one big mess, not to mention, my dad doesn't have the correct book information for this harness so none of the wire colors are what their supposed to be and everything is really confusing. Our friends who are staying at the campground didn't stop by at all today. Usually they come over and are out on the lake all day, but they didn't make an appearance. Maybe that's because it was raining all day. At the moment, there is a little sun shining on the lake but there is probably just a hole in the cloud because everywhere else looks shitty.

      Amanda, Sami, Jenny, Mackenzie, Jeremy and I all went tubing today. It was really awesome because Chad took us and his boat is bigger than dad's. The wake is twice the size and the boat is twice as fast. we took turns and we got some really good whip and some really great waves. Sami caught the most air out of all of us. I never fell off, Jenny almost stayed on the whole time except Chad decided to whip them really hard and dumped all four of the tubers. Our cousin Paige is also out, dad inveted her to hang out with Amanda because she is living with our grandma now. I think she's going to stay here for a while because she's having fun. Oh eyah, Sami and Amanda got in a huge fight that only lasted for about 20 minutes and now their friends again. I guess Amanda let Sami borrow her belt and accidentaly left her towel on the floor after swimming. Amanda got mad at her telling her that she never picks her towels up, so Sami, being the joker called her a "bitch" and Amanda took it seriously and took her belt back and then neither one wanted to apologize so I had to hear both sides and solve it. Of course I chose Sami's side because she is the sweetest girl and would never do anything rude to her friends, Amanda on the other hand, does things she doesn't notice. She acts rude to people and doesn't even think about it. I'm kind of like that too we jsut can't help it. Oh well, it happens to the best of us.

      Today was going to be a real lazy work day. Then our friends who were supposed to show up on Thursday appeared out of nowhere. Chad is the dad, Jeremy is the 15 year old son, Cheyanne is the little girl, and Brittany is the oldest girl who is 18. They also brought some friends Matt and Mike. Brittany didn't come this time, she's pregnant and staying with her mom. So, since we weren't expecting a bunch of people to arrive, of course the house was a huge mess and we had to clean it up, very quickly. The whole floor got vacuumed and mopped and the kitchen got cleaned and all the bedrooms, and laundry got started, and we even cleaned up lake toys outside. The house went from very dirty to sparkling in half an hour. This, if you know my house, is like a miracle because my house is pretty big. Our friends went to go put there boat in the water and by the time they got back it was clean. Anyway, since all the cleaning is done, Amanda and I are really excited to get tubing! Chad is a really good tubing driver. He is tons of fun and also really careful. Oh yeah, I went to pick up Amanda's friend Sami and I ran into Kyla, she said she missed me and wanted to come over! wow. We hadn't talked in a while and of course I felt the same way. Why didn't I call her? I have no idea, I'm just wierd like that. Anyway, Sarah also want's to come over so it'll be one big party over here at my dad's.

      I'm beginning to think that I have way too much time on my hands. I think I need a real job where I actually have to work certain hours because otherwise I don't think I will ever get anything done. Zack said he could probably get me a job at the gym and I think that would be cool. Except for the fact that swim starts in a couple of weeks and school in about a month so it's not like I will have time to work. That's why working for my dad is perfect, I get my own hours. Problem is I'm very lazy, and I always procrastinate. Today, I slept in late, layed around all day, did a little bit of cleaning, helped Daniel wash his car, cooked dinner, and talked to people online. Woohoo. What a great day. At the beginning of the summer I made a plan to workout every morning at about 6 for an hour, then I would work for my dad for 2-5 hours and that would leave me with the rest of the day to do other things. The problem is, I haven't done that once. I am a really organized person and I love organizing things and getting things ready but when it comes to doing things, I am not very motivated, and I hate that about myself! If I would just do things and get them over with, I would be so successful in anything!

      Daniel had a lot of fun shopping. He got four pairs of jeans for like 20 dollars each, undershits, boxers, socks, some gym clothes, running shoes, and a few collared shirts. The store was having a huge sale so we got like 50% off the total purchase, and ended up saving 250 dollars. I have a hard time finding clothes that fit me because I'm tall so I have to buy long sized jeans at certain stores, and a lot of tops dont fit me, they all end up being short and wide. I noticed that as sizes go up in t-shirts, the width just gets bigger and the length stays about the same. So I try to find a longer shirt and I can't, because they only get wider! Anyway, I did find a really cute open-neck cable-knit sweater and it ended up being 16 dollars total. I think I should have bought two because sweaters are also a hard-to-find thing for me. I am just a hard person to shop for. And I'm picky, put those together and I'm never happy! Daniel and I are heading back to dad's in about half an hour.

      It's August 1st and I'm still at mom's. It get's really boring over here because all there is to do is watch tv and surf the web. There is a nice trail down the block that we sometimes go walk on, but I just woke up so that is not going to happen. Although I do need to start working out. Zack said he could get me a gym membership for 20 bucks a month because he's working there now. That's what I need to do, get a job at the gym so that I can't avoid it. Anyway, today I'm going with Daniel to go shopping for some new clothes. His parents buy him clothes for school once a year. Mine usually do except both of them are a little short on money so I have to buy my own! I'm a spoiled brat and I'm not used to that.

      Mom was home when I woke up. Lastnight she went sailing with her boyfriend Billy and I guess they had some engine troubles so she got stuck out on the island. She must have taken an early ferry over because I didn't sleep in too late this time. Daniel wants to go to his house sometime today but that takes a couple of hours so we probably wont do that until later. Sarah wants to hang out and so we'lll probably do that soon. Other than that, I have no idea what I'm doing today. I was just getting ready to take my mom to pick up her car that is finished being worked on at my dad's shop but then she went and decided that she didn't need a ride because she is just going to take another vehicle in for an oil change. And now I am stuck here with nothing to do. Daniel just finished mowing the back lawn for my mom and then he took a shower. We might go shopping today but that probably wont happen unless I go with my mom because Daniel wants to go tomarrow. Maybe I'll go both days. Exciting isn't it? Oh yeah, I'm going to get my hair cut soon because it is getting really long. Daniel is mad because he loves long hair. It bothers me so I never wear it down... I'm cutting it to shoulder length. Fun.

      Today I had to get up early because I needed to finish the harness by 12 and then get ready to go to town by 2:40 so that I could deliver the harness and pick up a check. Anyway's I did that. And then Daniel and I went to Target to pick up a birthday present for his nephew (Ryan) because I totally forgot it was his birthday. Then we went to his birthday party and all of that was done by 8:30. Then Zack came over to my mom's house and we hung out for a while. We were going to watch a movie but Zack had to by home by 11 so we didn't really have time, so instead we decided to go drive around which ended up being really boring. Then we came back here and have been sitting around doing not much at all. Zack has to leave really soon and my foot itches really bad because apparently there is some mysterious nasty spider in my bed who likes to bte my toes. One night I got two bites on my second smallest toe and then lastnight I got two more, one on my big toe and one on the toe next to it. It itches so bad I want to cry. Anyway, I really need to go shopping because I have some money now and I need to start buying school stuff. Mom said something about going to a movie tomarrow we are thinking about seeing the Bourne Identity but I don't know if I want to waste money, I think I would rather buy clothes.

      So after blogging yesterday I went back to bed to get some more sleep and ended up not waking up until 1:30 in the afternoon. Then I sat around for another hour until I started working on a new harness. This one was one of the ones that we like to call a "pain in the ass". Some of the earlier models are a real pain because they are a huge mess, not a lot of the information we have is correct, and there are a lot of wires that must be disconnected and reconnected for specific reasons. Anyway, dad does these kinds of harnesses for a little more money than normal because they a such a pain. The shop that he has charges something like 700 dollars for a harness to be mailed to you and not installed. I get 125 usually. But this harness they were getting 100 dollars more for because it is such a pain. It is not any more work for the people at the shop or for my dad, only for me, as far as my dad says anyway. So don't you think that I should be paid for the extra work that I have to do? I spend at least 2 hours more than usual doing work and since I don't get paid by the hour it doesn't make any difference. But where does this extra money go? To the shop. And they aren't the ones doing the extra work I am and I don't get paid extra for it? Dont you think there is something wrong with that? Oh well shit happens. So I worked for a while on it and then went to bed. woohoo.

      I went to bed at something like 2 in the morning lastnight. Normally I sleep in until at least 10 but I got up at 8:30. The neighbors a few houses down are clearing a lot and they have some big Cat over there and the thing is moving trees. The problem: every time it moves it beeps. Very loud. And I live on a lake so it echoes. Nice. I'm so tired I could fall asleep in this chair. The couch looks pretty nice too.

      Just got back from watching a bunch of meteors up in the sky. There was a few big ones but nothing too awesome. Okay correct me if I'm just being gay but this kinda makes me angry. I went to pick up Kyla at about 9 then we came back here and all the people who were doing the jumps decided they were going to go to Julieta and Luisa's house who Kyla is really good friends with and who used to be friends with me but now we are just kind of acquaintances, sometimes they will say Hi to me but not usually. Anyway's everyone was going to go over to their house for an hour or so before watching meteors so they did and Kyla all of a sudden remembered that she had left her guitar over at their house so she wanted to go over there and get it. So we did and on the way over Kyla kept talking about how the people that were at my house were all lame and boring and stuff. Then we got there and she was all talking with everyone and hanging out like having a good time and of course I am uncomfortable because I barely talk to the people and I don't really like hanging out with people there anyways. So Daniel and I are just sitting there waiting for Kyla to "get her guitar". Anyways, we are there for like half an hour until people start leaving to go watch the meteor shower. Then Daniel and I kinda went outside and Kyla said she was going to be there in a minute and 5 minutes later she came out with her guitar and was very unhappy I could tell by the look on her face (I have known her since 1st grade). Anyway I knew that she didn't want to hang out with me, she never does, so when she got in the car I told her she could stay there if she wanted to. She was like "Can I? You're not going to be mad are you?" YOU FUCKER. If you have to ask then you should just assume you are doing something rude that you shouldn't do. Anyway, stupid Megan told her that it was okay and that she didn't care. So she fucking got out of the car and left without a thought. I mean really, call me wanting to hang out, make me come get you, make me take you to get something from somewhere I have never even been with people I never even talk to, and then totally ditch me. It's been a long day and I'm going to bed. By the way it is past midnight!

      Everyone should be very proud of me because I have just learned how to post pictures on here. I am so happy with myself. Anyway, a bunch of the island guys set up this jump thing on the dock at the lake and they jump off of their ramp into the lake. Woohoo. Anyway, today Sarah, Kayla and Julie came over to my house and hung out. We went tubing and had tons of fun, swam for a very long time and started to watch The Prince and Me. It was good except we had to stop it to take them to the ferry. Kyla is going to come over and hang out for a while and we are probably going to watch the guys jump some more. Here is Sam going off the jump.  urlLink

      Okay. So I went to take my sister to the ferry at 8 and I ran into Kyla. I hadn't seen her in like a week and neither of us had called each other so we decided to hang out tonight. I went home and took a shower and then went to pick her up. I told her about the party that Daniel and Alex went to and she decided she wanted to drive so we went. A few people were drunk but most of the poeple were watching a movie on someones laptop. So I had 2 beers and one of them was the apple smirnoff and it was soo good. Anyway nothing happened to me but a few of the guys were really tipsy. Then someone decided to ask me and Kyla to kiss or something. She had kissed a few of her friends before so she wanted to but I wasn't really in for it I wanted the guys to kiss but they wouldn't so I decided why not? And we did. Exchange of tongue and gum and everything. She said after that we had the whole grab the face thing going on but I didn't notice. The guys liked it. Daniel was encouraging but then after I think he decided it isn't the coolest thing to have your girlfriend kiss other girls. I think he might be a little jelous. At the moment he is driving drunk people home while I am here safe and sound. He said it feels like it should be considered cheating and I think that if he feels that way I wont do it. I only did it because him and everyone else wanted us to it's not like me and her are gonna get together and mess around. Anyway, I love Daniel so much. Oh and tomarrow Sarah and Kayla are going to come over. Sarah wants me to get her drunk, I think she is crazy. Whatever she wants. Also, Woody (the party guy and beer supplier with a fake ID) and someone else were talking about partying tomarrow night too so maybe Sarah will get her wish. I just realized... It's 12 at night so it already is tomarrow. Fun stuff.

      Okay so everything turned out to be an okay day other than the fact that I need money quick. We started screwing boards down for my loft and we worked on it all day today. Alex had a few people over earlier and it turned out that they were all planning to have a party at a place called the "Landing Pad". Daniel wanted to go so I told him he could, and I kind of wanted to go but I decided I needed to stay at home and work instead of going to a party and getting drunk with a bunch of dumb people. Not really. Yeah I do need to get out and do something but I couldn't because I was going to take a shower and there was no towels so I put some in the wash and they aren't done yet. I do want to go. Oh well. Daniel and Alex just left, I didn't tell them I wanted to go because I didn't want them to have to wait for me or come back and get me. I don't want to be a hassle. I would drive down there except for the fact that if I drank any I would have to find some sober person to drive my car back and I think all the sober people already have cars to drive. I'm stuck at home. Hopefully I will get some work done.

      Okay so I woke up really late this morning which usually means that I will be tired and lazy for the rest of the day. I brushed my teeth then walked downstairs to my brother and Daniel getting ready to work on my loft! Woohoo. This is good news because, you see, I have this loft in my bedroom at my dad's house and it has been sitting unfinished for like 6 years since we built the house. Who knows why they didn't finish it. But now we are. The process started at the beginning of the summer and the truth is all the boards and stuff have been sitting in my bedroom waiting for themselves to screw down for about a month now. I would do it myself except for the fact that they are 9 1/2 feet long and a foot wide and very thick. They weight sooo much and I can't even lift one. Obviously that started out my day as good. Usually when something good happens something else doesn't. Ann told me that dad would help me pay for school stuff. I asked him and he said he would never ever do that and Ann tried to back out saying that she never said it in the first place. That stupid liar. Okay. No names. Dude most of the time I do have a really bad memory but when it is something like this I DO remember and people take advantage of my bad memory and they say "Oh you wouldn't remember anyway. I know what I said better than you do." My sister is one person who does that all the time. Oh well it's their problem for lying. They're going to have to deal with lies hopefully in the future and then they will figure it out for themselves. Oh yes and there is more news. Dad has tons of harnesses for me to work on all of a sudden. Now I have to decide on working on my loft (which was promised to be finished by the end of the summer by my dad) or on working on harnesses (which is required if I want to buy school clothes. Girls need things like clothes). I really want to work on harnesses because my brother and Daniel don't need my help a lot to work on the loft but there is one problem. Dad forgot to do the first step on the harnesses that he normally does. He cuts off the connectors not needed and I can't do that because I will fuck something up! Damnit now I have to wait till he gets home to work. ERRRG.

      So I've just been looking at digital pictures on the computer. We have a ton of them, and since my dad lives on a lake a bunch of them are us in swimsuits and bikinis. Know what I realized? I am really getting fat. I have gained quite a bit of weight in the last year and a half. Okay I'll tell my secret. I'm on the pill and I think that's why. No it's probably not but yanno might as well blame something right? That and I am very lazy. Anyway I have to go to the femanine doctor this month sometime so I think I might switch to something else. Any recomendations? Yea, it's too bad I dont' really need it that bad cuz Daniel and I don't hump like rabbits or anything. And it's hard to remember to take a pill every day! Okie Dokie. Need to do workout.

      Okay fine, I take it all back. Kit write a whole post about me in her blog. Although it was about us fighting over the dumb fish game we were playing. I was right. That's all that counts. Okay fine she was right too. It's all good. Kit is far away, I miss her and I love and and I want her to come back so we can make hot love. Just kidding. We are still lesbian lovers... right? Yeah I thought so. I love you!

      Too bad I am such a huge loser. I am sitting on the computer reading some friends blogs. Something I noticed: My name has been mentioned once in very small print on one of their sites. Dude. Do I not write about people like they are my friends? Yes I do, we have fun together and I consider them very good friends, return the favor ladies? I'm just not good enough am I? Oh well your fucking loss! I still love you. Sort of. Well, we'll have to see about that. Oh well, you can obviously tell by the lack of adventures in my blogs that I don't do much other than sit around at home. My life sucks. But there isn't much I can do about it, as far as I know. Maybe there is. When I figure it out I'll let you know.

      Wow lastnight was a blast, but I think I regret it becuase I don't want her to end up going through the same thing I did with experimenting. Daniel says that we should just get her shit-faced one time and she'll never want to drink again. I think it's a good idea but she is small and I don't think I want her to do it at all. Alcohol poisoning is not fun I hear. Oh yeah, lastnight Amanda insisted on taking a shower so we let her and when she get out she announced "I went pee in the shower and didn't rinse off." Great, piss on yourself and then get out right away, couldn't wait a few seconds to rinse? Guess not. I think Alex was a little mad at me for letting her, but I think it was a good thing that the first time she got drunk was with us and not someone else who we can't trust. A lot of people would have let her do some stupid stuff and we kept her under control, a little. Dad said he was going to be home today but I haven't heard from him yet so I don't know if he will be. I feel like shopping. Oh yeah, Ann said that dad would double the money I earn for school clothes and things, he didn't approve it yet but hopefully he will and then I can stop working and shop!

      So Daniel and I decided to give my 13 year old sister and her friend some Vodka. Neither of them have ever been drunk so we thought it would be really fun. Amanda ended up drinking 3 1/2 shots of 80 proof and little bit of 100 proof Yukon Jack. Her friend only drank 1 and a half shots of Vodka but she ended up being a little bit of a lightweight anyway. Within half an hour, they were both hot and outside. Then they started to get stumby and now they are talking slow, walking crooked, and falling over. Alex has friends over so this is our entertainment. Everyone is laughing at Amanda but she has no idea what is so funny. At one point I was laughing so hard I accidentaly peed my pants a little smidgin. Don't tell. haha. She is really really talkative and my brother doesn't seem very happy about it but I think she is hilariously tipsy. You can smell her breath from a couple feet away and her face is bright red. I keep thinking I wish I had a video camera right now. I think I want to buy a digital camera, but now is the perfect time for a camcorder. Wow they both just fell on the floor. They pretended to kiss when they were outside and now all the guys think they are lesbians. Fun stuff.  Two hours later: Amanda must be going crazy. She sucked my big toe, licked the bottom of my foot, ate peanut butter off her friends foot, and even hit on Daniel. She is acting very wierd, hopefully she will be embarassed or hungover tomarrow and learn her lesson. I doubt she is going to get sick.

      Back at dad's and already bored. Amanda got her hair cut and she looks more like a model now. Its right above her shoulders and layers a few inches and then she has bangs. She straightens her hair to a pin so it looks pretty cute but im just not used to the bangs, its wierd! Oh yeah jenny got the same hair cut also. I remember when everyone used to want to be matching all the time, gross. Dad went camping with Ann to Neah Bay and I have no idea when they are going to come back. They didn't even tell me they were leaving jeez I am way out of the loop over here.

      Ended up not going to dad's early this morning. Instead Daniel and I laid around watching tv untill the middle of the day. I've been on Alex's computer and maybe you will call me a snoop but I opened up a folder on his desktop of different stories, poems, and journals of his. He is a really good writer and he really enjoys doing it. I found out something new about him and I don't really know how to explain it. Maybe it's rude to put it on the internet but I think I am somewhat proud of him. Here's something that he wrote:    "Its difficult to explain the things that I feel, but I feel them and I want to record them however possible. I long for something, I know what it is, and I need it so much it hurts not having it. I feel I am a romantic, I dream of romance, I dream of the ways I will make women feel special. I need romance, I need someone to hold and hold me in return, I need the warmth of friendship, trust, love. I want to feel someone close to me that sees me and understands me, that hears my heart calling. I ache for someone to share my dreams with, to share her dreams with me, to make a bond so deep it cannot be broken whether by time or space. I want to love, and I do love. I love more than anything I know. I have just one problem, my love is either undirected or not returned. I do not know how to begin a relationship that could allow that love. I don’t know how to show them myself, to allow them to feel for me. Its possible I don’t know how to recognize when they do love me back."    I can't help but read more if you know what I mean. My brother does not come off as that type of guy, though he does keep to himself a lot and he is not the most social person in the world. I think I could publish a whole book of all the things he has written, and it wouldn't be a bad one either.

      Dad got home and then he took the boys tubing and Ann skiing. Nick and Ben (Alex's friends) came over because Ben got an old Volkswagen van. A really old one, and it's in really bad shape too. Yeah so I went with them to Nicks house to wash it. Exciting. Now I'm eating Reeses Ice Cream. Yum it is very delicous. Dad, Ann and the boys are watching Moulin Rouge and the tv room is right next to the computer room so I get to hear all the music. Awesome huh? Yeah, I get to do more shopping soon. Oh and on Thursday there is Artwalk in Tacoma and you can get into the Tacoma Art Museum and the Glass Museum free so I'm making Daniel go with me. I love the Glass Museum it is so awesome. They have a "Hot Shop" where you watch them blow glass and I think it is the coolest. Today I found out that the Van Gogh paintings were visiting the Seattle Art Museum and I totally didn't know that. I seriously am in love with him and a bunch of other artists that are exibiting there. There is even work by Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian, and Georges Seurat. I love art. Hopefully I will get to go, the exibit is there until September 13th. Anyway, I'm going to watch Moulin Rouge and sing all the songs. It's on the part where they are in the elephant and Satine is supposed to have sex with the duke but he isn't really the duke. Then Ewan McGregor sings and he's so hot!

      I have been literally sitting on my ass all day. There is absolutely nothing for me to do here. Ann got back at 2:30 and gave me 20 bucks for watching Jordan and Kyle. Then she gave me $40 that dad owed me. So that was a plus, sure I'll come over to dad's be bored for a day and get 60 dollars. Fun stuff. Not really I'm still bored. Daniel had to go home because tomarrow he is getting fillings. Dad got his shot and I guess it hurts. The doctor (and Ann who is also a doctor) said that it probably would hurt some more for a while and then in about a week it will get better. That would really suck. I have been playing internet checkers for a really long time and I keep losing. I think it's becuase I am so tired and bored.

      I woke up at 8 this morning and I felt really good. I was really energetic right away, I think that means I don't need to sleep in until 1 every day because it only makes me more tired. Anyway I came over to dad's at 9 and now I am babysitting Ann's son Jordan and his friend Alex, their 10 and really hyperactive. I didn't even bother to ask if I was going to get paid I just did it becuase I'm nice. Hopefully I will. Daniel was going to go running with Zack today, but instead, they went 4-wheeling. That takes so much excercise. Not. That boy is never going to be buff and I know it. Oh well I love him. Dad was supposed to cut off the connectors on a harness for me cut he didn't and so I can't work on it until he gets home. I know that Ann is coming home around 3 but I don't know if dad is coming with her or not. He went to the doctor. The boys are out swimming and I'm getting hungry.

      I love shopping. I woke up at 1 again today and I was really lazy until about 3 when I finally took a shower and got dressed and things. I wasn't ready for public until 4, then Daniel and I sat around for a while and at 4:45 we left to go shopping. Amanda decided to come with us so when Daniel stopped to get a hair cut at TGF cuts, she sat in the car with me waiting. I figured Daniel getting his hair cut would take probably 20 minutes at the most becuase he is a dude and it's a simple cut, I could have done it but he doesn't trust my creative side I have too much fun with things. Anyway so we stopped there and Amanda and I sat in the car for a whole 45 minutes waiting for him to finish. The lady even took him in right away too it's not like he had to wait at all. She was definately taking her time. Anyway, we did that and then we headed to the mall. First we went to PacSun so daniel could exchange a shirt that he changed his mind about. While he was doing that Amanda and I decided we were going to go to Wet Seal. But instead, we went the wrong way to the oppostire side of the mall and ended up at Ally Cat and Mervyns. I bought a really cute black top at Ally Cat and we only went into Mervyns to look at Chucks. They ended up being $40 there so I said definately not. Anyway the we stopped at Nordstrom to look at shoes and I still can't decide what kind I want to buy, I know I need new ones because I am totally stuck on my flip flops. Yeah so then we went to find Daniel and headed the right way to Wet Seal (he knew exactly where it was. why is that I have no idea.) Amanda kept saying that she liked all of the jeckets there better than the $100 jacket I already bought. I think my jacket is the coolest but noone else seems to agree with me. I must have made a mistake, we'll see how poeple look at me once it gets cool enough to actually wear a jacket. Anyway, I didn't buy anything there so we headed to Abercrombie. I bought a polo, two pairs of jeans, and a pair of cute khaki pants. Why they fit me when I went this time I have no idea. I did try on a different style so that must have been it. Dumb me. Once we were all done with that we went to American Eagle, but I was so tired and thirsty that I didn't feel like shopping anymore. Can you believe that? Yea. Tomarrow I have to go back to dad's. Ann is taking him in to get a Cortizone shot in his neck so the swelling goes down, he hurt his neck/shoulder somehow and he's been in a little bit of pain for a while so they are trying to fix it. Ann's kid Jordan, who is 10? is at dad's house with a friend and there are no other adults there so when they leave I have to babysit. Stupid me didn't even ask if I was going to get paid I just said yes. Dad said he has a harness I can work on so that's what I'm going to do all day. Hopefully he will have another one sometime this week becuase I need some more money and I need to get it by the end of this week because swim starts the 23rd and I'm going to have to be at moms from then on so I can go to practice.

      Mom called the emergency pet doctor and they said that we needed to clean Kitty's owwie and then leave it be for a few days and if it doesn't get better then to bring her in. Are they crazy? There is seriously a hole in her leg and I can see the muscle and the vein. My mom told them exactly what it looked like and they said that they don't consider that an emergency! There is a hole in my cats leg. If my mom had a camera I would take a picture and post it... I know it's nasty and noone would probably want to see it but you would definatley say that it is an emergency! Oh well we'll see what happens. Daniel, mom and I went shopping at the mall. I have a hard time finding jeans that fit me because I'm tall but when I shop at Abercrombie they usually have long sizes that don't hang down in the crotch or go up to my belly button (which I prefer not to have). Anyway, we went there and I tried on four pairs of pants all of which were totally different styles and none of them fit me right. I think I gained weight in some wierd place because they felt really odd. You know how sometimes the pants are tighter in some places than in others? Well they were all like that on me! I also tried on a few pairs at American Eagle. It was really wierd because I tried on long sized pants and they were barely long enough. It like their long sizes aren't really long. Oh well. Anyway, I still need to buy pants and that was really what I was going for today and I didn't even buy one pair. I did buy a really cute jacket from Abercrombie though. It's a short trench and it's like a cotton candy pink and I am in love with it. I also bought a coral colored sweater that goes off the shoulder. God I love shopping. Zack just rang the doorbell so I better go hang out.

      For my last birthday, Daniel bought me a kitten. She is white with a black head and tail. She is the most adorable thing you have ever seen and I love her soo much. I haven't really given her a name. I call her kitty out of habit but her vet records say her name is Z. I call her that sometimes but not as much as Kitty. Recently she has become more of an outside cat so I don't see her that often especially because I've been at my dads a lot lately. Today when Sarah was still over I saw her for the first time in a week or so. I picked her up but she didn't really seem like she wanted to be held, so I held her front legs together and petted her stomache like I do a lot of the times, she usually stays in my lap or arms, but this time she really wanted to get away and I didn't know why until Sarah pointed out that she was bleeding. I didn't think it was a big deal at first but of course I wanted to look at it. There was a nickel sized hole in her back left leg where there was absolutely no skin at all. I could see her muscle and a vein just sitting there exposed. She wanted to go outside so badly but I was so freaked out of course she was not going outside. Mom said that she probably got attacked by a racoon or something. It scared me so bad. I called the Pet Doctor right away but apparently they are closed on Sundays, mom said we could call the emergency pet place but they are way more expensive. She is calling right now to see if she will be okay until tomarrow or if we should take her in. I think we should take her in but we'll see.

      Sarah did end up coming over and something really wierd happened. Daniel, Alex and I were talking to my mom about a couple of the times we have been drunk and then she asked us what we liked to drink... then she went and bought us beer! It was really wierd. Anyway, Zack came over also. I don't know how much I drank but I know I was drunk. Sarah was too. Daniel and Zack were at least buzzed and my brother was just buzzed. We walked around the neighborhood, and Sarah and I kept having to pee so we ended up peeing in people's yards. I also ran through someones sprinkler. It was quite fun but I don't think it will happen again, at least not with that group because a few wierd things happened. Anyway we didn't end up going to sleep until four in the morning. Mom said we were loud all night but we thought we were being pretty quiet. Zack left at around 9. The rest of us woke up around 11 and then ate a huge breakfast. Daniel had to leave at 1 to go babysit for his sister and Sarah and I have been sitting around doing nothing. She just left too because she had to go babysit.
