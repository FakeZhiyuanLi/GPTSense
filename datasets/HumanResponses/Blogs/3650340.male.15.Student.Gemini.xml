        Life as I see it...     Life as I see it, and would like others to see it... is not a destination but a journey, Life as I see it is much more than just fame, praise or money.  Life as I see it is the sunshine of hope even in the darkest hours, Life as I see it is beautiful even like a grave topped with flowers.  Life as I see it is happiness even when everything around is sad, Life as I see it is patience even if you're getting mad.  Life as I see it is forgiveness to even the biggest mistake, Life as I see it is giving even when you desperately need to take.  Life as I see it is smiling even at the toughest of times, Life as I see it is even in a storm, the sweet ringing of chimes.  Life as I see it is a small boat sailing even in the turbulent sea, Life as I see it is thanking and appreciating for friends and family.  Life as I see it is a bird with broken wings, who still dreams to fly, Life as I see it is maybe not always success, but never failing to try.  Life as I see it is only truth and nothing less, Life as I see it  is not perfectly arranged, but not also a total mess.  Life as I see it is accepting and learning not to complain, Life as I see it is silence, for others, even when you're in pain.  Life as I see it and would like others to see it... is a gift, given only once, Enjoy it, live it and use it for people to remember you always..even when death comes.         Tejas

      This is my poem, based on a story told to me by Teacher in 10th grade. Truly inspiring…    The Old Man     Once, long ago, in long gone days, There lived an old man of olden ways.  The old man living in a mountain cave, Was extremely wise and philosophically grave.  From far and near people sought his advice, And the old man was established- a sage, very wise.  Then upon one day, a young man, proud; Pondered at the old man, amidst the seeking crowd.  “I’ll prove him wrong!” the young man decided, Down the hill, into the forest, he ran excited.  His first glimpse caught a butterfly, delicate And he thought, looking at the creature small yet great…  “I’ll ask the old man, if it’s dead or living, And wait for the sage’s answering.  “If he answers, “alive it is” I‘ll carefully crush it to bits!  ““It is dead” shall he utter, I’ll release it and let it flutter!”  With this ingenious plan to make the old man falter, The young man rushed, butterfly in hand, to the rock shelter…  “Is it alive?”, he asked the old man carefully, The wise sage, however, didn’t answer immediately.  The impatient young man, waited with a frown, As the old man summed him from up to down.  The old man then spoke, with a smile benign, “It is in your hands, son… Not mine…”     Tejas

      The rainy season in India, called monsoon, is a long awaited spectacle. And I as a child have always enjoyed it…     The Sweet Monsoon     The gentle breeze,  The swaying trees;  It touches my heart, The rattling wheel of the bullock-cart  The sweet wonderful monsoon, I hear and watch the rain at noon.  It’s come, the awaited rainy season, Children splashing water, for no reason!  Water, splashing in the puddles, To its mother, the young chick cuddles.  I see no one running for shelter, The rainwater is so pure and tender.  Farmers happy, their crops’ thirst quenched, To the rainwater, with joy they clenched.  Earthworms peeping from small holes in the mud, Commencement of spring awaits the wet flower bud.  Soon it’s silent, the rain is over, Sneezing children running for cover.  The refreshing smell of the fresh grass, Takes me into another world trans.  It’s over, the awaited monsoon, I hear and watch the rain at noon…      Tejas

      I live by the seaside, and this is one of my poems in ode to the mighty sea…     The Sea     With a soft heart and moist eyes I see, At the far end of the horizon is the violent sea…  It’s like a dream as if you’re in paradise, The waves of the sea gushing at your feet feel so nice.  Life itself seems like a miracle, As I see people swimming and a kid ride a cycle.  The fish jump up with utter glee, The Kingfisher zooms down, for a meal free.  Soon calmness falls over the sea, It sparkles in the shadows of the city.  The throng returns slowly to its domains, As the nightwalkers come out in chains.  The orange Sun sets in the West, Only to pop up again at its best.  The Moon is just out, And silence lays all about.  The Moon falls into the Sea, And the daffodil awaits the buzzing bee…     Tejas

      This is one of the poems which I'm writing as I type:     WITHIN NOT WITHOUT    "The human heart is always searching, Searching for love , not within, but outside.. The mind is constantly wanting, Wanting for a companion by its side... The eyes are always seeing Seeing but with secrets to hide.. The lips are constantly needing, Needing a cause to grin and smile wide.. But it is not beyond but within our own mind, That happiness flows and forms a tide.. A bird of joy within your heart, a friend by your side, Look in the mirror and see it through your eyes--in yourself, God's special Child."    Tejas

      This is my first post, so I don't know what to write exactly, but therez this nice poem I wanna quote:    A LIFE OF WORTH    "It is not what the world gives me, In honour, praise or Gold; It is what I do give the world, So others unfold. If by my work thorugh life can another soul unfold Then I have done what cannot be made good by praise or gold. One tine thought in a tiny word may give a great one birth, And if that thought was caused by me, I have lived a life of worth."    Richard W. Wolfeworth

      I read this really nice couplet written by Mirza Ghalib(Urdu Poet):    "I wish to be a river always in motion, Thus I disdain the death like stillness of the Banks..."    Tejas

       A True Friend    A true friend is one in whom sparkles the meaning of truth, A companion forever- in days of aging and in days of youth…  A friend in need, they say, is a friend indeed, But a true friend is one of perennial good heart and good deed…  A friend is a shelter when the weather is stormy, Calm or storm, a true friend is one who’s always there for me…  A friend is one, who’ll lie to save me from trouble, A true friend is one who’d stop me from telling a lie even most subtle…  A friend is one who’d walk beside me on the road I choose A true friend is one who’d out of disturbing waters, help me to cruise…  A friend would openly ask for my things, which he found nice, A true friend would teach me that instead of refusing, it is better to sacrifice…  A friend would be there to console me if ever I fail, A true friend would help my life’s boat, towards success, sail…  A friend would appraise my qualities and ignore my mistakes, A true friend would try to correct my faults, whatever it takes…  A friend would be there to celebrate my success, A true friend would rather shy away, and be there when I’m in distress…  A friend is a helping hand and a person you can trust, A true friend is a supporting arm and trusts nothing but truth first…  A friend would consider nothing better than our friendship, A true friend would rather hear the truth from my lip…  A friend you can search amongst hundreds and make, But a true friend is a small Island in life’s enormous lake…  Ask for truth and you shall receive, a treasure greater than gold A true friend, along life’s road, will bring you joys untold…  Every joy he’ll share, every pain he’ll soothe, A true friend is one in whom sparkles the meaning of truth, A companion forever- in days of aging and of youth…        Tejas

      (This is a story I wrote for an on-the-spot Story Writing Competition at school, where we were provided with the first and last lines of the story.)   “BUT WHO KILLED HIM??”   The clock had just struck twelve when the man in the black coat knocked at the door of the house. Nothing…He knocked again. Nothing yet again. It had started raining a few hours ago…He knocked again. No one. Perhaps no one was at home.But then the lights were on.. The rain slashed against the big glass windows of the house and the wind seemed to moan in his ears. Perhaps he should go back. He was, as it is, drenched from head to toe. He turned around hesitantly. The black, moonless night stared at him. He could see nothing for miles. This was the only house on the vast, barren moor and it stood out like a glowing pearl in the dark night.  He’d started at seven o’ clock in the evening. His search had made him cross the length of the moor several times. The moor was atop a huge hill and at the end of the infertile expanse was an unfenced cliff and a deep valley below. It was almost dusk when he’d given up his search and started looking for some place to rest. And he’d found this- a solitary house amidst the intimidating land.  Just then, a bolt of lightning flashed across the sky. The house gave a low shudder. He’d better go. He started to walk towards the front gate. He’d just opened the latch, when the door of the house creaked open. And for the first time the light from inside illuminated his surroundings. He saw an unkempt garden, a broken old-shed and at the edge of the garden was…a tombstone! Should he go see whose it is? Naah, the very idea gave him the creeps. Well, atleast he could go into the house now.  He went in to find and empty house (with lights on). He called out several times but to response only from mute walls. Well, he’d make himself comfortable. He could explain to the occupants when they came. He looked to see himself in the light…his black coat was dripping and his nameplate shimmered with water- “COLONEL J. RICE”. It had been his army instincts alone that had kept him going for the past five hours. The house thundered again and he felt a chill in his spine. He felt someone was behind him- he turned…but it was his imagination. Or maybe his hunger-he hadn’t had anything since lunch. He went into the kitchen- some bread and butter, a roast chicken, fruits…but he couldn’t eat that.No he couldn’t eat  that …   It was nearly two o’ clock and the owners hadn’t arrived yet. He wasn’t going to stay awake the whole night waiting for them, he’d explain in the morning. He went into the bedroom, took out his coat not bothering to pick up his fallen name plate.  “Ah! Sleeping on your own bed after so long feels nice…”he said to himself. Slowly, the beautiful world of dream enveloped him…   He saw himself ; a young Jeremy Rice of fifteen. His parents, his animals, the farmhouse, the big farms. CUT! He was now a Lieutenant in the Army, he saw his comrades marching next to him. CUT! He was back for the first time, after 12 years of duty, to his house. But there was no house, no farms…everything had been burnt down. Nothing was left-except a barren, vast moor…CUT! His own son, a Lieutenant had bought a house on the same moor. He was now a grandfather and his grandchildren loved him. CUT! One moonless, night he’d gone alone for a stroll on the moor. When his legs could no longer carry him, he’d rested at the edge of a cliff. He was sitting…when unknowingly two hands pushed him into the darkness…   He slept peacefully after that.  The rain had stopped and the sun shone brightly the next morning, when the Rice family drove up to their house. The kids rushed in. Major Rice and his wife went to the garden. Just then, young Jeremy (he’d been named so after his grandfather) came running with a nameplate in his hand.  ”Whose is this father?”   Major Rice looked morbid when he saw it,” Why, it’s your Grandfather’s! But how did come here? I buried it myself in his grave”.   “How did he die, father?”, asked Jeremy.  “He’d gone out one night and never returned. Fell of a cliff...or pushed as some say…We’ll never know. We didn’t find his body, so we buried his belongings.”   “But who killed him?”   “We’ll never know, son...no one knows…”     “Wow!! Cool story, Grandma!! Really spooky! Can we hear another one! Please, Grandma!! ”, said the kids. Grandmother, however, could not take it anymore…for her it was no story…for her it was the truth. She was Mrs. Jeremy Rice and her husband had gone out a few years back, never to return...She’d always dreamt of him coming back to her...to his family. She’d never lost hope…A tear trickled down her cheek. She went out of the house and picked up a blooming flower from the garden. She then went and placed it atop the tombstone at the edge of the garden. She smiled as she read the name engraved on it, “In Memory of COLONEL J. RICE- Rest in Peace”.  Bu whatever her pains, she was happy- atleast the kids had enjoyed every moment of it!   Tejas
