      Thats part one. And since that episode was after midnight this all counts as ne horrifying day.   But it does get better.   Woke up.  Very  unstable. I wanted to kick out at the walls. I didn't care whether I broke my toe or not. Resisting the urge I understood but can't control, I got ready for school. (I have to say first- I don't want to kill myself. I don't want to kill  myself.  I don't want to kill myself.  And its not one of those things that if you believe it enough its true. Vraiment.) First thing I fucked up: getting myself late for school. When I came in I only had 45 minutes to prepare myself for English lit exam. Clever(!) Second thing I fucked up. This is big. I forgot my mice of men book. This is the equivalent of forgetting your calculator at a maths calculator exam...you had no idea how on the brink I was. I felt like everyting was just clamping down on me and I was dissolving into liquid...no wonder I was crying so much....I went to the teacher and she told me off about how stupid I was so I just went downstairs, found a private toilet before I collapsed with tiredness and just sobbed, sad songs pumping through me (Goo Goo Dolls? Name?(that was the name of the song) Oh, and my best friend Ria wasn't even there! (she thought it was a pm exam...)   But it does get better.  There is a phrase I've thought of:  When everything   starts to go wrong, something is bound to go right soon!  As I found:- Teacher eventually gave me the book I needed.  I passed the exam(I think!) Maria managed to to do her exam (yay!) I got to chat to my best guy mate (Ash), and Maria's perfect boyfriend(Patrick) for hours...I feel like I've rekindled my friendship, and made new ones.  What a day. I'm too tired to analyse..however I will say this. I am ADDICTED TO HARRY POTTER SLASH. Especially gay Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy hybrids. The good ones are brilliant. The best ones are truly something to remember. Here's a link. Its called irresistible poison-you'll love it! urlLink http://www.schnoogle.com/authorLinks/Rhysenn/Irresistible_Poison/more2.html  Aurevoir Friends!!! Night everybody. I'll try to stay a little hopeful. Maybe, not even cut myself. Whatever. Bye...

      Today I had the closest scrape than to what you could possibly get to a public nervous breakdown. I had a terrible night last night. It was so hard to not cut myself last night. I have the idea that when I'm fine for a while, and the precise moment I think of cutting, or the fact that I'm doing so well, I end up cutting on the same night. Or the night after(tonight). So I, was in my battle with the scissor god(my nail scissors-weapon of choice), and I began to touch it again-v. dangerous. Then, I began to run the point along the veins of my left arm-easel of choice. And then, that thought, the horrible thought crossed my mind. I could feel the tension inside me building, all that anger and pain. The feeling of dark, sorrowful explosion which I feel moments before cutting. But, still, I carried on poking my veins, and the thought crossed my mind that maybe, just maybe, I should dig here, let the blood run out and maybe at last I'll fine what you're looking for... The moment it crossed my mind I was terrified and threw it across the room. Like a silly little girl I cowered on the other side of the bed, and tried to cry myself to sleep. It's all falling down.

      Please, I beg you, get me away from my brother...its study leave and hes finished uni so we're in each others more than usual and more than we'd like. Specially more than I'd like.. He's rude, annoying, intrusive and incredibly frustrating just how all big brothers should be. Everytime I make a distinctive sound(I'm v. quiet at home) I'm asked what happened-exactly. Every statement i made is challenged. Sure, I like(understatement) to argue but I can't stand the fact that every little thought I have may be analysed and criticised him, because if course theres always something wrong with it. So over the past 16 years I've developed a pretty good technique of masking anything I think and just becoming like every typical non-commital, bimbo little sister. This has made me seem like a cold heartless bitch who doesn't think for herself. Heartbreaking, but at least my brother leaves me alone. By the way-his names Elliott.  I dunno, he just has to know everything about me, even though you lot know way more about me than what he may ever know. He must have some logbook, "The Every Move of Betty B". Today it would have been  "Betty comes home from exam, ignoring my hellos as usual. Its the only conversation we have for the next two hours as she goes to her room with some junk no doubt and listen to the crazy racket she claims is 'music'. At 5:35pm she re-emerges, a miserable and bitter cow." End. Is this just me, or do siblings instill a great ability for making you feel horribly guilty for your existence everytime you walk into a room? This will probably be something I look back on after my nervous breakdown... Little did he know I was reading my new fave mag Diva...I knew about this about two months ago, but theres this Big Gay Out at Finsbury park-the nu Mardi Gras-Â£25! I swear you're supposed to pay for anything, I thought gayness was going back to basics, Ay-yay-nay... Had my Marks Gospel exam-after botching up an 8mark q I entertained myself by writng various hard-to-spell names on paper like maccaroni or equilibrium and millennium...they're cool words to spell, a great boredom buster. I wonder, if you could be a dear and send some hard-to-spell words please? I've got a two hour maths exam coming and I need something to for about the hour and a half of it.

      I won't be saying too much about myself today, I'm far more an observer. You see, I have a self-harm problem. I've been cutting myself for the last three years, four years in September now and I can't see a way out. But I do see a route. And if you find the route, couldn't just turn around and follow the route back out into happiness? Because before all of this shit, I was very happy. Estatically so, but I guess I really should know my luck. I cut because...I can create a hole, where all my bad thoughts can go in a mind ditch and fuck itself. It made sense last night. I was so angry and I had no idea why. You know the feeling you get when you've been caught in some sex ritual with someone by the police and your lover/your most embarrassing moment? The way you just want to be something else, or just disappear, die, or just be able to run and run and they would all forget about it, anything that will make them forget it ever happened...    Well, I find I'm feeling like this on a regualr basis. Its part of the reason why I cut. Is that so fucked up? I don't know, aargh I just wanna figure myself out before I burn out. i can so see it happening. I've never imagained myself at 40.

      Hmm, well my favourite things about a woman is her lips. They can show you the womans personality...you kiss and you talk about your fears and your life with your lips. I'm a very talkative person, so although the eyes are the windows to the soul, the lips present a two-way thing. They show so many moods and emotions and truths they may try to hide using their lips-it shows insecurity... I know when I fancy someone when all I could think about are their lips.. Also, a woman's sides...they lead to the hips and they beg to be touched...what do you think is so sexy about a woman? Straight guy, bisexual or gay woman? Speak your mind! ~I don't get scared easily... ;)

      Today? Well, my first exam (Marks Gospel-Re), is two days away, so I'm trying to revise. Which, in teenage speak means I'm doing everything possible to make sure I don't do just that..and I'm damn good at it. Then again, I don't really need to revise. I just don't-I'm clever and all, and believe me I'm modest about it... Anyway, I've got a blinding headache at the back of my head, where the neck and skull joins up-bit strange for an ache, don't you think? Even so, I guess its because I've been up till 2am writing a new story. It's about teenagers who love to kill, but are truly wannabes. It's not such a far out story. Annoyingly, every good story I think of gets taken by some other author who can actually write novels and they make loads of money. So, my ultimate idea, the idea I've been developing in my mind on a soft pressure cooker for three years, will remain quiet, alone till I actually write it. I did the IQ test, and I've gone down by 5! points-to 113. No good to me! lol, because I'm on my way to 8 A-A*s, and I've been considered a potential genius...but potential is shite...good motto. Tomorrow? I'd say more of my life story, if you don't mind Laters,

      To tell you the truth, i didn't think I needed a blog thing. I've already got a diary and all. But then today changed my mind. I will never, ever forget this week: I've graduated from High school and I've had my High School Prom-yet I'm from London-how american is that? Aaah, its been strange.  The people from high school are nice, but I barely know them...all I have are photos and a little excericise book full of good lucks and "I don't know you so well"'s...so apart from some tears, I don't miss High school at all!  The only reason I cried was because of this person I'm in love with...her name is Maria...she's fine with it, being that we're practically sisters, but I'm just missing her, and the fact I'm leaving HER to go to college. I don't think you understand how much I love her...you see.  Firstly she's the most beautiful girl in the world. She has longish blonde hair which is so soft and a firm stomach...when I get close enough to hug her I want to kiss her instead. It's shit being in love with your straight best friend, the person who you would die for, the woman who saved you, the person you love more than anyone else in this world. You may think I'm nuts and I don't blame you! I'm 15, I have parents who love me, lots of friends, why would I declare such a thing? Well, because my Dad's loving but cold, and my Mum doesn't know me. Barely. Is it too late to bond when you're 15? I don't know...good start to the rest of my life though. Lol.

       Song: The Streets (Dry Your Eyes Mate)  I sigh with relief. If this was couple of days ago, this song would have me bawling my eyes out. Now I can just listen to this, and unwind. I've been on my knees washing the bathroom for the last two hours.   I went to my therapist yesterday-shes nice enough, and blames everything on my mother. Ok, not everything, but she gives me enough to think about. I guess I should tell you the story:  When I was 6 months old, my mum left me. She was lying to my Dad and bro, not telling them she was a Jehovah's Witness. And because Dad just couldn't become one as well, mum had to choose between us and her religion (they don't allow Jehovahs and non-Jehovahs to be in the same family), and she chose religion.   So, 'sad' story. How does this affect me? All my life I've figured I don't need mum because she never really was one-she visits and says she loves me and I love her back-but she's not really a mother. My therapist(this is when she comes in) says that I was too young to understand the sadness I felt when she left and I didn't have any breast milk. And because I didn't have the emotional IQ I was a brat and I was misunderstood and seen as a stupid evil demonchild. And I always told myself to be independent and never feel sorry for myself, because I have a decent life, in some way or another. Thats why because when I was in year 6 or 7/8 I seemed quite blank. I was a fantastic actress. For five years, pretty much everybody believed I was this happy go lucky, larger than her pants lass.   And I went nuts because I could only find sadness when I delved, and I was letting go because I found I don't really care about my GCSEs at all. So, my the. says I should tell her a little bit about how I'm feeling, and I was thinking, maybe, come out to her. I've been having nightmares(she kills herself and then blames me because she says she can't live as the mother of a gay daughter. Nice.) and maybe just writing about them should end them...  And also, she said I have to let go of this image of myself: this fat, ugly, stupid, worthless bitch. It might have came from when I was twelve-scratch that it was probably primary school.   I still have to go in to school because some teachers just enjoy escaping me, for the hell of it. But thats next week. Annoyingly, I've realised I've got too much going on: seeing Ria on Friday(hopefully), then Pride AND Childrens Express on Saturday, then I'm seeing Mum on Sunday and I'm not ready to say anything just yet, unless she initiates it.(I am not running away.)Thats all for now, folks!

      Here, is one of the first articles I@ve written. It can be improved-it needs a counter argument, but I like it as it is at the moment. Anyway, read, read!   The Generational Clash    In the run-down palace of the world, the Americans worry in their shield of oil, guns, crucifixes and hamburgers. Everyone is out to get them, from terrorists, to environmentalists and pacifists. Yet these problems are mostly the consequence of power and blind decisions. The world with its variations and magic, focuses on one nation.  That nation is going out of control with change and revelation. Once safe under the enchantment of religion, in itself, America tries to hold to this image in the wake of a new generation. Ultimately, these new contemporaries will succeed, but in this modern day it struggles for freedom-in this case, the free will of sex.   The fight against the liberty of sexuality is led by George. W. Bush, who has invested millions of dollars in the campaign for abstinence. Organisations such as the Silver Ring Thing spread themselves across American schools, drilling messages, and the rights and wrongs to the so called âsex-obsessed youthâ. In America, the teen pregnancy rate is twice the size of Britainâs, diseases like HIV are getting to epidemic amounts and teenagers are having sex at a younger age. You could say that the new age of sexual freedom from marketing and television has poisoned our minds. Or maybe in this world where sex sells, our confusion is at a peak, and all we want is some direction, a bit of comfort on the rocky world of adolescence. But whose thoughts are those? Parents, teachers, teens, politicians?  From my observations and thoughts, thatâs not how parents think. Parents the world over are scared for their children. They worry when they fall and scrape their knee, when they leave for school and have their first relationships. Parents fear teensâ vulnerability because of the new society. The generationsâ emerging sexuality, young peopleâs assertiveness and their confusion within it: parents are terrified of it all.   Uniquely, America has managed to turn disasters, such as wars into cash. In this case in the conflict for control, they have used fear as a chain of products to generate money. In the last ten years, 2.5 million teenagers have taken the pledge to not have sex till theyâre married at the convenient price of $12. The moral crusade for abstinence is big business. They are herded into another world by being preached to: in that world condoms donât work, sex is dirty without a piece of paper, and all we need to get by is the unwavering, never-ceasing belief that God is good and righteous.   I feel that this can only stifle people, with their desires and queries, and that makes me incoherent with anger. How dare the politicians and sermonisers shove and bully my generation into a new wave of fear and confusion? If you tell people condoms donât work, why would they use them? If the preachers dare to take off their crucifix-encrusted sunglasses, they can reminisce about when they were young and confused and they themselves were being herded into conformity by their elders. Do they really expect all the teenagers to stay celibate? This economy of fear and bullying can only lead to dangerous times and disastrous epidemics, all for the sake of control.   I can never understand when I hear people talking about how sex is wrong and wicked. When itâs safe, and when itâs consenting, sex is one of the most beautiful natural things in the world. If the government pushes one single ultimate choice in a world where variety makes the world go round, you are only placing people in a corner, and these days the people in corners fight back. It may have decreased teenage pregnancies, but what about teenage misery? Denying yourself to a person you love because of a scrap of wood pulp and the wrath of the government, dressed up in a priestâs robe, can only pave the way to craziness and extra angst that our youth donât need. Parents need to experience the fear, and talk to their children anyway. Fundamentally I believe that is the best remedy for fear and coping with new age things: to confront them, find the comfort in them, maybe even understand them. Thatâs the only way we will defeat our perils. That way we can rid ourselves of our cloaks to reveal our true persona.   What do you think?

      ...To when you roll the dice and swear your love for me." (Finley Quaye, Dice) At last, Britain is getting somewhere! Henman is in the fourth round-but its against Philippoussis,and hes pretty darn good. I love him. I'm very annoyed. I wrote an impossibly long entry yesterday, and then my computer gave up on me before I got a chance to publish...it was all very happy and I wanted people see that Hey! I can be happy...  Anyhow, yesterday was about getting my life and my summer organized. I'm part of this agency called Childrens express. It's Ok, and its very journalistic. I hadn't been down to Islington since February and so I wanted to make a good impression. Of course, my Dad is annoyingly blaze about my passions andwe were half an hour late and practically missed the whole thing. I didn't want to just be in and out so I searched for stories and stuff to do. Its strange because I've been there for three years and yet I've never done a proper story-just some roundtable discussions. So, I ended up talking with this guy called Samir about all sorts of politics. It was nice to hear someone so focussed and uncondescending, so young. Plans: HIV conference on Ria's birthday (20th July), and I'm working with Samir and Fikir on that one. Then maybe an article on cultural identity. Sorry, my brother's talking again..:why do I bother? He thinks hes soo impressive, and I feel when I hear him talk, that I've just heard all this crap, all before.  Tomorrow: hopefully, I'm really praying here, my last day in school before August-I have to find all sorts of teachers and I'm finally talking to my therapist about the last two weeks. I'm sure she'll have lots to say. Then i leave, and find a comfy job washing dishes, and do...stuff. I'm a feeling a lot stronger.

      I was supposed to spend an hour writing in my beloved blog, but I was reading Slash again. New link:  urlLink   This novel is called Underwater Light, and if you've all five Potter books, it can be a bit dizzying at times...but it's great. Don't worry-you'll love it-just read it slowly. I didn't, and I ended up reading all 17 chapters only to find that Maya, the author hasn't written a damn thing since March, and now I have to forget the masterpiece and avoid hyperventilating. Or losing control. Which is getting so impossible these days.  I'm losing it. Because I'm not hurting myself, or hitting/cutting/whatever the fuck else I do to myself just isn't happening anymore, all the blackness in me is overcome in my eyes. I almost burst into tears three times today. Two times yesterday. I want to cry now... I'm so angry-this is exactly how I usually feel just before I cut myself, as if I'm psyching myself up..I'm a sick bitch. A sick, fat, stupid, hated bitch. Except I've been predicted eight A/A*s, I'm 'portly', I'm perfectly healthy and apparently 'everybody loves me'. I just want to let it out, and scream, and scream, and cut. I haven't gone this long without hurting myself in some way since I was 13 and I had these brilliant few weeks when I was so normal I just let it be-I realised I was bisexual(at the time). And because of my life, it didn't seem so big.   After all, I'm not exaggerating-it has been a shit day (Portugal scored!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm such a cow-I'm British for God's sakes! Go on, Porto!)... I digress...what was I saying? Oh yes, today, it was my last exam, great because it was the last, that was it, no more uniforms or crap like that. However, I have now have no excuses for not making a mess of my life. And I'm so fed up, and I'm so tired, and so insomniac-inclined I know I'll be like this forever. And I lost Â£15 today-my birthday money-the money I was going to treat myself with-buy two books, maybe something from Oxfam...and I lost it-I'm so stupid-it was my fault. I didn't put in my purse and it was just loose money, in my big pocket when I could have helped myself...  Will add later    Fri 25 Jun:  I'm a bit calmer today. I didn't cut myself last night and that was all down to Nik. I sent him and Ashley (my mystery 'soulmate' in a nutshell) a text asking if they were awake. Nik replied at last night-he left his phone downstairs, but he was awake...so I told him how distant I feel from happiness-because I know I have a lot to be thankful for, and I know people like me, and i know that I can do almost anything at these moments, and all I was doing was crying, off-balance because I wouldn't let cutting balance me anymore-it was getting too dangerous...  So I cried to him in text messages (we never call each other-its like we're scared, or shy, or something) and he told me to Focus. On all the little good things. One little good thing, like the cool side of the pillow or the stars escaping us at night. Then I replied that he was one of the good things in my life, and that I was so lost. He hasn't replied. I don't blame him. I can't lose him. I have to get back on my feet, and get busy. My exams are over and I was never bothered about them to really try...I guess it'll all come undone August 26th, and I'll see what damage I have done. Nik, if you're reading this, I'm sorry if i scared/worried/annoyed you. Just email me, or text me, or something. You have no idea how much you helped me last night. Thank you.

      Two exams left!!! You can only be happy about that...(song:Jeff Buckley 'Sweet Thing') it went OK, I think I got a B, so that would mean I would get an overall A/A in science! In answer to CarpeDM's question, in Britain, because I'm in year 11, these exams are the end of my compulsory education. This means I don't have to go to college, I can finish off the rest of these exams and just start working for the rest of my life. But I ain't-I'm starting college in September, so that will be a big thing, because its a big change and from I've heard, it changes you. So, it'll be interesting to see how I turn out... I remember in the beginning of year 10 I was hoping to turn back to straight by year 11 bur I ended up going to the other extreme, lol. I never thought I'd turn out gay, but I guess no one really thinks like that, do they?   I realised I was gay on the 29th September 2003-its in my diary. Texting Nik and we were talking about celebrities and they all turned out to be female. I knew it wasn't just 'peculiar' anymore. I just wasn't finding men attractive, and I was realising that because I saw that men were fit it didn't mean I fancied them...so it sank in. And I realised, and I didn't have a fit. I was just perfectly calm, as I'm normally am. Thats all for now...

      Okay, yesterday=hectic. My Dad nearly ruined the whole thing. He insisted that he needed to drive me down, or I'd  definitely  get lost, 'because I'm so crap with maps'. Which is true, lol but I can handle myself. Thanks to him, a typo on the map and too many one way streets, I was over a hour late-past schedule. Poor Alice had to stand on Waterloo bridge with her green frog umbrella till I found her and I could escape my idiot Dad.(I understand his cares, but I could've handled myself).   The walk was great-we crossed a bridge-don't ask me which one and went past the Tower of London, then James' Park and it started to piss down. All we had was Alice's tiny green umbrella, so I ended up clinging to her for most of the walk. I hadn't been in this part of London for an age, so it was nice to look at all these places I hadn't been to for years-Buckingham Palace, London Dungeon, London Eye, Art galleries, St Paul's, a good Starbucks (Caramel Frappucino with everything on it) and the Millennium bridge, back of the London Tower(I couldn't recognise it and I was wondering what the hell a castle was doing in Central London). Me and Alice chatted and sang (Agadoo, Kumbaya, Laura-Scissor Sisters) and met some cool people: some fit girls who were fussing over their wet jeans, some guys in pink wigs we were racing against-and won!, a man who sang 'Love Boat' and talked a hell of a lot about it, and just lots of random ppl. It was a lot of fun, but my legs are still killing me-sign that I really should lose weight..? It was worth it. Althogether between me Alice and her friend Ann-marie we raised Â£130 for people with HIV-made me feel proud. I had finally done something that had made my life matter.   At Potters' fields, we rested on our knees in soggy grass and got our faces painted as butterflies. In a haze of pink and green, we made our way home separately. Dad was supposed to pick me up, but got stuck in traffic and I ended up going home by train, as I had originally planned anyway! Oh, the irony...  Now I'm just tired, and devouring books, and listening to Jeff Buckley...yesterday, after the whole thing I got bored and came up with the 'brilliant' idea to read my 12-year old diary. I wanted to see if my feelings when I was 12-feelings that have haunted me since-were better, worse or the same to whatever they are now. It was horrible-I wanted to cut myself, I went on and on about suicide like a broken record, scared Maria to death-she needed me as well because she was actually cutting. She didn't tell me at the time, but two years later and I've beaten myself up about ever since, because she's one of my great loves. It wasn't a good year-panic attacks, solvent abuse etc and I didn't get any of it-how could I? That was when all the barriers set up when I was younger were reinforced with titanium.   I think I got the same sort of feelings, but less confusion because I know I'm not actually crazy and apparentely lots of people feel the same way and its a clinical depression. I can be saved(if I want to). Hmm, what I'm annoyed about in this blog, is that I'm so depressed. Its all about depression. I do smile, I have a great sense of humour, when I'm not alone and as long as there is something to distract me, there's a lot of laughter in my life. So the answer's simple-gotta start getting busy again. I have to go now-I'm setting up a bath to try and unstiffen my leg muscles, then I'm revising-I'll put more meat on this later...  (9:12pm). The bath was lovely-it was so hot it was steaming-just what I needed to take to out all the aches-I'm not so stiff now. In my diary, there was this one entry when I said I nearly cut myself :"I took the knife and walked into the middle of the room. I gently stroked it across the palm of my left hand. It felt sharp and jaggedy. Then I realised what I was doing and dropped the knife I had even made a mark. Night diary." Fuck fuck fuck fuck. I really should burn it. All my ideas came from there-to just experience pain and revel in it. Don't scream-increase the pain as much as you can and it will neutralise everything. Somehow it made sense at the time-because I was going crazy-I was having panic attacks over the phone and I was looking into prophecies to see if anything had anything to do with me. I wanted to be special so badly, I didn't help my friend when she was in need, and I almost lost her.  There's a double rainbow! Just thought I should say. I can't revise physics. Everytime I as much as look at a book I get a headache, and so I give up. Here's to a B grade...

      This is quick as I'm supposed to go to bed very soon. The walks tomorrow and I'm...excited and nervous. People are telling me I should prepare but I can walk for two hours...my Dad didn't know anything apart from that it was a walk and it was for charity. Now he's driving me down-to meet my internet friend, Alice. She's genuine, we got out loads but its really weird cos we met on GYUK...but no, everything should be OK. I am 16, he can't truly tell me what to do, but I should trust him more...  Today was hard. I was really happy in the morning despite my brother waking me at 5am because he was drunk and he had lost his keys. I slept till 10am and listened to Portishead-they're fantastic-I find they are all these songs I've heard snippets of in programmes but you never know who they actually are... The day went down afterwards. I was trying to revise why all the Germans fell for Hitler in the 1930s (= extreme solutions for extreme situations...the way things are going, this sort of thing could happen in Britain in a few years...) and I felt so, deflated. Depressed. I was listening to Evanescence (mistake) and I just wanted to cry and cut, but today it was a 'no more tears' day because I can't just cry all the freaking time, I gotta be strong sometimes. So I ached to reach for my scissor god instead. I solved that easily, and just forced myself to work and keep still. Eventually Dad saved me and we did DIY for my Aunty Bev...  I was worried because my Mum came over yesterday. I do love her, but its not the same way of a mother-daughter relationship: we never fight, but we never have any really really special moments either. I can't see myself knowing her after I leave home. I don't know what to do with a stale relationship. I barely know her and her me. I should be sad, but she's not really a mum-never was. She's mother, but I don't call her that.  Unfortunately, that doesn't stop her having mother's intuition. She looked into my eyes and she could tell I was struggling, because I felt so cold inside (still do-kinda stale). She asked if I was Ok, and of course I lied with a medium-sized smile on my ugly face. Just because I'm on the verge of collapse, madness, fucked-up-ness or whatever it is, doesn't mean I've lost the ability to act. I do what I have to and cry when no one is looking.   I haven't lost this battle yet. Not by a long shot. I still haven't cut and I don't plan to. I have a charity walk. I have exams. I have to come out to my family. I have to live my life and become everything I've dreamed of. Cutting, is not a part of it. Just gotta stay positive...somehow.  Later! Any Walk Of Life ppl-I'll see you inthe National Theatre!

      I haven't posted for a few days, but I've had six exams this week and I'm exhausted. Plus, I've got to rest and limber up for Sunday. I'm taking part in the Walk For Life charity stroll. I've raised Â£51 so far, which is pretty good, considering this is my first ever charity thing. Yesterday, after the last exam of the week (pretty uneventful, but I think I'm going to get an A* for Business Studies). Afterwards I kicked myself into action, refusing to go home and sleep and pestering all the teachers. The most I got was Â£6.40(Â£5 add giftaid) but I just annoyed them. Unfortunately, I don't remember all of their faces, but I will...Dad's happy with it and he's pledging Â£15, gonna get m brother, my two neighbours...then I'll be meeting up Alice and her friends and we'll be on our way...is anyone else doing it? If so, good luck on the day and congratulations! I heard Liberty X is performing, I wonder if thats true...  Right now my Dad is on the phone to Aunty Babs-her daughter died on the 16th-she was only 25 and Denise died of terminal breast cancer. It's so sad, but I'm scared I'll have to face her. I have no idea how to act...its scary how things just go out of control(not because I knew her-is that selfish?).   A few days before I sent one my two best guy mates, Ashley a long letter telling him about my breakdown and that I needed him. He's a slow reader, but he started reading a bit of it last night, and hes being really great. Better than I thought, because he doesn't really speak to me lately, and we've been too quiet together (we're both Geminis). I've been talking to other best guy mate, Nik. He's fantastic. He really is. He's genuine and funny and caring and sincere and interesting, and a normal guy which doesn't make the whole internet situation something to just shout about. You see, I've never seen him: we met on stories.com (now  urlLink www.writing.com ) and everything progressed from there. We had a nightmarish, brief attempt at being boyfriend and girlfriend. We're almost made for each other, but definitely not like that! I used to call him, but hes not the best speaker so we use msn, but mines not working so we have to rely on email. He's still convinced that Enlgand have a chance at winning the Euro Cup(?) and predictably treats Rooney in high esteem cos of his two goals.... he's cool.   I feel nervous. Why? Because Ihaven't told Dad that the charity treats people with HIV/AIDS and that the walk is in Central London. He used to think AIDs was a gay disease and I don't know if hes changed his mind.  Aussi,   he doesn't like me going into Central London-he has a sexist view of women with maps...I'm going whether he likes he or not. This is something I have to do-its probably one of the most selfless things I've ever done-after all, there's no such as a completely selfless deed.   Finally, I might be on the 'bill' for the Pink Parade. There's an event in Cambridge on the 28th August where young gay people will be performing poetry, songs, scripts etc, to prove how fabulous we are! It'll be the first time - ever! - that I will be performing any works of mine in public. So I'll definitely keep you posted with that...I found a site for it:  So thats a date.  Write up, later. And please, please, please times a million, if you are reading this, comment! I feel like I'm on a virtual reality island...   urlLink www.walkforlife.com  -that is the Walk For Life site-I can't get my hyperlink to behave.   urlLink www.pinkpicnic.co.uk   That is the link for the pink picnic, but I can't get that to behave either...I like to work though...sometimes.

      The day is colder than usual, but the sky is glittering. If you find a patch of blue sky with bits of cloud, revel in it and stare so hard your eyeballs start to ache. Lose yourself in the true blueness of the sky and don't blink. Soon enough, you should see a glittering sky. Lots of little dots of translucent light speeding round like angel children and miny fairy eggspawn. Hmm, I like that description. Its a load of mini ghosts moving around. They are the ones that give you the shivers...  Me-happy? Yeah, I was disbelieving too till thursday night. I had lost total beliefs in happy endings at the age of 16. I couldn't hold a true smile anymore, so I texted Nik. I've known him since I was 12, on the internet-one time I trusted him with my life, but we lost touch. We're talking again now, and I hope to get back to what we once had. What he said wasn't so remarkable(don't take things seriously, and know that life is good) its just that someone was listening to me for once and I appreciated so much I couldn't help but smile. People tend to compliment me for my smile. They say its brightens people's days, and I blanch with such a sought-after compliment.   I had a horoscope of my year, saying that I will find a guy who will over broken glass to make me happy. Maybe its been him, all this time. To tell you the truth, despite all the arguments we have, he's never wanted anything more than to make me happy, and I should know it better.  Hold on, I'm trying to find my dust...if you stare at darkness long enough, you could forget that there's little squares of light rushing around you trying to make you happy...

      Try doing a biology exam in a room where its 28 degrees celsius. Then find that next door, although its as if its inside your own brain, theres a building site indulging in some drillin'. Then, you find you might need a claculator (you find it later you don't) and all you can think about is a whole big load of nothing...just trying, so hard to keep your blank, to concentrate. i feel like going asleep right now, if I didn't have anything to say. If y'all didn't know, I'm 16 at last...I am an adult(sort of), i have liberty(mostly) and at least legally I can say no, and legally I can go 'Yes, yes, oh, god YEEES!!'-you get my drift.   I've discovered a new love, one of those geeky things. Its not a bad thing, its just that I'm so passionate about it when as a british teen I shouldn't be. I love gardening! Not just the easy bit-barbecueing, mowing lawns choosing plants. No! I love the hard, tough dirty bits-digging up weeds, breaking up firewood to burn the weeds, dashing to get a hose when the fire keeps catching onto the grass. That sort of fun-I love it. Its probably one of the last bonding things me and Dad are going to do together. Elliott's not a gardening guy-last time he did gardening he managed to drop a sledgehammer on his foot...  Birthday presents: Â£100, Â£20, Scissor Sisters album :) and...shorts. i should be grateful-nuff said. I'm off to read some Harry Potter slash, I can't get enough of it, lol...

      Last night, I fell apart. Completely and utterly. I broke and everything became twisted. For some reason if I didn't talk to someone I trusted I would fly out of the door and never come back. I'd die, without some flashback and remember how stupid I'm being.   I called my two best friends, but of course they weren't there-sounding horribly calm(despite the fact I was curled up on my bed, crying my eyes out), I called a half-friend-an acquaintance. Charlotte.  The phone rang, and I was at the point of hysteria-I could barely see, I just felt as if everything was coming to crush at last and maybe I'd die this time. When charlotte came onto the phone, her usual chipper self, I thought for a nanosecond I was going to let everything fly and chat and laugh like I usually do. But I just couldn't. I told her I was falling apart and I just sobbed like lost, suicidal helpless little girl, ignoring her, as the pain and the sorrow and the worthlessness just ripped through me. I couldn't scream-I'm in a house, I'm in a city, I'm alive-so I just sobbed instead of breathed, and I let her listen. Even though it was only for a few seconds, I had never let myself lose control like that before in my entire life. It was breathtaking-literally.  I let her soothe me slightly, and I ended up telling her everything, no remorse no afterthought-I mighyt have even told my Dad-if he was listening on the other side. I don't trust him either-its so much easier to act near him, cos he makes me happy-even when I'm at the brink of tears.  I told her about the cutting and the suicidal feelings and the dark empty hopeless place I had checked into without meaning to. I just spilt my tears, my anger my fears and my hysterics down the phone, and she listened faithfull just as any person would. -any decent person I could grow to trust, I hope. I've just given her my soul for a couple of minutes.  I let her talk, because I just couldn't think of anything else to say. She said how everyone in school liked me and no one hated me (?!?!?!???!???!???!?!?!??!???!????)  and that she had no idea (of ocurse, I know how to lie, I'm one of the best fucking actresses you never knew). She said people would be devasted if i left(this world) and that they would not simply get over me in a few months as I had so accurately suggested. They said they would blame themselves. I almost started sobbing again from the pain and the humuliation and the self hate of it. And then, I felt OK again. Not so broken, but shattered. It was as if I was starting over.  I hung up with Charlotte and my first instinct was to snog the walls, which i did. My room is tiny and prone to fits of claustrophobia, so it felt nice to like my room again. I felt real. And now the fallout begins, and everything will fuck up again. And i can't handle it as I did before. For that I'm glad it means I'm never cutting again. I'm serious, I won't keep up these balancing scales of self-harm: making myself throw up and then cutting to balance it out...cutting myself then overeating to dull the pain, then cutting to  cut out  the shame and making myself throw up and I can't keep doing this to myself...how would I ever find love. Please comment.  Edit 18/06/04: (apart from the above) here is the story I read before I broke down:  urlLink   Afer you've finished crying, review her work and read the rest of her stuff. She rocks.

      I was GYUK, as I was beginning in Little Liar Lost...there was a discussion about why lesbians have such bad self-image issues...so I chipped in. And I was stereotypically (liar) openly miserable. But Betty doesn't get miserable in public. Was that conventional or not?  Anyhoo, this was my answer:   Well, I'm miserable right now, so you can either ignore, or not. It's a big, massive, thing-for want of a better word. So, lesbians and gay men and transgendered people are all a little fucked, usually more than more most people, because this all adds to the 'who are we?' debate. The most ignorant people are the happiest, but lesbians look into ourselves more, as the idea that romantic love, or lust might not be found in whoever we expect to be, will shake the foundations of our beings. So we have to figure ourselves out, and fast before we totally disappear.  So of course, its never finished. And you tend to find that when you figure out who you really are, its not something you want to see. Its not what you expect, in the least.  So what do we do? I dunno. I guess we're gonna have to bond together and be our own idols. The lesbian culture is only just starting to figure out itself, and we're softer than clay, meaning the media have a hoot moulding and destroying us. Instead of just looking up to lesbians, for now, why don't we look up to people who have faced adversity? We may have few and far between lesbian role models, but we have role models. And in-between that time, we can become our own role models for the next batch of confused, self-hating lesbians.     What do you think? Not that I care (such a conventional answer)...

      I'm so lost I can't stand it. I don't whether its because I'm hungry, or whether that I've just read some of the saddest reading in my life, or just that I can't stop thinking of cutting and nothing can make it go away. Or is it the fact that I'm so self-absorbed, no one is reading this! So effectively I'm disappearing. Cool. Actually, heres something I posted on GYUK. It was weird-my brother just walked in and every muscle tenses. I've never been so untrusting of a family member, a friend or just anyone in my entire life. But I guess I'm so guarded especialy when I have been crying, in a rage, or just so trapped, anyone who breaks in doesn't deserve to be trusted. Funny, actually. I learnt yesterday the most cruel paradox. To lied effectively, you have to be trustworthy.  To be trustworthy, you had to be the least bit conventional. And to lie and know you definitely won't be getting caught, you play a character, in convention. Never use an unconventional action to lie with, because you're out of character, and you will be caught. Simple as that. I feel a whole lot better. The urge to type can be almost as strong as the urge to write, and keep writing.

      Not really. But I am worried. I almost had a fantastic day yesterday, hanging out with this girl called Alice around Central London-I have to make up a million lies, but its always worth it. And then, as I was at one of the acton stops, waiting for a train that would take me to Ealing Broadway instead of Heathrow, the train came. I was mesmerized, fully by the tracks. I imagined myself falling and letting the small train wheels crush me, and I began to lean in. I caught myself just in time, but now I can't stop thinking about it.   I've gone to the dark place, and I don't know how long I might be staying here this time. I just feel completely lost. Totally alone. Like its all my fault. I'm just the fun, intelligne,t inquisitive fun lesbian at school. I thought I'd miss it but then I looked back and realised i didn't really know anyone. That after all this time, I was still utterly alone. And I didn't mind. But I don'y like dying. I'm just a coward like most people. But now I can't concentrate and I can't stop crying. There's too much at stake for me to fall apart now. I'm in the middle of my GCSEs. The last time I nearly fell apart I almost failed, all on my part.  I'm actually 16 on Saturday...and I want to be happy that day. Almost content with the amount of revision, or least the goings over in my head. I don't want to worry about falling apart and destroying my life in such a cliched way.  To anyone who has never been here before, welcome, people, to the Dark Place. I don't know how long I'm staying.

      There never was and never will be, Don't you know that you can't see me, Suddenly you're everybody's fool  Evanescence-Everybody's Fool (morphed by me)  Its been a brilliant day. Too brilliant. The moment I stepped off the train to the bus to the chippie at the end of a gorgeous, fun, trusting day, I felt Deserving (cutting). I haven't cut for while, not since when I pretty much attacked myself. Routine. I kind of just got lost. On the bus, I could the feel the worry fill into me. I now realise it was panic...  That was saturday, around 9:30 pm. Despite calming down, I cut anyway. I think it was routine.   Tomorrow I'm coming out. I haven't got time to write a big analysis on it, so just-wish me luck and wait for the next installment.....

      My life feels...different.   I can't tell how, or why or exactly when it happened, but I have been injected with a large dose of 'fearlessness'. I'm a massive fan of the Fearless series by Francine Pascal. Yes, she's the person who wrote the Sweet Valley High books. I will never forgive her for that. But, I think for all the sickly sickness its turned into delightful dysfunction with her Fearless books. I'm on number 18 when everything changes-would it surprise you if I told you that I've been searching all over Ealing for this book like a month...it shouldn't.&nbsp;I am a total book freak. I have little orgasms over finding the old book that has been revered and recommended, like when I found Martyn Pig after searching for it for three years...or was it two? Ever since it came out anyway.   Anyway there's a description when Gaia is face to face with some menace or thug or something and she says she feels a buzzing sound, where fear is supposed&nbsp;to be and there's adrenaline instead. I think thats where I&nbsp;am at the moment.   Last night I was so ready to come out to my brother. It&nbsp;really was one of those long nights when time is stretching out like a&nbsp;lazy cat (I wrote a poem about it. I have&nbsp;like 8 poems to write up now..) and I really needed to talk to someone because I was going mad and...I'll write up what I wrote later.  Also, I'm entering a BBC competition-its this thing in Edinburgh so I doubt I'll win, but its nice to write simple short stories. I actually wrote two (well, 1&nbsp;and three quarters.). But&nbsp;you know what I hate about story competitions? Word limits. It just restricts the creativity. I understand if they don't want overlong stupid epic pieces, but 500 words?! More like 600, or eccentric&nbsp;numbers&nbsp;like 628.7, cause writing is eccentric, good stories have good styles, eccentricity.&nbsp;Or&nbsp;just out and out madness-its all good. Anyways, if I don't win, I'll post the story and get you're opinions. I gotta go to Childrens Express-later!&nbsp;

      I'm not suicidal. I'm not some whiny kid in her oh-so-terrible london house and pretty car with her room, TV and stereo, and broadband. This person has lived through so much crap-sure, her parents broke up when she couldn't remember, but her Daddy gave her every thing he could and more. She has her job, friends who love her and she was almost popular in high school, but she managed to live all through that with her broken heart, and those god-damn pretty scars. She will prevail. She will not fall. She will not die by her own hands, or feet, or Salesmen. She'll realise what her destiny when she dies.

      Turns out I didn't explain myself about Salesmen. The&nbsp;night when I thought I had truly defeated 'SG' (scissor god) I had realised who were telling me how disgusting I was and that cutting was the only way out. Its those horrid evil voices in your head, turned bitter by worry and regret. Those voices tell you to doubt your soulmate, they cut off your chances, they stop you speaking out and getting the girl. So I call them Salesmen, because they're convincing me to do something I don't need nor want to do. Salesmen only care that you do what they say, using all sorts of their marketing skills-these Salesmen are dangerous because these voices are part of you. There's no point in viewing it as a dot on the horizon. They are part, or all of the evil within us, and its all about seeing through their schemes-its easier to imagine your Salesman as Mr Anderson from The Matrix. Its always so much better to view your enemy, then they're not some mysterious being that swoops upon like a gale. It makes everything so straightforward and rigid in its movements and actions and methods.   So, Mr Anderson beat me, a couple of days ago, and now I'm having a worrying obsession with trains. I've been travelling a lot lately-to Childrens Express  urlLink http://www.childrens-express.org.uk , or just around...and I've been on my own after a long hard, or dreading it. I end up standing just short of the edge of the floor, just short of the actual tracks, and I wonder if I'd die if I jumped. Its horrible, thinking like that. &nbsp;  I watch the metal tracks as if I'm on them, as if I'm about to jump and I keep thinking about what happens till the train pulls into the station and I feel the slipstream. Its a bit of the rush, like cutting-it (cutting) doesn't feel good, but now I'm doing it out of habit, to LIVE. Not to just get through the day, but to just function.    I did a little test to see how depressed I was. Here was the result:    Goldberg's  depression  test:    You have reached level  69  on the Goldberg scale.  0 - 9  Depression unlikely  21 - 35  Minor to moderate depression  10 - 17  Possibly minor depression  36 - 53  Moderate to severe depression  18 - 21  On the verge of depression  54+  Severe depression You are having suicidal thoughts. This is a serious warning sign, and you must seek help quickly.You have the symptoms of severe depression. The condition seems to cause serious problems in your everyday life, and you should consult your doctor immediately.Depression is a disease like any other disease, and it can be treated very effectively. Recognising that you are suffering from depression is the first positive step. If you are depressed, you should arrange to see your doctor to talk about the illness right away. You may also want to raise the issue with your friends and family. You should look for support from these people you until you get well. Anyone can suffer from depression, and the symptoms can vary from person to person. Treatments, including medication and psychotherapy, have a very high success rate.Please note that this test result is not a certain assessment of your mental health. You should always consult a doctor if you feel depressed or if you feel that worries and anxiety have taken over and affected the activities of your daily life.        So, there you have it. I'm quite fucked up. I didn't realise I was as bad as I was. I also did a Self Image Test, and it says I have Body Dysmorphic Disorder (body hate). So, contrary to what my therapist thinks-I don't cut because my mum left me, I cut because I'm disgusting and I hate myself. Don't know why I'm complaining-I've got the rest of my summer planned. I'm working from Monday to Wednesday, I'm at Oxfam on Thurs and Sundays, and on Fridays I'm at Children's Express writing, so I only have Saturdays free till September. I'm apprehensive...tired...thats all for now.

      Its a bit late and I can't speak for long right now, so here is what happened today:   Today was a double whammy. I had an interview for my first job and I was doing my other job at Oxfam since the Sunday disaster. Firstly, I thought this day would just go badly: I managed to mess up my perfect top and had to change 20 mins before I got there, and I then found out I applied for a totally different job I thought I'd get. I thought I was applying for a job in a hairdressers, but it turned I posted my CV next door and I had applied to a totally different company. So, shaken and shook (I thought I had been pranked) I went to another interview totally nonplussed. But...... I GOT THE JOB!!!!  Woo-hoo, I was.   The job sounds manic (tough/mad) though. I have to talk on the phone a lot (I'm nervous about talking to strangers on the phone, despite being a Gemini) and make all these appointments. They tried to show me what to do and it just made my brain hurt. That might have been because I stayed up till 2am listening to Alex Parks wondering why I attacked myself (more later). I'm being paid...Â£4 a hour and now my life will be so busy, because I have two jobs and Children's Express and I'm going to have to juggle everything. At least my typing is better. I like being busy-it means I lose weight. I have proof for this. I have to keep holding up my size 20 trousers: they keep sliding down my arse, which means shopping! and more good news.   Oxfam was cool. I worked with this new guy two years younger than Dad all afternoon and hardly anything went wrong, I even managed to tame the bloody credit card machine. When I got the call that I had actually got the job, I did a little whoop and decided to spend almost all of the rest of my birthday money. I bought three albums from Oxfam (Texas: White on Blonde, MJ Cole: Sincere, Lene Marlin: Playing my Game), then I went to Waterstones and  finallly  bought this book I've wanted for about two months now (Liam Hearn: Across The Nightingale Floor). I re did my library book (Sarah Waters: Tipping the Velvet-HIGHLY recommended.). I'm re-reading my favourite slash story (Underwater Light by Maya), I got my freebies from Xfm but I have to phone the post office first. I look alright, I'm doing loads more stuff with Childrens Express and I've made some friends there (James, Fikir and Samir). I'm working towards work experience in media and for the next five weeks till COLLEGE starts, I'll be busy everyday except Saturdays. Also, I've written about 15 decent (some more than decent) poems in the last two/three days. I am, truly, on a roll.   This is the best summer ever.   If only I could stop cutting.   If only I could stop being afraid.  If&nbsp;only, if only I&nbsp;could just let go and stop crying. And get rid of my Salesman (I did explain that, didn't I?)  I dunno, its just like two(?) days ago, I was OK. I didn't have a reason to cut, things were going my way for once and everything didn't just seem so hopeless and horrid. Yet that night I cut myself six times. And I managed to punch myself, slap myself, and cry my eyes out. My cutting has sunk to a whole new level (not low, its not really a  bitch, really truly.)  I remember it now in confusion: it was kinda like a drug and I didn't have to be all theatrical about it anymore, I could just do it to go in-between days. At first I did it because I didn't want to kill myself. Then I wanted to kill myself cutting and had a breakdown over that (cos of the irony?) and now I don't know what to do. It doesn't calm me (as much), it puts me in pain now cause I'm cutting shallower than usual, its nearing the bloody vein, and the amount of cuts are mounting ferociously.   And of course, since my life is always a little fucked somewhere, here's the proof: Ria and Nik, my best friends, the only people who are able to take away the scissors from my hands, are going away on holiday. Nik's already gone and has pissed off for two weeks. Ria is leaving on Saturday, and on her arrival a week from then will be the endgame of lying to Dad (coming out-shudder). I'd tell her about my recent cutting, but I don't want to worry her, and have her worrying about me the whole of her holiday. Its just not fair on her.   And now my eyes are hurting and I have another busy day ahead of me. You know the feeling ypu have when you keep staring at someone and your eyes start to ache and water? Well, I'm having that feeling and I'm blinking....not good.   Also 24 ended...nonononononononnononononononono! Jack is going to the dark side I can see it...everyone is leaving...the President is gone, Sherry is 'dead' (I refuse to believe that until the next series start, next fucking year)...its just not right...how the hell will the next series carry out? Its just blasphemy, y'know? Ohh, sorry for cutting, for anyone who cares outthere. I can't help being pathetically illogical... x  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      -I just like the word, its seductive... Anyhoo, I haven't written in a couple of days, I think. I'm really tired. At last, days of staying up till 3 in the morning has taken its toll. I can't help it, it just seems to be the time I'm most creative/stubborn. Oxfam was cool. The moment the guy I was working with left I messed up the machine and it took me forever to fix it, which left me tense all day. Aargh-my horoscope warned me last night and I decided to just not listen to it, and I tend to read it every day, just to be prepared, safe in thought that people choose this as their cradle of safety, and I lull myself into a false sense of security. The guy I worked with was interesting-he's introduced me to so many different artists. i heard of Roots Manuva, but I was watching out for MC (Tony?) Rotten. I had heard of The Roots, but I didn't know they were so good. Same goes for MC Solaar-if anybody got any translations of his songs-please, please, please send me a link.  The day before I hanged with Ria, Little Meg, and others: people who used to be my 'friends' but we weren't bothered to pretend any more. Everyone kept showing off on their guitars and Ria was a little frosty to Ciara at times, but apart from that, nothing much. I stayed till quarter to 1am cos I just didn't want to leave her side. I'll write more later, because I'm reading something else (Harry Potter Slash-what else?!), so watch out for the update. Oh, and this site might interest you. He's a great black political writer, and this site says it has some of poems but I haven't looked thorugh it yet:  urlLink http://www.gilscottheron.com/ &nbsp;. Enjoy!

      Yesterday I was working at Oxfam again. We met some cool people: a really shy guy who gabbled a bit about some vinyl records he wanted and disappeared, a man who asked for 'Blue Movies' (I still can't believe he actually asked me!),&nbsp; a postman who kissed the shop window cause he thought Jess was fit (which she is) and a load of mistakes by us throughout the day (I still can't use the credit card machine properly, lol) and a BBC journalist who wanted to mention us on the BBC london show. They're doing this thing about the little gems in the city, Oxfam Music shop included. Tom (the manager), rattled on about the shop. Apparentely its the only 'music' shop in London, because the others sell books and other non-music things, they were talking about the roadshow (they're coming down to Ealing Broadway on the weekend of the 28th August-just after my GCSE results, I've noticed-less than six weeks away!). It's great to be part of a brand of people who actually enjoy their job. &nbsp; Cutting...has gotten easier(to resist). I was talking to a great friend of mine who didn't understand depression because he's quite a happy. I described it as something that chooses you, and you can't control it, you can only cope with it... &nbsp; Their reply was simple, but like a lot of the things they say, it kinda stuck. They said that I described it was something that controlled me,  but that didn't make sense because depression doesn't control me, I control myself.  And that stayed with me, because it made this monster in my mind I used to battle with everynight look like some fake kid in a dress. That I had no need to be scared. Cheers, mate. &nbsp; Today is an off day. Tomorrow I'm going to a birthday party, then on Sunday I have my Oxfam job. Then on Tuesday is the HIV conference, Wednesday I'll probably spend writing up, and Thursday is another interview/job combo. Friday or Saturday I'm going out, then I've got my Oxfam job on Sunday...I love being busy, otherwise I'd just go stir-crazy and bitchy crazy. And I've got these horrible cramps and galaxy hazelnut (my usual medicine) isn't working-damn thing... Lets call this a happier post.  &nbsp;

      I can't say much now, because I have to be off somewhere, but I had a little triumph over my cutting problem. I haven't felt this happy for no reason for months and months. Later!  Okay, now its later..(8:30pm-Queer Eye in the background. Fab-u-lous show). As you can tell I'm weirdly happy. You have no idea how quietly grateful for that. I was so depressed last night. Like one those nights when everything hits you and its NOT ok. And I was so ready for this, to make this a routine so I won't have to be scared of fury pr passion or drowning ever again, my strong voice came in and told me I didn't have to do this. It was such an alien concept to me right then I had to listen to it, not dismiss as mad ramblings. I'm more distrustful of familiar things rather than new things for some reason...  And anyways I was listening to this voice, telling me that if I just put the scissors down and go to sleep, that I would be able to sleep for weeks and weeks before....I have to cut again. And this got me, because I was thinking, whats the point of going through and wasting all that strength now when I'm going to cut anyway down the line? But still part of me persisted and was winning. I was starting to see that I could do other things like slapping if I absolutely have to.  Drawing on your arms with red pen helps too, for some reason.   Then my mind flipped out and I was imagining one of my friends dying in a car crash and me killing myself over it. I've had this same dream, with so many different people, and so many, many ways of dying I knew what was going to happen but it was crippling me anyway.   The panic was rising, the scissors were very ready, and then I just started to see myself differently. As one person. One person who will want to hurt me, and will use anything to do just that. The dream was an illusion to bring everything on top of me. I wanted to cut to make everything go away. But I realised I didn't have to cut, and all I would have needed to do is sleep. To write, draw on myself, hide the fucking scissors, and sleep. And I smiled, and I looked at this pathetic, gun metal-coloured little thing I had the madness to call my 'Scissor God' and I laughed it. I actually smiled at it, and put it away as if I was putting away some old photos of me with kinky hair and a red nose that I believed would ruin my life for ever. And I saved myself for once. For one night, I was my superman (well, WO-man) and I'm really proud of myself. I've finally done something that matters a little.   Obviously, this isn't all over yet, but I'm definitely getting somewhere. Hope I didn't bore you with my thoughts!

      I've gone down a dress size!! I am now an (almost) acceptable size 18. I tried on a pair of jeans, they fit fine and my arse looked great! So that was my day, lol. I bumped into my friend Lisa and I went to her house. On Tuesday it was (feels like a month ago), I was at her house when I told her I was going to come out to my Dad in August. She gave me a bit of a going over: "Are you absolutely sure?" "You know, this is your last chance.." Which did make me think, along with her ideas and all. She says that I might be gay because:  I only hang out with girls (not true) My dad is too strict I haven't got laid, and am behind schedule  I don't think its any of that. Its mainly because out of almost all the guys I've fancied, bar two I chose to fancy them. Does this make sense? No? Ok, let me explain:  * You can make yourself fancy a person, if at first you feel neutral about them * Then in my naive state, the moment, they were nice to me, I create a world * In this world, I allow myself to fancy this person. They are perfect. * I am clever (bored) enough to stay in this fantasy and the fantasy Betty fancies.  Its very surreal, and I've only just realised this today on the bus to Primark. Obviously, there are some people you can't help fancying, but the neutral, boring people, you can fancy. Its how I've managed to stay straight for so long, but you can't keep a gay gal down. So, I know, really, 100% know that I'm gay and that although comiong out is more or less 'No Way Out', I can handle it. Its me, and I'm so comfortable with me I barely consider it these days, which is strange because I only realised I was gay last September. i move way too fast for my liking. Will add later, tired, and I have to take my hair out and i want to eat ICE CREAM.

      I don't think its going to go too well. For starters, what used to be a slightly overcast day is now a mad hard-hitting storm. Also, the fact that I just can't log into hotmail-its saying: Account Closed. Access Denied.      Even more, its not giving any reason, at all. I can't access my emails, I'm expceting some as well, and I'm losing my mind. (Now Playing: Ryan Adams *Wonderwall*)Today was supposed a 'Me' day, a day to relax, write my chapter and read some of my books. It's my cousin Jason's 17th b'day today, so I'm seeing him later. I have to ask people if they would come with me tomorrow to Childrens Express-my Dad is mucho strict. And I cut myself last night. Just so I could feel something-I was still on the painkiller feeling from Sunday. It was so surreal. I just decided to let go a little, and I didn't make such a big deal of it. I mean, i was crying and i was aware that I was crying but I didn't feel sad, I felt...numb. Alone. (Now Playing: Mad Season-the single) also, I was feeling the beginnings of panic, or sadness, or something. I didn't want to register it as an actual emotion, or i would start self-examinging myself again, and I want to avoid that. It's gonna be a long summer.   I love hard pounding rain. Real rains, like the ones that come once a year in parts of Jamaica and in India. Its natural ferocity, and I think its beautiful. Its the the kind of rain I always to just get out dance in, and just all my fucked-up-ness washes itself away.   The rain has stopped now, and a bit of blue is peeking out. I shoud take more chances.  Anyway, I want to post a little poem of mine. Its Part Two of a poem I wrote called Soul-Break and I find it too personal to use anywhere else but here. Its what i think to myself whenever I want to cut. The most important parts I think are the first verse and the second little verse. I have to remember that you don't have to cut to calm yourself and get rid of the Panic.    Part Two of Soul Break    Falling apart like the Mona Lisa Is better done than said. For you have not won. You lose, in the most glorious way So as you re-amerge, Your cracks tacked together, Remember what you might  Have done instead To stop your impending breakdown. Remember that you might have bled  To try and pause a hideous; Wondrous, inevitable.  And never be afraid, to fall again In my arms.  Love me truly and give yourself fully So that I can't hurt you.  Let me give myself faithfully. Promise that you'll never break me, Hurt me.  So that when you do, I'll know that it wasn't true, That it's not real, That it was not natural.  I want to make your eyes bejewelled So kiss me. Gently And I'll give you my world To make it rightfully yours. You already own me, You silly girl.

      Remember them? Well, I bonded with my fellow workmates whilst Jess (unbelievably fit with very low cut top, I had to look squarely at-her-face all day) put on the best of The Troggs.   I had two big teen things today: interview with one of the colleges I might go to (Richmond)and spent two hours there, talking over my options and getting my timetable sorted. The people are so nice, and the course sound so great, but if I can't get there then there's no point...  Anyway, my main concern with college is deciding on my courses. My core three are: English Lit+Lang, History and Politics and now I'm trying to choose between Classical Civilisation, Psychology and Philosophy-I can only choose one or the other, or the other one! Damn 4 AS syllabus...  I was talking to so many teachers, taking in so much information about philosophy and all this future stuff it was giving me a real headache. But we left, with a load of papers, more confident about the future than usual.  So, I went home, slept and had some cornflakes, and went off to my new job. Oh, doesn't that sound great? When I told Mrs Lyons, she was more excited than anyone, said that I'd be more busy and I'd have some structure to my life, which would help this no-cutting business smoother. I'd like to think so too. So why, on Sunday, the night before I got the volunteering job, did I cut myself? Time will tell that I finally snapped. (there's a battle going on in my brain, and I lost that night.) Sigh, the freaky thing is, that I can't feel a fucking thing. The moment after, I felt as if I'd overdosed on painkillers or something-total calm, it was so surreal. Lyons says it means I don't feel as guilty, which is a good thing cos it breaks the cycle....what's done is done. And thats the last time I see Mrs Lyons till September.  Anyway, my job at Oxfam Music shop? I love it, I really do. Its a bit boring at times, but thats because not enough people come down and buy CDs-we have loads of great artists-Ok, total plug, but its on Ealing Broadway and the people are lovely...The best bit was that you chose the music they played in the shop. Today we had some soul compilation, Natalie Imbruglia(I must get that album...), The Best of The Troggs (they did Wild Thing, but they have lots of great songs), then it was, T'Pau(Not my choice), Glastonbury CD thingy, a folk band then The Best Of The Stranglers who I love now-Ooh, ooh and Janis Joplin-oh, she kicks arse and then some...  So, I'm doing another shift on Thursday with some guy who apparentely isn't too sociable, oh well. Things, are sort of looking up. Now, I'm going to read some slash, get my round some things and prepare for the rest of the week.

      That means I've been living free for a week and two days. I should be bloody pleased, specially after my fab chicken sandwich (paprika butter-ok, on chicken-sesame oil, cumin powder-freshly grounded and black pepper-add cheese= divine!). But I'm bored. I'm officially a hopeful teenager looking for work. Anythig half-assed will do. So far I've applied to be a junior in a hairdressers-I think it'll be quite fun, just washing hair and sweeping up all day, surrounded by people and strangers and an atmosphere-better than an office job any day, so I hope I get it.   Todays boring, lol. Yesterday was a bust. I was supposed to go to my first ever Pride! parade and then go to Childrens Express to flesh out this story I'm doing. It was going to be such a busy day and such a brilliant lie.  Firstly, Dad wouldn't let me out of the house...he said I couldn't go out until I told him the truth, and that would involve a spectacular coming out. My Dad has been annoyingly ambiguous, comparing gays and paedophiles to saying that people who rap 'Burn All the Gays(Chi Chi men)' weren't proper Christians-then again, he'd been loving another 'Burn All the Gays' song but he was ranting about this one because they called themselves Catholics. Even so, any coming out would take time, and I didn't have any, so fuming, I went upstairs and broke the news to poor Alice, who had to go on her own and had a crap time...  Then, I did nothing until Dad drove me down to Childrens Express. That, was a bust too-neither of my partners were there so in the end I had to just read some pages on HIV on the internet and research, which I could have done at home, and yes, I hated that day...every time the news mentioned the Pride festival I felt so annoyed and wistful because I wasn't outraged enough to shout at Dad. Maybe I knew he just wasn't worth it. I even made a poster- it had 'THE UNITED QUEENDOM' and on the bottom it had 'HOMOSEXUALITY: FABULOUS SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME AND ETERNITY'. I had to wake up at 8 in the morning just to get done properly.   Then last night, I had some sort of panic attack. I couldn't breathe and I felt as if I was going out of my skin, it was horrible. so I had to redress the balance, and I'm not proud of what I did, but I felt desperate and I wanted to avoid cutting. I've been without for 1month, and three days and I'm happyish about it, Ria says she's proud of me. That matters-we hanged out on Friday, and she chose some poems to use at the Pink Picnic.  Actually, the funniest thing happened on Friday. Me and Ria were doing her paper round before her mum gets home and kills her, and I was bending over to pick up some papers, when some old lady came up to me. She said 'Oh, hello darling. Just to say you better avoid bending over like that, you see' I thought she was going to then say something about backache but she then said 'you see, when you bend over like, its almost too tempting to (cue spanking motion)." Imagine my shock at a 84 year old woman hitting on me. Ria didn't realise and was worried about the perfect 'O' on my face until I told, and we had to hold our hysterics till she went round the corner. I'm never ever, bending over again, lest I get spanked by some randy old woman.
