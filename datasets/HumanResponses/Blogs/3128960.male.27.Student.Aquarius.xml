       Inspired by my brethren Jeff Barrett and Brendan Kredell, I've decided to add more (potentially) useless information to the glut that is the Internet and indulge my narcissistic penchant for passive garrulousness.   Grace them:  urlLink Brendan   urlLink Jeff    If you are perceptive you will notice that I shamelessly chose the same Blog template that Brendan did. Good catch. I happen to both support and practice internet appropriation.

       As it turns out, this blogging thing seems to just be a replacement for email. So this next post is addressed to my arch-nemesis.   I meant what I said. Paul Revere. At that point, your treacherously "tratorial" nature had already been remarked upon. Hence, no need to reiterate; redundancy is a time waster. The ascription of "Paully" was meant to disparage your apparent shouting that, not the British, but the Bloggers are coming. What I meant by this has since been nullified after talking to Brendan. Apparently he found Misreadings all on his very own. Yet, based on his  urlLink article  of last night where he identified you as my arch-nemesis, I assumed you had got on the horn and started yelling "Have you seen Winner's blog? Have you seen that it completely bites your own in both style and content?" (cf. the "in consultation" sentiment of aforementioned Terrain Cognita posting). Obviously, this misreading can only serve as an index of my own shame at being lazy and biting another's style. Perhaps a battle only to be fully reconciled on the 6x6--cardboard confrontation, my man--rock it steady.   As it turns out, you did no such thing. I suppose these types of misunderstandings take place when one is in involved in gangland warfare. Yet the question remains, how did Brendan intuit our rivalrous stance toward one another? Red vs. Blue? Burnt Sienna vs. Aqua Marine? Has word spread so fast along the UofC pipeline? Paranoia is compounding daily.

       I think I read somewhere that Martin Luther had a revelatory experience while letting loose the brown torpedo. Yesterday I had a similar experience; it was, unfortunately, much less inspired by the divine. Rather than a direct communique from the Almighty, my pre-articulated insight was conveyed via The Economist Technology Quarterly (March 13th, 04, p. 18). Further, it did nothing to strengthen my faith. If anything, it did quite the opposite.   Previous to doing my "duty" yesterday night, I had high hopes for my blogging enterprise. To the question, "Will blogging--the practice of maintaining an online diary, or weblog--revolutionize journalism?", I would have answered with a resounding "IT SHALL." To the inquiry, "Do the world's bloggers really constitute a 'second superpower', the only force on earth capable of keeping America's neo-imperialist government in check?", I would have resounded "Friends, Comrades, step with me onto this new Shining Path, for it is We who shall prevail!"   Well, apparently, the question we should all really be asking is: "Or is the blogging craze just an example of sound and fury signifying nothing--a re-run of the late 1990's fad for personal websites, only with easier to use publishing software?" Apparently it is. Why? Simply put, "while bloggers--half of whom are teenagers--are convinced they are changing the world, not everyone agrees. There are even some people beyond the insular world of the "blogosphere" who have not ever heard of blogging at all." All is for naught it seems.  Yet one must wonder...Is it mere coincidence that this article made its way into my hands a mere 3 days after my initial foray into  blogging? If I hadn't read somewhere that Martin Luther took divine dooks I would be inclined to say yes. But, as the Pot seems to be the Purveyor of the Divine Truth, now I am not so sure. According to Gee-Dubbya, everyone has a god-given penchant for neo-imperialism. Therefore, all blogging that attempts to thwart this effort is uncharitable, and, let's face it, straight up sinnin'. Perhaps I have simply been set on the true path--a path that shines not with revolutionary fervor but with the grace of the Almighty who calls for a free world and a safe America.   So i reiterate, in the the end, all our rants and raves, our sound and our fury, signify and accomplish nothing. But this is ok, it is as it should be. The revolution is not forthcoming, because it has been, is, and will be televised. So just sit back and watch. Then write some vacuous, pubescent thoughts for no reason. If I didn't convince you, go do(x2) your duty as an American and discover the revelation that awaits you. One tip...make sure the toilet paper isn't all used up. Thanks Arik.  More on my growing distaste for empty revolutionary rhetoric, blogs or otherwise, later...

       Choice Choons o' the day: the lads from Shiloh have graced us with a new eclectic  urlLink mix . Aside from a wack intro (sorry guys), it is pretty locked in. The track at 20 mins or so is fucking tight. Has a little delayed guitar lick reminiscent of the days when Cass n Slide didn't suck. oh sweet nostalgia.   Apparently, I have a new arch-nemesis. I know what you are thinking...is it  urlLink Swarm ? Thankfully, no. For I lack the power, stamina, and wit to thwart such a foe. If you do not empathize with my fear, simply  urlLink listen  to his battle cry and i assure you---you will tremble. (Also, it would behoove you to  urlLink listen  to Kraven as well, apparently someone taped him "introducing" himself to some chick he just banged in the park. And, seriously, how creepy is fucking  urlLink Arachnoid ?! (interrobang, bitch...what.))  According to reliable  urlLink sources  my foe is none other than Denise Bracken. You got it. The new jack. All because I got Ice-T's back. Now she is a turncoat and conspiring with others to turn them against me.   Apparently Denise isn't aware of the high-school fight song I penned:  Sport the war, war support The sport is war, total war When victory's a massacre The final swing is not a drill It's how many people I can kill  Much to my chagrin, the faculty did not choose this fight song...something about legal issues and legions of die-hard heshers (who are no doubt sporting  urlLink these  fine specimens).    Nevertheless, let this vain admission of attempted high-school spirit stand as a warning to aforementioned nemesis. My evil has no boundaries, my arteries are hardened, I stalk from behind the crooked cross, a spirit cloaked in black...and you, my dear, are an expendable youth.   Now, if you will excuse me I must go attempt, and fail, to blow my head off with a  urlLink shotgun .   \m/ IO IO IAO IO  urlLink PAN  \m/

       (Read  urlLink Bingo  first if you haven't already.)  Naturally, I wanted to see if my epiphany was unique. It wasn't. Not completely. An alltheweb  urlLink search  turned up a variety uses for the term "blingo". For instance:   According to the "help-a-teacher"  urlLink web site , Blingo is a computerized and slightly modified Bingo. The "twist" is that instead of getting numbers called out, your teacher calls out alternate forms of numbers, i.e. fraction and decimal equivalents. This is not a cool game. It's a math game. It's not gangsta. Little Timmy excelling at fraction conversion does no justice to my epiphany.   Alternatively, I thought an  urlLink UrbanDictionary search  might prove more fruitful. Again, no dice; but there are some definitions worth noting.   One Alan Lowney explains the term as a combination of "Bling" and "Lingo." So "Blingo" refers to "phat, wicked, or 'street-credible'" speech. Renaming Bingo to Blingo would undoubtedly grant it street-cred, but I'm not sure I would use the term as anything but the proper name of a game. If, for example, some kid came up to me and used the term as Lowney suggests, saying something like "That sounds hype yo, he got alllll dat blingo" (Lowney's own example), I would be forced to drop kick his ass with the  urlLink Quickness .   Dee-Devil suggests that "Blingo" actually refers to a person who is "a combination between a gringo and a pimp, that in this case would be a 'bling-blinger.'" Dee-Devil's example of using this term in a conversation is as follows, "Dat blingo sold me his best bitch fo a bag of twinkes." Now, I hope that your initial reaction to Dee-Devil's definition of Blingo was one of utter contemptuousness. Mine was. And I was happy to discover I wasn't alone. The follow-up definition of "Blingo," courtesy of  Virus, is as follows:  "Dee-Devil, you make it obvious that u are one of the whitest white boys ever. If I knew where you lived, I would slap you silly. You are a lifeless dickhead."  I must admit, I would gladly mount up with Virus in order to regulate.   The point of all this is simple--"Blingo" is best reserved for lacing Bingo with a bit of street-cred. I mean really, if you won a pot of, say, 20$ and bought your girl a few bags of Twinkies, how tight would it be to say "It's cool Sherry, you don't have to get me back. It's a gift. No, no, pretty pretty, don't thank me...thank BLINGO."   For your entertainment, I present to you the rest of Dee-Devil's urban slang, quoted in full to preserve spelling and grammar:   urlLink Dilbert : "Anything representing utter stupidity or hate towards utter stupidity."   urlLink Pisscat : "An over terratorial woman, age 23-45 who looks and acts like a very angry cat. Ex:  My pisscat bandteacher shed on me  "  Now do you feel contempt?

       I had an epiphany today concerning everyone's favorite sanctioned game of childhood/old age betting: B-I-N-G-O.  You know the game: cardboard permutations of numbered grids; plastic chips for the young or unprofessional; ink-based blotters for the old or professional; interminably flickering fluorescent lighting; the sickly sweet stench of kool-aid or ensure; a complete lack of distinction between diastole and systole; frenetic scanning; ocular exhaustion; growing distrust for your "friends"; seething hatred for Grandma Jenkins, who just raked in bingo bank...  Basically your shit is amped and your attitude is hard. You are taking numbers and kicking ass; eliminating them left, right, up, down, and even droppin' them on the diagonal.  Just give me B-13. B-13. Bee Thirteen and that shit is mine...  Rev. Smith twirls the Bingo globe and the next chip falls into his hand. B-13. It's fucking yours.   At this point, you need to lay claim to your prize money. In the vast majority of cases, this will transpire something like this:  "Bingo!" "I have Bingo"  Say that out loud and see how lame it sounds. The phrase belies the hard-ass bingo attitude you worked so long to cultivate. Now, when the Reverend calls out B-13, what if you could lay claim as such:  "BLINGO, bitches...what? say sumthin. Jieah"  I dunno. That's it. That's the epiphany. In my view, this name change will concretize the true nature of the game--the shit is gangsta--a nature that is sadly masked in its current incarnation  And Denise Bracken said Ice-T's "Colors" was a wack track. The only thing wack is your lack of respect, new jack.

       I present to you...(wait for it)...the  urlLink Interrobang .  This printed symbol apparently conveys "an attitude, curiosity, and wonder." I think the emphasis is definitely on the first characteristic.  Also, and perhaps more tellingly, it "expresses Modern Life's Incredibility."  Are we supposed to capitalize "modern", "life", and "incredibility"!?  I have to give props to "B.M." Bozeman for pointing out this delectable bit of info.

       All of you local UofC patrons...  today, as I walked past the construction site by the Crerar (or is it Cerar?) library, i noticed that someone has been throwing up something rather peculiar on the plywood barricade that serves to keep everyone without a hardhat out of the hardhat only area.  What was this (stenciled) tag you ask?   None other than Lacan's Graph of Desire (version 1). Is this what urban warfare has come to? Can the tagger, if he is reading this, at least explain to me what the fuck the Graph of Desire attempts to illustrate? Che vuois?   Maybe Seen went back for post-doc.

       I've been told, anonymously, via the medium of the written word, that I, like Misreadings, am a bore. I was certain the bashful critic was referring to my natural knack for boring to the core of things, for unearthing the structural strictures of 'reality,' for making steady headway against the resistance offered by the hetero-phallogo-normative apparatus of productively power-laden hegemonic discourses, for pulling the rug out from under Ontology himself. "Wow," I thought, "my first fan." I even ran into the bathroom and gave myself hi-five in the mirror.    Then I got back in touch with the real world. I think the very fact that I even take the time to 'blog' is a direct indication of my propensity to (be a) bore. But thanks for reaffirming.   Speaking of something that is assuredly NOT boring, it seems the occult arts are as potent as many an adept thought. Why? Simply stated, Yngwie Malmsteen has been successfully channeled (no, he's not dead, but his career  is (and was always already) dead)into a Finnish neo-classical death-thrash outfit, aptly named the Children of Bodom. Granted, the cacophonous quintet is not new, but as I have had my head up the ass of progressive house for the past 7 years, I have missed some of the stellar non-Nu:Metal acts of the late 90's. CoB fucking rock and have reinvigorated my love of palm-muting, arpeggios, keyboard solos, and Odin.

       I ran across this review of S.O.D. - Speak English Or Die on Amazon the yesterday; it seems somewhat relevant given today's hairy entanglements both at home and abroad.    "A music fan" writes, "I remember the day 'Speak English or Die' hit the scene when I was in high school. There was a real division beginning between punkers and metal heads where I was at and part of it was because of the violence from nazi skinheads beating up metal heads for having long hair. Since regular skinheads were kind of considered punkers and hard to tell apart from nazis, alot of metal heads were getting pissed at punks in general.  Some of my better friends were head bangers and we were all bummed about the whole affair. Well, when we heard 'United Forces' come ripping from the vinyl in a vocal and chord crunching assault testifying that '...it doesn't matter how you wear your hair, it's what's inside your head...' we were stoked.  Here was this band, 2500 miles from where we were at, talking about the same problem tellin' everybody to lighten up. I listened to this album exclusively for almost a half a year, and there was a lot of killer music then. As far as I'm concerned, these guys are the god fathers of speedcore and if you don't own it, at least hear it once. These guys were a major influence on metal to come!!"   Just remember, it doesn't matter how you wear your hair when everyone is united. Godbless the Crossover. Lighten the fuck up everyone. Learn English and Beware the Milano Mosh.  Although, I must impart one rejoinder. The process of crossover, while undoubtedly for the better in the long run, will produce some abhorrent mostrosities as it unfolds. See for instance D.R.I. post-1987. I mean, the video for "Suit and Tie Guy"--c'mon guys.
