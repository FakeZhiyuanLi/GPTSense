      To All,  This is my last day in Mesiniaga after 4+ years of working in this company. It has been an interesting 4 years and it has been an educational experience for me and I've learned a lot during my 4+ years here, Thank youuu. Well, if the lot of you is thinking that this is going to be the usual signing off thingy that you get from everybody that's leaving, well...  you're right. It is the same old jabbering about nonsensical stuff which you've heard thousands of times before about people leaving. *How unimaginative*.  And also, I'm doing this just to clutter up your e-mail and let those who don't know me think, 'who the *&^%$ is this guy cluttering up my e-mail'. Also, I'm too lazy to filter the names. Since this is my last day, this is my chance to keep on rambling on without any thought about structure or point to what I'm writing and getting away with it. Hah! Probably only 30% of Mesiniagans are going to read this anyway. Unless one of you are crazy enough to do a statistics on the percentage of Mesiniagans reading this utterly boring, meaningless, rambling farewall e-mail.   Somehow the above paragraph does not seem long enough and i intend to write more stuff and fill my last day with absolute garbage and those who want to keep on reading this is probably having too much time on their hands. so, GET BACK TO WORK!!!. Those of you who know me, you know where to find me. Those who don't know me but want to get to know me, well, my question is WHY!?. So getting back to the reason I'm writing this e-mail, I would like to thank those who have helped me during my days here, friends, bosses, mentors, mentees (i.e. personal slaves), colleagues, admin, cook, personal trainer ( gaining 20kg and a one pack in the gut in 4 years time is no ordinary feat), and anybody else who feel they should be thanked.  And also i would like to apologise to all those that i have wronged, slighted, insulted, put down, hit, look down on, think that you're less than me, saying that you are beneath me, punched, kicked, bloodied, given the smackdown, etc... i hope you have it in your heart to forgive me as i will continue my quest for the ultimate prize in the realm of employment. The search for more money. Unless we live in a fantasy world where we can play games all day, laze around on the afternoon, watch the telly and getting loads of money from it. Hmmmm, i should apply the Dilbert Principle in my working life. Maybe we all should.  I feel that i need the e-mail to be longer so the it looks like i've got a lot to say and the person who opens this email will be wondering why the heck this e-mail is extremely long. Does he have anything important to say? Lets read it. And then you will be sucked into reading this long winded e-mail. The idea that someone is curious why its long is probably the reason why somebody will start to read this e-mail and trying to find any meaning into it and what i have to say. Then you will realise that this is one long e-mail without any meaning at all. Anybody who thinks I should become a writer, please reply to this email. Maybe this e-mail will spread around and become the standard on how signing off letters should be written. That is the ultimate flattery for me. Well, everybody has a dream.  I'm not sure if this e-mail is long enough but I've got a lot of time in my hands and will be doing productive *cough* work during my last day in Mesiniaga. If any of you are still reading this,  I admire your stamina in reading this very long winded signing off e-mail which is basically written to waste your precious time. Or as my earlier prediction, you have too much time. And i have a lot of time in my hands. I was thinking of writting at least a 10 page essay about this and keep on rambling and rambling and rambling, but I'm tired of my own rambling and will stop rambling once i think that my rambling is becoming more annoying than just a normal meandering, tiring rambling. SO lastly, in the words of Led Zeppelin, RAMBLE ON.   If you manage to finish reading this meaningless e-mail,  I SALUTE YOU!!  Wish me luck on my new adventure/job.  Cheers & Goodbye  Huzir Zulkarnain

      Currently Freezing my ass off in the server room of Asialife..ughh bah...its like cold and shiet yo...And where the heck is my haloscan to get other ppl to like gimme good comments and shiet..hehehe...Well..other than practically freezing my butt off..I'm actually working..wohooo..3 cheers for me...:)  Anyways..just to share with you wot happened to me yesterday..There i was like driving back to subang after a customer meeting in town using the KESAS highway..was like listening to some crappy songs on the radio...talkin to my hoe and crappin away...then you know the flyover near summit one right?? Well..apparently I was going when it was green..disregarding the copper that was standing in the middle. Feeling abit shitty.This is what happened.   Copper: AAaaa...ini dia..pergi tepi..You tak nampak saya ka???saya tak panggil jalan you mau jalan juga.  Me: hah??itu lampu hijau ma...lu ingat apa??hijau jalan la..merah berhenti la..  Copper:bawak lesen...  Me:(gives him my license)  Copper: berhenti tepi sana..  I stopped at the corner  Copper: You taiping datang..takda polis sana ka??ada lampu saja  ka??Kalau saya kata jalan..you jalan..kalau saya kata berhenti..you berhenti.  Me: Suka hati saya la..Itu hijau kalu..saya jalan la..  Copper: sekarang macam mana? sudah buat salah macam mana?  Me: woi.. mau saman you saman..mau cakap apa lagi..cepat sikit...saya takda masa.  Copper:(looks at me). You mau ka saman??  Me: Woi..you pekak ka??polis kat kl semua pekak ka??saya kata kalau you mau saman..cepat sikit la...  Copper: You kerja apa??  Me: I nih kerja apa ada apa kaitan ngan you saman saya?   Copper then starts to saman...going behind my car looking at my number plate..looking at my roadtax and shiet...  Me: woi..cepat sikit la...apasal polis kat kl nih semua lembap..tableh cepat skit ka buat kerja? Mau saman tuh cepat la..  Copper then looks at me dissatistfied and shiet..and then hands me the summon and says..  Copper: okie..sekarang nih..sign sini..ingat apa??  Me: Tak Mau..saya rasa saya tak buat salah..apasal saya mau sain..  Copper: You mesti sign jugak..  Me: okie la..you tulis sana..itu lampu hijau bila saya lepas.  Copper: Tak boleh tulis camtuh..ini Kesalahan tau..i tulis kesalahan jer..  Me: Apa susah mau tulis..you tulis saya sign.  Copper: tak boleh tulis..saya tulis kesalahan tuh cukup la.  Me: Tak mau tulis sudah..saya tak mau sign jugak.  Copper: Eh..you nih kerja apa ar?  Me: suka hati la saya kerja apa...ada kaitan ngan you bagi saya saman?  Copper: Ingat apa?? You tau banyak fasal law ka?(asking his colleague to come along..sudenly got like 4 ppl sorrounding me).  Copper: Sekarang kalau you tak mau sign..Saya sign bagi you.  Me: Sign la..lu ingat apa...saya tak mau sign jugak  Copper signs the summon paper and throws it in my car together with my license.  Me: you banyak biadap ar....buang benda saya sini sana...  copper then just walks away after i puas hati dissing him off alreay  well...twas fun but I guess I'm gonna be around a 100 bux poorer due to my crankiness...but i wonder..is it possible for the police to sign on the behalf of you??I dont think its legal though.. Dumb bitching police that just wants some kopi duit..screw them man..I aint giving them a cent...rather the government rip me off than those damn coppers.  i think theres a rule about them being biadap and shiet like the copper also right? but hell..its my word against theirs..:) might as well just quietly pay the summon and finish it off...:)

      Well..yesterday I was in bangsar..was like circling around the area trying to spot a parking spot..and voila....a LEGAL parking spot just right outside Lotus. Its like so hard to get a legal parking spot in bangsar..as most of you guys and gals that frequent bangsar will know..usually i end up parking in those residential areas..but today...not today..as I felt lucky and wanted to test my luck...So backed my car up and parked it nicely into the spot...  Went over to frankfurther house and had a big ass pork knuckle for lunch with some german beer...utter ecstacy....beer with pork is like the perfect combo...After lunch...went over to meet me hometown friends in starbucks...went there around 4.30pm and sat there till like around 6.30pm...As I was heavily engorsed into our topic of conversation i noticed the crowd getting densed...I turned to my back and was like...OMG!!! It's pasar malam night in Bangsar...  Why OMG you may ask... CAUSE MY FUCKIN CAR IS PARKED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PASAR MALAM....FUCKING KANNINE CIBAI PUKITIANG LANJIAO BERKUDIS MUTHAFUCKIN SON OF A PASAR MALAM....  So hastily I ran over to my car just to find 2 sticks leaning against my car from the stall selling 'bak chang' and some dude grilling some satays beside my car...OMG..my car is gonna be so so oily..that was wat that was going off my head...  Talked to the hawkers and asked them what time will they be over..Of course i do not wanna piss them off as my car is kinda like taking their business spot..so I'd rather not say anything like asking them to move so i can get out..cause i had to call the whole stretch thats behind my car to move too..which i dont think is feasible in their eyes.. So the satay dude..answered me by saying around 11ish...I was like...WTF...its not even 7pm..what am I gonna do in bangsar for so long la....  Thank god for relatives..Waited for a friend to pick me up to my cousins house which is like in the vicinity...then lepak with him and had dinner in his house... bath and everything....then around 11ish..he fetched me to my car...  Fucking car was like covered in oil...grim....dirt...fingerprints..mark of some dudes butt on my bonnet(my guess is that somebody sat on my bonnet whilst eating satay). Satay kuah and also the sohai Fatman Steamboat that was parked right infront of me seemed to have spilled some of its loklok sauce on my car too....My gawd..my cars a mess....Last time it was a mess in the inside.now its a mess on the outside too....  Geez...but luckily my car is still in 1 piece...no random dude punctured my tyres or smashed my windows due to my parkin on their business spot..:)  but its all good...the toolan part is like waiting until the pasar malam is over then only i can get my car....:)  But my aunties loh bak for dinner on sunday was good....yumyum..made me all happy again..:)

      Was out in one of my customers site yesterday due to some problems that they were facing..as I was busily explaining to them bout the situation and stuff..this dude(their boss...this is during lunchtime) shows up and asks "eh....tak nak makan ker??(which means hey...dont you wanna eat?)"he was like holding a plate of bigass baryani rice with some chicken rendang and some beef..and the works i guess...on his right hand and a styrofoam cup of some cordial orangy juice(Atleast I think it was).the food he was holding on his right hand will really make you look in awe...its another on of those mysteries as in like it'll make you stop and ponder for awhile...a good example would be like.."How did those damn egyptians get those big slabs of rock up so high to build this god-damn pyramid...and why would their kings require a tomb this big?" that kinda thought...So basically what was going through my head was..." how the hell can a fat-fuck(not to say im thin..but he's fatter..so there) like him manage to stack those chicken, mutton, vege and 'papadams' so high up and still manage to balance it with 1 hand whilst holding a cup in the other and the papers clipped neatly between his smelly ole armpits.."...Well that's what i was thinking..no clearer way to describe it yo...  But hell..he's not worth my effort describing about anyway..what's really worth me talking about is this..get this okie.... I asked my customer..why the sudden party with food and booze and naked chicks running around(okie..maybe there weren't naked chicks and booze..but orange cordial comes close to booze I guess..looks abit like a tequila sunrise or an AK anyways). Our conversation was something like this  Mr. Customer:oh...ada orang nak belah nih..(transaltion: ohh..there's somebody leaving). Me          :Kira farewell party la nih(So I guess this is considered a farewell party) Mr. Customer:Boleh cakap macam tuh la...kerani kita nak tukar department...turun 2 tingkat dari sini ke department lain.  I was like abit blank for the moment la....Its like..imagine. you change department and moving 2 floors down only(and its not even a promotion okie)..the whole department buys you pressies and throws a big farewell to you..imagine..what are you gonna talk to the guy/gal about...Well..I hope you have a brighter future 2 floors down...keep in touch okie...we wont be seeing each other as often already cause you're like 2 floors down from us...you take care okie...there'll be new unfamiliar faces down there and dont hesitate to give us a call k???  WTF???This kinda tops my list la of absurdity...why would you wanna do this for...maybe just to blow their budget or something i guess...imagine..I've changed like 3 depts in my company, moved around like ermm....5 floors of the whole 12 floors..and I dont even have like 1 going away party or crap liddat...this blows man...  Well..anyways...it was good as I joined in the fun and pigged out....so free lunchie for me since they were like asking me to eat and all...was doing my work and suddenly some random dude will come ask me to go eat..so I was like..okie la..since so many ppl called me already(which was around 2 ppl la). then i go eat lor...heheh.....who knows...if one day they're changing their aircond..there could be a going away party for their old air-cond and maybe a welcoming party for the new air-cond too....that time i hope i'll still be there to tell you the tale bout the party for a hard working forever keeping everybody cool air-cond that is about to leave...maybe got speech and all also for the air-cond...geez...  :)

      Yesterday(sunday) I was in mid valley jalan-ing around with my little nephew and my parents..so my parents left me with him and I took the liberty to take care of him...as usual being the hyperactive little tyke he is..he was practically touching and moving everything around...then i there was toy promotion and stuff which i was deeply engorsed with. bought myself a little cibie boy toy...it's just like the coolets thing ever...got like the contruction looking one..coolness...:) then after that my parents and his parents came along and then they wanted to go home already..as I had dinner at 7pm in kl..I thought..might as well just drop by my friendly arcade center to open a bag of wh00pass on some dude playing KoF.  The arcade was packed with those jinjang dudes with their multi-coloured weird ass hairdo's practically being dancers wannabes and DJ's wannabe...you wont catch me dead on those kinda machines in public(maybe in private I'll have a go at that cause i suck..hehe..therefore things that i cant do I put down I guess). Rushed over to my favourite machine..KOF 2001.. yeah man..now we're talking..  Sat my big fat ass down on the seat and started challenging this dude...whacking the crap out of him..hehe..like taking candy from a baby if you might say...then the dude stepped up and then came another dude..which i practically 0wned as well..but hell..those guys weren't good...if got some super power dude that can make like super 500001 tornado-kick-with-flaming-hand hit combo with kyo kusanagi and also iori yagami  means I would have been owned(ok...maybe im exegerating..but I'm kinda sucky at this game..but i just like the game). but it feels good whacking their asses off the seat...makes me feel like some super power being which in turn will hold the undisputed title which is called 'mahai...tiu 9 lei' by my opponents. Feels good to be cursed and sweared at when they're fucking pissed off at ya..hehehe...  ok..there i was in my 4th game where some other dude was challenging me...then came along this little indian dude(around 6 yrs old)...crying and weeping...ermm..dont ask me what he was talking about but all i knew is that he looks lost...was like mumblin something like ' yeenaporengeh' or something like that..maybe its not that la..but basically thats the only indian word that i know...and i dont even know the meaning of it...geez..So..my conscience got the better of me...I was like halfway winning the game already....the first time he looked and cried that time I didnt like really care..but then he kept on crying then i was like thinking to myself...'Why....Why????why me???why does this kid have to rob me of my glory and 'mahai...tiu 9 lei' fame'. Then i casually got up...wanted to take the kid to the information counter..perhaps they might have some indians there yo...  As I was walking..I bumped into a dude that looked like an indian and yet abit malayish..so I approached him and asked him...' hey..you indian??'...he was abit stoned la as I asked him as if I wanna whackimup like that if he's indian..so it took him awhile to answer..and after around 5,000 miliseconds later..he answered..'yeah..I'm indian...wassup?' told him the scenario bout the little kid and whether he can translate what is he talking about... So there they were talking some funny funny jargon which i dont understand...and I finally asked him what happened..he said..the little dude is lost...lost his auntie and uncle in the shopping complex(like i didnt know..was like hoping for some phone number or some crap which i could call or do).Then i asked him to ask him for a phone number...so apparently the little dude dont know his own phone number..I mean..wtf??you dont go leaving your kid around in the shopping complex and getting him lost and shiet without even like putting a dog tag on him or something like where i could return him kinda information...(maybe his auntie and uncle wanted him to lost him..at that time i was thinking its another case of those unwanted child..) but nevermind la..was walking around mid valley looking for some information counter as I do not feel like being the guardian/single parent at this particular time of my life to a nigga wannabe yo...:P  As I was walking around franticly looking left, right...center and back..up down..under over(you get the idea)..the kid suddenly stopped crying..then i saw these couple infront of me around 50m...he smiled with utmost pleasure..as if mount kinabalu has finally been sucked up in some crazy ass tornado and coincidently crashed into lishas(the bad shaped hoes) house killing all the stupid and ugly genes and making sure thats the end of the mongoloid +spastic + irritating + ugly + mutated mashimaro genes..If there's such a word to describe something like that..I'm sure it would be called lisha...  okok..sidetracked abit for awhile..lets get back to the main story...the kid just let go off my hand and ran towards the couple...they were like hugging him and patting his head and all..they looked relieved....and then they just held him and walked off...wtf??they didnt even look at me..wtf is this yo...I mean..I wasted my chance to be the 'mahai..tiu 9 lei' champ because of your kid and you just fucking walk off on me???its not the 1 buck in the machine yo..it was like my winning spree they fucking broke..and not even a drop of appreciation???geez...  but oh well..look at the bright side..atleast I didnt have to take the little tyke to the police station and fill up some report or stuff bout where i found him and stuff like that...so it was all good.....:)  After that had some super cun japanese buffet in saisaki cause my colleague lester is leaving the company...and it was all good...anyways lester..good luck in your new job yo.....:)

      Weekend was kinda lame..well..it wasn't actually lame..was like at home the whole time.. playing my game..was trying to finish up some games on my x-box cause it felt like its been awhile since i last finished playing anything..damn pirated games..  talking about it..I was playing Chronicles of Riddick, escape from butchers bay..Started playing it last monday..then I got hooked...basically sat my big fat ass infront of the tv and played it till the wee hours in the morning..and end up going to work like a zombie..thank god I was on training the whole of last week, therefore there wasn't anything that really require the use of my brain cells(not&nbsp;to say i use any of it..)&nbsp;which leaves more of it for game playin'. There I was..trying to escape from butchers bay...Actually not me..Riddick was trying to escape from butchers bay..but I'm playing as Riddick...so..basically its like I'm trying to escape from butchers bay..so since I'm Riddick...does that make Riddick me?I'm confused...but hell...lets get on with the story... there i was trying to escape from butchers bay for like the 3rd or 4th time(lets not go into what happened in the beggining as it'll take forever..and&nbsp;i know im fuckin long winded..so lets just talk about what happened at the end of the game)..Then..there were like lots and lots of those tiny cute little robots that kinda shoots out some electric charge that's enough to fry my pubic hair...So I had a&nbsp;club in hand and I&nbsp;was happily whacking and smashing those bots&nbsp;to a million pieces...then came a big mofo that had like gattling gun and also a launcher which kinda&nbsp;hurls fire bombs at ya...A few of them at once..So knowing that I was outnumbered..Quickly I ran for cover in some random room. As I entered the room. The loading sign came out..I thought I was safe... and then...suddenly...Everything was just blue...the music and stuff was still there..but...WTF!!! I cant do anything..my whole tv screen just turned blue..like the blue screen of death from microsoft..I thought that&nbsp;this is the part of the game..was like trying all sorts of shiet to get some picture back out again...but no..cant seem to do anything..  Thank&nbsp;god for streamyx...Went in to checkout&nbsp;the walkthrough for this&nbsp;game...but then...was kinda puzzled...cause they didnt describe anything&nbsp;bout no blue screen...WTF!!!!and this is like the last level...This sucks man..I felt&nbsp;that I've been fuckin' ripped off..imagine..the&nbsp;succulent taste of glory is just a few steps away..and its like you've been forced to withdraw yerself off the battle for victory...I was&nbsp;almost&nbsp;on my knees..crying and begging for the strength to go on with life...The feeling that i felt...is worse than when the time my cicak died...*sniff*...the agony...  I kept on telling myself...nola...its mostly just the disc...its mostly just the disc..So&nbsp;I called&nbsp;Boon and asked him if he had this problem with his disc..he said no..I sighed with relief as there might still be hope...Took&nbsp;the disc from him the next day in the office and tried it on and YAY!!..It works...so I continued on and finished the game that day itself...and after finished the game..I wished I had never finished it as the game in the first place cause the ending sucks...it sucks big time...Fucking hell..I went through so much trauma for this fucked up game...Cant the producers come&nbsp;up with a better&nbsp;ending...geez....atleast when i was in suspense..I&nbsp;still thought the game was good...now...I'm&nbsp;never gonna play it again....  So right now...I'm starting off with splinter cell pandora tommorow...played through the whole bloody weekend&nbsp;till 4am in the morning...Didnt even bother to go out of the house and&nbsp;was practically surviving on maggi mee only on the weekend..I'm hooked to that game again..hopefully whatever happened in riddick dont happen again...but overall...I give riddicks gameplay a thumbs up.....And about splinter cell pandoras tommorow..now that's a kickass game...that game rox good....:)  &nbsp;
