       all the shopping for the wedding is pretty much over, I think. things that's done: Florist Make-up (bride's) Dress (both mine and bride's) Shoes (bride's) Photo (the couples) Decoration (both church and home-reception will be helding at home) Hair appointment Nail appointment(my baby should love it, he alwasy told me to get fake nails. lol. I'll take pics and send them to him)  Not that many, huh? But when we were running around, it seemed like it was a lot. Especially it took the bride (my cousin) 4 hours to find the shoes she liked!! Well, I haven't got my shoes yet because they didn't have my size for what I wanted. And we could go to the same store at other mall, but we didn't have time. So we gotta get that done. And that's it. I was thinking about getting my make-up done also, but I just didn't like the artist. The style she did makeup on my cousin wasn't something for Asians... and the artist acted as if she knew everything. I mean, she put brownish makeup on my cousin...and it's for wedding! Maybe over here, it's not big deal, but in Korea, we use more bright colors like pink for brides. Even I had my makeup done with pink and light lavender. I didn't think I'd look good with pink, but it worked perfectly. The artist was saying that pink is so not the color for my cousin. I was like THIS close to asking her if pink would be my color. lol. (if she said, no pink wasn't my color, that proves that she doesn't know that much about Asians. hehe) Anyways, and it was $50 to get the makeup done... and I wasn't paying for that much! I'm going to do my own makeup. Do I look crazy? hehe (I'll have to get powder but heck, that's CHEAPER than getting makeup done!)  So that's about it. Maybe there are some more things that need to be done, but I'm not really paying that much attention to it. Why? Because my cousin KNOWS IT ALL and since she knows it all, I don't need to even pay attention to whatever she's doing. I mean, she's THE BEST and I'm NOTHING. I try to not think that way, but when I keep getting put down, or when she twists words around or get sarcastic when she talks to me, it's not helping at all.  Example: "the photographer said I was so good and that I could be a professional." then people didn't really say anything about what she said. Then they saw my pics and said they were beautiful. Guess what she said? "Well, they use special lights and effects in Korea that everyone looks pretty in their wedding pictures. I heard they even fix your face with computer." She's always like that. She never actually says the word, but puts words around. In that convo, she meant I was ugly, but she never said that. Do you see what I mean?  Example 2: "I pick up what bride's maid is going to wear. I'm the bride, so if she doesn't like it, well, too bad. I get to pick it." She was talking to her mom. Then she saw me...and told me "well, we will pick one somewhere in between what you like and what I like. But I'm the bride, and you know usually many bride's maids cry because they don't get to wear what they like." Then my aunt and I found this dress we both loved. Well, it makes me look slender and everything. The people who work at the store LOVED it on me. Guess what my cousin said: "Are you sure you want that one? Well, try something else. Don't you think it's got too much glitter or something?-there's no glitter on it.- I mean, it's my wedding and I'm the one who's gotta be the prettiest. Not you." (I'm not trying to be pretty or whatever!!) Then even after we decided what to buy, which was that dress, she kept telling me "are you sure? try something else on. try something else on." Well, too bad for her, we bought what I liked.   Example 3: I'm not going to put exact words she used on here because it can be little bit too political, but I didn't like it at all. It was about canada and america. And I'm married to an American, but I'm not an American. I'm a Korean. But she compared Canada and America and ended up putting down America too much that I was offended...although I didn't say anything. (Damn "respect your elders...")  With the things that were not political... "Everything's so expensive in America, Canada is a lot better with cheap things." "Unlike Americans who are so used to guns and stuff like savages, Canadians are more naive, and more peaceloving and blah blah" I just ignore whatever she says.  and so on and on and on...  Anyways... I kinda ignore her when I don't need to talk to her. :P  Am I being mean?  Well, forget all this... I got to talk to my man yesterday AND today. Today I had my phone right next to the monitor and the monitor all of sudden got this static going on.. so I thought my phone was about to go off. But nope. it didn't happen. So I put my phone back in my pocket, and then it rang!!! It was him!! I got to talk to him for like 15 minutes. I don't wanna know what my phone bill will say.... It's like $2/min.. because I'm in Canada right now. But do I care about the bill? NOOOO. I don't know when he will be leaving, so I'd rather talk to him as much as I could.  What can I do to let the time fly... and I MEAN FLY!!!!!

       I was so tired yesterday that I hit the sack pretty quick. So I forgot to post yesterday. Let's see... Yesterday my aunt, cousin, and I went shopping for my cousin's shoes for the wedding. We went to the downtown Montreal and we walked and walked and walked. My cousin and I stayed up till late the night before that we were very tired. Even my aunt was tired. And we still walked and walked. lol. So we decided to get some chocolate and coffee. It was helpful. :) Well, we were out for about 4 hours and we got what we wanted. Sometimes, the price doesn't mean everything. We went to places that carry shoes that are couple thousand dollars to where they carry shoes that are like twenty dollars. And we found the one we like at CHEAP place. lol. At that place, all three of us got shoes...and it was like $70 altogether. And that's in Canadian dollar! So it was like US$60. The shoes I got wasn't for the wedding, but it was something I've been looking for for awhile, even back in the states. And I found exactly the one I wanted right there and it was like $17 in Canadian dollar, including taxes. So it was like US $14!! It's a fall shoes. I'll post pictures sometime....if not while I'm here, when I go back for sure. I already took pictures of them last night. hehe.  Now that's what happened yesterday. Today we went shopping for my dress. OMG, i look like a princess in the dress. It was so hard to find the one I wanted. Well, all three of us wanted, I should say. It's white and lavender color, not something I can wear daily, though. But I was thinking that I could wear it sometime in the future like for my reception in the future maybe.. lol. (saves money!!) I don't look fat in it unlike other dresses. I look sexy, cute, hot, and everything. lol. I loved it! My aunt was like are you ever going to take it off? (she was just joking. heh) It's little bit too long and we have to get it fixed but it's okay, i guess. I kinda felt bad because my aunt is paying for it (I think she is...or maybe my cousin is....and it's like $300. well, the wedding is at the church and we have to have shawl or straps...and the strap on this dress is really thin that i need shawl..and the shawl is $40! anyways...) Well... I know I will take the pic and post it one day. It's great. We are going to go buy it tomorrow because my cousin is going to pick up the dress tomorrow.  Oh my god... I miss my baby so much. I was thinking what he would've said if he were here with me when I was trying the dress. I was thinking of him being there with me. I was thinking, I was thinking, I was thinking... I see my cousin kissing her fiance and I think... I want to start counting down the days so bad...  I talked to my father-in-law today. He said that they got the picture of my baby. The picture I've wished that I got before I left. Now I have to wait for like 3 weeks to see it!!!!! Damn Army, why couldn't they send it quicker so that I could have it with me????!!!  I miss you so much, honey. Even with all these excitements and fun I'm having, not a day goes by without thinking about you. Not a moment goes by without thinking about you. I pray God that he will take care of you and bring you home to me safe...

       I kept checking my phone today to see if Adam has called me or something.... I'm sure he's busy and I guess he hasn't got a calling card yet. I miss him...even if him being a meanie saying stuff like "I know how you and your family are when you are together. Getting drunk and stupid." (wish he'd respect my family little bit more, huh...? lol ) Today my cousin, her fiance George, his bestman, and i went to a mall to get the bestman's vest. Man, he needs twice clothes compared to Adam, i think. Well, at least around his belly, he does for sure. If not more. :P After that, we picked up one more friend of George and we all went to a Korean karaoke. My aunt's friend owns the place and they also have good Korean food. We first ate Korean food and then sang. It was expensive compared to Korea, and I didn't sing at all, which was surprise.. i let George and his friends sing. The guys had Sake and the guy we picked up got so drunk that it was funny. I mean he's bigger than the bestman, but lightweighted. lol. I don't know why George's friends are all huge. He's a normal size guy. They've known each other since like elementary/middle school...and that includes my cousin. They've been together for about ten years. Well, they've been on and off for ten years, and never been with anyone else during those ten years. Wow, huh?! That's what I said!! Well...tomorrow, George is going to drop us off at my aunt's before going to work. I'm going to go to a store and get some hygiene stuff and maybe look for some postcards for Adam and his family. If not, I will find some at Old Montreal area later. I just wanna send something to Adam soon so that he will get it while I'm in Canada. I'm still checking my phone...Maybe because someone with "Private" number called me at 2:43 in the morning... I answered and said hello and the person hung up. I wonder if it was Adam... I just hope to hear from him soon...either on the phone or email..although I'd prefer if it was on the phone...

       I just came home. It's kinda late. We went to play pool, then movies, then went to a coffee place. I'm over my cousin's home right now. It's a very new house and very nice. It's not so clean because they just bought it not that long ago but I like this house. ;) I'll take a picture of it tomorrow and scan it sometime. Something funny. My cousin Robbie, cousin's fiance, and his friends are going to a shooting range next weekend. Well, that's what they are planning on doing. And they asked me if I wanted to go. I didn't really think about it and said sure why not. Then they were talking about it again at the coffee place. And I thought...."They are all excited about this "fake" bullets...and my husband is getting trained with real bullets, getting ready to actually fight real people on the other side of the world." This is crazy... How can a life be so different when we are living on the same planet....? And I prayed...Baby, please be safe...

       Friday. Nothing much went on today. I got to talk to Adam today, which was good. He said he was supposed to go drive to Kuwait City, so he wasn't going to be able to call me tomorrow. So it WAS really good that he could call me before I left for Canada. Yes, I'm leaving for Canada tomorrow. I don't know if I will be able to post pictures while there, but I will keep up with posting messages, though. Girls went to CJ Barrymore today with the church. It was Friday, 13th, but nothing scary went on. lol. When I was in Korea, in school, it was funny because every Friday the 13th, we always had some weird weather or something like that. So I always was kinda scared of Friday the 13th. :P Well, I really should get going so I can get up early enough tomorrow. Mom talked to my aunt in Canada and my cousin is going to pick me up at the airport instead of my aunt. She said that she was going to be cooking!!! Korean food!!! I'm already excited!! And you know how I get...how I can't fall asleep if I'm excited! And you know what else i'm thinking about? I'm thinking about sending packages while I'm over there. I mean if my baby gets to Iraq while I'm there, believe me! I'm sending care package from there!!! Well... ciao ciao

       Thursday is back again. Yes. It's Free Indeed meeting day.. I feel bad for saying this but at the meeting today, I couldn't quite focus on the teaching...At first I was okay...The teaching was about relationship with Christ and God... Mr. V (Gretchen's dad... I never will be able to spell their last name... hehe)-Jerry- was teaching and he was saying that the relationship with Christ is just like marriage. He said that Christ will not tolerate unfaithfulness...and that He's jealous. He doesn't want us to have relationship with the world and with him at the same time and He longs for us.. Jerry said that Jesus wants our relationship with him to be like husband and wife relationship...being faithful to each other... Also he said that God created us in the image of Him because He wants us to be Christ's "bride." Then we went to read the Bible at Matthew 25 about the ten virgins. Jerry said be ready for the bridegroom (Christ) just like the five wise brides had their oil ready. He said there are spectators at the wedding, and there are bride and bridegroom. He said he wants to be Christ's bride, not spectator. That's when my mind started wander around... Wedding. wedding. wedding... That word always brings tears into my eyes... Will I ever get to have blessing of my family and friends in Korea...? It's bringing tears again...... Will I ever.....? I never regretted marrying my husband but sometimes...it's very rare...but sometimes when I hear of someone's wedding or something like that, I think to myself "What did I do so wrong to deserve this... One of the milestone...Any woman's wish to be a beautiful bride... I guess I don't even deserve that..." In Korea, we have this saying "First born daughter's life goes just as her mom's..." I hope and pray that my daughter will get to be the most beautiful bride in the whole world...with everyone's blessing...at a beautiful wedding. All I could think of by the time the teaching was over was, "I hope I won't be crying in my cousin's wedding..."  But am I being too selfish...? My husband is in the middle of desert, and I'm thinking about my "woman's life-time wish," which didn't get to be fulfilled... It scarred me so much that it will be there for the rest of my life but I still love him. I know I should just forget it, and pay all my attention to him and pray for him... But there are times when it's just not so easy to not think about it. And when those times come, I feel like I can't stop crying...I feel like I'm a failure as a woman...And I can't even talk to my husband about this...because I don't want to get him upset/mad/frustrated...He will be saying I'm just talking bullshit... I wanted to walk down the aisle...everyone blessing us.... Ok, ok...I should go... I can't stop... I needed to talk to someone, but had noone to talk to, not about this.... That's why I'm writing on here... Nobody knows my site anyways and it's not even listed. Which is good. :)  God, please put your angels around Adam and his friends and be with them wherever they go. Hear their voices as they call out for you, Lord.... Put your arms around them and give them strength and faith they need to go through any evil around them....

       Wednesday. Church Family Night. Today was the last BBQ for the summer. It was a chilly day and everyone had either a jacket or a sweater. It was like in 60's!! I couldn't stop thinking of my baby who was in 110's!!!  The food was okay and I stayed with Gretchen pretty much all through the BBQ. We talked about some stuff like her friend's wedding last weekend. She was a bride's maid and she said the groom was so drunk that he asked to touch her boobs while all of them were in limo!!! And one of groom's men actually asked her "let's make out later." Some guys just don't get it... Geez... And she said this one guy actually asked her "so how long have you been with your boyfriend? come on, I'm way better looking!!" and everyone was like "uhh... NO.. he is WAY better looking...?" LOL  Well, I know my cousin's wedding is not going to be like that because first of all, they've been together for like over ten years... and they were going to get married like couple years ago and decided to get a house first before getting married. They've been living together and now she's like 4-5 months pregnant. So we KNOW that she won't be drinking! :P Anyways... Yeah.. I talked to Gretchen's sister-in-law Vickie a lot. She's such a nice lady/girl. lol.  Then Terese (I don't know how to spell her name...I'm talking about Mrs. Rea.. lol.. the first lady. hehe) called me over. There were mom and daughter sitting down at the table and they were Asians. They looked like Chinese and I mean it. Especially the daughter looked like a TYPICAL Chinese. It turned out that they were Koreans!!! We actually talked in Korean. The daughter seemed like she didn't understand Korean, but I didn't really talk to the daughter. Even the mom was speaking so softly that I couldn't really understand everything she said. Well, last Sunday was their first Sunday. They've been living in the states for about ten years.. and I'm not sure if she has husband or not. She said something about it, but I couldn't understand it and I didn't want to be rude and ask her "What did you say about your husband? You don't have one?!" Mrs. Rea said something about me being an interpreter and it was clear that the korean lady couldn't really speak that much English. It was kinda weird speaking in Korean... :P  After that, I went to see Gretchen, who was supposed to be gone..and she was still at the BBQ. She was talking to Jeff, Mrs. Lee's sister's brother-in-law. He is visiting from Florida and everyone is trying to find him a girl here so that he would stay. Well, it turned out that someone introduced them to each other. lol. (she's got a boyfriend of 5 years, people!!hehe) He doesn't like Florida that much. :p He's 28 yo or something like that and he's met a "friend" who is 19!!! Then dad was saying that it seemed like he kinda liked Candace's friend Margaret, 18 yrs old girl! (Dad found this out because Jeff and dad rode together to Ohio/Kentucky when they were trying to find Candace and Lance yesterday and it was like 7 hr drive...so yup, they talked for awhile!!) Gretchen and I were saying that if they were in their 30's or 40's, ten year age difference isn't that big deal, but when one is a teen and the other is late 20's, that could be a big problem.. because teen wants to go out and party, and late 20's usually are ready to settle down if they haven't done it yet. So....What's up with this guy? lol. He's a nice guy, other than "digging" into young girls. :D Just kidding. :P Three of us talked for awhile, with Mel and Candace keep interrupting us by jumping on top of Jeff a few times. After the BBQ, they had drive-in, but it was just too cold for me to stay so I came home with dad. Mom and girls stayed and watched the movie. They were supposed to play "Finding Nemo" which I've seen like 5 times, if not more! On the way home, I asked dad if this is normal weather for Michigan.. being this chilly in August. And he said this kind of weather doesn't come until like October!!! and guess what?! I don't have any, and i mean ANY, autumn/winter clothes. It's all with Adam's stuff in the storage room!! I don't even have shoes for autumn except the Sketchers. Sounds like I'm in trouble, huh? When I come back from Canada, I might have to go buy some autumn clothes... I don't like to go shopping. :( I loved it when I was in Korea, but now I feel bad because I feel like I'm spending money Adam is working hard to make...I feel a lot better saving them. And even his parents might think that I'm just out spending their son's money...I can't stop thinking that even when I buy just a pair of jeans. "They might think 'what is she doing? buying stuff like that with our son's money when she's not even making any money?!!'" That's what I think... And when I go shopping for autumn clothes, it won't be just a pair of jeans. All I got for that kind of weather is the brown WhoAU jacket, which is actually Adam's. :( ::sighs:: Anyways... That was fun BBQ. I'm telling you, I love Hotdog!! Just like mom says, I might turn into a hotdog, just like she tells dad! lol. By the way, just a question. Where does Mel get all that energy from?! She and Candace were running and jumping around and got me and Gretchen wondering "where do they get their energy!!!!" :P Well, it was good to see that Candace and the Lee's were doing ok.. :) Time for me to hit the sack. :P Yawnnnnn~~

       I haven't been able to hear from Adam on the phone today and I was waiting and waiting because I actually wrote down stuff to talk about this time. He always asks me "what are you doing" and I say "nothing much" and he says "ok, I'll talk to you later since you don't wanna talk to me" and I go "NONONONONO!!!"  So I've actually wrote down things to talk about and he didn't call me!! lol Well, I was on the computer today going through the support group website for the 2BCT and got an alert on the messenger saying I got an email from Adam. I clicked it right away and wrote him right back! And guess what?! He wrote me right back. That was so cool. I guess the computer he was on didn't have a messenger but it WAS like a messenger. And today was the DAY to remember!!! I can't really write on here but if you want to know, ask me and I will let you know.

       I got a check from the best buy for the cell phone. So I decided to take a walk to the credit union service center. I heard that if you walk 10,000 steps a day, you'll lose weight. So I was counting my steps and it was about 2,000 steps from house to the service center. After that, I thought to myself, "Hmm, it's been forever since I've been to Kohl's or the mall. Should I walk there...?" Then I thought of the webcam and how Mel, her friend Sarah, and I walked around using the other way to go home. I took that way and stopped by at the Office Depot and got myself a webcam for Adam. There were like only 4 webcams there and they were like $60-$90!!! I missed my webcam in Korea... Well, I got myself the cheapest one. It was like $42 including the tax. I got it installed and I still miss mine in Korea. Mine was like not even $20 when I bought it, and that was last year! Well, I don't really like this one... the image is not so good, I was looking for the one Adam has. But his is Korean and I guess I can't really find that here. Oh well. I gotta get used to the states more, I guess. It still works and is cheap and Adam will be able to see me. That's all it matters. Oh, one thing I like about this is its built-in microphone. :) I don't know if that microphone will work on the messenger, but oh well. :)

       I felt my phone going off. I usually don't like to turn off my phone during the church service because I don't want to miss Adam's call. So i usually have it on vibration and so did today. I looked at mom and dad wondering what I should do. Now that he's not in Korea, it felt more urgent to answer it. Dad said go ahead answer it, mom said no he can call back later. Dad said yeah right. I decided to answer and when I opened the phone to answer, it was too late. He left a voice message and I couldn't wait to check it out. It WAS him and I was so mad at myself. He was supposed to go to the range, and then go to pick up the weapons. I had no clue when he was going to call back and I missed talking to him. Man, I was mad.  I was mad at myself. I was mad at mom because she was saying he could call back, resulting in delay of answering the phone. He left a message, called mom and dad, too. Of course no one answered. :( I was sad and upset and everything....then around 2 in the afternoon, he called!! I was so happy! He talked to dad longer, but it didn't matter. Just being able to hear his voice made me feel a lot better... :)

         urlLink     This is one of the most scary movies I've ever seen in my whole life. I wanted Melanie and dad to watch it because they love scary movies. So I asked my brother to send the DVD instead of burning off of the internet so they could read the English subtitle. However, since the region was different, I had to connect the computer and TV. I think I ruined the resolution of my computer but oh well, I guess I can fix it when we are done with the movie. (i hope i wll be able to...) I hope Mel and dad will like this movie...(yup! this is a bribe!) I will have to call home later to let them know that I got the movie and thank them. :)    urlLink

       It's awfully early. At 6, I woke up to my cell. I had a text message from my husband through the AOL messenger. He told me to wake up and come see him. So I woke up(grrr, huh? lol) and went online to see my baby. He was using webcam and it was nice to see him. I should get one, too. Soon, too. Then, he told me he was sorry for earlier. I didn't know how to respond to it, but I know I was smiling. :) I should get back to sleep...but I just wanted to write how much I love him. I didn't explain anything more to him about how I felt, but it's ok. I mean, if I tried to talk to him and explain it to him about how I felt, he would've got frustrated...which I don't want. Well. good night.. uh.. good morning... whatever it is. :P

       Love is such a blessed emotion and it's great to have someone to love. Love is a blessing not everyone can have... But if you are not able to express your own feeling because you are scared of the other person leaving you, would that really be love? If you feel yourself pathetic because you are so scared, is that "love" really for you? If it were really love, would you be taken for granted and treated in such way? Maybe you are spoiling the other because you are scared, causing to be treated like you are a nothing more than a bug... nothing to be grateful for. And it all goes back to the beginnig.. Even when you get treated in such a horrible way, you can't speak out because you are scared. So you let the other have his way, spoil him, being treated like sh*t, want to talk but can't because you are scared, let him have his way, spoil him..and it goes on and on... Then you justify his action for him, telling yourself that it's understandable because he's so and so...So...how much more can one be understanding...? One way love....could that be it? Maybe I really should let him leave like he wanted... All he's doing is yelling at me to do things for him...and I get yelled at again when things don't happen in the way he wants...even when there's nothing I can do about it...It's like I'm his maid...and to me it seems like he's never thankful, and if he was, he never shows it... But he "ends" his orders and yelling with "love you." Shouldn't actions show more than words...? He says it, but does he act it? Even now, I can't talk to him about this because I'm scared that he'll leave if I told him this. He will just get mad instead of trying to change or do something about it. So what am I really scared about...? Losing him? Being divorced? Losing "love"? Someone getting mad dat me? The thing is even after everything... I still love him and try to understand him because I love him... I mean, love is like being there for him no matter what... But I just wish being there was not so hard... that i don't have to cry... But it's ok, Tara! Cheer up... because after all, he's the one you chose...although you didn't get to go through the ceremony...which will scar you forever. :( (i pray that i won't cry in Canada....I'm going to be standing at a wedding as a bride's maid, and that's my first one ever..and I'm MARRIED. Standing for the first time at someone else's wedding... I might cry...)

       Thursday. Free Indeed. Today's meeting was on " the characteristics of a justified christian ." It was a nice class... There were some things that touched my heart...like "you have free will, but doing things on your free will causes you to become miserable." "If you do not change, you will not have peace." Those two definitely could relate to me. The one about change, if it was not the Lord and the Words, I would've not been able to have as much as peace I had with what I had to go through. If it wasn't the Lord's help, I would've had no peace at all. So I pray that the Lord will give Adam peace just like He gave me... along with protection he needs.   Well... here are some of the characteristics..   1. We should be thankful or grateful for God   2. Serving with our spirit   3. Praying without ceasing for others as well as ourselves   4. Asking permission (or doing things according to His will)   5. Desiring fellowship with other believers   6. Having a giving heart (helping others so that they can be established as Christians)   7. Comforting and being comforted by and for others   8. Ready to give your testimony or preach the Gospel(good news)   9. I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ

       I went to sleep at like 4 or 5 in the morning...why? because I was so nervous and worried that I just couldn't get myself to sleep. Then there I was. In the morning. With my eyes wide open. I was sleeping, but all of sudden, I woke up...which is very unusual. Since I went to sleep so late, I "was supposed" to wake up around noon. So I was laying there wondering why I was up. I was having a nice dream. I did not need to go to bathroom. There was no reason for me to wake up....UNTIL my phone rang! I answered my phone. I was still out there. "Hello" "Hello" "Uhh... who is this?" "Duh.. this is your husband!" I could NOT believe it was my husband. So.. yes, he's doing fine. He felt like he was dead and was in hell because it's so hot over there. He's in Kuwait right now. He said it was like 100 degrees at 2 in the morning! I talked to him on the phone for about ten minutes. Then about 2-3 hours later, we even got to chat on the messenger. We gotta love this technology!! Phone, Internet, Messenger... (did i mention internet? lol) He texted me on my cell through the messenger letting me know which messenger he was on. So I got on and we got to talk more. After I was done talking to him, I was thinking... God woke me up so that I could talk to him. If I wasn't up, I know I would've slept right through his call!! Thank you Lord. There were some things that we were not happy..like mishandling of his notebook, resulting in crack on the screen. It costs $700 to get it fixed!! But he's there safe and I pray that he will make to his camp safe... I love you, and miss you....

        urlLink    My husband left Korea yesterday (August 4)... I am very worried and everything, but still proud of him. Being an army wife isn't so easy..but this came with who I chose, and I'm going to support my husband with everything I can...because I love him. It still doesn't feel like he's going to be in real "danger" zone... it still feels like he's in Korea. But I guess it's going to take awhile to actually sink in. Being on the other side of the world from your loved one is not so easy. But I'm not going to just sit and cry and feel pity for myself. I'm going to go out and do things so that he can be proud of me when he comes back! School. Work. Friends. Everything....  &nbsp; urlLink
