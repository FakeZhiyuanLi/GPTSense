      When I went to the bank with Shawn today, something funny happened at BSN (Bank Simpanan Nasional). My queue number was (I think) 315, when a Malay guy asked me if I could deposit a certain amount of money (LOTS of RM50 notes btw, which would made up to..RM400+?) for him as he has someone waiting in the car etc. I find it even stranger when he told me his number was 320, and heck, it's only  five  numbers away!  His impatience was funny, because if I'm an evil thieving person I would have dashed out fo the bank with  his  money and he wouldn't be able to catch me as I would've caught him unawares. Or was it a random check on how honest society in Malaysia is? >_>  So I was trying to deposit this gift voucher worth RM350 (:D), given by Motorola (my dad's working there) for my string of 7As for last year's PMR =P I thought I could withdraw every single ringgit from my bank account and dump them into Public Bank, when I was told by BSN's clerk that I'll have to wait for 4 days for them to process it. WTH? Having being told this by them, I'm getting put off by BSN and sure as heck will not ever dump in my savings into it, thanks to their incompetency.  Took several pics of the sky 'round evening, it was a creamy yellow and 'twas marvellous. Too bad it was marred by the tall buildings or what not >.           Pretty neat, no? =) Again, camera angle's bad due to these annoying tall buildings and trees>.

      I had this sort of inspiration on viewing the pictures on  urlLink Neave.com ; trust me, this guy's a genius with Flash and photography. With the inspiration in mind, I went out at about 2am today, gingerly opening the locks of my house door and went out with my trusty ol' gettin-rusty bike. I brought out the StarRewards postcard to mail it at the USJ8 mailbox as well.  You don't know how careful I was not to make any sound, but the automatic gates of my house banged together rather loudly - at least it was to me, in the middle of a dead midnight (or very early morning). Heck, I can imagine my mum's sheer horror to find me missing from the comforts of my bedsheets and rush to the police station teary-eyed while explaining to a bewildered police officer that I'm missing (hmm, but there's that 24-hour requirement, no?). I was also tempted to put up a post-it note on my door or something, saying "Am out for midnight photography." But then I wouldn't be able to answer my mum's questions as to why I would do such a crazy thing. Do y'all think I'm out of my mind?  Well, I did lotsa crazy things as well, like taking a pic of myself lying down in the middle of the road with the help of self-timer, but the pic didn't turn out that well (darn lighting, and I didn't turn on the flash for fear of um, people noticing my inane act). I guess I did felt adventurous, and that's adventurous ol' me for ya :P  When I finished cycling to USJ 8 and wandering around aimlessly at my USJ14 neighbourhood, I heard footsteps behind me and cycled ahead, as I did felt a lil afraid. When I returned to my house gate, to my horror, I saw the same guy, shadowed by the darkness of the night, sitting opposite my house gate! Well, what did I do? I went around cycling to the back of my house - to the restaurants and all to allow him some time to get out of the vicinity of the row of my house.   And near 7-Eleven's Indian 'mamak', I saw a Form 5 guy with another guy and a girl (presumably my schoolmates, I think, though I can't quite recognize them at the moment). Mr Form-5-Guy ( which I now recalled he's Ayub )(waved at me asking " Eh, dah malam tak nak balik rumah ke? " (It's already late at night and you don't want to get home yet?). I merely smiled and waved back and cycled back home, as I barely know that guy and socially-inept me prevented me from having a good conversation with him. >.  On a side note, I guess it's a good beginning for a blog. More (un)interesting ones to come; I'm off to bank with Shawn soon.  Below are some of the pictures I've taken; they don't turn out that good 'cause I didn't bring a tripod with me at that time, and..the lighting's real bad at times.       The supposedly firemen's squatters?     GETS bicycle shop at USJ 8 XD     I've no idea how the picture turned green o_O Must be that green light thingy from my digicam, which I've no idea what it's for

      Shawn said, it's like waiting till SPM's over. Geok Leng agreed with me that we hardly notice that these exams stretch out to almost three weeks (technically). I remember during my PMR days, I shudder seeing my seniors "suffering" from 2-3 weeks of exams, where else we used to have only 1 week of exams (or even 3-4 days). Times change. :P  After finishing a badminton game, at about 7pm, I saw the sky beautiful with the sun's setting rays. Managed to take several (rather nice, in my opinion :P) still life pics, as well. The still life pics are inspired by Neave's site. ;)     Weird colour o_O The sky's not supposed to be this colour, but I like how the houses and their antennas have become silhouettes.           Here it is...=P      I suddenly thought of this while sitting down opposite this vision school. =P

      I think I did pretty well in my Add Maths paper II today; not because I am 100% sure that I did correctly for all 12 questions, but because I actually  finished  the paper with 5 mins remaining (with um, the exception of some sub-questions that I skipped :P). And I actually managed to solve a question that most people, including Eugene, did not manage to get. =P (except for [grr], Suet :P). When I passed up my paper, Miss Then exclaimed, "Clement! You're submitting a thesis or what!?" I used waaaaaay too many papers. *sweats*  I have to thank Eugene for all his private tutoring :P Guess it really pays off now ^.^ I cant seem to er, redo the questions that I did during exams. >_> I forgot my working, somehow. It always happens with Add Maths.

      It was, in a way, a very weird but pleasant dream. I dreamt me and my mates - Shawn, Andy and Ryui Bynn - heading to Genting Highlands with Ryui Bynn driving a car (I can't remember the exact make of the car...). Then when we reached there, I saw my "pet sister", Whitney, who was walking through the snow. (Yeah, for some reason it was snowing >_>)  I remembered we were approached by a group of weird Japanese people, and Whitney talked to the Japanese lady in Japanese, and me saying something as well. I remembered what I spoke to the lady, "Kanojo wa watashi no tomodachi desu yo." ( She's my friend. )  Then, everything else was half-videogame. We climbed this weird escalator that moves upwards towards the shopping mall at about 45 degrees. Whitney and I fell down at one point, but we headed upwards. I remembered avoiding a stab when we entered this capsule-like elevator; the lady in a weird costume had tried to slash me with a scimitar-like weapon.  Can't remember much about this dream, apart from me envying Ryui Bynn driving the car. The rest of us were asking if we could test-drive it as well >_>  Maybe this dream happened because of um...several things in real life. A plan to go to Genting this coming Friday (50/50 it'll work out), and RB jokingly said that he'll drive Andy home yesterday night. Nevertheless, weird, but nice =P

      Got back from Ryui Bynn's house. The whole afternoon and night was spent at Eugene's house studying Add Maths...his dad also spent us KFC! :D And um, some of my friends were doing the farting competition thingy >_  At about 10.30pm, went to RB's hse (and  tapau-ed  some  limau ais ). We played some street soccer, Andy and I against RB and Shawn. Lost miserably, and when Andy kicked it hard somewhere, the ball was missing o_O We searched for quite some time among the bushes with two torchlights, but we still couldn't find it.  RB's house was situated opposite a deep monsoon drain. We went down, with me trotting behind feeling a little scared. It's about 12am, and us going down the monsoon drain is a little bit un-nerving, as I was behind the rest of 'em. We saw some black plastic bag in a box which resembles a dead baby or something, with a toad on top of it. We can't find the ball, but found another deflated ball which isn't ours.  Weird. It's a little scary searching underneath the big, strong trees and its long branches. Especially in the dead of the night, despite the lamp-posts. We were joking, saying that RB would find the ball on top of him at night, or perhaps at the porch of his house. >_>

      Ironic, that I had a certain fixed schedule daily during my exam period. Got back from school at about 2-3pm, played around with the PC and I will usually be taking my nap from 5-7.30pm. Next, it's PC again or I will be doing my spot of studying.  Take yesterday for instance. At 12am I tried to read my econs but my eyes were droopy. I ended up using the PC for some time, felt more refreshed and studied a little =P Lost and won my bet on some matches from Euro 2004. Damn Beckham and his freaking missed penalties! That costed me RM5 >_>

      On 19th July 2004, Saturday (two days back), went out with Shawn to collect our ICs from the respective department. It took about 30 minutes but because my parents wanted to make new ICs as well, we ended up walking towards a Taipan-like area searching for a cyber cafe in vain. I bought the latest Galaxie mag with The Corrs' Summer Sunshine lyrics in it :D It's full-page too! Perfectly luscious.  I had a bout of unfortunate diarrhoea, might be due to the iced coffee I took at this coffee shop for breakfast. It was...annoying and painful, to say the least.  After our IC-collecting feat and lunch at home, the both of us went to Eugene's house for some intensive Add Maths under his wing. Wai Hong didn't study much, and Andy came for a short while before he left for tuition. After studying the dreaded subject from 2pm-6pm, we had a break and played Capcom vs SNK 2 and a Harry Potter's Quidditch on his PS2 till 7pm. Then we walked to the nearby Maju-Maju restaurant for dinner, with Ryui Bynn and Andy.  Resuming our studying with the exception of RB, went back to Eugene's house and studied diligently up to 10.30pm. I think I'm good in my  Sukatan Membulat  now :D Went to RB's house nearby and  lepak  till 12am, where we played 'Monkey' with a ball or simply chit-chatted with two candles. Went back to our houses with Andy's sister's car.  Fast forward next day (20th July), I woke up at 2pm O_O At 4pm I slept again till 6.30pm. Studied Bio (as I did not study it that much yet) from 8pm to 12.30am. Went online to seal a bet with Gopi (which I lost - RM2.50, Spain vs Portagal; I took Spain). at 2am, I studied Physics till 3am and only slept at 3.30am. Then woke up 3 hours later, blurry eyed and tired.  Throughout the entire day I felt sleepy and heavy-headed - with some slight headache as well. Guess my Bio's okay as I spent that crazy amount of time yesterday (but I did forgot some of the terminology, names of parts...). Physics was horrendously hard. I felt English Paper I was the best :D I didn't have much time left as I had written 4 pages of essay and had to end it abruptly (something about my school on fire, while injecting some humour into it :D). Ms Then, who was in the class, pointed out to me subtlely while I was writing, that I had my tenses wrong. On triple-checking it, I found nothing wrong whatsoever o_O  It goes "...then all hell breaks loose." I see nothing wrong in it; and I don't think I'm supposed to change "breaks" into "broke" either. Curiously, I can't imagine Ms Then tipping me off XD She's a disclipline teacher in charge of the prefects! She was laughing out loud when she read certain parts of my essay as well XD

      While pondering over my English paper II over the question "what's the meaning of 'just as fair' in the poem The Road Between?", the torrent of wind that had already blown soo hard that it threatened to tear the school to bits, managed to snatch my paper away and sent it over the edge of first floor. o__O Pn Lijah was a little funny XD She was downstairs at the assembly grounds, exclaiming, "Clement!  Kertas kamu jatuhlah! " in that squeaky voice of hers =P When I went downstairs to retrieve it, En Azlan passed the paper to me. Earlier on Jun Man from 4B suffered the same as well. :P  It's the second time that had happened this year, the first being my Moral paper from first term thrown over to the assembly grounds as well. >__>  England won 3-0. Bah! I sorta knew England would won terribly over Switz, but somehow... I should said NO firmly to Gopi in the first place, to bet over that match. >_  While the wind/thunder/rainstorm occured this morning, I sorta had bits and pieces of what to write for a poem and pieced it together when I got back from school. Not very good, mind, just a try at poetry-writing :P   The Rain   The blowing air, Like an angry child, seized and tugged at my waft of hair, In its fury, Unleashed its breath upon me, Chilling my body to skin and bone.  White ghosts floating above Across a body of grey, unanimously, of various apparitions Flow with the flow At an impossible speed, And the body ceased to smile.  They can hold no longer, Weeping and wailing at unsightly sights that offend, A yelling crescendo, All ceased at the conductor’s hand, Abruptly.

      In my whole life, I find myself happy to be able to help people in any way, and I find myself being bombarded with people asking me to help out with their PC-related problems, which I happily obliged. Not that I'm an expert in this field, I just have lots of experience and read InTech a lot as well, plus sometimes through the GameFAQs message board which I frequent.  It just so happen that recently many, many people have been asking me for help; and I can't help but wonder if I'm being taken advantage of? *looks blankly for several seconds*  Nah :P Maybe I'm just naïve, but I'm happy enough to be able to help. Even if you can't solve their problems all the time, I feel contented. At least I tried, at least I helped. I don't consciously think of the word "help" all the time, I just thought of it today =P   Went to Joe's house to uh, try and solve his modem driver problem thingy. His parents and his sisters are at home, but not him himself. His dad's really really friendly, and in a way he reminds me of my dad (although I have my fair share of disagreements >_>).  Betted with Gopi today:  England vs Switzerland (this midnight) - he insisted I took Switz which I did, and gave me 1 ball. RM5 :P France vs Croatia (next early morning) - we betted on scores instead. I guessed it might be 2-1, while he betted 2-0. RM2. Italy vs Sweden - I took Italy, gave him 3/4 ball. RM5  In short, RM12 in total XD I'm not sure about you guys, but betting on footie matches brings some kind of excitement and I kinda fancy it =P And yeah, I guess I've never betted that much before, and this is my first time betting over RM3 >_> Gopi even betted with Mr Victor (discipline/ Penolong Kanan HEM  teacher), Matthew's dad. XD RM10, apparently; Mr Victor took Croatia, fair game. It's unbelievable, but Mr Victor's full of surprises =P

      *sighs*  So the Germany vs Netherlands (Holland) match turns out to be a draw (1-1), so I didn't lose nor win my bet of RM3 with an older friend. :P And Ms New Girl's not in our class yet, either.  Tomorrow marks the start of technically 3 weeks of exams. I'm looking forward to do Additional Maths to get over it, quickly. Which would be next Tuesday, I think. Currently I'm sick of having being told when to sleep/study by my parents, especially my mum. The incessant nagging made me unleashed curses after curses (to myself, of course), and frankly, it would be better if they trust me that I know my own life and schedule better and would they please stfu. Thank you. >_  *runs off now to watch Charmed on Star World*

      Yesterday, after Miss Then, our Bio teacher, reported that there will be  yet another  new student in our class - a girl - everyone started obsessing about meeting her (including yours truly). There's the fun and excitement on meeting a new member to our class; she didn't turn up today, though.  Was reading my History yesterday midnight when I heard this song by Vitamin C,  Graduation (Friends Forever) . There's like a year and a half to go, and I wonder where all of us - my friends - would be once we grew up? Would genius all-rounder Suet Li be the greatest doctor/scientist on earth? Would Ryui Bynn be a geologist? Would someone from my class discover the ultimate cure to HIV/AIDS?  Part of the lyrics ring true to me, and made me think:   So if we get the big jobs And we make the big money When we look back now Will our jokes still be funny? Will we still remember everything we learned in school? Still be trying to break every single rule Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man? Will Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan? I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly And this is how it feels   To all my friends and those who knew me in some way, the chorus portrayed by this brilliant song, I'm saying this to all of you from the bottom of my heart:   As we go on, we remember All the times we had together, And as our lives change, come whatever, We will still be, Friends forever...

      Phone Booth, starring Colin Farrell is an intriguing movie. If you think that there can be no interesting storyline revolving a phone booth, think again, as the script-writer of this movie has managed to stretch the story beyond an hour in a most interesting manner, touching on subjects such as infidelity.  It's an emotional show too, somewhat, and has an interesting message at the end of the show - that you hear a public phone ringing, you know it's a wrong number but you pick it up anyway - and find that your life (as well as your love ones') is endangered by a serial killer sniper.   Oh, and camera angles revolved around buildings, the street and the phone booth for the most part of the show, so it's definitely interesting. Expletive are used freely in this show as well - you've been warned. :P  Kill Bill Vol 1 - it's nice as well, but too much unrealistic violence - blood spilling forth like fountain etc. Japanese accent by main character (Uma Thurman) is horrid, while Lucy Liu's slightly better (playing an underground Yakuza queen in Japan as a Chinese-Japanese American).  Did I also mention that the subtitles for both DVDs are...terrible? Horrid grammatical mistakes, and they don't follow the characters' speech as well - I just had to turn the subtitles off, for once. Bah! But that's what you get for pirated stuffs done locally >_>

      Just watched Black Hawk Down yesterday, a movie about war in Somalia. It just goes to show that war, no matter for whichever and whatever ideals, always end in greater loss of lives; how men needlessly throw their lives away, dying in the most horrifyingly grotesque manners, wounded at all sorts of odd places. War is ugly.  “This is civil war,” said a Somalian, “and this is our war.”  Why do people have to interfere in other people’s war? Why does former US President Clinton have to send his men out to do his dirty job? It’s easy to command soldiers to fight, it’s easy to place his ass onto some chair, and counting casualties “19 died, 56 wounded” like they’re simple maths, when the soldiers who fought bravely out there yelled “Man down! Man down!” signifying the importance of lives. They’re more than just numbers, they’re lives.   Seeing a man’s torso got completely destroyed; your driving comrade blasted in the face by pieces of mirror and got blinded, with you yelling, “Step on the gas pedal! Keep stepping on it!” while you semi-calmly take control of the wheel; your teammate got deafened by sudden firing of the weapon you’re using; and a man whose pelvis got wounded badly by shots, and your mates and yourself had to perform a primitive operation using whatever knowledge they have and equipments at hand, watching your men trying to restrain a screaming friend in utter extreme pain of the highest degree as he fainted, your hand digging through the pelvis trying to clamp the arteries together, trying to do everything you and your men could do but in the end, all fails.  As he slowly wakes up, he asked weakly, “Fixed it?” and you had to give him hope, and you smiled encouragingly saying “Yeah we did.” In the end, he died. Died saying, “Tell my parents that I fought really well today, that I fought really, really well…”  In war, whatever you speak might be your last words, ranging from “RPG!” to “Fuck!”. In war, your very mind is split into several decaying matters trying to survive the onslaught of upcoming attacks. Men, women, children of Somalia are all against you. War… why must there be a fucking war upheld by bastards of politicians who had the worst and most unreliable intel that results in unnecessary deaths?  Seeing them encouraging each other, patting each other on their backs, giving them hope when there's minimal chance of surviving... I could've broke down.  In SFC “Hoot” Gibson’s words, war is about looking after men next to you. SSgt. Matt Eversmann: In war, there are no heroes.

      After finish using the PC and studying History till roughly 2:40am, I felt myself still fully awake. Deciding that tossing and turning around in my bed would be a complete waste of time, I watched The Hot Chick with lights out and used the ever-useful wireless headphone :D It has subtle sex-related jokes as well XD (not the actual act of sex, but um, basically anything to do with sex; the male genitalia, homosexuality...et al).  So um, watched till 5am. It's a really funnnyyyy show but I had to stiffle my laughters (which turned into mere smirks >.  I still couldn't sleep. So I proceeded with my tossing and turning around my bed till I slept at 7am. And awoke again at 10.30am, my mind slightly stale but nevertheless still alert but the strangest thing is, I didn't felt at all tired physically. And proceeded to do my Add Maths homework with Kai Shen, Andy and Chee Hee at the Hipermedia library for 3 hours and a half. o_O  Oh, and while walking to the restaurant where they were lunching earlier, I scraped my right heel and it was scratched semi-badly and bled. Ouch. And just few hours earlier I scratched the same spot again at the base of the very chair I'm sitting. Double triple ouch.

      That's what I've been doing of late. I slept at 4am for the past few days...and I still felt awake at that time! (and woke up like, at 12.30pm or 1.30pm later on >_ _     Now isn't this nice? =) It looks better in bigger resolution, and I focused on these two main ideas/objects; one's a decoration thingy gave to me by Julia (I think) for my birthday and another's a now-useless poem theme for my English Literature (turns out that the sylabbus changed >_   I totally hate History. That's relatively speaking, because I  do  like certain parts in History such as religions and certain cultures but putting 5 topics devoted to Islam? Hellooo? No offense to Muslims, but can't they shorten the whole thing or something? Yep, I'm pretty interested to learn more about Islam, but non-Muslims would get bored with 5 consecutive topics while Muslims would've already learnt those 5 topics somewhere in their Islamic Studies.  Oh, and eating a slice of cheese-cappucino cake and drinking Dutch Lady Chocolate Milk forthwith is a bad idea. *stomach rumbles*

      Just finished watching School of Rock. It's the type of movie that gets you all inspired and all you want to do right after watching the show is get your fingers into some kind of instrument and start rocking! Ah, but there's that one thing. I can't play. And you can say I'm tone-deaf. Oh, and I can't sing. So does this make me the next William Hung?  Ah well, I can only dream :P It's absolutely lovely when you're in a band, and you hear your bandmates play and you do your stuff. It's the best thing ever in cooperation even if it's just musically. Being an ex-vocalist, um, it's a huge embarassment when I hear myself on record, but I guess I had lots of fun. :D And that, I think, is most important when you're doing something. Go have some fun!  Quote from School of Rock: "I wasn't like this! I was fun! I was funny!" "But they, their parents! They turn me into this! They'll come to me with a nuclear bomb if something's wrong!" - Principal Miss Muller to Dewey Finn.

      Well...watched both shows yesterday night (or this early morning). Um, that show and its sequel are highly sexual and vulgar, but they do offer lost of laugh at the expense of the embarassment of the actors (and actresses). The former has a simple storyline of 4 hormone-charged guys wanting to "get laid" before high school is over; and their last chance to get it would be the night of their prom; the latter simply depicts their college life, and them renting a summer house beside a beach.  A quote from American Pie which I thought is funny: "There's this one time at band camp..." - Michelle starting off a conversation with this phrase almost every time. (well, you gotta watch it to get what I mean).  And another quote from American Pie 2: "I got peed on." - Stifler having an unfortunate incident. Again, you gotta watch it to get the joke. :P

      ...for about an hour before it finally subsides with a loud burp (and some obnoxious gaseous remains that were expelled forthwith).  Also just came back from Jon's house; borrowed 14 DVDs of various genre (and 1 School of Rock DVD which I borrowed from Shawn, who borrowed from Andy, who borrowed from Ryui Bynn). Comedies include American Pie (and its sequel) and The Hot Chick, war-themed includes Black Hawk Down, action-related includes Phone Booth and Kill Bill Vol 1 (yay!)...and, that's all I can think of for now. All in all, 15 DVDs. :D *thumps boredom out of the window*  Oh, and my new maid just arrived today. o_O Let's just hope she won't start to run away. I pity maids actually. My previous maid (who ran away) was only 17 (just a year older than me, imagine that!) and she studies Chemistry, Bio...and whatnot, before she came to M'sia. She actually studies! o_O (Okay...maybe because I have a stereotyped image of how maids lived previously in Indonesia...) I'm guessing that my previous maid ran away because my mum nagged a lot (she's a... clean-freak! >_>). Maybe maids should be named as housekeepers; the term 'maid' sounds so...um, slave-like >.

      I just realized that our mind has so much power untapped. I was roused by my dad's voice when I took a nap, and I could sort of visualize his image and his voice clearly in my mind for that 2 seconds, asking me to wake up (he was in the kitchen, in my mind). Okay, I don't know how to describe it but it's weird - it's like um, a mini-premonition of sorts that's just a milisecond faster. Okay, that may not make sense >.  Couple of years back, when we were having assembly in school, I had a deja vú - at least, that's what I'm inclined to believe. The teacher who was conducting the assembly dropped some papers onto the floor, and a few seconds later, I saw the same thing happening except that, in between the action of the papers that are falling onto the ground, several frames of time are missing. (Um, did I make sense?) You know how a video goes, so assuming that the action of paper-falling is the video, several frames of the video are missing - that it made the action...sorta interrupted.  Okay, I think I'm not making total sense at all to you guys >_> Oh, can I mention something Corrs-related? XD The Corrs are made Artist of the Month by MIX FM! Mwahaha! :D

      Yep, that's about one of the weirdest things I've eaten for lunch in a while (yesterday's). Been listening to my Borrowed Heaven album. :P Amazingly, Heng Li actually likes Angel too :D (a track from BH, directed to their deceased mum). It's going to be the second new single off the new album =P; the song is so uplifting that it's ironic, plus with the brilliant lyrics as well.  I especially like part of the bridge, when it was sung very quickly:  Confidence and conscience  Decadent extravagance  Never ending providence  For loving when I had the chance   Off BH, I like Angel, Borrowed Heaven and Humdrum. =)

      Well, watched Harry Potter: The Prisoner of Azkaban with Soon Guan and my bro yesterday night, at 11:45pm. We went there at almost 10pm, so it's semi-dead in The Summit shopping complex, but we hung around at the arcade (Time Crisis 3: god I died pretty quick >_> Tried twice too, and managed to only finish up to first half of Stage 2), bowling center (totally regretted playing bowling, it's so damn expensive after 5pm, and I didn't know that ;_;) and finally some food court centre near Summit (drank there, and watched some Chinese B-grade horror movie on TV at that moment).  So the verdict: In my opinion, the movie is sooo short (only 2 hours?) that it just didn't do justice for the books. And having switched director, there is less action compared to its predecessors, although the scenes are well-done, even if they don't necessarily follow the book in detail.  That's yesterday. Today we (me, bro and SG) watched THREE movies on my PS2 in my room, from 3-10pm (although SG left at around..9 something =P; *is borrowing his DVDs*). Chronologically, we watched Underworld (interesting, and cool action scenes, plus a neat storyline too), Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle (watched it before in the cinema, but what the heck. This one's not censored by the Government anyway), and Cheaper by the Dozen (comedic, loved this one; family-value themed).  Okay, so un-chronologically, right after we got back from watching Prisoner of Azkaban (which is about 2am), we watched Scary Movie 3 in my room (I watched the first disc before, but disc 2 just won't play on my Dreamcast for some reason). God I love this phrase, "Cindy! The TV's leaking!" XD That show is helluva funny! (especially how SG says that quote XD) - despite showing like a B-grade movie :P Raw stupidity and sex-related jokes in abundance. :P  Am changing my blog's name. The reason why I had this link "saigoexp" is because I thought of the experience points from the Final Fantasy games, only that I didn't explore the idea till Iona mentioned this. Experience points.   Life is akin to a game, every choice you make affects the future - the good and the bad choices; if you're not careful you'll end up in mortal danger, or just like the game, anything might happen. The airplane you're in might experience engine problems, but just as you thought you're going to die, the pilot manages it and has everything under control, which adds up *his* experience points - and everyday we experience new things. Won't it be neat if we can see how much "experience points" all of us collect in total? - though how much "experience points" you'll gain for each "experience" currently eludes me (it sounds impossible anyway).  Just a thought.

      Slept at 4.30 am after chatting for quite some time with Soon Guan while both of us were lying down on my bed (that is, after we finally turned off the PS2 at 2 am). Discussed about school, music, videoclips, movies, et al; basically, anything that can be talked about :P).  Then I just  had  to get up  at about 8.20 am as I have my Biology extra class in school. It's in the lab, and it turns out to be rather surprising to me as 4A and 4B were not together in one lab; instead we were to stay in our own labs, and Miss Then (my Bio teacher, in an outfit that's unlike her - some rather tight-fitting clothes) had to go to and fro in both labs to conduct her lessons.  Went to Burger King Taipan to eat; the Chicken Smoked Turkey set was excellent. Jon returned my RM50... said that his parents said I don't need to pay them for the disc, and to treat it as a souvenir o_O Man his parents are damn generous. =P Thanks unc and auntie!  What else? Spent the rest of the afternoon playing Power Stone 2 (on Dreamcast) and Soul Calibur 2 (PlayStation2). After taking a short nap before dinner, felt slightly refreshed now, and more alert. :P Soon Guan told me that he saw Galaxie mag with  The Corrs  on its cover! :D It was at 7-Eleven, gotta buy that later.  Also receive a phone call from my cell group leader, as to why I didn't attend church for some time >_> Ah well :P

      Oh lovely god and holy mother that is Mary, I'VE JUST BOUGHT  BORROWED HEAVEN!!!  Okay maybe I'm a lil emotional to the point that I might drop a tear or two, but hey, I've been anticipating this album for freaking ages!! >. _>).     Earlier this afternoon, I went to Eugene's house to study Add Maths under his wing (more like trying to finish up my homework >_ Persamaan Serentak  (Simultaenous Equation) and am currently doing  Sukatan Membulat ) (Circular Measure). Then when I went home and saw Jon's online, I went to his house immediately, paid him RM50 and grabbed MY copy of The Corrs' Live in Dublin :D Excellenté.     And now, my friend's staying overnight now. At the moment I'm writing this, he's in my room playing PS2 (Silent Hill 3) with my younger bro. I'm in a state of heaven borrowed - ecstatic, happy!  Oh, and done solving Suet's problem :P (more like the thing worked now). She can't login into her blog for some reason (season expired problem).  Adios for now!

      I had a weird dream; I dreamt I was buying Borrowed Heaven in one of the CD shops in Taipan. At first I couldn't find it and I remembered feeling disappointed until I spotted it; it has a WESTLIFE back cover, which is a no wonder why I can't find it >_> Um...okay, I know it's completely un-interesting but I thought I'd like to mention that >_>  Well, here's a virtual graffiti I made using...um, one of the links provided by  urlLink Neave.com .     Not bad eh? :P There's some sorta hidden meaning to it, that humanity's becoming more corrupted.

      Seeing that I'm rather bored now, and it's already past 12 midnight and I  really  should be studying, I think I'll write what I'm anticipating for today when I get up later in the morning.   For one, The Corrs' new album  Borrowed Heaven  is slated for release today in M'sia! :D But unfortunately, I think I don't have enough money to buy one thanks to BSN's horrid processing of my gift voucher, and I don't think I'd want to withdraw from my Public Bank account either; it's there as a fund for my planned Australia trip end of next year, with Joe :D  Secondly, Jon's supposed to return today from his trip from LA (a damned 2-week trip at that, man was I freaking jealous and full of envy >_>), where I have to pay him RM50 for buying me The Corrs' US-only album  Live in Dublin  (which is why I'm as broke as ever >.  Heck, that's  why  I'm joining these StarRewards contests (especially Week 1's, where the first prize is two return trip tickets to anywhere in   Australia  , which fits my condition perfectly). Winning some money from the contest would be excellent as well >.  And thirdly, my best buddy Soon Guan's staying overnight as well; he got his green light from his mum already :P So I guess I'll have some kinda fun these holidays.. he'll be accompanying my oh-so-bored hols for several days I guess, which I'm gonna make sure I'll maximize the days he's staying to their full fun potential ^.^  And crap, my download of Hunter X Hunter episodes 26-62 (in a single torrent file) is simply taking ages (helloo, it's SEVEN GIGABYTES!! >_  And double crap, I just remembered that I have EXTRA CLASSES on Wednesday and Thursday for Biology. Damn. And Friday's Chemistry which I'm certainly not going, 'cause the teacher's rather...boring, and she's a text-book reader for heaven's sake. Her dull monotonous voice simply lulls us to sleep (I'm sure SMK USJ8ers would be glad to fill you guys in). I'm catching up pretty well by reading my reference book by myself, without having to resort to her help.  Oh, just phoned Joe an hour earlier, and apparently his dad took out his modem and he had to study, and that's why he didn't go online for the past few days >. _  I guess that's all for tonight. Procrastinator ol' me would have to catch up on my other subjects, if I feel like it tonight :P And no, I won't be wandering around later past midnight outside my house, unless something drives me to do so =)  C'est la vie.

      Walking around in school today, I had to use the power of estimation to roughly guess who the person that was standing few metres away really was. XD I kinda got used to it, and got used to all the teasings and the stupid "guess how many fingers" game. >_>  Got back my spectacles today at about 8pm. It's fixed, and I'm not used to it. The moment I stepped out from that shop, I realized that I missed the beauty of everything for the past 48 hours - the vibrant colours of the word "Secret Recipe" written in cursive font, the big electric banner of  Restoran Nam Heong  in brilliant yellow and red, the flashing headlights from passing cars...it's like an utterly different world. Now I know what it is like to be blind (although I was far from that); after years of enduring total darkness, you went for an operation to have your eyes restored and you take in the beauty of everything the world has to offer. Which is particularly why I love photography =)  Geok Leng came to my house earlier at about 7.45pm, to transfer pictures from her digicam to my PC and&nbsp;burn them for her.

      Without my specs, my line of vision is sooo blurred it's as if someone used a Photoshop and used the Blur effect on my world, visually. I brought my cam to school, and played around with it =P I think I looked better without spectacles actually, with Geok Leng agreeing to it as well although Xin Hui said otherwise, saying that she's not used to my spectacle-less outlook. :P          I think I looked sooo innocent. XD What dya think? :P     &nbsp;  Took some photos with Geok Leng as my model for the photography contest...I had a few ideas in mind, and I think they're nice, except that the blackboard and the mirror pic was slightly blur-ish. I'm submitting the birdie pic and the last pic of Geok Leng.       Those Chinese words represent her Chinese name =P      This pic was snapped at the girl's toilet, ground floor, shower area XD      At the stairs, overlooking the field,  bengkel pertanian , and canteen.      Was in a rush trying to snap this pic. The bird was flying too fast, and Miss Then wants a scenery pic (only knew that during the last minute).

      Bah. Went for football with the rest of the team (which we called ourselves, as eXodus). Azim, Matthew, Joe, Shawn, Heng Li, Jon, Wai Hong, another ex-USJ 8er and I were there. We were training ourselves basically (...it was tough trying to kick a  straight  ball =.="), and played a game among ourselves, with Heng Li as the goalie.   After some of them Malay guys (not trying to be racist here, but they're sorta like..delinquents >_>) - namely Fareez, Helmi etc - came, we sorta lost the mood. So Shawn and I were kicking a ball between us, when Shawn unsuspectingly delivered his wonderful back-kick 'skill' and rammed the ball straight to the side of my face. No sound of anything being broken - but I felt my specs slipping off my nose.   So this is like the [insert 5 digits here]th time I've broken my specs, or have been involved in any football mishap. *rolls eyes* Shawn apologized "Sorry, Clem" about 50 times that I've nothing to say really. I'm semi-angry, frustrated, annoyed, kinda pissed...   Then I said out loud to myself (and to Shawn's face), "Think rationally, think rationally," and I noticed that it's the lens that got broken. Which means easily repaired, but there goes the moolah. Unlike some people who might yell at the offender with profanities, I simply kept my cool outwardly - since he can't do anything about it (and most likely unable to pay for the repair), neither could I.   Shawn felt most guilty and was kinda sombre throughout the journey home. Heh >_> Lesson learnt (which I never did) - don't ever wear your fragile rimless spectacles when playing football. This incident costed me (well, my parents >_>) RM70 - discounted from RM85 thanks to my mum, the super bargainer.

      Went to Jon's house at 4 something after doing a little of Moral  folio  at Wai Hong's house. Jon kindly taught me guitar - the basics, how to press them strings, etc. It hurts.  A lot.  I watched him play Gunbound while I continue pressing down the strings to get used to it. It helps in a way, as I paid less attention to the pain and to the game instead.   Next, I need to practise strumming. If only I have a guitar, I'd be able to practise =/

      Earlier today, went out to Midvalley with my parents to hunt for a pair of running shoes. I thought their budget was low (they didn't want to tell me), so I found an All-Conditions Gear at about RM170, and my mum thought it looked like the one I'm wearing (which is not); it wasn't exactly that comfy aroun the ankle area. I also phoned up Joe, the shoes expert to get some advice, and he said that he would recommend me running shoes.  Well, I couldn't find one that fits below RM200. >_> So after letting her see my other choice, surprisingly she agreed o_O&nbsp;(after asking me repeatedly whether it's worth buying such a pricey shoe >_>; and told me to choose between a guitar and this footwear. She assured me that she would get the guitar end of next month instead, so I happily agreed). So I got myself a Nike Air Max Turbulence 8.5 (US size 9); it's navy. :D Original price: RM379. Slashed to RM227.10 thanks to 40% discount from the Megasales starting today :D  Take note that this is my first pair of "pricey" shoes, I've never had the luxury of owning branded shoes, be it Adidas, Reebok etc. So...yay ^.^  Also found the book that I sought for, "most of us are here against our will" by David Levinson at MPH. Costs at an expensive tag of RM60+. Second yay for finding this book finally. ^.^

      Saturday - 24th July 2004   After spending enough aching and tiring stationing at the school entrance in a complete scout uniform - while repeatedly greeting parents with pre-programmed statements - I went hanging about in my class. It was a report card day, splendidly boring. Helped around with scout-related stuffs till about 1pm before I went back home.   At 2:45pm, I went out again to Gopi's house who took his sweet time trying on his socks and various articles of apparel. Jeremy was already at his house. After we took a wrong bus (number 10) and realized that 5 minutes later, we had to wait for bus number 4 to move. Apparently, only bus number 4 goes to Bangsar now, despite what was stated at bus number 10 that it goes to the Kotaraya.   Anyhow, the whole misadventure of this stupid bus took us a long time to reach our desired destination. We stopped at Asia Jaya to get on the LRT there (instead of Bangsar, it's further - I researched on the Net before I went to Gopi's house). After we missed the train by mere seconds, we waited a while and went on board. I misheard Suet talking over the phone, so the whole lot of us took the feeder bus to SS2, only to be told on the way that she was already at the Taman Bahagia LRT station waiting for us.   We were one hour late from the appointed time - 4pm. She had to go as well, so we chatted for roughly 5 mins before she dropped us off at the aforementioned LRT station. Hope she didn't get pissed >_> (though she didn't look like she was...) We took roughly 2 hours just to get to SS2 - horrid public transportation.   Then to get home, Jeremy and I took the train to KL Sentral (Gopi dropped off at Bangsar to be picked up by his dad). All in all, when&nbsp;we reach Court 3 (where Jerm stays), it was 7pm. It wasn't worth it >_  As I managed to convince Joe over the phone to go to an online friend's church concert (Dinghy's), I waited for him at the guard house, and talked for several long minutes to Jon who happened to be there as well (he just came back from church). Joe and I set off via bus (again >_>) to reach SJMC, and headed off to Holiday Villa. Joe phoned Geok Leng to go, while I received an SMS from Iona (yet another online buddy, whom I never met before) that she's coming as well =)   Iona greeted me with a bow and said, "Hajimemashite!" =P She's a funny, giggling lot; an interesting personality =D Geok Leng was pestering me (which she did in school before as well >_>) to  belanja  her  makan , on the basis that I didn't treat her after "9 years of friendship" XD   The church concert was nice, but the preaching was...dull. I barely understood what he's talking about, and we weren't interested at all (maybe except Ding :P). We even keyed our messages to each other via handphones, and showed the person sitting next to us what we were keying (an elderly man hushed us after we chatted among each other). Iona keyed in on her handphone, "Evolution of instant messaging". rofl XD   Joe and Geok Leng escaped to Holiday Villa's swimming pool, which I found out later and joined them for a short moment. Iona went back first (she  tumpang  us in her dad's car, to go to the nearby 7-Eleven). From there, we walked to SS15's infamous Salmon Steak with Shearn (which was Ding's real name), and ate our dinner there. I had to  belanja  Geok Leng, of course. XD Shearn was fasting for spiritual purposes, and he eats only breakfast. /swt   Went back at roughly 11.30pm with Geok Leng's car, which was extremely comfy (no idea what car that is). Reached home at near 12am. Watta busy day >_

       It’s the perfect whether of sorts when it comes to a day where we do a lot of walking. Yeah, it rained. Gloomy, droopy rain.   It all started when Gopi, Jeremy, Heng Li and I set off with high spirits to various educational institutes to request them to advertise in our school magazines. Gopi lugged his bag around that weighs thrice of my own school bag, while Heng Li decidedly brought along his lightweight bag which his connecting straps tore during the beginning of our trip.&nbsp;Mr Victor (our discipline teacher) gave us a letter, stating said students are given permission to go out of school to find sponsors for school magazine. Whee.   Gopi’s mum brought us first to Taylor’s College at SS15, braving the traffic jam along the way. “We are determined people,” Gopi reminded us several times, as we looked like some fools in a school uniform playing truant. Our first visit went okay, and the lady in charge said that he would contact us soon. So far so good.   Walking underneath the cold pelts of the rain, we proceeded to Inti with similar results. After finishing our McDonald’s breakfast, the rain seemed to be lesser than before, and we went for the Metropolitan College, again, with similar results. “We’re idiots wearing school ties,  dei ,” said Gopi.   We boarded a number 10 Metrobus to Sunway Pyramid. From there we went to The One Academy, under the pouring rain, with me shielding my precious gelled hair with Gopi’s nifty file-holder. We were made to sit down by the receptionist and waited for roughly 10-15 minutes, who told us that the person-in-charge’s line was engaged. After watching some highly unenlightening advertisements made by the academy itself on the nearby TV, the receptionist told us that that particular person is not in. Oh joy.   We went inside Sunway Pyramid and used the walkway to Sunway Hotel. I’m sure we looked like school kids playing truant, and we reaffirmed it by saying, “The difference is, we’re wearing school ties.” I mean, how many students playing truant did you see wear their school ties?&nbsp;We trotted a long distance to our next destination, Sunway College. Walking under the rain, Jeremy started singing “I’m a big, big boy, in a big, big world…” when the rain pelted down heavier (I’m sure it’s those overhanging trees with their big, big leaves >_>).   Gopi, the great one, actually managed to jump across an Olympic-sized pool (albeit with some effort)! Take that and put it at a scale of 1/1,000,000, and you’ll see that it resembles that of an Olympic-sized pool to an ant. “It’s a miracle!” exclaimed Heng Li, somewhat sarcastically. “Now I believe in miracles!”   “I feel pathetic,” I mumbled. The rain was dying away, though the drops were still pouring onto us with cold winds chilling our skin (perhaps Gopi wouldn’t feel a thing, thanks to his  tisu adipos  >_>). We arrived at Sunway College, our legs aching, but our spirits were still high, until –   “Please wait,” said the guard, which contacted the head guard we presumed. We waited for quite a long time – about 20 minutes perhaps – and we overheard the guard mentioning that we’re in our school uniform. Okay…   After the head guard showed up, he asked us for our driving license. Yay, WTF? And he didn’t accept ICs either. Thankfully, Jerm brought his student card and that moron accepted it. The other kindly guard wanted to tell us where the “Students Services” were but that illegitimate son of a female dog gestured unpleasantly at us while making a “GOGOGO!” noise that resembles a dying bulldog.   Jeremy wore a tag we all presumed was the visitor’s pass, but on closer look, it says in big bold words  CONTRACTOR . Rofl. We wandered ourselves and found Monash University’s reception centre; the receptionist was most kind, and was very friendly, which is what we needed after that encounter with that bastard. She even exclaimed on seeing Jeremy’s unusual pass. XD   We handed in the letter which quotes the various ridiculously cheap prices that our school offered to her, and next we went for Sunway College’s reception. We got our deal of RM200 from Sunway College on the spot! o_O (full page, black and white, RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP). That was like a light shining through this dark, dreary day, and our efforts before seemed worth it.   After deciding underneath the drizzle where to head next, we cancelled off plans to go to KDU (as we had no idea how to go there), and went for Taipan USJ10 after dropping off Jeremy at Prime College, Summit from a cab. We walked around to various shops and educational centres which we think would accept us (before I can open my mouth when I entered Big Bookshop, the old lady at the counter said immediately, “Boss not in!”).   One computer-related learning centre accepted our offer (she said she’s considering full page, back page, black and white, RM500. Again, RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP). April, the lady, was kind as well =P   After finishing our lunch at McD’s (yet again), we went to Erica’s mum’s house (Gopi called her teacher Anne). She’s willing to advertise in our school magazine, although she said she’d rather it be “Best Compliments from …”, as she said she get her students from word-of-mouth, and not advertisements. Very kind of her.  All in all, it was fun, and I've certainly gained a certain experience and knowledge from this. =)

      Got my haircut two days back from the salon I usually frequent to, which is opposite my house. " Zhing pok, slope! " was what Andy recommended, so uh, I tried it as well. We wanted to go to Geok Leng's auntie's salon, but it's RM16 o_O So we decided against it XD (we being me, WH, and Jon).   So the next day after school, WH and Jon stood in front of my house with their new haircut XD It's like staring at the same hairstyle, but maybe a little different individually. Jon's hair is already damn short, yet he cuts again =.=" But all of us looked better though :D   Tomorrow I'll be heading to some of those colleges near Sunway (Taylor's, etc etc) with Heng Li, Gopi and Jerm, to  beg  them to advertise in our school mag >_> Gopi called ourselves the  ambassadors  of U8; rofl XD   On a side note, I want a guitar. /swt Joe's been raving about playing it and all >_<>_>). Parents hinted about getting me a new handphone for me/mum (I share the hp with her), 'cause dad's getting his employee discount next month (he's working at Motorola, not that I fancy Moto that much but I guess a new handphone is better than this current heavy, ugly, ancient I-could-bash-you-with-my-antenna-handphone >_>).

      ...so sayeth Ryui Bynn, in a telephone call to Suet Li (I could pretty much guess what's happening, as I was beside him at that time, and no I'm not eavesdropping >_ &nbsp;  Yeah, he mightn't be the most perfect person on earth, but when we look at people's good qualities instead of focusing on the bad ones, that's how you get along with people. And why you like them despite their eccentricities and other negative aspects. =P Hell, I know it's easier said than done - I have my own bad points too, but it's better to improve one's perception of other people step by step.  &nbsp;  That said, I'm still struggling to be more socialable. I seem to be pretty much quiet when it comes to people whom I don't know or don't feel that comfortable with.

      This week, from Tuesday to Friday, I had been at the computer lab with some of my buddies from the Editorial Board of my school magazine. The computers are so fancifully equipped with outdated softwares that I had to wince. Windows98??? No Photoshop? Then how the  heck  do they expect us to do graphics?  &nbsp;  My official post stands as the school photographer, but we were pulled in to do some typing of the articles submitted to us. Once those are done, here comes the next job. Layouts (which I'm doing, with lots of hardship thanks to me using  only  Microsoft Word when I'm sure other schools are using much more higher-end programs). Jon is doing a wonderful job with the graphics, though when we refer to other school's magazines, they have like, a series of people to help with graphics, articles etc. Damn Form 5s not helping us at all (with SPM as their excuse).  &nbsp;  Heng Li never ceases to amaze&nbsp;me with his language -&nbsp;he even writes poems, which shocked and surprised all of us XD His latest work (poem), Hallucinogen, is amazing, and&nbsp;I'll have no doubt at all to&nbsp;include it into the magazine. :D  &nbsp;  So here's a little tale of the campfire that 41 scouts from my school attended. I was rushing to school at about 5pm because that's the time we were supposed to be at school; I even ran a bit. On reaching there, behold, my fellow scouts who were busy sewing badges and other appendices onto their uniform, mostly because they're missing the badge '132' (the code number for our school).  &nbsp;  We set off to SMK La Salle at about 5.30pm, with Suet Li and Suet Teng the latest to arrive; my partner sitting beside me was Ryui Zyen. Saravana Kumar made us wait for him, until we realized that he was at a tennis practice. =.=" We reached the school at about 6pm, but then it was too early (ever noticed we were always  too early ?). We sat at the nearby  mamak , and we drank and ate (I drank two cups of  teh&nbsp;o' ais,  Rebecca drank her first  teh o' ais , and realized that it tasted horrible o_O). And they even charged RM2 for a  roti telur , wtf? It costed less than that in Subang Jaya... Anyhow, when Rebecca took out her single RM5 note to pay for her drink, the guy returned 5 RM1 notes back to her XD Serves them right. >_>  &nbsp;     Here we are at that  mamak .  &nbsp;  At about 7pm, we went back to La Salle, where it was about to begin. The usual games and performances were there, although slightly disappointing because it was too dark and too far. My partner for the game Tunnel of Love was Sook Mun from SM SJ; we were pushed together by the emcee (a bit lame, that, as well >_>). It's embarassing as well that we were the first to get kicked out from the bomb game >_>  &nbsp;  I went to the toilet with Ah Zyen, trying to locate it and we were given all sorts of directions till we found it. The scout standing on duty told us, "there, go straight and you'll see that dark room". The toilet was  extremely freaking dark , and we can barely see ourselves. For the first time in many years, I was peeing at that long drain-type urinal with Ah Zyen; since we were in almost complete darkness, I couldn't care less.  &nbsp;  In fact (maybe because I drank too much), I went to the same toilet about another two times with larger groups, and didn't felt as afraid as before. And maybe because I didn't have images of girls draped in white with insanely long hair and a bloody face at that time - I just didn't felt as afraid as I were last time&nbsp;with ghosts. XD Finally semi-conquered my imaginary fear of ghosts and dark.  &nbsp;  When we reached our school at about 11:20pm, some of us went to the loo again with the permission of the guard XD Second time I set my feet in school at night (the first being the fund-raising dinner thingy); it's a unique perspective of the school. Everything was so calm and quiet, unlike the unruly days in the morning =P  &nbsp;  Anyhow, we went to Maju-Maju for our supper, and went to RB's house at past midnight; initially it was to send off Ah Zyen home while RB  temankan  that SJ girl to our school. We ended up playing 'monkey' with a football, and after that, street soccer past midnight, in front of RB's house o_O Shawn, Sasi and I were a team, and RB, Wai Hong and Andy our opponents.  &nbsp;  It was funny 'cause I was SMSing as well while playing, quite a lot of times too XD I divided 1/4 of my concentration on the ball, and 3/4 on SMSing to Soon Guan =P Mr Foo's gate (RB's neighbour) was turned into a secondary goal; whoever succeeded unfortunately to kick the ball to the gate would be converted to points for the opposing team (Mr Foo was hated by us, and we loathe that bachelor bastard&nbsp;- long story applies >_>).  &nbsp;  I cramped my left ankle and my waist consecutively during the "golden goal" hour, which took long to finish. Perhaps I didn't excercise for a long time >_>  &nbsp;  All in all, La Salle Campfire could have been better (only my 2nd campfire anyway). SMK Tinggi Klang's was memorable mainly because of the ghastly event that happened, which almost anyone - including non-scouts - had known since the tale had been told to death. :P&nbsp;&nbsp;

      On the 9th July '04, Friday, Shawn, Andy and I set off again to the terrain at TP, with Siew Keat mentioning to me in Gunbound that there's an estate there or something o_O We didn't find it though, whichever that he meant.  We managed to climb the green hill, braving the long sharp grass and other weird plants that poked our legs. In fact, we were actually afraid some species of snakes might pop around biting our legs, as we might tread onto their nests. Luckily we didn't find any >_>  We went underneath the communication tower and took what Miss Then (our Photography Club advisor) called the "worm's eye view". It's nice, artistically. What's even better we took this picture of a lonely tree, the grass and the tree silhouetting against the evening sky. It's picture perfect!         Back to yesterday, 10th July 2004, Saturday. Ryui Bynn held a BBQ party at his house; Wai Hong and I arrived promptly at 7pm with our bikes, and Jon's already there. Had a good time eating, chit-chatting, laughing - all plain ol' fun =) Daniel, Kai Shen, and Shawn arrived slightly later. We even set off fireworks just for the heck of it :P; Kai Shen, Jon and RB displayed their guitar skills, which left me mesmerized (and in turn, makes me want to learn guitar as soon as possible).  After the rest went back, leaving Shawn and I at Ryui Bynn's house, Andy arrived at about 11pm. It was his birthday that day, and he went to this certain hotel in KL for a dinner. He said that the whole floor rotates o_O (or was it the building?). We re-started the fire for the BBQ, and started eating again.   It was at about 1am when we started to clear the things. We used the fire extinguisher to extinguish the fire from the BBQ set, but then they started to play games. Well, with a fire extinguisher, what game can you think of? >_>  So it was me the cameraman videoing the proceedings, Andy being soaked with the...white dust bellowing from the fire extinguisher (well, because it was his birthday >_> even though it's already past midnight). Shawn in turn was completely immersed with it; he took off his beloved RM200+ UK-imported France jersey thingy before he was dowsed with the extingusher. Heh.  At about 2am I reached home, unscathed, untouched, despite Shawn spraying that thing at me. 'twas fun =)

      Well, two days back, Shawn, RB and I ventured out to cycle around...and with our random cycling, we ended up at TP, Taman Perindustrian (I believe it's a fairly new area). On further exploration, Shawn led us to this Faber Castell factory (with its "biggest pencil in the world", that can't be used anyway). Near that area is a green hill with two electric towers on top. We wanted to climb it on foot, but Shawn led us further up, where there's this wonderful terrain, which I think any amateur geologists would be proud of :P  At an angle, there are some plants that looked like miniature toys... actually the entire place looked like a place where you shoot them dinosaur movies. The plants are tiny...the "cave" thingy is small...in RB's words, that entire place is like a cave without the cover.  That said, RB and I climbed up this ledge to the top, and had difficulties coming down. It's not that difficult, it's the fear. I'm semi-afraid of heights, and I believe this is worse than Solero Spaceshot at Genting, 'cause even though it's high, you have no choice but get pulled down whereas this... you have all the time in the world, yet you have to do this on your own. Jumping down metres high ledge onto the soft, wet ground.  Here are some pictures from our trip:             Yesterday's RB's birthday. Andy brought some Omega3 eggs to school, and Gopi dragged him after school to the grassy area behind the B block of our school. Nevertheless, he's wet and pelted with eggs; actually, being pelted with eggs hurts. Some of us did a mistake by throwing the eggs at him instead of cracking it over the head...the impact forces the contents of the eggs out and some of us (including yours truly) got some pieces of egg yolk and whatnot on our attire. :P

      Yay ^.^ For this month of July, I'll have loads of things to watch. First off, The Amazing Race 5 is back on AXN, every Wednesday 8pm! I'm also watching this new series, John Doe, premiering on StarWorld every Tuesday 8pm. And the usual Charmed =P  Heng Li and Gopi came to my house today...after I helped Gopi snapping photos for his Moral project. They watched Basic in my room; it's an intriguing show with a most interesting plot twists ever. Highly recommended :P  We went to this mamak stall behind my house, and then it rained and thundered heavily. We took shelter at 7-Eleven shortly after, and when Gopi madly went back home under the thundering rain, Heng Li and I had some chat at 7-Eleven. He even bought a bottle of red wine that costed almost RM7, 5% alcohol. I took a sip too =P  Guess I'm gonna start writing down a schedule on The Corrs' appearances and programmes on both MTV and Channel V, so I don't miss them. XD

      So here's yesterday's entire trip. I went to school as usual, only to find Shawn and Andy not there. Phoned Shawn via my handphone and he said he's "coming". >_> We helped Ryui Bynn fixing up the hall for next Monday's prefect's convention, carrying chairs and arranging them...it was most rushed. After we have Miss Then's permission, the guard wouldn't let us out, so I brought Miss Then to clarify with the guard. She told him that we weren't supposed to be in school but she asked us to help her. So there :P  We dashed straight for the  nasi lemak  stall in front of the school, and I ran/jogged with Sasi to Ryui Bynn's house. Sasi went home with RB's bike to change, while I fumbled around with the keys to try and open the locks. While running to RB's house, we felt like those people who ran away from jail >_>   After bathing and eating there, the taxi whom we phoned arrived extremely early, and we were forced to quicken everything faster than usual. Andy duly arrived too. So we've 5 people going to Genting, an odd number. We were out of schedule, as we were supposed to be leaving by 9.30am, and it was already 9.50am.  We reached Carrefour KTM station, and boarded the train to KL Sentral. RB said that "this can't be any worse", which the entire events that follow had started to worsen. We spotted a bus to Genting that costed RM20, but on asking them, they said RM10. After deciding and bickering about it among ourselves, we decided to stick with the original plan, and ran for the Monorail station to get to Hang Tuah station.  Well, we missed the train by 5 seconds. So we waited. Next, we found ourselves at an un-familiar place (it was near the Pudu jail and Wai Hong's auntie's house). I was here before, spotted the Star station and boarded the train to Plaza Rakyat station. And here's where things went terribly wrong. We reached the Puduraya Bus Station in time at 11.30am, but found out that we can only buy tickets for the 12.30pm bus.  Was extremely pissed with myself for leading the trip to a complete screwed-up one. RB suggested walking around, which we did to Petaling Street. We then boarded the bus to Genting, and reached Genting Highlands via Skyway cable car. That was about 2pm.  Without wasting our time, we headed straight for the theme park, and we forgot everything about the previous unfortunate events. Had lots of fun; we even sat the Solero Spaceshot twice...I was freaking afraid of going up and looking down. *gulps* Ryui Bynn videoed Andy screaming and screaming where he finally 'fainted' from all that screming, when we went for the Corkscrew roller coaster. It was  extremely funny  that we laughed all the way down to Subang when we re-watched the video again. I almost had stomach cramps. XD  Ate at Burger King there, re-filled about 10 cups to fill it into a 100 plus 1.5litres bottle and two smaller ones. We took the Skyway down, and waited for the 8.30pm bus (the final bus available). The scenery - the sunset - was extremely beautiful, and that's a plus of Genting as well. Suet Li's Supreme card (World Card) didn't garner us any discounts, except points being given to her card >_>  Honestly, this trip wasn't as good as the previous one we had early January, but it was fun all the same. We reached the Subang Jaya station at 10.30pm-ish, and walked around Carrefour, which was having a midnight sale.  We waited at Salmon Steak at SS15 for Andy's sister to fetch us. By then I was feeling extremely sleepy and droopy, and jumped into my bed after a bath. Usually a cold bath would wake me up but this time it didn't; this marked the point that I was extremely tired. ;_; Probably won't be going to Genting anytime soon...this marks the end of an extremely rushed but fun trip.

      After finishing our dinner at Shakey's (to celebrate Ryui Bynn's mum's bday), Shawn, Andy, RB and I talked for ages around USJ 9...then we went out to the park. Man, the moon was beautiful. We sat a bench, with my head lying on top of Shawn's shoulder...imagining how lovely and romantic it'll be with a loved one. It was shining ever so brightly with a ring of light around it, about 5cm in diameters from where I stood.  We chatted for a long time deciding about tomorrow's Genting plan. After much discussion (revolving about the same thing), we've decided to go to school to help RB with his prefect work (carry chairs, tables, PA system in conjunction with a  perlantikan pengawas  ceremony next Monday). RB phoned Miss Then and said that she allowed us to all go back at 9am o_O This sounds too good to be true. Knowing Miss Then, anything might happen >_> Worst comes to worst, we're gonna jump down the monsoon drain and escape to RB's house. Plan number 1 fine so far.  Next, at 9.10 at most, we have to be at RB's house and get ready (take our bath at his house). Shawn's sister would fetch us to the train station, and from there...we're free. Skip school! XD

      I managed to finish my Econs paper in 35 minutes (8am-8.35am) when we were supposed to gather at the school canteen. Other than some calculations of some taxes which I didn't bother to think over much with, the entire paper is okay.  As I don't have a watch with me, I'll relate the events without the time =P Left school and headed straight for this particular company called InvenQjaya, situated at Putrajaya. It's a place to train scientists and invent stuffs; they have loads of patents to prove. The building itself (its interior) is almost futuristic. The lights are bluish, they have plasma screens covering every corner of the building... We were treated to a video of the company profile, and then a 3D animation (we got to wear the 3D specs that they had invented as well, something about them being made of poly-(something) film.  This guy Julian, who was one of the managers there and became our tour guide for my group A, has the most flawless English ever. Hardly noticed any grammatical mistakes when he spoke; his pronunciation is of the high-class English, pronouncing 'power' as 'parr'. Amazing. His vocab is wide (when I asked him a question regarding artificial light used in solar panels, he answered me, and used um, 'periodically', which I think none of us would ever consider using in their everyday speech. I think some might not know of the word at all >_>), and he retains a certain British accent. He articulates clearly.  Well, there goes a paragraph of praises. It's really interesting as a whole, as we learnt all sorts of new things related to chemistry, mostly. Potassium = Kalium (Malay word >_>), Sodium = Natrium (Malay).  After our one hour lunch at McDonald's at somewhere in Shah Alam, we went to The Star Hub at Bukit Kemuning, Shah Alam. It's a printing factory, and boy, the processes are most interesting; and we learnt how they actually get the information from the HQ/offices, how we living in Klang Valley  always  get the latest info if the info was sent in in time, while those residing in Johore and elsewhere would not get them.  Vinod, one of the workers at the PTC department was funny. He's amusing; he tried to answer each of our questions (shot mostly by the girls, especially Suet Li and Angela) and he answered sarcastically "obviously" to some of their questions XD He said that he regretted taking our group :P Said that ours was the most inquisitive, ask-a-lot group he had ever handled.  When we finished our tour around the factory, we had some refreshments. We were given a Galaxie issue, the one with  The Corrs  on the cover :D I was  shocked  to see so many such issues, but am happy =P Spread the love of The Corrs around! I heard a gasp behind me, and realized it's Chia Wern's. Turns out that she's a Corrs fan too :D Unbelievable. I've always thought The Corrs are under-rated in Malaysia...Even  kak  (Jess) said she's gonna buy Borrowed Heaven; she told me in the bus before we stepped down to the factory. :D And I was asked to burn a copy for some of them *sweats*  Reached school at 4.30pm. It was a most educational and fun-filled trip; loved the experience.

      Earlier we had the -eXodus- training session again, and I guess I kinda improved on my um, passing thanks to Jon's help last time, and Shawn's training advice this time. =P  Joe accidentally kicked the ball directly at Jon's head who was standing in front of him, his back facing him. With me not wearing specs at that time (at the power of 500 XD), I can still see that his head got knocked towards one side at the great impact :P His spectacles flew away, with both of his lenses. We managed to recover only one lens, so he's missing another. =/  Looks like there's bound to be some accident of some sort whenever we go for footie training >.>  Suet Li and Jess (and Shamin) were asking me to be the photographer for their prefect's dinner buffet at Sheraton Subang. o.O Only need to pay half the price though; Shawn's my photographer-partner :P I kinda guessed that Andy would want to come too and I was right XD As the half-price thingy's only limited to the both of us, Andy had to pay the full RM60, but Suet suggested that we can divide it between the three of us, so the three of us pays up RM40 each.

      Hehe, for some reason unbeknownst to me, after finishing my Add Maths homework ( Penyelesaian Segi Tiga ), I kinda hungered for more so I browsed through the dreaded Red Book, the Bible of Add Maths (published by Pelangi), and tried the non-routine question number 48.  Bleh, it took me approximately 157.5 minutes, equivalent to 2.625 hours >_> I asked for some help from May Wan (the incredible quiet girl who got the highest in the recent Add Maths exam, and first in class and form), and Suet Li. Eugene was too busy with his Moral essay but he promised to help me solve it after school.  Oh, and I still can't solve it. I got root 29 when the answer's root 37! >_<>most of us are here against our will  today. I like it lots, though it's explicit at certain parts of the book. I like his style of writing, how he conveys his message, how certain phrases he uses are delicate and subtle, that you have to have a vast amount of knowledge and experience to understand what he's talking about :P

      Ahem. Just for background info, -eXodus- was a given name to a football team that my friends and I started. (And no, don't ask me why the dashes and the capital X are used >_>.) Anyhow, we have the usual footie practice today, and we snapped lotsa pics (Shawn asked to bring camera >_>).  Anyhow, Matthew slipped and fell into the  longkang  when he and Heng Li were climbing up the drain (through a stairs metres away from school). The drain was our shortcut to get from RB's house to the school field :P  Nothing much in the football session, other than some session of pics. Azim found some bones, belonging to, presumably, a dead cat. He picked out all the bones using a stick, hunting for them to assemble them like a jigsaw puzzle >.>  When we were about to go back, Shawn, Heng Li and I had to jump down through the  longkang  as Matt and Azim took both Shawn's bike and mine respectively. Shawn, the big-sized one, somehow fell on his back when he jumped down, his left hand inside the dirty, murky (possibly full of shit, as he said he recalled seeing some floating >.>) water. His spectacles were   inside   the water too! XD LOLOLOL :P  And speaking of incidents of falling into the drain, Azim fell into the drain once too - while on the way back home using the drain-shortcut way with Matt. He hung onto a  dahan  to climb down, when it snapped and he fall body-first into the load of water. His Afro hair, his clothes, his pants, his shoes - completely soaked with  longkang  water! XD  Bleh. :P     Jon and Joel in the picture; this pic was snapped right after Jon kicked the ball.     Heng Li the goalie showing his cuts after saving a goal from Joe :P     Azim and his...cat bones >_>     Shawn before falling down into the drain. Too bad my camera ran out of memory space after snapping this pic >_

      The place that I stayed at - DutaVista - was um, quite weird. Tiny stairways and only about one elevator. The entire area wasn't that big but when I entered the room we were supposed to be staying...whoa, it's huge XD Probably the biggest I've ever stayed at of all the apartments/resorts/hotels I've been.  Not much I can say. Went to Bangsar Shopping Complex before we checked-in ('cause the management gotta get ready..etcetc), where Canny Ong was um, abducted from the parking lot =/ After dinner, went to Berjaya Times Square with my family...ate at Kenny Rogers. Walked around..that's about it. Bought Dik Cerdas comic vol 38.  Then the next morning (today), went to this..um, place (can't recall the name at the moment) with flea market. Then went to Ikano near 1 Utama. First time I've been there - I kinda like the place 'cause there are lots of walking space for you - despite not having as many shops as 1 Utama itself :P The good thing is, the shops over there are large - so lots of things to browse per se.  Meh. Many good pics I took were blur (they were mostly pics with poor lighting). Bah. Damn shaky hands. Damn camera.

      Just thought I'd mention this since it's too..uncanny XD Shawn, Heng Li, Jon and I arrived school late at the same time yesterday (about 7.30-7.35am). Once in a blue moon occurence :P  Finished doing my oral yesterday. I noticed that I feel less and less nervous compared to before...looks like I'm getting the hang of it :P My topic? "The Science of Attraction". I didn't really prepare much, just jot down notes...then talk semi-spontaneously :P  Going off for some..family vacation in KL tomorrow. I dunno, of all places in KL? But I don't feel like going so far now :P I'm staying there for only one night, while my parents are staying till Monday.  My favourite pic of Jay:    I like the little Russian girl in the photos. Matched the theme of the entire album perfectly.

      I cycled with Eugene Lee (who was using Shawn's bike) to the camera shop behind my house to collect the photographs I had them to print. Shawn's bike decided to fail on the way; the chains got entangled. My hands was completely black, palms, fingers, nails and all - it's like I soaked my hands into a bucket of tar. Even as of now while typing this, my fingers are still stained...it's darned hard to get them off.  Submitted two photographs - Ms Then was being completely flexible with the rules (seems like we don't need a scenery pic now?). I used the photo I had of Mei Ling's pink Nike Air (though it wasn't taken on that day) - Ms Then said I could submit that...although I think she didn't know that I didn't snap that on that particular day.  I  love  Jay Chou's photo shoots from his latest album. Very, very artistically done - I like especially the cover of his new album - him in his military uniform with the Russian girl. Here's a link to the image of the front cover:  urlLink http://www.alfamusic.com.tw/artists/jay/wallpapers/1024x768_05.jpg   Qi Li Xiang is a wonderful song. Nice lyrics. "qi li xiang de ming zi hen mei" - the name "Qi Li Xiang" is very beautiful. Joined the forums of jay-chou.net - seems like Kai Shen joined that too before :P

      Yesterday, Wai Hong didn't bring the key to our class which he found. So all of us (including teachers) have to go in through 4B and use the dividers of the class to go to our class XD Noteworthy I guess :P  My friends and I are a weird bunch. I've lots of pictures to prove below XD; take Afif and Sasi for instance. Afif had a rather long hair, and as rumours of a spotcheck were spreading around (partially started by yours truly >_>), he quickly asked Sasi to cut his hair (which Sasi managed to do almost perfectly). Turns out that there's no spotcheck for us yet >_>  Don't ask me about these pictures of inexplicable weirdness XD I don't know them!         Reminds me of Puss-in-Boots in Shrek 2 XD             Bought Jay Chow's latest album today at Summit - Vol 5 - Qi Li Xiang. Daniel and Geok Leng bought it yesterday, Andy collected his at Pyramid today...there goes the power of Jay over us >_> I didn't hesitate when I bought my RM46 disc - it comes along with a nice booklet of pictures and poster. There's also a VCD with two music videos as well.

      Watched I, Robot yesterday with Heng Li and Andy at Summit. It's a holiday for us due to the  Larian Mesra  thingy and I know I'm supposed to rest. I felt sick. I had flu and fever. :P And I brought along my black long-sleeved turtleneck shirt knowing that the cinema's gonna be real cold, which it was.   I, Robot  is an interesting show - I love plot twists and this show offers it. I love futuristic shows and this movie offered it as well XD Two hours well-spent. My rating? 9.5/10 :D  On a side note, Angel has a videoclip by itself now! (The Corrs' next single) Lovely, lovely, lovely :D Downloaded it off the Net, though it's not that clear.  Washed tents today with Jo Yee and Rebecca - Rebecca was initially reluctant. I had to go to Court 8 to bring both of them to my house. I can't really count on the other males within my group. In retrospect, I realized that girls are darned reliable and hardworking :P I thought that I could make it for the eXodus football training in school, guess I couldn't. Washed, dried and kept the tents nicely all within two hours.  Had to re-enact the tents to clean them. =/ A bit  mafan.  Cleaned from 3.40pm-5:40pm XD The training was from 4-6, but Jon later told me that they left at about 5:45pm. /swt  On another side note, Jon defeated me lots in GB. I had a series of bad luck >.

      Day 1, Friday - 30th July 2004  After spending some time at the computer lab, I went back home to prepare for the upcoming scout's camp. I rushed to school at 2.30pm, only to find it wasn't even ready yet. Pn Tuan Zainab (coordinator of the school mag) asked me if I knew Jon's number, and I said I didn't. I volunteered to go to his house and asked him to go to school because she needs certain files from the school mag which happened to be deleted off the main computer by someone. =/  It started to rain - oh phooey - and there we were at a dampy start of the scout's camp (helped by 61st troop from SM Subang Jaya).  Pasukan Kadet Bomba  held their camp with us as well, although our activities are separated. After dividing juniors (yours truly included, as I joined scouts last year) into their respective patrols, I was nominated to be the patrol leader by both Rebecca and Sheng Lim (seniors in my troop). I accepted the post (can't convince them otherwise anyway >_>), and on a quick glance through my fellow juniors (who are  years  longer), I thought Jo Yee would be the best bet (unsure of the spelling, purportedly to be the one Kai Shen likes but I'm sure it's just a teasing :P). She looks small in stature, but she seems very reliable, and able to take care of herself.  So, my patrol's appointed as Patrol Alpha, the rest being Beta, Charlie (ugh, watta name), Delta and Echo (I thought  Epsilon  best fits here, as it's a Greek letter as well but I didn't tell them of my suggestion >_>). Everything seems fine so far; we were given papers for our scout's tests/exam tomorrow, and were taught some scout songs. Then we headed off for dinner - rice with chicken and eggs mixed with some vege, plus some sausages. Ribena made by Suet Li was tasteless, and she blamed it on the lack of Ribena supplied to her XD :P (Felt some fever creeping up - didn't feel well ever since I stepped into the computer lab with its extremely cold air-con)  Next, there's that  Malam Kebudayaan . We weren't told at all that there's gonna be one and we had to prepare for it (although I roughly know few days back there's gonna be one, from what my classmates talked about - I didn't pay much attention to it). RB told us off why we didn't prepare after dinner, and I said flatly that we weren't told about this at all (I suppose SMSJ scouts were suppose to tell us about it).  So there goes last minute, spontaneous planning. After losing at the bomb game (again, first team to got kicked out), we were asked/forced to perform. Initial ideas about doing "She Bangs" aka William Hung failed 'cause we didn't know the lyrics well =/ So we had to do some rather lame-ass UTTERLY SPONTANEOUS sketch, with Rebecca as the narrator.  It's about some students camping around a fire when a long-haired ghostie appears (Jo Yee). At one point Rebecca said, "Then Clement said..." and she looked at me and I stared blankly at her. Her face read, "GO ON! SAY SOMETHING!!!" I curled my voice and said something right out of my head, " I think I just heard somethinggg... "  Said sketch lasted less than 2 minutes. Heh. Other sketches by other patrols were mediocre, some funny while some plain lame. Performance by my very own seniors were great, who sang some Chinese songs with RB and KS on the guitars. Sasi and Azim acted funny by sitting in front of the group while performing some weird dance moves. XD Sir Ivan Hoh taught us some nice songs, my all-time favourite being:   O - ale le,   Ale le chika boomba,   O ale o ale o alo a .  Sounds simple, but it's damn  chun , and I think it's a favourite even for my friends as well.  Finishing that, we had the  Upacara Lilin  (Candle Ceremony) and each of us lined up accordingly; Sir Ivan standing in front, Ryui Bynn behind him, the ten OCs behind RB, the patrol leaders standing behind the OCs with their patrol members behind them. We were to pass on the fire on the candles, and I thought that was most interesting.  Next up was  Burung Hantu , I think, though it hardly seems that way. I thought it would be the slightest bit creepy although I didn't think I would be scared sitting/standing alone in the middle of the  padang  blindfolded. We were to put our hands on the person in front's shoulders. We had to crawl, jump over imaginary  longkangs  (I assume), walk, walk and walk. I was pulled away from the line by one Chinese girl (from her voice, Su Lynn I guess) and was asked to turn myself 20 times, then repeat that by another 20 times again. It was weird rotating your body in complete darkness (being blindfolded and all), and at one point I felt as if the land had dipped into 45 degrees. /swt  Later I was left alone and after waiting for some time with no one approaching, I slept on the ground, with my back on the grass. Some people screamed at my ears (Daniel, by the voice), someone shrieking (Shawn). It wasn't at all frightening, in fact it's amusing - not until someone threw some rock on my stomach, and I scratched my elbow in the process of removing that sharp-jagged rock. =.="  Adrian Wong, patrol leader of Echo, was reported missing when we were rounded up (it all turns out that some scouters from SJ decided to punish the OCs for making too many mistakes, and by having them scolded by Sir Ivan). He was found later.  After this particular event (which was about 12.30am), I showered at the school's toilet with Ridzwan in the same cubicle. It was rather dark, the only light being some kinda electric lantern brought in by someone and I bathed in my boxers while Ridzwan in his briefs. It didn't occur to me that it was weird having two guys showering in the same cubicle half-naked until now, and I assure you nothing sexual crops up. XD (It all started with both of us rushing for the same cubicle, and I was fighting for it saying that "I came first!". Not sure who dared who to shower together, but I think it was Ridz. I agreed flatly - was too tired and dirty to care.) That cubicle couldn't be locked either, so we left it at that.  I couldn't sleep properly at all. Four guys (me, Khazwan, Bernard (Form 1) and Lee something-something (Form 1) squashed in a single tent. Those bloody idiots from the next tent (Beta's) kept making noises. I yelled at them to keep quiet from my tent, until I got up and walked towards the tent and talked to Thevadass, their patrol leader and asked them to keep their voices down. Yet, one persistent Form 1 idiot talked loudly about not being able to sleep in such a squashed condition (ironic) and about the Adrian Wong incident. Heh.  I guess I slept at roughly 1am-1.30am.  Day 2, Saturday - 31st July 2004  Woke up at 5am to yells of "IT'S RAINING!!!". God, I kept all the shoes inside the tent - my mistake is leaving the zip of the flaps of the entrance halfway 'cause I didn't think the rain would be that heavy. And to our utter discomfort (and me pissed off), rain started to seep through our so-called waterproof tent. Amazing how waterproof it can get >_> We spent the entire hour trying to dry the floor of the tent, but we gave up. I volunteered to get out in Khazwan's raincoat and used some tied-up plastic bags to cover the top of the tent to minimize the leakage. Some of my things were wet - my colour pencils rightfully became water colours.  At about 6am, we got up to eat breakfast (two pieces of bread and some and clean ourselves a bit (I didn't take my bath, knowing that we'll be sweaty later). After running around the school for 5 rounds, and did some stretching exercises, we were off to prepare for our tests. I didn't quite look forward to the tests before I came here, but I realize that it's pretty much fun too - all the rush to pass the tests, the  penguji  asking us questions that we knew would come up (when we asked our fellow scouts who passed XD), and there are many occasions when the  pengujis  would give hints - some subtly, some in-your-face.  I passed every single test without being asked to repeat it (except for my  dua simpul  knot - other knot stations were cancelled as we supposedly didn't learn yet). We were given up to 12pm or something to complete every station's test, my final one being  Sejarah Pengakap Malaysia . This guy was damned  cheong hei , talking nonsensically and asking questions like it was a gameshow, ala Who Wants to be a Millionaire? (even giving me his so-called  tiga talian: talian pertama - tanya saya. Talian kedua - tanya Shaun  [from SJ ], talian ketiga - pilih satu muka surat daripada buku untuk dibaca  [turns out I have to ask for that particular page that I want without looking at it >. -  but I guess in a way I felt that it was fun, since he wasn't that strict :P He speaks Bahasa in a  baku  way XD  Lunch commenced, next up was inspection. I didn't see a point to this, but we had to take out every single item from our bag and lay it out for the scouters to check, underwears and all (arranged from head-related items to feet-related items). I put my towel at where my pants were, and they said it was wrong. By their logic, we hold towels in our hands. Cool. So I had to don the towel around my waist for making that supposed "mistake". I felt slightly embarassed, but I didn't show it outwardly.  We have our theory test next (a written exam). Easy I suppose, except for the parts where you had to draw the logo (I referred to the badge on my pocket XD) and  ikatan buku sila . That's about it.  After that, Patrol Alpha followed Jason of SMSJ (there was only three of us - me, Jo Yee and that F1 Lee kid) who was supposed to teach us knots. He did them all expertly, explained like a real, good teacher would but he went a bit too fast I guess (as I had already practised by knots before lunch after I completed by tests early, I found them easy :P). The pessimistic me who winced about knots now actually find them easy! (except for  simpul manuk,  which till now I can't tie onto a  tiang  - only pens =/)  I was his first victim - which was what he called me. I did all pretty fine, except for some questions on the English or BM names, and the uses. Jo Yee did fine as well, all except for that F1 kid (I could've slapped him out of frustration for his unable-to-comply-to-instructions way).  Next came the most awaited event of all...  Halangan Komando ! We changed into our PJ clothes - and our first obstacle was to crawl across wet, muddy grass with our faces 2 centimetres above ground. Not too bad XD Then we had to walk on a thick pipe with water splashing onto our bodies as a distraction (I did it without a clinch :D). Up comes the next  halangan : crawling in mud water. The right side of my stomach/waist got cut by some rock - I think almost everyone got some kind of cuts from that particular rock as well. Boo for not checking the obstacle properly before releasing it to other scouts.  My clothes changed colour to a mud brown, and ah - to our utmost surprise, out came Ivan Hoh, bastardized version of the devil - yelling at the SJ guys - calling them stupid fools, useless, and other colourful adjectives. We had to cease every activity immediately, and I didn't even had the chance to climb the rope! Fuck.  I experienced what I call utter dissatisfaction when all five patrol leaders had to do 10 push-ups due to mistakes not related to ours. Ivan Hoh was yelling for the patrol leaders and counted "1, 2, 3..." and our patrol members went as well. "I ASKED YOU TO FIND THE OTHER PATROL LEADER AND DID NOT ASK YOU TO CALL YOUR PETROL MEMBERS AS WELL!" I wanted to object rebelliously, but he didn't hear me and continued on with his incessant yellings (which I think would be better to keep my mouth shut - he roared at me when I corrected him that we don't have a fucking QM in our patrols).  My patrol was assigned to clean up the so-called "activity area", that being the  tapak perhimpunan  and  ruang legar . A senior in blue shirt stood watch, yelling as well (more due to being pressured by Ivan). 20 push-ups followed when we didn't clean well enough (um, hello? There are only like 4 members in my patrol and we had to cover a large area in a short amount of time? What the fuck is that kinda injustice?). "Didn't you learn how to  arahkan  your patrol?" yelled Mr Blue-Shirt-Guy. "No, we didn't." He shut up after that.  Poor Adrian was yelled at several times for making mistakes when trying to report. That bloody fucker didn't teach us reporting yet, and we were supposed to make reports. Okay, logical. Being the last one who was called out to report, I learnt from other patrol leaders' mistakes.  It ended about 6 something pm after  upacara penutup . I had to bring back two tents - luckily Jo Yee was staying at Court 9 and Rebecca at Court 8 which was near my house; they would help me out to clean the tents. Apparently F1 kid Lee stayed at USJ 14/1H (WH's row o_O), but I don't think I'll be calling him >_> Well, maybe I will when I feel like it.  I think it was near 7pm when I stayed back a bit, sipping the tea provided and munching on some biscuits (come to think of it, I barely drank anything since lunch). Azim wanted to borrow my bike to go back to his house for a short while, and I consented - lending him my entire bunch of keys as well.  I helped around moving tables, and I did mostly tying up banners together with Azim (and searched together with Dass for his missing log book =/). I thought that we could go home after the camp, but apparently not so as my "seniors" (I'm older than most of them where age is concerned XD) had to build a gadget for the  Larian Mesra  commencing the next day.  We spent till 10pm something with the banners and all, with Pn Vasantha staying back as well. I was tired - physically, mentally - damn tired that I felt my muscles, my everything would drop down dead. It's hard to explain, but I assure you that I've never felt that tired before - it was a strain physically and mentally like an invisible rubber band stretched to its maximum. I felt as if I was at that maximum point, about to break down.  Auntie Wendy came along (I think Pn Vasantha called her). That was when I realized that Azim lost my keys - he told me maybe it was at his house. Auntie Wendy  belanja -ed us at Maju-Maju and said in Cantonese, "Eat what you want!" The 8 of us gobbled down on our dinner/supper; she was being most generous - she brought out a plateful of chicken when we didn't ask for it, and ordered the drinks to be large (I kept my kiwi drink 'small'). My head was giving me a whirl, I didn't have the mood to eat - after Azim revealed that my keys might be missing when he cycled back to his house (my bike was left at the school guard's hands).  Pn Vasantha fetched some of us home, while Auntie Wendy  tumpang  me, Sasi, Azim, and Wai Hong. Sasi was the first to go home, next I drop by at Azim's house with him and realized that my keys were really missing. I felt slightly pissed - both at myself and him but at that time I was too tired to care. I thought that I'd find it early morning the next day.  Three plastic bags not belonging to me were left at Auntie Wendy's car boot - I had to bring them back to my house. I felt sick, felt tired. I didn't even feel like using the leg massager my parents recently bought (earlier while setting up the gadget, Shawn massaged WH's leg and WH said he felt soo much better. I wanted Shawn to massage me immediately after that, but then he asked to use the leg massager I had so skeptically dismissed - that it would really work wonders. Azim said, " Ish, aku ni sekarang pun rasa nak guna   massager  tu la,"  after listening to the massaging tales.)  After showering, I tuned in to The Corrs' Borrowed Heaven album, set the Sleep mode and flopped onto my bed. It felt so much better. 4 hours of sleep and hours of strenous work. My bed was my heaven.  Today (Sunday) - 1st August 2004  Woke up at 6 something, Azim phoned me saying he found my keys inside his file. Yay ^.^ I slept back for about 15 minutes, before waking up and eat my breakfast while using the massager. My poor legs felt better. I arrived late at 7:15am at school only to find that the  perbarisan  was over - I stood next to Shawn who was commanding and followed his final instruction -  keluar baris ! XD  I wore by brand-new Nike Air Max Turbulence, it felt sooo comfy and light that when I put that pair into my bag, I felt like I was carrying nothing. The  Larian Mesra  run was supposedly 7km, but when I ran it didn't feel like 7km, unlike previous years' SJ10K runs. I twisted my ankle a little when I accidentally slipped my leg into the tiny drain-hole. I can't catch up with WH, I felt too tired. Kai Shen ran past me.  I rested at several intervals, and went past Ramesh - our  olahragawan ! I felt proud of it XD although I understand that Ramesh is only exceptionally good at short-distance runs. I got number 13, and I felt it was an achievement 'cause I thought I'd lose (I even planned on just walking and enjoy the walk, 'cause I thought winning it was impossible). I think it's mainly due to many students were not there or even running.  That's about it. I got so close at lucky draw - my number being B4101 while Daniel, whose number was B4102 got it >.<>_>).  I suppose this is my longest blog post ever, writing from 6:29 pm (while chatting to Heng Li and other people), ate my dinner then continue it till now, 9:12 pm. The title says it all, I'm fucking tired. XD
