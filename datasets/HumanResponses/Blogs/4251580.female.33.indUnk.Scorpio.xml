       Today is just another day in the neighborhood...I am sitting here at home on my last day of freedom before I start a new job and I have to watch my boyfriend's son all day. My kids are at the sitter but I still have to watch his son. How fun for me...at least he isn't fighting with me today which is unusual. Tell me if this isn't weird...I have a daughter who was born on Sept 9, 1995. I meet this guy who has a son who was born Sept 8, 1995. We end up staying together and we all live together now and here we have two kids that are a day apart. Talk about some major sibling rivalry and they aren't really even siblings.       The boy, he thinks that because he is a day older that he is "in charge" of everything that they do which really pisses off my daughter...you know how women like to be in control of everything. He can be a little shit too...mouthy and disrespectful when something doesn't go his way or if he is confronted with something he did wrong. I don't understand why an 8 year old child thinks he needs to be disrespectful to an adult and then be able to get away with it.      Not that my kids are perfect but they certainly don't disrespect adults...they know I would be on their case if they did. I am having some problems with my older daughter tho...she for some reason over the last 3 months or so can not sleep all of a sudden. She can't get to sleep then when she does get to sleep she doesn't stay asleep and she seems to think that she should come in and wake me up every single night and keep me awake for hours on end. I don't know what her problem is and I can't handle this lack of sleep any more. I need to have my 8 hours or I am one grumpy b*t*h!! I even went to the pharmacy to ask the pharmacist about something I could give her to help her get to sleep and would help her to sleep through the night...I got her some Simply Sleep...I think it helped her to fall asleep but she still woke me up to tell me she couldn't get back to sleep. I had to threaten to not let her go to the Fair and to this amusement park this week to get her to go back to bed...she starts school again soon and I don't know what I am going to do to get her to go to bed at night........I dread it!!!    I think that's it for now...I'm trying to avoid someone who keeps calling me but she won't give up!  If I'm away from the phone I can't hear it ringing right??  I know it's terrible but I don't want to hang out with her today...I said I wanted a peaceful day...right!!

       Well, since this is my first posting I guess I'll start off with a little bit about myself...I am a 33 year old divorced female, mother of two beautiful daughters whom I'm very proud of and plan to talk a lot about on here. I have been divorced for a little over a year now and am thankful that I am no longer married to my ex much less to anyone else. I am however attached to a wonderful man who shares similar views on marriage that I do so he knows that I am in no rush to get married again any time soon.      I was recently fired from a job I held for almost a year...Never in my life been fired from a job...Not even when I was a teenager. And to top it all off I was fired by a man who had been my friend for at least 15 years. Not to mention that he practically begged me to work for him in the first place. He wasn't even my boss at the time he fired me..How this all happened is beyond me but at any rate I am unemployed trying to support my 2 daughters and looking for a new job. I am really trying to keep positive about the things that have happened in the last 3-5 years of my life but sometimes it gets a little hard so I figured I would use this blog to vent my frustrations and concerns...Hopefully it helps!      I have always been one to write my feelings on paper and had journals when I was growing up. I loved to go back and read them all later and see what mischief I was up to. My mom ended up throwing my older ones away and for some reason my ex seemed to think it was OK for him to read my ones later in life. Even tho I explained to him time and again that it was just a place to "vent" he took everything personally and I finally gave up on keeping a journal. Well now I'm back and hopefully I can keep up on this! For now I have to get dinner going so I will write more later.
