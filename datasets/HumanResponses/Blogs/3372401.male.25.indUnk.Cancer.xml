      I hate people who use chopsticks to eat Chinese food. They are the lowest form of human on earth. And don’t give that “when in Rome” bullshit. You don’t dress up like a long shore man when I go to Red Lobster. Using chopsticks to eat Chinese food is like drinking unpasturised milk, archaic and stupid. “But Shurs, some people get a sense of accomplishment from mastering chopsticks.” Then buy a fucking puzzle, the one with the big pieces, because completing that is as much of an accomplishment as “mastering” chopsticks.

      Is there anything uglier than seeing a girl wearing a baseball cap? They even make a goddess like Britney Spears look like a the trailer trash she would be if she didn’t have a mom who was ready from the earliest age to exploit her. Baseball caps are for baseball players, black men, cancer patients and people at sporting events. That’s it, that’s the complete list of times they are cool. Caps are like Hot Girl Camouflage. Once the cap is on a beautiful girl blends in with the ugliness of humanity. Stars wear them so they won’t get recognized in public. I’ve asked girls why they wear hats and the answer is almost always; “I looked like crap so I threw this on.” Well I hate to break it to you but now you look worse. Put some work into your look, as a female that is all you have.

      The Massachusetts Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, causing outrage in conservative pockets around the country. What do I think of gay marriage? I don’t care. In my opinion there are a lot more palatable issues to be concerned with over a slip of paper given to gay couples.   President Bush issued a statement saying: “The sacred institution of marriage should not be redefined by a few activist judges.” So in the President’s opinion, marriage is too important for Supreme Court Judges to making a ruling on but the office of President isn’t? Ron Crews, former president of the Massachusetts Family Institute said that the ruling “...says marriage has been redefined and devalued.” Poor guy, it must be hard to go home and look your wife (if you can still call her that) in the  face knowing that gay guys and gals share a title that you two do. And I have no doubt that Evangelicals will be going even more crazy then usual, predicting that this is the last straw that means the end of the world will happen very soon. But you know what? People have always thought the end of the world was just around the corner. It’s a good way to scare people into living the life you want them to live.  My advice to everyone is to mind their own business. The same conservative Christians who complain that it’s nobody’s business if their kids pray in school (and IMO it’s not, unless they make a spectacle out of it) are the ones who are butting their hypocritical noses into this issue. Yes, the Bible says that being gay is bad, but it also condemns many things that “Born Again” Christians do as well. They just choose to ignore them, or skew their meanings essentially wrapping their faith around their lives as opposed to wrapping their lives around their faith. I’ll get to that stuff another time though.  I encourage all gay couples to go to Massachusetts, get married and stay there. We should give the state to them like we gave Israel to the Jews. Think about it, this would allow them a place they could be safe and live their lives the way they want to. And with no straight men left in the state we wouldn’t have to hear their constant whining about the curse of the Bambino. Everybody wins.

      1-For making your ex- husband go to rehab for sex addiction. Is it possible to rehabilitate being a frigid cunt?  2-For your Oscar acceptance speech in which you talked about what it is to be a black woman even though your mom is white and your dad didn’t raise you.  3-For making out with Fred Durst in a music video.  4-For acting like you want to advance the craft of acting, then making super hero movies.  5-For calling the cops when you found me masturbating while sniffing your shampoo.

      I read an article in the newspaper today about how because LaToya London got voted out of American Idol on Wednesday night that it must be due to racism. Surely someone as talented as London should have been in the final two over less polished singers like Jasmine Trias or Diana DeGarmo, the article stated. So is this were racism is in the 20th century? Do Klansmen sit around watching Fox on Tuesday nights in their hoods waiting for the two hour voting window just to stick it to the black race? I don't think so. I think it goes deeper than that. I think America hates black women.  But it's not just white America that hates black women. Even black men don't like them. Look around. How often do you see black men with black women? Almost never. Black men, rich and poor alike love white women. Either as a trophy of their success or as someone to pay their bills for them. Can you name one black woman who is universally loved across all races? Well let's take a look.  Beyonce Knowles- Her momma is white.  Halle Berry- White mom.  Whitney Houston- It worked for a while until the "real" her came out.  Oprah- Well if housewives count for all of America...  Conservatives rail rappers for degrading women by calling them bitches in their songs but if I grew up in a neighborhood full of black women that would be the only way to explain them. Black women have horrible attitudes, they hate everyone. They hate white women for stealing their men, they hate white men because they keep the brothas down, they hate Latinos because they can dance just as well as they can, they hate Asians because they can do long division. Maybe if they stopped hating people so much, softened their edges and did something that the world could enjoy maybe they could get the public to like them, as their male counterparts have been doing for decades. Think about it for a second, during the civil rights movement who was a better representation of the race, Muhammed Ali an affable, funny guy who entertained? Or Rosa Parks, a bitch who complained about her seat on the bus? I'll take Ali and like America did all those years ago.  So did America kick off LaToya and vote Fantasia second to last because they were black? I don't think so. I think that instead of voting for women who have developed bitchy attitudes without earning the right to have them, they voted for people that they thought were nice. After all black bitches are a dime a dozen nowadays, which is about what they cost in the 1700's.

      Audrey Seiler was a student at The University of Wisconsin in Madison. As the news reports touted when she was believed to be kidnapped, she was a 4.0 student. Well it’s a good thing she didn’t take Kidnapping Yourself 101 because she would have failed that course badly. Here is a short Cliff’s Notes version of how to kidnap yourself:  Lesson 1- If you plan on kidnapping yourself don’t look up wooded areas and five day forecasts on your laptop computer.   Lesson 2- If you plan on kidnapping yourself don’t put the items you contend that the kidnapper used and put them on your credit card.  Lesson 3- To establish that you are actually kidnapped, don’t let yourself be seen by other people for the duration of the kidnapping.  Lesson 4- Once you are “rescued”, blame a black guy.  Lesson 5- Once you are “rescued”, don’t change your story to the police, and don’t tell the guy you were stalking that you were sexually abused when you told the police that you weren’t.  This dumb bitch faked her own kidnapping to get the attention of a boy who she obsessed over, breaking into his Email account and reading his messages, she learned about a girl he had contact with. So instead of fucking one of his best friends like a normal girl would, she decides the best way to get attention would be to act like she was kidnapped. Will she get in trouble for doing this? Probably not, she was taken to a mental hospital and will probably get out of her crime like most women do, by batting her eyelashes, showing some cleavage and saying “Oops my bad”. I say for her punishment we should go old school and brand her forehead with the letter C so everyone forever know how much of a cunt she is. She’ll probably get a book deal out of it. If she needs any help with book titles I’m here to help, here are a few.  “I’m An Insecure Pile of Dog Shit: The Audrey Seiler Story  “Men Are From Mars, I’m An Attention Whore: By Audrey Seiler  “I’m Too Much of a Coward To Kill Myself: Audrey Seiler’s Journey  “Why Won’t You Love Me? Is It Because I Am Psychotic?: Audrey Seiler

      There is a show that is on MTV called “I Want a Famous Face” the show chronicles young men and women who go under the knife to look like their favorite celebrities. These people are douche bags. The first episode was about a pair of twins that wanted to look like Brad Pitt. One of the twins, pre-op, decided to tell a girl he was friends with that he wanted to be more than friends, on camera because we all know that the best chance one has to get a girl that’s out of your league is to do it on TV. Not surprisingly she said she didn’t do “the boyfriend thing”. Which translates into “I put up with you because you pay for everything but there is no way I’d bang you, but don’t mistake that as me not wanting you to continue to pay for everything.” It was pathetic.   So the guys go under the knife, but not before saying Brad Pitt’s name about a thousand times. It was like an episode of Queer as Folk but only slightly more gay. They get the surgery and to their surprise it hurts during the recovery portion of it. Poor ugly babies. While they were healing, MTV cuts to “The other side” which is meant to be a deterrent to plastic surgery which is funny because watching these idiots is deterrent enough for me. The “Other Side” is a clip of a guy who was so inspired by Ryan Phillipe’s performance in the screen classic I Know What You Did Last Summer and by his latent homosexual attraction to Phillipe that he went under the knife to attempt to look like him. Well the surgery messed up his face and despite him not having any acting experience he couldn’t find work. Poor Closet Case. Back to the twins, they take off their bandages to reveal... that they look nothing like Brad Pitt. They look freakish instead of ugly now so I guess that’s an improvement. They’re taking acting classes too so one day, look for them in the Gay Porn section costarring in Meet Joe’s Back Side or Legends of My Balls.  I’m not against plastic surgery as I, like all men like a big titty woman, but to think that a plastic surgeon is going to turn you from Nosferatu into Brad Pitt is as stupid as thinking that looking like a famous person is the same as being a famous person. Do something with your life and if you have talent at it, you too can be famous, and even Steve Buscemi can get laid so don’t worry about how you look.

      The 5 times it’s acceptable to wear a tank top. 1- You play professional basketball 2- You play college basketball 3- You play high school basketball 4- You’re getting a blow job from your sister 5- You’re at a wedding reception in Wisconsin  Those are the only occasions that tank tops are anything but horrible.

      Fat people piss me off, and not just because they get to the spare ribs before I do at OCB. No it goes deeper than that. Fat people think that they suffer from an illness and the world is against them. They blame the media for idealizing skinny women. They say that obesity is an illness, that they can’t control themselves. Like there’s a little voice inside their head that tells them they have to eat more. What a lame excuse for being a disgusting pig. There’s a little voice inside my head that tells me to strangle women while I’m having sex with them but I show restraint, and rarely choke bitches, unless they ask for it.  The problem with these fat women is that most of the time they don’t think they’re really fat. Sure they complain about being too big but that’s just so some kind sap will tell them they aren’t. So just so there is no doubting whether a woman is fat or not here’s my helpful guide, it’s simple really:  If you weigh 150 lbs or more and are shorter than 7 foot tall, you are fat.   It’s that simple. Sure there are guys that will tell you that you’re not but those guys just want to get a blow job out of it. The only reason men are nice to fat women is because they want money from them, they want want to seem nice to their non- disgusting friends, they are priming them up for when they are really desperate or they are in a frat. That’s about it.  So when you go to Hardees and order 3 thick burgers and extra large fries that Diet Coke that you ordered isn’t gonna do anything for you.

      I’m sick of people playing guitar in public. You know what I’m talking about. You’re outside enjoying the weather when some hippie starts playing a bad rendition of Stairway to Heaven on an acoustic guitar. I know that you started playing guitar so you could get laid and I applaud that, but don’t ruin my day trying to impress the ladies. You don’t hear me loudly complimenting women on their shoes while you’re trying to read your book. Want a tip of how to make it big in the music industry? Stop playing guitar in front of me. Let’s take a look at some of rock’s greatest guitar players and see what common element they all share.  Jimi Hendrix- Never played guitar in front of me Pete Townsend- Never played guitar in front of me, but we did download kiddy porn together. Keith Richards- Never played guitar in front of me. Billy Corgan- Never played guitar in front of me. Santana- Never played guitar in front of me, but I did buy oranges from him at a stop light once.  Do you see a pattern forming here? I do, stop annoying me with bad cover songs you cock sucker.

      Dear Kelly Osbourne,  You are a fat no talent hack. If your father wasn't famous you'd be sucking cock for ham sandwiches. I heard you checked into rehab because you had a pill popping problem. It's a safe guess you weren't abusing Trimspa. I sympathize with your plight. I mean if my parents were filthy and rich, I gained fame off of the exploitation of my zombie like father, was given a record contract because I did a bad cover of a Madonna song, was handed everything in life, became a star for being a rag and had cankles, I'd need to abuse drugs as well.  Maybe you should just end it all. You're gonna be fighting the demons for the rest of your life. I'll even help you out by writing a suicide note for you. Here goes:       I, Kelly Osbourne can no longer go on. I'm a mess physically and mentally. I'm fat and ugly. I have no talent whatsoever. Life is so unfair. I wanted a Hummer H2 for completing rehab but Mum got me a Lexus SUV instead. My album was horrible, my live performances were even worse. I can't stand the cameras from the show around all the time, but I had to sign up for another season because I have no talents other than being annoying and sweating. I've never had a boyfriend that hasn't used me for either money or fame. This isn't the first time that I've thought about killing myself. I tried to hang myself last week, but I'm so fat that the rope snapped when I dropped off of the bed. I was gonna try again but I got hungry so I went down to the kitchen and ate a box of twinkies and a newborn baby's soul. But I'll press on and figure out a way to get this done somehow. I don't know what else to say.... It's better to burn out then to fade away... Mom, Dad I'll miss you... Ronald McDonald I'll miss you too...  There you go Kelly, you're handed something else in life. It's fitting isn't it.

      I am so sick of all of these Truth commercials that dominate TV. Kids that think they are clever because they are telling people that cigarettes can give you cancer, whining bitches complaining that their fathers died of lung cancer and blaming "big tobacco" for it. Maybe they should blame the dipshits who didn't read the Surgeon General's warning on the side of every pack of smokes. They should be clubbed in their stupid heads, media whores that they are.   Cigarettes can kill you, as can too much red meat, sex without a condom, and a whole bunch of stuff that makes life worth living. If you live in fear of the fun stuff are you really alive? I think not. That is the truth according to Shurs.
