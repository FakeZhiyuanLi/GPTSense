       Last night was great and im sorry if i spell something wrong b/c i dont really feel good and im really really tired so yeah umm so far im ok i slept a couple hours but when i was waiting for my mother to pick me up i was sitting up right in a couch and i fell asleep about 4 times them my mum came in and woke me up so yeah last night rocked for more then one reason reasons not in order     i got to hang out with all my friend     i got to see hayden yes i know he is one of my friends but its&nbsp; n/m     we had a very sweet talk in which the younger ones of the group got into and some people understand how great of a feeling that is to see even the really young ones sit down and talk about Jesus     there was Food (forgot meds though so it was limited darn-it)    and i got no sleep     there are prolly more but until im all the way awake good luck getting them out of me      Jim gave me some verses to read b/c i was to be batized ( i dont think i spelled that right)      Romans 9     Acts 2:14-41    Acts 22:1-21     im gonna read those here in a little bit when i can see everything but i guess im done writing and i will talk back to you later    Never Forget The Jesus Died so We could Go to HEAVEN...

       well about 3 or 4 hours ago kass stopped by to see how i was doing and to pick up some of her stuff and i kinda got up set b/c shes doing thing with charli that i know she would not do so im so lost but other then that i got to see her little sister nessa and i miss her like KRAZY lol but any who if you can tell haydens not home im really bored and tired and i have posted more then 2 times in one day one all my sites i have posted at least once gezz lol hayden come home gezz well this one is on my xanga site to  urlLink www.xanga.com/usko8182  but here it is again    Girl: Slow down. Im scared.   Guy: No this is fun.   Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!   Guy: Then tell me you love me.   Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down!   Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.   -  =Girl hugs him=-   Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me.    &nbsp;  (In the paper the next day)   A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only one survived.The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy had realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live, even though it meant that he would die.If there's anyone you love this much on here or in real life, re-post this.    &nbsp;  you all should know the reason for me posting this but i do also thinks its really sad and the guy is some like the one im with i think and i love him so much

      Standing in the middle of a cloud  Chains hooking your hands and feet Falling straight down  Because of the cloud you can not tell when you might hit bottom  The pain of lost is the problem  It’s pulling you down  The pain of abandonment is dragging you down A chain for each member remains on each limb  No free hands to reach to god Your pulling your hands up as hard as possible  But  You lose your strength  Because they have slammed a door in your face  No matter what you do  These chains squeeze tighter and tighter around your wrist and ankles Blood starts to trickle down  At first you see this white cloud start to turn red  Then all of a sudden its pure red  No matter what you do you cant get free Your strength continues to be drained you know you must fight  But with what strength PRAYING TO GOD  Lord Almighty HELP ME  He already knows what you speak of  And for a split second you have hope a sun-ray shines through the dense cloud But it’s quickly lost and you repeat this
