      I brought them both home with me this evening. (Technically last night, since it is now well past midnight.)  Pippi was waiting for me in the children's section of my local Big Chain bookstore. I had sat at the kiddie table to flip through Ed Emberley's drawing books. Pippi caught my eye from a discarded stack of books across the table, when I paused to sip my Starbucks coffee. I loved her when I was a kid, and my hand automatically reached out for her cheery face on the book's cover.  I had forgotten she is the strongest girl in the world, has her own house, and is an orphan. Just like ME! I'm tempted to dye my (graying) hair red, but I'll compromise by wearing pig tails now and then.  Pippi had me reminiscing past joys, so I sprung for a compilation CD of Kitaro's music from the 70s and 80s. I've lusted for that album since a boyfriend played the cassette version in his truck for me, at his farm in Grand Forks, North Dakota, in 1988. We discussed romance to Kitaro's pulsing accompaniment. The music stayed with me, the boyfriend didn't, thank goodness.  Better go beddie-bye before I spill too much information here.  Love ya, Pippi.

      With the death of my brother last month, I have no immediate family. I had been trying to call him, to wish him Happy Easter and Birthday in April, then to see how he was in May. I kept leaving messages.  Not until that day in May that a nurse called to tell me he had died a few hours earlier, did I know he had moved twice this year. I try not to be angry...&quot;If only someone had called me back to let me know he had moved, I could have talked to him one last time....&quot; I immediately got on a plane and flew to where he was. I buried him near my parents. That’s about all I have the emotional stamina to say about it tonight.  With his death all my immediate family are gone.  So for a while I holed up. I read, wrote, and wallowed. It makes no sense to me that I should be w/o family at such a young age. I've done everything right as a loyal and compassionte being, and it's no joke that most people who meet me like me. I like people too, hence my profile, &quot;loner who likes people.&quot; (More on that in a future post.)  And as I've learned well, each time there is death near me, a friend or two or three, will drop from the radar. I've had enough practice not to take this personally. Meanwhile, others have stepped forward in unexpected support and generosity. The last two afternoons I was treated to coffee and chat by new acquaintances. I doubt these will become serious friendships, but I am glad to learn once again that when some fall away, either in death or because they don't want to be around a person who is hurting, there are many angels willing to step in.  I almost gave up again. I decided to become a hermit, far beyond my usual loner self. Yet that pebble of courage that always grinds into my heel when I take a step kept prodding me. For a week, at least, I'm trying to play in the friendship game again.  A funny part of my coffee dates with these two women was that I listened to them talk about their love lives. Hearing their joys and sorrows, and offering ideas as asked, made me feel alive and hopeful; for love, even lost love, is the breath of life. We talked little of my situation. For me, that was a relief; a mental vacation. I told them so.  My life is changing. I have always been a loner. I want to be different than I've been in that regard, but I think the programming is hard wired. I prefer it.  This book perks me up when I start telling people off in my mind for what my emotional center registers as abandonment:  Anyway: The Paradoxical Commandments:  Finding Personal Meaning in a Crazy World   by Kent M. Keith  People will leave in various ways. I'm a true friend anyway. Others stay, and love me no matter how life turns. I am grateful.

      Privately owned SpaceShipOne completed a manned flight 62.5 miles above earth, then landed in the Mojave Desert.  I hope that one day, I'll be able to fly into space. In the same way I take a plane to Europe, I'll take a flight far above Earth.  People have laughed at me when I've said this. Maybe after today, they'll realize my hope ain't all pie in the sky.  As of this writing, Google News is posting over 1000 articles from around the world on the success of SpaceShipOne:  urlLink  SpaceShipOne News   It's only a matter of time until we can buy tickets for a private rocket ride.

       Dear Dad ,  I'd prefer to be enjoying a barbeque, and chocolate cake for dessert, rather than feeling sad you aren't here. I believe in the afterlife, I sense you watching over me in your way...I hear you laughing your silly laugh and saying, &quot;Be happy, Baby Girl. Don't worry about me!&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You suffered a lot with heart disease, cancer and other illnesses. You had looked so forward to age 65 so you could get your Social Security and still work part time without being penalized. But Death had other ideas, and took you in your 65th year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I miss you every day. I saw families laughing and smiling today and wondered, &quot;Why can't that be me? Why do I have to be an orphan at such a young age?&quot; There's no answer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'll follow your advice, and continue to live the happiest life I know how. I went to church, then out to lunch with those people. After that I made a bowl for the Empty Bowls charity event this Fall. I've never worked clay, didn't know about rolling it, smoothing, molding, trim and medalions. I had a lot of fun; I made something in one afternoon. I told the other people, &quot;I wish writing a novel was this fast!&quot; LOL.   I love you .  P.S. I found this website:  urlLink HALO &nbsp;

       Google Ogling   Find photos, art, book pages, and more    See photos of female serial killers  The other night I watched the movie “Monster”. The Oscar-winning film, released last year, was based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a serial killer in Florida in the 80s and 90s.  What does this have to do with Google? Photos of Aileen. Her famous, chilling, brown-eyed stare was captured by actor Charlize Theron in the movie, and it was  scary . Wanting to know if the effect was movie magic, or real life, I looked up Wuornos on Google.  After reading several articles on her, I clicked the Images feature just above the search text. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Take a look:  urlLink   Brown Eyes      See Rome and Die  Who said that? I’ll have to search later. But Aileen inspired me to remember the quote. Really though, want to see all manner of photos of the Eternal City—everything from Bubba’s vacation to pro shots for tourist publications? Type “Rome” (quotes not needed) in Google’s search box, click Images above the box, and pages of photos of ruins and rocks from various decades, maps, old documents, and happy cappuccino drinkers are yours to ogle. Take a look:  urlLink  Rome     Ogle for the Dead  That’s not for me, but I suppose if you searched Jack the Ripper, you’d see shots of Mary Kelly, his most gruesome kill.  My brother died suddenly last month, which is why I haven’t been here in a while. A friend told me after I’d buried my brother, that it’s now possible to arrange everything via the Internet. I told my friend, “No way, there are laws and agencies….” He explained a friend of his who was terminally ill paid in advance for it all, and it was “dirt cheap” (pardon pun) to the tune of $600 USD, including picking up the body. As I’d just paid thousands, I found the idea appealing. I’ll leave it to you to search for that one, and I don’t recommend looking for images. Unless they are of “Happy Acres”.   Ogle and Goggle with Google  So many images, so little time. To add to your viewing and surfing pleasure, click the Images item on your usual searches. Along with the textual information, you’ll gain a visual. I just typed in “Tuxedo Cat” and I can tell you none of those cats are as cute as my darling. I better get busy with the digital camera.  If you’re in the mood to surf, search for “goggle” images. Wild.  Note: Rarely, clicking Images doesn’t execute the search, and you have to click Search after clicking Images.   Coming soon: Touching, dancing, and playing lab rat with Google .

      My best friend in Spain, Xavi Terns Mas, has been chatting with me. He inspired me to get busy and start my own Blog. I wonder if that's because he hopes I'll chat less with him while he's working, and I should be sleeping? He's 9 hours ahead of me in Spain, and just beginning his work day about the time my night-owl brain comes wide awake.  Here's his blog: http://xaviternsmas.blogspot.com/  The photo of him was taken when he and his family visited me during Christmas holidays.  Enough for now. Let me see how to doctor this blog interface.

      I met Joy (not her real name) recently in the writing workshop I facilitate. She e-mailed the following today:  Hey Sharon,  Wow!  I really enjoyed exploring your website.  Pippi...Gosh, I recall reading about her during my youth.  It is comforting to meet intelligent and "balanced" people in our town.    I am speechless with respect to your family situation.  A loner, yet a people person intrigues me.  I am similar in some ways with your environment.  Virgoans enjoy their privacy.  Home is a sanctuary or temple for a majority of Virgoans I have met in my lifetime.  Your talents in the Art world will introduce you to numerous individuals who have liked minds as yours.  Music is your friend.  What I suggest for you is to embrace and seek those outside of your world.  It is comforting to be with people who enjoy your presence.  Keep in touch! Joy

      Today's mail held a large envelope from The White House. Inside was a certificate signed by George Bush, President of the United States:  "The United States of America honors the memory of (my brother). This certificate is awarded by a grateful nation in recognition of devoted and selfless consecration to the service of our country in the Armed Forces of the United States."  I have been surprised how quickly the gov't has taken care of details pertaining to my brother's death in May. I find myself wondering if this is because we're at war. Also, I didn't know family members got these certificates--we didn't get one for my dad, that I recall or have found in the family papers, but he didn't die in a military facility, so perhaps that's the difference.  I am thinking prayerfully of other families who have lost relations, and get these certificates. It is so sad to get mail for dead people.  I never thought I'd be without family at such a young age. Time to write!  I have a great life, despite the losses. Missing my family compels me to live fully.
