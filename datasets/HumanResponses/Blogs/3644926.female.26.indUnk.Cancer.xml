      Hi! Welcome to my blog! My big plan is to share photos and what's going on with Lillian. A little late, I know. I'd meant to keep a journal but never got around to it, and then Duyen suggested I do something like this so she could keep tabs on Lilli when Duyen's at grad school. So here it is. Sometimes, you might think, why the heck do I care about that? Why would anyone but the kid's mother (or father) care about that???! And that's because I care about it! A lot of this is just for me to keep some sort of record and not feel that Lilli's little babyhood is passing away at lightning speed! That's another good reason to put it in this form. I have been writing little update emails to people, with a picture attached, but then people are forced to have large photos in their inboxes (very annoying, i know, for those who have small inboxes) and perhaps read stuff they don't care about. Parents sometimes can't distinguish between what's annoying and what's endearing when it comes to being proud of their own children. This way, if you care, you can periodically check in to this site. ok? ok! No pressure! And for those of you who do want to put in input, you are welcome to do so. Thanks! Love, Mariko

      I have been pooped on and puked on so many times in the last month. If someone had told me I would be exposed to so much puke and poop, I might have thought twice about this whole business. But it's weird how you sort of get used to it and it doesn't gross you out anymore. I remember when my Grandma used to come over to when we were little and had hamsters and a guinea pig, and she would just pick up their poop like it was nothing and I would be so grossed out. Now I get it. What's so gross about hamster poop? All they eat is hay and seeds and stuff. And all Lilli's eating is milk. After you've raised a few kids, a little poop is nothin'!! But I have had some incredible poop/puke experiences (hey, how many times do you think I can write poop and/or puke in one post?). Like when Lilli was only a couple weeks old she had this incredibly explosive poop. Unfortunately, at the time, I had her diaper off and her butt was pointed at the wall. That yellow, mustardy, seedy poop shot across the room onto the floor and across the chair and hit that wall that must have been about five feet away. And here comes, Atticus, ready to do cleanup on Aisle 5!! Why do dogs like poop? But that is a whole different post. And then the puke. The puke is enough to make someone a nervous wreck, because you never know when it's coming. It'll be smooth sailing for a good day or two and then out of nowhere it's like poltergeist. And usually it's all over me, down my bra, sometimes down my pants, and I have to change all my clothes and Lilli's too. And clean the couch. That's a fun thing to have to do at 3am when you're dead ass tired. Not that it's any fun for her either. Although maybe she was secretly laughing inside that time I'd put her to bed next to me, my face next to hers, and I was almost almost almost in a well deserved slumber when I was rudely awakened by hot milky puke all over my face. Mmmmm. Then you have to change all the sheets too! Fun! I did end up taking Lilli to the doctor because I was afraid she was sick or had acid reflux. Doctor said it could be acid reflux but if she was gaining weight well (which she has. . .almost three ounces a day!) then it wasn't a problem and we could wait to see if it got better. Maybe I am overfeeding in my neurotic fear of starving her.

      Another instance my sleep psychosis craziness. All who know me know that I am deathly afraid of spiders. Well, one night, as I was putting Lilli to sleep by having her on my chest I began to doze off myself. In my half sleep, I thought I saw a HUGE SPIDER making it's way over the lip of the comforter and starting to crawl onto Lilli's back. In utter panic I flung back the covers, rolled over so that Lilli was on her back next to me (at least I was aware that Lilli was on top of me!), and started to run out of bed to turn on the lights, all the while screaming at the top of my lungs. Bob, awakened by my screaming and feeling that I was getting out of bed, mistakenly thought that there was a stranger in the house pulling me out of bed. So while I was screaming, desperate to get out of the spider ridden bed, Bob was screaming (like a girl, I might add :)) and holding onto me, desperate to pull me away from the hideous stranger trying to steal me away. My desperation being stronger than his, I finally managed to pull away and get the light on, when we finally both realized how silly we were, and managed to stop screaming. All the while, there was Lilli laying in bed, eyes wide but not making a peep! Bob said he's never been so scared in his life, but. . . why in the world would he assume that the reason I was getting out of bed, albeit screaming, was that there was a weirdo pulling me away? It's not like that is a common occurence :) Oh well, we can laugh now. . .Bob is afraid I will transfer my spider fear onto Lilli. . .

       urlLink    Our first outing away from Lilli was to go Christmas shopping!  Both Bob and I felt it was such a waste to spend such precious time at the mall. Lilli was still taking a bottle at that point though so she did pretty well, plus she got to spend some quality time with Grandpa and Grandma.

      The first two weeks of Lilli's life were so exhilarating, and at the same time so utterly exhausting. She was having a really hard time breastfeeding at first, and so we had to go get an industrial grade breast pump and feed her by bottle. No one has really suffered ultimate humiliation until you have been hooked up to a double electric breast pump and sucked dry. You just have to sit there helpless holding those suction cups to your boobies, at the mercy of anyone who wants to come in and laugh at you. Bob had a good laugh, let me tell you. But what we had to do was, we had to try and let her breastfeed, which was so frustrating at first, and then give up and pump. And while I was pumping, Bob would try to feed her. If he didn't get much down her, then I would try while he washed up all the pump parts. And so on repeated every two and a half hours or so. Its really enough to turn anyone pretty psychotic when you combine that with complete sleep deprivation. I look back at pictures of me from this time and I kind of look like a zombie. A happy zombie, though.   Plus, the first week she was really jaundiced, as you can see from her Thanksgiving picture. Appropriately, she was yellow as a pumpkin! This was not only worrisome, but it made her really sleepy. Everytime we wanted her to eat, breast or bottle, she's tend to fall asleep. In fact, she was typical in that when we wanted her to eat she'd sleep and when we wanted her to sleep, she wouldn't! I basically had to get used to sleeping with her in the crook of my arm.  But anyway, all that work payed off, because after several trips to the lactation consultant she eventually figured out the eating thing. After a week and half we didn't use the pump at all anymore. And eventually she got better at sleeping at night too, and not being so sleepy during the day, especially after the jaundice wore off. It's weird to think that I used to look at her and worry that she was so skinny! Maybe I was a little neurotic about being afraid of her starving and so I made sure she ate whenever she wanted. Anywho, you can see that she had no problem putting on weight. But really, this period was a test of our sanity!

      Just wanted to remember for myself a funny thing that happened when Lilli was only a week old or so. I was still trying to get her to sleep in the bassinet sometimes, (which I have since largely given up) but also had her sleeping with us too. I woke up in the middle of the night, and saw through my foggy vision that Lillian was sleeping soundly. Then my eyes cleared a bit and I realized that what I had thought was the baby was actually part of the blanket. I woke Bob up screaming, "Where's the baby???" and was frantically searching for her under the covers when a terrified Bob finally figured out that she was in the bassinet. See. . .look what sleep deprivation psychosis can do to you.

      I finally feel like she knows who I am. She just kind of has that look in her eye, like she recognizes me when she sees me. It's very validating. Makes all the sleepness nights and days spent nursing feel worth it. And while it's not very nice of me, sometimes it makes me feel kind of validated that she *sometimes* these days won't let other people hold her right away. She'll just start crying, HARD, but'll stop as soon as I take her back. Then she'll let them hold her when she's used to the person. It sometimes makes things more difficult, but. . .what can I say? I can't help but feel kind of glad that she's smart enough to tell who I am and likes me best!

      This day, being Valentine's Day, Bob and I figured we deserved some time to ourselves. The last time before this that'd we left Lilli with a babysitter was for Bob's birthday when she stayed one evening with my parents and the next evening with Bob's mom and Michael. She'd done pretty well both times, so we had big plans. We planned to go to dinner in Seattle and then even see a movie. A three and a half hour movie nonetheless! Ambitious, let me tell you! Because we called forty five minutes in, before we'd even gotten to the restaurant, and Lilli was not a happy camper. She was screaming her little head off and sending all my parents guests away (ok, so my grandma and her friends). My mom finally got her to go to sleep on her chest (I will have to post a picture of my mom utilizing this technique) and my dad was very relieved. So Bob and I ended up having a nice dinner but foregoing the movie. I think we managed to do a little shopping but we finally had to head home. Oh well, really, I was just happy to put on some clothes that weren't sweats!

She weighed in at 17 pounds 11 ounces and twentysix and three quarter inches long, which is in the 99th percentile. She is the size of an average six and a half month old!! Dr. Grossman, however, said that she isn't fat, just big. This means she will probably end up being a tall person. We shall see :) In the mean time, my arms are getting very strong.   She didn't like her shots one bit but fell asleep in the car and I am taking this opportunity to eat lunch before she wakes up really mad!

      For the longest time Lilli has seemed to me to be a kind of larva. A very cute and delightful larva, but completely dependent on me for everything and not doing much in the way of purposeful movement. But today, as though she'd had some kind of an epiphany, she just kind of reached out and tried to grab one of the toys in her gym. Up to now, she'd just kind of stared at them, and sometimes swiped them when she was flailing about. But now a new era of purposeful reaching has begun!

      Here is an email I sent: Dear friends and family, Lilli is now six months! We can't believe the time has gone by so quickly, but there it is. Time goes and before we know it she'll be sixteen!! Eek! But before we get ahead of ourselves, we wanted to let you know how Lilli is doing.    She had her checkup on Monday and is now. . . 21 pounds, 28 1/4" tall, and has a 17" circumference head. She is quite a bit of baby to lug around. It's amazing how much babies change between four and six months. Since my last update to you all, she has started to say "mama" and "dada" (though not with much purpose, admittedly), sits up all by herself, eats cereal and sweet potatoes, plays with all her toys and tries to put them all in her mouth, including her own toes, and has two teeth!  Two months ago I don't think she was even reaching for her toys.

      While at Lummi Island with our friends Lance and Matt, we noticed that Lilli's bottom front teeth were just starting to break through her gums. No wonder she's been so drooly! It hasn't been much of a plus for the breastfeeding though. She'll bite down on me real hard, and then when I say "ouch" she pulls off and smiles really big. Little rascal. I try to tell her it's not funny but so far she's not listening.

      When she's upset she does the cutest things lately with her mouth. It used to be when she was about to cry, she's stick out her bottom lip in a little pout and it was so *CLASSIC*. Sometimes she'd do it in her sleep and it would just make me laugh in the middle of the night (which was very needed). Well, so that was cute, but now she's stopped doing that and instead kind of sticks her tongue between her gums and makes this pathetic little "muh muh muh" sound with her lips all pursed together.  In a related cuteness observation, she has moved the pouty lower lip to the eating department. Often times when I feed her something, like yogurt, before she swallows it she'll just kind of let it sit in there and she'll stick out her lip and have such a set little jaw and it is just so darn cute! I did take a picture of it, but not a digital one, so maybe I will have to scan it in. It's not a sad face, because the rest of her face isn't sad, so much as a determined face. *sigh* Sometimes I wonder what she's thinking!

      I've been having such morbid thoughts lately. I hate to even voice it, but I'm kind of of the superstitious nature that if you voice something, it won't happen. Well, anyway, whenever I leave Lilli alone for even a second, I keep having these terrible visions of what could happen while I'm away, and that I'll come back to some terrible tragedy. A friend of a friend of ours' baby died at ten months in some terrible accident in his crib, and I'm not exactly sure of the circumstances, but I really want to know in order to do the exact opposite. Can you imagine??? Well, I can, unfortunately. So everytime I leave her in her crib I wonder, maybe they left their baby with a block in the crib too, and he fell back on it and hit his head. . .or on and on and on. And everytime I come back and she smiles up at me I breathe a sigh of relief.  I think having children makes you emotionally vulnerable in a way nothing else ever can. They bring so much joy into your life (cliche I know), but they also have the potential to bring so much pain into it. I mean, it is inconceivable to me now to live my life without Lillian in it. I mean, before Lilli, I probably could have at least survived any horrible thing that happened to me or someone I loved. But if something happened to Lilli? I really don't know what would happen. . .She's my Achilles heel. Anyway, sorry for the silly overdramatic musings. I'm sure every parent thinks these things at some point, and some poor souls actually have to endure the reality. Ugh. . .I will try to move on to happier thoughts. . .

      We went to the Mariners game on Monday night. Lilli's first baseball game! She was actually really good and enjoyed looking around at the people. And I'm pretty good at breastfeeding in public these days, so she had some snacks too. Plus she enjoys being outdoors. So actually Lilli and I had a pretty analogous experience. Except I wish I could have had a little nap too! And when she started to get fussy towards the end, that pretty accurately reflected my thoughts exactly! But it was fun. We saw a streaker so we had to cover Lilli's eyes. One funny thing that did happen was that Duyen and Jeannie got some garlic fries, which Bob hates, and they were sitting together in exile to eat them. When they were done, they passed what was left down the aisle for Ian and James to try and Bob was in the middle with Lilli in his lap. Well, lickety split Lilli had a fistful of pungent garlic and potato in her tight little grasp and then she promptly dumped it all over Bob. ha ha ha ha! Well, nothing a diaper wipe couldn't cure. It's really handy having those with you all the time!

      We just got back yesterday from a trip to Spokane for Hoopfest. Not only do you have to take along a crapload of stuff when you have a baby, but a normally 4 1/2 hour trip turns into a six hour trip. Actually, she was pretty good. She had a nap, then awake time, then she got sick of it, then we had a break, then she got sick of being in the car again but kind of fussed herself to sleep. So not too bad. That was on the way there. On the way back I90 was closed because of an accident and we basically were parked on the freeway for over an hour. This during her precious nap/happy time! So on the way back it took us almost eight hours. Can you believe it? Halfway up the pass she decided she just couldn't take it anymore. Usually she might fuss and complain, but she's not really crying. Well, this was crying, no mistaking it. She just cried her little heart out, hiccoughing with tears streaming down her cheeks, for about three minutes, and then she hiccoughed herself to sleep, poor thing. By the time we got to an exit she was fast asleep so we just kept driving, hoping we'd make it home before she woke up.  She had a pretty good time at the festival though. Besides watching her daddy play basketball, she got to scope out the baby competition. There were soooo many babies there. Big babies, little babies, happy babies, cranky babies. Babies, babies, babies!! So that part was fun. I told Bob that next year it's my turn and we'll be going to the World Knitting and Spinning convention and he can watch me card wool or something for a weekend. whee!

      Our friend Ian arrived yesterday from Halifax and Lilli has been mystified by his presence. She just STARED at him yesterday like she'd never seen a Canadian before. Honestly, one time she stared at him yesterday for about three minutes. She had her head craned back in order to look at him too. This morning she stared at him some more like, "are you still here?" She won't smile either. She's very stoic about it. Ian's very nice about it and just stares back. I wonder what's going through her little head sometimes, honestly.

      I realized today too while looking through my posts and practicing my revisionist history, that all the pictures are from my side of the family. Well, that's because I'm too lazy to scan in all my regular film pictures into the computer so I've just posted digital pictures, and my dad is the one doing most of the digital photography. I do have tons and tons, as I'm sure you can believe, of regular pictures taken with my good ol' camera and that others have taken too. They are all semi neatly organized in albums, and I would of course be happy to sit you down and show them all to you if you ever happen to come visit!

      Today I noticed for the first time that Lilli will put her arms up for you when you go to pick her up. It's probably the first time she's shown obvious understanding of something usually leading to something else and her taking an active role in that. It's like she's actually a little person capable of thought and reasoning! Okay, maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves.   Hey, have you ever noticed that moms often speak using the royal "we" as though to take credit for everything their child is doing? Like, "we've been playing with our blocks all day today." I totally notice myself doing it all the time and hope other people aren't annoyed. Maybe it's just me who does it. I'm trying to stop.

      I left Lillian for the first time in months today with Mary so that I could go strawberry picking. It was SO HOT and there were so many women there with their children (will I be one of those women one day?!) and the tractor trolley was broken and it took FOREVER. And when I got home there was poor Lilli having finally fallen asleep after a half hour of hard crying doing those little pathetic post cry hiccups in her sleep. I felt SO BAD. GUILT!!! So, I swore I'd never leave her for that long again which puts a damper on Bob's plans for a date night. oh well. I just don't think I could enjoy myself knowing she was sobbing her little eyes out wondering where I was and thinking I'd abandoned her.   (For the record, Mary is an excellent babysitter. Lilli just has a little separation anxiety).

      Bob just got home today after NINE WHOLE DAYS at a conference in Toronto for work. It gave me a whole new appreciation for the good work that single parents do. I think Bob was glad to see us too. (of course!!) We survived it though! But it was really hard, especially with Atticus demanding a lot of attention too. It sucks when the baby decides to be especially hungry one night and wake up three times and then the dog wakes you up at 4 am just as you fall asleep. Sucky! I'm glad Bob has dog duty again.

      Lilli is enjoying her new teeth. She has discovered that she has all these little hard things in her mouth and she can rub them together. It is the most AWFUL sound you can imagine: teeth grinding together. And little baby teeth at that! But she finds it fascinating. I guess I would too if all of a sudden I had hard things in my mouth where before I just had soft little gums.  She has been a little talker all day today. Just nonstop chatter. And she's been standing a lot and bobbleheading and doing her other little normal Lilli things :) Not too much excitement. I did a lot of house cleaning today which she wasn't too fond of. She doesn't really like the vacuum cleaner. Addy doesn't either. He goes and hides.  I read a letter yesterday from a friend of a friend who has a one year old baby. I don't want to be critical of anyone else's joy in their baby, but I somehow hope that I don't sound like that in this website. It was just so. . . unobjective .  Everything was so happy and the baby was so cute and BLAH BLAH BLAH. I was kind of bored. So I hope you don't get all bored with me. Seriously, please comment if you do. If I say that Lilli is so cute one too many times, please tell me so. Of course, the only people who read this are my grandma and my dad and Bob's mom and they all think Lilli is the cat's pajamas so I probably won't have any objectors to my saying Lilli is cute.

I thought she just had her upper teeth coming in but she also has more bottom teeth coming in. Four at once! No wonder there is so much drool! She's&nbsp;a tad bit fussier than usual, and slept a little more today, but other than that seems fine. Progression is exciting, but I'm not sure how I feel about more teeth. . .

      Just wanted to let you know, it's best to read a blog from the bottom up because things get posted in that order. That means the most recent entries are at the top (conveniently) but that if I write a few entries at once, they may seem backward to you (inconveniently). So if you read them from the bottom entries first, things will often make more sense.

      There's so much to catch up on! One week goes by and Lilli's like&nbsp;a whole new baby! Cindy and Michael's friend Craig asked me (while Lilli was on my lap), "hey! where's your baby?" and I was like, "huh?" but then he said, "that's not your baby!" And he's right. She's a totally different person almost from week to week. Anyway, that's my way of warning you that this may be a rather long entry. Nothing happened for awhile and then we got busy and then we spent the whole weekend at Bob's family's cabin at Timberlake. . . So now I have to play catch up.  To begin, new teeth are arriving! I've been thinking that forevers, but today we are finally able to see the little white things poking through her upper gums. I'm not sure how I feel about it actually. Now there will be teeth attacking my poor nipples from both sides :( But I must bow to the inevitable. . .  She's been busy in that mouth though. She's figuring out all sorts of new stuff. Her newest and funniest trick is sticking out her tongue. It is so funny to see her stubby little tongue poking out of there and the funny faces she makes to go along with it. She usually does it when she's laughing or amused or concentrating. She is just so fascinated with herself. She's also making a lot more noises. She's figuring out "jya" and "vvvv" and all the vibraty noises she can make. In general she likes noise though. There is nothing better than two hard things banging together. Especially in a restaurant.  And, she's been interested in mirrors for awhile but now she truly seems to get it that that's her in there. She'll try to sneak up on herself by peering up into the mirror and then she'll get closer and closer until she's nose to nose and then she'll kiss herself. Like I've said NUMEROUS TIMES, it's so interesting to see her figuring stuff out. And it's wonderful to see the simple innocent wonderment in her face at the simplest things. At Cindy's this weekend though, she was really confused by a picture of herself. She kept cocking her head at it and stared and stared and moved her head some more and nothing happened! I think she expected the Lilli in the picture to mimic the really Lilli, like a mirror, and couldn't figure it out!  Tonight before bed she figured out that she could fall backwards on purpose and that that was pretty fun stuff. She'd just tilt back and start to smile and look at us like "here I go!" and then fall back and laugh and laugh. She did that quite a few times before she got tired of that game. She's also getting a lot closer to crawling I think. She's managing to scoot on her bottom but if I put her in a crawling position she'll rock quite a bit and sometimes get her arms moving. But she just can't figure out the knees. One thing she CAN do though is get to a sitting position from all fours. And she's getting better and better at pulling herself to a stand.  ANYWHO, we had a&nbsp; fun time at Timberlake and Lilli got spend a lot of time naked in the shade on the grass. Good for her rash. And she loves to pull grass.  Oh, one last thing. Her cute new expression is when she's all excited she puts both arms up really fast and screws up her face and lets out this little shriek. SO CUTE. Ok, guess that's enough for now.

      She's been so cute today. (Don't I say that everyday?) She keeps trying to climb up my legs and get in my lap. Halfway up though she gets kind of stuck and gives me this really funny look and I have to help her the rest of the&nbsp;way.&nbsp;I wonder if she's been wanting to do that for awhile now, but now just has more control over her body as is better able to communicate her desires? hmmmm.  We also took her to the doctor today for a persistent diaper rash. It started small over a week ago but has gotten progressively worse, until now there are these red bumpy patches and little satellite pustules. mmmm, satellite pustules. Anyway, turns out it was&nbsp;a yeast rash so we got a prescription so hopefully now it will get better. I plan to let her crawl around outside naked tomorrow if the weather is good.

      We had a  very  exciting day today. Oh yes. We went to Costco. I always end up spending way way more than I intend whenever I go there. Basically, I went there to get diapers and batteries (48 AA's for 10.99!!). So how did I end up buying a huge pack of gouda&nbsp;cheese and a queen sheet set? We don't even use&nbsp;flat sheets!&nbsp;That is the mystery and curse of Costco. Of course, I also couldn't resist buying Lilli some more clothes and toys. Just what she needed. Anyway, Lilli enjoyed it up to a point. She's funny, she'll only take so long of being in a stroller or shopping cart. Then she gets fussy and I have to put her in the sling which she enjoys. Maybe it's the walking motion. Anyway, I thought she was sucking my hand but it turns out she'd fallen asleep and her head was all wonky and there was drool all down my arm. Which poses the question: how come when I want her to go to sleep in a nice comfy bed sometimes she won't when she'll just go to sleep in any old position otherwise? &nbsp; I've also been continuing trying to get her to crawl. She's&nbsp;getting pretty good at going from a crawling position back to sitting, but going from sitting to all fours is still very awkward for her. Usually she lunges forward and ends up on her belly, but she looks as though she's not quite sure what just happened. She's so cute now though when I'm sitting on the couch and she's on the floor and she lunges for my leg and then tries to crawl up me to get up on the couch with me. Yesterday she was REALLY cute. We were all sitting on the bed and Lilli was half standing, half sitting&nbsp;against Bob's legs. She was really happy and bouncy and I put my arms out and said "come to Mama" and she just lunged towards me with all the trust in the world and the biggest smile on her face.&nbsp; It was so cute that Bob said, "hey, let her come to me now!" and so I set her up in a similar position and Bob put his arms out. Well, she wouldn't lunge and Bob was crestfallen. Maybe it was a one time deal. So he took her again and I put my arms out and, well, she lunged. Very sad Bob. I tried to explain to him that it's just part of babies, that they like their mamas more at first. After all, I have the boobies, and she spends the majority of her time with me. He was hard to convince though.&nbsp; I also tried to tell him that babies tend to like better the parent who changes their diaper more often. I don't think he bought that though. Ha ha. &nbsp; Oh, in other big big news, we got Replay TV. (Thanks mom and dad). It's basically the same thing as Tivo. Anyway, now this means that we don't have to miss any important TV (such as the Real World) because we have to put the baby to bed or something like that. Whee! Let the new era begin!

      Well, I took Lilli to American Idol tonight. It's not exactly my idea of a fun way to spend two and a half hours with an almost eight month old, but there it is, he convinced me to go. His argument was partly based on the fact that our friends Kurt and Jo were supposedly taking their baby as well, but guess what? They got a babysitter! Probably what I should have done as well, but Lilli is still not really into being away from me yet. So off we went. Besides the fact that its horrible going anywhere its crowded when you have a twenty three pound baby strapped to you and the encompanying luggage, I couldn't find my seat due to the idiocy of a few ushers and was all stressed out about being late. Finally, all sweaty, I found my seat and Lilli and I settled in ok, before the music started at EAR PIERCING LEVELS. I knew that it would be loud, but we'd gone to the ice show and I had assumed the music would be about the same. But I was wrong. This was much much much much louder. Diana DeGarmo may have sounded good on tv but in person she reminded me of a shrieking banshee. Sorry. I tried to stuff cotton in Lilli's ears but it kept coming out and I kept having to stuff it back in, which probably bothered her more than the actual loudness. She actually did incredibly well. She enjoyed watching all the lights and she had a few (liquid)&nbsp;meals and jumped about quite a lot. At one point I think she was actually bouncing and kind of dancing in time to the music. Maybe we have a musical/dancing prodigy on our hands! And she was charming everyone around us with her bobble head. The guy behind her was totally cracking her up too. I couldn't hear her laugh but I could feel her little body convulsing with giggles. Anyway, we are home now and she is in bed, thank goodness. I was afraid she might have ringing in her ears and be fussy but she seemed fine. Maybe next time I should take cotton for my ears. &nbsp; But in general she was very happy and good natured during the whole thing. Actually, lately she has just been a happy giggly baby all the time. She is laughing a lot more and just seems like she's made&nbsp;a quantum leap towards being a really real little person. It's just so weird to me! I can hardly remember what it was like when she wasn't so interactive. And everywhere we go people tell me how adorably cute she is. I try not to let this go to my head. Afterall, it's not merit based or anything. It's not like the better people get the cuter babies. But nonetheless, she is cute. I could overhear people in the crowd tonight saying, hey, look at that cute baby! :) And at Starbucks today, I didn't even have her with me, and the girl told me that last time I'd come in with her they'd all thought she was so cute and talked about her for a long time. Bob thinks she was just trying to get a bigger tip. Well, it worked! Those Starbucks baristas are no dummies.

      She's been so funny today that I've noticed especially how many little expressions she has. And it really brings home to me how much of a little person she is now, with thoughts and feelings and everything! And MOODS! It's so weird! Anyway, she can look grumpy, and happy, and perplexed, and frustrated.&nbsp; Sometimes she's silly and sometimes she's serious.&nbsp; Cindy and Michael came over and she just LOVED playing peekaboo and one thing I noticed is that she can anticipate things now. Like, Cindy kept putting the cloth over her head and pretty soon she figured out that that cloth was coming and she'd put her little hands out before it could get there and think that she was just so smart and she'd laugh and laugh. I've noticed that too when I'm tickling her. I'll start at her toes and slowly walk my fingers up until I get to her armpit and then tickle her there and after I've done it a few times she starts laughing when I get to her tummy. Gosh, babies can be so much fun. Sometimes I didn't think so when I was nursing for the fourth time in a night at 5:30 in the morning. &nbsp; She was doing something really unusual at Bob's grandparents too. Bob had brought his basketball and she was playing with it by patting it and rolling it. Well, suddenly she gave this shudder like she'd gotten a chill and she made the funniest face like she'd eaten something horribly sour. And she kept doing it! Over and over! It was so weird! I don't know if it was the texture of the ball or what but it was definitely giving her the heeby jeebies. Finally, Cindy couldn't stand it anymore and she made us take the ball away :)&nbsp; Then she took a poop (Lilli did, not Cindy!). She has the funniest poop faces. I can't even really describe them but they are intense looks of inwardly focused concentration. Her face turns all red and she does this little half smile.&nbsp; I'll have to try to get a picture someday before she's too old and embarrassed by it. &nbsp; Anyway, it seems that some of my entries are too long to be enticing to my readers, so I'm trying to shorten them up. There's just so much to get down in writing before all of sudden she's like sixteen!

      She was a craaazy girl when I tried to put her to bed tonight. She kept bringing her legs up to her chest and then smashing them down on the bed, and sometimes on my legs. ouch!! But then she grabbed hold of her feet and started clapping the soles of them together like it was the most charming thing in the world. Then, when she was finally half asleep, I kept trying to sneak away but everytime she would flail about for her lost booby. (It's kind of funny: her mouth is all open wide and searching about and she rolls her face into the bed, hoping its where the boob is hiding, and her arms are reaching out for me. Actually, it's kind of pathetic and makes me feel guilty.) Finally I just had to let her do her "When Harry Met Sally" moans and she fell asleep.

      She's being awfully silly today :) She keeps doing this funny little thing with her head. If she's playing there and I'm not looking right at her but she wants my attention she'll cock her head to one side and peer at me with this goofy smile on her face. Then when I look at her she'll laugh and smile and move her head back and forth, not unlike a bobblehead. It's like she's trying to get me to laugh. Naturally I do because it is so funny looking and then she looks very pleased with herself.    We went shopping today too, and I took her in the sling, which she absolutely LOVES. I've tried the stroller but she often demands the sling.  But even in the sling, she likes to check to make sure I'm still there. She'll crane her little head around and up and look at my face and smile really big and then look back around at the big wide world. She rarely makes a peep when I have her in the sling. I tried to cart her around in it today while I picked up around the house, but it's hard to bend over with a twenty pound weight attached to your hip.  In other big developmental news, I had her seated on the floor playing with her toys while I was reading on the couch when suddenly I looked over and there she was tugging at my sleeve. She must have scooted about a foot and a half on her bottom. I didn't observe her doing it and it must have been kind of a gradual process for me not to have noticed it but there she was, trying to stand and getting ticked off that I wasn't helping her. Once I had her standing she wanted to get up on the couch with me. She is such the little cuddler and so she spent a good fifteen to thirty minutes bouncing on my tummy (ugh. . .the twenty pounds!). But anything to make her happy :)

      We spent a rather quiet day today trying to recover from our busy weekend. We did our usual: playing, sleeping, and eating. As promised, we spent some time outside today, though it was just in the back yard. Bob picked up the poop yesterday so we could safely spend some time there without coming in smelling like poop ourselves. She LOVES being outside although I have to keep a constant eye on her as she will try to eat anything. She got mad because I took away a nasty old leaf she was sucking on.  I think she's getting better with the pre crawling as well. Now she uses her feet to get her butt up in the air but then she can't figure out how to move forward by just advancing one foot and arm at a time. So she gets frustrated and gives up and lands flat on her belly and just lays there looking disconsolate.  AND, now she's being proactive with the arm "pick me up" signal. Before she'd mostly do it when someone went to pick her up, but now if she wants to be picked up she'll put her arms up first. Like today, she was in her little exersaucer thing and Bob was sitting in the chair next to her and patted his arm and grunted and put her arms out to him. He was very pleased she wanted her daddy. :)  Now, AMAZINGLY, she has gone to bed early and so Bob and I can watch Road Rules without being afraid of permanently skewing her forming little mind towards a love for reality tv (of which we are a little bit ashamed :)) I was pretty ticked at Atticus today for twice waking her up from naps, but I may have him to thank for her being tired now. . .

      My birthday was the 10th and, appropriately, we had a birthday extravaganza leading up to it :) This meant a lot of parties but we (meaning Lilli) survived. I think she's relieved it's all over, though she'd never tell me because she wouldn't want to hurt my feelings :) Anyway, she was a very good girl through it all. She got passed around a lot, and mostly was very patient about it. One thing I noticed though was that now when someone else is holding her and she wants me she'll stretch her arms out towards me and arch her whole little body in my direction. But then if I don't act on it fast, OUTRAGE.  Friday I went shopping with Duyen for awhile (Bob threw me a surprise party, and Duyen was the decoy) and we intended to get manicures but instead I was distracted by Gymboree and we ended up spending all out time there. That's what happens when you become a mother! I bought her the CUTEST set of overalls (on sale) and I wanted the whole ensemble but it would have cost a fortune. That didn't stop another mother at the counter with an eight month old who was wearing the whole getup: pants, shirt, socks, cardigan sweater and I'm guessing she had the matching hat in the bag there somewhere. AND, the mother was buying a whole counterful of new clothes! But, this little baby was even bigger than Lilli which was kind of a relief actually. 24 pounds! I think Lilli has actually kind of plateaued. She looks decidedly leaner these days. Anyway, later at the party when I was showing off Lilli's new overalls, Sonja reflected on how times have changed when the topic of animated conversation is Gymboree. There were three little babies at the party. Yes, times have changed.  THEN, Saturday night we went to Sonja's cabin on Camano where she was the only little baby. That was interesting for me because circumstances have REALLY changed since the last time a bunch of us went up there. Boy. For one, Bob and I were not together although we were both there. There were a lot of other differences, but the past is the past :) Those who were there, they know :)  When we got home Lilli was pooped out but somehow she was having trouble falling asleep. I'd think she was asleep and I'd try to sneak out but she'd start tossing and turning and making moaning noises. If you've ever seen "When Harry Met Sally" she kind of made those noises like Harry made when he couldn't sleep and was depressed. When he'd just lay there and moan. Finally I left the room but she moaned for another five minutes or so without realizing I was gone and then fell asleep. I was very amused, probably mostly because I kept thinking about "When Harry Met Sally."  On a related note, I've been meaning to tell how darn cute she is when she wakes up before Bob and I have gone to bed and I go check on her. She just smiles and smiles and is so happy to see me and if I lie down next to her she immediately puts her arms out to me and rolls towards me and usually promptly falls back asleep.   I can't believe summer is almost halfway gone. I had all these ideas about taking Lilli to the park everyday and we've gone, like, twice. We'll have to go tomorrow. . .

      We are entering a new era in which Lilli is fascinated by little, tiny, chokable things. (eek!) Over the weekend she really liked the metal buttons on Mary's jacket. She would stare intently and then slowly reach out her index finger to touch it, and then try to grab hold of it with her finger and thumb. The baby books call this the pincher grasp or something like that and it's supposed to be a big developmental step because they can more accurately pick up small objects (and thus choke on them). This morning in bed she was mesmerized by my rings which was really cute and a good thing because that will be an easy thing to keep her occupied with in the future when we are out and about and toyless. Plus, since they are on my fingers, she can't choke on them!

      Today was a pretty eventful day in babyland. First off, I gave her a bath in the sink, and she was her usual delightful little bather self. But TODAY, she splashed for the very first time. I mean, she's *accidentally* splashed before, but I think today's was an intentional splashing. And then she was absolutely fascinated by the water coming out of the faucet. She's done this a couple of times, but she'll try to grab onto the stream of water and be so amazed that her little hand goes right through. It's so cool to watch her figuring out stuff.  And then a little later, I put her in her crib sitting down while I did something in the nursery and when I turned back she had managed to pull herself up on the railing and was on her knees looking at me over the bar. She look SO pleased with herself the little dickens. We will now have to babyproof the crib by lowering it and taking out the bumper probably.  THEN, (that's right, the fun doesn't end there!), I was playing with her on the bed and I put her on her tummy facing away from me. She craned her neck around to see and then, just like that, she turned over onto her back like it was the easiest thing in the world. Again, very pleased with herself. So I think we're getting there on the rolling over thing. I think I mentioned before that she's not so keen on being on her stomach and hasn't really figured out that she can roll over, even though she's done it rather serendipitously several times. Then she took a nap and it's so cute how she smacks her lips three times in such a classic baby way before she falls asleep.  Then we had a very scary moment. I was doing something on the computer, and Lilli was in her highchair sucking on a teething biscuit. I looked over, and I noticed that a rather good sized chunk had come off in her mouth and I was afraid of her choking on it so I took it out and put it away. Well, next thing I know, there must have been another chunk in there, because she was choking and spluttering and tearing up and I just grabbed her up and laid her on my forearm with her stomach on the heel of my hand and pounded on her poor little back, probably a trifle harder than necessary but it was SO SCARY. The whole time I was thinking, should I call 911? It probably wasn't a big enough piece to really choke her, it probably just bigger than was comfortable to swallow whole, but it was my first panic experience. She didn't cough it up or anything, but stopped coughing after a few seconds and then she was fine. She didn't even cry from the shock of me grabbing her up like that. SO. There you have it. Be careful with those teething biscuits.  In another unrelated observation, I've been noticing lately how when she wants to get somebody's attention she makes little grunty "ah" noises. I'll be sitting there, reading something or something like that while she's playing on the floor and I'll hear "ah. . . ah. . .ah" and I'll look over and she's staring fixedly at me and trying to get my attention. She needs quite a few cuddle breaks while playing, which I don't mind at all. Well, I guess that's it. Hopefully I will publish some more photos my mom took at Lummi by tomorrow.

      Whenever I move something, anything, towards Lilli's mouth, she opens it very obligingly wide. This comes in very handy when I'm trying to get her to eat or drink. (Sometimes when I have a spoon (which she recognizes) she'll open her mouth wide even before I move it towards her mouth). But it's kind of gross when the dog sniffs her mouth and she opens her mouth as if to say "ok, put your nose in here, if you want!"

      Yesterday when it was dinner time, I put Lilli's bib on her. Usually I put it on her just before she's about to eat, but this time I had yet to get her food ready. But as soon as I left the room she started to fuss and protest. Clearly, she knows now that when I put a bib on her it means she's going to eat and gets mad if her expectations aren't met IMMEDIATELY. Clearly, she's a genius (and perhaps a bit of a tyrant.)

      Bob said last night, a bit sadly, that he thinks Lilli is entering a new stage in which she loves me best. I disagreed, as I think it's only that she is most used to me and thus *needs* me most. BUT, as I reminded Bob, even though it is a wonderful thing to feel needed, I would *HAPPILY* give up being most needed for being only "equally" needed. If you know what I mean. :)

      We spent some of the holiday weekend at Lummi Island, and a good deal of time was spent by all watching the baby channel, as Randy calls it. Monday morning we put Lilli on her tummy with a spoon in front of her (she loves spoons), and we all sat around her and cheered her onward. She managed to do a full push up and get her tummy off the ground, and with a little help she got her knees up, but she hasn't quite figured out how to make all the parts work. She pushed backwards a bit, and wiggled her hips a lot, and pushed her stomach in and out but finally just gave up and laid her little cheek to the floor. We felt sorry for her and so pushed the spoon within her grasp. But then she didn't have a very good angle on the spoon, being on her tummy, and so we had to roll her over. She doesn't much like being on her tummy. I am convinced that if she did like it she would be crawling by now. Maybe we should just MAKE her spend time on her tummy, but I don't have the heart to do it when she looks so frustrated and cries and looks up at me with those big, sad, betrayed eyes that say "mummy, why are you doing this cruel thing to me???"   A few times though in the last couple of months I've put her down in a sitting position on her mat and looked away for just a second and KABOOM there she is on her tummy next time I look. She always looks pleased and surprised at herself but then quickly demands to be righted. I'm not quite sure how she manages to get into that position so quickly. I think she must tip forward or sideways.  One more thing: I finally managed, while at Lummi, to read a book for more than an hour in one sitting! woohoo! This is a breakthrough. . .(of course, she was napping).

      I left Lilli this evening with Bobby for like the second time EVER. I was only gone for about three hours, and from all accounts it was a success, which is good news for me in terms of future outings. But she was really happy to see me, which was very gratifying, I must say. She smiled and when I took her she giggled and did her little happy squirm. Then she got *MAD* when I didn't feed her right away. So maybe she just wanted the boobies. Oh well. Once I'd fed her she was happy again.  Lately, she's pretty funny at the breastfeeding. It's so funny to think we once had a problem with it. Nowadays, I'll have her in my lap as I get ready to nurse her (unbuttoning my blouse, or what have you) and as soon as she sees my breast she just grabs on. She won't even wait until I get her in a reclining position. Very impatient. I guess at least she recognizes it. But it's so funny to see her in any old position, very determinedly sucking at the breast. It kind of reminds me of a documentary I recently saw on some African tribe where the women go topless. They just carried their toddlers on their hips, and the babies just perennially had a titty in their mouths. They were rather long and saggy breasts (probably due to continually going topless and thus braless) which made it easier to get them to the babies' mouths, even when their mouths were up by the mother's shoulder. But it made me think that that must be the natural state of things. I know that if Lilli had it her way, she'd love to have a titty in her mouth 24/7.

      I *think* Lilli might be trying to say "dog." It might be just the wishful thinking of a doting parent, but quite often when the dog goes by or does something funny, she stares at him fixedly and says "da!" quite expressively. The dog is not impressed with this. He HATES it when I call him over just so Lilli can pet him. He looks at me like, "what am I, chopped liver??" But anyway, I'M impressed.  In other observations, I was just putting her to bed so I was noticing all the amusing ways she moves her hands while she's nursing and falling asleep. She's been doing this quite awhile, but she often pats my forearms in the most endearing way, and also picks at the front of her outfit, all the while moving her little fingers and wrists about. It's kind of like a flamenco dancer. Lately, when she's more awake and nursing, she also likes to feel my teeth, but that's not as cute as she usually scratches my gums with her sharp little nails. . .  She was just really cute a second ago as I'd put her to bed but she wasn't as fast asleep as I thought she was and she started to fuss. But as soon as I went back in the room and she saw me, the fusses turned to giggles and she immediately closed her eyes and went back to sleep. That's one of the best moments of parenthood, to have someone so happy to see you they are immediately comforted and giggle with the joy of it. Actually it happens pretty often that I'm sitting in a room with her while she's sleeping and she wakes up and looks around kind of scared, but then sees me and smiles right away and kicks her little feet. SO freakin' ADORABLE!!!  Hmmm, what else? I took her to Seattle with me yesterday and she was SO GOOD. She didn't cry once, in the car or at the park where I was helping out for the yarn shop where I used to work. She let complete strangers hold her. But then today, she was just a complete fussball, and we went to my grandma's to eat dinner and she would just not let anybody hold her and she cried at my Uncle Randy. She did fall asleep for a long nap at 7pm though, so maybe she was just tired. Of course, that meant she went to bed late. . .maybe she'll sleep in!!

      I know I've been kind of tooth obsessed lately, but here is another tooth entry! I've been griping about those teeth but I have found that she is making a lot more different sounds now, probably because she can use her tongue against those upper teeth. This morning while I was half asleep and she had her finger in my mouth and was poking around, I swear she said "taste"! I'm sure she didn't mean it, but it gave me a kind of a surprise in my delirious state. At least she's making different vowel sounds and esses and tees!

      arggh. Those cute little teeth make it hard to feed her too. She keep biting the spoon and won't let go, not unlike Atticus with one of his favorite toys. She really get a vise like grip going. Well, hopefully soon she will be feeding herself and she can bite the spoon all she wants. . .

      Lilli's new teeth are very cute (the top ones have a huge gap!) but they can also be very vexing. I thought before that just the bottom teeth hurt when she bit me, but today she bit me with both sets and OUCH!! I didn't mean to yell but when your poor little nipple is gnashed into by those sharp little things you really can't help it. She just looked at me, suprised, like "what??" At least she doesn't do it on purpose anymore. When she first got teeth she would do it just because she could and because she liked the reaction. Then she stopped doing it when I read about this technique where as soon as you sense the baby is about the bite you (which I could as she would always do it at the end of a feeding when she was getting bored) you pull her  into  you rather than away so that she can't breathe easily and so let's go. (Was that a totally confusing run on sentence??) Now I think she does it because those big teeth get in the way! When she hasn't latched on well she'll try to get a better grip and here come the chompers. I'm actually surprised that she doesn't bite more andor that I don't feel the teeth at all when she's nursing normally. Quite a big relief actually. I dreaded the coming of those teeth.  Tonight, a couple of hours after I put her to bed, she woke up and so I went in to her and she was doing the strangest little cry. I swear, she sounded just like a sheep!: baaa baaa baaa. Usually she quiets right away when she sees me too, but I don't know why she just kept baaing. Maybe she was still half asleep. As soon as I nursed her though she came to her senses and was very pleased to see me and drifted back to snoozyland. Which is where I am heading as well . . .

      Lilli stood up all by herself yesterday! She was in the crib and she just held on to the bars and pulled herself up, like it was no big deal and she'd been doing it all this time! I spent today trying to get her to duplicate the feat but it hasn't happened yet. There must have been a fortuitous alignment of her feet :) Maybe she will skip crawling and just go to walking. She's closer to crawling but not there yet. She spent a lot of time today  straining  forward with all her might to get at things, and I kept saying "try to crawl!" but she just kept straining and wriggling until she got it. If I put her in the crawling positiong she'll rock for awhile but eventually splat down and stretch out because she has a longer reach then. Maybe someday she'll just have an epiphany. Who knows.  In other news, our house is cleaner! There was awhile there that I didn't think the house would ever be very clean again. Lilli just wouldn't let me put her down and I was feeding her constantly, but I realized the other day how much time I have again, at least as compared to when she was first born. Then there was awhile where I had time to clean but I would have to sacrifice time with Lilli and I wanted to prioritize Lilli over a clean house. Now I feel I can have both. . .what a relief! I'm not saying the house is perfect, far from it, but Lilli and I can do our own things but co exist in harmony. She's so much more independent now, but she still constantly looks around while she's playing to make sure I'm still there and hates it when I leave the room. Someday maybe she'll get over that and Bob and I will be able to have a date night :) I'm holding out hope. . .

      She's getting smarter. I used to be able to trick her with certain things but she's figuring it out. Like the phone. She loves the darn phone! In fact, she throws a fit these days when I take it away from her. It used to be that I could put it out of sight and she's forget about it in a bit. Now it's getting harder to make her forget her precious phone. Also, when she drops a toy I used to be able to be lazy and just substitute it with another one. Now, I actually have to GET UP and get THAT toy.  She's also using her smartiness to sidestep crawling. Not crawling yet. But if I put something out of reach, instead of crawling to it if she's on an area rug she'll just bunch up the rug towards her and miraculously the toy comes too. Whoopee! She then gets that very pleased look. Of course, while cute, I have left the room a couple of times thinking that everything bad was out of her reach, only to come back a few seconds later and find her tearing up the newspaper or playing with the video game controllers. Speedy little devil.  Did I mention that my shoulders hurt like the dickens?? That darn baby weighs 23 lbs! I guess that's what I should expect. But actually, I think it was from nursing in bed a few nights ago and sleeping funny on my shoulder. Of course, it's not like my shoulder is getting a break now or anything, so it's not getting better very fast. I love my chubby healthy little girl but sometimes I wish I had a delicate little flower of a baby :)  Oh, and we went shopping yesterday. And guess who got all the stuff! Seriously, Bob gets so disgusted with me when I enter the world of Gymboree. They have a sort of power over me that makes me forget the closetfuls of clothes Lilli has at home and the clothes are so dang cute I pretty much ignore the price tag. But they were having a sale!! So everything had to be a good deal right?? If it had been just me I could have stayed there a long time going through the racks. As it was, I was hampered by civilians, so I had to zero in on the items I already had my eye on via the website. Probably a good thing as I still managed to spend $80. But, on the CUTEST OUTFITS EVER. Seriously. I will post pictures. We also went to Babies R Us and bought this huge toy thing that is supposed to be really interactive and fun and you put these blocks in and plays music and so on and so on. Well we set up that toy and all Lilli wanted to do was climb it and make it fall over on herself. We tried to show her how she could put the blocks in the holes (fun!!) but then all she wanted to do was play with the diaper genie refills. I wonder sometimes if we are buying the clothes and toys for Lilli or for us??

      Lilli's been really grumpy these last couple of days. I think her teeth must be bothering her. All four new ones have poked through now. Anyway, today she was just fussy fussy and wanted to nurse a lot more than usual. It's probably comforting. And she wanted to be cuddled a lot and she slept a lot more. Poor girl! At least she hasn't been feverish or anything like that. However, when something bothers her these days she's taken to doing this high pitched scream. Very unpleasant. I try to speak to her in a whisper after she does it to encourage a quieter tone of voice, but I'm not sure she gets it. She just looks at me like "why are you whispering?" She's also becoming very independent. Lately she doesn't want to bed and wants to do it herself, but when I try and let her she just flings the food all over and doesn't seem to actually put the spoon in her mouth. So I had an epiphany today and gave her  another spoon  to play with and tried to get bites in with my spoon while she was distracted. That seemed to work.  At the same time though, in the just the last week she's gotten even more responsive. I think the main thing is the hand clapping. It has progressed to a happy thing. If she's amused or happy she claps her hands, and it's so fun to see her figure out how to express herself so other people can understand. They're not just hands hitting together! They can tell the world she's happy! It pleases her so much that usually when she claps she giggles along which she does a lot more now too. I can also get her to clap by clapping myself so she's imitating me too. I think I may be able to get her to start waving bye bye if I do it a lot in front of her.  We haven't had too much progress in the crawling department since her last developments, but I don't want to push her. I figure she'll figure it out when she's ready.  ok, off to bed.

      Today has been an exciting day for Lilli. We had a whole bunch of family over for dinner, which was very nice, and we were all sitting around encouraging her to crawl. No go. She tried awfully hard and she did the side splits but she just didn't seem to get it. Then, like twenty minutes later we were putting her to bed and sitting together on the bed and trying to get her to crawl again. All of sudden, it was like a lightbulb went off and she started to wriggle and lift her bottom and there she was crawling backwards! When not twenty minutes ago she couldn't figure out how to get her bottom in the air! We were very excited and cheering her on, but she didn't have a lot of incentive to go forward, so (this might sound weird, but we were trying to think of what would be the biggest incentive) I got on the other side of the bed and got out the trusty old boobie and she IMMEDIATELY tried to scramble in its direction. She didn't manage quite crawling forward but by wriggling and sheer force of will she did manage to get quite a bit closer to it. By then though she was so frustrated with her goal so close that we gave in and helped her the rest of the way. Then she drifted off the sleep. . .  I think I will try to get her crawl towards the phone tomorrow. She LOVES the phone. I was on the phone a lot today and it made her so mad that I got to play with it and she didn't. When I finally gave it to her she was so happy and pleased and just turned it over and over in her hands, gazing lovingly at the buttons and occasionally giving the antenna little kisses. What she loves best though is to talk on the phone. If I'm on the phone, usually she gets fussy because I'm not paying her all of my attention. If I get the person I'm talking to though to talk to her she immediately gets quiet and listens really hard and starts to smile and then usually eventually tries to eat the place the voice is coming from. Yesterday she talked to my grandma calling from Japan and was so focussed on that phone and smiled so big and kept saying "ah!". Then my Aunt Linda talked to her this morning: Lilli was crying because I was talking so I put her on and immediately the biggest smile and then a rare laugh! But then boy was she mad when I had to take it back. She doesn't understand sharing yet.  I will keep you updated on any new crawling developments. I bet she's crawling in a week!

      Lilli has been terribly difficult to get to go to sleep these last couples of nights. She's just so revved up for some reason. If anything, she's too happy and excited to go to sleep. I'm not exactly sure what is making her happy and excited, and far be it from me to want to stop her from being happy and excited, but I also want her to go to sleep! She'll just bounce and bounce and laugh and wriggle until I finally get her to nurse for awhile, but she is usually still wriggling quite a bit. I'll finally think she is asleep and I'll try to sneak away, and then as soon as I get up I'll see those little eyes looking at me and those little bottom teeth grinning away, so pleased to see me. So I'll lay back down and she'll snuggle up and I'll think she's asleep and NOPE, she caught me again. Finally tonight I just hovered over her and she fought it, but her eyes finally closed and didn't open again. Phew.  Speaking of sleep though, she is so endearing when I get in bed. I've been meaning to observe this for awhile, because I saw some movie or tv show . . . you know that cliche where the wife is sleeping and the husband comes home late and tries to sneak into bed without waking up his wife and she turns towards him in her sleep and snuggles up? Well, Lilli does exactly that. I'll slip into bed and she'll immediately turn towards me onto her side and snuffle into my arm. It's very sweet.  Her new thing is clapping her hands. I don't think she does it yet to express happiness or excitement. She just likes the idea that she has two hands that she can make clap together. BUT, then she does get happy and excited because she likes that she has hands that can clap. Maybe that is why she is so hard to get to sleep at night. Too much exciting hand clapping!
