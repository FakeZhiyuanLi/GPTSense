       so this last weekend, i spent my time being very domestic. i cooked and cleaned. and cleaned some more. did some yard work. and cleaned again. in the middle of all the cleaning, i also made time to watch the videos of two plays in which i "starred" in high school.    oh my god.    they are the best tapes ever.    in the history of the world.    i mean, i haven't laughed so hard in a long time, and one was a drama about women during the vietnam war!    where to begin? the first one i watched was our senior play. originally, our drama teacher (and my second mother all through high school, gorne) picked  house of blue leaves , which is a dark comedy that was a bit too racy for one of our drama nerd lot, so she dropped that idea and we instead did this british comedy called  not now, darling , which basically amounted to a two-hour episode of "three's company." lots of wacky misunderstandings, girls running around in slips, unfaithful husbands and wives, and the hapless mr. crouch (played by my friend jeff) in the middle of it all trying to keep everything together. god i wish we could have done  house of blue leaves . the play we did was funny, but for all the wrong reasons. we had done a such a poor job of converting the "british humour" into something that could be taking place in nyc (we changed the location from some british city because it was either that, or have the whole cast use terrible british accents...which would have been hilarious). and me, i wasn't very funny at all, and it's quite embarrassing to think that i performed that in front of hundreds of people who paid to see it. those poor, poor people.    the second play i watched (the only other one i own), i did my junior year, and it was my award-winning* turn as "steele" in this play about, like i mentioned earlier, u.s. women in vietnam during the vietnam war called,  a piece of my heart . it's as heavy-handed as it sounds. apparently we really moved people though. we made a math teacher, who was a vet, cry. we so moved the vice-principal, that she decided every u.s. history student (pretty much every junior in the school) should have to watch it...and so we performed it three times during a school day for three groups of our peers who were forced to watch us cry and yell and curse vietnam, the vietnamese, the liars in the government, and war in general...    and i take off his boot...AND HIS FOOT IS IN HIS BOOOT! *sob* *sob*    stuff like that. i'm pretty sure that forcing everyone in my class to see that play is what got me nominated the following year for "most talented." before that, there was no way anyone outside of my nerd circle could have known that i did anything that might need some kind of talent...   anyways, besides discovering how horribly problematic it was for us to perform that play as high school students for a high school audience (the play uses the word "gook" like there's no tomorrow; shows vietnamese characters as sinister; there's even a scene where one of the nurses is given "gook's ears" by a potential paramour, and initially mistakes them as dried apricots...sure maybe it's real...but it's really fucked up stuff to be coming out of a 16-year-old's mouth)...so besides all that, i just watched and remembered the rehearsals and how much fun i had putting that play together...the same with  not now, darling ...and every other play i was in, the bad and the relatively better.   i don't know. i guess in general, watching those tapes reminded me of a simpler, freer time...   not that high school was perfect or anything. far from it. like countless other people, i still bear the scars of the ruthless pecking order of high school hell. i still grapple with massive insecurity issues that stem back to not belonging to that middle class/upper middle class (now that i'm older, i realize that there were no truly "rich" people at my public high school), j. crew/gap/doc martin sandal-wearing elite. at the same time, i was never confident enough to say, "fuck you anyways" and just go off and do my own thing. so as a result, again like so many others, i just felt like someone who didn't really belong anywhere. sad, but true...    well except when it came to drama (and speech and debate). there, i ruled.    actually...maybe that's why i like torturing myself by watching these tapes...it reminds me of a time when i felt like i was really good at something.    now, as the tapes show, whether i was ACTUALLY good or not is a whole different discussion. but i was told by other people that i was good. and i must have had some confidence in my own talent and skill, or else i wouldn't have mustered the courage to do what i did in front of people...i don't think anyways.    i do remember, however, that by the time i did my last play (the musical  little shop of horrors ), increasing stage fright had crept up on me, and it was to the point where, everytime i went backstage, i would have to do a script check before i re-emerged...even though i'd memorized my lines.    strange.    in any case, here i am, almost ten years after i was casted in my first high school play...   forgive the departure, but actually, i should say, "horribly miscasted." that first play was an adaptation of agatha christie's  a murder is announced , in which i played christie's classic recurring character "miss marple." MISS MARPLE!!! in case you're not familiar with miss marple, this is her as she was portrayed by joan hickson in the tv adaptations of 12 of her sleuthy adventures...       yeah, that's who i played...   for added comic effect, remember...this is me:   ME as an old english lady sleuth. and can you even IMAGINE how atrocious my accent probably was? thank god our performances didn't start getting taped until my junior year...   i digress, now ten years after that,  i think i can find some inspiration from that experience. in that first play i did, in all likelihood, i sucked. hell, i'm watching the tapes from three years after that play, and you know? i wasn't all that spectacular...not necessarily anyways. to my credit (and to my fellow performers' credits), the camera adds 10 pounds...AND you lose *something* when it's not live.   but you know, i liked acting...i loved it. i practiced so hard, and showtime came, and i went out there and did it.    i did it repeatedly.    i just went for it.    at some point, i started getting more hesitant. more self-conscious. that was evident even when, as a senior, i started relying so heavily on having my script with me at all times, even when i was performing. something inside of me got really scared and insecure about something.    i think now's the time i need to begin a quest to rediscover that fifteen-year-old incarnation of me that took her korean/black ass, sat down and made up a horrible english accent, memorized her lines, sprayed some crusty grey shit in her hair (for that "old english lady" effect), and got on stage and played "miss fucking marple" for the world to see.    *award-winning = i won a "gorne" award for that part for outstanding performance in  a piece of my heart  which was voted on by my peers. bow down bitches.

      oh yes i do.  i'm not ashamed either.  i never thought of myself as an optimist, but i figure i must be because there's a part of me that refuses to let the idea of the pure "olympic dream" go the way of santa claus...a beautiful fantasy that is supposed the embody the best humanity has to offer, but really they are just schemes kept alive because they make someone somewhere a whole lot of money.the reality is that despite any of our best intentions (if there are any), that's what they've become anyways in the context of a continually expanding capitalist, globalized market. actually, pbs taught me that that's probably what they've always been, except in ancient times, there was a whole lot less at stake. entire economies weren't virtually dependent on whether or not spectators were buying tickets and advertisers buying airtime...  amid the powerful forces that dictate the atmosphere in which "competition" is framed (powerful forces meaning money), is it any wonder that doping is such a big deal given what's at stake? we're not only individual and national pride, but potential millions of dollars (hell, why not billions? when all is said and done the olympics will have costed greece upwards of $10 BILLION) for everyone from the athletes themselves to the c.e.o.'s of mcdonald's and nike...not to mention the hope for eventual, long-term profitibility for the olympic host city...in this case, athens.  but fuck all of that, man.  i've got the fever.  all i know is that i'm watching some people do things that i didn't even know people could do.launching themselves into the air, all the while twisting, flipping and turning, and then landing with both feet on the ground. no hop. no step.  propelling themselves through the water at speeds faster than anyone else in the entire world.it's amazing to me, and i enjoy every second of it. i really do.  and then, there are the backstories. people whose parents passed away. people who've risen from abject poverty. people who have bounced back from surgeries and defeats and overcome media hype and personal drama, and people who have worked harder than i may in my entire life, and pushed themselves beyond normal physical and psychological limits, for this ONE moment...i get all wrapped up in it, and i love it.  and the games don't just intrigue me on an emotional level, i love the actual games themselves.every time the olympics rolls around, something astonishing happens to my brain.i become an expert on sports that i don't watch unless i randomly catch them airing on a saturday or sunday afternoon, and of course, unless it's the olympics.if you quizzed me right now on beach volleyball, swimming, or gymnastics, i could so school you after watching ONE night of prelims...and a few finals too.  in beach volleyball, apparently misty may (who's 5'9 and couldn't train for weeks before the games because of a torn abdominal muscle) and kerri walsh (the #1 ranked beach volleyball player in the world, who's 6'1 and came to the olympics in sydney as a member of the indoor volleyball squad) are the favorites for gold.  in men's swimming, the south african team rocked the house last night, winnning gold by smashing the world record in the 4 X 100 men's free. the american men came in third (they really wanted gold because they lost the gold for the first time in years in sydney to the aussies...but south africa was too strong. also, the u.s.' lead man, ian crocker, pretty much took the u.s. out of contention for gold by being the only swimmer in the ENTIRE race to take over 50 seconds to finish his leg...). michael phelps, this year's u.s. olympic team poster boy, is still in contention to tying the record for most medals one in one olympics though. he could leave the games with 7 medals at this point...pretty impressive...no mark spitz, but okay.  in women's gymnastics, romania leads the pack, turning in solid, consistent performances on every event on the first night of competition. meanwhile, the favored u.s. women's team stumbled on every apparatus, taking deductions here and there for breaking form on the beam, and teflon landings, but still managed to muster up a second place finish...  pancake, foot dig, kill, im, free, butterfly, breast, whipback, double tuck, layout, half twist, full twist...i'm ON it.  bob costas is so useless.  speaking of bob costas, how STUPID did he and katie couric sound commenting on the opening ceremonies? good lord. what really upset me though is that i sat through that corny "the history of greece on a float" crap, among the other artisitic renditions of all things greek and human and whatever, SPECIFICALLY so that i could see bjork's performance. and what happens when bjork takes the stage? stupid bob costas and katie couric would NOT shut up through the entire performance.  argh.  one last thing...gymnast, oana ban of romania is the TRUTH.  that is all.

       urlLink    my sister and me  urlLink     god i love my sister. she's the weirdest person i've ever known in my life...  she just called me at work to tell me about how she went to her new parents-in-law's house for a family gathering/party this weekend, and when caught unawares by their spontaneous eruption into the "electric slide" on the dancefloor, she began feeling faint upon realizing that in her 32 years she had never learned to electric slide properly.  she tells an ugly, dramatic story of stepping on people's feet, feeling dizzy, and *gasp* sliding in the WRONG direction!  she now thinks she has claustrophia and that all her husband's extended family, in light of her clear lack of dancing knowledge, will now look down upon her for years to come.  she called me, her little sister, for assurance that "everything is going to be alright" and what i'm sure will be known through the generations as the "great electric slide disaster of 2004" would not haunt her existence for all her living days.    that's my sister.  paranoid. hypo-chondriac. drama queen. stubborn. wildly insecure about the strangest, most random things.  that will always be my sister.  intelligent. beautiful. hilarious. truthful. principled. erm...unique.  it's good to be reminded of that from time to time.  she got married on a saturday in june, and moved away to atlanta, ga with her new husband the following monday.  despite putting on a brave front the whole week before, as soon as their rental car pulled off from in front of our house headed for the airport and my sister's new life as a married woman with in-laws, my mom walked straight into the living room, straight over to the nearest couch and wept like i'd never seen her weep.  i'm not one for "brave fronts" so i was already crying.  when i think about it, i guess it really was quite traumatic. from the time i was five and my sister was 13, it's always just been the three of us: me, mom, and sis. understandably, we have this incredible bond, and it's hard dealing with the reality of growing up and moving on and that our family can't stay the same.  i haven't cried about her departure since she left, but i guess i haven't really processed it. it still kind of feels like she's on a long vacation, but i know she's not, and somehow seeing all this in writing is bringing the tears that i just claimed had been absent...  funny.  yeah, i do miss my sister.  but i'm so happy that she was able to find a man to who loves her and helps her feel secure and who brings her joy.  i'm equally as happy that marriage or no, she's the same person who'll be afraid that she used a word that didn't accurately convey what she tried to say in an e-mail to or a conversation with someone, and call me to ask what i think the word means and the contexts in which it is properly used, and ask me about that ONE word for about 10-15 minutes and not EVER be satisfied with my answers.  and even if my answers are insufficient in the effort to assuage her anxiety, as annoying as that can be sometimes, it feels good to know that  she  knows that she can call and harangue me over anything, no matter how insignificant it may seem to most other people. she knows she can do that because she knows that i'm familiar with who she is and the idiosyncracies that make her so...erm...unique. she knows that she can push me to wit's end because she's my sister and i love her regardless.  what a weird and splendid woman she is.

       urlLink    yay work!  urlLink     as you can see i'm VERY excited about my job. i get to work at a desk and file and enter data into a computer all in a spacious and windowless office with beatuful white and sea green walls...  *pops collar*  on the good side though, i get some monetary compensation for my time.  some...   yesiree...can't you FEEL the excitement?  man, can i just say something real quick?  i'm kind of resentful that no one told me about this "quarter-life crisis" crap. i figured oprah or someone would have given me a heads up.  no wait.  i guess i was warned.  by the generation before me. the "gen-xers" whose struggles with being and feeling unmotivated, directionless, restless, and above all, misunderstood and restrained by society's expectations that they DO something productive or BE someone who contributes to society and stuff     in a timely fashion ... were so well-explored in movies like  reality bites  and other movies that starred people like winona "sticky fingers" ryder and matt dillon and christian slater...oh no, he was in  heathers  but i don't remember him being in a gen-x type flick...and...i guess ben stiller was in that crew for a minute too...  i digress.  i was warned about the "slackers."  i laughed at "slackers."  i spent my undergraduate career making FUN of people who were 22, out of college and not "doing anything" with their lives. i mean, HOW on EARTH could you be 22 and not know what you're doing with your life?  "congratulations on graduating! yay you!" "you're working where?" *laughs inside* "the MALL? on a cruise ship for the summer? as a receptionist? at your dad's construction company? as a substitute teacher???" "oh...um...that's nice." *evil snicker*  meanwhile, i failed to notice the irony in my own lack of knowing what the hell i was doing. ask me what i wanted to do once school was done and i'd confidently reply, "i want to go into social justice."  to this DAY, i'll be damned if i know what the hell i meant by that.  i sounded like a ninny beauty pagaent contestant (the likes of which i also like to make fun) with that vague shit.  i might as well had said, "i wish for world peace." or "me want good thing happen."  and now, i guess the laugh's on me. if i saw my arrogant asshole of a self at age 21, i'd seriously harm her.  i mean,  what  a   bitch  !   not that i'm a  complete  slacker though...  wait, since no one's  going  to read this anyways, i don't know why i'm lying...  i am quite clearly a slacker. i have an 8-5 that i hate to which i report at around 8:30 every morning. but i swear to GOD if i could just figure out what i want to do, i'd just go for it and do it.  provided the risk is minimal.  and i could make enough money to do what i want when i want.  and no one tells me what to do or when to do it, because i HATE that.  a spoiled, silly slacker am i.  spoiled, silly slackers are most of my generation. we don't even get a cool name either. they tried "generation y" but that's just sounds so dumb.  "generation y?" "because we hate everyone and everything."  so i don't even have the sick comfort of a trendy cliche niche of any sort from which to break, or into which to comfortably dissolve.  i feel something comparable to being lost at sea i suppose. no horizon in sight. i don't even know what body of water i'm in.  i remember not taking people seriously when they said (or wore t-shirts that said) things like, "life's not fair," or "life's hard," "it's not about what you do, it's about who you know," "suck it up, the world doesn't revolve around you."  but i guess they are right.  reality does bite.  one of these days, i just got to get the wherewithal to start biting back.
