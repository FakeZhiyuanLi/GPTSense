						   ANYONE that has worked in the tech support business can tell you how stressy that job is. Lets face it, our phone never rings with  good  news. And the second line thats ringing while you are on the first line, well, thats not good news either. In fact, thats just about what my job description was. Be the one that anyone could call when there was a fire to be put out, all with a smile in your voice in hopes that your good job will get reported back up to management and they will  finally  hire you fulltime after contracting there for 3 years..... NOT.  So all bitterness aside.....  There is a great parallel between being a technical support guru and being a mom. I think the similiarities is what kept me sane during that time. I was raised as a strong independant "take care of yourself" type of woman.  I had my career, my 2.5 kids, my fancy house, my fancy car and my prescription of Prozac. I could conquer anything! I was living  the life!  (Tick tock,tick tock, anyone hear the time bomb counting down? Anyone?)  I never thought I could give it up, I knew no other lifestyle.  Ok, to cut through the dramatic writings, here is where I am at today. I am back and forth with wanting to go back to work. The last 7 months have been so   peaceful,   everyone has commented at how rested I seem and at ease with life now.  I've enjoyed the slower pace and the change. Getting used to just living off of GD's income has been hard. Especially with a teenage girl (GG) and all the expenses that come with that. I keep thinking that I need to bite the bullet, update my resume and throw it around town a bit to see what comes up, just to make some extra spending money. But everytime I bring the subject up, GG and GB ( 10yo boy)  start in with "But Mom, I like you being at home with us, you're nicer now" (Ouch.)  "nicer now"? "More peaceful", I didnt think I was that bad working in California and felt a little resentful for the harsh criticism. I did what I needed to do to get us through the day... rushing here, rushing there, balancing this with that... but apparently, I wasnt being a happy, peaceful  nice  person. But I am now! I even gave up the prozac prescription!   So rethinking this decision to go back to work. Maybe I will just ride it out a little bit longer here at home.  Now the big question is, can I deal with the tediousness of the daily housework without going batty or losing my brain from lack of use? There are things I can do like work part time, or take a 3 mos contract with a tech firm. I am starting to play my flute again and look forward to joining soem kind of music ensemble this month. But I think the real thing that is getting me is the 24/7 "on-call" business of being Mom and tending everyones needs. That almost seems expected of me right now  regardless of what that "need" may be. But what about my needs? Am I expected to put them behind everyone elses?  How are other "moms in transition" dealing with the issue of being new stay at home moms from high stress jobs? I would like to see some responses for that! Help me please!  ~T

						    January 2004, Moving In       There is snow, and more snow and more snow. I am still getting calls from the job I just left about on-going "issues" that didn't get cleared up when I originially quit. Thats the least of the things on my mind to get done NOW. 1) Register kids for school 2) buy another vehicle 3) learn to drive in the snow 4) Get groceries .  That month was crazy. Not only was I completely ( and literally) out of my element here in Idaho, I am out of my comfort zone too. All of our stuff was still packed in boxes in the garage. The new rugs weren't in yet so we were living on bare floors, no dishwasher, no oven (the previous owners had busted it), no bed (just mattresses), no internet, and worse, no TV to keep the kiddos occupied. With no time off after we moved here, GD immediately reported to his new worksite and I was stuck at home to sort through it all.  At first the snow was enchanting, to wake up each morning and look out the huge sliding window to see our new backyard blanketed with new snow. The dog loved it, the kids loved it, the cats had no clue what was going on and hated it. It was fun for the first three months until the "non-fun" snow stuff started to happen, kids slipping and falling, me slipping and falling, me trying to simply drive to the neighborhood grocery. All skills we didnt have to contend with while in California. To top this whole adventure off, I now needed to find the sports store to gear the kids up for the snow, from boots to heavy coats to gloves and hats. Needless to say, more driving.   Fast forward, May 2004   OK, we made it through the snow. Now its time to make it through the heat. No problem! This is something that I can handle! Right?! Except for being laid up for two months for a hurt back from pulling all the weeds in the yard, I am doing good. It is AMAZING how over grown this place can get in a matter of days. I am late in planting my first garden ever because of my back injury. But I did manage to get tomatoes, zucchini's, chili peppers, bell peppers and some watermelon planted.  So much has happened in the last 8 mos. It would take Blog after Blog to go through it all. Needless to say, we have settled down nicely with some bumps and grinds and everyone seems to be happy??? Right??  I feel that these first few blogs will be more-so like a "diary" then what I originially plan it to be, a place to discuss topics that, selfishly, I am trying to address in my own life and hopefully there are others out there with similiar issues....
