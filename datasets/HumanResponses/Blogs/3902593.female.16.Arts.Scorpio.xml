       In a bath of pearls I douse myself as locks of my chocolate hair lick the edge of the washbasin. I slowly fall into the depths untill i am fully&nbsp;emmersed. I sunk into this like quicksand. I dont want to come up again. But nature asks for oxygen as i float to the top and inhale. Nature always asks for life and violently rapes for death. Beads of&nbsp;water roll along my body creating small pools in the ripples of my blemished skin. Im not perfect I admitt.  Sue me baby. Ever stare at somthing ugly long enough to convince yourself its beautiful? Scars left from the past make me think of the future. The future&nbsp;is scarier than the scars The futuer is ugly in a beautiful way And the scars are just there. Each one of them my fault So sue me baby &nbsp;

Ding da dingda ding da ding ding- make it make it vibrate!! WTF?!?! it has invaded my brain! SAVE ME!!  wait.. dont.. please dont save me.  *raps* Its sad seeing a pious white northern girl rap. Try not to think too hard about it.. Its a massacre like Ellen degeneres rapping to Dip It low... Scary right thurr boi.(fact is i like ellen.. shes a lovely older woman and i love her talk show! Props to Ellen for coming out of the closet too! Luv ya babe!)  OH noooeeees!!! Bend ovah and touch ya tooooeees!!!! Damn gurlll. Homie.. fuck it.. *giggles* Wow i havent done anything today... I went to work and destroyed a few files and moped around at the mural project.. *shrugs* I shoulda probably mowed the lawn but i dont feel like it. What do i feel like? I dunno. I feel like a Lucky Pony. Corey came back from the lone star state and boy am i fucking glad to talk to him again. I truly am a lucky pony. I feel so happy that its summer and that i am free from homework and social problems. In the summer I am free to do anything i please just as long as my room is clean and i do chores..

       Work. Its somthing i do every morning from 8am till 12pm. Its a short 4 hours but it feels long and depressing with the sorroundings I'm in. Allow me to give you a visual journey through my place of work:  Follow me to the dungeon....   The wooden stairs descend from the light of the office kitchenette to the depths of the flourescently lit basement. It is where i am holed. With every step the smell of black coffee brew gradients into the smell of dusty papers and brittle rubberbands. Its hard to describe the smell but it is most significant. When you reach the bottom step you have 3 choices.. 1.You can visit the chicken wired christmas tree owned by the accounting firm next door. 2. enter into the depths of the lawyers basement, or 3. run back up stairs as fast as you can..   Let us investigate choice number 2.....   Here the ceilings are hung low and to the right boxes greet you with a black and white hello. There sharp and dull and only want you to open them. Needy sons of bitches. some half jump off the shelves just to have you caress there sharp cardboard bodies for a second before jamming them into there correct sequence then leaving with a swift pat on the top. The middle of the room is a mess. I created it. I get paid for making it bigger.   Take a closer look....   My job is to destroy old files. So that what i do. I sit on a wooden chair and pick apart law files, removing all metal objects then stacking the files neumerically. Only for me to later on move over to the file card cabnet and look up every file by last name. and sequenctially put the cards in numerical order set aside to be known as destroyed. The pile is a cluster of files that i have picked through and sequenced. defiled and set aside. There next step is to be hauled to a local farm and be processed and pulled apart into cow bedding.. I mean... afterall... this is wisconsin.  My spot...My chair...   This is where i sit and pick through files.. Files to the right are files that i have no choice whether to destroy or not. They just sit there.... Im afraid how long they'll be there. some of them tend to avalanche on me. as im doing other work related stuff.. or not..  My bed..   This is my bed away from home. I sleep in the file cabinets when I'm too tired to work in the morning... Shh dont tell.. Its hard fiber board surface is rough like a farmers callused hand. But its comforting like knowing the farmer knows how to use his hands. The metal shafts hold me up above the scattered few boxes still lingering below. And hold the boxes up above me. They are trusting. even if they are aluminim...  Alleyway..   I have yet to clear this alley of file boxes. they havent been touched in years. Some dating back to 87... They stare me down with a vengence. they are sick of sitting and collecting dust. Its that or dow bedding.. Not much of a choice. They try to taunt me with the big scary concrete wall but I am not bothered. I just pass by.  Over the river and through the woods...   This sure aint grandmothers house.  my veiw...   Take my eyes and see what i see daily. Its bland and mind numbing. Charmless. Anally raping your brain of life.   even the lights are caged...   I feel like a caged animal left to live in the rubble and pick through it.  My light at the middle of the tunnel..   Coffee. My first love.. It gives me joy during my mid break. I defile it with cream and sugar and empty it from its ceramic mug. I always use the red mug. and always the coffee from the container at right in the kitchenette.. It over powers the dead paper and rusty paperclip stench. And gradually fights away my need to sleep ever again.  UV....W   File cards. Giving me hints about where i should be.. In the UV's in the Sun.. Not holed up in a basement. The cards mock me. I slam the cabnet shut.  At the end of my work day i go home for a bite of lunch and i nestle down at my computer for long talks with friends. I still fight the urge to sleep everynow and then. But i reforce my self awake with ice tea around 3 o clock pm. It is the way of Lucky Pony.

       Today was complexly boring as usual. You know the drill. Or maybe you don't. Either way i don't feel like explaining. I hate explanations in blogs that i own. I seem to always get caught in explaining things too much that i forget about the important moral of the whole story. I felt as if i traveled slowly through all genres of music and feelings today. Crazy to think. Impossible to reenact. Country tells the story, raps tells the actions, and j-rock shows the movement of my inner gears. Grinding a little (my brain not my body *laugh*). Left me with a headache. Glad i didn't indulge in things- as i indulged myself in others. I get busted by the parental units. Not my fault. As i point and blame someone else again. Techno mesmerizes me and erases all reality when George Michaels makes my soul wither in wonder. How is he? It seems so unrealistic. Its not. I wont let it be. Please allow me to be with him someday. I don't mean mentally with him. I mean in his presence. Casual snogging is a dream bubble that i would like to burst and let the reality seep through. At a table under the Eiffel tower. Snogging john lennons photo. Wait. That's not my man or my dream. I must preoccupy myself to ignore the fact that he's gone. It doesn't make me sad as must as it makes me think to hard. About the test of our relationship. A disagreement of whose luckier to have the other. Blog sent transmitted and received

       Why hello there! Wow such a nice place.. Lotsa room to breathe. I do think this is the perfect place for my ramblings. *sets down a single cardboard box* I brought my muses. They are all facets of my personality. Every one of them doing their job. Im not quite sure how many there are or who they are yet. But i have a feeling through this blog I will discover. Its all about discovery baby. Thats key.
