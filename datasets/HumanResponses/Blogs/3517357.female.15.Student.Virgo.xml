      Yeah, OK... I can hear all your minds thinking 'HoneyB? Whaatt' First things first...my name IS infact Honey. Yes. As in the honey we eat, the honey that bees make, the honey that we put on our toast. Well theoretically, it is that sort of honey, but in this case you're looking at honey as a NAME of a person. That person being moi. And as for the B at the end...that stands for my surname. Thats another thing for you to laugh about. My surname is Brookes. Making me HoneyB. I swear my mother called me that just to make life that little bit harder for me. O well..thought I'd get that bit over and done with. Now, seeing as this is my first post I'm going to fill anyone who reads this in about me. I live in London. I'm 3/4 white and the other 1/4 of me is oriental. I have dark, long hair and dark coloured eyes. I have natural tanned skin, 5ft7, slim. I love to write. I'd love to become a write of some sort when I am older..o, thats another thing I'm 15 years old. Anyway, back to what I was saying, maybe a journalist of some kind. I try to make my writing as interesting as I can. Well, apart from that I am your average teen girl. I love to shop, party, drink (:o no way Honey), boys. I am currently in a relationship. He's a guy...(just incase) called Mark. He's one of those guys who EVERY girl will say is 'Fit'. He just is, he's one of the best looking guys i've seen in reality. So, what comes with that are many negative points. 1) The competition is tough. A girl asks him out at least once a week, even though I'm sure they know he's currently in a great relationship, with me..HoneyB. I know that he really likes me, we have been together 3 months now, but I'm just afraid one girl will ask him out, and he will like her, and decide to go off with her instead. It is just a scary thought. 2) He can be rather arrogant. I mean who wouldnt be if you were as good looking as him? Now, there are of course good points. He is, quite simply drop dead gorgeous, and I love being with him, and Im proud walking hand in hand down the streets with him. I am, a proud girl. And, with the occassional arrogant streak, he is a really nice guy, and Im lucky to have him. Also, the jealousy of other girls really gets my adrenaline going..mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha. I'm evil. Anyway, of course there is way more to know about me. But, I'll think that'll do for today. If you're reading this...thanks, comment and I'll read your blog. I AM new and would love to meet other people. T.T.F.N Xx- HoneyB -xX
