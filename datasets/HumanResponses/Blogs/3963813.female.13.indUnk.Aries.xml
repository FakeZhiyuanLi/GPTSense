      So last night I had a dream that Travis asked me out. We were at Cameron's house setting off fireworks and Matt said you should ask out Cameron and I said I liked Travis so Matt yelled out to Travis that I liked him. Then Travis came over and asked me out and I said yes and he came inside and we ate cake. It was really weird.&nbsp; But maybe that means that I will get to go out with Travis. But I'm goin to the mall with Ej tomorrow. Me and her had a couple fights over the summer, but it seems like we're ok now. Alyssa seems to get a little madder everytime I talk to her. Well, she talks and whenever i say something she gets all pissed. Kd gets mad at me for sending her all these forwards. But I haven't talked to mj or d all summer. We all need to get together and have a sleepover before school starts. But me, ej and I think mj and kd are gonna be web leaders together. I'm happy cuz I think Devon might be a web leader, so I dont wanna be alone around him. If he says anything to me i'm gonna be like "screw you I met someone new over the summer". So yea, thats that

      So I got my pictures of Travis.&nbsp; I really wanna go out with him.&nbsp; He's grounded so I can't see him, but I at least wanna see him one more time before I go home.&nbsp; I look at my pictures everyday.&nbsp; But it makes me wanna go out with him even more, and it really hurts that I can't have him.&nbsp; I mean, I haven't seen him in a week, and I'm so desperate to see him again.&nbsp; When I go back to school, I'm gonna hang his pictures in my locker, and keep a copy with me, like in my binder.&nbsp; I know when I go back to my mom's house I'll see Devon again, but it's not the same.&nbsp; I mean I think Devon is really hot, but I've never talked to him before.&nbsp; I really like Travis, and before he got grounded, I talked to him all the time.&nbsp; I love you Travis and I'll miss you!

      So me and Cameron went to go ride bikes and we stopped over at Travis's house, and Travis said that he can't come out for the rest of the summer.&nbsp; So I won't be able to ask him out.&nbsp; At least I get my camera developed tomorrow, cuz I have all my pics of Travis on it.&nbsp; And Cameron still wants to fix me up with him.&nbsp; I wanna talk to him at least one more time before I leave.&nbsp; Nobody knows it, but I think I really love Travis.&nbsp; I know I really liked Shaun, but now since I met Travis, it feels like never before.&nbsp; I really care about Travis.&nbsp; The one day when we were alone in my backyard I was so happy, I felt like hugging him to death.&nbsp; I've never felt that way with Shaun before.&nbsp; I love Travis and I want to go out with him and be with him forever.

      So I just decided that I like Travis.&nbsp; He is all a girl could want.&nbsp; I really like him even though he's two years younger than me and he's going into 6th grade and I'm going into 8th.&nbsp; But age shouldn't matter, right?&nbsp; Cameron told me that he has no girlfriend too.&nbsp; So he told me that next time he sees Travis he's gonna ask him if he likes me.&nbsp; I hope so because I'm totally obsessed with him.&nbsp; He's all I've thought about for the past couple days.&nbsp; He's came over to my house&nbsp;and we've watched movies and I feel like just grabbing his hand and holding it, but I can't yet cuz I don't know if he like me yet.&nbsp; But I'm pretty sure he does because he's always looking at me and he smiles a lot when he's around me.&nbsp; I'm SO in love with Travis!!!

      So n e ways today was my first day of school.  Here's how it went: We were in our web leader groups and we were going to the homerooms.  So Ms. Eagleston told us to go to Mr. Burton's room, he told us to go to Mr. Cooler's room and Sam came in and told us that we had to go to Ms. Eagleston's room. So the 6th graders were mad at me, Sammy, Natalie and Shannon for making them get lost.  So we were in Ms. Eagleston's room and she patted me on the back and I was gonna say "get ur nasty hands off me bitch" and it took a lot of resistance not to.  Then Ms. Eagleston was going through the rules and crap and all the 8th graders sat down and Dario came and sat next to me.  So I was like so happy.  Then they let us go so me and EJ went to Mc Donald's and we waited till breakfast was over but I decided to get breakfast cuz I never get to eat breakfast at Mc Donald's.  So I was sitting and eating while EJ went and got her lunch when Cameron came in.  So I was all like hyperventalating, then EJ came back over with her food and she was like "there's ur boyfriend".  Then I was all blushing the whole time he was there and EJ kept saying there's ur boyfriend.  So then they left and we left like 5 minutes after them and we went over to the school to wait for Kelena and everybody.  So we were sitting by the tree and I saw Cameron again so I was all happy again.  Then Kelena and Danielle and Alyssa got there and we waited for Caitie. By the way Caitie, nice haircut.  So went to the back of the school and I saw Devon and Alyssa was all like "goober!" so Devon looked over and I ran and hid behind Alyssa.  But I saw Zach too. So finally we went inside to Mr. Davis's room, and we got our seats.  And I get to sit next to Dario!!! I am so happy, he got like so hot over the summer.  So did Cameron, Devon

      So n e ways, I start school tomorrow.  I have to be there at like 6:45 to get a t-shirt.  If I'm doin this I want my t-shirt dammit! But I'm kinda nervous. Hopefully I get cool 6th graders in my group cuz if they piss me off I swear I'll kick their asses. But half of the teachers I have this year I don't even know.  Me and Ej need to meet after unifieds to go to algebra so we can both get lost together. I don't wanna take spanish cuz I got away with a C all year, and this year is gonna be harder. But I'm all ready. I got my backpack, binder, and all the other crap I need. But yesterday me and my mom went clothes shopping and we saw these fishnet tops so we both got em. I'm gonna wear mine when I go to my dad's. So I can be cute for Travis.  Cameron was supposed to get back on Saturday, I wonder if Travis told Cameron yet.  But anyways I'll write 2morrow and say wut happens.

      So I asked out Travis.  We went to the park and we hung out and I knocked over a trashcan. He didn't cuz he was scared.  But he went to go talk to his friend at the pool, and he decided that he wanted to go swimming.  So we went to our houses and he asked him mom if he could go swimming.  His mom said he could go so he came back over to my house to see if I could go.  I said I couldn't so I said I'll see you in a week.  So when he was leaving I gave him a note that said will you go out with me.  But I gave it to him and he started looking at it when he was walking away, but he didnt come back and tell me yes or no.  So I'm still not going out with him :(.  This is so not fun!!!

      So today Travis came over and we went to the park.  There was this snake on the tree so Travis had to catch it.  Then we went to his house th show the snake to his brothers.  Travis decided that he should let the snake go, so we did.  Then we let the snake go, so Travis's little brothers got bored so they went inside.  He didn't wanna go inside so he said "do you wanna go to your house?" so we went over to my house.  When we got over to my house I told Travis to pick out a movie so he picked out ghost ship.  While we were watching the movie I finally decided that I should ask out Travis.  Then when it got time for him to leave I kinda froze up.  So I never did get to ask him out.  I feel so stupid.  But no matter what tomorrow I'm gonna ask him out.  I really like him.  He's so cool.  But i'll write tomorrow if I can.

      Travis was supposed to come over today at 12, but he went water skiing. I'm tired of this shit! Next time I see him if he's alone I'm gonna ask him out.  I think hes scared to spend time alone with me.  Whenever we hung out before we were with Cameron.   Maybe if I ask him out he won't be as scared to be alone with me.  I saw him with his shirt off again.  But hopefully I don't freeze up.  I won't.  I need to ask him out this week.  It might be my last chance.

      So today I'm gonna ask out Travis.  He's supposed to come over today but if he doesn't, tonight I'll go on a walk and if I see him I'll be like why didnt you come over? And I'll tell him he should come over tomorrow.  But I am kinda scared.  But if being not scared and just doing it means that he will say yes, then I'm all for it.  But I   REALLY   hope that he says yes!!!

      So n e ways this weekend Matt was bein really nice to me, it was kinda scary.  But yesterday I went to go take Shadow for a walk and Travis was outside and he was like "hey stacey" so I was like oh, I should have asked him to come over.  So then when we were coming back from dinner, I saw him outside so I took Shadow for another walk.  But this time I talked to him for a lil while longer.  Then when I had to leave I was like "so you should come over sometime"  and he was like "like tomorrow" so i was like "like sometime during the week" so I guess he was a little eager to come over huh??? lol. so i'll write more tomorrow, I'm tired as hell and I need to get some sleep

      So yesterday I went to wal-mart and they really cute backpack I wanted was gone!  That really pisses me off, cuz I wanted it so bad. Now I'm gonna be stuck with the ugly one with no pockets if they don't get anymore in by tonight.  But me and mom have major shopping to do cuz I'm goin to my dad's on friday and I won't be back for another week. It's kinda hard to believe that I start school in 2 weeks.  My summer went way too fast.  On Friday I have to wake up early and go to that stupid WEB leader meeting.  I think that I should'nt have signed up for it.  I'll have to deal with thise kids all year, but I do get to get out of class sometimes.  I can't wait to see Cameron!  He probably got so cute over the summer. I don't care about Devon, cuz he's going out with Sammy K. He was an ass anyways.  But I do and I don't wanna go back to school.  I do cuz I wanna see all my friends, but I don't cuz I hate getting up all early.  My mom said if I get all A's next year (every term) she'll give me $50.  I asked her if we could count out spanish but she said no, cuz she thinks I can do good in that class if I really tried, and I told her that I tried all year last year, and every single term I got a c.  At least I don't have Ms. Eagleston, cuz that would really be a bad thing.  I got an F in her class and my mom is so mad.  But I have math and science for two class periods, and that means over an hour and a half.  I really wish we had Mrs. Meggers, she was the coolest teacher.  But Travis better be ungrounded before school starts, cuz then if I ask him out we can have a week to get to know eachother a little better. But I might not be able to get on here for a while cuz I'm gonna be so busy in school, I really gotta get good grades this year.

      So yesterday (Sunday) we went hot air balooning with mom's friend Ena.  So I was kinda excited cuz I saw Jimmy again, but we barely even talked.  All he said to me was something about my south park t-shirt.  But there was this   really   cute dude who helped us pack our air baloon up, and his name was Jeff.  He got a ride back to the field with us, and he rode in the trailer so naturally I had to go in the trailer too.  But on Friday I went to the mall with Ej and her friend Keke, and it was fun.  We got lunch and we went shopping a little bit.  But Keke was bein nasty cuz he was all like "I was gonna say sumthin, but I can't" . So me and Ej just told him to say it and he told me "ur thighs r kinda big but thats good cuz if I ever had to fuck you there'd be lots of cushin for the pushin". LOL. But I go back to my dads in a week and I'm really excited cuz I get to see Travis again.  I've been thinking about him alot. I'm kinda on the fence about deciding to ask him out.  Maybe not. Cuz I might mee someone when I get into 8th grade that I miht want to ask out and travis lives far away so if I do ask out someone, I would have to cheat on travis and I wouldn't want to do that cuz he's a great guy.  But on Saturday I went to my dad's company picnic and I saw jesse but she didn't even talk to me.  I was gonna go on the alpine slide but I stayed with Ysabella.  We got a picture of her and it's so cute.  Oh, and I got a new happy bunny wristband when we went to the mall and it says "school eats it". it rox!
