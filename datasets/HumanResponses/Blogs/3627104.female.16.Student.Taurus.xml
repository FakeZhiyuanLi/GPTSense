       urlLink    Somewhere in my dreams tonight, I'll see you standing there. You look at me with a smile "Life isn't always fair". You say you were chosen for his garden, His precious hand picked bouquet, "God really needed  me, That's why I couldn't stay". It's said to be that angels are sent from above, I've always had my angel...my Friend..Who's heart was filled with love. Wherever the ocean meets the sky, there will be memories of you and I, When I look up at the sky, All I see are visions of you. While there's a heart in me, you'll be a part of me.

       urlLink    You meant so much to all of us, You were special and that's no lie. You brightened up the darkest day and the cloudiest sky.                                                           Many tears I have seen and cried, They have all poured out like rain. I know that you're happy now And no longer in any pain.                                                  Something so hard ges stright to the soul, It seems impossible to get over and my heart is left with a big hole.                                                                             I'm trying to be happy, wearing a smile; but I'm dying inside. The world seems to be fading and I just want to run and hide. Everywhere I go I see your face, and realize how much I miss you; and on the day you died, a piece of me died too.

      Come, fly now. Make life a new. I'm gonna wait for the time when the future returns this blue star. I watched the waters surface where the light swayed as I floated in your sea. Listening carefully to the voice I hear, I entrusted my body to the movements of the waves. Gentle times pass by slowly, without anything such as loneliness or emptiness. I feel the sky, coming closer and closer...I can't tell if it's real, or an illusion. The me you left behind lives on. I'm just beginning to realize I can't stay here. The voice that calls me out of your sea spreads out with a dizzy feeling, becoming light.  Embracing the shards of my heart, broken by sorrow, with both hands, I was afraid of tomorrow. If everything can come true with prayer, take me back to before I'm born. For how long will I go on, breaking someone's heart and despising my degenerating self? The pain called "loneliness" makes my chest tighten Tears overflow... I want to open the box of memory right now and erase the painful past For eternity.  Since the moment I became aware of this power moving in me, I wander around, searching for the emotions I lost. Give me the strength to pierce through this era in which people hurt each other. In the sky I'm looking up at, the unfurling blue is waiting for me... Guiding me... Someday these hands surely will turn into wings, taking me to the sky of hope.  Don't fake the smile you gave to others. Sincerely letting your tears flow is also courage.  Those sad days will soon turn into fossils, and your pain will be secretly led to the forest of sleep. Good night, all of you overly enthusiastic stray children, until the day your impatience evolves into a dream. Life is waiting for the dazzling morning.  Even if final confession isn't granted Someday the darkness of this era will break into dawn. Life is awakening, weaving time itself. As if to return to your proof and so, the light tells your heart. You stand for a long time on the shore of tears. As if to gently conceal your feelings, the secret medicine Transports them to the open sea of memories. Let your fingers and ears, dirtied by morality, sleep within my arms.  Please come back to me, following memories, to the source of gentleness and dreams, In order to be born, and shine to the stars Once again... I'm getting used to the loneliness, ever since I was born. In order to forget, I always had one encounter after another...They did me a favor by making me aware of such pain...Those warm tears... Another conclusion. Another beginning. Is the death of the people nothing more than the birth of new life? Will the wishes of the people decay in heartbroken prostration?Will the hopes of the people lead to a desolate future? Will the dreams of the people lead to a past repeating itself? My dissolving heart destroys me.

       urlLink    I come and stand at every door. But no one hears my silent tread. I knock and yet reamin unseen. For I I am dead; I'm seven how as I was then, when children die they do not grow. My hair was scorched by swirling flame. My eyes grew dim, my eyes grew blind. Death came and turned my bones to dust. And that was scattered by the wind. I ask for nothing for myself, All that I ask is that for peace...&nbsp; urlLink

      Where thou has always been, at the center of thine own being, in the heart of all mysteries.  I have traveled far and accumulated much in the way of lore; I mark the cycles of earth and heaven in my brow; my gaze penetrates the firmament and I have discerned the threefold way of superal.  Supernal, that word denotes that which is beyond the Abyss, the chasm across which one cannot be carried by reason nor intellection, for the minds of men are dark and dense, admitting no subtleties. The supernal is beyond knowing directly through any of the Realms Visible or Invisible, but is reflected in them all, as it is the source of them all.

      Cada vez que miro al pasado me pregunto por que?!y empiezo a dudar del yo del presente, el que aparentemente ustedes conocen. No se que va a pasar, solo se que por ahora me aferro al dolor mintiendome a mi misma, creyendo en una ilusion que dejo de existir. El mundo exterior se desvance a cada instante y huyo a la oscuridad.   The pain I submerged deep in my heart screamed and was revived. For all that is precious, I won't turn away from pain any more. The town sinks into blue darkness and a sigh that entraps the wind knocks on the sleepless window. Alone, I wander around in the deep maze. A faint hope, withered flowers... The swirling flames drive me mad. A dark moon engulfs me.  I can't sense anything as it tears my body to shreds and takes me away, deep into the waves. Shards of glass, sinking into your cold stare. Far away, I hear it: a sign of daybreak. Then, in the darkness I see the ruins. The place deep in your heart where tears are born is where the answer sleeps:To keep its eternal beauty, the tragedy happens night after night.  ...At the end of the tunnel is a dazzling world.  Thanks Y.R. - M.C.

You have to understand that everything we have built so far is nothing but a lie, You're a lie and a stranger to me.&nbsp; urlLink

      I understand now...I guess I did all this time, From today until ever, you're just that one who walks by my side, wanting me or not. Although it has been  a year since then, I couldn't feel it until today. You look at me through the mirror, watch me bleeding upon the altar of my life and all you could do is stare at my eyes and walk through hell with me. All I want to know is if this is only but a dream...  Are we real?... The smell of the blood is too intense, I'm lying there...Wanting to dream again...I open my eyes and I see you standing right by my side, You say nothing, only watch me bleeding...But that's all you were doing, right?  You're just another illusion of my mind...Although I'll never let go

I glance across the room, to see if anyone else hears it too. But no one seems to notice the look on my face. I miss you so much, I keep telling you...                                                 But you'll never be completely gone, because every time i close my eyes, there you'll be. Even though it hurts to hear your name, and speak of you; One thing I will always say is You Were always there....You don't know what you've done for me, But I tell you now, you answered my plea.        It's time to let you go...Bye

      You told me I was not alone You told me you were with me... But now I can't even tell if I recognize you're shadow, It was you're choice and now you also belong to the past, to that past I want to let go.  The days past by, and the old me just disappeared...I've become someone's reflection. You are the one that can save me but I guess you're to busy with yourself, I can't blame you, I knew it was going to be like this. Every day I wonder if you're ok, every day I live on knowing that you don't need me, not at all. I guess I'm just like a whisper that passes but you don't really feel it; I can't live like this, caring about you're life but not been a part of it, The last tear I already let go, and the last prayer I already said.   I never thought I would care about someone like this...You two gave me wings and ripped them away. Now you're gone, and left me in the shadows where no light can reach me, I guess it's better this away, you can go on..Living your life without another problem...Me.  I will return to the place I belong, back to the waters of my origin...I wont sleep for I will be the thousand winds that blow, the diamonds giant on snow, the sunlight on ripened grain, the gentle autumn's rain...Back to the beginning.  No one will be forgotten even though I have left all your heart's, I will forever have the memories that will never keep us apart.   Lost in my mind, surrounded, Looking for an arrow to follow, Left with nowhere to go, to fall. The game is over, I have lost I drop and cry out in defeat. The loneliness has destroyed my life, Id change it all in a heartbeat. Kick me down more so than I am, It's not like I know the difference, Im just waiting for my life to end And my funeral to commence. I havent got anything to prove So it might as well end now fast, End it so I have no future So Im just a memory of the past.  Please don't do this, You are all I have left. No matter how much I beg you my heart is broken ,I am alone, I am ruined; Alone I pray for something better than this  I beg you god if you exist, I fear for my life, No more pain my soul is a mass of scars now, I am a thin surface being ripped open, I can't contain it like I used to  I have nothing left.

For the better or for the worse, it is still hard to tell. Now it seems like winter will never end and you feel cursed. Soon there will be an epic struggle between two forces in your life and you are very concerned about a betrayal that could turn the balance.

      "But the demons of the past, were demons of fire and abomination...they were enemies we could fight-enemeies who inspired fear. Yet Satan is shrewd. As time passed, he cast off his diabolical countenance for a new face...the face of pure reason. Transparent and insidious, but soulless all the same"  "Doubt is your last shred of control. It is doubt that brings souls to you. Our need to know that life has a meaning.&nbsp; Man's insecurity and nedd for an enlightened soul assuring him everything is part of a master plan. But the chusch is not the only enlightened soul on the planet! We all seek God in different ways. What are you afraid of? That God will show himself somewhere other than inside these walls? That people will find him in their own lives and leave your antiquated rituals behind? Religions evolve! The mind finds answers, the heart grapples with new truths.(...) God is not some omnipotent authority looking down from above, threatening to throw us into a pit of fire if we disobey. God is the energy that flows through the synapses of our nervous system and the chambers of our hearts!"  "ANGELS & DEMONS"&nbsp; Dan Brown

      It begins very small  Seems like nothing much at all  Just a germ, just a speck, just a grain  But the seed has been sown  And before you know it's grown  It has spread through your life like a stain  And its power will strangle your love and your joy  And its hunger consumes for it lives to destroy   Hate is a star; it becomes who you are  Not the hated, but the hater has a torment that's greater  It will eat you alive, consume you and spit you out  Hate's gonna win that there's no doubt about  Hate doesn't care who you are- Hate is the Star!   Learning hate is an art, even people who are smart can be caught, can be crushed, can be creamed  Hate has swallowed you whole  Did you think you're in control  Hate you though, hate you spoke, hate you dreamed  All your hate gave me substance your lives are undone  It's your eve of destruction, your hatred has won!   How could it come to pass?  This awful twist of fate How could I hurt you  This madness can't be so  I can't believe it  I never dreamed that any barriers could rise  Or that I'd ever see the stranger in your eyes  Our hearts were hurting both the same  The hurt was tearing up our souls  The fury in us made us blind  We could not see beyond the pain   Ares--->

      I know, I know I've let you down I've been a fool to myself I thought that I could live for no one else But now through all the hurt and pain It's time for me to respect; the ones you love mean more than anything So with sadness in my heart I feel the best thing I could do is end it all and leave forever what's done is done it feels so bad what once was happy now is sad  I wish that I could turn back time cause now the guilt is all mine can't live without the trust from those you love I know we can't forget the past you can't forget love and pride because of that, it's killing me inside  It all returns to nothing, it all comes tumbling down It all returns to nothing, I just keep letting me down,  In my heart of hearts I know I've lost everything;  everything that matters to me, matters in this world.

There's nothing to comfort us What am I, if I can't be yours  I don't sleep, don't feel a thing And my senses have all but gone Can't even cry from the pain, can't shed a tear now I realise We're not the same  So I must, let us break free I can never be what you need If there was a way, through the hurt Then I would find it I'd take the blows. But this is the one.  Impossible dream to live What am I, if I can't be yours.

      Both sides of isolation and freedom Halt and hide in my heart Eyes close as the sky depends on the Strength and weakness of a single god while the breast of the knife shines  True feelings show through the mask I put on my head Absolutely  the difference seems Absolutely  this night by myself only within myself  More and more at a distance More and more I'm the only one who goes to the end of the sky to escape  Anxiousness and wishes mix to oppose my destiny The angels and devils individually whisper inside my head  Without compromise today and also tomorrow can make a difference Absolutely the difference seems Absolutely  not only are the soul and eternity the same More and more its sweltering  Absolutely  this night by myself only within myself   *Arigato Ken

I am Calling Calling now, Spirits rise and falling To stay myself longer...    Calling, in the depth of longing   To stay myself longer...     Stand alone... Where was life when it had a meaning... Stand alone... Nothing's real anymore and...  ...Endless run...  Calling Calling, For the place of knowing There's more that what can be linked  Calling, Never will I look away For what life has left for me Yearning Yearning, for what's left of loving  S Megami sama...
