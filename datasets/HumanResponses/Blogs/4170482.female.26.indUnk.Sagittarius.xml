      I got my wallet back! Nothing missing, I was really thrilled about that. Someone picked it up and went through a lot of trouble to return it, making a bunch of phone calls before finally getting ahold of my job and getting them to call me.  Other than that, things are going well. Class went all right today, then I went to the gym and headed to the jewelry studio to finish up my latest project. It's coming along really well but there is one problem I'm worried about. It's a belt buckle and this one piece I soldered on didn't hold up in the kiln too well during the enamelling process. The enamel came out great, but it might crack if I try to re-solder the piece. And if I don't re-solder it it's kind of useless as a buckle because it won't last very long as is :( I guess I just get to solder it again and then try to repair any cracks in the kiln, and hope that the piece stays on this time. Grr.  I'll post a link to a pic of the piece when it's done.

      Being a girl is cool. I pouted and snuggled with the dog for a while, and then did a full-blown at-home-spa thing, and I'm feeling better now.  Spa stuff: Blueberry facial scrub (  urlLink http://www.protectivenourishment.com/products.html  ) followed by moisturizing peaches-and-cream masque (  urlLink http://www.thebodydeli.com/  ), and then I hopped in the tub to shave and use a tahitian vanilla sea salt body scrub (body deli) and finished with the yuzu twist body souffle (body deli).  I am yummy enough to eat right now.

      Or at least, I was. Lazy Sunday, got out of bed at my leisure, had a nice meal of pizza at Mellow Mushroom finished off with my usual grande white mocha from Starbucks. Then I go to evening church downtown, and it was a great service. I don't feel like going home after so I head out to buy groceries, to be good and stop eating out so much this next week and spending money I don't have. Only...I lost my wallet somewhere. Where did I figure this out, you ask? As I'm paying for my full cart of already-bagged groceries at Publix. I try to pay with a check only to have him ask for my ID, of course, and then I have to walk out of there like a loser trying to buy food with a stolen check or something. I figured out I must have dropped my wallet on the floor of the auditorium at the service when I got out my tiny bit of cash for a tithe. I have absolutely no money right now, that $60 or $70 in my wallet was about all I have and most of it needed to go toward those damn groceries. I don't even know how my car payment is going to get paid. I feel kind of like, what's up with that, God? I'm trying to give even though I'm poor, and I end up losing it all? Not to mention the $25 they rape you with when you try to replace driver's licenses and school IDs and everything else. I'm going to go back tomorrow when the theater opens (the sunday evening service is in a theater downtown) and see if maybe it's still there, and call the church to see if anyone turned it in, but I'm pretty sure my cash is gone. Of course it could be worse, and if it went to one of the homeless people who happened to attend this service since it's right there downtown I guess that doesn't bother me, as long as I get the rest of it back, because it's going to be a major pain in the ass to replace the rest of that stuff. And with this being the final two weeks of the quarter, the last thing I need is another pain in the ass.

      Does that mean I've been assimilated?  Do people really read these things? Doesn't it seem the height of hubris to think someone really wants to read what is essentially the boring online journal of someone rendered anonymous through the internet?  Well anyway, here I am. Late twenties, single female with a beagle and messy apartment. And I do mean messy. I keep cleaning, but the actual level of clutter and mess doesn't diminish, kept at a somewhat constant level by my graduate-school-driven life. I'm talking dishes in the sink, tumbleweeds of dog hair on the hardwood floor, like an old western.  What else? Um. I like yoga, but haven't been able to get myself to make time to actually do it in forever. I go to the gym instead and do cardio, but am only able to do that by letting myself eat somewhere first and then promising myself the sauna afterward. I've become addicted to that.  I love Starbucks. They might be taking over the world one streetcorner at a time, but they get $3.98 from me just about every day for a grande white mocha. Just kidding. Sometimes I add caramel or toffee nut for variety.  I'm going to an art school for my master's degree that is pretty well known but not nearly enough to justify the outrageous tuition. I'm going to be in debt until I die. But somehow, I feel that investing in myself and my artistic education is the best investment I can make. It had damn well better be. I started out in animation because I love watching the stuff and have a background in computers, only to realize that I hate the actual process of creating animation. I don't want to sit at a computer for eight or ten or twelve hours a day anymore. I want to draw, I love to write, I think I would like to stay in animation but move toward the pre-production end of things: character design, conceptual illustration, that kind of thing. So I am moving to Sequential Art. Also, I may be double-majoring in Metals and Jewelry, because I've been taking some classes for fun and really enjoy making things with my hands. I just love the feel of metal and working it. Currently I'm taking an enamelling class and I love it.  My other major goal in life is to become a published writer. I've been working on a novel, off and on, but I keep changing my mind about things. With the intention of just getting one piece complete I decided to enter a short-story contest, but I'm finding out belatedly that writing a short story is not just like writing a novel or novella, only shorter. It's completely different, and my original idea isn't going to work so well in that format. It really needs to be a novel or novella. So I'm kinda back to square one there.  I don't know that much else about me is interesting enough to write down. My life is strongly driven by my beliefs. I've been a Christian for a while now and have a strong interest in apologetics, for my own edification and in case anyone asks. But who has time to read anymore? I don't have time for my playstation2. I have at least 2 or 3 games collecting dust that have only been out of the case once: FFX-2, Castlevania, something else. Also I still haven't beaten the GameCube Zelda. I need to go ahead and do that.  It's 4:36 am and I really should be asleep. Working nights in a restaurant and being a student again has gotten my days and nights completely flip-flopped. I'm more likely to still be up at 7:00 am than to get up that early.
