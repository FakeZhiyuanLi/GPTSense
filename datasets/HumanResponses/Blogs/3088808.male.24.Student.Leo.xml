      i have said several things about paris already.  this next treasure cannot be left out.  this picture is of the second level of sainte chapelle.  the church was built in such a way that the second level, reserved only for the king, was completely surrounded by stained glass pieces.  on the main side, there is a beautiful rose window that entinces the imagination as to the work that it took to build it.  the rest of the level is covered in biblical scenery from top to bottom.  walking in there is walking into a palace of light.  at the right time, sunset, is the perfect time to capture the complete beauty of it all.  the soft light catches all the windows perfectly and drives the senses wild.  it is amazing.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      a beautiful treasure from rodin.  i have always known that the thinker is probably one of the most beautiful sculptures in the history of the art.  this one, however, must be my favorite.  everyone, at one time or another, has seen this pose in some movie, or a cartoon.  the real thing is overwhelming.  it shows the human being as he really is, a thinker.  humans are constant thinker and thanks to the permanent nature of a sculpture, the thinker is a perfect image of humanity.  i found myself staring at it endlessly, just wondering at how any human can capture themselves, their own race in such a perfect manner.  it is as i said before... overwhelming.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      by far the most beautiful museum in paris is the rodin house.  it is out of the way, more than most places.  it is quiet, peaceful, tranquil.  instead of all the hype, pomp and cirmcumstance, they give you rodin plain and simple.  beautiful pieces that are accented by beautiful landscape and as you can see by this picture a beautiful background.  not too far is the church of the dome where napoleon's tomb rests.  the rodin house is a place to spend a few hours just sitting on a bench contemplating the countless hours and countless brain cells that went into each and every one of his pieces.  a must in any parisian visit checklist.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      these are my two friends, rob and lenore.  i have known lenore since last season.  she helped me out a lot on mean streak.  she is a beautiful young lady that loves to sleep and loves to ignore the alarm clock in the morning.  rob is just goofy, as is revealed by his great expression.  we spent some time together today going on some rides with josh as well.  we went on the millenium, magnum, mean streak, gemini, iron dragon, demon drop, sky ride, woodstock express, and my personal favorite: the wild cat.  between both of them, they have made my summer lots of fun.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      here is a little flashback from cedar point 2003.  my friend josh dropped me off at this little bar called louis'.  he is underage and since you see the "no" stamp on his hand, you know very well that he doesnt drink.  he is a good boy for the most part. but i am over the age and i did drink.  so much so that i puked my guts out just outside my car.  oh and after josh drove me to my room and put me to sleep, i ran to the bathroom and puked again.  it was a lovely image.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      the one problem with living in sandusky, ohio (home of cedar point amusement park) is that there is nothing to do except maybe go to the park.  coming from a bigger, more active city, the things to do here in sandusky seem almost trivial.  however, that can be changed.  but what needs to change is my mindset about this place and not the actual place.  this city has existed in this manner long before i got here, although sometimes i wonder how.  this city will exist even if i am not here.  i have to leave the concept of fun that i have in miami (fl), and try to create a new sense of excitement about this place, its quiet nature, its small town tendencies.  today is my day off and i really have nothing to do.  i can go to the park, which i will probably be doing a little later.  i can also sleep, which i have done for some time.  most of my friends are at work right now, so that cuts down on things i can do as well.  there is a small gym (basement like) in the employee recretional center.  i have been using it for the past few days and since i just really started lifting this year, it is just fine for me.  bigger guys will have to find somewhere else to work out.  maybe the solitary nature of this place should serve as my quiet, tranquil time of the year--a time where i get to take care of me and no one else.  that's the goal then: to take care of me and only me!  has a nice ring to it!!!

       urlLink    paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  i don't think anyone would disagree with that.  i found myself just staring at the famous places that most people only read about, and far worse most people will never even read about it.  this specific picture was taken from the top of the pantheon in the latin quarter.  the pantheon is home to tomb of voltaire and faucault's pendulum.  both topics of great discussion both in paris and abroad.  more pictures to follow.&nbsp; urlLink

      this is obviously the first posting of my brand spaking new blog.  i wasn't really sure what a blog was until i read an article in vanity fair that described the newfound power that blogs have acquired.  the idea seems interesting and hopefully my postings will be so as well.  i am currently working at cedar point amusement park.  i am the assitant team leader at antique cars/wave swinger location.  it is my second season here and although it is very different from the first season, i am still enjoying myself as much as i can.  i am certainly enjoying the freedom from my parental units.  i love those two, but sometimes it is very good to go somewhere for sometime so that i actually miss them.  wish me all the luck in the world and any news in my life will be posted here for all to see.  that seems kind of creepy when i typed it just now.  we will see, won't we?  until tomorrow.

      these are three of the best chicks out there.  rebekah is in lilac, angela in red, and tammy in white.  together they make up the sandusky women's fishing team.  they tried to get me to learn how to fish, but i needed a license.  what a crock?  a license to fish in lake waters.  i have never heard of anything so farse.  anyhow, i will be getting my license to fish in the stinky waters of lake erie so that i can join their team.  although it will have to be renamed to the smarter sandusky women's fishing team now that i am there.  just kidding of course.  they are all very smart chicks.  i will just be adding some latin spice to their white bread world.  more pictures will come soon from the team.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      the beautiful gal next to me is my husband katy.  funny story behind me calling her my husband and her calling me her wife.  i should be so lucky.  she is beautiful, funny, and very manly (burps, farts, and beats people up).  she is the team leader at the magnum and she is dressed for her ride night.  the night was amazing.  not only did she look great, but magnum is always much more fun after dark.  riding it over and over and over, and then some more is just the best.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
