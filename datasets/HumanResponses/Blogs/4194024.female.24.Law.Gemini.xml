       I have been asked by Mr. Misanthrope as to why I dislike Jack Zylman.  Here is my response:      He has been a thorn in my side for months and I have had it.  He is a close-minded moron, and basically, a waste of space.  He has personally insulted myself along with others because my opinion differed from his.  He also attacked my alma mater, and frankly, that ain't cool.        Honestly, for me to say I dislike Jack. is a stretch.  People like him give our party a bad name.
