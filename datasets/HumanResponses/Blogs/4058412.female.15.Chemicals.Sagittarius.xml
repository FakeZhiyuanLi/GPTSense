        another month. ughhh      so my dad is going to s'pore for a few days in august. i've already got a whole new list of CDs and stuff to buy :P because i probably won't be going back for a long holiday before going to aussie, since most of my stuff is here anyway. i'm so prepared for going to aussie, i mean it's a new place and a new atmosphere and there are new people to pester WHAT MORE COULD I WANT. knowing my luck, the school will probably say they were kidding and why would they want a student like me anyway. or there will be some nuclear attack and all the schools will be destroyed. OR MY PARENTS WILL FORCE ME TO STAY HERE.      so the most exciting thing i've been doing this past few days is worry over whether or not i should tear up a new transworld mag (yesiDOhaveasociallife). monday i might go over to a friend's house because someone is leaving or something. but knowing me i'll wake up at 5pm and then call them up and complain because i didn't go :) i'm such a horrible person really.

       yes nobody should skive off school it is very bad  VERY BAD.  it's so boring during the holidays, and yet i have the constant feel like there's going to be school tomorrow and i don't know what homework i have.&nbsp;some(normal) people adapt to the changes in schedule but no, i am damned to constantly worrying about english papers for the rest of my life.             since trevorrrr has left me for the kiwis(and sheep) i've decided to stalk her and part one of the plan is going to aussie, because well that's close to NZ right. but also the school is there and i have no other choice. i don't know what i'm talking about but you can't blame me, i haven't gone off topic because there was no topic to start off anyway.      &nbsp;    &nbsp;   i'm going to go see if i've done those math sums yet.

       so in this bio lesson, right, trevor and i were extremely bored and we were singing Go, and then we decided to rip off Blink and make our own band called Wink183 even though we can't play any instruments and can't sing if our life depended on it. also, we horribly massacred the poor band members' names to make Trevor Farker and Pom TheLong. there you go.    &nbsp;  we are not weird, really.

      i've got this awful cold which makes me heavy-headed and constantly have the need to blow my brains out. i'm hot and cold at the same time and i can't taste my food and i have to breathe through my mouth. i've gone through 5 of my dad's handkerchiefs which my friends so adoringly call "snot-rags". i don't sleep at night and when i do i sleep right through the day. and yet my parents think i'm lying about being sick. meh.  yesterday was the s'pore national day celebration at the ICC which to be truthful was so boring it was embarrassing. i spent the evening wishing my parents let me stay at home and had not forced me to ask my friends to go. how will i ever face them again. and my cold wasn't making things any easier. but the highlight of last night (literally) was the cake thing, because everyone who ate it had their teeth unceremoniously dyed to pink because of the icing. and the man who served the ABC, who suggested that people should not have ABC and just drink teh tarikh.  TODAY THE RESULTS CAME OUT. i got most of my predicted results except science which i'm so disappointed about. also they haven't released the math and art results but i'm not looking forward to those either. i'm sure i failed math and i'm sure i blinded the british with my horrible "art".  i finished reading needful things by stephen king at 4.32 am. it was so torturous; it was like spiderman 2 - the beginning was so long and it dragged on forever, and then the ending was full of action and drama. it also made me want to kill myself.  you know on star world, they have those advertisements for movies. they would put the actor's/actress's name, and then underneath that they'd put the name of their character in quotes. does anyone notice that they do this for the director as well. like, Shawn Levy, "director". or maybe i was just hallucinating. or maybe the people at star world really don't like shawn levy. i need a new handkerchief.

       okay so i've just had something extremely traumatising happen to me. well not JUST, it happened at 3am. i was hungry and i found this weird mudpiecake thing in the fridge so i stole that, and then after a bite, i discovered a weird gooey long thing in it and i've concluded that it was a rat tail. it was horrible! like all long and yellow and there were weird bubble things at the end. i almost puked everywhere but i didn't anyway. so yeah, i'll never be eating any form of dessert anytime in the near and distant future. *yechhhh*      so now we're going to singapore on the 17th for a week. i can't wait to go and raid hmv of all their cds and posters. but then i doubt they would have like half of the cds i want because they are idiots who don't stock up on nice cds. but i still have a week to go hunting over all of spore. AND THEN AFTER THAT I CANNOT WAIT TO GO TO AUSSIE AND GET MUGGED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WOOO \m/SUCKONTHAT\m/.

         hello mofos. it turns out right that our igcse results are being released on the      10th      and not the 26th because they are stupid retards who only know how to ruin my life. i had this fool-proof plan of staying in the empire a few days before the exams came out and on the day they did, well there was a nice big sea for me to drown in. but noooo they had to mark it quick so that i wouldn't be able to enjoy the rest of my holidays bloody british. now i'm worrying about whether or not my parents will send me to aussie, because they only will if the results are to their SATISFACTION i.e. A*A*A*A*A*A*A*A*A*and C for malay. i considered running away, but then i realised i couldn't do it at night because the security guards prowl around the grounds and lurk outside the house, and i couldn't do it in the daytime because there are more people prowling and lurking. i will lock myself in my room until i rot and die, because that is easier than facing parents with igcse results.
