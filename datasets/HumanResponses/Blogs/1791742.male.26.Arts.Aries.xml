       Wireless broadband.  Word.  Half through "The Hobbit" now, and I think it's getting better, but it's still not "amazing."  I think if I had not grown up knowing what many of the creatures were in the book it might be a little more interesting and "fresh."  However, playing so many fantasy games in my day has given me extremely detailed descriptions and backgroun information for most of the creatures, which diminishes the shock value and excitement.  On the other hand, I have a better visual image of these creatures, too, which I probably would not have had I not already known what they were.  (The description of the creatures are less than extensive in the book, if much at all.)  I've heard mixed reviews of the book from my friends who have now discovered I am reading it, but most simply consider it something to get through before one reads the trilogy.  So, I'm looking forward to getting to it even moreso now.  I just hope I don't see Elijah Wood and "Agent Smith" in my head as I'm reading the book...  I'd like to see whatever is described in the books and the images my mind comes up with putting them together.  I think that was the hardest part about reading "...Bagger Vance"--I couldn't get them out of my head.  The Wedding rehearsal for my friend went well last night.  I can't believe I'm actually going to wear flip-flops and play my djembe in a wedding.  I so love other cultures.  Unfortunately, the groom's mother is unable to get here from Africa.  So, they will be going back to visit as soon as he gets his Green Card, upon which they will have a completely different ceremony at his home--that I would like to see.  Of course, where he comes from the families promise their children to the other family upon what we call the "engagement."  That is actually when they are considered married.  There is typically no "ceremony," but a party with the families and friends and then a public announcement presenting the two together.  So, once they say they're going to be together forever, they're pretty much together.  In short, his mother already considers them married and free to do "married couple things," as said in conversation.  We laughed.

       I began "The Hobbit" today, and I'm about a quarter of the way through.  It's not near as interesting so far as the whole Middle-Earth stories have been praised to me, but I'm sure it'll get better (or I hope it will) in the trilogy.  Of course, whether great stories or note, its impact on the fantasy world has been beknownst to me since I was about nine years old, and for that I'm thankful.  I just hope I'm not let down after I finish reading all of the books.  I went to Madison Academy for the entire school day and met with all three bands.  I know I have enough students interested in lessons, I just have to wait to see what the parents say when they approached about them.  Hopefully, I will be getting phone calls soon about next Wednesday lessons.  If not, I may still try to go over to the school and help out or free every now-and-then.  I didn't realize how many of the students I know at that school.  I was bombarded by hugs today, and it made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  *aww*  So, I got a new guitar student today, and she's going to be the best student I have, so far.  She has a background in chorus, so she knows her basic notes and rhythms, and her application to the guitar was uncanny today.  She had never even been taught the names of the guitar strings and she was already reading notes and playing them without looking after just a couple minutes of explanation.  Super sweet.  I didn't have a lesson immediately following hers, so I selfishly kept her over a little longer because I didn't want to stop teaching.  It's great when I get students that absob material the way she does.  The only other student I have that compares to that is a drum student I have, but he's been playing for several years.  I was just shocked to see how fast he picked up the basic jazz and latin rhythms I gave him.  Once again, super sweet.  I had a brainstorm today, which I'm sure will fizzle into the clouds within which it was born, but here it is anyway.  Pat Mattheny (spelling anyone?) will be at Georgia State this semester and Paco de Lucia (all hail) will be there next semester.  We're talking about lifetime opportunities here.  So, the storm: tell a few of my students about it, plug how utterly amazing these guys are, try to get tickets way in advance, and pile in my van for a teacher student field trip.  *aww*  How super awesome cool would that be?  Of course, getting parents' permission to let their kids run off to another state overnight with their teacher might be a little ify...  Okay, probably completely unlikely, but hey, I think it's worth a shot.  I mean, we're talkin' top of their game musicians.  Those guys who have no competitors other than themselves.  And can we all say together, "Super sweet."  Rock on.

       I picked up a collection of "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" this evening.  I hope to start on "The Hobbit" soon, but things are going to be little busy for the rest of the week with teaching and my friend's wedding, which I'm playing my djembe in.  (Yes, it's an African wedding--and a Luthern wedding, which is a weird combination to me--and its the first wedding I will be performing in with an instrument and the first wedding I've been TOLD to wear sandals or flip-flops in.  Super sweet.  I'll be in full African garb, including the funny looking hat, which looks even funnier on my bald, white head.  I had a meeting over at M.A. today, and I will be teaching private lessons every Wednesday from 3:30-6:30 PM.  That's only six students, but it's good money for just three hours.  I will also be helping out on some after-school practices with the entire band on Tuesdays.  I may even go to some of their games just for support.  That will be more beneficial to the whole, but I hope that six of the seventeen "drummers" will take lessons.  I am going to begin plugging a new jazz band class for the school to begin next semester.  I just need to peak the interest of at least ten students, which is the number required in order to offer any class there.  If this happens, I believe the band director will actually be teaching the class, but I hope that I will be hired on as an assistant.  This would ensure the students will learn jazz and not just learn to play a few watered-down charts.  It would also give me an opportunity to write and/or arrange fairly easy charts for them to play at their concerts.  Not only will it be beneficial to them, but I'll also have my work performed (however good or bad the performace is).  I hope to have my more challenging charts played at the nearby universities, which I will begin sending work to in the near future.  Tonight I finally checked out what exactly Feng-Shui is.  In theory, it's spiritual living (good karma), but in all practicality, it's just plain pleasant, sanitary, and balanced living.  Of course, those who practice Feng-Shui, in watever aspect of life, and books written about it will go into much greater depth and detail and argue that my assessment is much to superficial, but that's pretty much the Feng-Shui nutshell.  It's actually something I will look further into, not for spiritual reasons, but for the appeal I have for that style of home living anyway just from my love of Asian cultures and decor.  If you don't know anything about it, check it out.  It's interesting stuff regardless of religious and/or spiritual beliefs.

       I finished reading "The Legend of Bagger Vance," and now feel less intelligent for having done so.  If you have seen the movie, don't read the book.  If you haven't seen the movie, then you can go ahead and flip through its pages.  That way, when you do see the movie, you'll have a much better appreciation for what Hollywood did with it.  Or you can simply watch the movie and forget that it was ever based on a book or that it was ever written.  I met with my newest drum student yesterday afternoon, whom had switched from another teacher at the studio.  I was shocked at what he didn't know at his level of playing.  Today I became fully aware that I am teaching these kids, and they are learning more in a shorter amount of time in comparison to others.  This isn't something I'm proud of or can brag about, but rather something I'm happy to have been blessed with.  God's given me the ability to bless others with the knowledge I have, and He's allowed me to do it in a kind an efficient way.  So, in that, I am blessed.  All I want is to teach others, and He has given me the ablility and opportunities to do so.  Sweet.

       I didn't have to hold the baby down for shots, which is a good thing.  Sis took him and decided to just have me watch the other while she was out, which basically meant sit on the couch while he runs around the living room playing with a hundred toys.  Yeah, no needles.  I had a new piano student today.  Five years old and scared to death of someone new.  She clung to her mother for the first few minutes without aking a sound and refused to even touch the piano.  For a minute I thought she would simply refuse altogether and her mother would take her away upset that she wouldn't even try, but I knew I couldn't give up and I also knew no child can resist the charm of yours truly.  Sure enough, within five minutes I had her playing all the notes on the piano with the right fingers and laughing like we were at an amusement park.  Kids rock.  So, I'm flying through the last bit of the book, and it is becoming increasingly different from the movie.  I have 84 pages to go, and I don't see any way there can be any kind of simile between the two endings.  I'm still not certain which I will like better in the end, but I'm still hanging on to the movie side for now.  However, I can't seem to see the two characters as anyone other than Matt Damon and Will Smith even though I know they are truly nothing alike.  Had I read the book before I had seen the movie, I'm sure it would have been much darker for me.  But I still see Will Smith and the demeanor he portrayed, which is by far more comforting than the book illustrates with its details.  There's just something about a facial expression one sees that can't be written on pages, or at least I have yet to read.

       My little nephew gets his allergy test shots around 2:00 PM, and I get to be the bad guy to hold him down for it.  My sis' doesn't want to be the one he thinks back on as contributing to his bodily harm, so she gets her brother who absolutely hates needles in the first place.  It's not the poking and prodding, but that there is a foreign object being thrust into the body.  It's just not natural.  It may not hurt much at all, but it looks as odd to me as a three-eyed fish.  There just shouldn't be something forced through the body like that.  Ick.  So, I play the bad guy for a while, and then I head off to teach all afternoon and evening at the studio.  I picked up another piano student and, more importantly, a new drum student.  Booyah.  I've picked up twenty students in one month.  Pretty sweet for now, but I hope to double that.  I'll add another six or so at Madison Academy, and I'll pick up a little more cash that way because I'll be working for myself instead of a studio.  That'll be nice.  I haven't been writing much in the past week.  Moving took its toll on my momentum, and I've been doing more reading in place of it.  Currently reading "The Legend of Bagger Vance."  I saw the movie and loved it.  Now I'm reading the book it was based on, and of course, it's different.  However, there are exact lines and scenes used, but the story is very different by design.  I'm half through the book now, and I hope to have it finished in my spare time this week.  It's only about 280 pages, so it's not bad at all, and it's easy reading.  Next I'm going to hit up "The Hobbit," followed by "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.  Yes, I'm finally going to read them.  Gettin' excited.

       Tomorrow I get up, bring all the junk I've brought back from T-town, and put it in a place that will surely be in the way or hard to get to once it's there.  I should sell or simply give away most of my belongings.  I don't need them anyway.  Besides, I sometimes think about grabing my pack, tossing in my laptop, a few notebooks, some pens and pencils, my Greek/Hebrew/English Bible, and a pair of drumsticks, strapping on my guitar and djembe, and just start walking in a direction.  Maybe I'd follow a road.  Maybe just walk off through the trees and come out wherever they take me.  I don't know.  I just don't feel my truth worth while I'm staying in one spot.  I must continue moving as I did growing up.  I must meet new people, touch them, teach them, learn from them.  I must move to Japan.

       I often wish the Bible were written in a different voice, like that of characters in novels or simply that of a different author.  Maybe then I could tolerate reading more of it.  However, the Bible was written and inspired so that all may understand its words, and I'm sure the Psalms and the Song of Solomon are just as poetic in their native tongue.  But in the English language it just doesn't translate into "good reading," as some define it, including myself.  As if trying to translate the true meaning of scripture weren't enough, now there are translatios which attempt to use "modern English" or some form thereof concocted by the translators.  These lose even more of the original intended meaning and they sound even less profound.  "Give us this day our daily bread" is now translated "give us three square meals?"  Some things are just lost in translation, and we should accept them, as have I, but this outright rewritten language is blatantly wrong.  The Song of Solomon, as inspired as it is, to me is horrible writing in the English language and contains something less than what I would consider to be beautiful, let alone the most beautiful song in the world.  Singing about a woman's breats isn't exactly what I would call lovely, but there it is, plain as day.  Maybe the Hebrew sounds better, flows better, or even has some sort of rhyme scheme.  I don't know.  I can't read it.  I can look at it all day long, with its scribbling curls and dots, view the line breaks and its form written right to left, but still nothing.  And then someone translates it, strips away the poetry and culture, and reveals to us its literal meaning.  This, unfortunately, is the way of the scholar.  But now at what costs are we trying to make the Bible "sound better" or "easier to read?"  What are we losing or even adding when we read things like "three square meals?"  What have we lost already from the beginning of our translations with "placing the knees" translated into the single word "praying?"  What embedded culture have we lost that could have been savored all this time?  Why do we not shalom?  Isn't that only in the Middle East?  Isn't that Islamic?  No, it's praying.  It's what we took away from the scripture and lost in our own culture.  It's something beautiful that we could still be doing today, but instead think it odd because we see it as foreign instead of seeing King David doing it himself in scripture.  These things bother me; always have and always will.  I'm now almost afraid to purchase a Bible that has ben published within the last twenty years out of fear of false translation even moreso than what has already been done.  Jesus wasn't born in a "manger."  He was born in a "cave," according to the Ancient Greek text, which in the later Greek was translated differently.  Oh, you didn't know about this?  You've never heard about any of these things or read them in your own Bible?  That's because we're comfortable.  We're complacent.  We take the sermons already given to us, take out our King James or Newe Living translations, and regurgitate them in our own words, our own twists.  We don't look at the literal translations of words, look at the culture, study the ancient texts, and put it all together to gather a true meaning of the scripture.  And someone forbid we map out the actions of the first century church as it really was: communism.  "What?" you say.  Yes, communism, but use that word in America and you're likely to get hog-tied and beaten for such blasphemy against our "modern way of life and democracy."  That's because we don't look at the word communism with emphasis on its root word "commune."  We see exploitation and oppression insead of love and compassion.  It's how we now translate that single word in our culture that has altered the way we even perceive the church.  Restoration?  No, I don't believe we've acheived it.  Can we?  I believe so, but not without accepting that our own culture and way of living needs to conform to the Bible instead of conforming the Bible to our own culture and way of living.  Am I going to jail for saying this?  No.  Did the first century christians go to jail for saying such things?  Yes.  Is that a blessing or a curse.  I don't know.  Maybe I would do more good if I were thrown in jail for saying it.  Maybe people would listen.  Maybe people would read their Bible and ask questions.  Maybe people would seek out answers.  Maybe people would evaluate their lives a little more.  Maybe people would really think "What would Jesus do?" instead of simply wearing it around their wrists and necks.  Maybe we could communicate with one another.  Maybe we could commune with one another.  Maybe.  Just maybe.

       It's dirt cheap to hop a plane out of the country right now.  Even more tempting for me to fly off to Ireland or Japan in December, although I probably won't do it...  It still feels good that I can go if I choose to.  "The Fellowship of the Ring" has been a little slow, and I so far see that the movie's changes were for the better.  However, I'm not going to make any official opinionative statements until I've finished the whole trilogy.  Who knows?  I could change my mind as the story unfolds.  I'm 1/3 through the book, and I'm still waiting for something really interesting to happen.  My 4 1/2 month old nephew is here tonight; up, of course.  His dad's gone off to Dragoncon in Atlanta for the weekend, and mommy could use a little breather.  Tonight she's only taking care of the 1 1/2 year old.  He actually sleeps at night.  I love those two little guys.

       I feel static.  I don't have any  worries , per say, and that somehow bothers me.  It should be a good thing, but for the first time in my life I don't really have to think about or do much of anything if I dont want to.  That's why it's becoming increasingly more tempting for me to up and move off somewhere, but then would I have the same carefree living as I do now?  I wouldn't have the stability I have, but is that really important?  Still, I continue to ponder on my idea of packing a bag and walking off.  I actually think I will pack up something and leave it in the corner of my room for just that occasion.  That way, if I wat to just spontaneously head off, I can do so without much (if any) gathering of belongings to take with me.  I can pack my notebooks, a change of clothes maybe, some imperishables or a scheduled resupply of nuts and dried fruit/vegetables, hemp twine for making jewelry and all the other handy uses it has, and some  just in cases , like matches, a knife, etc.  Actually, I think I might even do that before I go to bed.  Maybe I'll hop off this weekend since I don't have to work from Saturday afternoon until Wednesday afternoon.  Yeah, I just might do that.  Anyone wanna buy me an XL Blogger hooded sweatshirt?  I like blue.  *grin*  Although the temperature doesn't immediately show it and I don't smell it yet as I usually can, I can feel autumn, and she's already getting to me.  I seem to have a pattern I hope to break soon.  I pick up a snuggle bunny early to mid autumn and then release it late spring or early summer.  I used to think I had a time frame my relationships were typically based on, like a timebomb ready to go off, but as I think back it was more based around the seasons.  Regardless of when it started, it usually ended around the same time.  I'm finding this increasingly more interesting, and I'm curious to find out why this is the case.  I am aware that as a person I am greatly affected by the weather and the changing of the seasons.  However, this is enhanced by my natural surroundings, whether there be more or less  man made  or  natural  objects around me at the time.  Storms have always been a part of my growing up.  Living on an island for the first part of my life, hurricanes ( monsoons  on the island) were quite frequent.  I remember playing in them and having no fear of their destruction.  Tropical storms and nine months of  rainy season  in Central America also kept me flowing with  the tides .  The majority of my growing up was done in the tropics with a lot of rain storms, which influences my demeanor the most, good or bad.  Tornadoes captivate me, and I rarely go for cover unless forced by some authority.  I'm usually the first to run outside during a thunderstorm to watch the lightning, listen to the thunder, and dance in the rain.  I only wish I could do this more often with the adults' passing it off as childish naivety.  If you enjoy walking along the sinuous ocean with the fresh and saltwater colliding in a chaotic song as the lightning streaks across the sky, occasionally striking the enraged waves somewhere off in the distance, and the darkened clouds stretch for miles rolling through your head, lifting your hands high, screaming as rain runs off your face and into your mouth, and spinning around as though you were five years-old again, then walk with me.  Be my playmate.  Let's be one with our Creation.  I need a storm.  I was overjoyed when I received an email from my old friend now in New Orleans.  I remember doing a graphite sketch of a baby's face, which I miss greatly and wish I could see once more.  I gave the picture to her as a present over seven years ago, not much longer before I last saw her.  Now that we have reunited from a long hiatus of contact, she told me that picture is "proudly showing" in her building.  I'm touched.  Truly.  I hope to sometime soon visit, make some beautiful music, see the picture again, and talk about life and how it's unfolding.  I miss the waves.

       I must admit I haven't been reading as much as I could have been since last night...  Warcraft III got in the way, and now it's frustrated me enough that I've decided not to play for a couple days...  maybe.  I read another chapter today, though, and I'm going to start reading again in a little bit.  So, I hope I can stay on my reading track.  One student at the school today...  Hopefully I'll get some more next week.  I guess I need to send some flyers home to the parents because I know the kids aren't telling them I'm going to be there.

       So I didn't realize exactly how long the trilogy really is.  I'm about 16% through "The Felloship of the Ring" (P.71/458) and I'll read some more before I go to bed.  However, I think my previous schedule of reading all four books before the middle of September is pushing it, and maybe even the end of September, unless it encompasses all my spare time.  (That's a lot of reading.)  Though I may just do that because I want to finish it before the last movie comes out.  Hopefully I will be watching the second movie this weekend--yes, I can't believe I missed it in the theater, as well--but I want to know how the books end before I watch how the movie ends.  I've had too many movie scenes in my head already, which are nothing like the book, but my mind is expecting them.  So, I'd like to see how it all ends in writing before I see Hollywood's tale, however much great eye-candy it will be.   Mmmm...  eye-candy...  Wireless broadband is great when you live in a home that allows it to work properly...  I wouldn't really know about that...  On, off, on, off, and no, you can't go in that room or around that corner, but if you tilt your head just so, lift your pinky, and sing the alphabet song backwords then you'll have access for ten minutes straight before it goofs.  It's okay, though.  It's a luxury, a frustrating one, mind you, but a luxury nonetheless.  I was finally told of the Asian market in town a couple days ago--can't believe I forgot to post that.  One of the waiters of the Chinese restaurant I frequent daily entertained his notion of my needing an Asian girlfriend, explaining how they are much different than American girls.  Of course I know this all too well, but he had no idea.  His first comment was that they know how to cook, and I laughed as I informed him that I can cook most of what I order from the restaurant.  He was shocked, but impressed.  That's when he told me where to go in order to find the different foods I've been wanting to get--and where the Asian girls were, too.  I have yet to stop by the shop, but I plan on going sometime this week just to look around, check some prices, and maybe even begin some more Asian networking--I can never have too much of that.

       I finished "The Hobbit," and was disappointed in its fairly abrupt "get it overwith" ending.  Though I guess the book would be another 100 pages or so longer if it had more detail on the travel back.  Now I can start on the trilogy today.  Booyah.  Today was another reunion day.  It seems as though I'm going to see everyone I've missed in the last eight years all in one weekend--or at least a few days.  It feels good to catch up with some people even though we may never talk again.  Waxin' nostalgia...  True...  True...

       Saturday was a most eventful day, to say the least.  It's one I won't soon forget.  It started with teaching as usual.  As I was waiting for my last student to show up at noon I noticed his name had been scratched from the list.  So, I asked if he had cancelled, and as soon as it had occured to her, my coworker informed me that his parents had called during my last lesson to let us know he was in a car accident on his way to the lesson.  They mentioned nothing else.  So, right before I head to a wedding, I am thinking of my best student and know nothing of his condition.  I prayed for him and his family before I drove away from the studio.  Hopefully I'll find out how he is when I go back to work.  The wedding was small, but amazing.  I was honored to have been asked to play djembe for it and to be a part of that special moment in their lives.  It was also a reunion I wasn't expecting.  People I had not seen in up to eight years were there, as small as it was.  Some of us caught up as little as we could as we listened to Camraoonian music and ate delicious food.  I even danced with an old friend's six year-old daughter, who was barely at my knee the last time we danced.  She didn't remember me from back then, of course, but acted as if I were her long lost friend.  It was beautiful.  I exchanged conact information with most everyone I hadn't seen in so long, and I'm sure some of them will go on just as we had before, but if I stay contact with half of them I will be happy.  The groom and his brother, both from Camaroon, are very loving people, and quite thankful for everything as they constantly reminded me.  They both offered--against my notions of doing too much for me--to send me a very good drum each from Africa once they go back.  I hope to actually go with them or at least visit them in the future as my desire to visit Africa grows every day now.  Later that evening after we had all dispersed I made my way to Barnes & Noble, as usual.  As I was reading on in my book and sipping on a soy latte, I was shocked at what happened next.  As if the previous reunions were not enough, there walks in a face and a pair of clear-blue eyes I was sure I'd never see again, though I had try to find, someone I used to be close to but had left long ago.  I had only heard unfortunate things and had been thinking about her and her whereabouts for years, trying in some way to see if I could help her or maybe get her turned around in the right direction.  Much to my surprise, she recognized me on sight--the last time we spoke my razor-bald head was full of hair past my shoulders.  She immediately changed her previous intention and sat down at my table to talk, but not before we shared a reunion embrace.  She was only in town for they day visiting her parents.  We had only a couple minutes to do some brief catching up, and much to my relief she had been doing better than I had ever expected.  Now in New Orleans, she had left town several years ago, went back to school for a bit down there, and started her own business, which from what I gather is doing quite well.  As with everyone else, we exchanged information and hopefully won't lose touch again.  Okay, so it was reunion day, and it didn't stop there.  Once again, as if it were all planned way in advance, another old friend came in and we caught up as well.  It was definitely an interesting day, and although it took up a great deal of my hobbit time, I welcomed the untimely distractions.  Concentrating on the book was pointless after that.  So, I settled on reading it more later.  I now have seventy pages left in the hobbit's adventure, which I hope to have read by tomorrow night.  I've already spent more time on it than I had planned.  It's getting better, but I can't wait to get to the trilogy.  I'm feeling as though I will regret reaching the end of the books, and I will have to find more like it to read, if there exists other books like them.  I don't know.  I'm still ignorant on the great books that are out there.  So, after I finish the trilogy, I will resume randomly picking up books and reading little bits here and there continuing in my search for more good literature.  I'm beginning to feel the pull of something greater getting stronger every time I wake up.  I feel as though I shouldn't stay still here, though I know I am here to teach for the time being.  I am free to do whatever I please, go wherever I wish, and yet I still feel trapped in responsibility and duty.  Thus, I will stay where I am for now, continuing in my teaching, but will not make anymore long term commitments.  This does not exclude, however, the aquiring of a travelling companion, though I think I may not find one until my path ends, wherever that may be.  I think my true journey in life has just begun, though it seems as though I have just completed one at the same time.  I just pray that it is God that continues to lead me and that I do not stray my first priority given to me in His word: to take the gospel to all people, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  Amen.

       The more I think about the words I spoke last night the more and sooner I wish to leave here.  However, I still feel that obtaining a masters degree in some kind of education will aid me in the long run.  So, there is my dilemma; to leave or not to leave…  I had, on more than one occasion, thought about joining the Peace Corps to hasten my leave.  This would allow me to help others in need and leave the country.  However, it would keep my roots here, which I deeply wish to uproot.  There are benefits to this, though.  I will have no concern for finding support for what I want do, but at the same time will be steered in a direction for my work by someone else.  This I believe I can tolerate for several years while I get some experience under my belt in various areas of the world, which may aid me later in my own journeys.  There are pluses and minuses to joining the Corps, which I will give careful consideration over the next few months.  I will read up on all the information found on the Internet and try and meet up with a recruitment officer somewhere near.  A friend of mine is already in the process of being shipped over to Central Asia and said he would write me to tell me what it’s really like.  So, I already have a little bit of insight into what goes on with recruitment and what is really available out there.  According to what he’s told me, with my skills I would be no more than a medical exam away from joining.  That gives me comfort, as it is a positive option I have.  Other than the Corps or simply packing up and leaving for some unknown place to me, I have always considered the “mission” field, which I am called for.  However, this defined “mission field” is not exactly as I see my future.  The world is my mission field, and I will be a missionary for God wherever I may be.  I am not a “preacher,” nor do I wish to be or feel I am called to be.  My view of that position has also been altered over the years, and I don’t feel that there is a need for a static “preacher” to be anywhere.  That, of course, is also another discussion.  Truth be told, I don’t feel as though I am earning my keep in this world.  I don’t think anything I’m doing is really worthwhile short of a few important talks or discussions I have with some people and the occasional life I touch for a brief moment.  I often feel I need to wipe the dust from my sandals and move on.  I, too, wish I could tell some people the same thing.  Some I wish to never see again without a drastic change.  It’s just hard to do that when contact with the individuals is so easily and readily available.  Although, I may have some affect on them yet.  God only knows, which is why trying to choose wisely sometimes seems foolish in that there is no knowing what is to come, and I’d rather foolishly move on and continue in my journey rather than foolishly sit idle contemplating all my days whether or not I should.  It seems I have much to think about, and much still eats away at me.  We’ll see how things turn out soon, I suppose.  Life is short, and I don’t expect it to last longer than the present.

       As of late I have been doing a lot of pondering on the things I feel are affecting people of the world as a whole and the reasons behind many of their problems.  I have often said that if everyone had love at the center of their being, thoughts, and actions then many problems would not exist.  However, I have since seen further into the matters and tried to think of why this has not and, I believe, cannot come to fruition at the present.  Greed.  Not just that of money, but the grand greed of the world.  Read carefully, and ponder what I have to say.  Take a look at all of nature, save the human race.  There is a careful balance.  It takes what it needs, leaves the rest for other purposes, recycles itself, replenishes itself, mends itself, and lives on without our help.  Now, those who are believers know that God has set all this in motion and these things have no selfish desires against all else.  Those who have accepted the notion of evolution cannot explain this with science, or at least I have yet to hear or read a convincing theory.  Thus, at the source we must have God, which is the love I have been preaching ever long, for God is love and love is of God.  However, there is a part inside many that wish to obtain an abundance of worldly treasures.  I have witnessed this all over the world, and I will now tell you the problem that lies therein.  Humans tend to hoard treasures without regard to others.  What’s wrong with doing well for yourself, you ask?  I will tell you that nothing is wrong with doing well for yourself, and I have often heard this preached from a pulpit.  However, what I have not heard is what I am about to say.  When we take it upon ourselves to increase our treasures while disregarding others we have left that love behind.  It’s not enough to simply help our fellow man with the things we have as long as we are well off.  We must now, more than ever, take into account how we obtain our possessions; where they come from, who made them, why were they made, and at what costs?  When we use the word “cost” we cannot convince ourselves that our only costs are monetary.  With world economics, trade, transportation, and technology as they are today, it is possible for most anyone to obtain virtually anything from any point man has traveled here on Earth and elsewhere, including information and knowledge.  In this, there is an underlying conflict of supply and demand.  Now the supply of every human being’s needs is at a surplus, as are many luxuries we may now consider to be a simple part of life.  These needs may not be available in the immediate vicinity, but can be easily transported from elsewhere.  However, herein lies one of our biggest problems.  At what cost will it take to bring these necessities to those who need them?  At present, there is no cost other than the will for it to happen.  If the love I have preached is instilled within those who harvest these necessities and those who transport them, then there should be no problem.  However, there is a burning desire within most of us for something in return.  When this desire is brought into action throughout a great mass, the desire to give freely dissipates dramatically.  Then the love is lost.  “So, tell me again why it isn’t good to do well for myself and expect others to try to do the same?  They should have to work for their own things just as I have.”  As true as this is, it is unfortunate that this is the mindset we have come to.  It is not enough to do well for ourselves and demand that others do the same.  We must help each other in this process, not enforce it, as it were.  Unfortunately, there are those who will refuse to do their part, but as a whole, we can manage without them.  In this process it is not necessary to take advantage of others, suppressing them while others become better of than they.  As much as it pains me to say it, this is how much of the world functions and a large part of the reason we Americans have these “part of life” luxuries we have come to take for granted.  If the world functioned off of love rather than greed, everyone would be able to lead a “good life,” as defined by the majority’s standard of living.  Some that work harder than others would have more “things” with which to please themselves, and those who work less will not have them.  “Why should I work for someone I don’t even know or pay for someone else’s way when I can barely make my own?”  Because you love them and have disrobed your garment of greed, and if everyone did so, then you would have plenty instead of “barely making it” on your own.  Of course, until that happens there will have to be those who  are  willing to work harder for others, and for them the world gives thanks.  Therein lies a greater love than a gift from friends.  Alas, apathy sets in and the hood of greed is donned as we hide beneath it trying to disguise ourselves as we give a few pence every now and then to make ourselves feel better.  I want to weep for the men, women, and especially the children who made my clothes, my various possessions, left their land, and freely gave to me as I make the sweat for more as I sit idle!  I want to throw down my purple cloak and take up my earthen plow.  I want to right the wrongs I have lived and no longer contribute to the oppression.  I am a teacher, and so shall I teach freely to those who wish to learn.  I will strive to never again complain for a penny more I should have made or if I should have ever made anything at all for none of it is mine.  I will with all my being sow seeds of love and never leave the field.  These words and thoughts I will continue to dwell upon, investigate, and expound upon in order to write a complete—if that is possible—lesson for all to learn and apply, myself first and foremost.  May God continue to bless us all in spite of ourselves.

       I have about 150 pages left in “The Fellowship of the Ring”.  I don’t think I’ll make it through the entire trilogy by the end of the month, but I’m still shooting for it.  It’s gotten better since I last wrote about it.  Hopefully it will continue in that direction.  The council has just finished their meeting, and now it’s time for some action and real adventure (from what I remember seeing in the movie).  However, I’m still trying to forget what I saw in the movie and stick with what’s in the book.  It’s VERY different most of the time with some dialogue here and there verbatim.

       I’ve often wished I could pass unseen and watch others unaware as they moved through their day.  I would watch those things others miss; like the way someone reads the newspaper, talks to a baby after it’s fallen fast asleep, takes deliberate care to cut up a salad no matter how long it takes to make it perfect—the little things.  I do this as much as I can without appearing a little psychotic or the like, but it’s rare I ever get the chance to really put it into practice.  I want to know more about people, why they are, what they are, and where they are.  I find strangers the most intriguing.  The less I know about someone, the more I want to know, but without ever saying a word.  Psychologists and psychiatrists do this kind of thing, to an extent, but their presence, however little, is always known.  There’s something different about a person’s actions when they think no one is paying attention, even when they try to “act natural” when being monitored or watched.  I often wonder how much more the angels or celestial beings (whatever you wish to call each of them) know about us than we do ourselves for having access to this invisible treasure.  I wish I could for just one day be able to follow one person’s entire day, however exciting it may appear to be.  In following this dream, I often sit in a few places in town and watch the passersby.  Some are always there the same time of day, others are sporadic, and then there are those who simply come and go on occasion or maybe only once.  I’ve been doing this for over a month now in three places, and I’m learning quite a bit of them.  I’m usually reading or writing, but at the same time my eyes are open to my surroundings, which goes unnoticed by others.  I will sometimes overhear conversations, observe unique mannerisms, their approach to others of different relations, and I keep an unwritten log inside me of each one.  It’s amazing how much I’ve already learned in the past month, and I plan to continue my “research” indefinitely.  Maybe I’ll use them as characters in a book, a poem, simple daydreaming, or maybe even something more that has yet to come.    I want to know more about Israel Kamamawio’ole and to hear more of his music.  For over a year I have been listening to his arrangement of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow/Wonderful World” for ukulele and voice (himself, of course).  I share it with everyone I can for it is a rare jewel, sweet and precious with a light of joy unmatched by most songs I have ever heard.  Had he not left this world, I would have made it a point to thank him for that little gift.  It often brings tears up inside me, though I’ve never let them flow.  I think I will surely do so one day.  I’m simply waiting for that day to come, though I hope there will be no such horrible day that causes me to weep from hearing such beautiful emotion.  Here’s to you, Israel.    We are beautiful.  All of us.  Show others that beauty and play your part to bring out their own.  Sometimes people need a hug, a simple word, or even just a smile.  Do not reserve these things only for those you know.  You may just save a day, a life, or even a soul.  Sometimes you just might help yourself more than the other.  Try it.  Love is all around, and it’s waiting for us to find it.

       A good friend of mine moved back to town this weekend, and we went to see "Pirates...," which was an okay movie.  Depp was excellent, the special effects were intriguing, and the plot was full of holes and less than satisfying.  I think I'm going to stick to foreign films and old black & white stuff.  Nothing as of late has proven to be especially entertaining or intellectually stimulating, with the exception of "The Lord of the Rings" and a couple others I've seen that were released several years ago.  I need to find a fabric store around here.  I'm trying to find the material I want to use in order to make a traveller's cloak and/or robe.  I have yet to come across a good pattern I can use, and it looks like I'm just going to have to do the designing myself with what little I know about textiles.  I was planning on designing the outward look anyway.  I might as well go all the way.  The weather forcasts weren't pleasing enough to go hiking, but I'm glad I didn't go now that my friend is back in town.  We're both in dire need of something to do in this town.  Before going to see "Pirates...," we stopped by Starbucks to ingest some caffeine and play a few games of chess, in which I have an undisputed record in schooling him.  I thought later about my past desire to sculpt my own set of pieces.  I'm not sure what I want them to look like, but I had wanted to do it in sandstone some time back.  I guess that's something else I'll have to sit back and think up to design.  Need to do laundry. Need to make another hemp necklace. Need to get more students. Need to leave Huntsville. Need to stop using the word "need."  Four and a half more years until I'm thirty years old.  ...  I still wonder if I'll make it.

       Long night.  Too much tea and caffeine.  (Yes, I started taking in caffeine again, and wish I hadn't started, but still no carbonated beverages.)  I'm half through "The Fellowship of the Ring," and it got better once Strider showed up.  Hopefully it will continue in that direction.  I picked up some purple Halloween lights (stringed "Christmas" lights) tonigt to string around my room.  I used to have a couple sets of them several years ago, but were apparently "borrowed" indefinitely.  They're just nice to have glowing in a dark room.  I realized I don't have to teach until Wednesday afternoon.  This gives me at least a couple days to run off somewhere.  But now I need sleep.  Definitely need sleep.

       Pounding headache.  I rarely ever get them, but when they come, they come with a vengeance.  Watched, regretably, "The Medallion" with some friends.  I didn't know Jackie Chan was capable of such cheese.  There wasn't even a great choreographed fight scene in it like every other one of his movies.  Still trying to find someone to watch "Pirates of the Caribbean" with me.  If you're around and wanna see it, call me.  I'll go to the very next showing.  There's just something odd about going to the theater by yourself, but I'll do it if I have to.  I'm warning you.  I will.  *grin*  Everyone smile!  It's beautiful.  All of it.

       Tonight I feel horrible.  In my observations at one of the places I have been  studying   I've discovered things I wish I hadn't, and unable to do anything about it because of my displacement, I am forced to just sit and think about it.  I knew I would become aware of things I would otherwise never know in my  studies , but I guess I hadn't really prepared myself for it.  Tomorrow may be the last night I go there.  I was visiting my friends at the pharmacy I used to work at, and they really want me back.  I used to say I'd never go back to that company, but they assure me things have gotten much better.  I was even told they could start me out making a lot more than I was before if only I would come back.  Since I don't have anything I'm doing during the day, I may work occasionally for a little extra money.  However, I've been thinking about spending my early part of the days at the library or trying to get into some more vounteer stuff.  (I just got my library card here a few days ago.)  For a few years I've been wanting to do a children's reading at a library or somewhere.  I think I may try that.  I'd also like to just get some more volunteer work under my belt before I apply for the Peace Corps.  I do a lot of volunteer work, but it may not be the kind of "official" volunteer work the Corps would like me to have experience in.  Times are changing, and I'm feeling it.

       I met someone who doesn't believe love exists.  I've known people to say it but not really mean it before, but she really believes it and lives it.  It's sad, and several of us that she told are on a mission to convince her otherwise.  No matter what we said, she had some excuse and said we are in a false reality for believing otherwise.  So sad.  My van is temporarily out of commision due to an immobile "pully," which is in turn causing a belt to burn due to the friction.  This is both good and bad.  It's bad because, obviously, I cannot drive it.  However, it's good because I now know for sure which one has been making noises for the past several months, and that noise will now go away once I've replaced it.  So, I think it's more of a good thing.  I can do without it for one day.  I know I said I'd write about my thoughtful insight tonight, but it will have to wait.  When?  I don't know, but it will hopefully be soon.  I have several other things I'm going to be looking into over the next few days, and some things have to be put on hold.  I will get to those writings sooner or later.  I promise.  Autumn is on its way, and I'd love to be prepared.   urlLink Oh, how good I would look in an XL one of these!   *grin*

       An infomation meeting with a Peace Corps recruit will be held at UAH on October 15th from 6-7 PM.  There will also be a booth at the job fair that day from 9 AM-2 PM.  I was hoping to be able to talk to someone sooner than a month from now, but I guess I can wait.  I'll just do all the reading I can on the website and in brochures until then.  More thoughtful insight will return tomorrow when I am awake enough to write it.  Topic?  I guess you could say it's "respect in dietary belief."  I opened up a friend's eyes while having dinner, and I decided to share some of my thoughts here, as well.  Alas, it's night-night time.  Getting up in...  Yeah...  Less than four hours...  Right...  My one completely free day and I decide to hang with some third-shift friends after they get off work.  Can we say nap time after noon?

       Started "The Two Towers" and sent my first offical letter to someone from the Peace Corps last night.  I've come to the full realization that I can go wherever I want.  I'm finished with schooling (at east for now), and all I'm limited to is where I'm willing to work and live.  The Peace Corps has definitely become a big option right now.  I'll be living the dream my mother and sister both wanted, as well as myself, if I do move forward with it.  If you pray, keep it in your prayers for me!

       Internet connection was out lastnight.  I don't have a clue why, but it's been acting a little shaky recently.  So, no post from last night.  *boo-hoo*  I've finally finished "The Fellowship of the Ring" and am glad I can move on to the next book.  It's taking a while, but I'm slowly moving through it (the trilogy).  I went to the park tonight to play my guitar on the steps by the waterfall.  I always liked going there at night because it's so calm and peaceful.  Several people later walking by gathered 'round and sat and listened, complimenting every so often when I'd pause for a moment.  Of course, as always, underage girls tried their womanly wiles on me, but fifteen will get you twenty, if you understand.  However, I did realized that I'm no longer in Tuscaloosa, and the talent of the local guitarists is MUCH lower here.  So, it was nice to hear what they had to say, but it was more fun just playing my Takamine with the fishies.  I fgure I should play/practice a little more often now that I'm teaching.  It can sometimes be a little frustrating trying keep up with three instruments when your spare time is being devoted more to reading and writing.  Thus, I've decided to go to the park a little more often to play since that's where I feel most at home around here.  Looking at least five years younger than you are has great disadvantages before the youthful old age sets in.  It was nice when I looked five years older...  Maybe I'll never age.  Woohoo!

       I can feel things are beginning to change.  I'm going to start another job part-time within a week or so to give me something to do during the day.  That means going to bed before 6:00 AM.  I finally have no more students on Saturday.  It would be awesome if I could get my Friday or Thursday students to switch to the other day so as not to be so scattered, but things are fine for now.  I've been working on some electronic music for the past few days and now have two songs completed.  They're about seven minutes each, so I figure I'll put ten on a CD for dance mixes and such.  I really want to go to a good rave... one without all the drugs and such.  (They do exist, but they're just not around here.)  Some of this stuff is definitely rave material.  My friend is going to Georgia--the country--with the Peace Corps. in March.  He finally got his invitation.  I meet with the regional rep on October 15th to find out more about the Corps.  If things go well, I may start my application this month or next.  However, that all depends on what hapens within the next couple months...  I feel change in the air.  I can smell it.

       Sinus infections hinder my teaching ability.  Had one for the past two days and I've finally broken down and taken a single pill of medicine for the first time in a great while.  Have to work at both the pharmacy and the studio tomorrow, and I don't think I'm going t be able to do much of anything for Halloween aside from watching scary movies.  I may not even be able to do any kind of costuming.  That stinks.  I put the deposit down on the apartment today and should start moving in on Saturday, assuming all goes well and my roommate gets the paperwork in tomorrow.  It's going to be nice to have a place again.  I'm going to have on room for a studio where I'll be able to teach, write, and record my music with my computer setup, synthesizer, and electronic drums.  Gonna be sweet.  Super sweet.  Oh, and there's a fitness center, too.  Beefcake.

       Had the Peace Corps meeting a while back and things went really well.  I'm not going to apply just yet.  A friend of mine and I are going to get an apartment soon (probably this week), and we'll sign a year lease.  That'll give me time to do some volunteer work here in Huntsville and try to start a jazz scene with a few connections I've made.  The application process takes six to nine months from turning it in to when the volunteer is shipped off.  So, I have about three months before I'll put it in.  We'll see how it goes.  Right now my top choice for the Corps is China.  I've been doing a little more studying on the language (or languages, I should say) and the different parts of the country, as well.  My previous stay in Panama won't give me any leverage in going there because there are so many people who want to go to Central and South America who are already fluent in Spanish, and that Panama is more urban than most others.  So, that won't help me any.  However, being in Honduras may help me get there, if I so choose, but I think I will be of better use in Asia.  I've begun working at a pharmacy again to give me something to do during the day.  They've been begging me to come back and are paying me a ton more.  So, it's a good chunk of money I can save up and still have an apartment.  I just hope I can teach more students at the apartment than at the studio.  Then I can cut back hours because I'll be making more money.  Then I'll have enough money to get by, save up some, and have plenty of time to do the volunteer stuff I want.  I have this urge to take my guitar to the pediatrics ward and have some fun entertaining some sick kids.  Joy.

       Officially have the apartment, a mailbox key, and a "Welcome Home" courtesy of the management.  Now to move in.  I'm hitting up some thrift stores on Thursday with a friend of mine to look for furniture.  I'd like to find a smaller bed for my room.  I'm leaving the queen size here.  If I can't find anything, I may get a futon.  I've had my eye on one for a while, and I may just get it.  Anyone want to throw me an "apartment warming" party?  I need a couch, dresser, bookcase, and bed.  Non-Dairy desserts are yummy in my tummy.

       Moved into the new apartment, and oh, is it bigger than we imagined.  After moving our stuff in, we discovered we will never use the nine closets we have to their fullest capacity...  That's just nuts.  Nine closetes in an apartment.  It's big.  Just big.  Okay, so I know I haven't written all those things I said I was going to get to a long time ago.  Never fear, the time will come when all will be revealed!  I'm actually working on a website, which will take me a while longer to get "comleted", but when I'm done with it I will once again get a domain name and web-hosting.  Then my teaching stuff, music, writings, and many such things will be readily available for you all.  Hopefully I'll get to put it up by the first of next year.  We'll see how it goes.  Working many more hours than I thought I would have at the pharmacy, which is good.  Today one of the technicians put in her notice, so now more hours will be available.  This I will have to contemplate.  I'm not sure if I want to work that much a week, but I ay just do it so I can save up some cash for when I go overseas.  Would be nice.  Got some things to hange at the studio by the first of next year.  So, teaching there will be much better not only for the teachers, but I believe for everyone and music as a whole.  Sometimes you need someone who isn't just out for money to step in and tell how things are and how they should be.  True.  True.

       Yes, I am alive.  No, I do not have internet at my apartment yet.  Yes, I do plan on having it put in next month.  No, I don't know exactly when.  Yes, I will update this more often when that happens.  No, I will not have time to do all the writing I want to do.  T-town has flipped upside down, and I'm so far out of the loop it's frightening.  I kinda like it that way.  Makes me feel special.

       I went to look at cameras today--SLR and digital.  I found everything I wanted in both, but not in one camera for what I'm willing to spend.  I film and developing didn't cost anything, I would go with that.  However, that's only in a perfect world where no one would need cameras.  So, I can't go with SLR.  Although, everything I want to do with the camera itself I can do with an SLR.  Digital can do just about everything, but it is still digital.  However, this is what I need when transfering things to a computer anyway.  Although, it is almost four times the cost for me to get in digital what I want in analog.  So, do I settle with: 1) an SLR, constantly pay in money and time for film and developing so that I can have the great lensing, and enjoy capabilities that come with the SLRs 2) go with a low mid-range digital that has mid-level pixel ranges, digital transferring, low post-cost, and no extra lenses or 3) go ahead and spend more money to get a low high-end digital that can use screw-on adaptable lenses that aren't as good as the big analog ones, has extremely high pixel ranges, has digital transferring and all bonuses that come with it, and spend more money than I was wanting, but not near as much as I would if I had it all in one ?  I think I'm going with #3 because I can take a lot of pictures for at least two weeks straight withought having to dump to a computer.  This will be good when I'm out of the country and power is a limited thing.  of course, I'll be going through four AA batteries every 3 days of constant use...  But that's not as expensive as film and developing, and it's instantaneous developing.  (No wait time is good.)  However, it is a stupid amount of money, but I think it will be worth it in the long run.  Of course, I think an SLR would be, too.  I'd get both if I had the money, but I'd also have the high end digital if I had the money, too.  Money.  blah.

       "Passion" is soldout for at least another week.  I've been hearing and reading about it, and I've come to the conclusion that the public does not view this as a film.  I believe the majority sees it as a really expensive telling of a story or a documentary, if you will.  I've heard it's made people sick to their stomch, brought tears, brought hatred, brought joy, the best movie ever, a bad movie in respect to its attempt to retell an old "story," and many other things from both christians, those who calim to be christians, and the masses of non-christians.  I've yet to hear or read a truly sincere opinion of it.  People need to be real.

       God granted me today.  It was absolutely beautiful, and I did go to the park.  It was nice to watch the kids feed the ducks, some people flying a kite, and others just enjoying the sunshine while I strummed away on my guitar.  It had been a while, and I needed it.

       Morning came early.  Had a new piano student today.  If I'm counting right, I think that makes thirty students.  I should probably know that for sure.  Three hours of sleep is not enough for a ten-hour work day, and add all the Friday night nonsense to that and you have one tired me.  It's still early, but it feels so late.  Saturdays have become melancholy.  If it's not cold, I think I'm going to the park and sit with my guitar like I used to.  I've been getting the itch to write some new songs anyway.  I'm inspired.

       I'm going to be doing some early spring cleaning in my life.  I've had too much tea.  *boing*  I'm hoping to see the "Passion" movie tonight or tomorrow.  I'm most interested in its proclaimed accuracy.  Always a skeptic.  Sis is moving back to AL from L.A. in April...  Poor thing.  Going to T-town two weekends a month 'til I leave for Honduras.  I'll have meetings there for the trip.  No more work on the weekends for me.  Time to see old friends and hopefully make some more music while I'm there, too.  Definitely miss playing with the combo, even though half of them are gone, as am I...  Work in 6 1/2 hours...  Need sleep...  Too much tea...  (If you're reading this, clap twice and a djinni will pop out and grant you three wishes...  or your lights will turn off...  If you're not reading this, tell your other half that you're schizo.)

       It's not a permanent thing, I will be coming back, but I'm going to Honduras this summer.  I hope to make some contacts while I'm there for the work of Por Los Ninos, which works with an orphanage I've wanted to be a part of for around two years now.  I will be doing some mission work while I'm there, and no telling what other manual labor I'll be doing to help make things better in Catacamas.  I told myself ten years ago that I would move there after my last visit.  It looks like things just might work out that way afterall.  My Peace Corps aplication is on hold AT LEAST until I get back from Honduras this summer.  That means I may be in Huntsville a little longer than I thought... or maybe not.  I think God and I finally have the same goals in mind for me right now, and he's working in many different aspects of my life.  I can feel it.  I just wish I would have let him take the wheel a lot sooner, but then again, things wouldn't have panned out like they have now if I hadn't waited around in Huntsville.    Sometimes I wonder why I write in this if I know I'm going to hold back what I want to say anyway.  Who reads this?  Who knows about it?  And when will I realize it doesn't matter?  I never use names because they can be relative to the reader.  Also, those reading may be the one mentioned, and what would that bring about?  Good?  Bad?  Awkwardness?  I guess for me, as a writer, I shouldn't think about these things and simply write for writing's sake.  However, the practical me says, "go with caution."  For now it's caution.  We'll see what happens.

       Tonight I became completely and utterly aware of something: God grants me knowledge when I ask for it.  I may not receive many  things  I ask for, but I always acquire the information I seek.  That is beautiful.  That is what I want.  That is what I need.  God supplies.  I have a feeling a lot more travelling is in store for me this summer than I had originally planned.  Maybe things are looking up for my moving away.  Sunday I was asked about leaving the country.  More specifically why I would leave without a wife.  I had already thought about that a long time ago and knew it was nothing to consider when the goal is for others anyway, and not myself.  However, I thought it odd that someone would ask me, "what would you do for a wife?"  I know God has something in store for me because I feel Him working at this very moment in all aspects of my life.  Thus, it is nothing I should be concerned about.  Maybe there will and maybe there will not be one I will refer to as such, but whomever she may or may not be does not necessarily depend on my staying or leaving the United States of America.  All this running through my head in a blink of an eye, my response: "I haven't left yet."  Some things are best left unknown, but I want to know them.  This quest has created that which I am.  I once wept when I read the words of Solomon in utter empathy.  Still I hunger for his pain, and yet I find myself hypocritically pushing aside the questions I want and need answered only to find the love which I prayed for.  It is everywhere, and at this I wept again.  God is, and I am reminded constantly.  I have too much, and I pray most of it departs from me before it distracts me again.  A place to rest, nourishment, and the joy of spreading knowledge, wisdom, and love are what I hope to have when I have left all this behind--God willing.  I just pray that I may be content in my human desires with His sufficient grace.  Amen.

       My trip to T-town was intersting.  It had its good and bad points, but I still look forward to going back in two weeks for my next meeting.  One thing I'm not happy about is somehow losing a notebook of poetry I started last week.  It's either in my friend's apartment somewhere we haven't looked or it vanished from the face of the earth.  It's not too horribly bad because I had all but one thing in it memorized anyway, but I'd still like to get it back.  Hopefully he'll find it while I'm gone or I will when I get back.  Keep those of us going to Honduras in your prayers.

       This weekend I relived faded memories I wished to erase.  I do and don’t miss T-town one bit.  There are some places that change, some that change you, some that change with you, and some that change because of you.  I prefer the latter, and I hope to accomplish that as a result of these meetings I’m attending.  I want to change the areas of Honduras I will be in for the better.  Pray for me.

       The Health Center doesn't give Hepatitis A, B, or Typhoid shots anymore...  I need to find a doctor that does ASAP... and one that's close.  Going to get a copy of my birth certificate in the morning and head over to see if I can get me passport started.  Got my photos done yesterday.  Now I need to write a generic letter for those who are going to pay for this trip.  Muchas gracias.

       Back to T-town this Friday.  I pray things go well.  Wednesday is going to be a day of errands.  I need to get my passport in the works and try and make an appointment somewhere to get my first round of immunization shots for all that fun deadly stuff down in Honduras.  I don't need to wait another week on this stuff.  I picked up a new book lastnight that will hopefully guide me in a direction I'd like to take myself in.  We'll see what happens.  I'm still looking for some more inspirational books to take with me while I'm in Honduras.  If you have any suggestions, send them my way with a brief synopsis, the author's name, and any other pertinent information you might have on it or the author.

       The meeting went well, the letter is written, and I think I'm going to have a lot of support.  We added one more person to the team that is going, which makes a total of seven.  Yes, it's a small group, but that's a good thing.  Maybe we'l grow closer together and spiritually as a result of it.  I went to a friend's piano recital tonight, whom I haven't seen in a very long time.  I had a chance to catch up with several people that I used to see every day at the music building.  It was a good time.  Unfortunately, no one was doing anything and staying out very late tonight because they all have exams to study for.  The week before Spring Break for them is always a killer.

       Still in T-town.  The weekend started different than I had hoped, but it's looking up.  Some things are better left alone.  I've finished writing a letter to all those I hope will support me in my mission trip to Honduras.  If you're interested in supporting me (monetarily or through thoughts and prayers) or know someone who would be, send an email to durough@msn.com and I'll send you a copy of the letter.

       I have an appointment with a doctor in the morning...  Haven't had one of those in years.  Fortunately, there's nothing wrong.  I just have to actually become a "patient" of this doctor before the practice can give me my immunization shots.  So, I go in, tell her what I ned, pay for the visit, get my shots, pay for the shots...  Long way of doing things, but I guess I have to do it.  Just means more money.  Hopefully I'll have most everything paid for by the end of next week.  I'm hoping I won't have to break my fast tomorrow for the shots.  The last time I hadn't eaten and I got sick.  We'll see what happens in the morning.  Five more days...  five... more... days...

       I didn't see "...Passion..." because my friends needed me more than I needed to go see a movie.  Oh, well.  I'll try and find some time to go see it soon.  I'm heading back down to T-town next weekend (my birthday weekend), and most of my friends will be off somewhere for Spring Break or just getting back.  I hope at least a couple people will still be in town.  I may just wait and not go down Friday night.  The meeting isn't until Sunday evening anyway.  Of course...  well...  we'll see what unfolds.  Seven days until I'm in my UPPER-mid-twenties...  *shiver*

Someone's making me happier again.  Good thing, though so far away.  It's all good.  We're addicted.  Honduras trip is coming along nicely.  Have about a third of the money raised so far.

       It's been an interesting past couple of weeks.  This weekend should prove to be even more interesting.  I want another job.  Now.  I'v had it up to here *hand above head* with the studio I'm at.  Unorganized, unprofessional, low-grade equipment with no plans to improve, outrageous percentage cut, and a lousy owner, who wreaks of fishiness...  Okay, I've said it, and now it's out of my system.  I'm going to start looking again next week...  I hope...  I've paid for a new toy today I hope will be here in a few days.  My first e-bay purchase...  I'm no longer "Auction Pure."  Oh, well.  I'm sure I'll soon forget when my Wacom Inuos2 9 x 12 tablet shows up at my apartment.  Super sweet.  Much fun I see in my very near future.

       Last night I said something I haven't said in over five years...  I don't know why, and I don't understand it.  I did a lot of sketching with the tablet last night and today.  I feel better doing it.  It's good to get back into sketching.  Maybe it'll lend itself to something more sometime soon.  I'm doing some pretty good stuff again.  Sweetness.  I was asked to do another orchestra gig--this one actually pays and isn't just volunteer work.  The money would be nice, but I don't know about it.  I think it's going to take up too much of my time, and especially too much of my weekend that isn't already taken by the other orchestra.  Not looking forward to getting back into my tuxedo on Sunday.  I should probably make sure I have a clean tuxedo shirt before then...  I'm in a surreal state right now.  I need to come back to reality and accept reality for what it is.  grr...

       The past two weeks have been a roller coaster.  I'm still on it, but I think the ride's slowly coming to an end.  I've discovered something I haven't had in a long time...  and now I can't have it.  I'm still waiting to find out the purpose of all of this, but I may not know for a long time.  That tends to happen a lot.  I got a Wacom Intuos2 9x12 tablet (super sweet) that I've been drooling over for the past week.  I'm just about to really begin using it instead of just toying with it to see what it can do.  Definitely looking forward to it.  I've been very inspired to get back to my art, especially right now, and I have no sketchpads of any size in the apartment.  They're all stored with other stuff I haven't gone through at my Dad's old place.  This makes me sad.  I came home tonight to sketch and no paper.  I may have to find a different surface.  I've been thinking about going back to school again.  It frightens me.  I don't want to go into debt to go back to school, especially a private school, and for another three years.  I wonder if I'll ever remain in one place doing one thing for more than a year...  I haven't for eight years, and it was about every two years or so before that.  I wonder if I'll find someone who's the same.  Again, for the I don't know how manyeth time, I was told tonight I was "unique."  I'm completely and utterly aware of this.  That's why people don't forget me, but it also means I stand out... sometimes too much... sometimes more than some can handle... more than I can handle...  But I don't want to be anyone other than me, and by being that I accept that I will move through life with a continually changing backdrop--one scene to the next--or rather one sketch to the next.  I don't know if there's really been a enough of a coherency for it all to be scenes in one thing, but rather all separate shows in themselves.  This is my life.  Enjoy the show.

       I just lost a VERY LARGE post due to Blogger.com's internal server error...  it's gone...  I'm not happy...  grr...  Okay, I'm just not going to post anymore for a while...

       Although I own several movies I have yet to see, I watched one I've already seen tonight:  Where the Heart Is --the Wal-Mart baby movie.  Love that movie.  Guess that's why I own it.  I want to quit my current teaching job ASAP, but ASAP isn't until I get back from Honduras.  I'll lose four students I'd like to keep teaching, but they don't outweigh the problems and the bad students.  I'm very much looking forward to my new place because of the good that is being done there, but change in employment is always a bit unnerving.  I just have to keep telling myself not to keep asking myself questions.  Hypotheticals don't help matters.  For those who know about my van being backed into (it's not bad, but it's a fun story to tell), the total estimate is about $680.  I want that check.  Forget about a new bumber, I can deal with a small crack.  I want that check.  It will help me get through the summer without any worries while changing jobs (and allow me to quit my other one sooner and concentrate more on the new one).  ...  I've been staying away from the computer lately--more importantly IM programs--and forced those who want to talk to me to call me.  It's worked well except for whom it was intended...  Still waiting on a phone call.  And thus the plan has back-fired.  grr...  I guess it only strengthens my assumptions.  Much love, my peeps, homies, and g-money foo dogs.  Tell you maternal figures I said, "hello."

       (a month of catching up)  It's not hard to realize yourself, but to change is.  I'm trying hard to be the best I can.  I want so badly the best for my friends, those losing jobs, friends, children, spouses, and their minds, and I feel helpless.  I pray for you all daily, and I wish I could be the all-wise and powerful, but then I'd be doing the same thing He is.  What that is, I can't say, but I know it's right.  I don't understand how one can miss what one never had, but I do.  I leave for Honduras in ten days.  I start teaching at a new place in July.  My lease is up in November.  We'll see what happens.  Everyone should sing.  Daily.  This would be a better place.  Much love.

       Leaving early in the morning.  Not much time to write, but here's a quick post.  Several of my students want to follow me to my new job.  Sweetness.  I didn't ask them to.  They asked me where I was going because I was leaving.  When I told them I was going to teach somewhere else the response was usually, "Where?  We'll follow you."  Good for me, bad for the studio I'm at and the owner.  He might try something to get me into trouble with that, but it's their choice.  On other weird news, the brother of one of my student's mother is leaving his wife and two kids (one less than a year old) for a 23 year-old Honduran girl, and he is moving there to be with her.  This affair has been going on for a while, and he's decided he's going to leave.  Members of the church (he, his wife, and the Honduran girl), but apparently not for long.  Everyone knows about it now, and I'm not sure who all but those at the church in Honduras know some of what's going on, too.  Seems as though he's been involved in helping build a new surgical facility in Honduras, and that's how this began.  Hmm...  a new surgical facility...  related to the church...  Yup, that's where I'm going Saturday.  Small world.  Makes me wonder what kind of something is going to be stirred up in the church down there.  I've been told to ask about a certain person and see if I can aid in putting a stop to this somehow.  Not that I think I'll be of much help, but I'll keep an eye out.  Drama everywhere.  Everywhere.  After she told me that today (the mom) I had to tell her I was leaving.  Yeah, I hated to do it, but I had to.  Bad news on top of bad news.  She did her best not to cry.  So, if I don't come back or I die or something, I love you all.  Some I wish I had loved more, but all none-the-less.  Yeah.  So...  Bye.

       While packing I realized that I'm not as Americanized as the place I will be going to in Honduras.  This disturbs me greatly.  The dress code I've been given I don't own.  Who in their right mind would do outdoor manual labor in kakhis?  No shorts allowed while working, have to wear slacks and "dress up" for church services, and if one is to preach (in the oven of a building I've been told they have) one is encouraged to wear a tie...  In that kind of heat?  This is Honduras we're talking about here, folks, and not "big city" Tegucigalpa.  I'm going to enjoy the trip because I will be helping people and I get to go back to Cenral America (I miss it), but I can't say I'll be looking for permanent opportunities where I will be going.  They've already done to that place what I don't want to be done around the world.  I'm not a fan of forcing the "church of America" way of doing things on other cultures, especially since I've lived and worshiped in so many of them.  I'm a little upset.  I'm going to go buy some clothes that I can wear in Honduras and won't mind destroying...  That just seems backwards.  I'm sure more of that will enter this blog in the near future, if I haven't already mentioned something about it in the past.  I'm sure I'll take up a nice big chunk of your life when you read it, too.  After things settle down a bit I'm going to go back to my old topics and enormous posts discussing issues I deem important and worthy of bantering...  ( urlLink See here )  ...  (pondering again)  ...  I miss me...  and you...  and I'm going to find myself again, and maybe somewhere along the way I'll find you, too.  Fin.

       Told the studio I was leaving at the end of the month, and once again they are trying to cheat me out of money and do things illegally.  It's so frustrating working at a place so greedy and cares so little for its students other than their dollar value.  I finish up this week, take a week to go to Honduras, and then work the following week.  However, if things progressively get worse this week, I won't go back at all.  I'll still have given them two weeks notice.  I'll just be out of the country on the second week.  Going a little crazy.  I need to find some stability in my head.  I'm sure that makes sense.  Honduras in five days.  Going to go iron and pack.  Over eight days and no call.  Three more days before I give up.

       Going to T-town today for my last meeting before we fly out to Honduras next weekend.  Didn't go as soon as I had originally planned.  I hope to get there early in the afternoon so I can still see some people I haven't seen in a while.  I still don't know it I'll come back tonight or Monday morning.  So, I'll bring a change of clothes just in case (for those of you reading this down there who may convince me to stay).  I've been waiting on a phone call for a week.  grr.  Becoming impatient.  I still don't know what all I'm going to pack for Hondras, but I'm sure I'll have that figured out by Wednesday... 'cause I'm leaving town Thursday.  So, it might be a good idea.  ...  Wow.  I'm going to Honduras in six days.  I'm excited about seeing the children.  Still not sure if I'm going to be bringing my classical.  I've been asked to bring it (epecially to play Latin music for the kids), but that requires purchasing a hardcase for it before then and finding out how it'll work on the plane: will it take up my carry-on, will it take up my one extra  bag , or can I bring it at all?  I'm definitely not going to take a chance of it getting damaged if I can't carry on my person.  We'll see.  ...  (Pondering the uncertainty of life and how we live it.)  ...  End.

       Leaving in less than eight hours to go to Canada and staying in a for-real cedar log cabin on the beach in Michigan for a week.  Super sweet.  One more country and one more state to add to the list.  I'll be back Friday, July 9th.  I won't have access to the internet nor my cell phone for the majority of the trip.  So, if you want to get in touch with me, it better be while I'm driving up and still have a signal on the interstate.  Of course, that will be for about sixteen hours... but I'll have it on.  See you all when I get back.  Much love.

       Honduras was absolutely wonderful.  I felt like I was going home when I flew in and felt like I was leaving home when I flew out.   There's a lot of good I can do down there.  I need to send a couple e-mails and opportunities for me to move may arise soon.  Made some great connections down there.  I'll be putting a web site together about the trip and place it in my domain.  Right now there are some pictures, but there will be much more later.     durough.com/honduras   After switching studios I now have a LOT of free time while I'm building up my student base again.  It's going slower than I thought, which isn't good, but hopefully things will pick up soon.  I met up with an old aquaintance I used to play a few gigs with in town and I'm going to start playing in a quartet with him: drums, bass, piano, and flute.  We'll see how it goes.  If anyone needs or knows of someone who needs a web site designed, give them my contact info.  I'd love to be doing some design while I've got the time to do a lot of it right now.  Plus, the income would be nice.  Now to find something to do until next Monday...

        Heads up:   Unless something big changes I will be applying to go to Japan to teach English as soon as the applications for JET are available in September.  The deadline is December, but I will have mine in ASAP.  I should know by March whether or not I will be leaving July 25, 2005.  I will most likely be applying to go to Kyoto, but placement in the requested city is not guaranteed.  Please keep this along with all the other stuff I'm wanting and wanting to do in your prayers.

       Michigan and Canada were beautiful, and what an awesome trip!  I was searched for drugs three times in one week.  Talk about being profiled.  Young bald guy in a mini-van with two girls.  I was searched in Michigan before crossing the border, and then held in customs for over an hour in Canada while being searched.  Fun fun.  But wait, there's more.  In Columbia, TN, I was pulled over on the way back (after driving for 15 hours), and had a dog sniff out the van.  No ticket.  Just sniffing.  Then we had fun shootin' the breeze with the officer.  He liked us after he knew we didn't have drugs.  I did find out about a new kind of marijuana because it's what he was searching us for since we came out of Canada.  Yeah, I laughed at him for it.  Yeah, I didn't get a ticket.  Yeah, I laughed at him again.  Apparently our route was one of drug trafficing.  How convenient.  So, pictures and such will be up on my site sometime soon along with a nice write-up, but not until I get my Honduras stuff finished...  Hopefully that will be very soon.  I need more students ASAP.  Pray for me and those future students.  If you pray, they will come...
