      I do not know when and where in the course of human history man began to beleive in GOD. I am not interested to know either. But what bothers me is the fact that by believing in GOD man has started disbeleving himself. I do not think I am speaking out of pride or arrogance and I do not claim this to be an original thought either, but the thought seems to be more correct than wrong to me.    Men seem to have forgotten their own divinty by beleiving in God and the heavens. And worse, they have started dispising themeselves, their very own self. I wonder what makes generation to generation of humans to beleive so strongly in God and the heavens but not in themselves, their very self. Great achievements of human courage  and labour are ascribed to God and the heavens, when in fact the credit should have been to the human spirit.   Is it not time for us to review our faith and see why is that we have such an unflincing faith in God but not in ourselves and our abilities?  What scourges India is not the poverty, not the illiteracy nor corruption but the lack of faith of its men on themselves. Indians will better beleive their neighbours of a few hours than years of themselves. They are more concerned about the opinion of their friends, relatives and neighbours than their own will and wish. They have more faith in sadhus, saints and godmen when it comes to divinity and sprituality than in themselves.  Hindus should not prey if they do not understand their religion, its very essence, how it has come about and what it means. Hinduism is a book that has to be read and reflected upon rather than kept closed and preyed on as any holy book.

      What is a relationship? Why do we want it? What has it come to pass? Where do we stand on this? What can be done to it? I have more questions than answers but for the questions that I have answers, I do have definite answers.  I do not beleive in love as it is put forward, the meaning that it usually conveys, literally meaning I guess. But I do believe in the affection that comes forth out of a deeper understanding of the other person.  For a relationship to worthy enough it has to have the love, respect and understanding as it essence. I believe a long standing relatonship has these at its base, huge and strong, cannot be shaken at all.  Why do we need a relationship? May be we want to live a life, life in its full glory, with all its grief and happiness. We want a mate to share our sorrow & joy, our thoughts, and to provide us comfort and security and a feeling of being part of something, being valuable as a person and much more.  What matters in a partner? As humans we wish to live a fulfilling life. 50-60 years down the line we would like to feel content about the way we have lived our lives, what we have become. We wish a feeling of joy reflecting on us, joy from our actions, from our lives and from our relationships. We would like to feel content, we would like to feel a life worth lived. Towards this goal, we wish to have partner who respects us and our feelings. A partner who values our  aspirations and believes in us. On who is very understanding and loves us for what we are. One on whom we can have immense faith.   Does anything else matter for us? Then why are we scared to get into any relationship? May be we are not sure of ourselves and our decisions, we are also scared of people around us, friends, relatives and people in general.  What if the relationship fails? What if the partner does not turn out to be what we had expected? What would others think? Can I live a life which is looked down upon by all others who I know?  But then we need to believe in ourselves, we will commit mistakes and we do, we have the right to. The mistakes would be painful but we need to bear them, its part of life else happiness will loose its meaning, it makes us deserve the joy, and the ecstasy. We cannot give away our life to others for the fear of pain, we cannot scared of committing mistakes. We need to take our lives in our own hands, let us make decision and let us not blame anyone else for it. Lets live life as we want, as we want it to be. At the end of the day if not for anything  at least we would be satisfied that we have done what we thought was the best and what we thought was correct. And this means we would have lived a life to the full. We need to have the passion for our lives and what we want to make out of it.

      Hi all,  I am puttng forward a few thoughts borne out of a combination ofrealizations and experiences that I have had last couple of months andAyn Rand's Objectivism.Ayn Rand's Objectivism has been very influential in the way I think and the way I look at life. It has provided answers to many questions and definitely makes good fact.  I would be delighted to share the thoughts but please be aware that you might feel&nbsp;the thoughts are outrageous or they are out of pride or arrogance. The thoughts also have the potential to affect your believes and are hence potentially dangerous in case you do not get it right or get it completely.   In this mail I am putting forward one set of it, if you guys like it or hate it then I will put forth more. If you are indifferent then I will stop. The reason I am putting forward is my impression that you guys are better at a few practical aspects and also that you can reason in ways that I have not and provide a few good insights.  I would be very happy if you do an objective analysis of the arguments that are put forward without getting influenced by the image of the writer, if the writer has any. Please do reason every bit of it. The arguments are not to be learnt or memorized, they are to be ruthlessly scrutinized, every bit of it.   "Drawbacks of putting divinity in a plane above us"   Ever wondered why we do not think ourselves to be equivalent to "God". Why is that we have to assume divinity to be something that isdifferent from us? Why is that a few things are considered sacred while a few are not? We have seen so many people regretting/worrying for one thing or other and looking at some divine being for forgiveness or for blessing. But why? Why is that we blame all mistakes and failures on ourselves and all goodness and greatness to God? Why is that we are always demeaning ourselves, the very self, your real self. Lets revisit our lives and see what we have gained and what we have lost by not beleiving in ourself.   We are divine and we are what all there is. We are loosing so much by not considering ourselves the all there is.Why is that we do not pray the soul that brought you where you are. Do you think that you are where you are today due to divine help or blessing. No, you are what you are today bacause of yourself and you family(friends included), whatever has happened to you and whatever will happen to you is because of your wish or because of chance. By believing in divinity as something separate from yourself are we not debasing ourself? Are we not differentiating and demeaning others and ourselves? You are the one who has worked hard and reached where you are. You have brought for yourself the capacity to think, reason and do what you think is right. But by putting the fact that you are what today due to a divine being you are limiting yourself. You are killing the self, the self that if given a chance, a deserved freedom, would have taken to wings and visited the highest.   Let me ask you one question, would you be what you are if you had not worked hard? If you had not felt the need to do something, be something? Had you not reasoned what will I be incase I do not put effort? Because you thought and acted you are something today. Your parents are happy because you had thought and done what you wanted. Because you thought and acted you are able to provide comforts to them. Its you who is putting all the efforts to make your life. Its you who matters and who is the ultimate in this life. By not allowing yourself to reason. You are weakening yourself, the self that has made you, that which is the real you. By having no faith in ourself we are scared of things, the future, our own life. Since we are not believing that the life that we have is the utmost we are not tryingto give our best shot at it. We are not trying to get the best for ourself and we are not trying to make the world the way it should be. We are not valueing the life that we have. We are not giving it the importance that it deserves. We are accepting every crap that we see or that happens or that is thrown to us since we think that there is something that is more powerful than us, that we can't determine the world, that we can't make any difference. That we have to see and accept as it is.   Since we assume that we are not in control of our lives we are scaredtotake decisions, we are scared to take any new step in the directionthatnobody has taken. We are scared to live the life the way we want. We are scared to question the religion, the troubles that we have faced in our life has brought out such a fear in us that we do not question the divinity. We think we should be happy since the divinity above us has provided us more than what we deserve. And also that, all we got would not have been possible had it not been due to the blessing of the divine being. I wonder why are we scared to question, all through our lives we were alone, our family was alone, we faced all the troubles and we have comeout of it ourselves. Nothing from heaven above came to us. Whatever has come up, it has originated from within us. We are divine and we deserve the greatest of all possible things in life.  Regards, Sridev  -----Original Message-----From: Sunil Semwal [ mailto:Sunil.Semwal@oracle.com ]  Hi Sridev,  I almost wld like to reply to every sentence of urs.  But analysing one sentence of urs probably will answer most of ur Qns!  Why is that we do not pray the soul that brought you where you are.Doyou think that you are where you are today due to divine help orblessing.?  If I read this statement there r three entities1) We2) Soul3) God  You mean to say - We can pray our Soul for the position in which we areand not god probably bcos therez no divine help.  If I say - Soul = God. One who cannot know or understand Soul they name it externally as God.  Perhaps it answers few of ur Questions?Now therez lot can be pondered if u try to find each of the entity.whoz Godwhat the SoulWho is that We or I? (Most Important one)  tata,Sunil.  Nair, Sridev wrote:  "You mean to say - We can pray our Soul for the position in which weare and not god probably bcos therez no divine help."  Well! I did not mean this, I say that if you pray to get better prayyour soul. But I do not justfy praying to soul also. Thanks, Sridev  -----Original Message-----From: Sunil Semwal [mailto:Sunil.Semwal@Oracle.com]   I do not deny - Ayn Rands Objectivism rather it is bit similar to Vivekenands I concept. It is really gr8 if one really understands and realises it but after understanding properly what they mean when they refer to I. I do not want to speak on this now so let me continue by analysing ur other statements.  Why is that we blame all mistakes and failures on ourselves andall goodness and greatness to God? I do not agree with this.My experience is - Goodness and Greatnesss One (I) never thinks of God rather attributes to himself. (Proabably may say it but doesn't really feel so).on other hand - Mistakes, Failures, Problems - We do feel - Why Me, Why did God Choose Me or u call - Why only my Fate like this. We do not attribute this to ourself.  OTHERS - Just pick any of points from Sridevs mail, my mail or otherwise and put ur points.

No Sunil.&nbsp;  Others, please do not respond unless you feel strongly&nbsp;for or against it.

Its sad that one set of his followers worship him rather than understanding what he has to say. I am sure Siva Reddy sir would be happy if I learn VB rather than pray him each day.  Sunil/Phani/Anand/Phani Sundar/Keshav/Prakash, We can have this discussion in my blog, so that others are not disturbed. What do you say?  Regards,Sridev&nbsp;
