      Jill Scott concert was definitely off the hook. It was more than I could ask for. She took it there with the new lyrics and the old familiar hits. I absolutely can not wait until Aug 31 when the album drops. I can't even begin to explain the experience of Jill. She has some power packed lyrics, my God.  But I just got in from Philly. Tired. Not ready to do 4th Block YPs. Wishing I had something more important to do than return to USNA. Like trying to get a copy of some new Jill Scott.  But the home of Brotherly Love was indeed breathe taking from the hotel view. I love a downtowns skyline at night. Especially a big city.  JS fans have something in store that I know will be spinning on CD players for years to come.  Now I guess I'll slowly make the gradual change from part-time to full-time Midshipman tonight and plan for my return tomorrow.  "Living my life likes its golden..."

      Today, rather tonight, I will be seeing Jill Scott live in Philly. This has got to be a dream come true for me. First just to see her perform live. Something that I have missed out on in the pass couple of years, then to hear new material from her since her 2002 live release. I am so glad that the girl is making a comeback.&nbsp; So me and my cousin are making the drive to Philly today.   Also, it's my first blog entry. We will see how this things works out. I am excited to try something different.&nbsp; Since I am getting older, I am trying new things.&nbsp; But 24 is still young to me, but actually its a lil older to some of my friends, but that's alright.&nbsp;   Last night was a good one, went out with my cousin in DC. We had a good time, as we both like to do. Actually it was&nbsp;the first time that we went out together. It was wild!!

      I have really done it this time, I turned myself in, to USNA. I am finally back for good, at least for a while. Summer was good, but school better be better. Reform has come and still in progress, with its briefs and Microsoft virus loads. I have a busy day tomorrow, so I am cutting this one short. Must say that its good to see everybody's face again.

      Well I am back in the flow of Midshipman live here at the academy.  It has been hell adjusting to my wakeup time of 6:00 a.m., especially when it's hot and you can't sleep until 1:00 a.m.  But it's all good. I am heading out for the YP cruise of the year. Norfolk, Boston,  New York here I come. I am looking forward to the liberty. Another chance to get away. My summers now seem to be all about travel.  I enjoy, but I wish I was heavily compensated for it. One day.   I am ready to get the show on the road.  Ready to move on. But as of now, I'll take my leave of absence until I am able to check back in.
