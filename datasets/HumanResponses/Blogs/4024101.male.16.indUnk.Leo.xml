      charlie had been training full on for 2 weeks.now not caring about the wellbeing of the people he faced and how easily it was getting to kill them.the circular room changing size, colour and sounds.this was so charlie could get used to different environments.max (deep booming voice) had became very interested in charlies progress and pushed him harder every day."i belive your training is complete" claimed max.He sed this as charlie dropped another body to the floor.charlie looked up no longer the shocked look in his eyes but now more of a cool look as if he liked what he was doing.a smal door opened behind him and he walked through to meet max.whilst charlie was in cryo-genis status for 5 years body altering chemicals were introduced to charlies body.thus giving him super human qualities.eg the body to dislocate any and all body parts thus making him damn near impossible to beat in a&nbsp; fight,super strong(goes without saying),and strangly smart. i say strangly because the chemicals that were used were not supposed to give him this quality but max belived that his body had become so finely tuned that it had used some of the chemicals to highten his brain capacity.these were only a few for nearly all bodily functions had been improved.any way max was pleased with his progress and thought it was time for him to face another man who had had the same alterations.so max being the crack pot he was threw charlie back into this room but he was not alone this time.he could sense another in the room but could not see him.suddenly he fell to the floor with a&nbsp;sharp pain in his right cheek.he got up and looked around but could see noone.then he realised th9is was no ordinary opponent and he would have to use every ounce of training to kill this one.so charlie instinctively raised his arm to feel a&nbsp;thud below him.he looked down to see a bald man lying there smiling "he he gud one" he said and then he stood up.his name was patrick and he had been here the same amount of time and had taken the same training.charlie nodded in admiration and said " so then are we going to fight or chat all day" and a smile crossed his face.patrick too was smiling and the battle begun.they both backed away from each other and raised there arms into a karate style stanze. patrick took the first step forwards and their arms begun to move at each other both getting very good punches in.they then backed away again to regain their breathe both knowing that one of them would die.so the battle continued.charlie jump into the air dislocated his arms and begun to swing them around.true he was falling to the floor but ata&nbsp; slower pace and on the way down his right arm joined into the socket again and caught patrick right in the face knocking him flying into the wall.patrick rubbed the newly surfaced blood from his nose and stood up."is that all youve got" he sed.charlie returned with "im just getting warmed up".as is mentally they both changed their style of fighting this time aiming to break each others necks.but both being who they were coulddislocate their necks anyways so that pan failed.so charlie getting fed up yelled " lets finish this  ".and hearing this sent patrick backstepping a few steps because the sound of charlies voice had erupted a small earthquake below their feet.so patrick started to run at charlie and hit him right in the face sending charlies neck spinning around and then returning to the socket.charlie realised that the only way to stop this menace was to disable him entirely.sadly for patrick his brain size had not been enlarged so this plan never came into it for him.he was still aiming to break charlies bones.charlie had been standing still now for 10 minutes but patrick did nothing for he knew that if he did attack that would spell trouble with a capital T.charlie then changed his standing position and said " i know what i must now do".charlie was now wondering what he had been doing for the past 10 minutes. he was now about to find out.charlie ran at him and patrick braced himself but then charlie stopped still and looked at patrick and hit him right in the heart.now this stunned patrick and then sent him flying into the wall and straight through.he was now on the floor gasping for breathe and charlie came over and said "i noticed a slight weeze so therefore you have a heart problem" ."all i was&nbsp; doing for that ten minutes was listening to your breathe".patrick looking stunned at this said "finish me off then" so charlie lifted his foot up and stomped down sending partick through the floor and onto some steam pipes below.max was stood in the other side of the room looking shocked."not even i knew he had a heart problem"said max.and charlie turned to him and smiled."NOW my training is complete".

      it all began a day like any other .sunny and cloudy.any way charlie was walking down the street when he noticed a small note on the floor.he bent down too look at the note and it read "look behind you". So charlie stood up and turned around only to be greeted by a flying fist then a fading laughter "HEHE HE  HE"  .He then woke up in the back of a van with a blind fold on. then he went back asleep. the van pulled to a halt and he was carted out. the blind fold was ripped off and it took 2 seconds for his eyes to focus and he looked around to see nobody. but charlie was wondering who had taken the blind fold off. he thought about this for some time because he was sat in a round room with a camera.he moved his arms believing them tied but they were not so he stood up ,rubbed his eyes and looked around agen to see if anything new had appeared.but to no avail. he began pacing waiting for someone to enter the room. and then suddenly a deep booming voice spoke to him  "greeting ive been awaiting your arrival".  the sudden boom of his voice made charlie jump. the voice then stated that he had been in cryogenic stasis for 5 years and during this time his bodies functions had been hightened thus making him a world class fighter but charlie believed non of it.so the voice yelled " enter  " and a panel opened and a man stood in the room with him. the man said he was expendable because he had failed the organisation in the past .charlie was still shocked by all this and he sed " wot do you expect me to do about it". so the man who had recently entered the room tooka&nbsp; swing at him and charlies right arm blocked him with no second thought. the arm caught his ,came out of the socket and twisted around breaking the mans arm into pieces.charlie then let the limp arm hit the floor and thew arm returned to its socket.charlie couldnt understand how he had done that and inspected his arm but nothing looked out of the ordinary.then the deep voice said "  hahahaha very well done  " "  now finish him  " so charlie still stunned by all this walks up to the man and says " im very sorry about this " and the man with a withered arm says"its for the good of the organisation". so charlies arms  &nbsp;fly up and break the mans next in one swift turn and the mans lifeless body drops to the floor. the voice says "  enter  " and this time 3 people enter and charlie suddenly realised this was no joke.and the battle begun. one of the men moved forward to attack and charlie stepped back up against the wall.he uses his right arm to cover his face thinking he will be beaten up.but quite the opposite.whilst his right arm was blocking his face the left arm had begun fighting without charlie even thinkin about it.then charlies left leg throws it self at the mans leg breaking it in two for he had caught the knee cap and foced it back upon its self.the two other men looked on in horror.and ran from the room. the door shut and charlie heard two screams.and the voice said "  they were going to die one way or another".  so charlie no familiarised with his new being left thr room by the recently opened panel.he walked down a&nbsp; long corridor and when he reached the end he was in a big room full of cameras.some in his house,some in his car,some in his work and many on his clothes.a tall man stood there and sed " you were very good in there" &nbsp;" about the same as your son if not better".hearing this charlie s eys widened and he sed "MY SON" " but i thought he died in the war" the tall man sed "incorrect" " that was mearly a cover up" "but he had been in cryo-genic stasis for ten years and had the same treatment as you" "and we need your help to track him down and capture him".
