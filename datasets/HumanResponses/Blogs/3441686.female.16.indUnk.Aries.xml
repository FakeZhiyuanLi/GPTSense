      Have you ever noticed that life sucks? Or was that just me? I have no boyfriend as of lately, it seems like I never will again. No one is interested in me. I'm too boring, I guess. Then I have no friends. The ones I did have accused me of being a lesbian and spread it around the school. I got tormented because everyone thought I was gay. Yet, in all reality I am a heterosexual, I only like guys.   LIFE SUCKS!!

      Ever get tired of your parents? Yeah, me too! I hate the way they always act like they don't care what we do, only what the other one wants to do. Which always results in back and forth talk of "no you pick, I don't care"s.   I never want to end up like my parents. I would rather not be a parent. I love them, but I want to change some things. Don't you?

      Well, another summer is here and I hate it already. I know that sounds geeky and nerdy, but I am not! I hate school as much as I hate being out of school. I hate having so much time to myself and no relative structure to my life. See, I am one of those people who need a schedule to survive. If I had to figure out what to do everyday by myself, I'd go insane with all the possibilities.   Well, I played games on the computer all day and washed laundry for my mother. That was my life. Soon I will be cleaning house for my grandmother and slave-like working for her in the kitchen. Isn't my life grand!?!  I can't wait to leave to Oklahoma and California on Church Youth Trips. Even though that seems boring, it is better than this low level of living.   Now the only thing I can exert effort in is household chores and the Youth Newsletter. Wow, I can't wait!!!!

      Well, I was a chicken shit! I didn't tell Anthony that I liked him. All I did was ask him to sign my yearbook. I pouted and said I wasn't coming back next year. He said it was a bummer and that he would miss me. Then I started thinking that I should have given him my cell number. It sucked because I totally wanted to kiss him, but he looked so cute and perfect that I couldn't just blatantly kiss him. I don't know...I was too scared!

      Hey, today I had to go to school from 9:00-10:55. It sucked. Well, I think the only tests I did well on was Spanish and Computers. I have a Biology test next hour and I doubt I will do well. I have been slacking off lately. I am a straight "A" student. I haven't even been doing my work for half of my classes and I haven't studied for my final exams either. I can't do this next year at my new school, because they have a higher curriculum than this school. I will be S.O.L. if I go there and do this. Plus, my parents would whoop my ass, if they went through all that trouble to send me to that school and then I blow it off.   I am so freaking scared right now. I see my crush for the last time right after this class. I GOT A PLAN!  The plan is to ask him to sign my yearbook and then tell him that I have had a crush on him all year and thought I should tell him since I am not coming back next year. How do you think that will work...Who am I shitting? That won't work. We flirt and all, but does he really like me. I was thinking this is my first and last time to kiss him, I can't ruin the chance. I might not see him again. Damn! I don't know what to do. I will post when I get home and tell you what happened; If I did it or chickened out.

      Well, nothing much is going on today. I got out of school early, because today and tomorrow are my last days of school. I am at home doing nothing but watching nothing on TV.   Well, I am trying to pick my classes for next year. I am transferring schools to Mountain Pointe, but I am not sure what to take. The required classes are different than they were at South. I am confused at what I want. I am kind of thinking I don't want to transfer, but it's a little too late since I already have my variance request approved. I just need to register.   I know I failed most of my final exams today, I was too tired yesterday to even study. I don't know what's wrong with me. I have been so tired and worn out lately, it is pathetic. Well, that is what's happening.

      Well, I am new at blogging. Since my life is becoming chaotic, I decided to start a blog to vent out my ideas and problems. I trust you alone, everyone else would spread rumors. Thus, I am left to communicate with a computer in this unsociable manner.   Let's see! My church's youth group just finished having a Bazaar to raise money to go to camp this summer. We did fairly well in raising $1,500 before expenses; such as a porda poddy, dunk tank, food, prizes, etc... Yes, wasn't that day fun. Setting up booths to run, which got tipped over by a gust of wind. That was great! A hour before we were going to start, the whole set up got ruined. Thank God, that it was nice weather for May and we were able to have it outside without covering.   Dang! I was so stressed out yesterday, I almost cried. Dealing with Finals week at school, transferring to a new school next year, making up work for school, church, work, and on top of that trying to organize our youth's newsletter. I was brilliantly named the "Chief Editor" of it. I was so irritated with everyone. No one wanted to volunteer to write articles for the newsletter. Except one person and the youth pastors. It was horrible. I felt like no one was listening to my plans or ideas. No one cared what I thought. No one gave a damn. I still feel like that. The deadline for articles is next Sunday and I doubt they will even write anything. I don't want to be stuck writing the newsletter by myself because no one wanted to participate. Sometimes it feels like they don't respect me enough to care. Maybe it is my age...since I am 16 years old and all but one is older than me. I don't know anymore. I don't know what to think. I especially don't know what the youth pastors were thinking when they decided to set me in position to run the newsletter. I may be a good writer in English Honors, but I can't deal with all the pressure along with everything else. I am not a people person. Anyways, the newsletter should be cool, and they picked the most uncool person to run it...ME!

      Well, I just got back from camp in Oklahoma. I really enjoyed myself. It was hard to adapt to the environment at first...since camp is so chaotic. Kids staying up all hours of the night giggling, talking, keeping me awake. It was fun after I got used to it. I just wished I had a laptop to post daily what was going on. I was on my best behavior. I went to camp thinking, I was just going to hang out with the youth from my church. Which in fact, I didn't talk to them at all hardly. I made 3 new friends...David, Farrah, and Joshua. I liked Josh since the beginning, ever since I met him. He is sooo cute. He is taller than me which is a big plus... I am 5'8 and I hate to be taller than guys. He has shoulder length blondish brown hair. He has earrings in both ears; his earrings were balls. I told him I used to wear balls around my neck and tell the guys that my balls were bigger than theirs, then their ego would be wounded and they would end up getting bigger ones to show off...anyways, I said is that just a nod to your manlihood!   He is skinny which I always found hot. He is so funny. Has a great personality. He is awesome. I talked to him a lot after David and Farrah hooked up. I was following him everywhere...which was a first for me. I am usually so independent and secluded. However, when I met him, it was like I was drawn to him and couldn't get away. He began calling me his shadow and his lost puppy. He is 19 years old compared to me being 16 years old. So, at the time we can only be friends...but if an opportunity ever presents itself, I wouldn't mind being more. However, My father is so picky about guys, I have to learn about what he wants in life and his walk with God...just to satisfy him...even then his satification is questionable. I will tell more stories from camp later!

      Hey whats up! Long time no see. Ive been quite busy...no time to post. Well, the summer is almost over and the school year is almost here. I am a junior now at a new school...its great... a block schedule. 3 classes a day, an academic lab, and lunch; a class every other day...its awesome. Well, I am so confused about Josh. I like him a lot but he is  19 years old. I wish I could go to Oklahoma and see him. I miss him. He is a great friend and someone I like to talk to. I wish I knew if he liked me...I wish I was older...I wish I lived in Oklahoma. Well, until next time...
