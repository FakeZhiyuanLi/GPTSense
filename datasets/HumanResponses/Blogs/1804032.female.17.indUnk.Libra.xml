      This weekend was pretty good yesterday I went to starbucks pool for a neighborhood party it was entertaining. After we were done with the pool we went back to starbucks house and chilled. Me and Joe got these wooden swords and had a little sword fight going on I hit him in the rips a couple times he woudnt hit me which would of been ok b/c idc i was hitting him anyways...But I hate how ppl don't want to hit me because they think im fragile pisses me off, I don't like to be underestimated. I have to loose 5 pounds to apply for this modeling shit this is going to be my last time I ever go I swear. I always go and when they call back im to much of a pussy to go back but I will this time because I need some money, because getting a job is a bitch now and days, and I need a backup.  Well enouph about money after starbucks house we went to the movies, we were supposed to see underworld but the projector thing wasn't working so we saw once upon a time in Mexico and I don't regret it, it was a great movie I recommend it for anyone there's no sex scenes just a lot of killing and gore but the gore looks sorta fake. The blood coming from Johnny Depps eyes looked like it was stick on blood. My favorite quotes in the movie was "are u a Mexican or a mexicant" and "I don't think I drink" hahah I haven't seen a real good movie in a while. After the movie Amy and Hannah slept over and we watched the good girl it was ok but the story has no moral its basically saying you can lie and cheat then get away with it.  Im in a very weird mood lately to, evertime I talk to people for some reason Im finding out the real them and its not very good. Then I stare at them and see what they really look like...Its weird you would have to be me to get it; but I found out that a lot of people are changing and for the worst, its not even that they are growing up its that they are being influenced and I hate it. I know society will mold a person no matter what but I hate it because they are not molding into the real them there just mocking another persons behavior. I used to do the same thing but I cut myself off from that as soon as I found out what the hell I was doing and I tried my best to just be me. I think everyone should just be an individual but lately I have seen more spine on a jelly fish. Another thing that makes me mad is when people talk behind other peoples back I don't understand why they just don't keep to themselves or just say it to the persons face I mean I do most the time but maybe that's why people think im a bitch, but since when did truth and freedom of speech be something bitchy.

      welll i did alot this weekend so let me give u the basics of my week friday was adventruing but i forgot why and me and amy went to the movies and saw uptown girls wasnt a bad movie i enjoyed it then we went to wendys and had fries and a freezy thing wat a wierd combination. Then i went to her house and chilled for a lil bit talked about a bunch of stuff but i forgot and it was a very chilled friday i would say. SAterday her and aj came over so it was nothing but a's in the house amy aliyah aj hey hey, that was corny but o well. then me and aj made amy watch jeepers creepers and she hates scary movies LOL but i figured she can handle this one b/c jeepers creepers was a comey/horror i think well I thought it was funny. Then we tried to make a scary movie with my dog and two salad sticks lol but it wasnt very scary. james was supposed to comeover to but my parents didnt want alot of ppl they werent to happy about aj so if i said CAN james come over to my dad woulda shat a elephant. My belly button ring is finnally healing up and it doesnt hurt to much anymore. Jon or his friend or someone invited me to a homecoming in oakridge but its like 2 hours away so idk how im diong that im allowed to but its just that transport is a bitch and a half jon is my buddy but i dont think i can make that one but i will certainly try.  sunday wich is today i went fishing with my family like 8 in the morning i nearly died b/c i went to bed like 3 something at night im like NOOO fuck fishing...but i had fun anyways b/c i caught 2 bass woo hoo i never caught a bass in my life. The funny part was that the boat could hold 4 but for some reason the boat was sorta sinking anyways lol i guess cause my dads like 2 ppl or i must be fat but we went in with our half way sinking boat anyways and caught 5 bass one for each of us :-D. i still havent done my hw and i have a shit so i should start so i can go to bed early cause im tired as hell and my headachs are getting worse every day so its either cause i dont sleep or i need to get contax again WHOO knows by the way i have 20/20 visiion but i have stigmatism sooo thats y i need contax i can c just FINE. well going to take a nap now...

      hey dull day everyone very dull coudnt gey anny duller then this hopfully nate will take me and Danielle of campus and then she will have a whole pack a cigs we can smoke woo hoo...I cant smoke as often as i used to b/c of some technical difficulties. Well during this boring day of mine i realised alot of stuff number one friends are overrated in highschool ya there might be a couple that are your really good friends but this whole thing w/ highschool revovling around hw and friends is dumb...especially when half of your "friends" dont really give a shit you are probably reading this and saying like WHat the fuck you would have to be me to understand so if you thinking to hard dont bother. Second of all Life is ok sometimes but when your a teenager life could be better b/c my daily schedule here in nc is sleep, wake up, go to school, hw, sleep, wake up, go to school, hw and soon work will come into that sleep,wake up, go to school, work, hw...i meen it gets really boring. Then theres the weekend but since I only have like a couple friends i can hang out with now I cant hang out as often especially when amy has to go somewhere with joe or sometimes she can't do anything or Nicole having to hang out with her boyfriend I meen if those two cant hang with me Im not going anywhere for the weekend. Plain fact I love smoking and I think its rude and wrong to smoke around non-smokers so it sux for me that i can't smoke as often as i usually do when Im out but hey its all good smoking isnt good for you anyway but for me it puts umph into my life...atleast for as long as the cig last.  What I am really afraid of is if i loose the only two friends I can hang with what am I gonna do then sit on my big ass for everyweekend that comes by luckily I doubt that would happen they havent gotten seriously angry at me yet. Oh ya I hate guys not that Im going gay but they make everthing difficult and it would be nice to have a boyfriend but the only thing im missing out on is sex and I can have that next time jon comes back from military school or if i get really really horny...lets just say i got my sources. I have two plans for me when I get out of highschool one is Get married to wayne he wont say no since he says im like his air and he is already saying im his future wife, then dont work and have kids...:-/ no actually I dont wana make the same mistake my mom did, Im gonna go to college be a vet like i always wanted party as a single women till im ready to get married. You see if i had never wrote in this journal I woudnt even think about this...and keep leading wayne on until we get married AH no not happening when im ready and whoever i want im in noo rush...ya wayne is my baby i love that kid but im not even gonna think about getting married yet i might find someone i like better and im only a teenager i dont even know what love truly is or atleast shoudnt know. I think I am just rushing life i want it to get over with but its never over till you die unfortuantly its not like ok you have money your married and you have kids game over..its not that easy...for some of us.

      today was dull even though i was on adderoll wich got me a lil high but not like i wanted it i was more out of it and felt retarded more then anything else maybe b/c i took to much or i just got used to it b/c i took it alot last year who knows and i almost got caught today b/c my mom gave me the "i know ur on something" look but then i played it off really well or maybe she just gave up who knows. adam gave me back 2 dollars who knows when he will give me the rest idc anymore though whenever he gives it to me he gives it to me im not stressin im just not gonna ask him for anything again. First period i was sorta pissy bc ppl were calling me stupid and harrison kept doing that lil thing in my ear and scarin the shit out of me. by the way i  HATE  when ppl call me stupid and most ppl know this from experience...i still dont have a job and im supposed to be getting my licence between next week and the 23rd and my car. and then ill have some freedom ppl dont think my family is strict but u gotta live in my house to c wat i meen. i actually finished all my hw today except math but i coudnt do it anyway b/c my books in my locker i dont like carrying books home its annoying. im failing english so who knows how long ill be able to keep my licence to hopfully ill bring it up before the semester ends

I just started pondering that cause my mom asked me why i rush to do everything and she was like your aunt rushed to do everything and she died at an early age...then she asked me if i think im gonna die early like im supposed to know..shes been acting really wierd lately and she went to church with my aunt this morning saying it was for her school project or some shit and she dresed in all black like she was going to a funeral..and she started emailing me all these things about how bad men are and  what married women think about there husbands and stuff..maybe its just me but she seems diffrent.  I got my cell phone my car a job...now in need my licence and a parking space and im good to go..i think im having a relapse before i was like everyone has there faults and now im like why can more people just be like me god there so fuckin annoying. now im back to hating people with a passion back to my violent thoughts.  But just as how it cant rain all the time it cant be all sunshine all the time either.  Winters coming...great...i hate winter by the way...

      WELL hey there, im in a good mood becouse I had a great high last night...tripping on coriciden.  hahah i had a huge converstation with my stuffed animal fifi that i had like my whole life...and i swear to god she was like smiling and lauphing back. Then i layed on my bed and i thought i hurd music playing but idk where it was coming from idk and for the first time i wasnt even paranoid about being high like i thought my parents would catch me or something i was just like relaxed and enjoying myself. My favorite part is when it first hits you when it starts to end it sux cause i started getting a headach...bud doesnt do that to you i need some bud..enouph about drugs. my cell phone is reactivated so now i can call people without my parents knowing who or when im talking on the phone.

      WHY can't I have a decent weekend...whats up with this...its a fucking conspiracy. Last weekend I worked and went nowhere this weekend I went no where and you want to know the cause of this...MY MOm Period..and Im not even going to get into it. One more year till im 18 THANK GOD and so far this year is going by pretty fast so I'll be 18 in no time. I just need my licence and im free from 5 am to 9 pm after 6 months im free and when im 18 i no longer have to ask my parents if i can go somewhere but waiting on all this shit is getting on my nerves...ive been waiting for this almost all my life and its almost here and it feels like its taking longer then when I was 10.  I got my phone reactivated now i only have like 26 dollars...so much for my drug money i cant wait for my paycheck next week. I worked so much these past 2 weeks im probably going to be a millionair...haha no I wish. By the way the thing that pisses me off the most is when someone says "you wana hang out tommorow" and they never call you or something comes up and when you call them to see whats up there like ya you called what do you want..uh well let me think dipshit. God i fuckin hate people sometimes if it was legal to kill id be in hell.

      Well i havent had the best weeks but for some reason this week was a lot better and its not even b/c of my weekend its b/c i came to the realization that i am stuck and i should appreciate what i have for now cause there are alot other people bad off. And as soon as i got to that relization and stopped trying so hard everything was relaxed i was more social and happy and less fuckin cranky. And FUCK groups by the way there a waste of time i hang out with whoever i want when i want. i dont have a certain group of friends i just hang out with my friends or whoever i know. Well my attitude is better but my grades arent school is just not my thing. I had a pretty good weekend to, friday i went to ajs and chilled there it was pretty fun the best part of the night is when we went outside and i skateboarded i have pretty good balance with the skateboard i just cant turn haha or do tricks but practice makes perfect. Then we went in this tunnel and it was completly black and it was so trippy b/c i had like no idea where i was going so i kept focussing on the light at the end and for a second i felt high or something and starbuck is pretty fuckin funny when hes ready. Then saterday i went to jordans and i had taken coriciden before i got there b/c i didnt think i was gonna get high or anything so the coriciden was my back up and it wasnt kicking in so i forgot about it and i drank and smoked bud and bam it hits me and it was great i was numb as fuck though and i coudnt understand what people were saying or even if they were talking to me when it started wearing off i had a humoungouse headache though. Then i had sex with my boyfriend i didnt feel much b/c i was to fucked up but i still liked it.  I met jordans girlfriend to i met her before but i didnt really talk to her and shes really nice in fact i love her :-D shes the best.   The lunar eclipse was pretty fuckin cool to look at to it was pretty damn surreal.. well the whole god damn day was but thats my lil weekend. For the first time it didnt feel like dull old nc and by the way i love christina cause she got me a half 8th and i only gave her 20 dollars.

      My day was pretty bad this past week and i rather not get into it. Today i got written up for work and i didnt even care they said i was 10 dollars short i have no idea how that could happen just did...they probably think i stole it or something they already accused me of stealing cigeretts, selling to minors, taking to many breaks, and coming in to tired...im starting to hate work...along with school...thats like the two main things in my life wich is pretty god damn sad for you whole life to revolve around work and school. Yup thats my life nothing special i hate it and im trying to like it because everyone is saying im so "blessed" but if im so blessed why do i feel like shit half the time...i just dont feel normal or ever feel like i can fit in and it sux...i have a couple examples and im not gonna say any names that just causes drama this is fuckin highschool. last year there was always a problem for me to sit with some people they said they didnt want a whole bunch of people sitting there and when i did sit there when i talked no one listened, i am nothing. This year i only know one person in lunch that i can stand and we always sit elsewhere even though we know these other people that we could sit by. Its only when im not around this person sits at that table god knows why...i guess im nothing or to ashamed to shit with...who fuckin knows all i know is that i wish i was someone else... someone that has an adventures life somone with self confidence that doesnt go day to day doing the same thing over and over again. My basic plan for my life based on my parents ....pass school, go to a good college, make good money...if it was up to me id already drop out and work full time in some grocery store living it up and killing myself with cigeretts and drugs day by day.  I dont really give a livin fuck about money or my future i just want to live get it over with and fuckin die already... no i dont want to kill myself i just find that to cowardly and to easy. No i dont cut...why should i hurtmyself with a knife i can do that with cigs its a waste of time.  No i dont have suicidal thoughts i just feel like a souless person walking amoungst a bunch of morons.  Oh ya and i hate when someone likes you and doesnt say shit just say it already its not like the person doesnt suspect it already...well thats my story for the day have a great fuckin rest of the day.

      WELL YAAA....so far my mentallity on life isnt any better im trying though i had a pretty bad day yesterday i went to the movies with hector and we went into the wrong movie theater so we didnt even watch the whole movie then we went to see last samurai but it wasnt ending till later so i decided WELL FUCK let me just call my mom becouse she says i have no consideration for her. sHE IS always wants to know why i got out late well i just happen to like night better then day wats so hard to understand...but she says she has to pick me up wich she doesnt she just chooses to b/c my friends could always give me a ride there and back. So becouse the movie was ending late i just said let me prove her wrong and ask her to call me to pick me up. So i only hung out for about 40 minutes not even an hour.  Then i try talking to my dad about the way i feel on my life right now and he takes it all the wrong way and starts yelling at the top of his lungs i didnt even hear wat he said all i hurd was ADFLJADF;AJF;AJDF;LJK and it drove me crazy and i jumped out the truck.  I didnt die b/c im writing in this journal now i just hurt my elbow a lil bit but im fine and kicken...i usually wont do shit like that but idk it was like a quick reaction the ones u cant help, just like if you get hurt u curse or scream.  Then i got home and just cried and cried and cried to sleep b/c i dont understand why everyone abandons me. They always leave me. I had like one friend i remember in elementry school and we promised to be friends forever and all of a sudden i go to her house one day and shes not there or her mom or their car and i kept going back but she never answered so i figured she just moved. But i dont understand why she didnt call me or say she was moving. My friends in middle school were always mad at me becouse of something or i always pushed them away and they were pretty cool but after i got into highschool i never hurd from them again. Then my aunt died and i was expecting her for thanksgiving that year becouse she promised shed come. And she was so cool i loved her i wish she was my mother no offense to the one i have now i love my mom but i always imagined how cool it would be to be her daughter.  Then i had a best friend and idk wat happend to that shit happend and all of a sudden we are not best friends anymore i miss that though it was always fun and there was always something new and life wasnt so fuckin boring.  I also had a crush on this boy once in highschool i was in love with the kid and he talked to me for a little while and all of a sudden he stoped talking to me.  I Cant keep friends around for very long and i dont know why. I also have some friends i loved to be with just recently and everyone started falling apart and i was excluded i meen they say there still my friend and shit but it doesnt feel the same i dont feel like i am with them anymore.  I also have a boyfriend and i understand he works a whole lot but on his days off if you like somone why dont u call why dont u figure out something for us to do together.  Sometimes i feel like he doesnt even want me. but idk.  Everyone tells me im pretty and i look in the mirror and to me i do look pretty most of the time but when i go away from the mirror or just like get out in public i feel ugly and i dont know why i just wish i always had a mirror to see myself in front of me while im in public i woudnt feel so bad.  I JUST FEEL SO FUCKIN REJECTED and i dont know what i do to deserve it.

      I always have alot of shit to say but i never say it i just keep it in my mind and id love to express it but i dont do a good job at that.  I hate people i hate life and many people tell me that i hate everything well maybe thats true but what is there to like.  What sux the most about me is that i care about people and yet hate them but thats not the point...the point is that i look out for everyone and noone gives a living shit about me i meen ok i was there for you i listened to you so why cant you do the same in return. And just recently i watched tuck everlasting cause i was fucking bored out of my mind and it was about this family that drank some holy water or some shit and they can live forever.  Then this evil guy wanted to buy out the  forest so he can sell the water to people becouse no one wants to die...but why not.  WHO THE FUCK WOULD WANT TO LIVE FOREVER! Me personally i woudnt kill myself or anything even though i have thought about it but i can not wait for the day i die the only reason i woudnt want to is becouse my mom and people that love me will get hurt.  I Guess maybe thats why i push people off and take so much risk.  Well i used to have a best friend but it was so difficult so i decided just one day drop it well its not really like i had a choice and all but i could always go back now but i never do.  Oh ya and my parents are good parents but i wish i just lived with me and my mom wich is probably something bad to say but my dad always gives me a hard time and it drives me to another cigerette b/c he acts like he doesnt even like me and he treats me like im fuckin 2 and even if i do everything right in his eyes im always doing something wrong...i hate him...well i woudnt say hate him but hes just one of those people i cant get along with father or not president or not movie star or not.  To me mother father w/e there still people that shit and eat like everyone else so why should i kiss there ass? And here is the answere everyone would give me ...b/c they take care of you well what if i dont want to be taken care of its not like i really have a choice especially with them b/c they dont let me do shit on my own. I DO MY OWN FUCKIN LAUNDRY AND THEY SAY IM SELFISH and i should do everyone elses. So just b/c i want a lil independence i do everyone elses.  Well i got to go now.

And I am so sick and tired of people telling me there are other people worst off becouse im seventeen and no offense i dont meen to be meen but i really dont give a crap thats not me why should i feel sorry for other people this world is fucked up and always will be fucked becouse nobody cares and even in there are some people that do its never enouph b/c the majority of the world is selfish.  wEll i know i probably said this a million times i always bring up how i stoped smoking well guess what i lied i cant stop becouse im to angry and when im angry i need a cig and when im bored i need a cig and when im to excited i need a cig and when im sad i need a cig and when im fustrated with life i need to cig. I feel so unwanted .... i hate that feeling its the worst in the world.  I just hate winter. I also have a boyfriend hes cool and everything but if you have a boyfriend they wana spend time with you my boyfriend doesnt he just thinks if he hangs with me one day hes like good for a couple days then he can call me the next day. I just think i make all the fuckin effort to hang with this kid sometimes i think is it even worth it.. he asked me himself "why do you wana be with me?" and idk i really dont i just like him around. maybe im complaining to much i dont even fuckin know...something is seriously wrong with me idk why i cant just be fuckin happy .FUCK.

      Today was great it would be even better if kia called me i have come to a realization that i love that boy haha i thought it about a while im like do i even like him? and im like wait wtf i love him ahha he makes me feel good. He puts some control in my life.  I got accepted into an art school today so im doing that for a year and it will put some credits in my college and i can get a scholarship :-D. ya i quit smoking cigs pills but now i gotta stop smoking but the bad thing about that is that i like smoking weed and dont want to give it up that much.  Sometimes i tell myself i dont like it but then i remember holy shit that plant is fuckin awsome. Ya anyways i made nicole a cd and made another cd for me there both pretty hott.  I have no hw well i have review but when did i ever do review? when have i ever studyied for a test...im hoping and praying that ill pass all my classes this year im not really trying that hard to pass but if im lucky wich im not ill pass all of them. 2 goals is to get my fuckin licence and get a's b's and c's next semester make my ma happy i got some good grades for once but i say this all the time but w/e ill try again. Thats what i always to keep trying to make the soccer team, keep trying to pass my driving test, keep trying to quit cigs, keep trying to get a decent guy, keep trying to get a real good friend let me shut up cause i can go on forever...well im done

      Ya havent wrote in this in a while i think...anyways life is pretty good i meen learned to just accept wat i got you know.  The only thing thats knew is that i quit taking pills and now im trying to quit cigs because im trying out for soccer and i need my lungs in better shape i only have 2 months to try to quit.  Ive been saying im gonna quit for a while but this time im dead seriouse.  I had a cold for a lil while but i think its gone now pretty much its at the point where its no longer contagious. Hopefully ill probably go to the mall today with my boyfriend me and him are getting along much better i think.  And this week i had come to the realization that some people will never grow up but just stay the same no matter wat happens to them and i cant get along with someone like that...i get along better with younger people or grown people never anyone my age wich i find wierd. My cousin and his wife might move down here and if they do there coming to visite us every weekend :-D YAY! i never met my cousins wife before but i hurd shes my height 5'1 "short people represent."   and wats really odd is that my cousin is like tall as hell  they are seriously like opposite. But opposites attract. well im done writing in this shit later

      I dont remember the last time I wrote in this thing according to this blogger shit it was tuesday dec 30th that was almost a month ago hah.  I usually just write in this to complain but lately i had nothing to complain about.  Im trying not to be so fuckin depressed and sad all the time and ya i have been workin on that for a while and u dont need anti-depressents to help you or atleast thats what I think.  Well i met some new boy named lee hes really sweet and ill probably hang out with him one day probably this weekend. Me and my boyfriend get along most the time i think its just me though that starts all the arguments. But im begginning to ponder if he really likes me for me becouse all he wants is sex and pleasure from me i meen wtf if someone likes you for you then they shoudnt want that of you all the time but ya anyways...it just snowed recently and so far we got the whole week off except for friday but if wake county is absolutely stupid (which they have proved already by giving us monday tuesday wensday and thursday off) theyll give us friday off to. Then its supposed to snow AGAIN on monday and tuesday and did i mention how much i hate snow im like the grinch when it comes to snow. Everyone is like YAY SNOW ya its white its pure its pretty all that good bullshit but if you think about it its wet fuckin cold as all hell and slippery and it gets people in accidents WAT IS SO PRETTY ABOUT THAT. The worst of it all my car doesnt start when ice gets in it and when its enouph snow i cant get out of my driveway wich meens im stuck at home :-D how fun.

      A lot of shit has happend to me these past 2 months. I quit my job so i no longer work at foodlion and the reason i quit is becouse i was tired of there bullshit. There always telling me "SMILE aliyah" i fuckin smile when i have a customer not when no ones around wat am i crazy.  I told them i cant work on sundays and they had me work on sundays they dont pay me enouph for that bullshit.  They were supposed to give me a raise a fuckin while ago i saw someone work with me almost the same time i started and all of a sudden is a manager and i was still getting payed 6.50 an hour. So fuck that shit.  Then i broke up with my boyfriend (this is all in the same weekend by the way) b/c i didnt feel he appreciated me enouph i just dont think i desearve that.  He felt like it was an obligation to call me atleast once a week or hang out with me, i meen if u like somebody u would want to call and u would want to hang out u shoudnt feel pressured or forced to do it u know.  Then later on i find out he talks shit behind my back...um say  that to my face pussy..and then he calls me at one on a school day...and i know he was home his friend told me and then i think he called again when i was home but i just got back from an accident and my dad didnt want me to deal with him i was already stressed... but anyways i call him back and the fucker says he didnt call...um pussy...i hate that shit i dont know why he just doesnt say he called i know he did man up god damnit...but ya so fuck that.   Then i got in a car accident in the STUPIDEST WAY.. ok the person in front of the car i hit made a suddent stop then they made a sudden stop i guess and i put on my radio b/c it was muy quite in the car and then nicole screams my name and the accident was right there in front of me waiting to happen...thats y u never take ur eyes off the road not even for 2 secs b/c i only really looked down for 2 secs didnt know all that would happen.  But ya the air bags came out smoke was all over the car and then i pulled over to the side and everyone got out...then i see this guy with his head bleeding i felt like complete shit...but i didnt over react or anything or scream or yell or cry i just called the cops said there was an accident and it was my fault.  But ya no serious damage i just got bruises from the seatbelt and one on my leg i dont know how i got and one on my arm i think from the air bag or something...and everyone was wearing there seat belt so no one in my car got injured other then bruises...but the guy that busted his head got 3 stiches.  I felt pretty bad for that but u live and u learn and u get loves and i consider me being lucky b/c it coulda been worst. Like not to long before these 3 kids got in an accident with a truck and totallly damaged the car 2 of them died and the girl is being charged with murder b/c she had more then 1 person in the car or some shit like that bc she had her provisional licence idk but ya shes being charged and i think its gay b/c she didnt purposly do it she wasnt looking to kill anybody or get in an accident..thats why they call them accidents bc there accidents.  Ya but hopfully shit will get better soon bc "it cant rain all the time".

      Ey well wat do you know blogger changed pretty funky if i say so myself. Sorta makes me wana change my journal up a lil bit think im getting tired of seein purple.  Well uh this weekend was pretty chilled didnt really do anything didnt mind b/c i needed a weekend to myself.  Jamal was supposed to pick me and shacara and jason up to go to the buck 50 or just come over and chill at my house but he didnt and he didnt call or say anything. I had to call his ass to find out where he was and if he was coming and i was already dressed.  So hes like nah i canceled it i didnt get mad or anything im trying to control my anger for people becouse everyones diffrent. But he text's me like 2 a clock in the morning i wasnt really sleeping anyway so i told him he could call but i was still cranky b/c i was trying to sleep and i coudnt.  Ok im gonna put this in story book mode so everyone can understand.  *ring ring* Aliyah picks up the phone "hello" "are you mad at me" says jamal (ahahah i like this its fun) "no, i dont care you do wat you want but i think u could atleast called so i didnt have to get ready or make other plans other then that i dont care its all good" aliyah says.  That is the first time i ever kept my cool when shit like that happend to me i give myself a pat on the back.  I am trying to be more approachable and less bitchy to people becouse i was nice before middle school.  So i wana be back nice but not to the point where people take advantage of me like they used to.  I have a new guy we are not going out yet but we are just focused on us. And so far its pretty cool hopfully it will stay cool.   One more week and a half left of school woo hooo. And this week is gonna go by pretty fast b/c thursday i am going to school late bc i have a court case and friday im coming out of school early cause im going to the beach    :-D.  And the whole week is just review and shit not really any hw and im gonna try to go out all week. Well im gonna go and check wat cars my dad is looking at now on ebay smooches.
