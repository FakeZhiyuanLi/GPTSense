      I lose my internet service tomorrow and then I am moving later this week to the west end.  My phone number will be 431-4106.  My cell number is 440-3230.  I don't expect to have internet at the new apartment for awhile, but I will try to keep up with my various online communities.  I don't know if I'll make it to the burlesque meeting this week, but I hope to.  Alright, see you around, everyone!

      The burlesque meeting last night was kinda productive, I think.  Going over the manifesto was a good idea.  Here are some thoughts that I have on it:  - I'm a lot happier with "We believe in live entertainment outside of the BOX," rather than "versus the BOX."  I always felt that line was alienating and unnecessary.  To me, the "box" was television.  Now it seems to encompass more.  Before it seemed to say "television is wrong," which has nothing to do with our shows.  It's like "We believe in live entertainment versus George Bush."  Yeah, no kidding, but that really has nothing to do with us. Anyway, I like it better now.  - I had to leave before a decision was made on the eigth and final item in the manifesto.  Personally, while I can see all sorts of ways to interpret it wrong, or be offended by it, I think it should stay.  Changing "mink" to lace or something would be fine, but I think leather should stay because it represents bad-assedness.   I like the wording of the statement because it says that we are both low-brow and high class.  We ballroom dance while flashing our crotches.  There is a duality, and duality is a big part of what we do.  We have all adopted second identities for the show.  We go to school or work by day, and once every few months we get together to arouse the people of Halifax. Mostly I think this part of the manifesto is important because it is funny, and this list needs humour, especially after a serious list.  It will assure people that, while we are serious about what we do, we also have fun and want you to have fun.  We aren't uptight about it. My only concern with it is that maybe it gives the wrong kind of person the wrong idea.  There are always creeps at the shows, and I worry that implying that we are promicuous sluts that can't go too low is the wrong message.  I think some men see it as a green light to treat us like prostitutes.  I know I've dealt with some creeps after shows, and other girls have too.  It's just a thought.  Perhaps we should have more emphasis on the empowerment and less on the promiscuity.  - Finally, I stressed at the meeting that it is important that the society decide which way it's going to go in regard to dealing with the community.  We have two choices: we can say "we believe that what we are doing is important and positive and we want to tell you why" or we can say "we put on shows for our own enjoyment and we hope you enjoy them too."  In other words, we enage in dialogue with the community to educate them on what we are doing, and embrace our role as activists, or we respond to criticism by saying basically that we are just putting on shows, and it's not for everyone, and we aren't trying to be a feminist movement, we just want to have some fun. Either way, something has to be added to the manifesto that states our position.  I gotta go to work.  Let me know what you think!

      Yesterday was a really good day off.  Matt and I went out to Herring Cove to walk around near the ocean for awhile.  Then we went to Mexico Lindo's for lunch, which is so good.  Then Matt had a band practice and I chilled out at home and packed a little.  Then we went to the Atlantic Streetdance Competition, which was the best.  We were there for four hours, but we didn't want to leave.  It was so entertaining.  I want to go to one of those every weekend.  There were so many hot dancers.  And there were 17-year-old breakdancing twins!  Something is hot about that.  I mean...in a few years something is hot about that.  It was an awesome way to spend a Saturday evening.  It's a good thing that Matt and I ate a big lunch, though, because the competition ran longer than we expected.  It's such a nice day.  I want to go outside and enjoy it a little.  I just got home from work, so I'm really tired.  It's always so busy at work on Sundays.  In crazy hockey news, a player for St Louis was arrested for hiring a hitman to kill a "male acquaintance" whom many believe was actually a gay lover.  Crazy!  That just isn't the sort of thing that you read everyday in hockey news.  Anyway, I'm gonna eat some springrolls.

      I'm tired of debating the merits of everyone's personal take on feminism, so instead I am going to post another recipe.  This is the recipe for ginger cookies that I use at work.  They are the best ginger cookies I have ever tasted; possibly the best cookies I have ever tasted period.  Ok, here goes:  3/4 cup butter 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup molasses 1 egg, lightly beaten 2 cups flour 2 1/2 tsp baking soda 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp cloves 1 tsp ginger Candied ginger, about a handful (optional)  Beat sugar and butter together.  Mix in molasses.  Mix in egg.  Add flour and spices.  If you like, you can add a handful of candied ginger, cut into small pieces, to make them extra good.  Roll into balls, about an inch in diameter.  Put on a baking sheet  well spaced!   These cookies get very big when cooking, and even bigger when they cool.  Pour granulated sugar over the cookie balls.  Now flatten the balls a little with your palm.  Cook in an oven at 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes.  When you take them out they will be kind of fluffy, but will flatten out as they cool.  Yum!  Ginger cookies!  If you want you could substitute shortening or margarine for the butter...but, as a baker, I can't recommend it.

      So, as promised, here are some of my general views on feminism.  When I was at Mount Allison, one of my women's studies professors asked the class, a large, mostly female class, how many of us would consider themselves to be feminists.  Only about two or three of us raised our hands.  It was alarming and depressing, but I suppose I should have expected it.  Feminism is so misunderstood.  I did a lot of feminist reading in university, and one thing I learned for sure is that feminist theory is all over the place.  My own version of feminism starts with the strong belief that it is not anti-male.  There are masculine and feminine traits embodied in every person.  The problem is that feminine traits have been given a lower value because men have always been the dominant sex.    The feminism that I really don't agree with is any that continues to de-value feminine traits.  For example, a woman should not stay home and raise her children because she should be working to advance her career.  Raising children, somewhere along the line, has become recognized as a lower form of work.  Women's work.  To me, this is ridiculous because every person with kids, male or female, should want to do nothing more than spend time raising them.  But of course adults have to work to make money to raise a family.  All I am saying is that when I have children, I hope I am lucky enough to either be a full-time mother, or have a job that still allows me to spend a lot of time with my children.  The need to put your own career and status over the need to nurture your children is a masculine trait.  I don't mean it's something that only men do, or that all men do, but it's the opposite of the innate feminine need to care for other people.  I am also against any feminism that dictates what women should and shouldn't do.  I don't consider myself to be any less a feminist because I spend money on make-up, or shave my body hair, or wear uncomfortable shoes sometimes.  I enjoy wearing make-up.  I like the art of make-up.  I like having smooth skin.  I like to look glamorous sometimes.  Not to attract men, just because it makes me feel good.  Even if it ever is to attract men, that's ok because  I am attracted to men.   When it comes down to it, we are all here to find a mate, just like every other creature on the planet.  I can't help that I want men to find me attractive.  I can't help being attracted to men.  But I am very particular.  I guess I could sum up my views by saying that because all people hold masculine and feminine qualities, the main goal of feminism should be to make people re-evaluate feminine qualities.  Make them as important as masculine ones.  When that happens, so many of the world's problems will begin to be solved.  War, for instance, is the most obviously masculine tool.  It cannot hold anything feminine because it destroys rather than nurtures.  It is fast, and cold, and is only a display of brute power.  And also, I  hate  the term "feminazi."  It is so damaging to the cause.  That word came up immediately when my professor asked the class who would call themselves a feminist.  It makes me so angry.  It's also lazy and dismissive.  It's hard to get past the stereotypes.

      The controversy!  Burlesque under fire!  Well, I've got some things to say.  First I want to explain my own act.  When I was growing up I was a major tomboy, but at the same time loved my Barbie dolls, loved wearing pretty dresses, etc.  I never really fit in with other girls, though.  In high school I was into masculine things: sports, violent movies, video games and really "male" music.  In university my feminine side started to fight back and I have since lost my interest in violent movies and I have a different view of hockey (some of those players are so clearly in love with each other...why don't they just kiss and get it over with?).  So I am left with these two sides of my personality.  I wanted to show that in my acts at the last show.  It was done in a very silly way, because I have a hard time doing things that aren't silly.  Even though both acts were ridiculous, I felt sexy in both roles.  And they both felt like I was being myself.  It was a very comfortable burlesque show for me.  I also like doing an act with my boyfriend (who I met at a burlesque show).  In the "Big Top Burlesque" show I said that Matt and I were doing the act that the squares could be comfortable with.  Something for the parents.  Since the last show I have been talking with my friends about what future shows might hold for me.  I said that I felt I should branch out from the comfortable acts I have been doing.  Then I changed my mind.  If I were to do, say, an act with lesbian overtones, it would be a damn lie.  It wouldn't be an expression of my sexuality at all.  I went down to pasties in the last show (actually a little less than that!), which I never thought I would do until recently.  I've been overweight since I was ten years old and have never liked my body.  I read too many of those fucking teen magazines when I was a kid.  Watched too many music videos.  How often do you get to see a chubby girl being sexy?  Not often enough, I'll tell you.  When it was suggested to me before the Pasties and Petticoats show that I be in it, I said no even though I  really  wanted to.  My thought was basically that "no one wants to see this thing jiggling all over the place."  But I did it, and I loved it, and I got nothing but positive feedback.    Among the comments were people telling me that I was "really brave" for going up there.  And this would sometimes be from other performers so they didn't mean it is brave in general for girls to perform in burlesque shows.  They thought I was brave because I'm not slim.  At first it seemed like a back-handed compliment to me, but then I realized that it makes it all the more worthwhile for me to be doing these shows.  The cause that I have been most vocal about over the years is to stop media images that make young girls hate their bodies.  When I was in grade school, I was certain that I would never get a boyfriend.  I was so depressed and insecure.  In high school I found out that a boy had a crush on me, and I couldn't believe it.  Then another boy had a crush on me!   It made me second-guess everything I had believed about boys and what they think about women.  I stopped reading women's magazines in high school and started to think of myself as an attractive person. What I am saying is that these burlesque shows allow me to try to show that you don't have to be thin to be sexy.  You don't have to be  anything  to be sexy!  Anyone can be sexy!  In short, I went down to pasties because I  wanted  to go down to pasties.  I wanted to make pasties, and I wanted to wear them because it's totally fun.  I like being sexy.  I like fish-nets and thigh-highs and negligees and high heels and red lipstick.  And I like them all together.  So that's about why I did my act.  I'll write about my personal feminist beliefs later.  My fingers are tired.

      So tired.  I went out to Bayer's Lake after work today and hit up Value Village, Winners and Zellers.  Got some great stuff at V.V.  Got some more Archie comics to turn into magnets.  Got a fan-fucking-fabulous book on breakdancing from 1984.  It's, like, magnet city.  I'll be photocopying it though because it would be a crime to cut this book up.  I like the idea that you could actually learn this from a book.  I also got a nice satin polka-dot skirt.  That was a good find.  It was Steph's find.  She is the best person to second-hand shop with.  I got a pizza cutter at Zellers.  And 32 rolls of their cheapest toilet paper.  I got lots of cool stuff today, but it would be dull to list it all.  The skirt will look better if I lose about 10 pounds.  Luckily, that is my current goal, although it is the same goal I've had since I was 10 years old. I don't really worry about my weight that much.  I mean, I've done alright with it.  I've been in three long-term relationships so it's not keeping me from getting love.  I think of it as a barrier that keeps the creeps away and only lets quality guys get to me.  All three of my long-term relationships have been with guys named Matt, though.  My conclusion: Matthews like their big-booty girls.  Anyway, that sort of went off on a whole unexpected thing.  Let's get back to the topic at hand...which is nothing...so I'm done.

      I find this blog thing a little frustrating.  I guess I'm just used to my livejournal.  I like having this blog for local news and discussing things that are actually going on in my life.  The LJ is more for my various obsessions and widespread pop culture phenomenons.  I think I accidently deleted an entire blog entry from yesterday.  It's gonna take me some time to master this thing.  Boy I'm sleepy.  Gotta get up at good ol' 5:30 in the AM again tomorrow to make muffins and such for the nice people.  I think people believe that muffins are a healthy alternative to other baked goods but they are so incredibly wrong.  I stay away from them.  I don't eat a lot of what I bake.  Some of it is really really good, though.  The ginger cookies are particularly delicious.  And the scones.  Today I made a vegetarian chilli and some cornbread to serve with it.  The cornbread was melt-in-your-mouth good.  I had a little piece when i was cutting it into squares.  I must post the recipes for it sometime.  And the chilli.  And the ginger cookies.  I work in a bakery and Matt works in a candy shop.  If we had kids their heads would explode with happiness.  If we had kids we would be living in a cardboard box.  Ok, so I think that I am definitely going to take some sort of arts-and-crafts type course this summer so I can learn how to make stuff.  It's just a matter of choosing the right one.  Basically I am trying to avoid giving up completely and going to culinary school.  I know I love to cook, and I know I am pretty good at it, but it isn't what I want to spend my life doing.  What  do  I want to do?  I want to  ROCK!

      I'm leaving to go to my parents' house for Easter dinner in a few minutes.  I'm getting some packing done right now.  I just did the most important part of any move: taking apart my Lego.  Steph and Tracy are coming over for dinner tonight too.  Just my family, Matt, Steph and Tracy.  Yay!  I think I have an idea for the next burlesque show.  Actually, I have a couple.  I am hoping that my band, The Stolen Minks (with Steph, Tina and Erica Butler) can play some rock-a-billy and maybe some performers would like to rush out on stage and dance and take their clothes off and get rowdy while we play.  Then we can tear our clothes off, maybe.  I think that would be cool.  Plus, live rock music is cool.  And, yes, we are as cool as the band name implies.  It'll be confusing, though.  I already have a stage name for the burlesque shows, and I also have one for the band (Roxy Goldbrick).  Too many fake names!!!

      I haven't mentioned this yet, but Matt got a really great haircut the other day.  He got it all cut off and now it's really short.  I think it's hot.  Now people might stop mistaking him for a girl.  No more will people say "excuse me, ladies," when trying to get by us.  No more will drunk men ask Matt to dance in bars after I reject them.  It's a golden new era in our relationship.  What a nice day!  It's making me so excited for the upcoming summer months.  I love this time of year (but who doesn't?).  Ah, relaxing day off with nothing to do.  Matt just left for work after making a chickpea loaf for the Easter dinners we will be attending.  Neither his parents nor mine will be making a vegetarian entree for him, so he provides his own.  I'll do some more packing and cleaning today, I suppose.  I have some magnets to cut.  I want to take them to Venus Envy on tuesday.  I've also been thinking about bringing some of them to Strange Adventures and possible Plovers.  I think I am going to take them out of Junk and Foibles.  I am boycotting them because they just, on a whim, fired both Stephanie and Tina last week.  It makes me furious.  Hopefully one of them can get a job at the coffeeshop I work at.  That would be fun.  I don't have much in common with the people I work with now.  A couple of them went to the burlesque show to see me and thought it was "interesting."  Matt and I got our special pizza last night for supper.  You gotta try this.  We order from Alexandria's on Queen Street and get artichoke, green onion, feta and roasted garlic.  It's soooo good.  Although, the last two times they gave us green olives on it.  I hate those things.  At least they are easy to pick off, unlike evil, evil mushrooms.  I'm thirsty.  I think I'll make some lemonade.  It's that kind of day.

      It's a good thing I was getting paid so much to work today because we were crazy busy.  Having only one cook today was insane.  I couldn't possibly keep on top of the demand for food.  And the worst part is I think Matt went to see Hellboy today without me!  I don't know a single other person that would want to see that with me!  Grrrr.  I made my peanut soup at work today.  It was popular.  The soup tomorrow will be the roasted red pepper and sweet potato that I posted the recipe for in my blog.  I made it today to save the cook tomorrow some work.  Saturday is my day off!  Woot!  Matt's mother came into the coffeeshop today and gave me some ridiculous Easter earrings.  I put them on immediately, because she was standing there watching me.  I haven't even really had a good look at them...  ..Ok, what we have here is a teal anthropomorphic egg wearing a pink bonnet and a big smile.  It's holding some pastel flowers in one hand and waving with the other.  It also has sneakers on.  I have two of these dangling from my ears.  Awesome.  I thought Matt's mom liked me...

      I just thought I would fill out this survey while I eat my delicious left-overs (despite the sneaky mushrooms).   1. Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:  "I'm hungry."  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius  by Dave Eggers  2. Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first:  Nothing, but since I am sitting on a ball I can change that...the wall.  I touch the wall.  3. What is the last thing you watched on TV:  I watched a couple of minutes of that terrible new Fox reality show  The Swan  last night.  Horrible.  4. Without looking, guess what the time is:  5:30 pm  5. Now look at the clock, what is the actual time:  5:35 pm  6. With the exception of the computer, what can you hear:  Al Green  7. When did you last step outside? What were you doing:  I just got home.  I was walking around downtown shopping (see previous entry).  8. Before you came to this website, what did you look at:  I checked my email at hotmail.com  9. What are you wearing:  my The Cheat t-shirt, brown cords with a drawstring ankle for that "Beyonce" look (always classy when paired with a Cheat t-shirt).  10. Did you dream last night:  When my alarm went off at ass o'clock this morning I wasn't sure I had even slept.  It was so dark outside!  11. When did you last laugh:  Geez...hopefully today.  Well, I really laughed today when we were talking about decorating the Easter cupcakes with crucifixion scenes.  12. What is on the walls of the room you are in:  a whole lot.  T-Rex poster, Superman calendar, Superman poster, Sloan poster, old Indiana Jones poster with Harrison in provocative pose, lame Toulouse Lautrec print, REM poster, pictures and concert posters of Matt's band, posters and handbills of burlesque shows and other things I was in,  Last Night  movie poster, some framed pics of me, some various other photographs and assorted junk (it's a big bedroom).  13.

If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first:  I would buy all of my friends something that they really want/need, like Em did on Queer as Folk.  Then I would buy myself Ewan McGregor, Johnny Depp, and an island.  That should do it.  17. Tell me something about you that I don't know:  Who are you?  I'll divulge a little-known fact...you know those  Groovy Girls  dolls?  Yeah.  I've got three of them.  I like their clothes.  One of them is an effigy of myself.  18. If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do:  There would be no countries (yes, John, I  can  Imagine).  Also, police cars would blast  Sandstorm  by Da Rude.  19. Do you like to dance:  I really do.  I didn't take to highland as much as my mother had hoped, but I've never been one for lessons.  I wish I could breakdance.  20. Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her:  I really like the name Molly.  I also think that the name Betty is due for a come-back.  21. Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him:  I think Gabriel is a nice name.  I like Gabe as a short name.  I also like Lee.  22. Would you ever consider living abroad:  Sure, as soon as I get those millions of dollars that question 16 mentioned.  23. Will you pass on this survey:  I had to read this several times before I understood what it meant.  I was thinking "Obviously I didn't  pass  on the survey because I just finished it."  But I guess it means, "will you pass it on to a friend."  I won't go out of my way, but fell free to fill it out.  Now I'ma watch  King of the Hill.   I'm bored.  Is anyone going to the Khyber Gala?

      Day 3 of consoling myself after being rejected by stupid fucking King's.  Today after work I walked right downtown and spent a bunch of money on myself.  It's something that I haven't been able to do for a long, long time.  I'm excited!  *roots through shopping bags*  At HMV I got two CDs for $30.  I chose David Bowie "Low" and an Al Green Greatest Hits.  Then I went to Venus Envy and got a  Fantasy Tickler  (a bunch of pretty feathers on a stick) and I can't stop touching it because it's so pretty and soft.  I also bought some things for Matt for Easter which will remain a secret because he might read this.  I talked to the girl at Venus Envy and they might be interested in selling my homemade Archie magnets.  I've had them at Junk and Foibles for awhile and they've sold ok.  Secretly I've been saving the really good ones for Venus Envy.  They are all one-of-a-kind.  I'd be really happy if they sell them.  I also went to my favourite store: the library.  It's free!  They had the "Garden of Vegan" cookbook that I had on hold.  I am not even vegetarian, but I love the cookbooks these two girls write.  Some of the best recipes ever.  Plus it helps me cook for Matt.  I should go grocery shopping tonight...long weekend and all.  Ooo!  Speaking of the holiday tomorrow!  I am going to be working, but get this: I get paid  double time...and a half!!!   I have never worked anywhere that paid me more for a holiday.  They've all come up with a reason why they don't have to.  I will be working for 8 hours tomorrow and making $20/hr to bake stuff.  I can't believe it.  It more than makes up for the lost hours during the burlesque show.  I'm so glad I found a decent place to work in this city.  Man, I am so hungry.  And way too tired to make anything.  Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!  I still have my China Classic leftovers in the fridge!!!  Rock!

      Day 2 of trying to cheer myself up after being rejected from King's.  I ate at China Classic tonight.  Mmmm...China Classic.  They have some vegetarian options there that keep Matt happy.  And I have leftovers!  Rock!  I just didn't feel liking cooking after a long day of cooking at work.  Plus I got all dressed up after work so I needed to go out somewhere.  I think I am going to call King's tomorrow.  Just to see why I'm not good enough.  Or to find out what they want.  I was really looking forward to being a student again.  I really wanted to get into that program.  *sigh*  I've decided to post some of my favourite recipes here in my blog, since cooking is a passion of mine.    Here's my favourite soup.  I've started making it at work too, because I like to share with others.  It's easy to make, especially if you buy pre-roasted red peppers and have a hand blender.   Rachelle's Sweet Potato and Roasted Red Pepper Soup   - 2 Red Peppers (or 2 roasted red peppers) - 1.5 lbs Sweet Potatoes (about 3 small to medium) - 1/2 medium onion - 1.5 teaspoon butter - 1.5 teaspoon olive oil - 1/2 teaspoon salt - 1/4 teaspoon pepper - 4 cups stock (vegetable, chicken...whatever).   If you are using roasted red peppers (like, from a jar) then skip ahead to step 2.   1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Roast peppers on baking sheet for 30 minutes.  Remove and place in a bowl, covered in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until cold.   Peel off skin and remove seeds.  Set aside.  2. Peel and slice sweet potatoes into small pieces.  Chop onion.  Saute onion with oil and butter in large pot over medium heat until soft.  Add potatoes and cook 2-3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  3. Add red peppers and stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are very soft.  4. Using a blender, hand blender, or food processor, puree the soup until it is smooth throughout.  Voila!  You have soup!  And it's super good!  Fancy enough to impress your friends!

      So now, thanks to  urlLink    people can now leave comments on my Blog!  And also I can title my posts!  I got my pictures from the friday night show back.  There are some good ones.  They are all from before the show, mostly rehearsal.

      Well, I have been officially rejected from King's.  I just got the letter.  I was always taught to believe that if you worked hard at school and got good grades you would keep all of your doors open and could do anything you want.  It's a god damn lie.  This is the second post-graduate university program that I have been rejected from.  So now I don't know what I'm going to do.  That was really my only plan.  I just want to learn to be a better writer.  What I think I will do instead is explore my creative side more and take some classes at the Nova Scotia Centre for Craft and Design.  I like making things.  At least I'll be able to continue working and will be able to save some money.  Hopefully I can go on some trips.  I still think there is opportunity for me here in Halifax.  I just have to find it.  A year ago I didn't know about the burlesque society.  New things pop up all the time!  Dammit.

      I don't think it's good to have so much trail mix around me all the time.  I know it's good for you, but I don't think it's supposed to make up 80% of your diet.  *eats a pumpkin seed*  So I have a whole day off with nothing scheduled to do.  Except...my parents come home tonight from sunny Florida where they have spent the past couple of months so I have to go to their house and make sure it's clean.  And I wanna burn a CD of hot jams.  From time to time I'll just make a note of all the mindless pop songs on much music that I enjoy dancing to and make a CD of the best ones.  My computer here at my apartment is completely balls.  *eats a raisin*  I'm also going to the Viewpoint and hopefully I'll see a movie before the day's over.  I've been waiting for "Hellboy" to come out for awhile, because I am a comic geek.  Hopefully it will be better than the pretty-much disappointing "The Ladykillers" (because I am also a Coen brothers geek).  *eats some sunflower seeds*  I like my days off because they are the only days where I can dress pretty.  I look so ass when I am baking at work.  I hate walking by something reflective.  And speaking of work, we always have a poll every day at the coffeeshop.  Sarah Kilpack and I started it as a way to increase tips.  We put two bowls on the counter and labeled them:  Janet Jackson: Friend or Foe?   It's sort of gotten out of control now and has become a daily thing.  Customers love it and we do get a lot of tips now.  ANYWAY, my point is that the other day the girls working the counter made the poll:  Halifax burlesque shows: empowering or demeaning?   And here's the kicker: it was close to a tie.  I don't like it when the polls are serious like that.  One time it was:  "Gay Marriage: positive or negative"   What the fuck?!    *eats some peanuts*  Ok, I gotta dry my hair, pick up Matt, and then he needs a haircut.  He kept it ridiculous for the show, but now it's gotta be fixed!  (that's his opinion...I'm not, like, trying to control him).

      My guarantee to you is that this will be at least 20% less geeky than my livejournal.  When I joined the ranks of the Halifax Burlesque Society another alter-ego was born.  And now:   Thoughts on the most recent "Bottoms Up" burlesque show.   1. I think it was the best show yet.  Although it was long, I didn't feel that the audience was checking their watches.  Perhaps some of the more timid patrons ducked out early (like Matt's parents...but at least they stayed long enough to see my pasty mishap).  I was a little greedy this time with 2 acts.  I always try to make my acts under 3 minutes, though.  I thought all the acts were fantastic, and I wouldn't want them to be any shorter.  I don't know how we are going to manage the society in the future to keep shows at a reasonable length.  The whole thing seems to have a snowball effect.   At least the viewers got their money's worth!  2. It would be great if, for future shows, we could do some rehearsing with the stage lighting.  Or at least have the lighting people more involved before the show weekend.  I think that incorporating pre-planned lighting into our acts would bring the shows to the next level!  3. There were some jerks in the audience, no doubt about it.  Stephanie and I were talking about a certain group of young men who seemed...out of place, and we decided that it wasn't necessarily a bad thing that they were there.  After observing them for most of the show, we believe that they probably learned something from it.  They went expecting to see a wet t-shirt contest, and gradually became more uncomfortable as the show went on.  But they stayed until the end and I think it's good for everyone to hang with a different crowd from time to time.  A big part of what we are doing is educating, right?  4. I hope that we can find a great place to hold future shows.  Ideally, somewhere where everyone can see the stage.  I was thinking about the auditorium where they hold the Summer Rock camp on Chebucto.  It's big and nice and has a high stage.  I don't know about the bar thing...but it would be worth looking into, I think.  5. I hope everyone had as much fun at the show as I did!  I'm looking forward to seeing everyone at the meeting next week.  Please stop into Uncommon Grounds on South Park Street sometime for your coffee and see me!  I'll bake you something nice!  Oh, and if you wanna check out the interview with me on the King's website about the show , it's right here:  http://novanewsnet.ukings.ns.ca/stories/03-04/040401/burlesque.htm  Alright, first Blog entry complete!

      I'm all moved now.  I feel so out of it because I don't have the internet.  The new place is great, though.  Matt and I really like it.  We are both suffering from allergies due to the season and the amount of dust that is in the apartment from the boxes.  It also has carpet, so that isn't helping.  I am worried that the carpet will mean that we can't get a cat because we'll just sneeze all the time.  I never want to move again.  Moving day was the worst day ever.  I know it was an extreme move, with three people and four apartments involved, but still.  NEVER AGAIN!  I'm at the library using the internet here for the first time.  Not too bad.  I gotta go to the burlesque meeting soon.  Well, I guess I will see everyone at the meeting.  So...see you there!

      This city has no good lingerie shops.  The only thing that I found for a costume piece for the burlesque show was at Night Magic and was $90.  At first I thought it would be a challenge to find acceptable lingerie in my size (40D).  After looking around, I have discovered that it is hard to find nice burlesque pieces in ANY size around here.  For the next show I am going to have to use the internet I think.  So I have no idea what to wear under my costume as the sexy finishing piece for my act.  I don't want pasties because my parents will be there.  I was thinking bra and panties, which really isn't any more comfortable to strip down to in front of your parents.  I dunno.  Maybe I could do pasties on the night that they aren't there.  So the photo shoot at Point Pleasant went pretty well last night.  The mosquitos were no fun, but the odd looks from people walking their dogs were.  The Stolen Minks were scheduled to play tomorrow night at The Khyber but we had to cancel as our bass player has to go to a funeral in Toronto.  It's too bad that we can't play, but the show is not nearly as important as the circumstances that forced us to cancel it.  We're all very sad.  I kind of don't mind having a bit of a break these next couple of days, though.  I have been so crazy busy these past few weeks that I haven't felt like myself.  I'm going to watch Kaleb on Canadian Idol tonight instead of practice with my band.  I need to relax.  I'll check out prime time Coronation Street too.  I bought the Franz Ferdinand CD today.  I think I'll like it.  They have a great name.  I'm so bored.  My job is boring.  Why am I never happy no matter where I work?

      Woah.  It's been so long since I used blogger and now it's all different!  I still don't have the internet at home.  I am holding out for a whole new computer, then I'll get internet.  My PC is so old and slow.  Last time I got high speed interent on it the installer told me he wasn't supposed to put the net on computers that ass.  Plus, at Value Village the other day I saw at least four of my current printer.  That's a bad sign.  I want a new Dell with a new Dell printer.  Computers are cheaper now.  I went to see The Day After Tomorrow last friday.  It was actually a lot of fun.  I thought it would be gross and hyper-American, but it was pretty left-wing.  I was into it.  The really exciting thing is that tomorrow night I will be seeing The Prisoner of Azkaban, after an eternity of waiting.  I have tickets to opening night in the IMAX theatre.  I am psyched.  It's the first time I've had someone to go with to a Harry Potter movie opening.  I went alone to the other two.  I have a new job now.  I am working in Burnside again for a promotions company.  I used to work here in promotional product sales, but now I am working in events.  Currently I am in charge of organizing the upcoming NHL charity golf tournament that we are doing July 8th.  Lots to do there.  I like working with hockey again.  It's what I know.  Plus I have my own office with a computer and (yay!) internet.  So I'll be able to check in with my email and such from time to time.  I'll have to miss tonight's game because Matt's band Death By Nostalgia is playing at the Khyber.  Everyone should go because it is their first show since January (due to the acquisition of a new drummer) and because they are totally awesome.  I'm not just saying that.  I don't see the band because of Matt; I see Matt because of the band.  I bought a juicer yesterday.  I haven't tried it yet, but I can't wait.  Alright, gotta go.  I'll be at the burlesque meeting tonight.

      The Stolen Minks will be trying for a third time to play with The Sweet Tenders this Saturday.  This time for sure!  Nothing can go wrong!  It will be at Stage Nine, and that's, like, our home field.  We played the open mic there last night.  That's always a good time.  I like that open mic a lot.  It's a sampler of local bands rather than a bunch of guys with acoustic guitars doing Dave Matthews Band covers.  I went to PEI over the weekend.  I needed a vacation badly after the two months of busy hell I went through.  Between the burlesque show, my new job organizing a golf tournament and more, and my band, I was exhausted.  The golf tournament was last Thursday, so I took off on Saturday morning with Matt to go camping.  You know what?  Camping isn't that relaxing.  Especially when it is really windy, cold and raining.  Actually, it was a nice trip, despite the weather for the first half.  Matt and I had never been anywhere together, and I hadn't really left town in almost two years.  I hadn't been to PEI in 14 years.  Not much had changed, except they've got this giant bridge now.  And it cost me $53 to leave the damn island!  $53!!  Robbery!  Now I am back at work, tying up loose golf tournament ends.  The good news is that the job here was tentative when I started.  They asked me to organize this tournament, and then they would see if they still needed me.  Everyone was pleased with the job I did on the tournament so I am staying!  On to the next exciting event or project.  Right now I am working on the merchandise for the Keltic Brewing Company.  They are in Truro and will have their beer in liquor stores soon.  I would recommend the McCeol's Irish Red Ale.  I doubt that I will be going to Sackville for the burlesque tour.  I don't know what act I would do.  I feel like I should go, for two reasons:  a) I went to university there, and know Jana, who is organizing it; b) I have a car.  Any suggestions anyone?  If you were me what act would you do?

      Some dickless piece of shit stole my car stereo last night.  My car was parked right outside my house!  It wasn't a great stereo or anything.  I'm so angry.  I can't afford this!  I was going to go to PEI this weekend because I haven't been there in 14 years and now I don't know if I can.  I have to replace the stereo so there isn't a huge hole in my dashboard.  Fucker.  And now I have the hic-ups.  One good thing is that they didn't steal the speakers out of the trunk because the trunk is jam packed with burlesque stuff.  They opened it, but then probably decided to forget about the speakers when they saw all the hockey gear, shoes, make-up, clothes, posters and beavers in the trunk.  Stupid fucking punk.

      Alright everyone, the wait is over!  The Stolen Minks are having a band yardsale this Saturday, August 7th at 5273 Kent Street (that's in the South End, right across from the Queen Street Sobeys...or the Barrington SuperStore).  We are going to be selling all sorts of great stuff, including clothes (you KNOW you've been wanting to buy Steph's clothes!), music, movies, books, accessories, furniture (Steph has a coffee table and a bedframe!), and some useful household items.  Matt is going to be selling some great stuff too, including a skateboard, at least one pair of rollerskates, photo paper, and old band merchandise!  No word yet as to what the other minks might be selling, but it'll be great.  There is also a possibility of baked goods.  It'll go down around 10 AM, so come on over after or before the Farmer's Market!  You won't regret it!  This Sunday will be Matt and my one year anniversary so we are looking at this as an anniversary sale.
