      i've been trying to sleep for awhile now, but i can't.  i just can't help it.  all i can think about is shawn, and how sweet he is, and how much i miss him.  i long for him, desperately.  i want to tell him how much it meant to me for him to come and see me today and how surprised i am he tricked me into being okay kissing him infront of his mom, and how incredibly happy i am that we're together, that we're friends.  i just love being around him.  i love fighting with him over dumb things like how pick n save is better than sentry, and i love discussing beliefs with him.  he's such a beautiful person, and its nice to find someone like that, a task that has been rather difficult during the course of my lifetime.  i just never want to lose him, ever.  god i have his damn stuffed puppy with me right now.  it smells like him.  gosh!  i wish i could fall asleep, i really wish i could.

      i feel competely retarded right now.  i'm depress-ed and sad, well not really.  like i'm happy, but i feel horribly lonely.  my friend amy came over and we had a girls night, movies and pizzas.  that was a lot of fun.  shawn left for his soccer tourney today.  he stopped by work and brought me flowers!  i was like half in tears when he left, i was like,  oh my god, he brought me flowers !  he's so perfect sometimes.  i have this hunger for cheese right now, preferably swiss.  i'm kind of nervous about my parents leaving tomorrow.  like i'm used to them leaving for a week, but never when i didn't have someone with me most of the time.  last year i spent it with brittany, but now i have no one.  its odd.  i keep hugging shawn's stuffed animal he left me.  god i love it.  at night i squeeze it really tight, because i miss him.  i'm not sure why i miss him so much though.  i read the book his mom let me borrow about love languages.  his love language is affirmations, definitely.  mine, well i think my primary is quality time, and my secondary is physical touch.  i'm not quite sure which is which yet, but i think thats how it is because i always yern to spend time with people, and then when i'm with them (or shawn) i feel the need to touch them, to show my love.  that really is how i love people too, through touch.  not necissarily in a sexual matter, though that happens on occasion, but i love just holding one's hand.  it makes me feel close to the person, connected.  i guess that book really opened my eyes to how different people react to love, and it was an awesome learning experience.  i'm really glad i read it.  i feel like in a way i know shawn better to, because i know how he speaks his love.  i just love the psychoanalyzation of people, too, even though thats odd.

      for the first time in my life, well, a long time atleast, i'm happy.  like super incredibly happy.  i'm not used to that.  i've spent so many days crying and obsessing and thinking, but never really living, until now (well as much as i can anyway).  its weird, i have an incredible boyfriend.  that doesn't normally happen to me.  it was really hard getting over my last, and i know its mainly because i was naive, and got too attached to someone i didn't even know.  the guy who randomly walks down the aisle at a graduation and you develope a major crush for is  not  a guy to date, not until you've known him for a couple months at least.  i guess now its different, i know shawn, i know a lot about him, and i love finding out even more.  i feel comfortable with him, and i like just knowing he's there.  its been really hard lately, with work and stuff (i think i may have become a workaholic) but we're pulling through, and i'm glad we have that type of security in our relationship.  i just feel like he never tries to hurt me.  its hard for me to find people like that.  i think i need to follow my gut instinct about people more often.  if i hated them in sixth grade because they were a slut, don't become friends with them in eighth grade!  guess what you'll become.  most of the mistakes i've made in my life have come because of not thinking things through, and going against my heart.  i psychoanalyze everything, and it drives me nuts.  i just want to be happy with myself now that i'm happy with my life.  i'm trying to turn everything negative into positive.  i have this beautiful journal i write in, and every so often i start a page about all the things i hate about myself.  halfway through, i realize what i'm doing and then start writing down my accomplishments and things i like.  thats a big step for me.  i've been fighting innerconflicts for such a long time, and i'm glad to finally be able to take that giant leap forward.  i hope i can keep it up.  i don't know what will happen if i can't.
