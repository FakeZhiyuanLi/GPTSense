       There was an interesting guy at work today.  This may take a little getting-to.  For those who don't know, and i'm assuming this is all of you since I just started posting here, I work at the local library.  I shelve books and I talk to my coworkers and I get paid, and that's just about it.  Today was the start of two things for me; my coworkers and I started working four hour shifts instead of the typical three hour ones we use during the school year, and the summer reading program officially started taking requests.    The four hour thing will be easy to get used to since it comes with more money.  The summer reading program, however, is the source of so many little kids that it boggles my mind how libraries ever came to be considered quiet.  Kids will be screaming and running through the aisles, and when I try to shelve my assigned section there will be two-foot-tall blonde headed kids screaming for the snake books.  I was tired after I got through my shelving assignments today.  I got back to the shelving room where we keep all the materials waiting to be re-ordered and replaced on the shelves, and I had myself a soda.  And then Rachael comes in and tells me that she's been relaxing for the last hour and a half.  I ask her where she was relaxing and why she didn't get caught, and she tells me that she's been sitting in on the kiddie magic show all afternoon.  And I made it back to the shelving room just in time to help him pack up.  So I plod over to the meeting room, this long carpeted room in the corner of the library that has actual art on the walls instead of plush dolls from the children's section, and I walk over to the far end where, amidst about twenty big black boxes on wheels, there is this slightly pudgy guy in his forties.  He has his hair in a buzz cut and is wearing a button down shirt with something about the entertaining industry embroidered near his breast pocket.  Tanya is already in there, standing with the hands on her hips and smiling, listening to this old guy ramble on as his bends over and places a boxy cover on a portable sound board.  He's talking about this old school teacher of his who was apparently rich as all hell.  The entertainer cracks jokes about him in just about every sentence, and actively represents Rodney Dangerfield.  Rod tells me that his old government teacher is the main reason that he doesn't have kids today.  "Would you invite a dog who shits all over the place into  your  house for a day?  The hell you would.  With a kid, you're stuck for life!"  When we get his stuff to the parking lot, he rolls around his child-molester van that he got for the high price of $800 three years ago.  It's his prize possesion, and it's still holding up with duct tape in only a few places.  We load up the truck and let him go, and then harass the new pages as they collect books from the book drop-off bins.  I sit with my back to the cement barrier so that if my boss looks out the window, it will look like a little kid just sitting there, hanging out.  Tanya whines about needing to go back inside to get back to work.  Kelsey sits smirking on the cement barrier and tells Tanya to calm the hell down.  It's too hot out, but the shade from the elm trees is cooler than you'd ever imagine it could be.  The new pages bicker and giggle about not being able to shut the bin's door without it jamming.  It's summer.

       People are theorizing wildly about what the new iPod is to include; most people agree that it will have a color screen and be able to view photos; perhaps it will be able to play video from the dock connector; Jobs said that it may be able to make toast; but it would sure tickle my fancy if it was in some way wireless.  Apple's latest antics really seem to support this, and it's how I got the idea; I was reading over at  urlLink AppleInsider  about Apple's new tiny airport connector, and I noticed the comment about Jobs' "wry smile", as quoted here:  "When Jobs was demonstrating the new Airport Express, Walt Mossberg said that the biggest problem he saw was that  users had to get up and walk to their computers to change play lists . Jobs joked that walking was good, but  when pressed, he smiled a  wry smile  ."  It wouldn't be all that surprising to me, seeing as that Apple just released a product used to rout sound.

       The reason we all liked the normal lan parties better is because we can curse with volume and impunity there and noone cares.  We still cursed out loud at our friend's house, though we tried to keep it down because my friend's dad (who is a doctor and therefore very learned) disapproved silently.  I was talking to his wife the other day and she was telling me how he was mourning the death of 'his babies' innocense.  I told her that we only used the basics at that lan.  And it was the truth too.  If you are a high-schooler, you automatically know the proverbial  latin roots  for cursing.  You use them, you combine them, and you totally pulverize your enemies because of it.  For example, PNEUMONOULTRAMICROSCOPICSILICOVOLCANOCONIOSIS is the longest word printed in many dictionarys, and it refers to a respiratory disorder caused by inhaling volcanic ash. However, phrases like "You S___ Faced Donkey Raper, I'm going to F___ing Rip Your Balls Off and Feed them To Your Mother If You Shoot Me Again"* are the kind of extensive phrases that are bellowed at normal LAN parties.  At my friend's house, we shortened this to 'F___' for the comfort of my friend's father.  This has been a F___ing Public Service Annoucement, B____, courtesy of  OrthodonticJake  *Translation:  "Please do not shoot me again, we are on the same team."

       The holidays are times for relatives and food, not blogging.  You might have noticed that i've been a little absent lately.  I've been doing quite a bit.  I finished Fight Club and have decided that Chuck Palahniuk needs to have my children.  It's just that good.  It's existential and paranoid and postmodern and just so  captivating  that I couldn't put it down.  I am going to read Bridget Jones's Diary next and then hopefully the sequel, in preparation for the next movie.  I sure do enjoy Reneï¿½ Zellweger! :D  I was going to go see Cold Mountain but it just looks too darn depressing.  I had a birthday yesterday, as many people already know.  I'm a dashing and rugged seventeen now, and i'm planning on changing my life sometime later.  Just not now.  As  urlLink this site  says, "Hard work pays off after time, but laziness always pays off now".  How very very true. I was planning on going bowling with my friends for my birthday, but one of us had to work at three and I only woke up at 10:30.  So I had to call all my friends and three of us were ready and at the bowling alley at 11:30, but there was nobody there!  So we all went back to the homestead and played Return of the King on the PS2.  It's a great game.  Lots 'o fun!  We all went out to dinner later at El Rodeo.  One of my friends goes there all the time, and it's funny to watch him socialize with all the waiters he knows personally.  I got a book of magnetic poetry that I was going to bring to the library, but I'm afraid now that all of my fellow pages would spend all their time using it rather than working.  Of course I am totally concentrated when I am at work and would never get distracted.  My coworkers have notoriously short attention spans. *cough*  Also, I got a copy of  urlLink Broken Sword 3:  The Sleeping Dragon , which is panning out well.  I've been a fan of the series since fifth grade when I bought the first game, Circle of Blood, in a bargain bin at an Electronics Boutique in Florida.  In fact, I think it's still my favorite in the series.   urlLink The Sleeping Dragon  is good, but the artwork leaves something to be desired.  I'm used to the lush hand-painted backgrounds in the first game, and the switch to 3D left the scenery a little bare in places.  However, it's still beautiful and captivating, just like it's predecessors.  I really like how they're bringing back tons of characters, and I also like how they kept the original voice actors for George and Nico.  It's nice, and it makes me all nostalgic.  I'd advise against playing it if you haven't played the first two, though.  It's too bad they don't come with the game free...  Thursday (the day before my birthday) we had a LAN party at my friend's house.  In lieu of LANage at the local community college (where we usually go) we have had to resort to desperate measures.  It was a ton of fun.  We played a lot of  urlLink C&C  and some  urlLink BF1942 , though we realized that we like the LANs at the community college better.  I hope they start up again soon.  Today at work I realized that the patrons of the library aren't nearly as grateful as they should be.  I see the entire fiction section of our library as a community service project; I only do it out of the goodness of my heart and nobody ever thanks me.  This makes me bitter.  And I saw  urlLink Kitfox's  rebuttal on the organized DVD section at our library... you see, our library director flipped shit the other day by going all anal and reorganizing the DVD section strictly by title.  And, as  urlLink Kitfox  pointed out, that was retarded.  People go through that section so much that it will never stay in order, and everything worked fine with it in general order by beginning title letter anyway, so why fuck with it?*  [~!]   I am 0% British, just like  Any Good American  You aren't British and you're  so  proud of it.  I mean, Mad Cow is like golf, right?  And our score is one and their score is like a bajillion.  Enough said.  Hamburger is good.

Goddamn snow, OrthodonticJake  *Because we're librarians, that's why.
