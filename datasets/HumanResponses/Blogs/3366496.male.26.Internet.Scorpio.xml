      Another French side lost in an important European encounter. Porto thrashed Monaco 3-0 to win the Champion League Final. I still got my money on France, but i think the dark horses of the tournement are the czechs.

       urlLink TROY , what a massive disappointment. I think Wolfgang Petersen needs to see a shrink , what the hell was he thinking. It was such a pathetic effort at retelling of te Illiad.Firstly, how can you take the Gods out of the story of Troy. There would have been no battle if there were no GODS. Take about squeezing things, they cramped a 12 year war into Two weeks. I guess Hollywood has its own way of telling things.  On a good note  urlLink Fahrenheit 911  won the Top prize at Cannes. Now thats what i call a Slap on Bush's Face.

      How often does it happen, on your day off you have this inner urge to be at work. Sometimes i scare myself.

      When its hot and humid only a fool ventures outside. An Even bigger fool goes outside in his best shirt and pants. Perspiration Galore.. makes you look like someone emptied bucket of water over you. They say its good for you, physically true , but socially.. who would ever want to be with you after having seen u in that state.   My Main Mate is going cuckoo over his New  urlLink Mazda 6 . Its an extremely good car. Neat job on the blue neon lights and  urlLink sound system , Kudos to you mate.  It felt good to meet Hiten, hopefull we shall catch  urlLink Troy  on Saturday.

      Of all the players on the french football team i despise,loathe, abhor  urlLink Fabien Barthez  the most. Ironically I like the club which he plays for, Olympique Marsielle. I felt bad that Marsielle lost the UEFA Cup to Valencia last night. My disliking for Spainish teams has now tripled.  So you get up early morning and off you go driving through early morning traffic to drop a parcel at a place where you dont want to stay a minute longer. But life has this bad habbit of turning rotten when u least expect it to. I reach the place, drop the heavy load off and before i am ready to zoom away I notice the tyre puncture. Why did i ever leave the house to begin with.  I am going to meet Hiten for lunch, i hope the day takes a better turn from there.

      You need to accept you went wrong rather than saying that big fat lie, but then again what if you are telling the truth and no one is ready to believe you. There is nothing more worse than a big fat lie to spoil the rapport with your seniors. But then again you think if George Bush could lie about the WMD and get away with it.. why not you?

      You must be pretty cautious of Old men that dye their hair red; they are either crazy or highly dillusional. You feel like killing them but then again they are protected. It takes more than a mallet to kill their sorry souls..   urlLink Samosas  destroy diets, that's something I learnt today.   Its unusual how you are always envious of your friend's job, no matter what ever you are getting paid , it always seems to be too low as compared to what he/she is getting. In times like these I am thankful that I have a  urlLink JOB .  I ran into an old friend, Dominic, it felt good to see him after all these years. Brought back loads of Football memories. I need to get start playing Football again.

      The world we live in is a strange place; I sometime think that it would have been better off living in the dark ages.  urlLink Gay Marriages , I got nothing against them but I always thought that Marriage was a sacred thing; but then again if  urlLink Michael Jackson  could get married.. :)  I struggled long and hard to get my driving license and all through that torture I craved for a nice comfortable automobile, now that I got one  I HATE DRIVING , I need to get rich fast and get me a chauffeur.

      It just continues to get hotter.. Somebody needs to tell those fools at the meteorology department that its bloody well hotter than what they say. Its times like these that you realize the greatest invention of all times was indeed the   Air Conditioner   :)   Many people ask me after living in this oven for 25 years how come you havent gotten accustomed to the heat. I just dont talk to people like these, it saves a lot of energy.I really dont remember how i came across the band called   CALL   but it was well worth it. Their Single "Nishan" really brings some freshness to the Paki music scene. Yahh! I am Paki :p   Work continues to grow cold which considering the weather is a blessing in disguise. I would'nt want to suffer in this intense heat. Pehlwan continues to warn me about the bitter days to come. I simply adore Pehlwan; i just hope he understands that i am being comical with him . I am too lethargic today, ironically my partner in crime is out in the market; well he has good reasons to go out :D   I think i shall watch  Van Helsing  tonite, if i get the time.
