      From the Newshounds site:  What Republicans Believe   This is a smart alec's summary of what a person has to believe in order to be a Republican these days. No wonder Republicans believe what they see on Fox News.   Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.   Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.   A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.   Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.   The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.   If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.   Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.   HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.   Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.   A president lying about an extramarital affair is a impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.   Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.   The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's cocaine conviction is none of our business.   Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery.   You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.   What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.   * Feel free to pass this on.   * If you don't send it to at least 10 other people, we're likely to be stuck with Bush for 4 more years.   FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS VOTE REPUBLICAN.

      The following article was supposed to run in USA Today today.  But they asked for a few changes before publishing it.  Perhaps like having the article written by someone else who is reasonable?     Put the speakers in a cage by Ann Coulter   Posted: July 26, 2004 4:15 p.m. Eastern   Copyright 2004 WorldNetDaily.com  Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston, conservatives are deploying a series of covert signals to identify one another, much like gay men do. My allies are the ones wearing crosses or American flags. The people sporting shirts emblazoned with the 'F-word' are my opponents. Also, as always, the pretty girls and cops are on my side, most of them barely able to conceal their eye-rolling.   Democrats are constantly suing and slandering police as violent, fascist racists with the exception of Boston's police, who'll be lauded as national heroes right up until the Democrats pack up and leave town on Friday, whereupon they'll revert to their natural state of being fascist, racist pigs.   A speaker at the Democratic National Convention this year, Al Sharpton, accused white police officers of raping and defacing Tawana Brawley in 1987, lunatic charges that eventually led to a defamation lawsuit against Sharpton, and even more eventually to Sharpton paying a jury award to the defamed plaintiff Steve Pagones. So it's a real mystery why cops wouldn't like Democrats.   As for the pretty girls, I can only guess that it's because liberal boys never try to make a move on you without the U.N. Security Council's approval. Plus, it's no fun riding around in those dinky little hybrid cars. My pretty-girl allies stick out like a sore thumb amongst the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie-chick pie wagons they call "women" at the Democratic National Convention.   Apparently, the nuts at the Democratic National Convention are going to be put in cages outside the convention hall. Sadly, they won't be fighting to the death as is done in W.W.F. caged matches. They're calling this the "protestor's area," although I suppose a better name would be the "truth-free zone."   I thought this was a great idea until I realized the "nut" category did not include Sharpton, Al Gore, Bill Clinton and Teddy Kennedy – all featured speakers at the convention. I'd say the actual policy is only untelegenic nuts get the cages, but little Dennis Kucinich is speaking at the Convention, too. So it must be cages for "nuts who have not run for president as serious candidates for the Democratic Party."   Looking at the line-up of speakers at the Convention, I have developed the 7-11 challenge: I will quit making fun of, for example, Dennis Kucinich, if he can prove he can run a 7-11 properly for 8 hours. We'll even let him have an hour or so of preparation before we open up. Within 8 hours, the money will be gone, the store will be empty, and he'll be explaining how three 11-year olds came in and asked for the money and he gave it to them.   For 20 years, the Democrats wouldn't let Jimmy Carter within 100 miles of a Convention podium. The fact that Carter is now their most respectable speaker tells you where that party is today. Maybe they just want to remind Americans who got us into this Middle East mess in the first place. We've got millions of fanatical Muslims trying to slaughter Americans while shouting "Allah Akbar!" Yeah, let's turn the nation over to these guys.   With any luck, Gore will uncork his speech comparing Republicans to Nazis. Just a few weeks ago, Gore gave a speech accusing the Bush administration of deploying "digital Brown Shirts" to intimidate journalists and pressure the media into writing good things about Bush – in case you were wondering where all those glowing articles about Bush were coming from.   The last former government official to slake his thirst so deeply with the Kool-Aid and become a far-left peacenik was Ramsey Clarke and it took him a few years to really blossom. Clinton must have done some number on Gore. Then again, with his yen for earth tones in a man's wardrobe, maybe Gore's references to "Brown Shirts" was intended as a compliment.   Only one major newspaper – the Boston Herald – reported Gore's "Brown Shirt" comment, though a Bush campaign spokesman's statement quoting the "Brown Shirt" line made it into the very last sentence of a Los Angeles Times article. The New York Times responded with an article criticizing "both" Republicans and Democrats for using Nazi imagery. Democrats call Republicans Nazis, the Republicans quote the Democrats calling Republicans Nazis and "both" are using Nazi imagery. (It's a cycle of violence!)   The nuts in the cages are virtual Bertrand Russells compared to the official speakers at the Democratic Convention. On the basis of their placards, I gather the caged-nut position is that they love the troops so much, they don't want them to get hurt defending America from terrorist attack. "Support the troops," the signs say, "bring them home."   That's my new position on all government workers, except the 5 percent who aren't useless, which is to say cops, prosecutors, firemen and U.S. servicemen. I love bureaucrats at the National Endowment of the Arts funding crucifixes submerged in urine so much – I think they should go home. I love public school teachers punishing any mention of God and banning Christmas songs so much – I think they should go home.   Walking back from the convention site, I chatted with a normal Bostonian for several blocks – who must have identified me through our covert system of signals. He was mostly bemused by the Democrats' primetime speakers and told me he used to be an independent, but for the last 20 years found himself voting mostly Republican. Then he corrected himself and said he votes for the "American."   I'd say I love all these Democrats in Boston so much I want them to go home, but I don't. I want Americans to get a good long look at the French Party and keep the 7-11 challenge in mind. -Ann Coulter

      Now, this may come off as pretty conspiratorial.  That's OK.  It is.  But if it comes true then I'm going to go in the campaign business and specialize in dirty tricks because it will only prove that I have the right mindset for it.  Here's the scene:  Boston - Fleet Center.  Center of the Democratic Party's 2004 convention.  Ten's of thousands of delegates, thousands of journalists, thousands of security specialists, and millions of dollars spent on protecting the event from a terrorist event from either homegrown or international terrorists.  We already know what the Democratic platform is.  We know all the positions they hold.  We know who the candidates for president and vice president for the party will be.  It's really unlikely that there will be any surprises at all.  And yet...  The major news networks are still covering it as if it were the 1960's.  Could it be that a group will stage a last minute coup to get Hillary on the ticket?  Or maybe Howard Dean will indulge the audience with another of his takeon-out-of-context screams?  No.  Do we turn in to see the Republican response as each day unfolds?  No, traditionally the other party lays low at this time.  No, the reason is because, in the post 9/11 era. we have turned into a nation of NASCAR-like viewers watchng and waiting to see if something blows up.  Now, this could be anything almost in the Boston area.  A susoicioud building fire, a boat or ship in distress, practically anything that has the potential to be scary and have broader national security implications could instantly divert attention from the convention and lead the country collectively to look and ask what is our homeland security department, and what is our president doing to keep us safe?    And that brings me to my conspiracy theory of the day.  If you're Karl Rove and George Bush you want to maintain the illusion of keeping the tradition of laying low during this convention.  Yet you are concerned that the polls aren't going your way, and even in the one area where the president has a slim lead - tough on terrorism - the presidnet is slipping.  Wouldn't it be convenient if just such a major event happened that had the ability to instill a cloud of fear over the entire country, swing the spotlight of attention back to Bush and away from Kerry, but in the process not doing any serious damage to anyone or anything.  Something that was more showy than damaging.  A large tire fire, something involving an oil tanker, something at sea that blew up just before it entered Boston harbor, or some other highly visible event that for a day would put everyone on edge, then subside but have a chilling effect and prevent Kerry from getting momentum from the convention.  Yes.  A nation of NASCAR-like TV viewers who tune in as much, if not more,to see the big accident rather than the race.

      Bill O'Reilly - yes, the same guy who used to be on some trashy tabloid TV show - hosts his own, well trashy TV tabloid.  If you don't know about it go to www.newshounds.us or www.mediamatters.org and read.  He, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and all the RW fall into the spin conjecture, lies, hal-truths, and falshods so it makes their party and president look competent.  NOW they're attacking the democrats wives.  Read on and then call!  FOX News Channel has fired a salvo in a campaign of innuendo, distortion and untruth aimed squarely at Teresa Heinz Kerry, the Democratic candidate's wife! O'Reilly's guest, Tom Randall, accuses Mrs. Kerry of secretly funding a group of radical anarchists, using the Heinz Endowments as her "cover". True to form, no one was there to argue Mrs. Kerry's side.   Right wing bloggers have been pinging this story all around the net for a long time, but O'Reilly has now given it the FOX seal of approval. John Kerry's been put on notice: Your wife is fair game.   If this makes you angry, read on. Let's turn the tables on FOX News and the right wing!     Bill O'Reilly frequently uses the power of his show to encourage his viewers to call various advertisers and demand that they fire spokespeople that O'Reilly disapproves of. He has used similar tactics to force judges to retire and he smugly claims that his boycott of France is responsible for over a billion dollars in lost revenue in that country.   Now it's OUR turn.   Below you will find a list of the national advertisers who bought time during O'Reilly's July 20th show. If you find his behavior as reprehensible as I do, contact one or more of these companies and let them know that you will not tolerate the media attacking the wives of any of the four candidates. Mrs. Kerry and Mrs. Edwards deserve the same respect and courtesy that has consistently been afforded to Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Cheney.   When you're done, copy the list below and e-mail it to your friends.   Rupert Murdoch will respond to MONEY. If this "Wives Are Off Limits" campaign works and FOX begins to lose advertisers, they will make adjustments.   If we sit around and do nothing, we deserve what we get.

      I've noticed that lately the number of people and groups being labelled as anti-American has grown significantly.  Not only that, but the reasons for the name calling are more and more based on acts that I was un der the impression are expressly protected under the Constitution.  First there's Whopee.  She calls Bush some choice names during a private fund-raiser and she gets fired as a spokesman for Slimfast.  The company line is they don't want that kind of controversy.  Did I miss something?  A private fundraiser.  She was invited to do some comments.  She did.  Why the issue?  Well because she made the mistake of excercising her right to free speech.  The right-wingers in the media keep a close watch on anything that is said they don't like (usually anyone who disagrees with their point of view) and once they find something out come the attack dogs.  It's no longer enough to sinply disagree.  The right-wing demands blood!  And what about Linda Rondstadt?  In Las Vegas (sin-city) of all places she spoke her mind at a casino.  And she was escorted out of the hotel, 1/4 of the patrons booed (while half cheered).  The RW media again made this out to be more than it was.  ALl those leftist elite-ists in Hollywood!  I guess Arnold Schwartzeneger gave up his Hollywood title when he became a Republican governor?  All these people, along with Michael Moore, the people that made Outfoxed, and all Democrats have been classified by the RW as anti-American because, I guess, they stand up and say they disagree with the President.  How dare they do that is a time of war!  When I hear this kind of rhetoric I become worried that the RW doesn't really understand what it is to be an American.  And these people who can't respect the right of true Americans to express dissent are, in my opinion, the ones that we need to be concerned about.

      As Blogs seem to be all the rage I thought I'd look into creating my own.  After all, the internet has allowed a flood of new views and opinions, so I can't really see any reason why mine shouldn't be added to the chorus.  So it's political season once again.  It's a never ending cycle of course, but for the last several months both sides have been gearing up to promote their ideas, their views, their hopes and dreams for America... and why they other side is not deserving enough to win.  But it seems that a major difference this season is that the debate is not one side or the other is better qualified to lead, but rather that one side or the other is more (or less) patriotic than the other.    A new feature is the presence of so many righ-wing sites and news agencies that go beyond saying one side is more patriotic than the other.  The new trend is to openly question the patriotism of the other and accuse them of harbouring America's enemies if they vote against the current administration.  Traitors, treason.  These are all things that seem to be much more prevalent this year than in years past.  Are they true?  Is anyone really seeking to give aid and comfort to the enemy simply because they say that they would run things differently?  No.  I can't help but think that unless theres a change we will spiral down a very dangerous road that is more like 1984 than anyone could have imagined.  My next post I'll take a look at what I perceive to be the difference between the Democrats and the Republicns.  For the record, I'm a Democrat.

      Political Correctness   Political Correctness for Right-Wing Types (or, what to expect when debating a "Fox Fan")    Anyone who disagrees with you is a "Democrat"   Anyone who argues with you is a "Liberal"   If they argue with you & actually present data (formerly known as "debating"), shrug it off as "propaganda from the Liberal Media"   If you cannot rebut the argument, pick on details such as misspellings, improper punctuation or taglines   If your opponent has an unrefutable argument, change the subject   If your opponent consistently overturns your "correct" stories (anything told by Rush Limbaugh), use ad hominem attacks   Anyone who puts life over profits is a "tree hugger"   Anyone who refutes or debates "correct" science (Creationism, Ecological Stability) is a "sky-is-falling" reactionary   Anyone who opposes the melding of religion & government is one of the "liberals" who helped create the rampant immorality today   Any federal program created by a Democrat, or that "looks" Democratic is "socialistic"   Dismantling programs & restrictions on spending, then sending the money to states as a "block grant" is better than having a standardized Federal program with rules   Giving tax money to people is "enslaving them", giving tax money to corporations is "making jobs"   Anything that does not turn a profit for private corporations is an "elitist operation"   Always take everything personally   Whatever your weakness is, blame it on your opponent   The more narrow & prejudiced your sources, the more you project that onto your opponent   When your opponent attacks a Republican/conservative President's policies, blame them on a Democratic Congress (or vice versa)   When quoting your opponent, edit his words to conform to "correctness"   Anyone who reads anything beyond "the Limbaugh Letter" is an "ivory tower intellectual"   When all else fails, lie   (original by Dan Baldwin)

      I just saw thw "Moment of Zen" section on the Jon Stewart show in which we see Bush appearing on a fishing show.  He says "I always try to catch a little one for Barney [Bush's Scotty dog], he likes to play with them."  The video we see is Bush reeling in a small fish and then throwing it on the deck of the boat, then we see Barney "playing" with this fish.  I thought it was pretty twisted myself.

      How do I know this?  Mainly it comes from me taking my last camping trip of the summer this past weekend.  We camp at a gay campground outside of Scranton, PA.  The weather was fantastic, cool and crisp and sunny.  It was Illuminations weekend when everyone decorates their campsite with candles and lights, some with themes others without.  The campgrounds uses 6,000+ votive candles in bags to light the roads in the grounds.  All in all it's very pretty.  We had a visit at 2am one morning from a little racoon.  Then again the next evening from a little skunk who decided to walk right past us, sniff around, walk past us (about 3 feet away) and go back into the woods.  Now it's time to get things under way for band camp, marching band, pep band etc.  The kids are coming back in 2 weeks, and recruitment begins soon for NEXT years class.  Yes summer's almost over.  And as this is an election year the dark shadow of fall is coming earlier than usual.  More later.

      It used to be that the right-wing, conservative voices in America spouted off a well thought-out argument for smaller government, lower taxes, and a strong military.  Their reasons were well-articulated and more often than not it seemed to make sense.  Then came conservative talk-radio.  On the one hand it did re-energize the failing AM radio market.  It rejuvinated the talk-show format and especially brought the idea of discussing politics and events into a wider forum.  But it opened the door to a whole slew hosts, all with a conservative slant of some sort or other, who relished more on the idea of being able to generate ad revenues due to the high number of listeners they brought in, rather than in seeing that the art of public discourse was being equitably practiced.  These were opinionated pundits whose purpose was to promote a viewpoint, repeat it until many people agreed with them, and to give validation to others who were thinking similar thoughts.    Theirs should not be confused with the role of a host, who would allow callers the opportunity to express their views, relay stories, offer advice when appropriate and when callers were frustrated over certain issues that they were unable to fix on their own (say potholes in their street) the show served as an outlet to pass the word and get action.  The nationally formatted conservative radio talk show host is not interested in the "all politics are local" line of thinking.  They are a mouthpiece for GOP talking points and messages of the day.  I'm guessing that people like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Matt Drudge, and other's like them actually communicate (most likely via IM's and the internet) to coordinate messages and get the most bang for their buck.  A simple GOP talking point or rebuttal against a Democratic message can instantly be analyzed, and a strategy is developed - possibly even with the input of the GOP - and the response is delivered as rapidly as possible with the sole hope of minimizing the impact of any DNC message.  Is this good?  Well it shows great creativity, it shows that the GOP is certainly unified and coordinated in their message.  But to me it smacks of a desperate attempt to divert attention away from an opposing viewpoint, and bring the spotlight back onto the message that they want people to hear.  It would be easier to tolerate if these hosts engaged in open honest discussion and debate.  But more often than not we find brow beating and shouting matches over the same limited cliche talking points.  Take Gay Marriage for example.  Now, being gay, this is obviously an issue that is important to me.  So what is the issue here?  Gay denied legal marriage are denied over a thousand federal benefits, protections, rights, and responsibilities that states provide, and the emotional security that goes along with recognized marriage.  So why can't we marry?  Rick Santorum says we're a threat to traditional marriage.  James Dobson, Sean Hannity, George Bush.  Prominent politicians and others with a wide voice say that we are a threat to traditional marriage, that we will bring about the end of our society, that the next thing will be to allow polygamy, dogs and people marrying and so on and so on.  They infuse the word sanctity, or sacred into their argument and frame the discussion in religious terms, insisting that, in their particular branch of Christianity at least, God says gays are not good.  But, and  think this is important, this is America.  A democracy, not a theocracy.  We are a nation ruled by laws that are made by man, not by laws that we believe have been handed down by God.  Religion may inform our laws, but in the America I know it's anathema to impose religious teachings and beliefs on an entire country.  To make this an even muddier issue there are many churches that do recognize the validity of a same-sex relationship and will bless the union.  I guess those churches don't count?  And please, don't look for details to back up claims that gay marriage will be the downfall of the USA.  There is none.  Michael Savage, host of Savage nation radio show based in San Francisco (go figure) said on August 3 that gays were "neo-fscists" and that when we hear "human rights, think gays.  When you hear human rights think only one thing: someone wants to rape your son."  This is what right-wing conservative talk shows have devolved into.  Filth.  They scream that Janet Jackson's breast was exposed on TV during a football game and that this was completely unacceptable to families and values.  But then they turn around and say this.  Where is the dissenting voice?  Well, AirAmericaRadio is doing yeoman's work in offering rebuttal to the right, but their reach is not far enough.  Websites don't get enough traffic especially since most people, liberals like myself and conservatives, only seek out websites that validate their own view on the world.  So until major communications company's diversify and allow a more fair and balanced voice to be heard, until once again we as a country feel confident enough to demonstrate en masse and let our voices be heard, until the level of outrage at what has happened to silence our collective voice becomes so volatile that it can no longer be contained, I guess we'll be relegated to yelling back at the AM radio dial, or better yet - sift through the static for those brief segments of AirAmericaRadio that make it through.
