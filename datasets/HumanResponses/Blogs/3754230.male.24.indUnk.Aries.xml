      I've spent the last three days exhaustively tweeking my website and my fathers networking group website. I feel as if I have finally gone insane. The littlest things in web design seem to take the longest time. Sitting in front of my computer listening to radiohead for hours and hours at a time. That is my life now that I have finally quit Starbucks.  The idea is to go big. A year out of college I have realized a few things about things. I have spent the past year temping and then working at starbucks (which is a good company, possibly the only responsible international corporation in the world), drooling over the mild security of a tiny, but reliable weekly paycheck. Meanwhile I am a year older and I have almost no new web experience. The fact is working and then coming home and working (on web shit) is too much. I need to take the risk of not having money and finally devote myself to becoming an expert and being the man at it. Get to a point where I am offered jobs from outside my personal and secondary circle of friends and my fathers business friends, get to the point where I can charge a shitload of money for it, and if I fuck it up-I'm studying to be a teacher anyway so whatever. Jim Carrey and Jewel slept in their cars. Dustan Hoffman and Gene Hackman used to sleep on their friends floors. I am only risking not going out for a few weekends. Big deal.  Its too bad about starbucks though. I had fun there, there were health benefits and good things (the coffee was shitty though). THis is why not to hate starbucks: They give part time (20hours a week) workers full health. They go into third world countries where they grow their coffee and provide free education and health services to the people who grow and harvest the coffee. If every corporation did that there wouldn't be a problem. Except that Bush is a shit, but thats only a four year problem (hopefully).

           I have a few friends with blogs. I've heard them discussed in various contexts with various levels of approval. I've read about them in magazines and I've even seen a report about them as a cultural phenomenon on the news. Clearly if they were ever cool that time is past. Now they have so saturated our society that when someone gets a blog they are thought of as some sort of poser (for lack of a better word). They are someone with no genuine interests, so they latch on to whatevers around, and they create a simple blog while doing the south beach diet, instead of cleaning out their closet which houses stacks of Tae Bo tapes. Well let me tell you about myself.         I am so fucking cool that I actually take it full circle and do things that are blatantly uncool while retaining my coolocity. I know blogs are uncool, and I don't care. I want one anyway. Can you live with that? Even when something is universally accepted as trendy to the point of being played out are the people who hate cool? They are certainly one level above the people who obliviously listen to Pop music and think its cool. They are above those who think an international corporate hormaster like MTV is cool. They are above those who bought Vanilla Ice tapes and then made fun of it later while buying Hanson tapes. But only one level. I am two levels above. Even cooler than those who are too cool for the world. And so I now have a blog. I hope that trendy hipsters can refrain from exploding.

      In the opening seconds of LL Cool J's 1987 hit single "Im Bad" the police send out an All points bulliten: "Calling All Cars Calling All Cars. Be on the lookout for a tall, light skinned brother with dimples. "  I think this is hilarious.

      Shockingly, there were no comments to my last post, which I had speculated would shake society to its very core. Apparently I was wrong.  I'm glad that I got my blog to start working again. Heres what happened. I took the blog into dreamweaver in order to add a links section and erase that shitty advertisment on the top of the page. somehow I erased some important tags, and suddnely none of my new posts were showing up. Not since the NYPosts Gephardt Gaffe has such tomfoolery entered the world of publishing. I promptly, meaning 2 weeks later, contacted blogspot and reported my problem. They told me i did something wrong. It was at that point I realized that not only could i fix the problem, but i could probably use a new template. So i did. And here you are in a new world gone mad were nothing is what it seems.  Whats going on in my life. The infection I got on my hand from that spider bite is gone. Thank you chlyndomyacin, and Fuck you Lamisil. All Lamisil did was make me feel like i wanted to throw up all the time. By the way if anyone makes a radioactive spider joke regarding the bite I will promptly kill them. It takes something like this to make you realize just how similar everyones stupid sense of humor is. I must have heard that joke 12 times in the last three weeks.  I'm getting business cards printed up for my web design life, because I'm joining a networking group tomorrow. I cant beleive I'm doing it. I just started going to the gym again today for the first time in 2 and a half weeks (because of the medication and the infection, etc) and I regret making a decision to join a networking group when I wasn't working out. Frankly I regret any and every decision I ever made during any period of time when I wasn't going to the gym. The gym levels me mentally, and I see things so clearly when I work all that tenseness out of my system. Now I realize that it was only in a state of tense muscled hyper paranoia that I thought I needed to be in a networking group. It is totally illogical. I'll be working on these two sites then I have something else lined up, and by the time I'm done with it I'll be teaching in some school in Long Island.  Also I'm now enrolled in Touro College for Masters in elementary education.  Thats it.
