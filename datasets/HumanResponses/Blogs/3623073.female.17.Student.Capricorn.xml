      I actually finally found the way to change the time... wat a total SelenGe!!!! SheesH... so dumb... hahaha... My eyes r failing on me... But i'm still inseparable from the comp!!! Wahahaah... First day back at work... Was really fucking bad at first... The staff there treated us as tho' we're non-existent... Full of shit i swear... BUt hack them ah... Plus this morning, my mother actually scolded me for bringing maggi me to work cos i got no more money... Early in the morning at 5am... & this is wat she does.. *speechless* I can't wait for my money to come in... Then again, half of it will b gone... WHY?? Cos my hp bill is 244... plus my piano fees is 250... VONDERFUL!!! ahhaah... *GOSH! I'm acually laughin' abt this... wat a mad ass* Hahhahaha... oh well, Music is my only Cure... *La la la...*

      The moment you are in tension, You will lose your attention. Then you are in total confusion, & you'll feel total irritation. This may spoil your personal relation Ultimately, you won't get cooperation, & get things into complication. Then your BP may raise caution And you may have to take medication Why not try understanding the situation? And try to think about the solution. Many problems will be solved by discussion Which will work out better in your profession Don't think it's my free suggestion, It is only for your prevention. If you understand my intention, You'll never come again into tension.
