      OMG...Its a KILL before the actual Mediocre Site has it, you had better feel special.  Alright so you should know that my parents are about the farthest parents from being cool parents.  I mean if there was a douche award for parents they would be a shoo-in.  In fact, whenever i get to go out with 'the guys' I alwasys have to leave first because there is some gay family related reason.  A couple weeks ago i had to leave early so that my dad could drive the car because he was too freaking lazy to drive his FORDTRUCK.  And just today i had to leave the fun day of miscreant behavior only so i could mow the yard.  You know, because it couldnt have been done tomorrow.  And anytime I want to go anywhere i ask my father because i know that my mom would just say no before i even finished asking.  She would also probe me with questions that have no answer like "and what ae you going to do" and "how long will you be gone" and "this must mean that you have no concern for me what-so-ever" you know, because i want to go out somewhere when she isnt even home.  And the when i do get home swhe is all like "where have you been" and "what did you do all this time" and "why couldnt you have just done that here with me" its just so fucking stupid that she cant even try to let go like im fucking eight years old.  I think that when i move out she is just going to have a stroke within the first week.  As a matter of fact, one weekend we were watching a movie and out of no where she says "why do you have to move out, i just want to do this all the time with you and me watching a movie enjoying our weekend".  With all this it must seem like she is a kind and caring person, but heavens no, when she isnt being an annoying clingy bitch, she is consumed with being a cold wretched bitch and dont you think that im a bad person for saying that because you dont have to live with her. The most recent act of bitchness is that she thinks that i should have to get off of the internet at 11:30 (as you can tell its past 2:00) because i fell asleep one day and i had forgotten to spray paint HER chairs and i didnt have any food prepared for her lazy ass.  Yea she tries everynight at 11:30, but it never works.    Oh well, that quite enough complaining for now, if you want some more on the subject, make a comment. DO IT! NOW!

      Wow, isnt this great, a blog.  Well, I'm already bored.  Isnt the template just so cool...well it looked pretty cool on the thumbnail.  Uhh...so basically this is just a "shortcut" to the KILL's from the actual  urlLink danielsmediocresite  and I'll probably just work on copying all of the KILLs from there to here so you will have two options of where you can view the KILL's!!  All you have to do is remember this site (danielsmediocresite.blogspot.com) for when you need yourself a KILL hookup!
