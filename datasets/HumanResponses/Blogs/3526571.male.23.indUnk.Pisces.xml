       I went to see this movie with work today.  It was really good.  I didn't know too much about it going on, but I was very impressed, definitely recommend it.

       I went to test drive the CR-V yesterday at Bellevue Honda, since they had some manuals in stock.  I liked the way it drove, shifting seemed a bit more comfortable than the Rav4.  Other nice features: floor space next to the driver's seat (if you fold down the tray that's there), reclining rear seats.  Not so nice features: ABS only comes on the EX model (the more expensive one).  Funny quote from the dealer: "We're the biggest Honda dealership in the Northwest, and what that means for you is that you get a bigger selection." Evidently, it doesn mean I'd get a better price there.  Still undecided

       I'm getting a new car soon.  I'm pretty sure it's going to be one of these three:    Honda CR-V    Toyota Rav4    Subaru Forrester  After the first one showed up on  urlLink  Google Images  , I thought it would be funny to use all crash test pictures.  But I couldn't find a picture of a crash test for the Forrester.  Maybe the internet is trying to tell me something (other than that I have a strange sense of humor).

       I'm afraid I'm going to get some cavities.  Well I'm not really afraid, but I have been eating a bunch of candy.  "Why is that?" you might ask.  Well there are two factors here.  The first is that at work, people leave candy outside their office on the anniversary of their start date (typically 1 pound of m&m's per year they've been here).  The second factor is that my office is very close to the corner of this building.  Implications of being near the corner: There's a guy in a corner office with 8 pounds of candy outside his office, and hardly anyone ever walks by that part of the building.  So I've been handfuls of runts every once in a while for the last couple days.  They're good, but I know they're rotting my teeth.

       As I mentioned I was going to do, I went to a smallish concert this saturday night to see The Killers.  It was at  urlLink  Neumo's  on Capitol Hill (10th & E. Pike).  The venue was cool, it's got a bit open area in front of the stage, then a bar off to the side, and a big balcony with some lounge-ish booths.  We were on the balcony, just above stage right so we had a great view.  I speculate that bands hire terrible opening acts in order to make themselves look better.  The opening acts were Cobra High (which falls under "good music for people who like bad music") and Alien Crime Syndicate (they weren't that terrible, but following Cobra High helped their image), whose lead singer was a Kurt Cobain wannabee.  The Killers were awesome, their lead singer is really good.  Robin said he sings like Clay Aiken (in terms of how he presents himself on stage, he's very casual, sort of walking around and playing to the crowd).  I hadn't really heard much of their other music, but it was all good.  They ended the set with 'Somebody Told Me', their hit single, then came back for a short encore.

       Last night I went on a fun adventure.  First a little backstory is necessary. I really like this song called "Somebody Told Me" by a band called The Killers.  It is played on the radio here a lot, you can listen to it here:  urlLink  Killers Music  . Turns out The Killers are playing a small show in Seattle this Saturday at a club called Neumo's.  Tickets are only $10, but there's a $3.50 "[in]convience" charge if you buy them online.  So I had the brilliant idea that we should go buy tickets at the box office, and combine it with having dinner somewhere in Seattle. It should now be obvious that "fun adventure" was meant ironically as this barely qualifies as adventureous (though we did go to two places we hadn't been before). So  urlLink Scott ,  urlLink Erin , Adele, Luke and I went to dinner as T.S. McHugh's, an Irish pub in Queen Anne.  We picked it more or less at random off the list of restaurants that take the Prime Card.  Then we dropped Luke off (he lives in Seattle and took the bus to work) and went to get tickets.  Neumo's uses the Bad Juju Lounge as their ticket office, which seems really strange.  Tragically, they didn't have any tickets left.  I think they only allocate a certain # to be sold at the "ticket office" and the rest are available online.  What a ripoff.  So long story short, I ended up getting the tickets online anyways.  But at least we had a fun adventure.

       Here's a little known fact about me.  When I am outside running, I really enjoy seeing people that I know.  The most common scenario is to see someone I know driving by in a car, but occasionally I'll see someone walking, running, biking, etc.  I was reminded of this yesterday as I was running along West Lake Sammamish and saw Jason drive by.  That reminded me of two things.  The first thing is this interesting fact that I'm currently writing about.  The other, is that this now happens to me considerably less than it used to before I moved here.  That makes sense, considering I know a lot more people in Somerville than I do in Redmond. I'm now thinking that perhaps this interesting fact doesn't sound so interesting, probably because of the mundane way in which I phrased it.  It's hard to explain, you might say I "get a kick out of it" or it "makes my day" or "puts a smile on my face."  I think you know what I mean.

       Turns out the Delta person I talked to on the phone yesterday lied to me, or at least didn't know what she was talking about.  I had in my posession what they call "paper vouchers" and she thought I was talking about "evouchers".  Roughly speaking, a paper voucher is something that is worthless unless you care to haul your butt to an airport or "ticket office" (the closest one is in Chicago i think).  An e-voucher on the other hand, is something "they only started doing recently".  Despite the similar names, there is no way to transfer one to the other. I spent almost on hour on hold and speaking to Delta agents & supervisor last night, trying to get them to let me book my tickets over the phone or internet and pay for it with the "paper voucher" i had.  These have a document number on them which I argued must be stored in some database somewhere that they could look up.  This is apparently not the case.  If you have a good printer and some cardboard stock, I recommend you start printing your own "paper vouchers" since they have no way of verifying their authenticity via these phantom "document numbers.  At this point I decided to go ahead and put a hold on the tickets since the airfare wasn't that bad ($428 and I had $400 in vouchers).  Of course that means I have to go to the airport today.  I'm pretty busy today.  So I woke up at 4:45 and drove to Sea-Tac, waited in line about 15 minutes, and was eventually told that I could only get $250 in credit towards my ticket since the kind Delta agents at Orlando had the foresight to give us two separate vouchers ($250 and $150) which cannot be combined with any other voucher.  So my price just went from $28 to $178, or about a 600% increase.  The remaining voucher expires on Jul 12, so I asked if there was any way I could get an extension for it.  The woman at the counter informed me I should call Customer Care.  I pointed out that Customer Care has no idea what I'd be talking about since these "Document Numbers" are stored nowhere and cannot be verified, so how could they make any changes to my document.  She recommended I talk to them and could mail them in to get them extended.  If there's one thing I can't wait to do, it's be on hold with delta for another half an hour, and then be told they can't help me. The worst part of all this is that I have "paper tickets" rather than etickets, which means when I go on this trip, I will yet again have to wait in line at the Delta ticket counter.  I really don't like waiting in lines. Admittedly, it was clearly printed on the vouchers that a) they had to be redeemed at a ticket office and b) they couldn't be combined.  But I don't like those rules anymore than I like driving to the airport at 5 in the morning.  I got home at 6:30 and went for a run, then went right to work.  Now I'm tired.  But at least I have tickets to go home for 7/4.

       When I was in Vegas, I ate at Emeril's restaurant at the Venetian, Delmonico.  I'm still salivating from the experience.  Here's something approximating what I had (thanks to Larry for the link)  urlLink  Ribeye et. al.    The worcestershire (that's 'wu-sta-sheeah') sauce was incredible.  too bad it takes > 6 hours to cook.  maybe it can be purchased...

       I called Delta to find out what I had to do to use my vouchers to get tickets. backstory: Last summer when I went to Florida, we took a ~3 hour delay in Orlando and in return Delta gave us (all 8!! of us), $400 towards future travel.  They expire at the end of July so I'm trying to use them to go home for July 4th. It turns out that I can use them on their website by entering the numbers.  Originally I thought I had to go to the Delta ticket office (i.e. Sea-Tac airport) to redeem the vouchers.  But alas I am saved!  There's a decent airfare right now, so I'm going to try to book tickets when I get home tonight.

       And now the fun really begins.  I've decided that while I am waiting 2-5 minutes for code to compile, I will occasionally make entries here instead of compulsively checking my email.  This is a very busy week for some odd reason.  Tomorrow: game meeting + eli's birthday dinner.  Thursday: Craig & Erin's birthday thing.  Friday: another birthday event.  Why so many birthdays in June?  Saturday is my party, which I am still trying to figure out all the details for. Other things I need to figure out the details for: Going home for July 4th.

       I will indeed travel again, this time to Hawaii for John's wedding in October.  For the most part this transaction went relatively smoothly, except for one minor incident where the agent on the phone informed me that "Websites are different than phones," but I'd rather not get into that.

       You've read of my many woes when it comes to purchasing tickets, Whether it be for travel, concerts, baseball games, etc.  Here's another one for you.  I got an email the other day from Larry, telling me that he was going to be in Vegas with his girlfriend this Sunday and Monday.  He says I should come down and hang out with them, seeing as how it's not too often he's on the West Coast.  Very Tempting.  I do love Vegas, and I can afford to take a day off.  I head over to travelocity.com and check on flights.  $333 is the cheapest I see.  I'd maybe do that, but it's a bit expensive, so I wait and check again the next day.  Yesterday I noticed I can do a hotel + flight combo for what seems to be a reasonable price.  Figuring the airfare at $300, I could get two nights at NYNY for $65/night.  Seems reasonable.  So I checked with Larry, they had reservations at the Flamingo, but could cancel them without getting charged so long as they did it by midnight tonight.  Sounds like a plan.  I get back on travelocity to book it.  Everything still comes up at the same prices like I expected, so I go ahead and book it.  Then, after I'm done forking over the loot, I come to the confirmation page, which informs be that I have been [over]charged $702.  Where oh where did that extra ~300 come from I wonder?  So, begrudgingly, I get on the phone with them.  That is, I call them and navigate their phone maze for sometime, eventually managing to actually get myself on hold.  Here's roughly the conversation I had:  Me: You overcharged me by almost $300 Them: Are you sure? Me: Yes Them: Can you hold? This may take 3-5 minutes  > Them: Maybe the fare went up while you were booking it? Me: Doubtful, I searched again just now and it comes up with the same [lower] price. Them: That's just the hotel price, you need to add them together Me: It says explicitly "Flight + Hotel" Them: Well, sometimes the price can change while you're booking it Me: So once I enter my credit card, you are free to charge me any arbitrary price? Them: Can you hold? This may take 3-5 minutes  > Them: You were charged the correct price Me: Let me talk to a supervisor   Them: OK I'll have to put you on hold, this will take 3-5 minutes  > Supervisor: HI! [i will pretend to have no idea what's going on] Me: (repeat entire story) Supervisor: Let me try to reproduce what you saw on the website.    Ok I'm seeing $xxx does that sound right? Me: Yes, that what it should have been. Supervisor: Let me look into this, please hold  > Supervisor: OK We're going to refund you the difference, it looks like there is in fact a problem with our site. I'll give you a call back to confirm when we get this taken care of. Me: How about I call you back? Supervisor: Here's my name and our direct customer service #.  Thanks for catching that! Me: Yeah no problem  I'll post again if/when they call me back.

       Yesterday the group I've been working with reached our first milestone for the project, so we went out to lunch at this place called Dixie's BBQ.  I had never been before but I've heard lots about it.  It's run by this old black guy who walks around with sauce pot and a spoon.  The pot contains this ridiculously hot sauce that he makes, which he calls "The Man."  He walks around asking everyone if they've met the man, and how many spoonfuls they'd like on their sandwich.  Actually, he just asked me "Three or Four?"  "One," I replied.  He put approximately 1/8 of a teaspoon on my roll.  I took a little bit of that and spread it on some of the pulled pork and took a bite.  It was hot but not too bad, so I had a little more.  My big mistake was taking what was left on the roll, spreading it out, then taking a bite of pork+roll.  It was about 5 seconds later than my throat starting tingling.  I quickly ate the rest of my cornbread and drank the rest of my root beer to cool off the inside of my mouth. Overall I give Dixie's 3.5 out of 5 stars.  The food was really good and it's a fun place, but it's slightly overpriced and there were lots of bees (most of the tables are outside).

       Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of my start date at Microsoft.  You would think that I'd have some interesting things to reflect on or talk about.  Perhaps I do, but not right now.  Right now what's on my mind is that I've gotten very bored with cooking for myself.  Last summer/fall, I used to prepare legitimate meals for myself, complete with side dishes, salad, etc.  Recently I've been frequently dining on frozen burritos from Trader Joe's, or just making some pasta.  I can think of a couple possible reason's for this.  I haven't been watching FoodTV much, and that used to get me excited about cooking.  I've been busier at work and getting home later the last few months, leaving less time for cooking.  Also, a while ago I invited someone over and cooked dinner for them, and it didn't go all that well, so maybe there's some negative reinforcement there.  Quasi-related: Cooking for oneself isn't all that much fun/rewarding.

       I went too see Bourne Supremacy last night with Rob, Scott, and Jason.  We got there about 5-10 minutes before the movie started and the theater was already so full that we had to sit in the front row.  That was bad for several reasons.  First, it's just bad to be so close for any movie because the screen is so huge you can't see the whole thing at once.  Second, this movie had a ton of close ups and not many wideshots (which is what you'd prefer when you're sitting that close).  Finally they used had a lot of shaky-camera shots (e.g. shaky shot of a crowd of protesters, shot of someone running, car chase scene, etc.).  Probably the worst movie ever to sit in the front row for. Another problem was I didn't see the first movie so I was missing a little bit of what was going on.  I felt like the movie was really short.  It was actually close to 2 hours.  I guess I thought it was short because I expected them to fill in more details about some of the subplots, which they never did.   This sounds mostly negative, but the movie did have some good aspects to it, most noteably the car chase scene at the end.  Overall I give this movie 2 headless chickens (out of 5).

       This Saturday was Puzzle Safari at Microsoft.  If you think that sounds really nerdy, you're right.  If you're wondering what it is, here's how it works.  You get a team of 4 people together.  You are given a packet with a bunch of puzzles in it, and a logbook that lists all the puzzles.   The solution to each puzzle is a location somewhere on Microsoft Campus (e.g. "Building 16 Lobby" or "Front Door One" or "17/3002").  Once you solve a puzzle, you need to take your log book to the location, find the stamp that is hidden there and stamp it in your logbook next to the name of the puzzle that brought you there.  There are 2 rounds that last 3 hours each, and you get about 35-40 puzzles each round.  Last time I did Puzzle Safari was 2 years ago when I was an intern (I got here too late last summer).  That year we came in 10th place (there are about 50 teams in the competition).  Our roster was changed slightly, it was still me, Rob and Adele, but Jason stepped in to take Bronwyn's place.  This time we came in 6th! And we were only 2 points behind 5th and 7 points behind 4th (each stamp is worth ten points, so one more stamp and we would have been 4th).  Everyone did really well, we solved tons of puzzles, ran around like madmen, and had lots of fun.    Did I mention it was 95 degrees and I was running around for over 2 hours? Yeah, I almost died. I was extremely dehydrated, muscles I didn't know I had were cramping up, etc. etc.  But I eventually recovered. The End.

       Did I mention I've been playing a beta version of Halo 2 for about a week now? If you liked Halo, Halo 2 is incredible (and i've only seen a little bit of it so far).

       I Finally picked up The Da Vinci Code from the library last night and started reading it.  So far so good.  I recognized the numbers that the murder victim wrote down as being [quasi-spoiler, if you're a nerd but haven't read the book yet] urlLink  some of these , but I'm not sure why that's important yet. I am a little thrown off by the whole idea if this being a fictional novel with lots of facts mixed in, because it's not always clear what exactly I'm supposed to believe.

       A few months ago i bought tickets to see the red sox when they came to seattle to play the mariners.&nbsp; Last week I looked at the calendar and realized the game was coming up very soon.&nbsp; The Red Sox schedule I have on my office wall lists July 19 as being a day came, and July 20th and being a night game.&nbsp; So I assumed I had bought tickets for the game on the 20th, since otherwise I'd miss half a day of work.&nbsp;  This past weekend I was so busy helping out with the Microsoft Intern  urlLink  Game   that I completely forgot about the game.&nbsp;  Then yesterday I was sitting in work and someone sent me a message asking if I was going to see the red sox.&nbsp; Oh yeah! I have tickets! I almost forgot! [a little backstory: the tickets never arrived in the mail, so i talked to ticketmaster, and they said they'd have them at will call]. So I called the Mariners ticket office to a)make sure they had my tickets and b)see which day they were for.&nbsp; Yes they had my tickets.&nbsp; They were for July 19th.&nbsp; I was not happy, as I was pretty sure yesterday's game was a day game.&nbsp; But alas I was mistaken and it was in fact a 7:05 start.&nbsp; So I called Jason to see if he wanted to go, since I had two tickets.&nbsp; He had to work till 7, which was fine cause by then the traffic has died down heading into Seattle. It turned out to be a pretty good game for the first 8 innings.&nbsp; Until Seattle tied it up in the 9th.&nbsp; The bullpen really blew it for Arroyo, who pitched really well, with 12 strikeouts, 3 hits and 1 run in 7 innings. He left with a 4-1 lead. Then in the 11th, some guy I never heard of hit a walk-off grand slam. Ugh. The highlight was around the 8th inning when a crowd of Red Sox fans a few sections over started a "Yankees Suck" chant.&nbsp; The lowlight was the drunk guy in the next row taking his shirt of and dancing around.

       No, that wasn't my best  urlLink George Costanza  impression, it was the results of my taking the  urlLink  Meyers-Briggs   test for  urlLink  Jung's personality types  .  Although some of you might argue that I have no personality, I seem to be an INTP.  The N and T are strong (about 60 and 80 percent), not surprisingly, but I'm borderline E.

       We're getting the carpets cleaned in our apartment today, so i was up late last night, picking up my laundry, putting chairs on tables, and generally making the carpets more accessible. At midnight on VH1, they played I Love The 90's, (1991).  What a great show.  Very exciting.  I don't really remember what they were talking about, because I was pretty tired, but it was funny. Before that, I saw The Assistant, which is a reality show with Andy Dick where people try out to be his personal assistant.  It is to reality shows what Scary Movie was to horror movies (though i never saw scary movie so maybe i'm wrong).  For example he gave the contestants a book about his life and then quizzed them on it later on a fake "Who wants to be a millionaire" type set, with the music & lights and everything.

       I took  urlLink  This quiz   that  urlLink Erin  mentioned.  It asks you a bunch of questions about political issues, then tells you which candidates/parties you align with. The results: I was a 40% match with Dems, 40% match with the GOP, and, surprise surprise, a 40% match with the Green Party.  I did match slightly higher with Kerry than Bush.  I forget the exact percentages, but it was less than 10% difference.  So I guess I should split up my vote evenly among the candidates.  That would be roughly equivalent to (gasp!) not voting.   Who should I vote for and why? (50 words or less).  So sorry about the "pizza" red herring.  Some of you might get that reference.  Most will not.

Thanks to Joanne and travelocity customer service in PA, and Gary at Sabre for taking care of it.  I just called to check on it since I hadn't seen the credit to my account yet.  Unfortunately, while they can charge my same day for a purchase, processing a refund can take "up to two billing cycles."  That stinks since now I actually have to pay for it since my cc bill will be likely be due before then.  On the bright side, when it goes show up, I'll have a really cheap cc bill that month.

       Saturday I went to Ikea with Erin and Andrew to get some 'stuff' for our offices.  If you haven't been to Ikea yet (possibly because your city's government and/or a certain task force is preventing one from being built just miles from your house) you are missing out.  What's so special about Ikea?  It's huge, and they sell *everything*.  Also, it's massive.  No, bigger than that.  There just aren't many other stores where, as Erin pointed out "you stop for lunch two hours into it".  And at that point we were only halfway through the store.  Here is a list of things I bought For my office:  - Two  urlLink  red chairs    - A small  urlLink  coffee table   (1' by 3x)  - a  urlLink  green rug   (2' by 4x) (it goes under the coffee table  - a red  urlLink  glass ball  with bubbles in it.  - a miniature  urlLink chair   - a wooden  urlLink figure  the last three items are sitting on the coffee table. My office is very cool now.  Come check it out.  For my apartment  - new sheets (red! 200 thread count)  - 2 pack of flexible cutting boards  - a box grater (look out cheese, here I come)  - a ladle  bonus excitement: I actually changed my sheets

       I was in Vegas sunday night to tuesday morning (last week).  Here's a very brief trip report.  I stayed at the NYNY Hotel.  I was pretty happy with it and would recommend it.  Great location central (though we had a car and never ventured south).  It seemed pretty modern compared to the Flamingo where I stayed last time.  In particular the bathroom was noticeably newer, which is one of my key evaluation points of hotel rooms.  I am grossed out by slightly old or rusty bathroom fixtures.  I remember at Flamingo the tub seemed a bit old to me.  Cheap Eats - Definitely one of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch in Vegas is the little sandwich shop in Paris right across from the buffet.  It's about $6-7 for a sandwich, soup or salad and a drink.  And the food is not bad at all.  It also has an attached dessert shop with some gelatto, which I didn't get this time. I finally got to the downtown area to see the Fremont Street Experience, which is pretty cool.  Checked out the Golden Nugget, featured on Fox's tv series The Casino.  We grabbed dinner at their coffeeshop type restaurant which again was reasonable and cheap.  The Nugget is a lot nicer than the other downtown casinos (Binion's, 4 Queens, etc).  Bathtub - We were walking up the strip and saw Boardwalk advertising their $3 tables, so we stopped in to play some craps.  They had what are known as mini craps tables, which is basically half the length of a regular craps tables.  It's approximately the size of a big bathtub, so we called it rolling dice in a bathtub.  That was pretty fun, we only lost a little bit of cash since it was a $3 table, and the dealers (croupiers?) were very amiable.  This was the first time I'd played poker in Vegas (2-4 texas hold'em).  I did pretty well at that.  Overall I was down a nice chunk of change by the end of the trip, but it was still fun.  Next time, more blackjack & poker, less craps.

       I finally got around to registering to vote.  Well, I got the form at least, I just need to photocopy my license and send it in.  I was amused by one of the Frequently Asked Questions on the website: Q.  Are bars closed in my State on election day?   The answer is given as a big chart that shows polling place times, etc., by state.  Turns out bars are closed in Deleware, Pennsylvania, Utah, South Carolina, Indiana, and Kentucky. Who's responsible for these regulations, and are they really fearful that people will get drunk and waste their vote/forget to vote/vote for the "wrong" person/get violent when their candidate loses?
