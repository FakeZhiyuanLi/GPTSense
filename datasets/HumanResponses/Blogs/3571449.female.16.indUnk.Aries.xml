      Thank you so much for the wonderful night:)  you made me feel 100% better  i wrote a poem.....  Pond To Heaven  Clear midst in the fields Where yellow and white Lilly's grow I see a face in the pond reflecting what is not me it wasn't but a man behind me who I did not know.  He touched my shoulder Gazing at the water ripples as I touch it I turn around and close my eyes and fall back Deep into the pond my soul floats to the top.  I blow out my last breath  Looking up to the top of the water;the waters edge so long I see his face once more as I close my eyes and part I hit the bottom.He is jumping in after me, but I am gone.  Well im so tired and i gotta work @ 4 tomorrow:( god i dont want to!!!! well goodnight everyone! Love yall!  >>>Malocups

      Wow today i felt like i was on a double date with Samantha Amanda and Elizabeth. We went down to the Ghetto and that was scary so we went to this cemetary off of Gratiot. It wasnt that scary so Elizabeth had the idea to go to the one by my aunts house. We went. We drove. We conquored. LMAO n e way......we pulled down this weird street then right into the cemetary. It looked so creepy i like wouldnt drive n e further so they said to go park on a street and we would walk to the cemetary. so we did. We had to stop and act like we were like waiting for some people because these 2 people started walking by us!!! oh man!!! lmao n e way we finally went in and i was so fucking scared. We walked through it a little then we saw this weird box thing. It was huge and black and i didnt want to go but they made me go with them. Turns out it was this memorial thing. it was huge. Then we kept walking on the trail and i kepy holding onto Amandas hand.....:) shes so sweet n e way there was like this section of trees and it was really dark and we all got really scared. Then Elizabeth's like...dude im thinking about something really scary and we were all like, dont tell us cause then we would get scared even more. Then we walked back and tried to use the Ouiji Board but we all kept laughing because the person we were using it on was Mabel Wurzel....we thought the name was funny so we didnt end up doing n e thing. Then we like walked to the front of the cemetary and all the way around till we got to the place were we came in....so yeah i had a fun filled night :) woohoo time for bed....maybe....im not really that tired at all but i guess ill just watch tv or something.....goodnight yall....  ~*<>Passionate Kisses Goodnight<>*~

      Happy Fathers day Daddy O!!! i love you! heres a poem i wrote for my daddy today:) i printed it out on this paper that looks like a peice of "natural wood" lol    Dad  Dad, you are the best. The best at rototilling ( which is like grinding up dirt for his garden lol) you are the best at mowing the lawn and also weed killing.  You're the best at catering parties, the best at food cooking the greatest chef in the world and the best looking  you are the best at a lot of things things you love to do but the best thing i think you do is being the worlds best DUDE!(dad) lol   heres another poem i wrote today.....its kinda dark   If  if flowers could bloom without pollen, sun or water would there be bumblees in sworms? if trains could run without engines,would their be tracks to cross. If people could respond to one another without whispering a word would people still love? if people would walk on glass without shoes would we bleed? if people could cry without sobbing  would their be tears to wipe away the sorrow and greif?  i love writing dark poems, thats just what i feel but my parents dont appreciate that....they tell me to stop writing poems about death and stuff.....but u know what im not gonna writing poems like that helps me alot.......oh well im going to bed now i think so goodnight    Love

      ...:::Tomorrows a New day:::... i had a good day, woke up early to shove everything in the trunk of my car from my back seat cause my mom had to bring my car into to work to get an oil change and fix my "service engine soon" light.  OMG! Boy Meets World is on i havent seen this show in like 5 years! SCORE  Well i didnt really do anything today, i picked up Tiffany and we went to Arbys to "talk" i feel so bad for her....cant really say what happened  i love her to death  Well i drew some freakin' awesome pictures today in pen in my notebook. my fave one is The Beatles cartoon faces now thats bad ass!   Heres a poem i wrote today.....not sure what to call it so comment on this blog if you have a good title!!!  ...:::... Falling water from a faucet is like clouds and rain storming on a summers night  Walking alone, to an open field to lay in the wet grass to think about my stupid fright  Running away from my fears isnt going to get me anywhere just back to the start   Facing everyone of the world yelling out my pride never again will i fall apart   Heres my favorite poem i ever wrote   Delicate Joe  Lonley hearted, Battered mind a darkened room and me soul floating away. Running getting away. Be free  Twilight hours lonesome feelings. Nothing left but surrow in a jar lid closed tightly  Catching a handicapped butterfly beaten from the wind and fire Cared for by others unlike me He has sorrow from the sire.  Endless shadows surrounding me bleeding souls Inching to be free  careless people roaming in open fields not looking back at me no stops or yeilds  Falling walls And ticking clocks buzzing bees  and birds in flocks  Endless hallways echo my screams getting down under killing schemes.  ...:::Passionate Kiss:::... Lots of Love ~**~

      Goodnight to sunshine as the sun sets as the flowers close  come out now the moon shining brighter then the last time missing it last time i did not see the light coming from other then my night light i see a face looking down on me...its the man on the moon he is my hero;he is you you watch me as i sleep keep me from looking out my window at strange noises feeling comfort from ur stare&nbsp;i feel a wink come from your hungry eye i look at u as i smile and glichi have sweet sorrow from you&nbsp;but i do not take it in my palm for it would drain out the cracks between my fingers and run down the drain like rain from a summers storm im leaving you alone now as i fall asleep catch me in my dreams if you will&nbsp;come watch me&nbsp;come stare at the way i look into your eyes searching for your soul  loving you still...... &nbsp; and i wrote this one.......it was for the soldiers over seas........ Goodnight to all the little children who have un read storys read to them by there fathers Goodnight to all the wifes who have no one to sleep next to or wake up from nightmares for confort. Goodnight to all the puppys with no companion's Goodnight to all the fish that are unfed by the men who's jobs must be replaced. Goodnight to all the routes not taken any more by the ford truck Goodnight to all the cowboy hats that will not b worn &nbsp;  Bring our men back home    &nbsp;  im going to bed goodnight  &nbsp;

I did really good at work though...Melissa went on break so i took her head set and went on drive through for a half hour. I also had a drawer up on front line so i was working two cashregisters! i was going insane. but i did well and Darlene complimented how well i did. I was happy. Well Ernie came in at 4:00 and said i could go home at 5:00 so i left....then silly me forgot to clock out so i had to call Ernie and tell him to clock out for me lol im so dumb sometimes. I was just in a rush to get home because i was about to die!    well i think im going to bed early tonight not sure yet ill see what happens.....goodnight lOvE Y       I love Sid Vicious Now OMG  SEX PISTOLS BABY!
