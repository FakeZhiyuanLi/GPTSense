      Dear Prada Mu,  I am running off of little to no sleep.  I lost an hour in the trip. (I love time zones) I did NOT sleep on the plane.  So, after not really sleeping during the night, I was at work pushing hard at 6 AM. I worked as hard as I could, with the additional help of bosses visiting and watching.  2 PM I was ready to die.  But I logged out and headed for home.    I stopped at my favorite shopping place Kohl’s and bought some new clothes and new shoes. (I really don’t like riding the trend waves, but I bought some slick new Skechers) I ran to the bank and got some cash and coins to take with me.    Although, I have been to NYC once before, I didn’t really experience it. I rode the NJ ferry to see the Statue of Liberty and saw NYC, but as I was a young child my parents did not want to go into the city for their own reasons (14 years ago, something about terrorists).  Once home and unpacking my new purchases I began grabbing different outfits that would work for anything I had to do in NYC.    Last week’s weather report told me the entire weekend would be rain. (I believe weathermen how much?  I live in STL, monkey pointy at random weather symbols is more reliable)  Just as I was finishing the minor touches for safety, extras, and food, my mom drove up to the house ready to take me to the airport.  -“We are going to be late. You will miss your plane.”- “No, we are right on time according my schedule, I already have my boarding pass!” -“You may not be in NYC tonight”- “WHATEVER!”  Mom (thanks for driving me) dropped me off and told me to be careful and have fun. There is no question I am having fun. I slipped right through security (even the random “We are checking you and your bags very closely” security) and arrived at my gate with a whole 30 minute wait ‘til boarding. HUMPH!  So, American Airlines, from STL to LGA, YOU SUCK! I did not enjoy my flight. I lost an hour, a full plane with many common ignorant flyers (most people call them business men) I had to check a piece of my luggage, I did not sleep, the hot girl next to me was flirting with the guy across the aisle for what I believe business purposes only. (SHUT UP about your friggin’ lumbar or thoracic surgery tools!)  So I have done it, I have arrived in NYC or at least the airport, it is 10 PM, I have not slept not ate, and I am in a good mood, now that I have left the plane.  Ry-Ry (this might me a good time to mention that Ry-Ry, up to the call we had today, thought I was flying in on Friday night [tomorrow night], so I screwed up his evening plans of laundry and a haircut) TXT me and told me he had a few more stops on the bus before he was going to find me.  Ry-Ry want to make plans for this night a small mini-party.  I don’t think I am up for too much excitement this night. FOOD, DRINK, SLEEP (maybe a small walk or tour)!  Ry-Ry shows up, much different than I have ever seen him in STL.  He is much more himself here in NYC. Ry-Ry (I call Ryan Ry-Ry because he has many times called me Bill-Bill.  I therefore respond with Ry-Ry, because Ryan-Ryan has no ring to it.  I have very little problems with it, I find the pet-name thing slightly weird, but I am not a pet-name kind of guy.) Ry-Ry is wearing exactly what I think he would be wearing, STYLE and TRENDS: Ringer shirt, khaki pants with thongs (flip-flops) and a backpack to finish the look. How aweful!  But he is so cute, and strangely sexy.  But of course I am wearing a baseball tee from Old Navy, khaki cargo shorts (see my farmer tan white legs, they go with my tan hide that is exposed every where else)  and my new Skechers. So I ride the bus for awhile and we talk. I get a call form home (Shannon!), very unexpected, she knew I was leaving, we talk but I had to hang up on her. I had to follow Ry-Ry and find a space to sit with my luggage on a NYC Bus. (See how clueless I am)  So after a bus ride I walk though an area that matches the tall-tale rough New York in Harlem.  An Old Navy barred up for the night.  Trash all over the street (AND RY-RY IS WEARING FLIP FLOPS!) to head down to the cesspool of human and tube squirrel (rats) diseases, at least that is what I am told by Ry-Ry. So I try to touch little.  Then we walk about two blocks past what I believe is warehouses, but no there are Ry-Ry’s grocery, drug, and liquor stores.  I walk up with luggage FIVE flights of stairs meet one of Ry-Ry’s roommates, drop off luggage, then return to the streets for an Irish Pub Dinner.  The DRINK (one and only JD and Coke, heavy fatigue/travel/ sleep depervation) made me quite tipsy.  I could not count money, and I knew it.  We didn’t almost pay $10 of our bill.  Ry-Ry and I return to the apartment, get a beer (EW! I am not a beer drinker) to split and head to the “sixth” floor.  The roof!  I love NYC roof scenes!  They always become sexy… alas, no.  We could see the stars, slightly clearer (at least the brightest ones), The Cloisters, and the parks that shroud the northern part of the island that is known as Manhattan.  (I think of TMNT every time I have to type that name.)  Ry-Ry and I talk about family, personal stuff (we are both bi-sexuals [SURPRISE! SURPRISE!]), life, jobs, futures, the living conditions, relationships, etc. After enjoy a night sky with the beautiful Manhattan terrain, I head to his room to enjoy some much needed rest.  Besides Ry-Ry has to work tomorrow.  Who knows what I will be doing tomorrow.  ~Wolfy

      Dear Prada Mu,  I am preparing to leave for NYC tomorrow. Okay, “ preparing ” is NOT the  WORD  at all.  I have bought the tickets, got out a suitcase, told those who are in the need of knowing, know my traveling info.  I have not looked at anything in specifics to do while in NYC. I have not talked much to the others who expect my arrival, and certainly have not dealt with issue that I am just dropping to go on this vacation.  I'm so glad I assume things.  I did e-mail Ry-Ry, the guy I am staying with, on what I would like to while in NYC.  1. Top of Empire State Building. 2. Make out on top of ESB. 3. Find someone to make out on top of ESB. 4. Stroll in Central Park. 5. Do something Yorkerish. 6. Have dinner with Ryan at a restaurant for $100 a plate. (A Vegan[+pork, +milk, +beef] and Veggie, that could be hard) 7. Lebanonese restaurant, I need me some kibbi. 8. Drink at a bar 9. Meet up with Anon and my Buffy group. 10. Some stuff with Ryan 11. See if Joe is coming to the city. (Meet up with Joe) 12. Talk and visit with Ryan 13. Find a call girl. (Just find one) 14. If I am lucky, sleep. 15. People watch. 16. I'm up for anything after that  I !forgot! #17. Go Clubbin'!  I don't want to do too much in the tourists bits. I do want to take ahold of the oppertunities of the city.  In points towards work, I have to complete my forty hours before this week ends for me, so tonight I worked ‘til 11 PM and I will be up tomorrow (this morning) @ 4:30 AM to be at a store @ 6 am to work ‘til 2 pm then I have that time ‘til my flight to get ready to NYC.  HA! Good Luck.  I might not be in NYC tomorrow night!  I hope I can sleep on the plane.  I did when I went non-stop to England.  ~Wolfy

      Dear Prada Mu  Today I feel overrun.  Too many things to do, too many responsibilities to juggle.  I did not plan my life well to fit NYC in. I just left and came back not thinking, enjoying my freedom from responsibilities. No wonder Monday felt so epiph-ic.  I had not landed from my vacation, taken back my responsibilities.  My boss called me today and asked me to work overtime. I just don’t think I can.  My body is getting worn out quickly this week.    I’m tired, tomorrow is Thursday. Where did this week go?  Major is being difficult.  I understand I don’t have the time to play with him, and yes, he is a puppy, a puppy looking at his size and noticing that he is bigger than other things and he has access where he can explore, and find trouble.  Steph got to go out and enjoy Cinco Damio with her girl. I have to talk to her.  We have to get on the same page about our relationship before long.  This is another stress on my life this week.  I have let this go on too long. Alright back to work so I can wake up at 4:30am.

      You know what, no one reads this thing so I can say what ever I want.... There will be more to come.  I just returned from New York City Vacation.  I spent the entire weekend with one man who I consider to be an Adonis, in every aspect of a human. Great smile, mind, beautiful eyes, a body I'd love to know “how many licks does it take” (Lil' Kim I love you).  The strange part is I did nothing to him. Not a thing. I begged and looked for excuses and nearly just jumped him a few times just to have an excuse to start making out with him, but I didn't do anything to him.  A massage, yes.  I do get turned on by the message, as we all know.  (Giving and receiving) Again, I did not become sexual with my New York Guide.  He even told me his Achilles’ heel (knees), but I did not use it to my advantage.  I'm either turning a new leaf or dying.  ~Wolfy

      Dear Parda Mu,  I found out that the Maui Float trip was occurring once again this year, like the past 15+ years. This is the awesome-est float trip of 18-38 year old ever. The ages keep going up because of the brothers that put this trip together.  No reason age gets in the way of this trip.  The Maui trip we float 8 miles down the Meramec River, drinkin', strippin', gettin' wet, wild, and everything else.  At the end of the trip you are sun burnt, hung over, hungry, and DEHYDRATED.  It is a lot of fun.  So anyway I thought it was time I tried to invite a few people along. At least those who will continue to hold my normalcy within good range.  "There is this girl at work..." No really there is, her name is Cara. (Kara with a C.) She is one who is short, and thick but not heavy set due to some muscle underneath.  (Muscle underneath, that is a plus in my book, I don't want a girl who will break, or one who is afraid to break.  I want one who is willing to fight back, a worthy opponent.)  Cara, I know, is quite athletic (she has a rock climbing buddy) and she does enjoy the nature but she isn't a "tree hugger".  She also has a list of men to select her nightings with (So this won't build into a exclusive relationship, YEAH!). Cara also beats on the boys that she works with, so she is not one to back down from a fight or be weak. She is also from a local procial high school, as well as I.(Nothing but pluses here!) AND Dimples in soft tanned cheeks.  She also wears her hair in a braided crown around her head, Princess Leah or an “Native American” look with her softly tanned face  I asked Cara to see her phone and she told me that she didn't have it today. (DAMN!)  Again I went to her and told her simply, "Reason I asked for your cell is I wanted to offer you to drink, no string attached, and if that went well, you could come with me on the Maui Float Trip."  She was shocked and excited, which has never happened when I have asked for a girl's phone number. As I described the Maui trip she became more enthusiastic and excited that I asked her.  I got her number and she realized that she was not disobeying the non-fraternization policy with work 'cause we don't work for the same company.    AHH!  But my company says "Any relationship with anyone is a good thing! Fraternize with everyone, PLEASE!"  My kind of company J  (My boss said he knew we were gonna hook up.  I can't promise all that, but let's not keep our figures crossed)  She is one of he few that I call "Sexy" every time work with them (out loud).  Now I just need to call her. (And work out the details.)  Still, now I just need to call her.  ~ Wolfy

      This night is a depressing one. The Evil Senior Partners (The WB) have canceled another thoroughly well produced show.  Angel was my only portal to the greatest show in my life, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Because of politics and money, those shows have been sent to the DVD shelf. (Thank the gods for DVD TV shows)  Angel did not go without a fight.  The fans fought and bought diligently, just as the show’s creator, Joss Whedon, formed his pieces of masterwork.  Time to drink!  Thank you to all those whose hands touched Buffy and Angel.  A world has banned together and enjoy a great television run. 8 years!  AND SOUTH PARK CONTINUES!!!!!??????????   I DON’T GET IT!!!!!!  So, what should I do now that I don't watch TV?

      FUCK OFF!  Dumb ass meat head! You deserve no position in power. You should be put to death by burning off your pubic hair with a blow torch. Infected with syphilis and chidboma. And if you survive... Publicly humiliated by shoving a young blue spruce up your ass poking your g-spot/ prostate till you cum in your shorts.  You have no respect for those who help you get your job done.  Your area sucked ass and was a customer nightmare. Many people worked many hours in hot weather to make you yard as nice as it was this evening.  Die a horrid, slow, long, agonizing, death.  Unappreciating dumbass meathead.  ~Wolfy   That was load of steam that I needed to get off my chest. Thank you.

      Dear Prada Mu,  Have you every been completely lost at something you are trying to put together?  I was moving my furniture (new and old).  Thing about my brain: I know how everything is suppose to be before I start the project. I know my finished project and everything about it. I know it will be perfect and very comfortable because it will be all about me.  But I can't get that knowledge from my brain onto a piece of paper or  OUT  just so I can produce the brain image.  I worked this entire weekend on cleaning and organizing MY ROOM.  The color, texture, and design of the room was completely created by me. Yet I can not get my furniture to fit as my brain thinks of as perfect.  Finally, after a hard but short Monday I came home and did some finishing touches and nudging. I am not quite done, but everything is finally getting to that image that I have in my brain.  Things are coming together.  You know, how I know?  I feel more and more relaxed and comfortable in my room.  This is my room and it reflects me, my style, my function, my life, my energy... ME!  The largest chunk is completed. A little more detail over the next month and I think this room with match 100% to my brain image.  YEAH!  Wow, accomplishment and pride, this does feel good.  ~Wolfy

      Dear Prada Mu,  I have seem to have stopped writing.  I seem to have stopped posting.  I don't mean to, I just get so comfortable when I return to my home. I also feel that I am not letting my creative energies flow here.  Nothing really creative.  Just the irrelvant daily crap to complain about.  Lets try more.  More energy to posting more creative ideas on this weblog.  This is the day.   ~Wolfy
