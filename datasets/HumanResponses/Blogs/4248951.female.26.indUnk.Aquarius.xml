      It always puzzles me how immigrants change the way our country is when they arrive here.  Don't get me wrong, we are all pretty much immigrants in one generation or another.  I have a problem with people who come here and complain how it was better where they came from.  "Then go back!" I like to say.  If it was so good from where they came, then why leave?  And why force us to adopt their customs and bend our rules for them?  (i.e. Turbans allowed in police uniform, and religious daggers allowed in school)  A friend of mine had a great idea.  The U.S.A should buy us out by giving each Canadian citizen $1,000,000.00, u.s. of course.  We would all be instant millionaires!   The Americans seem to have a handle on their patriotism.  Immigrants are only too happy to give up their past and call themselves an American.  Why are we so different in this regard?  Happy 137th Canada!   Here is an e-mail I received not too long ago;         This says it all! This is an  editorial written by a Canadian  citizen, published in a Canadian newspaper. He did quite a job;  didn't he?                                         Read on, please!               IMMIGRANTS, NOT CANADIANS, MUST  ADAPT.             I'm tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. I'm not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to Canada.            Our population is almost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand.  This idea of Canada being a multicultural community has served only to  dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.              As Canadians, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle. This culture has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.              We speak ENGLISH and FRENCH,  not Spanish,  Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language.  Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language! You can still keep yours but learn ours!              We have many belief's and religion's and no one belief or religion is worth more or less than the other. That's what makes us so unique. We even have the right not to believe.  If you want to participate in your community or belong to a group or organization, It is YOUR responsiblity to adapt to their rules and regulations. Not the other way around.  If the Maple Leaf offends you, then  you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't care how you did  things where you came from.           We as a country of tax paying citizens should not be paying for you to abuse us with our own immigration laws. If you want to make a lawyer wealthier then do it with YOUR own cash.  There should be no discounts or freebee's to immigrants unless we're going to give it to our own unfortunate people too! We'll help guide you, but if there's a cost you have to cover it!            This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle.  Our government gives every citizen the right to express his or her opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do so.  But once you are done complaining, whining,and griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Canadian freedom,THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.

      The whole country overwhelmingly chose the Conservatives, except Ontario that is.  After a whopping budget, that made a liar out of the Liberals, we here in Ontario reward them with yet another term in office and another chance to swindle money from us taxpayers for them to hand it over to their friends.  Well, I guess we will get exactly what we asked for...more corruption.    Although a minority government is good for the people, giving any party three consecutive terms in office is not.  What's more pathetic is how only 62% of us actually voted.

      I really don't like starting something, like a blog, and not continuing with it.&nbsp; I do have an excuse, whether it's a good one or not, I hope to be blogging full gear soon!   Last Wednesday my family went to Niagara Falls, state side, to meet my uncle and family for the first time (complete families that is).&nbsp; We ended up coming home at 3am.&nbsp; Pictures and a short story will follow.   Saturday we had Brian and family over for a terrific day at our house, you can read about that on his blog.&nbsp;  urlLink http://vv.typepad.com/parsontoperson/2004/07/bbq_hungarian_s.html#comments    Thursday we are having Niki's cousin and family over from Georgia.&nbsp; They have 3 boys and 1 daughter....we have 1 boy and 3 daughters.&nbsp; The kids will out number the grown-ups 2-1!   In between we have had an excavator helping me around the house with landscaping and rock removal (large boulders).&nbsp; I bought a new computer, which crashes worse than my old one, so that needs to be returned.&nbsp; Shopping for kids clothes (a real test of patients).&nbsp; I'm doing a renovation job at the beaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these takes a lot of time because we live half an hour from the major stores, and about an hour and a half from the beaches.   Now that I've finished playing my violin, I hope to post as best as I can in the future.

      An article in Christianity today writes;    Former Labor Secretary Predicts Religious War in America   "The true battle will be between modern civilization and anti-modernists; between those who believe in the primacy of the individual and those who believe that human beings owe their allegiance and identity to a higher authority; between those who give priority to life in this world and those who believe that human life is mere preparation for an existence beyond life; between those who believe in science, reason, and logic and those who believe that truth is revealed through Scripture and religious dogma. Terrorism will disrupt and destroy lives. But terrorism itself is not the greatest danger we face."   For some time now (several years), I've been thinking that we are going to endure persecution here in North America.  With all that is going on in the world, how they call evil good and good evil, this maybe a possibility.  Even in such a free state!  I also believe God is moving amongst His people and separating the true followers from the superficial ones.  Persecution would really be the test.

      In regards to our daily life, whether it be at work, home, or school, how much of our own effort do we exert to accomplish a task and how much do we lean on God and let him work things out through faith?  What is the balance?  In the old testament God gave skill to the workers to perform their work.  How much did they have to train/study?    If a missionary is called to go to another language/culture, how much effort, preparation, or fund-raising of his own strength should he make before he goes?  How much time and energy should we use to provide for our families, like getting a second job, or to seek a higher paying job, to make ends meet, or to pay-off a student loan, and how much do we "seek first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you"?

      I have been asked some questions lately, for which I do not have any solid answers.  I will be posting a series of topics/questions in order to provide me with a broader base of information and views toward these questions.  Does healing still occur?  Why haven't I seen any?  Can anyone receive the gift of healing if they ask for it?  I'm not talking about gradual healing here, but rather instant healing.  Here are some verses to fuel the discussion:  Matthew 10:1 He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.   Mark 16: 15He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."

       It has been many years since my brother in-law, Benny, came to Canada to visit us. This weekend we had the privilege of having Benny and his girlfriend Emily over for a couple of days. We had a blast staying up late both nights. Of course, it didn't seem so great a few hours later when our four kids woke us up. They took in seeing the CN tower with my wife on Saturday. At night we had a campfire. They promised us they would be back more often in the future. We look forward to that!  After they left today, we had a lazy hazy afternoon, with one exception. I took the training wheels off my son's bike preparing to give him a lesson on riding without them. Before I could say something, he bolted away and rode off! We couldn't believe it. I guess it was long over-due. He was so proud of his accomplishment and so were we.

       Tonight we had a very nice visit with Brian, Lynn and the kids. They invited us up to the cottage for a BBQ. We (meaning everybody but me) had a nice time swimming in the very shallow, sandy lake in the backyard. If it's not like 85-90 degrees, I'm not interested thank you very much. It's funny where this blogging thing will lead. We met Brian through one of Darryl's blog links, and have gotten to know his family a bit through some visits. The more time we spend together, the more I realize what an awesome family they are, and how easily our 2 families get along. Our combined 6 kids seemed to have a blast, and we adults had a nice time getting to know each other better. It was really exciting hearing and seeing about their Dominican mission's trip. I'm looking forward to spending a lot more time together with them in the future.   UPDATE:  I finally figured out this "Posted By" business!

        Is it just me, or do kids lose their minds when we go shopping? It just started lately, but they seem to lose their hearing and whatever little self-control that they already have. Every excursion these days turns into WWIII where Peter and I are both stressed to the max. We make a point of making sure they're not tired, hungry or thirsty. They've been pretty good about going places before, but lately they have changed big time. Is it just us or do you have the same problem? We're open to suggestions because at this point, we're ready to try just about anything.  Posted by: Niki

       Well, this is my first blog post ever. I haven't quite figured out how to get my name on the "posted by" part, but I'm working on it. There's a lot Peter and I still need to learn here.  We just got back from my in-laws' cottage this morning. We celebrated a couple of birthdays this weekend, my niece's, Katherine who's 9, and my mother-in-law's. We usually go out for dinner and then have cake and presents. We end up celebrating each birthday 3 times a year, at home, with my parents and brothers (in Cleveland), and with Peter's parents and brother's family. That confuses our kids quite a bit because they think they get one year older each time we celebrate (they're 5, 4, almost 3, and 1 1/2 years old). I try to explain to them how it really works, but I don't think they understand completely.  Just wondering, but how do you guys celebrate birthdays? Do you make a big production out of it with relatives or just keep it in the family?  Posted by: Niki

      In talking with my wife, we have decided to share this blog. Rather than have several days without an entry, we could both post and our blog would be current almost daily. I still haven't had time to configure the front page, but I have received some help from  urlLink http://prayingmantis.blogspot.com . This blogging thing is still pretty new to me and my programming skills are lacking.

      We are looking to buy a KIA Sedona (mini van). I'm just wondering if anyone has any experiences or stories about KIA that might be relevant to our purchase.  We have considered other mini vans and you can't match the price of a KIA. Other factors have led us to this vehicle as well.

      No, not my car. I gotta like this tech stuff. I got a new digital camera at work and it's a lot better than our personal one. I decided to take the new one to Niagara Falls with us. I intended to download the images into my work computer and then e-mail them to me at home. I had a hard time accomplishing this and asked the IT department to help me. The next day we had a few power outages at work and somehow it crapped out my computer. The IT dept. had to re-load my computer and in doing so, all my files were wiped out! Sorry, they said. ARRRRGH! I said. Of course the camera disk was erased to make more room for future pictures.  It sounds like a good story and you may be asking if we really went to Niagara Falls or not. But I tell you I did! I really did! I hope some of my uncle's pictures turned out. He used the more reliable film method.

      Sorry I haven't blogged much lately, but my family and I took a little vacation. Rather than put it off for another day, I thought I would post a quick one for now. I just got back today and the garden is over grown with weeds, the grass is very high, the house is just how I left it (messy). Sunday I had the opportunity to go to 707. It's an evening service (actually three of them), which is geared towards youth. They have a website, but I don't know how to get in yet. It felt really good just going in shorts and a tee shirt. The message was awesome. Yet another lesson on holiness. I tell you, the Lord is really talking to me about that lately! I hope to post some more tomorrow.
