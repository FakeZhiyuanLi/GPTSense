      Just created this, blogger, so I feel I should post something.  Not feeling great tonight/this morning. Broke up with my girlfriend, but we're still "friends" so I have to think about everything all over again every time I speak to her. Feel I should find someone else, to get over this one, but I don't know anyone who likes me. Going to see my brother later, maybe he'll help me out. Tried to sleep, earlier, at around one in the morning, but I woke up three hours later, bad dream. Don't want to dream the same again, so I think I'll just stay awake for the rest of the day. Just want to sleep, until next Friday morning, then go out to Sanctuary and get hammered, without a care in the world. Done talking, methinks. I don't want to rant just now, so I ought to stay quiet.  ~

      Well. Haven't updated in a while, because I forgot I'd set this up :P Sorry to anyone who's been checking regularly. I've been utterly unbusy lately. Made tons of new friends through websites of all kinds, some of those 'FaceParty' type ones, and some through a Self-Harm Support website. They're good people to talk to :) Plus, it's fun making new friends. I have a new girlfriend also, as I suddenly got over the last one when I found out she was back on drugs. I'm pretty good at the moment. Happy with my girlfriend, happy with the way my life may go (currently in the inbetween of not working, nor attending college), barely healthy, but that's normal. My head isn't giving me any crap, and my depressions aren't as strong anymore. Haven't cut in two weeks on Thursday. Which is good. I still have the scars though, so I'm reminded of everything everytime I see my arm. Unfortunate, yet in some way, useful. &nbsp; I've been writing a new story, it's coming along quite well. I'm on the third chapter at the moment. The first two chapters can be found on my DevART (  urlLink http://downshift.deviantart.com &nbsp;), and are for anyone to read :) Please leave a comment if you do happen to read. Thanks :)  &nbsp; Trying to think of an article to write for my friend Mike's website ( &nbsp; urlLink www.togzone.com  ), might leave it for now, until I play my new game or read a new book. I've been watching quite a few movies recently though, so maybe I could write a movie review. They're not new ones though, they're videos. &nbsp; Anywho. Random update for now :) Speak soon xx
