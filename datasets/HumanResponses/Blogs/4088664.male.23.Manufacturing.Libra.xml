            Yeah it was hot again today. Today's my last day off before I start Week 1 of hell. I got my full time schedule finally - Sun-Wed 6:00am-4:30pm. But this week and probably next week I'll be working Thursday for 6 hours too. But damn that'll be a nice check. 
      I figured something out at work last week. I'll go my  own  pace instead of busting my ass. That way I can enjoy work somewhat. I just gotta make it three months to get the medical benefits and six months to transfer up to the office. Then from there I can transfer to an ACE location that isn't so friggin far away. And I will hate the smell of peppermint as long as I'm working there. 
      Our computer was down for a while. First no sound and then no internet, but that's all over with. Do you know what's it like to play Super Mario RPG all the way through with no sound? I hope for your sake you don't.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah yeah yeah. First post trying this thing out. For those of you that don't know the Dave I'll fill you in. Born in Seattle, WA 1980; on my 7th year of probation, served some time; work at Ace Hardware; very handsome; hobbies are mountain biking, videogames, writing and playing songs on guitar; lifetime member of Alpha Delta Mu fraternity, my nickname is Sticky-Fingaz; have a girlfriend, Mia. 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I cashed my first check from Ace and started a new savings account. Wasn't as much as I thought it would be, but damn I'll be earning it the week coming up. I'm on Sun.-Wed. 6:00am-4:30pm&nbsp; and  Thu. 6:00am-12:00pm. At $10.25/hr, that's about $503 without taking out the taxes.

        Alright, let me begin by telling you this. Last week, my friend at ACE relayed to me that he talked with someone who's been there 8 years and never got a check for over $400. Yesterday, I got one for $381. Sadly, that is the largest amount I've seen on a weekly paycheck. So of course I'm gonna blow it all.

       I work at ACE Hardware. It's 45 minutes away from where I live. It's wearing me down. Three of the guys I was hired on with and I have gotten into a tight-knit clique: Mr. Popcorn (me), Mexican, Truck-Driver Dude and Rich. TDD is quitting next week, and he offered me a job at his trucking company, US Express. My salary now is pretty good at $10.25/hour, but there's a job around here at Schenectady Steel for like $14.50/hour. Now I know I'm going to be quitting ACE soon, but this is getting tiring. I need a job I can stay at, y'know? I  need  benefits at my age. What really pisses me off is that with my education I can't get anything related to my preferred field. I'm already in debt with college loans and ITT is like $5,890,342,567 per class minute. I want a job I can stay at for a loooong time. I get self conscious about hopping from job to job, but I can't really help it. Sears and Transworld paid way too little, as did Taylor News. Now ACE pays good, but the 45 minute drive on Rt. 87 is hell. Right now, all that could go wrong at Schenectady Steel is if I abhor the place. I mean a guy's gotta enjoy work, right? Damn...
