      Ardrossan North By election result Tory 340, SNP 326, New Lab 259, Ind 99, SSP 78, BNP 23 30% turnout. This was previously a Labour stronghold, since 1980.  I was disappointed in the SSP vote, I had expected double.  The seat however was closely fought and perhaps this has made people more cautious. We do know that we attract from equally from SNP and New Labour as well as folk who have never voted before. The fact that our candidate was not local was an issue, however this should be the last time we have to field someone from outwith the area. We have managed finally to establish a Branch for the 3 Towns.  One of our supporters stood outside the polling station all day handing out leaflets against the BNP, she won't join the SSP due to our policy on Independence. It rained all day Thursday and she got soaked, but I couldnt help but remember her parents, both active socialists now deceased, they would have been proud of her.  We came face to face with the BNP candidate at the Tenants meeting on Tuesday night. There was about 20 present, when the BNP candidate arrived I asked for, and was granted permission to address the meeting. I explained that the SSP candidate could not perticipate in the meeting due to the presence of the fascist BNP. I issued a prepared statement condemning the BNP, and challenged the other candidates present to join me outside where we would be available to speak to tenants.  Funding from the local council for the group is dependent on the group being apolitical, they had to invite all candidates or none, and felt unable to un invite the BNP. So we were outside the meeting and the BNP were able to address the tenants, reports from others in attendance revealed that the BNP candidate was unable to string more than several words together. He said often, "I dont agree with all the BNP policies, but...."  New Labour were devastated at losing the seat, they are used to weighing the vote locally, and the Tory, a jack glass follower, was delighted. A strange result at a strange time.  Had a superb visit from Reidski. Moli cooked a superb Lasagne and a superb chocolate torte, her talents know no bounds. (She forced me to write that) We enjoyed a superb bottle of Malt and a superb blether. Nostalgic and informative, I've a better idea of where Reidski is politically and caught up with other aspects of his life. It is nearly 20 years since he left town and it was really really good to see him. Superb.  Moli has been doing a good trade in cards, kids are good.

      This quote from Alice Walker partly explains why I am&nbsp;physically knackered this evening and yet I am in mental ecstasy. I'll explain why before heading for bed.   My day begins with the news that I'm taken off my usual duty at work to deliver mail on a walk that is a wee bit difficult, then a Union meeting to discuss recent events in the Office resulting from imposed changes. A very positive meeting.   Within ten minutes of getting home Paw phones for help in lifting bricks, his role is purely supervisory! Got home with half an hour to spare before meeting Kerensky to get bus to Ardrossan for the SSP public meeting which I.m chairing with Party Convenor Tommy Sheridan MSP.   The meeting was fantastic, 60 members of the public attend with about 10 local Party members. Our candidate is unable to attend, he is TU Branch Secretary in UNIFI at a Lloyds TSB Call Centre. A matter to do with jobs came up and he felt obliged to stay. He phoned me and I advised him to represent his members rather than chase votes when we could do that for him. He felt a bit better about it.  I explained this to the meeting and they were fine about it.   Tommy was excellent Iraq, Student Loans, Drug misuse, Jobs and Peace were all wound together in a devestating criticism on the madness of the Free Market world thats been created around us, without our consent.  By far the most exhilarating aspect for me was the response from the audience. A good age and gender mix ensured a good healthy debate, not all positive about the SSP, but real people talking. We are told that apathy rules, and of course if people keep voting yet nothing changes for the better it will have an effect on voting figures, but politics is about more than elections. The miners strike of 1984 did more to politicise working folk, especially women,&nbsp;than a million elections.   There were more than a few faces from my Labour Party days in the audience, and some I recognised from the SNP. The SNP candidate did us the honour of attending and speaking from the floor, as did one of the Independents. We gave them a fair hearing but advised them to convene their own meetings. All good natured.   On a more insular point we recruited 3 new members who will attend a meeting in August to establish a Branch of the Party in the 3 Towns.   Some of the issues raised from the floor were heart breaking, one 80 year old ex service woman who was living in damp infested private property whilst being treated for Bowel cancer, a middle aged couple surviving on Incapacity Benefit following Husband's stroke yet being pursued relentlessly for Council Tax that they do not owe. Nuclear Power, Transport, the death of Town Centres due to Hypermarkets and the lack of drug rehab facilities all had an airing.   This meeting took place only because of the efforts of a small band of locals of whom Alice Walker would be proud.   I&nbsp;am in a dilemma as to tomorrow nights Tenamts meeting and have decided to attend after speaking to the organisors, I explained our position on the BNP to them and they have managed to accomodate our requirements. It would be contemptuous of us to relegate their concerns to a party battle.   My mothers family were Orange and objected strongly when the National Front hijacked the Union Jack in the 70's and 80's. (My Fathers family were Republican and called the Union Jack the Butchers Apron, needless to say the marriage didn't last)&nbsp;The BNP are an offshoot of the National Front, established as a more militant fascist party. They have direct contact with a group called Combat 88, who specialise in attacks on Synangogues, Mosques, Gays&nbsp;and non whites.   They forsee a British society which is racially pure, Christian and male dominated. They don't like big business beacuse it is part of the Jewish conspiracy as is the EU. They admire the European facsists of the past and deny the Holocaust.   However I do believe that the more they are exposed the less danger there is of people voting for them. I may be wrong. Apologies on spelling, I'm tired  &nbsp;

      Taking a breather from the by election , although there was a good team out today including the Party Convenor Tommy Sheridan. The by-election is going very well with a lot of expressions of support at the Streetstall yesterday. Monday night I will chair a public meeting with the Candidate and Tommy Sheridan.&nbsp; Hopefully a local Nursery Nurse will also speak on their recent dispute. This group of essential workers have been treated disgracefully by New Labour councils.   On Tuesday night a local Tenants group has arranged a public meeting on Housing issues. I have had to phone round Election Agents to organise a boycott of the meeting if the BNP participate, as is the policy of the SSP. Whilst this may seem a tad anti democratic (people should have the right to vote for whatever candidate they wish, even nasty ones), it serves to highlight that recent efforts by the fascists to appear respectable are merely a smoke screen for their real intentions. I am repulsed by the BNP.   While out leafletting last week I was stopped by an old comrade of mine from my days on the local Council, we were on the same side over most issues and we developed a close relationship during this time. He is still a New Labour councillor, having won and maintained what was a safe Tory seat in the 3 Towns. &nbsp;Despite having given up serious drinking around 6 years ago I spent Saturday evening with him and his wife and a bottle of Morgans Spiced Rum. I had a great time reminiscing&nbsp; over past battles and some of the characters we knew. They are a lovely couple, witty, charming and slightly mad.&nbsp; I had a go about PFI schools and he did his best to defend them. Ended up sleeping on the sofa and got home today around 11am feeling hung over.   Despite a cash flow problem, all the cash flowed to creditors, we had arranged to attend the wedding of a young couple we have known for a long time in the upmarket Seamill Hydro, however, Moli had an accident with boiling water on her tummy and it has scalded badly, being of the artistic type she can be accident prone, and we missed the wedding. Moli is making a beautiful card to apologise for our absence.   We are now counting down to our camping trip to Arran with the Woodcraft Folk in early August. This should be a great camp this year with smaller numbers going. Radical, Zeko, Daisy, Daughter No 1, son in law (to be) and Curly Tops are all going. Curly Tops attended her first camp at age 9 months in Dingwall ! Times New Roman and thewife are camp cooks so we can look forward to a cordon blue menu again, both are accomplished and adventurous cooks. TNR specialises in Fish Custard and Cheesy drinks - yugh. Daughter No 1 and I are organising the Programme for the kids.   Looking forward to visit from Reidski this week, havent seen him in a long, long time.   The setting skies tonight were bright yellow,&nbsp; with shallow sheets of pinkish cloud. Loverly.

       I have now developed an active dislike of monobloc paving!    Had a long discussion with the SSP candidate in the by election, leafletting tomorrow and Saturday. Public meeting with candidate and Tommy Sheridan MSP on Monday evening. Chapping doors till Thursday. People from outwith the area are coming to help, should provide a decent team for streetwork.    It is unlikely that we will win, but in general terms we are coming third, if not second, in local elections. The more work we put in the bigger vote we get out.!     &nbsp;   The situation with the local SNP is interesting. Local MSP Campbell Martin has been expelled for criticism of John Swinney and the general drift to the right of the SNP. He blames Nicola Sturgeon and Roseanna Cunninghame for this, being nodding dogs to Swinney.&nbsp; He recommended a vote for the SSP in the Euro elections and would join us but for the policy that elected representatives only accept the average skilled workers wage, around £25,000. he will now sit as an independent MSP till his times up.    The BNP are standing under the slogan ' Ardossan Patriot' ?    &nbsp;  The seat has been un represented on the Council since the local New Labour councillor had an alcoholic relapse. The New Labour Group did nothing to help the situation until he had missed meetings for six months or a year and debarred himself. We dont intend to make an issue of this, the guy has an illness after all.    &nbsp;  Our campaign is focussed on two main issues -&nbsp;Scrap the Council Tax and&nbsp;Free school meals. A side issue is the PFI scheme for the new RC Mega High School, the need for sustainable employment schemes and drug rehab.   We'll see how it goes.    &nbsp;  Moli busy card making, all local kids having a water fight in the garden, roll on back to school time. We're fighting locally for play areas against an aged councillor who doesnt want them locally - too much hassle he says. Finally got money now can't find sites.    &nbsp;  Had a look at daughters new Graduation portrait , she looks great.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Elections are fun for me, I actively like them, and have got my election heid on at the moment to the exclusion of all else, nearly. The by election is a week on Thursday. &nbsp; Back to work to find that new baw heid manager has admitted to making mistake in moving a popular local manager was a big, big, mistake but cant move him back since this would involve loss of face on his behalf. A loss of face could only improve his looks. The Glesca Fair is usually a quiet time for posties but not today. Mail was heavy but the sun shone bright. Moli and I caught Zeko out twice yesterday in the garden. He says&nbsp; "Poor wee slater" Moli says "There are no poor slaters, they are all well off" Zeko says "Thats a common garden frog" Postie says, "How do you know, because of the way it talks? ( We had a fishtank of tadpoles that we released at Campbells Brig in May) &nbsp; The Scottish Justice Meenester sold another bit of the prisoner escort service to Reliance today. It will be a runaway success no doubt.

      Had a stupendous time in Berwick, although ran out of smoking substance half way through, coped with it very well. Moli, Daisy and Zeko had the time of their lives, Moli is looking particularly good and brown, can't wait till tonight, our caravan was spacious but the bed creaked - if you get my drift, I'll make her feel like a new woman tonight! &nbsp; Daughter No 1 and son in law (to be) accompanied us with granddaughter Curly tops.&nbsp; When Maw and Paw joined us on Friday we had 4 generations of the Postman clan in the Van. It was great. &nbsp; On the way there Paw pointed out where he was born and raised, a wee mining row in Lanarkshire called Cornsalloch. It no longer exists, demolished when the pits shut. His family were strictly presbyterian and he was not allowed to do anything on a Sunday, but told us some tales of what he got up to. We had some heated discussions on politics, paw still supports New Labour. Nuff said. &nbsp; Berwick itself is a nice wee place, changed hands between Scotland and England 10 times in its history, legally declared English in 1886. Remnants of the Town Wall still predominates the Town. Had a couple of pints in the local pub - £1.30 a pint as opposed to £2.30 at the holiday Park. &nbsp; Zeko got a lumber from Edinburgh and when we got home she phoned him within 20 minutes. He was proud as punch Daisy made friends with a wee lassie that was at the park with some other kids from a care home and had a whale of a time. Curly tops likewise, she developed a strong attachment to the Camp mascot Barnaby Bear, the look on her wee face was enchanting when he was about. &nbsp; Was deprived of Radio 4 all week and feel bereft of whats going on in the world but who cares. Watched the by election results and was pleased that RESPECT did so well, particularly in Leicester.  &nbsp; Son in law (to be ) and I listened to two comedians in cabaret but was so engorged with Grolsch can only remember one joke? What do you call two French men wearing sandals? Felipe and Felope. &nbsp; Nipping out to see a man about a dog, then having a long long bath and&nbsp; devoting the rest of the evening, as well as my life, to my Moli.&nbsp;

      Saturday work was murder in the 1st Degree - so much mail, so little time. The silver lining to this cloud takes the shape of a miniature radio thingy which allows me to listen to Radio 4 when pounding the pavement. 'Today' is by far the best source of news UK radio wise although, it has a tendency to follow the lead stories in the national media - symbiotically parasitic relationship if you ask me. John Peel's programme had an ex postie on talking about his experiences in which he mentioned the peculiarity of neighbours names, e.g. The Bridges live near the Floods. My favourite name Miss Philomena O'Flaherty, and another was Ida Love, The Cockwell Inn. sorry!  Had a meeting with the candidate for the Ardrossan North council by election, there are candidates from New Labour, Lib, Tory, SNP, Socialist Labour Party and us, the Scottish Socialist Party. More disturbing is the appearence of a BNP candidate. Ardrossan has historical associations with The Orange Order and Ulster Loyalism, perhaps this would explain it. We've programmed leafet drops, a public meeting with our candidate and the Party's National Convenor Tommy Sheridan. Sheridan, love him or hate him, always draws a good crowd, all for the week I get back from hols.  Visited Moli's Paw while in his locality. He is an anarchist and artist amongst other things. He is always interesting to talk to and has told me some tales. He reckons William Burroughs tried to pick him up in Tangiers when he was younger. That I do believe.  On a sadder front neither of us is fit for the 60's shindig at Chez TNR and thewife's, and perhaps not the SSP BBQ tomorrow, we'll see.

      The flexible labour market, as promoted by free marketeers, operates to its full extent in Irvine, 5th poorest community in Scotland, the other 4 being in Glasgow. Flexible employment is completely different from what happens here. I referred yesterday to our neighbour's employment problems. Suffice to say the meeting came to no adverse conclusion, but we were happy with that.  Casualisation of the workforce has many social consequences, lack of security, anti family shift patterns, low pay subsidised by Working Families Tax Credit and other benefits.  Moli knackered up all night finishing card, tick man loved it, end result was fascinating. It was mechanised, I told her "Fred Dibnah would be proud of you", she wasn't impressed. Women!  Listened to Radio 4 most of the day, recovering from viral infection for which I have taken prescribed anti-biotic which is like a plastic horse tablet. I'm sure I'll swallow them neiggghhh bother!  The afternoon play was unusually emotional, re a woman of 60 odd with breast cancer. I thought of the five women I've known who died from this preventable cancer. It was imaginative, provoking and very funny in parts. well done the BBC.

      One of the great joys of living on the west coast of Scotland are the setting suns which torch the skies over Arran. When shrouded by gun metal clouds the effect is stupifying. It always reminds me of the Ewan McColl? song, that line about 'twisted wrecks of men' always catching in my throat when we sing it with the older kids in the Woodcraft Folk.  It came into my mind tonight when I read an article on the blogg of Reidski, an exiled Scot who's an old mate.  thebigblowdown.blogspot.com The article from the Spectator deals with the current farcical trial of scapegoat Milosovic  Blair is the most warmongering chritians simce the Crusades, five times since 1997. He creates a different burning sky, one which brings horror rather than joy.  He says often he was proud to go to war to save Kosovo. Remeber the pictures of him glorying amongst the thousands of refugee children, the biggest victims in any war, in the camps of Macedonia. Seemingly the kids thought he was David Becham, but this murderer of children made the most of it.  The Former Yugoslavia was always going to be a problem for the project of the European elite, The European Union. Milosevic offered an alternative trading bloc with other Mid and East European states, the newly created states emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union and thence the Middle and Near Eastern States.  Germany was first to recognise Croatia, this allowed other breakaways from Yugoslavia, many with the active support of the US.  Membership of the EU requires the adoption of free market economics to the exclusionj of all others forms of enterprise. It requires wholesale privatisation, to the extent that all forms of community activity are relegated to the pigeonhole of Markets. More on this later.  In my view Serbia was bombed into the Common Market and the Free market as a warning to other aspirant States, it killed the idea of any alternative stone dead along with hundreds of thousands of other Europeans. In a way it was a Civil War, much the same as the emergent United States of America suffered.  Milosovic is different from other political leaders of his ilk in the he was sold by his former state to the International Jurists. Who appoints the Jurists?  Anyway the day was good, layed mono bloc at Mither & Faithers with son in law (to be). It was a beautiful day, I sweated and coughed and spluttered and sneezed like an old pit pony. Got half the job done, more on Sunday.  Zeko grounded for giving lip to Moli, he plays fitba wi the big boys out the back door, ower the big green fence, and never wants to come in. Rather than ask for another half hour he gets lippy. Well now he knows what being lippy tae a lippy veteran means. He apoligised, of his own volition, this evening and I made the most of it! How I love it when they suffer. Daisy spent the whole day trying to get me to relent but she was 'on tae plums'  Moli is finishing off a Birthday card for orr tick man's wee grandson who has a Birthday next week, he darkens oor doorstep on a Fri night - PAY DAY - meagre reward for my effort to deliver the peoples mail. It excellent Shark theme, articulated to  propel the  glittery sharks wee boy ways. Hell crap himself!  Moli is the talent in the Posthouse, very arty and crafty, makes all things, excellent cards by Moli sre sold on The Scottish Socialist Party website, well worth looking at by the way.  Tommorrow Im acting as a friend for the young lassie across the Road at an investigation by her casual employing social services agency. She;s effectively a home help, sent to clients at a weeks notice to feed them, go shopping, tidy up, etc etc. This young women, I know, does more than she should do or is paid to do and is scared stiff to go alone. She has no rights but is allowed to be accompanied by a friend and she asked me. So  The 60's are approaching! Solid Gone Man.

      Not a good day health wise, keep coughing till I'm sick - didnt make wee gardening job but did my own instead. Weeded and prepared a bed for fruit bushes - Raspberry, Gooseberry and Blackcurrant. The New Jersey branch of the family went back to the USA today, wont see son No2 & new wife till xmas.  Council By election took my time pm, prepared canvass sheets and programme for activity. We won't win it partly because we have no visible presence locally, but we feel it is important to stand and allow people the chance to vote Socialist.  Zeko has had his hair bleached and he looks damn good. He went out with his friends and not one of them mentioned his new hair do, he was very put out.  Daughter with BA Hons, son in law (to Be) and grandaughter K visited in the afternoon, she is pregnant and is due in December, near to her maws birthday. She is looking good, the way pregnant women do at a certain stage. We are all off to Berwick for a week, from Monday. I am looking forward to it very much.  Need to find 60's gear for party at Chateau TNR on Sat.  Weather here today was tremendously hot and sunny, but a breeze is picking up in the trees now. They have had it bad in the South of England according to the TV.   The Hillsborough disaster was made infinitely worse for the suffering families by the scandalous approach of the Sun comic under Sir Kelvin McKenzie. Footballer Rooney is an idiot to have anything whatso ever to do with that rag of Murdochs. Some people find it so easy to sell their loyalty to the highest bidder.  In bed last night Moli asked if I could hear an aeroplane close by, I said, "Don't tell me I've left the landing light on again". How we laughed.  Michael Moore on channel 4 news re new film. He's happy for folk to download the movie free of charge on the Net. the more I hear of Moore the more I like him.

      Work better today, the volume of mail was managable and I had a casual to train on the walk. casuals are treated very badly by Royal Mail, as in most places. They get all the shit jobs to do, no protective clothing, short term contract with no security. About 2 in 5 of them are made permanent employees. This guy had worked in the recently closed Ayrshire Metal Products factory for seven years. He told me how management gave work away to concentrate on one particular aspect of production and when this didnt generate enough profit they closed the place. Although indigenous to Irvine, the head office had been moved to England along with new investment. the AMP site in Irvine is near the Harbour area and as such will sell for millions for exclusive property development. some workers had been in the place for 25 years and came out with the State minimum redundancy. Figures released today show that 3/4 million such jobs have been lost since Blairday 1997.  Weather is glorious, garden drew me in for a couple of hours.  GMB now withholding money from New Labour under the pretext of supporting individual MP's who support their policies. Doh.  My own union, despite many attacks on the Post Office, still donates to New Labour but most posties in Irvine have now withdrawn their money from the part of the Political Fund used to fund New Labour.  Moli received today a pot by Bernard Leach to go with the Clarice Cliffe plate. They are lovely. Her maw now lives in Texas, but they speak together every week, I know Moli misses her.  Tonight working on election letrature for by election. Good candidate in Comrade Sean, he has done a lot of good work in the area and is sound as a pound. Despite repeated efforts I cannot get political activity out of my blood. I refuse to give in to despondency about the possibility of changing society for the better. I sometimes wish we had Callaghan back! He tried to shake my hand at Brighton conference in 1976, being young and stupid I thought it was a grand political gesture to refuse, I'm a bit sorry about that now. That was the year Healey had to get off the plane to Washington to come and address conference on the refusal of the IMF to grant the UK credit. My how time ticks, black and busy.

      Work was mayhem, senior manager newly recruited from Prestwick Circuits has moved a popular and effective local manager and his annointed replacement is one lazy, useless, social climbing tosser. As a result of this and the drastic changes to prepare the PO for privatisation, some good people of Irvine have no regular postal service - it is now delivered as resources allow.  There is a common theme with these privatisations, firstly starve them of investment so that the service deteriorates, then point to private investment and ownership as the solution. The privatisation of the Post Office will be carried out according to the Maastrich Treaty provisions of the EU. Regardless of opinion nationally and locally.  son no. 3 - Zeko, built a medieval village today with a pal, a perfect example of anti sectarianism - Zeko in his new Celtic away strip and his pall in the red white and blue. Zeko goes up to Secondary school in August, he's turning into a wee man.  Went a bike ride with Daisy as the sun was setting over Arran. We walked the riverbank at Cambells Brig and saw, wild Iris, Geranium, Rose Bay Willow Herb and a wild garlic. Daisy brought a flower home for Moli who was chuffed.  Was reading again Stupid White Men by the wonderful Michael Moore, how Bush stole that Election was a fine example of political chicanery.  That Fraud Francis Fukuyama (End of history) was on the box. He reckons that the ideological war has been won by something called 'liberal market democracies' Now he says there is aproblem with failed states.   Agreed tonight to be the election agent for the Scottish Socialist party candidate in the Ardrossan North by election. Up the workers!

      The mythological Circe was an enchantress who bewitched Ulysses' men turning them into pigs, the only remedy was to eat a herb called Moli. From henceforth the scuptress will be referred to as Moli. She has certainly enchanted me!  Sunday is horseriding day for daughter No 2, Daisy, she was on Windy today. It's an appropriate nomenclature, he regularly breaks wind while Diasy is on him. So much so it sounds like a two stroke engine, phut, phut, phut.Daisy has gained a lot more confidence and is quite a natural.  Sunday Herald, awful little Scotlander rag, carried an interview with the Scottish Justice Minister - she won't resign while she, "enjoys the confidence of the First Minister". The article notes that she was elected to the NEC of the Labour Party to oppose Blairite reforms. Does she still regard herself as on the Left - "I don't stop to think about it quite as much" Oh well then.  As someone who knew her when she was building her political career I find it hard to find any features that would distinguish her from the rest of the Blairite pack. But then neither of us is the same person we were twenty years ago.  Budd Schulberg has written in the Sunday's that Marlon Brando didn/t want to do on the waterfront due to Kazan appearing as a friendly witness at the McCarthy show trials. Sam Spiegel had to smooth talk Brando into it. Some have said the film was anti union, the film was refused by every major studio in Hollywood and had to be made cheap, on the East Coast of the USA. If it was indeed anti union the studios would have spent millions producing and promoting it.  Radio 4 this week interviewed some guy in England who had changed his name by deed poll to Marlon Brando, and had named his son likewise.

      up with the larks at 5am, biked to work, dropped off 30 bags of mail, max weight 19kg each to drop boxes for other posties to deliver. Completed a 21/2 hr delivery, collected Kilwinning mail from 7 post boxes, collected Irvine's mail and took the lot to Kilmarnock. Finished at 1.30pm. 2pm re-commence work in parents garden with son in law (to be), mixed several batches of concrete and laid foundations for small wall. Home at 5pm knackered.   While laying the founds I was reminded of the time my Dad got me a summer job working on a building site as a general Labourer, when I was sixteen. I was working with a guy from Patna, mixing concrete and laying it to a level. As we left the founds to set he said, "The mix will set quicker if you jump up and down on it, bring the water to the surface so that it can be dried out by the sun". Me being a novice spent around forty minutes doing the dying fly in this trench, till the gaffer told told me to "go make the tea son"  Have been reading Tom Paine, a political life - by John Keane. It's very good.  The Sculptress and I have similar flu like symptoms and not feeling great. Early night tonight.  Had Mither laughing today when told her that somebody she doesn't like had landed a job at the butchers, acting the pig in the windae.

      Following work today self and son in law (to be) were revisiting parents back garden to complete transformation from family garden to one suitable for their age, somewhere to sit near patio doors, minimise grass area and reduce flower beds. I couldnt hide the Irish navvy blood in me when swinging that pick and shovel. All is going well when we got soaked, so now my burbling cough has morphed into a bark, cant be anything to do with the smoking?  Marlon Brando is dead, I hated Streetcar but adored Godfather and Guys and Dolls, but way beyond any of this was his portrayal of the 'rogue' US general Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. He was a trendsetter and on the side of the native North American Indians. It's a wee shame so it is.  the Scottish Justice Minister's favourite company Reliance, compaline to Strathclyde Police that Police Officer on duty at Glasgow Sheriff Court were whistling the theme tune to the Great Escape whenever Reliance employees passed by, They've been told to stop it, so they have taken to shaking their trouser legs a la escapees scattering soil on the parade ground. Lots of experience with lifting trouser legs have the Scots Polis.

      While breaking my hymen blog wise I was instructed by the Scuptress that she had drawn me a bath, well I thought she meant a sketchy thing, but in fact it was a water filled Radoxy mixture which has left me Piney perfumed. Later I may well have a piney perfumed log!  I had meant to say about my older daughters' graduation from The University Of Paisley that David Hayman was made a Dr at the same event, he made an impassioned plea for these new graduates in Media theory and production to do something socially useful with their new skills and opportunities. Well done Davy. Was well chuffed that my hero Tony Benn ahd been granted a Doctorate by University of Paisley as well as my girl.   New Labour voters please note, Daughter now has just under £30,000 student debt!   Saddam Hussein appeared today through the ether? Surely he should be tried along with Bush and Blair, this would be more economical as well as just.   kids on Summer? holidays, the scuptress tempted them to a walk along the Beach to Barrassie, they got as far as 'The Dragon' and the kids were too cold and wet to go any further.  Change of affections from defeated French team to Portugese team, soley due to Ronaldo and his earrings.

      Following the example of my good friend and immoral compass TNR I have started to Blog. We'll see how it goes. Now Alistair Cook is dead there may be a gap in the market. Day off workToday was spent in the garden, weeding , pruning and feeding, lots of magpies about, they have been enjoying a resurgence in their numbers recently.  Yesterday attended older daughter Graduation at Ayr Toon Hall, she gained her BA despite giving birth, having a miscarriage and having her partner hospitalised twice - a remarkable victory over events. She made me well proud and when she appeared on stage a wee tear slipped out my eye and trickled on the end of my nose till I sniffed it up.  Grannie Etta also cried, "Im glad she'll no be a waster like her Dad!" she joked, well I think it was a joke.  Big Blogger is watching you!

      It has been a hectic few days, work on Monday was horrendous - so much mail, so little time. Tuesday did a couple of reports for local MSP, not much else, except dispatch old Woodcraft Folk minibus to the scrap heap. We had it a long long time and its been all over the UK carrying us all to Camps, conferences, CND Rallies, The Nelson Mandela Freedom March etc etc. It has carried children and adults of all nationalities - Polish, Maltese, Indian, Palestinian, Western Saharawi, Norwegians, Latvians, Lithuanians, French, Swedish, Welsh, Irish, English and Scottish. A real mini bus of Babel. It was an F plate Ford Transit 12 seater, big brash and yellow and a real sweetie to drive at first. I only ever remember it breaking down once, on the way to the New Forest, when the exhaust fell off and we had a skinny teenage member climb under and tie it up with a scarf. We carried on into Southhampton sounding like a Chieftan Tank, we turned a few heads that day. My fondest memories of the mini bus were when it was stapped fu wi weans all singing their wee hearts out - H Bomb Thunder or the Mighty Song of Peace or the Diaorrhea song - "People thinks its funny but it's really brown and runny" - a classic, but not one for the parents to hear.  The weather has been muggily damp, we've waited for thunderstorms most nights to no avail. Today when I was talking to my neighbour Wullie at the front gate, a muckle seagull swooped and grabbed a wee sparra that was perched on oor roof. The Gull shook it till it's neck broke and then fought other Gulls off to eat it. This neighbourhood is getting less like the Bronx and more like the Serengeti!  Moli has got us all ready for Camp tomorrow on Arran, I'm looking forward to it as are the sprogs. Over the last few days I've finalised the programme of activities and hope all goes well. Not a big camp this year, around 30, but more manageable and less work. My favourite part of camp is at night when the kids are bedded down, sitting at a smouldering camp fire with a glass or a smoke and good company. I always get a feeling that others have done this before us, in this spot,before their own warming fire, searching the same skies, sharing the same hopes and fears but seperated by the mists of time. Then you get bitten by a midgie and eff off to bed.  Moli is not joining us (pathological hatred of insects) and will have to suffer a period os calm and tranquility Chez Posties. Poste Restante till Tuesday.

      Peter Ross interviewed Robbie Coltrane in the Sunday Herald mag. "A woman walks into a Bar - The Barman says "What are you having/" She replies, "I'll have a Double Entendre", so he gives her one. Edinburgh Book Festival pull out Toni Morrison compares todays USA to days of McCarthy with the Patriot Act. Chomsky reckons USA on permamnent war economy, agreed by political elites. And yet, it was a beautiful sunny day here today, lounged about, cooked dinner twice to accomodate Zeko's fitba training, nows plays for Irvine Meadow Boys Club!
