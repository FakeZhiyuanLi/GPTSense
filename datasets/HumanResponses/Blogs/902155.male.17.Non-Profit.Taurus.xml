      Once again I have a ton of work to do for school... and I thought I had just finished everything last week. I am working on writing the oral part of my group presentation on Voltaire for Wednesday, but I have to finish it by tomorrow so we can rehearse. I have to do 10 more journals by Wednesday too, and I have to read a health chapter by tomorrow. Speaking of health, today we had our first end-of-the-month test. I completely bombed it. I did not know anything that was on it! I had no idea it would be so hard, so I just studied for only 10 minutes on the way to school.  Well, September is over (thank God!). The dodgers didn't make it to the playoffs, so I'm pretty disappointed. But the Angels did, and I'll probably go for them. I'm not really a baseball fan, but I'm starting to like it more.

      OK... my first post. What to say... I have a bunch of homework to do, I wonder why I'm not starting it yet. I have so many questions to answer for chemistry, but it's not due for another week. Speaking of school, these first few weeks have been really hectic. I don't know how long it will take for me to adjust to my harder workload. It rained a little yesterday, I'm so excited for some reason to have this cool, cloudy weather back. I must be tired of all the summer sun. Anyway, I'm so happy that September is almost over. I've been trying to think of all the reasons that it's my least favorite month. It's my allergy season, the first month of school, the end of summer, and the height of hurricane season (actually I like the last one-hurricanes are pretty exciting to watch). Also, September is the worst month for the stock market, and is a month where the air is really smoggy with the fire season.

      Finally the weekend is here! I have a 3 day weekend because of the freshman retreat. I can still remember my freshman retreat. As I look back on it, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I would like to do it over again, it had fun points, and I would have taken more advantage of it. I had to do a presentation on Voltaire last week (as I mentioned earlier) and as I was writing our oral report, I randomly decided to make it into a song. The song that was stuck in my head was "Sk8er Boi" so I just changed the lyrics to make it about Voltaire. Well we didn't use it in our presentation because no one wanted to sing, which is understandable. Yeah, I have no life.

      Right now I feel like I had just lived through a tv show. OK, let me explain. You know in a tv show when after all the conflict and/or drama of the show is over, everything has a nice little happy ending. Well,  today was really stressful and right now that it's over, I feel just like everything will be better. I have reached my little happy ending for the day. I wish I could always feel like this! My life for the last few weeks has been an emotional roller coaster, and now I'm riding high on top of a hill. I'm so tired now, I'm probably just going to sleep. I haven't gotten a good sleep in a long time.

      Today started off ok, then became really bad, then slowly got better, then showed signs of hope, and finally had a nice happy ending. Waking up today was really hard, since not only is it a Monday, but it is the first Monday after Thanksgiving break. The whole school day seemed like one big dream. Anyway, getting ready for school was hard since I was half asleep, but I didn't take a shower and finished before the carpool arrived. Or so I thought. I couldn't find my glasses. I had to spend five minutes looking for them, and meanwhile Q arrives. They eventually turned up on the downstairs chair, but my hopes of being ready before carpool arrived were over. English class was definitely the worst part of the day. By lunchtime, things were looking up and there were signs of hope that life isn't all that bad.

      Looks like the rest of this summer isn't gonna be as uneventful as I planned. I'm excited about all the travel I'm gonna be doing. I'm supposed to be booking hotel rooms for the road trip to Seattle and all that, but all I have so far is a room in Moab for 2 nights. I've been looking at maps for the past several days to fine-tune the route we're gonna be taking on the trip (I'm also obsessed with looking at maps). So many places we'll hit: Petrified Forest, Canyonlands, Arches, Rocky Mountain, Grand Teton, and Yellowstone National Parks, Mount Rushmore, Denver, Salt Lake City, Moab, Flagstaff... again, so excited!  I'm visiting a total of 12 states on&nbsp;this trip!&nbsp;  Oh yeah, did I mention I'm gonna be in Germany for a month? Whoa, this is gonna be a great summer for travel.  I need to do more summer-y stuff... I just realized that I haven't been to the beach in 3 years! By "to the beach" I mean feet-in-sand, not just walking down the street or on the pier. I wanna see more movies, go bowling, and go to six flags. Whew, I sure am ambitious. Whateva.

      Summer days... just lounging around the house all day... not much to do... looks like I'm gonna have a lot of time over the next few weeks to post. Today was just another  day . I've gotten to the point where I can't tell if it's Monday, Thursday, or Saturday; it's just another day.  Went to weenie roast a week before Saturday. It was fun. SQUID! AAAH! heheh.  We got there pretty late, so we (sadly) missed Story of the Year, Yellowcard, and most of New Found Glory. It was fun, once we figured out what our vip passes could do.

      Today I took my senior portrait... or did I get my senior portrait taken? Anyway, today was senior portrait day (at least for those of us stuck at the end of the last-name alphabet). So I had to wake up early (relatively speaking--it's summer) to get my hair made all spiffy. Yep, I got a haircut. It's been over 5 long months since my follical outgrowths last experienced the horror and tragedy of the barber's crunching and snipping shears. It’s gonna take a while to get used to having short hair. I guess it’s less maintenance, but the downside is that I don’t get as much shade.  So back to the daily chronicle of my existence. The portraits took longer than I expected. I was at school for over 1 and a half hours. The "creative" poses were just cheezy... I wish I had an instrument to pose with. It's times like this when I wish I had a kazoo. Or a xylophone. Or a diggery-do. You know, that Australian instrument. I wanna go to Australia. Hey, Triana's there right now. Shout out to Triana vacationing in Australia. Yeah! Winter during July! Whoa, I digressed. You have to stop me next time, ok? So after my pictures were taken, I had some time to murder—I mean kill—so I ate at Pinks... Mmm, getting hungry just thinking of it. They have surprizingly good onion rings. Very battery. After picking up my mom (Hi Mom!) from work, I ended up in the Eagle Rock Plaza, where I had a smoothie. I have some sad news to report. Big Boy’s is no longer there. It’s getting replaced by a Jollibee’s. I guess it’s good that there’s gonna be a Jollibee’s nearby, but why, oh why did you have to conquer and destroy that poor, harmless, cheerful Big Boy? I don’t know where the nearest Big Boy is, but I’m gonna make it my quest to find it. I mean, c’mon... taken over by a Jollibee! Heh heh, now I have a funny image in my head of a giant red Jollibee chasing after Big Boy.  Aaah... another digression! Did you try to stop me? If so, give yourself 3 points. Whateva. I am done.

      Talk about a long time!  One and a half years gone by, and the blog that was supposed to be the greatest ever just deteriorated in sad neglect. Well, I guess it has risen back to life. Look out for more posts as the summer progresses. (How appropriate... this is the first day of summer)

      Well I'm leaving tomorrow for my family road trip to Seattle (via Utah, Denver, and Yellowstone). Been busy today getting things ready for the trip, and I'm still not done packing! Had to take my uncle around, then I had to wash the car, and we picked up the rental car. Getting by after my mom lost her cell phone last Monday (when I picked up my summer reading books) is pretty hard. Remember life when it was common to go out without a cell phone? Ah, 90's nostalgia. What else... went to warped tour on Thursday... It was awesome... I think I got sick the next day from inhaling so much dust when I was in the pit. I was really lucky to get the car. Jamie and Katie are cool to hang around with. I don't see what Triana has against her. Oh yeah, Triana's getting back tomorrow, the day I'm leaving!  Went to Hooters in Burbank (yes, it's open now) on Monday with Adrian, Jen, and Angela. It was quite an experience. Then we hit Urban Outfitters again. That's about it.  Haven't been to the beach in over 2 (maybe 3) years... I really need to go soon. Before the exchange trip going-away party. I need to get less... fat.

      I'm leaving on Tuesday for the exchange. Really excited. Need to finish packing. I've been busy getting ready for the past few days but I'm still far from done. Yesterday there was a going away party (if you can call it that) for the exchange group at Sean's house by the beach. It was fun. We couldn't find the invitation, even after looking for several hours all over the house, so my family just looked up the address and went at a time we thought would be appropriate (around 3:30) . Turns out, the invitation was in my mom's purse the whole time! Argh! Well let me try to recap the past week: Saturday (7/24): Jonathan and I planned to hang out today, and I came up with the novel idea of inviting the whole big brother group. Matthew and Jason couldn't come (busy w/ touring San Diego and baseball, respectively). Somewhere in between Ng calls and wants to hang out too. So it ends up being me, Jonathan, John, Brian, and Ng. We saw  The Bourne Supremacy , which was an awesome action flick. Great camera shots. I went to Panda for the second day in a row. John and I get almost the exact same fortune. Whoa. Sunday (7/25): After mass, went to pick up vacation pictures (10 rolls) from Costco. My mom and I swing by Best Buy to look at digital cameras. We eat baja fresh. There are a lot of asians there. My aunt and my cousin came over. They were planning to shop for a digital camera. So were my mom and I. So we all went to Best Buy. We end up getting the same camera, and I get a scanner/copier/printer/fax. Whoohoo! Hence my ability to post pictures online now ( urlLink http://jtab.photosite.com ). We ate at panda afterwards (my third day in a row). There are a lot of mexicans there. Monday (7/26): Woke up around noon (as usual), ended up going to Burbank to plan what to do on Tuesday for the TBS in store/concert. Took Adrian. Met Triana, Jen, Angela. Chris was sick. I went to panda for the fourth day in a row. Somewhere in between I get convinced that staying over at Jen's is a better option than staying at home. So Adrian and I stay over. We walk around at 2 am, racing shopping carts and stealing flamingoes. Technically, this is already Tuesday, so Tuesday (7/27): We get to sleep at 5 am. Jen has to take Ang to school at 7. Me and Adrian sleep more. After picking up Angela, we end up hanging around Montrose, then Angela's house. Hmmm I guess we're not gonna go to the concert. Oh well. Wednesday (7/28): Did nothing. Stayed at home all day. I must be tired. Or lazy. Or my usual self. Thursday (7/29): Surprize party for Jen's bday. Ang and Tri take her to Outback as Adrian picks me up. We blindfold her and take her to the beach. No one told me exactly which beach. Adrian hits a parked car. End up somewhere near Huntington Bch. We pounce upon an abandoned bonfire. Me: "Toilet paper makes me ANGRY! AAARRH!" We leave for Tri's sis's house in Long Beach. Me: "You might as well just crash the car now." Friday (7/30): Do nothing all day. Go to a viewing in the evening in Hollywood Hills. Look around Barnes + Noble for some travel books. I buy a new CD case at Best Buy. Saturday (7/31): Exchange party at the beach. I spend over half an hour looking for a parking space (if only we looked at the invitation we didn't know we had). Sunday (8/1): Everyone wakes up late, so we go to church at the Cathedral. Then eat at the Pantry.  Go to Pasadena for more exchange essentials. Radio Shack and Vromans. I should be packing.
