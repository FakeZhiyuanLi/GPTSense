      Here's a little list of awesome quotes that I've heard. 4 5h1zz13. (You know you wish you could write in Internet-ese like that!) Oh, and in order to increase the humor and the "non-sequitor-ness" of this list, I didn't put a reason for why that quote was said, unless it was  really  required to get it. Like,  really really  required.  1. What country is your guy from? (Michael) 2. When I tried to e-mail Michael it said user... dead... or something... (Jason) 3. My brother is about to carve a bar of soap with a pocket knife... and I don't know why. (Dave) 4. And one year you were a witch, and it was itchy! (Michael's mom) 5. Other people may consider other people, but I sure don't! (Michael) 6. Its got little people legs for fingers! (Dave) 7. Some guy's gettin' pummeled by old ladies!... Hey, he's got a broken arm. (Dave) 8. But, ya' know, being around weird people can make you hungry. (Dave) 9. Oh look, a wild strawberry vine! (Random lady at Japanese garden, as she points to a grape vine) 10. Unless you get the chunk kind. Then it would be chunky... and sticky. (Dave, about Peanut Butter) 11. That monkey looks like a Japanese monkey. (Michael) 12. You're mean, Mr. Funnypants! (Andrew) 13. Hey, It's Coombsy-Woombsy! HI COOMBSY-WOOMBSY!!! (Derek) 14. STOP BOOPING ME!!! (Derek) 15. 'Cause he was... uh, fascist. Wait, oh, you mean he was Communist? Same thing, right? (Some Stupid kid) 16. What? Anacondas are  real ? I thought it was just a movie! (Some other stupid kid) 17. I shall vomit in 13 minutes! (Sarah) 18. My fan says "Don't move" really loudly before I go to bed. (Sarah) 19. Well, I'm  confidant  that I've made mistakes, I just can't remember them right now. (G.W. Bush) 20. Oh, cool! It's poopy colored! (Sarah)

      Hello all. This is my blog. Instead of use it as just a play-by-play of my how my day went, I'll probably use it as a place to dump my opinions. This is my little corner of the internet, so to speak. And I'll use it to show the world my superiority. Because no matter what you say, I'm better than all of you.  *cough* Anyway....  So, yeah, I hope you all enjoy reading this. If you don't, oh well, it's obviously all your fault.  Well, I'll cya next post.
