MR NIU, kept ask me to cut my hair... FUCK rite? trying to grow my hair but being stop then hair short, spike up by itself, i got fuck by my discipline master again.. I hate that mr niu, i really wish he could just die you know? i wish he could fuck himself with a gun and blow his brain out.. SHIT, my hatred coming back.. what he said really felt like a knife stabbing my heart and till now, it's still bleeding.. as i was trying so damn hard, fucking hard, not to think back about my "dark" past.. but then again, his fucking brain cant control his god damn mouth that say something about the fucking 4d class photo.. then, i cant take it i cry like fuck.. man, it's been long since i cry, i dont like crying but what are you giving me a hard time? i mean, what for again? trying to piss me off? "FUCK YOU ALRITE?" my mood is really dampen by this, for now, i cant get over it again.. THANKS MOTHERFUCKER........ i hate him, not going to talk, look, jus fuck care him from now onwards..............  sheez, i dont know......... is been long since i ever chat with her or even talk to her... i dont know, i really scared.. is not about shy but is about rejections.. maybe she's trying hard to forget me or maybe avoiding me... or maybe she's still ____ me... but i dunno why she never contact me.. should guys always be the one to take initiative if he love the person? like talking? why girls cant take initiative?? i dunno....... but i got a mixed feeling because, i feel bit not good while talking to her or chat with her.. is like i am pestering or irritating her that she doesnt wanna talk much with me.. but i really wanna talk to her....... confused huh? guess what, i let fate decide it.. maybe there's hope for love to continue, maybe there's not, but give it a try.. if fail, i will be sad but at least i try.. to show you that i have found back my real self and..............................................  +sigh+ i never see my good friend danny poh at the chalet.. something happen in my family then lost a chance to see him... miss the time when we lame around with tommy and him.. we call ourself the hopeless row and yet we excel in some subjects and feel quite proud.. hahahahhahahaha.... happy memories that i will not forget...  being yourself is difficult because people might not like the way you are.. to compromise or to fuck care?? whatever choice you make, just be happy.. take care fellas.........

      yo, what's up people.. how's your life lately? have it been good? have it been bad? we all happen to live in this world that somehow, full of problems to rack our brains..  damn, my life aint so well... firstly, my chinese o level exam was a crap... blame myself actually, play too much, dont even care about the exam at first.. i got a c5 but nothing to sad about.. still got another chance and hopes are still alive.. as you know, dont let opportunity slip out of your hand cause it may happen once in a lifetime.. is a sure thing that i gonna retake my exam.. no thoughts about it..  then life became so torturing at home.. i dont know why.. what the fuck is o level? is it really so fucking important? do i have to study 24 motherfucking hours? i dont know and fuck it.. PRESSURE, NO FREEDOM.. what the hell.. at least give me a chance to relax as i playing my computer or watching tv.. maybe hanging out.. sheez.. there's also something happen that knock out my brain that i began to stop studying for the past few months.. i dont know what is it, but i try my best to pick my pace up again.. +sigh+  moodless to say anything.. grab hold to your opportunity, or you will be regretting in your whole life..
