       Ew. Ew. I feel disgustingly ill, and dirty. Why? I don't know. Had another odd dream, this time involving one of my friends.   Heh. Let's not get into that. I will now try to get another crack at this God forbidden English paper, AGAIN. Must I be constantly tortured? Possibly so, due to my insanely large amount of sins commited against acts of man. Such as..  Well, too complex for my mind, and chances are, yours too. Good day all.

       My friends are irritating me like no other.  And George Secoff (sp?) please die. My head hurts, and a slight progress on my English paper.   Meow kids, meow.

       I'm seriously obsessed with this song.  "Paint the Silence" by South. Download it now.   As in this second.

       I'm incredibly bored right now, trying to work on my  Of Mice and Men  English paper, Mrs. Green assigned. God, how I hate her. She is the worse teacher I've had in my life -- after Mr. Martinez who insists on bothering me  EVERY FREAKING DAY  of my natural born life. Kthx. Go away now.   Anyway, my head hurts. A lot. I think I'm starting to go insane, because last night I had a dream that I was Rachel Bilson. Omfg. That would've been awesome. Making out with Adam Brody? Heck yes.   But back to reality, where I do  not  (sad, as it is) make out with Adam Brody. In fact, I don't make out with anyone. How pathetic is that? Flirting = teh sux0rs.   In other news, I've gained about 30 pounds within the last three days. Hip hip hooray. Must make plans to do some sort of physical excerise besides watching television, or going on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM tm).   The glory of my life. Le sigh.

       I've been thinking, and well I realized how everyone's lives that are important to me in some aspect is associated with the eighth grade. Back in the day with Mr. Rowland, Mr. Eckstrom, and Mrs. Frye constantly spazzing out at us. I miss those days, guys. I keep thinkinh about how happy I was back then, and now I'm miserable.   Old (well, fifteen) and miserable. Alone too. Actually, the alone part I chose, but I guess I don't have to be alone if I truly didn't want to be. Stalker and Fransico are so both willingly to "free" me from my chain of elusiveness. If Cesar can't do it, they can't do it. My mind is so oddly tormented by the fear of making the mistake of choosing the wrong person.   My personality change comes from the eighth grade too. In fact, I noticed almost everyone else's did too. It just progressed, and transcribed itself into our daily lives. Our own shallowness, and weaknesses surface. What makes us who we are now seems so.. surreal. I'm close to tears, as I write this. Why? It all boils down to what/who we meet that can truly affect us.   I think there hasn't been an influential person in my life since that time period, and it's left me feeling drained and empty inside. I feel like exploding inside half the time. Maybe that where my anger comes from, I'm not sure.   When your world breaks down, you can't just simply pick yourself up. No matter what, the scars are there. Hidden, or seen I'm still so unsure of the way things are now. It adds on how much Cesar reminds me of Rory. Monday- I finally saw Rory for the first time in forever. Like, a long really good look at him. He used to make me happy, like Cesar did/does. I don't know, but that affected my entire state of mind. It made me rethink some of my actions. Maybe, just maybe, it had to do with the fact since that day I've wanted to cry everytime I see Cesar.   He's not who I thought he was. He pulled off a whole fucking charade with me. For once in my goddamn life, I felt stupid. I ignored the warning signs, the cautions, every little thing. Why did I break my own rule? I'm still confused as how he makes me start to hyperventilate one second, and the next make me repulse him.  When he's near, I want to die. It's not the happy feeling anymore. It died. I killed it, because I decided to wake up, and smell the coffee. Plus, the old feeling of longing returns. He doesn't fit in with the crowd. He'd probably miss every damn sarcastic joke I ever make, or everything for that matter. He's dense, stupid, and I still want him. Har, I contradict myself so bad.   School work piles on, and all the teachers drone about getting your act together. My mind drifts away, thinking about writing a lot lately. Linh made me think on Thursday. I had so much fun that night. Shooting hoops (which I made a lot, by the way :D!), chowing down on pizza, and just having a good talk. I was  enjoying  myself. Then I had to go home, and do so much work, I almost cried. I got  five  hours of sleep. Woke up at 5:58 AM only to start another painful day. The day seemed depressing. I spent most of the time just talking about SAD, and randomness with Jolanda. I guess, sometimes I seem happy, but I'm not. Ugh.  I'm so mixed up about everything. I want to scream and kick at the world. I want to break down crying. Instead, I bottle up everything inside....

       Blech. I skipped Mock Trial today, because before 6th period, Guria and I went to ask Mrs. Goldsmith we had it today. She said that we could practice if we wanted to, but she implied that we really didn't have to. I was feeling uber crappy, so I called Anita so that I go home early. I waited a bit, so that I could tell Diana about the cancellation, but then we heard an effin' annoucement that there  was  practice. Argh. I was just like, screw it. I was so:   ``Aggravated, agitated, and infuritated ``  Â© Asian gang motto 2003  Yeah, went home called Guria to whine. I ate chicken soup though. Chicken soup makes me happy, and stuff. I so close to tears in 6th period today, but lately I feel like I'm always in tears at that time. Mr. Martinez said something about Cesar that made me think a lot.   "You need to pull yourself out of that middle school funk."  It  hit  me. I don't feel the slight bit attracted to him. What I told Heather last week about not feeling the same way about him, (and to Guria). It's hard to explain, especially when it seems like he's changed so much in such a short amount of time. I've known him for about 3-4 months now. I know him pretty well, but now... I feel so frustrated with him. All the time. I'm starting to get the stupid Rory mode, which is "omg-if-you-don't-eff-off-i-will-kill-you-and-your-dog-too" mode. :)  I  really  liked this guy. I did. Honestly, he has been on my mind ever since I realized I liked him. It's been a long, long time. Diana has been pushing for me to get over him, but when it finally hit her that I don't .. feel the same way about Cesar as I did, I think she felt bad. It's not her fault, it's his. He's not the guy I liked -- sweet, kind, funny, considerate. Now he's just effin' stupid, and I just want to stab him along with the rest of his classmates (frosh class). Stupid boys. HATE THEM.  /rage  Anyway. Cesar is dumb. He makes me want to cry, ugh. That, or I'm so e-effin'-motional around him. Plus, he's resorted to hanging out with Jamie, senior dropout and failure of the year, becase she has a "hot" cousin. Yeah, and Nicki is still giving me death looks. Maybe that would explain why I am still dying from this effin' flu.  Dad got home, and had a spaz attack. I'm not pleased. He's so moody lately. This family makes me want to cry constantly. :|  I hate everything.

       I'm extremely ill, which sucks a lot. Annnnnd there isn't a new OC tonight. :'(   So I didn't go to school today, but who want to anyway? I went yesterday, and nearly effin' DIED, and the stupid biotch of a nurse (SHE IS NOT QUALIFIED!11!!) said I didn't have fever, so I had to stay in class. I cried, because I was so sick. I skipped out on Study Buddy, and junk.   So I heard nothing interesting went on today, anyway. I should catch up on my math homework, because it's due today (but I have an extra day!).   Let's see if I feel up to coming to school tomorrow. (But I don't want to.)

       I have such an urge to randomly start crying right now. My grandpa is in the hospital. :'(   Anyway, everything's been so eff'ed up this week. Efrain hasn't been here all week, and George get live in relief that Efrain wasn't here. Psh yah. I was so weirded out when Mrs. Boyce put both of them in the same group this morning. ._. Thank god Chelsea started talking. Wow, I'm thanking CHELSEA?!   So. I'm incredibly tired, and I wished everyone would go away. I've come to the conclusion I miss Jason Papp (my senior friend who graduated, sob) a lot, lately. He used to be the most awesome person ever. He worked at McDonalds, and we would talk ALL the time while he was on his shift. My mom used to think we had a thing, lol. He cheered me up all the time, and called me Germalyn. JASON COME BACK! I miss you. :'(   Nothing feels right anymore. I'm always wanting to cry or something. And no one realizes it!   PowderPuffAshley: i need anger management or something ._. sss STEN: hahahah sss STEN: i know how you feel sss STEN: but its like inner anger that nobody ever sees PowderPuffAshley: yess exactly PowderPuffAshley: you're mad, but no one even thinks that you are  sss STEN: and i don't think they care either, heh PowderPuffAshley: yeah which sucks and adds on to your anger  sss STEN: SERIOUSLY sss STEN: >. sss STEN: i get so pissed off when i'm mad and nobody says anything... and they act like they dont even notice.. it makes me even more pissed off for some reason PowderPuffAshley: ME TOO  Yeah, sorta like that. I gave Jo one of my "earlier" childhood pictures of me with hairclips, and pink dress (ew), and she showed everyone. Including effin' George, who according to her, got too happy she showed it to him. What the effin' heck? I wished I never met him.   Um, what else happened? Took a test in 1st period. 2nd was dumb, as usual. We went over new junk in 3rd, and Mr. Eckstrom got happy. He light a candle, and the room smelled "musky" for the rest of the period. 4th -- we grinded up leaves, and stuff. CSF was cool, I guess. 5th was lame today, but Mrs. Green was  impressed  with my poem. So I'm really glad, right? 50 extra credit points. She better give them to me. That's all I can say.  6th period we had another MS Word final. So stupid. Of course I got 60/60 this time. Otherwise I would've killed someone. Richard got mad because he got a B, and stuff. We're changing seats on Monday, and if I don't sit next to Cesar I will die. Mr. Martinez knows I know no one else in the class (except Andy, who I don't talk to anymore), and Cesar   was  the one who started hitting on me when I first changed seats with Adrian. We've been friends since, lol. Actually, at first I hated Cesar so much, because he was a freshman football player. Bad combination to mention around me the first few weeks of school. I despised them. He won my heart, and for the dumbest reason too. We started really talking, because we had both liked The O.C. Adam Brody brings people together, I tell ya.   I hope the weekend relaxes me. I have three (two?!) math assignments to do. Eurgh.

       I am so high-strung, and wired right now. And it's the  AFTER EFFECT . So right now, I'm still trying to calm myself down.   5th period, we had to go to the library/computer lab to do our LBD presentations. Desirae, Nikki, Caleb, and I were SO loud hah. The old librarian had to come, and yell at us. When we wouldn't shut up, she went to Mrs. Green who had to tell us to shush up. Anyway, Dezi and I finished our deal of the project, which was flyers. :)   What I didn't realize was that there had been around class in the library, because the computer lab is in the back, and hidden from the main part of the library. I finally stepped out from where my group was working (the first row of computers, and there were these metal things that kept making us all fall over, LOL. Good times, because Caleb kept talking like he was James Bond.), and scanned the library for someone I knew, right? Surprise, surprise.   Cesar was there. I started hyperventilating, which is bad. Chantal said I looked too excited. *cough cough* Maybe I was. Anyway, I told Sana, and Chantal who finally got to see him. Yeah, Chantal started cracking up when she saw Cesar. *dies* Oh! And we were waiting by the little gates thing for the bell to ring, and Cesar was right there. Diana, Guria, and I were standing right by where he was (okay, only right NEXT to him, so obvious) and he waved hello to me. Guria got a glimpse of him! ^.^ The loser said that she's seen him around school before.   In 6th period, we had a computer test. :( I got 56/60. Stupid Mr. Martinez. He took off points, because I didn't put "highlight the damn word" in my answer. Please die now, kthx. I felt so bad for Cesar, because he knew almost none of the answers to the test. He freaked me out, because the room was quiet except for typing sounds, and he slammed our table. :( Anyway, we were talking, and stuff, and he said some weird things about Guria. *DIES!* Will not repeat things. Omg, and then we were the last ones again (it's getting to be a bad habit), I dunno. I think he has a strange feeling that I like him? He hasn't said anything, but he acts the same towards me. *insert profound thought*   *crickets*  So! He went through Ms. Rosa's room instead of the hallway of Mrs. Goldsmith's room. *cues sad violin music* Jolanda wanted to see him, and so did Nikki. We went outside to wait for him, and five minutes later, it's Cesar's pizza. *snorts* He sees me, Jo, and Nikki and yells out to me, "ARE YOU STALKING ME NOW?!". *dies!*   Everyone and their mom saw him today. Muurh. I'm glad he doesn't hang out with our circle of friends (zee smart sophomores), because I know everyone would so bug him, and stuff. Plus, he's not that ... smart. Hi, he couldn't even pass a computer test.  Computer test.  Once, I told him he should be a writer, because he has such a wild imagination. He would make a kickass writer, if he could find the words. That's where I come in. :)  God, I like too much for my own sanity. For his sake, and mine, I need to stop obsessing. Gah! Blasphemy!  The main cause over spazztastic day was Mock Trial. Walks into AP World History (aka 1st period), and first thing out of people's mouth, "Nervous about mock trial?!". *screams* I am so sick of that club now. In fact, I am SO sick of every little thing in the world.   Today, I had to make the opening statement for prosecution. I nearly puked out my guts from nervousness. I seriously was shaking in fear. Yeah, and we've got to do this  again  next week. *groans, moans, dies* I'm so scared, and unprepared. Effin' people!   That was my extremely (un)eventful day. :)   PS-Took me an hour to write this! GASP!

       I feel really ill. It sucks, and I'm so stressed.   Cesar makes me world go round.  I am not PMSing, are you?  I honestly make myself look stupid in front of Cesar, but he sorta ignores it, because he makes himself look stupid all the time. Heehee. I love my frosh.

       I'm so tired, and swamped with homework. It sucks, because it's right before the holidays, and junk. I mean, do people not think of how sucky life is right now? Puh-lease. It's incredibly trying on my delicate self.   So tonight, the homework so far goes:  Pre-Calculus: 345654 problems, or just like 20? Honors English: LBD questions. Call Chantal, or whatever. Must get work done. AP World History: Comparative essay (Topic: China and Nile Valley) Honors Biology: Photosynthesis chart (took Cindy's), and questions Mock trial (which isn't even a CLASS!?!, the outrage): Questioning questions (yeah, that made no sense)  Le sigh. I also had to tutor Erin today for  Study Buddy . Geometry is the suckest math ever. I was trying to recall how to go triangle proofs. As if I can even remember those things. I managed to do the proofs, and semi-explain it to her. Kashifa Guria was  supposed  to help me with Erin, while Diana and Cindy tutored the other girl, but no. She was busy discussing video games, and junk. Sometimes, I get very aggravated (Cesar's expression, hee) with her.   I am hoping progress report grades are not done yet, so that my parents don't find out about my C+ in Pre-Calculus. I raised it to a B-, but it fell again. Also, hopefully, my biology grade has improved by, say, a whole letter grade? I wish. I suck this year.  In other news, Cesar rules. Rawr. The crew  (which includes the above mentioned people, plus Nikki) and I went on a quest (lol, I am so weird) to look for him at lunch, today. Instead we were attacked by a swarm of seagulls. Oh well, maybe next time. I can never find the boy.   Must depart. Love to all.

       Squee. Cesar is awesome. I think I need to steal him away so that we can get married before Nicki objects.  I was so RIGHT. Guy friends are so much better than female friends. Oh how I love thee.  PowderPuffAshley: hey sana, were you one of the people jo told that i was going out with george?  LiLsHoRtCaKe918: YOU ARE?!?!?!?! PowderPuffAshley: EW NO LiLsHoRtCaKe918: haha LiLsHoRtCaKe918: sure LiLsHoRtCaKe918: ;-) PowderPuffAshley: thats nasty :-P  Joyous.   Edit: We did pen pals today in English. Mine was named Clarice. Yeah, she seemed very unenthusatic. Oops. Oh well. I think the funniest pen pal letter had to be Fransico's. Since it was an all-girl school, everyone had female pen pals. On his letter, the poor pathetic girl (note: freshman girl) wrote "ps. you sound hot". Oh how we ripped into that one.   Evilness never ceases to amaze me.

       Another thing, I've realized is that when I'm writing about my life, I have a tendency to be highly dramatic. I also need to stop randomly signing on and off AIM, just to see if he's signed on or not. I have a lot of issues to work with here. I feel as though he's the only person in the world I can confide in with all my stupid problems. Jolanda listens, sometimes, then it's back to her life. She's my best friend, but sometimes, she's self-centered. As am I. I believe I'm not as bad as her, but I am self-centered. Meh. Plus, how can you tell your friends you're angry at them, and not expect them to be mad at you also? This is why Efrain knows these little details about me.   So bad. I've got it really,  really  bad. I don't know exactly what makes me want him so, but it's definitely has to do with personality. Then again, I for one, have never been that superfical as to only like guys for their exterior. Perhaps, the fact that the guys I did like looked hot doesn't mean I only liked him for the way they looked. I also don't understand how people can like people they hardly know. Now, there's the thing, I feel like I can't say this exactly, because of Heather/Juan, but this is simply more directly towards Desirae. She's in "love" with some football player that knows she exists by a thread. I'm not sure if that's a great basis for a relationship, or anything, but that's insane. Caleb and I had even commented on her state of mind when she found out he was moving. She had seemed extremely suicidial, which had scared the both of us.   Guys I've liked have always been friends with me. Always. Or like, we're getting to know each other stage-type stuff. Ya know? I don't understand that crap. Yeah, I can understand you can think a guy is hot, but it's not like, you're going to develop a whole complex relationship with them. Complex as in meaning all my male friends relationships I have. Scariest part is other girls always seemingly get pissed at me when I say hi to their "friend". Right, please eff yourself right now. In a case such as Cassandra Bennett, who used to be close friend of mine in the eighth grade, has a thing for Christian. She can't deny it. Please, the moment he walks into English, she's all over him like white on rice. Oh how I love that expression. She gets all eff'ed off at me, because Christian and I have inside jokes, such as hi, and stuff. Whatever.   I've been thinking about this also. My sixth grade self would scream with.. frustation if she could see me right now. Can you imagine a timid, shy, quiet girl who hardly made a fuss about anything, turn into this cold-hearted, outspoken, heartbreaker? Hardly. In fact, I still don't get how this transformation worked. I think it had a lot to do with Joel, and the whole Marissa mess. I believe Marissa has still not completely forgiven me for that incident. If I were her, I wouldn't forgive myself either. What a waste of a friendship. What I'm so scared of is that Marissa will find out how her "evil" childhood friend has a  HUGE  thing for one of now, current-day friends. And she's also going to think that I'm going to sweep in, and steal him away from her. Which I am not going to feckin' do. Honestly. So I made a big mistake over Joel. Yes, I did. Screw Joel. Joel was my best guy friend. Joel and I had a complicated friendship. You liked Joel. So did I. In the end, Joel and I messed up our seemingly perfect friendship.  /end sob story  Every year since seventh grade has been marked by a particular male that has impacted me in ways words can't being to describe.  7th grade  - Joel Beccerra  8th grade  - Rory Payne  [Efrain Reynoso, he's in brackets, because um, Rory still made a bigger impact on me? *insert sigh*]  9th grade  - Actually, this year is  void , due the fact that I had lost my mind, and pretended to be a whore for the year. That, or I could put down Joshua Pierce, who was in love with me, and creeped the eff out of me. I also realized that Caleb Zeid had made an impression on me too. See?! I was a whore back then, and Diana won't shut the eff up about it. I was  depressed  over Rory that year, so I made a lot of bad choices. Okay? For Christ's sake, I wish I could re-do frosh year.  10th grade  - STALKER. Yeah, he made an impact on me. I can never be the same again. Oh, and Cesar Luevano, and Efrain Reynoso also impacted on my life.   God, how I love making these heart-felt posts. One of these days, I will show this to the world, and have a good laugh. So! What am I do up in the middle of a Saturday night? Last Saturday, I was whining to my mom that I had to get home so that I could "do homework". (WHICH DIDN'T EVEN GET FINISHED TILL THE NEXT DAY, HAR HAR.) Heh. Whatever. What I really meant was, "CAN WE GET HOME SO THAT I CAN SEE IF EFRAIN IS ON, AND SO I CAN TALK TO HIM, OKAY?" This Saturday? I'm up, because I slept  15 hours  today. Why? Um, because there was nothing else to do. Besides the fact that I feel great right now. Except for the constant pain of not talking to him. Yeah, yeah.   I'm cold. Everyone is sleeping, or at Mid-Winter. Damn them. Who is to amuse me now? NO ONE. Jo died around 11:30-ish. Jeez. Then again, she didn't sleep all day like me. LMAO. I woke up, had breakfast, watched cartoons (what the feck, mate?), cleaned my room/kitchen, slept, eat lunch, slept, woke up to watch Mulan (EEK!), eat, watch more Mulan, go on-line to talk to Jo, and now, I'm here. My day sucked, greatly. I slept so much that I feel like an old person. Hah. Why am I just rambling? Craziness, I tell ya.   So I think I really should end this post, or something. Yup, and like, continue it tomorrow. I AM SO GLAD FINALS ARE OVER. Oh yeah, speaking of stupid finals, Mr. Martinez was like, "You copied him, we have to give you a zero." Richard and I were like, what the eff?! Why? Because we both know that my work was flawless, and that Richard was the one who effin' copied my crap. FLAWLESS, BITCH. It was perfect, beyond words. I'm sorry, you can go back to kissing Tom's ass, Martinez, because you effin' irritate me. I almost started crying, and had half a mind to just walk out of the class, and burst into tears. He likes to "joke" around with me, because I hate him. Hate him. So much. Why the bloody hell do I have to spend another semester with him? At this rate, I'm going to jump of the bridge I keep threating to jump off of.   Second semester--I will try harder. Hah. What a load of crock. Try to include Cindy, Nikki, and Diana more into my life, and junk. I feel bad that they hardly know what's happening with me anymore. What's even stranger is that Diana feels it, and she knows I spend a lot of time with Heather, and now refers to Heather as "your Heather". I'm like, okay? She's my friend, not my person to own? Mhm. Jealousy rings in. Maybe, because this time last year, Heather and I weren't so close. In fact, we just started talking, and hanging out more around October. Which I'm glad for, but yeah. Diana and Heather hate each other. Wait, no. More than half of my "other" friends hate Diana. It sucks, because I am their middle ground. They only draw the line for me, when it comes to talking crap about her. Shat.  My hands are freezing, so I will really end this post now. AND, UM, I WISH EFRAIN WOULD SIGN ON, BECAUSE CHEERMERLYN IS GETTING SAD.  /rant

       So whatthafuck? I'm seriously dying. There's a crapload of work to be done by tomorrow, and I'm sitting here, mourning over the lost of my sanity. I mean, what normal person sits there, thinking 24/7 about the guy that they're in lust with? Well, not necessarily lust, because I honestly feel like it's turning into love or something. My body is so tensed up right. I feel sick to my stomach.  To make matters worse, my effin' aunt is coming over today with her bratty kids. Screams head off. No damnit. Cause then we have to play nicey, and stuff, and my dad is already effin' pissed after last night's screamfest with my mom. Just great. I hate this. I hate my life. I feel like dying all the time nowadays. I want to cry, but I can't seem to cry anymore. It's like my heart has turned into ice. I guess people are right. Ice runs through my veins, because I'm such a bloody bitch. Cold-hearted. Selfish. Everything that personifies evil is me.   I can't focus. I seriously feel like I've written a crappy research paper. It sucks like a mofo. And.. I'm supposed to be the writer person, or whatever. I hate it when I feel like my work is utter crap. It makes me feel low, and it sucks beyond belief.   I FREAKING HATE EVERYTHING. I'M SO SORRY THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH EFRAIN. I'M SORRY THAT I CAN EVEN SAY THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM. I HATE THE WAY HIS SMILE LIGHTS UP HIS FACE. I HATE THAT HE MAKES ME LAUGH AT THE SLIGHTEST JOKE. I HATE THAT HE'S DIFFERENT. I HATE THAT FLIRTS WITH GIRLS AS MUCH AS I DO WITH GUYS. I HATE THE WAY HIS HAIR GETS POOFY, AND MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A LITTLE KID. I HATE THAT HE GETS SAD WHEN I DON'T TALK TO HIM EVERYDAY. I HATE THAT THINGS ARE WEIRD BETWEEN US. I HATE THAT FACT THAT I LOVE HIM.  I HATE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME, BUT I DON'T LIKE THEM BACK. I HATE THAT EFRAIN WAS MY BEST MALE FRIEND, AND THAT I LOVE HIM.   I just to curl  up and die.

       So. Efrain situation. Not good. In fact, looking overcasted, and downright stromy. Cries.  My letter was "intense". I do agree with that statement. WHAT? Did he expect me to write him a letter that says, "omgz EfFy i luvozrs u!11!!". Please god, no. I have to intense, dramatic, and bitchy.   BLAH. BLAH. BLAH. BLAH.  I swear though, he seemed to get pissed when I kept asking Matt for er.. help. Haha. Oops, bitch. Don't think for a fucking second that I can't turn the game all the way around, because I can. Even though Efrain constantly is submissive to all my motives, he won't back down on this one. Guess what? Neither will I. If I have to pull out  all stops , let it be. Honestly, I'm sure that Matt has a thing for me, and I can use it to my advantage. As well as Fransico, George, and about a bunch of 50 thousand guys that I don't seem to care for.   The guy that I do care for? Playing nice with Clara, and Jenisa. AH. I don't know whatthefuck it is. I swear, I'm getting as bad with swearing as him. dksfhgfdjkhgsdkjghsdfg.  Dies. Dies. STUPID EFRAIN. I LOVE YOU. I MEAN, WHAT?

       Can't stop fighting the feeling.  So mixed up inside.  Why?  1. Francisco called me today.  2. George told Guria he thought I was hot.  3. I can't stop picking fights with Efrain.  4. Matt gives me leering looks all the time in French and Pre-Calculus.  5. I want to flirt so badly with Adrian.  6. Same goes for Caleb, but only because Diana has a thing for him.  Die Cheermerlyn. Die.

       It's the middle of the night, and I should be in my bed curled up, reading. Instead, 	I am sitting in my brother's room, in the dark, on the computer, completely weirded out by the fact that I have gone on for a day without talking to Efrain for the first time since Mid-Winter. Strange, isn't it? How he has slowly taken over my life. After last night's fiasco, I didn't know what to expect. I miss this-us. Already, it's falling apart. It's called a sigh. It's called a heart breaking moment, life changing even.   Why bother? Why? Because I take full responsibility for my actions? Or that fact that I am bothered by the fact he doesn't care? Or maybe I spent 20 minutes out in the rain complentating over that fact that I love him?   I'm not sure exactly, but I can't feel anymore. Happiness is officially off the market for me. How can you say you can feel something that's not there? How can you act like you know what it means? Why does it matter? To seek happiness is to seek the impossible. I gave up on that a long time ago. At times, I have spurts of happiness, which completely throws me off. However, it never seems to stay long enough for me to truly enjoy it.  Philosphy. Dignity. Compassion. These things are who I am, and what I stand for. The reason I am the way I am is because I care. Not just care for myself, and loved ones, but I care for everything. I lie when I say I don't. My thoughts and opinions, they must need to be held back. Otherwise, I tend to lash out at  others.   I need him. I do. The sad thing is I'm actually going to cry now, and I haven't shed a tear since two years ago, since Rory came and went.    And maybe, you're gonna be the one who saves me After all, you're my wonderwall.

       I went outside earlier to see if there was any mail, and it was sprinkling. Oh man, I felt so incredibily refreshing, and peaceful. Nothing like the rain to cheer me up. After all, I want nothing more than to jump out of my depressing mode.   I'm refraining the urge to cry since last night. God, what a mess. I'm over this. I can't..put myself in this type of position ever again. I don't care.   Whatever it was. It's over.  Honestly, I think everyone fucked with my mind really badly this time. Even worse than the time in eighth grade. I miss eighth grade. Mr. Rowland is leaving MLMS. I need to go talk to him. Maybe deep down, I know I'm avoiding the chance to talk to him. He ill-advisedly told me to never be involved with Rory, and I failed to heed his warning. I failed everyone.   I'm too in touch with my damn emotions. Nothing feels right anymore. I feel old, and used. My life has had too many painful experinces. Too bad for me to even bear any longer. However, the threshold of my being is still barely holding on by a thread. So close to breaking, and letting everything shatter into thousands of pieces.  I just want to leave the drama. England is meant for me. I can't live in the goddamn golden state any longer without wanting to bash my head in. Everyone acts like California is the place to be. Yeah, it is if you're into materialistic, superficial, drama queens.   Fuck this. I'm over everything. I'm returning back to my suicidal state.

       This week..is weird. I need some coordination or something, because I ran into three people in three hours. I almost killed myself on the first one. :(   Gee, I am so bored with my life, and should be doing my Biology outline. Damnit, why must I?! I hate..everything. As usual. And um, Guria is coming over Monday. Wee. Honestly, life is okay-ish. Clara bothers me. Shush though. I don't know. I just get this extremely weird feeling about her. Sigh, paranoia. Backlashes.   Jolanda's still mad. Ugh. Whatever. I hate this crap. She needs to grow up. >.

       What. The. Fuck.   This week sucks, beyond words. Jolanda is pissed for no APPARENT reason, and this time it's a co-hate thing. Co-hate? Okay, so I can't think of a word. Instead of hating on me alone, she must drag Efrain in this mess. Go Jolanda. You're smart. I don't know, maybe she thought, "Hey, maybe he'll pick my side instead of Cheermerlyn's!" She even showed him back something he said to me, which was "I'll always be on your side." Right. He is, my dear. In fact, all week in this mess, he's been my sanity. As usual.   We switched seats in History, and I sit in front of him. Um, let's say no work ever gets accomplished between the two of us. On the bright side, I got a flat C- on my final (for history), and managed a solid A. Rock on, chica. I simply can't be bothered with studying. Honestly, I did crappy on the first day of finals (except English), because I  studied . Second day, I got stressed, and decided to screw myself over, and managed an A in French, B in Biology, and A+ in Computers. I so win at life.   Although, my grades are definitely not up to par as to last year. Sucks greatly. =|. Damn. So anyway, Guria and I have started this journal-type thing called "The Chronicles". It's awesome, and so similar to what Jenny and her best friend does, that I want to puke. Well, it's still awesome, but ew. Something similar to Jenny? No, okay?   So, French. Damn. Efrain got switched out of our group. Sadness. Or not. I mean, I'm kind of disappointed but not as much as I thought. Whatever. I honestly stopped caring. I feel so incredibly bad towards Clara nowadays. I suck up Efrain's time beyond belief. She usually talks to him after second period, blah blah, and I usually get irritated. Heather, Laura, and I were just talking to him. Clara just came up next to us, and gave us funny looks. Actually, she was doing that during class when I sat near her, because we were planning for our groups. Um. Okay. Plus, ever since Desirae has gotten Kayla (softball player friend of her's, who is also friends with Clara) to eat lunch with her, Clara hangs out at our spot too. I'm just trying not to make conversation with her. Or any eye contact at all, believe it or not. I'm really paranoid about things like that.   Yes, I am such a freak. :]

       Okay, so I spent Saturday/yesterday spazzing about how he went to Mid-Winter without me, and crying and stuff, and we talked last night. Oh my god. He apologized! I don't know why, but it was the sweetest thing in the world. He was afraid I was mad at him. I am so in mother-effin' love with this boy, ah. I don't know, but I'm slowly trying to convince him to go to prom with me. Yeah, plan ahead, so no more tears.   I sat in front of him in history, and it was so amusing. I don't know. I swear, we act like more of a couple than actual couples. I'm slowly dying, being with him, his touch, he is my sin. My best friend who I want like so badly that I feel like crying. I can't control it. Seriously, I think he feels it too. I'm scared as to messing up our friendship. It's so weird. Best friend/therapist/boyfriend? Hah. I don't know. I just want him. He is my savior. He keeps me strong, and not wanting to die all the time.

       I am completely regretting not going to the stupid Mid-Winter dance. Okay, so I really should shut up about this, but HE WAS LOOKING FOR ME.  THAT'S IT. He has to go to prom with me next year. And um, Homecoming, and Winter Formal/or whatever they'll call it next year. *cough* Friday, we were talking about Mid-Winter, and junk, and everyone was being all pissah, because they didn't have dates, and stuff. Right, so they were complaining about probably not having dates for prom, and I felt gulity. Meh.   Anyways, I swear, I will stop thinking/whining/writing about this. Well, hopefully. Haha. HE WAS LOOKING FOR ME. Okay, stop me from calling one of my friends, and start whining like crazy. =|!

       Okay, screw all that other post. Hi, I think I've never ever ever been so flipping happy in my life since like, I was a little girl. Why?  Because I've got a boyfriend.  *screams*   It was too cute for words, and I'm going to start laughing again like last night. He IMed me, and he asked me if it was too late, and stuff. I didn't give him a straight answer, and so I kinda said that I wanted to hear him say it. Okay, so it was somewhat of a trick to see if he'd call me. Yeah, anyway, he asked for me number.   SFGDFSKGH!  Instant Death Numbero Uno: He asked for my number. Hi! I was on the phone with Jolanda at the time, and started freaking out. Well, Jolanda was actually freaking out more than I was.   The thing was that his family was on the phone, and I guess it took them for a while to get off. Ahaha. Yet, he didn't tell me until later, and I was so scared that he had bailed on me again. He had bailed on me three times that day, so why wouldn't he do it now? Then... my cell phone starts ringing, and I started not.. breathing...  Haha, I answered him, and was still on the phone with Jo at the same time. (Wow, last night was the worse of the phone juggling I've ever done in my life.) He said me say "Bye chick" to Jo. Ahaha, I started laughing, because I ALWAYS say that stuff to Jo. Anyway, so we were being so stupid, and just giggling like crazy.   Him: So...wanna go out? Me: Okay. *giggle*  Later on in the night, because he called me three times (four, but I didn't pick up on one of them), he said that the answer wasn't clear, so I had to make it clear that I said yes. Mhm. Again with the laughing. So cuteness.  Although, on the first call, I had three-wayed Jolanda with him and myself, without him realizing it. It was so funny though, because I've never done it before, and I wasn't sure if I had them both on the line. I was kinda like, "Jolanda...? JOLANDA?!" I confused him, but it was hilarious.   We talked like, all night. About stupid crap, but it was way too frickin' cute. I mean, when you stay up till 1:40 talking to him, it's kinda weird. I was falling asleep, but he didn't want me to hang up. Okay, we talked so long my cell batteries died, and they like, never ever die. So he had to call me on my landline, which was scary, because we were scared (well, I was) that my parents could hear the phone ringing. He's so stupid though, because he pulled out the cord in the middle of the conversation, and he had to call me back, but my dad was outside of his room, and hear the phone ring. I think it was at 1 AM, and started telling me if I knew what time it was, and why I was still on the stupid phone. Oh well, I think I deserve some happiness within this house.   Ah, bliss. I don't what else to say. He's way too cute over the phone. Seriously. Too cute.

       Okay, I'm going to try to explain last night/today in bits and parts. It started off with Efrain and I talking as usual, just joking around, and stuff. Efrain got this idea that he wanted to mess around with Jolanda's head, and he told her that I was cheating on him. (NOTE: Efrain and I are like, "married". What the hell, I do not know, ask our pyshco friends.)

       Hm. What to say? Honestly, I have no idea and I'm kinda bored. The past week has been really weird. Mrs. Green is finally gone. I think I'll miss her writing assignments, rather than the person herself. Hahaha. How sad. I'm not sure what's the point. I mean, her essays actually challenge me as a writer, so yeah. I mean, it takes me hours to write the essays, but in the end, they're the best. Right? Sorry, I can't write can't write crap without being extremely dissatisfied. Although, I have issues with Diana acting like she's better than me at writing. Pfft. PFFT.  Let's not even go there. I've been really annoyed with Diana and Guria lately. Beyond annoyed. They act so childish. Plus, I really wished I could switch seats around in all my classes, so that I can sit with all my other friends. Blah. Like in history, for the past week, I've been with Jolanda, and Adrian. In English, I loved it when we sat alphabetically order. Things were so much better that way. But noooo. Just because  FIVE  people wanted to move didn't mean the entire class had to suffer. Then evil witch pregnant lady said that we had to come early to get the seats we wanted. Freaking class. Everyone came early that day, and now I sit in the back, suffering. Everytime I turn around, Guria's turned around talking to Diana. Um, okay?  SHE FREAKING TALKS TO HER DURING A TEST.  Beejesus. I wanted to smack them. Also, on Thursday, they were being so flipping rude towards everyone.    "Oh-I was listening. Really."  How the hell can you listen if you were busy jabbering about video game crap? Thank god I left to go sit with Courtney and Adrian. Actually, I was really glad I was in their group instead with Diana and Guria. If I was in their group, I know that I'd probably have to do actual work. Yeah,  right . Whatever, I tend to ignore them now. Efrain is right - need more friends. More  sane  friends, thank you very much. I can't deal with the constant competition.   Okay, another thing, we took a pre-calc test on Tuesday. I told Diana that the test was pretty hard, because Sten took it in first, and said it was hard, ya know? Just to give her a heads up.    "They're just probably stupid. Mr. Eckstrom told us what was going to be on the test. It's easy. I know it."   Did you take the bloody test yet?  NO.  She takes the test, proclaims it easy. We get the test back the next day, and when Eckstrom gives me back my test, she tries to take it from him. Err, it's my test. He just gave her a weird look, as usual. She failed the test [along with 90% of the class], while I aced the damn thing. She proceeds to ask to look at my test to compare answers, because she knew I got a higher grade than her. When I asked to look at her test, she's continues to act bitchy towards, finally screaming out,    "NO. OKAY? IT'S REALLY BAD. I GOT A  D ."   Sorry, but I got an  F  on a math test before, and I did not act bitchy towards you. Whatever. I got so many F's the first semester, and all I did was act depressed all period. Even when Cindy fails, she just fakes a smile. I gag at the thought of Diana and her bitchiness.   I'm just gonna hang with Jo, Sten, and them next week. I can't deal with the drama of this. School ends in three weeks. HEY, I just realized I felt this way towards Diana last year too.  Some things never change...

THE PUBES. Then during the movie, I kept kicking Adrian, and Jolanda was being Jolanda. She hit me. What a biotch, only not really.   I'm currently in my "I hate myself" phase. Stupid movie, and the hidden messages. I feel so bad for yelling at Secoff. But it's Secoff.  Gag.   I question my ability to do anything.   Flings self into ocean.

       Why does everyone always feel the need to have a damn boyfriend/girlfriend? C'mon. We're in  high school . As if any [or most] high school relationships last more than a year or so. Just whatever. I have a huge headache right now.  Okay, anyway, I really want to go to Sadie's, and I know who too. But... AH. The person I want to go with isn't consider popular, hot, cool, or anything. Psh, I don't care. I bet you he'd look so hot dressed up. Mhm. He's not into dances, or anything. Which sucks, eh?  Oh god, why? Everything is so confusing, and it annoys the crap out of me. Plus, the tennis is freaking the crap out of me. I suck at sports, so how the hell am I going to make it?  Oh yeah, and at CBS today, Laura was pissing the hell out of me. She's so damn annoying. She only hangs out with us because of Nikki. I dislike her, because she's fake. Fake fake fake. Moreso than Barbie, mkay? She thinks she's so hot. Ahaha RIGHT.   I'm such a bitch. Hurray!

       Uh, a month later. I don't know. I mean, honestly my life sucks. Well, not technically. It just is extremely boring. Please give me something to do, or somewhere to go that is NOT family related. My mom and brothers went to my maternal grandparents. Oh, how I loathe my mother's side of the family.   Why?  I have never fitted in. Even when I was little. So does it matter that I don't turn up every weekend? Not really, and besides, I only see them, oh maybe 5 times a year. They make me so uncomfortable. They know nothing about me. They can't even pronounce my name correctly (or spell it, for that matter). Leave me the fuck alone. Don't attempt to make nice with me. I hate them so much. I am the outcast of all the "kids" in the family. Hey, I don't give a damn. I LOVE it. So bitch, back down. :)  Let's see, nothing in the past month has truly stood out. Except I hate this week, because it seems like everything is truly ending. Smooth sailing for the rest of the year till school ends. About another month, or so.   Right now I can't fanthom that I ever dated Efrain. The guy just annoyed me now. He gives a fuck about absolutely NOTHING, and you know what? I can't through life not caring, and I know he's just fakes everything. He currently has no redeeming qualities in my book. Maybe he is below George. At least that boy gives a damn whether or not I never speak to him again even though we're not friends. PFT. Why does one guy give SO much attention to the mere fact that I do not like him. Ugh.   Okay, get this. Thursday I was wearing my pink shirt, which is kinda tight, and hate wearing it, and wow, when I walked into 6th period, Cesar died. Hahaha. DIED. The way I used to die over him. Oh my god, it was so awesome, because hello! Role reversal. I think I had finally... oh god. It was just awesome, that's all I can say.    MINI-MONOLOGUE  "Cheermerlyn?" "Huh?" "OH MY GOD. Andy, IS THAT YOUR MOM?" "Yeah, why?" "WOW, your mom is hot. I didn't know your mom is so hot." "Uh, Cheermerlyn, he still can't over the fact that my mom [me] is hot." "O-okay." "So, did you get a boyfriend or something?" ME: *lowers sunglasses* "You talking to me?" "Yeah." "Uh, I did have one, but I broke up with him." "Oh man, you are so hot." "CESAR, SIT DOWN!!!"  ----  LMAO. Yeah, that was so awesome. Helen was like, errr okay the whole time. Actually I was too. I swear, I did not look that great, despite that Cesar said/acted like. I love the kid. He makes me laugh. I can't believe I liked him that way. He reminds me of a little brother (that's kinda hot, ew). Okay, not brother, but you get the idea.   Okay, another strange story.. Heather and I are getting stalked by the same guy. EWEWEW. Remind me not to utter another word to Matt Sheldon. Because he is creepy, obsessive, and just ew. He's like, my new George. GAG. Why is this my year to be stalked?   Okay, no more boy stories, but yesterday I got so pissed off in English. Stupid fucking Jenny is such a bitch. I don't give a damn if she knows I hate her guts. I wish she'd jump off a bridge, and the fucking Grand Canyon is under her. Ah. When did I become such a cynical bitch? Oh, since forever. I remember my first sarcastic/bitchy comment. Fifth grade, man. Justin Lester (who is nearly a criminal now) provoked it from me about Jessica Pummley, a girl whom I despise. Yay! I remember that everyone was so shocked. But anyway (Ross reference!! Friends forever, yo.) back to the story, Jenny was like "Oh hey, Cheermerlyn, I like your shirt." Becca interrupts, and goes, "But she doesn't like your face." Ooh nice comeback, for coming from a girl that can't even spell rankings, when her last name is RANKIN. Smart, girl? They piss me off so much.  My dad, on the spur of the moment, was like "Want food?" Well duh, it's me. So he took me to Gus Jr's. And I didn't change, lol. I'm so lazy. And yeah, this girl came in, and was giving me "What a loser" looks. Fuck you too, bitch. Who dresses up in the middle of the night to get food? Ugh.  Gonna go watch SVU now. Peace. (OUT!)

        Hrm, haven't had the opportunity to update in a bit, so I suppose I will update myself with the current happenings of my sordid life. Well, it's Potragent's  11th  birthday, so we're going out later today. Even though I have tennis practice, which sucks.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  ___________________________________        July 17, 2004   So this is an old post I wanted to finish writing, because there's so much to say, and I have to use in my books. This took place during the course of summer school, which was so much better than last year's fiasco with Mr. Chavez. He loves to drone on and on, which thus lead to me constantly sleeping with my head up. Yup, but that's another time, another story.
