      I was in our home that get burned years ago. In the scene I'm with my grandfather and grandmother that died when I was still a child. In the dream, I was very grown up and very pregnant. I wore an elegant pink dress. The dress has a thin strap, the hem came only up to my kness, and hug my very pregnant figure. I'm also with cousin and his mother. In the dream, I have a phone in on hand and a paper on the other hand and felt very anxious. My cousin came to me and said that I should stop using the black phone because it's for business. So, I started using the white phone. But by that time, my cousin's aunt came in the house and have something to said to me. So I stop using the white phone. And when she's gone, I pull out another phone and sit at the round dining table with the phone on one hand and a paper on the other hand. I grew exasperated all of sudden because I have to use a very high-tech phone and I didn't know how to use it. Then, there was a spectacle outside our gate. Judo players and children were dancing. I felt very relieve because I know that it was only a ploy to get me out of the house. Then, they started getting inside the house while dancing towards me. They take me in their midst and started scorting me outside. I could see my grandfather's face, and I can remember that he seems very very disappointed. one of the guys then started to pull my grandfather's coat from the hangar and drape it on me. But I refuse and said that my grandfather needs it. Then, the next scene shows me in a catholic church. I was talking with two women that I was to be my maid's of honor. I remember too that said I needed to pee. But the priest is already there, waiting. The groom hasn't yet arrive. Then, after I pee, I went back with the two women in the church hall. And an old guy started singing. I sing with him and we started dancing. The priest look aghast and the two women look shock. The few people on the pew looks on. Then, the last thing I saw in my dream is the face of my supposed to be groom. I cannot remember his face when I woke up. May 3, 2004
