        W  ell, today we had photos at school, and mine was probably horrid, cos that's how I always am *gives a horrible smile*  Double english wasn't too bad cos we had a substitute teacher and I didn't haev to deal with homework I haven't done which was due on tuesday... xD Well, I've actually done most of it, but haven't had a chance to print it off... I probably should have done it today at lunch instead of leaving it to tomorrow morning... but scmeh! I'm a lazy bitch, so whaddya gonna do 'bout it? Nothing? I though so *tough defeating smile* lol  A bad thing about today is that I didn't get to have my guitar lesson cos My teacher was away... My friend Mel is about to start electric guitar lessons, and I'm actually really jeaous, I WANNA LEARN ELECTRIC GUITAR DAG NAB IT!!! *yells* I like yelling =) Anywayz... I could get one for christmas and start then, but since I haev an acoustic guitar, I may aswell learn on that and just get an electric when I'm like... good xD  Oooh, also my friend's b*day party's this weekend, which'll rock! ;D Gotta get her a pressie yet... Dunno what I'll get her... I'll just go out n find something on friday afternoon or saturday morning... I think the paryt starts at 5pm... better check the invite xD  Anywayz, guess that'll do for today xD  Cya random people who aren't reading this! =D *waves*
